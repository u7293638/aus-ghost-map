j ETERNAL PUNISHMENT. ] The following sermon was preached by Canon Potter in St Paul's Cathedral at the afternoon service last Easter Day It was in part intended as a contribution to the better understanding of the vexed question of eternal punishment The text was as follows - The death that he died He died unto sin once but the life that He liveth He lit cth unto God Lv evil so reckon j o also by of years as to be dead unto sin but alive unto God in Christ JesUS -HO mans VI 10 11 Vi hut is the meaning of the resurrection of Jesus Christ' Before we attempt to answer the question let us remember that the church accepts the resurrection as a fact We refuse all attempts to represent the resurrection as a mere idea We ref UBC them as absolutely inconsistent with the Christian faith We believe with St. Paul that if the resurrection of Jesus is not a fact our faith is vain And let us remember also that the church is not thereby committed to the irrational belief that there over has been or ever could be any suspension of the laws of the universe or any breach of their absolute harmony When ever any fact occurs which seems to be in consistent with the laws of the universe, we know as reasonable men, that it only seems to be so We know that if rightly studied it will guide us to a fuller and deeper knowledge of law and help us to understand better the perfect line men of all things And so it is with this fact The resurrection of Jesus proves at once to those who accept it as a fact that although He be man yet He is more than men Not that He annihilates the Iowa of life (which is an absurd and mi possible conception) but that He is Himself the ultimate source both of life and of law and so the incredible thing would be not that He should use but that He should not rise He could not be holden of death So said St. Peter on the first great day of Pentecost and BO SIIJB the church ever since Yes the resurrection of Jesus is a fact But we must not be content with accepting it as a mere fact We must get at the thought which is behind it And uJviajs the purpose and use of the fact is to give you a grip of the thought which is its life What then, let us ask is the thought which is behind the great fact which the commemorate on this day ' In other words what is the meaning of the resurrection of Jesus' And we shall find that it means apparently two things And with reference to these two we may say that if it meant the first only and not the second it would be a loss and not a team But we may say also that it could not mean the first without the second because the two that are in truth not two at all, but inseparable or s of the one thing One thing that the resurrection of Christ means is that we shall rise as Christrose He took our nature and made it His and that partnership of nature because it was no rent partnership, meant for her, death If He had not died we could never have said that He had become indeed man His death manifested His real manhood But His partnership of nature tells us means for us life is He could not be holding death, SO neither can we the nature which God has taken into alliance with His own cannot remain mortal Christ is the last fruits of the resurrection and in Him shall all he made nine And as He rose in the body so shall we Not indeed as St Paul says plainly that flesh and blood could inherit the kingdom of Gold hat which is corruptible must perish But we shall have a body nevertheless whereby to exercise and put into effect our life Out of the cor capable shall come the incorruptible out of the natural body the spiritual body shall be disengaged a body free from the infirmities corruptions und limitations of this body of death, and malt bite the body of His glory in the glimpses which are given us of the life of Jesus after the resurrection we are permitted to see something of this We sec His body becoming free from the limita- tions which it shared with our bodies before not all at once as it would seem but gradually He withdraws Himself from the reach of the suiiBea and yet again He comes within the sphere of their operation Even after the forty (days after He had passed from before them all into the unseen He show ed Himself in the body yet once more to St Paul the Divine human nature up peers as by inherent merit ma perfect and glorious body as at first in the trans figuration and as at last after the resurrection His partnership with UB implied to him for the time a body of death like ours but death having been conquered the mortal for ever put on immortality And so it must be for us Inasmuch as God has allied himself with in in the dim tations of mortality must pass away from us and our bodies must become spiritual and immortal But now if tins were all we should lose and not gum by the effect of the resurrection of our Lord is the re nothing worse than the corruptibility and the infirmities and limitations of this body of death ' If all the soul he evil then what is the good of an immortal body even although it no endued with immeasurable strength and with infinitely valued powers v It the spirit of the man continue to be a selfish spirit and a lying spirit and an unclean spirit what is the good of enhancing his power and of making per moment the very instrument by which he puts into effect his falsehood and his foulness'' I look at that man whose intelligence is expended in devising new methods of most foul excess, or that other man who is ready to take life after life, just for his own profit if only he can keep his own wretched carcase from paying the penalty Hunk of the hornd foulness with which our streets and lanes ov callow and which forces its way to our knowledge even if we try to ignore it '1 link of the lawlessness that would if it could tear society in pieces and turn all our civilised institutions into mere dens of wild beasts Good God I would any of us wish such a state of things to last for ever ' Would we have such creatures as these left in their vileness and endowed with immortality to boot' Why it is one of the best hopes of the world that all which continues to resist the pure and righteous laws of God must perish eternally Of course it is and of course nothing else can happen And so of course it cannot be that the one effect of the resurrection of the blessed Jesus is to make immortal the mortal body The body cannot be immortal as long as it is the in strument of wrong doing Wrong doing IS opposition to dod and as sure as God is in hate wrong doing cannot be infinite Wrong doing is theeflictof the will which opposes God and at lost the will which opposes God must either cease to oppose Him or cease to exist not now look again at the meaning of the resurrection I have said that it means apparently two things It means, for one thing, that we shall rise as Christ rose, to the life immortal that we shall have due means of putting into effect such life, > e that we shall have an immortal body But we have seen also that such meaning if it stood alone would bring no blessing at all But it does not stand alone for the resurrection of Jesus means the new life to God the new life of righteousness and it means that new life was the rightful inheritance of every man God in Christ unites the human nature and the divine The human nature was shown in the death of Christ the divine nature was shown in the resurrection and in virtue of the alliance thus effected between the human nature and the divine the new life of righteousness is become the birthright of even man God in Christ makes it possible for every man to live the new life Jesus commanded His church to to and make disciples of the nations e of all men baptising them in the name of the Father the Son and the Holy Ghost, and teaching them His command ments And St. Paul tells us what that baptism means for he says IA e arc buried with Him through baptism into death that life as Christ rose from the dead through the glory of the little so we also might walk in newness of life And so comes the ivor 1 Reckon ye, therefore yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin but nine unto God through Jesus Christ our Lord The life of righteousness is the meaning of the resurrection So although the team notion means immortality for man that meaning (lot is not stand alone Let me now try to show you that it would not stand alone the life of righteousness is the only way to the life immortal The world passeth away and the last thereof, but he that doeth the will of God abideth for ever (1 St John n 17) In Gilliat we have power to do the will of God and BO in Christ we have access to the life immortal His life of righteousness, the life of him who willingly done God's will, is the only real immortality that is the intimate setting of the resurrection of Jesus Christ He who v tellingly loss God's will he only can become partaker of real in mortal its See now how reasonably that st Readett can be established 1 or ask your self what sort of immortality is possible for those who persist in opposing God and see if it is worthy of the name of immer tightly in front doing is wilful resistance of Girl and about doing must cease because God must be all in life And so the will from which wrong lover springs must at last cease it cannot to on for ever For him who has no will there can be no longer any wrong hut for him also there can be no longer r any right And if there can be no right or no wrong for him any longer then there can be no longer for him any sense of guilt or merit and so no conscience So of r any man to persist in wrong doing is to bring upon himself at lost if he only persist long in High the final an 1 unconditional destruction of his conscience and his will he liiitsaever of intellectual or physical power I may remain in the absence of conscience and will such the man may continue to possess But the most and the best that he can in that case possibly look for ty and to can only be the life of a mere animated machine, in capable of designing or originating either good or evil, and only able to act at all under the control and direction of an absolute master Don't you see that even if your m tellectual and physical powers were those great as to be employed by a master of mighty works in the establishment and maintenance of systems of we worlds, you would for all that, if your conscience and your will were dead, be a mere " hewers of wood and drawers of water in the universe of God Don't you see that in that case the little child that willingly designs and executes some little good work for God and for the brethren would be whole worlds above you, just as the highest of the archangels is whole worlds above the beast of burden What sort of immortality is that' Is it worth calling immortality ' No free dom ot will, no conscience, no moral nature at all, and whatsoever of intellectual or physical power you continue to possess, the mere instrument of an absolute master Is that a destiny that any tree being can anticipate without horror and shame ' Yet it is the very best that you can look forward to if you persist in evil Trossachs life in death as that Christ comes to save us well as from all the foulness and misery that must come to pass before that consummation is attained For Christ comes to inn our will to God to win it by showing us the Highest, for the Highest is love Love, who for the sake of those who are loved submits, although He be the mightiest, to the destiny of the weakest, loves her for the sake of those who are loved submits, although He be Himself the very ideal Righteous One to the doom of the sinner Yes, Christ comes to in the will of man to God, not to constrain it, but to a in it We speak, indeed, of the con- straint of love, and it is true that when we begin to give way to it it seems at first like the mightiest constraint, but by and by it shows its true nature by winning the heart to an absolute self surrender, which brings us nearer to God than ever we could be brought by force The will cannot be con- strained If you constrain it you kill it The will must not be bought for to buy it kills the conscience , but it can and may be won, and love alone can win it And so how fitly here today, while we commemorate the resurrection of Jesus God, who is Himself love, pleads with us for our love, and in so pleading pleads on behalf of our lives, form the love of God is love the only power that can change the evil will, and unless the evil will is changed there can be no righteous ness, and so no life And the love of God is made manifest in Jesus, who is the Living One that was dead, and is alive for ever more
