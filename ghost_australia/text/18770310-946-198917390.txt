OLD RABY'S WILL, ? ; ? ;. :? . AHD- ? ? .?'??. WHAT GAME OF IT. By the Abthob op 'Decoyed from ' 'i .. HKR HOHS.' '? Cbaftbb VIII— (Contikubd). At last Hugh arrives at the top of thehill. Before him lies a path which ? teemingly leads to a 'common. To the right, beyond the hedge, is an almost perpendicular descent to the wild, bleak, and almost entirely barren fields and marshes. And to the left, on the very, A tall, red-brkked house, ' with a small paved courtyard in front, divided from the road by iron railings some eight feet high — Hill Peak looks some two centuries old, but the left part — the mysterious south wing — is evidently of almost modern built. Altogether it is just the sort of house which foolish people wod'.d put down as haunted. When the melancholy driver rings the bell it sounds as if it were tolling fbrtbe dead. An old man, with quite a little harvest of white hair, at once ?lakes his appearance, and, after some trouble, unlocks the gate. And an old woman, with a tall white cap, hobbles fcalf way down the door steps, and ?hows her toothless gums. ? 'Maister Hugh Leigh?' inquires the old man, who speaks the tongue of Bonnie Scotland. -M That is my name;, and yon .are juavia AiacKay r : ? ? ?* Wba greets ye wi* a fair welcome to Hill Peak.' Ha^h gives the driver a crown,the|man helps David tocarry the laggageup-stairs whilst Hugh makes the acquaintance of old Margery Atackay. Then the carriage drives away, David re- locks the gate, and the three enter the house. **I have lighted a fire in this room,' 'BaysiDavid, opening a door on the right, ?*to keep out the damp.' . . 'And what room is1 this?'', asks Hugh. ', . ? .:'?? ' ; .';' *? The be3t sitting-room.

' And thinking yon might be starved,' . mumbles . old .Margery,'' I have cooked you a fowl, which is just ready for eating.' ♦'Thank yon.

' s\' ' ' Thena we'll dish up the dinner,' sayR David,' ' unless yon' would like , us to ? show yon. over the house first.' ' .? ' To,-morrow will do for that. , To night I feel too tired to do anything but sit by .this snug fire until I go to bed.' David and his wife go to see after the fowl ; and Hugh is left alone. He takes a survey of the room. The furniture is old-fashioned, but good ; heavy curtains bang before the one front window.; and portraits of dead-and-gone Rabys look down at Hugh from ' the red-papered walls. ' David Macfcay lays the cloth, and brings up the dinner himself. 'My wife is a puir, cripple body,1' lie say 8. 'She got np the kitchen .-stairs to gi' yon welcome, which is what she has na doon for many a day.' David is a Scot; but a long residence in England has given to his speech a mixture of the dialect of both countries. ^.Then how does your wife get up* «tairBtdbeil?' . '.Our bedroom is just even wi'. the ikitchen. There's no end of glide wine in. thecellar if you have the key handy.' Hugh has the key in his pocket. It ?was given to him, ? with some' twenty others, amongst which was the. key' ,of thedesk which holds the 'key .of .the south wing. David brings np ; ' a bottle oioiu pure aim a . uocue in wuisnej ; Hugh nearly eats the whole of the.;.fowl, and when the cloth is cleared, 6nys— . ? ' You must take .a glass with me, Mr Mackay.

'? The two sit by the fire. Hugh in an old'arm chair, sipping his port ; David opposite.' Two wax candles burn 6a the table ; and what .with, the fire and the closed. curtains, it looks more, like mid-: winter than a night in Jane. ??: ?:.! ' u Any one living here but yoor wife jwdielf?'' asks Hugh. . ??,??-?:? 'Margery and I have been the only ' servants here these ten years. Puir Mr Raby only came to Hill Peak once a year, just for a few days in Septem ber ; and we were quite capable of attending to his wants when he was here, and take care of Hill Peak all the rest of the year. I hope yon won't be turning us awa', Mr Leigh ?' 'Certainly not, good David. But yonr wife must have 6ome assistance.' ' 'With a gude, strong lassie to do the scrubbing, and sich, we should get. on uncommon well. Margery, she's a gude cook, and I was in the service of the Laird of Brawshire over twenty venira V ? ? ;' ' ' ? '? ; ?? ?' ? ? ' Did you know much of the late Mr Raby ? Did. you know, his. wife .?''-' ' 'I'll tell you a' I know, whioh ain't . much. Some ten. years ago my wife's ' uncle died' in Irontown j and left us a little money— -thirty-five pounds a year, which. would ba' weel kept us in Scotland, only we ne'er went back. You see,^ auld, Ambrose Darden, who ha'i been in the service: of the Rabys from a wee Lit laudie, and who was left in sole charge - of Hill Peak, was taken sick all of a. sudden. Some honest folks were- wanted to take charge of the house, and: nurse aoll Ambrose ; and my wife andjt, who were in Irontown looking . after our affairs, were sent up by the .agent. Ambrose was in a dreadful way. , He seemed as if be wanted to confess some thing, only he wos too far gone. .Then Mr Arthur .Raby came doon just in time too see his servant dee. He asked us to take charge of Hill Peak fora time ; we grew to like the place, and have lived here ever since.' V ' Hill Peak want's a little doing up, I suppose, having been shut an for so long?' ' ? ?? Verra leetle, sir. .When ws 1 heard yon were coming, we had a woman for a week cleaning np the rooms; and I thinK you'll find the place all right, if you don't object to old fashioned fur niture.' It's not a verra' large house.' Tbis is the' best room, and there's a little library at the back full' of all sorts of curiosities.' Upstairs is. 'the drawing, room, which . occupies the whole floor. It's a grand room, sir, and I daresay has seen many rare junkettings in anld lang syne. The other two floors, are all bedrooms.' . . * 'Is that the whole of the house?' 'No, there's the south wiiig, which1 has been closed ever since I knew the place. Once a year, maister used to enter tho south. wing alone. :, They say. his' wife's, rooms were there; and no doubt he held them sacred.' . ; ' I may as well tell you that, accord ing to the will, I am ordered to enter the- south wing once a year. All the rest of the year it .is to be locked up.' 'No1 doubt Mr Raby ' wished the rooms to be for ever loft as. they. were whenihis wife lived in them.?, :.-, 1 ;? 'Very likely;-' ??.:,- ?; . ! *? Now Hugh ? goes to his bedroom, which is a back 'room on the second floor, quite a king's bedchamber when ^compared with his Cl a-ler street attic. Hogh is tired after his long day's journey, and at once goes to bed ; but it is some time before he can sleep. His thoughts wander far away, back to Soho, and the life he has quitted, as he thinks, for ever. What are they all doing now, those people who were so long mixed up with his daily life ? No doubt all asleep, with the exception of Harry Reynolds. And then. Hugh thinks of the south wing. It is very near him now. On his way to bed David showed him the outer door, which was nearly opposite to the door of the room in which Hugh ate his dinner. Whatever mystery. there is in the south wing, that mystery is now, for;thp; first time, under the same roof that covers Hugh Leigh. ?' iAt last Hueh sleet s. 'When : he awnkes 1 he' at first' fancies he is in ? his ? attic; and only. arrives at the true state of things' when he hears D&yid; Mackay's - voice /calling .'chuck, chuck,' to the chickens in the back gardon. ?? ?? ??': ? :; ?'?? !';.''-;; :??''??

Bleakshire, j)ut; ithas come at last. ? -' Bleakshire is one of the coldest counties in England. Irontown is situated in the coldest part of Bleak shire ; but even Bleaksbire has its sumraer, and that summer is now set in with a vengeance. ' When Hugh Leigh gets up, the first thing he does is to opeh his bedroom window, and let in the sweet country air. It is laden with the breath of the homely flowers that grow in tho , Hill Peak garden ; it is laden with the breath of the new-; mown hay which lies,' ready to '?be stacked in the meadow^., beyond. .

Clo&e; to the back of the house is a yard ' where ' chickonsV turkeys, and pigeons are taking their '; morning meal in '? company. ; then comes an old fashioned flower garden! ' with ? roses, gefaniumsj sweet peas, flagi, and' wall flowers mixed together in Bweut con fusion ; and at the end are a few apple, pear, and cherry treep, with currant and gooseberry bushes, herbs, and the usual garden representatives of the vegetable kingdom. ? ?? ' k ,;; ? Hugh Leigh finds breakfast ready in the. front room. He linger* for. a time, happy in the thought that he can linger over his breakfast, and then goes to make the tour of his honse. David Mackay offers to be his guide, but Hugh politely declines his services ; so the old . man goes to Irontown in search of a ' strong wench ! ' and Hugh takes a survey of Hill Peak. ' ?.'?:.?'? .','?..'. He begins with the library. . Books' round, throe sides of tho wall, books of every size, sort, and description;.;,, ha^nd soraely.boand volumes of ancient classics' and modem standard nutU'ors,' and rare editions of once famous books with only paper covers.- An old harpsichord, near, which lies the grand old music of Mozart, Handel, and Beethoven, a Cremona, Violin, nnd ft 'cnitar with hliiA rihhnnR. Delicate fingers, long since turned into dust, may havo played on that harpsi chord ; and those faded blue ribbons may have once encircled, many- a fair neck !' Hugh takes down some of the books, just looks at the titles,' and replaces them on Ibedu8ty shelves. At present his mind' is too overworked to think of any serious reading ; but in a few weeks'; time- he hopes to spend many pleasant hours in that well, stocked- library. ;In one of the books is written, 'Marian Raby, a present from her dear brother Arthur on ? her sevehteijiith'biHhday.' ; ; Alas ;!; that' a time should, bavo;' come when that .'dear .brother . Artljur' hated his .sister; as much as it. was. in the power of his gentle nature to hate! v': s i; y '?'..??'?;.?'? ' . Hugh -goes up to the drawihg-ropra :— a long room, with, a .'grand .pianoy mirrored walls',' gilt furniture, and, a .cumbersome chandelier for six candles ; for there is no gas at Hill Peak. v. -.-. ' I:. shan't /.often sit here,!', thinks Hugh. ?-? ' The room seems haunted with tue ghosts ot uepartea gaieties.. County familes must have met here, sipped coffee, played cards, sang 'Meet me by moonlight , alone,' and 'Rise, gentle moon,'' and perhaps danced, stately minutes on this worn out carpet long before I was born .

The window of the other room, facing due south, is- not visible from the garden. The lower part of the sooth wing is a coachhoase and stable (long unused) which opens into a narrow lane. Out in this lane Hngh can see the .window of the second room. . Here the shutters are likewise closed ; and on a small . balcony outside the window stand, three empty flower-pots.

' And nowlwant yon to tell me about my neighbors, that is, if I have any neighbors ?' ' Plenty of neighbors, but no gentle folks, at least not such as you would care to mix with. There be rich people' rorind and about Irontown, with their fine, large houses, horses, carriages, and dressed-out women folks ; bat they be only mushroom gentility, and no more the real thing than I am mysel'.

He goes all over Irontown, 'and comes- ' to the conclusion that its inhabitants are but little better than savages. ... 'These people are simply animals,''*' Hugh thinks.

Many a time does Hugh Leigh stop: , before Garstone Grange ; but all be ] can see is the high wall in front, the tops of the trees in the garden, and the upper windows ,. of the dre,ary looking house, which the trees partly hide.
