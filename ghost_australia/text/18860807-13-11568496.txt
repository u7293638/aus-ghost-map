LONDON TOWN TALK." (FROM OUR CORRESPONDENT.) LONDON, JUNE 25. Politics are getting to be a social nuisance , they are very well in their place, like music, poetry, and the fine arts, but it is possible to have too much of them An eminent but not eloquent divine of my acquaintance, after describing the miseries of poverty, remarked, "this is especially the case with abject poverty " and the same remark holds Rood of Irish politics, _ Formerly it was the boast of cultured Londoners that they never permitted the topic of public affairs to interfere with social harmony , it was one of the chief advantages that they claimed over provincial life, and now it is impossible to get in a word edgeways after dessert, upon any other subject The general view is that Mr Parnell ought to be hanged I have not a word to say against it, and I wish nobody else had, but the dogma seems to be inexhaustible It is only varied by the assertion that Mr Glad stone is out of his mind, backed up by all that second hand testimony ("I happen to know upon the best authority, ' "a friend of mine who is very intimate with him," in,) which is brought forward to prove the existence of ghosts I am very certain that one of the reasons why the House of Lords has become so unpopular is the large share it occupied in the conversation of that immense class who look upon " the Peerage as the British Bible, and the same thing is happen- ing with respect to Ireland-that " bleeding country which has never a wound to show, ' as I have heard said of it Personally I am a Unionist, but a separation a mensa-from the dinner table is what I most earnestly wish it may get I envy the brutal enthusiasm of the thoroughgoing partisan , how nice it must be to agree with every) thing that one's political friends may chance for the moment to be saying I he gentleman, for example, who accused Mr Labouchere of being incited to back Mr Gladstone's bill by the fact that he had made bets that it would pass is thought, I see, to have made a good bit if it was so it seems to me to have been a hit below the belt, not only an unworthy insinuation, but one that shows an amazing ignorance of social life. A needy man who had never made a bet in his life, but had made this one as an investment might, indeed, have laid himself open to such a charge , but no one acquainted with the ways of men of the world would have dreamed of imputing such a motive in the case in question A newspaper proprietor in Essex (Mass) has offered his journal free from January next to all residents in the country who marry before the end of the year He doubtless knows his public, and has made his calculations, but the scheme, from outside, does not look very promising Supposing that his newspaper coats a penny, he puts a premium (paid in paper) of about Cool upon matrimony In these depressed times it may make all the difference to many a young couple hesitating upon the brink of marriage , but, on the other hand they may have both subscribed to him before, in which case, in addition to losing two subscriptions, he will absolutely decrease the circulation of his journal I It in a very difficult matter for any editor to increase his subscription-list no doubt, but rather than this plan I should prefer the double acrostic and anagram competition, with a pound of tea apiece for the prize winners Science, always ready to assist our social economy, has developed a new means of livelihood. You purchase a photographic apparatus, and proceed to focus some private house in any suburb, the uglier it is the better, because the more you delight and surprise the tenant by your attentions, she (for it is always a she) accords with delight her kind permission to transmit BO picturesque a residence to paper for architectural purposes, " she eagerly grants your request to set the blinds straight," and generally superintends the operation You show her the negate! e, but she begs it may be done again, " because the maid servant has got into it, " you oblige her, and she pays you 15s. in advance for six copies of the finished picture, then you make a cross in your metropolitan map against that particular neighbourhood, and never return to it again The Tones having painted Mr Chamber lame in black for 15 years or so, are now painting bird primrose. The Gladstonites, who used to paint him rose colour, now protest that he is as black as the devil, and going " the primrose path to everlasting bonfire The new story Kidnapped, by the author of Treasure Island, will be found as delightful as its predecessor It is a story partly of the sea, partly of the western Highlands, in the stirring times of the middle of the last century it has the same Defoe like truth of which the author has given us already so admirable an example, with at least one character sketch (that of Alan Breck) which will vie with John Silver If the author of the Book of notes had been alive he would certainly have added a chapter on the deaths of kings in connexion with his late Majesty of Bavaria. I do not remember an instance of more universal and slavish prostration of the human mind than has taken place with respect to this illustrious and worthless personage. One would really think to read the so called " members " of this man that he had fallen a victim to philanthropic impulse, instead of having been the life long since of his own egotistic and selfish passions. " The errors of the eccentric says Dr Gooch, are the results of long habits and fabricated by slow and almost insensible degrees, ' while Pinel gives " the case of a self willed violent boy, encouraged in every caprice and opposed by nobody as the common commencement of homicidal mania." This, thanks to such basin, has been the end of the king of Bavaria, and even now that the end has come, snobbish continues to Hatter and travel over it he calmness with which society and its "organs" dismiss the death of poor Dr Gladden, who fell a victim to his unwillingness to disoblige his Sovereign, even though he knew him to be mad, while it has nothing but hope) ed regrets for the fate of his real murderer, reaches a height of toadyism that has never yet been attained The anecdotes of the late King with which we had been favoured have absolutely no redeeming point about them, he seems to have been an incarnation of reckless extravagance and egotistic foil), mingled with a sense of his own importance, which would have been exaggeration had he been Socrates, Shakspeare, and Wagner rolled into one if he had put an end tohimselfaquarrerof a century ago it would have been a benefit to his country Yet now that he has done it at last, and in so doing killed an unoffending physicians, one would think, from what we read about it, that he had perished as a martyr in the cause of patriotism and civilisa- tion To my mind, the one interesting episode in this crack brained king's career is the self sacrifice of his medical attendant, for loyalty to however worthless an object is loyalty still, yet no one word of pit), far less of praise, has been cast upon his grave I wonder who was the well known official who passing into Pall Mall from St James 's Park by the garden wall of Marlborough house, was smartly Struck" by a falling star Many persons in that neigh bourhood are accustomed to wear stars on their coats without much resenting the means they are come by This particular case however, seems to have been attended with pain rather than disgrace "Over the right shoulder the nap was pressed down flat in a long straight line, exactly as it it had been ironed,' while the whole occurrence has been described as unprecedented. Surely, however, the narrators must have forgotten Sisera, against whom the stars fought in their courses though it is probable not so easily as "a quarter to 5 in the afternooon " Every thing is possible, of course, but, among other things, an ambition to be the champion liar. Encouraged by the great success which has attended a number of cheap publications which live on other peoples literary labours, I propose to start a periodical on the same principles, but which shall be honest, at all events as far as its name is concerned. It will be called Borrowed Bianu The prospectus will show that the journal in question will absolutely coat nothing but paper and print, nor involve any expenditure save that of a pair of scissors, it will therefore only require a very limited company to start it. There will be, indeed, one item for which money will be paid, but it is from this that our chief popularity will arise One portion, and one only, of our paper will be original, this will be our Prize Story, an institution which must needs impress the public with an idea of our public spirit and munificence. It must consist of not less than five columns, for which we shall pay the sum of one gunmaker more than four shillings for each column We shall draw no parallel between ourselves and Meconas, (1) because it would LOOK ostentatious, and (2) because some of our readers would not perhaps understand the allusion. Boi rowed Brains cannot be more shameless and impudent than its rivals, but it hopes to stand beside them. When books are out of copyright, we shall not mention the source from which they are derived, when they are still protected by the law we shall quote whole pages from them, but with due acknowledgment, and when authors write to remonstrate, explain that we only did it for their benefit, by way of gratuitous advertisement. By keeping strictly to these rules we hope to live by theft without any of the dangers arising from that course of conduct and to live handsomely A column of Borrowed Brains will be devoted to theology, and a whole page to (extracts from) the best moral essays As a rule, advertisers are not very humorous, the trade mark of an arc with the motto Safety From fire" upon the match boxes I love to quote as an instance of it, but Mr Koni√ºilre is an exception. For his "Bitter Cry of the Genteel Unemployed," he professes to have invented for the benefit of an out- at-elbows aristocracy and landed gentry a new profession, that of fashionable escort or male chaperon For ladiES who visit London, or being in London, have no male friends to accompany them to places of public amusement or on shopping expeditions, he supplies this most desiderated article 'to those to whom expense is no consideration, he offers the services of the younger sons of peers baronets, " at least one colonial bishop in full clerical attire) at a pound an hour jem expensive, but still high toned escorts from the University and Junior Carlton clubs can be furnished for a pound a day Barristers and civil service officials very useful for omnibus work, and the Soho Butter, can be engaged (like cabs, only cheaper) for eighteen pence an hour ' I suppose Mr Romeike is in run, but when I remember how hard times are with all the classes to which he refers, the idea seems almost as practical as it is droll _
