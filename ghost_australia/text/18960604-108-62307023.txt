PORTFOLIO. Christ lhad promised that, when He was gone aiway, He would send toe cor.forter, that is;th:H IolyG hoailt be with His church or people, in His place. And this pronisee as fulfilled as on Whitsunday. It is plain that th!ispoqTer was giveh' forithe first spreading abroad of the Gospel and we .read that on the very same nda as manyras three tho?tsnn who heard the Aposthls preaching in rverious langnua's ' eir e conerted and baptsied. But the Holy Spirit is given to ehnciaans for at still ietter mao i?hher pnpose" tIann to emn blen them to do mirach!t. That w?s. edd for the first preaching of Christianit.: Iht, it is nbt nededl now. And yet the Hily Spirit is as nmech iceded noni a, ten; and St. Peter, on the day of Pentecost, said to the people, "Repent, and ie balmised, every one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ. for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. For the promise is unto yon, an:d to your children, and to all that are afar off, even as mann' as' the Lord.our Gid shall coll." So the promii e of the Isoly Ghost, the Conifd?ter. is to us, as much as to them. And the best and hi'ghest work of tie Spiit iita sanctify or make holy. We all need making hI:l. We all need the Holy Ghost to -anctify u_. And it is better to he ho!y, ari to love God and man, than to do the greatest miracles. . . . . And resmember, it is the Holy Spirit alone that can shied abroadin our hearts either l.ve or any other good thing.--Jishop tf l'ak'icld.
