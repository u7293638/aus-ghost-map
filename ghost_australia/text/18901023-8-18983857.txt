JPOETKT. A DISAGREEMENT. Did somebody Bay the sunshine Wau flooding tue world to-day » Did somebody say there were rosea Abloom on the world's highway ? Did somebody sine ol the gladness Filling this cartti or ours In the time of summer and sweetness The time ot the birds and flowers? It was all a mistake, my darling ; The sunshine has cone away. There in thunder off In the distance. There are clouds on the wretched day. Not even the ghost oi pleasure Surveys the withered flowers; The gloomiest place under Heaven Is this weary earth ot ours. Did somebody whlfper. " Patience, The clouds will be rifted soon ?" Did somebody hint of muBlo? Why, the lieortR are out of tune. Yet there are pipers oiling That the clouds will pass away ; For love than wrath i« stronger, And love is king to-day.
