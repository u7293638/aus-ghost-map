THE ODDFELLOWS’ CHARITY SUNDAY SERVICE. TO THE EDITOR OF THE BENDIGO INDEPENDENT. A PROTESTANT OF THE JAMES ROE LODGE. April 24. Sir, —With your permission I would like to say a little in reply to your correspondent “No Church Oddfellow.” My attempt at elucidating the matter betwixt Messrs. McGowan and Tully is ' stigmatised as puerile, verbose, pretentious ignorance, un worthy of a reply. I should imagine after that easement of his chest and bilo generating appliances your correspondent folt somewhat relieved, and arrogantly throw himself back in bis chair with a grin of satisfaction. Why did not “No Church Oddfellow” quote a sentence of miao that indicated puerility, verbosity, or pretentious ignorance. History repeals itself—“No caso,abuso the other side.” Your correspondent is caught napping when he says that the shindy should bo left to Mac and Marcus. If that be bis opinion, wbai made “No-Church Oddfellow” put his nose in to either commend or disapprove of the com batants in this religious feud? My utterances are so childish that bo nevertheless endorse one of them—namely, that “Mac” had no business to uso Mr. Tally’s name. I only contended for ono other thing, and that was that neither a properly constituted lodge of Oddfellows nor an assemblage of delegates bad a right to even introduce the ghost of a religious service in connection with our popular order. This contention “No-Church Oddfellow” does not deal with, because as ho says it is puerile, verbose, etc. In con clusion, lot mo object to bis statement, “That the end jmlifies the means.”But it docs not— notc%’en in the cause of charity. If bis con tention be true, it would bo a good thing to hang a good many useless men for the sake of tbo increase of labor it affords, and an in crease in lho sale of rope. Of course the end justifies the means. You will pardon my absurd anology, but as it bears equal merits with your correspondent's assertions, 1 am content to stand by it. Yours, etc.,
