Nurses in Time of War. Speaking of volunteer nurses in time of war, a soldier says : 'Some of tho 'nurses are wiso, and some foolish ; somo few careless ; most over anxious that their patients should eat, should rouse themselves when lethargic, and sleep when inclined to look about and talk ; and nil are of opinion that tho patient should bo con stantly bathed with wator or scent. .'' Poor fellow I' one lady was heard to say, while tears of compassion stood in her eyes. 'Poor fellow, you are suffering bo .much! it will relievo you if I wash your face.' ' The young fellow said nothing until his nurse had sponged his face, and then ho turned to the wall with a groan, and muttered : ' ' That's tho ninth lady bb has washed my face to-day.' ' Would-be Tenant : ' I liko tho house very much, but I hpar that it is haunted.' Landlord (rubbing his hands and smiling) : ' My dear madam, I attend to that personally. Tho ghosts only appear to tenants who do not pay their rent and refuse to movo out.'
