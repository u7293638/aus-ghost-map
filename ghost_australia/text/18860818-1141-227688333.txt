Hamlet. The victory of Little John at Geelong has brought nis sire, Hamlet, into some notice, although I have frequently in these columns called attention to the excellence of the stock got by tne Western .District hrere, whose progeny every now and again crop up ana do honour to their sire bypulling off races when least expected. The Ghost is one of Hamlet's speedy sons, and Jim Cain, a foil brother to Little John, has an excellent record in the Western District, and is nominated for the Caulfield Cup. Hamlet himself bas a good racing record, having tbe St. Leger Stakes of 1872 to bis credit. As a five-year-old he won the Craven Plate at the Australian Jockey Club Spring Meeting. There are also a number of other important wins to his credit. The horse is still standing fa tire Western District, and bit owner is making an effort to secure a better class of mares to mate with him. Further particulars are promised fa our advertis ing columns later cm.
