An Apparition, The public of Vienna have been much troubled by the story of an apparition which has lately occupied the newspapers of the Austrian capital. A sentry posted by night in the lobbies of the Imperial palace, observed to his dismay a female figure, enveloped in the long folds of a capacious cloak, emerge from the chambers of the late Arch- duchess Sophia. The alarmed soldier at once saved himself from intercourse with the ghost by flight, and told his story to his superior officer. Without putting faith in his narrative the Marshal of the Court established a watch, and caused the lobbies communicating with the room of the mother of the Emperor to be occupied by the palace guards. Next night the mysterious vision was again seen by several persons, but vanished almost instantly. Another night the phantom showed itself to a second sentry, who fainted from terror. Some days later a new sentry saw the spectre approach, but, more bold than his companions, main- tained his sang froid, and aimed a blow at it with his bayonet. The spectre thereupon took to flight, but, pursued by the soldier, fell mortally wounded by a bayonet thrust in the back. The guards and attendants hastened to the spot on hearing the cries of the wounded ghost, and found a beardless youth, who was recognised as a priest. The strangest part of the business is that the Court has done its utmost to hush the matter up ; and the soldier whose bayonet led to the discovery of the mystery has been relieved from his sentry duties, and sent, it was said, to join a distant garrison. The Tagblatt, however, says he has been put in a prison, and is now in solitary confinement. The clerical papers deny that the ghost was a priest ; but, on tbe other hand, it is alleged that he was one of the young chaplains attached to the palace, and a tool of the Jesuits.
