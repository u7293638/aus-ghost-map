THE BEST GHOBP STORY. Dn. Fownu, Bishop of Gloucester in the early part of the 18th century, was a believer in apparitions. The following conversation of the Bishop with Judge Powell is re corded:-" Since I !saw you," said the lawyer, "I have had ocular demonstration of the existence of nocturnal apparitions." "I am glad you are become a convert to the truth; but do you say actual ooular demon stration? Let me know the particulars of the story." "My lord, I will. It was-let me see-last Thursday night, between the hours of 11 and 12, but nearer the latter than the former, as I lay sloeeping in my bed, I was suddenly awakened by an uncommon noise, end heard something coming upstairs and stalking directly towards my room; the door flying open, I drew beck my curtain, and saw a faint, glimmering light uenter my chamber." "Of a blue colour, no doubt " The light was of a pale blue, my lord, and followed by a tall, meagre personage, his looks hoary with age, and clothed in a long, loose gown; a leathern girdle was about his loins, his bheard thick and grizzly, a large fur cap on his head, and a long staff in his hand. Struck with astonishment, I remained for some time motionless and silent; the figure advanced, staring me fullin the face. I then said, 'Whence and what art thou '" "What was the answer-tell me-what was the answer?" "The following was the answer I received : I am watchman of the night, an't please your honour, and made bold to come upstairs to inform the family of their street door being open, and that if it was not soon shut they would probably be robbed before morning.'"
