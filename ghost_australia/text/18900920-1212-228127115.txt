In Sydney, the light-weight ias fallen to Tery 1 ougli battle with lïajler, and I think it you were to ask , ecir^e o_ .. himself, he' would own to it, With! thj; Referee. I selected Maber, and am inclined to think that Mkber is a bit too skittish am! off advice. He is un doubtjedly quicker on ' his pins than Dawson,jand has some .pot khote which quite j caimon his opponent, dlerer as he is. I really wish that Boxiana barred Burg^, fir whilst I, admit the toughness of the! outer structure of his head, I'm of opinion the works won't keep time correctif (after George meets him this time Therejwai as good s man as Burge in this district some 18 years bick, and he took b|owk that would have rattled dusky Pete, yet he turned cronky bef ire leaving here. jÏM e Referee was • guat'Jed in its tip for tlie feather-weight, aid well it knew ijt.
