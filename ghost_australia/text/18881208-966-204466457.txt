Early-Closing. EARLY-CLOSING ASSOCIATION.—Mr. W. G. Coombs, Secretary oi the Association, informs us that at the committee meeting on Thursday evening Messrs. Mansfield, Cross, and W. and F. Saltmarsh attended as a deputation from the Typographical Society, and explained their position as regards tne Register strike. Passing along Princes-street, Edinburgh, one day a hercnlean Scots Grey stopped at the Post-Office and called on a street Arab to polish his boots. The feet of the dragoon were in proportion to his height, and looking at the tremendous boots before him, the Arab knelt down on the pavement and called upon his chum near by, *' Jamie, come ower and gie's a hand; I've got an army contract." PECULIAR ADVERTISING.—A oheap clothes dealer has been driven to a novel expedient by tbe demand for something new in the advertising line, He has torn ont from copies of Dante's "Inferno" and Milton's " Paradise Lost," which are illustrated by Dore, a lot of the most hideous fnll-paoe plotnres, and has them scattered thickly about among the goods in his show- window. Wretohed bungs writhe under a rain of fire npon a pair of trousers placarded, "Like this, $S. Demons lash naked ghosts through a forest of serpents upon a suit tioketed, ••Imported,only 9201" and Adam and Eve eat their evening meal in Eden against a background of striped cloth labelled—" Pants off this pieoe only U 6Q cents,"
