^nSvatioii Army. Grotesque, but hopeful ; absurd, but a blessing to the race of men, narrow in crccd, hut admirable in deed, an angel of good cheer iu Harlequin's clothing, a messenger of peace, with a bass drum for an orchestra, uplifting fallen men', whilo tho ghost of mur dered music fleo3 nt it3 approach ; ridiculously divine ; preposterously gloriouG — this is the Salvation Army. Aftor the manner of a clown it goo3 into tho purlious, and tho bless ing of those who have suffered follows it as it departs. In this city, on Christmas Day, it fed moro thnn 3,500 homoleoa poor, ami gavo ovor 1000 woll-flllod basko'o to tho hungry. And thio io tho sort of work that it constantly doeo. Tho Salvation Army justifies its oxistonco daily — rod ohirto, tin badgoa, bass drums and nil- If you don't boliovo it ask San Francisco's poor. —
