PARLIAMENTARY DOINGS. BY, THE GHOST IX TUB LIBKAKY.. - The, fourth week of Parliamentary opor : ntions opone.d and nothing done .'.! :Thus singeth the treacherous Syrens who haunt our little sea of polities, and are '.bnde.a vouring to draw, the barque of opposition, to shipwreck amid the shoals and dangers of a lee-shore.

It, is. establishments not indivi duals which ,cnll/or rcfornyif not suppres sion,, and it is the':liighcrand not the lower pilicials, who require, the .special attention of reformers.. ; . Take for instance our charitable institutions, and to begin with the Queen's Asylum for orphans. At the head of this there is a 'Principal', whose appointment and continuance in office defies every principle of economy and utility. The institution is now nothing more formidable, so far as numbers are concerned, than a rather numerously patronised juvenile board ing school. Why then have its head a mere superfluous bit of decoration, without a particle of usefulness but such as his professional attendance as a medi- cal man imparts, and for which, upon no principle of economy can its expensive presence be any longer continued. The orphan school ought to be either gradu- ally broken up or else officered on a much move reasonable scale. For instance, the head schoolmaster, with an addition of £50 or £100 per annum, should be placed at the head of the institution, and there is nothing in such an arrangement to seri- ously interrupt or to interfere with the due performance. of the duties pertaining to the conjoint responsibility. The pre- sent master, is admirably adapted for the post, and his appointment, as indicated above, has been seriously, contemplated for a long time as one of the leading fea tures of a sound system of economical reform. But a further, a better, and a more radical reform is imminent, as it is impossible such an onerous and over grown incubus can be permitted to vege- tate upon the vitals of this small commu-. nity. Four- fifths of the children could be farmed out at one-half the expense they now cost the colony, and their clothing and education as well attended to and cared for as the children of the small settlers. What more should be wanting? What more do our obligations to huma- nity and the interests of the state require from us? The report (very voluminous) on the charitable Institutions of the colony, with the accompanying evidence,, statistics, &c.;, was placed in the hands of membors only a few days since. It was scarcely possible for members to avail themselves of the information it contains in time to bring it to bear when the Orphan School estimates were under dis cussion; but there will be yet time, before they are finally passed, to make some practical use of it, by exacting from Ministers, some definite pledge before Parliament is prorogued, that the wishes of the majority of the House, whatever they may be, will be given effect upon dealing with this absorbing sponge upon the Treasury, and perpetual cause of angry correspondence and polemical dis- turbances. i ' !Y6iiv'\ admirable1.! leaders'-1; on '.the.. ; chief jsubjebtsVof mi'mcdiatb public 'interest are .
