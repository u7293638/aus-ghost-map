AN IRISH GHOST STORY. : I had often heard of the strange super stitions in which these very peculiar people indulge. Unable when a young man, on account of the war which was raging, to visit the opposite islands, I long sought to acquire some knowledge of their strange habits and manners, but, above all, of their illimitable credulity, which caused them to believe in faries, guardian-spirits, house hold deities (bans/tea), and ghosts of every description. It was only lately that an opportunity occurred for making the in vestigation I desired. Some property in France had been claimed by an Irish gen tleman, who sought it to the exclusion of an adopted son, who, though left heir to the deceased, had fled, from Ireland when taxed with certain circumstances which pointed towards him as the assassin of his benefactor. In the narrative recounted be fore me a ghost played a very considerable part, and as this was an incident boasting the very attributes I had long desired to acquire a knowledge of, I made the narra tor and his Irish servant write down the whole case after his return from the court house. I have endeavoured (and I hope successfully) to preserve the Irish manner, and tne strange pruuunciauuu iu wuiuu ib was clothed. I give it verbatim, and can vouch for the truth of it The principal witness, on whose evidence the case depended, thus spoke : — 'My lord, I have no interest in this affair. I learnt it by mere accident I was driving over to Bruff, on my way to a friend's house, where I was about to shoot snipes ; for you must know, my lord, that snipes are more plentiful in Ireland than sparrows in France. 'Arrived witbin three miles of this town, the half-starved beasts refused to proceed any further; we therefore palled up, and while they were led round to rest for an hour I entered a miserable public house, where two or three peasants were quietly enjoying their pipes. ' The contretemps was certainly annoy ing, and I began to reproach the postilion for having deceived me relative to the powers of his nags. He was highly in dignant, and replied with great energy, ' Maybe yere honor's a sthr*nger in these parts f I nodded. ' Arrah, then ye don't know the thricks of these varinin. Sure they're not tired at all at all. Thecurse of Cromwell on 'em ! the divil a bit wake they are. It's all giggy- magow and affec tation. Sure they're as 'cute as Barney Philan, who wouldn't be tried for man slaughter bekase he kilt a woman. The oats are better here ' than beyant, so they just prctind to knock up, that they may get a taste of them, yere honor. For the widow Brady's corn is like her whiskey, and the divil a drop of bitter in Munster. Only taste it, yere honor.' 'The hint was so strong I could not elude it I ordered him a dram, which he swallowed to my very good health ; and, smacking his lips with all the delight of a real connoisseur, started off for the stable.' 'Having nothing to do, my attention was involuntarily attracted by the conver sation which was being earnestly, carried on, in half whispers, by the landlady and the peasants. I soon found out that it re lated to a ghost story. I approached them, and apologising for jiy'ctmoBitV;, begged them to repeat the circumstances' 'to ine. The landlady undertook to do so. I ordered a further supply of whiskey, for her auditory, and patiently sat %*n' and listened to the following sketch, which she solemnly assured me was true, and which some of my readers from the county of Limerick may Jet recognise.' 1 Jrepeatjt as nearly as possible in her own language, but have, of course, substituted fictitious names. ' You must know onr'landl6rd (Godt-o good to him !) resided on the' borders of 'a lake hard by the town ye're 'going to, aiid that he had been a true friend, through storm and sunshine, for the' last twenty years, of Squire M'Grath, .who lived abont a mile on the other -side ^f Stuff, s good and kind master to his' tenantry, rjesp 'its soul in glory f' , _ '!rA£^ ~ ' He is dead, then PV r''\ '?. y% ' Oh, both ; sure that's what iW^niHJg to, jour honor, if ^ou'iTonjy listen.^ J^iJV ' Squire M'Grath, about two ^pnthB or so agone, Dur^.&'blood^Veswl^^no^-s^wO pity— and you 6ee he' waa; -»iifined tB^ASs -ed, and so naturally conlM't leave Gje house.
