. Telegraphic Rapidity. ' There is a belief abroad in men's mindi that electric telegraphs and rapidity are almost synonimous expressions, but that this is not altogether correct, at all events as regards Queensland, the following will show. A gen tleman, an officer in tho civil sorvino, was recently instructed by the head of his depart ment' to proceed to Sydney forthwith, aud not having sufficient time to visit his home baforo hia train left', he telegraphed to his wife that ho bad been compelled to leave tuddenly. Mia home iB some two miles from tho Uonorul Post Office, and in something under 18 hours tbe message was actually delivered, or eomo six hours later than a letter would hnvo arrived. But thiÂ» howovor wfts entirely eoUpaeJ a few days eubsequently when he returned to the colony. Unaware of tho despa'oh wiih whioh his foimer moseago had bnon troat:d, he wired irom Wallangaira as he passed at 5 o'clock in tha afternoon. He arrived in Bris bane Eome IS hours lator, and proseeded to his home where his appearance was, he discovered, as much looked for as the deluge. Having explained that he was not a ghost, but only a real livo creature who had trusted to the electric telegraph, he at length porsuadod his family to give him some breakfast. He then returned to town and went through his morning routine of business repairing again to his home at 1 o'olook to lunch. As he left hiB domioiliary edifice with oivil servioe punctuality at 1.45 p.m., so as to boraok at his office at 2 p.m., he was met by a telegraph messenger who delivered to him the message he had Bent off 21 J honrs before at Wallangarra. After this exhibition of promptness, travellers and others need have no foar in jlacing full relianoe upon the Eleotrio Telegraph Department, etpeciflly if they are not pressed for time.
