'I believe in the Holy Ghost,' was the orthodox, 'but somewhat, astounding reply. 'Well, but do you believe in ghosts what, ain't- holy?' went on the curious one. ' Don'fknow, f or Ijuerer m^t any,' was 'the answer. Then the 'convetsaiion --n- ghosts ot- ' ghosfeB^es,' as^ sbaie. called them, became general. No one appeared lie have ever seen a real live ghost, but several claimed to have almost seen one. So it was agreed that everybody with any experience in this respect should give the resti. the benefit of such- experi ence, and the ball was opened by an account of AH^AiDEBSHOT AFPAJiJTIOTS. ' While we were- stationed ia- Aidershot,' ber gan a voice in a bed. opposite, ' and rwTren I was. a very young soldier, one of the men. in my com pany died, and the body was put in the' dead- house. A guard was- told off and we mounted, sentry-go over the morgue. My turn came in due course, and toward the middle of the night I was pacing to and fro in front of the dead-house door, when all at once I was horrified to see the door slowly open, creaking on its hinges,. and a man's head protrude. 'What's about the time, chummy ?' asked the voice belonging to the head. I dropped-my.rine, and for a moment felt inclined to 'hook it' ; but a body followed the head, and I soon recognised the man as one of ;the barrack orderlies. Hfe had been blind -drunk you ; Bee,, and- had. turned into the dead-house to sleep itofi. I did not split on-him, and he did not split on me for dropping my rifle. That's the nearest; approach; to- a ghost that ever I-see/' ' Oh, you've been-a sojer, have you? ' said the little old: man in the corner, who was in the hospital on account of '?. having . boiled his own leg by- accident. while on a Queensland rum ''busti- fication,' and who; put iip; for being a' wag of fthe Brst water. ' Did you ever shoot anybody ? ' ' I've shot- plenty of- rubbish outj and- can do. so again/' replied the ex-soldier. ' Tou've . plenty of medals . and crosses, and all that sort of thing, I s'pose ? ' queried he of the . boiled, leg. ' I: get d — cross when I'm meddled with,' answered the son of Mars significantly. ' That yam reminds me,' said -a sailor, who lay in the next bed, ' of what I may ca31 A. PORTSMOUTH PHASTTOSI. You know the old chnrchonthe road to Charlton. Well, there. was a right of, way running through the churchyards and one afternoon the sexton had dug ' a grave all ready for a funeral expected; the next day, right alongside the' pathway, and, as luck would have it, a fellow dodging along home late that night from a 'free and easy,' and tacking across the path, fell ker-flop into the open grave, and went fast asleep until daylight. With daylight came the milkman, who was knocked into a cocked hat to see, as he was clanking his cans along the thoroughfare, a face appear above the surface of the ground, and still more terrified when a voice, husky with liquor and the damp night air, ex claimed, ' Say, mate, give us a hand to rise.' The milkman then uttered a yell, dropped his cans, 'sloped' as fast as his legs *would carry him, and neyer stopped running until he reached Charlton. Whose turn next ? ' 'Well,' said the next man, 'the only ghost I ever see was the head of a white donkey peeping round the corner of a lane near Old Broinpton. I was a little fellow then. I aint so very big now, but thafs no matter, and I give a screech and a roar, and the 'moke' he give a bray, and away I cut with the donkey after me, and I never 'rtopped running until I got. homein father's- cottage among the gravel-pits. That aint much of a ghost story, but it's the only one I know.' 'The white donkey puts me in mind of a A GTTEBNSEY TEAGEDT,' said another patient who had served his Queen and country. 'It was the time of the Fenian scare, and a wing of our regiment was stationed in the Channel Islands — fine station that for Tommy Atkins, cheap 'baccy, cheap brandy, and not over many parades. I was on magazine guard, and our orders were 'very strict.' Well, during the night I had not been very long on post when I heard footsteps, and saw some one prowling round the magazine' door. I challenged once, twice, 'Who goes there for the third and last time?' So answer, and I fired. The would-be burglar uttered a deep groan and fell to the ground. The guard turned out in no time and secured the body — it was a donkey. I did not know whether ar not I Bhould get hauled over the coals. Next morning the owner of the dead donkey appeared and demanded compensation, but the colonel told him to go to blazes, and that he'd a great mind to have him fined for having allowed bis moke to trespass on Government gfouhd. I got compli mented and a- glass rum/* 'Oh, you've bin a sojer, too,' said the irrepressible little old man ; 'have you ever done anything else for your country besides shooting donkeys ?' ' I've eat a jolly lot of Government rations, and I can find some caper sauce for that boiled leg of yours,' was the reply, amid a general roar. Silence having been. restored, 'Old Jack,' the Nestor of the ward, was called on by acclamation for his contribution. OLD JACBTS TAEN. 'It was many, many years ago — for I'm a precious old fellow- now — we was living near Stockport. It was the time 'of Bishop and Wilr. liatns and ?the resurrection men, as perhaps you've all heerd tell of . I was only a bit of a kid then, and I had to work in a large factory some little way off i I earned 2s 2d a week. That was two shillings for mother and tuppence a week for myself, and I had to be up precious early and there' by daylight, I can tell you.' One morning wbeB . I woke up it was a bright full moon- jUBtas light as day. I thought it was broad (ffi^ferft.and I cried, 'Oh! mother, I'm. late.* 60 off I ran as hard as I could, without any breakfast, for I was sore afraid of the master.

Passing by this old forge my 'attention -was caught by the glimmer of a light showing in the darMess of the arches ; and, glancing casually in, I was horrified 'to see two men and a coffin in the- archway.

'There, was- a ghost appeared in Alderney while I was there/' said. the.nafrator,6f tho Guernsey tragedy, ' and ; I ? may -as-- wsll '. tell you about it.- Every night a white^f obed . figure was seen to Sit across 'the ramparts in the direction of the camp, and many of -the raw. recruits were much, scared in consequence. One night a big lump of an Irishman took a recruit's turn o£;. sentry-go for eighteenpence «nd a gallon of beer. The beer was drunk and Pat went on guard. Sure enough, before daylight, a white figure appeared, making for .the. camp-' W3io. goes there ?' cried Pat, ones, twice, three times, and then he went through the action of loading, and levelled big piece. The figure, in white gave up the giiosO then. It turned- out to be the wife of one of the colour-sergeants, who used to pay nightly visits to the officers' quarters while her husband' was blind .drunk in bed. Pat kept her fair but f raal ladyship a prisoner in bis sentry-box for a time and then let her go. The ghost didn't walk there after that. Httlloo ! Why,; they're all asleep I' P.
