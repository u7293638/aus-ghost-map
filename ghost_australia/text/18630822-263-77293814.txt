Ip the report in our Brisbane contem poraries of the debates in Parliament is .to te relied ou, the discn6S5ons which took place oa the Railway Bill while in ootomittee, were the most discredit able to -the Ministtrr that have jet taken place whether as regards the ignorance or the ivorthless uess displayed by them.'

His earth tMrks— -his formatioD Jevel — i. *s the, width of his worts before lny ieg the rails — are for the broader goase expressly on tbe ground, as fas Btates it, that when the traffic becomes heavy the narrow line of rails may be takeu up aud tbe nils for the wider guage laid down. This then narrows tho difference of cost to what is called the permanent w»y — tint is the ballast ing laid . o» tUe earthworks, and the flceusrs on which the rails are fixed, the tails remainiug the same.' We hare some: well' informed Mechanics among as in this town of Ipswich, and weshosld jnst tike to have their opinion as to the additional cost likely to be in volved ia a mile of railway by an addi tional length of 15 inches to evcty sleeper, and 15 inches greater width in the baliliticg, tikiug it it S feet deep. Would it make £50G per mile? No; and in continuous works like a. railway not £200. \Vhere goes 3Ir. Macai.is ter's jESOOO 1 ' We shall not dwell further upon the were engineering points involved i& tlic debate, bnt we should be wanting in duty, were we not to dra« some conclu sious from the fects we have specified. The Secretary for Lands and Works is repotted to nave said in the same de hate, that ' the Government would pro \jably ta.kesomeothereminentengineer'6 opinion betides Hr. Fitzgibbok.' Eminence is & comparative term, and we shall be curious to see the next ministerial illustration of its applica bility, bat if the Government are wedded, to the 3 feet 6 inches guage, what do they want further opinions for? And if such farther reference is desir able at all, why not before the country is pledged to a he«vy loan instead of after? Then tbe ministry are incon sistent, witb one breath they declare the. 3 feet 6 inch guage indispensable — it being the only engineering novelty in all Mr. Fitzgiebok's report — with another they admit the possible desira bility of farther inquiry. It ia then upon evidence — if by cour tesy we so call it — like this; the tovidesee or suggestion of aae man who lias never laid dotrn a line of rail »v i» Hit UB,,r .— . ? ?«.. .????» try have sought to commit tbe colony to a loan of a million aud a quarter. Let us do JMr. Fjtzgibbon justice, he did not thrust himself in their way. Mr. Tooth wanted a profitable job from which Mr. Fitz GtBBos desired a contingeut advantage and he shewed that gentleman, or thought he did bo how to do the work at £4000 amile. Here was a trump card for the Government, they had hitherto no autflority to help them. Not the ghost of an engineer ou whom to rely, and they snatched at the chance. In the whole twelve months since the session of 1862, they had not made an enquiry in Jfew South Wales, in Victoria, or in Great Britain, for an ex perienced engineer, but, finding that they really wanted something to give themselves an appearance of activity and a reality of patronage they fell as a last shift upon railways, and seized on Mr. Fitzqibbon fortunately turning np on the tide of circumstances as the oracle on whose utterances they might ground their .prpeeunre. ?? What qualities he was spposed to lack they' generously bestowed upon him as a Sandwich Idander paints his god to his mind. Be responded as a deity mindful of the temper of his worshippers should do. He had, probably, read of those Heathen fishermen — idle, extrava gant:-: and mendacious — who, when their wooden deities failed to still a storm j knocked them on the head acainst tbe mast till the tempest ceased ; and he had applied the lesson So he talked of 'sectional jealousies,' and die ' darning sands ' of some ' place or «ther; -and tbgr swore ty the tbree feet -sis-inch- gunge.
