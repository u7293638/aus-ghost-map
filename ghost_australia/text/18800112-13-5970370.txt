The position in which this colony has been placed as regards postal rates under the new contract íb a striking proof of Mr. Berry's singular incapa- city for practical bußiuess. When ho went homo at the commencement of last year on his silly " embassy" errand, he was told that under the new arrange- ment the Southampton mail route would be abolished, and everything would be sent via Brindisi. Our special corre- spondent, in a letter which appeared in our issue of tho 30th, March lost, dis- tinctly says that the officers of the vessel by which both Mr. Berry and ho him- self travelled spoke openly on this point as a matter definitely settled. Thus, if in no other way, forewarned, the Chief Secretary arrived in England. There he found-as he know before he started -that the English Government in entering into the new arrangement wished to retain 4d. out of every six- penny rate collected at home as pay- ment for inland services and convey- ance of mails between Suez and Galle, and vice versa, lie entered into negotiations with the Imperial authori- ties, and after a timo-by way, probably, of giving him an opportunity of saying that he had accomplished something for his £5,000-they gave way, and ex- pressed themselves content to accept twopence in every sixpence as thereto- fore. Mr. Berry, proud, we suppose, of his solitary achievement, never said anything about the coming aboli- tion of the route to which the sixpenny rate had applied, and now wants people to believe that he understood that the English Government in doing away with tho service via Southampton not only meant to carry the letters which usually went that way through Italy without extra cost, but also meant to forego the 2d. extra per letter it formerly received on the portion of the mail sent via Brindisi, and for which 2d. it is responsible to the Italian Go- vernment. In other words, he asks us to believe that the Imperial authorities offered to collect and distribute letters at home, and to convey mails between England and Galle, for nothing. Since Mr. Berry was in England an arrangement has been made with the Italian Government whereby the former transit rates have been reduced, and the superior advantages of the Brindisi route have been offered to the colonies on the following terms-viz., 7d. per letter and following terms-viz, 7d per letter and l_d per newspaper But " No," says Mr Berry " It is not convenient to " my party to have the 6d and Id " rates abolished, and, therefore, as " you have chosen to do away with " the Southampton service, you must " pay the extra cost yourselves " Now had he come to a distinct understanding with the Lords of the Treasury, when asking them to allow the arrangement under which they íeceive 2d in each sixpenny rato to stand, that they should also pay what- ever additional cost might be incurred by sending all our mad matter vue Brindisi, the affair would havo been satisfactory enough so far as w e were concerned We should havo wondered, perhaps, at the way in which the interests of the British people had been sacrificed, and might havo had some doubts as to whether it was not our duty to sa\ c them from their rulers, but, on the whole, v> o should probably have been well con tent But as oui representative omitted to do anything of tho sort, with what face can we go now to tho Imperial authonties and ask them to admit that we had a ii_.lit to assume that they in tended to make an arrangement which would lme written them down asses, and ti aiton to the trust reposed in them ? "W o are told that " a table "message has already been fonMided " to the Imperial Government, stating " that tho rates cmnot be raised ' which means, of course, cannot be raised without an inconvenient exhibition, on the e%o of a geneial election, of Mr Blerv !b blundering incapacity " abo-\o those which were chatged by " the Southampton route It " <-eems to be concluded that if the " colonial Governments make i unani " mous declaiation on the subject, the " English Go-mnment will give way Thit is to say that if Austi allans generally will consent-in older to save Mi Bim \ s credit as a negotiator and a man of business, and to piomoto his interests at the coming general election -to put pressuie on tho Impeual authonties, with a Mew to induce them to defraud the English people, they (the Imperial authorities) will piobably do it This, we submit, is complimentary neithei to the Home Government noi to these colonies Such a proposal is a reflection on the common sense of the former, and the common honesty of the latter We belie\e that the inhabitants of these colonies are desirous of paying a fair price for every service they receive, and will feel indignant when they realise the sort of îepresentations-the " cadging " representations, wo may say-which aro being made, 01 aie about to be made, in their name to the Home authorities. It is an insult to "the intelligent " people " of whom Mr. Berry speaks so copiously to imagine that they desire to throw the cost of carrying their mails in undue proportion on the people of England, who, on the wholo, are less able to bear taxation than themselves. If Mr. Berry has made a bad bargain, or a bargain which was not intended, they will feel, doubtless, that it is to bo regretted; but no thought of repu- diating it at tho cost of then- kinsmen at home will ever enter their minds. It is Mr. Berry-the gentleman who uses their name to promoto his personal interests, and wastes over his bogus refoim bills the tune tint ougl t to bo given to pi actual mattcis such as tho mail business-who, to cover his own incompetence, represents them as capable of meanness Mr Bl kuy was not foiccd into tlie new conti ict with tho P and O Conipui}, but went luto it with Ins eyes as wide open as over they aie to aijthing but his own id\ancement, and as lie has made tho bed foi us, so aro wo bound ni honour to hoon it If wo i ill entrust our busi ness to bungleis, we ought to be pre pai ed for any consequences that may follow then iction Whether the British Government will consider it its duty on some bioad ground of public policy to wit, tho supposed necessity of yield ing o% erything to colonial importunity -to givo way, we cannot say Wo con ouly affirm that, in our opinion, it will bo disgraceful to the colonies if such a concession bo asked for Wo make no apology for returning once more to the plebiscite. The poli- tical cards are shuffled so often, and by so many hands, that it is difficult to con- jecture the precise nature of the reform game which the Ministry will endeavour to play at the general olection, but we gather from signs which can scarcely be mistaken, that whatever else goes the plébiscite will bo retained. The sixth clause and the nominee principle are so unpopular that in any change of front they aro more than likely to be dropped. They have been condemned by the Ministerial press, and members of the Cabinet have publicly announced that rather than endanger the bill they would give up both of these vital prin- ciples. The Governor may be tricked and tho Assembly betrayed by the aub mÍBBion to the country of a practically new measure, but for decency's sake some fragment of the old bill must be pre- served, and this one atom will probably be the plébiscite. The Chief Secretary, it is true, is lukewarm on the subject. Ho would cheerfully cast off tho plebiscite and adhere to the other por- tions of the bill, but he will scarcely be permitted to do so. Most of his col- leagues are in favour of the principle, the reform leagues swear by it, while they look coldly on the sixth and nomi- nee clauses, if they do not actually con- demn them, and the chief organ of the party preaches nothing else. What- ever changes may be made, therefore, the probability is that the plébiscite will continue to be the central feature of the Ministerial scheme. Under these circumstances we may be excused for harping upon a disagreeablo topic. In the discussions which have taken place in Parliament and in the press, the ingenious device for establishing an autocracy under the name of the people's vote has been pretty well dissected, and its dangerous character exposed. It has also been pointed out that it is entirely repugnant to British institutions, and that there is scarcely a possibility of its becoming law. Still, as the electors will be asked to vote upon it, there is no impropriety in dealing with it on its merits. Wo have already shown that the plébiscite is the chosen instrument of the autocrat or the agitator for bending the masses to his will ; but people in tho country probably do not fully realise how completely the small electorates would be swamped by the adoption of the Napoleonic idea. They would, in fact, be practically deprived of the franchise. Even under the exist- ing system much injustice is done. A contest in which two or three thou- sand electors take part is frequently decided by a few votes, and nearly one half of the constituency is disfran- chised. To rectify this anomaly scien- tific politicians have proposed various schemes for the representation of mino- rities, but the idea has never yet been embodied in any practical form. But the minority even now makes its voice heard. In many constituencies opinion is so evenly balanced that where two members have to be chosen the domi- nant party is only able to return one. The majority may send in their favourite at the head of the poll, but it is beyond their power to furnish him with a colleague. Instances of this kind were common at the last general election, as, for example, in the cases of St. Kilda, Emerald-hill, and Richmond, in which a liberal candi- date headed tho poll, but was followed closely by a constitutionalist, the result being that both sections of the electorate secured a representative. To this extent minorities aro now protected, but with li - . 1'7 J-.'». li.- _J_1- _u i," tlio plebiscite tho advantage would bo entirely swept away Tlio absolute in ijonty of tlie whole electorates -would go\ern-the biutal foi ce of numbers would overpower all opposition It is in tho country constituencies, possessing Luge interebts but inferior numerical strength, tint the injustice would be most keenly felt lue electors foi the Assembly at the close of 1S78 numbered 191,108 Of these about 70,000, or more than one third of the entire Toting sticngth of tho colony, belonged to the thickly popu 1 ited distncts, \u, Melbourne and the suburbs, and Ballarat and Sind hui st Under the existing sjstem the minonty in these distncts at the last genenl election was iblo to send into Paihament nearly one thud of tlie total number of members returned, and the minority was therefore not cntnely uniepresented But what would be the result if the phbi<iri(e weie m opera tion?

From tho tone of the cable message which wo publish this morning there appears to bo aerious grounds for presuming that with tho entry of spring the peace of Europe will again be disturbed. On the 2nd of December last our London correspondent telegraphed that it was then understood that certain negotia tionswhich were taking .placo between Great 'Britain and other European powers had re fercnce to a political scheme between Hngland, Germany, France, and AuBtria for securing the control of Great Britain in Asiatic Turkey, an improved seaboard for Germany, and the complete isolation of Russia, and that tho first Btep towards the accomplishment of those objects would probably bo the Austrian occupation of Constantinople Tor some time past it baa been known that the re- lations between KuBsia and Germany ha\c not been too cordial, and now we learn that Russia is massing the enormous force of S'iO.OOO men ni Poland, cloae to the German frontier-a movement which is fraught with tho greatest signifi- cance, and which will probably ho found to have important results 'Hie fact that Kuasia ia supporting Servia in her opposition to an Austrian scheme for the construction of
