Sporting Cocksureness. ROWING MEN, rowing touts, rowing tipsters and aquatic individuals generally, stand out! You disgraceful lot of frauds ! Arn't you thoroughly ashamed of yourselves ? Don't you want to bury your heads in the sand and avoid the scorn and indignation of the public ? To a man, from the biggest oarsman on the river, down to the tiniest coxswain, you prophesied the entire and utter defeat of the Sydney men. Some of you—most of you—declared the crack Sydney crew to be a "lot of rats," and that it "onlyiwanted six men in the Melbourne boat to lick such a duffing lot." Like the racing tipsters, you touted, and watched, and nodded, and winked, and whispered to each other, and as knowing generally as owls in daylight, and if any outsider even hinted that he only thought that perhaps the Sydney men might, after all, just have the ghost of a chance, he was laughed to scorn and eat on at once. Oh, rowing men, rowing touts, and rowing tipsters I take a sliding back seat, and cover your heads with For, like the racing tipster, you know absolutely less than nothing about the sport you profess to be so thoroughly up in, and you sell and mislead the public, year after year, in the most disgraceful manner. Learn, oh sporting tipping tribe, to speak in the future with a little less "cocksureness," and remember that a race is never lost till it's won. Try, oh "cocksure writers and speakers," in the future, to see some merit in your opponents before the race. Don't have to discover their superhuman merits after the race—don't. Farewell, oh, sporting prophets! The next time ME., PUNCH meets you, may the cocksureness have disappeared from your visages, and may you have learnt some modesty.< IMMENSELY POPULAR. —There are some shareholders in Sandhurst so immensely popular that they are always paying calls.
