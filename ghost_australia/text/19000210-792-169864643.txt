Time Long Past. Like the ghost of a dear friend dead Is time long past. A tone which now is for ever fled, A hope which now is for ever past, A love so sweet it could not last, Was the time long pastl There were sweet dreams in the night Of time long past; And was it sadness or delight, Each day a shadow onward cast. Which made us wish it yet miglit last, That time lotng part! There is regret, almost remorse, For time lone past. 'Tis like the child's beloved corse, A father watched, till at last, Beauty is lik^ remembrance cast, Shelley.
