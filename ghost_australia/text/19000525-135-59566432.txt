Left Undone. It sln't the thing you do, dear, It's the thing you've left undone, Which gives yun a bit of a heartache At the setting of the sun. The tender word forgotten, The letter you did not write, The flower you might have sent, dear, Are your haunting ghosts to-night. The atone you might have lifted Out of a brother's way. The bit of heartsome counsel You were hurried too much to say ; The loving touch of the hand, dear, The gentle and winsome tone, That you had no time nor thought for, With troubles enough of your own. The little acts of kindness, So easily out of mind; Those chances to be angels Which every mortal finds They come In night and sallence Each chill, reproachful wrath When hope ia faint and flagging, And a blight has dropped on faith. For life is all too short, dear, And sorrow is all too great, To suffer our slow compaialon That tarries until too late. And it's not the thing you do, dear, It's the thing you leave undone, Which gives you the bit of heartache At the setting of the sun.
