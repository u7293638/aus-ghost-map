THE HARTON HILLS GHOST. .. | The silly fellow who has, during some months past, caused much alarm, and at least one serious accident for which he should be made amenable in justice, has at length been caught in the act - for tunately, for him, before he was "Peppered" with small shot, as he well deserved to be. It appears that Mr. C.F. Harding, a farmer residing at War- rabkook, accompanied by one of his men named Flower, went out one night last week to look for the pretended apparition, and found him about two miles this side of Mr Carmichael's station. He was, as usual attired in a white sheet, artificially raised some two feet above his head. Immediately upon seeing him, Flower flung himself down upon his knees, and prayed with unwonted fervour to be saved ; but Mr Harding, Perceiving a pair of colonial made boots peeping out from under the sheet, approached the figure, and it instantly fled. Mr Harding gave chase, and after a brisk run caught the nuisance, who turned out to be a wood splitter named Robert Downie. Mr Harding's earlier, and better, impression was to duck the fellow in a dam close by, but for some reason or other he didn't do so. However, on his asking Downie why he had given so much uneasiness to unoffending persons the latter replied that he was only larking, and that he intended keeping it up until some one should have the pluck to accost and catch him, as Mr Harding had done. He then promised that he would not again attempt a supernatural role, and was let off a little too cheaplv. as most persons will incline to think, â€” Hamilton Spectator.
