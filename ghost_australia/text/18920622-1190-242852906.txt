THE " CHOST " STILL WALKS. ANOTHER PROMENADE LAST NIGHT- STEPS MUST BE TAKEN TO LAY HIM. Tho cowardly idiot, who has recently amused himself by playing tho ghost in tho ncigborhoed or Elsterir-vick and Last St. Kilda, frighteninc ladies and children, and rousing indignation among tho mala residents, still continues his infamous pranks. Last nicht he was out again, this time at Last St. Kilda, where a Miss Stewart received a severe shock caused by the " apparition" suddenly presenting itself clad all in whito near tho intersection of Inkermnn road and Aloxander street. The young lady was naturally very much frightened. On tlio occurrence being reported to her father ho went out armed with a revolver, and accompanied by friends bearing stout sticks. Tho " ghoBt," however, was nowhere to bo seen, which was perhaps fortunato for himself. It is related that the fellow is usually wrapped in a white sheet or long white garment of somo sort, but thnt ou ono occasion ho sought to hcighton tlio effect by curryinc a wtiito umbrella which ho suddenly opened m he inndo his spring from his hiding place. The matter has been reported to tho police at Lost St. Kilda, but tho local forco is so slight that they arc unable to keep a proper look nuL In tho mean time tho fcmnlo population of tho district Is in a state of terror, and no lady cores to venture into any of the quieter streotB after dark unless properly escorted. Tho polico authorities should regard this as a special case, and take special steps to "lny" the ghost. If this be not done he may fall a victim to a bullet from a revolver, fired by some Indignant mala relative of some of tho "ghocts" victims.
