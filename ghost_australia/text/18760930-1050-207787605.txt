If any in the city ; of Laodicea' were ever led to unite them selves with Jesiis,' it was by no means of a few who observed' the full simplicity of the ancient faith; and- who, -though honest,- tender, and courteous; in all their dealings with the heathen, still wont not'a 'step- with theni' in conformity to any offtheir ' customs; ' -In time; though- the family we speak of never - :broke off from the Christian- Church; yot, if you had' been in it; you might lufte heard much, warm and earnest con versaiion about things that -took place at the baths, or in feasts to various divinities': but if any one spoke of- Jesus, there ; was immediately a' cold Bilence— a. ! decorous, chilling, respectful pause, after which the con versation with- a bound,' iiew back into the old channel again. ' ' - : . - ' It was now night, and tlie house of Onesi- phorus the Elder was blazing with torches, alive with music, and all the hurry and stir of a sumptuous banquet. All the wealth and fashion of Laodicea were there— Christian and heathen; .and all. that the classic voluptuousness of Oriental Greece could give to shed enchantment over the- scene was there. . In ancient times, the. festivals of Christians in Laodicea had, been regulated.in the spirit of the, command of Jesus, as recorded: by Luke, whose classical Greek had made his;the established version in Asia Minor.

Now, his eye ' was fixed with a . quiet scrutiny on the idola- irons 'statues, with' their votive 'adornments , lioWj'itfollowed earnestly the young forms' that were wreathing in the graceful, waves of the dance ; and then he turned toward the tables,: loaded with every ; luxury, and sparkling with \- wines, where the, devotion to Bacchus became' ' more than poetic . fiction ; and,' as lie': gazed, a high indignant- sorrow seemed to overshadow the calmness' oL his majestic face.":' When, in . thoughtless merriment,1 'soinc of . the , gay com pany sought -to address-him, f hey .-found them selves - shrinking- > involuntarily > froni; the soft piercing oyepand tremblingat tlie' low, syveet. tones in which lie replied.

' She seemed as strangely attracted towards him as others were repelled ; and when unsolicited, in the frank confidence of childhood, she - pressed to his side, and placed her little hand. in his,' the look of radiant compassion and tenderness which beamed down from those eyes was iudeed glorious to behold. Yet hero and there;: as -lie glided among the crowd, he spoke in - -the ear of some Christian words which, though soft and low, seemed to have a mysteri ous and startling power ; for, one after another, .pensive, .abashed, and confounded, they drew aside , from the gay scene, and seemed lost in thought. That stranger — who was he ? Who ? The, inquiry passed from mouth to mouth ; and one and another, who had listened to his low, earnest tones, looked on each other with a troubled air. Ere long ho had glided hither and thither in the crowd, he had spoken in the ear of every Christian, — and suddenly again lie was gone, and they saw him no more. Each had felt his heart thrill within him — each spirit had vibrated as if the finger of its Creator had touched ;it, ; and shrunk conscious as if an om niscient eye were upon it. Each heart was stirred ; from its - depths. <Vain sophistries,, Worldly maxims, making the false seem true — .
