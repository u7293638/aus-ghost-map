Chapter I; The night had closed dark and stormy around bis Britannic Majesty's frigate Belvidere, Captain Byron, one' i of the.blockading squadron then anchored in i; Delaware Bay, end 'the second cutter's crew, (who composed the watch,) with the exception of tho lookouts and sentries, were gathered in groups on the nAAmc An undni' iVin Ida rtf . .4-Vts* linntn UUV1UO) V/ll UUUI^t IUQ 1VV V*. I'AAl? UUktbOj listening to' tho. sage speculations of certaia old salts, upon some contem plated -expedition into ' Yankeedom.' It was rumored .in the ship that such an enterprise was soon to bo attempted, and after the extent of the. preparations known to have boon already made in the flagship, ' the frigate, and the smaller vessels of the squadron, it was shrewdly surmised that a much larger, force than usual was to be employed on the oc casion. The boats of the squadron had ' been actively employed for several weeks in burning the bay craft, capturing out ward and homeward bound merchant men, anchoi ing buoys, and obtaining soundings ; and, as this had proved very laborious and harassing duty, Jack was not a little excited by the prospect of what he termed a little landprivateer ing by way of a change. Certain men were'indeed, to be found in the fleet who wonld have repelled this assertion with the most unequivocal symptoms of in dignation — fellows who had rolled so long.on the seas ns to have decidedly lost: all relish for locomotion on; shore. ? These men were well known and per-; fectly understood by their officers, who' would _bave soon thought of sending the ship's monkey on a watering : party . as to have trusted them further lhan the beach on any species of .duty; .. They were emphatically ship keepers, They stuck to the vessel as closely as her cat heade, and were nearly as helpless as ; pieces 'of- stranded timber out of her. ' «i»- . With this class of ' amphibia,; however,'' ? we* h'ave* nothing' to do J at' presentees:-: ce'ptto notice that they formed a 6rhall * squad by themselves on the night in question, and scorned to mingle in the conversation of'their companions. Pains had been taken to keep tho object of the expedition a secret from' the men ; but it was known generally in the ship that a night landing was to be effected' by strong parties on several points of the Delaware shore. Beyond this all was conjecture for'ard ; a few \- old heads might perhaps have elucidated the. mystery ; but these favored ' few, were much niore inclined to play upon the credulity of their, shipmates, than to ' let the cat out of the bag'' by any indis cretioh of their own. ?- ?? : ??? : ? ' A still tongue shows a wise head,' even' in amarihe, as is little better than a dead head in a ship ;'' said old Tom Pintle, the favored oracle of one of these groups. ' Howsomever, if any chap be especially anxious to get an insight in sight into his reckoning aforehand, let him touch his hat and put the question to little Billie Broom, as is even now fishing for eels in the main channels, as quietly as if there were no more coast sarvice on tho carpet. And again,' continued he, after a short pausei ? '/mayhap some on yon may prefer ap plying nearer head quarters for intel ligence— thinking, belike, Billy is too feather-headed to be trusted with any thing .but an order for slops on Ninety nine-jn- a hundred. In that case, I'd. advise you to step aft and make, a polite inquiry- of Childe Harold, as is walking the quarter-deck in a pea jacket, seeing that the leftenant has not turned out yit— as riguarlarly as if the ship were'going nine knots by the log, in stead of riding out this here . nor'easter, behind the pitch of the cape, with both anchors down , on a : Yankee bottom. Seeing's believing, and hearing's next door' to it — so I'll do as good a ' turn another time to! any civil smooth-spoken chap as will: volunteer to save an old salt from dying of a woman's fever this same squally March night.' ?'..',' ' Come, Tom,' answered one of his younger messmates, 'none of your rigging. : We all know that you are as deep in the mud as the Captain is in the mire.. I'm. blessed if I'd give an old sodger to know more about the ^matter. There's fun ahead, lads, of that we're sartain, and beggars mustn't be choosers as theblind man said when he stole the gentlemau's boots.1 So if Tom will j bat spin us a yarn to Btay our stomachs till tho wale)) is out, blow me tight if we don't rig him out in a shore-suit of tho old Ninety-nine's best — that , is if tho Yankees leave three men in the moss to muster round the grog-tub again.'.. ' Ned,1' said another, as ,the pro position was received with , applause, ' but you're as good as a land ngent to strike out a thing. I'm something of a scholar myself; but let me tell yon, my mates, there is no man in the fleet can hold a candle to Tom Pintle for spin ning an out-and-out sea yarn, with ghost-capers enough for seasoning.' ' Ay ! ay !' said the first, ' ho can do it like nobody eko. Heave ahead, Tom— for tho leftenant's on deck, and the eels won't bite— and here, in good time, comes the Childe and little Billy. A seat on the booms here, Mr Broom, out of the wind and the first luff.' The midshipman addressed, stowed himself away in a snug place beside the coxswain. His companion, who was several years' older, seated himself closer to the oracle. ? ' ' Now, what sort of a meeting of Parliament are you holding here ?'' said the last ; ' is old ? Toni turning the wench, or are you voting all your prize money to the ship's chaplain ?' ' So please you, sir,' said a foretop man, ' Tom is jest setting up tho stays, of his inventive faculties.' 'Well,' said the young officer, who was a great favorite in the fleet, ' now that we are snug, Tom, begin quick.' 'As the 'monkey said, when he threw the live coal in the magazine,' said Billy Broom. '-, '' '?.''.' ? ' What sort of a yarn will you have, Mr Lear ?'' said Tom, shifting his quid; ' 'I leave that to Mr Broom,' said the midshipman, ' What will you have, Billy?' ? : ' Why,' answered Billy who was a' mere -boy in appearance, 'give us some thing in keeping with the company.' ' Something stiff and a'irish, I sup pose, Billy,' said the Childe — ' the devil on a cruise on a dark night— some- thing of that sort.'1. . ' ??;-* ?? A^^J^KHj^tef^Bgihig'ieyCT,* ' give us something about the devil.' . 'I have but one yarn of -that sort that I can lay my hand on at present, Mr. Broom,1' said Tom ; ' and I'm most, afraid to spin that this night, 'specially as it's all true as the parish church record.' . ;.'' '.',, ' None of your gammon,'' said Billy, ' but phy it out hand over 'hand, or' it will be worse for you.'1 ' Well, sir, if I must, I must, as the boy said when he turned to 'arid licked tub schoolmaster. But'the last-time I to] d that yarn, was in a lino-of-battle ship, in these same latitudes nearabouts. Hang me if it didn't blow great, guns for a week, and then settled into rignlar hurricans. We had sprang the ship's main-yard that same night, hoisting in the black cat ; and the next day, while we had the yard on; deck, the sun ran butt np against the line, and the nox quiequal gales began to blow, and the Commodore lost all his shirt-collars. and panorama hats, and- ? ' ' You be hanged !' snng out Billy Broom, testily, to the audible' amuse- ment of his companions. ' I' want none of yoiir durobfudgeon. Pay out hand somely, or I'll have your grog stopped for a fortnight.'' ' ' Here's at you, then,' said Tom, in some alarm. ' I'll do my. best, and I really believe, jokingiapart, that I shall think of old Davy^ and his cocked hat, and his , red-hot: boarding pike,, in my last moments, slip my wind as Imay, in spite of the parson. . You see, .sir, I was making a cruise in the.- Hades, a fine forty, during the last war with the Dons, when off Brazil coast we fell in with a strange: sail, and brought her .to just before sun^o Am. She was a. herm aphrodite brig of three hundred tons, with, raking masts. What little sail she had on her was set after a crazy fashion,, and when we hailed her, she hove u p to the wind very ? cl umsily. We found no one on deck but the Captain, the chief mate and tho black cook, all sick of the coast fever, .and nearly dead, for a drop, of fresh . water. The rest were in the deep, sea, and after the captain had moistened his throat, a terrible tale he had to tell of it. . . '. It seemed the brig was a Spanish slaver, bound to Rio, with 350 blacka moors. . Just between the two coasts it was accidehtly discovered that, by some oversight; of the mate's, there was not' fresh: water enough on board' to. last all \ ?U:.:::-i-ir'i\': i''--\ '-'i' '? -';'iU;. ;;.'':'; ?? i^ w;i hands twenty- four . hours. To make matters .still worse .4a,. gale of wind sprung up and drove them down to wards the line. After blowing great guns for three days, the winds went to sleep, and left them' with a crippled craft on a tumbling ocean. A thorough search was made, but hot a single beaker turned. np :.so it was concluded to make all tho blackbirds walkithe plank, and bear up for their portfAgain. There were thirty men before'?fhe mast, \vithr three mates and a Frencttsiteward, which' made thirty -five souls -adarge crew for: the size — besides tho darkies; whoiwere all to be brought on, deck, two at a. ' time, and shoved over the, mainrail into ; the. ocean. To make tho story short: they turned to at sunrise, and before '? eight bells. ..in the morning watch, the brig's hold was clear. , ^ 'It. seemed, however,' tnat after they washed decks down and. went to break fast, the chief mate would 'not bo per suaded but there were more darkies below, though every one else knew that never a nigger was left, save the black cook, who next to the mate, was most active in sending them to: Davy's locker. Tho fellow's brain was turned, do you see, by the horrors of his situiation ; for the captain said he was eternally enrsiug tho men for doing things by halves, and running below every time eight bells struck swearing he heard them yolling '? after water, in their gibberish — now in the forepeak— now midships-— and now chock aft in the run. ? I suppose the screams of the drowning men — for men they sartainly.be— the heat, tho smell,, and the work — for they must have been busy as fiends — had sot him stark fran tic. He just kept playing' thor same ' game, till the fever which swept off the' rest on 'era took hold on him. : ' He was nearly gone, iwh'eri wo took him' on board the frigate; though he im proved very fast afterwards. After the hold wasclearj it rained a spell, and they caught enough water to have saved the whole cargo, had the clouds opened a few hours earlier. As'it was, they were all drowned* and the bloody thieves that' stole them. had the benefit of the fresh -wSter.it; 'How^never^ftf^rio use argufy ing ; the sea swallowed them -up as easily .as a whale would swallow a herr ing. Two weeks afterwards,' the fever boarded them, and from that time, until we captured the brig, they ? had been dying one after another, like sick sheep. 'The three men we saved improved so fast in twenty- four hours, that our captain determined to send them homo in the brig. : Accordingly' she was thoroughly overhanled, and ? a master and ten men, with despatches for the Admiralty Office, sent on board. We parted company with the frigate at sun downi and had a fine run to the line, before anything happened worth telling, except that some of the chaps conceited that they heard strange noises below at night, and the Spanish mate went back to his old trick of hunting up the niggers. ? If we checked him he got raving crazy, so the officer — whose name was Millet —said- 'twas best to let. him have his own way, and perhaps he might live to reach home and be hanged. Nothing could'm&ke; the cook sleep between decks, though, the Spanish captain turned in and put with the men, standing, his watch like the rest on ns. As for his mate, he was too busy at his crazy pranks to be particular ; but wherever; ho chanced to drop there he'd roost until he woke up and went at it again. .' When the brig- had made -the run between the tropics, the slave captain began to hear the noises below, himself, and after standing it in silence for a spell, he gave up his berth, and kept deck with, the nigger. One arter another, the, crew became infected, until, turning in my hammock one night, in tho middle watch,, I heard the screams and moaning plain enough myself, and. up on deck we carried our dunnage, and left all between for the ghosts to caper in. ' The master's mate in charge laughed at all this. He was one of your regular dreadnoughts. Snapping his fingers, at the ghosts, he sworo they were welcome to their passage, as long as they kept between decks. He had all the , cabin to himself, and was as merry as a jug, cracking on the old craft whenever he had a chance, as if he meant to drive her out of the water. ? . ' At last it fell flat calm, and on a clear night, at seven bells, in the first watch, the Spanish mate raised a strange sail, coming np astern like a rnco horse. The wind began to .ripple the sea like atspaws, but soon it freshened so that we got steerage-way on the craft. Wo had the stranger broad on tho weatherf beam, when all at once he vanished and we saw no more of him for two bells. I had my eyes on him, and could see down to his decks, when I happened to squint, and lost sight of him altogether. ''For'ard there ! do yon see the strange sail to windward ?' said' tho officer. '????;'? ' ' No, sir !' was the answer, ? he's gone like a fly-away.' ' ?' ' I Very good 1' said Mr. Millet, ' up there and loose the royals.' ' ' I'll go below sir,' said tho Spanish mate, as he was standing quietly in tho waist, 'and roiiso them out. . ¥ot 'the water's nearly all gone, and it won't rain 'a drop while there's a slave left in the hold, and'— - — ' - .;, ? ' ' Hang the fellow,' said tho officer,' ' he's as crazy as a drunken lamp- post.' ' ' On deck there !' sung out a ninn from aloft. ?''?''.'.' ' ' Hello !' answered Mr. Millet. .' ' 'Here's the fellow, sir, dead ahead, coming down on us like all-flying.' ' ? I knowed it,' said the Spanish mate, ' but they shan't catch me nap ping-' With that, he made a spring for the main hatchway, and missing the ladder, pitched headforemost below. As the lower hatch was off,' he never stopped till ''he struck the water casks. ' Go below,- two of you, and look after him,' said'the mate, 'as coolly as if he, were asking for a coal to ligh't his' pipe with. . ' ? '. ? ? ' - '?'? ; ' The stranger wore ship, and kept away with us for another hour. '/ The Spanish captain and two of the hardiest men went below, and bent on 'to.'! the mate, for all was as quiet as death. When we hoisted him up, he was dead as a door- nail, with his faco wholly smashed and his neck broken. As he had been the cause of the whole trouble, from his neglect of duty on the coast, and the captain's trusting to him, we did_ not put ourselves out to read the sarvice, but just hoisted him, over the rail, as he lay, and sent him to Davy Jones, after tho poor creatures he, had murdered. No sooner was he, launched than the stranger came'do'wn' 'on'' usT'h'afta ''? ovefS hand— the sea boiling under his bows', like the foam of a cataract. ' ' Beat to. quarters,' said Mr. Millet, for he knew there was a drum on board. At the first tap, the screaming and howling began, as if the niggers were all back again. The men looked nt one another, and then at the strange sail, and then at the ' hatchway, till every man's eyes began to stretch as wide as an open port, and every man's hair to bristle. Themaster's mate was a trump. As I said before, he feared nothing. He swore at us for old women, arid getting the arms and amunition up, he battened down the hatches, lie next run the colours up, and pointing .to a big demijohn of brandy, he bid us drink, and defend tho brig. And sure enough we took a double swig all round,: and manning our six . twelves, three in a broadside, we. all shook hands, and swore to stand' by him1 to the last^. .In a few minutes more, the fellow ranged alongside, a single-decked ship of six hundred tons, with a long row of teeth, and the black flag at the fore. 'He took' in his flying kites very cleverly; though such a crew no mortal; man ever saw before or since in a~ship's rigging. Tho cloven-footed villains shinned up and down the backstays- like, so many Barbary apes, each fellow's tail coiled away and stoppered in his starn, and every head with its pair of horns well scraped, showing as sharp and clear in the moon-light as so many marlin' spikes. I seed a tall chap in a cocked hat, with a big speakingtrumpet in his hand, standing by her main rigging. ' ' God help us !' says I to myself, ' there's old Davy Jones himself after US.' ' -? ' . ?? : .???' 'With that, I took another, stiff swig,, and straightened taut up at my gun^'.to see the end on it. : r ; .',?:?: '?Ahoy !' what brig ? is that, pray ?' shouted a voice like1 the; deep growl | of a winter nor' wester. . ,...'. :','... ,',','j!' ' ' His Britannic Majesty's frigate Hades, prize- brig, tho' Boa d'A'gua. What ship is that ?' roars the master's mate, as bold as a lion. . . . '?. , . ; ' ?

'' ''Ay, ay!1 says I to myself, fit's him, sure enough. Here's a nice scrape for you to be in, Tom Pintle. What would your cousin, the curate, say now, if ho could see you ?' ? 'Tho officer hesitated, while tho cold sweat streamed off his face and my own, as I stood near him, at thoafter-r most gun, tbongh tho -wind felt burning hot like a blast from a fiery furnace. He was raising the trumpet to ? his lips in one hand, and motioning us1 to lie down behind tho bulwa'rks: with the with the1 other— for -her broadside / ?

'With a loud shout, we fired three guns, loaded to thp : muzzle with round and grape, slap into him; As the smoke drove to leeward, I saw a figure, half as tall as the lowermost pump, on- the' ship's taffrail, and the next moment, in tho midst of a sheet of flame, she'strnck us directly midships. .' 'Away there- !? boarders, repel boar ders,'1 snouted tho mate, leaving, the helm, and flourishing; his cutlass. ? But he had no Frenchmen,' or Dons, or Yankees either, to deal with. Old. Davy was before him. With one immense spring, ho lit on the brig's deck, followed by fifty imps, who attempted to lash his bowsprit to our main rigging. But through the dense cloud of smoke which followed the explosion of a hundred missiles, the mate fired his pistol, and giving them a close volley from our muskets, we rushed on them, pike and cutlass in hand. : : ''Hold back! you tarry-fisted fools ! you can't hurt ns, you gudgeons ?' soiil Davy, half laughing. . ' But we were crazy with brandy, and in no humour to knock under. Fol-' lowing the mate, close, ? we cut antl slashed, and- thrust dowti all before us, till the deck was cleared of all, save the head iznp 'himself. ' '? 'k ??£'.' ^^Myl'oyes^^lCliere ;; lie stood by the mainmalt/ with' 'his' 'great1 fiery eyesV; -? glaring at iisfrom' under his cocked hat grinning through tho smoke, tell we felt our joints beginning to stiffen, and the hairs on our head standing on end like fine wires. He held a red - hot boarding pike in Ms-hand, and ashe saw us recoil from him, he struck one of his great rough paws -aside his bull nose, and grinned again, till the' mainstay parted. At the moment . a ; heavy surge struck the. ship on. the counter and tore her clear of the brig. 'Tho sight restored the mate's con rage. ':'?' ??-''?? ?? ' ? '?.'_?. ' I've oftened wondered if 'Mr Millet's having boon kbpfc so-long in the back ground,' for want of influential friends, and.his never hdving commanded a craffe before, did 'not give him the heart to do the deeds '?'? he performed that night.

' ' Look out now, my lads,': says I, -and we made,pne mqro rnsb, bat the fire was too strong for ^is. \The mate's cut lass snapped in his hand as he made a heavy blow at the devil's outrigger, and then it was all up with us.
