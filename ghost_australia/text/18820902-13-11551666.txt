PICTURES OF TEA PEL. BY J. S. LAUSANNE. from Montreux to Lausanne you have the choice of proceeding by railway or steamboat and both belong to the same company, Not does the monopoly occasion high charges, for the fare by either in extremely moderate. The shores of the lake are bordered by beautiful country villas, in one of which, Monrepoa, Voltaire built a theatre for the performance of his tragedies At Ouchy, where you land for Law Banne, they show you the hotel, LAnce, in which Byron wrote his " Prisoner of Chiffon,' A short line of railway, with a steep gradient, up which you are drawn by a wire rope, connects Ouchy with the city of Lausanne, lying about 500ft above the level of the lake, and commanding, from the eminence known as the Signal station, behind it, a panorama of immense extent and remarkable variety for the point of view is 2 600ft above the water 1 the whole of the lake, from Villeneuve in the east to Nyon in the west, with the venerable city set in a framework of foliage, lies at your feet, the cathedral, with its two towers and spires, and the massive castle rising grandly from their respective hills forming a foreground To the westward spreads a slightly undulating plain, sprinkled with towns and villages that sparkle in the Jane Bnnehine, with the shores of the lake carrying into graceful little bays and jutting promos tones on one side of it, and the Jura range closing in the view on the other. To the eastward lies the vine covered hills beyond Vevey, Montreux, and Chiffon and facing you are the magnificent Alps of Savoy, with the imposing mass of Mont Blanc soaring in solitary majesty above them all Lausanne is as pleasing to the eye as it i trying to the feet. It is built upon three hills separated by what can only be called deep gorges, and its streets are paved with cobble stones, generally without footpaths, and it requires a certain amount of skill to avoid dislocating your ankles as you plod your way wearily up and down its sleep inclines In some instances, however in passing from the cathedral terrace to the streets below you descend by several flights of steps, numbering 180 in all, roofed in, and with landing places, upon which wheezy old folks who may be climbing upon their way to their devotions may pause and take breath The cathedral itself, which is in process of restoration by M Viollet le Duc, the well known French architect, is a cruciform structure, of fine proportions, bat terribly bare and cold inside It contains a fine rose window, filled with J stained glass of antique workmanship, repre Boating the san (under the figure of a young man), the moon, the four seasons the rivers of Paradise, and Christ in company with John the Baptist The high altar, which once blazed with gold and jewellery, has been replaced by the plainest of communion tables, but the carved stalls of the canons have for innately escaped the destroying hands of the iconoclasts at the Reformation Close by, and dominating the whole city, in the episcopal chateau, which was at once a castle and a palace, and is now the seat of government of the canton Grouped together in its immediate vicinity are the academy the college and some museums of the fine arts and of natural history Two of the hills upon which Lausanne is built are united by a massive bridge (500ft long and 30ft high, and the city is encircled by a boulevard, which in one place is carried through a tunnel, and in others spans pretty deep ravines by means of lofty arches, so as to knit the three eminences together in the middle ages it was a cluster of independent communes, each with its own magistrates, its own flag, its own laws, and its own privileges One of these communes was composed of ecclesiastics exclusively, and its tribunals decided everything according to canon law. This was called the "city par excellence, and the priests, as well as the pilgrims who came to visit the relics preserved in the cathedral, led Such dissolute lives that the place became an abominable Japanese, and by its depravity precipitated the Reformation The Bourg, founded by people of Germanic origin, was an aristocratic community, owning estates in the Pays deMand, and administering justice in the Grande Cour Scullers To this j day it continues to be the patrician quarter of LORanne, bat its inhabitants exercise very little influence in political affairs Three other communes composed of working people, Bar wants, and traders respectively-occupied the lower quarters of the district and were each self governed Eventually, however, these five bodies coalesced for the defence of their common rights, and became a single comma city Gibbon, the historian, spent a considerable portion of his life at Lausanne, and has told us in his autobiography the emotions which he experienced in walking up and down a certain avenue after the completion of his great work The modest house he occupied has been replaced by an hotel which bears his name Lausanne has produced a few distinguished landscape painters, who have generally emigrated to other countries , and our own gallery in Melbourne contains pictures by painters-MM Chevalier and Buvelot both of whom, I think, are connected with this part of Switzerland GENEVA After the quaintness and quietude of Lau course, with its old world air and its need are val associations, the city of Geneva, as you approach it from the lake, comes upon you With a feeling of surprise, Its aspect is BO grandiose, BO modern, and so Parisian withal Where the Rhone issues from the inland sea into which it poured its chalky waters at Le Bourget to emerge from it purple and transparent, the broad and rushing river is spanned by a noble bridge of 12 arches, and IB flanked and walled by two wide spreading quays, that on the left bank being planted with trees, while that on the right opens out, in one place, on to the fine square called the Jardin des Alpes, in the midst of which rises the sumptuous monument erected by the Genevese, on the model of that of the Can Grande, at Verona, to the memory of the Duke of Brunswick, who bequeathed the city about a million sterling Each of these quays, stretching away in afar perspective, as well as the square itself, is bordered by substantial looking and uniformly erected houses, for the most part seven stories high and behind these are the older portions of the city, occupying higher ground and closely packed together, with the two towers of the cathedral lifting them selves above a mass of ancient roofs and tiled turrets Immediately in front of you, beyond the bridge, on an island in the middle of the Rhone, ia Pradier s fine statute of Rousseau, in a sitting posture To the right the dark masses of the Jura mountains are visible, and to the left the Voirons, the Joraasea, the Mole, the Great and Little Sallie, and the augUst outline of Mont Blanc, sharply defined against the azure of the sky. This is the feature of the scene, and its permanent fascination It is always arresting your attention It compels you to look a it, and insists upon your homage In the morning it is spectral and cloud like At noon its profile presents a startling resemblance to that of grey, discrowned old Lear, lying dead, with a deep shadow where the eye has sunk, and other Shadows in the hollows of his cheek and at the nostril, with his white hair flowing in disorder backward from his forehead, and his long beard sweeping over the robe which covers his breast At sunset the mountain is flushed with an orange glow which subsides into a pale rose pink, and in the twilight you watch its gradations of pallid colour until it seems to have swooned away in space, and made itself air, like the witches in " Macbeth " But at any hour, and under every aspect, it is a sublime spectacle, and there is something solemnly impressive in the immutability of its stain- less snows, and in the majestic serenity with which it looks down upon the lower giants by which it is environed. At first the city of Geneva, with its wide thoroughfares in the newer quarters of the place, and the comparatively small number of vehicles and of of passengers to be met with in them, gives you the idea that it is altogether too large and spacious for its population. But its trade is to a considerable extent an export trade, and its working classes are out of eight all day in the numerous manufactories of clocks and watches, musical boxes, marqueterie and parquette, jewellery, and the other articles for which Geneva is famous the display of these, and of the ivory and wood carvings for which the city is equally celebrated, in the shop windows, rendering a walk through its business quarters a most agree- able occupation for the stranger, All such " vanities ' were proscribed in the day of John Calvin and we have another example of the irony of fate in the fact that the municipality of Geneva has just expended nearly six millions of francs in the erection of one of the hand comedy theatres in Europe in a place where no dramatic performances were formerly permitted that the Genevese Sabbath resembles pretty closely a Parisian Sunday, that at every large cafe along the quays there is vocal and instrumental music on each evening in the week, and that what was once the citadel of Presbyterian orthodoxy is to day the head quarters of a propaganda of free thinking Speaking of this part of Switzerland Voltaire was accustomed to Bay, " When I shake my wig I powder the whole republic The canton of Geneva is only 15 miles square, and yet what an important part it has played in the religious, political, literary, and scientific history of Europe ' A mere "cabbage garden, it has been prolific of illustrious men It gave birth to Catt in, Rousseau, Sismondi, Bomvardj Delolme, Dumont Mallet du Pan, Benjamin Constant Necker and his daughter, Charles Bonnet De Luxe, De Saussure, the Ilubers, De Candolle, Boissier, De la Rive, Pictet, Merle d Aubignc, Toppfer, Madame de Gasperi Monmcr Cherbultcz, Calame, Pradier, Jean Petitot, Liotard, andHomung , each of whom achieved eminence in some department of in effectual effort And if the size of the skull be any criterion of mental capacity Geneva ought to produce a plentiful crop of men and women of conspicuous ability in the coming years for I never saw so many large and unusually well shaped heads among the same number of children as I saw in the primary schools and the Kindergartens of Geneva, to which, as well as to the other public institutions of the city, I was favoured with orders of admission by the courtesy of the president of the municipality With none of the illustrious men of the last century more particularly, is Geneva more inseparably associated than with Voltaire and Rousseau, while it must not be forgotten that it was here, under a regime of freedom for the press, that Montesquieu s Esprit des Lois was first given to the world As to the author of smile and of the Central Social, it may be remarked that both works were publicly condemned, and one of them burnt by the common hangman, little more than a hundred years ago, and that to day the city of Geneva has affixed a tablet to the front of the house in which he was born that a picture representing him entering his father's workshop adorns one of the rooms in the Hotel de Ville, and that his statue has been placed-as I have said-on an island which bears his name at the outfall of the Rhone It cannot be asserted of Voltaire that he was enamoured of the people or the institution of Geneva. He admired its attack ment to the principles of civil and religious liberty, and the activity and freedom of in scientific investigations , but he had no sympathy with its republican spirit, with its religious sentiments, and with the habits of frugality and simplicity which characterised the people of Switzerland at this epoch He was fond of the elegancies of life, are luxuries, its gallantries, and of the more refined of its vices, and he attacked his neighbours in his Guerry de Geneve, and in other caustic brochures, with a cynical bitter- ness and a mordant sarcasm, which must have wounded the objects of his antipathy very acutely He ridiculed the austerity of their principles, and mocked at the strait lacednesB of their practice, and when he had succeeded in procuring the re estate Iiebment of theatrical entertainments in Geneva, his gratification expressed itself in this wise -" They are resorting in crowds to the theatre The city of Calvin is becoming a city of pleasure and of toleration I am corrupting the youth of this pedantic place I am creating enjoyments , the preachers are enraged, and I crush them On another occasion he spoke of Geneva as " a republic of 24,000 reasoners-a ridiculous, petty, paltry, and Excessively pedanlicpétandiere -the last phrase being without an English equivalent, as it is used to signify the court of King Island, in which everybody was master Was it by accident, or design, I wonder, that in selecting Terney-or Ferne, as it is locally spelt-for his place of residence he took care that the city of Geneva should be completely excluded from the prospect' Whatever may be the opinion one entertains of Voltaire s character and principles and both were, in many respects, con temptible his genius made him a great power in the history and literature of France, and to visit Geneva without a pilgrimage to 1 effect would be a serious oversight Accordingly I proceeded thither, by omnibus, along a road which might have been mistaken for a highway in one of the English counties, bordered as it was for some distance out of Geneva by hedgerows, in which the familiar hazelnut and blackberry intermingled with the elderberry, the wild cle mates, the dog-rose, and the hop, while the oak and the elm combined with the walnut and the cluster to weave a green roof over head There were stately avenues leading up to substantial mansions, solidly established in the midst of goodly shrubberies and fair demesne and there were the greenest of meadows, in which broad swathes of succulent grass were falling before the measured sweep of the mowers scythe There were orchards, in which the fruit trees were old and mossy, and farm houses which must have been venerable when Voltaire passed up and down this road on his way to the city which he satirised Ternex itself is an old fashioned, staid, quiet, and respectable village, or perhaps it aspires to the designation of a small town, with a Cafe de Voltaire and a Hotel de Voltaire, and a fountain surmounted by a bronze bust of the philosopher, with a mocking smile upon his face, and an inscription setting forth that it was Offers par Claude Pierre David en memoire de Centenaire de Voltaire, 1876 I noticed also that at the office of the Justice de Paix a daily telegram is posted, stating what is the weather in various parts of Switzerland, and what are the probabilities for the next four and twenty courses kind of information extremely serviceable to people who are engaged for the most part in the cultivation of the land, Passing through the village, you turn to the left up a beautiful avenue of ash and elm and chestnut, where the nightingale is making the whole neighbourhood ring with its lovely melodies, and where you hear the sound of the scythe in the long lush grass, and scent the odour of bean fields, and then you come upon a gentle eminence, on the left hand side of which stands the little church, no larger than an ordinary chapel in a bush township, which was built by Voltaire for the accommodation of his labourers and domestics Its drama tive facade is surmounted by a small clock turret, under which is a stone tablet, with the inscription, " Deo erects Voltaire, 1761 " Close by, and separated from the green plot in front of the church by an iron grille, is the chateau, built somewhat in the style of the country houses in England that were erected in the reign of Queen Anne. Some of the rooms are pretty much as they were when Voltaire left them ; as, for example his bedroom and its antechamber, and there is a curious collection of portraits, comprising the Empress Catherine of Russia, and the philosopher's washerwoman, his sweep, and Frederick the Great of Prussia, his own like nets, and that of Madame du Chatelet As might be imagined, the chateau is fall of ghosts At least you cannot help calling up a whole crowd of phantoms, and repealing the place with the shadowy figures of the actors and actresses, the wits and philosopher the handsome women and accomplished men, and the literary, artistic, political, and social celebrities who used to resort to Ternex when Le Roi Voltaire held his court there, and when, as Madame d Epinay wrote to Grimm,-"Cette maison start he refuge de 1' assemblage des continues, at an spectacle charmant pour les spectators ' I wonder whether they ever turned their eyes, when they were pacing up and down the terrace on the south side of the house, to the magnificent panorama which unrolled itself for their admiration in that direction , or whether, like St Bernard on the shores of the Lake of Geneva, they were altogether union BciouB of its existence It is impossible to suppose that Voltaire was BO, when he chose such a lovely spot for his residence in the foreground is a ter raced garden, overlooking a vineyard, sloping down to a green lane, and beyond it is a valley, where the russet brown roofs of Ternex are partly hidden by the thick fob age of the orchard trees An undulating ridge of lightly timbered fields, interspersed with country houses, shrubberies, and pleasure grounds, completely hides from view the city of Geneva And over all these tower the stupendous glaciers and icy pinnacles of Mont Blanc, with grand Alpine peaks and pinnacles shelving away to the right and left, and tier upon tier of white clouds drifting above or below their doz sling summits The chateau is sheltered from the cold winds that blow down from the Jura in the winter months by thickets of forest trees which have reached almost gigantic dimensions These are intersected by noble avenues and separate the extensive kitchen gardens of the mansion from the farm house, which encloses three sides of a spacious quadrangle and covers more ground than the residence itself Altogether, the philosopher must have lived in grand seigneur at Eernex, and all his surroundings appear to have been well calculated to render additionally attractive a visit to the man whom his admirers agreed in characterising as 1 homme le plus sediment le plus agreable, et le plus celebre de Europe About eight miles from Geneva, on the north west bank of what is called Le Petit Late, lies the small town of Copper, in which is the chateau now belonging to the De Broglie, but formerly the residence of Necker, and of his more celebrated daughter, Madame de Stael, both of whom are buried in the grounds of the mansion More for tunate than many of his contemporaries, the TiDonce Minister of Louis XVI was enabled to retire from the country he had suffer tually endeavoured to prevent falling into a bottomless abyss of disaster, before the outbreak of the storm which overwhelmed the monarchy and society of France in one common ruin Hewitnessedfromhisretreatat Copper the great cataclysm, which he had been powerless to avert, and here, in 1862, when the French people were submitting not merely with complacency, but with a joyful alacrity, to a military despotism, he wrote his Bernales Vues de Politique et de Finance in which he vindicated those principles of free dom that were being trodden under foot in France by the a devant lieutenant of artillery Here, too, when exiled from Paris, to which she was as fondly attached as Dr. Johnson was to London, Madame de Stael, feared and hated by Napoleon, sighed for the gutters of the Rue du Bac, but gained in intellectual strength and vigour by those habits of meditation and study which were almost forced upon her in the comparative seclusion of the country Here she enjoyed the friend- ship of Benjamin Constant, Schlegel, Bon stetten, and SiBmondi, and here she indulged in those dreams of remodelling the French character, and of infusing into it the dignity, the sentiment of duty, the freedom of thought, and the habits of reflection which she admired in the English dreams as impracticable in their realisation as they were generous and enthusiastic in their concep- tion. Let us return, however, to Geneva, as the Betting Ban in lighting up the alternate bands of vegetation and of bare rock on the Great and Little Salve with an orange glory, and the stupendous mass of Mont Blanc is tinged with something between a pale pink and a delicate salmon colour, and the Mole is clothed with a soft haze, and Les Voirons and the two peaks of the Jovasae seem touched with flame, and as the light of the declining luminary climbs silently up the nearer and lower ranges, and eventually disappears, while the monarch of the Alps takes on a brighter lustre, and resembles an enormous topaz roughly cut and set in a shield of turquoise In the evening the city looks its beat The cases are brilliantly illuminated, and so is the Jardin Anglais, where an al are to concert is taking place. The lamps which fringe the quays and margin the numerous bridges that traverse the swirling Rhone ore reflected in its purple waters Throngs of people are listening to the various companies of musicians stationed in fronted the cafes, boats with lanterns in their prows are flitting across the surface of the river, and the whole scene is such as to suggest that Geneva must been felt, although in reality it only wears the aspect which it assumes every summer evening when the twilight begins to fade away. Most of the public edifices of the city are grouped together in its newer quarter, near the Botanical gardens and the Promenade des Bastions The theatre, the Atheneum, the Public Library, containing 09,000 volumes, the Conservatory of MUsIC, the Academic Museum, and the Rath Museum are thus situated The last named institution was the bequest to the city of General Rath, and possesses several noble landscapes by Madame, Humbert, Diday, Duval, and others Those of Calais are especially fine A group of oak trees of exuberant deadness, in the middle of a field of ripe wheat, with a warm autumnal sky behind, an atmosphere so charged with sunshine and vapoury heat, and a group of reapers resting in the soft shadow of the over arching boughs, betrays the hand of a master in every line So does an Alpine tempest from the same pencil In the fore ground is a grove of pines, writhing and groaning under the vigorous compulsion of a fierce wind that comes howling and shrieking down from rugged heights that are partly veiled by dark clouds, BO torn and riven in places by the angry violence of the ice cold such as to admit of the passage of gleams and glints of land sunlight, which brighten the foaming surface of a torrent that is impetuously forcing its way through the broken foreground An Italian landscape is in striking contrast with the last named composition, and shows that the artist was not incapable of competing with Claude upon his own ground. Its brilliancy of atmosphere and luminous qualities generally are very remarkable An autumnal sunset and a snow scene, by Calame, show that his versatility was as great as his ability and that he was qualified to interpret nature in not one but many of her multiform aspects A lake occupies the centre of the picture in the former, and the sun is about to dip behind a range of mountains in the background in front, through an opening in a forest of beech and larch trees, some pencils of golden light fall with a subdued splendour upon the stems and branches of the trees, and upon the rocky fore ground. In the sHOW scene, an Alpine valley is illuminated by the full moon, which is just emerging from a cloud, and pouring a flood of soft radiance upon the white weird land scope. It may be said of each of Calame's pictures that it is a genuine poem ; epic in its strength, and lyric in its sweetness He was an indefatigable student of nature In the summer months he was accustomed to spend the whole day, from sunrise to sunset, in the midst of Alpine solitudes, labouring at his easel with in aBsent industry. Enamoured f ! in art, he neglected his meals and denied Inn self the necessary hours of sleep, and the result was that he had exhausted his Bto k of vital force by the time he had reached the grand climacteric, and died a martyr to his devotion, at the age of fifty four His works make you feel that you stand in the presence of thej-chiovements of one whom Nature had rewarded for his loyal worship of bet by revealing to him the secrets of her majesty and loveliness and that Calame combined the exercise of the utmost conscientiousness with an unusually complete and comprehensive knowledge of the technical resources of his art as a landscape pan ter Among the educational institutions of Geneva special mention deserves to be made of Ecole d Horlogerie established by the municipality of the city for the purpose of giving instruction, both scientific and prac Heal, in the art of watchmaking, so as to maintain and increase the prosperity and repute of the staple industry of the place. The school is placed under the direction of the Administrative Council of Geneva assisted by a Consultative Commission noon nated by itself The theoretical course of instruction embraces the French language arithmetic bookkeeping linear and industrial drawing, geometry, algebra, physics chemistry, mechanics demography, astronomy, and boroloRery while the practical teaching comprehends three sections the first elementary, in which students are taught to make watches of the simplest construction, the second more advanced and the third comprising the fabrication of the best and most expensive kinds of timepieces Laen course of instruction is obligatory upon all persons entering the school To be qualified torture they must be Years of age and must have passed an examination equivalent to that of the highest degree in the primary schools of Geneva The fees are five francs a month for SWISS students, and 25 for foreigners, and adult workmen are admissible on similar conditions The tools necea sat for an apprentice as well as a bench to work at are furnished at the expense of the municipality and the former become the property of the student when he has creditably passed through all his classes Every year competitive examinations take place at which the work performed is adjudicated upon by juries of experts and certificates or diplomas are awarded, as well as prizes for good workmanship Be fire receiving a diploma a competitor must have obtained at least the moiety of the coefficient maximum 10 in all the branches of instruction as well as for good conduct The annual examination was appointed to take place on the day following my visit and the director of the institution kindly showed me some of the best of the watches sent in for concurrence and I pointed out the delicacy and high finish of their workmanship Each class is under the direction of a special master, the hours of instruction commencing between 7 and 8 in the morning, and terminating at 7 in the evening, with an interval of an hour and a half in the middle of the day, for dinner For the complete course of tuition a period of three years is required at the expiration of which time the student is usually qualified to undertake the most in portant work that can be assigned to him in a watch manufactory Some of these establishments, as, for example, that of J M Baddeley and Co. , which carried on first class honours at Philadelphia Vienna, and Paris employ a good many women and girls and, as I had an opportunity of ob seen g, their lightness and delicacy of touch IS peculiarly well adapted for the Once details in the fabrication of those watches more especially, which are so small as to enable them to be worn in rings lockets and other articles of feminine adornment
