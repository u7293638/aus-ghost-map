The panel devoted to the purposes of play bore the portrait of a beautiful woman : time and injury bad obscurod its excellence, but not destroyed it. ' For a moment young Hyacinth stood with the pictur* an his hands, and then pressing it to his lips, and team gushing from his eyes, he exclaimed, ' Mother, dear mother 1' and fell like n. drunken man upon his chair. , '.Mother!' criod Peppercorn, with a hoarse scream, and then ho looked liko a thiof caught in the fact.

'Well, if I'd have known as much, I'd havo never talked such stuff to you about the ghosts,' said Flitter roouse. 'Only, you see, it's our duty to spread such storica to keep tenants from tho houses.
