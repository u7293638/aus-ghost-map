The Sin of Omission. It isn't the thing you do, dear, It's the thing you leave undone Which gives you a bit of heartache At the setting of the Bun ; The tender word forgotten, The letter you did not write, The flower you might have sent, dear, Are your haunting ghosts to-night. The stone you might have lifted Out of the brother's way, The bit of beartsome counsel You were hurried too much to say. The loving touch of the hati , dear, The gentle and winsome tone That jou had no time nor thought for, With troubles enough of your own. These little acts of kindness, So easily out of mind, These chances to be angels Which even mortals find— They come in night and silence Each mild reproachful wraith, When hope is faint and flagging, And a blight has dropped on faith. For life is all too.sbort, dear, And sorrow is all too great, To suffer our slow compassion That tarries until too late. And it's not the thing you do, dear, It's the thing you leave undone, Which gives you the bitter heartache, At the setting of the sun. —Margaret E. Sangslcr.
