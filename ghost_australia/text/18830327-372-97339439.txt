Clahe v. Northern Ahkas Ciiickbting Association. On Saturday, the 24th inst., a match was played oa the local oval between the Glare club and the Northern Areas Cricketing Association. The Association waa poorly represented, as most of the players were from ^amfistown. Tha nistoh txrnn mun. nienced at 10 o'clock. Rebbeck, the cap tain of the Assoaiation won the toss, but he elected to take the field. Bright sent in Davies and Filgate on a good wicket to start the batting for Clare, opposing the bowling of Evans and Foster. Both bowlers sent down a maiden each, and in the former's second over Davies started the scoring by hitting him to the chains for 4. After a few more overs Davies had the misfortune to play a ball on to his wicket, and he re tired with 12. MeFarlane joined Filo-ate, when a long stand was made, but the scoring was slow, as the bowling at this time was on the spot. When the score was taken from 25 to 51 MeFarlane was beaten by Foster. The outgoing batsman played a good innings for his 17. Bright was got very cbeap, as he only made 6 when Erans scattered his stumps. Three for 71. Maslin went nest to Iiare a look at Filgate, v-ho was playing & fiue defensive game, when a good deal of stonewalling was indulged in by Maslin. The century was hoisted before Maelin was bowled for a well-earned 20. While Maslia was making his score Filgate in the meantime had placed over 60 runs to his credit. An'adjournment was then made for lunch, the score standing at 139 for 4 wickets, Filgate being not out with 93. After the inner man had been attended to G. Harder went in with Filgate, and the latter eoon reached the long- looked-for century amidst loud applause. Harder did not remain long at the wickets, as he was bowled by a trimmer from Parks, a Caltowie bowler, for 6. Mortimer entered into partnership with Filgate, and both batsmen scored at a rapid rate, especially the former. The second century was soon placed on the board. Mortimer played rattling cricket for his 34, and was beginning to make things very lively for the field when he was bowled by Evans. Filgate all this time had treated the spectators to a grand display of cricket. Wilkinson only added 6. When C. A. Harder took his stand at the wickets the score stood at 238, and 7 men out. Harder was not so quick in getting to work, but when set he was not behindhand in laying on at both ends. Filgate and Harder took the score from 238 to 297, or an increase of 59, when the former was at last bowled by Foster for the splendid total of 165. He was at the wickets for about four hours, and it was the grandest batting performance that has ever been seen on the Ciare Oval. His total comprised no less than 20 chain hits, and only one chance was given in the slips. This is the second time this season that Filgate has scored the century. J. Walsh came next, and with Harder took the score to 337, when the former played a ball on to his wicket, and had to retire with 9. Eames, tbe last man, joined Harder, when a most determined stand was made, Harder doing all the scoring. A burst of applause soon announced that the latter had scored another century. Haider followed his century up by driving the Caltowie bowler along the carpet five times for five fours, thus scoring 20 in one over, and then Eames was caught. Harder re mained not out with 120, a most astonish ing performance for so young a player. His total consisted of 17 chain hits, and he never gave a ghost of a chance. His innings was considered superior to that of Filgate's, as he played with more freedom and kept the ball well on the ground. The innings closed at half-past 4 for the grand total of 403 runs, the largest score that has ever been made in this colony. It is only fair to state that Harder went in ninth man, and that the last wicket put on 66 runs. The fielding of the visitors was very good, as only 4 extras were scored. Evans took 4 wickets for 90 ruus, Williams 2 for 28, Parks 2 for 54, and Foster 2 for 115 ; and altogether 627 balls were bowled. The Association commenced their innings by sending in Berry and Sendey, McFarlane and Mortimer bowling. In the latter'a first over Berry was splendidly caught by C. A.. Harder at point. The same fieldsman also caught Parks low down off Bright's bowl ing. Williams and Parks were the only batsmen who reached double figures, and they played well for their respective scores of 15 and 11. Rebbeck and Sendey made 7 each. When time was called 8 wickets were down for 58 runs, the match ending in a draw greatly in favor of the Clares. Mor timer took 5 wickets for 34 runs, McFarlane 2 for 10, and Bright 1 for 5. During the match Sendey (Association), Mortimer and Eames (Clare) were slightly injured. It must not be forgotten to mention that Filgate is to be the recipent of several pre sents for his batting performance, viz., a bat given by Mr. T. R. Bright, the captain of the club, a complete suit of cricketing clothes given by Mr. W. Richardson, and a pair of pads given by Mr. G. E. Maslin. Mr. Bright has also promised a bat to C. A. Harder.
