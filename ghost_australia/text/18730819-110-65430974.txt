M IS P INT 5. (Concluded.) Foreign editions of English books abound in misprints, though very frequently they are not ucre errors of the press, but arise from editorial miscocepltion of the real meaniug. I have a small pocket edition of Childo Harold, published by. Campo. of Noiomberg, in whiich occur the following variorum readings. In canto three; astanz ei'lity-two, are these lines : They nmdo themselves a fearful monument - The wreck of old opinions- things which grew, Breathed fronm the breath of time.: Fearful is printed frightful, and breath t ird.: Again, in statne ono hundred and eighty-one, canto four, ahere the poet, apos troplhisiilg the ocean, says of the oak levia thans that sail on it, "These are thy toys" -for this last word the Geanmu printer substituted tops, by which, I confess I was at first rather puzzled, until it struck me that whip-tops or peg-tops, must haveo been in his mind's eye when he thouglt of ships becoming the sport of wi'l and" ware. Before Byron is dismissed, Lmust speak of one of thle strangest misprints that, perhaps, has ever occurred; for it was committed without being discovered by the author- sensitive as we know he was-or by the pub lic who have, for years, admiringly quoted the iiues. The stcanza which follows the one last cited runs thus : Thy shores are empires, chang'd in all save thee Assyria, Groece, Rome, Carthage, what are they ? Thy waters wasted thoem when they were free, And many a tyrant si?ce?- . . A skilful critic was, w?ry recently, reading this passage, and whlo hl came- to "Thy waters wasted them," he paused, Wasted what Whee.r is iton record that the Mediterranean sea has wasted the shorea that surround it I What part of the 'coast -European,ca Asiatic or African--has been overwhelmhned by the tide, and then left de solate . The ruins of Tyro are still a -land. mark; the rocks of Salamis still' overlooks the wave; the site of Carthage remains. Tyrants may have wasted those shores, but thowaters nevenr There must, then, be some mistake, Could the critic have access to the origisal manuscript ? It was produced arid examined ; and, as muelcto the surprise of all present as, I dare say, it will be to the public, the fau ty line ran thus: Thy waters washed them power when they were free, and many a tyrant since. The MS, of another of Byron's poems rec tifies a misprint which has oun allowed to pass current in all the hitherto published editions of his works. It occurs in the Prisoner of Chillon : And thus together, yet apart, Fetter'd in hand, but pin 'd in heart- For pit'd, read join'd, which completes the antithesis An author may. sometimes be indebted for an idea to his printer. The story that is told of Malherbe is acase in point. In his celebrated epistle to Da Perrier,: whose daughter's name was Rosette, he had writ ten :-" Et Rosette a .vcu con co que vivent los roses." ("And Rosette, has "lired as the rossa live:") But the printer, who foundthe MS. difficult to read, put Reoselle instead of Rosette. Malherbe reading the proof, was struck by the change,:and modified hisversoe as follows :-" Et Rose elle a v6cu co que vivent les roses." (" And a- Rose, she has lived as the roses live.'?) The comparison to the rose in the first. iustance adds greatly to the beauty of the image.o l ?isprinted dates occur very often, and sometimes cause consid rable confusion in the reader's mind. In the aInst number of the Quarterly Review, in a review yery. ad mirably written, of the account of Corsica, by Grororovios, mention is made of Sam piero, the famous Corsican Condottiero. lie was, says the reviewer, " born A.D. 1498 at Bastelica, a village . in ,the mountains near Aiaccio." After speoe ing of his military services in Italy, he adds :-" While thus acquiring distinction in foreiln countries, -ho was not unmindful of his own. Ho returned home in 1597, and his reputation as a soldier sup plying the place of titles and aucestry, won for-him a noble brido-Vannina, dau.hter and heiress of Francis Ornano, a principal 5 noble of the island." Vannies must have had a sinigular taste to select for her bride groom a gentleman of the mature age of ninety-nine. I must observe that there is n1othinig icn the context which helps one to Saftix the right date, though it is afterwards said that he died in fifteen hundred and sixty seven, exactly thirty years before he mar ried his bloomnui bride, whom, inthe mean ,pt?v? make people do strange things after their deaths. In a review:which I saw late a ly in-a weekly paper, reference is made to a very pleasant letter. from Swift to Arbuth eot, giving an excellent account of the mode of life of the former. It is dated (by the g printer) on or about 1773," from which it I would appear that it was -written by.the ghost of Swift to the ghost of Arbuthnot, the former - having died. in seventee i' hundred and; forty-fl - and the latter in seventeen hundred and thirty-throo. o0 What makes this misprint the more, abiurd '' is, that the letter coinsis's chiefly. of details ii respecting cating and drinking' aud the cheapness of livin:--nt in the other world, but in Ireland. The Ililder, a weeks since, or the Globe quoting the paragraph, - oave that what Raffaello dcld in his "brief lifo" was "marvellous." cSo -it was, but thee IRaffacllo- did not voe, as the paragraph a" stated, to be fifty-so:en years of aego Hero e it is easy to rectif the error, the words be bing in figures, awI a five inserted in the place of a throo. lint it only shows holw careful you shotd bh in, your comments a' when your pri?ers are. apt to stumblo. t Apropos of tire (nolo, the following passag. appeared in its.mprososiol of January, the oeighteoetlh uli:-e " lOar prittor yesterday oontmlithed a siOUS ,rror hn givn otUÂ·r ex.Y tract from, tl' legistrar;O enorJas return SIeemakes cussoy that tito ilnhahitaents of SLo idou c uffoaf t prmosnt.frols a high rate of -morality.
