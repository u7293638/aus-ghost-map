LITERARY COLLABORATION. In the February number of the New Review, Mr Walter Besant lays down some counsels of perfection for the guidance of novelists who write, or think they would like to write, in collaboration He declines to tell us his own relations with the late Mr Rice , but he sets out with a little personal experience - In the autumn of 1889 (he writes) I was requested by Wilkie Collins, then in his last illness, to complete his novel called " Blind Love " I was at the time in Yorkshire, and could not talk over the work with him, and, besides, he was himself too ill for the mental effort of discussion He, therefore, sent me proofs of the part already completed, and a detailed scenario of the rent Understand, therefore, that I was only in part collaborator, because the story was complete in notes, construction, character, and even fragments of dialogue, without any assistance of mine All was done but the writing My chief duty, therefore, was, if possible, to carry on the story to the end without any obvious break in the style Now, had I revealed, on the publication of the book, the exact place where one hand ended and the other began, there would have been a chance much too good to be lost-for the sagacious critic to point out the deplorable effect produced by the difference in style He could not have resisted the temptation he would have laid his unerring finger upon that spot, he would have called attention to the obvious change of style, beginning there he would have insisted on the injury done to the book by this change Therefore, knowing what would happen were I to fall into any trap, I was careful in the preface to avoid any indication of the spot where this deplorable break, or this juncture called occurred, and I only observed that doubtless the sagacious critic would really find out the place for himself No sagacious critic accepted the invitation , no one even attempted to lay his finger on the place One, a lady, pointed out to me privately certain small indications of my handi- work towards the end of the book, but she could not discover the place where Wilkie Collins ended This, then, was a case, I submit, in which the manner and method of collaboration were known, and yet the writing did not suggest-at all events, immediately so as to offend the reader-another hand it it did, no critic said so And if any action had Bald BO, I should have invited him to point out where the foreign element came in The two partners may take turn about, if they please, in revising, or even in writing (Mr Besant thinks) A true literary p partnership is quite consistent with such an arrangement of the work. The presentment of the story must seem to be by one man No one would listen to two men telling it together We must hear-or think we hear one Y once Therefore one man must finally rev two, or even worse , the whole work Now this is the rock on which many literary partnerships got wrecked and love's labour is lost The partners conceive that each must write as much as the other For instance, there was sent to me the other day a MS novel written in partnership, with the usualrequesttbatl would read itandgivoan opinion on it, in other words, that I would sacrifice two whole days to the task of making two lifelong enemies The authors of this work (which has not yet seen the light) had carefully arranged their table and their characters But, unfortunately, they proceeded to make the great mistake of writing it in alternate chapters Now, the style of one was not in the least like the style of the other , the effect was that of two men taking turns to tell the same story, each in his own way and from his own point of view Nothing could have been more grotesque, nothing more ineffec- tive Every one of the characters talked with two voices and two brains, and had two fates The thing was a horrid nightmare Consider the work before a partnership engaged upon a novel One of the two must contribute the leading motif of the work Here we hav e the infant It is not possible for a child to have two mothers, but a child may be watched, trained, educated, and moulded by two women For r single child with two nurses substitute a group with two directors The first idea suggests leading situations , those suggest characters, these again other characters In the discussion concerning these it is obvious that there must be many divergencies into paths perilous, many turnings back, many experiments, many failures, many happy discoveries, many shocks, before the whole is concluded Surely, when two minds are engaged in producing this result, both may be called partners in the work But there is much more When the scenario is finally arranged consider what each partner may further put into the work Nothing can be got out of a work of art except what has been put into it. It will be the function of each to contribute all be can, without stint, of knowledge, of recollection, of experience, of fancy, of suggestion If he has travelled, his travels furnish a mine of observation, if he has gone about among men, and travelled with his ears and eyes open to mark, learn, and inwardly digest, he has all that experience , he has, perhaps, read thousands of books, he has, perhaps, known many strange characters, he has had experiences, adventures, follies , he has heard the midnight bells, he has feasted and aroused he knows what we sadly call the fleeting joys , he has loved, and been loved If he throws into the work all the harvest of his life, shall he not be called a partner ? Novelists are always being accused of stealing plots and characters A man once called upon me to remonstrate tearfully with me on my custom, which, he said, I could not deny, of stealing his ideas by means of hypnotism I have also received dozens of proposals from persons wishing to enter into partnership with me One man offers a magnificent plot on the trifling condition that his name shall appear on the title-page as collaborator It is difficult to make this person understand that much more than a plot must be expected of a partner Another sends a bulky MS If I will only refuse it and put his name with mine on the title-page It is at my son ice That man cannot understand that the work of an editor is not the work of collaboration A third simply puts himself, his genius, his experience, his reputation-all-at my service in return for literary partnership That man cannot understand that one would as soon offer to marry a girl met once at an evening party perhaps never met at all-as to take into partnership a complete stranger The ghost (Mr Besant finds) is becoming quite an institution in these days In confidential talks with persons " down below," in the lower walks of literature, one lights upon the ghost in a very surprising manner The ghost himself, to keep up the pretence, calls it conducted research or making notes Sometimes he keeps absolute silence on the subject In reality he does the whole work and his employer puts his name to it. One such employer one such ghost-I heard of the other day The ghost was a young lady, clever and unknown She conducted the research for her employer and gave him her " notes," which subsequently appeared in a magazine just as she had sent it in, with his name, and no other alteration or addition at all, and a very creditable piece of work it was Ambition tempts men to fall into the abyss of engaging the services of the ghost Poverty tempts other men and women to enact this spectral part Mr Besant ends up with a sly bit of wicked- ness -There is one kind of collaboration which may be recommended very strongly to every young literary workman I would advise him to find among his friends cousins, sister's friends a girl, intelligent, sympathetic, and quick a girl who would lend him her ear, baton to his plot, and discuss his characters Perhaps he would like to get engaged to her-that is a detail If he does it might not injure the collaboration She would be a girl of quick imagination who does not, or cannot, write , there are still happily, many such girls When he has confided to her his cha- rioters all in the rough, with the part they have to play all in the rough, he may reckon on pro Bently getting them back again, but advanced much less in the rough Woman does not create, but she receives, moulds, develops The figures will go back to their creator distinct and clear no longer shivering unclothed, but made up and dressed for the stage Merely by talking with this girl everything that was chaotic falls into order , the characters, which were dim and shape less, become alive, full-grown, articulate "VARIETY IS THE SPICE OF LIFE "-Readers of the Echo will see that NEW FEATURES are being constantly introduced Its columns contain letterpress to suit all class- and denominations of the community no efforts being spared to render the Echo the MOST.
