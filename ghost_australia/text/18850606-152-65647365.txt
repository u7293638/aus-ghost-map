I think it's ridic'ons for., owld women to fix theamsels,out like yoong wenches. .I like to see the quality dress up, but it's inot allays the gran' eot as go the gayest I remember, in England, the firsti time the Queen ' coon' to Chatsworth ftaiershb wasoe married. The Duke'ad an eye on the Qoeen when she was youong, an' she coom there; an' for five.or six weeks before, all the entry was givin' the 'owld women round about 'o petticoats an' new shoes, so's they should "'.k nice for the Queen tosee. I'ad a sisterin rvice at Chatsworth, an' so we went over there m. where we lived in'lancashirae I'mIrish "+, you know,. but we'd lived in Lancashire .ce I lwar a little child, an'folks say as I spake ,,ther like the Irish nor the English. I'm jost tf an' 'alf, a kind of a mixed creatur' at bst. know the.

She 'eld itldiwn so's.we could allsee it, an"then another manld took it en'"arledL it offso sahow to,te peoplea in another part.o'.the park. Then two men took the gran'cushions-ot of the Queen's carruiage, an' lifted all the lads 'an' 'wenhehsinto lse'arriage, Eh, hut theythrowved "'timisl' bnbalcj' a't dowinfes, they were kLited out, n' I eas aong 'em., .I have sat in the Queen's carriaget Aw ell,-its a 'long road from the Queen at Chatsworth to Ellen M'Kierna an"''er man Up rer hot now ay lines are cast among such as the MdKierenes,.

So she -turnrd to Tom; an' says 'she," Tom;' I workedinl the mill day-times, ;an'I worked in the'osus nights,:when I was the mother of seven small children; rm' you, as 'as nothin' but a man's part to do in this world, 'ill never know 'ow 'ard awoman's lote can be Inever shirked sy work, for:I:wanted Ito giveyou achoolin','n 'a"ve you larn a good tlids .

John MeKierean is quine a pete; 'e m'kes little rhmyoa, an' puts the .words in their places so's the veragscomeont 'right; an' when 'e coom into the kitchen, a racketin' an' saknockin' over the chairs in. the dark, 'o was ainein' away verses about Ellen 'erst, as 'e'd made up, She'eared 'im, bet she paks never a word, only bolted 'or bedroom door fast;. while 'e begins to sing, When I was a Bachelor, an mwld Irish song, as I 'have 'eard my father sing when I was a bit of a girl There's net mannyfolk as know it now. Iman ay it in Irish en' English both, 'E shouted out in the dead o' night, the most aggravatin' of all the vrsense: " I fncied the mosney, ' Her fortene 'as deeetved me, I Itmakescaecryen'ofteusigh, The, shirt I cannot wear it When I rise inathe morning, I goto cy labour, t 'Ineverdoaoom'ome, Till dumke ceoms oa fairly.

When 'e 'ad finished the rarses, an' was just beginning' again When I was aBachelor, lM'Kier nan tries the bedroom door, an' finds it locked on 'im. So then'e awears, an' Ellen epakes for the first time, an' calls through the key-hole, "I've got the childer in 'ere, an' I've spent the nighta-prayin'foryoe.

Then there was more row, an' at the lost Mr. MI'EiLrnan an' 'is son both postnd nif; an' the Lord knows where they paassed the night. In the mornin' the father coom an' fetched 'is clothes an' the lades, an' they both took boheard together nigh to the mill, whero Mr. M'Kiernan ina spinner.
