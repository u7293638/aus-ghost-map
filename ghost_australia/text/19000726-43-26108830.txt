There were soclnsset, viz.. under 900 Ib. live weight ,i 3 over that weight". In tlif class fur' :Jer 900 1b , optn to nil breeds, 15 cmn rtitors tested, all beinii Jerseys.. Their rerage weight whs 800 lb. each; on an rerajje they Ind bt'Mii 93 days in milk; ie yield uf milk for 24 hoars averaged 3li j. i!| nz., or ab.iut 14$ quarts each; and ie -iveniae butter yield lib. 11 1-3 oz. icb. In the class for 900 lb. live weight idoveronly 8 cow's compt)tud;3 were riveys and 3 Shorthorns. The average eii'ht of the Jerseys ?aa 969 lb., nnd of ;eShorthorn 1550 lb. each. The J?isey p?s on an average had been milking 124 iys (over four months), the Shorthorns :ily4u' days. The Jerseys gave 37 lb. )?z. ('ibout 15 quitts), and the Shoit orns 30 lb. 15 oz. (about 12 quarts) of iilk in the 24 hours. The Jersey milk rodaced an average of 1 lb. 13 1-3 oz of jtter per cow, rhs Shorthorns 1 lb. 2 12 ?z It will be observed that the cows ider 9001b. and only average 800 lb. ire tj lb. more milk and 9| oz. more itter per heart than the Shorthorns, eyhiug 1550 lb. ench. The cost of feed i a cow of 550 lb., as against one of 0 lb., must be very great, nearly if not lite, double. As this is this leading sirying test show in England, we may be ire the best cows of all breeds are sent, id yet in the open classes, out of 23 cows sted, 18 were Jerseys, only leaving 5 of 1 other breeds that were considered of itficient merit to enter the test ring :ainat them. This should clearly allow ;e relative merits of the Jersey and horthotn as a dairyman's cow."
