COBAW. (FROM OUR OWN CORRESPONDENT.) ? Friday. The State school entertainment, which was postponed from last month, came off on Wednesday evening. On this occasion the weather was beautiful. A number of ladies and gentlemen came from Kyneton and Lancefield to assist. The various items of the programme were well rendered, and were appreciated by the audience. At the close of the programme the teacher, Mr. Morris expressed the thanks of the audience for the kindness of those who had come so far to assist in providing prizes for the children who attend the Cobaw school. The building was tastefully decorated with ferns and flowers.

Since my last letter there has been more trouble in this district. This was the death of a promising young man of eighteen years, Daniel Alcorn. Great sympathy is felt by all for his relatives, who are well known and highly respected in the district. Heavy rain fell yesterday, doing a great deal of good, but disappointing many who wanted to go to the Kyneton show.
