The Red Spectres of Europe. The sympathies and prejudices of race are as deep as the instincts of humanity, and as lasting as time Never were they more potent than they are in Europe to-day They govern the policy of rulers, and shape tho destiny of nations Tho Teuton, tho Anglo Saxon, and the Scandinavian are harmonious, for they are allied by blood, but between them and the Celt, the Magyar, tho Slav, and the Turk there is a slender bond of international union likely at any time to be broken It is an unfortunate cause of trouble that the same country is so often peopled by many different races England has a large and unquiet Celtic element in her population Ger many has several million Slavs , while tho popu latiou of Austria is composod of many ratos, of which the Germau, Magyar, and Slav are tho preponderating forces Qermauy and Austria aro tho only natural allies on tho Coutiueut of Europe, and they ato hkoly to hold together no niattor how other Coutmeutal uatious aro sepai ited in feohug or uuited ni attion Tlioir tomtory divides Europe by a broad baud from sea to sea, aud is able to inter- pose nu impassable barrier to the poweis lyiug to the east aud wost The Slav is the red spectre which at present affrights Europe The Slavonian relationship is numerous, and extends from Russia, through Germany and Austria, into Turkey There are 80,000,000 of the three branches of the race, of which number about 50,000,000 are in Russia, 10,500,000 in Austro-Hungaiy, and 3,500,000 iu Turkey Tho Russians are tho dominant branch, and Panslavism—that is, the uniting of the Slavonian people under one Government -has long been a dream of tho Muscovite It is easy to see that ere such a dream could be loalised a remodelling of the map of Europe would be necessary, which would be almost as radical and thorough as that made by Napoleon Bonaparte Nearly half tho population of Aus tria would pass under Russian rule, and tho limits of Russia would be extended so far be yond the Danube as to include Servia, Bulgaria, and Montenegro-that is, nearly the whole of Turkey in Europe It is not surprising that, with 46 per cent of the people Slavic by blood and semi Russian in sympathy, Austria should be jealous of her eastern neighbour, and should desire more an alliance with tho Emperor Wil- liam than with tho Czar in the impending trouble With Turkey An additional danger would have accrued to Austria had Russia been permitted to superintend tho autonomous settlement of Servia, Roumania, and Bulgaria, as at first contemplated by the treaty of San Stefano It is Austrns jealousy of Russia, and Ger uiany'a inclinations toward the Austrian iilhanco, together with Qltdatonu's natural antipathy to the II ipsburgs, that has thiovvn England and Russia into ono auothcr s arms iu the. settlement of tho Eastern question Lugl lud bus hitherto looked on Russia as an enemy only beaauso »ho Was on the flank of nil hor routes to Indi i, and hor forcea in Central Asi i seemed dangerously noai to that wealthy depondeucy Tho ghost of Russian conquest was conjured up by the lories, and is hkoly to bo laid by tho Líbenla Glad Btouo has no fear of tho Czar, aud were the other great Povvors unwilling to mo force m compelling 1'urkoy to codo tho territory specified at Borhu to Qioeco and Muntouegi o, vv ottlil bo quite leady to compel tho cossiou with Russia, s aid ulono, and thon to permit tho disuiombermont of tho Turkish Lui piro, giving to Russia the freedom of tho Dai dnuollos, und suth portion of Asia Minor as might aoom equitable, or for tho good of tho subject peoples Tbo Anglo Savon does not di ead tho Slav, noi would tho gieiter part of tho English people regret to soo Turkey aum lulatod and Austun. divided according to tho races of winch ita population is composed, so that tho bordera of civil and religious fieedom wet o enlarged Meanwhile tho Turkish ililli culty proceeds slowly towards adjustment, Qlad stouo s ill hoaltlt Botnowhat impeding uogotia tious Albania continuos obstinato, the Porto acts with moio or loss deceit, aud tho wholo aQau, whothor icgarded fiom tbo standpoint of tho pooplo occupyiug tho torntoiy in dispute, or from that of tho nations which aio adjudicating and acting thoorotic illy iu*coucoit, the situation ia fiaught with poril to tho poaco of Euiopo, mid niconvonionco to tho wholovvoild -S F Bulletin ino v lo iu. , .. _i on, "ol" i ,.
