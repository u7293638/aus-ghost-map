Told in the ohoorful light tff the day, it soeined rather a lame story, so1 another divor wont down to seo what ho could make of it. Towards him also came tho ghostly gray shapes. Ho stood irrosoluto for a momont and thon, going boldly forward, struck his hatchet through â€” a mirror ! The ghosts wero only a dim reflection of his own legB, much enlarged, of course, as everything is that a divor boos through tho frontal oyo of his holmot.
