THE CAMDEN ELECTION. Declaration of the poll. Shoktly after uoon 011 Saturday the ofloial declaration of the poll took place at the . Picton courthouse. There was a large at tendance, considering that the business was only a 'matter of form, and that those pre . sent were perfectly aware of tho result on the previous evening. Tho Ileturning-officer, Mr. J. M. Antill, congratulated both the candidates aud tho e ectors on tho manner in which the contest had been carried out, and hoped that now all would bo friends. He was glad to say that throughout no hitoh had occurred as* far as his duties were concerned. That in a great measure was due to the courtesy of the local telegraph master, Mr. Burgess, who had kindly kept tho office open till ten o'clock the previous night. The Eeturning-officer "then exhibited several ballot pa-ere to show the stupidity of per sons attempting to reoord their votes when not knowing how to do so, stating that it would be better for such persons to trust to the presiding officer, and the scrutineers. There had been 46 informal ballot papors, which meant that 92 votos had been thrown | away. He hoped what ho had said would, have the desired effect on future occasions. Ho.would tako the .opportunity of mention 's ing pne^matter, as if was tho only season able time ho would have for doing so.- Tho Pjabou Progress Committee had taken on itself to dictate to him. At the nomina tion the magistrates' bench had been re served for candidates and their nominators ; and he accordingly reserved the jury box for the ningit traies. With this act.the Progress Committee had found fault, but he wisfied to tell that body, or anyone else, that in his position as Eeturning-officer he would not be dictated to. (Applause.) He had performed the duty for years, and if they had any complaint to make let them write to the Colonial Secretary, and he (Mr. An till) would bo prepared with a reply. A letter was to have been sent him from the Progress Committee, but it had not yet ar rived. . In the discharge of his duties as Eeturning-officer lie had sacrificed con siderable time, and was willing to occupy the position as long as ho retained their confidence. (Loud applause.) He then announced the state of the poll atid declared Messrs. Garrett and M'Court elected. (Cheers.) Mr. Garrett on rising was enthusiasti cally applauded. He said the task was again imposed upon him of thanking them for the high honor of returning him ns one of their representatives, and he could not find words to thank thorn, as the present was the most important election he bad ever contested. He had been returned con tinuously longer than any man in Australia and had never yet been defeated. He thanked them for plaoing him at tho top of the poll, although he did uot attach much importance as to whether a man was either first or second as long as he was returned. There had never been a contest more fairly and honestly fought out than the present, and the Eeturning-officer had the pleasure, of knowing that the credit was mainly due to him(Mr Antill)for tho completeness of his arrangemen ts. He (Mr. Garrett) said that in returning him it was a proof the electors had approved of his action in accepting the office of Minister of LandR. Mr.M'Conrt whowas loudly cheered,said he was incapable of bhauking them for the posi tion in which they had placed bim, and he hoped his conduct in Parliament would justify the good opinion they had formed of him. He hoped the best men had been selected. He thanked those who had voted for him, especially his Picton friends, and hoped to do something for them in retnrn. Mr. Kidd, who upon rising was cheered for some second"), said he thanked them for their expression of sympathy, and those 'who had stood by him during the contest. The people this end of the district had shown unmistakably by their votos that they were desirous of retaining , his services. Dur ing the contest be had been compelled to fight against unprecedented difficulties, He had to fight against the Government influence. He had voted for the nd valorem duties because they Were required for re venue purposes, and was only a Pro tectionist that far. It was a claptrap to talk about abolishing them.n Ho would liot make promises he knew he could nevor 'fulfill,-and would never occupy a seat in the House unless lie could do so fairly and honorably. The question put before the country should not have been Freetrado or Protection, but how .the deficit was to be got rid of. The contest had not been carried out, fiiirly, aR bunching had been •resorted to—otherwise bo would that day be one of their representatives. On some I future occasion if they were desirous -of obtaining his services he might be per snaded to again offer himself. He bad passed through lho contest honorably; nnd would never pledge himsplf to undo work Jia had helped to do. There would be a prent revulsion of public feeling within tile next few months. He considered that She obtaining of .seats, as some had done, *fas unworthy of those that held them. Mr. HanrnbnivaUo met with a hnndFome vccoption—in fact the defeated candidntos . wore quite as well received as tlio success ful ones. Ho returned his sincere thanks to tlvo '107 electors who had voted for linn for their support and adhesion to tho prin-1 ciplcs of Protection. If ho hiul not como out the Freetraders would have had * walk over. As the electors had declared for Freetrade he \vui perfectly satisfied. He had an uphill battlo to fight, with sirong men against lam. Considering ho had saved his £-10 (loud aud long cheering) lie was satisfied with tho result. From the start he knew he had not the ghost of chance. (Laughter.) In a few years public opinion would undergo a chnngo with regard to Free Trade aud lie hoped to then contest an election as a Protectionist. Tho pre sent had been only a oanter, the next at tempt would bo a win. Mr. Garrett proposed that the very best thanks of tho electors aud caudidates be accorded to the Returning-officer, who everyone who had anything to do with the election would agreo had acted impartially and given universal satisfaction. ' _ • Mr. M'Court in seconding the motion said lie agreed with overy word Mr. Garrett had snid. Mr. Antill was tho best lie turn ing officer in the colony. Mr. Kiddhad pleasure in supporting the proposition. ■ Carried, and threo cheers given for Mr. Antill-. ' ' The Keturning-officer in thanking them, said he, was alwayo accessible. He know his duty, iu fact ho would be a fool after all these years of sorvice, if he did not. Ho al ways acted impartially, and even the mem bers of his own family did not know which candidato-i ho was 111 favour of. Cheers were given for tho Queen and ( all the candidates. The proceedings through out wore most orderly, the boateu men get ting splendid receptions.—Picton Argus.
