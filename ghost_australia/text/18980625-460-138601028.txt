HAUNTED. During one of the halts made by Lietr tenant H. L. Willoughby, in bis canoeing trip across the Everglades in the United States, he had brief acquaintance with a snake, with, an after-effect which reptile haters alone can fully appreciate. He says:â€” One night, after starting supper on the kerosene stove, and sitting down on one of the camp-chests, I happened to look toward the canoes through the little tunnel of foliage we had made, and on a limb within two feet of the level our heads had passed, in our frequent trips with canoe-loads, was a five- foot snake. He had been watching us all the time, and now he kept his wicked little eyes on my every movement. I now took my turn at watching him, to see if lie would move when he found him- self observed. No! he also had evidently made his camp for the night, with no in- tention of allowing any one to disturb him. So I picked up the shotgun and gave him a load of small shot. He dropped from the limb, but was caught in a crotch and wedging near his tail, so that he hung down nearly his full length, as dead as snakes usually are inside of 12 hours. We continued our supper, giving no further thought to the reptile, as snakes had, by this time, become a familiar sight. After finishing my evening task on my maps and notes, and the important opera- tion of winding my chronometers, I disap- peared under my cheese-cloth. But somehow I could not go to sleep as usual. I looked out toward the open glades and saw, silhoutted against the Bright moonlight, that miserable snake, which I had forgotten all about, his body assuming those easy curves that only snakes can make. I rolled over on the other side, but my eyes kept getting back to that snake, and I soon found that sleep would be impossible so long as he hung there. I turned out. and with the help of a abort stick, pulled the reptile from the branch. I had laid my ghost, and now I could sleep.
