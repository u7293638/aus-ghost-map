Xabies' Column. j Bachelor's Hall. j I 1 Br H. C. Dodge. j Hurrah ! hurrah for'Bachelor's Hall ; The Queen's away and I'm monarch of all ; I don't have to hang up my coat or my hat, And when I tret lonely I talk to the cat. I come when I like, and I go when I choose. The finest cigars help me scatter the blues ; No bundles I carry, and nothing I buy ; There's no one to care about — only " big I." I revel in wildest confusion around ; There isn't a thing in its place to be found ; My books and newspapers, they litter the room That hasn't for weeks seen the sight of a broom. There's clothing or something on eTery chair ; My bed's never made, but it's little I care : I sleep like a top, for there's no one to call — 1 take solid comfort in Bachelor's Hall. I've used all the dishes and now it's my fate To eat, when I'm home, on the hack of a plate ; I'm learning to cook, but, alas, I confess I choose to go hungry than swallow the mess. But, Bachelor's Hall with its comfort and quiet, Is almost too spooky for regular diet ; No children live in it to welcome their dad, No supper is waiting, no wife — 0, so glad. . No ! Nothing but ghosts of the loved ones away Inhabit this tomb where alone I must stay, Compelled to break silence by having a chat With my woful companion, the strange act ing cat. 0, gladly I'll yield jmy crown sceptre and all The Kingly delights of a Bachelor's Hall To the Queen of the Home when she comes with her train To wisely and lovingly over me reign.
