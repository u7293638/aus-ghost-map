BOWLS. The lest of the series of bowling matches fur the New South WaleB Association champion medal took place on Friday, September 29, on the King's School Green, Parra matta, the competitors being Messrs. James Toohey of the Annandale Club, and John Forsythe of the Cook Park Club, the result being an. easy victory for the latter by 31 to 12. There were originally thirty entries from various clubs belonging to the association, and comnetin? members of the same club drew against each other until the number was reduced to 2 from each club. The contests then went on until Messrs. Toohey and Forsyth were left to contend for the prize. The match was watched with, considerable interest by a fair number of spectators, but the weather was rather unfavourable to first-class play, the wind affecting the bias of the balls. Mr. Toohey all through his matches had been drawn against; first-class players, so- that be has had to work hard all through, and it must have been somewhat of a disappointment to him that he was compelled to euccurnb on Friday. The medal will be pre ernted to the winner at the annual meeting of the Associa tion to take plsce during the present month, and the champion club trophy will also be handed over. The Cook Park Club wfll have been, successful in both eases, with Annacdale eecond. Rest jear it is contemplated to add three other prizes to the matches, eo that the last four repre sentatives left in will get a prize ; and it is expected for that jeaeon that the entries will be very numerous.
