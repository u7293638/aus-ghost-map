LIKE AS A MOON. Love, thou art waning, alsr too soon I. Love, thou art over thy penalone ! Waxing weary, as passions pale Lagging late as desires fail. Love, thou art lessening slow but sure, Thy perfect circle could not endure I Full soon thou wilt be but a broken are Sailing on to the swallowing dark ! love, thou haut vanished ! no single ray Shoots from thine orbit across our way, No ghost of thee vexes content supreme, We only remember thee as a dream !
