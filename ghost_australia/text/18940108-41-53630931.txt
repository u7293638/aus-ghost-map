THE CYC LOR AM A. Napoleon's ghost at the Cyclornma seems to have tbe same amount of fascination for the public as the ghost of Hamlet had for the young Dane. Tho attendance at the Cyclo rams on Saturday evening waa again large, and the illusion proved a complete success. Not only is tho likeness to the original a perfect one, but tbe details in dress, even to the colours, are faithfully shown.
