NATIONAL CHARACTER. ] From the Westminster Gazette) On eng are something which appear difficult to express in exactly the same proportion in which they are easy to conceive A simple object can be seized at once by the intelligence, but it is quite another thing to express it accurately with the pen multiplicity of words is somewhat antagonistic to simplicity of thought A broken mirror may relied the object, but it will be in a multitudinous and fra,; memory manner this difficulty does not aUvuv arise from the nature of human speech We often imagine we possess very distinct notions, till by some accident we are forced to try our hand at putting, them on paper the very fact of taking up the pen seems to act as a dissolvent on our power of conception the Vivid thought which we prided ourselves so much upon moves, and melts, and runs into a cloud and disappears the moment we attempt to throw it into words these notions possess a sort of J Utility to ghosts-the) disport themselves with all the greater boldness in proportion to the imbecility) of the mind which they inhabit the more vivid they are, so much the more difficult it is to grasp them But there are other cause of this difficulty besides poverty) of mind Men may not only be possessed by an idea, which, while it haunts them, escapes their apprehension, they may also conceive a. notion winch bears about it all the notes of genuine thought, and yet, when they attempt to seize hold of it and force it into words like catching a poll) in fl Held with a wisp of lui)-itclcvcrlv (this them the slip, and leaves Hiern looking foolish, with the experiment to try again with probably about the same success. It is a much easier thing to repeat words than to fix the mind steady) on thought A parrot, we presume, is not allied with any power of analysis, or even with capacity) to understand the force efforts Hut a pierrot cm talk to make use of words is one thing, to understand them is another Most animals can be taught to imitate certain sounds Men are proverbially) of the imitative class sheep do not walk, more contended) in each other s foot marks than men follow each other in the groove of thought to repeat what has been said before, without the trouble of having thought it out, requires very little intellectual wear and tear Most men are simply echoes of another voice new drink, but all men talk, and theorise and declaim the less the intellectual ballast, so much the more freely can the tongue disport itself Now there are a variety) of topics upon which men consider they have a right to speak Of course matters of strict silence, of theology, of jurisprudence and such like, are the property of a certain class. But every man can talk of liberty, and progress, and free thought, and religion, and truth, and morality, and national character Three belong indn criminated) to all These, and kindred questions, the multitude min toss about with as they please, and no one is thought presumptuous who ventures an oil hand opinion on dam At a moment's notice. Men can speak Friend) upon than met with ease There have their opinions at their finger ends I he) can LO on arguing and beating round the bush till they have fairly muddled themselves, -mel effectually puzzled everybody) else "w here the weight of thought is absent there die consequent flow of words begins is over there is a certain class of subjects upon which the public has so long made up its mind, that is, upon which it has so long ceased actively to think at all, that we have some hesitation in touching on it We know well the force and inveteracy) of habit And we know there is no force and inveteracy) equal to a formula of words, which, by process of time and continual bandy has, about, has had all die thought knocked out of it One might just as well try to ward off the blows of a bludgeon with an enthroned as imagine it possible to overcome the immovable rigidity) of stereotyped phraseology with argument or (common sense But, when to the same terms) of habit, and the torpor of a satiated mind, is added the dicates of self-love, the case becomes ten times more difficult How beat the till! formula can be broken up, and die dried bones be decently) buried away, while a new life of genuine thought can be im- planted, is a problem which requires solution We clearly) see the decay of the task Our thorough appreciation of it at once accounts for belong an mer > duction is over there is no imaginable question on which an Englishman drinks he has a greater right, to speak than on the nr- j tions character. and yet, of all others, this is a subject watched differs ties we have have just mentioned flail a name to master, the English man B views like a i\ev>Sound and cod, have long, ago been cut and dried for him. He wants no schooling on this point it is in any preposterous to imagine that he does not know the very people amongst whom he has been bred and born, and is incapable of under standing them Ask him and he will tell you at once that an Englishman is honest, men j, straight forward, and truthful he is the magnanimous man He possesses the noblest national titles of any man under the sun He is plodding and persevering and indomitable He is the ancient Roman Anglicise 1 He is comparatively the most perfect type of human nature that has been created He has his faults, but so have others He has done injustice , but who has not He may be a sinner, but he is the noblest of sinners His worth is seen in the works of his head and hands in the fruit of his thought, in the results of his skill, and the enterprise of his commerce His strong, hard, practical sense, his stubborn energy lune made him take the first place in the race, and carry away the pure Such are the common plates which are continually repeated to the echo they have been uttered a thousand times, and it is pleasant, and requires no thought to utter the n again to say we are the first people in the world, and to carry) so pleasant a proposition by nccUmition, and to raise it almost to a national axiom, is quite in accordance with the build of the public mind Men do not object to flatter the national vanity at so trifling an intellectual cast But this miserable and weary repetition, besides encouraging a sickly vain, superinduced a very unhealthy Btugn men of mind a stagnation of mind upon a subject of the most vital national importance If men allow their minds to crust over with unmeaning platitudes, they will never know anything of what lies beneath the surface the traditional opinion of our superior worth is most likely to engender self deception It is 80 pleasing to indulge in these dreams of our own Virtue and perfection, that they all the easier occupy the place of healthy thought Here we. advanced in our knowledge of the national character within the last hundred years i Have we not been content to take up the cry which his been handed down by tradition, almost from time immemorial, has any one made a serious study of the Englishman 5 Has any one taken so much interest in the improvements of his character, as many have in the breed of sheep and oxen, in studying the habits and functions of animal creation 5 If the character which we give ourselves is mainly true, are we to be content with anything so vague and general, so missus factory for practical work Can our say ings of our selves help us in the least The fact is, this is one of those points in which we play the parrot AN by not break through the crust and sink into the depth of this important subject For instance, do English They ask themselves such questions as these And are they anxious for an answer 5 How is the national character formed ? "What are its essentials 5 NVho is the model man. On w horn should we form ourseh es5 Is there more than one by peS "W Inch is the most per- fect Should we tend towards it is the national character pagan or Christian, or a mixture of both 5 Have we a clear idea of the character we should endeavour to develop in the child "What method do we make use of to elicit it in by South Whit are the principles on this point in our schools and colleges and universities Is there any systematic process for forming men on a perfect model What are our aims, what our success Is there a model universally received or is the English character formed imperceptibly by the various influences which surround his education-is he fashioned into shape like a number of pebbles shaken in a bag is it simply the result of friction or is it the spontaneous growth of the natural man - or is any great hero held up to imitation-Cromwell, or New ton, or Nelson, or NVtl ling ion 5 These and a thousand questions more suggest trains of thought as interesting and often equally important with themselves We sincerely hope that such questions as these have been seriously thought upon and carefully discussed II men have blindly followed the picture of tradition they may possibly have fallen into serious error. The traditions of a race, and the radiance of national glory, are not always the best instruction of mankind Ihetjpe of national perfection may be an imperfect model He who lines the accepted notion of an Englishman, however the Englishman may be in advance of other national characters, takes as his pattern that which itself requires a fairer form and a more perfect finish He who does not look above and beyond a nationality, is hula better than the pagan Greek or Roman those sturdy pagans looked higher than this they looked with reverence to their gods, and strove to reach head There was a fatherhood above them which knit them into one, and after which they strove they moulded themselves on the highest form they knew Pluto and Cicero, the model Greek and the model Homan, held lofty notions of the righteous man At j miles they almost appear to have been visited by a vision of a higher and purer morality than their own , though they fell continually to earth, their tendency was heavenwards, and their writing sparkle here and there, in a startling manner, with a purer ray The Creek especially had a more polished and a loftier mind than our own, and the Roman. though more masculine? and practical than the Greek, bears the Bimnp upon it of Athenian cultivation the English mind is coarser and more material Itselcvauon is due to Christianity.
