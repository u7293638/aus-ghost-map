The Samson, as will be seen'by'referring to the exports, has taken down to Sydney the specimens of Queensland produce, &c;, for the Exhibition of 1862, to ship' on board the Vimeira, by which vessel it has been determined by the Commissioners to send them to London, as it presents the earliest repair 'empty. They were sent by the Samson because she can go alongside the ship, and discharge her cargo at once, thus avoiding I much of the pi obablo Fisk and damage. , , n TheB'ionnptrto has brought down 2 casks tallow, 20 hides, 2 bales sheepskins, 3 cases plants, and 1 has specimens, from Port Denison. A singular accident happened to the Aber gaulle, cutter (butter known as the Ben Bolt) which is now engaged in the oyster trade, on her last trip from the Bribie passage.; J. Milne, her owner, reports that, while anchored under one of the points in the passage, a storm of' thunder and lightning was raging, and that the lightning struck the mast of the cutter, setting ("no to the sails, which were stowed away, and burnt through three pieces of canvas before the Armies could he extinguished. Singularly enough, no other damage was done whatever. Mr. Milne and his mate were on the shore under a tree, and 'ft vivid flash of lightning seemed to strike very near them. Mr. Milne observed that it struck the cutter, and immediately Â¡it'toiwimls saw the sail on fire. He and his mate hastened on board and extinguished it, and had to mend the R iii with force and gunny bags Mr. Milne also reports that three weeks ago the blacks showed in great numbers on the shore, and tried all they know to decoy him nearer the land, evidently for no good purpose. Several wanted to go on board the cutter, but he refused all but one, who, when he got on board kept up a noisy conversation with those on shore, and tried all he could to persuade Mr. Milne togo never in. When. at last Mr. Milne told the blackfellow to go ashore again,hoiefusod, and wanted him to be put ashore, and he had ultimately to be tin oat sued before he would go. Mr. Milne saw Mr. Pettigrew in the Hotham in the passage, and Mr. P. wanted him to pilot the little steamer, but as Milne is under engagement to be in Brisbane once a week, and as he was 1 mining up with his cargo of oysters, which do not improve by keeping, bowns obliged to refuse, but gave what information he could, and left them to proceed on their passage j
