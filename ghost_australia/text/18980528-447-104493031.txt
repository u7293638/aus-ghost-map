/ NOTES. ? A now edition of ' .Don Quixote ' has been forwarded by George Robertson and Co. It is well bound, printed with good type on fine paper, consists of 640 images, and 16 freah illustrations by W. H. Robertson, and the price is only 2s. It is Jarvis' translation, and is a marvellously cheap book. The1, publishers are Bliss, Sands and Co. From bho same firm we have- 'Simon Dale,' by Anthony Hope, a tale of the period of Charles II, , in. Mr. Hope's most delightful style j and ' Shrewsbury,' by Stanlev Wevman. Goorgo Robertson and Co. roport a good demand for 'Duffy's Life in Two Hemis phercs,' roviewed in last week's 'Oatholio Press,' and also, for Justin M'Oarthy's ' Story of Gladstone's Life.' .
