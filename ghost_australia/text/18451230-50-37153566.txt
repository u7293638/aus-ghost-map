Ono day four of them, Smith, Brown, Jones, and Robinson, took it into their heads to play the truant, and go into the water. Theyhad 'not boon in Jong bofore Smith was drowned ! Brown's father followod him, and lashed him heartily while ho was naked; and Jones and Robinson run home hulf-di'ossod, which plainly told whoro they had boon. However, they wore both J£nJ '° 'ed without any supper, and told .very plainly that they should bo well corrected, at school next day l'; -Ve pass the 'second lesson,', as it .contains little worthy of thought, save the benevolent proroiso of tho schoolmaster, who, as they Bay In thb playbills, ' in tho most handsome manner'^ pledges himself to flog the delinquents; a pledge whioh he redeems in a spirit of punctuality moro than satisfactory to tho sufferers.
