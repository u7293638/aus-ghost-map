STRANGE DOINGS AT DU3B0. INVISIBLE STONE-THKOWERS. Considerable interest has been aroused (says a Dubbo correspondent) by the report taat missilep, such as brickbats, pieces of wood and iron, scraps of mortar, &c;, were being thrown by unBeen hands at and around a newly-erected residence in our pleasant suburb, Newt own. Your correspon dent, 012 inquiry, found that in addition to these reckless proceedings strange tappings at the windows, End performances on the bell and knocker had varied the source of alarm, no signs of human agency being visible. The disturbance commenced on Tuesday night last, and occurred on each of the following three evenings. Flying pieces of brick were also seen in broad daylight, at 11 o'clock in the fore noon, and early in the afternoon. On Beveral occasions the knockings also occurred in the day time. The owner removed the bell, but has replaced it, hoping to have an oppoitunity of detecting the source of trouble. The disturbances have been witnessed in some phase or another by 15 or 16 people, including members of the police force. On Sunday numbers visited the spot and held consultations over the scattered missiles, but no abnormal manifestations took place. Around the enclo sure are several patches of shrubby under growth, which would afford shelter to any evilly disposed persons ; but there appears to be a total absence of motive, and the phenomena have not abated in consequence of tne efforts to ensure de tection. The explanations and suggestions of visitors have been numerous and, combined with the worry of the affair, prove embarrassing to the proprietor of the premises, who is not quite surÂ« whether he would not rather have the ghost alone to contend with. No one has been actually struck by the missiles, although narroAV escapes have occurred.
