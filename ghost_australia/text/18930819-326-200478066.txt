LOVERS OF WARMTH. The invention of fire was a great step in the progress of the human race, and it is not strange that so many uncivilised peoples have superstitious notions con- nected with it. When our Australian aborigines camp for the night a fire is lighted in front of each hut — the huts be ing made of boughs, with the openings carefully turned away from the wind— so that the feet of those who are sleeping within may be kept warm. If one of their relatives has lately died, an additional and solitary fire is lighted at a little distance from the huts, where the ghost of the deceased may sit down and warm himself without disturb ing the family hearth. In fact, warmth is so great a necessity to the natives that they seem to think the dead can only by degrees become accos- tomed to the want of it, and the airing sf a grave by kindling a fire within it is a very important ceremony at a funeral. This same love of warmth creates an aversion to early rising, the natives are seldom seen abroad unlill the sun has been out one or two hours above the hori zon. In wet weather it is usual to carry in the hand, beneath the kangaroo skin a piece of smouldering wood, which compensates the bearer in some sort for the want of a flannel waistcoat, and en ables him to light a fire at a moment's notice. Each tribe possesses a territory of its own, and each family of the tribe has its own especial tract of land within tliaL tei- ritory. Here a man can light his fire and build his hut without fear of molestation. It is, in fact, his paternal estate, so thai the word " fire " conveys to an Australian the'same-meaning-of-fatherland- orbii'th- place as the word " hearth " conveys to a F.nrnnean;Tarid is. used: by trie aborigines in that sense.'
