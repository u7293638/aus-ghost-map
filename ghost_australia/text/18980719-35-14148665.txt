MR. PICKWICK IN BATH. Bath is a stately, dignified old city, and its parades, pump-room, and the rest are haunted by ghosts of antique personages who ruffled it there in the last century Boz, too, has done much to kindle interest in the place , Pickwick, the immortal, containing a better description of the tone and manners of the place in the thirties than Miss Burney or Smollett has given of their eras in his account there is an air of faded gentility, old fashion, and old customs for then the coremoniousnes3 and state of society was barely lingering on and was presently to disappearing Bath (says the " St. James' Gazette ") the faith in Pickwick is strong, as, indeed, it is in the half- dozen or so Pickwickian towns, Ipswich, Rochester, Eurythmic is, Mr Pickwick has iron u into a sort of historical personage, who actually visited the places and stayed at the old inns, where they invariably show yo a his particular rooms Atnencau guests often ask for the privilege of " sleeping in Mr Pickwick's room " Lately a Bath gentleman of shrewd sense was at the Great White Horse at Ipswich, and was perfectly beguiled by the faith of the waiter, who spoke of the changes that had occurred " since Mr Pickwick was here " The White Hart at Bath, where the great man put up, has long since been pulled down Queen-square, a charming Old World square, was where Mr Bantam, the M O , resided at No 11 Bantam was drawn, with some disguise, from a well-known Colonel Jervoise who lived in this very house The place where the famous Bath footmen had their immortal warry a boiled leg of mutton with the " usual trimmings " has been ascertained beyond doubt in Princes street, a few doors down, and turning out of the square, there is a rather murky looking public house known as the Beaufort Arms, much fallen from its former style, where one could imagine knives and marks of various coloured handles being borrowed for occasions of state This is remembered as the actual house of call for the " well " footmen, and here they had their meetings Some recall, in the palmy days of the Octagon Chapel, the whole posse of the Bath footmen attending in their splendid regimentals, velvets, gold lace, epaulets, cases we, attendants who dared not say their masters, but their employers The house is, no doubt, described as a greengrocer's, but Box, as was his custom, did not wish to be too minute and particular in his descriptions Mr Pickwick and his friends went into furnished lodgings in a house in the beautiful and unique Droacout, Mrs Craddock being his landlady. It has been ascertained by our Bath Pickwickian that there were only one or two houses in the Crescent thus let out, the test being private mansions Mr Pickwick must therefore have been either at No 15 or 16 or 11, the houses in question - a comfort to know, so far as it goes Something more distinct would have been desirable, but it is really are near is one can get It is hard as you look up to the stately first floor window not to think of the animated scene-the infuriated Dowler shouting, the Redan at the door, and Mr Winkle in his dressing-gown flowing round the Crescent. Charles Dickens the younger, by the day, objects to this phase of his sire's, who, he insists, was confounding it with the circus , but you can run round in Bonn-circle-that is, turn bade at the top with a sweep or it may be that the ground in front was open and without a railing The old assembly-rooms are there still, r with the tearooms and card rooms So is the old theatre, with its venerable stone front, and the baths still abound. Everywhere we seem to meet Mr Pickwick walking about or going up a hill after taking his tumbler (with a flat our of warm smoolhin'-irons)-which was certainly Milsom street The occasion of Dickens's visit to Bath was the series of speeches which Lord John Russell was making all over the country for his contest in 1884 He had just defeated Sir R Peel's Government Ilia energetic Bos' had come down with his fellow reporter Board-both being on the staff of the " Morning Chronicle " He spared himself in no point, determined to secure the best results for his employers They were at the Bush Inn, Bristol, in May, arranging the " expressing " of Speech from Bath and other places. The BIIBII, m Carr-street, which was the house to which Mr Winkle died from the angry Dowler, was pulled down some 30 or 40 years ago, and a bank, the Wiltshire and Dorset, stands on the site At Bath Eoz contrived to take in a great deal There is a quaint inn at Walcot, most curious as a specimen of the old carrier's inn It has a tablet dated 1713 and here he put up There are some in Bath who recall him and his persevering efforts to cross the little court, his candle being blown out, he returning with much persoN chance to have it lighted, only to be blown out once more A most interesting, piquant monument this, only to be matched by Johnson's White House at Hamburgh The pump room is exactly now as it is described in Pickwick "-oven " the Tompion dook " is in the same place BO IS the statue of Nash, and there is the open book for those who wish to put down their names It was during this election, in the January of the same year, that Box went to Ipswich and witnessed the humours of the EaUnswill election for though he brings his characters later to Ipswich under its proper name, he could not venture to deal with the Parliamentary abuses so freely is he did without some disguise
