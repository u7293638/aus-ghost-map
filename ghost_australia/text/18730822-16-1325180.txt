SYDNEY UNIVERSITY EXAMINATIONS. His Excellency the Governor received, some time ago, the following letter on the above sub- feet from Professor Poll - His Excellency the Most Noble the Marquis of Normanby, Governor of Queensland. University, Sydney, June 15, 1873 My Dear Lord Marquis-st am instructed by the Senate of the University to address Your Lordship on a subject of somounportauco For several years past we have had in operation a system of public examinations similar to that in England, known as the Middle Class Examination, in connection with the great Universities Full particulars concerning our system are contained in a tract, copies of which I have directed to be forwarded to you by post By means of those examinations the adv stages of the University have to some extent been hold out to a large portion of the community, not only in Sydney, but in the country districts They enable teachers and others not having University degrees to obtain a recognition of whatever acquirements they may possess, and they enable parents to form an opinion of the value of the education which their children are receiving Our certificates are now required as a qualification for employment in the Civil Service, and the example of the Government in this respect is being adopted by the banks and other private mercantile establishments We are desirous, in the absence of a University in Queensland, and with your approval, to extend the advantages of our system to your colony, with which we are so closely connected, and in which we take so great an interest If our proposal is carried out examinations could be held in any towns in Queensland where a sufficient number of candidates presented the selves, simultaneous y with our own, the examination papers being the same as are set here, and the arrangements would be under the general supervision of some suitable person to be nominated by your Lordship | The examinations are conducted almost entirely by Dr Badham und myself, who have had a life long experience in work of this kind Since receiving instructions to address your Lordship on this subject I have learnt that there is a proposition to establish a University in Queensland My long experience and the opportunities which I have had of forming a judgment on this matter, may perhaps excuse my presumption in offering an opinion upon it I certainly think that the colony of Queensland is not yet sufficiently advanced to justify such an establishment It would be hardly yet justified in devoting to this object a sufficient sum to ensure the services of professors of the highest attainments, and with anything less than the highest a University would be more than useless We are willing and anxious to extend the advantages of this institution to the colony of Queensland, not only in the manner here suggested, but in any other also which your Lordship may suggest and which is not in violation of our statutes -I have, S.C , (Signed) M.

AN interesting account of a ghost in a gaol is given in the Standard of Uniontown Ponnsjl varna For the past four months the prisoners in the gaol at that place have made serious com- plumes of theconductofan evil spintwbohaunts the institution. It seemsthatwhentho townclook strikes 12 the ghost commences its nightly rounds through the gaol, making a peculiar noise He drags with him a chain over the iron grating which extends over the entire inside of the prison above the cells He then walks round the gaol outside, where the prisoners exe case in the daytime After making a thorough inspection of the building in this manner he unlocks the door and enters the inside of the grating which surrounds the cells He goes to every cell which contains a prisoner, and taking hold of the bar rattles it furiously After making the rounds of the upper cells, he descends to the lower tier and goes through the same performance, always dragging the chain after him The prisoners often speak to him, but can obtain no answer This state of affairs has caused a great deal of excitement about the Court house The sheriff and his deputies have made a rigid investigation, and have done their best by keeping lights burning all night to scare the ghost away, but in vain He still makes his nightly visitÂ«regularly, and the supernatural horrors of the gaol are said to add in no small degree to the pangs of captivity endured by its unfortunate inmates.
