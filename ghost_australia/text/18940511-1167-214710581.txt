? ,THE DAY-Oi 1 PENTECOST. « When the day of Pentecost was fully come, they were all with one accord in one plaCe."—Acta, i. 2. - ^ -- v Spirit most holv, Thou Sole fount of truth and bliss, Without whom nothing strong And nothing holy is *, As in the morning of its birth, Visit and bless the laboring earth. Brood, holy Dove Divide,, On this chaotic night, The formless void inspire With order, love, and light. ; Breathe a great calm, and at thy sway Let rude anarchic wills obey. Shake the dry bones that lie In Deatk's sepulchral reign; Come, wind of God and blow, Blow on the myruidB Blain. Let quickening nations feel the breath That dissipates the power of death. Rush suddenly from "heaven, In second Pentecost Of sound and ire; to atir Thy Church, O Holy Ghost: Faith, fervor, unction, utterance give ; And midst the years thy work revive. Leading and Light to Thee, And Thee alone, belong; Without whom nothing is Holy, arid nothing strong ; - Who still proceedest from the Throne Of God, and of the Lamb, alone. . All-holy Paraclete, Pure breath of Grod, and prime, Soothe the rebellious moods Of our disordered time ; Come as the Wind, the Fire, the Dove, With sevenfold grace the world to move. H. J. R. Marston, M.A.
