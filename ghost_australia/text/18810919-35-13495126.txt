VICTORIA HALL. On Saturday evening this place of amusement, in Castle- reagh-street, was opened by Mr. D'Arcy Read with his Ghost Company. The hall, which was formerly known as the Scandinavian Hall, has been repainted and decorated, and now forms a very commodious and pretty place of amusement, which will no doubt be much appreciated by the public. The performnnce on Saturday evening, making allowance for the deficiencies almost inevitable on an opening night, was well carried out, although the performers ought to remember that under the peculiar conditions in which they have to make themselves heard, it is necessary to speak and sing considerably louder than upon an ordinary stage. Much of the dialogue and nearly all the songs were nearly inaudible in many parts of the hall. The spectral part of the business was well done ,and the voices of the ghostly visitants to earth were much better heard that those of the flesh and blood representatives of humanity. The pro- gramme was a good one, consisting of "Beauty and the Beast," a well-arranged extravaganza, an illusory spectacle, "The Water Nymphs," and a laughable monologue, called "The Haunted House." It was well received by a large audience. how ",!" II,.,.,,! benn on ^ImïAf %»?»** f hw mil) inaimled.anl the acting of Mr i».,. Î.
