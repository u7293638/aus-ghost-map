PHOTOGRAPHY OF THE INVISIBLE. As a further explanation of the trick called ' spirit photography to which reference was made in our columns on Friday, we take the following from the Scientific Ama wan - The grand moral idea which science continually seeks to impress upon her votaries is humility of mind that inestimable virtue whence spring the noblest pleasures of the soul But how rare it is to find this beauty i ful quality even in persons of culture and learning The great doctors looked upon Galileo with contempt confined him in prison as a dangerous man and subjected him to the most ignominious treatment simply because he presented for their accept ance the light from a new idea which their dull perceptions were unable to appreciate He affirmed that the sun did not really rise or set that it was the rotation of the earth that brought day and night alternately upon the earth But the doctors I like many in our day, proud in their own conceit of knowledge knew better The J Scriptures tell us they said of the rising ?? and the setting sun therefore it moves our own eyes assure us of the fact the diurnal experience of many and confirms the truth our doctrine Galileo is false and dangerous It is in this style that some persons very knowing in their own esteem reason upon certain subjects lake spirit photography for an example They allege that spirits are invisible that an invisible thing cannot be photographed therefore the so called spirit photographs are base impostures It is not our purpose to dissent from the conclusion here assumed but we take exception to the premises which are not in agreement with science Photographs of some objects that are invisible to the human eye may undoubtedly be produced The spectrum of solar light is an example portions of which totally invisible to the eye are brought out upon the photographers plate and their presence is also demonstrated by other instruments The mental effect which we term light is supposed to be produced by the beating of waves of ether against the retina of the eye These waves enter the eye with an average velocity of about 180 600 miles in a second the length of the waves being variable from the one twenty seven thousandth part of an inch to one seventy five thousandth part of an inch. The retina therefore receives many billions of impressions in a second and it is supposed that it is the difference in the number and velocity of these impressions that produces in the mind the sensations of the colours If the waves which enter the eye have a much greater or a much less velocity than the limits above stated they do not it is supposed produce the sensation of light and the objects from which such rays come although they may really stand before the eye are as we say invisible But although they do not affect the eye they may impress the photographic plate which has no such constitution as the eye One of the most successful methods of producing spirit photographs is to place in front" of the sensitive plate within the plate shield a clear sheet of glass having nothing upon it except a thin positive of the spirit that is to be produced on the negative The portrait of the site is taken in the usual manner The light which enters the camera lens prints the sister and also the spirit which is on the thin positive upon the negative This is a very convenient method as it requires no manipulations likely to be detected and is we think the favourite lian practised by the best spirit photographers Prints made in this manner pass current among the believers for genuine ghosts of the deputed directly descended from heat on But a more new interesting and scientific method of producing sprint photo graphs is as follows -The plain background screen before which the latter is placed in order to have his portrait taken is to be painted beforehand with the form of the desired spirit the paint being composed of some fluorescent substance such as a solution of sulphate of quinine When this p tinting dues on the screen it is invisible to the eye but it sends out rays that have power to impress the photo plate and thus the image of the person together with the quinine (whose ire simultaneously developed upon the negative This is a very beautiful and remark] able metho 1 "Many people imagine," writes a home paper, " that since the siege of Paris the use of horseflesh has died out again. It is true that the 'boucheries hippiques' have disappeared from the fashionable quarters with other marks of the great siege, but during the first six months of the present year 5,18 animals have been sold for eating, which furnished 883,840 kilogrammes of meat, not including the heart, liver, brains, tongue, &c;, which are eaten like those of the ox. This is more than six times the amount sold in 1867, and nearly three times as much as was sold in the half-year before the war. The horses purchased for eating fetch a market price of £5 to £0. This new trade increases the value of used-up horses, not diseased, by more than £4 sterling, so that the public wealth of France is increased by about 16 millions by the admission of horseflesh into the public dietary."
