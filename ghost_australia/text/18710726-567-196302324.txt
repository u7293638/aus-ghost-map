Tbe Eoman Catholics of Hobart Town held a meeiicg on Sunday evening hut lor the purpose of expressing sympathy with Pope Pius IX. Tbe followioe resolutions were (says tbe Mercury) carried :— ' That we, the Catholics of the diocese of Hubart Town, in public, meeting uaembled, desire to record our feelings o! devo tion and attachment to Pius IX, tiie most beijigiiant of rulers and most illustrious of pontiffs, and to offer our sympathy toiiim in his present afflictions, with a hope that, as be bae been spared to see the years of Peter iu tbe K'jroan Pontificate, he may ere long be witness of the triumph of the Cberco, and tbe reestab lishment of tbe temporal sovereignty of the Po;«dom.' 'Tnat we indignantly protest against the inrasioo acd violent annexation of iLe patiimony of Peter by tbe troops of Victor Ftmnyn-afi as a violation of -international law, as a sacrilege, as wholesale plunder, and as an injustice TrHfH^-i not only ob the Roman p-opie, but on tbe whole Catholic -world.' 'TLat we regard tbe temporal sovereignty of tbe Pope necessary to the free and unimpeded exercise of his sacred functions as head of the Church and Father of 200.000,000 Catholics.' ' That fuliy penvaded of the duiiUdty of the Florentine Government in regard to the so called Papal guarantees, which manifestly they have not the right to propose, nor the power to execute, we are more than ever convinced of the necessity of redoubling our efforts for tbe success of the Peter's Pence Association, estab lished in this diuoeee last year, on the Feast of SS. Peter and Paul' An address in Latin, j embodying the grintuneut* of the resolctioDi j was adapted, and it was resolved that it should ! be forwarded u- the Pope by the next mail. ! A daring attempt at murder by poisoning ja j reported fmm Bathurst. According to there- ! ports of what transpired at the magisterial '? investigation, it appears that a domestic ser. I vaot named EUen KyaD, in the employ of '? Thomas Denny, ironfonnder, waa charged with - administering strychnine, or causing H to be i administered, to Peter Gibbons, in tbe same ! employ. A person, believed by tbe assistant ' at tbe shop of Mr. Buttenvorib, chemist, but : not positively identified, as prisoner, called on \ the evening of the 3rd inst and obtained twenty ' grains of strychnine, which ahe wanted to send ! to a friend in tbe couatry, in order to kill ? native cats. The bottle was labelled ' poison.' ? It oeems that (he had not given satisfaction to Mrs. Denny, and bad received notice at tbe end of tbe previous month to gait her service, and some angry feeling was displayed towards her mistress. She was away from tbe bouse on the evening of the 3rd, and returned about f nine o'clock. On the 4th, she cleaned the ' |iaotry, end cooked the dinner, consisting of ] roast beef and baked potatoes.
