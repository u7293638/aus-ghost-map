Ghosts in the Kitchen- " There are eboste in the kitchen, fir,* 1 was tbe extraordinary announcement made by a cook last night to her master, jabtas he was sitting down to dinner. The vein an, pale with fright, nearly dropped the soup which sLe was bringing to the table. Her a tradesman in tbe Rue da Bac, wondering what was the matter, walked with his ooweriog cook to tbe kitchen, and there eaw to his astonishment that the chairs and tables were violently oscillating, tbe cupboards were also shaking, until it seemed as if the *pirit£ had really taken possession of the kitchen in order to bold a seance there. The tradesman then returned to the dining-room amazed, and hardly had he resumed his eeat when the chairs, tables, sideboard, and in fact all the furniture began to vibrate around him. He immediately surmised that tbe whole hou>e was coming down, so he rushed out to consult oae of bis neighbors, who is aa architect. Tbe Utter returned with him to tbe dwelling, and found that it was gradually coming down. The police were then communicated with, and tb? tottering habitation was cleared of all its inmates. This morning props were put up to support tbe house, which is one of the oldest in. the district.— Daily Tdegrapfit Paris cor- respondent.
