a story with a moral. Two frogs fell into a dish of milk. One df the frogs was of the despairing, helpless .kind. He battled for some time, and then coming to the con- elusion that the fates were against him,- he gave up tiie struggle and the ghost at tiie same time. The other frogwae a more optimistic individual. He had no idea of giving in so long as he could make a fight for existence. . He therefore struck out briskly, and kept going so long that at last he found himself landed high and dry upon a pat of butter. He had worked, or rather churned, out iiis own salvation. Now, this frog tale has a moral and it is thus given by a Queensland journal : â€” The moral of this story lieth in the. application thereof.
