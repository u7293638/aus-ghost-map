HOW THE SNOD LASS RADE TO SCARTOP. By HALLTWELL SUTCOFFE, AuthoV of 'Riecroft of Wit'hens,' 'Most and Fell,' &c.; [Published by special arrangement with th« author. All rights reserved.] Now, I ask all folk that hev getten a head-piece to their shoulders— did iver a plain man, 'born an' bred on Mar&cotea; Moor, set himself up for a story- teller? A' story-teller i' print, I'm meaning; for that's a different matter fro' an odd crack or s» i' £h' ingle-nook after supper, when a pipe is toward, and may be a pint of ale at a man's ' elbow. 'But that ever I. Eohi'aim. Scull, reared on Marshcotes Moor, should sit inyseln dahn to spell out? wi' my girt, gaumless fis't, a story for t' fancy chaps w'hat reads i' books— nay, it do beat all! But tV young maister, I'd hev ye know, is by way o' being a hectoring sort o' chap: he mun hev this an' he mun hev that, an it's precious poor meat ye get for your supper if ye run agen 'him. Not but Xyhdt I'm a thowt fond o' Maisfter Townend1— Ted Townend, o' Scartop Hoiise; ye'll bis knowing him?— ^Not but that I'm a tfiawfc fond o' the' lad, an' would iig'ht onybodvj that said he warn't th' straigh test-set-up c'hap we've getten 'hereabouts. Oh, ay, he's all that; ah' when he came bo me a neet or two back, while I war storing tum niits i' th' sihed, an' said I war to writo dahn all 'at I could think on a'bout how ha went sweetheai-ting— -well, I war fair cap ped, as th' saying is. I -war t'hat put out by th' bare notion o' me marlaking wi' ?written speech, that I let an armful o' tum'mits I war hugging drop to th' gruncf. But young mais'ter wodn't hearken to no sort o' reason, an' at th? last of all, just for t'h' sake o' getting shut on him, T promised I'd frame as weel as I knew how. An' that's how I, Ephraim Scull, iborni an' bred o' godly parents, come to 'be wast ing a fooil's time for them other fooils as cannot ge't a plain meaning out of a plain tiling, saving they see ic i' print. But Lord bless ye, th' young maister'wod hev: it so, an' so there's an end on't. Just sich a likely un as his lather afore him, war young Tom Tov.nend; big an,' bluff, wi' a ye-may-do-as-ye-please sort o' style, for all th' world as though Alarsh cotes, an' Ling Crag, an' right away to Lan.' caehire, war made just for him an' nobody else. An' lie sprawled into love, did th' lad, wi' owd Squire Danehohne's daughter 0' Saxilton. An' that's what I'll be tellina ye about i' a while, if ye'll nobbut give a houeyt man time to spread hi.s elbows. A fearful proud lot bhey war, th' Dane liolmea, wi' a mucky sort o' pride that hedn't n'o kinship wi' th' stiff-standing pride o' th' Townends. But Miss pane holme — Gertrude her name war, all i' th' grand folks style— warn't like th' rest o'. the breed; she'd gotten a warm heart an' a ?? bonnie face, an' a right gooid wife she's shown herself to young maister, an' a right good mother -to th bairns. An' there I go, fair gaumless like, telling th' end o' th' tale afore iver I've hitcheq t'h' harness on 'to th' beginning. Nay, I'm 1 poor niak' of a storj^teller; I'm a sight better at mowing a swathe, an' it do seeni a sin to turn your hand to otiier wark than th' Lord meant ye for. But, howiver, that may be, I've gebten to mow that acre or so 0' written speech, choose how I fash myseln i' th' doing on't. ' - How Maister Tovnend came to get speech o' Miss Diineholme, fair at th' start of all, is more nor I can tell ye; though' I've bit of a fancy that it war poaching that first took him Saxilton way. An? if I tell ye that young Tom Townend war a rare hand at th' poaching, I'd hev ye to understand that lie war Mar9hcotes bred. I've heard tell 'at they think shame, dahn i' th' valleys, if a man goe4 taking game fro' another man's land; bul up Marshcotes way we're getten a bit o sense, an' we can see plain as a pikestaff 'at there's no more liana i' taking, say, Squire Daneholme's game, nor if you or ma war to pluck a flower growing by th' way? side. I wodn't say it war th' poaching thau first brought 'em together, an' 1 wpdn't say it warn't. All I know is, they got fearful fond one o' th' other, Maister Townend an' young Miss Daneholme: an* they used to met here an' there i' th' Saxil ton woods, as thick an' lonely a bit o' Bweetheartia' grund as they need want. They war fair dafit-like,' th' two young folk; but I warn't by way o' being hard on 'em, seeing I war nobbut a kittling myseln »? them days, an' fond to run after th. wenches. But it war a pity to see th way th' maisfter went off his victuals; a properer man you wodn't be like to see non Tom Townend afore he fell in wi Miss Gertrude— but now he war thin as a mous D I looked him ower, whiles, .when h« thowt I warn't looking, an' I wished he 4 get agate an' wed th' lass; ay, that I did, for all I war noan so set on having a vain? sue at Scartop. Women is a sight too . up- an'- dahn for % plain man's fancy-: 'specially when he's ewer fond o' them to be just easy i' his judgment— an' Tc-m Townend an' me hed done varry weel, at OopjTijrht in the United States of America bz D. T. Pierce, —r' * no maister and mlan, this five year ?back, ivet ein* W old folk died an' left us to 't. February, I mind, war a fearful -wet ?'un Wi'at year. It rained, an' it rained, till fye'd have thowt 'at -th' sky war fair (squeezed dry by th' time Thursday night jcome. Valentine'* Day, it war, for I jihedn'1t mich sense then, an: I mind me I Bent a daft sort o' Gweetheartiug token to -Betty o' the Nalb. I'd getten. th' cows Jmilked by 6 o'clock, an' I war_ just sitting ane dahn, easy like, when 1 heard a eham im'ocky step outside. Shep, th' dog, didn't growl, n'o&but; gave a short sort o' bavk, an' laid his ears back; so I knew 'at it must be th' maister. I ran dahn to th' door to see Vi'hat war agate, an' th' maister topped up th' two or three steps an' into th' kitchen. '! 'What'e agate?' says I, wondering at th' whiteness of his face. 5 'I've broken my ankle,' said th' maister, j&ort; an' sharp, wiJ a wry twist to ? his mouth. : I, . 'An' how did ye do't?' I axed. ' ' 'Jumping 'the wall at the bottom of Sykes' Meadows. I'd been after the sheep, and— here, Ephraim, I'm going sill? — letcn a drop ot 'brandv, and be sharp albout it.' Well, th' maister, afore I could tak a (step to do his bidding, tumbled off his jchair on to th' floor, an' I grew mortal jSeared all on a sudden. I got th' brand y, an' I shoved a drop or so in atween his ?teeth; then a drop more. An' last of all Ihe oppens his een i' a dazed, feckless way, an', 'What's been die matter, Ephraim?' Bays he, weak as a babby. ?: 'Nay, tha't's more nor I cau tell,' says I. 'Ye've happened a tunnble, an' a bad ,-un. too, by th' look on?t, for ve fell all in ? ' He sits up at that, an' he gies me a Book that struck me fair like th' blow of a malleft. 'Nonsense,' sa3's he. ''You're a fool, Ephraim. I never fainted in. my life. Do you think I'm a woman?' ' 'Kay.' ye're noan bonnie enough for that,' I says wi' a laugh, seeing 'at he war right sore about th' thing. An' he laughs an' all wi' a jerk at th' lend of his laugh; an' I saw 'at his foot ,'war hurting an' proper. 'Ye'll be heving th' doctor, happen?' eays I. 'Doctor be hanged,' he cries. 'Get me eome cold water and a rag. It'll be all light in the morning.' J ' They allus war an obstinate lot, them .ffownends; though I'm not saying that I get such fearful store by doctors myseln. jHow it would hev ended I'm noan for «ay jing, if there hedn't come a knock at th' j door — a thundering iknocfc, fit to ibreak tV door in. Shep sets up a fine to-do, whac ,sri' 'barking an' growling, an' I gav him a Kick as I went to oppen 'th door, just to 'tell ikini to .wait till his betters had taVn etoek o' th' stranger. Now I've seen mony a queer sight sin' I war put into breeks; but th' queerest of all, to my thinking, war th' chap that stood i ?th'pelting rain on th' doorstun o' Sear ,top House. Eh, he war a lad! A six footer or so, wi' sick a mak o' clothes ae jnade a Christian laugh to see 'em. A ^ink jacket he hed, all soaked wi' watter, in' tight black breeks, an' black stockings. ijSe -war just streaming, an' all down th' lace of him ran streaks o' eome white stuff, that hed come, I've a fancv. fro' his hair. 'i. ?could mak nowt on th.' lad, niver heving Ihed mich -to do wi' them as isn't right r th' top story; so I lets 3iim shove past me, *n' into th' kitchen. iU^Waiat a night! I'm wet to the bone,' ^aye -he. He talked i' th' same clipped atyle as the maister, only it didn't sound as natural-like. . rt Then he sees th' maister — th' gteam fro' his clothes had Winded him afore — an' he dotis This hat mighty respectful. 'XJood evening, Dalton,' says th' mais ter, wi' another twinge at th' pain- he war suffering. 'Have you come from Miss paneholnie?' he says, a minute at after. *i 'Yes, sir. I've come with this letter.' Th' maister toot th,' letter an' oppened it rare* an' quick. I watched his face, an' I «aw th' 'blackness rush into it, same as I've seen it do when one o' th' farm lads im^fht be driving a crooked furrow. Then he tried to smootfh his mouth out, an' look pleasant, all i' th' Rente's way when ^there's summat distressful abroad. ?' I bethought me this fine bird, wi' all his feathers rained on, mud be the mak o' kfhap they -call footmen; an' why they call ,f-em by t'hat name is because they've nowt jU* do save unbuckle t'heir master's shooin, an' happen run on odd jobs now an' again by way o' extra wark. (? IWellj he ate like a gooid 'un, ?whether ihe warked mich or no. I saw th' maister keep looking at him, as if he wished he War onywhere save i' th' kitchen o' Scar 'fcop 'House, till at last he'd etten 'has fill. (ffh' maister 'heaved a big sigh at that, an** pupped summat into his hand, an' sent him 'off.iback, double quick, to where he come fro' — an' tJhat war Saxilton, a matter o' 'Six gooid miles, if I knew owt o' th' -way Sings hed been shaping themselves o' ? 'lEphraim,' says th' maister, sooin as (iBi' door war shut behind him, 'you've got to ride to Beech Close to-night.' He ; looked at th' grandfather's clock stand ing i' th' chimtiley corner, an' screwed up his -mouth as tight as a button. 'I give iyou 'half an hour to do it in, and ttiat . jwiU be good riding on a night like this.' f I'm noan so set on th ride,' says I, short-like, for I war stalled o' racketting albout, as a man is like to be when he's been on his feet sin' afore daybreak. ; 'I daresay you're not,' he says, wi' a grin. 'If 1 could have ridden a -horse .it aH, you'd have been saved the journey; 'as it is, you'll have to go. Call at the doctor's on your way and ask him to step round as soon as lie can.' t- ''An' what mun I do when I've getten ito Beech Close?' I asks. ' 'He telled me what I'd getten to do, an' it fair made me. dither all ower to think :fcv1iat a plain man may be brought to, once be take service under a maister that's keen feet on th' wenches. r. Well, th' doctor war i' th' house, an' rit telled him what war agate at Scartop fiHouse; an' 'then off sets I for Beech Close, ?tola maister had telled me to. But I didn't ifike th' job; an' I liked it less th' nearer 1 J got to any journey's end. j- I'd no /sooner 'brought th' mare up to th' gate that oppens ui'to th' wood than I ! beam a lass's voice eoft as a throstle's i' Spring-time. [r 'Is that you, Tom?' says she. V Eh, but I felt a right dofty, an' that's plain truth I'mi telling ye. There war Mi«s Daneholme, pretty, an' slum, an' aain'tyJborn; one eide o' th? gate; an' on S other war Ephraim Scull, thinking as dV be should fliev been young Tom Town ad, an' -warn't. 'Nay,' eays I. my ihearfc i' my mouth. 'Tin noWbut Ephraim Scull, an' I've been fcent 'by t!i' young maister to fetch ye up tO Scartop.' ' «* . (She gave a cry at that, fair like a cat that has lost its ki'ttlings. 'Sent you to fetch pa?' ehe cries, all as proud as may be. , 'Ay,' I says; 'he's happened a fall, an' fa foot is tib&t; bad that he duran't trust biswln to ride.' __^ ? Is he— has Ihe hurt himself badly?' says she, all i', a fi'tter. 'Yes, I know he lias, or he would Jhave come. Take me to him. Take me to him, do you hear?' She war ower th' gate by this time, an' pa'tting th' grey mare's neck. 'Ami to n-et up be hind? she asks, wi' a laugh that warmed a body's innards. ., 'AJf- for ««re,' says 1, an' I war. just thinking how bonnie th' lass war, an' what a dainty, soft piece o' goods th' maister ned gi en into my charge, when there comes a sound o' crackling twigs behind 'Hueh,' says she, i' a whisper; an' she springs up behind, an' puts her arms round my neck, an'. away we clatters up th' road. . 5t°P» or 111 shoot!' cries a voice be nina. 'Go on,' eays th' lassie, an' my heart waums to her pluck. «a^He, dFsn-t shooit, not he,' I says. That a Squire Daneholme, if I know owt; dost think he'll shooft his own daughter?' savs I, wanting to comfort her. 'He would shoot ihe horse,' she whis pers, wi a sort o' dryness i' her voice booner than let me go -where I mean tc' go to-night ihe will .shoot.. Faster, man, taster! Once round the bend, and we arc safe/' 'But th' owd squire war noan th' man to drop lead into onybody fro' behind, let alone th fact that he mud hev hit th' lassie i mistake for th' horse. He cursed an swore at us to a rare tune; but thai war all. An' away we galloped, fast as lver fh grey mare could set shooin to grund, for Marshcotes village. Now, I'm noan for denying that a 'bonnie wench is a bonme wench, an' may be I war a thmvt softer i tV heart i' them days; but,T3iat Jiowsonuver, long afore we'd getten a -milf on our road, I war fast coming to tell my seln that Scartop House mud hev a war mistress nor th' snod, game lass 'behind me. An while we're galloping, I mud as wee! put in a two or three -words about th' let ter young -maister 'hed getten fro' Miss Daneholme. If ye've bided tnis long wi' a plain makeshift of a tale ye'll happen not mind i'f I stop ye a while fair i' th' middle. Squire Daneholme hed getten wind o' th' sweethearteng i' Beech Close, an' he an' his daughter hed a rare set to about young Tom Townend; th' lass said she'd niver give 'him up, an' 'th' father swore she should; an' at lli' end of all he just cornea to her one afternooin an' tells her she mun come off right away -m' him to th' Low Country. Two hours he gav her to pack up her fal-lals an' her bundles; for he -w-ir going to Lunnon by th' night-coach fro' Jieatneiey, seeing as he'd some mak o' business on hand that'hed called him away i' a hurry. Well, sihe knew they'd a plan for wed ding her to chap i' Lunnon, an' it seemed she d getten to mak a 'bold bid for Tom Townsend or lose him for iver. So what does 4,'he do, being a shade thowtless like., an tigh- sperrited too, but she .writes a let ter to th young maister, saying as how she'd be waiting for him i' Beech Close, an' away sTie slips to th' wood afore iver they hed time to miss iher. She dursn't tak a horse, for fear o' their seeing Sher; an' a drear time ih' poor wench mun hev hed, earring under th wall i' th' wind an' th' rain; ¥or I warn't «o handy -wi' horse flesh as Maister Townend, an' it took me a good twenty minutes longer nor him tp cover ift' seven miles betwixt (Scartop an' Saxilton. iBut there she war, an' i' there war I at last, an' all -war going weel if »sve could noWbut -win to Marshcotes i' safety. Summat seemed to stir i' th' -lass's mind afore -we'd getten far— a thought of her mother, maybe, or some 6ich softness as maids do think of at sich times — men an' all, for that matter, though they hev a way of not owning up to 't. Ony road, she nipped frer arms tighter about my neck, an' 'Ephraim,' she says, soft as a ssnowflake, 'it s a big change for me. I've had no time to think about it until now.' She war happen readier to talk so to a plain man, because Ephraiai Scull, what wi' one thing an' another, war no stranger to her. 'Nay,' saye I, 'we've getten a saying hereabout that there's bettering i' chang ing, if it's nobbut out o' th'^beck into th' burn. Ye'll be fain o' this night's wark, an' it's Ephraim Scull wHS's telling ye.' She seemed to pluck up heart at th' words, an' i' a minute ehe war laughing, eweet and quiet like. An' then she fetch ed a deepish breath, for through th' murk an' th' wind we could hear th' beat of a ?hoss's ihoofe behind us. dap-clap, scat ter-ecatter, came th' sound, an' I hed a sort o' foreknowledge 'at it war th' owd squire we d gerten to deal wi ; though low he'd lighted on a horse to carry ihim, an' almost owerta'en us into t' bargain, all i' this short while, war more nor I could shape to myseln. I made th' owd grey mare sit up a tidy bit, ye're thinking? Well, ye're noan far wrong. She racketted forrard, I've a fancy, at a smarter pace nor shed «et her legs to this three-year back. But th' squire war better mounted, an' his horse hed nobbut one to carry, an' he gained on us fast. 'Will ihe catch us do you think?' aeka Miss I-aneholme, eteady an' quiet. 'Just about,' says I, reckoning th' gooid mile an' more that lay betwixt us and Scar top House. An' ?while I war reckoning, an' ponder ing how to get out o' th' scrape, an' run ning this way an* that i' my .plans, like a rat that's caught i' a trap — thinking be ing nowt so mich i' my line, an' niver lead ing me straight— all of a sudden there conies into my girt, gaumless ihead, some where fro' th' back-end o' nowhere, a right proper notion — a notion that made me fetch a rare crack o' laughter. 'Look ye here, 'Miss Gertrude,' says I, sooin' as I. could fit a heft o' -word6 on to th head of a plain- idea. T.he maister he lied it i' mind to keep th' owd doctor at Scartop till ye came; an' th' doctor ?war to tak ye to his house i' Marsncote?, where his missus 'ud look after ye till th' license caarie, an' so give no occasion for tongues to wag. Now, we'll best th' squire for a bit yet— say, as far as Marsli cotes Omrch.' 'And 'he'll catch us before we reach the moor, and then what better oS shall we be?' says she, with a laugt at my dull ?wittedness. 'Well, I'm thinking that th' doctor lives half way up th' main street,' 6ays I very slow, 'an' if ye elip off a't his doorstun an' leave Ephraim Scull to settle wi' th' squire ? ' ''Yes, yea I' she cries, all up on tSi' plan i' a minute, afore she'd rightly considered it — it e th' way o' wenches, I've notice)!. 'I see!' ehe cries. 'And -then tJie doctor will take me to see Mr. Townend later in ?the evening? Why, TSphraim, you -have a prettier wit than anyone suspected.' 'Noan so bad,' I mumbled, not being one o' them softies what hearkens to aH a pretty la«s says, same as if it 'war gospel truth. But she'd a taking way wi Iher, Jied th' maid, for all that. 'It will be bad for you,' says she, after a while. 'He must have seen me mount behind you.' 'Nay, that le dida't, for I turned me J round when fee offered to shooit, an' it war ower dark to see him; he heard th' clatter o hoofs, an 'he .guessed ye .war off to th' young maister, an1 it war just a mak o' Sf^rjP a* made -him say -he'd shooit. Sfcooit? He couldn't lev hit a house i' aH that rain an' darkness. Likely lie «? *jSt ^^ M a Bun wi' him, nawther.' And I thought you were so brave about Jiiphraim; youVe spoiled' your reputation!' Jiiss dertrude war by way o' being mighty gay, for all she'd left home for gooid an' all to trust to one of us poor, weak men folk. 1 ve a tidy bit o caution, an' I've noan so snick life left i' me 'at I can afford to epill -ony. An' now we'll hev to mak th' owd grey mare to more nor s'he's a mind to, for tfhere's «auire just close on our heels,. I fancy. We'd getten to th' bottom o' Marsh cotes, wheer t' paving-stuns begin to scat ter up as far as th' Bull Inn. I could just hear th squire's horse behind us, an' I walloped th' owd grey mare summat shameful, an' we pulled up afore Xh' doc tor s doorstun i' a fine aniick to' sweat. Miss Gertrude slips off i' a jiffy, an' creeps to one side o' tth' doctor's girt red lamp, an' Squire Danelholme, niver cjap ping so mich as th' tail of 'his een on lier, iollow8 plain Ephraim Scull -hard up th main street. An' by-an'-bye lie catches me up, ^an lays a iiand on th grey mare's bridle. . 'Stop there!' he cries, i* -his big, bluster ing way. vi rIt'fia ^ft D'g111*. squire,' says I, daft like; ower soft to keep a man fro' his bed. What mud ye be after?' He peers this way an' that into th' dark, after -he d made sartin sure there war no wench behind me. Then he swears, soft like, to bisseln. An' all th' while I sat on tn o_wd grey mare's back, an' laughed to myseln so I shook. ? 'xm?t?rV' «ries tn' sauire, at last of all. What am I after, man? Tm1 after mv daughter, confound her!

Th' owd grey mare* yell be knowing, is noan so fond o' letting herseln be overta'en; so we kept th' lass ibehind ug all th' way, until we got to Marshcotes 'Main-street; an' there I lost her. An' if ye've owt else to ask, squire, I'll be proud to give ye an answer; an' if so be 'at ye haven't, I'll -be wending home, for it's wet enough to flair a duck.' Ay, off you go, and welcome. Lost her in Marshcotes, you say? Are there any short cuts to the moor that way, without coming up to the top of the street bere?' 'There is a short cut, but a powerful rough road it be, squire. Fair at th' bot tom o' th' hill ye'll find a bridle-track pull ing sharp away to th' right hand. That'll tak ye fair on to Marshcotes Moor.' He stops a half minute, anebbe, then turns round on me, sudden an' sharp. 'Which is the shortest cut to Tom Town end's?' ,says he, i' th' fashion o' one 'at Tips maAt* un ?iic min^ Now I know not— nor iver shall I know — what mak o' foolishness came over me. Happen I thowt it 'ud be better for th' young maister if I took th' squire straight to his doorstun, an' showed him th' lad iigging lame— ower lame for marlaking after wenches. Happen it war just a taste for devilry, sich as is bred i' th' bone of us Marshcotes chape. Howiver, that be, I up an' said as how I war Tom Town end's manj an' main proud l'd be to tak th' squire to Scartop House myseln. He looks twice at me at that, an' seems to think better of bis plan, seeing me so quiet and gaumless. There warn't no mouse-holes aibout Ephraim Scul], an' ye couldn't hey clapped een on a- chap who looked less Jike to carry off a bonnie wench. 'Where is your master to-day?' says th' squire. ? , 'lagging on 'tSi' lang-settle wi' a broken ankle -Mien 1 left home. It war for medi cine an' sich-like 'at I rade ower to Saxil ton,' I says, telling myseln 'at Miss Ger trude, God bless her, war th' best medi cine I could hev {brought him. Th' squire, after being i' two minds for awhile., turns his horse round all on a sudden, mutters a good-night, an' away back he goes down Marshcotes main street. An' Ephraim Scull wended home, laughing quiet Tike to bisseln an' telling 'th' owd grey mare 'at shed done a bonnie bit o' wark for th' maister. An' that's about all I've getten to tell ye. Tom Townend war Iigging i' th' kit chen when I got ?home, wi a lot o' ban dages wrapped round his foo'c. Main put about he was when he saw 'at I'd come alone, but it didn't tak long to sbow him wbidh' way tV wind blew fro', an' he laughed past all as I sat me dahn i' th' ingle-nooOk an' telled him th' tale. They kept Miss Gertrude well hid at tfli' doctor's un'cil Maister Townend could get a license; an' they were wedded i' th' owd Parish Church, wi' tfe' stocks outside to point 'em to th' sober side o' wedlock, an' I couldn't rightly say 'at they've bad a wrong word iver since. There's a young Tom Townend now, rising -twenty, an' th mais'ter hes grown to be old Tom Townend, though he's nobbut five-an'-forty or there abouts; an' ?tihere's a snod little lassie, shoulder-high, an' bidding fair to look th pictur 0' what 'her mother war when slie rade behind me that night on th' owd grey mare. An' if there be ony fooila i' th' country-side what mats' a talky-talk about th' littleness an* th' wrang%eadedness o' women, send 'em trapesing across tV moor. to Ephraim Scull; an' first that same .Ephraim 43c.ull, being a plain man an' used to plain ways, will clout their lugs right soundly— an' 'at after, that Ihe'll talk n power o' gooid strong sense to 'em. For it's plain to be seen tSiere's - been nowt better nor a woman sin' th' world war a world at all. An' them's my notions, choose who hears me say 't. . ' Next Wee/k— THE OAJKLETGH GHOST, By A.
