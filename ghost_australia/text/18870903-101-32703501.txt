AN INDIAN GHOST STORY. ÁfaJceer, who is said to have lived on tonne of intimacy with a ghost for upwards of twenty-four years, arrived here, saya the Cal- cutta Daily News, from Bungpore recently, accompanied hy his friend, a ghost, and is putting up in a garden house in Bum Dom, belonging to Baboo Gum Prosonno Ghose. Between 5 and t> p:m. there was a small friendly gathering at No 1 Jorabagan, the town house of Baboo Guru Prosonno Ghose. Baboo Dnkhina Bnnjun, a wealthy eemindar of Bnugpore, *ras one of the party, "The ghost happens to be an old acquaintance of this gentleman, and was introduced by him many, years ago to the late Bajab Baroda Kant Bahadoor. Many were the uiterviews which both the Bajan and Baboo Dukhina Eunjun bad with the spirit in days gone.byi _ The spirit is said to be .under great obliga-i tiona, to 'Baboo1 Dukhiba; Bunjim, !for .at the', spirit Vreguest or recommendation,' the' Baboo ha^m^é'ttíe pre'áent of a^^WtikßaÜsef, the friend ind" travelling companion of "tim ghost, yielding an leoine of ^Î^OO rdpe'és"; per .Mmeamj »Weh «ie ' fdËfer:*«W enjoyé Baboo/»nkhina^Bnnjnk beHeved -theghost;' could not have! forgotten this.

Up to 1 a-m. all efforts to extract a word from the spirit were of no avail, until the most earnest supplica- tion of Baboo Dukhina E un j un, asking for the spirit's blessings, met with-the response, " Go with my blessings," uttered in a deep and resounding tone, and seeming to come from the branch of a tree. As soon as the ghost is found more desirably communicative, the public will be duly informed of it. Dr. Sircar, we bear, has been already invited.
