SOMETIME. Sometime, in spite of all you crave And all you vow to-day, This loss will fill a weedy grave, Left far on life's highway. This love will be the kindest ghost Laid on sweet mom'ry 'sbreaat j I leave you, deaf to all you coast, Well knowing ilia best. Somotiruo, in Hpito of all your fears, You will forgot this day, Or think of it in future yearB As ono vague yesterday, Crowned With a story, half of pain And half of joy maybe — As, on tho hilla, faint misty rain Hlended with, iioanis, wo seo. So, thinking of that somotime day, Forgive this hour of pain ; - Some morning, on the future's way, We'll meet as friends again. Others havo parted aB wo part Whoso eyes to-day aro dry ! I do nob feur-your broken heart, — Forgive mo ... . and go?d- bye !
