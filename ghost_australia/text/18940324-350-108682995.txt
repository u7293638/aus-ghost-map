Leaves from a Scrap Book. THREE TIMES THREE." BY THOMAS LOVE PEACOCK. "In his last' binn, Sir Peter lies, Who knew not what it was to frown ; Death took him, mellow, by surprise, And in his cellars stopped him down. Through all our land we could not boast A knight more gay, more prompt than he To rise and fill a bumper toast, And pass it round, with THREE TIMES THREE. None better knew tlie feast to sway, Or keep Mirth's boat in better trim ; For Nature had but little clay Like that of which she moulded him. The meanest guest that graced his board Was there the freest of the free ; His bumper toast, when Peter poured And passed it rouhd with THREE TIMES THREE He kept at true good humour's mark- . The social flow of Pleasure's tide ; He never made a brow look dark, Nor caused a tear, but when he died. No sorrow round his tomb should dwell; More pleased his pay old ghost would be, For fUneral song and passing bell, To hear no sound but THREE TIMES THKEE." The exquisitely tender idea oF not having "caused n tear, but when ho died," occurs in Be ranger's celebrated Roi d'Yvetot. The song which first made him famous. It may be doubted, how ever, if Peacock had seen it before he composed " Sir Peter." Thackeray said that Pcacock's songs were among the best of the age. Peacock was nn old-fashioned scholar and gentlcmon of the old school. lie was heretical on the subject of Tenny son and living poets generally. lie died at Shep perton. early in 1866, having reached his 81st year.
