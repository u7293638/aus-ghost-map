An ambeican Sensation Notei. — The following ig positively an. extract from 'Inside Out,' an American novel, of which the New York papers speak highly. It must be admitted that the Britishers cannot compete with this sort of thing : — ' A reverie coursed through their frames, and fondled, with a gentle toying, the rich energy of latent exul tation. Dreams swayed the plastic mind, and, with, them, in an atmostphere of spirit-dew, the cloudless regions rolled back falsity and revealed truth. TSow came, in the attire of simplicity's sweefa offspring, the fresh blushes of a modest love-birth ; cooing homage and expressing charity in spotless raiments. Gome anew the rarest evidences of concealed humanity, clothed in the cobwebs, of a silken virtue. Gome once more, in passive silence, the emotions of a filial sacrifice; no longer chained to earth's dull rounds, but mounting in exalted purity the throne of rap turous reward. . . Threatening vice proclaims a battle, and the waif-like menials burst rude cares, and lash on desperately lagging fiends. A brimstone moment flashes sacrifices and derision mocks at truth. Sepulchral ghosts hug madness with a scrawny power. Bones leave flesh and crimp the vitals. Hags suck blood and mark fresh game. A yawning chasm laps pale agony, and lunatics grasp, clutch and stagger under frenzied influences. . . Back stagger dungeons ! Vamp the flame with hill tops of volcanic ashes. Sour, stale, sad silence scara sorrow, and o'erleap the heaviest evidences of unknown, sardonic Samsons. Crush hope, stamp villany, sway existenoe.' Gteeek Fiee. — The term 'Greek Fire,' as applied to the substance which the Federals are pouring into Charleston, is strictly- a misnomer. The secret of the manufacture of the original Q-reek fire has been lost for nearly 950 years, and it is probable that it will not again be found, seeing that modern chemistry suggests agents quite as dangerous, and perhaps, simpler, than the original. Its modern represent^-, tive, although intended for the same purpose, is dif ferent in character, more portable, more certain, mora terrible. It is a fluid substance, is cheaply made, keeps for years, and is produced so quickly that the ingredients of which it is composed may be put together at the moment when the compound is re quired. In using the liquid it has to be enclosed in a shell which snail burst at a given point ot destina tion, and allow the fluid to be distributed. The con struction of modern liquid fire is based on simple scientific principles, and more methods than one may be discovered for producing it. The old Greek firs is supposed to have included asphaltum, sulphur, and. 1 aitre in it» composition,
