THE SILENT SPKCTIIE; 'Twos an Egyptian custom, in tho ages that aro gone, ; . That at each fettivs roard thonld sit a shrouded skeleton ; And, little M we dream of it, tho custom still goes on. ' For though, amid hit warriors, the Tyrant sits And quafl*, upon hi« vurplo throne, to their last victory. Still near him sitstuo Skeleton — dumb tongucd Conspiracy. The Poet, too; who toils for all— whoso heart eschews' delights — Who lives laborious dnys, and gives to solemn 'thought hit nights— Sees tho grim Skeleton — the world with icorn bis lore requites The Beauty, in her flush of bloom, whoso bright ' snd perfect charms Enslaves tho panting heart of youth, and e'on tho aged warms, Thinks on that ghsitly Skeleton— Old Age and shrivt'llrd arm-. Th« Merchant, 'mid his cringing clerks, that wait upon his eye, Whoso very heart is casdo in gold, has still that Ppoctre nigh — A grinning, scornful, mockory — friend-freeiing Bankruptcy. The Mother with hor darling child, whoso bud ding charms begin : To show the opening of a flower fairer than all her kin, . Still trembles at tho Skeleton— the child may'die, . ' ,er sin! ? And not one living child of earth can from its ; presence fly j It enters with us at our birth, is with as whon wit die ; For within us 'dwelli the Skeleton — unseen by ? human eye. Oh Conscience! silent spectre, awful presence ' or the Past! Thon terror of tlio Future, whn«o gnzo makes ' mid-night ghost!. Thou loiterer with tho lounger, and thnu rider with the fast!' ' ? . ? Thus 'he old Egyptian custom of a Skrlcton . nlway Pitting vailed at every fcative board, as a check upon the Ray, Has been from the Creition, and will last to , Judgment Day,
