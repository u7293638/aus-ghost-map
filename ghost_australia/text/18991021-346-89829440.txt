■''■TEE TERRORS OF DARKNERR "With what terror must our savage fore fathers have looked forward to the coming winter, with its cold, its dreadful darkness, its loneliness, its prowling enemies, and raven ing beasts ? What must it have been in the Middle Ages, and right down to the last cen tury, when fireplaces in the houses were very | few, and scant tallow dips the only means of illumination ; when the roads were such that it took four strong farm horses to drag a coach along them ; when there was no fresh i meat, or food, and cut- throat footpads lurked in the neighboring thicket? To this day our j highly civilised race has -not got over its dread of winter and the gloom with which it is associated. Even among grown men there ! are few of whom the horror of the dark does not take hold from time to time, or even of I the night when it is not dark. Not long ago (says llider Haggard in " Longman's Maga zine ") I asked a friend, whose name would be known to every reader of this book, and whom one would certainly not associate with such fears, whether lie ever "felt afraid of being alone at night. He confessed to me that he did—that occasionally, when he sat working late, a panic would seize him, caus ing him to turnout the lights and slip away straight 'to bed. I believe that his expe rience is not by any means exceptional. We come of the Northern stock, and as; all students of the Sagas, that magnificent but neglected literature, will know, to our Norse ancestors thfe-dark of the long winter Was a "dreadful thing, peopled with malevolent trolls arid with ghosts of. the dead.
