Having boen paraded past the stand and their preliminary canters taken, they returned to tho post, and wcro at once taken in hand by Mr. M'George. The start was an admirable one, tho half-dozen runners leaving in a line, and for fifty or sixty yards it was impossible to say which had tba lead ; but when fairly past the stand Lilian, on tho lower ground, rushed to thu front, and went in a slight ad yancoof John Day on thc left, tho pair being followed, in the centre of tho course, by Iron Duke, Gloucester, and Lord Berncrs, with Norwich iii the rear. Thus they nm up the straight, but on making the turn outof the course Gloucester became tho immediate attendant upon Mr. Savile's marc. Lord Börners going on third, slighrly in advance of John Day, with Norwich and'Iron Duke acting as whippers in ; and in this order they ron up the hill and entered the New i Course. Passing through the furzes John Day rushed to the front, and, with Lord Berners and Lilian lying up, mad« strong running to tho mile post, where Lilian again carried ¡ lier colours to tho fore ; but this cap tai position sho only re tained to the five-furlong starting post, whmi sho was once moro headed by John Day, Gloucester, and Lord Berners, in tho order named, with the others closing up, and tims tlie3r came down the hill into the straight. Here Gloucester and Lord Bernors were in trouble, and passed by Lilian, Norwich, and Iron Duke, who followed John Day to the distance, where the old maro was beaten, leaving Norwich to follow the leader home, but without a chance of roaching him through distress, and John Day won easily by a couple of lengths. Lilian, pulling up, was a bad third ¡ Iron Duko fourth, just in front of Gloucester, with Lord Berners last. Time, bv Benson's chronoo'rn.nh. 4min .IÎÎSPO.
