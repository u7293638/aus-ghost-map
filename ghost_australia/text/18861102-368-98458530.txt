AMATEUR MINSTREL ENTERTAINMENT. - On Friday night thle members of the Burrowa Ama teur Dramatic Club gave a minstrel entertain ment in aid of the library for the Mechanics'. Although the hall was not well filled, a very good programme was given. Shortly after 8 p.m. the concert commenced with an overture by the company, after which the following pro gramnme was given :--Mr. J.R. Macdonald, song, "Ebren on the Rhine;" comic song, "The Hen Show," Mr. Elliot (who received an encore and gave in response "Have You Seen Her ?"); Mr. W. E. Wotton, "Red, White, and Blue; " Mr. W. Hancock, song, "Cradle's Empty, Baby's Gone; " comic song, "Babbling Brook," Mr. Scriven; song, "Belle Mahone," Mr. S. G. Wotton; song, " The Rustic Bridge," Mr. J. R. Macdonald; comic song by Mr. Elliot; song, "Old Folks at Home," Mr. W. Hancock; comic song, Mr. C. F. Scriven, " In the Morn ing;" song, "Drink, Puppy, Drinkl" Mr. W. E. Wotton. This brought the first part to a close. Part 11 commenced with a "Lecture on Temperance," Mr. F. P. Poole; song, " Only to See Her Face," Mr. Paradise; comic song, "The Sausage Boy," Mr. Elliot; song, "In Happy Moments" (by request), Mr. W. Han cock; song, Mr. W. E.

The performance con cluded with the side splitting farce, "The Wax works Show " - Signor Frangipanni, J. R. Macdonald; Bob, C. F. Scriven; Deaf Joe, F. P. Poole; Long Jim, D. J. Elliot; Washington, J. Curran; Greonacre Greenacre, S. G. Wot ton; Mrs. Greeneye, H. Meurer; Detective Bullseye, W. Hancock. The performers acquit ted themselves in a very creditable manner. I may say that the audience seemed far more pleased than they did at the last concert. Messrs. Scriven and Elliot were encored for every song they gave, and the whole of the per formers sang in first-rate style. In time the club will be the first out of Sydney.
