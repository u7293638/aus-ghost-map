OR?INAL CORltESPONDENOE. Fd TIC SXDITO OF Tvie I KIAMA INDEPENDENT. San-- observed an epistle in your issue of the 1Ih instant, subscribed " George Ran. kin,"'vheroin he states the report of the nomiltion meeting at Shollharbour, sent to 3o by a "Casual Correspondent," is not corrco, as he did not mention the contrhi.l tor's n?me, &o.; ; and hoe immediately admits that hi statod it could be plainly proven that tIe superintendent of the bridge, Mr. Anderon, had allowed certain deviations from tlo plan and speoilication to be made, To whim could he allude but the contractor as havng made the deviations from the plan, b, P It was not stated in the report that he mentioned the contractor by name, Then, chat transparent nonsense, what mi. serabl quiblings, worthy of a bush lawyer or the esuseitatod ghost of Macadam. The most Ilritablo view to take of "George lRaaki," is to believe that he has allowed the diappointment lie experienced at not obtaimng the contract for the Minnamurra bridgcso far to cloud his imagination, that ha is icapable of rational.aetion whenever it is te subject of his thoughts; and I think lie public should be 'oxtremely can. tious placoing reliance upon rumours elr culatd by a disappointed'tenderer as to the enrrypg out of the contract by the s'uccess= full ompetitor,. under. all eirctimatanndos, and speioally so in the present instance. If noedsary, I could proveo y a dozen wit. noese that evoty Word of the' report I' furbilhed you irWas substantially eorre?t, however unpalatablo it might be to G. It. and o, ' ? YPUR CASUALq CqR.
