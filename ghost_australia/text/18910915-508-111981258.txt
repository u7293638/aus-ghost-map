Is It War? On Saturday last we remarked that the European sitHiation was getting jnore seri ous tivop. it iiad ever been before, and. that, it was time to endeavor to liigeet aad set in order the vast mass of rumors of a w^jct like tendency that had been sprang .upon the world during a week or so* The clue to the whole situation is in. two facts.! It had become succes sively known, first, that after the naval meeting at Cronstadt some closer form p£ understanding had been, arrived at between France jm& Kuaeia; second, that Russia had taken advantage of this to cajole or compel the Sultan into abrogat ing the provisions of Jhe fceatjr of J^aris that restricted the passage of men- of-w»r through *he Dardanelles. Between these Announcements there were all kinds of rumors of the usual un la.u'mejiti.cated charactar, which Were either denied or explained away j |-ut the Franco^ 2UisejLa3i uaderstandiag, and the BuBBian icoup made in coneeqtience thereof, were concrete €ac^s ihat $hpre was no getting over.

In 1871 Great Britain, after a; blustering protest against having her { work in the Black Sea undone, agreed to a conference intended to salve her wounded dignity, and thereat submitted to yield up everything practical demanded of her. To day her Government is apparently in a differ ent humor, and thinks, as LordBEACONSFiELD thought twelve years ago, that concession has gone far enough. According to the latest telegram she has replied, to the Dar danelles coup — ^ here comes a third im portant fact— not by protests and diplo matic web spinning, but in kind. She has landed a force and occupied Mitylene, an island of the Greek Archipelago, which strategically commands the entrance of the Dardanelles. - There cannot be the slightest doubt about the seriousness of the reported step, the peaceful assurances of the Marquis Rudini, the Italian Premier, notwithstand ing. If the news be confirmed it may mean war. Something* more decisive has been done than when Lord Beaconsfteld ordered the fleet to Besika Bay in 1878. With the whole neighborhood of the Dardanelles in Turkish hands, ingress or egress for war vessels depended upon the fiat of the Sul tan, who was squeezable. A permanent British establishment at Mitylene means that the key has passed to the custody of Great Britain, which is a power much less susceptible to pressure than is the Sublime Porte. Mitylene is a little south of Besika Bay, and so a little further than that anchorage from the Dardanelles. But, whereas Besika is an open roadstead ex posed to violent winds, Mitylene has two ] good harbors and can be made a place of arms easily reinforcable from Cyprus, which is nearest to it, Alexandria, or Malta, It could also be a base of food supply, having not so long ago, before waf and oppression threw much of its land out of cultivation, sup ported double its present population of | 30,000. * i - A British occupation of Mitylene might ! bring Russia and . Turkey to their senses and force them to negotiate on .moderate terms, or enter into a conference intended to bring about a fair settlement, not merely to register a foregone conclu sion. In the event of the worst coming to the worst it must be remembered that the northern shore of the Dardanelles consists of the « long narrow peninsula of Gallipoli (within striking distance of Mity lene), where the iirst division of the Anglo French army landed in 1854 when en route for the Crimea. Gallipoli is at the mercy of- any power holding the sea in force. Its end towards the mainland is so narrow as to be under fire from the big guns of modern ironclads. This narrowness, too, makes it easily fortifiable. Behind fortifications at the narrow end an army could be collected at. leisure under the protection of the j fleet, and when that army was once j mustered an advance on Constantinople j from Russia would be checkmated. Agents of the British war office are said to have surveyed Gallipoii during tlse Beaconsfoxd period. What Sir Jakes Febgcsson meant when he said Great Britain could safeguard her own interests in tie Mediterranean is beginning1 to be. apparent. As we have before pointed out), the above plots and counterplots are oi: more than general interest to Australia, as they vitally affect the safety of snail and trade routes hither and the growth of Russian and French power in the Pacific as well as the Mediterranean. The statements published in Queensland con cerning the Mildura andjher stokers have been re produced in Sydney ; and Mr. Black, following the example of the Queensland Labor member, brought the matter up in the Assembly last night. The charges, to be sure, are serious enough — a little too serious ; indeed, their very gravity should hare been sufficient to put people on their guard against accept ing them without much better evidence than has been adduced. Sir Samuel Griffith, it will be remembered, gave an emphatic denial to them, and described them as a disgrace to journalism'. Our own Premier had. no opportunity of placing himself in a position to deny their correctness, and he had to do the best he could, at a moment's notice* with this ' hell under the hatches ' ' romance. It cannot be said, however, that Sir Henry Parkes appeared to advantage. He was unwillingly squeezed again. 'If' these charges were true* he virtually said— vUj then there would be the devil to pay on . the. Madura, , Much virtue in ' if?' Only the difficulty will be howlp get at the authors of those hypothetical crimeB he spike so glibly of. It is very well to talk of 'visiting crimes upon the perpetrators of crimes,' but how is he going to doit F If the hon. gentleman had reflected for a moment upon the1 relations of Ms Government &ad; of the other Australian Governments to tta squadron, he would doubtless have moderate'?!

It will $rofeafely be f«uftd that the flrfcole ihittg is very much «s Sir Samuel Griffith has described it , Tie affajr gave the gifted and far-seeing O'Sullivan' an excellent; opportunity $o play to the gauary, and at the same time display bis learning land taste.

The associatioiaL of the name of our respected j fellow-qitizen, Quong T»rt with dissertations on Caractacus is certainly suggestive of many [ things. Why, indeed, through such a conjunc ture, niay npt the imagioatujn easily call up the appropriate pair of historic ghosts, and, annihila ting distance and time, see Caractacus and Con fucius as it were shaking hands ? Humor is not a gift with which Mr. Parnell has been generally credited, whatever may be the extent of his other faculties. There is, how ?vor, something like a genuine, albeit an unconscious stroke of humor in his recent declaration that nothing would induce him to again take the leadership of the seceders from the Irish party. Te do the seceders common jus tice it must be admitted that most of them — of those at least whose opinions count for any thing at all— seem to have made up their minds that henceforth the leadership of Mr. Parnell ' would lead nowhere that could have any successful issue, 'I banish you,' says Ooriolanus to his ungrateful country men. But it is to be feared that the similar attempt of the ' uncrowned Jang ' to treat his re' volted subjects in 'the high Eoman fashion' will be rather suggestiv% of irreverent modern parallels than of solemn classic ones. For example, the ' Nobody asked you, sir, she said' of the heroine, of a familiar ditty might exactly apply to Mr. Parnell's case. There are four very deaf men in the Assembly. Mr. Carruthers, *$Sx. Traill, Mr. Hutchison, and Mr. Schey, and a rather amusing story is going the rounds about them. They were all excited about a measure that was before tlio Heuse, and Mr. Traill said to Mr. Cairuthers : ' Are you going on with this bill ?' The Minister replied : ' No, I'm not ill, thank you.' 'What did he say?' in quired Mr. Traill of Mr. Hutchison. 'He said he would give you a pill,' replied the other. 'Oh, did he ?' said Trail! ' Then I'll stop. Iguarantee I'll give him a pill.' '« Did I hear you just say youwould support this bill?' inquired Mr. Schey of Mr. Traill; to which the latter replied, 'Yes, the pup said he'd give me a pill/' 'Ah, then Fm with you,' replied Schey. Just then Mr Carruthers spoke to some other member, saying he would do something ' when this bill passes.' 'Did you catch what he said, Hutchison?' in quired Mr. Traill. Up jumped Mr. Hutchisen to draw the attention of the chair to the unruly con duct of Mr. Carruthers in speaking of hon. members as ' asses.' The Minister denied ever using such a. word — he kad made no reference whatever to 'classes.' 'He says he only said ' classes ' ' said Mr. Hutchison to Mr. Traill, who nodded and remarked, 'Oh well, it is not disorderly to refer to the ; 'masses.' 'Did you say 'lasses?' *slre-i , Mr. Hutchison, to which Traill nodded assent, ; whereupon Mr. Hutchison xos* from his seal, ; looking indignant at Traill, and remarking ' That ] he lived a scriptural life, and lie could npt under- ] stand such levity.' ** Oh, you're going for a cup of tea,' saiu Traill, and Hutchison turned away.
