CORRESPONDENCE. THE LIFE OF' CHRIST. . Sni/— Presuinirig that' 'prbfeesing' Christians may niit all hiive 'reHd tlie accpunti given /of lho birth ;of Christ in. the first chapter of Matthew, ' may-bo allowed' to' quote tlie'wqrds comriieiiciiig at the' 18tb' verse—" Now, the' birth' of Jeans Clirist wris on ''this wise'; wheri1; ns His mother Mary Was espoused to Joseph',';befbro they' came together she was found with "child;"1 / What cori- versa'tibri pissed beiween them bn Ihe disenvBi-v we are not informed, "but the i'ssue prbves that it was riot ea.iisfnoioiy to Joeeph.'rior could he (e- solye to consider .Mary. as. his wife, until 'an arigtl appeared uuto him in a dreairi, as We find in the 20th verse, saying," /" Joseph, thou sen of David,' fear not tp take, unto,, thee. Mary, thy wife, fur 'that which iri conceived 'in her; is -'of Yhe Holy Ghost. Iri Eccles., phap. 34, 1st and 2nd verse?/ we read, "-The hopes of , a.man, void of urider- 8tandiiig are 'vain and false," isitd d reams lift up fools, whoso, regardoth dreams is like him that catcheth at 'a shadow,, and . followeth' after the wind." There is a reflection ion thb same passage , by the! Rey. . Alatthew -Henry; in ,'hik Family Devotional Bible,, which .I, will h're Md. He; says, ".Dreams are iio more than the -spor ings of fancy and vagaries, of. .the imagination when the senses are at rest./ He .who pretends tb.prognoBlicatp either good , nr., ill fiom-; theni puts'liis confidence in' that , which-, hath nothing to'siipprtft it." 1 ,N«».w, .1- submit : that this is a yory dubioui tale, resting solely on the dream of an obscure artisan'. . Why did not the angel apppar to Joseph, in broad daylight; arid before credible witnesses ? How did, Joseph know that It was an angel, . for ,-ifc appears he 'only' dreamt it ? This story of the angel annouriciug what the Church, calls, the. immaculate concep tion is not, so .much as. mentioned , in the .books ascribed .lo Mark arid John ; and it is differently related .'in Matthew. and Luke. The former says the augel appeared to. Joseph, " the latter says it was to Mary j but whore is the evidence? and- echo answers where ? We hear nothing of angels' visits, now-a-days, . Alan hos become so cautious in; his belief, and . so sceptical in 'his ' doubts that ho looks with distrust on' everything that is, not. amenable to his, reason, or .tangible to his senses and. yet, strange to suy, the foundation of the Christian religion,, rists, on a dream—on the dream:of an obscure artisan— -an the' bsaeless fabric of -vision! And it is on, such testimony that the moat eulighteiied people iri tho world liayo hitherto submitted lo recoivo it and been satisfied. Would such lostiriiany he ho, listejiod tm for one moment' in a Court of Justice, or !'can. uwe ..suppose: that Almighty Wiqdopi would in, tliis obscure nnd doub'ful mnqner .manifest.'.Him8ql(, to. tfie world ? Dr. Adam Clnrko in a .note of his commeiiiary on Luke, cHap. 2, . verse 11th— " For unto you is borti i,t_his.!day,,in; the- Qily of ,David a Saviour, T, "I Aiuru, 7 BUllt'B Cilfti rauuciiitio gives a OMfi-i|ogue of.no ,1ofs; than 136 different opiniuns concerning .the yvar of Christ's , birth ; i ribfi as'to His birlhday that has boon placed by; lesrno/l uiGn and Christian Beets in every month , y.fftYi hut the Roman Catholic Church" , f eed it <»h the 25 h.

This character wou'd suit , Alexander very v oil, who most cei taiuly was a bastard (and which boars a ro» mnrkable similarity to the account wo have of the birth of Christ) for his mother Olympia said that Jupiter ontered bor aparimont in tlie shape of a dragon and begat Alexander. It is added, could her husband Philip beliovo this? A question which could with equal propriety have been put to Joseph. During tho disturbances in Jamnica, when tho caoe of Mr Avery, the missionary sup posed to bo implicated, was brought boforo a jury, a Alethodist Minister made his way into Court, and said hocamo to bear testimony to the innocenco of Brother Avery. ' Well, sir,' said .the Judge, 'what can you testify V ' 1 havo had a vision, sir. An angel appeared to mo inn dream Jo bear witness to the. innocence of Brother Avery. ' Then let hinj.bo summoned,' was the / rejoinder.' .This is thd only legitimate way ol treating all ' caseB of dreams' and visions a,'4 angelic' .witrieesos.
