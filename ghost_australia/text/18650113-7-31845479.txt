I The St. Macros, from Batavla, has brought a mil cargo of eafltem produce, for the discharge of wfilshsbe awaits orders at the anchorage. Since her departure from here she has made a very pleasant coasting voyage between^ the various outports of Java, In collecting her valuable freight— at one plaoe receiving sugar, andatothers rice, sago, tapioca, &c; In this manner much time was lost, bat being a foil ship she left on the Ist December, when a prevalence of calms delayed bet progress considerably, inasmuch as the return voyage oocnpled 42 days, while the trip from here to Java was of only 33 days' duration, and out of that time is were passed In beating against heavy westerly gales before rounding the Leuwln. TSro of the crew were laid op—one by fever and ague, and the other from dysentery. Captain Walsh reports tbe barque Douglas as loading In Java for Melbourne. The barque Hnmholdt hence had also arrived, bat although papers and letters bad been posted to Captain Prootor none bad reached B&tavta;,. from the irregular state of the mail communication, which may probably Improve if the Adam Bay settlement progresses favorably.
