the fact that the lawlessness and disordor m tho Assembly aro contri- buted by tho représentât« es of the pai ty which is acco mtablo foi tho reign of lawlessness, outiage, and cunio o\er o laigo part of the colony The object of the disordei in tho Assembly is to lnndor tho Government fiom acquir- ing powers which would enable it to prevent law-abiding men from being violently captured and hold as pri sonois, woolsheds from being burned by midnight incendiaries, and houses and thoir inmates from being fired xipon by gangs of mutderous marauders, all with the purposo of es- tablishing a reign of tori or by acts of systomatio crime It is to withhold theBe powors and to soouro comparative impunity in rogaid to these misdeeds that tho policy of violence and disordor was the other evening brought in full force into tho Queensland Assembly It is, the publio w as assured tho other day by tho labour journal of Queensland, by mon " who ordinarily aro gont o and good and kind to a fault " that the cruel and tyrannical outrages of the West are perpetrated Poss Ely it is by philanthropists similaily suffering from a superfluity ot good- ness and benoficenco that the en- deavours wore made the other even- ing and again jesterday to cupple tho bands of the Government and to secure tho triumph of the law less and the cnminal over tho law abiding classes of the countiy The case remains that if life and property aie to bo safe, and if peisonal liberty is to bo maintained, the law must suppress all who stand opposed to it, whether these are in Parliament oi else whero It is of course a misfortune when in a time of serious social strife a Govern- ment finds itself compelled to ask for ad- ditional and moro stungent powers of pohco lepression Such a demand is suie to give riso to bittor contention, and, in a sense, to bring the strugglo rrging m tho country into tho halls of the Legisla ture But wo must remember that owing to the íoluctanco which eveiy Govern- ment feels in regard to asking lor such powers, they aro seldom or no\er doraandod lrom Parliament till the con- dition of things necessitating th*m has become urgent And then as to the shamo and discredit attaching to such displajs of violence and disordor m the Assombly, we ma3 well ask whether it is not perhaps an advantage that the publie of the capital and of tlio populous dis tricts of tho const country should bo made to seo moro closely some of the displajs of lawless violonce which at the present moment aro teiionsing the pas- toral distucts of +he West Tiobably it is only necessary to bring these exhibitions home to the masses of tho pcoplo foi thom to insist with a voico of authority, wmch no Pailiament can daio to withstand, that the law shall bo mndo to piovail over all who aie m opposition to it, and that peace, liberty, and oidoi bo secured at all costs It can ne\er bo a question in an English commumtj governed by the people in accordance with laws which tho\ themselves have made, whether oi not law and order shall be maintained The only possiblo question can at the most be upon whom this duty is to devolve It is impossible to suppose that numerous classes of the people will submit to bo coeiced by a system ot lawless bugandnge at the risk of their lives and piopoities and at the sacrifice of then peisonal liberties. They are entitled to look, whethoi it is m Queensland oi ISew South Wales, to the forces of law and police to protect them fioni such attacks If law and police fail thom, whether owing to the pusillanimity of the Government oi to the insufficiency of tho foices at its dis- posal, then they will certainly take in hand their own defence, and will confront then assailants aimed foi lesistance It is only by a deplorablo failuie of govern- ment that such a necessity can anso It represents a lapse to a lower stage of civilisation, to the stugo ot pnvate war, from which it io quired tho efforts of centuries to emerge It is this condition of things which gives such feiocity to the industrial disturbances m America This condition of things is not owing to any essential lawlessness or bloodthirstiness in tho American cha- racter But the Govoinmont there is apt to bo slow to move in such social disturb- ances, and the consequence is that the classes thieatened aro compelled to aim in then own défonce This imparts an elemont ot class hatred and fierce animosity to those strifes m Amonca which the} seldom oi nevor exhibit where the duty of maintaining law and order is resolutely undertaken, u it ought nlwajs to bo, by official guaidians, who aro appointed and paid for that puipose It is lamentable to und in any lustraban colony such a condition of things that the ordinaiy powors ot law are inadequate to save society from the enemies ot liberty and ordor Wheio, however, such a condition prevails, it is tho duty of tho Government to nppoal forthwith to the Legislature for the requisite powors, and wo cannot believe I that in any Australian colony such an appeal, if supported by proof of its necessity, will over be made in vain In any case the responsibility under such cir- cumstances rests with tho Legislature, and with the people of whom it is tho | representativo In all other cases, whore the authorities profess themselves to be satisfied with tho forces at their command, the responsibility for the enforcement of order and law and the assurance of personal security and free doom rest with the Government, and a heavy and piompt account would have to be rendered by any Government which evadod or snronk from this duty The discussion which took placo last evening on tho third reading of the Goal Minos Eegulation Bill was interesting, and wo may add important, as showing the strong objection which is ontortainod in several authoritative quarters of the Houso to the inclusion of the penal eight hours piovision in the bill The fact is that much of the argu- ment by whioh the bill has been defended has been directod to the confusion of two very different matters Thus wo find the Premier stating last night that when the bill was introduced under I Sir Henby Pjuikes that statesman did I not object to its provisions. This asser- tion involves a strango jumble of circum- stances. The fact is that what Sir Henry Pabkes objects to now is tho ponai provision for an eight-hour day, and it was tho introduction of this provision into the bill of his Government three years ago which, as Mr. Eeid will remember, led to his throwing up tho bill and resigning office. Again, Mr. Eeid says, "The bill is really a teohnical one." This is to some extent true. But then to the bill so far as it is merely a technical one, by which wo mean doaling with practical details, no objection attaches. Tho objection to it is based upon the fact that it embodies a principio now to our legislation of limiting by ponai enactment tho hours of labour of adult men, a prin- cipio which, if it is justifiable in regard to mining, would bo oqually so in rogard to many other fprms of labour. Surely to toll us that so novol and so far-reaching a provision is nioroly " teohnical " is to unfairly represent its charactor and its scopo. Somo sensible remarks wore made by Sir George Dibbs on tho basis of his expe- rience as a mineowner. Ho reminded the House that the coalniinor was paid by the piece, not by tho day, and also that on tho average tho New- castle miner did not work more than four hours a day. And ho justly remarked that any provision which would so operate as to increase tho average of the working day to five hours would do moro good to the miners than anything else that could be possibly devised. Their misfortune is not that their working day on tho average is too long, but that it is too short, and anything tonding to hamper tho trade or to inoreaso the cost of getting coal must tend to roduce the miner's earnings and depreciato his comfort. Certainly, if the Government bill passes into law in its present form, it is likely to curtail the length of tho minor's working day in a manner not contemplated or desired. It may bo hoped that tho report of the committee of tho Chamber of Commerce on the question of bills of lading will bring an important matter a stage nearer to a satisfactory settlement. Tho discus- sions in tho mercantile community for years past have shown an undesirable degree of friction. Shippers have long complained that the bills of lading aro so worded as to bo a fruitful source of loss to them. It appears that these aro not all alike, and it is said that cer- tain companios givo a more liberal interpretation to tho provisions of thoir bills of lading than others. In tho Anglo Australian trade, at any rate, it might be supposed that a common form would bo more satisfactory than a variety of iorms, which must tend to confusion. The principal causes of difference betweon shipowners and shippers relate to the seaworthiness of vessels, exemption from losies on account of negligence of servants, and tho proper caro of' goods committod to a ship. Thore seems to bo no good reason to object to bills of lading framod in accordance "with these views. The difficulty hitherto has been in framing clauses that will bo acceptable to all concerned. It is now claimed by the Chamber of Commerco that tho form of a bill of lading agreed upon is absolutely in accord with the rules for contract of affreightmont accepted by the London shipowners in October last, and that, theroforo, ship agents in the colony moy fairly bo oxpectod to . give their adhesion to it. Being assured on this point, ship agents will have no object in rofusing to comply, for in the main the conditions whioh regulate inward cargóos should control those which have to bo discharged on tho othor side of tho world. It is only fair to assume that the repre- sentativos of shipowners are as eager to carry out any arrangement for the more satisfactory conduct of the trade as are their principals. Difficulty that may bo felt bj them as to any part of the form recommended may have to be settled by roference to shipowners ;.but in view of the agreement said by the Chamber of Commerce to have been arrived at in London, there ought to bo no doubt of an early deter- mination, on a generally satisfac- tory basis, of questions which have caused considerable litigation in law courts both hore and in England. Shipowners on the other side of tho world have expressed their desire to see the matter settled for a variety of reasons. At the conference of tho Association for the Eoform and Codifi- cation of the Law of Nations, presided over by the Lord Mayor of London and attended by representatives of all branches of mercantile and shipping interests, Air. J. Glove«, speaking with " the authority of tho shipowners," said that they were very anxious for tho settlement of this long con- troversy, and he indicated the points which they were prepared to yield ; and as these aro points for which the Australian mer- chants havo boen contending for years past, we may reasonably anticipate the end of tho controversy._ The intention of the French Government to wholly subdue Madagascar, as inti- mated in our cabio messages, is but the culmination of a policy on which that nation has boon long bent. For nearly two centuries efforts woro made with more or less Biicoess to maintain posts on tho coasts or outlying islots, and about ton or twelve years ago, after a desultory war made on various pretexts, Franco obtained possession of an important bay on the north coast, and secured the right of placing a Eesident at the capital ; while in 1890 the British Government, to the regret of many in- terested in the wolfaro of the Malagasy pooplo, recognised the French protectorate of Madagascar. What that protectorate meant was well enough understood at the time, and its object is revealed in the presont reported movement for the annexation of the island. As the country has beon Christianised from England, in so far as Christianity has beon extended among the people, the reigning Queen, her Court, tho officials, and the great bulk of the Hovas, or ruling race, being Protestant, tho intrusion of tho French has naturally been the cause of much heart- burning on religious grounds ; while the attachment whioh the ruling circles of the country have always had towards English institutions and the English peoplo, to- gether with the important strategic posi- tion of this fino island in relation to India and tho ocean passage thither, have invested the French ascendency in Mada- gascar with distaste in England as a matter of politics and statesman- ship. "It was British friendship and British arms that enabled the Hovas to mako themselves kings of Madagascar ; and though for one short period parseou tion of tho Christians weakonod tho relations of tho Malagasy rulers with England as with civilisation in general, it was to England the peoplo turned for friendship when the clouds rolled by, and all the civilisation Madagascar knows I has como to it from England, Nobody probably would urge that England should risk a war with France for the salce of Madagascar, but there is that in the whole hisUry of the country that leaves a pained f oebng m the British mmd at seeing tho success of these continuous aggressions on the independence of Mada- gascar, .and tho probabilities that under Eronch ascendency and tho peculiar methods of French rulo in foreign parts the distinctive features of British institu- tions and influence will bo swopt away.
