THE. TALE OF THE WITUti OF ENDO.fi. Of all Bible stories cone is mo» popular with children than the tale of tha Witch of Endor. "On wet Sunday afternoons Uie most admired plate in the foiio Bible is Uut wtuch shows Sanl falling forward on the earth, aud the witch woman shrinking back in astonish ment and awe, and the white bearded, shadowy figure of the Prophet rising up from the silence ot Sheol. The woman of Endor is beloved by controversial infancy, just launched, unconsciously, on the stream of Biblical criticism and pleading against the verdict of parent or narse for the existence of ghosts and witches. The early syllogism runs thus: The Bible is true. The Bible says then v m * witch awl a ghost. Therefore, there are ghosts and witches. We often meet with worse arguments in later life, as when Science avers : ' I don't take any interest in the question,' with the suppressed inference, 1 therefore there is nothing in it but nonsense.' Our instructors in our infancy, however, met our logic with pleas more suH'e, tbcugb net wholly satisfying. Thus, 'Theie were witches, or at least there ws& a witch, but that waB before the comiog of the Gospel. So now run away and see if you oan find a ripe strawbery.' Thus was the daring metaphysical specnl* - tioD of infancy diverted into pr»nt.ie.-il researches. Or again, the answer would be, " Saul was a bad man, and therefore the devil was allowed to deceive him in the shape of Samuel.' ' But it does not saj anything about the devil, and the ghost's prophecy came true.' * Oh, no doubt that was permitted for wise reasons. So now run away,' ut supra.— Andrew Ling, in the Contempor- ary Review. J
