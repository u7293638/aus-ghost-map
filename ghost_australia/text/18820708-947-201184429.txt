But the most interestirigibuild ing : of - all ; is the ? representation- - of the ' Old Bush Home.' With its Blab walls about three feet high we have an old bush hut. Its chimney of wood, and its roof of bark. On a stool outside the door stands the washing dish. The fryingpan hangs upon the wall,' and the home-made broom ? rests against the chimney, whilst the kindling: for the morning's fire lies at the door. In a tree hard by hangs the meat bag, arid' slung across one of the hurdles that surround the little hut is an old sheepskin. How many reminiscences this little representation must kindle in the minds of the .pioneers of the coloniea I cannot say, but the pic ture is an- exceedingly pretty one, arid I i was glad to see it.

In olden times Separation Day was a great festival in the Victorian calendar, bub we are a matter-of-fact people now, and do not celebrate, our severance from New South WaleB , with a five-days' re joicing. On Saturday the city flag was displayed at the Town Hall, and the banks and law Courts, were closed, but otherwise business wont on as usual. In deed, as it has been wisely remarked by an advocate for federation, ' we are be ginning to forget that we were ever sepa rated' from the sister colony. . A. nice little scandal will come before the Divorce Court before very long. The petitioner resides near Sandhui'at, and sent his captivating wife down to the me tropolis to see the Exhibition' The trip was an unluoky one, for the fair one formed an affection for a musician, and afterwards with several others. . Some of her recent lovers wore married ones, and there are skeletons to be found in more than one domestic circle in consequence. The name of Kichard Heales, though it holds an honoured place in Victorian his tory, is seldom mentioned nowadays, so soon are those who have joined the un known 'regiment forgotten by their friends and fellow-toilers. jt.Yet I was reminded of a host of old politicians— -Raines, Ebderi, Nicholson, , Macadam, and others —when!

Turning up the files of an old paper of nearly' a quarter of a century' ago I find the announcement of a 'farewell benefit to Mr. George Coppin, upon the occasion of hia retirement from the stage.'
