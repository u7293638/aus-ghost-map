THE DOWAGER-EMPRESS. The Dowager Empress of China has prac- tically risen from the gutter, for she was the child of poor parents living in the wretched slums of Canton, and a famous general, attracted by her marvellous beauty —Chinese!—bought her. Then the Emperor, Hsien Feng, saw her and fell as much in love as if he were not yellow-skinned and oval-eyed. He had already one wife, but the customs of China enabled him to place a second on very nearly the same footing, and it was not long before the newcomer had the Em- per "under her thumb." When Hsien Feng died he bequeathed the crown to his son Tung Chi, but the Regency was divided between his two wives, and the second became the chief power in the empire. Her force of cha- racter soon made itself felt. In process of time the Emperor Tung Chi reached his majority. Then one fine day the legitímate widow died, and very shortly afterwards the Emperor also died. Scarcely had the young monarch given up the ghost than the surviving Dowager de- clared that the child of one of her sisters, married to the seventh Prince, Chun by name, had been adopted by her late hus- band, and she accordingly proclaimed him Emperor. Then she ruled the kingdom, and did it remarkably well, though she was conservative in the extreme. Even when the Emperor came of age he was a mere cipher, and though for a short time he struggled for authority, it was useless. The Dowager Empress has power and means to continue to hold it. She is now 59 years old but hardly looks half that age.—“Woman’s Weekly.”
