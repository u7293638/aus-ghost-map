'lins man who is usually a Victorian-has pur- chased at a high price It would be in equitable to depnvo lum, the real pioneer, of rights conceded to others, who really, if not nominally, havo had I

Parhamont may deem it prudent to ha\ o tho names of tlio mern bei s of tho fiibt bowl submitted foi its nppioval, but cuticism, we may hope, will bo dnected to impiove, and not to defeat, tho ptopoiitiou Political ad ministiation and class legislation havo sadly bim led the land picture m Vic tona We cannot îectify tho past, but it is a pleasuie, m tho inteiests of Aus ttnhn, to find that oin neighbouis aro noting both oin f>ucceises and our failuics Wo legislated foi one class, and for tho most pait benefited anothci If they will fauly lecogmso all inteiests, then policy will assuredly cnuch tho countiy as a whole It will bo remembered that, ns finally passed by the Legislative Assembly, Mi Bl NT's bill of 1882 contained no less than sixty fivo piojected extensions of tho Victoiian Ballway system It is in the highest degieo impiobablo that if the political circumstances of the hour had allowed tho Uppei lfouso to discuss the details of Mi Bl NI'S measure, its schodulas would have omeiged intact from thoir deliberations But his numeious proposals commanded tho approval of tho Legislative Assombly, and consequently theio aro now many towns and distncts thioughout Victona whose claims to railway accommodation havo been endoiscd as valid by tho io pie°entatives of the people m the Lowci JIouso Lven if it be giantcd, however, that all Mi Bl Ni s extonsion schemes havo thus established an equal pie emptivo light to fuithei considoiation by Pmliament, it is simply nnpossiblo tint Mi Gums should bung forward his piedcccssors bill in its ontuoty The necessity which Mr GILLIKS IS le quucd to recognise is, that he cannot îeckon on having inoio than a limited fund for constiuction at Ins disposal, nndhenco the lcsponsibihty with which ho is confiontcd is that, from very numerous pioposals of which the appio val of tho Legislativo Assombly is on official íccord, ho must select tho exton sions that aio to bo recommended foi tho lmmediato consideiation of Ballia incut To these, of com so, ho may add new schemes not contemplated by Ins piedccessoi in office What Mr GILLIFS may deteunino to do undei such cn cuiustances time, of course, will duly io veal But if wo may venture on a foiccast as to his probable action, he will be found moio inclined to lecom mend extensions in tho country districts of tim colony than to advise additions to the Melbourne subuiban system If this anticipation should linn out to bo coneet, wo do not think that we shall bo disposed to question the sound ness of the geneial pnnciplo mulei lying such a policy It would bo absuul now a da) s to make wry faces about accepting tho consequences of the carhei legislation that has diiven so many sottleis into tho uiteiior, while much of tho good land on tho sea boaid vvasstillcuinbeiedwith timbei,and still unbiokcn by tho plough But thore aie agi .cultural ai cas within cömpaia tivelyshoitdislancesof Melbourne which are only partially utilised by tho

some of them weio included in Mi BFMS bill Of theso extensions, theio is ono which deputations fiom Dandenong, Oakleigh, and leintreo Gully havo recently picsscd on the attention of Mi GHLILS lins extension combines tho two ad vantages of afloiding an easy means of access to tho picturesque scenery of tho Dandenong Ranges, and of supplying the sottleis ovci a con sideiiblo area of good land with facih tics foi sending pioduco to Melbourne It appeals, then, to havo doublo claims to consideration Wo ventuio, there foie, to hi/aid tho opinion, that in tho Railway Bill which Mr Gitrirs will shortly submit to Parliament, ho will lesoivo a place foi a Teintieo Gully line Toi connecting Fein treo Gully with railways alieady in existence, four dis tiuct pioposals havo been made It will bo convenient to considei these m paus In the case, then, of oithei of tho fust pair, tho now exton sion would bo a blanch fiom tho Gipps land hue Ono of tho suggested points of junction is Dande nong-the othoi Oakleigh In either case some 11 01 12 miles of new lino would lequuo to bo made Both schemes ollu somo cnglneenng difh culties, and tho cost of tho moic exponsivo of tho two would bo about £70,000 Tho residents of tho Tern tree Gully distnet object -very strongly to tho idea of being taken to Melbourne na Dandenong l'oi tho distance from Melbouino of that point of junction is only about a milo less than tho dncct distance of tho Fern tree Gully ter minus To tho idea of a branch from Oakleigh, tho local antipathy not so pionounced But that pioposal equally contemplates the conbtiuctior of an unneccssaiy length of new i ail way Hence, though not unsatisfactoiy to tho residents of tho distnet, in so far as it promises them a toleiably direct routo to Melbourne, it is objectionablo to them as involving tho needless expenditure of a large bum of public money We turn now to tho other pan of proposals If either were approved, the new branch would form a junction with tho Lilydale line In one caso tho point of junction would bo at Cambci well Supposing that adopted, the length of new line would bo about 16 miles, of which the 'cost is estimated to tippioxnnato to £90,000 But tho compensating advantage would be that a considerable stretch of new country available for building sites, would bo supplied with railway accommodation Peí conda, tho engmeeung difficulties would bo very considerable Again, thoio mo still ample supplies of un' occupied building land between Cam bei well ond Lilydalo, and if there wore any pressing need to cncourago sub- urban settlement along a new route tho wiser com so would piobably be to cany out tho projected line fiom Picnic station to Glen Ins Thus the Cam bonvell schomo is evidently open to considerable objection Thoio îemains tho fourth proposal, of which Mi BFY. so emphatically cxpiessed his approval that although tho Dandenong route was schodulod in the fust diaft of his Bail w ly Bill, it was tho lhngwood route that was ultimately passed by the Loner Honso Foi this, tho point of june tion would bo about half nay between tho Ringwood and the Warrandyte stations If earned out, it would in vilvo tho construction only of sa miles of new lino, piesenting no engineeiiii" difficulty of any kind along its com se Moi cover, its estimated cost, including lolling stock, is put at £22,000 Bonce, both fiom tho engineering and the economic point of view, the Ringwood junction schemo seems to bo by fal tho most practicable of the foui proposals that havo been lnado foi establishing íailway communication between lern tieo Gully and Melbourne Tho sum that has been just men- tioned is so small that tholeintioo Gully residents, who aie interesting themselves about the Ringwood Junction route, must feel reasonably confident that Mr GILLII S will icgaid their re piosentations with favourable ejes From personal inquiry, we havo found that thoio aio 1,200 íesidents ni the distnct Thoy havo cxcollent timber, which is valueless to them, becauso long haulage would íun away with tho whole of tho price a timber merchant would pay , and they enjoy a magnificent chmato, which both could and would giow quantities of splendid fruit and vegetables foi sale, if only thcro weio a i ail way near to carry it to market ïhus thero is traffic ready to bo earned, agncultural land waiting to bo cleared, and agncultuio only want- ing to bo stimulated Moieovei, flio buck making mdustiy seems to bo find ing for itsolf homes along the Lilydalo line It may, and probably will, spiead still fin tim along the country of similar chaiaeter, which tho Fern treo Gully lino would îonder pqunlly accessiblo Again, tho íesidents ni tho distnct may urge that the lino would bo used by tho settles who occupy tho countiy spttlpîs who occupy tho countiy lying between roi utico Gully and G'embiook But, m addition to tlieso aigunionts, and exceeding the whole of thom in weight, is the considcintion
