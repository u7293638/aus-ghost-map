V ' ' AWAKE. ?' ' Upon no per.aon.had the supposed ap ' pearance of a phantom in the grounds of -the House of White Shadows produced ? so prof ound ? an impression as upon Ar , thur .Balcom'be. .This, was but natural. .Even supposing him not to have been a ' man of- susceptibility, the young lady's . -terror as ana gazeu uj- m« suuuow wxiion . ^ her imagination may have conjured up , '.- ' ''could not have failed to make an impres sion upon him.' This was the first night of his return after an absence of many years to the house in which he had been born, and had passed his unhappy child rho6d's life ; and the. origin of the belief in these -white shadows -which were said ? to'haunt. his estate was so closely woven into his personal- history as almost to form a part of himself. He had never submitted his mind to a rigid test of be lief or disbelief in the signs ; one of the principal aims of his life had been not only to' avoid the villa, but to shut out all thoucht of the tragic events which had led to the death of his parents. He loved- them both with an equal love. When he thought of his mother he aaw a woman patient in suffering, of a temper exquisitely sweet, whose every word and act. towards her child was Jraught with tenderness. When he thought of his fatborihe saw a man high principled and jus^t,, inflexible in matters, of right and conscience, patient also in ? suffering,- 'and bearing in silencj as his mother did a grief which had poisoned his life and hers. Neitheivhad ever spoken a word against the other!; the mystery which kept this' tender*, loving woman, and the iust, hich prinoipled man apart was never disclosed tqtheir . child'. On. this subjeot they eb trenched themselves behind a barrier of silence .which the child's love and winning way^s, could not penetrate ;! only when his mother's eyeB were closed and ? her lips sealed by death was ho privileged to witness how deeply his father had loved her. i Much?, of , what ' had been disclosed to the Advocate's wife by Mother Denise was, absolutely unknown to him. Doubt leas ha could have learned every ^par ticular of ' the bir'cumstances : iwhioh had led to the private .divorce- of his parents' had his wish lain in that direction, but a delicate i instinct whispered to\him not' to lift the veil; and he would' permit no person :to: approach 'the subject in his pre sence. ??? ?'?? : ,The bright appearance of his 'Sitting room cheered and refreshed him when he.ientereditf after bidding the Advocate good] night.' The: care Ithat had been taken to-make: lit pleasant to him was evident, andr. he. was ,? instinctively grateful for ' it. But this pleasurable Bense was? not un alloyedrj'his heart, and his conscience were disturbed, and as he took up a hand ful of roses which had been thrown loose: into a bowl and inhaled their fragrance, a guilty thrill shot through his veins. With the. roses in his hand he stood before the picture of Adelaide, which she had hiing eb.oyethis desk'. How bright andbeauti ful was the face, how lovely !the smile with which she greeted hint ?! It almost aeejhed -asif Bhe were speaking to him, telling him that she loved him, and aBk ing hipijto assure her onee'more that 'her love was returned. With what 'a tender pressure had Tshe clasped his hand when she parted fromhima few minutes since ! Itti;her eyes he read what she dared not say in the presence of others — 'I am yours, only yours.' He tried to think out the consequences of this fatal irifatu ationr^ho.w it- commenced (though that it ? was pot in his power to fix; it was a creation, not a growth, a star flash which suddenly revealed to him that his heart, his bouI, were the slaves of her beauty)— howi it progressed, how he had at first yielded to it in ecstasy then fled from' it in'.horfor ; and how it would end. The attempt was vain ; he could not think, he could not reason ; the passion which burned in his heart was a consuming fire, in the fierce light of which the power of reasoning was lost. For a moment the fancy' came upon him that Adelaide and he wore like two stars, wandering through a dark and dangerous path, and that be fore them lay death, and worse than death, dishonour and irretrievable ruin ; and that she the brighter star holding him tightly by the hand was whispering .—'I will guide you safely; only love me, love me, love me !' Had lie gone too . fat to recede ? Well, but he had striven to free himaelf, had wrestled with the fever without success, for all his en deavours had ended in his finding him self once more entangled in love's net. There was one means of escape— death ! A coward's refuge which might not even afford him a release from dishonour, for Adelaide, in her despair might let their; seoret escape her. Why then should he torture himself unnecessarily?; It was not . in his power to avert the inevitable ; he Lad not deliberately chosen his course — fate had driven him into it ; was it not best after all to do as he had said to tho Advocate that night, to submit without a-. struggle? Men were not masters but slaves. ' If I drift, I dcift,'iie thought. '.The. path is strewn with flowers; how many men would envy me, and sacrifice everything to stand in my place !' When the image of the Advocate, of his friend, presented itself to him he thrust it sadly from him ; but it came again and again like the ghost of Banquo ; conscience re fused to be whipped to sleep. Crumbling the rosea in his hand .and strewing, the floor with the leaves, he turnod, and saw gazing wistfully at him the eyes of his moth er. The artiat who had painted her pic ture had not chosen to depict her in her most joyous mood; Jn hisheart,also,asahe sat before him, love's fever was burning, and he knew, while, his brush waa fixing herbeauty on the canvas, that his love was returned, though treachery had parted them. He had striven, hot unsuccessfully, to nortrav in her features the. expression of one1 who loved, and to 'whom, lpve_ was denied. The look in'-tier eyes was wistful rather than hopeless, and conveyed to. those who know her history the idea of one who hoped to' find in another world the happiness she had lost in this. Sweet and tender reminiscences :of the years he had lived with hia mother in these very rooms stole into Arthur Balcombe's mind, and for the first time in his life he allowed his .thoughts to dwell upon the question, 'Why had she been unhappy ?' She was young, beautiful, amiable, rich; her husband was a man honoured and esteemed, with a character above ,re uuuuii. tv lint auuiut wuuiu uo rovuiutu if the heart of this mystery were laid bare to his sight ? If it were in his power to ascertain the truth, would ,the revelation cause him additional Borrow?. Better, then, to let the matter rest. What good purpose would he served' by raking up the ashes of a melancholy past ? His parents, were dead, and here ; occurred a, sudden revulsion. His. mother was dead,,,and but a few short minutes since , her ^spirit was supposed to have appeared in the grounds of the villa. ' i ' : Almost .! upon the thought he hurriedly left- -the xpom, ? and), made his way into.the.gardens,,,.,. ,.,, ,,; 'My neighbour, 'and. master, of this house,' said Pierre Lamont, wild was lying wide awake m the'adjbinihg room, 'dooB 'not. aeem inclined to.rest ; 'spme-| thing disturbs him,'1 .., ,?; ?;,;- -???[',, :t Pierr.e Lamont was alone. ? . F,ritz jjhe fool had left him for the night, and the old lawyer. himself in no. mood for sleep was reading and . listening to the move ments around him. There was little to.. ,hear'; only an occasional mumod sound, which the listener interpreted as best he' could ; but. Arthur Balcombe,. when, .he left. his room, had to pass Pierre Lamontfs door in his passage to the grounds, and' it ? was the clear sound of' his footsteps, wliich, led Pierre. .Lamont to his correct conclusion.,. 'Ho is going out of. the house,' continued Pierre Lamont ; ' for what ?' To look for his mother's ghost perhaps.' The' old lawyer ? associated this reflection with';a smile of .derision. '!Gh'ostB'and fools Btill left who believe in them ! Well, well, . but for tho -world's, delusions there would be little work for buBy ..minds, ' to ,, accomplish. As ,a' fantastic .piece] .,-. 'of / imagery I might conjure up ' an', army of men ^sweeping the. world . with brooms' made of b'rainB, of . knavery ,,. folly , t . trickery, .and. delusion.' A comprehensive word this ,last,.with a range so vast that a. man might lose ? himself-' in ' - the labyrinths., ; What's that ? A footstep ; ,human ?, no*j loo light formally but the feet of a 'cat;' ' But here Pierre Lamont., was sadly at' fault. ? It was Diorietta who .passed his 'door in the passage without,' conveying' to Arthur Balcombe's room- the note written by the Advocate's wife. Before the arrival of her new mistress Dipne.tta had always worn thick bpota, , and tha sound of herfootsteps was plain to hear ; but Adelaide's nerves could not endure, the creaking arid clattering, and she' had supplied her maid with shoes. ( Besides, Dionetta had naturally a light step. '?' : Arthur Balcombe met with1 nothing1 in the grounds to disturb him. No airy ?shadow appeared to warn him of the danger which' threatened him through his love for' Adelaide. Were it possible for the spirits of the dead to make them selves seen and heard, assuredly the spirit of his mother would have appeared, and implored him to fly from the house without delay. Happy for him would it have been were he one of the credulous fools Pierre Lamont held in despisal. Happy for him could ho have formed out of the shadows which moved around him a spirit in which he would have be lieved , and could he have heard in the Bighing of the breeze a voice which would have inspired him with a, true ; sense , of the peril in which he stood. '. But he heard and saw nothing for which' he could not naturally account, and within a few minutes of midnight he re-entered his room. ''' , ? ' 'My neighbour has returned,' said Pierre Lamont, '?' after his nocturnal ramble— or was it . an assignation ? He . has-been absent long enough- for?1 ope. '.He has been living the' gay life of cities, and hasle'arnt much, no doubt. . Hark !' thatspundagairi! As of some: living thing stepping cautiously on th.e boards, ,; If I \ -:-icj.:v.

When will,, science supply /..? mail kind with; the. means of seeirig and hearing/what is transpiring pri the other sido of stone .and wooden walls? Ah ! that door of His is creaking. It opens — shuts. I hear a murmur of voices, but cannot catch a word. Balcombe'a voice of course — and the Advocate's ? No, the other, voice and soft footsteps are in part nership. Not the Advocate's, nor any man's;, -Men don't tread like cats. It, was a woman who pa3aod my door, and who has been admitted into . that room.: If a woman, what woman? Ah t if Pool Fritz were here, we would ferret it out between lis before we were a quarterof an-hour older. Still talking-stalking like tho soft murmur of peaceful waves. Ah ! a laugh ! ' By all that's natural, a woman's laugh ! It is a woman ; and I should know that silvery sound. There is a special music in a laugh which cannot be mis taken. It is distinctive, characteristic. Ah ! my lady, my lady : fair face, false heart,; but woman, woman all over I' And Pierre Lamont rubbed h'ia hands, and also laughed ; but his laugh was. like his apeech — silent, voiceless. ' V. CHAPTER XXVI. — MIDNIGHT VISITORS. Upon Arthur Baloombe's desk lay the envelope containing the note written by Adelaide. He saw it the moment he enr teredthe room, arid he took' it up, and 'looked fora name upon it: -Npne wa3iwrit; ten, and it was sealed. ' It was clear that some peraon had been in the room during his absence. . He opened the door of his bedroom ; a lamp was burning there, throwing a soft light around, and the room was empty. In his sitting-room once more, he, stood quite, still with, the un opened note in his hand, as if he dreaded tu xuurii i&a; uuzibuuLa. otiuuuuiy xig thoiight that'it riiust have been tlie Advo cate who had come to the .room, and who, finding hinvabsent, had left the . .note.fori him. With' a'aigh of relief f he' tore open the envelope^ and as he did so a faint per fume floated from it. The feeling'of relief he had experienced, was instantly replaced by one of uneaaih'es's. ' It is from Ade-, laide,' ? he murmured. 'Imprudent! Imprudent ! ' : How ' often- have I warned her !'' He read' the note ':— -' Dear 'Love, -pTcarinPt sleep until I wiah you good night, with no horrid( people around USi Come to me immediately, for one minute only. — For ever and for ever yours, Ade laide !' '?? ' '?????'?:?? ????' ?-? ?'; ? . | Go to her at. that hour within a few minutes ? of ; -midnight' ! ' -'? ? Impos sible ; what madness, what madness, to think or sucUa- tnirig1! ' 'Surely she ih'as notbeenj here,!' thought Balcombe ; ' she: would not have' risked discovery by such a step.. But if she has not been here, another hand must have' placed this riote. upon my desk, and another person must share the secret I 'libped would never have been recalled. I. must -warn her. I must be firm with her.' Happily we are not surrounded b'y§ prying1 eyes, and happily, too, there is' no room in Edward's nature for' suspicion1.', , He blushed with shame at' this unworthy thought. ? Five years' ago,' covild- he ; have seen — he who had never1' in his' life Btooped to meanness or deceit— the posi tion in which he now stood he could' haVe rejected if with burning indignation aa'a. monstrous impossibility. ? ' But by what easy steps had he reached it. He looked down at his -feet and the - scattered rose leaves around them. Ah! the dangerous hours of the past,1 ' when ? love was con fessed, acknowledged, returned !r Was-it: a'crime, then, to behappy ? . :Was: love. a sin?. If so,- all nature lied,., and all 'the natural'prom'ptings of the heart, were but so many luies; to ; destruction; 'The mistake we' clever men. here, .make,'. he thought, with , a bitter smile,-' 'has, been to surround ourselves with' false'dodtriries of honour and friendship; which , cut into us liko sharp steel.1'', His 'heart'. 'fleemed to stop beating at the sound of a light, fopt-., step without. ' He went to the door' and ' listened. He heard a' soft tapping 'upon the panel, not with the ' kriuckleB, but 'with finger-tips. He opened the door,, and Adelaide stood smiling before, him. With the. finger at her lips, she .stepped into the room, and with ; her , p^n ' hand closed tho door behind her., ,y 'It would not do for any one to -see,' she whispered ; ' I shall not be here1' a minute. I have only come to wishyou good night. Give meachair,or 1 'shall' sink to the. ground ; I am really very, very, frightened, but you will protect me: will you. not, for you are a' mari^ and you love me?' She had taken his hand in hers during this speech, and when Bhe finished shejprosaed her soft lips upon it, ' Quiok, Arthur, quick, bring me a, chair, or I shall fall into your arms.' He drew a chair towards her, and she sank languidly intojit. ' As you would not come to me,' she said, 'I was compelled- to come to you.' ???,.' : ,.;?. !,? ??.??.' , . 'Compelled!' he said. ''They both spoke in a very low tone, fearful lest their voices should travel beyond the room. 'Yes, compelled. I am1; urged by a spirit to do as I do.' .' .' ?.' His face grow white.
