ßiQ>msi W&M; OM th® Bm &@§á* BY AN OLD MAIL-DRIVER. III.-THE UBIQUITOUS BUSHRANGERS. THE third adventure that I had with bushrangers was on a different line of road. For a short time, I was driving for one [of i th ose small mail contractors whose inability to properly horse their very inferior coaches is the cause of so much of the discomfort complained of by passengers on some of thc branch lines. Three times a week had I to leave a certain township in the evening at six o'clock, and was supposed to be in Goulburn the next morning at seven o'clock ; but it frequently happened that when the roads were at all heavy the unfortunate overworked and underfed horses were unable to do their work, while at such time something was sure to happen to the Ticketty shandradans, yclept coaches, to which they were harnessed, and thus instead of arriving at my destination at the proper hour, noon was iu these cases nearer my hour of arrival, when certain imaginary creeks had to be reported as flooded to prevent the well deserved fine being inflicted upon the contractor ; for I knew well that all such penalties were invariably paid by the horses, who, poor creatures, when their owner was fined, had to suffer by having even their usual small allowance of forage docked to a Btill smaller I did not remain long on this line you may be sure, for when I found the promises of the contractor, made when I first engaged with him, to be all moonshine, I recommended him to obtain a bullock-driver to enable him to carry out his contract, as I did not intend to remain after the end of the month. Just before the expiration of my time I one evening left the post office in - at the usual hour, and as the roads were in very fair order I hoped to be in Goulburn in proper time the next morning, should the ricketty old coach hold together. I had only one passenger, who sat on the box seat until about 10 p.m., when he got inside to try and have a sleep. About one in the morning I had to pass a deserted selection, called Dyson's farm, where a girl had been brutally murdered, under circum- stances of great barbarity, some years previously, since which time the place had the name of being haunted, and there were many really plucky young fellows fin other respects) who would not pass Dyson's farm after dark, and who, if obliged to come along that road, would make a detour so as to cross the willow-banked creek, which ran past uie deserted Homestead, a mile or two further up or down ; for it was asserted that the murdered girl was to be seen at times, rushing with dishevelled locks, in her night dress, through the surrounding bush, followed by her ravisher, while her screams were to be heard from afar off. I suppose, however, that it is only those persons who believe in such things who have the privilege of seeing them, for I passed the farm three nights a week for about two months, and even made a cut over what was once the garden of the ' homestead-when a fallen tree blocked my way-without ?ever seeing or hearing anything more startling than the melancholy whoo-hoop of the night owl as it glided from tree to tree, or the cries of amorous 'possums courting in the surrounding bush. Well, on the night I speak of I had arrived at Dyson's farm without any adventure at my proper time for passing it, the full moon shone down with, it struck me, unusual brightness, rendering every post and rail of the dilapidated fence around the clearing plainly visible ; I thought to myself that such a beautiful night would be just the one for a ghost to choose for his noctambu lations, and that if I were a ghost I should confine my earthly wanderings to such lovely nights, when suddenly, from the far side of the. farm, I saw two horsemen emerge from the bush and come through the broken fence on to the cleared ground. They, at any rate, thought I, are not afraid of the ghost, as they cantered across the farm towards me. As they approached I noticed that each carried a revolver in his hand, and I was quite prepared for it when they presented these weapons at me accompanying the act with an order to "bail up," which ] accordingly did ; they then enquired how many passeugeri I had, and, on being informed, ordered him to dismount fron the coach, but beyond making him show that he was unarmed they did not attempt to molest him, one of them then dismounted, and taking the mail bags off the rack commenced a search amongst their contents; the other bush- ranger remained on horseback in front of me with his revolver pointed at my head, and as I glanced along the barrel it struck me that his hand shook very much, and in a manner not at all consistent with the coolness of a professional bushranger, so I politely requested him to turn the muzzle some other way as it might go off. He hesitated, but on my repeating my request, the man who was searching the bags called out "Don't you hear, Johnny, turn that - revolver away from the driver, he's not going to bolt," and so to my relief the vibrating muzzle of the weapon was lowered towards the ground. It happened that previous to my leaving the township the postmaster, instead of placing the registered letter bag into one of the other mail bags, as is generally done, had handed it to me with instructions to hide it in some part of the coach, as it contained a large amount of money. I had accordingly placed it under my cushion, and had thought no more of it until from the bushrangers' conversation I learned that they were aware of this money being sent down and were eagerly searching for it ; it never struck them to ask for the registered bag, and of course I held my tongue about it also. The. two rangers, who addressed each other as Tommy and Johnny, appeared greatly disappointed at not getting a larger haul (their takings not exceeding some three or four pounds), and eventually they rode away quite disgusted with their luck. As Tommy and Johnny Clarke were then in the zenith of their power, and as my present line of road was within their suzerainty, I naturally came to the con- clusion that these were the "Knights of the Road" who had stopped me, and wondered at the trepidation or excitement of Johnny, which had caused his hand to shake in the manner it did when presenting his pistol at me ; I had paid particular attention to this same revolver, while it was aimed at my head, and had noted (although without any ulterior danger in so doing) that it was a Deane and Adam's, and that the spring or catch which confines the lever tb the side of the barrel was broken, to remedy which a piece of copper wire was twisted in a peculiar fashion around both lever and barrel, and, strange as it may seem, , I had been mentally calculating as I glanced down the barrel as to the effect this copper wire would have upon the accuracy of anyone's shooting. After gathering up the scattered letters I again made a start, and on arrival at the next post town I reported the matter to the postmaster, who had demanded the reason of my being so late, and the fact of my being stuck up by Tommy and Johnny Clarke was accordingly entered on my time bill. This postmaster was professedly a highly conscientious individual. He had a busy industrious niece residing with him, and as his trade flourished he built a grand new store, and as he stated it was built with money belonging to the niece (although many who had known her and her family wondered how ever she became possessed of means) he placed her name over the door, and soon it was well stocked, while his old store daily became more empty and unpros perous. To show the noble spirit which animated this good man, he, although, his niece was daily taking his trade from him, recommended all his customers to deal with her for those articles which he did not possess (the list of which daily augmented), and at last, unable to stand against the tide of fortune, he filed his schedule and handed over his store and stock to his creditors, and then went to reside with his prosperous niece aud assist her in the management of her rapidly increasing trade. The creditors did not get much out of the business thrown upon their hands, but his friends laudated him for the noble manner in which he had left himself penniless and given up everything ; some of his creditors wanted to know what the everything consisted of, but then they were un- grateful and unbelieving men, who looked not at these things from a proper point of view. But to show the ingratitude of the world, and nieces in particular, it hap- pened that some few months after the uncle had filed his schedule, and when the niece's business under' his able management had become flourishing and prosperous, a worldly gold digger saw her and married her, and then much to the astonishment of the good uncle claimed the store and business as his wife's property and turned the old mau adrift, but not without giving him enough to start him again in a small way in another place. Such ingratitude on the part of the niece of course caused much raising of the hands and eyes amongst the elect, and she and her digger husband were at once pronounced lost sheep and condemned by the elect to suffer hereafter for their conduct. But I must return to my tale as this digression has nothing to do with the sticking up part of the business. After delivering the rifled mail bags to the postmaster, who (although the Government orders were very strict on the subject, that all mails recovered from bushrangers were to be sealed up at once and forwarded to the G.P.O. to be sorted), I triumphantly produced the registered bag with its bright red seal intact, and handed it to him, remark- ing " This is safe at any rate, and contains I believe a large amount in notes ; " seizing it he examined the seal, and then appeared buried in thought for a while, looking at me at times over his spectacles with a queer look in his eyes, he enquired how I had managed to save it, and when I had informed him he placed it on the table with a sigh, remarking that I was not so sharp as he had thought I was, and that he had given me credit for more nous, but when I asked him in what way, he made no answer. Since then I have thought that I have penetrated that good man's meaning, and that if I had but broached the matter, we might have shared the contents of that bag between us and credited Messrs. Clarke Brothers with the loss. After I had left this post office I pushed on for Goulburn at my best pace, and on arrival there was astonished to find another . branch mail just arrived which had also been stuck up by the Clarkes the night previous, and strange to say, although the point where it vas stuck up was between twenty and twenty-five milos e.istaut as the crow flies from Dyson's farm, yet weic both the mails robbed at precisely the same hour ; as the driver of the other mail was personally acquainted with the Clarkes, he had no doubt whatever as I to their being the men who had stopped him, and the des- cription of my two robbers so tallied with his that I began to think that these two rangers must possess the power of doubling themselves, or of ubiquity. The police, however, solved the riddle in a most imperious manner, stating that both mails had been robbed by the Clarkes, and that the drivers were either asleep or their watches were wrong, and that one of us must have been stuck up at an earlier hour and the other at a later than we stated ; as there was no convincing these gentry that the decision they had arrived at might be erroneous (for even if our watches were wrong the exact spots we were both at when the robberies happened would be a sufficient proof of the time at which we were stuck up), we let them have their own way ; for as the other driver remarked, it pleased them, and did not hurt us, and besides they were paid for knowing these things, and so the Clarkes were reported as having robbed both mails, which I suppose did not trouble them. On the whole I think the individual most put out by this double robbery was the good postmaster, who could not get over the'-feel; of that registered bag. He is now engaged collecting subscriptions to build a new tabernacle in the bush somewhere, and as he is collector, treasurer, banker, and auditor, all combined, he is doing very well out of it and becoming daily more pharisaical and sanctimonious. About twelve months after this occurence, I (having ju the meantime obtained a billet on a well managed line) was despatched by my employers into the district where this robbery had taken place to purchase a few horses suitable for mail work ; one afternoon I arrived at the homestead of a well to do farmer, the extent of whose herds almost entitled him to be styled a squatter. As it was impossible he said, to yard any horses that evening, his boys being absent in the bush, my horse was sent to the stable for a feed before being turned out into the home paddock, while I was told to make myself at home till next morning. The bedroom appointed to me was that used by his sons, two young fellows about twenty and eighteen years of age, and before partaking of the tea and snack-the invariable offerings to the stranger in the bush-I went into this room to remove some of the stains of travel from my person: while thus engaged my eye fell on a revolver lying on the dressing table. Now a revolver is not an unusual thing in the bedroom of a young bushman, and I should have thought nothing of it were it not that the spring which confined the lever was broken, and it was fastened to the barrel in a peculiar manner with a piece of copper wire, and after carefully examining it I came to the conclusion that it was the identical revolver I had spent some minutes in looking down the barrel of. How it came there I could not imagine, but I had no doubt as to its identity. About sun- down the two sons returned from the bush, Frank and Fred by name, and a pair of fiiaer young chaps never threw their legs across a saddle; something about both of them seemed familiar to me, and when the next morning on looking over the horses I recognized in one of them the very horse which the man who had held that revolver was riding, I drew my own conclusions, and my suspicions were shortly to be verified ; for after dinner, when we were in the bedroom. I remarked to them as I picked up the revolver that I knew it. " That cannot be," laughingly remarked one of them, "as it was given to us some years ago by an uncle who brought it from home, and it has never been out of our pos- session." " That matters little," I replied; " less thai* eighteen months aero I was driving the Goulburn and-mail and that revolver was pointed at my head by a young mau, who at the time was riding that chestnut horse, with the star and snip and white hind foot, now in the yard. I thought at the time I was bailed up by the Clarke's, but now, I know differently." For a minute or two my announcement was received in dead silence, and then the elder turned to me frankly and confessed to the deed ; he said that he and his brother were pushed for some money and thought they would secure the cash that they knew was going down by that mail, which, however, they had not succeeded in doing, four pounds being the total of their "haul;" they added that never again would they try such a daugerous game on, for, for along time afterwards, they had led a miserable life, fancying every stranger they saw approaching the station was. either a policeman or a detective, and it was only within the last few months that they had began to have any peace of mind. I promised never to mention the matter, aud this greatly relieved their anxiety, and that evening I noticed that the revolver was gone, hidden somewhere I expect, where it could tell no tales. Years have passed since then and both these young men are married and are fathers of families, one is a i J.P., and both are respected and useful members of society. I Some there are who may blame me for not rushing off and I informing the police of the discovery I had made, but I blame myself in no way for not doing so, such a proceeding on my part would have been the means of driving two young men (who had already seen the error of their ways and turned from the evil course in which they had taken the first step) to perdition, and also of ruining the peace and happiness of an estimable family, without in any way benefiting anyone. No, as my fellow- driver remarked the day after the occurrence, "The police are paid for knowing all these things, and they most positively asserted that the Clarkes had stuck up both mails, and so it must have been them," consequently, I determined to let them remain happy in their ignorance.
