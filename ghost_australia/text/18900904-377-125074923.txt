Foote made thepresenta. tio', on behalf of the recipient's fellow em. ployees, in a seat and complimentary speech, and wished himevery happiness and prosperity in his new state. Mr. Williams, who was conDeiderably taken alack by the good feeling displayed towards him by the other hands, thanked the donors most heartily for their gift, and stated that be would always keep it in remembrance of them. As will be seen from the handbills atcomc panyiog to-day's issue, the members of the Weeleyan Improvement and Debating Clas will repeat the now famons "Trial of Banoeful Alcohol," in Rollo's Hall, North Ipswibch, to morrow evening, at 7 45 p.m. We understand that great preparation has been made, and everything is now complet', Any person wishing to spend an entertaining and istrec rive eveniog cannot do better than go and witness this great trial.

The Rev. T. Jones occupied the chair. As it was an open night, there was a very good at' tendacoe of visitors. Magazine business was the order of the evening, and it was a very excellent production, being read by Messrs. Griffith and Beaumont, editors. After the reading of the magazine, several of the mem bers spoke of the able manner in which the third number of the quarterly magazine had been worked up, and a vote of thanks was so. corded to the editors, and their contributors, for their efforts to make it a snocess. A RoosWOOD correspoodent states that the farmers there are mostly in sympathy with the ship owners, and, should it come to a general strike, they intend to go, and fill the vacancies they are qnualified for, as rot one in ten was originally a farmer;gasE-atokers, dockers, bakers, Ae., being some among the many trades repre sented in the Rosewood. Bao you forgotten WOLFs'S SONAPrrs ? [Aovr.] Tan Rev. Charles Clark delivered a lecture on "Westminster Abbey," in the School of Arts, on Tucesday evening last. Theattend ance was elightly larger than on the previous night, but was not nearly so good as the bril liant lecturer deserved. Those who were absent missed a treat that is seldom afforded an Ipiwich audience, and those who were pre sent will regret that they could not have another opportunity of listoring to the gifted gentleman, whose atterances claimed rapt at tention from the beginning to the close of his remarks. His word paintings were of the most entrancing character, and weoe euch that many could almost fancy themselves being led through the old historic abbey, viewing the resting places of the illnstrious dead and the noble army of workers who are "not dead, but gone before." Henry V.'s address to his colliers-"Once more unto the breach, dear friends"-was recited with a power that made the scene almtes realistic, and the "poet's corner" was feelingly dwelt upon. The lecturer was warmly and frequently applauded, and the loud and continued applause, at the eloe of she lecture, showed unmistakably that it had been appreciated. MacY will be sorry to hear of the death of Mrs. Fletcher (one of the oldest reeidents of the Laidley district), who died at the residence of her son-in law, Mr. S. Cooper, on Saturdas last. She was eighty-four years of age, and was w ll.known and deeply respected in this towo and district. Some of the oldest resi denrts will remember that for some time she red'ded in Nicholas street, almost on the site of the present radilway over-bridge. The de' e'a'ed arrived in Australia over fifty years ago, and, after residing in New South Wales f,,r sin years, she came to this portion of Qoeensland, where she has been living ever oaner. She was interred on Sunday last, and t.e funeral was the largest that has ever taken place mi Laidley.

The proceedings were opened by a pianoforte solo by Miss Brady, skilfully played, and a number of humorous and instructive readings and recita- tions were given by different members, besides an original paper read by Miss Cooney. The evening was very enjoyable. The practice of holding two meetings a week will, probably, again be resorted to, '"CAPTrAIN" HOOPR, st one time captain of the Ipswich branchb of the Salvation Army, has been transferred from West Maitland to a station in tbhe United States.

Mr. Joseph Ivett kin fly undertook the connective readings, whilst Master Reichart presided at the organ, lent for the occasion by Mr. 8. Lewis, the superintendent of the institution. A good sprinkling of the general public pat in an appearance. During the execution of the piece, an interval of ten minutes afforded an oppor tunsty of serving out refreshments (which con asisted of coffee and buns), to the inmates, numbering about sixty, and to those who teok part intheentertainment. One patient became rather noisy, and had to be removed by the attendante, but the remainder conducted them. selves very quietly. At the oonelusion of the entertainment, Mr. Lewis proposed a hearty vote of thanks to Mr. Walker, the choir, the visitors, paying a high compliment to all who had assisted in any way to vary the monotony of asylum life, not only to the inmates, but also to the attendants, who have long and dreary hours of duty. This was seconded, in a few well chosen words, by Mr. Hurst, who paid the superintendent and his staff a high compliment for the attention bestowed upon those nder their care. The singing of a verse of the National Anthem, by the whole com pany, brought a very pleasing evening to a lee. SvT. STEPENs'S Presbyterian Band of Hope held their usual monthly meeting in the sohool-room on Tuesday evening last. Mr. fastie occupied the chair, and opened the meeting in the usual way. There was a good attendance, end a first- rate programme was gone through, consisting of songs, recitationa, and dialogues. The manner in which some of th'se items were executed was very creditable.

The attendance showed a alight improvement compared with that of the previous night. The ,ev. Joseph Walker having signed the roll, as member, for Oxley, took his seat on the erose- benohee. On the motion of the Colonial Treeasurer the lionse went into committee for the further consideration of the taxation pro posals. The Colonial Seoretary (Mr. D. R. O'Sullivan), opened the debate, and in a good speech supported the views of the Treasurer. He replied to the arguments brought forward by the Leader of the Opposition on the pre vnous night, and wound up a long speech by expressing his opinion that the proposals were just and necessary at the present time. He approved of the tax on gold (export), as it touchedthose best able to bear the burden. He combatted the idea of such a tax interfer ing with the indnstry, as, by the impost, trade or commerce would not suffer. He favoured the tax on imported coal, as it would stimulate the local industries and remunerate the toiling classes. The duty on beer and spirits habd his entire sympathy. Divisional Boards and municipalities were next referred to. He said the Government bad no idea of running away from their land tax. Divisional Boards would be compelled to increase the levy now made, which, after all, wnuld be a land tax. (No, no.) The Government reongnised the necessity of reducing the Defence Force, and their intontion was merely to keep a small nucless of trained men and revert to the volunteer system. (Applause.) After the Colonial Secretary's epeeob, the debate became general, Masers. Parlane, M'Vey, and Har greaves speakingfromtheGovernment b anohe, while Messrs. George Harrison, W. Wilson, and S. H.

[Aonr.] 62 A SYnDwY paper states that a great waste of fruit is gomng on jouet now in Central Comber. land, the prices ruling in the markets not paying for picking. One leading grower, who has the best oranges in the district, has so far this season buried 1500 cases of oranges in his orchard, rather than place them on the market in the face of present prices. Are there no poor people in the Central Comerland distriot to whom these 1500 oases of oranges would have proved a welcome donation ?

It is to be hoped that, as no official intimation has been received by the Board as regards the Bnal st:pa of severanoe, the whole question will be opened again, as many of the ratepayere are anxious to keep the division intaot.-There is now a general cry for rain, as one arly all the tankse in the township are empty.

Some farmers who have succeeded, by dint of hari work, to bring a few acres inasofeciently good state to plant, have sown their early crops in vain. It is now a well-rscognised fact that there will be no early crop this year at all. I was informed, by one of the many farmers who are compelled to draw a supple of water from the Governmenot dam, that the water is quite brackish, and unfit fordrinkitg or house hold purposes. This is. a .atter of deepest regret, as the majority of the inhabitants will, before long, if the drought continues, be comm pelled to patronise this reservoir. Do yon remember WOLF'e SrnarrWps!
