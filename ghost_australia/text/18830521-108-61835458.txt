ORIGINAL CO1IRESPONDEXNCE. SOUTH WARD ELECTION. (To the Editor of the GippJland Times.) Sen,-Tho ratepayers of. the South Wardt I think, will not find the task of selocting a representative for tile Cohndil to-day, a very difficult one; of the two aspirants for the position, Mr Harkness commends himself to us as a respected and old resident of the town, a good, careful business imar, and possessed of more than average intelligence and common sense, besides being a man whose honor and in. togrity no one can say one word against Mr 'Platt has been such a stranger fdr many years that he is personally unknown to all except very old residents of the town, and although I have nothing to say againet him as a man, the ratopayers should not lose sight of the fact that w?hen Mr Platt was a member of tirhe orough Council some years ago. h rrvoly put is an appearance at the mootings, except when compelleod to do so in order to save his sdnt from being declared vacant, and his frequent absences from Sale prevented him giving anything like the attention to his duties that a Burough Councillor should do. It is well known that Mlr Platt's business loads him away roam Sale and it must be clear to vyoryone possess. ing a grain of on?mmoÂº sense, that Mr Harkness \iauld in all probability give more tieno and attention to the duties than Mr Platt could possibly do. But comparing the men themselves, Mr Platt is not equal to his opponent in any of the qualities that a public repreasentative should possiess, and were he not brought forward by two or three men who fancy that thei whole managemoent and pro. priehtry of the Borough is perpetually vested in them lie would not have the ghost of a show. I trust however, that the South Ward ratepayers will calmly consider their own interests and return Mr Harknoes at the head of the pull. Yours, respectfully, SOUTI[ WA?lbD
