[?] THE ROMAN PASTORALSâ€” A CHAL LENGE TO PROTESTANTS. " Behold Rome creeps along her tangled way, To-morrow teaching all she taught to-day ; Through the same maze her trodden steps renew, Still unprogressive, for without a clue. Confute her doctrines ; spite of all your pain, Tbeir ghosts are never laid, but walk again. Sever one head? a thousand added grin. O'erthrow her ; keener must the Btrife begin : The touch of kindred earth new strength sup plies, But hold her up to heaven, the monster dies."
