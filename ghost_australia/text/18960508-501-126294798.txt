How Ghost Stories Arise. A correspondent writes in the T. and G. Journal : â€” A funny thing happened to me, the other evening which, might amuse your readers. I was going to a concert, and asked a cabman his fare into town. He .told' me, and 1 said ,f,All right,' and went ' to fetch my friend. As we walked towards the cab stand, however, I was surprised to see iny Jehu whip up his horse and drive quietly off. I called to. him in dulcet accents, but he heeded not till a by stander kindly exerted his masculine lungs 011 my behalf, and succeeded in bringing him to a standstill. We over took him a few minutes later, and I asked him why he lmd gone off in such a hurry, and lie replied that, in the dark ness, he thought I had got inside. I could not help laughing to think what his astonishment would have been had he arrived at his destination and waited for his fare to alight. If at all super stitious he would certainly have told everyone that he had driven a lady to to\yn who had suddenly vanished into thin nir, but as I have no desire to figure as the heroino of a ' well authenticated ghost story,' I am glad I undeceived him in time.
