VICTORIA AMATEUR TURF CLUB. -. THE OPENING DAY. The most important race meeting ever held on the Caulfield course will be commenced to-day, when the Victoria Amateur Turf Club have for the first time attempted a two days' meeting, the programme of which speaks well for the pluck and liberality of the committee of management. There is every probability that their enterprising venture will meet with that ample patronage on the part of the racing loving public of Victoria which it so well deserves, The committee have done their best to ensure success, and they have had the advantage of the skill and long experience in racing matters of Mr N, R. D. Bond, in the important post of secretary, to assist them in raising the club from the position of a second, or even third, rate club to rank with the leading racing institutions in Australia. From its position in the list of racing fixtures at the opening of the Victorian season, the Caulfield meeting generally excites much interest among racing men ; but, in addition to this attraction, the club have put forward a programme which, while it gives a chance to racehorses of ordinary merits to earn their oats, contains events that are rich enough to be worth winning by the best performers on the turf. He Puerto the second strings in the various stables were thought good enough to contend at the Caul- field Spring Meeting, but this year the crime de la creme of the Australian turf will be found among the competitors for the Guineas and the Caulfield Cup, while our most aristocratic youngsters will take part in the Great Foal Stakes. These races will afford a good indication of the way the V.R.C., Maribyrnong Stakes, the Derby, and the Melbourne Cup will go, and, indeed, they will to a considerable extent reduce the interest taken by the public in those events. The programme for to-day's racing commences with the Selling Race, for which there is a good field engaged. From this race the club funds may possibly receive a welcome subsidy. The Hurdle Race has an excellent field of well-tried performers across the hurdles. As yet there has been very little speculation on any events save the Foal Stakes, the Guineas, and the Cup, so there is no indication as to the feelings of the stables respecting their chances of carrying off the prize. The next event is the Great Foal Stakes, in which some remarkably well-bred youngsters will take part. This is to be an annual event, and we may naturally look forward to an increasing interest being taken in it, both by the owners of racehorses and the public. Several of these youngsters have already performed in public, while others have done so well in private trials that they have been supported to a considerable extent in the betting. With such youngsters as Saionara, Iphigenia. Fryingpan Satanella, Creme de Souza, and Mr, de Mestre's well-bred youngsters engaged in it, the race could not fail to be interesting. The next race is one of even greater importance than the Foal Stakes, namely, the Caulfield Guineas. The field for this event will not be a large one, but as the company will be very select, and as the distance is only one mile, a brilliant race with an exciting finish should be witnessed by the visitors to the Caulfield course this afternoon. Santa CIBUB corner with the reputation of having done so well in private that he has been advanced to the head of the betting. Wheatear, the winner of the A. J.C Derby, has a little the call of him in the betting. Royal Maid is also a great favourite for this race. If she has done well since last season she should be very dangerous, especially as she has the advantage of being trained in the St. Albans stable. Koh-i-noor and Duke have proved themselves good colts, and Lavinia ran a dead heat with Welcome Jack in last year's Maribyrnong Plate. Doncaster, Pell Melb, and Topaz are well enough bred for anything. Liberator is another remarkably well-bred colt, but he is looked on as an unlikely starter. The Corinthian Race, which follows, will be an interesting event. The public evidently enjoy a race with gentlemen riders up. The day's racing will conclude with the Toorak Handicap, for which a large field is engaged. The first race will start at half-past 1 p.m. Trains will run from the Prince's-bridge station at the following times:-11.17a.m.; 12.20,12.47,12 57, and 1.20 p.m. The return trains will commence running at 6 p.m., and at as close intervals after as possible. His Excellency the Governor has signified his intention of attending the meeting. For the convenience of the public and the press &.teleiOftRhJlta'>PJB key bSS8vÇr"Sgtf$,SSvthse The wet weather has suited the course admirably, having washed the light dressing of loam spread over the running ground into the cracks. In order to avoid inconvenience at the station and at the entrance to the course, tickets for the grand stand reserve will be sold at Messrs. Thomas Cook and Son's, tourist agents, Melbourne Exchange. A weighing machine has been placed in the jockeys'' room, so that they may ascertain their weight. It is anticipated there will be no waste of time at scale. The committee have decided that the penalties for late scratching shall be strictly enforced.
