Nobelist THE MYSTERY OF MAJOR MOLINEUX BY MARCUS CLARKE CHAPTER IV. IN another instant I was at the head of the stairs, but paused in my onward flight for the sounds issued from the room occupied by Beatrice and her mother. Mrs. Rochford was lying on the floor senseless. Ringing the bell furiously, I raised her to her bed, and, with the assistance of the old Roman, whom the ones of the un- happy lady, not less than my im- portunate summons, had brought to the spot, I succeeded in restoring her to consciousness. Her first words were : "Is it gone ?" "What ?" I asked. "The white face at the window !" said Mrs. Rochford. "That im- ploring, maddened face !" "What can she mean ?" asked Mary Pennithorne, but the old woman, moping and mowing, made no reply. '?*' See, madam,' I said, flinging wide the lattice, 'the storm has passed, and with it the cause : of your alarm. $ome leafy branchlet carried by the wind, perhaps, even some more wrathful gust than usual, has. while rousing ,you from sleep, given form to a passing dream. Look, the sky is almost cloudless.' ' ? , ? , .'.'?? ' And) in truth, the tempest, had, during the . time we had been .occupying ourselves with the fright- ; cned woman, quite] psised away. The. -scene was. one of exquisite peacefulness. £The clouds had almost withdrawn, and the wet trees sparkled in the beams of a glorious' moon, which rode high in a serene; heaven.' All felt the influence ofj the^ecene. ..Beatrix, ,'fliink in. her: stupor, alone was ignorant alike of sounds and tights | but her mtther composed herself with a smile at her former fears, and, as I sought my comfortable couch, J felt that science and sentiment ^uke bid me laugh althe i ungrfttefulfanoies which an trtmosphere' surcharged with elec tricity;, could breed ip. - brain nsuallysocoolas minei .

The language was bfthe politest, but there was- no mistaking its meaning. Bochford and I looked at each other.' It was quite evident that Major Molineux did not desire thatwe should pass another Thurs day under his roof. ' T tmst that Miss Boehford mav he able to travel to her own home before this day week,' said I, Borne what pointedly. ? 'In the mean time; let me thank yon for the (courtesy with which we were re ceired, and especially for tlie hospi tality of last night.' The hand with which the Major was lifting the tea-cup to his lipB trembled slightly, but he said, merely, 'It w4s a wild night— a night of storms. I tmst you were not disturbed.'- ' : ' I was most terribly disturbed,' said Mrs. Bochford— Ithink I have said that she was not a woman of mucn xorce ot -onarac^er, or (juici ness of apprehensionr-' I had the most shocking dreams. A white face at *he window—' 'Notfeense, Mary,' interrupted Bochford; 'you were nervous.' ' ' There is no one in the house butmyselfand the two servants,' said the Major, who had completely re ?gained his composure, 'a&d; I am sure neither; of them, would liave the temerity to disturb your slum bers. ^wy.'Vba added, turning in stiff condescension to old Bagally, ,4lhave you been amusing yourself by terrifying my guesisT1 The old man seemed dumb stricken. He tried to* speak, but words failed him.

The prospects of the patient's reoovery the punishment' to be meted out to the. self- indulgent,, bullock-driver, the quality of Sultan's temper, and the equestrian skill of Miss Booh jforS, were lall debated in turn, A learned disoussion. was held upon fracture of the skull, and I wai compelled to illustrate as best I might the operation of the trephine, At last exhausted with surgery, and convinced that he was tnorougniy competent to treat a similar case should he ever meet with ope, Rochford betook himself to visit the scene of the accident, and left me alone with.our host. , , if.;.- 1fit]!»Anv o a am an itTlAAfiV.'

Determined to penetrate the secret ?which I was now convinced existed, I pressed my advantage. 'I see that you 'study the higher mathe matics. This calculation on. the variation of parameters is not made iby rscbool-boy, while here.'* — and' I lifted -from the table a sheet of paper— 'is something headed, 'Pro bability that an event obutved teve faltvMt in meeuion depend* upon a caw which faeilUaUi itt repro eduction,' in which the calculation' is made by finding the equation of Major Molineux changed colour, 'and took the paper from my hands. |' I did not know that I had left the records of. my folly thus carelessly ;exposed,' said he. ' The fact is that ITiave always been a lover of janything which approaches an exact science, and the calculation of IprobabUities is a fascinating sub ijeot. I am foolishly fond of it,' land, as he spoke, he tore the paper {into pieces and flung them into the i basket at his feet. ' Some men say that mathema ticians are mad,' I said. ' If this bt so, you have the antidote as well as the bane, for seldom have I seen, even in the libraries of my professional brethren, bo fine _ a collection of works on Mental Dis- , case as that which I examined last1 night.' I had gone too far for his patience. 'Doctor Fayre,' said he, 'you are my guest, and my house is at your disposal so long as the illness of my old friend's daughter compels you to remain in it ; but let me re mind you that an old man who lives by choice a recluse may have pought such seclusion, in order tha he might be spared these very com* ments upon his private tastes whicl you have just be*en pleased t- make,' and, boning stiffly, he left the room. CHAPTEB V. He did not appear that day, nor at breakfast the next morning. I felt that I deserved the reproach which his 'absence conveyed, ana was angry with myself' for having so far permitted my curiosity to outrun my discretion. But the more I reflected upon the ciroum| stances of the Case, the more con vinced did I become that Castle Stuart held within its walls some mystery of mind or body upon the ilCn nt rnnVtit*Y% *f nrOQ Tlrtf rtlfffln +J\ man to frequently look; and, despite the Major's rebuff and my own self- consciousness, I resolved not to abandon my quest. In pur suance of this resolution I saunj tered out into the garden the nex(j afternoon, thinking to fall in with; the old servant. I was not .disj appointed. I found him standing in a little glade, or opening in thi brushwood, staring with all hid might at the upper windows of the house. ? ? ? ? ' ' ' What interests you ?' I cried; taking a guinea from my pocket. ' Can you not spare time for a' little friendly chat?'

It was the Major's Thursday, and I daren't go near him for my soul. I crept to the door, thinking some traveller had got out of his track, for no one who knew us would come to Castle Stuart;, but before I could open it there was an awful screeoh, and something went whirling round the house like a pack of dogs. I heard them bellowing and grunting in the back, and .ran upstairs to look. I lookeS out of that ? window'— he 'pointed to the room where Mrs. Bochford had slept the night before—' and I saw Bontething like a herd of huge swine on, Savary's grave, rooting, and snarling, and slavering in it, and then I slammed to die window, for some awful thing with a white face wafe there trving to save itself' from those helliBh beasts. The noise continued for five or six minutes, and then the sky oleared like it did last night, and I Baw no more.' . 'You have a oheerful imagina tion, my friend,' said I; 'but, pray, do you couple this delectable story with your master's day of seclusion ?' Onoe more the ugly look came into bis face. 'May, I knew nothing of that; and it's no busi ness of yours either, though you are ft doctor. Doctors cannot cure Major Molineux's comphint.' ' Then you think that he is ill ?' ' Not- 1 ; he's well enough.' ' Look ye, Bagally,' I said, de termined to try' a last chanoe, 'you are too sensible a man to believe this nonsenBe about ghosts, and suicides, and hunted souls.

'He is possessed by a devil,' said ? Bagally ; and then, as if he had said too much, made for the house with grotesque, uneven strides, and left me standing in the coarse grass* that .sprung from the dishonoured grave where the sui cide lay with a stake through his heart.
