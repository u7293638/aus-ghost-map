Compensation. The hope that illumines the way of life . Is a will-o'-the-wisp that afar Leadeth through mazes of toil and strife, A ghost in the guise of a star. Then why should I oovet a share, sweetheart, Of the laurels with whioh they are crowned, Who vanquish, if no one will care, sweetheart, When I am under the ground ? Transient and fleeting the light of love That indifference shadoweth soon, Fairest illusion will often prove A blight where we hoped for a boon. Thus memory crushes my soul, sweetheart, With the bandage in which I am bound Till destiny deal out my dole, sweetheart, And I am under the ground ! Fruit is a dreamfield of youth's bright day, With life in its beauty and bloom, Happy the reapers who bear away Its fruits, at the harvest time, home. Bnt bitter the sorrowful thought, sweetheart, Though my name may be widely renowned ; How barren the waste where I wrought, Bwetthear1, When I am under the ground ! Joyous the day with its toils and tears, And troubled the visions of night, Dreary the gloom of the passing years, In their lonely monotonous flight. 'Tis but in remembering thee, sweetheart, That my life's compensation is found ; Thou'lt cherish my mem'ry and me, sweetheart, When I am under the ground !
