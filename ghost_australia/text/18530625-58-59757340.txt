Let us be Merry, just to-night. Bury the past, forget the morrow, Let us be merry--just to-night! Our souls all bear the brand of sorrow, Our by-gone hopes are black with blight; But let's be merry--just to-night! Stir up the fire, put on the wine-- Let us be merry--just to-night! The stars in silvery sadness shine, What was walks ghost-like in their light; But we'll be merry--just to-night! Come tell the tale, and sing the glee, Let us be merry--just to-night! Our hearts are out at revelry, They blink like bats, at all things bright, But let's be merry--just to-night! Stand up! a toast with honors due-- Let us be merry--just to-night! Dear friends, the trustful and the true, No more to us their love may plight; But we'll be merry--just to-night. Flash forth the wit, pour out the fun-- Let us be merry--just to-night! Dropping in silence, one by one, Like Autumn leaves we pass from sight; Then let's be merry--just to-night! Tick--tick! The clock is hurrying on-- Let us be merry--just to-night! Loved ones, like summer clouds, are gone, Dreams, like scared birds, have taken flight; But we'll be merry--just to-night! R. R. Sydney, June 20, 1853.
