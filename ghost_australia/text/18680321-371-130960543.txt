After the tea meetfng' the tables were cleared away, and 'the ehapel arranged for the-' reception of the audience. The chapel was soon wellinigh filled by the assemblage, and the Kev. Thomas Uord coftimenced the pro ceedings 'by giving ont a hytnn. which was -song, and after» ards the Bev. J- G. Millard engagedin prayer. Tbe Rev. Mr. i x^o^tt- apologised for occupy ing the chair. Mr. JameS ScOtt 'had been invited to attend and pwside. tRxt ws» c-bliged' to decline' from ill-hfealtb. At 'their atmiv^r- j sary it was customary only to allnde to't&e;* financial position of the fhurdi, not to it»l Spiritual condition. This Iras the 17th anni ▼erswy olf the Gawler Weeleyan Church, and although there might not be so larg-e an attendance as might be wished, through the visit ation i^i the drop?, he was glad to see all the 'friends present. Jhete had been other1 gei-vices held during the year in eonneetian -wi{h {he new chf.pel-. lectures, '4e., -which might perhaps account for the spavse^tten-' dance. They were assembled Chat evening to pay the interest on a loan 6l J6200 'which had just been contracted with the loan frrad in Adelaide The principle of this fund waft, that it was to be repaid by'20 per cent, insta'taents. As they had received a £ 209 loan before, JE49 would be icquired In October, and if about half of this was raised there and then, no: doubt the other woaJd be forthcoming by pew-rsWts. ®e Vronld-5all npon the Treasurer. Mr. J. Wilkinsoft, to read the financial report. The report was then read by Mr. Wilkinson, : and it shewed 'that the year's income had been about JSI21 *s.1»a., *»d fhe expenditure XI 25 : 10s. 'fid., leaving a balance due to the Treasurer of £i 7s. 4cL The Treasurer explai»e5 that money was wajtted, and it tuust be had \hat evening. If it wa!s not paid, they Would have to call special meetings, and raise the money somehow. He also hoped that all thte seat, rents now due ifrould*he at jjnee pai I. The choir then ppndered an aSitherd in ia very pleasing «td able manner. ^ J The Rev. T. iiOTo tnen afiud&d; 'in feeling t I terms to the mnrderons -attack lately made on ; H.R.H. the Bake of Editfburgh, and bespoke J the sympathies dt tte andienee lb* H.R.H. i Aa a Ciuriatian and loyal people, he thought f ^bey should txoW sins t the fest verse of the ! National Anthem. This was done with great iBth usiasm. The Fen J, Gosoox then addressed the igaembfagfe. and r-^retted the physical lswsi ude under which he was- suff«4ng. . Lord $ro*jgham had givto advice tft a youh^ neaker to speak,if abont nothing. Thra part 4 hia (Ifljr, Cfordolk's) education bad been neglected- He haAfffife he-m to&wl; that the cWeh^tw^ iUfi^flwer^Mpet.hing. and the choir had feuug b^AtOT than«vmr he heard them befor?. He did not likejto heir too beantifnl mueie, as it aeemed to be robbed d iis spirituality. He liked to sae^e^cho ir near, to the preacher, as both spoke totjhe con,. negation. J^ately he bad boen pl?«s»d with the piety -of an old saint whom he had met. These old saints weie something Jifce -fche old ? standard works, the binding of which' was made .to wear, and contrasted f&vorafciy; with ; the new ^ditiona we now had givea -to nvi which alihost required handlipg with kid. gloves. - '*he old ssunts were Bible C^uwtaians. and drarit deeply from the streawe vt salva tion iBsuhug-'from the Bible. Let people read the Word -of ^od rather than the slip^slop, flimsy publications of the present dcy. 5^6 old saints hisd & deeper religious inner life than the modern Ones, and he was 'not favor. = able to the too sudden transmission f,-om seeming indifference to earnest piety*: There - was a loag struggle with tlxe passions of our evil .nature ,4o be engaged jm. The' foundations 'of a spiritual life Sioaid^e had deeply, and .its possessor should be earnest* and devoted. People at the present time were* ambitious and self indulgent. Thej*» was the Bunyip often tellihg them that long eprmons : were tedious, wd wearisome. He did not' advocate long services in * his hot climate, Imt : he did hope- people w^uld not think mach of the proper time that ^iould be devoted to the, service of religion. . ^ . The choir then rendered another ;an0iem. - 1'he Eev. T, Io.oTi- -alluded to tie Ten Hoars Bill which had been so cervieife&fe;^o the factory operatives. He haj h e^ of a j preacher who had preached an immense long sermon. an-t4» spite him his clerk afterwards gave out the 119th Psalm, which kept then in i church two hours longer. An agitation was on foot for shorter services, and he did think j that in this not climate services sfco.uld not b? too long. He would call upon the Rev. J. G. I Millard. 1 The JRev. J. G. Mil&ard; hardly knev which to praise most, the speeches, the audience, or the music- '.The meeting had a good ring about it, as of a good coin. He thought it was good^ to, be here, in this atmosphere of good feeling, and religions enjoyment This was the '7th anniversary of their Bouse of God. The Sanctuary had been im-jortant from the earliest part of the world's history. Of it prophets had prophesied, and seers spoken. Kings considered it aq honor more than regal to take part in its services, ardGoi himself honored it with his visible presence. Now all this was applicable to the' present time. God could be worshipped without a material building, bub it was expedient tor have' a house to worship in. Truth and piety were immutable things, and through t^em we had a fellowship with those who kad gone - before us. There was a Divine proprietorship, as well as a residential use in a -sanctuary, i God required a free will offering at ihe hands of the children of men for the .maintenance of his house. This constituted him th» ffoprie tor of His house. In aaoinnt clays His taber nacle, though a moVeablfe one, was Valuable), as the gold and silver on it was wotth at the present currency, £200,000 The pe»pie gave' to it willingly, Th-?y a!s- idefr^fed the expenses of ^the magnificent Tetiipf ♦iiuilt to Him 'n later days. God bad been wnrshktBAd - in ti e present liouse, and He had the vtbrship. . God's house wax his rest, and Hb rested wherever He -wm ; shipped, wliethar on the TdHog- ship, pr'in thei magnificent Cithedral- The =«3ps -of 'God's house wei'e the preaching of the Word, and as a place where prayer was wont 'to be' made. ; The chapels of 'the land were its bulwarks. Of the centcCr'on in o3dei days it was said. 'That he loved the Jewish nation, imd had built them a synagogue.'' Sanctuaries were i a blessing to the people. No doubt some places -'where idotatry ' was taught HrjSrfe not national blewings. but be would like to see al! truly - Christian plaees ' of worship spreading like'tietwjsrk. If they were destroyed, tu^fht. not 'Ichabod' be written on the land. Look at the ''Cations of old, which now like ghosts seeaae I to-waik whero once they were located. Look at Greece, the land' of liberty, with its orators, scientific men, and statesmen. But it fsded away, 'a? the Christian religion was not tatight 'there. So with Some. For years its lotions went forth 'only to c?nq«?erj but Koine's dwdf ill might have then been prophe sied. When she had filled up the measure of. her guilt she sink. 'History taught there was. no palladium of safeguard but the Word of the living ^€rod. 'And the Queen, when asked by the savage embassy what wlas the secret -o* England's greatness, did not point, to hi«'r army and navy, but to the Bib'fc. Ife who bad' to mould this yoang nation wt re in a res ponsible position. Should we, with our aitri fertfus deposit?, bni'd cas^n^s and theatres; or ^houll we bui'd chapels ahd churches ? We lived in a state of refined and spQ^ious infi delity. The woxl 1 was too refined for infidelity ; in its grossest form, it did not hold that the light of nature was sufficient, wifojut that of revelation, or other 'theories. But ifc wav tempted by Ge matnTationalism, as manifestted* in the M Essays and Peviews,' and ' Dr. f Colenso's books. . Tlfe.

They had good singing, an ? escellent tea. &kI; & vapi'al -pee-jh from Mr. Gordon. ®a hoped this woulfl be followed by 1 a good collation. Brevity was the soul of? wit, and he wt? not going to be long winde l. ?
