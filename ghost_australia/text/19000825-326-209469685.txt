CARE AND WORRY. You have heard of care and worry— dark visitors, they say, Who sou ik abouc latitiiliar as Hamlet s ghost at p«ay. They coine and carry with, you, unbidden I and unasked, And flaunt their gaunt arms o'er you — add weight to every task. They watch the rays of sunshine, and guard your open door, Lest light and. hope may enter' and sing the songs of yore. Close friends are care and worry, they laugh and dance with glee, And pile the faggots Jbigaer at each white lock they see. They glory in the shadows their black rones fling about, And while the cloud is o'er you they laugh and dance and shout, They ever walk before you, for should they fail behind, Their forms would vanish from you .like mist before the wind. But over on the other side wait love and hope and joy, Mother ana wife and sister, and little Bob, your boy. The robin sings in the willow and the skyiark chants his Jay, And flowers blossom about you from the morn till close of day. Fling back at care and worry their black robes of despair, , And know as the years pass swiftly God's hand hath rested there. Smooth, out the great deep furrows out- wide on brow and. cheek, For trouble lies in the vauey— you are naaring the mountain peak.
