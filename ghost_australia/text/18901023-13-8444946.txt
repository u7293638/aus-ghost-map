PALACE HOTEL FIRES. TO THE EDITOR OF THE ARGUS. Sir,-It is hardly conclusive to assert that the incendiary ghost of the Palace Hotel must be an individual who has " a peculiar knowledge of the construction of the building and of the regulations under which the business is conducted " It is possible and not even difficult to quickly " arrange " for a fire to apparently burst out spontaneously one hour, two hours, or three hours afterwards All that is necessary is some knowledge of Johnes, some knowledge of chemicals (though even that is in the case of Home fabrics not necessary), and some knowledge of the laws governing latent and actual combus- tion, The detectives might with advantage turn their educational deficiencies (if such exist, of course) in these directions. They have noticed all the articles in which the fires appear to have originated, but have they really examined the nature of the fabrics, and whether they are all of a certain class' Further, has anything been found soaked with any chemical solutions that the toilers in the liberator) wot of The incendiary must be a bungler at his business, thank Heaven, or some architects in this city would have their hands as full as others have now in Sydney. -I am, eVc,, ANTI-FIREWORKS.
