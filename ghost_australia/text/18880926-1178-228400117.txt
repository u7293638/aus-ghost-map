THE TOWN HALL DIALECTIC ASSOCIATION. A mobt enjoyable time was passed last evening, when the Town Hail Dialectic Association tendered to his Worship the Mavor a return entertainment. The vestibule of the- building waB very taste fully decorated for the occasion, and a stage and proscenium had been erected at one end of the chamber, from which a particularly enjoyable programme of vocal and instrumental music, and recitations were delivered bv members of the Associa tion. Upon the conclusion of the musical programme, scenes 2, 4, and 5 of "Hamlet" were presented by the following cast :â€” Hamlet, R. W. Richards; Ghost, G. M'Rae ; Horatio, W. G. Layton ; Mar- cellus, J. R. Palmer; and Bernardo, E. B, Payton. The characters were moBt credit ably sustained, and indicated the presence of much ability, requiring only careful and ' capable tnition, such as that received at the hands of Mr. B. N. Jones, to bring it ont. Refreshments were then served in one of the roomB above, and a short programme of danoes brought a highly pleasurable gathering to an all too early termination.
