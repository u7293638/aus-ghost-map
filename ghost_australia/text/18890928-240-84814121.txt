An American church wants a pastor, and thus describes him:-" We want a pastor to look after the new converts and carry forward the work.

The virulence with which some peo. pie attack the habit of tobacco smoking, as detrimental, not only to health, but morals, finds expression every now and then, on the platform and, in -the. press. Naturally, some people who havt loved the weed, and have hitherto looked upon their pipe as a true friend and comforter, become disturbed and disquieted. Many, doubtless, like Charles Lamb, abandon their trsetycompnanion, and patheti callf liid'it; nas he did,a .long fore'ell: But for those who doubt, yet go on sinning, it may be a comfort to learn that tobacco smoking is of eminent value as a preventive to the develop meat of microbes in tile human system. We owe it to Dr Tassnari, of the Pisa Hygienic Institute, that this moment tons fact has been discovered. His experiments with tobacco smoke on the pathogenic organisms have demonstrated that a marked delay in the development of the "colonies," and, in tlhe case of some microbes, the entire prevention of their develop. ment, 'were .tho' chemical, effects of tobacco smoke. After this the smoaker may defend his habit and himself for fanatical attacks; for if the smoking of tobacco tends to the prevention of the formation of "colo i- ies" in theohuman system,KingJames and his Couiiterhblaist;,and all the bther enemies of tih nirotani weed, may go hang for ,a -better o.argument than has hith'irrto 'lci? at their Â·com mand.- Herall.

Ladies of what our friends the Frnench call "a certain age" will no doubt be glad to hear (says the Paris correspon dent of the London Daily Telegraph) that' at the "Dynamodermie Institute of Paris " the tell-tale wrinkles on their fair featurec can ibe resnoved by electri city. It was Ninmn de Lenclos who said, when observing on herself the effecta:of advancing age, that had she been the creator of womankind she would have consolidated all the wrinkles on the heels of the fair sex; and if the antique 'coquette! were nows alive shte would positively worship the sons of science who haveo discovered a means of utilising " Electrolysis" for the per renial preservation of beauty. Accord ing to Dr5 Vernoy, who writes on the soubjeet-of-,the snew -way -of. becoming 1" beautiful for.ever," the metlhod known *as " Eldiotrblyis't is-brouglht to bear on athe wrinkle whenever they appear on ?the face. The action of the electricity repairs theworst-out epiderntis, nutrifies and revivises it until it rises up into its proper place, and the whcle surface of the skin becomes as smooth as that of a young person full of bloom and beauty. The operation is disagreeable to,thepatpient, ,butnot psainful;,and its ben~eficial effects are 'warranted by'com petent medical authorities. In the meantime, Saintoe.eure's dticltm that smiles produce wrinkles ought to be a caution to the fair, who should endeavor to cultivate immobility of countenance as much as ) ossible, so that they may not have to seek tile aid of electricity too soos.
