LORD CHARLES BERESFORD (Possit,.) The crowd acclaimed " Charlie " in the familiar vi say that crowds have in London Lord Charles in his ride had to go bareheaded in the hot sun from the beginning to the end of the " Record " procession No hard ship that, however, to a man who hndmnrched through the desert to Gak-dnl, been knocked over in the rush of F/ry Wuzzy into the big square at Abu Klea, fought at Mctemncb like an nouent Trojan or a jin-tie-nttle Irishman, engaged an Arab battery for a whole day with a steamer at anchor with a round shot through her boiler, put the fear of Allah and the Giaour generally into tho whole of the Mahdist forces in the very hour of their victory, actually in the delirious moment of fulfilled prediction, and all in the broad glare of a sum in comparison with what li the sun shining on at Paul's on the 22nd day of June, 1867, was like a painted fire Lord " Charlie" is sure to have found his hatless condition under the shade of popular applause very much better But this is not the reason why I have brought this hero up out of the vasty deep which is the fishing ground for the journalist That would have been without any relevancy The fact is that Lord Charles Beresford has just said the best thing during the discussion on the main facts of Imperial and colonial defence He has moreover, done it just in his particular way, without effort, with much vigour, and at the very best moment that the scientific people and the novelists call the " psychological moment " He has always been true to that moment For example, once upon a time he was weary with a long day after wild-goose For 12 hours he had tramped and shot, and there he was on the clerk of his ship, H M S Galatea, Duke of Edinburgh captain, wet, hungry, thoroughly done up, eagerly inhaling the pleasant team of dinner, one eye on " bitters," the other on the brilliant light shooting up through the hatchway one of the very best pass theologic to moments, Surely And so it was, but not that way " Man ov onboard '" The w alor was black and icy-it was at the Falkland Islands, and the depth of winter at that and there was ice in it ing all about, making ugly music against the big ship's burnished sides Lord Charles, a great swimmer, a subscriber to " noblesse oblige," the noblesse in this case of swimming perfection, accepted the psychological moment Without stopping to take off coat (side pockets bulging with cartridges) or boots, he just seized a coil of rope with one hand and went on onboard from the gangway by which he had just entered the sentry had gone over from there, rifle, greatcoat, and all, and the only chance was to grip him before he reached the surface So over went Lord " Charlie," and down he went down, down, down until he began to think, as he described it, that the other end of the rope wasn't fastened to anything But he kept fast hold, as all true sailors do-your sailor never lets go anything when in trouble-and presently overtook his man, grabbed him with the other hand, and in due course arrived in his company at the surface among the ice " The ship's corporal helped us out," say she is telling the story, "and there an end " The story is typical It tells of a dear one for duty of the highest standard, of the courage to do it in spite of difficulties most repellent, of the modest) which makes light of great things done There was not much difficulty about the psychological moment of the other day. It was simply the moment for saying the right thing about the colonies when every body not colonial seemed inclined to say wrong things " You attend to the bases," said Lord Charles, addressing the colonies generally, "and you will do your duty well We will manage the shipping part of the business, and that is our duty " As a naval officer and ex-Lord of the Admiralty, and a man of vigorous common sense, he could have said nothing better The colonies agree with them as their defence works show, and they will not forget him But he always spoke his mind where ever he was and whoever he might be with Irrepressible he was always , it was his chief characteristic, from the first In Honolulu ho beguiled the time by hauling down the American flag flying over the Consul's house in Holyhead he brought down half the signs in the street, in Portsmouth no had several rounds with a " cabby , " wherever he was he will always in some scrape In his middle-age it is the same as in his hot youth He cares for no propnotios-ho is bound by no conv nationalities Of the Navy and its state, and its ships, and its men he speaks the best that is in him Whether what he says but the hearts of my Lords of the Admiralty, It is all one to him, he says it In his young days my Lords ordered his commanding officers to send in monthly reports of the troublesome officer's doings in his middle age they shiver at his frankness, they delay his promotion, they deprive him of his proper periods of service But he is the most popular officer in the service There is no one who can fight like him, no one with such splendid daring, no one who lives he systematically up to the oil trade tions Neither is there any other who can show such a record of Parliamentary work, undertaken not for ainbition'B sake, but for the sake of ot the sort ice He knew the w at s of the owls in the crow's nest, and he went into Parliament because it stands over that eminence That he gave a good account of himself there no one, except my Lords, who are ready to faint when they see uncompromising vigour for a mo mont doubts By-the-way talking of hisirrcpressibilitr, few, I dare say, remember a striking example of it in Sydney during the stay of the Galatea The big Dock on Cockatoo Island, which had not long been finished, was remarkable for strange noises at night, for which no one could account What more natural or more true to historic precedent than a general idea that the place was haunted? History repents itself con annually Everything unknown is given a spiritual source The popular imagination accordingly evolved grim nightly processions of departed prisoners and tyrannous officials, ghostly orgies the dance of death, and great was the superstitious terror Lord Charles Beresford undertook to lay the ghost w little or it might be, and succeeded, though by an amusing fluke He spent a night in the dock with the old boatswain of the Galatea, and they spent it in running up and down trying to locate the usual noises, which went merrily) on quite regardless of their presence Die irrepressible gave it up at last, but even then her could not be repressed An he was leaving the dock he emphasised his disappointment as young fellows will do by lashing out Biilicnly at a dirty old plank lying across a rugged ledge of rock and not improb- bly said a naughty, and or so Over went the plank, and out carne two big frogs out of a hole and let the ghost was found Lord Charles was on this occasion the irrepressible realise that On all other occasions he has enacted the role with his full and well planned concurrence Tor insla nee, driving through Alexandria on the day of the epoch making nioAsncro with a friend he found the mob closing up around killing right and left and detected sympathy with the mob in the rates and dilatoriness of the scoundrel cabby to make one spring on to the box, take the reins and drive ahead at full gallop was to Charlie Beresford the most natural thing in the world. On their side the mob found it the most natural thing in the world to fall back on either band and let the mad thing pass How close is that it was, subsequently was seen when settuty three bodies of J uropMiiH beaten to death were taken out of that same street. The Condor episode that followed is not yet forgotten ' Well done Condor," the Admiral signalled, and the whole fleet applauded the little vessel which handled with the greatest skill and daring, had dodged the great Shot for hours, and pounded its big men handsomely to boot The reason why Beresford particularly enjoyed the feat was that it was against orders He had not been ordered to attack 15 guns with three, the three small and the rest divided into two 8 ton, two 12-ton, two him , two tin , two 12-pounders and two mortars But he attacked, and he m managed to silence the fort It was better than fluttering about to render assistance and carry messages " After that he was energetic in the restoring of order, but failed to get to the front for Total Solar, though he tried hard It was the only suppression of his career In 1881 he saw war on land in earnest getting his first whiff of Arab smoke at Abuklea -He was with Stewart s column as it marched out of camp in square and came in presence of the enemy Halting it 100 j order to straighten up the formation they saw the enemy spring to their feet under their long lines of waving banners Drawn up they were in a dense phalanx, with three cases projecting in front, each headed by an Emir with a banner They came on with a sw if a, quick stop-with the steadiness of regular troops on parade The Mounted Infantry and the Guards faced them 0" the left ASSET, road corner were the "Heavies," iT. infantry, on the rear the Naval Brurta, Law Lord Charles Beresford, with the SAIS? tuent making up the left flank, the carnell,.,! baggage in the centre of" "» On came the Arabs, swift and capture " panthers, stead) as veteran soldiers in Z, S the deadly roll of musketry poured ,"?! thick masses by the Mounted Infant,, »] the Guards The dead and wotmdTfalW gate the advancing column the appeared.?; labouring ship with great masses of broken-in falling away from her bows and side by pities them from my heart," wrote (D, J Wilson, in his chronicle of the battle I ki testified to their Bubhmo gallantry of """ thought any troops could live for 400 wish through such a fire," he added When the column got within 80 yard, it is a denly moved off to its right with the precision and steadiness of a parade manoeuvre, and befall anyone knew what was, happening at yes suddenly to its right, struck the Homes and the Rates and its leaders were among the rains!, u tho centre of the square The Andu swept over the leaves in a whirl and over the Natal. on their right at the Moe no mont Buinab) had fallen in front of his feet cartridges were jamming in the Martini! mill directions Wilson saw the men throwing their rifles from them with curses as the Anti rushed on them and there was terrible confusion The " Gardner " jammed at this moment in the hands of the Navals The captain of that give and Lord Charles were busy trying to free the, cartridge when the enemy burst upon them It, captain of the gun was killed, Lord Charles "" knocked down, and every other officer in the brigade lost his life IhoArabslosltimcamougtho camels The rear ranks of the Guards and Mounted Infantry, was advantage of the delay, faced about and poured in a withering fire, killing camels, officers, Arabs every thing within range The Heanes uri sailors did the same, and the square was recORd not one Arab escaping out of the square they his so gamely broken Lord Charles did great work that day His next exploit was the most bullish of the war. He was lying ill in his hut after the fight iitMolomneh, when word was brought to him that Wilson, who had taken two steamers up to Khartoum on that famous expedition of his, was shipwrecked and out off In moment he was out of bed, on board the oth available steamer-a thing ' rotten withageanl caulked with rags "-and going full speed toth rescue On the war he engaged g big fort mounting two heavy guns, and during befell his boiler was disabled All day he fought, lad while he fought he drew thehresandgotiesdyfer repairing the damage The necessary boiler-plate he owed to his own forethought In ten hours the boiler was mended, and during the 15 hours Beresford's men had kept down the in of the Arabartillcij The enemy might have lank him if they had thought of the simple expedient of taking a gun out of their fort and opening fire at a point furthermore, but they did not think of it in the morning the little vessel puffed out in triumph and saved Wilson and his party So great was the moral effected this fighting the enemy refrained from molesting the retreat of the expedition to North But why go on with the story of a brave man, whose story is in many respects the story of the navy of his umeP That he will one day be at the bar of his profession no one doubts That he may be the greatest admiral of our time most men Iii assured who know the skill that he pottetMi who understand his daring character and his fearless independence, and realise his capacity for taking pains, as witness the incident of tubing plates of the Safieh May he one day command in the waters of those countries whose petition he understands be well
