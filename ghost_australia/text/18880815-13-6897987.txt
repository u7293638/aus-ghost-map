THE GERMAN PICTURE GALLERY. RELIGIOUS S-B.-.CT3 " Montur in Deo," by Professor Piglliotn, Is an entirely original treatment of the Cruet Hixson The Angel of Mercy, with outspread wings, leans over the head of the cross to bestow a kiss of valediction upon the agonised face of the IWeetner, at the moment he is yielding up the ghost A shaft of celestial radiance falls upon the emaciated body, which is almost corpse like in colour, and makes a pathway heavenward for the en- franchised spirit, while it breaks through the clouds which surround the two figures and conceal the solemn incident from the gaze of those who may be lingering near the Mount of Calvary. It is a powerfully- painted work C. von IMolj s impressive picture, "Beneath the Arena," allows us the lifeless form of a beautiful girl, the pallor of whose face is heightened by the crimson drapery upon which the martyr s corpse has been laid. A broken cross has fallen from her nerveless hands, the wrists of which are still bound by cords, There is a look of anguish in the face, which has not yet been replaced by the serenity of death and a young priest who has lingered behind his companions, all of whom are ascending the cavernous passage to the upper air. looks down upon the corpse with a sentiment which may be compassion or may be the pathetic revival of an early election The olde of his robe and sculpture que in their lines, and the draperies of the martyr are not less skilfully painted than her lace and arms, upon which fills the principal light of the composition, which betrays the hand of a master M. Gronwolds "Christ in Solitary Re- tirement;" represents the Saviour as having risen up "a great while before, day" and as having gone out into a solitary place to pray. He is depicted as walking with clasped hands, closed eyes, and bare feet, in the direction of the East, with the full moon rapidly declining towards the west; but neither in this work, nor In the "Nell me Dangers " of A. Stichart, nor in the half-length figure of Christ by Professor F. Keller, nor in the " Virgin and Child " of J. Grim, is there anything to differentiate thaw specially from the hundreds of similar pictures annually painted in Roman Catholic countries There is some good technical work in IL von ITaber mann's full length picture of St Catharine, who is represented in connection with the traditionary sword and wheel, the latter a memorial of the engine upon which she was to have been torn to pieces by command of the Emperor Maxentius, it an angel had not > ruir-iculousl) interposed The name of the Catharine wheel still survives in connection with the pyrotechnic art OTHER FIGURE PIECE-! Professor T. Grosse relates on canvas the story of the "Judgment of Midas," who, having been called upon to decide which was (he beat muMtciaii, Sun or Apollo, reported in favour of the former, whereupon the offended god caused a pair of ass's ears to sprout from the head of the Pbrjgean King The figure of Midas is thrown into the background of the composition, while he is extending the laurel wreath to the guardian of the flocks and herds At his feet are clustered some swarthy shepherds and a fair skinned fawn and the composition is balanced, on the other side, by Apollo, who is stalking away indignantly with his lyre, and be three of the Muses, whose faces are expressive of astonishment at the foolish king a unjust decree, some of the more prominent of the figures show fine modelling His Son's Farewell," by Professor Carl Holt, is a good example of an artist whose work is not unknown in Melbourne. A fond mother, in a robe of black velvet trimmed with Babies, and whose coat and ruff denote that the person of the incident is the 16th century), IS taking leave of what in probably his only son, who is called away to the wars Just as he is entering into manhood. She says her head upon his breast, and clings to him as if she feared that it Bullit prove to be their last embrace His over a lace reflects his mother's emotion, and her left hand seeks the the hilt of his sword, in order that its touch may remind him of his military duties , 1 vi of his comrades stood bareheaded in respectful s)mptithyata little distance, and ? the old moated mansion, the autumnal leaves which strew the ground, the expressive countenances of mother and son, the draperies, and the brick wall, which is so near the young soldier as to leave no room for his almost horizontal sword, are all and limbs) rendered I. Berger's " Dream of the Fountain of Jouvence "is a large decorative composition in three panels, somewhat after the manner of Boucher In the first compartment of the triptych three old cronies, with westerly surroundings, are musing on the possibilities of rejuvenescence In the central division is the fountain itself, in which are iDmphs and amongst, gifted with eternal youth Some of them are bringing one of the aged women to her in the third compartment she is restored to youth and beauty, and is crowning a devoted lover with a wreath of roses, the other figures introduced surrender themselves to music, courtship, and dancing in the midst of summer flowers, much as they do in the precursor Watteau 'the fountain of Jou- vence " has a real existence in the French town of that name, but unfortunately it possesses no such miraculous qualities as those ascribed to it in the picture * Professor A von Werner's portrait of Prince Bismarck shows the head of his subject in profile, with the light falling on its ' bald crown, 1 he strongly marked um! deeply lined face, with ns bushy eyebrows, heavy moustache, and powerful chin, and the grimly earnest expression which it wears, serve to give us an excellent idea of the man of blood and iron, as he is telling the German Reichstag that the whole of Bulgaria is not worth the sacrifice of a single Pomeranian grenadier. The head, hand, and ruff of Charlotte von Gavel's Learned Man" are strongly painted, after the manner of the old Dutch masters, but the arm supporting the head seems to rest upon nothing, and the picture con ve) s a sense of unequal quality and incomplete ness li. Konig's illustration of the scene in which Desdemona declares before the Senate that she is prepared to)*iicrifice filial duty to conjugal affection is appropriately dramatic in character Old Brahantio is exclaiming "God be with' you, I have done, while Othello looks down upon the beautiful Venetian with pride and grateful affection and the Bogan bends forward to catch the words of the speaker, and the figures of Emilia, Iago, and the Senators strengthen both the interest Dud the cohesion of the composition.

Ltchke, jun , son of a well known marine painter, and is a bit of genuine English nature, representing a brawling brook flowing into a placid stream, with a tract of sylvan country behind leading up a range background, with the mists drifting along the hillside, these and the clouds into which they merge being painted with great dexterity of touch "The OrtleR Group, by H Schmidt, is the faithful presentation of a 'Ijroleso land scape A hike occupies the foreground, and the shaggy slopes which rise from its western shore are immersed in shadow , the opposite bank faintly illuminated by the after glow, which also sheds a slowly fading radiance on the grand mountain range that Bereiches across the blue green sk) II P 1 Forster's "Mill pond" shows a stream flecked with waterlilies, and fringed by kings and rushes slipping away from a picturesque old water-mill, embowered in trees, with flat pastures sloping upward to a green and sunny eminence The other landscapes which claim a passing mention are the terraced garden, country mansion, and park, painted by II Public , O bclionleber'a "Spring-time ,' C Muir "Evening in the Vicinity of Naples, where the warm tone of the sunny foreground does not seem to accord with the other portions of the landscape, O von Knmccke'a ' Church near Nobiallo, in Italy," a romantic scene faithfully and effectively rendered, A Zelia "A few of San Remo," a picture of unequal merit the best passages in which are the lofty cypresses and those portions of the landscape which occupy the right hand half of the canvas, and the Hessian Landscape" of V, Ruths, in which, on the other hand, the right section of the Work is its weakest part Allowing for difference of climate and geological structure, the fjords of Norway bear a striking. resemblance to the sounds of New Zealand.
