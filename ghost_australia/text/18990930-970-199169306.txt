Ghosts in the Kitchen. " There are ehosts in the kitchen, sir,'' was the extraordinary announcement made by a cook last night to her master, just as he was sitting down to dinner. The woman, pale with fright, nearly dropped the soup which she was bringing to the table. Her master, a tradesman in the Rue du Bac, wondering what was the matter, walked with his cowering cook to the kitchen, and there saw to his astonishment that the chairs and tables were violently oscillating, the cupboards were also shaking, until it seemed as if the spirits had really taken possession of the kitchen in order to hold a. seance there. The tradesman then returned to the dining-room amazed, and hardly had he resumed his seat when the chairs, tables, sideboard, and in fact all th« furniture began to vibrate around him. He s immediately surmised that the whole house was coming down, so he rushed out to consult one of hh neighbors, who is an architect. The latter returned with him to the dwelling, and found that it was gradually coming down. The police were then communicated with, and ths tottering: habitationWHS cleared of all its inmates. This morning props were put up to support the house, which is one of the oldest in thn district.—Daily Telegraph's Paris cor respondent.
