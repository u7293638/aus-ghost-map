JOKES ABOUT QUEENSLAND HEAT. ' Anglo-Australian,' in theSttropean Mail of July 4th Fays : — Cooktown, in North Queensland, is known as one of the hottest places on the Australian continent, and thero is a regulation story bearing on its extreme sultriness which is told to everyoro who visits those parts. There was a very bad man who once lived in Cooktown — an advertisement canvasser — who, when he was not advertisement cauvassing was basking in the sun, and he was such an abnormally wicked man with all, that there was never nny doubt in the Cooktown people's minds as to where ho would go whon he died. Die he did eventually, as tho story goes, and the town felt relieved. A few nights after his death, however, a losal storekeeper was going tho rounds of his store to tnako tilings secure for the night, when he came across tho fellow's ghost, busily engaged in packing up Idankets ! He had come back for snmn warm covering. This characteristic (for n Queens land ynrn) is now capped up by the story of a party of North Queens landers who camo over recently on a visit to England. They felt tho cold badly as soon as they landed, nnd one of the party soon developed pneumonia, and died off quickly. Ho left orders that he was to bs cremated, so his friends had him taken to Working nnd sent to tho oven in due form. The next day there was to be another cremation, and whon tho attendants opened the door of tho crematory they were surprised to hear a. voice from within shouting : ' Will you fellows shut that door ? I was just beginning to feel nice and warm for the first time since I camo to this beastly country 1' Mr. J. H. Young sayB it is impos sible to fix a current wage for the wholo colony in Government contracts, and that the rate ruling at the'nearest toirn must be the guide.
