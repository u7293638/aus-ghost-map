THE WONDERLAND OF THE MONTH. XIII. FROM ATHERTON TO MARBEBA. By MAUDE WHEELER. In the mute sunlit afternoon, Leaves trembled to some undertune Of music in the silver air; Great pleasure was it to be there, Tin *reen turned duskier, and the awoa Coloured the •^nwhcaves Hke sold hair. *JW-fBUKMK. From Athortoa to Mareeha on tha hex aaat of a ooooh la th* dreariest drive _nagtaab)e. The road la over a doll, monotonoua plain, and the red dust lte* heavily upon the homes aad passeagen. Jaat three or four m'les past Athertoo there I* a tiny settlement called Martin Town. Martin Town consists principally of a •aw- raill and a hotel : th* only apparent Industry is cutting down the magnificent cedars ln the big scrub *nd •ending them on to Mareeb* by a traction engine. As the read has s slight Incl'ne all the way to Mareeb* this Is comparatively easy, and the traction engine managas to keep ahead of th* coach all the way. The road through the big scrub Is bordered by tall, stately trees, maoy of them covered with grand staghorn and bird's n**t tern*, but thi* I* coon left behind, aad than we go across th* doll, flat plain, whara ootldag re- Iteva* th* weird loneline**. As far as the eye coo reach, nothing tut mile* of plain, covered with gum-tree* ; not a hill, not a rlas lo th* distance ; alwaya the same plains and tree*. I find It far worse travailing than any of my back-block experience*, *v*n upon Mount Mla*ry and the Featherbed Range. There, If the road* were bad, th* ■ceaary wa* good, and It* much pl*as*nter to trawl ln a buokboard buggy than on the box-***t of a coach. A frlvolou* aad Irrele vant drunk accompanied oa part of the way. Thar* waa ao room for him, 10 be sat on the roof of the coach, with hi* leg* dangling over the sld*. H« favoured us with his view* upon th* Boer war, federation, the New Womaa, and every subject he could bhiak of. At test he wa* left at a w*y*lde pab, to th* great delight of our driver. Jack, who was undsr tha lmpreootca that the Inebriated one would Inevitably fall off th* top of th* coach, and we would all be tried for siding aad abettiag hi* untimely d*c—e. That special Providence which la aaid to ear* for druoka, children, aad fool* doubtless protected th* amiable luaatle until he wa* -safeiv lauded. It's a horrible thing to think of a drunk sitting on oa* of tho** high conchas behind five hone*, tb* coach get* a grrot swsy oo It going up or down a hill, and It looks quite uople***ntly dangerous. Aad so we go on ; the only break 1* stopping at oome dreary wayside hotel, when all the mea DIAMOND MINING IN SOUTH AFRICA. gat down to hay* th* usual drink. I *ok for water, aad get tome tepid, murky fluid that's nearly a* good ** *a emetic. We p**« a girl drlvlag a smart pair ot hones vary neatly, aad our old driver give* her a word of pralie for her handling of them. She Is going to a bush fun*r*l, a bollock driver has died at Martin Towu, and all the couatry folk arouod or* golag to that sad dest of all sight*—a bash fuaeral. At Atherton there w*s bo regular cemetery. Uader the -singing tree* slept the tew dead, who had all dted in their youth. Oa* man. while trying to save a child who tell into a creek, another maa from th* k!ek of * mule, and the wife of the last man had died la child bed. They steep w«U, aad over them the trees mak* their everlasting moan. It la one of the most melancholy places I hay* scon. Here, in thi* aew country, nobody thinks of death, thoagh they face It la many form*. Tat they usually seem Invlneibl*, and the marvellous dryaes* and parity of the air helps them to live to a ripe ag*. So at the next waysld* pab everybody gsts down aad drinks to drown thlm and sad thoughts, sod we go on psat the twfrtei gum-tr*** that flit by likea prooepslon of ghost*., Even Into tha big ccrub the o*W woman ha* peaetrated, aad *h* was a tiny, thin creature, who rode a bicycle all rbuad the country. Needless to say, she wa* a Mel bourne woman ; who els* would have the audacity, ■' the cool effroatcry, -to ride a •'bike" beneeth th* frowning stare of th* stately giant* of the forest ? Clad in a abort, smart skirt of ton- oloured e'otb, h*r l*g* encased tn gaiter*, upon her bead the sailor hat of clvllteatton, *h« seemed a glaring lacoagrulty la that land of big dis tances and great deslr**. Tb* kindly meh of the country regarded her a* an anomaly, though they wouldn't hay* said It that wsy ; that any living creetur* shoi'ld prafor a bicycle to a bora* seemed rtrange to the rough, kindly sous of th* big forest So th* uew woman wa* tolerated—no more. A* we pursue our dreary road, wo overtake • cyclist, • man. Something ha* gene wrong with hi* maealo*. sad we think h* will want a lift; but no, he would not give ln. 80 we go on, white he follow* b*oto<l la a wc*-b*gnn* fashion. We pace a wit team of mul«*. driven by John Chlnsmsa, who aotly fulfils the old Scriptural injunc tion by being all things to all ir*a. Hera he Is a packer, and he rides stolidly along side his team of sturdy animal*, each with a bell of greater or less discordance dangling from Its o*ok. Then we poo* a team of patlrat bollocks, and th* next ohjwt 1* a •mall hotel, called th* Four-mile. Four mile* from Mareeba, where there an train* and telegraph*, aad all th* things we hay* grown to think necessary la our complex lite. The foor mile* pass quickly, and we drive Into the lonely little town. The air la strongly sc*nt*d with cedar-wood. It la a qualat Oriental odoar, that make* yoa thlak ot Chlaam*a aad th* mingled odaars of opium aad incense that emanate from their hovel*. Far away In Atherton they hay* la their colony * Josshouse, gorgeoa? with scarlet aad purple, and with many devices of straagely carved and gi.ded woods. Beneath the Idols laceaa* is per ktetually boralog, aad la a vessel of oil a light is kept night aad day. A straage barbaric drum, carved and lettered, hangs upoo th* wall, and so beneath an alien sky, and in a foreign land, th* Chin*** keep the faith of their forefathers. The contrast between th* hombl* shed, rooted with modern corrugated Iron, tho floor mad* of be*t*o ant-h**p*, and th* sliver serving ves**l* of th* god la striking. (Photon, by owano, Klmberloy.
