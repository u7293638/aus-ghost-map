A vast an horribiy iniquitous organizatio in iKo city' of London for eritrkjjping, by means of derillish subtilt^-, young and unsuspecting females,.and supplying houses of accommodation—or, in plain English, brothelsj-with their unhappy inmates. A woman " by merit raised to that bad tainence" of being the acknowledge^ leader, a,nd ^uost successful caterer tc the vices of the upper ten thpusand.fs singled out by the guardians of public morality arid prosecuted according fo law. . Qf her guilt,'there is i not a ghost of fa shadow of a doubti but her patrons have "been Pi incfeS of the Blood Cabinet Ministers—judges—and men of /'gentle ": birth. The " upright judge—"pure as his ermine " (as councillor Phillips said of the legal,gentleman who tried the .murderer jaf Lord Russell)—is shocked at tho reflations that will be made in the hearing of the vulgar who throng the court, to say nothing of those abominable reporters . who are there, pen in hand, ind .professionally, alive to the spicy mature of their contributions to the journals of the day. There will be sbindalvm magnatum, and, if the judgt himself has been one of Mrs Jefferie3 patrons • it seems too evident that sotiie ot his brothel's, learned in the laiw, know rainre of that lady and her soeial arrangements than honest gentlemen should know. So, forgeting that truth and justice should be the fiist and last' aim of his- existence ; forgeting that he. sits there armed by the law of the' land . with .irresistible powers to interpose - .between the wronger and the wronged, to punish the guilty and vindicate the ,innocent; this servile creature stops the trial, calls the counsel for prosecution and defence into his 'private room, and suggests that the matter shall be hushed up, and the monster ,<in. female form, on whose polluted:soui rests the blood of scores of her sisters, whom'she has doomed to elow. tortuiin? destruction in this life, is set at liberty! The judge suggeststhat she shall pie id guilty, and [ lay & £ne, 'abd Mi's Jefieries returns l'iibe tiiumphant. We punishment.AanJbe too severe for such an atrocious, mockery of justice, and pve trust that the all rpowerful Pjess of Grpat %U a !O.W»li.80emphatically vent the ' opihiori'of hia • countrymen, that the unjuat jud«e ,wil) learn to his cost that.^e^'fi superior even ti law,' and that is the judgment of he good and'true.-
