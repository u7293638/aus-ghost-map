i TL&B3J; UP FOE J.P'S. (bx mac ) They must have been hard up for J.P's. when they made old 'Jim Peters ' one. Jim's education had been shamefully neglected by bis parents, and it was with, the greatest difficulty that he coma reaa ana write wneu ne oegan to fight with, the world. However, as is very often the case with men deficient in learning but shrewd in business matters, Jim made' money in spite of all drawbacks, and was soon able to purchase a property of his own in the back country, where he naturally became a prominent re sident ow mg to the scantiness oE the population, and the height of his ambition was attained when he was gazetted a 'Justice of the Peace.' It goea without saying that the duties attached to this important judicial position requires not only gravity of demeanor, but a little knowledge of the. duties of the office. But on the latter score Jim was as innocent as the babe unborn. All he knew was that he had to dispense justice in some form or another; A friend of Jim's with a turn for practical joking, advised him to send, to Sydney to some Law-bookseller's for copies of the various works on isLyr and justice, so that by carefully study ing these works, he would acquire all the necessary information, commen surate with bis position as a magis trate. Accordingly we 'find a carte ilanche order dispatched to an. extensive book selling firm in the city, and we can. imagine the suspensp in which our new J.P. existed during the interval: During this period of anxiety, and no doubt while strolling along in his new-born dignity, old Jim met the police force of the district, the solitary constable, aud sternly interrogating him as to the state of crime in the district, discovered that, at the mo ment, there was total absence of crime ot d/'un/cenness in Vie locality. Upon, separating, Jim being pleased, intimated to the 'guardian of the law's,' that all cases hereafter — where practicable — were to be brought up to his house, and he would ' Sit on. 'em.' Next day the legal works arrived, and old Jim feverish with impatience, overhauled the books and began his studies. As was naturally to be ex pected it was not very long before he was completely fuddled amongst the legal technicalities, -fcc, and by the end of the week — when the constable put in an appearance with a prisoner, or 'case,' — old Jim was virtually von compos mentis, and his clearness of intellect a thing of the past. 'Show them into the Library,'? was the order given to the servant who announced the arrivals, ' And tell the coDstable that I will be with hiin pre sently.' Although dying with impatience to enter the room Jim had enough savee to know that by keeping the constable waiting on bis convenience, be would but be acting on In* dignity So after ten minutes, 01 thereabouts, had elapsed lie entered the ' hall of iustice' or in other words; -'the library,' with a dignified aii, wither j»|[ilM3* unfortunate prisoner 'Mfch \'ty jndicialfrowa, fearful in its intern .winlejusservant followed dose beh him., bearing the legal reference book, and depositing. tho§e yaluaol? works on the desk ja front of his master.
