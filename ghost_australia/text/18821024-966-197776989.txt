THE COMET. A few days ago a correspondent signing himself " Observer" wrote to us as follows:— "Before the comet disappears, it would increase my interest in our illustrious visitor to have the following questions answered, if the elements have been obtained to do so:— " a. What is the weight of the comet ? " b. What is the specific gravity ? "c. What was the maximum velocity at perihelion ? " d. What has been the length of tail ? "e. What angle does the plane of the comet's orbit form with the plane of the Earth's orbit? "/• What distance was the comet from the Earth when passing through the pline of the Earth's orbit before and after perihelion?" We referred his letter to Mr. C. Todd, C.M.G., who has kindly supplied us with the following information :— . "aand b. We possess no data for answering either of these questions. All observations of comets—even the largest—go to show that their mass is infinitesimally small. The satellites of Jupiter exhibited no signs of disturbed orbits when Lexell's Comet twice passed through their midst, although its own orbit on each occasion was altogether altered. Nor was the earth sensibly disturbed when the same comet came within 1,500,000 miles of its surface. The present comet is probably no exception to the rule, and although when first seen its nucleus was large, apparently globular, and solid, or planetary looking, both before and after the perihelion, it has since altered its form, and is now rednced to a thin streak of light set in its surrounding coma, giving one the idea of an emission of the matter forming the nucleus in two streams into the tail, which has grown in length from about 5° to 20°, and is now over - 100,000,000 miles long. "c. The perihelion passage occuned late on the night of September 17, or early in the morning of the 18th, the distance from the sun being less than any previously known comet, or about 453,000 miles, that is, within about 23,000 miles of the sun's surface. It must, therefore, have rushed through the coronal or gaseous matter surrounding the sun with a velocity approaching 1,000,000 miles an hour, or half round the sun in less than two hours. " d. The length of the tail has varied from abont eight or ten millions to over 100,000,000, and to this must be added the faint long extended envelope in front of the head towards the sun, which developed itself in a most remarkable manner between the 3rd and the 7th inst. The first time I noticed the formation of this outer envelope was on the morning of the 3rd, when tne nucleus was reduced to a lon^ bright streak, the coma and tail being very bright, and the latter very sharply defined and bright on its southern edge and cirrous or feathery on the north edge. Surrounding the head, and for some distance to fie rear and along the tail, was a fainter envelope forming a margin of considerable breadth. This during the following forty-eight hours extended to at least 3° from the head, with a pointed termination. " e. The inclination of the orbit to the plane of the ecliptic is about 38°. "/• At its ascending node it must have been between 91,000,000 and 92,000,000 miles from the earth. The longitude of the ascending node is abont 353° 38', the whole of the orbit, excepting where at perihelion it passes^ round the sun nearly grazing its surface, is south of the ecliptic; and as the heliocentric longitude of the earth at the perihelin passage of the comet was about 355', the comet must have passed nearly between us and the sun. " While writing about this comet it may be interesting to compare its orbit, which, bythe-by, is only a first rough approximation kindly supplied by Mr. Jtllery with the celebrated cornets of 16G8, 1843, and 1830. COMET OF 1668. Perihelion passage, February 28'S. Longitude of perihelion, 277". Longitude of ascending node, 357.° Inclination, Perihelion distance, 442,254 miles. Motion, retrograde. 1843. Perihelion passage, February 27 "3. Longitude of perihelion, 278 J . Longitude of node, 358". Inclination, 36". Perihelion distance, 507,000 miles. Motion, retrograde. 18S0. Perihelion passage, January 27 "5. Longitude of perihelion, 277° 25'. Longitude of node, 357° 25'. Inclination, 36° 42'. Perihelion distance, 621,000 miles. Motion, retrograde. 1882. Perihelion pissage, September 17 "2, G.M.T. Lorgitude cf perihelion, 275° 12'. Longitude of node, 353° 3S'. Inclination, 38° 10'. Perihelion distance, 453,6S0 miles. Motion, retrograde. Laugier and Mauvais assigned a period of between thirty- five and thirty-six years to the comet of 1843, but Hubbard made it 530 years, and the comet of 1880 has probably a period of thirty-six or thirty-seven years. It will be seen that these four comets have nearly identical orbits, and that all at their perihelion have rushed into dangerous proximity to the sun—through, in fact, its coronal names. .That they must have suffered violence for their temerity seems certain, and the question arises—Are they one and the same comet, or fragments of the same body? If the present comet is identical with that of 1880, it may, as Mr. Tebbutt suggests, return to us again in a short space, and may perhaps fall into the sun next time. 1 his, however, need cause no apprehension. If the comet of 188J was identical with that of 1843, it had been reduced to a ghost of its size. In its physical aspects the present comet far more resembles 184-j. Has the latter suffered a fate similar to that of Beila, nd been split into two fragments, the comets 1880 and i8S2 being the components? 'Examining the nucleus with a spectroscope fixed on JO the equatorial, I liud it has a. on.ewhat complex spectrum. The three lines come out bright and strong. Each b2nd is a bundle of lines, especially he middle one, the central portion of each eing brightest. ' The following gives (roughly) the observed ositions of the comet since it was first een:— R. A.
