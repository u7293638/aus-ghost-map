V GROAN OP A GUZZLER. By the Ghost of a Good Templar. EE. — The Gutter. With eyes all bleary and red, And beard all slimy with dirt, A loafer sat down in his loaferly rags, With the gutter mud staining his shirt ; Loaf 1 Loaf ! Loaf ! Disgustingly beery all. day, And with a voice of a hiccupping sigh, He drawled his loaferish lay ! Loaf ! Loaf ! Loaf ! And sometimes a bit of a snooze, And Loaf ! Loaf ! Loaf ! And, when I can get it, a booze ! It's Oh, for a threepenny shave To clear off some of the dirt ; To dwell somewhere beyond the wave Where no lobsters are on the alert. Swipe ! Swipe ! Swipe 1 Till my brain feels very queer, And swipe, swipe, swipe, 'Till I know not the front from the rear ; Gin, and whisky, and rum, And rum, and whisky, and gin ; 'Till at last I resemble the gutter slum, Which now I'm sitting in. Oh, men with half-crowns big ! Oh, men with " tanners " bright, You never hear the loafer's sigh, And tip him enough for a pint ; Loaf ! Loaf ! Loaf ! All raggedy, hungry, I goes, Till at last in the boiler, numbered 2, I coils myself up for a doze. Loaf ! Loaf 1 Loaf ! Never more to cease, And what do I get ? A kick — a curse, Or consigned to eternal peace ; That boiler old, cracked up the side, Which I stopped with straw and mud, If I caught the lout as pulled it out, I'd stain it with his blood. With eyes all bleary and red, And beard all slimy with dirt, A loafer sat down in his loaferly rags, While the gutter slush rill'd on his shirt ; Loaf ! Loaf ! Loaf ! Disgustingly beery all day, And with a voice of a hiccupping cry, Which guggled and spluttered with many a sigh, He drawled a loaferly lay.
