He eooduded from hii ex^trimenU | tbat there wae more than 5 }ier cent., but less ! than 10 per cent of aojiiite in the bottle. He I had icade exjienmente with rabhite, and found - that tbe genuine Battley'e sjloticn did not kill | them, while a mixture of gennine EsttSey with a email quantity of Fleming's tincture of aconite jireved fatal. Dr. Maciagan vrss of opinion that in tbe case of JJ rs. Taylur tbe symptoms described by the witness were such as aconite would have ]-ro- iiaced. If sjpwm, acjaite snJ antimony had [ been a-imiuUtercd at the same time, he W'ald have antictfi&tfed; the Eym£iloms wLidi llrs. Taylor ciluuitel. Dr. Littlejohc was of trjiinion, after hearing the evidence, that tbe death of lire. Tayior was occasioned by a combination of antimony and opium ; he 'sUo said th&t; if the ojiium nhich Sire. Taylor took bad upwards of S jiet cent, of Fieining'e tincture of aconite in it, the effect would have been much more rapid, and mnch mnrc likely to 5-e fatal. Mr. ilacbrair, trustee of the late David Cowan, of 1'ortsmontb, ]-roved that Mre. Taylur had control of £3,000 under Mr. Cowan's will, and that Mre. Taylor had v.aAe a. will itjaWng two-thirds of ttat sum to Mrs. Pritchard, and in tbe event of her death to Dr. Pritchard, who was to get the interest till bis children thonld attain the age of ttt'outy-one, himsel£ lu July, 1S64, Jlre. Taylor had \oii £rm to Dr. Pritchard. After some formal evidence, two declarations admitted, by tbe prisoner were then leal. Tn the first, made on the 2nd March, he (aid his wife's last illness was gastric fever, and that he gave her no medicine at all himself, excepting wine, chamiiagne, and brandy to support her strength, in order to procure her sleep. He baid be had given her a small quantity of chloroform, but it entirely disagreed with her, and he discontinued it. He sent for her mother to iiurtc her, and he ascribed his wife's decease to tbe agitation consequent on her Brother's death. He taid be had never given his wife antimony but on one occasion, in October test. He applied it ex ternally to ber when die had a (swelling of a gland is her back. He gave his v.ife a little liotile of antimony for the purpose of rubbing iu behind her ear. Be useJ antimony exten sively in his practice, and kept} it in a cupboard in his consulting room. In his second declara tion, made on the 21st of April, be said that he was in no way accessory to Mr?. Taylor's ucaui) won u^iiKici ™i if'''-' ?--?? |.-uuvu \ij ajcij and that he believed she died from paralysis and apoplexy. This closed the case for the prosecution, and tbe court adjourned at half-past five until next rooming at ten o'clock, when the evidence for tbe defence was commenced. The evidence for the defence lasted only an bonr and a lia!f. There was do attempt; to rebut the medical evidence fur tbe Crown. Two of Dr. Pritctiard's young children were called to rpeak of tbe affectionate terms of their parent, and of the attachment butH'ccn. the prisoner and his mother-in-law. Tbe prisoner was much affected while his children were under examination. The Solidtor-Cieucralthen addressed the jury for .Uie prosecution, and Mr. Chirk addressed the jury fur the prisoner. The court then ad journed. The court met again on the following morn ing, 6th July, at ten o'clock. The public in terest in the trial had greatly increased, and the doors of the court ruom were besieged by hundreds of iitreons eager to obtain admission tu hear the judge's charge to the jury. Tbe jury retired to consider their verdict alrout twenty minutes past one o'clock, and returned in about an hour with a unanimous verdict of guilty on hoth charges. The Lord Justice Clerk then sentenced the prisoner to be executed at Glasgow ou the 26th July, ana in passing sentence saia uui me ver dict of the jury proceeded upon evidence wliich could leave no reasonable doubt on the mind of those by whom it 'was considered. The prisoner, who had maintained great com posure tbnmghout the live days of the trial, seemed greatly affected when the verdict was pronounced, and leant fcUghtly on the policeman sitting beside him ; hut while the sentence was being recorded he completely regained his com posure, and after sentence was passed upon him he bowed to tbe judge, and also to the jury, be fore leaving the dock. The following extracts are from Dr. Pritch ard's diary j— 'J'Hi February, 1865, — Died here at 1 a.m., Alary' Jane, my own beloved wife, aged 38 years ; no torment surrounded her bedside, but like a calm, peaceful lamb of God, passed Minnie away. May G--d and Je£U£, Holy Ghost, one in three, welcome Minnie. Prayer «b prayer, ttU mine be o'er, everlasting love. Save us Lord, for thy dear Son.'
