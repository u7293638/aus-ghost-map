MILITARY ANECDOTES. Some years ago I was quartered, in one of the principal towns in Scotland, a sub. in a Highland regiment, and my captain was, without exception, one of the most charming and accomplished men I ever met, yet, one of the most mischief lous Practical joking was a mania with him, and his ingenuity was exercised to its full bent to carry out thoroughly a joke of any kind. One afternoon he was struggling with a friend through the back streets of the town, when suddenly he turned round and exclaimed "Oh, my word' here's a smart little tobacconist shop. Dummy Royal Stuart, evidently fresh painted, mull and all." " I see something better than that," replied his ft lend, two awfully pretty girls behind the counter." "So there are, by Jove," the captain said, " let's go in and buy some cigars, and have a talk with the girls " No sooner had they entered the shop than a violent till tatton commenced with the girls, and a great deal of fun and badinage went on over the selection of the cigars At last the captain caught hold of the hand of the prettiest girl of the two, and, gaping into hot eyes, was evidently trying to make some appointment in the midst of all the laughter and fun, his friend nudged him and directed his attention to a little glass window at the back of the shop, where, on looking up, he saw the grim face of an old Scotchman, gay with rage at seeing two good-looking fellows in uniform travelling with his pretty daughters, for, Scotchman like, he knew little good could come out of all that, and they were not there to spend money. One of the girls observing him at the window, exclaimed "We shall catch it. There's the governor, looking as mad as a hatter Here, you must go, take your cigars, please, we shall never hear the last of this, and he is in such a fearful temper. Please let go my hand, and be off You have no idea how we shall suffer for this " " Oh, hang him !" exclaimed the captain, still holding her hand, and getting more enamoured every moment with the blue eyed handsome Scotch girl. " What on earth harm can there be in our chatting to you I shall feel inclined to punch his head if he is unkind to you for so little cause " 'Yes, yes, that's all very well, but you don't understand how uncomfortable it will be for us if you stay here talking " Finding the girls did not come in, the old man's passion became beyond control, and hanging open the little glass door he rushed into the shop exclaiming " Go into the house, this moment, you abominable girls ' What do you mean by going on in this manner with these two fellows ' if they don't go out of my shop at once, I will knock them into the gutter, and he rushed forward to put his threat into execution. The captain, white with rage, was in the act of knocking the Scotchman down, when his friend reminded him that he was in uniform , also, that it would only make matters worse He desisted, thinking " prudence the better part of valour," took his friend a arm, and walked away to barracks On the way they had a good laugh over the affair Arriving in his room, the captain seated himself in an easy chair, crossed his legs in a contemplative attitude, and looking gravely at his friend, said " I am going to plot a good practical joke to worry the old baccy man I can't let him off scot free mind, that was not meant for a pun, we will have some rare fun out of this affair yet " " I don't doubt that for a moment, if you take it in hand," laughed his friend; "but I say, old fellow, don't do anything that will cause any worry to the girls, for after all, we were to blame for going in and levelling their time away " "All right, I will only have a talk with the old man." The little affray was soon known all over the town, and many a heart beat with delight at the prospect of a good practical joke being made on the old termagant He was well known for his cruel and spiteful acts He was madly jealous of his two pretty daughters, and they were new 01 allowed outside the door with out him If they were seen speaking to a man, unless in a most cold and business like way in the shop, his age became unbounded He closed the shutters every night at nine o'clock, winter and summer As the clock str neck he would shoot out, his hands in his pockets, and gaze up at the skies, as if trying to see through the misty halo around the moon, in order to discover the weather of the morrow then he would fix up his shutters one by one, and last and most pi scious came the Dummy Scotchman which he lifted into the passage every night, so highly pi Izod was it by the old man, having been in the family for some time as their trade sign About a week had elapsed when the captain held a council with his friend and his servant, and a programme was decided on for the next evening. It was this they were all to be secreted at a quarter to nine in an alley which opened in the sheet, only a few doors from the tobacconist's shop The three met at the rendezvous as arranged, the captain in full dress, the others in mufti He then informed them he intended to carry off the old in ma Dummy Highlander and keep it for a time, to frighten him "How on earth will you manage that, old fellow ' said his friend "Why by unhooking it at the back, and passing it on to you, you will pass it on to my servant, and he will quickly despatch it to my room I shall then occupy the Duma) at md , that's the reason, you see, why aminfulldiess to imitate the figure as near as possible Bush there goes a quarter to nine. The old man will soon be out, now keep close to me, and do just as I wish " Then he crept quietly up, unhooked the Dummy in a most dexterous manner, and passed it to his friend, who passed it to the servant It was soon secreted in barracks, and the captain had scarcely taken the Dummy's vacant place, when out walked the Scotchman for his usual starlight gaze The night was misty and dark, but no wind, luckily, of the feathers in his Highland bonnet would have told a tale After gazing round as usual, the old man proceeded to put up the shutters one by one, and was just in the act of putting his arm round what he supposed was the Dummy, to unhook him, when the captain deliberately stepped into the pathway, and walked with a most ghost like str side down the street, and was soon lost to view The old man stood spellbound, and gazed into the mist after the departing figure, then rushed into the house half wild with flight, and told his daughters that the Dummy had come to life, and was walking away down the street. The two girls could not realise the truth of such a strange affair, so hun led out to see for themselves, and were almost as alarmed as the old man himself when they saw the Dummy was really gone ; and, being, like most Scotch people, superstitious, they thought something dreadful was going to happen. Before an alarm was raised, the captain was safe in his own room, and getting into mufti as quickly as possible he sat down to a quiet pipe Strange to say, nothing was heard at barracks of the affair, not any inquiries of the police, and yet in the town there was a perfect hue and ci t, and the old in his story was of course discredited , yet the Diinimy was clean gone, and the old man would not believe anything but that he had walked away, for he said he saw him the whole time he was closing the shutters, standing perfectly still in his accustomed spot Healing ft 6in Ins ser tant that the old man's grief was great at his loss also that it caused much distress to the daughters, The captain determined, after keeping the Dummy a fortnight to restore him to his old position Watching for a favourable opportunity, he succeeded, with the aid of his servant and a dark misty night, in restoring the Dummy unobserved to his original quarters Great was the joy of the old man, when he came out to close the shutters as usual, to find the Dummy back in his old place but he declared he would never trust him again, so the figure was henceforth tied to the door, as well as hooked to the wall The facts just related were scared) forgotten before our gallant captain was again plotting mischief One night some of the youngsters in the billiard-room were complaining of a stubborn old bikes in the neighbourhood whose 1 rocker and bell pull they defied any one to steal though they had stolen main from the same street because he was always on the alert " When e does the old beggar has asked the captain, Steele bring the conten- ition "In the Sturt behind your friend the tobacconist," laughed a sub "Oh I know (he Shop 'Jhot take in dinners to bake for the British public Many times when marching from church on Sundays my nose has inhaled is to out j smell of pits and joints on then knit in from the bakehouse So this is the man whose knocker there is a difficulty in stealing' It strikes me dear boys, ton do not fly at the right time, during the first sleep is the s ifest, depend upon it What will you bet don't bring the baker's knocker and bell pull into barracks before forty-eight hours are over our heads '" "We should be -very son) Robert anything against your pi or less in that way, they replied "Well," laughed the captain, "if there are no bets, I must do it on my own account I feel a perfect Don Quixote, and love to go about the world making everybody's difficulty in) windmill ' "Yes, you are light, but, unfortunately for man a pool wretch, jour Don Quixote business in all w i long for them Still, this time I fancy it will be a tough job, for I believe the old baker sits up one half the night, looking after his door knocker and both handle, and makes his poor unfortunate wife sit up the other half, so the difficulty will be great " " We shall see," laughed the captain, as he left the room " Time proves all things. Good night " True enough, on the billiard table the following night lay the identical knocker and bell handle Entering the room, amid peals of laughter from his brother officers, he, with a theatrical air, pointed to the table saying " There, you see, gentlemen, are the trophies I promised you "And now, what on earth will you do with them '" asked one of the subs, laughing. "You will see," friended, ringing the bell and ordering the messman to be sent to him. On the man's arrival he held up the knocker and bell handle, and in the gravest tones possible said "I wish you to place these two at tides in a pie dish and fill up the vacant space with sawdust, then make a smart crust over all-in fact, make it look like a very mee rich pie, or) servant shall take it on Sunday morning to be baked You, of course, know the baker to whom I wish it to be sent '' "Oh! yes, sir, I know him," the measure replied, "it shall be attended to as you wish " j and the man left the room in a be of laughter. "Well' said one of his brother officers, " you get tandy are one of the most accomplished scamps I ever saw " The joke was immensely enjoyed by the fellows in the room, heightened, as it was, by the captain's cool and quiet manner, and many a giggle the young subs indulged in during the remainder of the evening at the prospect of the baker's discomfiture The pie was duly delivered at the baker's on Sunday, and baked in its regular order, but, of course, no one called for it. The baker had been dreadfully out of sorts for some days past, in consequence of his loss He suffered move from chagrin than anything else, because he had boasted so much to his more unfortunate neighbours, and also because he had not been able to punish the offenders The fourth day came, and still the nice looking preordained uncalled-for in the bake house, so the wife suggested that they had better have it was used up in the oven and cut it for dinner ' Around the dinner table the family had assembled for their mid-day meal, and the jug was brought in and placed before the baker. Cutting the crust, he dived the spoon in, and, of course, found its contents to be his own knocked and bell handle smothered in sawdust. To the astonishment of his wife, who expected him to swear with anger, he put down the spoon, sat back in his chair, and gave way to roars of laughter, gasping " By Jove I freely forgive the fellow who has managed this practical joke. It's the best I ever saw done in my left ' "It is' it is said the wife joining in the laugh, "and I hope this will be a warning to you not to be so bumptious in future, nor think that it's impossible for you to be taken in as well as other people "V HlMIlTOIf BOWEll ("Sigma"), in Modern Society
