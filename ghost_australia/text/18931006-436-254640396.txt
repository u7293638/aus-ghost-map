STOCKHOLM'S HAUNTED PALACE. The Stockholm correspondent of the Independent Beige tell this ghist story:â€” For a long time it has been no sscret that spirits haunt the royal palace in Stockholm. Years ago the king became so thoroughly convinced of the presence of ghosts that he had the big wing most frequented by them torn down and rebuilt. But the ghosts did not disappear when the alteration was made, and they still carry on their nightly carousals. A month ago the Danish crown prince and bis wife, while visiting the Stockholm court, lived in the haunted palace. On the first night there was an extraordinary manifestation. A chamberlain was lifted from his bed by invisible hands and was laid on a table at tbe end of a bedroom farthest from the bed. On the following morning Prince Johann asked him if he had heard the uproar in his room. On the evening of the same day the Princess Louise was writing in a room brillantly lighted. Suddenly a woman appeared and began extinguishing the lights. The PrincessLouise, who iscelebrated forher courage, tried to lay bands on the woman, but the latter vanished as suddenly as she appeared. Prince Christian, the eldest son of the crown prince, wished late one afternoon to fetch something for a dimly lighted room. He left his father and mother, only to return a few moments later empty handed, white and trembling. He said that he had found the room filled with s.range figures, which barred his way and made threateting gestures. The day before his departure the Danish crown prince was playing cards with the Crown Prince of Sweden, when Prince Gustav, turning white with fear, exclaimed that a giant was behind Prince Johann's chair looking at his cards. Both princes sprang to their feet and the giant disappeared. Nobody in the Swedish royal family doubts the presence of the ghosts, but the subj-ct of their appearance is tabooed at court. >
