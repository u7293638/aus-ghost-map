GHOSTLY. " 'Tis haunted," Bob said As I got into bed, " For, precisely at twelve of the clock ev'ry night, A rowdy old ghost, Who had once been the host, Hops into the bed-chamber bearing a light." " Then he goes to that chair, And that stick, you see there, Is the wooden leg which the old fellow once wore. Well, he sits down upon That chair, and screws on The leg, and then capers about on the floor." [1 arose and burned the leg. Then— ] My friend went away, And sleepless I lay, Gazing out on the floor, when the door opened in, And the rowdy old sprite, With a blue glaring light, Advanced with a hop on one pin, that was thin." He sat down on the chair, And he groped about there, I presume for the leg, which to ashes had gone ; Then he seemed in surprise, For he rubbed both his eyes, While his face, before purple, grew awfully wan. Then he snorted and snored, And he yelled and he roared, " My leg, oh ! my leg, which I did so admire, Come quick to . me, ho !" Then, stately and slow, The ghost of the leg left the ghost of the fire. And stately and grand It moved to his hand, And he screwed it on tightly, as tight as could be, And the ghosts of the man, And the leg both began To dance, and at last they both danced upon me. And they danced, and they danced, And they pranced, and they pranced, And I could not as much as say, " Please go away;" And they tortured me, oh \ It was awful, J know, But at last I awoke, and 'twas two in the day. Mem.—Not to go to anymore Exhibition Balls with Bob, and remain in bed till two next day.
