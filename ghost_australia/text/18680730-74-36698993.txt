RAILWAYS. Is there are any men in the South really desirous of promoting. the pros. perity of the colony let them unite and subscribe to procure a proper survey and estimate of their scheme. This is not asking a. serious proof of sincerity. But if the clamour proceeds from a small knot of selfish schemers, who liope to reap a harvest from a large expenditure on a useless object, the sooner the bubble breaks the better. While opinion is so divided and so many projects are put forward no decision can be arrived at. In fact a sound opinion cannot be expected in the'- absence of, data, and therefore a survey, estimate; and return of-the - traffic . are. indispensable. One person suggests that there should be a line from Hobart Town running on to the Mersey at the foot of 'the Western Tier, but there is no information to show how the watershed in the middle of the island is to be surmounted; and the in land towns would be left alone in their glory, while the line would pass through districts where there are few inhabitants. Again, it has been proposed to follow the line of the: East Coast and thus avoid all enigineering difficulties, although the distance might be increased; but the midlanders would scarcely subscribe to the proposal for the reason lfToro given.; The Mersey -tramway is . s tanding protgst. against engaging in a work that is worthless. The unfortunate share holders in that, coincern will never see the ghost of.their money. It might as well have been cast into the-depths'of the sea for all-the benefit;liiit the proprietors or the coloniy will .deriyv from the expendi ture.i;Until a line is 'surveyed no onu can khow'the gradients end the conseeiub oxpeneof cdrindirtion and the wear and tear of working. When the promoters of the Western line decided to hlvea railway they worked fiord and 'freely spent their money√Ωto establish; the re productive character of the under-I 'taking. An fast ha ". bstaocs Wero thrown in `theirway, the were overcome. . Ton years incessant dili gdnce distinkuished those who took part in the proceedings. There is nothingyof this zeal, energy and liberality visible in the feeble agitation going on bt propeiit among those who advocate a 'midland line.. They simply ask for the disburse ment of abldrge sum 6f moiiey'utt'egr regardless of results, and without a oer taining whether tho line is practiclable, what it will cost, and what return it will yield. We foar this rockless talk will do the colony damago in England and blso whore. Looking at the contour of the country there is not the slightest pros poet that the sound of the railway whistle will be heard either at Oat lands or Quoonborough, and the meotings hold at those places can have no moral weight.. What we want to soo as a proof of earnestnoss is a subscription towards procuring a survey and railway statistics, that the question may be put before the publio in a shape which will enable thom to form an opinion. As Soon as the Western lino is finished, and is found to be suecessful, we have no doubt the proper stops will be takon to extend the line to the Half-way House on the tormts pro scribed by the Parliament, so that all that the people in the south have to do is to parcel out their half of the midland lino into railway districts, and go to work in a business-like way. DIsaoAeRFUL CONDucr.-Soveral of our fellow-townsmen have recently suffered much annoyance in having anonymous lettere sent to their houses, their windows broken by stones, their doors beemnared with tilth, or their walls or fences rendered no less loathsooms by obscene scribbling. No consideration of public morality or dockncy Is permitted to restrain the gratification in this way of personal spite. If the work of an adnitt it evinces mental degradation deeper than that of savages: if of yeaths, their future is very dark and appalliog. Should any be caught we hope they will be severely punished as where is no other way of tochming some persons good man ners.

MORVEN AGRICULTURAL SOCIETY.- A meeting, having for its object the formation of an Agricultural Society in the district of Evandale, was held at the Municipal Chambers, Evandale in June last, the result of which meeting was the formation of a Society, to be called the "Morven Agricultural Society", the principal objects being the improvement of agriculture and horticulture, and rearing the best specimens of poultry and cage birds. A Council, composing twenty-six members, was elected to manage the undertaking, and the payment of five shillings annually enttitles any person to all the privileges of membership. The first meeting of the Council was held in the Municipal Chambers on Monday last, there being sixteen members present, Edward Easton, Esq, occupying the chair. The chief business was to arrange the prize schedule for the first Exhibi- tion, which comprises premiums for poultry, pigeons, rabbits, and cage birds, not even the domesticated magpie and 'Jackass' (or Bull- thrush, as he is more delicately termed in the prize list) being omitted. Dairy produce, spring fruits, and vegetables, are also included. Alto- gether the list of prizes offered for competition to very creditable, the total amount exceeding thirty pounds. When we take into consideration the small sum that constitutes membership there is no doubt that the frst show of the Society, which will be held early in October, will be eminently successful. The following gentlemen were elected a Comnmittee to carry out the details of the Exhibition :-Messrs. Hy. Gleadow, W. Atkins, Dr. Stewart, Jno. Bryan, Easton, Sidebottom, Kidd, and G. W. Dodery. The Secretary, Mr. A. H. Boyd, was authorised to have manfactured 50 coops, or rather cages, in which to exhibit poultry, and a number of smaller ones for pigeons and rabbits. A vote of thanks being passed to the Chairman, the Council separated. LncTREac.-A lectrer will be delivered at the Mlechanics' Institute this evening on " Riga. rooma" by Mr. A. Barrett.

These conssts of 200 cartouch boxes, 500 bushys, and a quantity of ornaments and badges. The whole of the articles are of the bent quality, and have been supplied at very moderate rates. Four bugle- trumpets have also been imported. These are of new and ingeolous pattern. The instru ments are brass with the trumpet curves, but by merely reversing the tube upon which the mouth piecs is fixed, the tonce of either instrument are produced.

Adver tiser of July 11th anys-It appears that the1 system on which telegrams have been forwarded from Gallo to tlte Australia hio hitherto been a very loose and unsatisfactory one. They have been forwarded by a privato arrangement with the pursers of time vessels, tiie 1P. and O. Com pany exercIsing no control and accepting no re sponsibility for then. Thos everything was lelt to the good will and good ftiith of the pursers, who were responsible to no one for the safo cos tody or prompt delivery of the tolegrams. This is now to be altered. The company have thrown the duty upon their pnrsers, whose business it will be to take oflicial charge of all telegrams en trusted to them for the telegraph at Guile. While 110 remolneration will he demanded either for the company or their oflicers for this service, it is nevertheless enjoined upon the parnera to have it well performed. Privatn and public telegrams are to he treated precisely alike. In the inelrue. tions sent to the company from the lost Ofilce, it is required ttat telegrams sent from thecolo nice for Galn shoulti he sent open, so that the parsers may know that they really are telegrams, at they profess to be. This. we confess, is tIe only drawback n thte utility of the now arrange. mneot which we see. Telegraml sent as for as Galle, tid intended to be forwarded to Australia. otherwise than in the mails, are to be received only from the oalicers of the telegraph company, in covers allowing that they are telegrams. 'I'ie South Auotralian Government will have to make arrangements for the transfer of telegrams for that colony to the branch steamer at King George's Sound. Tto TROaNEc oF fMADGoAacAn.-ACCOrd I ing to the 'ort Louis Gazelle of 21st May the 1 Consul of Moadngacar, Mr. Lemikro, hio re ceived, through the Prime Minister of Antan anarivo, the official aononcement of the death of . thei late Queen, and the accession to the I throon of her sister, Ranovalo Manjika II., and is further informed that there will be no change f in the relations between the two countries. The f old Queen Ronovalo, the mother of Radama II., I is well known to have been one of the most cruel, immoral, and despotic of rulers, yet the t new Queen seems to glory in taking her name. The new Queen is also known to be attached to idols and heathenism much more strongly thin was the late Queen itashenina, and with a tenacity that is often maolfeated by elderly persons (silo must be past 50 years of age) for the tenets in which they have been educated.
