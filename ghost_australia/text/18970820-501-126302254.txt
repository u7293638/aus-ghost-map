Catholics and the State. ; The Pope is evidently very anxious to maintain the spiritual right and obliga tion of the Church to overrule its po litical sympathies wherever these, sym pathies interfere with its spirtual prin ciples. He hns (writes the London Spectator) just been re-asserting the duty of French Catholics to obey the State, even tnougn mat estate oe a re public. He condemns all Catholics who are disposed to ignore what they owe to Ctesar, when their duty to Ctesar is part of what they owe to God. And not only has lie done this, but, he has put forth a WHitsiinlide letter to his ''ven- erable brethren ' on the doctrine of the Trinity and the Holy Ghost, as if to re mind them that they owe him ns; much obedience in relation, to theological doc trine as they do in relation to ecclesias tical, discipline. So many of his recent pastorals .have had more or ''less 'relation to ecclesiastical discipline that lie seems to have been anxious to issue at Whit suntide a purely theological , add.ress to his clefgyi lest there should he any 'ten dency' 'to ' forget. hi# theological in 'his ecblesiasticiil authority. The letter on the third person in the Trinity is, indeed,' very interesting and significant, as sliow \- ing how earnestly Leo XIII. ponders' '* the theology of-his Church as well as the..-- drift / of its ecclesiastical orders. Though- he does not seem inclined to make peace, with the Italian kingdom, he certainly takes pains to 'let all the world know fcjiat his quarrel with Italy is, in his own opinion, rather spiritual than political.
