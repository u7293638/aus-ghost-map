OLLY WILSON'S LAUGH. When Philip Moss was being tried at the Parramatta Police Court, Mr. Oliver Wil- son, of the staff of tho Asylum for Infirm and Destitute, Parramatta, gave the habitues of the Court a bit of a start. Philip is not such a fool as he would like to make it appear ; and although one would think he had not the ghost of an idea in his head, his intellect is as keen and his wits are as much on the alert as are those of any one else. Evidence as to the value of the goods stolen had been given, and the case was just concluding when Philip struck an idea. Re-calling a witness, he said, ' What was the value of the coat ? ' (which had been damaged). " Thirteen and nine pence," replied the witness. "How could that be," queried Philip, " when it was made in Gaol?"' The ' suddenness ' of old Philip's adroit move was too much for Mr. Oliver Wilson, who roared, a la Peacock, of Victoria, ' Haha ha ? Ha-ha-ha!' "Silence" thun- dered the Sergeant of Police ; and a timorous news, scribe, sitting close along, just shrank into the toes of his shoes. 'Ha- ha-ha 'roared Olly again ? 'Ha-ha- ha !' And as Philip was lead away, the echoes in the acoustically vile ceiling and corners of the new Courthouse reverber ated with the refrain that went on ring ing in harmony with the 'pud, thunk' of Philip's iron-shod stick.
