A horror too- great for: words' fell 'upon the' assemblage, and the. less bonregeous sank- to the ground by' initinct, and lay there grovolllng ln tbe^ost: ?abjept terror. The larger nambor were 'simply doeed, bewildered, Btunned, and tor the moment knew not what to do or think. They badj- heretofore, rather enicyed the eecapades of the bttshrangere— at a distance ;' but when they beheld' these dreaded men — when they knew that at any moment death, in the shapo of a leaden bullet- might-be theirs— the ' situation was indeed altered. Borne, especially thoBe near tbe door, roared; franctically for meroy. ' Shut your mouths 1'- shouted Dan Began, ? with a fearfol oath, ' or by God 1 I'll' give you teaaon to-ery out, and that- for the Uat time, too li Be »il«nt and list«n to me, or I'll send jiome of you off to join the devil before Jour time.

'You're there,- Mr. Beardon f said he, with an evil smile, -as he noticed: that gentleman aeeking to hide 'himself, 'behind Walter Manton, who had stood 'boldly , in ' front' of- the terrified -contingent .: on the . platf6rm. .
