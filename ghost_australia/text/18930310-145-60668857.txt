1 A MdOSLEM SHIRINK. lUST ofT lth high toad, on a breezy clifl "which overlooks the .Mediterranean, two little domes peer above a rough, linle washtd wall. They indicate that a saintt and his saintly issu, (for tihe title is heredit try in Isluam) lie buried there, and, in thtei way, define the gulf which the French are so anxious to bridge over here in Algerin. Itmagineo an oblong enclosure strewn with narrow wllit tombs in all setges ofoblitera Lio nand decay, choked with waving grasses nnd slimy weeds; at its Eastern base a low, white pent-house where dwells the care taker-a good man weo llhas either obtained Iia olice aos na inocure of inheritance, or Ilas beten at pains to establish it as stuch for the benefit of Ilimlself atnd posterity. Splringing its Ot oexcrreeslco from thie northern w'all, tind built into it, is the oldelost of the koubbhs, or shtrines, a blind, white square of broad stones girt witllh a cornic of gaudy tiles, and bristling with a rude battlement, above which rites a squat, blunted donie. A glance tllrough the grating ill the door reveals darkonss ntd dim tombs, a ragged banner or two, and a bit of fadled drapery ; over overything dust, mildew, tnid spiders. eetling through tLirhe ragged bIranches of a busily old fig-tree, facing lher sister, is the youLnger of these tiwo little shrines. More aIdventurou s, flightier, stully tawdy ; making, however, w with her gay dtdo of tiles, queer seirawlitg nmottoes nd canbalistlic signs, a bright Eastern picture. Site bears an airy little f aode of three or four Itorseehoo archels poised on sltndtr spiral colhtumns-discovered through their crust of crumbling whitewash to be matrble ; relics, possibly, of the old Romian city buried here. Two tin lanterns, stuck over with pink papoer roses andt guttered candlon.eds, dangle to and fro unlder the arcado. At our filst meeting the koubbas were sitlnuolring ill i mellow glow, as if the entltit ries of warmth mid light were beintg returned to the sunti which gave tht. Notlling was wantitlng to complnetlo Lhoe Eastern glamour of tile whlolu: vivid sunshineo; white domlles cleatr cubt againlst it blue sky ; a tall ;palmn with its swaiying crouwnt of foeathlrs; a shrouded uwomai huddriled gLiietnst the twall, ttnd her dirty child tumbling IIhlf- naked among the tomttbs ; a hobbled dlonkey pain fully croplping here and theroe; and, na if to Jilliand crown the picture, it young Klabyle cane preOsently out of tiho lean-to it the end of the court carrying it crtuhe lit lher lhand.
