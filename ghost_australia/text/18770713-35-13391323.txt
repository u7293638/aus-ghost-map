It yvas said that n ship could lie uti Nelson's Bay and shell the city, but it should be remembered tint wo could pbioo bittcri'esof field gams within a couple of hours, and could throw shells upon her deck. It was an absurdity to sup- pose that a ship, in the face of the resistance MO could offer, êoulU shell the city from Nelson Bay ; and the most exag- gerated ideas were formed of the damagp which yvas likely lo bo done by the few shells which nii^ht fall in Sydnoy'. Much of tho alarm was groundless, for many of tho shells might explode without doing any upprccsblo dallinga whnlovw, even «upnosiug thoy could bo thrown into tho' city. Sir William Jcryois's report exhibited gross ignorance and the most Culpablo neglect, fur the number of men which ho had put down!» man tho butteries ho rcconimeuded woit'd bo altogether insufficient for tho purpose. Sir iVilliain Jervois recom- mended five heavy guns for Botany, and seven for New- castle, or twelve in all, with sixty men, or li ve unji to u gun. .Ile maintained that there should be 300 men, or tivcnty-livo to mch gun. Colonel Jervois rceonuneodod 500 men for forty-two guns for tho defence of Sydnoy, but he main- tained that there should bo 1030 mon, or twenty-five to oach gun. Those figures showed that the report'had not bean prepared with sutllcicnt thought, and ho yvas of opinion that tho ainondiuont of tho hon. member fur Camdon should bo tanifid. Mr. COMBES said ho would tnsve tho adjournment of the debate. If tho Government chose. Sir HENRY PARKES said he did not wish to restrict dUeussioii on such nn important subject, but could not agree to adjourn at tho rpqucst of one member. Mr. FARNELL said ho load not had an opportunity of speaking nn tho molion yet. Sir HENRY PARIÉES said if tho House could fix a day he was willing to adjourn tho debate. (Cries of go on.) Mr. COMBES said he sniy tho nccossity for having defences fur the colony, and wished to explain that the Opposition only yvished to oppose tho procuring of the iron clud. The motion, ho thought, yvas to give the Govern -meht poiviir' to order tho ironclad. [Sir HENRY PARKES: No. I have distinctly said it yvould not do so until tho money was loted.] He agreed yvith the engineer- ing part of Sir William Jcrvois's report, but ob- jected to his ligures, and held that tho Commodore should have b»cn consulted on. the question. Cnptiin Townsend was in Sydney tit the time, and why yvas ho not interrogated by the Government. They ought to pay for their own défonce, but ho thought England bud ships she did not rcquiro in her system of warfare, and could yvell spare for tho purposes of the colony. He did not think it possible1 to obtain un ironclad as cheaply as had been sug gx'Sted, nnd ho did .not consider that the Naval Brigade yvould mun the vessel. Ho was not guilty of precipitancy in tho courso ho had taken in this matter, and in view of what lind been Edited by Mr. Reed upon the systems of warfare, wo should not go to tho expense of obtninin(f the .ironclad, yvhich yvas not absolutely necessary.
