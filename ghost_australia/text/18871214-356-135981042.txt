TIlE NOBLEAN AND T1IIE SWEEP -4.-0---- . FA'rnlER IGNATIUS, preahoing in LOn don recently, told the following story : " Not very long ago a nobleman in Beigravia, as he was passing from his. door to his carriageo, encountered a swoop- who had boon swooping his chimneys, and the sweeoop had the courage to look up and say, 'Have you the wealth of Christ's salvation ?' Two months later the nobleman was dying, and he sentfor this swoop, and from him received the knowledge of God by the power of the Holy Ghost. The nobleman wept for joy, and, as he died, fell asleep in the Arkof the Cove. nant, possessed of the unsearchable riches of Christ. This," said Father Ignatius, "was a perfectly true story, and he had related it as an illus tration because he wanted to bring home to their hearts the poverty of the world."
