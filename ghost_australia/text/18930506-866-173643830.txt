M r B entley acted with a pow er an d in te n sity w hich aroused an in te rest in hfa perform ance which never afterw ards flagged. Mr B entley portrayed th e conflicting em otions by w h id i the character fa so deeply stirred, w ith an elocutionary s k i 11 a n d a strength and fervor which n e v er failed t o move th e audience.

Tho poetical side of th e character is lo st sight of in th e practical.
