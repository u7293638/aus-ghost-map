Are there Ghosts? Since it is not only possible that persons can return from another world, but that there are well-authenticated accounts of persons who have done so, must we, i-nt:ii, irciiu«»iiii I'tit: curt em stories auout spirits or ghosts? By no means, for there is not one of them out of a thou sand worthy of the least, credence, or could stand the test of examination. They all, in almost , every case, can bo explained in a natural way, even those of the reality of which there appears- to be little doubt. Fear and an excited imagination will conjure up imaginary npparitions and spectres; so will, a gloomy and melancholy temperament. When the Puritans, of whom gloom and melan choly were the characteristic qualities, became the dominant power iu England in 1649. we read that there was a wide spread fear of ghosts never known before iu the land. Remorse of conscience for great 'and unnatural crimes will, too, bring up unreal spectres threatening punishment or vengeance. The real ghosts, then, in the past, beyond what a deluded imagination painted, have been few and far between, and they promise to be so in the future. Nor is it neces sary that there should he many ghosts, since we have ' Moses and the Pro phets' to direct and warn us, and do jiot need' the spirit of a Lazarus to come from tho ' bosom of Abraham ' to do so. If, however, a genuine ghost should appear to any of us — which, after all, is possible — to ask, perhaps, the assistance of our prayers, or otherwise to warn us, we need not feel the least alarm, parti cularly so if our conscience be at peace with God, for no ghost, no spirit, no ap parition — not. even a fancy — can do us any harm or injury unless by God's per mission. — Catholic Review.
