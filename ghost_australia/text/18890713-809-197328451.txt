OUR "SECULAR" SYSTEM. to the editor of the age. sir, — Will you permit mo through your colums to call attention to a matter that con cerns my co-religionists to nn extent that calls for tho interposition of Parliament ? I prefer bringing it before tho public through your widely circulated paper to complaining of it to the Minister of Education, who might, as a memhor of the Church ot England, tnlco a different view of it to iliat which is forced 011 me by conscience. I had lately occasion to visit, the Brighton Stato school, No.' 1542, taught by Mr. Webb, to seo about placing un orphan nephew of mine as a pupil with him. To my surprise, I saw hanging on tho walls of this gentleman's office somo specimens of the penmanship of his scholars, which I copied whilo waiting. They ran as follows : — " Now tho generation of Jesus Christ was as follows : — When his mother Mary was espoused to Joseph beforo they came together, sho was found with child of the Iloly Ghost. ... for that wiiich is conceived in her is of tho Holy Ghfist." Sir, as I havo no dosiro to hurt any man's religious eonvictions, I mako no comment ou theso passages, pro fessing to be writton by children of 8 ana 10 years old. But as a J ew I protest in the vory strongest manner against such teaching as this in the public soliools, for whioh I and my follow Jews pay our fair share. I do this on religious grounds, hut wero I a Christian I should, as a father of a family, protest quite as strongly against this teaching 011 tho scoro of decency. Are our obildroii to he taught the moaning of the words that this teacher appeared to bo prond of having been copied by mere babes of 8 and 10 1 And if so I ask you, Sir, in all revorenco, is it decent? For my own pait tlio fear of it compelled me to abandon the idea of sending my ncphow to tho school. — Yours, &c.;, A JEW.
