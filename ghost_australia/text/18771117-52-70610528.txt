Nuriu the Carltons, and play commenced about ll o'clock by tue latter going first to the wickets, the possession of which they succeeded in occupying until lunch time-at a quarter- past 1 \- putting together 137 runs. Several of the players showell some excellent batting, in which point of the game the Can tons appear to be especially strong this ' season. " Hall (30).

BATHURST.-On the birthday of the Prince of Wales and the succeeding day, the cricketers of Newtown engaged in a friendly game of bat and ball with the Bathurst men. From the list of names given below it will be noticed that neither club mustered its full first eleven strength; Newtown being short of Scanlan, Bullen, &c; whilst for the Bathurst, West, Cassidy, and Bonnor were numbered with the missing ; there was, nevertheless, suffici ent talent left to render the contest interesting. Webster, as usual, captained tho suburbanites; and Tress acted as the Bathurst general. The former winning the toss, elected to send his men to the wiekets, which were in excellent order, and reflected Kudos on tho custodian of the ground. The first innings of the visitors reached 100, bar one, of which total Sheridan made 35 in good stylo, Gawthorpe 21 (not nut), Tindall 13, and Webster 12. For the '. City of the Plains," Palmer and Dawson were the first representatives ; the for mer treated the few spectators who were present to a display of careful and good cricket, his score (35) was the highest on his side ; Ferguson and Durack coming next, with double figures to their credit. . The innings closed for 81,18 behind their opponents' total. The next day was more suitable for cricket, the sun's rays being less powerful than on the Prince's natal day. The Bathurstonians again took the field and liad a big day's work in store, as the Newtowners went in fortall figures. The most noticeable feature of the match was Tindall's performance in the second innings; by a series of spleudid drives, and fine offensive all round play, he put together 103, without giving the ghost ol' a chance. Crane contributed 41, ana Sheridan, Gawthorpe, Webster, and Watson, also troubled tho recorders. Tho innings concluded for 229, a largo score on a not very fast ground. In their second essay the Bathurst team tolled up 90 runs, to which Thompson and Ferguson (21 each) and Durack (16) were the chief contiibntors. The fielding on bothsides was not Al, several catches being missea, which, if secured, would have materially decreased the totals. The bowling analyses have not been kept with sufficient accuracy, so we can only say that, for Newtown, Payten, Sheridan, Tindall, and Webster were most suc cessful; while, for Bathurst, Palmer and Kotton did tile best of tile trundling. The local men did everything to make their visitors comfortable; in fact, of tue many country excursions made by the Newtown C. C., the trip to Bathurst will ever be remembered as the most enjoyable. ! NEWTOWN. First Innings. , Second Innings.

Jor the University the highest scores were-Sly, 30. and 6; ir0-well, 0 and 33 ; M'Mahon, 14 and 13 ; and for Orange club : ^?r. Buckland, 0 and 24 ; and Mr. G.

An occasional correspondent sends us an ; account of a cricket match plaved at Tumut on tho 9th November, be tween the Tumut and Wagga Wagga clubs. It was the first contest thte season for the Jones Challenge Cup ; and in Albury, Wagga, Cootamundra, Gundagai, Adelong, Tumut, and surrounding districts great interest was taken in the event. The Tumut players .were the holders of the Cup, having won two matches last season, and the Wagga 1 men (who arrived in a coach and four) appeared to feel confident that they would take tbs Cup back with them ; but, as the result shows, they had to return without it. Between 300 and 400 persons were present. The ground (recreation re serve) was in splendid order. H. Donovan captained tho Wagga team, and P. M. Blakeney the Tumut men, who went in , first. . In their . innings the local team scored 151, of which C. H. Croaker contributed 36, F. G. Crofton 29, P. M. Blakeney 28, and J.D. O'Mara, 22. T. Thompson, M. Moran, and H. Donovan bowled for Wagga. The Wugga eleven were all disposed of I in their first innings for 41, of whicli the only double figure contributed was 10 by Weston; and in their second innings: (having to follow on) for 53, J. Willans making 14 of theso, and Thompson ll. C. A. Lovett and B. Clayton bowled for Tumut in the first innings and also in the second/with H. L. Harris and P. M. Blakeney. TheTumut team, therefore won in ono innings, with 57 runs to spare. This is the third time the Tumut cricketers have beaten the Wagga club for the Cup, but to entitle them to keep it they must hold it for three consecutive seasons. Mr. K. Clayton presented a bat to the highest scorer ia tile match, and Mr. J. Blakeney a ball to the bowler with the best average. The bat was won by H. Croaker and the ball by P. M. Blakeney. The Wagga men took their defeat in very good part, and they left on Saturday afternoon, hurrahing for Tumut at the top of their voices. A well-contested game of cricket was played at Farmer and Co.'s ground on tho Prince of Wales's birthday between the Thornton and the Eaton cricket clubs, resulting in a victory for the Thornton by one wicket and 17 runs. For the latter club Matton played a brilliant innings for 20 and not out. Bastian, Collen, and Hardie also batted well for the same club. The bowling of Cohen and Matton for the Thornton was very effective. The batting of Rowley and Allen for the Eaton was also very good ; Rowley played a splendid innings for 19. The bowling of Messrs. B. and D. M'Laughlan and Rowley for the Eaton was worthy of notice. Mr. Paton de serves a word of praise for the smart way In which he kept the wicket for the Eaton. The Thornton was captained by W. Bastian, J. Paton acting in a like manner for the Eaton. . BURRY (ST. PETERS) V. PBINCE ALFRED.-A match was played at Camperdown, on Saturday, November] 10, between the above clubs, which resulted in an easy victory for the Surry. The batting of Bennett (34). and Chapel (18),1 lor the Surry was very good, while for the Prince Alfred, Farnworth was at the head of the list, with ll to his credit. The bowling of Louden, for the Surry, was very effective, taking 10 wickets for 20 runs. BELVIDERE 2ND ELEVEN v. BRONZEWING.-A match was ' played on the University Oval.'on the 9th instant, between the 2nd eleven of the Belvidere and the Bronzewing (Parra matta), which resulted in an easy victory for the former by one innings and 165 runs. S. A. Lindeman, who captained the Belvidere, having won the toss, sent his men in first, and some of the players, notably Sheldon (117), Ward (23), Anderson(19), Smith (16), and Teece (ll), showed some ex cellent batting talent, the innings terminating for 224 runs, The Bronzewing, who were captained by Bradbury, then took their position at the wickets, but were easily disposed of for a total of 7 runs. They then followed up their innings, and, S. and A. James and Bradbury having made a good stand, succeeded in putting together an additional 52 runs, making a grand total in the two innings of 59 runs. The bowling ot Cay-96 balls, 19 runs, 6 ra.o., 9 wickets ¡and Ward-116 balls, 18 runs, 12m.o., and 8 wickets-for the Belvidere was praiseworthy and effective. ',
