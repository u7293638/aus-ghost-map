EEBOUEOES OF SHU gdUTB-EAga?. We quota the following further chapter on the South-Eeast from the peg of the speoial correspondent of the South Australian Adver There ia certainly no district in the colony that affords greater contrasts to the eye of the visitor than the line o" country which hia vision embraces aa he travels southerly and to the east from the Adelaide railway-station to Mount Gambier, and then again to Millicenfc and the seaports on the coast.: Everyone ia familiar enough with the charming scenery that meets the eye aa the train Burmoisata its 1 ia 40 grade till the station at Moint Lofty is reached, and with the plots ov orobard and farden lands where fruits and vegetables of all inda may be seen growing in'abundance on either side of the line, Skirting Mount Barker, the garden of the colony, we sun through Nairno tojvarda Oallington, where there is a wonderful change in the eharaoter of the country, and bleak uplands and hungry-looking valleys prepare ua for the dismantled smelting houses and other evidences of mining explora tion iu the past; not, however, because the mineral treasures of the district have been exhausted, as there is every iiklihood that with j our later knowledge and modern improvements in mining many valuable discoveries may yet I be made in the country through which the j Nairne line passes between that township and the Murray, There is one strip for example on the other side of Oallington to, which my attention was direoted by a skilled mining man, who said the surface indications were those of a coalfield, and that it was the only pUee ha had seen in South Australia wbifch.bore a close resemblance to the Newcastle country in New South-Wales, On referring to the map issued by the Government Geologist I find he haa noted this piece of oountry as bein^ a metal bearing formation of the plutomo period, which does not favor the supposition that coal might be found there 5 but it may ba that the locality has not been more than superficially surveyed, and that an exploration of this red sandstone bar of country might be attended with Roodsssultu, The traveller of to»day who obtains an excellent meal at the Murray Bridge refreshment rooms (and, by-the.w&y;, a flourish* ing little township with a very good hotel haa sprung up at the bridge since the railway opened), and then settles himself down com fortably to repose, or a game of whist, while he is being conveyed at forty miles < an hour across the desert, is in blisBful ignorance of the troubles of the overland traveller in the somewhat recent coaching days. Then the desert journey was something to j ba remembered, and many a vmrd story can be told by those who in old timea ooaohed it. along the Ooorong. 1, have my ! aelf' & vivid recolleation of being regaled with the story of Malachi Martin, and his murderous exploits, on a dark dis mal wintry night; and when we pulled up at the wayside shanty at Salt Creek to ohange our horses and get a bite of refreshment the midnight hour had just struck, An old woman was bending over a capful of fire, oooking egga, when my voluble companion offered to take me into the next room and show me the bloodstains on the walls where Malachi had beaten out the brains of his unfortunate ser vant girl, Never shall I forget the look of horror and alarm with which the old woman turned upon us and implored uiy companion to speak no more on the subject. " Oh, don't 'ee sir, don't; for God's sake don't say any more, or I shall eea the poor girl's ghost when you are gone. There are no bloodstains there now j they were painted out years ago," said Bhe, and I certainly had no ourwaity to witness them, even had they not been removed. But I could not help reflecting on the dismal fate of the poor old creature, who was compelled to live in a place where the chance remarks of a Sassing stranger could arouse in her mind all le horrible associations of the murderer and hia viotims. Stories of wreck and massacre and of outrage by the blacks were given a local coloring by tne narrator as we passed the spot where they were enacted; and these, with the discomforts of bad weather, a rough road, and a terribly jolting coaoh, made the all-night journey along the Coorong anything but a pleasant one, Thank goodness the iron horse has demolished that state of things, and in any thing but a seething hot day the run across the desert can now be undertaken with ease and in comparative comfort, One cannot help apeoulating on the future of the vast tract of country which lies between the Murray and Border Town as mile after mile of mallee scrub meet the eye in our onward progress, and our best wishes for success go out towards Mr, Seott in his plucky venture at Emu Flat, I have twice visited the plantations there, and they form so remarkable a contrast to the desert wilds which aurroundf thorn that we must regard Mr. Scott and his coadjutors as benefaotors to the public if they succeed in Bhowing there is country in the desert that can be profitably occupied, I have no doubt they will accomplish this desirable end, and that many thousands of acres in the " desert" will ere long be selected and settled upon, The railway authorities have proved that water can be pretty easily obtained in other places besides Emu Flat, and the Conservator _ of Forests has indicated the various uses to which large areas of the desert may be profitably put, such as growing the wattle and the pine 5 while at jlmu E|at the visjtor can himself see the vinei fruit trees, and vegetables enjoying luxuriant growth. The approach to Border Town is heralded by clumps of timber, indicating the improved eharaoter of the soil, and remaining there a night J found two good hotels in the township tynd ft number of stores, an institute, school, &6, which prove that it has a future before it, ana possibilities of enlargement which may depend a great deal upon the enterprise of the inhabitants and occupants of the surrounding country. X find on reference to statistics that the land uuder the district council comprises the hundreds of Tatiara, Wirrega. Parsons, md fjtirliqg, 1,5Q0 square miles. The amount of the assessment ia ±122,000 ; the rates realise gl,lQ0j and the groqa revenue about £2,300, not inoluding the main roads grant, Border Town fs one of the oldest locations in the Southeast, whose usefulness was recognised by the Government so far back as 1851, when it was ft depot for the gold escort from the diggings j and portions of the old "pub" where Inspector Tolmar and hia men found quarters \yhen in charge of the precious metal is still attached j»o the principal hotel, There is one grievance under which border Town amarta at the present time, and that is the change of gauge which takes place at Wolseley, and which formerly occurred at Border 'lown, Where every provision had been made in the shape of a turntable, end a coupla of good water dams. Why the newer plaoe should have superseded the older in this matter I can hardly understand, as the only saving effected if, X am told, tha running of the aartlagaa a distance of nine miles along the line, whereas the engine has to travel thin distance to turn round and to take m water, Possibly the railway authorities have good and sufficient reasons why the change should have been rpade, ljut to the ordinary traveller it Beetfis odd that Border Town should have bean superseded by Woheley, especially aa Service ton is ao near to the latter place, Border Town haa a well-to-do aspect, and can this year boast of very good oropa} and the fact that it has also an agricultural eooiety and show grounds Is a proof that ita lands are fit to sustain a farming community, aine miles from Border Town, ia w v "aKioh was laid out under the private townsuijj - . -.*<* 0f the impression that it would be_ m.* . - principal stopping plaoea on the intercolonial line, but haa since been robbed of this distinc tion by the Viotorian Commissioners deoiding upon Serviceton being the border Customs station. Wnlaeley ia well enough situated, except that it labors under the disadvantage of much of the surrounding country being educa tional reaervea that have been leased in largo blocks for grazing. It would have boea much better haa these blocks been thrown open to the farmers, aa the aoil ia good and the climate more suitable for the settlement of a popu lation than the Northern lands outside Goyder's line of rainfall. At Wolaelev the traveller from the South-Bast changes from the narrow to the broad gauge traiu, The station accom modation is scanty, and although a fair meal ia provided at the hotel opposite, as the build ing ia not of a pretentious character, it does not seem to be largely patronised, Narraooorte, 240J miles distant from Ade laide, is one of the oldest towns in the colony, having been founded by Mr, William Mac intosh in 1848, and it is satisfactory and singular to relate that at this diatant data from its first settlement its founder is still residing in the town with various members of his family, The original name pivea ft tho MttiMMw \m pwsMjfr M 4 village in Scotland, the birthplace of Mr. Maolntoah, but the Government township was named Namcoorte from a native designation of the cveek, which runs through the town, and at floodtime contains a consider able body of water. The original name of Kinoraig haa therefore fallen into disuse, but the attempt to form a Government township haa failed, as the principal business places ana residences are situated in the old township, which is pioturesquely placed on the sides of groqnd which slopes down to the creek. Before the railway Narracoorte waa made lively with coached and teams, but the iroD horae has de prived It of much of this exoitemeat, and tha plaoa is now comparatively dull, It is & wsU» built town with Rood hotels, institute, and other public buildings, &ud; if the large aroaa of equattlng lands whioh surround it could be sold or leaeea for farming and agricultural pursuits Narraooorte would again become a place of considerable importance, Squatters' runs border the very edge of the township, and it seema a pity that bettor use cannot ba made of much of the l&ad; than that to whioh it ia at present devoted. Tha famous oaves, whioh ; ere eitu&ta; some seven miles out of tha town, X was unable to visit, but waa regaled by a friend with some good stories of how titled celebrities had been induced to crawl on all-fours through the " post-office" when they might have walked upright round a corner where their friends were waiting to reoeive and con gratulate them on their aorobatio exploits. I was pleased to hear that Mr. Hutohi. aon has a number of promising thorough- J breds which should attraot attention from buyers at the cowing sales, and that the local ooureing olub (the oldest in the colonies) ere making good progress with their new plumpton, whioh they also intend to use aa a racecourse. The famous greyhound, Rho danth?, now owned by Messrs, Robertson, is, I was also pleased to learn, alive and well ana bringing up a litter of five pups by an equally famoua sire, Capri (imp.)i by Canute-Little Star, The ceaeon has been a favorable one for the landowners round Narracoorte, and an idea of the district can be obtained from re cently-compiled figures"The Hundred of Narracoorte wntaina 00 square miles, and its roads and works are constructed by a district council whioh has been in existence 17 years, Under the Local Government Bill this ares, was increased to over 700 square miles, and in cludes the Hundreds of Narracoorte, Hynara, Binnum, Jessie, Robertson, Joanna, Locnaber, and Glenroy. The assessment of the district counoil for the old district was £15,081 10a., and the year's rate at a shilling in the pound came to £764 la, fld, The enlarged dis trict has an assessment on a much lower basis. The annual value of the property ia assessed at £34,852 10a,, and the rates amount to £1,712 18s, The assessment ia divided between the four wards as underCentral Ward (Hun dred nf Narracoorte), £10,501 17s. 9d,; South EaotWard (Hundreds of Jmie, Joanna, and Robertson), £12,528 8s, 6d,; North Ward (Hundreds of Binnum and Hynam), £7,80715a. od.j Weat Ward (Hundreds of Loohabev and Glenroy), £4,015 2s,: 4d. There ia sn overdraft of about ,.£fl00* About' thres: years ago a sub stantial stone counoil chamber was built in Ormerod-street at a coat of about £800. Many of the buildings are of white limestone with sandstone faoinga, and include the railway, station, three banks, four churches, the counoil chamber, a post and telegraph office in Orrne. rod-street, institute, State school, and three hotels. On the north of the creek are the Local Court buildings and the flourmill," I observed while strolling up towards the cemetery a very lively rabbit . warren in some rising sandy ground, and could not understand why the bunny and hin numerous progeny should be permitted to form a oolony so near to the township, and right up to the fence of the last resting-place of the inhabitants. It is not a nice thing to contem plate that the rodent may be burrowing on the other side of the fence amongst the coffins, or even the bones, of the dead, The hotelkeepers and storekeepers of Narracoorte hava unques tionable oauea for complaining of the " quiet times" in their township, aa with pastoral country all round them, and a commercial deoline brought about oy railway extension, they have little improvement to hope for in the immediate future. Some day no doabt the rich lands that lie beyond the belt of sand and sorub will be subdivided, or let out to farmers and graziers, and then will Narracoorte once more become a flourishing town and a pleasant place of resort for the oountry siders,
