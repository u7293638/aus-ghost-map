UNTIL DEATH. Make me no vows of constancy, dear friend— To love me though I die, thy whole life long, ' And love no other till thy days shall end; - Nay—it were rash and wrong. If thou canst love another, be it so ! I would not teach out of my quiet grave - To bind tby heart, if it should choose to go. Love shall not be a slave. My placid ghost, I trust, will walk serene In clearer light than gilds these earthly morns Above the jealousies and envies keen ' Which BOW this life with thorns. Thou wouldst not feel my shadowy caress, . If, after death, my soul should linger here; Men's hearts crave tangible, close tenderness^ Love's presence warm and near. It would not make me sleep more peacefully That thou wer't waiting all thy life is woe For my poor sake: what love thou bast for me x Bestow it ere I go. Carve not upon a stone when I am dead The praises which remorseful mourners give To women's grace—a tardy recompense— But speak them while I live. Heap not the heavy marble on my head To dint away the sunshine and the dew; Let small blooms grow there, and the grasses wave. And rain drops filter through. Though wilt meet many fairer and more gay Than I, bnt trust me, thou cans't never find One who will love and serve thee, night and day, With a more single mind. Forget me when I die; the violets Above my rest will blossom just as blue. Nor miss thy tears: ev'n Nature's self forgets * But while I live be true. '
