Louise Berta. won the Sapling Stakes, Edith being a close second, and.Ganbaldi third. A field of 13..horses came out to contest-for -field honours. The fact that tbe followera of ibe Howling Forest stable bad .backed-Huntsman in doubles with Wymlet:led- to agread deal of.straight-out business .about, the former, and the odds against hun. at starting were 5 to 2, nottoo liberal conldermg. the character of the race,, The: Agent, ; notwithstanding: his. loadj was st 4 to 1, and Hippognff liad sound, support at a, point more. In the first round The Ghost, in trying to lump - through instead sit oyer tbe hurdle opposite tbe stand, rolledover, and shot Batty away to one Devizes fell at the top of the hilJ, and in the second, round The: Ace came to grief at the: back of thecourse near:theimud wall- 1 Cam kept the favourite in a good position all through, -while The: Agent cantered along rthsbehmd anything m the race.

The, Agent's double victory at Fleni-. ington and Calilfield.in 1SS5 is likely to be remembered. -Duration led the rest of the field, home, "but Huntsman .-did -not get a better position than fifth. <;The Selling Race" was re-' duced to-ia match between Cincmnatus and Breeze, the former being favourite at 7 to 4 on' him.* The favourite, however, • very disappomting, for ithe plam-loolang! rchesnut canteredslonginlToat'oSbim, aod.won as beliked- ,The>,chief event,^-the Grand National'Steeplechase, came next, and the fact of all nine ihorses- being ibacked: showed that the race was considered a.iver.y open one. The steeplechase couree'was much more formidable than • wheu the Marquis of Waterford scored his : ivictoryri-last,'year. Opposite the stand a big., double had been added m the shape of palings »n<i ia typical f ' chock and Jog." "Viewedfrom - the- take-off -side, the white palings seemed terribly, high, and. .trouble was anticipated at this point. -!.-Nor were these conjectures wrong; [ for starting ud near the turn the horse were obliged to take tbe palmge at the very outseti and.
