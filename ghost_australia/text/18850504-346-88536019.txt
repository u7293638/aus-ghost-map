SPORTING NOTES.' THE TURF. S.A.J.C. Races. I from our MELBOURNE CORRESrOXDEKT.) v Saturday. 2nd May. The somewhat peculiar experiment of holding a South Australian Race meeting 011 the Flemington Course wus tried to-daj". For some time its racing matters have, it appears, been in a bad way at South Australia, owing to the severity of the betting laws, and it was thought, pending some steps which are being taken over there with a view of re-establishinS the sjHjrt, that tho Cup Meeting might be hold at Flemingtou, instead of Mor ■ phetville this year. The V.K.C. granted the use of their ground without any charge, and save that the names on the card were different, there was n?t much to indicate that the meeting was not one of our own. The weather turned out as fine as could have been wished, but the attendance was- only moderate, ills Excellency and suite were present. There was Somo good racing. The St. Leger resulted in n win for I he Broker after a great set-to with Silver King, whom he defeated by a head, and the Goodwood Handicap was won by Lantern.
