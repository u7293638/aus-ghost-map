_-CRICKET iNOTES. ~-4-- S-. s tÂ£ TO ... -..,^l LOOKING BACKWARD! AT the close of the season 1890-4-the season that the North Melbourne-CriclkeL -Club -eJanlishcd latnianOlder iuds had been endcavouring-to do-for years, and had signally faile-ls--wbsIthl ' Shield, Pennant, and Badges offered for competition amongst the senior clubs by the Victorian Cricketers' Association, thlere-arosea cry of:greatjoy through out the leniglhsandbreadtlh f. the Ncorth ern suburl.8- The fatted call iv:n brought forth arid killed;iCthe fuin: l bnked meats were placed upon the table: the ring-no, a medal this-- time--was placed on the watch-dcain of each II:ent her of the successful First Eleven, and an effulgent :sinile'ofhanppiness radiited the countenances of all concerned. Yet fringeing all this joyousness was an element of discord: the honme" they had been for years working for was to be no longer .their home. The fiat had gdn forth, and the hitherto happi fasmi!? wa toba ruthlesslyitorn asunder, and scattered to the four corners of the earth. Simiply tated, the Nortli Melbourne Town Counrcil had gone back on its promise to hanid over the manage ment of the North 'Melbourne Recrea tion Reserve to the Cricket Club; and the combined efforts of the members and its magnificent team of players to place Northl Melbourne in the hononred position of Premiers of thle Queen City of the South were set at naught. Whait was result of this caup de grace administered by a body whose one aim should have been to nurture and sustain an.organis ation which promised to prove so im nortant a factor in bringing their town Into promipence and _ repute ? What followed ? In the ensuing season this great team, shorn of its lustre by tile migration of three of its most prominent players-all of whomt could have been induced to stop had there been a ghost of a chance of things being satisfactorily settled-to a northern colony; and the inability of their much-respected captain to take part in the first few matches were absolutely last-beaten in the end by a team of comblined juniors said to represent the Fitzroy Cricket Club. However, defeat brought forth re-action. The Carltons and Drape once more in their midst, and Houston again in full command, the present season crowned all their previous efforts. Victory after victory followed; and, when the season closed on last Saturday week-Univer sity being defeated by an innings and 192 runs-their triumph was complete undefeated! And should their right to the position be questioned, they can proudly point to the bowling averages for the season, at the head of which stand the names of the two Nortl Mel bourne bowlers-Carlton and McClel land. In addition to which, Jack Carlton is not far from the leading batting average, with George Stuckey close up, and George Bean and Gerber in prominent positions. 'ow, Messieurs, the Committee of Manhgement-ot the North Melbourie Recreation Reserve, arise to the occasion, and .. Give those giants of the game, \- A ground worthy of the name! Arise ye people of North Melbourne, and aid them, for without your assis tance, and without your aid these gentle men" cannot be expected to master the financial difficulties which so surely will beset them in accomplishing this great object. Don't let the finger of scorn the epithet "glue-pot" be again employed as a descriptive synonyn of what should be one of the most beautiful reserves in or round our great metropolis. In re ference to thle doings of the team for the season just concluded, where all have united- in one: great effort. to raise the team to its presenoor n-prud-mino encr,- is_ somewhat invidious to single out special players for individual commendation. Every man in the team-which was one compact mass, not disintegrated as is often the case with stronger organisa tions--helped to achieve the object attained. But I should be wanting in that homage due to a monarch of the game were I not to make'special refer ence to the doings of Jack Carlton both with the b.t and ball, for he is actually at the head of -both departments for his club; though McClelland is nomi nally first in bowling-where play all round has been of the very first water; and with him must be bracketted Richard S. Houston-good old " Ricketty," whose generalship-Dick is acknowledged to be the best skipper in the colony-lias been of inestimable service to his side. It will not be out of place either to refer to Dick's perforiiances with the gloves this season, which have,'in the opinion of all well-known authorities of tihe game, placed .him scond-to-oo therwickei keeper'i the' colony.:. The Committee of the Club, too, is a real "live " one, coached by that nonpareil of secretaries, Ernie Bean, whose efforts on behalf of his club have qiite- justified all the en= comiums that have been passed upon him; and his place will be hard to fill by any iDnfoittinate who may have to'follo0 in his footsteps.
