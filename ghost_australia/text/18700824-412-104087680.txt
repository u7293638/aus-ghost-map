A FKBNCH GHOST STORY. . .. i Galignani tells a curious story respect ing- the trial of a small farmer named Pfister, of the Department- , of . Ras; Rhin, for a breach of the Game Laws.; A peasant returning- home late' one: night, saw, as he thought, the horned 5 head of a frightful monster in a pool, j which he had to pass. He rushed! breathless to the village with an alarm-; ;ing account of the demon, and a band; .of. villagers immediately sallied forth j with weapons. When ; they came to the pond they saw. the creature, and : Pfister fired at it. It turned out to be ' only a stag which had gone into the ; pool for coolness. As the ; harm was done, the body was cut up and divided, and the village feasted. However, the authorities heard of the story, and Pfister was prosecuted for a breach of ? the game laws, the shooting season having closed. An advocate who de fended him called attention to the fact that on the same day as that on which the offence had been committed the Prince Imperial had shot a stag in the forest of Pontainebloau, that, all the journals had recounted the exploit, and that no judicial proceedings had been instituted against his Imperial High ness. The advocate did not desire the application of the law against the Prince, but only asked for indulgence in consequence of the coincidence. However, the tribunal was properly impressed with the difference between a prince and a farmer, and condemned Pfister to 50fr. fine, and the payment of costs, ordering also the gun to be confiscated. Under the circumstances a ghost would have been the more satisfactory antagonist.
