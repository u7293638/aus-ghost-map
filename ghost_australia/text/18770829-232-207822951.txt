A REAL GHOST STORY. A deal of excitement has been censed in Plattsbnrg by the rumor that a certain house in Devon street was haunted.- On Monday night a large cumber of people assembled in front of ibe honse to UVten to the strange noises that were made hem time to lime, the constable being also on the spot, thinking that some trick was being played. After wailing some time a noise like a stone or ball rolling along tbe honse for a short dis tance was heard, then stopped with a hollow thud, ac companied -with a hissing noise- The constable ran round tbe bouse, thirling te catch the trickster, but there was nothing there. " By Jove," he says, " 1 don't believe in ghosts, hobgoblins, or fairies, bnt that's a queer noise!" One of tbe females in the house, with more courage than the rest, spoke np and eaid," Be you ghost ordevil, speak, that we may know what yon are." Afterwards a slight knocking was heard like a raMatatat; then a distinct knock. This ghost is unlike the general ran of ghosts— it makes itself heard in the daytime as well as midnight. The house in which thia disturber of the peace is located is bmU of weatherboard, and lined inside with pine, and tbe ' proprietor intends to poll that part of the honse down where the noise is principally heard, to dislodge, if possible, this spiritual visitant. T he peculiar noise that is heard has been notioeable for some time. About twe months ago a young man died there. Two hours after he died the eame rat-tat noise was heard that is diseentable now. — Writing again on Wednesday, our contemporary adds: — "The owner of the honse ahnded to, thinking there is 6omething supernatural about this extraordinary affair, has pulled down several weatherboards to find out the cause, bat he could find nothing except one little moose hole, c bwebs being thickly interfaced between the etods of ire honse, showine that nothinv aarthlv had been th.ro"— ttanau-Je Eerald.
