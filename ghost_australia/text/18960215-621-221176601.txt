Shooting at a Ghost. The Rochester correspondent of the "Age" reports as follows:â€” For several evenings an apparition has been observed flitting about at the back of the railway station. Residents of a nervous aisposuion nave Deen greatly exercised In their minds over the ad vent of the "spook," which has come in close contact with after dark pedes trians 011 several occasions. The "spook" is described by those who have seen it at close quarters as resembling a tall woman in black, who approaches way farers as though about to address them, then, without a moment's warning, di verges In an opposite direction an appa rition in white. The police incline to the belief that the "ghost," who is ex ceedingly fleet of foot, Is the author of many acts of pilfering that have been reported to them lately, and is a man in woman's clothing. A tragedy was narrowly averted last night, and more by chance than otherwise, for the ap parition was once more abroad, and being observed by Mr T. Moore, a re spectable resident of the locality, he procured a gun and took a pot shot at the intruder, but, as far as can be learned, without serious effect.
