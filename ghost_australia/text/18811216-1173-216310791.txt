Concert. The Wallaroo Alinea Giee G!ub and Christy Miuistiels gave a concert in the Moonta Institute on Monday evening last which deserved far better patronage from the Moonta public than it received. The programme consisted of Glees by the Glee Club, and songs by Mr. JS. Thomas, Mr. T. J. Price and Mr. T. Ricknrd. Both the former gentlemen are great favorites and received hearty applause. Tbe second part opened with a step dnnce by Mr. R. Casely, who was greatly admired by lovers of this noisy art, and then came an overture, and songs by Messrs. H. Narkervis, T. J. Price, R. Piper, S. Thomas and E. Parneil. Mr' Price's " Did 'em wake 'cm up" was received with laughter and heariy applause, and Mr. Thomas' "She sleeps, sweetly s eeps" was very tastefully sung. The proceeding* closed with a " Ghost scflne' which orealed great merriment. We hope when the Club again visits Moonta it will Moonta it will receive nittefi better support than it didon Monday evening. . ..
