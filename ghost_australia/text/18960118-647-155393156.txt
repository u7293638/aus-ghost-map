WITNESSING FOR CHRIST. If Christianity' ever conquers this world it must be through the agency of Christ's followers. Jetus told His disciples that they were to be His witnesses in Jerusalem, in all Judea, in Samaria, and unto the uttermost parts of the earth . Saul of Tarus, when converted, received a message that he was to be a witness unto all men of w hat he bad experienced. Peter taught the brethred to be ready meekly to give to every inquirer a re aeon for the inward hope. No professor of religion has a right to con' ceal his identity. He must let his light shine. He must confess with his lips what he believes with his heart. In the great day of account Christ will be aBhamed of tho^e who are ashamed of him here. We must hold fast the profession of our faith without wavering. We are co-witnesseB with the Holy Ghost (read John xv. 26,27), and wherever the Spirit of God is testifying to the truth, experienced Christians must be ready to confirm that testimony. Nothing else is so powerful in persuading Binners to turn to God. Nothing else is so effectual in increasing faith. (Phil, vi.) Nothing else so surely calls down from heaven God's saving grace. (Acts iv. 33.) The saints have alwayB overcome ' by the word of their testimony.' Let that word ring forth in the class-meeting, general service, out in the world, everywhere. At all times, by life,- deed, spirit, song, speech, and bearing, own the truth that Jesus has saved you. and that you commend His salvation to all around you. â€” Michigan Christian Advocate. j
