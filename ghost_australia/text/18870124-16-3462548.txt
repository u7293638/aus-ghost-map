THE FLOODS. The terrible floods which have visited the south-eastern part of the colony have proved even more disastrous than was at first sup- posed. It has been generally believed for some years past that the extensive dredging in the lower reaches of the river would prevent a recurrence of the high floods that in years gone by have destroyed property in and around Brisbane. But the events of the past few days have shown this to be a mistake, for at the site of the Dry Dock the water was yesterday 6in. higher than in the great flood of 1864, as shown in the official records. The suddenness of the rise in the water was one of the worst features of the disaster, and this cannot be wondered at when it is known that over 24in. of rain have fallen during the past three days. Unhappily the flood has not been unattended with loss of life. At least two men have been drowned, and there is reason to fear that other lives have been sacrificed. The loss of property both in the city, in the suburbs, and in the country, can scarcely be estimated, and there are many very painful cases of hardship in which men and women have lost their little all. A good idea of the nature and extent of the calamity may be formed from the accounts appended, but a telegraphic communication with many places is still interrupted, there is reason to fear that much remains to be reported from the country. Apart from river-side pro- perty which is dealt with elsewhere, the damage done in North Brisbane is very much less than might have been expected. Some of the yards in Albert-street are flooded, and in other parts of the city the water, being backed up from choked drains, has caused some trouble. Wharf- street has sustained some damage through the subsidence of a tower, and Burnett-lane and Charlotte-street, near the Union Club, have been similarly injured. In South Brisbane, Glenelg and Boundary streets have been damaged, the latter, along the line of the new sewers, being in a dangerous state. At the intersection of Boundary-street and Melbourne-street the road is almost im- passable. The Spring Hollow drain was found inadequate to carry off the immense volume of water which rushed into and overflowed it, pouring over it with great velocity, and flooding a considerable tract of land. In Wickham- street, Valley, the road has subsided over the newly-laid gas pipes, and a gang of men have been put on there to effect repairs. The rush of surface water has done more or less damage all over the city, but on the whole the loss from this cause is much below what might have been expected, considering the tremendous down- pour of rain. Of course, a great deal of property has been damaged through the flooding of cellars, but the extent of the loss in this direction is not yet known. The great anxiety, of course, wil be to know whether we have seen the end of this unprecedented storm, and there seems reason to hope such is the case. Since an early hour on Saturday morning there has been compara- tively little rain, and, though last night was hot and close, there were no appearances of more rain. Mr. Clement L. Wragge, the Govern- ment Meteorological Observer, informed us last evening that the barometer had been fairly steady since the previous day , and the oscilla- tions appear to have been chiefly those due to the diurnal range. The motions of the clouds yesterday afternoon indicated that the upper atmosphere was still much dis- turbed, while the motions of the lower clouds pointed to an area of low barometrical pressure about 800 miles west-north-west from Brisbane. It has been found from observations at the Brisbane Observatory that the storm has travelled south-west towards the New South Wales border, and it would seem to have doubled back towards the north-west, so that the system of low pressure referred to may pos- sibly be identified with the storm that has lately passed over Brisbane. In the absence of telegraphic communication it is impossible to give more definite information. FATALITIES. An unfortunate accident occurred at South Brisbane yesterday afternoon, by which a young man named Richard Thompson, 25 years of age, a painter, in the employment of Exton and Gough, lost his life. Thompson was living with his mother in Hope-street, and shortly after dinner he went with some friends to bathe in the flood-waters which had accu- mulated at the corner of Ernest and Merivale streets, where it was about 10ft deep. He took off all his clothes except his trousers, and dived off a fence. He was seen to come to the surface and swim a few strokes, when he sud- denly disappeared and did not rise again. His disappearance was noted and the police com- municated with, and Constable Rourke and others dived and tried to recover the body. Sergeant Burke also fetched a boat from the ferry-house and having launched it, used the drag belonging to the station. Notwithstand- ing that dragging and diving were going on at the same time, the body was not recovered for nearly half-an-hour and then all efforts to restore animation were without suc- cess. Sergeant Burke first and then Dr. Charles Kebbell, who was sent for, made use of the proper means for restoring the apparently drowned, but could not succeed in this in- stance. Thompson, who had not been long lin the colony, is said to have left a wife and child in England. James Challen, one of the crew of the barque Afton, was drowned in the Brisbane River yes- terday morning at about 10 o'clock through the swamping of a boat alongside the steamer Culgoa at Griffith's corner. It appears that a punt owned by Stevedore Brown broke away with the force of the flood yesterday and while passing the Afton, Brown asked that a crew might follow her. Six sailors manned a boat and overtook the punt at Norman Creek, where they secured her. The crew then attemptcd to pull home but could not make any further than the Culgoa, where they made fast and stopped all night. They attempted to return yesterday morning, and when four of the crew had got into the boat the current forced her under the paddles of the steamer, and she commenced to fill in the forepart. Challen being a good swimmer, jumped into the river, and was carried away and drowned. One of tho men climbed aboard the Culgoa, and the other two held fast to the boat which swamped and drifted away. Mr Purchase, the second mate of the Afton, and some of the Culgoa's crew immediately manned a boat, and succeeded in rescuing the two men opposite the residence of Captain Wright. ON THE RIVER There was a great fresh in the river on Saturday morning and during yesterday, caus- ing a current the velocity of which was estimated at quite six knots per hour. The surface of the water was covered with large quantities of debris and floating timber. All the steamers which were to have left the port on Saturday have been further postponed as owing to the inclemency of the weather, and the fact of the wharves being inundated, it has been impossible to discharge their freight much less to ship goods for export. Even could this have been done, and providing the weather outside had sufficiently calmed to enable them to put to sea with safety, it would have been impossible to have rounded Kangaroo Point without extreme danger of being forced on to the rocks at Petrie's Bight by the strong current. Although the tide was falling on Saturday morning the water in the river was still rising The water continued to rise until midday yesterday, when according to official records taken on the site of the graving dock, it reached 6 in. above the flood mark of 1864 Most of the town wharves were submerged on Saturday morning, and they were all under water yesterday. Consignees of cargo made frantic efforts to have their goods removed to places of safety. This would have affordedd employment to large numbers of the unemployed; but much difficulty was experienceded in getting men to work even at the high renumeration of 2s pet hour. On Saturday morning Messrs Parbury, Lamb, and Co. required the services of a number of men at South Brisbane, and seven came forward. They refused to work until their tram fares to and from the wharf were either paid them or guaranteed. Consider- ing the emergency of the case this wass consented to. To this we may add that yes- terday morning the storeman in charge of Messers. D.L. Brown and Co.'s bond urgently required some goods removed from the reach of the water. In response to this request for labourers several men, presumably from the ranks of the unemployed, came forward and asked what remuneration would he give. He replied 2s. per hour, but these then laughed derisively at such an offer, and when asked what they expected, replied 5s. per hour. Of course they were sent about their business, and the storeman had to fall back on D. L. Brown and Co.'s own employees. Eventually several outsiders consented to work at 2s. per hour. It was anticipated that at high water on Saturday night all of the wharves would be under a considerable depth of water. Those expectations were fully realised.

At about 8 o'clock, when pitch dark and in heavy rain, a Chinaman and his wife (European) were taken off from the Joss- house by boat and taken safely to a place of shelter. Another Chinaman who was in charge of the Joss-house remained at his post, refusing the offer of a seat in a boat. The police stopped traffic at the bridge, which it was suspected would not be able to stand the force of the current. Fortunately no heavy masses of debris were carried against i.t A small boat-shed near the Breakfast Creek shed was washed away. Many of the people living on the flat on the Albion side had to be taken fiom their houses in boats. On Satur- day morning, instead of abating, Breakfast Creek steadily rose. At Lutwyche the floods vvere very great, and Sub-inspector Durham, with four mounted troopers, did good service in rescuing the occupants of many houses which were completely flooded.

The stretch of flat country between the O'Connell Town Hill and the railway line along the course of Breakfast Creek is one sheet of water, and boats are still plying from place to place. The water having sub- sided somewhat, many are returning to their homes. Those who did not leave their houses were glad to get provisions, and it was quite a new experience to see the butcher and baker arrive by boat. From Stoneleigh House, looking away to the river, the best view of the flood anywhere near town may be obtained. The Sandgate train crawling carefully along as it were through a vast lake is the only break noticeable in the water from the Rosemount grounds to the river. The fall of the flood-water since Saturday morning has been about 3ft. There are about sixty houses more or less flooded, some being awash up to the roofs.

It was a two- roomed house in which the de- ceased lived, nndponionoighboui'ssfntethntns tho house was tornawaythctwoyoungmcnvverelnsf seen rushing out on to tho veranda as the housobrokoup. Cartwright managed to reach a ¡dace of safety, but his companion, Halloran, who could not swim, wasnover seen nlivo again. AVhcn picked up several hundred yards lower down tho stream yesterday forenoon tho body was hardly recognisable, nnd was removed to fho Government undertaker's establishment in George-street, the morguo being flooded. As regards tho othor life which it ia feared has he-en lost in this locality, a man named Austin Bom. who lives on the Tramway Estate, closo to tho orcok. stated thnt after ho and his family got »woy from the house ho went to some friends at Kangaroo Point to get a chungo of clothes for himself and family. This was on Fridny night. Ho was returning to the Tramway Estate at midnight accompanied by his brothor iu-lnvv, Hurry Porguson. When thoy had reached Kingfishers Creek the vain fell in torrent«,0 and in trying- to cross, Porguson was carried clown with tho cuiront. Ho lins not been heard of since, although Senior-eon stablo ITaimiiran, with two of the South Bris bano police, havo been patrolling fho shores, mid scniching in a punt for the missing mun. Born escaped nitor n hard struggle, mid he believes that his companion bus been drowned. Prom what can bo gathered, itbotrt eight houses hn»'o boen earned away from the Thompson Estate. Yesterday ¿vening the water still covered the Logan-road, near tho corner of the Old Clovohiud-remd, and pedestrians had to bo taken across by means of a boat. The surroundings of the lower part of tho estafo presented i pitiublo irpjioarunco. In ono or two instances the water hud almost coveied tho roofs of tho houses. Whole floors, from which tho walls had been torn, were usod as raffs hy unfortunate men trying to save fowls and other domestic tr'oastiios, and in somo cn^cs men were search- ing ulong the trees mid fences for clothes which hud contained their Inst-c.irncd money.

It was reported that the young girl Donnelly who was nearly drowned on the Thumjison Estafo on Friday night, lind died since, but, such is not tho case. ROSALIE AND MILTON. Tlio lower parts of theso suburbs havo suf- fered almost as much ns other localities simi- larly situated, though they have not hndlo bear tho ofl'eot of uny very sfrong curronts such as Breakfast Creek, Swan Hill, anti Thompson Estafo, which uro situated on largo watet courses, Tho omnibus traille wns sus- pended on Friday, and has not yet been re- sumed. Ono of Chalk's drivers, with a desiro to consult tho convenience of ])iissengers, tried to get through on Friday night, but narrowly escaped a serious accidont. Between Bays- water and Rosalie the w11 tor wns breast high, and two mon with horses and drays lind narrow escapes through going over the side of the road. In one caso the horso was nearly drowned, but about a cloven men turned out and managed to get it on to dry ground. Con- siderable inconvenience is experienced in getting into town, it being found necessary to follow the ridges round to tho railway line. On Sunday tho water cunio over tho road at tho foot of Milton Hill, in snito of tho fact that it was rnis'-d about -lit. at the tinto tho railway embankment subsided sumo months ago. Soveral houses on the Milton Estate vvero eptito flooded, and ejuito a niunber were surrounded by bcvcral feet of water. One of lho hardest cases in thal locality reported io tis was that of Mr. P. A. Levy, iii Doiiítlns-stroet, who was lately burnt out at Hieks's-buildings, George street. In spite of strenuous, offorts to snvo his property, Mr. Levy will be a considerable loser. ROCKY WATERHOLES. A correspondent sends tho following' notes : At Rocklea and Rocky Waterholes the storm was very severely felt, nil tho low-lying land' being submerged. Stable Swamp Creek rose very rapidly, and, having formed a connection with the lagoons in the neighbourhood, spread until it formed a vast sheet of water. Mr. Petrio's vineyard wns in some dan- ger on Friday afternoon, mid, in all probability, wits flooded out boforo night, full. Tho road in several places was com- pletely under water, and the houses on tlio flats were in such a condition that it Bcemed impossible for the inmates to remain in them diirinir the night. Tho house occupied by Mr. S. Moffatt, near, the Junction Hotel, suffered heavilv, tho rush of water under the house sap- ping the foundations of the chimney to such an extent that the chimney, stove, &c.; mid, in fact, the entire end of the kitchen fell out, exposing the interior to the full fury of the gale. At Hermitage tho water in tho creek roso so hifrh that tho tops of several fences »vero completely covered, and it seemed probable that the water had not reached its highest level. Along tho road tho storm hud produced some curious sights. In one place luiirht he seen thousands of those largo hairy ctitei pillars which always travel in largo bodies and apparently* clinging to each other. Tho rain had overtaken them and the whole army had been drowned, and the notion of the water had turned thom to a bluish-white colour. Large trees »vere uprooted in all directions, and the scene all around wa» one of desolation. The roads »vere almost im- passable in some places, and as the oninihiisea leaked liko sieves, compelling the passengeis to keep their umbrellas up while inside, the drive» was anything but an enjoyable one. Senior-constable Taylor, at Rocklea, re- ported, under yesterday's date, that he "ae flooded out of tho police station at that place, there being lSin of water on tho flooi, and had to clear out w ith

W. Griffith and Lady Griffith with their fellow passengers, Messrs. J. M. Purves, of Sydney, and J. L. Woolcock, were taken across in the trolly, and eventually reached the special train which had come from Toowoomba with the Commissioner for Railways. The Premier's party started again at 11.35 a.m., and arrived safely at Toowoomba. About 5 p.m. the Premier and party left for Stanthorpe, the train being in charge of Mr. W. A. Cross, En- gineer for Existing Lines, who at the special request of the Commissioner for Railways had undertaken the duty, and this enabled Mr. Evans to return to Brisbane, where he could more conveniently conduct the traffic arrange- ments Befoie leaving Laidley, the Pteimei personally expressed to Mi Evins his s tttsfic tion at the aninigements winch ho hud nude, not only foi his (the rieimei's) ovv n safety, but foi that of tho public geiieially, nuclei ex- ceedingly drfficult cucumstiucos AVlron the tr ira loft Laidley Mi Cioss was confident that ho w otild bo able to get Sii Samuel and lus pirty safely to the hoidci The tup would nlso orr rble Mi Cross to eximmo the Southern line On lo ivmg the station y aid it Toowoomba yestetdiy afternoon the blake »in of the Pieinter's speoul ttatn got off the hue, and a in ni who was nt the points wns sormrvvlnt soveiely injured Attora delny ot ibout i quutci of an houi the journey wns îcsumed, mil late list evenrng wovvoro mformod that the Premier had termed it Greenmount, near Dalrymple Creek Al tins lillico theio was a setiotis break, but ltw is hoped tltat the party would bo tiolhcd to Hen don, from winch pornt to AV ti wick the lino had been sufficiently repaiicd to enable a ti am to pass.

At Stanthorpe Mr. Bashford's ballast engine is ready to take the Premier on to Wallangara.
