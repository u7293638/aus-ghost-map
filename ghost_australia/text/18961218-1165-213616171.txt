Soon afterwards mutilated corpses of unfortunate slaves commenced to draft down the rivers with every freshet, and inland traders, arriving ait th,e scattered coast factories, told strange tales of men buried .alive among tB*? foundations of new houses or stockades.

Spear-heads and the brass-bound butts of the. trade guns rattled, and crashed among gleaming bayonets and brown Snider;-barrels, for the Yoruba's were fighting-desperately as they went, four of them bearing what appeared to be a shapeles heap of tattere^. karki uniform .upon a layer of woyen palm fibre, torn out from the side of some headman's house.
