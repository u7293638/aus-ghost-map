ClHAPTER XXII.--(Co.nrsoa,.) S" I can't believe it," cried Albert Clayton, with his usual generoity of sentiment and freedom from .suspicion. "It's impossible that yon appearance of shame and remorse ould be deceptive, or the hearty satisfaction with which he espoused our side. Bad as he was Walsh had not a sneaking, smooth, do eiring way with him. I have studied him a good deal, and I believe hlie is what he seems, whether he means well or ill. H1o .an't put a face or nct a part." "But how explain this sudden and unex pected flight?" asked William in a tone of incredulity. "Call it absence, not flight," returned Albert. "Inexplicable it is to us now, but I wait a little, and in all l'ikelihood he will ex- I r'aih it himself." His listeners shook their heads, 3Mrs. Walch herself was very doubtful, and most of the others feared the worst. William Simo coanselled the instant adoption of measures to frustrate any attack which might be made upon them. If Walsh was gone to tell all he had learned, and all that had happened him, there was no doubt that Lady Clayton and Chippe would with all speed try to remedy the misfortune. Still Alberetclung to his hope in the reality of Walsh's repentance, and would not admit that he thought he had turned traitor. And so the day passed, and he did not return. The morrow arrived, and still he came not. All the forenoon and all the afternoon they nervously watched and waited for him. At lark they were seated in the blue parlour, each more convinced than ever that he had netrayed them. Albert would not yet admit this, but he did not so readily and confidently sxpress his faith in him. As they sat conversing on the subject, the loor was quietly opened, and W'alsh glided in and sat down in the nearest chair he came to. A universal exclamation greeted his ap pearance, and all row and gazed upon him. He was very pale and seemed weaned and sxhausted. HIis chest heaved, as if it was weak and panting for breath, but there was a light of pleasure in his eye, and an expres sion of satisfaction on his features. "Oh, James, where hare you been?" asked his wife, as she hurriedly approached him. " You thought, of course, that I had de erted," he said, in a faint tone--" gone off to see Chippe with information against you all Ah, I .see you did. YWell, don't wonder at it, for I deerve to be suspected, and the secret way I went off looked traitorous." "We had all had thoughts of you except Albert," cried William Sime. "lie would never allow us to say that you had turned false, but was strong in the belief that you would return with an explanation." "Did you, sirt" exclaimed Walsh, his face fluhing with pleasure. "Were you so generous towards me-you who had most cause to distrust me ?" "Pooh," rejoined Albert, "I am pretty good at knowing what stuff a man is made of, and I saw that there was no humbug about you. When you were found to have gone, I said so, and I have not been deceived -that's all." "Bless you for your good opinion, sir," rejoined Walsh. in a grateful tone. " It is not tjhe first time you have said so, and your words, as much as anything, madi' me. re solet to do right. Well, 1 would hare told eou I was going, hat I thought if youi kmL my intentions you might try to hindhr me. Besdes, I did not know if I would sucreed,. and I don't like anybody to know wbhen I fail. Howerer, I haven't failed, for here's the paper." And as he spoke he drew from his bosom a folded document, and handed it to Nelly, who stood in front of him. " My father's will !" exclaimed Nelly, who recognised it in a moment. and stood with it in her hand, staring at Walh in astonish~ ment. The latter nodded, winked, and smiled in : satisfied way. "How in all the world did you get it ?" in quired Albert. "Went to Leeds for it," answered Walsh. "I couldn't rest till I got that paper, for I thought it would be some ema!l atonement to the girl for my char" in her bad usage, and I sterve to show you all it was no sham repent ance that I professed." i "Then you saw Chippi and demanded it of him." "Not likely," ret:urno Walsh. " I knew that was the worst way , ;go about it, so I 'did not attemp: it. 1'hiip, knos' iethiner about it being h.r., ut :h:::ks it quite s.af in his secret drawer.

" What was it to what you endured at my hands ?" returned Walsh, who was shaking and shivering with a new attack of fever. le strove hard to suppress all manifestation of sutfaring, but son his brain was again fteeteal. and once more the fever-fiend had imn in his power. Weak as he was, this re lapse shook and shattered him to a terrible degree. On the eighth day the doctor told him that the crisis was come, and shook his iead sadly in prospect of the issue. lie was then sleeping a restless, troubled sleep, not the calm, tranquil slumber he had formerly enjoyed, when the delirium left him. The dortor noticed this, and from it inferred the worst. About midnight Walsh awoke and knew them all. The doctor tookle hold of his arm and felt his pulse. It was whilal and ir regulair. I10 ordered soothing powders and rose to go. In the blue parlour he was surrounded by the anxiolus watchers, who asked his opinion of the stateof the patient. "Do not be afraid to tell us plainly, dnca or," sobbed the weeping wife. " Ouit of a kind feeling you may be temptedl to deeirve us, but it will be a mery to declare to us the truth." "I am glad you have put it to me thus," returned the doctor. " My painful duty is to inform you that he will not recolver." "God's will be done," groaned Mrs. Walhb. And she turned away and proceeded to the :hasmter of sieknese. Walsh himself suspected the truth, and put the queation bluntly to .1ary. She was oo true to his best interests to deceive him, and told what was the doctor's opinion. To every one the near and certain prospect >f death is solemn and awful, but however irmly and compoiaedly they may be able to ook at it, to most it is dreadful to contem plate, while to some it is utterly appalling. )f the latter number was Jim Walsh. The :ircumstlances in which the solemn prospect tad approached him, the position in which it had found him, made it doubly gloomy and terrible. But lately he had seolfed at the nereafter, and laughed at retribution. Ah, bnt.tbat was when he was strong and full of robust life-it was when he was in the full and unchecked tide of his wicked career. 'ow he was stricken down with weakness, ife with its concerns was ebbing away, and ne was brought face to face with the solemn problem. lie could not so scoff and sneer at now. The divine witness within him rose up to force its claims on his attention, and the leep instincts of his soul wotdd not cast aside that future to which it was so vitally and etsentially related. There are men in our day who, led on mainlh by scientifie research and discovery, bave gone far astray from the ancient land marks. The Bible, they say, is for the most part a collection of neautiful fairy tales, im mortality is a mere mnatter of opinion, God is oan eternal, notourslves," or "'a stre:m of tendency" that makes for righteousness, and life itself is a thing to be lived in righteous ness and self-denia certainly, but not as in the sight of a divinity that shapes our ends. It is, however, in'the day of sorrow, in the bourof death, that religion has bher triumphs; those times when earthly voices are stilled, when a heavenly power irreniotibly manifests itself to us. andl we feel that the great articles of our faith rest not upon dlubtful interpretationa of obscure pa,.agcs, btt upon the witness of our hearts and the expe:rience o our liras. The resutt triafly anal shauldri::.y ar riced at by Walsh was that thar- was a hereafter, and he was about ti m?e: it. We tay ahuddcringly; for if it mcanct anythit,.g ta him it meant rctribution. There he lay steeped in sin, eoveredl by a very mon:tain of transgressions, any single one ,,f which mult produce a fearful reckoning. No wondclr then that Jim Walsh was appalled wialin he knew that he had only a flw daya--;a rhaps only afew hours-to live. One comflort thro was for him, and he could not help clininrg to it. His last deed-that one in the duing aI which he had virtually sasrifierl his life was of an atoning kind--atonin,. that is, in a human sense; for it was the rendcirina a signal service to a girl hie ha:1 wrongl. lie was not a little satisfied at havinicg done it, even thbugh ithad lte him within the pilrtalls and shadow of death. But oh I hle hitterly felt that this availed not to arnn. far his wasted life-his locngeourse of vic, and crinme -and in his extremity he asked hiFs weeping wife for aid.
