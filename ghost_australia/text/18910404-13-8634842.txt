THE WINTER EXHIBITION AT BURLINGTON HOUSE. -II (From a London CORRESPONDE.NT.) No. 1. The comparatively small number of the pictures which adorn the walls of the Royal Academy galleries this season has been the subject of general comment and the decrease is regarded as a sign of the giving m' of the private collections whose fortunate owners have responded so generously to the demand that their art treasures should be permitted to gladden the eyes of the public during the past twenty one years I do not think this is a well founded motion, for if we had seen all the good pictures in all the art collections in the United Kingdom we should be well pleased to begin all over again, and I do not think the possessors of them would grudge the second loan, especially as a roulette couche would profit by it I believe e we have few or works of the old masters and deceased masters of the British school this winter, because a more than usually strict system of selection has been applied Certain I cannot record for a long time an e. ambition more pleasing and interesting, more varied and instructive, without being over whelming, than this one It is very rich in portions, and supplements in a useful way both the historical and the artistic interest of the Guelph Exhibition, for we have but to look at the Hogarth's, the Rev closes, the Game boroughs, the Ronnie) s, and the Hoppers here to have the social stage filled to our fancy with the contemporaries and companions of the men and women upon whose commemorated features we have gazed, in the New Gallery, in the classified groups of statesmen and generals, poets, artists, actors, and men of letters Between the two, a re- construction of the 18th century in some of its most characteristic features is not difficult to those who care about such an ever case of the fancy to whom portraits are not merely incidents or isolated objects, but links in the chain of history to which de lightful literary associations are also at tached This time the English portraits are the most interesting, because one's mind is full of the time to which they belong and the artists whose work they are Immediately on entering gallery No 1 we find one of Sir Joshua s masterpieces, his famous " Muster Bunbury," the picture of which Walpole wrote in his Academy catalogue of 1781-"A little boy, charming, he is the son of H. W Bunbury, Esq The Athenaeum says Unit Reynolds painted boys better than any other artist I don't think any picture of a boy could be better than this di the nine year old son of the we well-known caricaturist, and of Catharine Horneck, the " Little Comedy ' of Oliver Goldsmith The face is chubby bright, frank, living the attitude is natural The boy is seated, facing the spectator, and rests his hands on his thighs, as though con- sidering what he shall set about next-the quaint red coat, open at the neck, is plainly a familiar garment, not the dreadfully new attire in which modern painters depict their Sisters, suggesting the old lines "He looks like a squire of high decree When dressed in his Sunday clothes The original of this charming portrait (it is in very good preservation died at 20 " Mrs. Scott of Danesfield is also a fine specimen of Sir Joshua's work She. lives on the canvas before us, not a beautiful woman exactly but a charming one, with a serious, refined face, and her dress, and white, is a triumph of drapery, of the fashion of the time idealised There is a little dog in this picture which I am inclined to think Sir Joshua did not care about, it is a coven tion to creature, not like the proudly trotting little dog of the same land which seems to act as gentleman usher to Queen Charlotte in Gainsborough s great portrait, sure e) mg the spectator with an alert look full of expression, but perfectly well bred One seldom sees a He) holds that has not been engraved We are told by the Athenaeum that of a very beautiful portrait of Lady Anne Butler and her child no engraving exists I saw this work at the Grosvenor Gallery in 31 it was named merely " Mother and Child," and lent by the Duke of Westminster The reds in this picture are treated as skilfully as the whites in the portrait of Mrs Scott had) Anne, kneeling on one knee, holds the child, who is seated on a pedestal, and gleefully) clutches a long blast of the proud mother s hair Her dress is red, and the background of curtain is red also , the harmony is delightful In gallery No 3 we find the famous portrait of Miss Kennedy, and thereby hangs a tale other than artistic, and so curious that I venture to tell it here, premising that Reynolds wrote the following to the gentleman who gave him the commission for the courtesans portrait (an ancestor of Sir Edward Bunbury, who now owns it) in 1770 -" I little finished the face very much to my own satisfaction It has more grace and dignity than anything I have ever done, and it is the best coloured ' I agree with the Athenaeum that hardness and haughtinebB are more evident to the observer in the face than grace and dignity, but with the artist that the colouring is admirable But to the story ' Poll) Kennedy" was of Irish Scotch origin Two of her brothers, said to have been tavern waiters, having killed one John Rigby, a watchman, in a drunken brawl upon M Westminster bridge, were condemned to death 'their sister made use of the patrons her position and beauty insured, and notwithstanding the opposition of the respectable part of society (including the city M P s and the Bill of Rights people a formidable conjunction backed by ' IiinuiB and Horne 1 ooke), succeeded in obtaining first a respite for both of them, then for one of the murderers, a commutation of his sentence he was twice ordered for execution to transportation for life to the plantations, and final he was transported The other man was condemned to be transported for 14 years, but he was ultimately pardoned Bigb) s widow was bought off with £100 and did not appear at the trial Miss Kennedy) sat to Reynolds in 1776 and 1779, i e, while the fate of her brothers was in suspense, and Mr Tom Taylor, in his Life of Sir J Reynolds accounted for " the veiled look of pain he recognised in the features by the state of her mind at the time. An important element in the secret history of this affray is that ruffians of a much higher rank than her brothers were inculpated Those who care to learn more of the matter may consult 2 Ac Selwyn Correspondence, Walpole's Memoirs of Geo) ge III, and " Timms to the Public Advertiser, May 28 1770, where he condemned " the odious abuse and prostitution of the prerogative at home, and added the mercy of a chaste and pious prince extended cheerfully to a wilful murderer because that murderer is the brother of a common prostitute, would, I think, at any othertimohaveexciteduniversal indignation ' Reynolds was so proud of this portrait (and indeed, its only fault is us subject) that he got thomas Watson to engrave it. It is in teresting to Know that 70 guineas with the sum he was paid for it air Joshua's portrait of Miss Ilorueok (afterwards Mrs Own) is interesting because this fair lady was Goldsmith's " Jes sandy Bride, and a ray from his aureole rests upon it, but it was printed four years before Goldsmith's A trees were written and it does not convey much beauty to an mind It is unfinished, and very much out of repair Reynolds also painted the four Horneck sisters in a group, which is now at Barton, SirE Bunbury s place "It was she (Mrs Gw>n) who had the coffin of Goldsmith opened, Mr Stephens tells us, " and took from it a lock of his hair, which she kept till her death Where is it now-" Mrs Gi«)ii died in 1840, aged 84 one of the last survivors of Sir Joshua's sitters Koppners portrait of Miss Horneck is far superior to the Ki colds It is very, lovely and return it Jib tins the Jcssiim) Bride is seated under a tree, her arms are folded on her lap her i elegant figure is gently inclined

Charles Tennant is the owner of this beautiful picture, which is in perfect preservation The large picture known as "the young fortune-tellers' is a beautiful work, both as portrait painting and as a " fancy piece ' It would interest the spectator to without reference to the persons per tray ed, by its charming design In a land scape stand two life size figures, a boy ina Vandyck dress, a girl in

Spencer Churchill, and his sister, Lady Charlotte, children of the 4th Duke of Marlborough, and we find the two again in the large picture known as The Marlborough family) " "'The Young Fortune tellers was bought in 1885, from the present Duke of Marlborough, by Sir Charles 'Tennant, at a fabulous price Lord Henry died at 25 years of age , Lady Charlotte married Dr Nares, Regius professor of

exhibition has not a Gainsborough quite equal to the portraits of Queen Charlotte and the Duchess of Cumberland, which are gems of great price in the Guelph collection, that delightful artist is well to the fort, both in land scape and portraits Sir Charles 'Tennant lends the famous " Miss Hippesley," which shows Gainsborough at his best in drawing (this I am often told was a v« weak point with
