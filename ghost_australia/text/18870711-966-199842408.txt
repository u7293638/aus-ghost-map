THE CRADOCK GHOST. TO THE EDITOR, Sirâ€”Will you allow me space to correct Mr. Jones's statement in reference to the smelling-salts or hartshorn that he used pretty freely instead of his thumb and knife When he used the thermometer it was dipped in the hartshorn. I am prepared to prove that the raps did come when the phosphoius was on the child's hands. At the same time Mr. Jones asked a question in French and was answered correctly, the child knowing nothing about the language. On that terrible occation the fingernails were used pretty freely at pinching, but it failed to wake her, although the next day blick marks were to be seen. Let Mr. Jones rap his knuckles on lampblack and see if it produces the same effect as it did on the little girl's. There is great difference between rapping on it and rubbing it on. Mr. Jonc-s did not state what be had in his hand when he slid it under the clotbes. As it was a very late hour when the servant girl went to bed the raps were all over. As for the rapping when Sissy's brother was in bed with her, Mr. Jones had not the nerve to lie down with her. His letter is composed of untruths, although he found hinseif completely mastered and is ashamed to own the truth. I am, Sir, &c; , A. SCHULTZE, Uroonda,July 5. Father of the shild,
