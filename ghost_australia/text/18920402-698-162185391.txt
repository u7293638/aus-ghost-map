Getting Out of Debt. My outfitter called ou me, humble and meek, Saying, ' Bill, oh ! pay bill, oh ! pay bill, oh !' I cursed soito voce, then murmured ' Next week I'll pay bill, oh ! pay bill, oh ! pay bill, oh !' , But scarce had he vanished when up to the door j Came the baker, the man from the grocery store, And the butcher, and twenty stern creditors more, Crying ' Bill, oh ! pay bill, oh ! pay bill, oh ! I was almost deprived both of reason and speech By their ' Bill, oh ! pay bill, oh ! pay bill, oh !' But* ' Next week, with 'delight,' I responded to each, i ' I'll pay bill, oh ! pay bill, oh ! pay bill, oh!' And each creditor shook his clenched fist at my head, And declared he would cause me to wish myself dead If perchance I should fail, ere a se'nnight had fled, To pay bill, oh ! pay bill, oh ! pay bill, oh ! Next week they'll come round to my house for their Crying ' Bill, oh ! pay bill, oh ! pay bill, oh !' But my ghost overhead will laugh loud at each ass Braying ' Bill, oh ! pay bill, oh ! pay bill, oh !' For I've swrorn that to-night, for a row and a blow, I'll go out in a boat, and ere morning — ho ! ho ! — Where the duns cannot come I shall calmly lie low, 'Neath the billow ! sea billow ! sea billow J — ^un' Little Charlie was complaining for two or three days. ' Mamma,' he said, I guess I've got that new — what do you call it?' 'Influenza?' sug gested mamma ; ' oh, no, dear. It is simply lassi tude.' ' Lassitude ! ' cried Charlie. ' Why, a boy can't have that, can he ? More likely I've got i laddie tude ! '
