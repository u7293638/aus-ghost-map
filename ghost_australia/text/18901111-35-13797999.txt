Although a trifle hot the day was a vory favourable one, and the rays of the sun were largely atoned for by tee pleasant breeze upon the water. In the morning there , was scarcely sufficient wind to suit the white-winged fleet ; but in the afternoon there was a fresher breeze, ona some vary pie»y uaisaea were «iineseea a« «ne boats swept post th« flagship under ? cloud Of canvas. 'Ihe water, too, was very favourable for the rowing contest«, and in the ovsute a lonco amount of interest was centred. The bright sunshine of a typlool Aus- tralian summer day, the clear blue sky flecked only with a few fleecy clouds, the gaily-, coloured bunting flying from every vosoel in the boy end from every point around the shores, the steamers, rowing boats, and sailing craft crossing and re-crossing in confusing intricacy, and the crowds of spectator« who were to be seen on eveiy kind of a vessel from a luxurious steam yacht down to au old barge praised into oervioe for the occasion, made the «cene a gay, an interesting, and a varied «ne. Although there was a large number of people afloat, the vacant fore- shore around Whitehorse Point was thronged with some thousinds of people, and as there was a large percentage of lidies and children, the bright colours of their holi- day costume added to the general effect of the picture. The A. U. S. N. Company's steamar Barcoo, Captain James Banks, was placed at the disposal of the com- mittee as flagship, and no trouble was spared in making everything sa comfortable sa possible for the specta- tors. She was gaily dressed with flags from atom to «tern, and her spacious decks and cabins filled to a comfortable extent. Among those on boord wara the members for the district and most of the prominent residents of Balmain. After tbe luncheon o presentation wo« made to Captain Banks by Mr. Clukb, M.L.A., mayor of the borough and president of ins regatta committee. Tho company assembled on the poop, and Mr. Clubb, in presenting the skipper with a souvonir of tho occisión in the shape of a set of carvers und . fish alice, thanked him for the assistance he and his company had afforded in the use of the vessel. 'He also referred to the suc- cess of tho day and the long period in whioh they hod maintained their annual regatta. Asa matter of fact Ihe regatta was initiated on November 13, 1849, and has been held annually ever since. During the post IO or 16 years the fixture wa« altered from St. Andrew'« Day to the present holiday. Captain Banks, in accepting the memento, mode a few appropriate remark«, and waa loudly cheered. The Alliance Bend added much to tbe pleasure of the day by performing a good programme on tho flagship, 'lhere were no serious accident«, but several of the small soiling craft turned turtle, although tho wind wa« steady. The whole 21 events on the pro- gramme were well contested, and in all cases the course finished at the flsgship, so that the interest was well sustained. A gratifying feature of tho regatta was the punctuality observed in the atorting of the varisu* events, the result being that the/ were finished within a reasonable time. The rowing races exoited the usual healthy rivalry between the different olubs. In tho Maiden Fours the Leichhardt crew put down representatives from the East Sydney, Mercantile, Parramatta, and Sydney Rowing Club«. In the single sculls race the East Sydney man beat a representative of the Leichhardt club and three representatives from the formidable Mercantile«. In the junior- senior fours the East Sidneys were again victorious, after a well rowod race «gainst a Balmain four ; but in the eenior double sculls the Mercantile men won tim first ruo of the day for their club. There wore also good contesta in the all-comers' light skiff race, the manual labour amateur four-oarod race, and the race for coloured, men in light skiffs. In one or two instance* the racing yachts and the rawing races interfered with each other, but under the circumstance* this was difficult to avoid. The morning wa« anything but propitious for Miling, owing to tha wind being flaky, and at time« a clock calm. In the Ant couple of raoes the boots started with aquorasalls set before a light E.N.E. breeze, which carried them to the flagship, off when a belt of calm was met with, and a hundred yards further on ths wind wa« light from W.S.W.; in fact, the true breezer did not raak« til! about midday, when it blew moderately from N.E. till the finish of the race«. For th« yacht nee there were only two starters-Assegai and Iolanthe-and after a very good contest,' especially over the first portion of the course, when'they passed the flagship together the first time round. The latter, howtver, proved too fleet for her vivs), which «be beat by 2 minutes 42 seconds. Is the race for 2J-roters Jenny Wren bad it all her own way from the start to the flniah, The 16 fooier Our Own was «g*in successful in har closo, making her third win this «««son, lr*x «nd Craigielea added another win to their already numerous list in the races for oil boat« «nd hind boot« respectively. lb« following «re the result« «f the various event« : Maiden Fonra in string-test tin : amateur«.

Shortly after tho appointed time for ?tarling (12 p.m ), the flag In the «farter's beat wa« dropped a« a signal to be off, the wind at the time being right from E N.B., and tho tide about slack. Iolanthe wa« the lint away, the Aaiegnt following «orno IS «eoonda later. The Volunteer «nd Sao not baring put in an appeeranco left the two «bore mentioned to fight out tho contest. Suth recht» crossed the line on the port tack, but inch by inch the Areegal drew up on her rival, and when abreast «t Ball's Head had overhauled her. The former having lost tho wind somewhat, had t* give premier place to her opponent. On toe work down to shark Island tbelr respective position« were about the «ame, with the exception that the ABsegai «lightly extended her lead round the Uland, which »he did with about tw« minute» in hand. Jib topsails and ballon foreaaiU were hen set for the lead back to the flagihlp, a very goad race ensuing while off the wind. Iolanthe was, however, slowly but »unir over- hauling her rival, and before reaching the flagihlp had drawn up lcrel with her, and the] bath passed tho »hip at 1,45 p nu, the Iolanthe having the weather posltlan, which by good management enabled her to cut th« Assegai at the stern of the flagship; at this time the tide had turned and waa now flowing, short stretches were the order to cut it, until opening out Langnos« Point, olf where the yacht« «ought the northern «boro which wa« worked stretch for stretch by both until opening ont Bradley'« Head. The western «hore was then in demand for the rest of the beat, to get out of the Udo a« much aa possible ; th« Iolanthe «lowly but surely increasing her posi- tion, and at Shark Island squared away with about two minutes in hand. Un tho run to Shark Island the leading rächt «et a spinnaker-square, while the Assegai hoisted a balloon topsail, the loss of a spinnaker wa« felt by her. The Iolanthe adding second« to her lead with every puff of wind, which had increased somewhat, the island being roundel by the Iolanthe with a substantial lead; her spin- naker was then taken in preparatory to the jibe, «nd a Jib topsail and balloon foressll replaced it, the Assegai following suit. On the lead from here up to the flagship tbe lolantbo .lightly increased her positiou. passing the wlnnlng-p.tt at 4h. 0m. SO«., Assegai following at 4h. 4m. »le. Thus the lolantbc »coures the first prise, beating the Assegai by 1 minute« and 42 seconds outside her allowance of 1 minute. The yachts were in charge of Mr. Wilsou and Captain Dud- ley respectively.

With a light breer» from E.rs.K. and the last of the ebb tldo the «tarier despatched this fleet of little yacht«. Jenny Wren carried a iack-yerd topsail and jib topsail, and Astra« a jlbhearier and »panker «ct square : Louelle set a «plnnaker on the bowsprit-end, while the Norna had a club-topsail aloft, and also set a Jib topsail, for the lead to the flagship. Tho order crossing the Uno was-Jenny Wreo, Astrca, Louelle, and Norna ; before reaching the ship, however, the Norna had overhauled and verr toon passed the Louelle, which waa then la laat place. Tula, no doubt, was owing to her small spread ot cenvaa. I he loss of her topsalt, which was lett oshoro to enable her to rate at 1*7, proved a serious loss In the then light wind. The Jenny Wren, wbloh waa sailing very nicely, was widen- ing tho gap with every puff. The times rounding the flag ?hip were : Jenny Wren, at lib. 59m. 20»., Astre», at Uti. 4m. 35». ; Norna, at 12b. Ora. 25s. ; and the Louelle, at 12h. 8m. 20s. With the exception of the Jenny Wren which stood across to Greenwich, while on the work down tho barbour, Astrca and Norna, aa also Louelle, worked short beards until ab'e to olear the W.lverine. The tide, which w«. noaç the top, was not strong enough to affaot th. yacht« to any extent, therefore long stretches were th« order, tho Jenny Viren perceptibly learing the Aatre* behind, while the Norna treated the Nouelle similarly. 1 he position of the boats became very much extended br the time the lightship and tho Sow and Pigs were reached, the Jenny Wren squaring away with a lead of 12 minute« front Astrea, Norna following »li minutes later, with 13 minutos between her and the Louelle. For the run to Bradley'» Head «pinna ken were »et, the Louelle carrying a mwtheader. With th« increasing breeze these little resael» were making good time of it. and with the extra spread of oanra« tho hull« were scarcely discernible. At Bradley'a Head th« kite« wero taken In. 'Ike rest of the course to Longnose Point being a lead, jib topsail« and balloon foreaaiia were «et. The Norna in th« «tronger wind wa» holding her own witta the Astrea, but Jenny Wren «ppcarcd to bo increasing her position all through the rece, while the Lonello, notwithstanding her «maller sall area, waa doing very well : when off Longnose spinnakers were «et for the ran to the flagship, which waa paated br the Jenny .Wren 3b. 32m. 5«., th« Aitrea following at 2h. lim, 5s., the Norna at 2b. 46m. 44«., and the Louelle at 2h. 57m. 93« Jenny Wren, therefore, Meares the Ant prlxe, bealing Astrea by » minuter, which takes the second prize.
