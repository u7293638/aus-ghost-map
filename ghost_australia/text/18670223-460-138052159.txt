" I hoped P In me, he. merely saw a man who ' had been shut up within narrow limits all his J life/and who, being at last set free, had a newly-awakened interest in these great works.. To such purpose I spoke to him; but I am ' tat from sure,of the t^rms I used, for, besides that I am not happy in opening any oonver sation, there was something in the man that daunted'me. j He directed a most curious look towards the red light near the tunnel's mouth, and looked all about it, as if something were missing from it, and then looked at me. That light was part of his charge P Was it not? He answered in a low voice : "Don't you knew it is?" The monstrous thought came into my mind as I perused the fired eyes mid the saturnine face that this was a spirit, not a man. 1 have speculated sinoe, whether there may have been \- infection in his mind.

" I was doubtful," he returned, * whether I had seen ytn before." "Where?" 1 at. ««2bsref*» I said.

To change'that tignal,totrim those lights, and to turn this iron handle now and then, 1 was all he had to do under that head.

On both of those ocoasionshecame back to the Bre with the inexplicable air upon hitn which I had remarked, without being abbs to define, when we were so far asunder. Said I when I rose to leave him: " You almost make me think that I have met with a contented man." (I am afraid I must acknowledge that I said it to lead him on.) " I believe I used to be so," he rejoined, in the low voice in which, he had first spoken ;,. " but I am troubled, sir, I am troubled." j He would have recalled the words if he could. He had said them, however, and I took them, up quickly. ^ " With what ? What is your trouble ?" j " It iB very difficult to impart, sir. It is J very, very, difficult to speak of.

"And when yon come down to-morrow nighty don't call out! Let me ask you a parting question. What made you cry ' Halloa I Below there!' to night ?" " Heaven knows," said X. "I cried some thing to that effeet " Not to that effect, sir. Those were the very words. I know them well" " Admit those were the very words. I eaid them, no doubt, because I saw you below." 11 For no other reason P" "What otjierreason could I possibly hare!" "Yon had no feeling that they were oou veyed to yon in any supernatural way jp" •"No." He wished me good night, apd hftldup his light.

"Ab to an imaginary cry," said I, "do but listen for a moment to the wind in this unnatural valley while we speak so low, and to the wild harp it makes of the telegraph wires!" That was all very well, he returned, after we had sat listening for a while, and he ought to know something of the wind and the wires, he whoso often passed long winter nights there, alone and watching. But he would beg to remark that he had not finished. tasked his pardon, and he slowly added these words, touching my arm: "Within six hours after the Appearance, -and within tea hours the dead and wounded were brought along through the tunnel-over the eppt wherethe figure had stood.** ; "Adkagreeable shudder creptoverme,but I did ipy best agfiast it. 2t was art to be denied, I rejoined, that this was a remarkable coincidence, calculated deeply to impress his mind; But, it was unquestionable that re ! markable coincidences did continually occur, and they must be taken intoaocount in dealing with such a subject.
