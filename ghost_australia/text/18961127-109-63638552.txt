Myamyn. (FROM OUR OWN CORrESPONDENT.) November 26. Another of those pleasing social gather ings, which have almost become a neces sity at Myamyn as a means of raising the pastor's salary, was held in the Pri mi.ive Methodist Church on Saturday evening last, there being a large attend ance,.including visitors from i-ieywood and other places. The programme, as usual, was a long and varied one, a dialogue by so::.,: Heywood friends being given with much dramatic power and effect, the ghost scene being particuiarly impressive, while the whole gave one the impression that the church was being put to a use, that was never contem plated by its founders. It argues a de cided and distinct peculiarity of Primi tive Method;sm that allows its sacred edifices for purposes other than those of Divine worship, and more especially that scenic effects which alone ought to be long to the stage, are mnore or less cleverly contrived to catch and elicit the plaudits, cat-calls, applause, or whatever you choose to call the boisterous behav iour of the hack seats. Murmurs of dis sent are often times heard from the more respectable portion of the members, vet the desecration of the church is per mitted rather than an honest effort should be made to provide, or assist in provid ing; a public hall where all such exhibi tions of histrionic talent could be utilised without incurringthe displeasure of aoy one. The officials of the church 'are leaving themselies open to grave censure; while the pastor must know the.spirit of godliness is not promoted thereby; nor can either affect to be ignorant of the fact that Sabbath worshippers are incon venienced by the dirty state of the church after Saturday night's performances. I do not write in a carping spirit, but rather to encourage the people to obtain a'suit able building, enjoy their pleasures, and maintain the dignity and respect of 'the church. " . chaste as the icicle, That's cnrded by the frost from purest snow, And hangs os Dian's temple."
