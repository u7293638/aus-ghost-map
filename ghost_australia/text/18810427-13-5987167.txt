It belonged to the presbytery to Bay, judicially, whether ¿juiBouxidneBa waa actually there and to what extent it waa there 1 or the committee to Boy tins would be to usurp the undelegited poner of the preabytery This accounted for the nae of the word " appear on the face of the report Moreover, the committee had al waya before them the fact that the article was written by a brother minister who had taken the same vows of fidelity to the standard as themselves, and tifie fact influenced them m \ bis opinion, more than they ought in faithful mbs to the trust committed to them by the prcsbjtery to have allowed themselves to bo 8 influenced The result was a degree of hesi ! tation to put upon the language emplo) ed the r construction to which tho natural or com monly received meaning of the worda and the drift of tho thought led them, and a dis Í position to feel that thero might poaaibly bo another meaning consistent with the writers position is a minister of their church which he himself could mako plain, though it did not appear on the surface But to return to the consideration of the dnty cntruated to the committee It waa to r examine the article with reference to its soundness What waB the meaning of this «ord soundness' It was a scriptural i term furnished by the pastoral epistles Ita \ Bipnificanco might be learned from Titua i 0 it-" Holding fast the faithful word according #T> the teaching in order that ho may bo able with the Bound doctrine both to exhort and { lo reprove the gainsayers ' From these j wordB it appeared that the sound or healthy 1 doctrine "vas that faithful or trustworthy word which was according to the teaching imparted by the apostles, and which consti- tuted, by way of eminence, the churchs I normal instruction and rule in spiritual things Doctrine was sound, then, which waa in accordance with Scripture So much ¡ of the teaching of Scripture as they consi deted necessary to set forth aa a basis of union among themselves as a church, and na i a declaration of their faith, they had formu I »ted in their subordinate standards, the Con fesBion of faith, andLargerand Shorter Cate jhiBmB, which they held as an exhibition of the Benae in which they understood Scripture These documents were the standards to which by their constitution they must bring all 1 teaching to bo tried in the first instance Unsoundness, moreover, was a question of degree When an utterance, oral or written, contrndicted in categorical statements ana expKBB terms, the doctrine of the Cou leBBipn on so vital a point as that oí the Atonement, there could be no question that it was unsound, palpably ' and offensively corrupt It was, then, avowed heresy of the most pronounced type But, short of explicit heresy, there might be Implicit heresy-doctrine which subverted Christian truth-but was not systematically k aet forth in express terms and explicit deda rations And, short of actual heresy, explicit or implicit, there might be various degrees of unsoundness, which it was competent for i 5» foorcli to take cognizanco of and oeai with as circumatances might require ; ¿5fie miPut be the omission of important trnths, the mistatement of truths expressed , Wo distortion of a truth, or the giving of such prominence to one truth aa tended to dislocate me B) stem of doctrine, and push some other important truth out of view, as this very i "llc'e did vith respect to union with Christ Î?jT »ptu.<6 of reconciliation, putting it ' \- En "° is to overlay and obscure the £lympottat,ttrath,tliat there must be Ä ',°v.nrí?r Bm befote tliere could be tynon Mth christ for reconciliation This, comm,, "v vhci »"»iict remitted to the commit ^id it waB evident that the duty .* »hen ,t r" 'yu\"\ musu not exhausted ffldth""«f tUdil nowheK> >» the articla s LSÄUrpu" systématiser! statement M thpPnnf^ws orcor"">dict the doctrine laaernrÄ8101 ',3, categorical statements KbT,'?1 Th? former o£ theBe Btttt° Ittat ti« J ?' e,WlTOlent to a declaration BWT, Ie Wlter dld not express, indicate, or Klwtad uSm V1.T m tQe »rucio, it merd? m Ähat he dld not 8tate 'hem explicitly äÄrwai noto declaration that there ïîth«?Ti*T** ." the article It did not JfiA'T'tha art,olB T8 not o«t BdWnoÏÏJ thÄe «cognised standards.

Tho question of intention waa not raised at this stage AU that the finding committed the presbytery to was a declaration that the art clo was in itself fitted to produce this result, that the nataral effect of ita teaching was to depreciate and obscuro the doctrine in question Ulna adaptation, designed or fortuitous, to the end indicated was, how- ever, BBBerted to ho in, or to be contributed to, bv two tilinga-the method of treatment adopted and tho negative character of tho teaching By the method o£ treatmont adopten he meint, first, the manner in which the subject waa introduced and presented to the reader The subject of the article waa the Atonement 'I hat word had a definite meaning in theology. It denoted, as uaed by tho great majority of orthodox divines, "the satiafac tion of divine juatice for the ama of man by tile substituted penal Buffering of tho Son of God ' Socinian writers, and writers of So cinian proclivities, used the term ob denoting no more than tho reunion, however effected This idea waa educed by a auppoaed chango at Bomo time of tho word "one ' into an abatract verbal noun, "one mont, which waa further intensified by prefix mg the preposition "at, bo that tho Btate of reconciliation became "at-one ment It waa in thia aenao that the word waa defined m the opening aentence of the articlo, as de noting airaply tho reconciliation No place was found for tile *iX«cr/»ov-tho propitiation 'I lie attention waa fixed entirely on the re suiting reconciliation, and that again waa, as far aa appeared, attenuated into the Bubjec tno chango m mans aentimenta towards God, no account being tilten of what was the principal if not the only thing denoted by the term k i, presumably the Now testa mont authority for the term reconciliation -to wit, the changed relation into which | God, by Ilia divine act of redemption, had brought man, bo that man waa no longer tho object of God a wrath, and God waa no longer mans adversary It was, of courae, quito open to the writer to take tho word in tina reatneted aenae, and to confine the e\poai tion to the subjective change, or whatever clae, on the part 01 man, ho regarded aa the reconciliation, but it ought to bo borne in mind by his readers that, professing to treat of reconciliation, ho did not treat of the whole or of tho principal part of it, and that the method adopted was fitted to leave the impression that that which occupied the principal place in our doctrine, the propitiation, waa of little or no importance But what he meant pnnci pall} by the method of treatment waa tho lino followed m the historic sketch presented m the article Tho hiBtonc waa, of courae, a perfectly legitimate mode of treatment It was not necessary to aBSume that m using hiBtory as the propaganda of a Behool or party men were consciously dishonest They read it through the Bpectacles of precon ception 'I hey saw only what made for their own prepossessions They wrote what they saw, and then history told tho Btory they wished to bo told. Of thia cha meter waB the history of the article bofore them It waB history with a bias, and its maa waa against the doctrine of the Atone ment contained in their standards In com bination with the negations of the article negations consisting mainly in omissions and understatements-it depreciated that doe trine, and obscured its leading dogma AU the value which attached to the doctrine of the Confession on this or any other aubject lay in itB acriptural authority If it waa derived from Bcripture, held aa the teaching of scripture, and submitted to the judgment of scripture, it waa binding on their conaciences, if not it waa a usurper and ought to bo cast out Did this historic sketch trace tho doctrino up to ita aource in divine revelation ' No, it treated it aa in ita origin and development a matter of human opinion Its root and essence, they were told, lay in the religious consciousness of the Christian Church , supernatural divine revelation and the miraculous facta of the (,0Bpel not being in any way referred to aa ac counting for ita origin The "root and eaeence of doctrine lay in the reli gious consciouBneea of the Christian Church waa language which they could under- stand from the lips of Schhermacher, who held that the religious consciouBneaas was the Bource of rehgioua truth, but what did it mean on the lips of a Presbyterian minister holding tho Westminster standards ' Did not these standards maintain that while the light of nature in man and tho works of God declared plainly that there waa a God, Hia word and spirit only sufficiently and effect- ually revealed Him unto men for their aal vation, and that the supreme jndgeby which all controveraiea of religion were to be de termmed and all decrees of councils, opinions of ancient writers, and doctrines of men and private spirits were to be examined, could bo no other than the Holy Spirit apeakmg in the Scnpturea' Where waa the root of the doe trine of Atonement but in the mind of God -that waa to say, in the revelation of God ' True, the rcligioua consciousness of the Christian Church craved an atonement, tnd the atonement revealed m Scripture was adapted to the religious consciousness, and the religious consciousness appreciated and appropriated it, but that waB altogether dif ferent from Baying that its root and essence lie in the Chriatian consciousness Ile granted also that that which was formulated in their creeds as doctrine waB not imme diately that which waa taught in bcripture, but that winch the regenerated man, enlightened by tho Holy Spirit or the church-the Bociety of regenerated men enlightened by the Spirit-behoved the ScriptureB taught them. Doctrine was the result of the Christian a effort to make clear to himself what he held in his consciouancas as the trnth of God That which is formu lated waa a content of Christian conscious ness, but it waa formulated as the belief of what Scripture taught- tho aenao in which the Christian understood Scripture It might be contended that thia was all the article meant, but if so, it was a pity that it waa not made clear It could have been made clear by a simple reference to Divine revelation and the miraculous facts of the goBpel aa tho source of doctrine But there waB no such reference, though it ought to have been present to the mmd of the writer that in using auch a term as " the religious conaciousneBB '-a term to which a class of ideas not in harmony with the Con feBBion bad attached themselves, he waa m danger of being misunderstood if he did not make his meaning clear But, again, it might be contended that the article did acknowledge the divine source of the doe trine in ita referencea to the Apostles Paul and Peter, James and John, and the BjnoptiBtB True, it did refer to these, but not as inspired men authoritatively declaring tho mind of God, only aa men 8peakingfrom their own Chriatian conaciouBness, the leaders of a series of writers who had treated of tina subject-men who might have had a clearer perception of the doctrine than their Bucceasora, but who were regarded aa on pre cisely the aame level with them aa to authority They were not distinguished from them aa the lively oracles of the living God There waa no acknowledgment of super mtural divine revelation and inspiration in tho case of Paul and John any more than than there waa in the caae of Maurice or Schhermacher The Pauline type of doctrine waB accounted for by the ldioayncraciea, history, and circumstances of the man Paul, just as the Lutheran typo was accounted for by the ldioayncraciea, hia tory, and circumstances of the man Martin Luther Tho nearest approach to an acknowledgment of a distinction be tween tho New Testament writers and their Bucceasora waa to be found on page 772 of the article, referred to in No IG of the report-" We cannot all think in exactly the eame way even ob John, or James, or Paul ' But this scarcely amounted to an aoknow ledgment of their authority as inspired men for whatever might be the force of the word "even," it did not imply that John, and JameB, and Paul were inspired men, to whose authority they were to bow, but on the other hand, the sentence, aa a wholo, virtually conceded a liberty to differ from them Surely thia depreciated not only the doctrine of the Atonement, but theauthorityof Scripture also It might be said, however, that this waB ou the very face of it a history of the doctrine as a doctrine of theit creeda and that aa auch ita outward development and manifestation as a fact of human history was all that fell under review, and that consequently, the question of its divine origin and authority did not fall to be considered To that, ho (Mr Macdonald) de murred They could not account with his- torical fidelity for ita outward development and manifestation without taking its divine origin and authority into account The article asserted that they could not fully understand the doctrine unless they were fa miliar with the history of the men who had written upon it. It waa of far more im- portance to the understanding of the doctrine that they knew Christ Jesus and Him cruci- fied, in whom the reconciliation waa em- bodied, and that they recognised Qod'a autho- rity in the gospel call beseeching them to be reconciled to Bim. A history of the doctrine which left out of account the divine authority and the supernatural facts in which tho doc- trine waB objectively embodied waa no true history. The heart of the whole matter waa left out of it. It was a cold, lifeless form, without the epint Again, the article depre- ciated the general doctrine, and in particular obscured the essential relation of the death of Christ to reconciliation by the account which it gave of the teaching of the apostles This whole section waa exceedingly eng gestive of I erdinand Christian Baar and Ina laboura to establish doctrinal differences bo tween the different apoBtles Referring to No 0 of the report, it would be observed that while the distinctive forms of the doctrine were attributed to Paul and John, a less distinct and somewhat different doctrine was attributed to the first three gospels, the Apo calypso and the epietlea of James and Peter Were there, then, not only different forms of the doctrine of Atonement, but different doctrines of Atonement in Scripture ? Was ' Scripturo inconsistent with itself » Did it say one thing by the mouth of Paul and another thinj, by the mouth of Poter? It waa the teaching of their atandarda that thero waa but one doctrine of the Atonement m the word of God, a self consistent doctrine which presented the same leading features and characteristics in gospel and epistle, in hortatory address and didactic treatise, in tho writings of a John or a Matthew, a Peter or a Paul That doctrine was the Catholic doe trine of the church, for " the Bible, the Bible alone, was the religion of Protestants, and that doctrine their church had formu- lated in her standards. To assert, then, that there were differences of doctrine in Scripture was certainly to depreciate the doctrine of that Confession which presented itself as a true representation of the one doctrine of Scripture But it might be contended that " doctrine" was used in the passage referred to " loosely," and generally as meaning no more than ' teaching," and as really equivalent to "form" in the preceding sentence. Such an explanation might be accepted but for two things —First -The writing in this article though vague indefinite, and mystical, was not loose It bore evidence of great care It was the production of one who was accus tomed to weigh his words and study how most effectively to put his points Second, it was not in this essay alone that the difference referred to had been asserted They knew how the apostolic writings had been pitted against each other by tho Tubingen School, and it was matter of notoriety that the parable of the prodigal son, and other passâges in the synoptic gospels, were held by some to teach recon- cihation without a mediator by repentance It was curious that if this was the slip of one writing currente cálamo, it should be a slip into published views of which he could not be regarded as ignorant But reverting to the distinction of form between the Pauline and the Johannine doctrine (No 10 of the report), was it not exaggerated and misstated ? There was no question that tho writings of these two apostles were characterised by striking differences of thought and style for the two men were very different in mental constitu tion and habit, and each thought and wrote naturally according to his peculiar mental constitution and habits of thought but though naturally none the less under inspira tion let with their striking dissimilarities of style, and the different standpoints from which they might be assumed to have written, their teaching with regard to the Atonement was the same, not only in essence and spirit as the article allowed, but also, contrary to what it endeavoured to maintain, to a large extent in form How waa it that in the representation of the Jobanmne teaching no place waa given to the propitiation which the 1 ather provided aa the means of rev ealing hiB love, and on the ground of which Chnet proceeded in leading them out of darkness into the privileges of divine Sonebip? Did not that con ception enter into the essence, and give character to the form of Johns teaching? Were there any one of the Apostles who gave greater prominence than John, the apostle of love, to propitia tion, which took for granted Divine wrath againat am' Was there any one of them who placed in closer connexion the Divine sonship of Christ and Ula sacrifice for Bin ? And yet no placo is found for this m tho statement of His doctrine Ignoring it, the article could bo present the two forma aa virtually to make them two distinct doctrines -the one attributing reconciliation to Chriat as the end of the lan , the other as the de velopment of a philosophic thought (what ever that might mean) the revelation m human form of eternal life Had ita own place been given it it would be evident that the teaching of John and the teaching of Paul were not only essentially, but formally, one in reapect of the constituting clement of the Atonement, Paul Baying, ' Being justified feeling by hu grace through the redemption that is m Christ Jesus, whom God bath set forth to be a propitiation through faith in Ilia blood, John Baying, ' In thia waa mam feated the love of God toward us, because God sent forth His only begotten Son into the world that wo might live through Him Herein is love, not that we loved God but that He loved us, and Bent His Son to be the propitiation for our Bi-a Now, what waa the practical influence of this omiasion'' It misrepresents Scripture It was fitted to give the impression that thero waa no definite doctrine in Scripture as to how God reconciled men to Himself in ChriBt, and therefore that wo might speculato about that aa wo please, follow- ing Paul s representation, or Johns supposed assumed representation, or Peters or an independent course of our own, provided only we held that union with Christin someBense is necessary Sir, the Scriptures are as dia tinct, as emphatic, aa consistently uniform in declaring that the propitiation of Cbnat is the effluent cauae of reconciliation as they are in declaring that union with Chriat ia the sphere of reconciliation It waa in union with llim whom God made to be Bin for us, though he knew no sin, that we might be made the] righteousness of God in bim, that we are reconciled-union with the crucified, naen ascended Chr st-union with Christ, sb invested with all the merits of his death Propitiation waa the necessary antecedent to reconciliation m union with Chriat As the Son of God He had life in Himself, aa the lamb that was Blain He had life in himself for Binnera John was aa emphatic in de daring thia aa Paul or Peter He repreaented indeed the eternal life aa manifested to buy back to men that life which lay in fellowship with God, but he showed also how the foun tain of death whichlay in sin muat be removed before thia could be effected, and how the propitiation entered ia aa the provision which restored men to fellowship with Him who is life nnd light na well as love Could this omiBBion be accidental? He would fain be heve that it waa, and yet it enters into the argument of the article, and waa implied m the statements of the first and fourth lesBons What waa the practical teaching of leBBon 1 ? Was it not this ? There was no definite doctrine on this Bubject ia Scripture Good mea had differed about it Apostles even bad differed We might, therefore, differ, each taking the view that pleased him beBtwhat he might think: "the truest intellectual form into which to cast his faith ' Nay, not only with regard to the Atonement might he do so, but also with regard to all the elementa of Christianity for 1 ChriBtianity is a spirit, not a form Why this antagonism ? TheBe two things were not opposed, but mutually dependent Chris tianity was not spirit without form, neither was it form without spirit Take away the form, and the spirit vanished Separate the spirit from the form, and the form waa a dead carcase Take the two together in their unity, and you have life, soul and body in living union Christianity was embodied in the facts of tho Goapel You could not sepa rate it from theBe facts Dispense with them, and j ou have discarded Christianity Theae facts were presented to us in the doctrine of the Gospel That doctrine waa the form of Christianity Could we have Christianity aB a spirit-a life, without the doctrine? Waa it not by bringing the doctrine home to the heart and conscience in demonatration and power that the Holy Spirit quickened theaoul? ChriBtianity, aa a Bpirit, a life, waa begotten by doctrine-" Being bom again not of cor ruptiblo seed, but of incorruptible, by the Word of God, which liveth and abideth for ever -and by the sound instruction of tho Gospel was it sustained ChriBtianity was primarily doctrine, but only that it might be in the true Bonse a life, and theBe two could never be kept apart from each other without imminent peril to both They were never Beparated in Scripture Both were required for the living religion of faith and love and holiness There never could be a spirit or life of religion separate from the truth aa it ia in Jesus, both doctrinal and practical Doctrine waa life m principle, life was doc- trine in action He did not overlook the fact that the teaching of Scripture and for- mulated dogma were logically distinct things, but dogma professed to be the teaching of Scripture cast into logical form It might be that the "Atonement has been realised, ' to UBB the language of the article, "by mon who had held a doctrine of the Atonement different from that which wa hold to be the logical expression of tho teach* ing of Scripture on the subject, but he for one was Blow to believe that the Atonement had been realised by any man who practically rejected the teaching of Sonpture on the subject The knowledge that saves waa the believing knowledge of God's word as a personal message of love to the individual, and that might be apprehended practically in the sympathetic appropriation of the concrete and personal utterances of Hovolation by one who waa incapacitated, by defect of dialectic power, or prepossession, or prejudice, from casting his knowledge into scientific form, or even recogniBmg it when presented to him in Buch form. That might well be. The man's I heart was sounder than his head. But that did not prove that scientific dogma-the utterance of the practical faith in the intel I lectual form, which gives clearest und fulle.it expression to the whole teaching of Scripture on the «abject, waa not a matter of import ance. It was of importance to that practical faith itself The truth accurately defined in the understanding reacted upon the truth believed in the heart, giving it atreugth, accu racy, and precision It waa thca that men were enabled to give a reason for the hope that ia m Uiein It woe of importance for the union of tho Church, and the discharge of its duty aa a teaching, witness bearing institute. Men must como to an understand mg with one another aa to what the Scrip turee taught before they could bold forth that teaching aa with one voice The practical i effect of the statement made in the paragraph j containing tho first lesson derived dom the historical sketch was to depreciate the state ment of accurate doctrine The same prac ' tical depreciation of the doctrine of the Confession waB evident in tho close of the I Becond lesson, p 773 " When, therefore wo Bpenk of ransom redemption propitiation, Ac, w o must beat lu mind that thojo aro but figures, which aro not to bo pressed Into lo0ioal definitions of how Clod has in Christ reconciled man unto Himself If the writer meant by thia that any ono of these figures waa not to be held aa indicating a Btrictiy exact and circumstantial conformity between the Bubject to which it waa literally applicable and the analogoua aubjett which it waa used to illustrate, no exception could bo taken to his statement, but if he meant that an inherent incapacity of yielding conceptions which could be logically defined attached to these ûgurea aa iigureB then ho demurred The question waa-Did they represent facta reahtieB' Could tho nature and properties of those realities bo learned from these iigureB' WaB the knowledge which Uley jielded us such that it could bear to be accu rately defined and Bystematiaed ' Ho mum tained that it waa these figures, let it be borne in mind, were numeroua they wore varied, hut related to each other Tho con nexion in which each waa used waa generally aumcient to indicate what in it waa mtrel) circumstantial and what essential to the subject act forth , they were all figures sup plied originally by an economy intended to prepare for the lnatoric fact to which they relate in that economy the ideas winch they were designed to set forth in relation to that face were authoritatively attached to thom and these ideus were further illustrated in the history and literature of that economy Let this be borne in mind and let the figures be treated as complementary of one another, like bo many sketches of the same object taken from different points of view, and the) would find that, notwithstanding their im perfections when viewed apart, thej enable, I ub to form from them when combined and compared together, a juat and accurate conception of the Bubject, which might be defined like any other conception of tho un derstanding It might be that all that the writer intended waa a caution against pressing any one of these figures by itself into a definí tion, though it waa to be observed that the illustrative inBtance which he gave did not bear out that Supposition It was not by taking the figure of redemption aa an exact definition, but by misconceiving ita import aa uaed in Scripture, and by importing into it an idea which dominated the thought of the age, that Origen fell into hia outrageous error of a ransom to the devil There was nothing m the figure of redemption, taken even as an exact definition, that necessitated his intro duclng the devil aa a principal party m the transaction But if auch waa all that the writer intended, it waa a pity that he did not guard againat the împreaaion which an ordi nary reader following the drift of the article would inevitably receive from the lesaon in the bald way in which it waa put-to wit that there was no legitimate material for a doctrine as to how God had in Chnat re conciled man to himaelf, as there was nothing to found upon but figures and figureB did not give exact definitions The historical part of the article seemed to show a biaa The early fathers laid peculiar emphasis on the sufferings of Christ With reference to the grotesque theory of the ransom of the devil, it waa unfair to put it so as to make it appear aa if it were a character îatic theory of the period, because even those who held it, held along with it the aatiafac tion to justice view of the Atonement. The Rev Mr Hay submitted aa a point of order that no one in that court could in Binuatethata brother had distorted history The Rev Mr Strong -There ia no accusa tion against mo, and yet Mr Macdonald 13 accusing me of carefully perverting facta I call upon him to retract or make it good The Moderator -Anyone aggrieved can have remarks complained of taken down in writing, and domand fall explanation at the close of the speech The Rev M Mvcdonald said he indicated at the outBet that the question of intention waa not raised, and that he meant to keep aimply to what the article upon the surface of it (suggested He Baul the article gave the impression that the deBigu of it waa to give a certain view of history He imputed no motive Mr Strong -Then I understand Mr Macdonald to withdraw his imputation The Moder vroR- -There ia no imputa tion The Rev M Macdonald proceeded - Whatever the early Chnatians differed about, there was no question with regard to the death of Christ and its efficacy An important matter to bear in mind waa that no reference waa made in the article in the Review to the Bymbola of the church to the Confesaion, and the creeda, and the catechisms of the different churches m which the doctrine of the Atonement, held by largo communities, was set forth in ita most ma ture and most articulate form Why waa there that omission ? It was stated in the article that to give on account of all the various definitions of the Protestant church on the doctrine of the Atonement would be no light work, and that was a fact but it was made to appear that the definitions were greater or moro numerous than thoy really were, because all of them were revívala of the ideaa of Grotiua and Socimua and Amaraldye Even the viewa of Maurice, M'Leod, Campbell, and Robertson, of Brighton, might be considered as auch re vívala A large Bpace waa given in the article to the views of Maurice, M Leod Campbell, and Robertson, and they were made to represent the views of Christian thought in these later times, but why was it not noted that their writings or views were never recognised by their church, and that they had been refuted by many eminent writers' Were hie (Mr Macdonald s) brethren to understand by the article that Chriatian thought in these later times was confined to those schools, and that it all ran in the channela of those schools ' Now, he would have expected a writer who had aubaenbed to the Confeaaion of the Preabytenan Church and who had related the viewa aet forth in Mr Strong b article, to have entered a caveat or some word of caution againat thoae viewa but there waa no word in the article to ahow that the writer waa not in favour of thoBe views Nay, did the writer not on the other hand seem to imply taat he was in sympathy with some of the viewa Then Mr Strong aaid in the article that the philoaophical viewa of writers whom he referred to had not been without their influence on the church, and had had much to do inmoulding the Chriatian thought of the present day Would it not havo been well, also, if there had been some caveat thrown in at that portion of the article «gainst those philosophic views The Bketch of the hiBtory of the doctrine of the Atone ment as given m the article, was certamly to obacure the fact that there had beon a continuous thread of doctrine running through all the ages of the Chriatian church, and that waa the doctrine of substitution which the Preabytenan Church had for mulated in its Btandarda The lessons given in the article were most remark able when put forth on such a aubject as that of the Atonement, especially when put forth for the instruction or the gonoral public, but he would only refer to the last of them While that leaaon professed to aet forth the essential ideas of the Atonement, or doctrmea which, the writer put it, wero moro or leBB ideaUaed in all ages, the gravo omis sion was made of not bringing forward the essential idea of the doctrine which the stan darda of the Church contained There was no reference in the article to God na the supreme ruler of the world, which was the foundation of Chriatian doctrine, and he did not find any reference to it in the article at all Not only waa the idea of God as a aupreme ruler left out of the article, but the idea of moral law, of guilt incurred by the breach of that law, and of am in ita true souse, wore also left out of it There might be somo re fcronce to Bin in the words, " tho condomna tion of the falso self by the true aelf, but if the writer wiahed to expresB plainly that am was condemned by the law of God, could he not have uaed plainer words than those' Again, there waa no reference in the last paragraph to the atonement of Jesus Christ as an expiation for sin-aa satisfaction to the jujatice of God It waa deeply to be regretted there was no such reference There waa no reference either to the mediation of Jesua Christ, although it waa absolutely essential if the doctrine of the church was to be formulated, There would be no difficulty in coming to the conclusion that the article waa calculated, by the method of treatment adopted and by ita negations, to obscure the doctrine of the Confession of the Church on the Atonement, and to depreciate that doctrine by depriving it of ltefull signification of the necessity of satisfaction for Bin, and its statement that the satisfaction was rendered by the death of Chriat It might be said that the motion should have been made stronger, but he considered it quite sufficient for the purpose in view, which waa simply to affirm that the artiUa was fitted to obscure essential truth. That waa the object he personally had in view And now, would the preabytery pardon him if he made a few référencée to himself His name had bceu very freely brought before the public, and all aorta of imputations had been cast upon him. His only object in moving | m thiB matter waa to secure, if possible, a baBiB upon which the church could formally, explicitly, and authoritatively repudiate the doctrine contained in Mr Strong's article What, he would aak, would be the effect if the article was allowed to pass without a d19 cluimer hy the church ' It waa written by tue moBt prominent minister in tlitir church, wlio wita deservedly held in high esteem throughout the community, and whoso uttcranccB were regarded aa if he were speaking for the church (" No, no j lue article appeared aa one o' a eroup which were written by repreaentative ministers of the leading denominations, and it waa labelled with the nama of the denomina tion to which the writer belonged Tho whole circumstances showed that it had been regarded aB setting forth the doctrine of the Presbj terian Church Now, waa the church prepared to accept it ob a representa- tion of her doctrino ' Lvery minister at his induction or ordination waa required to assert, maintain, and defend the whole doctrine of the Confession to his utmost ability Did this article assert, maintain, or defend the doctruie of the Confession on tho Atonement' \\\ hy, let it he put into the hands of a pro- fessor of the higher cnticiam, and let him bo asked to ascertain from internal evidence by whom it waa written, and that profcBBor would have extreme difficulty in discovering that it was written by a Presbyterian minis ter holding the doctrine of the West- minster standards Turther, even if tho truth were suggested to him, he would feel compelled to come to the conclusion that if that doctrine was in the mind of the writer, bia intention waa certaml) not to defend it W eil, it Beemcd necessary 011 these grounds that the presbytery should distinctly clear themselvea of complicity 111 tina representa tion of their doctrine He wished the church to pronounce upon thia article-to aay what waa its. character Again, the article seemed to him to be a Bkilful plea for a broad church -for a church on the lines of comprehension \- a church which should embrace every shade of opinion , and it further appeared to lum that the writer had been moving on that line for some time back-trying to bring about that result. If euch were the purpose for which the article was written, it waa their dut) to say whether they were to make their church abroad churchoncomprehension principles. If it had come to thia, that the church waa to affirm that principle, or even to imply it by ita conduct, some of the mem- bers would have to consider their relations to it Most certainly, he, for one, on entonng the church took up the standards, articlea of union, and formula, and aaid, " Yea, these doctrineB I can accept and hold , but if he had understood that these doctnnea wero to be held m a looso general aenae and were not to be brought forward practically, he ahould certainly have hesitated before entering the church There was no school permissible in their church but the Behool of their stand ords-the Westminster Confession, the Shorter and Longer Catechisms He (Mr Mac- donald) had been accused of having dis turbed the peace of the church ever since he carne to the colony, and with having specially assailed Mr. Strong Thia ho denied It had been his misfortune to have been in a position of antagonism to Mr Strong for some time bick But why ?

Siodbs said, in rising to submit an amendment to the motion now before the court, I desire first of all to Bay that I have the most per- fect confidence in the honesty of purpose of the two gentlemen whose names have figured most conspicuously 111 this case -Mr M'Eachian and Mr Macdonald. Motivea, aa unworthy aa I believe untrue, have been attributed to both, which none who are personally acquainted with the gentlemen will for a moment entertain. I for one at least shall be no party to fithtiiig a good cause, or any cause with bo bad a weapon aa inamuation of motive (Hear, hear 1 Beaides, there does not seem to me to be the slightest need of introducing warm feeling mto this discussion W e are a deliberative body, and are bound by honour to the church to con- sider a question such as baa now arisen without lear and without favour, without even any regard to personal friendship, and I must add that I think it very bad form indeed for outside irresponsible writers to seek to coerce our judgment Put in brief, what we ob a preBbytery are called on by Mr Macdonalds motion to do ia thia, to declare Mr StroDg a Buapicioua peraon in regard to hie theoloty, und to call upon him either to exculputo or to mcrimiuato himself I earnestly hopo the preabytery will pauae before it commits itself to do either the ono thing or the other. Let membora quite under stand what 13 meant by adopting the com- mittee a report It meana a wholesale ac ceptance of what some even of their own number dissent from in part It meana a committal of opinion on pointa of doctrine and literary criticism, in which I, at least, shall have neither act nor part. Let members also understand the true meaning of that apparently bland and courteous pro- posal to give Mr Strong an opportunity to answer a few questions Innocent- minded persons may fancy this a simple solution of the difhculty in which we are placed In my judgment it ia now far from simple, and to nek it ib neither courteoua nor right Had Mr M'Eachran, m bringing up his motion, simply stated the grounds on which he crav ed a conference, then, irritated aB Mr. Strong might justly have been at seeing hia Review article dragged bo unceremoniously before the preabytery, I think he would have done himself no discredit to have comforted, m a few quiet worda, the troubled minda of his critics But tho speech of Mr M'Eachran took the form of a stern indictment, and no man with any soif respect would after its delivery have been Jus- tified in adopting this course It would have been tantamount to succumbing to a threat, and crjing " Peccavi I am to this day sur prised how the preabytery-at whoae meeting I waa not present, else I should certainly have proteBted-could have fallen into the error of allowing Mr M'Lachran to enter on ihe merita of a queation which he was merely asking the presbjterj to take within its juris- diction Howev er, it ia needleaa now to refer to the past, else I ahould also have some hard things to say of the manner in which this caBe originated, especially concerning caucua meetings, which are ao un Preab) terian, and which it ia to be hoped we shall hear no more of in future. I wish to address mjeelf to the reasons why this report should not bo adopted TheBe reasons as they appear to my mind may bo grouped under three headings-1 1 he report is illogical and self contradictory. 2 It is based on defec- tive principles of criticism, and in much on inaccurate aseertion. 3 It ia ungenerous to Mr Strong, and if adopted would be moat detrimental to the beat Interesta of the church I proceed to establish these posi- tions 1 If memberB will read Nos 2, 3, and 1 of " particulars noted, ' they will find what is equivalent to an ample exoneration of Mr, Strong No 2 aBBerts that Ins article consists of three parts, vu , an introduction, au his torical sketch, and some general lessons, and No 3 goes on to say, " In none of these parts docs the writer give a systematic Btatement of his own view of the Atonement," and No *, "In none of these patts does the writer contradict in categorical propositions and ex press terms the doctrine of the atone- ment contained m the Confession of Faith and the Longer and Shorter Catechisms The report ebould have ended thero. The committee would have amply fulfilled the re- quirements of the preabytory had thoy bo decided. Wo didn't ask them to prepare a caBe for the complainant, but aB Christian gen- tlemen to tell ua after fair consideration if the insinuation that Mr. Strong had taught falso doctrine on the Atonement were true. They come back and tell us it ia not true. Thoy have at length found out what was protty obvious to moBt people all along, that the article ia on historical Bketch, and that Mr. Strong does not profess to, and does not, state his own views therein To be sure there is an attempt to hide this by intro- ducing the worda systomatio " and " cate- gorical propositions" and " expresa tarma," and thiB I think is scarcely creditable, for the bare fact remains that there is no Btatement of Air. Strong's own which is contradictory of the standards of the church. But the gentlemen forming the committee were not prudent enough to reBt here. They seem to have had an ex- aggerated view of what waa required of them, and rushed on into 14 other particulars, with the expreBS purpose, apparently, of getting back by a circuitous approach to the position they liad abandoned They begin by telling na ('Particular No 5) that they find am biguity and mdefinitenesa of statement, and (in No G) that there ore " grave omissions in the treatment of the subject. Surely the committee must havo been ma jocular vein «hen they penned these ' notable particulars \\\ e didn't, I think, entrust to them the taak of handing into ub their estimate of Mr Strongs style, nor of reporting on what he did not say In the former case they pass at once into the region of literary criticism, which ta no part of the duty of the presbytery to consider In the latter they pass into an all surrounding mist. Tho blunder of the committee, I re peat consists in shifting the ground from theological to literary and historical criticism, and m seeking by it seems and it ap leura to come round again by a tortuous lath to the theological position that Mr btrong ia at variance with the standards i his is not fair, and it is not even cleverly done I admired much aa I dissented from, Mr M'Eachran's slashing speech There was a go and vigour about it which his bitterest opponent could not dispute But tile report before us seems to me to be of the limp, and lame, and halting kind There are paragraphe emphasising the use of certain words and phrases and distinctions, which make one wonder of what manner the reading of some gentlemen may be as familiar are these to modern thought and yet be surprising do they seem to the committee I don t wish for a moment to impugn their scholarship, indeed, in the case of several I am well convinced of it-but looking merely to their report I should pardon a wag who might suggest that they pose there as ecclesiastical Rip Van Winkles who have suddenly awakened from a 20 years aleep to be astonished at terms and ideas which were quite unfamiliar to them in their college days When men look aghast at the dis tinction drawn between tho Pauline and Johannine theology, when they start at "the religious consciousness of the Christian Church when they wonder that Fichte and Schelling and Hegel should be regarded as idealists—I scarcely know how to argue. They are thinking on another plane of thought from myself When again, in No 11, they assert that Mr Strong's views of the Fathers are one sided and defective they are impugning his knowledge (or his honesty ) not hIs orthodoxy. I am not desirous to enter on controversy on this point, although I believe that in the main, with one or two slight ex ccptions, the critics are wrong and the criti cised is right I think, however, the presby tery will see at a glance that in asking us to adjudicate on these points they are asking us to act vitra Lires There are, however cer tain ' particulura noted, which I also wiBh to note These ore Noa 8, 9,15,1C, l8 They have got corollaries, ana serious ones at tached to them All the other ' particulars arc simple ' padding mere "leather and prunella which we may brush aside with indifference Before entering on my second contention, however, let mo re peat the tlieBis of my first, that m view of the particulars Nob 3 and 1 the com mittee nave acted most illogically in traver sing their own finding III The report should not be adopted, on the intrinsic ground that it is based on defective principles of criticism and in much on unwarranted aeser tion In proof of what I here assert, I Bhall begin by BBking you to compare the fiudings with the corresponding particulars on which they are founded Particular No 8 is respon sible for finding No 1 One knows what has to he contended against here, because one method is pursued and not another (a hazar douB sequilur) and that other is repudiated Will the committee pardon me if I say that this as criticism is nonsense Because I travel by one route to my destination, do I therefore commit myself to saying there is no other route ? And in point of fact, the committee cannot be ignorant that there are two entirely distinct schools (distinct as tho idealist from the experientialist in philosophy) by which men try to spell out their thoughts on divine things. From Calvin downwards, and including such names as I doubt not are dear to the ruling majority of this presbytery,-such names as Cunningham and Candlish, the apriori method has been adopted, and religious truth has been argued from Christian postulates There is another way which should not be ignored, and to me it is perfectly evident that behind their criti cism of Mr Strong, the committee have a shivering dread of the Tubingen school, which of course, if Joseph Cook is to be taken as an authority is fairly squelched in these latter days. Nevertheless, a principle doesn't die and I shall make bold to say that no higher master worker has appeared in the field of historic criticism this century than Baur His inductive method has led to genuine and illumining results. And much as we may dispute his theologic conclusions, we should not be so childish as to ignore the splendid contribution he has given to the understanding of the Scriptures. In ductive philosophy, which is triumphant in every other sphere, does not fail vvhen it comes to be applied to the Holy Word and to the progress of thought in the church It was mj great privilege, aa it waa Mr Strong a, to sit under the luminous and inspiring teach ing of the most distinguished philosophie theologian in Scotland-Principal Caird-and I don t BuppoBe that either of ub will eve abandon the trend of thought into which we were led by him That trend of thought waa to search after truth from the standpoint of what we know, till, perchance, we shall get more light and fuller Hia caution to ua always waa-and I should speak with some authority on the point-never to place un educated belief in the room of earnestly educated knowledge Now I myaelf cling to that teaching, and prefer induction every where to deduction And has not Mr Strong juat boen following the eame prin ciple' But I put the matter too sen ously Mr Strong a article, which I read at the time of ita publication without the fainteBt auapicion of heresy being contained in it, sets out with the distinct assertion of the method of treatment he is to adopt ' Like every other doctrine of our creeda, Baya he, " thia doctrine has a history, t e , moy be looked at from its purely human Bide Having stated thia much he proceeds withperfectlynatural sequence-"Its rootand essence, ? e , viewed psychologically, " lie in the religious consciousness of the Christian Church He ib right Where else from the I point of view he adopts can it lie ' He ia pro lessuig, mark you, to write history, and history properly so called excludes the supernatural, which belongs to the realm of faith Now tho phrase, "the religious consciousness of the Chriatian Church seems especially to stagger the committee It isn t a new phrase-it was well worn in Scotland 20 years ago, and a word or two can explain it Members aro preBumably all familiar with Matthew Arnold a Zeit Geist which colours tho judgment of each genera tion, within which they must think out of which they can t Now what the ¿tit Geist ia to tho world the " religious conBCiouanesB ia to the church It is fluctuating, never exactly the same, but is always the measure of the church a belief and practice Hence the varied views of the Atonement from Iren-cuB to Calvin, from Calvin to M Leod Campbell and Maurice Hence, more palpably, perhaps, ni moral judgment, the cnurch a blindness m the past to Buch llagitioua crimea as slaven, witch burning, persecutions in general ' The religious consciousness of the Chriatian Church is the power it haa at any given time of thinking out and of practising Christian truth I submit, gentlemen, that in regard to the first finding the committee have proceeded on de fective pnncipleB of criticism when they charge Mr Strong with seeming to repu díate " the miraculous facta of the gospel nnd the supernatural Divino revelation ' 1 Hiding No 2 is based on particular No 0 - 1 0 Tho historic sketch opons with tho Bontonces 'Tho two leading distinct»o forms which wo find lil Scriptures are the Faullno and tho Johannlne Of tho less distinct and somewhat different doctrine to bo net with lu tho first three gospols, tho Apocal}p90 and tho epistles of James and Peter, wo do not at 1 resent speak With respect to tho second of theso eentcnecs, the committee find that It nooda to bo ox plained, as sccinliiR to bo Inconsistent with tho iulal llblo truth of tho Scriptures ' If I understand this aomowhat misty de hverance, it means that there haa been no auch thing aa progressive development in the perception of religious truth I am at one with the committee that Paul in his later doctrine of the mystical union of the believer with ChriBt approaches very nearly tho standpoint of John But that tina waa a thought which developed m Pauls mind, and was scarcely present to him in hiB earliest writinRB, admita, I think, of no doubt The committee seem to me to imagino it needful, in order to conserve the infallible truth and Divine authority of Scripture, to hold that the brama of the Evangelists, of Paul and of John, ahould ha moulded on exactly the same model. This is a wear/ mistake Aa it is impossible for men now to see exactly alike, bo waa it impossible to the writers of the Bible I am ashamed to utter BUch a platitude, and it is only because it seems to be impugned that I do bo Surely tina will not be controverted, that the know- ledge of God Himself is in the Bible a de t elopment The fierce ahout of the judges " God ia a man of wat ; the Lord is His name," is separated by long years of enlight- enment from the all illumining definition of John-"God is light," ana "God is love " Progressive development ia at once m the Bible and in the interpretation I of it Infallibility and authority do not, I J submit, reBt on so feeble a foundation as unity m perception of truth, which is simply impossible, but on the moral adaptation of all classes of thinkers of what the Bible con- tains Moreover, it ia the necessary process which a doctrine such as the Atonement must undergo that the fact on which it is based should bulk most prominently at the first, and that wondering awe should pre- clude any philosophical attempt to penetrate the meaning of the fact Tina, I presume, is Mr Strong a contention when be refers to the Lvangehets, and I asBert that the committee have made an indubitable blunder, both in fact and philosophy, when they challenge his virtual assertion that progressive develop- ment ib compatible with tho infallible truth and divine authority of Scripture Finding No 3 is a vague assertion, which I think baa been sufficiently answered by the foregoing remarks , and as to No 1 14 De teaching of tho article, taken os a whole, appears to lcavo out the essential element ot the Atonement, viz, the substltutlonary sacrifice ol Christ - which is based on j articular l8 ' l8 Tho statement of tho ' essential ideas, which are Bald to havo ' formed tho life and power ot the doctrine in all ages, is very unsatisfactory, as appear Ing to leave out the essential clement ol the Atone ment, v'z, the substitutlonary BacrlQco ol Christ, The rotated ideas of God as a moral l,ov craor, and of moral law, also appear to I c omitted - it seems to me aufficiont to say that thero is no teaching in the article os a whole other than the teaching that strictly belongB to historic consideration, and that it was imposai ble for Mr Strong from hia standpoint to gather up all the views into the substitutionar) sacrifice theory, unless he wished to stultify himself in regard to what he had already advanced 1 hero are many other points on which I Bhould like to Bpeak, in eBpecial on particular 15, w here I think there ib the most unworranted foisting of a meaning on wordB which they don t legitimately bear The distinction hero between "Bpint mid "form is simply delicious w hy, who may not see that what Mr Strong meaiiB ia, that the glorious truth of ChriBtianity abidea, caaentially untouched, however diverse be the expression of it But as I have placed before myself the task of considering only the findings, I leave to others to dissect further the particulars I think I have established my proposition that the report Bhould not bo adopted, on the in- trinsic grounds that it is based on defectivo principles of criticism and in much on un- warranted assertion III But, Bir, leaving all these matters behind, is it fair to Mr Strong to continue thiB agitation about what every member of thiB court knows will oventuate in nothing ' It ia simply harassing a gentleman who has gained a secure place in tho affec- tions of the community Not one of you can Bay that there is matter for libel in this extraordinary report And suppose to day )ou adopt Mr Macdonalds motion, and ask Mr Strong to answer you, and Btippose ho declines- aa I think it moat likely ho would, and ob I certainly think he ought-where are you ?

He did not like the idea of tho presby- tery making a trystiug placo and time and going to a place to Bee if Mr Strong waa willing to speak to them The amendment was preferable to the motion, because it freed Mr Strong from all Benso or suspicion of pressure It closed the subject unless it should bo reopened by Mr Strong voluntnril) and tbuB left him free to act aa bethought proper Mr Macdonald a motion did not say what was to be done id tho event of an explanation being refused, and that indefinite state of the case might tempt a man to stand a little on his pride, and say he would not move an inch until he knew what waa intended Again, tbo public might Ba> that an explanation which waa forced upon a man waa not worth much niB (Mr Robinsons) object waa to make it manifest to the church and tho public that the Presbytery of Melbourne stood fairly and squarely, and fully on the lines laid down in their standards, nlso m the in- terpretations of their standards which the Presbyterian Church had been accustomed to give for many years, that they were not going to tolerate rationalistic thought within tho bounds of their authority, and that they were going to treat as heresy anything which ignored the supernatural part of their religion, or trenched upon the vicarious character of the Divine Redeemer. He believed the church was orthodox to the core, and that it was not going to follow tho drift of modern thought outside the West- minster standards As soon as that position was made clear to all, the trouble was ended. There was no man with any sense of manli ness or self respect who had ceased to believe in these standards who would ask to re- main until he was pushed from their midst The second paragraph of the amendment he had put m m order to do by others as he would be done by He believed they were bound to put the most charitable construction on the article they could without violating their consciences. He could not forget that Mr. Strong had signed the standards that he had signed, he could not believe that Mr Strong was not as honest in signing those standards as he was himself, and there must be clear and distinct evidence before he would believe he had departed from the faith. He was far from endorsing the sentiments of the article m question, ana he waa thoroughly in sympathy with the opinions that that article required to be noticed Ho was ia thorough harmony with the thought that there should be some auch steps taken as wonld prevent all mistake in the mind of the public as to the views of the Presbyterian Church on the doctrine of the Atonement. He be- lieved that the members of the court who brought the matter under notice were animated by the purest principles-that they were just as honest, just as loyal and faithful to the interests of the church, and just as full of affection for Mr. Strong personally, as any other members of the church. The presbyter/ having placed ita position before the world, might now let the matter rest. He did not think it would be wise for Mr Strong to let the matter go past without explanations, bat that was entfrejj < for him to conaider. The aim of the preaby tery waa not a proaeoution of Mr Strong, or the tabling of a charge of heresy, but the de fining of their own position before the public, to prevent any injury to the intereats of the church and pure doctrine He thought at one time that end coula be gained by easier and less painful methods than a presbytery inquiry However, the effect had been to aet the presbytery njht with the world Let Mr. Strong offer explanations, if he felt dia posed to do ao, and let the matter reat there There waa a third reaeon why he proffered this resolution, and that was that Mr Strong should know he waa safe from all farther proceedings if he deemed it wise to refuso explanations Mr Macdonald s motion did not say what Mr Strongs position would be if ho refused explanations, but the preabytery could aay that Ile (the Rev Mr Robinson) thought the preabytery would Bay they had no desire to proceed to libel None of them wished to go further than they could help in the matter, or to give p..in to a brother if they could poBBibly avoid it If Mr Strong desired to explain he could do ao, but if he did not do ao, the reaponaibil't} of not going further should rest on him. Some might say that waa a lame and impotent conclusion to come to after all the feeling and excitement there had been on the subject-(hear, hear)-but ho would aBk the brethren to bear in mind that the feeling and excitement had been a" out Bide, and not inside the presbytery, for in it there had been nothing but the kindliest feelings towards Mr fatromr The object of the preabytery waa to prevent miaunder standing on the matter, to mako it known that the Preabytenan Church believed m ita doctrinea, and that Mr Strong waa in har mony with those doctrines 1 hose who had been carried away by newspaper representa tiona and misrepresentations to fancy the position of the preabytery different from what it waB, might think the conclusion the presbytery had arrived at a wrong one, but surely thej were not going to be driven from the position they thought right by all that the outside public might aay It waa no hiiRineaa of his that men who did not know t.ie Presb} terian creed from that of the Church of England, or the latter from that of tne Wesle}an Church, should think he (Mr Robinson) had m-s taken hia position, or had not done bo He knew his position, and was satisfied, and in his opinion all the presb} tery wanted to do was to make their position manifest, and they would be satisfied when they had done that If his amendment were adopted, and it should ever happen in the course of years that the Melbourne Presbytery was cal'ed upon to try a case of heresy, they wou'd find the amendment waa not a lame or impotent thing, but a solid foundation beneath their feet, for it would be a manifest declaration " of what they held, what they were pre pared to fight for, ond what they would go to any extremea to maintain If they laid that foundation he waa pre pared to reat upon it, praj mg to God they might never have to deal with a caae of heresy by ita declarations If the members of the preBbytery were in favour of the general terms of the resolution he moved, he asked them not to alter its wording, aa by throwing in one or two words they might alterr ita whole meaning Mr John M'Leod seconded the motion The presbytery adjourned for lunch, and on re assembling, The Rev Dr Macdonald was elected moderator pro tem Mr Balfoue, M L C , suggested that the Rev. M Macdonald ahould divide hia motion so that the attention of the preabytery might be confined in the first instance to the approval of the committee a report Mr J C Siswabt reminded the presbytery that he asked that this Bhould be done at their laat meeting, but that he received a point blank refusal. It would be most incon venient to divide the motion now Mr Macdonald said he would divide it if he received the permission of the preabytery The Rev F R M Wilson moved that the motion be divided aa suggested The Rev A Haedie seconded The Modebatob ruled Mr. Wilson a motion out of order The Rev. Mr Wilson -I dissent from that ruling The Modebatob (Dt Macdonald) -I would really like to be out of the chair altogether (laughter), but I will try to do ray duty The Rev J M Abehvbthy said he happened to be one of the minority in the committee He could not agree with Mr Stobba that thia waa a trumpery question It seemed to him to be the moat important mutter they could possibly have to diBcuaa, for their whole church doctrine hung upon it He re gretted that Mr Macdonald had not an opportunity of speaking aa fully aa he seemed to deane at the close of his address Considering the way in which that gentle man had been treated, the presb} tery ought to have beard him with a great deal of sym- pathy, end given him the fullest opportunity of aetting himself right with the publ'c Ab to the reaolutiona of the committee he dis sented in the first place from No 9 of the particulars noted - " 9 Tho historic sketch opens with tiic sentcncd 'Tho two leading dlstin lite forms wbieh »o find In Scriptures aro the Pauline and tho Juhannine Of tho less distinct and somewhat different doctrine to be met with in tho first llireo gospels tho Apocalypse and tho epistles of James and Peter, we do notât present speak ' With respect to the s "ond of theso sentinas the committee lind that it needs to be cxnlalnod asseomlnp tobo iueoiiBittcnt with tho In fallible truth of the Scriptures The expression " somewhat different was guarded Because two Scripture w.itera spoke differently concerning a subject, that waa no reason why their inspiration or authority should be denied The article did not say two different doctrines were taught He dissented alBO from Noa 12, IG andl7 - "12 TBo articlo, thonith profes'lnp; to bo a sketch of tho history of tho doctrino, entirely overlooks tho symbols of tho churches-the creeds, articles con fessions, and catechlBms-which authoritatively de claro their doctrines in their most matured and arti dilato forms " The article alBO overlooks tho general agreement of Protestant writers on the Bubject of tho Atone mont " " 10 Tbo pissago, 'Wo cannot all think in oxactlt tho samo way oven as John or James or Paul,' soems -from the connexion in w hich tho Btatemcnt is made to bo inconsistent with tho divine authority of Scrip turo "17 In Ho 2 of tho ' Lessons,' the statement con demnatory of tho error of Qrotlus is unsatisfactory, andrequlros explanation, as tho languago scorns to bo inconslsleut with tho doctrino of the porsooality of Cod, and also to bear against the conception of Cod as Supremo Kulcr which underlies tho doctrino of the Confession on the Atonement. He did not coneider the expression, "We cannot all think in exactly the same way aa John or James,' at all inconsistent with the authority of Scriptnre It simply meant that you might receive every statement the apostles presented, and at the same time not think in exactly the same way with them No 17 did not aeem to him to contain any denial of the personality of God He also dissented from the first and second general findings He could not see on} thing in the article tending to deny the miraculous facta of the gospel He said the standards Mr Strong had Big ied, ona the fact of bia not having withdrawn bia aigna ture, waa sufficient to Bhow that he had not denied the doctrines of the church With these four or five particulars eliminated, the Bting waa taken out of the report Hi moved that the pointe he had mentioned be omitted. There waa no Beconder for thiB proposi tion The Rev D H Ballantine said he could not possibly agree with the whole of the com mittee's report He thought a great many of the pointa noted ahould nave been left out, and that now the preabytery should throw them ov crboard at once At the same time he had great sympathy with the inquiry itself There were two pointa which included every thing necessary in the inquiry, and if those two points were satisfactorily explained b) Mr. Strong the whole proceedings ahould at once come to an end He did not think there waa any real ground for inferring that Mr Strong either denied or doubted the per Bonahty of God V ith regard to the inapira tion of the Scriptures, he thought the phrase of tho writer b objected to by the committee required some explanation A simple state ment from the writer of his meanin" would meet the caae That would be a manly and noble course, which would raiae him in the cstoem of bia brethren Aa to the first paragraph, little explanation was needed The writer stated that the root and essence of the Atonement lay in the rehjioua conscious ness of the Christian church If the writer meant by " root' " origin, there waa nothing in the New Teatament to favour the idea If he did not mean that, let him Bay bo, and let the preBbytery understand what he did mean The other statement which he fancied re Siired a little explanation waa the one at the ose of the third paragraph of the article, that the Atonement waa, in the estimation of St. John, the fulfilment of philosophical thought The other thing which he thought required explanation was found at the foot of the third paragraph, and waa contained in the following words - " To Paul and John allko Jo jus Is tho Saviour, the reconciler of God to man and of man to man, but to the ono Ho is so as the end of tho lan, to tho other as tho fulfilment of a philosophie thought." Kow, he auppoaed that John in his youth was taught more about handling hia fisher man's net than about Grecian philosophers and their philosophie thought The Atone ment was to John for more than the fulfil- ment of a philosophic thought, for he bore testimony-and mode Christ bear testimony -to the grand truth that He caine not merely to be a great teacher and martyr, and to fill philosophic thought, but to give His life u ransom for men His (Mr Ballantyne^) view of the matter was that, to satisfy the minds of his brethren and to pat an end to this unhappy controversy, it would be right manly and becoming of Mr. Strong to make there, before the presbytery con- cluded its sitting, an explanation of his views on the subject What ho meant by that was euch an explanation as he believed Mr Strong had told him he could make. He hoped Mr Strong would there declare that tho brethren who had thought there was room to infer that there was a necessity for explanation with reference to his viowa on the Atonement and the inspiration of Scrip tureB were mistaken, and that he conld solemnl) and conscientiously affirm that he both believed the Scriptures were inspired and that the Atonement of Chriat waa real With that ond ia view, ho proposed the following amendment - 1 That tho prcBbytoryrecclvo the committees ro port thank them for their diligence ask Mr Strong to explain tho statements in tie articlo tlut has caused these proceedings, and, in tho event of these ot) lanal ous being satisfactory, that tho proceedings now Uko an end Mr William Maxwell seconded the mo tion The Rev J L Rentoul aaid he alao would conclude with an amendment His friend Mr RobinBon had said he wiahed thia matter were well over Tor his own part, ho wiahed it had nev er begun He would not venture to op portion tile blame of ita beginning Eut he might be permitted to say that a man like Mr Strong, coming to a great and repre Bentative church like the Scots Church, and casting upon the public a paper auch as could cauao thia ead perplexity and divided estranged feeling and jet refusing to g ve a word of explanation, placed hirase'f under a weight of reaponBibihty auch aa he (the speaker) would not like to bear On the other hand, he had alwaya neld that any man who bringa up a question of heresy or presumable heresy m a church court should be prepared to table a charge Without that, the question should not bo raiBed But now this queation waa upon them, end it taust be admitted constitutionally before them, its aolemn i86uea could not be shirked They must face the paper, nnd express their opinion upon it The views expressed in the paper were not new For many a year in Germany down to 1831 when Hegel died, the tendency and effort of the " transcendental" philosophic school had been to ignore historic facts—to elevate what they called " ideas" (essential ideas having their essence in the human conscious ness) or, as Mr Strong said, to " idealise the doctrine, letting the historical facts which were regarded as but ' the temporary drapery,' fall completely into the background." "The idea and ideal, it was affirmed, "were the real in them alone was to be found the truth and the life." That was done for a good reason, namely, because the historic facts were supernatural, and that clashed in the teeth with a theory which made all re ligion an evolution and development out of "the human consciousness Of even Schleiermacher, with his warm hearted re ligiousness, Dr George Matheson said ' His position regarding Christ and Chris tianity may be indged by one question, ' Is the Christ of Schleiermacher at this moment a living person—hearing us, potent to save?' " Till lately Schleiermacher was Mr Strongs hero But in his recent book Caird denounced Schleiermacher, and elevated Hegel Mr Strong—when on the former day he (Mr Rentoul) was touching the sore part of hie paper, and showing that it was Baur's posi tion—said " its language was Hegel's." So it was, but it was more. It spoke, at any rate the critical method and even results of the school of Baur. And, as was admitted (by all competent scholars) Baur and Strauss were carried to their positions by adopting the philosophy of Hegel and the critical method of Schleiermacher (Fairbairn's Con temporary, May, 1870) They (said Uberweg) had learned their method from Schleier macher, but they had also ' learned from the Hegelian philosophy not to connect religious interest with any person, but with the idea itself, which (on the principles of Hegel) did not like to pour out all its riches into any one individual." God, according to Hegel, was the " absolute self consciousness—a living process of self activity." "God Principal Fairbairn said, according to that view, " ceased to be in the old sense personal, because He was an eternal process of self evolution and self involution So the history of nature and man was but in the fulfilment of a Divine order in which a fall could have no place, and so the idea of sin was ruled out of court. Nature was but the revelation of an immanent and necessaiy procesa , and so Provi dence as supernatural interference or su perintendence, became impossible There could be no Atonement, therefore, eave m the sense of reconciliation of man's thought with God Now, he (Mr Rentoul) believed that those thoughts and principles and words were also the thoughts of this paper The committee had struck the Hegelian tone of the paper when they said it made Atonement mean only re conciliation But one other principle of Hegel's he must state, " God exists to philo sophy as a notion (an essential idea, a begriff —an object of pure thought in the form of thought, but to religion as a representation a figerative conception The idea or notion, the representation of so called " historical fact, was the transient vehicle ; or, as Mr Strong said—" the historical facts which are regarded as but temporary drapery fell com pletely into the background Those were the two central principles of Hegels philo sophy, which dominated Baur and Strauss and made the Tubingen school. Those were the two principles which appeared all through the paper of Mr Strong It was Hegel's principle of the " essential idea" or " begriff," clothing itself in a transitory and non essential picture of historical form that made poor Mürklin, Strauss's friend, write—" The relation in which the Hegelian system place religion and philosophy to each other is beautiful, and were I only a theologian I could easily get along with it." But now as a preacher he (Mr Rentoul) was in this fix—obliged to explain as the essence of the things what, according to that Hege lian system, was only the form (the tem porary form) of the representation. Yes, that was the fix—to Paul, to John, to Peter— what Hegel called the "picture was the reality, without which, St Paul's said, "faith is vain ;" and the late Mr Menzies said, " Without that historical fact, Christianity perishes." Nay, Baur himself taking the stand of Hegel left them in no doubt there. He said, "With what right is Jesus of Nazareth iden tified with the Redeemer?" Historically, no absolute proof could be given The essential nature of a Redeemer was a philosophical re ligious " idea." It was not a fact to be his toncall) evidenced It was held that it be longed to the sphere of consciousness alone, and could only have an ideal meaning He (Mr Rentoul) then said John Caird in his new book was trying to popularise Hegel in Britain—that "the popular conscious ness as distinguished from the specu lative consciousness dwelt in symbols imaged figurate representations of ideas, and that such expressions as " Father," "Son," "Father of Our Spirits "were only materialised or figurate expressions "The paternal and filial relation cannot," he added, "be literally predicable of the Divine nature God could no longer be rightly called 'First Cause, or "Creator, or Providence "It is only when we think of God aa absolute Spirit or self consciousness that we have the essential idea of His nature "In the knowledge of the minds that know Him, in the self-sur render of the hearts that love Him, He knows and loves Himself It was to that (so called) philosophic idea that Caird twisted away the sacred language of Paul, " God who hath reconciled us to Himself." Of course Caird, as a Hegelian, added no hint that Paul meant a wholly different thing when he said, ' God who bath reconciled us to Himself by Jesus Christ For He hath made Him to be sin for us who knew no sin, that we might be mado the righteousness of God in Him Now, the preabytery were placed that day in tbia perplexing and painful posi- tion—1. Baur, like Hegel, made all doctrine have its "root and essence" in the human consciousness, and all the Christian doctrine have root and essence in the Christian con sciousness. So did Mr Strong 2. The sohool of Hegel and Baur had no atonement save in the sense of the reconciliation of mans thought with God. Neither had the paper of Mr Strong 4. Again, the Bauro- Hegel school distinguished between "essen tial ideas" and non essential historic "pic turings and representations." The historic facts might fall away as drapery. So exactly Mr Strong appeared to do The committee had said that " in the conclusion of the paper 'vague and mystical phraseology was em ployed,' especially in setting forth what were represented as the "essential ideas." Now the expressions were " mystical" just as all the system of the transcendental school was mystical (so mystical that in an age which tested all things by facts it could not live long) But to anyone who had studied that school the expressions were in no wise vague As plainly as words could say it, Mr Strong said in his paper that it was his exhi- bition of the Atonement. Those were the "essential ideas." "The Atonement had been realised" as an essential idea. And for the historic facts, or, rather, historic drapery, Mr Strong was not concerned. They were non essential. Then, again, Baur made the tendencies of the parties in the early church create the church and its doctrine The three parties-1. the Jewish-Peter, James, the Apocalypse, 2, the Hellenish Jewish -Paul-the battle between Peter and Paul ; the philosophic cast of the Johannine ten dency reconciling the two battling tendenciee in a third tendency, and these " pictures," the miracles and resurrection in the gospels, were said to be not "essential." Unfor- tunately the language spoken in the paper was just that Nay, in it surely Mr Strong had fatally committed himself, by eajmg with Baur, " Paul's mode of arguing is Hebraic, the Johannine philo sophic." They all knew that several epistles of Paul's were strongly philosophic, and Baur discarded them for that (Philippians, Colossians, Ephesians) Mr Strong's paper also forced on them the painful thought that it necessarily held that the philosophic "Pauline" epistles as not Paul's Again, Baur, in treating of the doctrine of the Atone ment, paaaing over the person of Christ, and beginning with Paul, went on to the early fathers ; then to Origen and the ransom to the devil; then to tho schoolmen and Anselm ; then to Luther and Calvin, then to the moderns; and Mr Strong just followed in his steps. What weighed heaviest upon him (Mr Rentoul) that day was that there was in that paper, as in Baur, no super- natural redeeming Christ His personality, Hia antomg life and death were none of the " essential ideas " That was only the his- toric " voxstellung "—part of the "drapery" Instead of Him they had the essential idea of ' God's righteousness in a divine ideal." Now what was the presbytery to do ? They surely could not, and in God's sight dared not, say, " This is nothing " On the other hand, the motion of Mr Macdonald waa surely not adequate Its struggle was for the formula tion of a doctrine about our Lord's substitu tionary work, while our Lord's very historic existence and supranatural personality were the point in question, and the centre of the battle that day And, besides, if Mr Strong did not explain, did the preaby tery mean to exercise its power of discipline' He (Mr Rentoul) did not think that waa con.era plated Ho would rather himself a thousand fold resign, and giv e up his post, than bring judicial action to bear on another His post tion was that of Norman M'Lccds in that respect The only way he coald see out of the sad and solemn difficulty in which Mr Strong had placed them was to give such a finding aa ahould protect the church, and the central facts of their Lord s gospel committed to their char-ie And, above a" their pro nouncements ahould make it evident that tho queation waa not between broad churchmen and evangeltsts, but between those of all shades," broad or "narrow," who held the supranatural Lord and Redeemer as the Church s founder and Saviour, and thoae Hegehaed thinkera who, ignoring any supra natural Christ, i>r any intervention of God to eave, found the root and essence of rehsioua doctrine in the human consciousness He (Mr Rentoul) contended that Mr Strong ought to give an explanation of the mean- ing of his paper to the preabytery Mr Sinot.G proteated against discussion being raised on hia conduct about not giving au explanation, and said that BUrely he hada right to take his own course Mr Remoul said it would have been the best course for Mr Strong to have made an ex- planation. The newapapere had aaid they had pone out of their wa) and taken a cruel course in this matter, but thej bad not travelled out of their course as the Presb} terian Church In conclusion, he proposed the fol- lowing amendment - ' Tile presb} tor} having considered tho paper on the Atonement published lu tin "Victorian Roi low* for October, 1SS0, and signed ' diarios Stronnr,' rai bav ing alBO considered their committee s report on the same, express their sincero concern and pa'u at the negatlto character of tho teaching In Mr Strong's gipor, tho absence from it of all recognition o' tho hine presence of the Lord Jesus Christ as tho med< ator and reconciler working out the Atonomont, as well as Its apparent ignoring of any supranaturally git cn revelation , and, inasmuch as thoObrlstiaufalth rests upon, and tho Cbiistlan cohECIouBncss takes hold of, certain objective aupranatural hlBtottc facts, especially the Incai nation, tho atoning Ufo and death, and tho resurrection and ascension of our Lord, tbo prcsbj iciy earnestly urge upon Mr Strong that in futuro utterances bo '0*3011, maintain, ana defend' thcBO essential facts, as tho mlalBters of our church have Bolcmnl} bonnd themselves to do " The Rev. A. Yole seconded the motion He thought the committee was deserving of thanks for the work it did The proposal at the end of Mr Macdonalds motion for the conference acemed to him to be too late to be of service. Whenever Mr Strong waa dia posed to Bpeak he could do it, and there waa no necessity for a conference His (Mr. Yule's) reaaon for thinking that thia waa not a matter which should be raised,waB that he thought thej could not formulate any distinct proposals for a libel out of the article He fully felt the difficulty and painfulneaa of their position But m some eense he did not regret that they had been brought into Hub position Things like this would come to a crisis some day or other, and if they came in a way they did not like, they could not shirk their responsibility Ho did not desire the evil day, and he did not desire that an} thing ahould be done that would mtcifere vv ith the comfort of Mr Strong or hia uaeful neeB m thia great community. He hoped he waa free from all peraonal jealousies and animosities He was supporting the rather strong resolution of Air. Rentoul be- cause be could not do otherwise In lesson 3 Mr Strong Baid it waa of the greateat importance in ora er to understand a man's book that you should comprehend his stand- point He (Mr Yule) endeavoured to under Btond the atandpoint of the writer of this article He waB not a profesaor of the higher criticiBm, but be thought he waa bound to go to the article Opiniona were given, and the presbyteiy waa left to pronounce He first put m a BuppoBition that Mr Stron« wrote from the atandpoint of orthodoxy, "but it would not work Then that he be- longed to the Tubingen Behool. It waa true that his attention waa firat at tractcd to Mr Strong by hiB article on Leasing, but he had forgotten that, and only rtmmbered that he had heard him apeak so strongly about teaching the children of the church the love of God He thought then the Maurician was his standpoint, and tried to bring that in, but it would not do. He then tried the standpoint of Baur and the Hegelian philosophy, and he must say that from tho beginning to the end of the article, wherever Mr. Strong waa expressing his opinion, he found Hegelianism run That being the case, it was a matter of literary criticism. It was not a matter he could bring before the court and prove in auch a way that there could be no doubt of it, but having come to the conviction that that waa tho atandpoint from which the article waa written, he could not do lesa than aay it How Mr. Strong reconciled himself as the author of this article with his position as a minister of the Scotch Church and a Presbyterian loyal to the standards, he could not Bay. It waa true that ' reconciliation" in the mouth of Hegel was quite sufficient, whereas with us it was quite out of the question The opening sentence in No 8 of the committee's report he thought on the whole waa perhaps the worat aentence in the article, because he found it quite im- possible to reconcile it with an orthodox con Btruction of the article If " root" meant soil and " essence " meant form, it would be correct, but such waa not the meaning of those words Besides in the very next sen tence the writer went on to speak of the historic doctrines aa a river running from a source and paasmg over soils The following aentence Bhowed that bj root and essence he meant origin The position waa thoroughly Hegelian-that of the school which denied the supernatural or thoroughly ignored it The ta'k about the Johannine and Pauline tendencies, and the intensification of that exaggeration waa characteristic of the school of Baur The ascription of the Goapel of St John to one author, and the Revelations to another, was also Bauerian. And so with the statements of the Fathers, and down to the end until you arrived at the Nihilistic conclusion as to any objective Atonement The language was out and out Hegelian, and of the school of Baur. The speaker next referred to the writings of Renan, Schleirmacher, Kant, and Fichte, and said that in Germany Hegeliainism was obso leacent. Mr Strong's position as a minister of the church was that no held ita doctrinea con amore in the sense of the church that im posed the Confession How, then, did he ac- count for tihs ? There must be two Mr Strongs-the one who wrote that article, and the one who aubaenbed to the Weatminater Confession Much of the Hegeliainism he at- tributed to Mr. Strong's early education. When a young man fell under the teaching of a great men there was always a lasting impres- sion left He (Mr Yule) acknowledged the greatnesa of Dr Caird, of Glasgow He said he waa a powrful man, because of the baneful influences he had exerted on manj of the young clergy. The Rev Mr Stobbs -I riBe to a point of order. I object to the word baneful being applied to Dr Caird The Rev. Mr Yule -I will withdraw the influence ia baneful The Rev. Mr, Stubbs-Dr. Caird haa written a book, and his viewa are well known. The Rev. A. Yule had no desire to criti eise Dr. Caird m the least, but he ahould have to criticise Mr Stobbs' speech before he had done. (Laughter ) A pupil of any great man would almost unconsciously adopt his views and language without seeing to what it waa leading. There had been a de- velopment in Dr. Caird'a life too. Groat allowance waa to be made foi the Eupil of auch a distinguished man using is language, and ander thoae cucum stances he would not attribute to the lan guage what he otherwise would Mr Strong might also have adopted certain acta of sub BCription winch were not common with the clergy. It used to be aoustom for theologians to distinguish between their science andtheir faith If Mr Strong did that, he wished he would preach and write his faith, and let his science »lone , and, as Tom Carlyle said, "consume Ina own smoke (Laughter, j He sympathised with Mr Strong's deaire for a comprehensive church, but he thoujht they might properly exhort him to be more cautious He could not see him dancing on the tight rope of strained orthodoxy witnout concein, and his swinging on the slack rope of heterodoxy made his friends uneasy. PerbapB, however, that expression was too strong He did not see the full meaning of it until the words had escaped him He gave Mr Strong credit for a desiro to Bavo the community from the dreadful spirit of matenoNtio atheism He wished the brethren would remember there were multitudes who were imbibing not the Hegelian idealistic philo- sophy, but the sensualistic philosophy, which ended in materialism, and must come to utter atheism and utter irreligion He could understand that a person m the hope of rescuing men who read the works of Herbert Spencer and others from falling into materialism, might put forth the Hegelian teaching of idealism. but it was impoa pible to teach Hegel in Melbourne with advantage. Kant saw that the view was coming in time-that the idea was every thing, and that fact was a secondary matter, or that the fact and the idea were identicci, and be aaid they were not so.be cause the fact of his having 100 thalera waa one thing and the idea of it another thuig Much aa ho (Mr Yule) respected the motives of the man who thought to keep people from materialism by teach ing Hegel, he could only have great doubts about his wisdom He, however, had heen most astonished to hear a statement Mr Stobbs had made that day He took the words down, and they were -" History ex cludes the supernatural, which belongs to the sphere of faith " Now those words were worse then anything m Mr Strong's art clc (laughter)-ond as against them he would not give his own view, but that of a great theolo glan The Rev Mr Stobbs-You do not give a correct definition of my worda Hie Rev A \ule said he took the worda down at the time The Rev Mr Haiidie Btitcd that ho alao took tile worda down to tho aamo effect as Mr Yule had t-ken them down 1 he Rev Mr Yole-The authority here ferred to was greater than either Hegel or Bauer It was Niebuhr who said that he did not hold the man to be a Christian who did not hold that Christ's earthly life, with all the miracles attending it, came within the sphere of history, and who did not o'so re ceive all the points of the apostolic creed with the fullest conviction The Rev Mr Rorke moved that the près byterj should adjourn to the following day The Rev Mr Hat propoaed, as an amend ment, that they should adjourn to Thurs da) lue Rev Groundwater TraBer and the Rev J Ballantyne both stated that they desired to hand in amendments before the presbytery adjourned After a short diacuasion aB to whether it would be better to adjourn to the next day or to Thursday, the question waa put, and decided in favour of the fo"owing day The Rev GnoohDWATEE Tiiaseu handed in the following amendment - "That the prcsb)tcrv thenks the committeo for their patient investigation of tho matter remitted to them , that whlht tho presbytery regrets that occa sion should have been given for sorlous doubts and difficulties regarding the soundness ol Mr Strong's uttcianccs in his articlo on tho Atonement, y ct loos much as the committee hav o reported that tho article consists of thrco parts, and . in nono of these parts docs tho writer givo a systematic Btatement of his own views of tho Atonement,' or ' contradict in cato goricel propositions and express terms tho doctrine of the Atonement contained ni tho Confession of Faith and tho Larger and Shorter Catechism,' tho presbytery i ecms it Inexpedient totravol further In tho matter At the rame timo the prcsbyteiy takes this oppor tunlty of sotting forth tho doctrines of tho church regarding the topics under discussion, ntmolj -1 The Scriptures of the Old and New Testaments 'aro given by Inspiration of God to bo the rule of faith and life ' 2.
