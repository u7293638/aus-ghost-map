PORTFOLIO. LENT.-It takes a long time to set and bandage and cure a broken leg or arm,-the sufferer has to bear with much patience the weary days, and oftentimes it is thus with a broken bone,-will it not be nmuch more with a broken heart? Shall we wipe out by a few sighs and tears the memory of sins com mitted wilfully, secretly, and perseveringly, sins committed long ago, which as they start up into the conscience, bring to light not only others committed long before them, but frightful consequences which they have entailed? Some untruth or misconduct which has injured fatally the character of a neighbour, some intemperate act of self-indul gence which has ruined health and reputa tion-these. and a thousand reflections which might be mentioned, will force the enormity of their guilt upon us; and although we bring them one by one to Jesus, and cast themn at the foot of the cross, yet is their iniquity made all the more conspicuous and hurmbling hecause they crucified him afresh and put him to an open shame. It is most true, gloriously true, that there is a present free and full forgiveness for all and every sin through the precious blood of Christ; but it is equally true that the remembrance of our sins is grievous unto us, and the burthen of them intolerable, as we look back upon the pathway of incon sistency and carelessness and unbelief and sensuality and selfishness and ignorance along which we have walked ; antd this is one of the advantages which the observance of Lent produces. It seems to say to us day by day, "Give time to reflection and confession of sin ; give time to prayer and reading the Bible ; give time, by the aid and presence of tIe Holy Ghost, for godly sorrow to work repentance unto salvation not to be repented of."- lery Ree. the Deanc of Ripon.
