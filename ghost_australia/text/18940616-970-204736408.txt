While all other trades and professions have long ago massed themselves into unions for joint benefit and defence, the farmer has stood off and attempted to fight the world single handed. Consequently he is an easy prey to the unionist, who buys his produce, and the merchant or. manufacturer who sells liim his farm requisites and machinery. He .has managed' to get a good deal:, of political representation because a class, which is .bound together into a close combination has had very nearly a monopoly of ..representation,'and has benefitted hiih because they could; hardly get their own legislation through without doing so, but of that co-operation waich is the bed-rock of- class success in these, days, he has. not a ghost of a suspicion.
