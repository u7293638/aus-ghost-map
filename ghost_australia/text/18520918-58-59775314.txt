THE TURF. j The Entries for the Drapers' Meeting. BY NIMROD'S GHOST. IT is needless for me to say that last monday's Entry List reflects great credit on the N.S.W. Turfites. Such Urge fields have never been named in the history of colonial racing and there is little doubt but that most of them arc actual starters. There seems to be plenty of speculation nlieady coing- on, and from the confidence expressed by the friends and backers of many of tbe favor ¡tes, lots of money will most surely change hands. The Maiden Plate (?) (at least TH E so SUPPOSED) and the Handi- cap attract the most attention, and a most astonishing number of winners are named. Of course, there will be loads of false prophets, under all sorts of signatures, proclaiming thc certainties of the different events ; but it strikes me that it would puzzle u Philadelphia lawyer to have cheek enough to pick from the list, till the labt week of training shows the con- dition of the animals. Past performances arc not sure guides to the future; and il requires a gnod head and eye for the PK BSE NT, as well as recollection of UY GONKS, to acquire a réputation for pro- phetic judgement. With this fact strongly impressed on my mind, I shall not hazard any criticisms on thc nags till thc Saturday before the Races : when by close personal observation and the novice of those who have known them longer and better. I trust to he pretty near the mark in naming my fuvorites. I understand there is a probability nf a Corinthian Stakes ; and trust that it may come o ff, for great good accrues to the interests of the Turf by occasionally feeing gentlemen in the pigskin. There are a few remarks about the Handicap, which I had better put oil' till next week; hut it strikes me that the range of sun ING-SCALB is not sufficient. There might have been MORE AT TOP and LESS AT BOTTOM. With these few remarks as a heading, the Kntries are as under : DRAPERS' HOMEBUSH SPUING MEE TING. The Drapers' Purse of 150 sovereigns.
