A1 TRIEME WAR STdRYI, At thelbreaking out of the civil war I was a mero boy, anld our nLearest neighbour was a Ilorrid-faced, hind-hearted, generous old Quaker. Both ho and his good wife had been reared in the south, and aftarthe liberation of their slaves from a sense of duty still retainedl enough to surround themselves and family with all tihe comforts which the people of their simple faith care to possess. In those days their great stone house with its thick walls, broadl verandahe, and low windows cet my idea of the castles which were mixed up with my meagre knowledge of modieval limes. The macudasmiseed road that ran through the farmn was lined'on either aide with locust trees that in the periodl of blooming made the air heavy with the perfume of the graceful white blossoms waving in a background of green that they almost concealed. A nievor-failing spring that bubhbled us thlrough moss- gown stone was embowered iii the overiuigiig branches of strong-trunked weeping willows. The great front yard hadl its driveways cut through a rich award, and wound among towering maples. 'Tie garden had the earliest, the latest, and the sweetest flowers. Tihe stock was tlhq ,fattest and the best cared for. The negroes who would not leave a. kind master and mistress found a life of comIparative ease and plenty with them. The handsome old gentleman was "iruedpa WVateroon" to all of use, and the wife, who allowed no visiting boy or girl to dlepart without cookies, great mellow apples, umince pie, maple sugar cakes, or some other, evidence of a ktuidness that took all the world into her heart,'was always " grandma." No nobler ever trod the pathway of life together, and the sorrows that came uponlhem suggested to me as a boy the inserutable ways of Providence. There were two sons in the famiily, mnodeli of physical perfection nod manly courage. No. handsomeor could be found. They were over six feet fall, had the light curly hlir, the blue eyes, and the fresh complexion no conspicuoues in men of Anglo-Saxon origin. They were highly educated and idolized not only by the parents but by the four fair sisters and untold scores of other penpll's sisters. One had gone west, and soon established a onu-' larity that placed hit in a responsiblo iublic posifion. ho other lhad remained at home and relieved Grandpa Waterson of every busi ness care. The startling' soi n 'of .'cilici' hostilities ,lashed over the country.. Henry, thei elder sc, resiguned.his olice and surprised-us all by appeirg one' afternoon withoust' previopec notice. The warm family greeting 6ver, ienry' called his brother out for a walk. asndforgotfhl' that "littlepitchero have ears,' they, allowed me to auinter aloag. 'At the spring we all Idraniit, and thoen followed a ,long traip li the shade of the locustas.' I alriost let' out a REhout of mingled terroi and surprise whona, I heard.

A few days later Charles rode forth' on his own horse, a gallant black, of iKentucky- lincesgo, and everybody agreed that no finer,' braver boy would do battle for the union. ie joined the liinggold Cavalry. Early in the war Ice' was ,leftwosnded on the ild, anid was kindly cared for by a southern family. His chief nurse was a pretty little rebel with soft. wavy hair, grecat brown eyes, inviting lips,oand a disposition as cheery as tIhe clear sunshine after an April shower. No woman had a right to roeietlthat big, brave, handsome fellow, and there the union soldier was betrothed to the bewitelhing champion of socession. Then Annie, for that was her name, began to correepouci with Muth,? and through this intangible link of connection the whole family fell in love with the littlecon.. federate. Charles rejoined his troops 's soon as able. After a desperate engagecciiet his company was scattered, and he was Ieinmed in onevery side,' except where the rugged moucitains 'of Vir ginia towered 'op bobeiadn im. Boldly he turned the black, went flying over foot- paths,, leaping chasms,' and :forcing his way where few could follow.

Then grandmla would gently chide her, and say: "Theo should not judge. All these people are old friends of mine, and faithful." The fraud would turn up her nose and put on a look of contempt that always set me boiling.. One day at the spring she loaned over to use the clear water us a nirror, aInd' from- some where about her person dropped the big gold watch that Graudpa Waterson pri::ed most as au heirloom.

He had survived his sufferings after a long illnessan in the tfamily of a poor bult kind mountaineer, and there ho was, the picture of health, with Annie in his arms. I sprang into the saddle with a manincal yell. I got two little durkeys on behind ilue.

"God. bless thee, son," w1as all grnduna could say then, whlileo the good old gentlemoen blinked, tried tolook calm as the tears rolled down his checks, and then he sobbed.
