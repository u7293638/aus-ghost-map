MR BILLSON, M.L.A., AND PAYMENT OF MEMBERS. To the Editor of the Araus. Sir, — Thinking that the action in "another place" might give rise to some debate, I dropped iuto our " talkee" house this after noon. I was not disappointed. The drama was advanced another stage. I was an Ovens elector in the last election, and having voted far Mr Billson — in a certain critical division —I naturally watched him. Having a very distinct recollection bow emphatically he pro nounced against " payment of members," in the innocence of my heart I expected him to go with the " noes" to the left ; instead, he went stolidly with the " ayes" on the right. I say stolidly, for he held his head down as though intently studying the Appro priation Bill, when really, if the truth were known, sundry pledges given in St. George's Hall, Beechworth, come like unwelcome ghosts before his vision. Mr Billson made quite clear to many of us who voted for him that we were saj ing good bye to anything like an able or even intelligent discussion of what might be brought before the Assembly; but we were assured he was honest, could be re lied on, &c.;, and hence we voted for him, and so narrow was the majority by which he won, that perhaps it is not too much to say that had I and my friends not voted as we did the election might have gone the other way. Oh, Mr Billson, have you forgotteu that " be sure your sin will find you out ?" Nemesis, espe cially in politics in this part of the world, is swift footed, as Sir James M'Culloch found in the last election, and others will find in another election not far off. AN OVENS ELECTOR. Dec. 12.
