THE LOTTERY. Yours, &c.;, LOOK BEFORE YOU LEAP. Adelaide, 20th May, 1846. Gentlemen—Not being often in town, but still feeling disposed to try my chance in the groat lottery for the Law Offices, I availed my self of a summons to the Police Commis- sioaer*s Court yesterday to look at the premi ses, previous to investing; my six pounds ten. But «hai I there observed has led me to pause, till I know who is to keep the place, es pecially the roof, in repair, till the fortunate winner is in possession. Nearly a year and a-half will elapse, and I observed that the rain was pouring in upon the table of the Court, so as to drive every one away from it. He Com missioner himself would have stood a good chance of a gratuitous shower bath, if it had not been for a little covered semi- enclosure, something like the ghost of a watch-box, which partially protected htm. It is no business of mine perhaps, as I did not buy the ticket: but it I had done so, I should certainly be disposed to sell it for half-price. [We think oar correspondent is a little too fastidious. 1-et him try his luck. We will answer for it that a little rain will not wash away the valuable freehold, after which he seems to hanker, nor materially depreciate its value in the eyes of the fortunate winner.—. fcos.
