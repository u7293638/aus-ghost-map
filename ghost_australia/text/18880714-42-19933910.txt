Strayed or Stolen. Has any one seen a pair of eyes As blue as the sea 'neath Grecian skies, And sweet red mouth and teeth like pearl! Well, they belong to my little girl Bhe strayed away with a pretty pout, And I don't know what it's all about. I would give my life, were my life all bliat, To feel again on my cheek her kiss. Bhe strayed awuy on a summer morn, When only tb« ghost of a storm was born; And it was born in her eyes of blue. I don't know what in the world to do Without her smile and her soft caress, And her pretence my days and life to blesa, Bhe wan so fair, delicious, and sweet, That my heart never knew 'twas beneath her feet. Oh, she was so sweet—and she was so fair, With her lovely eyes and soft warm hair' And her dear little hands that fluttered so, And in which the dimples would come and fro, When huo opened them wide or shut them tight, When love or storms made her pink or white. There in only this: I must pray to Him To send her back in the tnlight dim. John Xrnbbt M'Canx.
