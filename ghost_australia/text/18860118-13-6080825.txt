SPORTING INTELLIGENCE. VICTORIAN CLUB RACE MEETING. The annual race meeting of the Victorian Club was held on the Flemington course on Saturday afternoon. The temperature was lower than it had been for the few previous days, and the sky was dull and threatening. Though the programme was a good one, and the prizes well worthy a contest, the attend- ance on the ground was very scanty. The Btnnd enclosure was fairly patronised, but tue hill and Hat presented a veiy b.ire appearance. The weather lortunntidy proved much more agreeable than wus anticipated irom the lowering aspect ot the sky. A thundcr Hlorni passed ovei the giounil about ri o'clock-, .ind .1 little i un íe'J, but not Biilticie-nt to be any discern lort, mid it cleared oil by the time tlie hist race was mer. The visitors to tins meeting experienced pre.it iiieonvenience Irom the disagreeable stenches Irom the various munumctciiies higher up the Salt- water Uiver. 1 lu» unple isant smell Iron) ihe abattoirs has often buen the cause ol com- plaint by \ îsitors to the J lemington course on re Snturdny nlteinoon, but neier betöre lins anything so bud been experienced as the smell brought don ii tho river by the brci/uon Saturday attcrnoon Hauy who could Ret iivvuy left the course, and Bcveial ladies toole rcluge in the lidies' room in a liiiif-faitning condition Kvery year the inconvenience irom tins cause seems to be increasing, and it might be worth the while of the V.H.C.

Vulcan was drawing up to the leader when he fell near the abattoirs, and gave Corrigan a \ery severe ahuKing, but toriuniitely with- out injuring bun seriously. Jioyal Maid blundereel at the last hurdle, anil Sink- ing Fund just beat her for second place. The Victorian Cold Cup brought out a field of 1!) starters, Bohemian being the most fancied. 'Plus, tis the hrst race, wus a runaway affair. Lavington went away w ith the lead on the word being grv en, and making every post a winning one, gamed u comfortable- victory. Claptrap looked dan- gerous near the distiuice post, but he totiltl not get UD at the hnish. 'ihe Two year-old Selling leuce resulted in a line snuggle between Se Paul mid Mumsuil, the formel gaining the victory by a hire head.
