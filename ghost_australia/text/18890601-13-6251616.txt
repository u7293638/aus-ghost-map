" PICTURESQUE VICTORIA. BY TELEMACHUS, THE BALLARAT COUNTRY. When all the said that all the area have scattered beneath the foundations of Ballarat is gleaned and once more distributed, the surface soil of the country round about will Biiatuin a more substantial and comfortable prosperity than the digging time ever knew So I heard a Ballarat farmer say many years ago, and so I venture to say myself, having now recently travelled over the face of that country and seen its beauty and its promise, and its length and breadth, which are equal to those of the greatest English county ; also its rich ness or carrying capacity , which are such as England never knew. The world does not know enough to Ballarat of to day, Victoria does not know enough, Melbourne does not know enough, or many more people would make up there for glimpses of beauty and draughts of health, and the tonic of a genuine winter, which tightens up all the hopes of being as the firing process the sinews of a strained horse " I thank God," said the philosopher Coleridge, that whatever may have been my bodily distempers and bowel disorders, my head hath been always as that of a great mountain aloft in the blue heaven and the clear sunshine." And so might Victoria say, if she were wise enough to recognise Ballarat as her head. We are lost in abundance of fresh air here, if not exactly in blue heaven. The wind bites till the nerves tingle, though it is but later May, and, as we leave the city behind, and strike out towards the lake country, the sun goes down behind heavy banks of cloud, which are scarcely shot through with the lurid afterglow, and the cap of the sky seems close, as if we had indeed risen somewhat nearer the earth. The pastures through our journey have a chilly appearance The horses and the cattle make for the shelter of the hedges, and stand there sulky or ruminant, with heads down, and stiff, staring coats One is by no means sorry when night comes, and with night the lighted windows of Mr. Bath's hospitable home of Ceres by -learmonth, with a long drive through a great garden, where tall cypresses stand ghost like, noel great round trimmed laurels as solid backs, where the odour of the flowers overpowers the heavy smell of the newly dug soil, and the wheels grate loud on the gravel and Unit at length by the open door. Mr. Bath is an old pioneer of Ballarat, farmer, miner, squatter, sheepbreeder, and last and best, perhaps, for comfort"s sake, quiet country gentleman, working his beautiful estate rather for amusement than for profit"s sake, and taking an occasional run home, just to see how the world is moving Mr. Bath has promised to show me this country, the development of which he has watched from the time the first furrow as turned, and therefore, in the morning, though it is still cold enough to make even an industrious man fall in love with the hearth, if not with the pillow, we start for a drive right round about the lake, and through us much of the surround- ing country OF we can manage to drive of say 40 miles I spoke of the cattle seeking the shelter of the hedges on the evening before, and must say now for the sake of intending bility to many readers, that this is a country of hedges, a country where fields are actually surrounded by hedges, where gorse is trimmed close over old fences, or whitehorn well Kept stands alone on the bank beyond the ditch, a secure fence against even the hungriest of marauding beasts Where elms and willows appear as if dead now beside the broad green lanes, and little coppices, one might almost say "spirits," run down from the roadway to the water's edge Ceres is chiefly subdivided with these live fences, except where the requirements of the stud stock have been minted little paddocks, two and three acre patches of English grasses, wonderfully dun!, and green now, for every thing is thoroughly saturated with the autumn runs The great prize sheep swathed in linen clothes, for fear of the slightest injury to their wool, rubble daintily for an hour or two, and then retire to their shed, where sweet hay and chaff always await their appetites Water, carefully garnered from springs and rainfall, is led by pipes to all these paddocks, and to the house and offices, and throughout the garden But we can not appreciate the blessing of water now. Our feet are wet with five minutes in the paddock It seems impossible that tiny grass eating creature should ever be thirsty, or any warm blooded animal levi hot in the outer air again If we are to be out attic we want to be wrapped and coated well We understand why nature stocked the woods hereabouts with opossums, and gave to the opossums such line furry routes We want all the opossum skins we can get, and had the man in the bingey more grateful than the softest velvet pile of nature's carpet A couple of miles takes us past two or three good substantial well tilled farms, with their hedgerows and trees, evidences of hard work and substantial prosperity. Then comes a lull and in view point which must not be missed his the "addle Back, across which runs a road too steep for buggy travelling, but not really serious to anything like stout and willing legs " 1 have climbed it many a hundred times,' says Mr Bath and it does not interest me much now, but you go up, and I will stay with the horses ' It is not altogether a pleasant thing to turn out from warm rugs towel grass, burnt) seemed to call here, and, answering the call, an abnntUnt reward was found. I should like to take every English visitor to the top of that saddle back, and should not at all object if the day were just such as that whereon I stood on its ridge His only, a pic must) climb 10 minutes from the base where the buggy shafts, and then appears a double view which is thoroughly Australian in its breadth and general for in, yet very English in its colour and almost phere. "learmonth to the right and Burrumbeet to the left-the one a picturesque little sheet of water, the other a line inland sea 40 miles in circumference Round about and far beyond the lakes has those peculiar rounded hills which stud the Creswick and the Daylesford and the "mental, and all this western Ballarat country, ploughed to their summits in places, and dotted, not Hedged, with too rare trees The Mount Bolton and the ] Ercildoune ranges are crainte, Bently narrated, or at least broken on their ridges into irregular lines. A gleam of sunshine strikes monten tarts) across Learmonth, and makes the grass) points running down to its benches shine, and its nulled surface Hush and glisten. But is is only a vagrant gleam There are clouds innumerable coming up with the increasing gale and the mt is patched over, and all the world is grey again, It is so grey over Burrumbeet now that one scarcely distinguishes the water from the clouds, but there is a line of yenBty foam far away, where the mimic waves break on the rocky shore And over all the level land which slopes from the lake to the foot of the hill dull green patches of grass and brown fallows are seen, with houses just distinguished through the mist, and trees, as tall are) sheeted ghosts A broad and fair country, but not to be compared with that which opens upon the other side which lies round about Learmonth and slopes up to the Ercildoune and the Mount Bolton mines. We see probably three score or a hundred homesteads here, and away beyond the lake is the village of Learmonth, with its abundant pines and well planted gardens, and occasional housewife gleaming white. There is "Ceres" limit its trees not far away, nearer Is the coppice, with its olive silvery wattle leaves, and sable places There are paddocks of the darkest chocolate that. There me them just flushed with the emerald of the baby blades of wheat and oats. There are fields dull brown with acreage of potato balm, and there are meadows green as any in the valley of the Thames It is almost an ideal agricultural landscape, and Is lightened and brightened and relieved by the 150a acres of water set in its midst It is the very opposite of the ordinary Australian landscape. It contains all that we usually luck and long for. How often have we seen just such bills as those-naked and clear and bald, reflecting the sun's rays like mounds of bare rock-such slopes and plains as those red and parched or strewn with white bones, or dotted with stumps of blue or cotton bush And apparently, only a little further removed, just such water as that with trees reflected in it or suspended in some mysterious fashion over its surface The water was mirage, all the rest grant stern reality It seems here that some ning clan s wand has struck across the land and blessed and changed it The form is the form of Australia but the face is the face of England Hemming from the article we drive again beside the lake, and us is to make the illusion complete, and to convince us that we really are not in Australia we come on two boat pulling and cleaning turnips-two inland with red cheeks but blue noses and lips, bitten, it braced with the cutting wind, as genuine young yokels as you would find in Uerl shire Iceland there is another little copse The shire council has improved all its opportunities in the way of copse making, and should have much credit to are for, for the one want of this country is trees 'those round hilltops should all be crowned with Rains, those broken ridges Hedged with pines there should be belts of trees on all the open lands which lie between the bills here and the city 'You can Iceland estimate their use whenever you get on the lee of any little clump It is lOdeg warmer instantly The grass would grow here, and the cattle can camp in comfort and content Judicious planting would indeed perfect the beauty of the landscape and materially in crease the value of all the land There would, I am told, have been much more planting, but that It lot of the reserves were grabbed In the original survey ample spaces were left about the lake, but one man fenced in a patch here and by some means secured a title. Another swindled the state out of a lot there on pretence of planting mulberry trees 'There was nobody to look out for the public, and so the public was robbed 'line seems to indicate bad government, or other wise ignorance or fraud Ignorance probably. 'I be powers that were neither knew nor cared what was going on, and so the power, which is, the shire council to wit, has very little scope for this good work of planting They tell us tree planting would have much effect on the climate here in the old Ballarat forest, not more than 20 miles away and at about the same altitude, there are 10 inches more rain in the year Hut to day we do not want any more rain ; we only want shelter and diversity in the land scope There are times, of course, when rain is wanted Who that has travelled this district in the summer does not remember the lake-the great Burrumbeet sheet of silver with the trees about its margin, black as the plumes of a hearse, all the plains around dry and cracked, and the scant grass as dry as the burnt up (iron til of the spring time in a midsummer in the inlands The cattle panting with the heat, the horses toiling very wearily along the dusty road, and the whole face of the country looking up pleadingly as in anguish for the rain which had been so long denied They tell me that tree planting will ultimately mend the climate and prevent any repetition of those droughts , but why did nature make those huge fresh water nearer years of Burrumbeet and Learmouth, in the midst of this fertile country'' Look at the whole history of its formation and preparation and you shall be more thoroughly convinced of the prevision and preordination of a beneficent spirit in nature, than by the most careful study of Paley's theology, You may trace the craters in June yet the mountain heads round about You may find the rearguard of their overflow in the rich volcanic soil over Renouf a of country and then, looking carefully around, you will discover that this is not a country of running waters, and therefore nature provided it with great fresh water lakes, and left to man their conservation, development, and use Many a million tons of water might, with a little care, be led into Burrumbeet and Learmonth, and these joint supplies, proper!) utilised, would miles to give to all the surrounding country those few extra inches of water which ensure certain crops of all sorts, and enable the farmer to laugh at the threat of the brazen sky, and, indeed, to welcome the heat which plumps, burdens, and flavours his granD, roots, and fruits What would be the value of the land of all the fertilising power of these two lakes were occasionnllvpoured forth on it' Cleared and in good condition it is now north Italian acre It yields 10 tons of potatoes and 50 bushels of oats, or from two to three tons of hay to the acre, and I do not know what it would yield in fruit The yield of small fruit IS enormous almost incredible A couple of days ago I walked through the garden of the Orphan Asylum in Ballarat an institution of which the city is deservedly proud-and noticed a little patch of gooseberry trees, less than the eighth of an acre. The manager told me that they had made in the Benson news of jam from that patch raspberries and currants are equally prolific, and apples, pears, and peaches grow as in England or in Nor mundy Hut the farmers here do not take to fruit Many even of these decent Scotch and long headed folk who occupy and own the Learmonth side have scarcely a fruit tree about their houses, and those who have orchards do not seem to cherish or tend them with any special care The orchards seem sadly in need of some service of hoe and spade, and very few of them bear any traces of the pruning knife or of orderly growth Hut there will be a change in all these matters by and bye We drive along through large and small farms TO acre blocks, which main tam families in comfort even if they pay 10s per annum an acre rent, and two and three hundred acre freeholds, whose proprietors are substantial men, much respected by storekeepers and bank managers, and as firmly li ml to the soil as any seaman of the Midland counties of England. There is a rumour abroad that there will be open times for more of them to settle by and by, us it is proposed to cut off another strip around the foot of the 1 rendering Hills, and to subdivide it into farms We may earnestly hope that it will prove true, for nothing better could happen Ballarat than the subdivision of every square mile on Ercildoune that is suited to agriculture Die model million is exceedingly beautiful, but it does not do much for the town or the district, and if Sir Samuel Wilson should take felOO 000 for the ten thousand acres life and devote that sum to the improvement of his vast Riverina properties, he would do more, perhaps, to justify his him to a peerage than by entertaining the theft of 1 England for a half century Men of experience and good business standing in Ballarat tell me that 10000 acres of the best of the 1 ercildoune land would find purchasers at k20 an acre on tins but, so highly and justly do men appreciate the value of this rich country, and so well have those prospered who have ever treated it with care We skirt the Ercildoune hills, and cross the railway line which runs out to Waubra, once known as The Springs, and which by and by will be pushed on to the Amphitheatre, n well timbered country) which will formans a-year tomme supply the demands of the Ballarat lilies and then by a three chain store he road make good pace towards the village of Learmonth Mount Holton is on our left granite country lightly timbered, but very green and bright now and beautiful in the early spring with innumerable wattle blooms The grey sheet of the lake was on our right, with all its farina and held rising on the slopes of the hills And soon we reach the village which it was the name better than most of the clusters of dwellings dotted about Australia. It is but one long street, but the street is planted on either side with pines and English In is It has three churches, and all are mantled with Ivy from inundation to roof Unit The gardens are full of shrubs and winter flowers Chrysanthemums just dying, a few sparse wintry blooms on the roses, but violets making all the air fragrant, and (billiards, In sheltered nooks, giving out its rare perfume What does it back to make it village indeed " Just that which every other township of Australia lacks the teal dent settled working population 'the shepherd, and the ploughman), and the gardener, with the few tradesmen to supply their wants settled in their own costs, tilling their own garden plots, sending their children to the village school, breeding up for us a race of good agricultural labourers and domestic servants, and living themselves a wholesome, thrifty hie though by no means penurious or means He would be a very good Australian who would initiate a line of that sort on or adjacent to his estate, who would rather build a cottage and fence a garden for a married man, than find a book for the ordinary swngmtin-ti pioneer, I think, in the way in which Australia JiiRJ and suffers most painfully It is very quiet at Ceres to do) only the wind is boisterous and noisy, rustling down the few late leaves on willows, elms, and oaks, moaning in the pines, and making the Dry leaved laurels pasturing talk loud almost as the wash of lake waves on a pebbly beach As the evening closes the desire 19 for great fires and drawn curtains and that pleasant family life which only grows where winds bite keenly, and nature in the chill of evening seems with all its voices and powers to chide us within doors And we always do well to obey the voice of nature, it is just as wise to seek the fireside in the winter at Ballarat as to move out to the freshness and coolness of the parks in January at Melbourne. But they tell me that Ceres will see another Bight on Saturday next for on that day the Ballarat Hunt meets at the hospitable, old home Scarlet coats will Hit across the fields and fly the fences there All the folks of the neighbourhood will crowd the rooms Tables will be spread for all comers in diningroom and hall and, if necessary, in barn and store Every man who passes will look in and will be welcome And the roof tree will ring with " John Peel, and the hounds will be cast off at the gates, and the merry procession will sweep away over furrow and fallow, and hedge and lence, and if it be just such a day as this there will be contrast of colour to delight the soul of an artist, anda "est and spirit which would have satisfied that hard riding, straight speaking, scholar, poet, and divine, Charles Kingsley. This is indeed a day thrilling with the very inspiration which produced his one to the north was wind ' "love thou bleak nor easter, "haine it is to see, Ode to every myilly r "e of a strain to the Come as came our fathers Heralded by letter , . Oonquorliig from the Eastward, Lords of land and sea. Blow and strong within us Stir the \ things blood , Bracing brace and attic "low thou wind of God "There is a something in that rattling rhyme, too, about hunting which I cannot remember exactly, but one verse comes back in which a sportsman's praise is given to the goodly hounds " Chime, y o dappled darlings, Urivtii the roaring blast Ye shall see a fox die Kro an hour is past. The dappled darlings of the Ballarat hunt tire never privileged to see a fox die, though there are foxes enough in the country now It is here but the drug hunt the furious riding after the nasty smell Doubtless there is a reason for it. The country is not yet fit for fox bunting There are fences which are not legitimately negotiable, and the stony hills would hit order too speedy and sure cover for the for as for the money. In any case no reasonable man will as sert that there is any lack of pluck amongst our Australian riders, and those who have occasionally seen the lady members of the hunt picked out of a bog on the other side of a stiff post and rather, and mounted and sent away again, will not deny that their nerve and pluck are equal to any ordinary occasion The railway-the Ballarat Waubra branch line-takes us back to town by a somewhat different route to that by which we drove out We skirt Mount Blowhard, we send along by the Dowling Forest racecourse, an oval of emerald now We pass miles of the same rich soil until we enter the mining country proper, and exchange mullock heaps for homesteads, and old poppet heads for growing trees Then come the poorly built outlying suburbs, and quickly enough the shafts and the roofs, the dirt, and the smoke of the city I am not in love with the city, returning from that country journey I do not care for the trade of the stock exchange or the talk about the mines One feels like that farmer 1 nar whom King Olaf found " Ploughing beneath the Morning Star " Ilotltlcn grey was the garb she wore, And by the Hammer of Thor lie there, He hated the narrow town and all its fashions, " but he loved the freedom of his farm, Ills air at night by his "reside warm Gudrun, his daughter, with her flaxen tresses , " He loved his horses and his herd? The smell of earth and the song of birds, Ills well filled barns, his brook with its water creases' Everything about good farming on good land seems comfortable, prosperous, and might be beautiful and artistic. Eitrming makes the whole face of the land smile and laugh, and exhale sweetness and fra grapes and yield good sustenance for man and beast There is no tail to farming From the lord or the owner of the soil to the meanest land, every man must do his duty and earn his salt he is not so with mining There is now to that pioneer Australian his tory almost as much of a tail as trails behind the turf What would those diggers of old, who hated idle men is thieves, say to the crowds who now live, practically without labour, on the Barkly curtailed proud of the diggers' labours who hunt for news like bookmakers' touts, and use it when obtained with no more scruple or compunction 1 feeding every man who falls into their hands, and using his purse whenever they get a chance ' These are not the legitimate brokers of course no well informed man would "dream of missing am disparaging remarks about them They are but the tail of the 1 Exchange, but I fear me in Ballarat as in Melbourne, the tail is terribly thick and wilfully long I do not know, However, that there is any reasonable ground of contention between of mining and farming '1 law should rather help each other The miner takes the land which generally is not of mut is up to the farmer and naturally he made in the ensuing tion of the farmer H produce, but the thing which is both puzzling and lamentable is the tremendous enterprise, the increasing in courii(,enient, bestowed on the one, and the indifference with which the majority of men reg with, other Whoever heard of joint stock farming compaines of "IO 000 sub urn had to first the rain bearing capacity of any pay or of bush land The Farmer st nights s along And only very rev early, in the matter of irrigation, has he or have I any public recognition or state aid. But let us suppose for a moment that farm ing was supported as mining is supported that subsidies were offered for every acre of eli tired forest land which would yield a pay ing crop of wheat that joint stock companies were formed to work difficult tracts and u farmers exchange existed in every town with the one idea always before it of drugging money into farming investment A farmers' exchange, a corn exchange Do you remember those institutions in every country town in 1 against Can you recall the style and the fashion of the people who used to throng them-the decent doubting, the kindly com- panorama, the healthful atmosphere of the place'' And will you not join in the hope that in Ballarat and "Sandhurst and every other natural centre of a great agricultural district in Victoria we may some day me such an exchange triumphant, and the stockjobbers relegated to the back slums I know that in the mining countries it is rank heresy to think and to speak and to unite in this fashion, but still I believe that the spirit of true prophecy goes all in HUH way 'I take the estimate the most favourable that can be made, of the yearly value of gold in the Ballarat district-and remember that this includes Clunes and 'sinea ton, Creswick and Maryborough, and is the product of the labour of not less than PROUD working miners and it is certainty not more than in 000,000 - noble sum, but how much does it absorb in its production '' How much is paid in calls lion much expended in commissions ' Make all those matters prac treat farm labourers, all those brokers, manu gera, investors overseers or proprietors of army Expend the labour of, say, "0,00. men on 500 000 acres of good agricultural land, and I imagine the returns would very far exceeding million pounds Still, it is neither necessary nor wise to stir up a spirit of antimonial Only one is disposed to say, looking at the neglected condition of the farming industry about Ballarat and the tremendous enthusiasm about the mining, "Tills ought ye to have done, but not to have left the other undone."
