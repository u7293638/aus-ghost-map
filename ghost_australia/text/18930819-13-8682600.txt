AUSTRALIAN WOMEN. (BY JULIA V. NICHOLSON, IN THE NORTH AMERICAN REVIEW.) Imagination pictures a new type in a new land The pity of it is that the reality falls short of expectation Australian women to be sure work out their destiny in the newest of new lands but in these latter days when one end of the world so to say touches the other originality IS heavily handicapped I external influences ore for ever beating on Australian shores American and English examples new o) B present are as inimical to the production of original and striking characteristics us civilisation according to Macaulay is to the production of the most poetic poetry Australian women aspire to the freedom and indepen- fence of American women and stand in awe of the presence and traditions of ] rightly women The result is a character moulded b) conflict n" influences reflected through the coloured medium of Australian conditions Transition stages are rapid in Australia. The twilight Hits across the hills and plains, and ghost-like disappears The Jiafiefe'of childhood slips away before short frocks lengthen into long gowns It is daylight or darkness infancy orwomanhoodhere Before the J English girl has outgrown childish delights the Australian is a woman in miniature self conscious self con I dent not easily abashed with eyes that long since have ceased to look out up in the world with wonder In a short skirt with a plait down its back noting Australia imitates its elders flirts falls in love and sometimes reads and writes funny little love letters in all serious near Very youthful very innocent all this in its way but the war) itself strikes one as just a little precon ones I lic her brother the Australian girl has a say as to what she learns where she goes what she wears In fact she brings herself up under easy supervision Grown to womanhood the glitter and glamour of life already tarnished in her sight, she is without reserve possessed of few illusions and less sentiment She has arrived it a very good opinion of herself So far as circumstances permit she pleases herself in the choice of a bus) and for a course in life But with all her liberty she does not enjoy the recognised freedom and independence of the American girl The social code is "lightly) confusing For an unengaged girl to go to the theatre or for a walk alone with a man would be scandalous but at a dance she may wander about d i garden and verandah, with a new acquaintance and it is quite another thing She marries at any age short of middle age but it is not into greater freedom as the French woman but into bondage after the most up proves British fashion family) cares and household duties absorb her servants worry her The happy Knack of elevating life into parts and containing, many interests has yet to be acquire 1 Accompl ailments are neglected dancing goes to the wall for real mp there is no time but should domesticity fail to engross her and the giddy whirl of society sweep her aw ft) from home the household 1 becomes a scene of disorder her haps this is why the average domesticated Australian becomes so uninteresting after marriage Her life narrows down she seldom shares her husbands in terests her conversation fluctuates between scandal an 1 Servants delinquencies fashions and the children Her days are wanted by tea an 1 gossip with visits and occasional entertainments thrown in Unless a fashionable woman she no longer troubles to be pretty) or charming and it is unusual for her to keep herself as coin and of passing events and the questions of to day, or to give more than an occasional glance at a newspaper Though pretty tall and well formed the Australian is not graceful Her feet are seldom small her hands rural) beautiful Moreover she does not dress well her toilette lips none of the chin of the Parisienne s little-of the sobriety of the long lishwoman Over-dressed or down) sheer duces the impression of not only having little taste but no artistic sense of the fitness of things stylish and elegant women are to be seen more frequently in Melbourne than elsewhere Nevertheless dress is dear to the soul of an Australian and much is spent on it Down in the lower social grades it plays an important part the Australian hugs the idea of equality and believing in uniformity of dress is the visible sign of equality often sacrifices actual comfort to obtain fashionable clothing An Australian family makes a brave show on holidays there may be bare feet and rags in the house but there are cheap feathers and gloves in the street Here the vanity of the race peeps out, and hatred of apparent social distinctions for vanity is stronger in the Australian woman than ambition just as indolence is more inherent than energy She is clever but not intellectual accomplished oftener than highly educated to be able to play the piano is regarded as a sort of cachet of distinction, not to play it as a lamentable sign of neglected education 1 act is natural to her usual quick sense of perception With the ready ease wherewith a troubled changes its colour into harmony with that of its surroundings she adapts her self to circumstances catches the care of her entourage and continues to produce a tax our able impression With a cheerful disposition and mercurial temperament, the serious side of life scarcely appeals to her Foreseeing not that to sow the wind is to reap the whirlwind she exacts neither obedience not due reverence from her children and without being specially religious leaves the responsibility of their future very much to Providence Thus some of the finest feelings that bind the human race together become destroyed and a spurious sort of independence loosenB family) ties in Australian households Though hardly capable of strong feeling and deep passionate attach ment the Australian is affectionate and in manner hospitable friendly and sometimes s) -pathetic Strangers to day to

there is a was of sound in the voice Often there is slung on her lips not the slang of society merely but of the Stock fired the camp fire and the stable It may be heard in the drawingroom of society, for polished manners are not found as a matter of course in prominent races Here men and women are shaken like dice in a box chance decides the throw Culture and refinement may dwell in the humblest homes and the veriest plebeians amidst luxury Australia is the land of many grotesque contrasts and some unique social surprise.
