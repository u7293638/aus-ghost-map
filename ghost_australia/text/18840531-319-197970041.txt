But I. : know liis character, and you know it ; that is enough. I shall not warn you again," With theso words, I walked, to my den. There, once alone, I gave way to my over- ! mastering agitation. I found myself trembling liko a leaf ; looking iu a mirror, I saw that I was pale as a ghost. . , An hour passed thus. Then I' heard a) knock at the door. Bntor Baptiato. ( "Well, what do you want ?" I cried, angrily ' enough. ' . : ) ; ; , Before I knew it he was on his knees, seising' aud kissing my lianil. . . "Scilor, I know everything ho cried, ; "I - havo known it all along.

Then, kissing lior aunt again, and leaving lior inuoh relieved in mindshe went away, strolling quietly In tlio direction, of the vioar- ago.- As sue walked, her tears coutiuued tb fall, nnd her face-: was very sorrowful ; for. there lay upon her spirit a heavy ahnilow of terror and -distrust. With Iioiv different an ..amotion had she, only n year before, down to meet tho man sho loved 1 Iioiv eagerly and gladly, then, ho had awaited lior coming ! And now Alas, she did not oven know if she would Gnd liim nt all. Sometimes ho seciuod to avoid her, to he weary of her company. All was so changed, she reflected, sinco the Hnltlnncs camo homo to the Manor. Ho wns no longer the same, and sho herself was different. \Vbulil it ever end ? AYould she over be happy agaiu? The slinilows of night wore falling as sho walked through tho lanes, with licr eyes sadly fixed oil thu dim spiro of tho village ehurcli, Closo til a plantation on the roadside, bIio encountered a. woman nnd n man iu conversa tion. She recognised tho woman at a glanco n» Sal Bexluy, tlio blaok sheep of the pariah, who got hov liviug by singing from one public- house to another ; and she had passed by without a word, whon a voice called her, "Here, mistress !" She turned, and encountered a pair of bold black eyes. Sal, the pariah, stood facing her, swinging her old guitar and grinning mischievously. "I'm afraid you're growing proud, mistress1 You didn't seem to know inc." ' -There was somothing sinister in the girl's manner. Edith droiv. asido, and would have passed on without' aiiy. reply, but the other ran before lior and blocked tho way, "No, you don't go liko Hint. I want a word with lliec, my , fine, lady; All, you may" toss your head, but you'd ''best' bide a bit, aud' liston." ... "What do yon want?1. 1 cannot stay." i'No call to Hurry," cried Sal, with a coarse laugh. " Thy man's out, and don't expect thee. Belike ho's -gone", courting some oiid else. Ah, lie's a ram chap, the minister, though' ho do set up for n saint." Edith shuddered and shrank hack. . "Go away," she! said,1. "How :dare yon,; speak tb me like that?" "Dare'? ' That's a good one? No, yon shsn't pass, till I've done ivi! thee." , Edith was getting positively 'frightened, for tho girl's manner was so rudo and threatening, when she , bow a' t'all- figure approaching, and in a moment recognised tho clergyman. He was close' to . them, and paused in astonish ment at seeing the, two together. . \- " Mias .Dove ! Is", anything tho matter ? AYiiy are yon here, so late, anil in such com pany!" , , . . He paused, looking suspiciously at Sal, who laiiglied impudently, . : "I was pissing by,, and she stopped me. Do seml her away : "Send me away.?"', oriel. the pariah. "I'll 'come" when I please, and I'll go when.' I please.! I'm as good as she." ' . Mr,. Santloy .stepped forward, and placed his hand on her arm, . '!), , . ' " What are you , doing . liero ? I thought yon were far away," '. .... 7 , " So I were j but I've come back. AVell ?" .'.'Remember what jl) told. you., I will not havo my pnrish disgraocd!nny..'lbnger by yonr cohilubt. . I. have, wairned you repeatedly before. Where are you staying?" "Down by '.the .river- side, master. . Iyo joined the gipsies, "d'ye see."' " Always an outcast,'.' said Santley, with a : certain gloomy.: pity," .".Will nothing reform you?" . /-.J, " . . ; ' . " No,' master," aris'were'd the girl, grinning. ; "I'm a bad lot." ' ' "I'm afraid yon aro." -. . ! , ; !. "But mind this," she': continued, with some v'ehamence, " there's others, fine ladiea too, as 'bad as mo. Though,. I like a chap, and ain't afraid to own it, and thbugli I'gots my living, anyhow, I'm no worse than iny. betters, masterj ; You've, no cause to bully" «tii, :so don't try \ \- oil, master.! I can Bpealc wberi I like, and .1 can. hold my! tongue - when I like. ! Gi' me , a guinea, and I'll hold my, tongue." She held out her. brown hand, leering, up into his face. . . : " What do you. mean 5" ho exclaimed, "I shall give you no money," , : , She looked round at Edith, who stood, by trembling.' "Tell him he'd best, mistress — for thy sake 1 Como, it's worth a guinea I There's many a folk hereabonts would ei' five, to see what I saw t'other day, down to Omborley wood." " . Edith started in a new terror, while lior -face flushed scarlet and lier head swam round. Santley.winced, but preserving his composure, looked fixedly and sternly at. the outcast, "You're a bold hussy," fie said, botween his set teeth,' "as bold.as bad,' But tako care ! Do you know that /if I.only .say. one word, I can have you up before the : magistrates and .sent back to prison !" . ) '.'What for?" snarled the girl. . " . . "Eor Vagrancy,' "begging and threatening ' a , lady, on the roadside i" . .'."..! " A uretty lady. And I boant begging, neither, AYell, rsend- me ,:to prison, and when l'm up, before the .magiatrates, I'll toll, 'em why you were)down nppn ms. Como 1" ! Santley "was abo'ut' to reply angrily, when Edith interposed," Trembling and almost fainting, she had taJterijOnt her purse. 7 .. ' " Here is some mdnpy," she cried ; " give it to her and let lier'go t'\\. ) " She does not deserve a farthing," ex- :claimcd Santloy,' "Still, if you.wish it-—-" ) . ".Yes,.ye8 1 I—I am'.aofy for her" 'Santley opened the purse and 'took out a sovereign. ; . -' 1 . "If I. give you this, ,|U you promise to! go out of the parish !" '. " ! ' j —''Maybe.". . / . ... . ' " " And to conduct yourself properly— to turn over li new leaf ?" , . / . Sal grinned viciously JCfom ear to' ear. "I tako example by you, master, and your young lady there 1 , i.eastivayB, if I do go a larking I'll bo like you gentry, and say nought about it. There, gi' me tlio guinea! Stop, though, make it two, aud I'll go away out o' Omberly this very night." Santloy and Edith rapidly exchanged a look, and a second pieco of gold was at once added to tho first. Then, after giving Sal. a few words of Eolemn warning, iu his priestly chm-acter, Santley walked away with Edith. The pariah girl wateheil them until they disappeared; then, with alow laugh, she re joined her companion, a one eyed and middle- aged gipsy, who, during tlio preceding scene, hud phlegmatically stretched himself on his hack along tho roadside. .
