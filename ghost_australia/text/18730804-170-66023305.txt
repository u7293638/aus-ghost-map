Before the elements got into such a bluster- ing humour we were favored with the most lovely weather, and selecting a fine day for our trip, made an early start for Mount Bischoff. We are camped—for everyone who stretches a bit of rag over a stick calls it a camp— about five miles (by the road) from that now celebrated mountain. We went over several of the sections and were highly gratified at the sight of so much mineral wealth. There is enough of the metal to make tin pots for the whole world for some time to come. In one of the tents, lying near the fire warm- ing itself, was a huge nugget said to weigh two hundred and sixty pounds, or 'there- abouts. I attempted to lift it, but this terrestrial planet had a firm grip on the ugly lump ; so I pulled, and the planet pulled, till at length I was forced to give the planet best ; gravity was too much for me, I couldn't raise the ponderous mass from the ground. It was here we made our first acquaintance with the famous horizontal scrub. An end- less network of stems, generally several inches in diameter, stretch out horizontally at various distances from the ground, vary- ng from a few inches to several feet. From these others shoot up into the air, forming a most uninviting barrier. A short scramble through this "so much talked of" scrub was sufficient to impress one with the conviction that an exceedingly small portion of it would go a remarkably long way. We ascended to the top of the moun- tain, and found ourselves on a small rocky platform a few feet square. The panoramic view from this elevated posi- tion was very beautiful. The day being clear and bright, a large extent of country was visible, some very jagged and picturesque mountains were basking in the sunshine down away south ; their rugged outline would have greatly rejoiced the artist's eye. I would I were an adept with the pencil, but, alas! the only things I can draw artistically are corks, and now, with these new fangled inventions yclept "pa- tent levers," all the old delight of cork drawing is quickly passing away. How lovingly of yore would the knees grasp the semiopaque vitreous flask—for they've a terrible weakness for good liquor, have knees. flow often a man finds that while he has managed to keep his hood clear and his utter auce iittluql, Ills le/j- hare got horribly intoxicated and behave tbcnisclrcs in the moBt absurd and extravacant manner on KBllllluUl'; -Vp&tlKik; rIHnV~tiiiliBBtBifr refusing to get up again, and performing all sort! of undflmificd antics.
