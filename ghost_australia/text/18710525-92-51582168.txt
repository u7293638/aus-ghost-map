j TBE TIMES ON NAPOLEON. THE Timts, speaking of the Emperor j Napoleon, observes :-" Tho character of Napoleon III. will long remain one of the enigmas of history. Weaker in its composition (lian that of Iiis uncle, it will be universally allowed hereafter-os thoso who can rise above prejudice allow -that it cooUius better clements. No misgivings ever disturbed the serene selfishness of the First Emperor. Ile could sacrifice armies and nations with- out compunction. The ghosts of tho lons of thousands who died for his ends never haunted bis conscience. Ile could leave an army buried in Ibo snows of liussia, and warm bis hands before a fire at Warsaw with no other thought than I ' This is better than Moscow.' Tho exile who will Roon be among us possessen little of this compact strength. Always halting sud irresolute of purpose, and never,more eo than during the last months of his reign, he has been averse from war, and only entered into the contest with Germany because be dreaded what might otherwise bc thc resentment of France. In his heart he bas believed iv tho fulfilment of thc cloudy dreams of hts early manhood. Ile anticipated France in the inaugura tion of free trade, as we shall 'probably soon find by the adoption of a retrograde policy. His avowed detestation of the Treaties of 1815 was in a confused way mixed up with the rights of nationali- ties upon which he rested bis claim to rule France. If, indeed, we compare the present fugitive with the refugees of 1830and 1848, apart from the terrible disasters which his last great fault hoB brought upon France, we may bo induced to think that ho deserres to bo received with as ' much respect as they. The Citizen King showed how little he cared for thc interests of nations when he sacrificed Â¡Spain to enrich a son, and Charles X. was innocently incapable of looking upon subjects except as mnlti tudes born to obey his will."
