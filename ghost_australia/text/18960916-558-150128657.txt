A EALLARAT GHOST. A 44 ghost scare," which lias occasioned I considerable amusement in B&ilurat;, occurred ; the other night among a number of the cab- j men plying for hire betvrewn the city and the i new cemetery. It was approaching midnight j and the Jehus had drawn their vehicles up j in line at the cemetery gates preparatory j to setting out on their last return trip to j Ball a rat. The night was dark and squally, j and one of the drivers, gazing listlessly into j the cemetery, was startled tc> see, as he be- I lieved, a moving figure carrying a lighted j lantern, which flashed 41 like a beacon on the sea coast-" Addressing his mates in the 1 rank, he cried out—44 As I live boys, see the j ghost over yonder- I*et us all scoot home as last as we can-" Several jumped into their vehicles on seeing the apparition and drove off post haste towards the city. Two 44 brave fellows," however, remained to 44 lay out" the ghost. Entering the cemetery grounds they wended their way along one of the winding paths in the graveyard, when the glare of | the light44 widened out," and they came to a standstill to hold a consultation, and it was decided to 4 4 report the ghost " to the sexton, Air Rattray, who resides within the cemetery enclosure. Housed from Ms clumbers he ridi culed the fears of the cabmen, one of whom.— i a nervous Hibernian—assured Air Rattray, that a ghost was 44 walking around," and described its get up and dimensions vividly. The sexton invited the cabby to •44 come and see." 44 No fear," was the reply, 44 we'll not go up towards that thing with the lan tern." On reaching the gates the sexton, sure enough, saw a kind of illumination away back some 300 yards in the cemetery, and striking a direct line towards it he walked up to find that the supposed 44 ghost" was merely a newly erected headstone of polished marble, on which were reflected the rays of a street lamp, fully a quarter of a mile from the cemetery fence.
