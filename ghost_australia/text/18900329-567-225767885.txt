If her blind strength of human Jove conld so overstep the boundarieb of human power, and, by the sheer might of its volition, mock -the physical (bar- nam tkaf. karnmml Una .«wl..a L V _t _ «a«w uvhiuiou uct au, wuitviUHl oae to fear from distance, from separation, ay, from death itself ? She had grasped a clue which might, one day, before the seeming end or after — what did it matter ?— lay strange secrets ' open to hsr gaze. She had heard a whimper in an unknown tongue that could still be learned, answering Life's agonizing' ciy with a song of glory. If only he jived her, some day all would be well. Some day the barriers wonld fall. Crpmbiling with the flesb, they would fall and est her naked spirit free to seek its ojther self. And then, having found her' love, \- what more was there to seek? What other answer did sho desire to' all I the problems of her life than thts of Unity attained at ' last — Unity attained in Death ! ! And if he did oot love her, bow could be answer her ? Surely that message could not pass except along the golden cord of love, which ever makes' its sweetest music wheu Pain strikes it witn a nana ot rear. The troubled glory passed — it throb bed itself away ; the spiritual gusts of thought grew continually fainter, till, like the echoes of a dying harp, like the breath of a falling gale, they slowly sunk to nothingness. Then wearied with an extreme of wild emotion- Bea trice sought her bed again and presently was lost in sleep. When Geoffrey woke on the next morning, after a little reflection, be came to the decision that he had experienced a very Cations and moving jisud. con sequent on the exciting events of the previous day, or on the pain of his! Im pending departure. He rose, packed his bag — everything else was ready — and went in to breakfast. Beatrice Bid not appear till it was half over. She looked very pale, and «aid tbat she had been packing Effie's things. Geoffrey noticed that she barely touched hie fingers when he rose to shake hands with her, and that she studiously avoided his glahcel Then "hebegan to wonder if she also had JAtangely dreamed. " ' !" " ' Next came the hustle of departure. Effie was despatched in' the fly with the luggage and Betty, the fat "Welsh ser vant, 10 -look after her. Beatrice and Geoffrey were to walk to the station. ' Time for yon to be going, Mr. Bing-, ham,' said Mr. Granger. ' There, good bye, good-bye ! God bless you ! Never had such charming lodgers before. Hope you will come baok again, I'm sure. By the way, they are certain to shm- mons you as a witness at the trial of that villain, Jooes.' ' Good- bye, Mr. Granger,' Geoffrey answered ; ' you mast coaie and see . me In town. A change will do you goojL' . ' Well, perhaps I may.

' In another minute he had left the; Vicarage and, with 'Beatrice at his sjde, was walking smartly towards the sta tion. ' This is very melancholy,' he said, after a few momenta? silence. ' Going away generally is,' she an swered — ' either Tot those kvho go : or those who stay behind,' she added. ' Or for both,' he added. Then came another pause ; he broke it. .. ! ' Miss Beatrice, may 1 write to you t ' Certainly, if yoa like.' ' And will yon answer my letters P 'Yes, I will answer them.'

' Beatrice;' he said in a half whisper, 'what do. they mean, what cau they mean ?' 'As much as anything else, or as little,' sbe answered.

' Here is the statioa,' said Beatrice. 'and Betty is quarrelling with the fly man.' Five minutes more and Geoffrey was gone. CHAPTER XVI. TSE FLAT NBAS THE KDGWAHE BOAD. Geoffrey's journey to . town was not altogether a cheerful one. To begin with, Effie wept copiously at parting with her beloved ' auntie,' as she called Beatrice; aud would not be comforted. The prospect of rejoining her mother and the vulnble Anne had no charms for Effie. They all three got on best apart. Geoffrey himself had also much to think abont, and found little satis faction in the thinking. He .threw his mind back over the events of the past few weeks. He remembered how he bad first seen Beatrice's face through the thick mist on the Red Rocks, aud how her beauty had struck him As no beanty. evhr ' had before. Then he thought of f.nA AfltOllfcnM aF fkni alitnnrManlr nn J of the desperate courage with which she had saved his life, almost at the cost of her own. He thought, too, of that scene when on "the following day he had en tered the room where she was asleep, when the wandering ray of light had waved from ber breast to bis own, when that strange presentiment of the ultimate intermingling of their lives had flashed upon . him, and when she had awakened with an unearthly greet ing on her lips. One by one, while Effie slowly sobbed herself to silence in the corner opposite to him, he recalled every phase and scene of their ever-growing intimacy, till the review culminated iu his mysterious experience of the past night, and the . memory of Beatrice's parting words. Of all men .Geoffrey was among those least inclined to any sort of superstition; from boyhood fas had been, noted for common sense, and a somewhat dis- liAliavinff him nf mmil Rnf tin Kail intellect, and imagination which is simply intellect etherealized. Without these, with his peculiar mental constitu tion, he would, for instance; probably have been a religioos scepticjjiaving them, he was nothing of the sort. So in this matter of his experience of the previous night, and generally of the strange andalmost unnatural sympathy in which he found himself with this lady, common sense and the results of his observation and experience , pointed to the whole thing' 'being nonsense— the result of ' propinquity, Sir, propinquity,' and a pretty face — and nothing more.' But here his intellect and his imagina tion stepped in telling him plainly, that it was not nonsense, that he had not merely made a' donkey "of himself over an hysterical or possibly, a. -love-sick girl. They. told', htm that Jjecausel a thing is a mystery it is not necessarily a folly, though mysteries' are "for the most part dealt in by fools. They sug gested that there may be many .thbtgs and forces above us and around ns, in visible as an electricTcarrent, intngible as' light, yet existent -and capaMe --cf manifestation under .certain rare, and favourable conditions. And was it not possible that puch. conditions shonld unite in a woman like Beatrice, who. combined in , hersallf a beauty 'of body which was only oat- passed by the beauty of her mind? It was no answer to say that most sf.omen conld never inspire the unearthly some ten hours past, or that most men conld never become aware of the inspira tion.

But the weak point of mysterious oc currences is that they lead nowhere, and do not materially alter the focts of life. One cannot, for ihstance, pie id a my- ; stery in a conrt of law ; so, .dropping the imaginative aide of the jsesliijisaas. beyond him, he came to its "practical aspect, only to find it. equally thorny.

And now Beatrice was gone, and he mnst come back to his daily toil, sweetened by Honoria's bitter complaints: of their poverty, and see her no more. The thought made Geoffrey's heart ache with a physical pain, but his reason told him that it was best so. After, ail, there were no bones brokeo ; there bad uccu uu auve aucucb, uu htoo, uv nuius that cannot be recalled ; whatever there was lay beneath the surface, and while appearances were kept np all was well. No doubt it was an hypocrisy, bnt then hypocrisy is one of the great pillart of civilisation, and how does it matter what the heart says while the lips are Bilent? The Recording Angel can alone read hearts, and he mart often find them singalarly contradictory and niir trnfltvnrfiiv wrifino Die of them, die of her dreams ! No, Beatrice wonld not die of them, and certainly ite shonld not. Probably . in the end she would marry that pious earthly lump, Owen Davies. It was not pleaaaut to think of, it was even dread-' ftil, but really if she were to ask him ins opinion, ' as a friend,' he should tell her it was tite best thine that she conld do. Of course it would be hypocrisy again, the lipH would give his heart the lie but when the heart risea in rebellion against the intelligence it must be sup pressed. Unfortunately, however, thongb a small member it is very strong. They reached London at last, and as had been arranged, Anne, the French bonne, met them at the station to take Effie home. Geoffrey noticed that she looked smarter and less to his taste than ever. However, she embraced Effie with an enthusiasm which the child - scarcely responded to, and at the same time carried on an ocular flirtation with a ticket collector. Although it was so . very early in the year for fogs, London was plunged in a dense glo >ra. It had been misty that morning st Bryngelly, and become mora and more so as the day advanced ; bnt, though it was not yet four o'clock, Loudon was dark as night. Luckily however, it is not far from Paddington to the flat near the Edsware Road, where Geoffrey lived, so haviog personally instructed the cabman, be left Anne to convoy Effie and the luggage, and went on to the Temple by Underground Railway with an easy mind. Shortly after Geoffrey reached his chambers in Pump Conrt the solicitor arrived as had been arranged, not his nncie — who was, he learned, very un well — but a partner. To his delight be ; then found that Beatrice's ghost theory was perfectly accurate ; the boy with the missing toejoiut had been discovered who saw the whole horrible tragedy through a crack in the blind ; moreover the troth had been wrong from him and he wonld be produced at the trial — indeed a proof of his evidence was already forthcoming. Also some speci mens of. the ex-lawyer's clerk's hand writing had beeu obtained, and were de clared by two experts to be identical with the writing on the will. Qae thins, however, disturbed him : neither the Attorney-General nor Mr. Candleton was yet in town, so no conference was possible tbat evening. However, both were expected that night — the Attorney General from Devonshire, and Mr. Oiuiidletohfro<a xbe '\35ntineijt ; so — the case being first on the list — it was arranged that the conference shonld take place at ten o'clock on the following morning. On arriving home Geoffrey was in formed that Lidy Honoris was dressing, and -had left a message esying he must be quick and do likewise as a gentleman ..was -coming to dinner. Accordingly he went to his own room — which was at the other end of the fiat — and pat on his dress clothes. Before going to the dining-room, however, heeaidogood-night to Effie — who was in bed, but not asleep —and -asked: her what time she had reached home. .AAV ,V UIIUUVQQ UWQy UXMVtJ I Effie said promptly.

"Here Geoffrey brokeib "without much ceremony: '- To him 'it seemed a dese cration to listen while this person was making his feeble jokes about" Beatrice. ' Well dear,' he said, addressing :hie wife, 'and what have yon been doing with yourself ail-this time ?' ' Mounting for you, Geoffrey; and em- joying myself exceedingly .in the inter-; vali - We have had- -a delightful time, have'- w'e not, Mr. Ddnstan ?

' Indeed !' be answered, reflecting the while tbat Lord Garsington might- as well have paid some of his debts before he spent eighteen hundred pounds on his drawing-room furniture. Then the Saint and Lady Honoria drifted into:, a long and animated con versation about their fellow guests, which Geoffrey scarcely tried, to follow. In- tieed -the dinner was a dull one for him, and he added little or nothing to the stock of talk. When his wife left the room, however, he had to say something, so they spoke of shooting. The Saint had a redeem ing feature — he was somewhat of a sportsman, thoagh a poor one;- and be described to Geoffrey anew pair of ham- merless guns, which he had bonght for a -trifling snm of a handred and forty gnioeas, recommending the pattern to his notice. ' Yes, answered Geoffrey. 1 1 daresay tbey are very nice ; but, you see, they are beyond me. A poor man cannot afford so much for a pair of guns.' ' Oh, if that is all,' answered bis guest ' I will sell you these ; they are. a little long in the stock for me, and yon can pay -me woenyoullke. " Or.'Haog 'it all, I have plenty of ganr.

Will you have a glass of sherry ? — no. Then shall we join Lady Honoria ? This speech quite crashed -the vnlgar but not ill-meautDg Saint, and Geoffrey was sorry for it a moment after he' had mads it. Bat he was weary and ont of temper.
