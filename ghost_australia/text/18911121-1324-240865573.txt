The National Literal Federation held "its annual meetings last week at Newcastle-on- Tyne. Dr. Spence Watson presided over the Raftering is fevs 91P! A great effort totfl ovfiriasio tte jSKfSiliHg J>c!iłioil indifFerence. The leaders of the party were present in force, and in Tiew of the &£{>rttaching general election, strenuous efforts were made by them to set fo:tb their programme in an attractive form. It is unnecessary record the series of resolutions in which this iwaa attempted. We have become familiar With : most of them. More importaiit was the great speech delivered by Mr. Gladstone, in. which he set bimself, not -without sign's bf strain and inconvenience, to give a provkioiiSl outline of his programme for the t.-óraiing campaign. The veteran leader has evidently learned during the last twelvemonth that hi? party must show themselves to be in advance of their opponents in regard to British as well as Irishpolitics. In this speech, Irish HomeRtde did not occupy the first place. The orderu which the topics were ^treated-.is asfollows:— ,. -"- - ' . .1. Shortened duration of Periiaments. ^ _ ^ _ _uor- traf[ic~laWB on the l'option and local veto. Iiment in Scotland and Wales. Mrf-the House of Lords. /' ate&r; Ireland. nentjof electoral registration, and fv'sof the pritóple -of -one man one jfnchisement ofTodgers. ^an expenseeicom public ientary represents- district ..and pariah ' of acquiring abolition oft tosay that the Libei „--s^efea from ttair" leader a progqMa^^u^ a^calcnlated to stir the dee^tiik tmŁigy ^and ^to teuiBe ^tiić sincerest oonvictńmVt)f -«ŚBry m»n-wiiłi a Bpark of liberalism in him. But th enlist ib" bo enormous that to deal with even one-half of the matters it contains would occupy many years. It is curious that in this speech Mr. Gladstone made no allusion to the physical improbability of his taking part m the solution of any save one of the great questions mentioned by him. It has been wen of late that the extreme age of their leader, aad hisjpwfe Jreqnent -references to it, Liberie. Mr. Gladstone therefore, speaks ont as if he himself were to conquer the land whieh-he -only-d»orias-afar ^ott. if he -be spared to oome into power, it is dear that he will first tackle Irish Home Rule, himself for a ooufiict with the House of Lords over it, and that the British measure which will be advanced alongside of the Irifch Bill will be one of electoral reform For die rest, Mr. Gladstone seemed to throw oat hints that those . who , could _ push -,, their v„ - pet ^ I projects most yigoronily would be most I likely to > secure the front places. XUBE BTE-ELECTIOXS. Meanwhile we are watching two election I contests. - Sir?James Fergnsson having become Postmaster-General and Lord Advocate Robertfon having promoted himself to be" Lord President of the Court of Session, their seats for North-east Manchester and Buteshire respectively have beoome vacant. Very little interest is felt in the contest for the latter. Bute is a Conservative stronghold, where Mr. Robertson was sleoted in 18S6 by l,364votesover819 given for his opponent. Mr. Graham Murray, the new Solicitor- General for Scotland, has thereto hard battle to fight against his opponent, Mr. M'CuIloch, a candidate whose principal achievement has been tiie extracting from Mr. Gladstone a letter more 'favourable to Home Ride for Scotland than almost any other declaration of iiis bas been. In Manchesterthe Postmaster-General has. a much more difficult biiflintBS on hand. He is once more opposed by Mr. C. P.

The reports of our three leading railways, Caledonian, Xorth British, and Glasgow and South-Western, for the half-year ending at midsummer, show an extraordinary fall in profits, as compared with the corresponding period of last year. The Glasgow and South-Western has fallen from £190,504 to £191,537, the Caledonian from £564,28S to £519,683, the North British from £5S7.991 to £459,650. These great losses are not due to diminished traffic over the whole, but are largely caused by the necessity of reorganising their management and working expenses under which the companies found themselves after Hie great etrike in the early part pf- the-present year.

"Rely upon it," he said, " that the objects of the profession are the highest objeots that any man can propose to himself, ana rely upon it that the diffi cultiee in whioh it is now involved from the movements of doubt and scepticism are difficulties which are only intended to try the temper of the weapon, and to raise it to a still higher point. There is nothing that has oome into the field that is going to snpplant the old religioh of yonr lathers." Old Bishop Wordsworth, * of St. Andrew's, his Oxford tutor, was by his side. The two old men may disagree in many things. In these seatiments they are at one.
