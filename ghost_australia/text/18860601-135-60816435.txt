THE WARRAGUL GHOST. There'has leen considerable excite ment in Warragul, Buln Buln and the neighborhood lately oNyng9 to t s, ghost. havinj made itis ppemnnce in agully near therii 'nif Mr ~ . Rogers. The apparition having beena seen by. mnoli than one person, a party of four.started one nightto huiiiit it, the leader being arimil vith' a gun. Suddeinly the spectre'appe.redl,when the man with the gun dropped his weapon and fell down in a fit, while two of his coIn panions ran away, and the tlhird after rnning:hnsohise distance, returned,and assisted hispl adcer homo. Such an effect was produced on this nman that we hea?ithat he lims ihad more thazi one fit sinee,'and hd will not now sleep ina lintt by hihself ias was his wont before he saw thoe ghost.. The yooung ladies in thli~izei liborhood are discon solate, viwe understand, ,because thliir loveri will'not da-e to visit them after ;fghtfall. We ivre informed" on Saturday last that a large party had b?e ii m'ade ?up -to "go- ?d -.iit the ghost, and that the nmembers of the rifle club hadl been requested to join in, but as the riflemen subsequently declined on the ground that as the price of ammunition had been raised, they could not afford to expend any on ghosts, the scheme fell through. For the sake of the young ladies whose distress we have referred to above, we think sonme of our gdi:ant defnclers might turn out and see whalt the ghost is made of. They can have the lo;au of the devil from this- olice, if they promise to return hin its safe and sound as the members of the party who actually started to hlunt the spectre last Sunday night, and who would no doubt have succee?ded had their courage not failed .them just as they approachued the cemetery.--" Guardian."
