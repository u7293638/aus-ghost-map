MO OK RISE IN AUSTRALIA., A trackTess forest a'l around Cf lofty gums that from the ground As saplings sprang in ages past The short sweet twilight fadetb fast, And from the forest depths I hear The locust's whirling noise, the clear Soft magpie song, the sudden scream Where cockatoos like white ghost: gleam Among the melancholy boughs, The wild dog's bark, from where there browse Stray herds of kangaroos, the cry Of something death-struck. As I lie And listen to these sounds I see Kong moonbeams pierce a loft; free, Kike random lances thrust to kill Some fiend who baffles all their skill, And even as with sleep; eyes X watch, the full moon through the skies Sails with a seeming moveless motion, A globe of fire in a purple ocean.
