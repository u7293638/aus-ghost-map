Poettg. SWEET IS THE LIGHT " Swest is the light !" they sang, Eirst singers of our race — ; " on each familiar thing, On each belovod face ! The mighty, conquering light, Arrowy, keen, and strong ! The dear familiar light, Waking the world to song ! Light on the purple seas — Light in the golden sky ; Sweet is the light " they sang ; " And therefore dire to die !" " To die and leave the light, Shadows among the glooms , G-roping 'mid ghosts of joys, For dawn that never comes ; Ear from all homely things, And all familiar ways ; Whilst o'er us morn by morn StilL shine the old glad rays, "Waking the fresh green earth With songs to greet the sky ; Sweet is the light ! they sang ; And therefore dire to die !" " Sweet is the light — all light, O Fount of light " we sing, " On each beloved face, On each familiar thing ! Thy mighty, probing light, Keen to part right from wrong ? Thy dear familiar light, Waking Thy world to song ! Light on Thy crystal sea — Light in Thy sapphire sky ; Sweet is the light !" we sing, " And therefore sweet to die !" To die ! and find the light, And never lose it more ; Light on life's troubled waves, Where much was dark before — The little stormy course, Which tossed us to Thy shore ; Light on the ceaseless storms Wherein our race is whirled — The blindness, battles, sins, - And chaos of the world ; The Love that moves that Life. The mighty conquering light, Life giving, keen and strong ; Thy kind, familiar light, Proved step by step so long ! Light in the Father's home, Holy and homelike glow — The Home where one by one, Our best and dearest go. Sweet is the light ! " we sing, " O Light in Whom we see ! Nq darkness waiteth us — No darkness is in T'hee. Sweet is the light ! " we sing, " Where Thou art known on high ! Not darkly — face to face : Sweet therefore, sweet to die !
