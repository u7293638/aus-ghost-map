The track, although perhaps rather hard in places, was in very fail-order, and some fine racing was witnessed. Proceedings opened with the Trial Stakes, and in the absence of Malula, Cuhona was made a red hot favorite, and she won all the way from she jump, pulling . double. Laverness was accorded most support for the first hurdles, Simulator being next in demand, while not a few pinned their faith to that crock, Sir Patrick. Fleet went to the front at the fail of the flag, making- the pace very warm. Simulator was with bim all the way, both jumping nicely ; in fact, all fenced well, bar Laverness, who struck the hurdles three times iu succession, coming down with Deveney at the one past the stand. The positions were unchaugod all round, Simulator winning very easily from Fleet. The big handicap WJIS the next item to be settled. Kichwell and Middlesex, T/ere eijual favorites at 3*o 1, but the former was backed for most money. All with the exception of Lady Jjove got away to a fine start, and they entered the straight together presenting a very pretty appearance. RiehwelMed past the stand, Norma being second and Middlesex third, the rest in a branch close handy. Right round the Kick the positions were the same, but at the: pump, The Duke fe I back last, and Lady Love made; a forward movement. Entering ihe straight Ttlie lot were bunched,, and Lady Ljve coming through with a rush got her nOse in front, "but nearing the enclosure Ellersteneputin her claim ar.d won a lino r-ice by a short length from. Middlesex and Lady Love, with Norma forth, Piucio and Frank ran a dead heat for the Disposal Stakos, but the former won it alright in th& second attempt. Fiddler and Chester fought out the Distrtrict Race, Mr. McDonald landing the former a winner be a length which could havo lieen doubled. Curio was a strong favorite for the Piiie Handicap, but his chance was spoilt at the start, liichwell and Hamilton^ raced close together for the greater portion ©f. tho race, but the latter eame away at tho l ight end, and won like the~ good horse that he is. Tbo secoad Hurdle- Hacc provided a good contest between Fleet, and Sky Pilor, but tf/e latter had too much go at the finish for AUv Atkinson's plucky little pony. Had Sentiment not ran oft it looked a real good tiring for bim. Tlie PJying Handicap was the last race of tlie^ day. Cub onto- was made an eran money chance, Gorio being at 2'g r - and with C.
