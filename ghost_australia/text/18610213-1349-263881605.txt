' To the Editor of the I'asa Courier. Mr. Editor, — A correspondent in yourpapor a short time since asked a question as to whether wo are going to linvo races, or whether we are not. 1 auite agree with him as tojtlie propriety of asking the question, but I think ho ought to have gone a step further than he did, and enquired whether anyone of the committee had taken tho trouble to can vas tha town for subscriptions, and whether any of thc gcntleman who had boon asked to act as stewards, judge, &.C., had consented to act. Tho committee, I believe, have met but once since they were appointed, and on that occasion tlioy did very little. You must ho well aware that if we nre to bnvo races in April, as proposed, the gentlemen who were nominated to do the initiative should have by this time arranged for stewards, .prizes, &c.;, and hnvc had all these matters an nounced to tho public. Sporting men who intend to bring horses to your " mooting " should be allowed time enough to lnnko theirarrnngements,— so— that— their— prods might bo brought out in proper fettlo. I would remind those gentlemen who are anxious to get up races that to do the tiling properly requires more forethought than they are riware of. Some people imagine that racos are merely got up for the purposo of enriching publicans and others. I do not believe in that. Horse- racing is " an insti tution" to encourage the breeding of horses for speed and bottom, and if not carried out in tliut spirit J would never subscribe a rap towards it. "Gallunty shows" are tlio things for money-catching, but never lot our turf ho disgraced by a spirit of aggrandiso- uient. I am. Sir. yours obediontlv. THE GHOST OF JORROCKS. Yass Plains, Saturday.
