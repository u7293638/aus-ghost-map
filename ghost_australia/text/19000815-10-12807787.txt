SINCE WE SHOULD PART. I (Founded upon on old Gaelic Love Song and to an air in the Petrie Collection.) Since we should part, since we should part, The weariness and lonesome smart. Are going greatly through my heart. Upon my pillow, ere I sleep, The full of my two shoes I weep, And like a ghost all day I creep. 'Tis what you said you'd never change, Our with another over range, Now even the Church is cold and strange. Together there our seats we took, Together read from the one book; But with another now you look. And when the service it was o'er, We'd walk and walk the flowery floor, As we shall walk and walk no more. For now beneath the starry glow, While ye stop laughing light and low, A ah ado among the shades I go. -Alfred Perceval Graves, "Spectator."
