ITx is:.'ot" more -.unfortunat. for Mr Berry thian for :the coloicists of Victoria. that on every occasion upon which he has had the privilege of making a Bud get:speech, he has been- forced to conb .fessa deficiency in the irevenue 'ard to suggest iidditional methods of taxation. No one has been taken by. surprise that .i r.: Berry'has gain. been compelled to resort to fresh niethods of incre-dsing the.Treasury'funds. A, deficiency has not only been known :to exist hbut :.un fortunately to be increasing in -propor tions; therefore, retrenclhment and taxa tiori :ave become to bl looked upon as a necessity.; :: Unfortun tely thed ;Berry Government have not: been happy: in their retrenclhment scheme-tlhey have done the.right thing but iii the wrong manner, having: ;been '-:arial in' their dismissals, and patently stupiid il to give it the mildest term :,possible-in their appointments. That :they should give offenice in tlhe character-. of .the new. taxes they propose :is .only:to boe ex pected, because any shape imposts thike are obinoxious to somidi 'sectioin:'of 'the public, .who, like- Hamlet to the ghost are ever ready riwth the exclamatii.n ''ttakie any 'shapeO.- but that." But' taking advantage ef."Mi:; Berriy' blhn dersas as we are justiiedin doing to point a moral, it is questionlible whether in his -necessities' to -raise 'additional ireveniue he has not; adopted the li ost u'iiobjee-. .tionable course so fair as to items in the tariff are ,,concerned.?; Vee? : much:, is made of the cry of taxing the poor man's: luxuries in the shape? of! :' beer : andi baces, but a;'great "many observant people are of opinion that theiese wou not .beneairly as many poori mene if there .swas very much: less spent in these tibo ;:ixuiries? : The colonial ."poor" 'ian.iv'hoever 'he may be, will deny :hiiiself: ?lhe luxury of doing good" in 'providing for the proverbial rainy day, but he must indulge his proclivities for a pint and a smoke whatever the state of the lauder. It is to be regretted, we think, that Mr. Berry did not follow tilie suit of Now Zealand in this tax and make it"sixpence a gallon. With the proposed import on grains ad frun;ers' produce weentirely disagree. We object to being protected out of existence, and if the claim of the farmer is admitted ithat to enable him to live in the prose cution of industries for which this colony is not so well fitted as our neigh. bours, then so must be the claims of every other class-the hatter, the jeweller, the potteryware man, the sugar manufacturer, et hoc genus omnnie. As the protection tariff increases so in proportion will be the falling off in trade, and consequently in ilia customs revenue, because the purchasing power of the population is thereby reduced. The farmer, while he cries aloud for pro tection to his own industry, whines un der the same policy which imposes upon him the necessity for pying excessive duties, so that the unanufaitturer of inm plemnents may foster a trade in which he could not compete were the tariff upon farming and agRicultural imple-' monts removed or solely imposed for revenue purposes. So long as the far mner has protection, so long have the implement manufacturers a right to , claim the same privilege. It would be wiser if, instead of year by year increas ing the taxes and playing shuttlecock and battledoro. with the civil servants ' both sides of the House could be got to consent to the iappointment of a roya 1 commission to enquire "into and report upon the financial state of the colony, its prospects in the fuiture;: the best method of rnising revenue, the advan tages or disadvantages of our protective policy; and the good or, evil which has resulted,- or - is likely to result, from a continuance of.it, the best method of re organising; the civil service :so that it shall be placed on a permanent footing -and generally to discuss and determine our course of procedure in the future. Several conimissioners were appointed by the New Zealand Government to thit end last' sesioin with' very excel lent results. Much that was not gene rsilly known about its civil service and finances .was .brought to light upon which a course of future action has been based likely to result most bene-. ficuidly to the colony. TI?E proceedings. at the recent meetings of the Social Science Congress certainly deserve more notice than has as yet been:given of them; not that the press failed- to publish as full accounts as might be expected, but we consider that public attention ought to be drawn (hiough other channels to the import iiice of the leading subjects which were so admirably .sat before the Congress., At one of the meetings held last week a number of papers and notes were read, dealing with hospital architecture, venti latian, spread 'of infectious- diseases, school hygiene,; piremtureif iiteioiet and iinsane paying patients, all of which subjects ishold command interest with the. gnoieral' publice.. We wish that we hid space to refer to the instructive elements so forcibly alluded to by thl, readers ind siakes on the occasio: atito tohe- OIn suct tnatt a asare s intimitoly connected with the health, com fodt, and welfare of the community. MIr. L Capelain's notes on ventilation deserve the greatest publicity, especially as the system of curo advanced by him for the bad ventilation of . buildings is inexpensive and ieasy in the modes of application. :There cian be but little 'doubt that mbost of the cases irecorded of ill-health and death are hastened on by. a wait of attentioni to the proper system of ventilating dwelling houses.. Now that the whole matter of State education is being debated.in the: circle of intel ligeht men'in the colony, the subject of school hygiene ought not to be over-. looked..: Whatever: course may. be eventiually pursued with respect to pub lic' education, it must be patent that if the body of the pupil is not kept in a healthy state, the brain cannot possibly be in a fit condition to bear that-strain whicli it .otherwise would easily stand. Dr. Ginders; of New :Zealand,v who read a very interesting paper at the meeting of the Social Science Congress the other day; remarked that "the medical- po fession and the public were fully cognis ant of the. evil influences attendant on school life." . And,'he added, that "in Great Britain and America, notwith standing. the promotion of sanitary schemes, very little had been effected in this. department." We are not at present prepared to combat these state ments,'with' the exception,ihowever, of the one relating to the cognisance by the public of the evil influences attend ant on school life. Of course, ;'D. Ginders, in dealing withthesei finfences, referred not to moral-tiints, but simply to school hygiene; for lie distinctly gave them to be the influence of insuffi cient veintilation, the influencne of plosi tion on the spinal column, the influence on" vision, of insutlicient light, or 'its imnproper distribution. :All schools, the doctor contends; should be regularly in spected by. medical bflicers, of lealtl?. S.We quite agree with -him in. this. 'It may be argued that because no promin Â°llF elc'd old'uave een'mouguik forwiard, school hlygiene and ventilation are matters not requiring attention at the hands of the authorities. Bu]t,'it must be borne in mind that the specific poisons :Which'. perpetuate sleeping epi demics are kept alive by the conditions cbonmmon to: sclhoolrooms; that 'they always exist somewhere ;and the :his tory of themr?all demonstrates 'alterna tions of ireliose.iand activity, "of preva lence- in: one place .and absence in imotlier of successive invasions of con tigious neighbouirhoods and succeeding immunities._ A noted American mliedi cal writer has de'claied on this sbihject, and it lias not,'we believe, as yet been contradicted, tlhat tlhe specific moibid poisons, the seed, never die.

He therein deals most fully with the subject, and proves that the difficulties in school ventilation in the United States have been easilyovrcome. This oflicer has clearly pointed out the things essential in sochool vnitilation, the im portant reasons for sanitary precautions in schoolrooms, the influenuce of the schloolroomn on thle health of chlildren, and t?e effects of school life upon the eyes of school ehildren. Under this latter head we respect?clly call tihe att.ntion of Dr. Giudo.'sto Dri. 4agnew's rules for the cure of eyes, as set forth in the work herebefore referred to. In fuet, we re ourselves awaire of the exist cuce of eoluidi;ous oflicial Lapeis, recognised by the GCovernments of the U iited States and other countries, dealing with school hygiene and veiti lation. There ought to be no two opinions as to ventilation being essential to schoolhooini. Life and health in school principally depends upon plrolpe ventilation. It would appear that the whole scienice of ventilation, as regards ossr State schools, is but little uiledr 's:oanl. Vs hi shuouuhd nsot thinasstuthuitzes iand the public profit by he suggestions officially made elsewheroe, with respect to the ventilation.of school bnildings t It does- siot follows tl;at because our State school buildings: have as yet not been declared faulty, that the subject in question-does not require to be irivesti- I gated with a view to improving the schoolrooms. Then again, we read of certain districts having over-crowdeca schools, and where nature's signals of distress- have been :exhibitdd. in them., Thsiidcessity for ienoiviiig the atmo-' phere in these rooms seems to .be lost sight of a good deal. There also ap pears to be a mischievous eiror prevail ing, that if a room is kept at a low tem posnture, tliertis no heed of ventilation. It is most important that a uniform temperature be observed. "Whilst call ing Dr. Ginders's attention to the ollicial :reports made: in a :country, wherein hlie asserts very little 'has been effected in the matter.of school hygieno, weofeel it a duty:to recognise the spirit which has evidently actuated him to bring the subject: before the Social Science Congress. In contributing a pilper of- such vital' iniportan'e, Dr. Geinders deserves the thanks of the. par ents of the scholars attending .our State schools. ;.Moreover, it also ought, tdo-have tho effect bf Counsing uip the d?tilh`zritties to a scnse of` their duty to tihe general public.';'Dr.: Giridors's: labour has been-ono-of love; let us hope that the labour of the Minister of Education will be onde trictily confined to a thorough: investigation of the ,whole matter.

They also contelided that to safely navigate large steamers thiough the Rip and the channels of: Port Phillip Bay required experience which could only be gained by almost daily obser vation. Statistics were presented to Mir Clark showing that the companies named paid much less for pilotage in Melbourne than in Sydhey. MeIr Clark explained thatthe deputation were labouring under a misapprehension. Messrs Kendall-and Bright' had not' asked for an exemption, front pilotage, but that six .Vic torian pilots might be permanently set apart for the navigation of the steamers of the P. O.afid Orientcompanies. He hlad notconsented to this, but he did think that some alteration would have to be made in the port and pilot age charges if Melbourne was to compete with other Aestralian ports. He suggestedl that the pilot service might be gradually reduced by not issuing fresh licences as vacancies oc. curred from time to time. . nl regard to coal in Williamstown, a dleputation -on- Wednesday applied to the Minister of Mines to allow a diamond drill to be used in the district in' boring for coal. Mr MHurray, geological surveyor, said he did not think there was much chance of finding coal at Williamstown. It was very doubtful even if there were any carboniferous- rocks there., : Mr. Williams remarked that he would like to see the qifestion solved, but at present all.the drills were fully occupied, and be could iot 'say 'when one would be at liberty.

A few months ago a bootmaker, Wil- liam Herbert, a resident of Footscray, pro- ceeded to England in the interests of his wife to endeavor to realise some property which it had been alleged she was entitled to. But little was heard of Herbert's movements un- til the following startling telegram appeared-, in Thursday's Argus :-"London, October 27, A man named William Herbert, a bootmaker by trade, who formerly resided in Melbourne, shot his paramour, Jane Messenger in Fins bury Park, and afterwards attempted to com mit suicide. At the inquest on the woman a verdict of wilful murder was returned against Herbert." The unfortunate wife, who has a large family, and works very in dustriously in the milk trade at Footscray; had occasion to visit the local news agency office on Thursday morning, and was in ex- cellent spirits, which; however, were painfully dispelled when the philan thropic lady in charge of the office gradually broke the dreadful news to her. The names of the prties and places contained in the Argus telegrams are identical with those connected with Herbert's visit to England. Jane Messenger is a sister of Mrs Herbert, at whose place Herbert had taken up his abode. Although Melbourne is mentioned as the Australian home of Herbert, it must be borne in mind that like other news from Englaind the metropolis of Victoria is often credited with much which relates to other parts of the colony. Much sympathy is expressed in Footscray for Mrs. lHerbort, who is a hard working woman and the support of a large family. Before the details of this dreadful affair can reach the colony, no doubt Herbert will have suffered the extreme penalty of the law, unless it should be proved that he was of unsound mind when he committed the murder. :.

In the Supreme Court, on Thursday, the 21st inst., an appeal against the decision of MIr Noel, the judge of the Insolvency Court, Melbourne, refusing a certificate of discharge to the "insolvents, James Patrick and- Francis 1'Intyro, of Braybrook, was heard. Dr Dobson appeared for the insol vents. A preliminary objectlin was taken by Mr Lawes that the case could not be heard.. The decision was given on the 10th September. The insolvents gave notice of appeal on the 2ith September, and according to the rules of Court made under the Insol vency Statute, the appeal should have been set down for heariug.at the next sitting of this court; but nothing at all was done till the 1Gth October, when the case was set down, and it .was submitted that it was too late. In reply itwas urged by Dr Dobson that the matter was one within the discretion of the judge, and was not a question of jurisdic tion. The appellants explained that they had not been aloe to proceed with the case owing to the want of funds.- - His Honour said.tihatthe appellants hail done nothing till the 16th .October, and their excuse was. poverty. That excuse could pretty unifbrmly be given in these cases. The act prescribed that the appeal elould be heard in a certain time, and the appellant ought to do some thing.. It was important that these cases should not be' allowed to hang over. The no'ice seemed to have been given to the re spondent, otherwise thi case might have been different.
