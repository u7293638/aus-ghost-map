Pleasant for Somebody. Mr. Forster left England by the Deccan in January last for the Australasian colonies. Mr. Forster carries five dispatch boxes filled with prepared speeches to be delivered in the Assembly on the utter incapacity of the present Ministry, with copious notes and anecdotes illustrative of the political life of Henry Parkes during the last twenty years — With speeches ready cut and dried, With scathing jibe matured, With ancient grudge intensified, With venom long immured ; He comes to flit, like Banquo's ghost, Where'er Parkes' board is spread ; To chill the speech and freeze the toast — A spectre from the dead. Summon, Sir Henry, all your wits, Prepare devices arch ; For Forster vows to give you fits, In the coming ides of March.
