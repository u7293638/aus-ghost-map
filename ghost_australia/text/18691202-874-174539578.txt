After tke " At Home" at Toorak. THE following lines were picked up in Collins-street and brought to our office:— ,, , DEAR CLARA—The "At Home" at Toorak on Monday was a decided success, and the officers are such'delightful fellows, and such dreadful flirts. Captain LONG and Captain O'HARA are so distingue looking, almost as much so as that darling Duke of EDINBURGH was, but the handsomest man in the room (mind en confidence) was Lieutenant JENKINS, who will have an immense fortune when his cousin dies. He paid me such attention, danced three times running with me, and, oh ! he is such a lovely waltzer, and says such nice things. He told me he liked the Melbourne girls better than any other girls he had ever met, and he has travelled all over the world. His christian name is MONTAGTJE, I was just flattering myself I had made an awful impression, when that hateful. Mrs. BLAB came up and said, « Oh, LAURA, dear I how well your dress washes; only a little faded; and I see you've turned all your old trimmmgs. I wish I could get servants to wash as well as you do. Good-bye, dear." I could not help crying* the nasty spiteful creature. Lieutenant JENKINS said very kindly, "Don't mind, she's jealous. I shall never forget it. I can't make out what men see in her. She xs flirt, which is no credit to any married woman, and she looks hke a ghost, I think she must be a spiritualist, one of a low sphere. Any married woman can get the name Of being pretty if she but consents to spend three parts of her time " doing the block " with a pareel. of boys. They say the furniture is mortgaged. LUCIY and CHARLOTTE MORTIMER Were there in their old dresses, the ones they wore to the last T^VE^OR'S balli Md so were lots of others I could name. Everybody is hotso d&honeist; as Mi& B^-^She never pays for hers.^ YonJ ^^tidhate^end;: / ' LAua^ \- Wrbtfe JfciS lettef 6ii purpⅇ to invite you to a pic-nib neSt ^hursd&y.; Do cbmfe.
