ARE WE TO HAVE A MUNICIPAL BENCH? (lo the Editor of the Bendino Advertiser.) Sir,—I had occasion to write you the other day upon the question as to whether we were to have a Municipal or a Camp Bench. The change from Mr. Sullivan to Mr. Simons is so great—bo glaringly transparent—that I anticipate good results. Mr. Simons, I happen to know, will look upon the honor of the office with that clear perspective eye. which hitherto has been jealous of its powers. And, believing this, I shall be much deceived in the man if he allows any ghost of Banquo to push liim from his stool. Seriously speaking, Sir, there is a point of rec titude at which all men should stop. If the Camp Magistrates wish to hold a Court here, let them. They have a Court-house for the purpose. The Municipal Magistrates are similarly accommodated, and let the latter in the person of Mr. Simons vindi cate the right to municipal authority, by sending the Camp officials to their own proper locale,—thereby lie will earn' the thanks of the public, and make hia own name respected amongst the citizens of Sandhurst. Yours, &c.;, D. MACCLENAGHAN. White Hills, 13th January, 1858.
