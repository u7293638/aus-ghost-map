MAD FREAKS OF GIRLS. Tho love of notoriety is natural with most people, although not many Indies would e ire to go to the extent that a young Bristol lady did recently in order to get h*r name prominently before her neighbour.*. Ono day a sudden impulse prompted her to cut her hair short (she had exceptionally fine locks), and then to spread the report that a man had sprung ont from behind a hedge one dark night, and clipped it off with a pair of scissors. Tho news of the 1 outrage' soon spread, and polic'-men, journalists, and neigh bours at once flocked to hear her story. Just as tho sonsatinu was at its height she confessed that sho herself had cut oil the hair and that the adventure she had so graphically described was noth ing but a tissue of falsehoods.

Just as the clock struck the hour of midnight, a tall figure, clothed entirely in white, stood by the window with outstretched hnnd. The spectators were spell bound for a moment, and then two or three men volunteered to investigate. They broke into tho house and found tho 1 ghost' to be nothing less than the form of a School-girl, Graco Hann by name, who had, for a foolish freak, taken it into her head to renew tho ' ghost' scare so prevalent a few years previous. The school which she nttended adjoined the garden m which the house stood, and it was in this that she gained entrance on two successive evenings.
