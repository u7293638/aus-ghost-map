TO CORRESPONDENTS. Morcutio: You love and leave herj she unavailingly implores you to come back. You succeed in life, but your lonely bachelorhood is haunted by her voice crying ' Come back.' You had better obey, or the ghost will always haunt you. Ditto i Just look — Good night ! Oh if 1 couia enter in. (food night I Oh now sweet the thought or you ! Wbon in thy rest think tUou of him Wbo says, Oh if I could eater in. Obi ravifihed thought that tura'st all others dim, Oh 1 heart of miue that madly beats yet true. Good nis-bt) Oh if I could onter in, Good night 1 Oh how sweet Iho thought of you. Aren't you ashamed of yourself P Triolet, is it. Try a proposal instead, then she may let you in. WbiBper : No generation has tho right to make laws binding ouaeuc ceediug generation. Similarly no genera tion has a right to pass its debts on to pos terity unless it ilso passes on the means of payment. The expenditure of loan moneys on current expenses (as per the Fysh brand of finance) adds to posterity's liabilities without increasing its assets. Posterity will promptly repudiate the stale financial Fysh of its foolish forefathers. S.S.S.— Idea right. Execution not quite up. Try again.
