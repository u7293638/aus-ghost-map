TUESDAY, AUGUST 27, 1895. The Tariff debate is resumed this week on the proposal to repeal the duty on tea. There is one big fence to be got over by those who support the suggestion. That is to say, they have to face the stern and practical question —What tax do you propose to put in its place? The Treasurer expects to receive £100,000 from tea this year. If this sum is taken from him it must be replaced. As to saving the money, it may be doubted whether this or any other Government would care about facing another scheme of drastic reduc- tion just now. If the tea duty is taken off some other impost goes on. The necessity of raising a big revenue in this country for the Queen's service may be an unpleasant one, but it has to be faced ; £1,800,000 has to be paid in interest. There is the railway loss to make good, the schools have to be kept open, the public servants paid, and the general government carried on, and even with the utmost economy this means much money. The meeting of these obligations is the one object for which taxes ought to be imposed, though to hear a large number of persons talk it is the very last to be kept in mind. "A mere revenue duty" is their contemptuous way of describing a tax of this class. "All that the tax " will do is to help lo fill the Treasury," is the ingenuous idea on which they condemn this class of imposts. And they have lived so long in this inverted world that many of them appear actually to believe that if a tax raises money for public purposes, and is not a job, it is a bad tax. It is because the tax on tea goes every penny of it into the Treasury to be spent on public purposes that it is by no means to be lightly condemned. The tea tax is not taken out of the pocket of the people to be put into the pocket of some impudent ring or some individual monopolist, but it helps to teach the children, to pay the police, and to maintain the charities ; and when those who receive the benefit of the educa- tion, the police protection, and of the hospitals remember this, the impost may not appear to them to be so iniquitous as it is represented. If they pay this tax they got it back again. The curse with a hundred and one other taxes is that they pay the money and they get nothing back in return. The people who will denounce this tax will describe it as a revenue tax. And what then is their revenue substitute? We need scarcely say that tho motion carno from the land tax ultras-the men who would koop up heavy duties at the Customs, not to laiso monoy but to stop impôt ts, tho tovonuo to come from land, and who thus butlesquo and misapply Hi mi\ Globgi m a mannor tint would hil that loadci with liol) honoi Themoie theso mon can knock toveuuo dutios oil tho closer thoy como to their end It would bo easy to parody tho High 'land aiguiiionts and matshnl them in support of tho duty on tea 'luko that fa vomito and honouied plea that lo imposa a tax is to sond down puces Puces havo fallon gtcatly in tho tea tindo sinco tho tax was imposed, bo that to day toa plus tho tax is cltcapct than cvu it was befoto Havo wo hcto causo and ellcct ? In a hundred and ono casos it has been issu ted that wo havo, but tho fact is that tea has shniod in tho goncial drop with candios, sugai non, and all staples, and that but foi tho tax tea would bo cheapoi still, as would bo all othoi taxed ai tides, candles, woollens, and so on lhon wo havo tho much npplaudod pica that to talk of cheapness as a v iituo in itself ia the sign of a small soul, that wo ought to hcotn tho pt o ducts of cheap Inborn, that to nso tho ptoducts of tho coobo is to degrado oui selves to tho lovel of the coolie Well, no labour is so cheap as tins Chinoso toa labout 'Iho wages paid sound in oin oais as iidtculous, and if thoto is aught in tho theoiy of tim dcgtndatton of tho highci taco which vontuios lo utiliso tho pioducta of an nifoiioi ince, whj, toa is tho one aiticlo windi ought to bo specially penalised J low can tho Coinoi Umnwiinlo íonlly sit down to a pot of bohea with any comioit oi enjoyinont whatovci when the} lomoni bei that the sugai is mado by a coobo oi a kanaka wlto mny get Is a week, and that the teaisgtown, mckod, dried, mid tuvnspoitcd by a ¡ng tailed íaco who takold porday in payment?
