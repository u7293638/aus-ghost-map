S CH LPTER XXXIII. ...:: . :..:TIiE LAST STRAW. '"You amo too late, my friend." Philip had been sitting in his study in the darkness which -was not more black than his life. But he aioseito give his cold hand to 3:r. Phil brick, who hlad come at last. SlW\hy too late? This is only Wednesday. Have yon :changed your mind? I did not suppose there was so much hurry, and I wanlted to have everything ready. " "It is too late," answered Philip gloomily. What use to tell the old gentleman that PhilipBieton's wife was a criminal before the law, that the transfer of the mill property was only a part of his scheme to save her from an infamous penalty, that their deadli est enemy knew all their plans now, and no doubt her sleepless eyes watched their every movement, lest they should escape her hate. The servant came to the doorl "I suppose von will have lights, sir. Some men from she mill folks want to see you." "Oh, yes; show them in," he said care There .ere not chairs enough for the four workmenl who came stumbling ill like pall bearers at a country funeral, but Philip did not seemi to look at them. One took his place by the window, and soiled the curtain with his hands; another, apparently the spokesman, dlidlalned to lean against any thing, but stootd stock still in the centre of the room, bent forward a little in an attitude borrowed froml the prize ring. His feet were planted well apart, and his arms bowed out at the elbows. ,I suppose voa have some complaints to make," said the young mill owner with a gentleness of tone that was quite mi?.nder stood by the delegation, who immediately tried to look very fierce. "Ye're right, sir," answered the man in the center of the room. "Ye know yerself, ye aint doin' the right thing by us." Philip did not speak for a moment, and IMr. Philbrick would have thought he. had not heard the fellow, only for a little twitch ing at the corners of his mouth. Apparently the youmg man was deeply hurt by his fal-. uor to satisfy his men. "I have done the best I mnew." "al, we kin tell ye, if ye don't know no better,( [resluned the worlann insolently. Philip's eyes flashed at him, then dropped to the carpet again. "Pay us more wages for one thing, shorten up our hours for an "You fare better than other.. I divide the profits with yeou. You thought I was very good with you once." The youlg loan's tone was not arrntunenltative, it was too hopeless for tlit.' . "Y'er don't divvy even; our shareolon't. 'mount to much," put in the man who was soiling the window curtain. "I mna sorry for yoiu, but you can't expect Ine to maike you all rich." There was such 'a :lulaess of reproach in 'lhilip's voice that s mist gathered before Philbrink's kind eyes. But the :workmen got the idet they wsvere frightening the young master. .. - "I have gone as far as I can see ay way Doll tyou think you ha better be patient oith mcur "Be you galn' to raise dur payin Philip slmoi his head thoughtfully.. . "I cannot und staan d it is my duty or myn right." Are you goin' to shorten up our hoturs? asked tli mini at the window. . - "I cannot" The chief spokesman, turned to his cOle ri?niiols. "Tier ain't no use. Wal 'squire, to-lmorrow "ou may wish you had. Coise along, boys." Phil Ip had dropped back heavily into his t:hair. It seemed to have forgotten thoepres 2r1c of Mr-. Philbriek, until that gentleman began to explain his moro perfect system. -'lto- can you pFpect yolr help to be satis lied," Philbrick was syai:g; "even if they were well paid it wouldt be suml pbjeet for. them to be shutp sali their lives, asil tllh ey :;'ere convicts. tiut you don't 1pay. thelm; either.

"Your plans will succeed better than mine and you can't find such a. ood place as this. You will taki my mills.' "Of covers I will, but I thought you said"-? "Never mind," cried the young man, "nlever mind what I said. Draw the l?pel?t at once. IBut no, I cannot wait." I'lilip turned on his heel as if no earthly power could detain hint a moment longer.

Then, with out another word, Ih rushed from the roonl and bounded up the stairs. Freedoml safety! oh, thank God, thank God!l ie could save her yet. A castle on the IRhine, a palace in Venice; he would find the rarest homes for her. How swe2t it would be to hide with her. The awful sense of hourly peril would lift from his soul. He pushed open the door of the white chamber. Bertha had been sleelpinr. The tear marks were on her cheeks that iad lost their beautiful flush. She was so disap pointed, poor girl; and yet she never guessed "Wake up, wake up, my darling.:' he started from the bed and fell to weeping on his shuhlder. f"1 , 'ted they were taking me away from y..., Phlilip." But he dried her tears with merry kisses. : : "Wo are in time yet. The steamer don't go till s to-night." U ?.WELCOMI VISITOs S. .

Iate had taken his work away from him. Iie must sit back on the seats with thle women and clildren, and look on anul applaud whean great deeds were doing. Hle would have liked to work, too; but perhaps others would do his work better. "IHallo, hallo, Phil, don't yol work pretty late,' It was Giddings, the lawyer, in a co:l ditionrof decided intoxication. 'l11l bet yer dollar you don't know what I came fort ha, ha, ha; you think money don't you; more imoney? But I aint that sort of a feller." Philip had been simply disgusted at first, hut there seemlcd a terrible leer ill the drunken eyes. Could it be the nan hadl come to ex pose him? What was the use of struggling against his destiny any longerl If he could have gone yesterday, he would Ihave raved all risks. ]ut he had waited just too long. Curran had returned to claim his wife. Julne Ellingsworth had discovered everything. nl d now this Giddings in his drunkarld's toolishness was threatening what ruint ie zould bring. "You are not going to do anytling rasl arc you," said Philip, drdopping his eyes in hiunmiliation. But Giddings came close to him and laid his hand on his shoulder. Then he put his face close to Philip's, with a druhken ontn's fakes measure of distance. Tile young nlan ritheilc at ris touch, and held his breath to avoid taking the hot fumes of lind liquor the fellow exhal'ed. But he did not dare to anger the low creature. h"Did you think," continued Giddings with gushing, reproachfnlness, "that I aint got any conscience? You're doin' wrong Mr. Breton. I aint got no right--no right to let it go on. Did you think I aint got no consciencel" Philip shook him off and his face grew so lerrible that the fellow winced as he had fone before at that look. "Don't strike-don't kill me, Phil--Lr. Breton, ' was only jokin'-can't you tell when a hua's jokiin'. Got any money 'hbot lothes,say $50; 'm awful hardup. Ionuldn't hurt you; your altogether too nice feller." He leered affectionately at the young man, then suddenly he winked frightfully. Philip threw him a roll of bills. It was the last blood money the scoundrel would ever draw. By to-morrow morning Philip Breton and his wife would be beyond the reach of harm, or beyond the reach of help one or the other. "There is $100; takoitand go, I have business." "Ten, twenty, and twenty makes thirty, ten, anl twenty and twenty, here aiut but $80. Thought I's too drunk to coun' did you?" "There is 8101 there." "'S lie. Yer takiae' vantage me cause Pm drunk." This creature mustbe away if it cost $1,000. He crowded another .?0 bill into the fellow's clammy hand. S"Now go, or you'll stay longer than you want to." Giddings dried his tears and gathered his limlp joints together to go. But he insisted 'on Philip's shaling hands. But even after Giddhigs had got into the hall Philip heard the fellow muttering to himself. He stepped hurriedlyto the door of his office to catch the word, but could not. If Philip had been a little quicker he would have heard this: "Somthin' up I ain't so drung but Ica se thatn Guess Isil g'up to the boy's house. His wife 'll know me, ie, he." y. Would Bertha never coune? If they escaped now it must be but by a hnir'sbreadth. Itnui would ?e close upon them. For the adjust menat of a ribboi she would snacrifice every thing. It seemed ri gTeat while since Curran lhad left the office for the labor meeting, and he had not so far to go. Something might have delayedl tile terrible disclosure for a few lmoment.? but by this tinle he must surely hlive heard the whole story of his shame and dishonor. It would stir him tomiadness. His noble eyes would flash lightnings, and thun derbolts ofj hate and scorn would drop from his lips. No human being could stand against the divine dignity of such a man's righteous wrath. Philip fancied the mob sweeping up the road behind this outraged husband, seek ing out his wife for the doom that would satisfy his mad thirst for vengeance. Now, perhaps, they were bursting in the glate, nowv breaking down thoe oaken doer. And Philip could not be there to protect the beautiful woman who had onlysimmued through love for him. How the color would flee her clhpek - she ]fpkgil 'ut on the lli~ies daces af titp l''n ed"Aut, i h+ore? as no arm new to slieldher, none but Curran's, whoso love was now enmlittered into bate.

He walked the room like a caged lion. Now he rushed to the door and glanced desperately up anld dowlt the street, 5 His hoises were chamling their bits at her door. but the light yet Iurned in her chantm ber.OThero was hardly tfime to catch the train at the Lockout stition. Tie o wild mob with tho Iladdened lover the moa.t terrible of enemies, at their headi would be at her door in a moment. Still other dangers Philip did not guess threw a gathering shadow across her path. But she lingered yet. CHAPTER XXXV. A POPULAR LEADER.

The light of the man's noble genius had Bushed his pale cheeks and flashed beauti fully in his steel blue eyes. His voice, that had seemed weak and unsteady as he be gan, rang out its bell like tones again ashe saw the sullen faces soften under his match less power.
