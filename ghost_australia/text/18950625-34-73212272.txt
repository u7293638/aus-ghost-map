ADAH LISDSAY GORDON. TO THK ETHXOB. ' - Sir— I notice that 'The Kangaroo' : in TheAdvertittroi to-day's date calls attention to the fact that this is the twenty-fifth anni versary of the melancholy death -of Adam Lindsay Gordon, who, as be once served in the South Australian Legislature, bas a special claim on tne remembrance of residents within its bo-rdc**-*. It wiD, therefore, be seasonable perhaps to give yon a description of the poet's era-re to which I paid a pil grimage last month. From Melbourne I took the train to North Brighton, walking thenae a distance of about a mile and a half to the pic turesque cemetery in which Gordon lies. For the most part tbe sandy soil is covered with ferns and other hardy . growths, and bat few graves have disturbed tbe natural surface. On the slope of the hill at tbe further side of 'God's acre,' however, ' monuments axe clus tered close together, and on the brow of tbe rise the -eye soon catches a glimpse of a broken column in fluted bluestone mounted on a massive base at tbo same material. Hung diagonally about the top of the column is a marble wreath, while on each of the four sides of the base is a marble slab. On one of these is written:— TH£ fosr GORDON. Died Jane 24, 1870. Aged 37 years. The three others bear the names of the various published volumes of Gordon's poems : — '-ABhtanrth,' 'Sea Spray and Smoke Drift,' and 'Bush Ballads and Galloping Rhymes.' A large wattle tree, -riuchwas just budding at the time of my visit, sprrngB from the sandy -plot about the tomb, and another grows just beyond the ragged border mesembryanthemum which divides it frpm its neighbors. About the lowest slab cf tfebaae ivy is striving to climb, and then are two desolate-looking plants of laoristinna and one or * Lwo d***pr*fWa*od rots boshec nonoof which are in a flourishing iTf'*iri*1itw**n There- ia no railing round the .grave, perhaps in half compliance with the pcefs wish — Yon win lay me fa the hollow where the wattle blosso-nswave.
