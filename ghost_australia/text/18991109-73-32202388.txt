Fools step in where angels fear to tread, and a trio of venturesome celestials started to build up a nick little business on their own in the con fines of Little Bourke-street. He-e they did a thriving trade, and bbsine- s became so brisk that all hands were re quired to.attend to customers, and pre cautions against surprises were some what felaxed. The detectives stmielled what is commonly knodwn as a "rat" perfume of a deceased rodent in warm weather, when the animal, giicrs up the ghost behind the wainscot is not likely to be forgotten-and acted accordingly. Several newly-fledged members of the police force, looking very sheepish and innocent, were pressed into the service, and succeeded in doing business with the "Chinkees," wheitet?on a rush upon the premises was made by several detec tives stationed near. This move re sulted in the capture of all "on board," including nine Europeans. Before being captured the Chinese were cute enough to dispose of all the cash in the establishment.
