Tie Q.T.C. Handicaps. The main fanlt in Mr. Bichardto'n's ■work, in the-Cup Handicap at least, in' my opinion, is the unnecessarily nigh scale adopted. 9 st. 10 lbs. and 9 st. 8 lbs. are not. in themselves prohibitive- weights, and heavier hardens are often carried to - victory; bnfc very, rarely in. long distance handicaps, with a 6 st.' 7 Its. minimum. Of tho IC candidates Premier is probably of such good'' class that at 9 st. 10 - lbs. he most have ar chance, though he lias never yet negotiated li miles. Music is'said to l>o dead to the world,! and. though so much is not actually said of Clythe, more 'perhaps is thought. Avenue has ' been tried over the distance, but not' at the weight,, and at 9 st. he may he said' to- have got quite as much us he bar- earned; if not more. Young Buckthorpe is well in. at 8 st. 9 lbs., or-5 lhs. under his-weight for age. Tornado,: 8 si. ?lbs.,- tan second to. SpientHde, 8 st.; 12 lba^.ih the Two-mile Queensland Cup last December, beating Irish Stew (third)'' under 7 st. 13 lbs.,' Premier 9 st. 7 lbs., and New bold 8 st. 12 lb*. On that irmcing -Irish: Stew," at 8 st. G lbs., cannot have* the ghost of & show hare, penalised, as he is, 7 lbs. for being, beaten soma lengths.* Premiers run ning, oi course, is uo guide to his real form, and. unless the Ipswich horse,- Music,' Avenue, and Clythe are very much better class than Splendid?, Tornado's chance most be second to none above Km in the handicap.; Checkmate- has pace, and has won' in fair! company down- below, and1 m good time, but helms dons- nothing io make him-out a Cup horse even in Queensland/- and at 8 st- S lbs. has probably a little more than 3£r. Mooney expected. Had Mr. Bichardson .started his r.v « n n ' n ; • .1 handicap with 9 st. 2 lbs. on Premier^ and reduced the others all round 8 lbs., Check mate's chance would have been better, though none too good, at 8 st! Newbold, at 8 st. 5 lbs., has a shew, snd-of the rest- the best may be Cap-a-pie and Barrister, though. 1 am not very fond of either. H. Kelso, Nar cissus, Grand.Clogs,, or Silver can win. our beat horses must be a bad lot. There Li' more rubbish, perhaps, in tho. More ton Handicap than in the Cup.- The dis tance is shorter, and therefore • more excuse for a high. Tnt-rtmrm-i Tlia Cup horses are raised 3 lbs. all round, but Israelite is an , absnntee, while the newcomers, i.e., these not in the Cup, ore Archie's Daughter, Freedom, Minster Belle,. Caradoc, JohnS^ and Soldan.: Of theso Freedom,is handicapped quite np to: his best, and psrliaps a little*above it,'but He is a thorough racehorse and not to be taken anyliberty with Archie's Daughter is very barfly treated at 8 st. 9 11m. . She never won: a race at any distance beyond 6. furlongs, • and. then only * opposed by a poor , lot.: 1 am' not surprised that the! pen: was run through the filly's name as soon as the weights appeared.. Minster Bella cannot' complain of 7 st. 3 , lbs. Curadoc at 7 st. 2 lbs. is said to,W a red in pickle for the cracks. John S. is a "has beeu," and never was a champion, and . Soldan is hardly good "enough for. the company an form. The best in" the Cup are probably Premier, Avenue, Young Buckthorpe, Tornado,..'and Newbold. In the MoretoaHandicap, Premier, Clythe, Avenue, Yonng Buckthorpe, Check mat®, Tornado," and Newbold:' -:*-•*-• - •- ■
