SPOR TING NOTES. (BY AnctotREDES.) Scratchings have commenced early for the Melbournoe Cup, Segenhoe, Morpth and The Drummer having had the pen put through their names. The contest for the Ladies' Bracelet at Caulfield last Saturday, although in the end won easily by The Ghost, must have been a rare sernmble. Fancy forty-two horses being marshalled to the post for the event. Sunh a field has never before been taken in hand by an Australian starter, and if my memory serves me correctly, only once has it been beaten in the world. I think that on one occasion forty-three started for the Chester Cup, won by Lion. We may yet live to see half a century of horses starting for a Melbourne Cup, although it would appear as if the six furlongs flutters were mnore acceptable to the majority of the owners of horses. "A very pleasing ceremony (says the Mercury) was performed on Saturday even ing, when a number of members of the Sale Football Club met at the Criterion Botel to present Mr. L. W. King with a small soucenir on the occasion of his departure to reside in Bairnsdale. This consisted of a silver locket and chain, made at Mr. S. Drakeford's establishment, Foster street, and the locket bore the following inscrip tion:-" L. W. King, from his Sale friends as a token of their esteem, June 1883." On the other side, Mr. King's monogram was engraved. 'he presentation was made by Mr. Hagger, who referred to the good feel ing that had ulwaya existed between Mr. King and the members of the cricket and football clubs, and wished him every success and prosperity in his future homne. Several other members of the club spoke to similar effect, and Mr. King suitably returned thanks."--tr. King hIls arrivcd in B3airns dale to take the agency of Messrs. Mt'Cul loch and Co., and so far as football and cricket are concerned, Sale's loss is Bairns dalo's gain.
