Keep Out of the Past. Keep out of the past ! for its highways Aro doinp with malarial gloom. ? Its gardens are sere, and its forests are tlrcor, And everywhere moulders n. tomb. \\\ ho seeks to regain its lost pleusiu-es Finds only a rose turned to dust, And its storehouse or wonderful treasures la covered und coated with dust. Keep out ot the past ! it is haunted. He who in its avenue gropes Shull Und there thu ghost of a joy prizod the-. And u skeleton throng of dead hopes. In place of its beautiful rivers .Lie pools that are stagnant with slime, And those graves gleaming bright in the phos phorus light Cover dreams that were slain in their prime. Keep ont of tho post! it is lonely And Durrcn uudbleuk to the view. Its fires have grown cold riiid its stories are old. Turn, turn to the present, the new ! To-dny leads you xip to the hill-tops, That are kissed by the radiant Sim ; To-day shows no tomb— all life's hope in bloom — And to-day holds a prize to bo won. ?
