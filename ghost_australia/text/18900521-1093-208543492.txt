VICTORIAN PARLIAMENT. SIR JAMES MACBAIN'S BANQUET. GOVERNOR'S SPEECH SHADOWED. [By Telegraph.] Melbourne, May 20. In pursuance of the usual custom Sir James Macbain, president of the Legisla- tive Council, signalised the near approach of the session of Parliament by a banquet in Queen's Hall of the Parliament House to-night. There were 200 ghosts present, including the Governor (Earl Hopetoun), the judges of the Supreme Court, the officers of the military and naval forces, members of both houses of the Legislature, Government officials, and prominent citizens. The speeches were of the usual after-dinner character, no political topics being touched on. The Governor's speech at the opening of Parliament to-morrow is not ex- pected to be of a sensational charac- ter. The subject of federation will pro- bably occupy a prominent position, while the promised Railway Bill will have a first place. Reference will also be made to the Metropolitan Board of Works Bill and to the Local Government Amendment Act.
