THEATRES IN JAPAN. Mr Josiah Conder, professor of architecture to the Imperial College of Engineering, Tokio, Japan, has supplied the following description of Japanese theatres to the Budda - Few Japanese buildings have a more frail and temporary appearance than the theatres, possessing no architectural pretensions, and devoid even of the picturesquely curved and over soiling roofs which give an elegance of outline to most of their other large buildings. Their general appearance is that of a broad squat-looking building of wooden construction, with a wide central roof of Hat pitch, a clerestory, and lower lean to roofs at the sides the large roof has generally a low continuous lantern running along the top to admit air and light The walls are constructed of a framing of vertical and horizontal timbers filled in with nothing, clay, and plaster, having weatherboarding called upon the outside The window a fire oblong openings with wooden bars placed either vertically or horizontally, closed in bad weather only by sliding shutters, having paper lights which are placed towards the inside, of the reveals A story appearance is given to the otherwise insignificant facade by means of large placards heavily framed, which are being in profusion in front, and decorated with large representations of scenes from the play in bright harmonious colours Some of these posters extend from the ground to the eaves and in addition there are often a number of bright flags on poles fixed in the pathway The theatres of a Japanese town are generally placed together in the same district, and about them are several large tea houses (hotels), whence it is usual to procure one s ticket and make all arrangements for seats and refreshments With the Japanese, as with the ancient Greeks, the performance of a play is the matter of a whole day, the theatre opening at about 6 in the morning and closing at dusk 'line is broken by frequent and tedious intervals between the acts when the audience adjourn to the tea houses, or take their meals in the theatre The building is entered from the end facing the stage through a sort of central hall, containing racks for depositing umbrellas, clogs and generally serving the purpose of a cloak room On either side of this entrance are rooms, some of which are devoted to the manager and his officers, and others to the actors The actors have rooms at both ends of the theatre There are also private entrances in the front communicating with some of these rooms Between the entrance, with its adjoining rooms, and the auditorium, or main body of the building, is a passage running from side to aide leading to the staircases and side passages Direct admission is gained into the pit, across the main passage, by two doorways, between which is a row of small compartments, closed in towards the entrance, but opening on to the theatre, looking towards the State These rooms are some of them occupied by dealers in programmes or provisions, and others by police, who attend to preserve order The pit holds by far the greater part of the audience, for the raised and supported seats at the sides and end, which correspond to European box seats, are comparatively few in number the pit seats consist of a great number of low, box Uko divisions, placed upon a floor sloping slightly up wards from the stage end The incline is scarcely perceptible The du 1310113 are about 4ft square, and are intended each for the seating of five people, squatting upon the mat covered floor There are two passages through these seats from entrance to stage, one on either side, and these are sometimes used in passing from seat to seat but access is obtained to any part of the pit by walking along the low divisions between each compartment the edges being made flat for the purpose Sometimes in addition to cassimere mode of communication, there are one or two cross passages of a plank s width these BE Well as the principal Bide passages being always at the level of the top of the seat divisions and consequently on the same level as the siege and of the shoulders of the audience seated in the pit 'The main passages referred to are also used by the actors during the performance, who often approach the stage from the front of the theatre, where they have several dressing rooms Sometimes an actor will stop to speak or act in this passage in the midst of his audience, addressing his fellow actors on the stage across the people The passage on one's left hand as one faces the stages called the main passage It is wider than that on the opposite side, and more used There is also a corresponding underground passage beneath it, and a trap door to admit of sudden appearances and disappearances This lower passage communicates with a wide space below the stage where are appliances for hoisting connected with several trap doors in the floor of the stage A magician or ghost can thus disappear quickly from the stage, and appear amidst the audience, or, what often happens a hero or victim slain upon the stage will meet in a transformed, ghostly apparition in the passage, illumined by a coloured light Some very pleasing scenic effects are obtained by the use of the upper passages sometimes a gaily dressed procession, or an armed Butte ofattcndaiitB approach the stage in a long line with all the slow ceremonial and etiquette which belong to the customs of old Japan At other times an exit will be made impoSing by a large train of followers , a farewell parting will be lengthened out by lingering and looking back , or, may be, some favourite low comedian will give full play to his comic strut, action, or go mace, as he makes his entrance or his exit across the long passage This peculiarity has seemed worth dw elling upon, as, by reason of it, certain representations can be obtained which decidedly improve the effect of the play, and which are more or less impossible 111 European theatres, where approaches must be sudden, and a Blow arrival or far off action can be suggested only by distant sounds behind the stage from invisible supernumeraries, or by exaggerated expressions of expectation or alarm on the part of the actors upon the stage To assist this conventionality, and to carry out still further the idea of the all pervading nature of the scene in a Japanese theatre, strips of painted canvas, continuing the stage scenery, are often hung to the fronts of the upper boxes and galleries running all round the theatre An example of this may be given by reference to a portion of a favourite play, in which is represented the embarkation of a prince from his own castle town When the scene opens, a boat lies in the fore ground, the floor of the stage being covered with painted canvas, representing a sandy beach in front and water touching the prow of the boat, and extending behind to the back of the stage The prince and his suite having entered the boat, it is moved by means of the turntables of the stage, and at the same time the canvas representing the water is drawn forward, the sandy beach dis appears, and the whole stage represents sea Then, gradually, along the sides of the upper boxes strips of canvas painted as water are drawn by cords, until at length on the further gallery front facing the stage is seen the representation of the distant shore and cattle town This forms a fitting and expressive accompaniment to a long farewell soliloquy from the boat, the prince address ing his native home which he is leaving behind him Thus a vivid reality is given to a change in the scene of action The idea which it seems to suggests to the audience is that they have in reality followed their hero to his next abode, leaving with him the last scene behind and not that he has left them in the forsaken town to be transported mysteriously to the next scene of action 2 he two or three outermost rows of pit compartments slope considerably upwards on either side, and at the back Outside these seats are more spacious compartments running all round the theatre in a single row These are the lower box seats, and at their front are occasional wooden posts supporting the floor of the upper tier above them They are closed 111 and entered by doors at the back Some height above this upper tier of boxes and just beneath the long low clerestory windows, is a light and narrow gallery supported from the wall on brackets , This gallery appears to be used only for attending to the windows, being approached by a ladder staircase, and being too frail to support a number of people At the back of the boxes on either side are the two outer passages for communication with these box Beats, and corresponding passages above for the upper seats One of the lower passages has a central screen dividing it longitudinally into two, the portion nearer the outside being used by those actors who wish to pass unnoticed from end to end of the theatre The back portion of the pit opposite to the stage is covered by an upper gallery, on a level with the upper boxes, which extends back over the hall and rooms round the entrance At the two extremities of this gallery are several small rooms for stores, and a sort of oratory, with a shrine, where it is usual for the proprietors and actors to supplicate success from some deity The appearance of the whole inside of the theatre 18 extremely plain, and devoid of finish or ornament The large tie beams of the roof, of heavy unBquared timber, are generally visible below a rough boarded ceiling In some cases the boarding is placed below the tie beams, and is slightly out mented w Uli thin net. The heavy timbers of the roof contrast greatly with the frail posts and filling in which form the walls of support. The fronts of the upper seats and the gallery front have sometimes a moulded hand rail, with moulded or carved supports, but in other respects the interior has for embellish- ments, except in the scenery and hangings of the stage Considerable room is taken up by the stage, which occupies nearly the whole of the further end of the building in addition, there are a few actors dressing rooms, bathrooms, and small staircases leading to the principal rooms above These upper rooms are larger, and occupy a portion of the space which below is given to the stage for the purpose of moving the scenery and working the turntables The principal actors haveseparatedrcasmg rooms, a hairdresser, and quite a number of attend ants , there is a larger room common to inferior actors These rooms at the back of the stage are in some cases arranged in three low stones The staircases of approach from one floor to another consist of two strings with trends and no rivers or handrail, placed to a steep slope The height of the stage opening is about 10ft from the stage door which 13 about 18in below the eye of those seated in the front of the pit the platform of the stage which has no inclination, comes well forward beyond the curtain opening, forming a wide passage in front communicating with the passages through the pit The stage is provided with one or two concentric turn tables coming out to the front, and by the revolution of these the scene is sometimes quickly changed The front scene will hide the scene behind, which is prepared 111 readiness, and then the whole is moved round the representation of an interior scene upon the stage as we should make it, namely, by convert- ing the whole state into a single room by means of side and back scenes, is never attempted, and is scarcely necessary on account of the facility of representing exterior and interior together A Japanese house he low rooms is often only of one story and is mostly thrown entirely open in the front Even 111 cold weather it is quite common to see the whole front of a house thrown, quite open by removing; or sliding back the light paper slides shots), of which nearly the whole front consists In stormy weather either case blinds are hung outside of the paper Slides, or else the whole is closed 111 by wooden shutters called mades (rain shutters) placed outside, keeping out light and air, a small quantity of light being admitted from some small side windows or by a small portion 111 front not being quite shut in In palaces or the residences of men of rank, the rooms are grouped together and the block surrounded on all four sides by a wide boarded passage reached by a flight of wooden steps from the grounds. 1 his passage is sometimes double the outer and narrower portion, having a balustrade corresponding to the handrail of the steps, and the inner portions bounded by posts filled 111 above with plaster, and supporting the eaves of the roof The spaces between these posts are often entirely open, but they can be filled in with shops and arcades The internal poets of the passage forming the walls of the rooms can also be filled in or left open according to the weather, so that on a fine summer day the whole interior can be thrown open, presenting a v vista of matted rooms and groups of posts. It is such a view as this that is given to the audience in a theatre The whole front or end of a house in represented on the stage from ground to ceiling line, by means of a light wooden construction somewhat smaller in scale than an actual building The front thrown open will present to view the interior rooms in which the acting takes place, prolonged sometimes into the semblance of a vista of rooms, by means of painted scenes at the back The perspective of such painted scenes is mostly correct, erring rather in being too sudden The turntables upon which such constructions are placed enables them to be quickly moved to the back by half a revolu- tion, revealing the next scene, which will have been meanwhile prepared behind it. On the front part of the stage, side scenes, shrubs or flowers will be placed to form a foreground The stage curtain, generally having some simple conventional device in colour upon it, is drawn forward by attendants at the close of the scene At the left hand side of the stage is a space for the orchestra, who play drums, Huges and stringed instruments, and who partly explain the acting and comment upon it, after the manner of the Greek chorus In addition to this orchestra there is a little gallery on the right-hand side of the stage, some 10ft. from the ground, in which two musicians are seated who accompany the performance. One of these men plays a stringed instrument (causes), and the other accompanies the music at intervals with singing and interred exclamation They are sometimes visible to the audience, and sometimes screened by cane blinds, through which they can see without being seen, for it is necessary for them to watch the movements of the actors upon the stage An ordinary theatre has no proper prov season for artificial lighting, for the performance generally takes place only during the day time, when the place is lighted by side and end windows just below the eaves In case of a play hemp; prolonged till after dark, a miserably inefficient light is obtained by a row of candles placed in front of the Stage, besides which a candle fixed to a rod is carried about by an attendant, and held in front of the particular actor who is speaking, in order better to illuminate him Another peculiarity is the presence on the stage of sundry boys dressed in black, with loose black caps, indicating that they are to be supposed invisible They crouch about behind the actors to remove from the stage anything that is to be dispensed with, or to place a low seat or support under an actor who has to take up a position for any length of time. Most of the plays enacted are taken from Japanese history, and a visit to the theatre 13 now the best opportunity of realising the customs, habits, etiquette, and costumes of ancient times It is said that the representations may be relied upon as correct With the profession of an actor, as with other professions in this country, the business has hitherto been hereditary and instruction has been personally given or handed down in manuscript This accounts to a great extent for the want of really good and exhaustive treatises upon the dramatic and other arts in which the people have shown at times remarkable skill The dramatic art of Japan may be said to hold the same comparison with our modern European drama as mediaeval decorative painting does with the highly natural- istic picture of to day The story is told forcibly, the action of body and of feature is what we should call exaggerated , the impression of sorrow or despair is aided by weird doleful music, and by the sympathetic wailing of the chorus and sometimes acute feminine grief is pictured by a dance in which the hands are wrung, and the body writhed in painful action, accompanied by Bobs and snatches of wild Song There are dances expressive of grace and beauty, of humour, or of grief, unnatural, perhaps, but unmistakably highly effective in drawing the By apathy of the spectators and: conventionally assisting the effect of the play So forcible is the effect produced that a foreigner, unable to follow much that is Bald, will find himself worked into sad or pleasurable excitement fully in sympathy with the action of the play The Austrian antliontieapurpose establish- ing at Serajevo gymnasium for the education of the children of the better classes The institution will commence operations next October They also contemplate establishing day schools of this kind in the other principal towns of the province They have selected a Slovene, Professor Schumann, to organise this system of middle class schools in Bosnia, and it is understood that the teachers will be Slow area or Czechs ALUNE tourists will be pleased to learn that the Austrian Alpine club Oesterreico. has resolved to erect a hut at the Eagle's Nest, a point about 4000ft above the level of the sea, and an hour and a half below the summit of the Great Glacier It is expected that the now but will be able to shelter adventurous climbers at latest by September next It will be called the Archduke John's Hall, in honour of a prince who so far back as the early years of the century, long before Alpine clubs were dreamt of, loved to explore the fastnesses of the high Alps IN addition to the cavalry horses recently sent out to South Africa with the reinforcements from England, the British Government has despatched numbers of horses and mules to the Cape from the River Plate, and much interest is attached to this experiment. It is confidently hoped that the South American horses and mules will take kindly to the climate of South Africa, which resembles that of their native country. The shipment of these animals to the Cape has given rise to elections suggestion that the lease, to the use of which they are trained, and which is the means by which they are captured and broken, should be used as a weapon against the hostile Zulus, and that a corps of mounted. English volunteers from the River Plate, accustomed to throwing the lasso, should be attached to each invading column, for the purpose of lasting the enemy. The proposal would have more weight if the Zulus were possessed of cavalry, which they are not, but it is probable that the use of such a novel weapon would create a great impression, and probably cause a panic among the unmounted warriors against whom it would be used,
