AN ESCAPED FEVER PATIENT — ? ?» ? FALLS THIRTY FEET. SERIOUS INJURIES IN ? FLIOTED. John Carroll, aged 19 years' whose mind had been affected by illness, escaped from tho Ballarat (Victoria) Hospital a few days ago. He was only recently admitted as a patient at tho institution, and when his delirium manifested itself ho was, for his own safety, manacled and strapped to his bed. In effect ing his escnpp, Carroll, who is a resident; ot isungaree, went towards Ballarat East, and at 3 o'clock a miner, returning homeward from work, observed him on the Queen street bridge. Ho was clad only in a night dress, and the miner on first observing the white object be came somewhat alarmed, as he thought ho had encountered a ' ghost.' Accompanied by an acquaintance, whom ho aroused from bed, the miner ultimately advanced towards the bridge. Carroll, on seeing the mon approaching, jumped over tho parapet, falling 30 feet into the railway cutting below. Senior- constable Nedwell, officer in charge of tho Victoria-street police station was then informed of what had occurred, and on descend ing the railway cutting he found Carroll in a stato of collapse, with blood flowing from a sevoro wound on the back of his head. As Carroll appeared to be badly injured, ho was convoyed back to tho hospital, when it was found that his jump from the bridge had been attended by serious conse quences, as in addition to the wound on the head, ho had also his thmh and arm broken, besides sustaining painful contusions to tho body. Some timo ago a typhoid fever patient escaped from the hospital, and was subsequently discovered walking in Lako Wondouree, in four feet of water.
