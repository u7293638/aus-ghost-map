MESSRS. QUINLAN, CONDON, AND WEBSTER RETURNED. ToE Shire Council elections, which took place on Thursday, resulted, as was pretty generally expected, in, the return of Messrs. J. Quinlan, T. Condon, and J. D. Webster, It was currently stated for, weeks previously that Mr. Donald Underwood had not "the ghost of a show," but in the early part of last week .there. was a considerable change of feeling, and on Thursday morning, as the people from the Muddy Creek streamed into the township to record their votes, some people began to veer round, and it was quite common to hear opinions ex pressed that he would not be very far behind ;. whilst someof his more ardent supporters were prepared to back him for first or second place. Those com petent to judge are of opinion now that if he had spent a day or two amongst the people of. Dropmore, Kobyboyn, and Ghin Ghin, he would have been second or third on the list, instead of fourth.. .All. the candidates, except Mr. Quinlan, declared that they had not canvassed for votes. Mr. Webster did not go quite-so far; he limited the number to' 20. Well, perhaps he did not directly .ask for more than 20 votes, but there Are many forms in which .indirect canvassing may be in dulged in. At all events,. Mr. Webster's familiar figure was more in evidence all over Yea for two or three weeks previous to the election than for any two or three months of the year of grace 1891. Not that any candidate is to be blamed in the least for can vassing so long as the law permits it to be done, though John Stuart Mill, Herbert "Spencer, and other philo sophers of our own day have declared it to be totally at variance with vote by-ballot and. an extended franchise, and a part of that had old time when the landlord laid claim to the votes of his tenants as he did to his annual rentals. At no' time during the con test was there anyexcitement worth mentioning, and though considerable additions have been made to the Rate payers' Roll, there was no great difference in the total number of votes recorded, as will be seen from the appended returns -of the three latest contested elections: S . 1891.
