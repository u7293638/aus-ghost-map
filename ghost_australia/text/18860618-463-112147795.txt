POETRY. DIAMOND SCRATCHES. Fife yean ago in the .city inn, We passed a pleasant day ;' Four merry friends, who ate' and drank, And were With aa birds f u May. ' We scratched our names 6n the window pane ; '' ' l ' ': Fhere they stand in the sheen, And prove to me, if to nobudy else, What fools we must have bejjn. ' - One of them borrowed my cash (a dove That never returned jU- the ark) ; ' '' The 'second was jealous of my fame, And stabbed it in fhe dark ; !T!i« third made 'lore to a' bonnio wee ' maiden, J Dearer to me than lifo — WooeiJ 'her and wun 'her behind my back', Tl And made her his wretched wife. And here. I sit in tue cosy inn, Wlitle ihe bright wood splintery blaze, And drink'my pint of claret' alone, And think of the pye-gohe days. And wonder which ' of my three fslse frieiitU ' ' ' I liate or despise the most. Surely i»of. him who borrowed my cash ; Tia gone— fiis a bodiless ghost 1 Surely not him who stole my wife, That was no]t my wife, &uA; wot J Put might 'have been, t-- my dire distress, Had she fallen to my Inc. ' ' I think I hate with the deadliest hate The fellow who felyirred triy 'name— Shaking my' hand, 'eating my bread, ' And murdering my fatfte! ''' ' ''
