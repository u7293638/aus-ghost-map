(rHOÎI TEE TALL MALU DÜDOET MAY 21 ) The ming in the Caucasus is said to be asBumiug seuous dimensions. Advices from General Lons Melikoff, received at St Petersburg state that the Mussulman popu lation have risen cn masse since the pro* clamation of the (etwa by the Sheik ul Islam General Reecheff, it is said has been com polled to retreat before the Circassian msur tenta According to a Tillts telegram, the Russian garrison of Sakhum Kaleh, after the destruction of the place and fort retired to the forts and blockhouses of Maramba and SebelditiBkoe on the heights to the north east ana nave ueenreimorcea uyturee nílemenfrom the Kaban and regular field and mountain battories. Notwithstanding thesj reinforcements, an attack modo on the Turkish positions at Sukhum IC&Ieh; on Fn day last appears to havo been completely un successful, the RuBBians being drivon back with loss, and leaving t considerable quantity of arms and ammunition on the field The tribea of Abchasia, as well as the Circassians, are, it is Btated, now in full luau.roctiou. The Sultan has ordered 20 000 revolvers to be purchased oat of his private purse, and distributed among the insurgents The son of Sohamyl, Meamed Pasha, has gone to join the revolted Circassians, and it is announced from St. Petersburg that the other son of Schamyl, who ia established there, and holds rank in the RusBian army, has gone to the Caucasus, no doubt to use his influence, or rather the weight of his name, with the mountaineers ThuB the two brothers will act againBt each other The effect produced by the insurrection in the Caucasus (tho Vienna correspondent of Tlu. 2'inies says) seems to be all the greater in Russia, as it was quite unexpected All ive counts previous to the war were euch as to excite no apprehensions about a possible rising there The Turkish fleet, meanwhile, have been bombarding Adler, higher up on the Cirros stan coast than Sukhum Kaleb, and the aotivity displayed by the fleet is said to havo produced a panic, not only in Odessa, but all along the RuBSitm south coast All confi- dence in shore batteries and m torpedoes baa, wo aro told, been lost. Trie Go vernor of Odessa, Count Lewsscheff, has endeavoured to calm the public mind by issuing proclamations, and Adjutant General Semeka, the military commander of the south coast, bas, on his part, taken mea sures to defend OdeBBa a.ainst a cou]} de mam by concentrating there a force of three brigades of infantry, eight sotni&s; of CosBacks, six Bquadrons of light cavalry, and two companies of field gen- darmes. From the south coast of the Cn moa the news is not more reassuring A Turkish squadron, consisting of two mom* tors, three ironclad frigates, several smaller vessels, and a whole flotilla of barquea, sup posed to have volunteers on board, are cruising about in the waters of Sebastopol and Eupatoria It is reported that this fleet will not bo satisfied with bombarding the places on the coast, but also moans to excite an insurrectionary movement in the Crimea. A Constantinople telegram to the Manclwtcr Guardian says -"The Turks have decided to bombard OdeBBa. It is understood that Hobart PaBba has undertaken this mia sion." THE SINKING OF A SECOND TURKISH MONITOR The following account of the sinking of a second Turkish ironclad in the Danube in telegraphed by the special correspondent of Ï lie Ttmca at Buoharest - One of tho most daring deeds ever recorded in the history of warfare was performed on the Lower Danube, near Ibraila, on Saturday morning, May 26 A Bmall detachment of Ru j BiansoldierB commanded by Lieutenant Daba schell, accompanied by the commande of the Roumanian flotilla, Major Margoaca left the northern shore of the Danube in a number of small boats, und proceeded towards the point Petra Tetei, below Matchin and opposite Ibraila, at which point there waa stationed a large Turkish monitor. Tho night was very dark, and they managed to surround the monitor before being discovered by the Turkish look outs When finally observed by the sentries on board they wero challenged, and " Who goes there '' rang ou5 on the night air Major Murgescu replied ni Turkish, Tuende " Tho Turks, eudontly not satisfied, commenced firing in the direction of Matchiu, not knowing where these boats carno from The sho's flew wide of their mark, aud did no damage to tho daring men m the boats During <he firing several of the Russian Boldiers, under tin direction ol Lieutenant Dubascbeff, plunged into the rater, Bwarn silently to the hull of the ironclad vessel, and placed the deadly torpedo m close contact with tho bottom of the monitor After the destructive machin 3 had been securely fastened and the wires of au electric battery accurately adjusted, the mon retired to the neighbouring ehoro of tho river, and at half past 3 in the morning the monitor was blown into iho air, with all the officers and crew. The explosion was terrific, and as nothing is said of the crew being saved it is BuppoBSd that all on board perished with the vessel The cool determination with which this fearful ontorpriso was successfully carried out speaks for itself in the result and the fate of the second Turkish monitor already sent to the bottom of the Danube with all on board Bhows how futile was the expectation that gunboats con maintain the mastery of a river lined with hostile batteries filled with enemies as resoluto as the mon whose deeds are recordod abovo The name of the monitor destroyed was the Dar Matoin, THE ORDER or ST MICHAEL AND ST. GEORGE (FnOH THE TIMES li \\.Y 31 ) Tho anniversary of Her Majesty's Birthday has been marked by an important extension of tha Order of St. Michael and St. George. The Boveral classes of the order have been enlarged, a step rendered necessary by the growth of the colonial empire, and the old offices of Prelate and Chancellor of the ordor, which have been in abeyance since the re- vision of former statutes, have been revived.

(IBOM THF DULT TaLEGItAPH, MAY 29 ) A more active and efficient agent even tuan Mr Lord, of the ThameB ConBorvancy, in clearing tbo coarse between Putney anti Mortlake yesterday afternoon was a tempest of rain and wind. The river wa« lashed m^o an angry roar, and seemed as though it would vent its fury on the elender boatH of the competing scullers. Many persoiu had assembled on the banks, for tbi morning was fair of promise, and thore was hope even in the keen, dry wind that accorn panied a too early brightness and warmth of enuBhine. But the hurricane that Bwept H o liver and throatened to swamp the bitts bad a marvellously sudden effect in diminuí im tbo crowdy as well aa in changing what WAH left of it into a black, shining mmti of umbrellas. Of the two men who m.<r to try their strength in the scallerB' raoo for tbe championship of England and £100 it is not necessary to say much, as their former achievements are in the memory of all who take an interest in aquatics, John Higgins is a Shadwell waterman who, in the International Regatta, last October, wan van qumhed by the youthful Blackman, and Robert Watson Boyd is a Tyne elder, who in turn beat Blackman on the memorable occasion we have just referred to Four Bteamers weis chartered to accompany yonterday'n race, and they were all crowded. The tim« appointed for the start was a quartor pist 2 but, as usual, it took place somewhat later, the word being given precisely at a quarter to 3 As Boyd was known to be anfferinn irom an attacs 01 uoiif, vue uatung ni»u ueeu Btrongly in favour of Higgins, the odds ot an early ponod of the das being 2 to 1, but aa soon as tho rough weather began to affect the state of the water, making it as lumpy aa it mighr have been at Blackwall, tho difference gradually sank till in n few instances 11 to 10 wss taken Boyd waa attended bj Bagnall, and Higgins by Drenitt, and eich man was cheered on stripping though the appearance of Boyd was decidedly better than that of his opponent A clear lead of two lengthB was gained at the start by Boyd, who from that moment held the race secure Higgins having not tho ghost of a chanco against him To the Gateshead man the storm troubled water was a piece of good luck and tie knovledgoot this fact indeed had completely changed tho bottiDg Before the Bishop's Walk was quite passed by the leading man hia bott was four lengths adead, and he was sculling easily at an increased distance, probably at five or six length? whon going by the Crab Treo Hipgins, on the other hand, laboured hard, aa the south westerly squall was rising to a dangerous fury. The Soap Works were reached in 7m. 83. by Boyd, and 7m. 17s. by Higgins ; and Hammersmith-bridge, in 8m, 41?. by Boyd, and 8m. 50a. by Higgins ; but the nine seconds' difference might easily have been increased by Boyd had he thought it necessary to exert himself a little more. So hollow a race would necessarily have been a very dull and unexciting one, had not a cause of anxious uncertainty arisen from the perturbed condition of the tide. It was by no means unlikely that accident might turn the fortunes of the day ; for a ÍioBitive sea waa running, and the rail craft were buffeting with whits crested waves that ever and anon hid them from eight. Still, it was far moro pro- bable that Higgins should be the sufferer than that mischance should happen to Bjyd ; for while the latter shot his boat with com- parative steadiness through the foam, Hig- gins seemed all abroad, and was compelled again and again to stop, in order to light hin staggeting veeeel. A space of at least 200 yards was between the men as Boyd went under Barnes-bridge, and that he could have won by a quarter of a mile is undeniable, had not ho judiciously slackened pace. As it was, Higgins, who showed an utter inability to contend with rough water, was about 20 lengths behind at the finish, Bo.d winning in 28min. 24sec. by Benson's chrono- graph. With the stakes of £100 and the scullers' championship, Boyd also took, DO a challenge trophy, tho handsome cup given by the proprietors of a Nowcastlo paper. It is very likely that Boyd or Blackman may go to Australia, and thero compete with Trickett, who last June easily defeated Joseph Sadleir for tho Thames Champion ehip, but declined, before leaving Eugland, to row with Higgins. THE QUEEN'S BIRTHDAY IN AMERICA (FROM THE TALI, MALL BODOET.) The American telegrama give long accounts of an International British celebration of Queen Victoria's birthday at Petersburg, Virginia. It began on Tuoaday evening, and was to last three days. Largo deputations attended from British societies of dif- ferent cities of the United States and Canada, and on Tuesday night, at it public meeting in the Court-house, tho delegates were formally welcomed to Petersburg, Mr. D. B. Tennant, presi- dent of the British Association of Virginia, delivered an address. He said that Peters- burg had been selected for the reunion be cause it was the headquarters of British colonisation in Virginia. The British inter- national celebration now beginning he described as the most remaikuble that had ever occurred in the United States. A few years ago it would havo been regarded_as a rash idea to propose the assembling of Eng- lish people from all parts of the United States and Canada m an American city to celebrate the Queen's Birthdav. But the day of jealousy botween England and the United States has passed for ever. The English - speaking people of every alle- giance are proud to remember they are brothers of common ancestry, race, and re limon. Queen Victoria is as much beloved in American as English homes, and her birth- day will be honoured this year man American city with greater festivities than possibly in any portion of the Queen's vast dominions. On Wednesday special religious services were held at St Paul's Church ; afterwards, at noon, the British Society held its annual meeting. Petersburg is crowded with people, and the townspeople are said to be profuse in their hospitality, many of them keeping open house. THE POLITICAL CRISIS IN TRANCE (FBOM THE PALL MALL ltODGKT, MAT 23 ) The poBition of affairs ¡n France in attract ing almost aa much attention as the war On Friday, the 18th inst, when the Cham- bers wero assembled, a decree was road pro roguing them for a month. The following raessago from the President was read in the Senate by the Duo de Broglie and in tbe Chamber of Deputies by M do Fourtou Messieurs Senators and Deputies,-I have been obliged to separate myself myself from the Cabinet over which M Jules Simon pre Bided, and to form a new one I am about to present to yon a sincere account of the motives which have led mo to that decision You nil know bow scrupulously I have, since February 2C 1875 the day whon the National Assembly gave to France a RepublicanConati utioii, obrorved in ti o exercise of the power which has been confided to me all the pre renptionsof that fundamental law. Since the elections of last year I havo desired to choose DB Ministers men whom I supposed lo be in accord with the sentiments oi tho mnjoniyin the Chamber of Deputies.

At what ever time they might ba successful, they would engender nothing but disorder, and would l»ad to the humiliation of 1 ranee I tneieioro oo not eicBire DO uicnrpi eue upyn cation of that programme, nor render iterajy to my BucceBBors As long as I am tho de positaiy of power I will uee it to the full ox tent of its legal limits to oppoao what I regard aa the ruin of my country , but I air convinced that the country thinks as I do- it ia not the triumph of these theories that it wished for at the last elections That IB not what was promised to the country by thcEO who took advautago of my came and declared thcmeelvea resolved tu maintain my power, and these persons proved tbo majority of the candidates If i were again asked, and in such a manner ss to guard against all misunderstanding, it j would, I am mire, reject that conclusion I have been obliged, then, to choose, and it waa my constitutional right to do BO couti eellorB who think as I doon this point, which is really the only one in question. I am no leSB ii i ni to day than I was yesterday in my rcfolvo to respect and maintain the insti- tutions which are the work of the Assembly which entruBted mo wir power, and which have constituted the R public Up to 1880 I alone can propose the introduction of a chango, but I have no intention of doing anything of the kind All rrj couneellcts are, like myself, decided to cany out the institutions loyally and are incapable of making any attempt at violating them Tlieee considerations I commit to your reflection and to the judgment of the countiy. In older to peru it the agitation which has been caused by the recent mci dents to subside, I shall invite you to sus pend jour Bittings for a time When you resume them you will be able to apply your selves to the discussion of the budget, which it IB ro important to terminate Boon. Till then my Government will watch over the public peace.

He rejoiced to Bee that it was the principle and practice cf this great town that tbe local organisation should be governed by the very eame principle and the free potular choice should be its basis and i s i nie (Cheers.) He rejoiced to find that hundreds of delegates from lib°ral associa tioDB in all parts of the kingdom had as sembled there to-day in a conference because it showed that there ousted a diapo Bition tbrcughonttbecontry toadoptthiBprn ciple, andbewassufficientlyianguineropro diet with confidence that they would succeed (lee newed applaused ) As he had said, thoy bad a great deal to leam from their oppo nents nut he did not deBire them to imitate them m all respects too closely Now, they knew that there were two schools of art m sculpture-the Egyptian and the Grecnn When they examined the former they found that its principal feature was that of repose but when they examined Grecian speci mens of sculpture they found that thn predominating principle was life and motion (Hear, hoar ) Now he though that there was a great resemblance between the Conservativo party and Egyptian sculf ture-(laughter)-and when Conservative like Sir R Peel deserted that principio of repese they eoon Buffered for their temerity bat in the Liberal party the predominan feature reminded thom of the Greek iden of life and motion (Renewed cheerp ) It was of course, comparatively easy to keep a collection of statues in order, an I if ti e Conservative Btatnea were to bocon, animated, and walk about the hall no doab the qutst on of drill would become mn"li more difficult and much moro delicate than i WBB at present As for the Liberal party accustomed to life and motion they nee 1 not be solicitous about keeping their rank* ¡n perfect order (Hear boor ) The town of Birmingham had never boen distingnishe 1 for week kneed Liberals and he rejoice 1 that this great town which at the great cneis of the Reform Act led on tho nation to i i great and beneflcio.it change had been tho town to raise the banner of order in tho Liberal party and to teach by practice, ad well as by precept, that if we wished to pre vail and conquer we must lose mach and sacrifice many private and subsidiary opinions for great objects , and, further, we must not disdain to learn the operation of many of the leesons which our opponents had to teacli He said the ' operation, ' for he would be sorry to see the discipline o[ ? be Liberal party brought up to tho rigour which prevailed amongst the Conssrv fives of the House of Commons 1 > prove the rigour of tholr discipline, I a mentioned that on the debate on his ron lutiocs one bon member said that as he could not support the Government he woul I leave the HOUBB Turning to the Eastern """"linn TVir ftlnrtatnnA Raid ho remiced that a Liberal party existed which had proved BO tine to ils principles and its convictions, and which bad lesolved to exert ita influence in a gieat and holy cause (Cheers ) It had been aBked whethor it was necessary for hem to bo so much on the alert He replied in the affirmative How could they place any reliance on the policy of the Government, which to day was one thing but which bellied them to say what it would be to morrow Tho sentiments of the Govern- ment were one thing when Earl Beacons field made his Guildhall speech, but how different WSB that sentiment when uttered by Lord Derby In a speech unworthy of n British statesman the policy of the Govern ment be described as a policy of zigzag and see Baw, and, unfortunately he was driven to the conclusion that when it moved ia. a. right direction it moved only under popular prca sure, end when that popular piessuro waa withdrawn it WSB apt to move ogain, but only in a wrong direction (Cheers and laughter ) Lost autumn ve were told that it was impos- sible to rely on the promises of the Turks, end that we must be supplied with extraneous guarantees, independent of that of the will of the Government but within the last two months, they hud been told by the Chancellor of tbo Exchequer, and by the whole of the Government in the reply sent by Lore! Derby to Prince Gortschakoff, that we should ' condemn tho war because Turkey was willing to refeirm. As a mattor of fact, we had not one Government, but two Governments, one m conformity with the public senti ment, and the othor placed nearer to the Springs of action, steadily watching ita oppor tunity, and when there was a tacit remission of the manifestation of public feeling, then it seized the opportunity of giving assistance to the Turk. In this respect the Govern ment was liko a dog returning to its kennel and to a sow rotutned to its wallowing in tbo mire Bat it must not bo concealed, and he would not conceal it from them, that they had the Houao of Commons against them This would be shown by the demeanour of the House when Mr Croas made his effective speech on tho Eastern question. When Mr Cross uttered any sen timent which could he turned in support of tbo TurkiBhcause when ho condomnod, no tho national manifestation, but his (Mr Gladstone's) manifestation, thou ho was greeted by tempeats of cheering b; those behind lum , bul when ho pro ceeded to diipuse of the broad chimeras by which BritiBh interests had been conjured up in every spot in th globe, in order to temfy us from doing our duty, when in pl.m language he said that thero were no British interests involved in the Russian invasion of Asm Minor, or by tne temporary oca paliono Bulgaria, thon his words fell Hat on those behind him (Lau^h ter ) He might as well have addressed him self to a Bet of those Egyptian statues whose case bo had already endeavoured to repre sent (Ronowed laughtor ) If was fortunate (o them to know that the country was on their Bide, but it waa of far more importance to know that the entire empjro was on their tide In Auatralian newspapers araclei had reen published nsindtgnant in their toneat the Ttukish atrocities as any articles which hid nppcnrcd in 1 ngliah journals , and in O ago New Zealand, theio had boen held au euthu elastic public meeting at which sorrow and ndignant horror bad been expressed that n > remedy had yet been appli»d It wai provor bially difficult to convince a man against his will, and it bad been said ovor and over again that the nation tt« BRainBt them in the Eastern quo tbn Ho did not believe it, but there was an easj way of ascertaining which waa right, namely by a dissolution of Parliament (Load cheers and laughter) He suggested this to the Government in his mildest manner, but the suggestion did not appear to be popular with the Government (Renewed laughter ) The question for thera now was whether thero was not a dangei of seeing the duties of England disregarded, nay, positively contra vented. Thero were two objecta which they had in view, lirst, tho maintenance of neutrality in tho present question batween Russia and Turkey, secondly, to organisa a real and living concert in Europe for the par pose of requiring from Turkey the necessary guarantecB He did not believe after all tha1, bad been said aboutneutrality, tbatneatr&lity; was secure, for he thought it waa imperilled by the constant reference to " British interests Now, it was exceedingly difficult to find ou» what BntiBh interests were Neutrality won also imperilled by the advocacy of the metro politan press for the maintenance of tho.-,e said interests Turkey, a bankrupt state Turkey, tho home of Blaves and slavery, had mado no progress dnnng the last quarter of a century, and, in tho words of MIBB Florence Nightingale, he hoped that " this war would please God, bung freedom and safety and tue bleESings of home, of industry, of progron and all that which all Englishmen and English children pnzo " The right hon. gentlemaa resumed his placo amid loud applauBe, aftor having spoken one hour and 20 minutes Mr. Chamberlain, M P, moved the follow ing resolution -"Behoving it to beoaaentul for the promotion of wise and liberal logis lation m the government of this country that the opinion of the people Bhould bavo a full and direct expression alike in framing and ia supporting the policy of the Liberal party, this meatian heartily approved of a proposal for uniting in a federation all the liberal association» which aro founded on the principles of pDpa lar elections.

MISCELLANEOUS Mr. Guildford Onslow gives the following account of the visit to Dartmoor Prison on WedneBdoy last -' Lord Rivers and rayaelf arrived at Prince s Town about 3 o clock and fonnd ourselves very shortly afterwards m the presence of our poor friend Sir Itj^or Tichborne, tho victim of false ovidono and an unfair trial We were aarse ably BurpriEcd to find him in exoallent health, and abounding in hope, with a mind at ease, and a conscience that is at rest, ÍL ? omplained of some bad treatment by the authorities ia the prison, but what the grievance was we could not ascertain. Ho in formed na, however, that he had patt tioned tho Home Minister for an învoscigi non of the circumstances attending it He begged us to thank the public tor tneir aympamy ana BUPPOTC, .TUICU cheered him in his dismal prison. Ho gave t;B some valuable information regarding Arthur Orton, now in the asylum at Sydney. When the 20 minutes had flown, and the prisoner had passed to his solitary call, we felt the consolation of knowing we bad done e ur duty to an injured man, and by our vur bad given him one ray of pleasure in his life of gloom." The council of the National Rifle Associa tion, at a meeting held on Moy 28, decided that Sir Henry Halford bo authorised to go: up a united team from Great Britain and Ire- land to shoot at the international long range match in America in September next. Ar rangements as to the formation of the te»m have not yet been porfected, but any gentle- men able and willing to take part in the con- test are requested to communicate at onca with Sir Henry Halford, Bart, Wistow, Leicester, Mr.Creswick, the actor, was entertained a a dinner at the Freemasons' Tavern on May 28, previous to his departure for Australia Dr. Doran presided.
