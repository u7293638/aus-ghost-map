tf OETHERN *TEKRITOKY. ? Â» PORT DARWIN. July 25. The Atjeh sailed to-day. An alleged case of kidnapping at Port Essington was the cause of Inspector Foelsche's visit to that place. Mr. and Mrs. James Manson have been appointed to take charge of the Hospital. Messrs. J. Stilling & Co. inform us that they have been advised by their Sydney agents that the s.s. Chimborazo arrived at Aden on the 24th July, all well. 'A few months ago' says the Southern Argus of July 25, ' many persons were frightened and some depredations done by a person who assumed the role of ghost. The same person, or some imitator, has commenced to play similar pranks again. On Monday even ing, about half-past 11, the inmates of the house belonging to the late Mr. J. R. Harris were dis turbed by a noise at the back door. On the housekeeper proceeding to ascertain the cause she was startled by the figure of a person en veloped in a white sheet. She had the courage, however, to seize a corner of the sheet and demand who was there. A neighbor coming up at the time, and attracting the housekeeper's attention, the ghost, who was uumistakeably of the feminine gender, escaped, __ Shrewd sus picions are entertained of the identity of the party, and she will consult her own safety by discontinuing her disgraceful conduct.'
