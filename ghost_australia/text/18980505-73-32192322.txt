THE RING. Martin Denny, now located at Cape town, is anxious to have a " cut " at Jim Holloway, who is at present domiciled at P'ort Elizabeth. The latter is quite willing to accommodate the clever Aus tralign light-weight, but he wants the t;ornstalk to come to his terms, viz, 35 rounds or nothing at all. The McAuliffe-Krugel fight at the Ampitheatre, Johannesburg, on March 5, proved rather a disappointment to those who had pianed their faith on Krugel. From the start of the first round he never stood a ghost cf a chance with the Australian, and a great deal of doubt has been expressed as to whether the supposed I-ody blow alleged to have given him his quietus actually occurred in the tenth round. McAuliffe was very clever with both hands, and went in for hard punching right throush. On the other hand, Krug.1 " monkeyed" about the ring just a lit'le to- much, and not once could he be said to have made any sort of sound fighting play. He was undoubtedly clever at ducking and squirming, and this activity alone saved him from being knocked out earlier. He proved a big disappointment to his backers, who encouraged him all they could so far as applause went. On the other hand, MIcAuliffe proved hinmself a cool, colle, ted and determined fighter ; all he wanted was to get to close quarters, and when by chance he did get there Krugel knew all about it. Repeatedly he gave the latter one, two, three, in quick Fuccessidn with out a single ri turn being made. He moreover, got Krugel several times in a very uncomfortable position against the ropes, from which the latter's agility alone eared him.
