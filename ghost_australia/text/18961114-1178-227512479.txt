;i A TBUE GHOST STOHY. A weird story of the appearance of ft ghost at Brighton real-hps us from Mr. Thomas Lucas Smith, who writes as follows to London "Telegraph" . from Mansion House-chambers, E.C.: "On Thursday I was stopping at the bouse . of a friend at Brighton, and, having remained up reading for some time after the family had gone to bed. I at last, It being nearly twelve, pre pared to retire to rest. In going up- stairs I seemed to eatch a glimpse of a' patch of moonlight on a wall by tho window on . the second landing. As I drew nearer, to my utter astonishment, this 'gradually took the shape of a wo man! The .ghostly nature of this form was apparent, for the wall was clearly visible through the figure. The shape, was that of a woman of about thirty, tall, well-formed, and clothed In some plain garment, which might have been a shroud. She was gaz ing earnestly Into the grounds through the window, a very sad ex pression upon her face. Suddenly she gave a deep sigh of such utter lament that It slnrtlcd me more than oven tho first sight of tho uppniltion. Then hor form grew indistinct, and In a few sec onds vanished. I examined the wall, but found no trace of anything abnor mal. In the morning I related the strange adventure to my host, who was remarkably upset at my narrative. At his request I refrain from naming tho precise house, as the property Is l'or sale, and publicity might do it'harm. Ho stated there was a family secret ho could not reveal, and contented him self by asking me to inspect a certain picture In his possession. I. was astoun ded to find .the ghost and this portrait to exactly tally. The latter muBt have been at least 70 years old. 1 await an 'explanation' from those scientists and conjurers who laugh at spiritualism. I know that my experience 1g real."
