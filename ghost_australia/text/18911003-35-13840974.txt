LIFE IN LONDON. -A . BY HENRY AT. LUCY. WESTMINSTER, AwrosT 21. At an early hour this morning the French fleet weighed anchor, and steering slowly through the Solent, where they arrived on Wednesday night, moved on to Spithead There awaiting them was, perhaps, the most formidable- squadron that over floated on the waters above the earth Seventeen battleships watched the Btntoly advance of the Frenchmen, and none looking on could resist the thought of what would be the result suppose Â£10 foreigners came unbidden, with intent to carry out the dream of Napoleon when, early in the century, he planted km army of observation at Boulogne As the French approached the black sides of the British men-of-war iv ore suddenly illumined with forked tongues of flame, and for a while then ugliness was hidden under a cloud of smoke A deafening lemonade echoed round the forts at Spithead and through the glades of peaceful Osborne to the south But it was only their fun, or i either their friendliness The guns were not showed and the firing meant nothing more than a thunderous v close to the coming guest This, though the formal and most impressive welcome the French ships and sailors have received, was not the first Yesterday the principal officers called on the Queen at Osborne House, were graciously received and invited to dinner To-day her Majesty goes forth to review the fleet, and in the evening Admiral Gervais and his principal officers dine at Admiralty House, after which the Mayor of Portsmouth gives a ball at the Town Hill To morrow the Mayor en- tertains the French officers at dinner On Monday a thousand of the bluejackets will be fed, and on Tuesday the fleet sets oil for Cherbourg The most noteworthy feature in this round of official receptions is the participation of the Queen Her Majesty is, to tell a familiar truth, a little inclined to exercise hospitality vicariously, and the cn tertaining of foreign guests is usually left to the Lord Mayor, the Prince of Wales, and members of the peerage who have both the means and the position to present themselves as suitable hosts On the present occasion the man el is increased by the fact that the Queen actually so arranged her Balmoral programme in order to remain at Osborne to do honour to the French fleet At this period of the year, as harassed and hampered Ministers know to their cost, her Majesty is usually in residence at Balmoral In ordinary sessions her departure coincides with the conclusion of the Parliamentary session More than once it has happened that by postponing her journey by 24, or at most 48 hours the Queen might be Parliament up and convenient perform the functions which pertain to her estate in the ceremony of prorogation That she should be in the far north when the pro- regation is being carried through its A crisis stages is a highly inconvenient accident, in giving much trouble to Munsters, and often postponing by a day the release of a worn-out Legislature But the Queen has never yielded to these considerations to the extent of postponing her departure by an hour She has set forth on her holiday trip at the appointed moment of the fixed day, and Ministers have been left to make such arrangements as long experience suggests for we rigging out of the dilemma It is Lord Salisbury who has succeeded in prevailing upon the Queen to make this rare sacrifice of personal convenience on the altar of public duty The Premier has long been under suspicion of assuming towards Germany an attitude of friendliness a little marked by contrast with his bearing towards France It was impossible to divest the recent visit of the German Emperor of political significance that is, as far as jealous eyes looking on from the Continent are concerned The visit of the French fleet to RUSSIA, and the comically exaggerated outburst of loving-landnc68 between the two nations which followed thereupon, was intended as a counter snow e If only the fleet could be induced on its way home from. Russia to call at Portsmouth, opportunity would be afforded of show ing that British sympathies are wide enough and warm enough to embrace both nations John Bull those, in short, been this week presented in the attitude of the benevolent patron, far above of the smallness of personal predilections Laying one hand on the head of France and the other on that of Germany, he says, " Bless you, my boys , bless you both " It has been a carefully devised plan carried out regardless of trouble or expense But there has been an artificiality about it that has grievously detracted from its full effect People can see the legs of the Punch and Judy man beneath the screen They know that the figures were brought there in boxes They see who pulls the strings and how it is done, and they smile and pass on Writing a fortnight ago on the personal prospects of the inevitable succession to Mr Smith's place as leader of the House of Commons, Even tried to set forth some reasons for belief that, though Mr Goschen is officially nominated for the post, Mr Arthur Balfour will get it Since then a princess and significant incident has taken place. The other day Mr Balfour was speaking at Plymouth a borough represented by Sir Edward Clarke, Solicitor-General In the course of the proceedings it fell to the lot of Sir Edward to move a vote of thanks to Mr Balfour, and in doing so he went far Out of his way to had him as " the coming leader of the Conservative party " Considering that up to the last day of the just closed session Mr Goschen filled the place allotted to him since he went over to the Treasury bench of locum tenens for Mr W H Smith, this would have been a significant utterance to have been made by an ordinary member of the rank and file of the Conservative party Sir Edward Clarke is a Minister of the Crown He is still young, is able, ambitious, and has a career before him To declare for Mr Balfour is, of course, to desert Mr Goschen, and the Solicitor-General is too shrewd a man publicly to take such a step without having duly considered it When Lord Salisbury, in due straits after the" resignation of Lord Ran dolph Churchill, made overtures to Mr Grosohou, it in extremely probable that succession to the Leadership in the Commons was part of the price named for the ox Liberals find apostasy But leaders of parties in fighting times are not to be chosen by ballot circles meeting in back parlour The Conservatives won't have Mr Goschen, and they wi-thavoMr Balfour That is the simple state of the case, made unmistakable by the in- discretion of the Solicitor-General The Prince of Wales has just reached Homburg after a railway misadventure which necessitated his driving the last stage of the journey along the road from Trunlrfort HRH was in the first instance ordered to Carlsbad, where the " cure " is much more severe But for some seven or eight years he has been in the habit, as soon as the London season is ever, to fly to Homburg, an unfailing panacea for its excesses, and though he at first yielded to the Carlsbad project, when the time for setting forth arrived his heart fondly turned to Homburg There he is to-day, turning out punctually at 7 in the morning to drink the waters, taking the prescribed baths, eating the regulation food (which alternates between braised beef and braised mutton) and, hardest trial of all going to bed at a moderately early hour But the Prince always benefit by the Homburg cure, and is content to suffer many things in order to renew his life like the eagle Up to last year but one that mock Highland Chief tam, Mackenzie of' Kintail, used to take on himself the duty of ministering to the Prince's fancies his very last triumph was in the season of 1889, when at a garden party given in the outskirts of Homburg he got up a wheelbarrow race, the competitors being the temporary resident nobility and gentry, the barrows being ballasted by fair dames No one present can over forgot the sight of Earl Spencer, Viceroy of Ireland in troublous times, Mr Gladstone's most trusted conn seller, toiling along the gravelled walk, trundling a buxom dame whose face and flashing fan are known in all the best draw Ringarooma in London. But Mr Mackon/io-in the end ins hHo to Kintail was cruelly challenged-is dead, "cutting up" very badly at the end of a not very prolonged association with the Heir Apparent, and Baron Hirsch reigns in his stead How much wiser (from the family heirs' point of snow is the man who walks not with kings, and puts not his trust in princes, is shown in the case of Mr Henry Brassey Whilst Mr Mackenzie, once regarded as rich beyond the dreams of avarice, left but a small p dance behind, Mr Bracey has left over a million sterling in personally, not to speak of properly in houses and land He was a younger son and received a portion accordingly His brother, Lord Brassey who, with his first wife and thou famous acht the Sunbeam, were, I believe, not one town in Sydney is credited with a fortune roan i three millions than one It is odd to think that what Mr Pumblochook used to call the founder of this fortin" was, within the memory of living man, a sturdy navvy earning a pound a week One who has the kindest and fondest recollections of the old man is his eldest son, the nnlhonimo peer Last autumn I chanced to be gray u in a co mary house with Lord Brassey, and he used to talk to me by the hour of his rt dear old father," and of a memorable trip he made with him I when, the navvy having blossomed into the great contractor, he was surveying for a railway that now pierces the Alps, that Bontinol Savoy \VE_rjn_\smt AUGUST 28 Tuesday next will be a memorable day in the history of England On that day free education will be established throughout Great Britain The Act which comes into force on the 1st of Soptein but is a little intricate, being fenced about by various devices natural to a Conservative Government passing a measure appropriated from the programme of their political opponents, and hated and feared by their own shop waters But it cannot fail to effect in the main the great purpose of offer- ing to all children between the ages of three and 15 the inestimable boon of free of education On Tuesday, in accordance with the provisions of the Act, school managers would be called upon to state whether they accept the fee grant proffered them by the Education Department, whether they absolutely declare it, or whether they will wait a A\1U1O and look on This opportunity for consideration 13 strictly limited It is obvious that if it were otherwise the opponents of free education, adopting a dog-in- the-manger policy, might carry out on the basis hitherto established, and nominally providing "sufficient school accommo- dations for a district, might prevent the establishment of free schools The Act, however, decrees that they must make up their minds within 12 months If they do not choose to make their own schools free a free school may, after the 1st of September, 1862, be established The dona- tion from the Treasury is at the rate of 10s a year for each child between three and 16 years in average attendance a sum estimated to be equal to a payment of 6d per week per child for the actual term of school attendance. The political effect of this coup d' what has not yet been fully do\ eloped There is no pretence in any quarter that Lord Salisbury's Government, in carrying the bill, were actuated by unalloyed sympathy with the kind of people to whom 6d a week is a serious matter, or by any uncontrollable enthusiasm on behalf of the spread of education It was bluntly recommended to their recalcitrant followers by the reminder that free education was inevitable, and since it must be done 'twere work 'were done quickly before Mr Gladstone and those terrible Badieals came into force This argument and the habitude of docility which prevails with the Conservative party was effectual in subduing the threatened revolt, and the bill passed through both Houses by large majorities But the objection to it in Conservative. 0 circles was not lessened by the painful duty of carrying it, whilst if the Government hoped to gain any support in the country by this concession to a popular demand they were promptly undo fined by the results of the Wisbech election The managers of the party nos. 01 tireless still hope their virtue shall met with its just reward Before this time next year it is certain the general election must take place Before the dissolution the Free Education Act will have been in operation for several months Hodge and his fellow-labourers in the towns will have saved the r sixpence a week, and, in actual possession of the measure, will surely be inclined to show some gratitude to the giver Such is the calculation sanguinely made at the Carlton Club But grumblers within the Ministerial ranks shake their heads, and remind the leaders of the often proved axiom that gratitude for past favours finds no place in politics That, however, as Mr Rudyard Kipling occa sound) remarks, is another story The great thing is that at last the mother country, walking in the footsteps of the United States and some of her colonies, has at length established free education through the length and breadth of the land. The Queen, cheered by a sv, cot sense of duty done at Portsmouth in connection with the Aasitof the French fleet, has at length settled down at her beloved Balmoral, and will not be seen south of the Tweed till autumn is well advanced The Minister in attendance just now is Mr Arthur Balfour, fresh home from Baironth, whither he went after the toils of the session to seek refresh- ment at the Wagner festival Cabinet Min- sters take it in turn, a fortnight at a time, to attend upon her Majesty when she sojourns in the North It is an honorable position, but has its disadvantages, especially for a man who loves the wood The only paper permitted at B draoral is the big pipe, and that, ployed with vigour and regularity, is apt to pall There are several stories current in Ministerial circles of hairbreadth 'escapes from detection of infringement of the case against tobacco smoking Ono eminent statesman, it is reported, nearly lost his life in consequence of yielding to temptation Locking himself up in his bedroom, stopping up the keyhole, and manoeuvring mats round the foot of the doorway, he opened wide the window and smoked his usual quantum of cigars As the room reeked with the smell thereof, he left the windows open all night, and found himself in the morning enveloped in a thick Scotch mist, equal in its saturating qualities to an average English shower of rain He caught a fearful cold, and for some time hovered between life and death, but he was happily spared to his country. The Prince of Wales escapes dangers and difficulties of this kind and by never visiting Balmoral He is an inveterate smoker, and is personally responsible for the habit now prOA agent in London society of the postprandial cigar The fashion set 111 timidly with cigarettes , now cigars are always passed round after dinner, and large ones are preferred Balmoral is full of memories for the Queen, and of anniversaries, chiefly dismal Her Majesty armed this month, just in time to direct one festival that period the gloomy character of a series in which the ghosts of the Prince Consort and John Brown, the Princess Alice and the Duke of Albany, jostle each other Last Wednesday was the arum orsary of the Prince Consort's birthday Whilst he was yet alive it was the custom of the gentlemen of the household in attendance on the Queen, together with the servants and tenants of the Balmoral, Abergeldie and Birkhall Estates, to assemble at the Obelisk at the stroke of noon and snuff gratuitous w husky in honour of the occasion When the Prince Consort died it seemed probable that this pleasing custom must needs fall into desuetude But some one, probably the late John Brown, had flashed upon him the happy thought of preserving the custom with some necessary alteration in its application They could not any longer "tokens of kindness" AV best wishing the Prince Consort many happy returns of the day, but they might at least drink to his memory Accordingly, at noon on Wednesday, there gathered round the Obelisk the gentlemen of the household, the servants 111 livery and out, and the tenants from Balmoral, Abergeldie, and Birk- hall The whisky cask was broached, glasses were handed round, and in solemn silence under the grey sky this curious gathering applied to the memory of the Prince Consort Our railway stations are just now overrun with the penny-in-the-slot machines By putting a penny in the slot of an ungainly contrivance, something resembling a pillar letter-box, you can get almost anything from a postage stamp to the photograph of a slightly clad actress, from a butter- scotch to a box of matches, from a cake of chocolate to a vilelv-sniolhng compound which squirts itself on to your affronted handkerchief Mr Edison is about to enter the field, and will, as usual, beat creation For the last three years he has devoted a considerable portion of his time to the perfection of the phonograph He now believes he has accomplished his object, and after a prolonged delay that has puzzled many people he intends to make some money out of his invention A syndicate is being formed here with the object of purchasing the monopoly of the new phonograph No appeal has been made to the public, but Colonel Gouraud, Mr Edison's able European representative, has privately and judiciously placed the proposal m hands likely to welcome it It is intended as soon as the syndicate is completed, and the phonograph is got to work, to form another syndicate in Australia to run the phonograph on that continent Afterwards other British colonies and India will be approached, France, Germany, and the rest of the Continental nations each having its special syndicate The part order instrument to be worked is an automatic phonograph, which it is intended shall be placed at all the principal railway stations, hotels, clubs, restaurants, public-houses, theatres, shops, and even on board river and ocean going steamers Every machine will be supplied with a succession of tunes, something after the manner of a barrel organ There will be a programme, including comic and sentimental songs, Burns into the phonograph by well-known artists, comedies, farces, and tragedies, solos, duets, trios, quartettes, s. oral and instrumental, and every Minty of listen mental music, including entire orchestras and regimental bands or those more inclined to literature than music there will be stones, anecdotes, recitations, poems, and, if they like, a speech All they have to do is to drop a penny into the slot, press a button, and place the "phones" by their ears Tlioreupan thou hear distinctly, in the actual tone s of singer 01 reciter, the music or words he has sung or spoken into the phonograph 1 bus, for 1 penny w 0 who will presently be able to -v while away a bad quarter of an hour at a railway ay station by hearing Patti fling, or Irving declaims, or Mr Gladstone announcing the growing force of the flowing tide.
