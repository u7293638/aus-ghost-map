KOOHINGA. [From our own Correspondent.! October 23. The old adage ' Great things move slowly' has most truly been verified in the history of the new bridge that is to span the Burra Creek. There is not the least ap pearance of the iron girders that have been so long looked for to arrive from the old country. X should judge that there was in difference somewhere. Fortunately there have been no flood-waters to try the strength of the masonry, bo long standing like mute statues. The Ghost Illusion Combination Troupe, who performed at the Institute Hall for two nights last week, had very small houses, caused I judge by the continued stream of attractions that have of late been visiting the Burra, Mr. Whyman, who has been exhibiting his model tabernacle in different parts of the colony, has visited the Burra and shown and lectured on the same in four places of worship. It was very interesting and in structive. Mr. Whyman is a good speaker, has a good voice, and makes it worth one's while to attend his exhibition, The weather for the past threel days has : been very hot and close, but now -we have a change in dark clouds, lightning and thunder, with a few rain drops. Our medical staff of three is reduced to one just now. Dr. Nesbitt has gone awaj for a change, and Dr. Dashwood is unable to attend to his patients, so all the practice devolves upon Dr. Brummill, who just now is fully engaged.
