HENRY DUNBAR. [BY THE AUTHOR OF "LADY AUDLEY'S SECRET."] As the bell f of the up-train. ?was tinging, a man came 'eSadenly npoa the pbtiora and loosed about hi ia. ? - ? ,- HereCogaited the banker, walked straight up to trial, and, taking off his hat, addressed I Mr. Dunbar respectfully. I ' 1 tmsdn? t} detain Ton sir,'1 he said; 'bati I hatea warrant to prevent your leaving :Win- -!hesterA«~ , . ' What *o you mean?' ,, - ' t hold a warrant for your apprehension, «sr.'

'Upon what charge ?' cried Arthur Lovell; 11 Upon suspicions of having been concmied . Jji the murder of Joseph Wilmot.' The mUlionaivc drew himself up haughtily, =abd looked at the constable with a proud ?smile. ' Jbia is too absurd,' he said ; ' but 1.. am quite ready to ?&\- with you. Be good enough ? to telegraph to my daughter, Mr. Lovell,' he -added, turning to the young man ; ' tell her ' that circumetances over which 1 have no con* 1 trol will detain toe in vV incheater for a week. Take care not to alarm her.' Everybody about the station had collected ontheplatf-5nn, and made a circle about Mr. Dunbar. They stood a little aloof from him looking at *din with respectful interest ; alto gether- different from the eager clamorous curi osity with -which they would have regarded any' ordinary man suspected o£ the same crime. He was suspected ; but he could not be guilty,* Why should a millinaire commit a murder'? The motives that might influence othfr^ men -could have had no weight with him. The ?bystanders repeated this to one another, as they followed Mr. Dunbar and his custodian from the station, loudly indignant against the mioions'of the law. Mr. 'Dnnba'r, the constable, and Mr. Bal derby': drove straight to the magistrates house. The 'junior partner offered any amount .of bai( fSr his chief; but the Anglo-Indian motioned him to silence, with a haughty gesture, ' I thank you, Mr. Balderby., he said, proudly ; 'but 1 will not accept my liberty on sufferance. Sir Arden Westhorpe has choBen \- to arrest me, and i shall abide the issue of that arrest.*' - It was in vain tbat the junior partner pro tested against this. Henry Dunbar was inflex ible. . . '^1 hope, and I venture to believe, that yon are as innocent as 1 am myself of this horrible ? crimerMr. D unbar,' the baronet said, kindly.; 'a,nwl sympathize witb you in this very terrible position. But upon the information hud before me, 1' consider it my duty to detain you until the matter shall have been futher investigated, ? Yofi-were the last person seen with the ^de ceased* - ' . . ' , ' And for that reason it is snpposed that I' strangled my old servant for the sake of his cloj-hea,'«ried Mr. Dunbar, bitterly. ' I am a stranger in England ; but if tbat is yonr Bugs* lish law, 1 am not sorry that the best part of my life has been passed in India. However, I am perfectly willing to submit to any examin ation that may be considered necessary to the furtherance of jnstice.' So, upon the -second night of his. ., arrival in England, Henry Dunbar, chief of the wealthy house of Dunbar, Dunbar, and BaJAerby. slept in Winchester gaoL , ' OhAPTEB XIII.

But vety little new evidence was.- elicted. The empty pocket-book, which had been found . a «sw pace? irom the body, was produced. The rope by which the murdered man had'. -been strangled, was-also produced and examined. ... iVwastL^common rope, rather' sleiraerr and aboutaryard; and a half in length..

The chtef witness upon this.'. day was the' Te'rgeV; and it was in consequence' of' cfertain}, remarks dropped by him that Henry -Dnnbar had been arrested. .r . .

'Jlfe odd as a gentleman that's just come home from India should complain of the h&aj; ?on such a day. as yesterday,' said one of the bystanders. 'This was the substance of the evidence that 4hp verger gave before Sir Arden Westhorpe, This, with the evidence of a boy who. had met ?the deceased and Henry Dunbar close to the «pot where'the body was found, was the only evidence against the rich man, ' ?'

For this purpose he urged on the police upon tbetraok of the strange man; the' rough look-, ing hawker, who had been seen in the grove on the day of the murder. ,v; , He himself left .Winchester upon another erraind. .
