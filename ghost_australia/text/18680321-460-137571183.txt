POETRY. HAPPIEST DATS. BR, ALICE CABT. The clouds in many a windy rack Are Bailing east and west. And sober suns are bringing back The days I loved the best. The poet, as he will, may go To summer's golden prime, And Bet the roses in a row Along hie fragrant rhyme. Bat as for me, 1 clog the praise Of fading flowers and trees, For, to my mind, the sweetest days Of all the year are these. 'When stubbly hills and hazy skies Proclaim the harvest done, And Labour wipes his brow and lies A-d reaming in the sun And idly hangs the spider on Her broken silver {tair, And ghosts of thistles, dead and gone, \- Glide clow along the air : Wheie all is still, unless, perhaps, The cricket makes ado, Or when the dry-billed heron snaps Some brittle-reed in two Or school-boy tramples through the bunt His tangledjpath tokeep, Or ripe mast, rustling downward, stirs The shadows from their sleep. Ay, he that will* it so may praise The lilies and the bees; IBut, as forme, the sweetest days Of all the yeans ace. these. My darling, in thewoodinud glen ODe hour with me apart, , And let as walk and talk as when . I gave you all my heart. Ah! wrap you with your yeU so thin,. . And let us wajider slow To that delicious bowfcr wherein ? We courted, long ago. , , When dyingvioletaiwent the air,, .
