TO MORROW. BY A CARPER. To morrow. and to morrow, and to morrow, Creeps on this petty pace from day to day, And all yesterdays have but lighted fools The dusty way to death Anxious hearts, aching heads, and tired limbs will he the final feeling of today lo morion will end up with blighted hopes, and mad excitement Ono of the marvels of a gener vl election is the remark iblc men that ale deified at such limes 'lhesteieo typed report runs, “that Mr Brown held i most successful meeting at Gretna Gicen, the audience being loused to enthusiasm by his peroration, and gu mg thr< e cheers at the close of his meeting " Then Mi R ibin son turns up at the svme pi ice, ami the people are gi lively told that Mt Robinson spoke amidst eulhusi vstio plaudits, and was [ assured the vote of nearly cveiy elector A careful study of the pipers dining the last month has revelled the fact \ letona has a rental kable numbci of Demosthenes anxious to seivc her The onlv difficult} is how to reconcile the glowing icpoits of the sec retanes with the halting phrases of the pnneipils The avenge speeches of the campaign give one the uncomfortable feel mg that some agency his been selling a select batch of skeh ton speeches, much the same way as skeleton sermons are bought and sold One time it was necessary for candidates to speak, and spe ik plainly ; now it meiely wants a few well drilled followers to act as Greek choious, and a parrot know ledge of certain phrases with appropriate action between, thus Ml Smith mil his band at rive at Gretna, and after packing the bar fill up the bar parlor “ Gentlemen” is spoken amidst uproarious applause, and by the time quietness has been obtained, the candidate has got as fai as the magic word “Protection,” which word brings the House down, and Mr Smith mouths on amidst the enthusiastic row. One wonders, when he reads the wondrous unininuty with which this fetish is followed, whether these heaven born legislators have my knowledge of the gloi ions associations and splendid demo oratie memories that cluster round the word “ Freetrade ” A well known popu lar Mimstei, fresh fiom London, said once—“ When I was at homo I was a Radical and a Freetrader. I don’t know what the equivalent of that is hero.” Aristocratic notions here are associited with freetrade as a matter of course, and y et there is twined indissolubly -with its memones the names of such giant demoeiats as Cobden, Bnght, Gladstone, and Chamber) un. Is it because vve are at the antipodes that things are so mixed’ Resolving these many questions m my mind I laid my self down to sleep fall of troublesome thoughts about these petty nothings of life, nondeiing how it was possible for “ n vtives” to magnify principles that would grow whether their officious cure was put foith or not; Masons to play marbles again, and think they are moving the world, Orangemen to raise bogies such as we used to delight m when a monster turnip was available; and ordinal ily intelligent men to rapturously adore some modern “ Bottom.” Strange unthankful thoughts they were, aud most unwelcome bedfellows It’s no use saying it-was the supper, because I went to bed supperlcss How or wby doesn’t concern us now; perhaps I was m a bad tern per; perhaps I could not afford one; any way I went to bed supperlcss, aud therefore that common explanation is not available It •nay be that I am, unconsciously, an excel lent “ medium;” and when my perverse will is quiescent the mediuniistic power has full play, and then the dark secrets hidden from finiteminds arerevealed to me. If so. I’m very thankful that it only affects me while asleep I oeitamly would not like to be always jerking the back of my head as a medium I once knew was always doing Anyhow, like Nelmcbaduezzir, I dre lined a dream, and this is what 1 saw—l saw the ghost of many a hot bittle, full of mteiest, and full of inciduit, hut to tell till this would be cruel to the candidates who are anxious to obtain full column advertisements; therefore I will icseive the detailed iiifounaliou till to moriow, aud gave the vision that crossed my path of the homeward journey of the victors It was but fitting that the historical \A esc should fiist flit acioss my troubled view, for it re minded one, in its pieseot amputited state, of the diys when the Colonel used to be able to boast that he had polled the heaviest vote in the colony. Both the Colonel and the AVest stood as they stood m ’74, ami the West, strangely enough, had made itself liable to the sueei cast at it m those days; th it of its two members, one sat one side of the Bouse and tbeother on t! eopposite side, aud nullified each other’s votes; for in the moonlight I saw two victorious military men weudmg their tired way home, a colonel and a non commissioned officer, while from east ward came a faiut rustle of the ficiec storm that had swept across the town, which proclaimed unmistakably the victor Pint the door of the colonel’s seco id, vv ho limped so far behind him I wai dered on, and met several disconsolate, heart sick soldiers on my pathway. They loi ked hopeless, object less, and dejected—all that brilliant self esteem gone; aud, as I passed ne ir, I could hear each one repeating his experience of the day, and one who seemed mini genuinely poetical aud proportionately dejected thus sang “tou are lovely, Wmdermtre, but you are not blithe Your W il i-.ni s they - re sweet, but they 're not called George, You are slippery. not butterly, y ou* can wield y our sev tho And veuve wielded it with such elfict ML A I di-gorge You should, you should hav“ loved me, obstiuctive though I be, - I would have loved you better than that there blanked M‘V and then—then I heard through the daik ness a voice saying mysteriously, gradually •yetting more defined as I got more wakeful, “ Upon my word if you are going to indulge in this sort of thing I’m going in for a divmce ” 1 was avvake by this time, and C included that the poctiy was hardly woith nuking a divorce over, so I kept avvake.
