" While loving Fnney lingers -l To paint an olden day. When youth and beauty crowned it What gny songs used to peal ! Now crickets wall around it— Aunt Martha's spinning-wheel I softly touch the treadle ; It gives a plaintive squeak ; It begs me not to meddle, . In murmurs sad and meek.' Alas 1- the Met that lithely— . Once twinkled through the reel, No inoie shall pat it blithely — Aunt Martha's spinning-wheel. How oft its noisy turning , Hath served a lover's need, V" And kept Age from discerning What only Youth should heed I T would drown both vows and kisses That lovcrs'love to steal.; A dear old trensuro this is — Aunt Martha's spinning-wheel. For fear of houso adorner In search of bric-a-brac, Far in the garret coiner With sighs I put it back ; And there, just as I found it, I leave for woe or weal With ghosts to glide around it, Aunt Martha's spinning-wheel. .
