THOMAS CARLYLE* . -« It is ten years since tho great man who has just passed away placed in the hands of Mr. Froudo a' col- lection of MSS. for publication-if it was deemed fitting-after death. These two volumes of " Reminis- cences " form but a small portion of this collection, and aro now printed immediately after Carlylo's death, in accordance with his own Avieh. It was purposed, indeed, that the type should ho set up' Avhile he was still alive, and could himself revise what he had written. But the effort was found to ho too much for him, and Mr. Froudo haB now entered upon the first part of the solemn duties of his literary exeoutorehip in this publication. A brief preface explains these circumstances - defines the editor's responsibility-and gives tho leading incidents of Carlyle's life. And it may bo said that no more affecting revelation of the sorrows, tho noble tender- ness, tho heroic submission to sufforing of a great heart has been given to tho world for a long time than that which is contained in thoso two volumes. The first of these papers was written some fifty yea« ago in London, at the time of tho death of Carlylo's father indeed within a few days of Carlylo's hearing of that event. It is intituled " James Carlyle of Ecclefechan Mason." It would not perhaps ho an en=y task to search through our literaturo for an nxamplo of more perfect tenderness and power in portraiture. The rugged and yet most gentle Scottish peasant, so strong-so lovable - so simple-so believing, stands out from these pages as a figure perfectly known to us. It is not the least certain note of tho completeness of the work that one forgets in contemplating it the greatness of the tillo to the world's reveronco in tho fact of the man being tho father of Carlyle, and only rests gratefully anti lovingly upon the porfect character of the man himself. Carlyle lingers over the recollections of the sweetness of this noble nature. " Ho was to the last the pleasant03t man I had to speak with in Scotland." Ho is grateful that Heaven has spared him tho separation until ho is able to bear it ; till he too, " by manifold struggles feels his feet on tho everlasting rock j " and can say, not with unwet eyes nor with unsoftened heart, "Blessed are the dead that die in the "Lord ; they do rest from their labours, and their works follow thom." " Yes, their ivorks follow thom. Tho force that had been lent my father ho honourably expended in manful well- doing. A portion of this planet bears beneficent traces of his Btrong hand and strong head. Nothing that ho under- took to do but he did it faithfully and like a true man. I shall look on the houses ho built with a certain proud in- terest. They stand iirm and sound to tho heurt all over his little district. Ho one that comos after him will ever say, * here Avas the finger of a hollow eye-seri-ant.' They aro little texts for mo of tho gospel ol man's fice will. Nor .will his deeds and sayings in any case bo found unworthy not false and barren, but genuine and fit. Nay, am not I also the humble James Carlylo's work '{ I owe lum much more than existence, I owe him a noble inspiring example (now that I can read it in that rustic chaiacter). It was ho ex- clusively that determined on educating mo ; that from his small hard-earned funds sent me to school and college, and made mo whatever I am or may become. Let mo not mourn for my father, let me do worthily of him. So shall ho still live even here in mo, and his worth plant itsolf hon ourablv forth into new generations." The example of his father's life, ho hopes, he oven prayB, God to keep constantly betoro his eyes. Tho liumble Scottish stonemason is to teach his gieat son from the giave. ,rLot mo writo my bool s as he built tis houses. Let me learn of lum." He thanks God humbly and fervently for giving him such a fathor, and has " a sacred pride '' in his pensant father, " and would not exchange him oven now for any king known tome" - "The moro I reflect on it, tho moi o I must admire how completely naturo had taught bim, how completeli ho was devoted to his woik-to the task of his life, and content to let all pass by unheeded that had not rolation to this It is u singular fact, for example, that, though n mon of such openness and clearness, ho hadnoAei, I believe, i ead three pages of Burns' poems Not oven when all about him be camo noisy and enthusiastic, I tho loudest on that m .ttei, did ho feel it worth while to ronew his investigation of it, or once turn his fuco towards it Thopoctiy he liked (he did not call it pootn ) was truth, and the w lsdom of reabtj Bums indeed could have done nothing for him As high a greatness hung over his world as ov« that of Bums-tho ever-present greatness of the Infinite itself Neither was lie, like Bums, called to robel nerainst lho world, but to abourpatiently at hiB task there, uniting tho possiblo w ith the necessary to bring out the i eal, AV herein also IOA an ideal Hums could not have in any way strengthened him in this ourse,and, therefore, was for luina phenomenon rnerelv Nay, rumour had been so husj with Burns, and destiny and »is own deseit had in verv deed so marred his namo that the good rather avoided him Yet it was not vi ith aveision that uiy father regarded BurnB, atwoistwith índifrcrenco aud neglect I have heard bim speak of onco seeing lum stand- ing in ' Rob Scott's smithy ' (at Ecclefechan, and no doubt superintending somo work) Ho heard ono say, ' lhere is the poet Burns ' Ho w ont out to look and saw a man ivith boots on, like a well-dressed farmer, walking down the ullage on tho opposite sidoot tho bum This was all tho relation theso two mon oier had tbej weio A en neirlj coevals f I knew Kobert Binns, and I knew my father \ et were you to 03k me which had tho gi eatei natural faculty, I might perhaps actually pause beforo reply mg Burns had an infanitelj widei education, mj fathoi a fin wholesoniei Besides, tho ono was a man of musical utter- ance, tho other Avholh a man ot action, with speech sub- liment thereto Novoi, of all the mon I have seen, bus ono come personally m my way in whom the endowment fiom naturo and the arena from fortuno weio so utteily out of nil proportion I have said this often, and parth know it As a man ot speculation-had cultmo ovei unfolded him -he must havo gone wild and desperate us Bums , but he was a man of conduct, and work keeps all right AVbat stiango shapeable creatmes no aro ' AI\ fathei's education Avas altogether of tho worst and most hunted 1 uehoie he was neioi moro than three months at ary school AVhnt he learned there showed what he might havo le lined A solid knowledge of arithmetic, a fmo antique handw riting-those, with other limited practical etceteras, wero all tho things ho ever heard mentioned ns excellent Ho hud no room to Btnvefor more Poetiv, fiction m goneiul, hohidunivor 6ally seen treated as not only idle, but falso and ci munal 'Ibis was the spiritual eloment he had lived in, almost to old age But greatly his most important cultuiohehad gathored-and this, too, bv his own endeavoui s-from tho hotter part of the district, lho religious men , to whom, as to the most excellent his own naturo gradually attached and attracted him Ho was îeligious vvith tho consent of his whole faculties AA'ithuut religion ho would havo been nothing Indeed, his habit of intellect ivas tho- roughly free, and oven ineieditions And strongly enough did the daily ovumplo of thi» woik aftcivv uds on mc ' Putting out tho natural ejo of his mind to seo better with ateleseopo'-this was no schemo foi lum But ho was m Annandale and it was above fifty joirs ago,X and a ¿o-ptl was still preached theie to the heart of a man in the tones of a man Religion was tho polo star tor m\ father Kudo and uncultivated as he othorw ise was, it n ade him and kepthira 'in all pointa a mun ' Oh ' when I think tint all the area in boundless space ho had reen was hnutid to ti cn ela of some fiftj miles diameter (ho never in his hfo was farther or elsowhero so far norn homo as at Ciaigen puttoch), and all his 1 nowledDo of tho boundless lime was derived fiom his Biblo and what the oial memories of old men could give bim, mid his own could gather and j ot, that he was such I could take shume to mys»lf I feel to my father-so gient though so neglected, so gouerous nl«o towaids me-a htiango tenderness, and mingled pity and rev oí "neo peculioi to tho caso, infinite!

This was drawn in 18GG (Irving died in 1834) ; aud Carlyle says after these thirty-two years bad passed away, " The memory of him is still clear and vivid willi mo in all points.his last visit as fresh as if it had been yesterday ; and bo has a solemn massivo and even pitiable though not much blamable or a heart oven blamable, and to mo always dear and most friendly aspect in theso vacant kingdoms of tho past." The family of lho Irvings lived near Oarlylo's birthplace, and were all known to his fathor. If time and space permitted, a sketch of Irving's schoolmaster might bo adverted to-who Avas also once or twice for a few v?eolc3, as substituto for some absentee, Carlylo's teacher. Carlyle eulogises the schoolmaster's attainments - geometry, Latin, arith- metic, English syntax. " But Avhot ho did profess or imagino himself to know ho knew in every fibre, and to lho very bottom. A more rigorously solid teachor of the young idea, so far as ha could carry it, you might bave searched for through tho Avorld in vain."

It would bo a hind of profanity to attempt an analysis, in however roverential a spirit, of the heart- breaking paper on Jane Welsh Carlyle. One feels In the présence of a spirit so fair and bright, " with some- thing of angelic light "-of a sorrow so crushing and complete that to intrude upon it is to "taste the grave, and to enter into the regions and possession of Death." -Wo shall leave this portion of the book untouched. Ti is too sacredly beautiful for criticism. In an appendix is given Carlylo's recollections of some men of loiters whom he had met with in his ' life. The paper containing these remembrancoB is of a very fragmentary and imperfect nature. It is characteristically intituled " Reminiscences of Sundry," and is dated as having beon begun on January 28, and finished on March 8, 18C7, at Montono (Alpes Maritimes). The paper is of little value as a matured critical judgment of the genius and plaeo in our literature of any of the distinguished men who are spoken about by tho author. Indeed, it com- mences by a repudiation of the title of any of them to real greatness as being worthy of more than a transient remembrance ; and none of them Avere to Carlyle, to uso his own words, "ever virtually interest- ing, or consummately admirable." Southey is the subject of the first of these recollections. Of the time when he became first acquainted with Southey's books Carlyle can give no account. It is probable that it was long after Southey was widely known and admired. It is possible that it was not till ho had become poet laureate, and was exposed to the tempest of abuse and malignity which that appointment provoked. Indeed, Carlyle's attention appears to have been called to the poet rather by his humiliations than by his achievements, by the abuse and slander and heartless attacks of newspaper Yvritors, superficial reviewers, and contemptible ptimph loteors, rather than by the rare genius, the true nobility of life, and that which in late years Carlyle found in the man-the " piety, the gentle deep affection, tho reverence for God and man, full of self pity, like the wailings of a mother, and )-et with a claug of chivalrous valour finely audible too." Carlyle enjoyed the attacks upon Southey, and it was not till a year or two later that his poems seem to have como to tho hands of Carlyle. He then read " Thalaba," " Curso of Kellarna," " Joan of Aro," and these at once awoke in his broast kind- lier and more respectful fooling. His estimate of Southey is pretty much that of Thackeray in the well known passage in one of his lectures, where he says that although wo have left tho poet's old political land- marks miles and miles behind, protest against his dog- matism-nay, begin to forget it and his polities shrewdly suspect that in the contest between Time and Thalaba theformor is the victorious destroyer, and that few people are now frightened by the Curse ofKehama, yet that tenderness and admiration and reverence will be cherished for his iifo as long as kind hearts Uko to sympathize Avith goodness and purity and love, and upright life. It was in 1830 or 1837 that Carlyle made the acquaintance of Southey, through the friendly offices of the author of " Phillip A-on Artevelde." At this interview Southoy quoted some verses Avhiok Carlylo somehow belioved to bo Southey's own, but Avhich, on being questioned, he, declared to bo Praed's. Carlyle still cherished the suspicion that the verses were Southey's, notwithstand- ing tho disavowal ; but ho subsequently met-ho de- clares-with the same A-ersosin some review of a reprint of Piacd s works. Hie recollection of this quotation of Soulhoj s suggests a few sentences concerning Praed himself It is veiy doubtful whether Cailjlo had ani thing beyond the merest superficial acquaintance with Piaed Indeed he speaks of him as if ho derived his knowledge from a "biogiaphical sketch bv some pious and regretful old friend of his," and rather refers to his academic and political distinctions than to his literary perfoi manees But surely there is nothing in tho Aiorld to justifv the assertion that "the poor A oung man died and sunk at once into oblivion tiagical, though not unmonted nor ettraordmaty." Poor Piaed, vvho=e brightness and quamtness, and Hood lile combination of pathos with humour, were so fascinating-and whoso cmeei gave promise of such bnlliant achievement, is, however, refeired to in the=o terms of sad disparagement, and v et ono might have thought that if Carlile cared little for the author of Lidian s Love, ho would havo had a kindly anda grateful remom bl anco ol tho man who sang of the Covenanters ' mangled and marred upon the bloody pil- low ot their rest ' in the " Lament for Bothwell Iii ig¿;. ' Soulhey would of course, havo loiod and ad nired Pned who deeply reveronced Southej s genius In ono of his most touching pieces to his wife, nccomoany ing a presi ntation of Southey s hooks Praod asks hor to 'pn/o these tomes of golden rhjmo" Of Southei's inten=o sonsibiliti, his highly wrought lierions exutabihtv, the manifest sufienng which un kmdness of anv sort caused him, and tho fervour of his happinc=s when the " pleas int theme AI as touched genially, Carlj le spoako with much eloquence Look ing on the fint faco of the poet with its " amiable red blush, beautiful is a A oung girl s,' when he washapDy, and the serpent like flash of blue or block blush (this fact very few rarely knew though it did occur too) when you start upon the opposite" Corljlo marvois how the man had managed to keep alne-had not boen torn asunder hi his sensibilities-furiously pulling this way and that And with noble chanty, and perhaps AYith deep philosophy, he solves the dilliculty by attributing bouthej's preservation to his "thoroughly honest heart." Ihote are many pa0eb devotod to Southoy , but Aiith tho exception of a passage having referenco to Sholley, thero is not much to interest the reader in Cailjlo's leeollections of the poet They spoke of Sholloi, of whom and of whose life Southey spoke " without bitterness, but with contemptuous sorrow and evident aAeision mingled with pity."

Of all epithets to be applied to Shellei, sm ely that of " colourless" is the unhappiost A deeper and a subtler critic has not failed to point out that no one since ¡shakespeare and Spen6er has painted so magnificently " The sanguino sunrise, with his meteor eyes, And his burning plumes out-preud ' About 1810 Carlyle mot Wordsworth.

I had Y'ariouB dialogues with him in that ,-umo room ; but those, 1 judge, wer« all or mostly ot after date." The judgment is so strange, so utterly unaccountable, that one is tempted either to doubt the value of Carlyle's critical faculty in poetry, or to suppose, for example, that such a man as the author of the " Christian Year " in tho well-known dedication of his Preleotions on Poetry, delivered before the University of Oxford, and inscribed to AVordsworth, was guilty of meaningless extravagance of eulogy. But it is idle to speculato upon the matter. It is inexplicable that Carlyle should have so regardod one, of Avhom it may be said that from millions of cultivated men and women " thoughts of gratitude fall like dow upon his grave ; " as the great poet himself sang in the prelude, of his own thoughts of a humble creature whom he had loved. And it is the more marvellous because in the works of no other poet in our language, one Avould have thought could Carlyle have found such pure sources of whatever poor human consolation can be found for such suffering as ho was doomed to hear, as in those of him who showed how " The primal duties shine aloft like stars : The charities that soothe, and heal, and bless, Are scattered at the feet of men-like flowers." AVe havo abstained from allusion to some of the wilder utterances about contemporary men of genius (entirely unworthy as the utterances are of the name of criticism) Avhich are to bo found here and there. Most lamentable is that upon Charles Lamb and his sister, which we think might, and indeed ought, not to have been allowed to disfigure the awfully affecting picture of Carlyle'B domestic life in which it appears. No estimate of the most delicate humourist, and one of the very noblest men of letters in the literature of England, is more false, more cruel, and more absolutely unintelligible than that which is unfortunately con- tained in this allusion. To Carlyle Elia presented but " a ghastly make-believo of wit," '^diluted in- sanity," and even his physical infirmities, his stutter, and his trembling gait were tho " emblems of imbecility, bodily and spiritual.'' Alas! that such heartless and revolting absurdities, flung, as it were, in the face of the world's love and pity, should have disturbed the solemn religious frame of mind into which one is put by the contemplation of so much nobleness, so much truth and real grandeur of soul as are to he found in this book.
