THE BLUE MOUNTAIN EXTLE. We find the following effusion in the October j number of " All the Year Round." Who the Exile' is, may -aisly be guessed; and it is not I ore citable to Victoria that cannot provide for an old I jBsn, who has made some noble contribution i J to English literature, a more congenial employ ment than that of mining registrar of a desolate gold field : — From his hut he goes forth, to gazo on the night, 1 he old- starr,' story, with mists around the dome ; And, below, 'us a squalid and desolate sight ; A hideous monotony mud-gleams and gloom. Beyond, sleeps the i rest, all dark ; and between, Gold-digging, deserted, like huge graveyards yawn (The Last Day long pass'd for earth's work'd out scene), From whose gaps both the soul and the body ars gone. Back-gazing he broods on bis lonely retreat ; The blue- curtained lattice gleams faint o'er the swamp; No living thing waits there his footsteps to greet, He will find a void cell, and his time-warning lamp. \- His arms are grown hard by the swing of the axe ; His palms dry and gram'd by the sap of the wood ; Biz hair, once all waves, now m wmd-hackled flax, But he feeleth no change in his blood. The winde are gone down, the night-hours-, are dead, Yet tilence so sad that it hints of no dawn ; The Blue Mountain hurricanes rang round his head, v Then left him m statue-trance firm though for- , < lorn. \ T/he black snake lies torpid beneath the dead log, "" Or creeps o'er the sludge to the mouldermg dell Where luminous fungi, and leaden- grcy frogs, Each other confronts,— spell-bouud, and a spell. By the cold voter-reptiles' humming quire, . The silence is magnetised : hark ! the weird tune ! A charred trunk appears — the black ghost of fire : -Bogs and frogs, and the mist, aud the moon. In this Hades of hopelessness, think not he grieves. Or feels his etroug soul-life one moment despond \- He believes m himself, because ho believes ' -."In tho voice of a spirit beyond !
