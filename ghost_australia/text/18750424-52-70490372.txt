ON THE TERRACE. Tho stately lady, the grave, calm man, Stood on tho terrace together ; 'Mid the bright rose thickets the revellers strayed, From lawn to fountain tho children played, And hidden music sweet melodies rande, At the foto in the summer weather. With careless, languid courtesy, She bent to hear him speak Of tlie newest book and the latest piny, Of the keeuest move in the statesman's fray, Of the freshest topic of the day, Or the marvel of tho week. Lightly with his practised tongue, He touched on all and each, With hero a sneer and thora a jest, And now a grave word as to attest, " I give yon the fonm on the top-the rest No passing band can reach." Yet once, ah me, how long ago 1 Each one was all to the other ; When every whispered word of his Woke hor young heart to a dream of bliss. Does tho ghost of first love's trembling kiss Still lingering round them hover ? The measure of tho music changed; On the summer hreezo there stolo A low, sweet, simple, homely air, Such as one listens to everywhere. To the two who lounged on the terrace there It spoke as to heart and soul. Her proud hoad drooped, his low voice coaaed : For a moment in thought they stood, Young, eager, fearless, happy and true, As whoo, no cold wisdom claimed her duo, When lovo was fresh and hope was now, At the tryst in tho solemn wood. A vivid flush on tho stern bronzed face, A tear in tho largo bluo eyes, Then buck to tho world nnd its talk ognin : Custom closed chill o'er the instant's pain, For thought was a lolly and memory vain, In the path that before them lies. An ugly wart is a difficult thing to got off onoa hands Au ugly daughter still more difficult.
