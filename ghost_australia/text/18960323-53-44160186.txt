A GHOST STORY. A. GHOST story, of a kiud which has now become almost obsolete, has been sent by a correspondent in the Fen country -: to an English contemporary.' The inhabitants of the fenny district between Peterborough and Wisbech have been thrown into a state of great excitement of lato by the report that an old farmhouse near Thorney was haunted, and that the residents, a farmer named Wilson and his wife, had been obligedlo leave their abode. It appears that the inmates of the house were first made aware of the presence of the mysterious visitors by j hearing several knocks on the door of the house, and this continued for some time, until matters got to be so unbearable, and the wife became so upset, that, had she continued in the home, serious consequences might have resulted. The "ghost" invariably commenced operations by a series of very gentle taps on windows aud door, the force of the knocks gradually increasing until they finished up with a terrific crash which shook the house. The fame of the haunted house soon spread, and thousands of persons have visited the place, including several spiritualists, one or two taking up their abode in the house for the night, but being obliged to leave it before i morning dawned. A school inspector, who had been examining some children, paid a visit to the farm out of curiosity, and the ; knocks were heard as he held the door open. This gentleman became so deeply ' impressed that he wrote to the neighboring ; clergyman that he was convinced it j was a "spiritual manifestation." Another gentleman from Wisbech, said to have the strongest nerves in. tho eastern counties, j was obliged to take his departure from the house after hearing the knocks, and many people irom long distances, bent on investi- gation, have been unsuccessful in their, endeavors to lay the ghost. ,
