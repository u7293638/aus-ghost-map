THE REV. G. MULLER. The Albert-street Baptist Church rvns packed to overflowing last night, on tho occa sion of tho Rev. G. Miillcr delivering an ad dress. Long before the honr for commencing the discourse tho audience began to take their seats, and by tho time the service commenced there was hardly standing room in the pas sages. Several ministers of various denomina tions occupied seats on tlio platform. The reverend evangelist chose his text from the general Epistle of Jude, 1st chapter, 30th vorse : â€” "But yc, jny beloved, building up your selves ou your most holy faith, praying in the Holy Ghost, keep yourselves in tho love of God, looking for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ unto eternal life." In a long and earnest address Mr. Miiller exhorted his hearers to lead a better life, to add to their faith, knowledge, temperance, . Godliness and charity. He also pointed out very strongly the great good which was to bo gained by search- ng tho Scriptures. The address was listened to attentively throughout. At the close the Rev. Allen Webb announced that it was the intention of the Evangelical Society of Austra lia to defray Mr. and Mrs. MiiUcr's expenses to Australia. Subscriptions wuuld be received during the week for thnt purpose.
