Starter-Mr. G. Watson. Handi capper- Mr. E. T. Barnard. Clerk of (be Coarse-Mr. F. Johnson. Timekeeper-M& T. Gannt Secretary-Mr. H. Byron Moore. Since the inauguration of the Victoria Derby it has never created more interest than it has daring the present season. The extra ordinary form shown by Newstead at the 1884 spring meeting of the Y.R.G, established him at once in public favour, and, notwith standing warnings from the press, his infatuated admirers supported him so freely that, during the winter, he stood at & ridiculously short figure, and not until it was freely whispered abroad that one of hisJegs betrayed symptoms of lameness-did the gallibJe public stay its hand. How he came to Victoria, and how the bubble burst after he had a ooupleof gallop.!.-? a matter of history. Next in public ; t some time stood Monte Chris to, tvi Jralla was introduced, but thede ;<iat of l*o>h of these dispelled the illusion so for a? they were concerned. Nothing daunted by these oversea, Briton-like, turf speculators returned t) the charge, and after Newatead'a «Jispos?J Nordenfeldt was choeen as the people representative. No matter how em phatically the owner and his Mends denied that the si ible had backed him, and notwith standing iite public statement of his owner that lie would endeavour to win the Derby . ;Mi tme of Us' own breeding, the public tu.dc to liisimost tenaciously, Nordenfeldt .was their idol, and the Hem. James White found it impossible to shake their faith in hi en. As ' he sequel proved they worshipped at a *brinc which proved orthodox. New Zetland contributed her share to the ill izv&t; Jt# tcrkling two formidable jeproeentai. .iitegf io. to wreptYOB'blpenbaild from me, & r. i South Australians believed they h &<3 & cajxiJfle substitate for Newsteadin isosiomy, whose capabilities ftbuloos gtorica were 5n ciwnilatioiL Still the public folkttj?«4 him, mi ifedr, uIciiov^if^Hise close relationship to iiartini Hc»iy.l^bad always endeared him to then*,, and to A Wbole the nameofJTordenfcldt had the Derby 4af JBS5.

His Excellency Sir Henry Loch waB accompanied by cir William Robinson and a party of ' | who occupied the viceregal box duringtheday. and in the grand stand enclosure we noticed ? representatives from every colony. Signor Zelman's band of talented performers played a choice selection of music, and as there was no chance for a promenade, the ladies re mained in the stand, and enjoyed the selec tions performed so admirably. As a nttfural consequence of the rain the track was heavy, though not quite so bad as it was expected to be under such unfavourable circum stances. . As is customary at the Bpring meeting ot the V.R.C., the proceedings opened with the Melbourne Stakes, which maintained its intercolonial charactcr, for New Zealand, Tasmania, New South Wales, and Victoria were all represented. This colony, unfortu nately, had nothing within one-and-twenty pounds of Commotion to champion its cause, , but the pony Ringmaster was considered most worthy of confidence, and, having a strong j party behind him, he quickly advanced to the . position of first favourite. Trenton, fur | whom A. Robertson was retained, had plenty of admirers, the confidence reposed in him being justified by the appearance of the horse, for there was no more racing-1 like animal in the paddock. Mozart was scarcely so fit as when he ran f lit the spring meeting last Beason, but: Sheet Anchor created a most favourable im pression, the Balinrat horse being turned out in Mr. Thomas Wilson's best- style, but i Prometheus was not strung up to concert .pitch, for which an excuse could be ottered, ias the son of Larline had been suffering from acute rheumatism, and had to be eased in his work. Considering the short time Hos worth had been in work, the old brown looked re markably well, and no fault could be found | with the condition of Honeydew or Cyclops. When die horses had tiken the preliminary canter, the well-know "orm of Mr. George Watson was deec: ;r(i Merging from the | weighing - room, :-«.! « 1 sarty round of applause gree<-^ him as 1 <; -ode on to the' coarse. His "fksf start yi'.u - he resumed active dnty would have lw.4 excellent] one had it not been for bosft orth : ^pping at the post when the fix; fell, by whii he lost at least a dor.cn icngths before i was in pursuit of the others. He nuickly on-! strated, however, that he had lost uot ">f his pace, for by tW time they bridge he had run 1 ' sumed command they nw * , i ? ??? t>\: . i.-i *}.<.;* rjt< wp ;> 1 ... . ?

For the Hotham Handicap a field of a dozen faced Mr. Watson, and Comet appeared to have the call in the wagering, though Doncaster, Ment more, Agitation, Signor, Chuckster, and Lesbia also received a good deal of support After often disappointing her friends, the little filly Lesbia at last consoled her party with a victor}-, the light weight and the ground serving the daughter of Tim Whifiler. An hour was now devoted to luncheon, and then five numbers were hoisted on the board for the Weight-for- Age Hurdle Race. As The Agent was one of the number, his admirers readily laid a shade of odds on uim. Duration, who also was In capital form, had | a strong body of supporters, and though ] Royal Mud was a trifle above herself, she; had a few backers. Gasalicr had performed so indifferently atGaulfieid that her owner refused 100 to 5 about her, though he was not quite satisfied with the manner in which she was ridden on the pre vioua occasion of the mare appearing in public, and he considered it advisable to change the jockey, with an extraordinary result, as the aequel will Bhow. Molrow was altogether oat of place in such company. Gasalier made the running for three-quarters of a mile, when ltoyalilaid deprived tier of die lead. The favourite was lying fourth for most of the journey, but .as they approached the home stretch be drfew w> closer, and when Royal Maid's condition failed her he joined issue/ with <3asalier and Duration. The latter was the fort to cry enough but the Gipps Land mate stuck gallantly to her task, and/ as/ Ferguson was shaking his whip at/the favourite It WAS thought he was in t The Wescern jockey, however, was "Melding, and won easily. The snlMnt little son of Slanderer and his jockey loudly cheered at tbejr returned to the closure. Fourth on the list came ti bjmoag Plate, and the whole of the 3 bend on the card were announced-tyi t Nothing in the paddock attract jd ifioje atten tin than Lamond's handsome pair n chest note, Blairgowrie and Chesham,totpof whom looked blooming, though^notas hixflly wound Bas Acme, Halcyon, and others. /The Hon. bum White's two neld a very/large levSe, and the unanimous verdict was m favour of AaBfl^ trho iras in splendid fotn, and look* ing aa fifisb as the morning dofr.

The hazy state of the atmosphere prevented the colours being easily distinguished, but after they crossed the tan Acme, in the centre of the course, Blairgowrie, Maddelina, and Louise Berta were most prominent Even at this early stage, however, Hales was Bitting Quietly upon the favourite, while the other jockeys were hard at it, and galloping up the straight like a mountain hare, she passed the post the easiest of winners, amidst a perfect salvo of applause, which was repeated as Hales brought her back to weigh in. Her backers received a shock when they saw that the popular jockey did not draw the weight, and quite a load was removed from their minds when the bridle was placed in the scale, and Mr. Miles proclaimed the welcome " Right" This was Wales's first victory in the Marlbyr nong Plate, and he was congratulated upon having broken the ice, while the Hon. James White also camc in for the usual compli ments. This was his fourth triumph in the great two- year-old race, Palmyra, Segenhoe, and Iolanthe having carried his blue and white banner to victory in previous years. Considering the state of the ground and the atmosphere, the time was marvellously fast, and as the winner could have reduced it, she must be reckoned among the wonders of the Australian turf. Acme, who was bred by her owner at his Kirkham stud, in New South Wales, is a brown filly, standing barely 15 hands. Her head is of the very sensible de scription, somewhat of the ltomnn type, per haps, but well set on to a symmetrically formed neck, which is let in to excellent shoulders. Her well- knit back is followed up by exceedingly fine quarters, long and fiat on the top, like Commotion's, and she has great width between the hips. Added to these, she has a capital set of legs, and looks like training on longer than any of Mr. White's previous Maribyrnong Plate winners. Her engagements include the Normanby Stakes, Ascot Yale Stakes, V.ltC. Derby, Oaks, and St Leger; also, the A.J.C. Cham pagne Stakes, Derby, and Oaks. This was her third successive victory, (he A. J.G. Rich mond Stakes and V.A.T.C. Foal Stakes having been won by her. A selling race was sandwiched between the Maribyrnong Plate and the Derby, and this produced a good race between Albanus, Scaramouch, and Soto, who finished in the order named, but the judge made a mistake in hoisting the num bers. First of all only two numbers were put up, Albanus being placed second, butaiter some delay this was rectified, and Scaramouch was placed second and Solo third. The win ner was Albanus.
