TheMaldorrbranch moved—" That no branch shall accept any person as an apprentice of the said branch'"if" sudli person" is riot'a resident of the district that the branch embraces." Mr.-.S'outh;--one- of- the Maldon delegates, spoke at length on the subject, hi? remarks being heartily endorsed by the delegates. Mr. M'Lachlan (-Ballarat) seconded (lis reso lution, and gave experiences to ' show that the resolution should be carried. ' Mr. Lewis (Bendigo) was of. opinion that the;/ should take the matter into serious considera tion, as lie knew for a fact that some drive'.s were making a business of taking apprentices. One driver in Bendigo he knew hail four appren tices, and looked on the matter as a monetary speculation. They should limit the number of "Mr. Morton (Malmsbury), Mr. Cartney (Kgcrton), 'Mr.' Carniah (Castieinaine) and Mr. Ryan (Bendigo) supported the resolution. The latter said it was becoming a serious matter. Many old drivers refused to take apprentices, but other's.outside of the association were, mak ing a business of it. If a young man could not be taken as an. apprentice in his own district there must be something radically wrong, and other districts should-not take-them. He never knew a Bendigo mining manager that would take an inexperienced driver if lie could possi bly get an.experienced man. ... Mr. West (Maryborough) said it ail rested with themselves. They should be careful to onjyJustrue.Lsuitahle. persons.. ...As far'as ex perienced drivers were concerned they had nothing to fear;. Ho knew that in Maryborough an inexperienced driver would not have the " ghost of a show" of obtaining a billet. Mr. Wall (Allendale) was in favor of lending a helping hand to all young men. They should not try and block then'. The president said it was not a question of blocking anyone, They only wanted to regulate the matter. On the suggestion of Mr. M'Lachlan, it was decided to add to the motion that an apprentice having to go to another district lie granted a clearance, and be received by another branch. The motion as amended was unanimously carried. St'fiiKVISlON" OF FACTORY ROIT.KI15S. Mr. "Ryan (Bendigo) stated that there wa3 no official to supervise factory boilers, and see that they were fit to work.
