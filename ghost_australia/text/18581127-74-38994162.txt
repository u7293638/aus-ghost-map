The following memorial to the Bishop, affirming the great prin ciplces of Christian Union, without pledging the memorialists to any specific action in relation to them, is now in. process of signature among the members of the Church of England: T" To the Right Reverend Augustas, Lord Bishop of Adelaide. "We the undersigned, members of the United Church of England and Ireland, cordially attached to her doctrines, ritual and polity, and venerating her as an honored branch of the Universal Church of Christ, believe, nevertheless, .that other ecclesiastical associations, national and otherwise, adhering to the same doctriies though differiing in their forms of worship and government, are also essential integral portions of the same Evangelical Catholic Church. "We believe, moreover, that as members of this one Church, in union with the same Divine HIead, partaking of the same grace, re Joicing in the same glorious hopes, it is incumbent upon all to love as brethren, and though as yet unable to seeeye to eye on matters non essential, to exercise meanwhile mutual forbearance, to hold the faith in unity of spirit, in the bond of peace, and in righteousness of life, and to emulate each other in works of charity, and in strenuous efforts for the world's evangelization and the Church's purity. "Entertaining such sentiments, we have hailed with cordial satis faction your Lordship's recent letter to a distinguished minister- of another Church on the subject of Christian Union; not indeed that we, any more than your Lordship, can reasonablyindulge in the.hope of such general organization of the Churches as you have there sketched being. speedily if indeed ever realised, but because of the truly catholic Christian spirit that per vades it, anid of the readiness it evinces on your part to recognise, in the accredited ministers of other denominations, fellow laborers in the.Gospel of Christ, called and set apart to the work it may be hoped by the Holy Ghost, though not through the channel of an apostolic episcopate-thereby shewing that like many of the brightest orna ments of the reformed Anglican Church, your Lordship wisely dis tinguishes between what is essential to the being, or existence, of a Church, and what to its well-being -what is necessary to the validity .of ministerial completeness. "While, therefore, fully appre ciating, and to a great extent sym pathising in, your Lordship's kindly efforts to bring about, if possible, a closer fellowship of the Churches t so realising more fully their essential a oneness---we earnestly hope and pray that these may be received in the spirit which dictated them, and Y that, at least, nothing may be per e mitted to arise, through misappre hension or othewise, either from withinor from without the pale of our communion, to frustrate your a Lordship's laudable and truljr Chris tian intentions. "With every sentiment of res pect, we beg to subscribe ourselves, Syour. Lordship's obedient, faithful servants."
