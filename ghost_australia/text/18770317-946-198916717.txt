Both were held in high esteem in the district, and all the neighbors rendered tbe kindest help in every possible way. Mr Cooper has left a wife and several children to tho tender care of Him who is the Father of tho fatherless and tho helper of the widow. A new chapel is likely soon to be erected at tho Leven, on ground kindly given by Mr Quiggin, of Hawthorne, Victoria, and a subscription list in aid of the building fund has been commenced. Trustees have been appointed by the Loven Church in conjunc tion with this committee, and a trust deed is now in course of preparation. Tho dissension at Rose Vale, which your committee were constrained to mention in their last report, has been modified. Tho building that nt that time had just, been erected in close proximity to the Rose Vale church has been removed a short distance. Fornightly serviced continue to be held us usunl ; these are well -attended, and the committee hope that returning peace will once more be followed by prosperity. One of the evils, and not the least, attendant on' this unfortunate disturbance tins been the closing of the public school at Rose Vale.' This is felt to be a severe loss to the district, and it is hoped that the school will speedily bo re-opened in accordance with the earnest, wishes of parents and children. ? ; Your committee regret to report : that during the past year their circle has been invaded by death. Mr W. S. Button, who for many years had been a member of t lie Northern branch, and also its Treasurer, died , in September last, and tho committee felt that they wero only discharging their duty when they placed ? on record their high appreciation of his Chrixtian character, and of the services ho had rendered to the Church of Christ. Mr C. S. Button, son of the deceased gentleman, was elected by the committee to fill the vacancy. At Now Town, the Sandhill, anifProspect Village services and Sunday Schools have been conducted as heretofore. '? - The 'attention of the committee has been called to various openings for Christian work on the East Coast; but hitherto they have not been able to respond to the appeals. so raado. They would, however, take this opportunity to pointout to all old-established churches the necessity of recognising the fact that on them devolves tbe duty of con veying the gospel to those beyond. It seems to be too often forgotten that when those, who. are well able to support their own minister without external aid— and probably to do a little for others if so disposed — fnil ' in this respect they hinder the spread of the gospel. The unneeded help which they re. ceivo is so much taken from localities less favored than their own. Freely they have received — freely they must give, and; de vo.ntedly they must labor. The. tin mines at' MountBischoff on the west ; the gold and tin - mines and the shte quarries on tho east, are daily coming into greater prominence; and as population is flocking to those distant localities bent only on accumulating wealth, the listening Christian may hear from all quarters the Macedonian cry — ' Come over and help us.' The spiritual wants of the people scattered through the bush .are be coming increasingly urgent, and demand the most combined and energetic efforts of the Christian Church to overtake them. As the committee remarked in their last report in connection with this subject, it is not prose-, lytesto a sect, but converts to Christ that should be the invariable aim of missionary work ; remembering that the promise of salvation is not only to us and to our chil dren, but ' to- all that are afar off,' even, as', many as the Lord our God shall call.'
