LOYAL TO THE LAST. CHAPTER XI. By M. F. O Malen. Aouther of "A Fatal Silence" "A; Daugh- ter of the Philistines Neither Widow nor Wife," Three," "Some Per son or Persons Unknown, etc., PUBLISHED BY SPECIAL ARRANGE-; .s- -MENTi' Nothing w as missing in the Grange in the morning, and no lock had been forced, Hannah said, when Helen went into the kitchen to question heir. “Mariar left the passage window open,” she added, “and I scolded her well for her carelessness, although .you can’t: expect her to get into decent ways all of a sud den after her bringing up; but I don’t be lieve a man could have squeezed in-there if he’d tried ever- so much. It was,the board creakin ’you heard, miss, you may depend.” ' ' But P.C. Mills, who appeared on the scene at this -moment, -disposed -of her theory summarily. , . - “I saw the man myself,”-he said ' “but I couldn’t ketch him.” ' ' “Not likely, you stupid!” said Helen to herself, parenthetically.;. “No man can see behind his back.” Cheered by his own. good intentions, Mills proceeded to descant upon his per sonal prowess,- as i£-he had had a hand-to hand encounter with the burglar instead of following him for a little-while at a safe distance. - ; ‘ ' “I seed- him in the village,” continued Mills, narratively, “and I.didn’t .quite like the looks of him. I remembered you said Miss Moore’s murderer was tall- and slim, and light-headed, and so thinks I, I'll keep my eye on you, my fine fellow!” _ “If you kept your eye on him 'all the time,' why did you let him get into the house ?” “I lost sight of him just as I turned the corner by the churchyard,, and l ’spect he hid-behind the gravestones, but I thought I knew what he was after, and so I came along here and waited.” _ ' “In hiding, I ’spose,” said Hannah. “No,” said Mills, “I had no call to hide. I wasn’t ashamed of anything I was ado ing.lt was for him to hide.” “Which he took good care .to do, it seems,” observed Hannah drily, and she exchanged a glance with Helen, whose whole face was alight'with fun. “I el ways wondered why wicked people got off so easy in Lynside, and now I know. You’ll' die comfortably in your bed, Mr Mills; that’s what will happen to you”’ “I hope so,” he responded with fervor, gratified rather than offended by this ironical suggestion. “That’s the nateral place for a man to die in. Bub. there was lots’last night, from what I hear say, didn’t die in their beds, or comfortable either.” ~ . The laugh died away on Helen’s lips then, and she said wistfully, . “Is it certain there have been any wrecks then?” - . He touched his helmet to her respect fully—he had not seen her before—as he answered, “Quite certain, miss, I am sorry to say. The -‘Bellyfuron’ -was wrecked close to the shore ; but the waves were so high 'even the lifeboat couldn’t be launched, and _ some of the | poor creatures perished in sight of .people on the shore. Then there was two cr three ships in distress out at sea, and the ‘Luckshire Lass’ has gone out to look for them now, -but they haven’t much hopes. There’s, never been such a storm since I can remember this coast/ miss; and that’s pretty well nigh thirty year:’’ Helen hurried away'to tell Miss Tudor and Florence the news before Margaret came down, and when the latter appeared the. subject was immediately dropped. But-they had not finished breakfast when Florence, who was naturally excitable, called out, in a horrified voice, “Oh, Miss Tudor, there’s -one of the poor shipwrecked people just coming'up the drive.” And die sprang to her feet and darted out. The ethers followed instinctively,. and reached the porch: just .as Florence led. in a wet, wo'e-tegone,-shivering, figure, who sank down on the old oak kettle with moans and gasps. ' ' r./'- ; “Something hot directly, and. then get off her wet things,” said Miss Tudor, tak ing the command by right of her superior years and experience.-. . “She can have my purple gown.”' . .. \- The poor shipwrecked woman looked at Miss Tudor out of the corner’ obone eye; - furtively, and then she said .through her chattering teeth, i’d—rrather go to—to bed—until iny own clothes' are dry—if you don’t mind. I—l couldn’t think of giving you so muchitrouble.” Florence had mixed her a very strong dose of brandy and water, not knowing what the proportions to be, and brought it,quickly.. .' The woman: draiik it off at-a draught without'.even wincing; and a flush mounted'into'her wan face. -. ~ “Oh, dear! oh,‘-dear! r- .
