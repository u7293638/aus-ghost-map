A GLANCE AT NEW CALEDONIA BY IlB-ntY CorsiAKD, M.P. II (III.) 1 The country is completely overrun with " land and " Hundreds of square fallen may fairly be designated as lantana jungle, which is good for neither man nor beast The road for a mile or two forms a pleasing avenue of flamboyant, interspersed with bamboo and aloes After passing the Commandant's residence and grounds coffee plantations are soon , but being planted on the flat, the ground is wet and undrained, and the trees appear unpruned and neglected, although, I think, this is a Government plantation Then we pass pitches of ground nuts where two men are endeavouring to got one mile to work between the rows The weather appears to flourish, and occasional!,, a fair p itch of room is passed, and at other places the cobs are hanging in bunches round the cottage, as it is supposed to keep better from the, bay is by this method of storing Small Odds of Para grass are soon This grass appears to grow luxuriantly, and is the principal fodder for horses and working cattle A team of bullocks consists usually of one pair with frequently two men to drive them, but should the team consist of two pairs, then you are sure to see two divers At midday we reached the Brothers' Farm This is a reformatory school for boys the children of com lots-established by the Marist Brothers As the road beyond hero was not suitable for wheel traffic we had arranged for horses to meet us at the farm, but they had not arrived , so, as the principal of the school "was courteous enough to write unto look over the establishment, We gladly accepted the imitation, and the friends of the reformatory system will be glad to learn that real good work is being done in this out-of-the-worhl locality There are seven Brothers, of a, horn the Director is Brother Victoria, and another of them id But he Ardron, who, until six months ago, was located for several years at St Joseph's College, Hunter's Hill, and his friends will doubtless be glad to hear that he and his colleagues are doing ) com au service on behalf of those boys the offsprings of convict life in the heart of New Caledonia though I don't mind mentioning the matter as a secret that I fail' Brother Andrew would rather be in the heart of Hunter's Hill They have 105 boys, from 0 to 10 years of age The Government grants aid at the rate of Â£1 per month for each boy, and I at the age of 16, if they wish to stay on, they receive wages They are taught amongst other things, atonanuuoury, harness and boot making, carpentry and cabinetmaking, blacksmith work, and agriculture, as well as the management of the stock They expect to ha, of 1 JO boys by the end of the year After our inspection, we were invited to taste the celebrated " Hair d' Arquebus," made, I understand, at one of the Marist Brothers' establishments at St Gonis-hival, on the Rhone Wo tasted and felt better for it, so the generous old Principal pressed a small bottle of it on me to take v, hill in the bush if I fell exhausted or got wet, and as I thought such an cent was just within the range of probability I suffered the pressing and enclosed the Arquebuse in my handbag It is always wise to have a handbag with you on such occasions Just as the Brothers were kindly getting their own horses to lend us, our own put in an appear once, and we made a start for the mountains but long before we got to the mine it was raining in torrents, and the riding up that slippery bridle track was just delightful I rode a celebrated steed called Old January I forgot how many shillings he had been sold for on one occasion, but, as he had only one eye, it could not have been many However, he was supposed to ' up to my weight," so we trudged along Sometimes. he walked on his tail and at other times on his post, but we got there all the same, and I don't mind admitting that I was not sorry when we did get there We camped in a hut belonging to the Mariana nickel mine, near Mount Boa, just about the centre of the island lins hut, containing seven rooms had been erected by the natives, I was informed, for li Dio enies, roof, and partitions were made of the Niaouli bark like that of our ti-tree, only of a larger size and were tied together with roan It did not look very much, and, its the floor was mother earth and there were some stretchers already erected, I planted my cork mattress and air pillow on one of those, and, with an opossum rug to cover me if I wanted it, I felt that my lines had fallen in pleasant places We were located here for six days, and it rained incessantly for four and a half days and also nichts out of the six The worst of it was 2 of could not dry our set are those, is the atmosphere, seemed all water Here we lived 1 in Australian, but we found it necessary to take up a case of red wine for the two men, as a French miner cannot work without a bottle of wine a day It is only fair, however, to say that this is in lieu of the English minor's toa L, on the boys in the of Reformatory school got an allowance of wine and water The forest here is very picturesque in places We found tree ferns of a totally different species from any seen in Australia, and certainly) more beautiful As for the smaller kinds of ferns, len,, se, eral which I had not seen before The gem of the forest, however, was a tree about the size of our box and ha, Ing n bark and a leaf similar to that tree, the wood being dark, like our mahogany. Numbers of these trees were in full bloom when we arrived on the mountains, and you could distinguish some of them clearly on the opposite mountains about two miles away I hey were one mass of , million coloured bloom, and the ground all round them was as though covered with cinnabar I asked the natives of an adjacent , dingo besides several Frenchmen, but none of them could give me any names for them, and the only one I could think of as suitable "us the cinnabar tree This tree, lion ever, is of a different species altogether from the " flamboyant," which is so plentiful at Noumea and other places on the coast, and which is an acacia I brought six young trees, but two got destroyed I intend to try two of them on Clark Island along with some seedlings of the Flamboyant, which is also a gorgeous tree when in bloom I now come to a very serious part of my probably otherwise nnintorostiugstorv, and which, in fact, is one of the chief causes I had for writing at all While in Noumea my attention as drawn to an abomination - certainly it must have been one of the plagues of Egypt I allude to an insect which I can only describe as a (lying tick I had no opportunity of acquiring of French soiantisU about this nameless horror, and all I could ascertain about it was that it came over from Algeria on li, of stock some five or six years ago Some people were under the impression that it came from Australia, but I very promptly repudiated that connection Already it appears to have spread over the entire island, and can be found in greater or lesser numbers on horses or cattle in any part of the country, though, so far as I could gather, the insects do not patronise cheap They are larger than the house fly, but their bodies and heads are like solid india rubber Squccso them as hard as you may, no impression is made on them, while, at the extremity of each log, they possess either two or three sharp claws or talons They, however, do not seem to burrow into the animal like an ordinary tick, yet they appear to derive their taste once in some manner from them, judging by the way they cluster round the parts where the skin is thin, and they certainly irritate the horse The only one I examined with a glass was alive, and, as I had a pin through it, it naturally fluttered somewhat, and I could not make sure whether it had two or three days at the extremity of each log, and they are so strong that the gentleman who drew my attention to these abominable insects showed how one of them could hold a large cork by its claws while he held the week They do not hover about like ordinary flies, but he, o a businesslike way of flying straight to the object, and in such numbers do they congregate that you can frequently scrape out a handful at a came from between your horse's logs on the more tender parts of his body They do not attack man, though you frequently find them crawling about you if you have been on horseback or near either horses or cattle While at the time I got one of the French women to plane about a score of those flies or ticks in a small phial of spirits with a view of submitting them to our Government scientists, and I was much surprised to notice their apooJio gravity I suppose an ordinary fly, if dropped on the surface of spirit, would remain there at any rate for some time, but those Bank nearly as rapidly as Small pebbles , but by the time they reached bottom they were apparently dead I say apparently with reason, for I experimented with one by endeavour- ing to drown him until he was to all appearances as dead as a fly could be, and I kept him there for some time longer, tw I (wished, to have him with a powerful lens, but a second or two after I played hen on a post for inspection Uo makes a beeline straight for Too lion over as my importation of the post had been three weeks in a well-worked phial of spirits, and the phial kept in tin for matically scaled bottle, I don't think so on their ghosts could nationalise now I now with, with all the earnestness which can be oppressed in print, to draw the attention of the Government gud the stockowners not only of New South Wales, but of the whole of Austrian, to the imminent danger of our Australian border being landed by this pest We in Sydney do a direct trade with New Caledonia , find, if this fly could travel from Altona to Noumea, what is to prevent it (unless rigid precautions are taken) from being imported into New South Wales P I desire to say here that it is the farthest from my wishes to cause an impediment or difficulty in the tv n% of trade between ourselves and our lunch neighbours which is clearly a profitable one for ourselves, inasmuch as during 181 t, while no only imported therefrom Â£21,417 worth, two for the same yoaroxportod thereto Â£80,701 worth of goods I hope, therefore, we may be able to continue developing this trade, and at the same time by serious fire research keep out this drooping, flying horror to horror to the imagination of man, and a roll post to horses and cattle If in some six years it has spread all over New Caledonia, an island containing about 6,000,000 acres, and where there are comparatively few of either cattle or horses compared to the area of land, how much more rapid would it spread so often in the Australian colonies (excluding New Holland) we have about 1,000,000 head of cattle and over a million and a half of horses I have therefore thought it my duty to draw the attention of the Government and the stockowners was pointed a manner as possible, in the hope that some immediate action may South ed to prevent the importation of this fly or any) of its brood It would appear to me that it would be advisable for the Government to send over one of the most capable of our scientific men to Noumea to study the habits of this mixed both as to its effect on horses and cattle, and the probabilities or otherwise either of the fly or its eggs or larvae being imported, say, for instance, in the hides of cattle I notice that during 1914 we imported from New Caledonia the hides of 1100 horned cattle, besides hoofs, bones, and horns There is probably a more direct way of importation I cannot say for certain that the Messageries steamers carry nulWtug cows on board, because I did not penetrate that far forward, but it may be presumed they do, inasmuch as there was an abundant, supply of fresh milk on board, though of course it might have been kept fresh in the ante-chamber, but I do not think so The large boats, however, do not go to the wharf at Noumea, hut anchor about a quarter of a mile off the shore, and which of these files would be inclined to take that much of a sea to wage I cannot say The Tanais, however moors at the wharf, but whether she carries a cow or not I cannot say One thing"' may be depended on, and that is, unless precautions are taken, and very strict ones too, we shall just as assuredly be endowed with this additional pest as New Caledonia has been, and they certainly would not take things pit asanter either for the people in 236 lines or in the country, while our horses and cattle would be in no way improved by their acquaintance Moreover in Men of the fact that our pastoralists are ordeal owing to develop the sea-eagle trade with England, it may safely be assumed that this fly, if over introduced to our stock, would not assist in the development of that trade, and the same may be said with respect to our exporta- tion of horses to India I have no desire to boom this flying tick, or indiarubber By but I think the Government will be highly blameworthy if they do not endeavour by every means at their command to prevent a possible invasion by this horrible little creature, the remembrance of which makes me shudder while I write about it
