In a;moment lie i iefione, the hoofsflf tiis horse sputtering her' rather plnntifnlly with, soft mod..a8 he callops unfit, and with ft face eknreseive bfnnvrtiincfcutJ approbation, Miss Dorn glances back 'frorh \he J figure of the unknown horseman to her stylish I dark blue' skirt, anS the Rreat mud splashes he has left on 'it. ' Very gallant. upon my word I' she solilo quists, rather indignantly. ' But perhaps where lliat man comi-s from, spatterine pcnple all over with dirt michl not be. considered as altogether incompatible wi:h eood brmlini-'. By-tbe-way, I wonder where ho does come from? He 16 a Rtrant-er at all nvent?. Bather :: nice sort of face-lonks as if there might be some thing in that man worth knowing ; not that I believe there is however. ATI the interesting j people were used up in nove's long sincr, that accounts for their scarcity in real life;' and with a second glance at her spattered dress, and a rneful doubt as to whether those largest spots will rub out when dry. Miss Dorn trudges along at a tolerable puce, until tired with the exercise j she pauses to draw breath, and consider the | expediency of returning. i The weather has improved hut little since the raorninfi. The rain still keep? oft. but the chill gray cloom has never lifted nil day; and. although it is hare'.v four o'clock, the drear, ! wet twilight i? a:r»ai1v clo'sirg in, ns the sound of a shout- a loud, hrntal langh, and the pitiful cry of some nrn'nml in distress - arouses the girl's senses into k»en activity. , It is a lonely spot just here -a road hut little frequented with neither house n -r hnbitziinn in sight ; and one glance, as she turns a sl.arp angle in the road, reveals a sight that turns her hot with indignation. Far out in the miil.'.'e of the rivr alongwhich 1 ? «??!»? nrir) inet. vrhprft lllP vatpr IS . deepest, a miserable, half-grown kitten, e link- ing to some floating weeds nn.l sedgps, is struggling for its life, while close to the w-.ter's ^ edge a group of country laris v.*ho Jjave found , capital diversion by tryh'e their aim in stoning ] it to death, arc laughing and shouting in brutal glee. The Eight is simply or,n of torture tp Josi', who has a tender love and pitv for the wli-ih dumb creation ; and Tor one speechless mom°nt she stands looking on in Ji?1dIc=s horror at the degrading spectacle, the pttiful cries of the poor little animal going straight to her heart. It is but a moment, however, for the next,, utterly regardless of all risk of p°rsonal in=tilt, Miss Dorn come= valiantly to the rescue nf -t-h' tortured animal, or tathrr to the rnal of the stupid louts who are tormenting it. ' The poor little animal is licynnJ her reach ; hut upon its persecutor? opens pucii a nre ot wimc-nng reproof and indicnant proUi-t as leaves hor trembling an-1 frijrhtrnel nt hrr own vehe mence, it is true, but unmistakably victor of the field.
