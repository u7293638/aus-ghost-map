So be it." . .A Recapture. - It was on the 4th of July, 1837 when a -West Indian day had just daw tied, or as Quatnino has it, " open his eye, Massa," that on a tranquil sea in the Guif of Mexico, with ari horizon bounded by se.a and sxy, nought was to be observed but two vessels one of which' was her Majesty's packet from Tauipicp, bound to Ha van nail, steering by the wind, the other a clipper-like looking schooner to windward and ahead ol the packet, running about two points free toward ber. Novr, says Jack to bis mate on the forecastle what does this sea-sarpant want? ; At noon she was within hail, when the commander of the packet, whose broad British ensign had long been displayed, hailed the stranger to know why he did not show his colours and was answered that he was in distress and had no colours on board, then rounded to audjbacked his top sail, waiting for the packet's boat to come alougside. Tbe officer, on reachihg the deck, found four men, three white and one' negro ; the whites weie armed to the teeth, each having buckled rouud hiuia brace of pistols and a cutlass. Their tale was brief Sbe was an American' schooner, of New. Orleans, that bad been detained four days before oft' theport of Matamoras, by a French sloop o!'-war, for a breach of blockade; a lieutenant and eight seamen were put nn board, with orders to take her to Vera Cruz, where the French Ad iniral then was; that at midnight of this day the three whites, who were tiie master of the schooner, his mate, and a Mexican passenger, had, as soon As two of the four Frenchmen of the watch had gone belotir, one to the officer in tbe cabin, and the other to the Seamen under the forecastle; to call their relief, rushed to the place where the arms were concealed, seized them, put the hatchets over, secured the man at the helm, thrust hiin below to acquaint his shipmates how much safer it was for them there than it would be on deck, and tnen liberating tbe French Negro Sailor, on c ndition of" assisting to work the vessel tbey found themselves onee more uncontrolled masters of her. The captain stated, that his share in the vessel if as all the property lie had in the world, and to let so good an opportunity slip of regaining it was more than bis calculating view of thiugs over thought of, however, in" the midst of their success they were without water; which, under a hot sun, is intolerable, the packet then supplied them with abÂ»ut 30 gallons; and whilst waiting for the. supply , it was not a little amusing to see tbe Frenchmen summoned oiie by one on the deck, pinoned, and then safely . secured below. The .Water being received on board the vessel, . and the prisoners properly secured, sail was made, and the vessel arrived at New Orleans three days alter; when the French officer put in his claim for the prize, but the authorities thought the master and part owner, who had so gal- luntly 'and blood.essly recaptured 'her, had the best title, and tberelere gave her. up to,, him: The above has been forwarded by a nival officer, us a contrast to- the ; wretched affair which has recently occupied so much attention Devovport Telegraph,
