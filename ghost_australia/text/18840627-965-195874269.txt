poetrp For those who Fait « AIL honor to him who shall win the prize," The world has cried for a thousand yean; Bat to him who tries, and who fails, and dies, X give great honor, and gloiy, ana tears. Give glory, and.honor, and pitiful tears To all who fail in their deeds sublime, Their ghosts are many in the van of years, They were bom with Time ill advance of Time. Oh, great is the herd who wins &name;, Bat greater, many and many a time, Some pale-lacedlello w whodies In Bhame, And lets God fl↰ the thought sablime. And neat is the man with a sword nndrawn, Andgood is the man who refrains from wine; • Bat the man who fails«nd yet still fights on, Lo.he is the twin-bombrother ol mine.
