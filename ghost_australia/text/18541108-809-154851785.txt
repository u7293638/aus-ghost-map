BALLARAT. (From the Correspondent of the Spirit of the Age.) November 4th, 1854. The Red Hill line is fairly reviving again, and on the whole, paying well ; there have been several tubs producing about two pounds weight. The Chinese are now in immense numbers wandering about Ballarat; like the ghosts of departed diggers they are generally engaged washing tailings. A gentleman of the name of Heard, under a bond of £ 1000, has gone to Melbourne to take his trial at the Criminal Sessions, commencing on the 15th instant, on a charge of being con- cerned in the burning of Bentley's Hotel.— This is one of the cases by which the Camp has succeeded in lessening the reliance of the diggers in official promises. All is quiet for the present, but there will be more meetings held. Business is slightly improving, and the num- ber of claims being worked that are paying, is unusually large for Ballarat ; this is owing to the breadthening of the Gravel Pit's line.
