A GHOST WITHOUT A CHEQUE BOOK. It ia a relief to turn from a story of horror like this to a ghost which showed itself possessed of reasonable intelligence if not a sense of humor. Glamis Castle, the residence of Lord and Lady Strath more, is, as everyone knows, notorious as the scene cf the terrible events in ' Macbeth ' â€” and of course Glamis has its ghost. When Dr. Boyd was stay ing there he, like all visitors to the Castle, heard a great deal abonfc the haunted room. It had been put about that tbe mention of it was a painful subject in the family. Never was ranker nonsense. In the morning the first thing the countess said to her guests was, ' Well, have you seen the ghost V1 The earl treated the subject in a fashion yielding practical counsel. He told how some years before an excellent dignitary bad just gone to bod, when of a sudden the ghost appeared. With great presence of mind the clergyman took the first word. Addressing the ghost, he said he was most anxious to raise money for a chinch he was erecting, that he bad a bad cold, and could not well get out of bed, but that his col lecting-book was on tbe dressing-table, and he would be extremely obliged if the visitor would give him a subscription. Upon this the ghost vanished and has never returned.
