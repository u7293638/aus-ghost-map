THE STORY TELLER [FOUNDED ON FACT.] Written for this Journal by " E.A.C." 'Never heard of an Australian ghost story, Stranbenzie? Wait till after dinner, and I will make you alter your opinion that such tales are unknown in Victoria." The speaker laughed as he spoke, but before his companion could reply, the deep tones of gong rang out on the perfumed evening air, announcing the advent of din- ner-welcome tidings to the somewhat weary travellers who had only that after- noon arrived from town at Mount View station, the properlt of the young squatter with whose remarks our tale opens. It was the eve of the New Year, and seemed very sweet to Harry Meredlith, for business had compelled him, for the first time since his marriage, to spend the Master's birthday in the crowded metr- opolis instead of in the pure air of Mount View, and it was with evident pIeasure that he ushered Lionel Straubenzie (an Eglish school-mate recently arrived in Melbourne) into, the pretty dining-room where Mrs Merelith and her two golden-haired darlings awaited them. The conversation during dinner turned mostly upon English topics - both Harry and his plceasant frank-mannrered wife claiming the old countru as their own - and it was not till the latter had gone away with the chillren, that Lionel remembered his host's promise of a story. "Now for your ghost, Harry" he said, somewhat incredulously, "though I must confess I do not expect one of the correct type; your 'marvellous Melbourne' is al- together too new for that style of thing." A gleam amusement shot from Mr. Meredlith's blue eyes; "Come out on the verandah," he said, "and I will show you the very hill (at least, in the dlistance) where, on moonllight nights, the ghost of Wanganilla used to appear to those passing below." It is about ten years ago that the incident, to which I refer, haplpenned and there are many in this distrist who still re- member the facts. At tlhat. time, tlhe stations were far more scattered tlhan they now are and social meetisngs were consequently ap- preciated in a high degree. The principal one was a sort of monthly assembly at the nearest township, and I soon became one of its contant attendants. The dance was always held on moonlight nights, as the roads were not then in very first-rate order and in fact had some dangerous bits here and there. Those from our neighbourhood generally rode over in a party, but, as it happened, I never made one of it, as from one cause or another, I had been away from Mount View most of the timle. " I had not however failed to hear os he 'Ghowtof Wlsgauilla,'thsogh like yousr. self, StmulsBseic, I lasushuhl at th ilde o'f anytlhing oftho't ihtstro tnjcpiplstical Asstest lin.
