THE LATTER DAY SAINTS. The announcement that Mr William Geddes, who styles himself an " elder " from Salt Lake City, the abode of the Mormons, or Latter Day Saints would deliver an address at the Oddfellows' Hall, drew together a considerable number of persons of both sexes yesterday afternoon Mr Geddes, who is a middle aged man, has a good voice, but a some what monotonous delivery. He is fluent in speech, though his address was at times rambling and rather incoherent, hut his intimate acquaintance with Scripture, of which he appears to have been a diligent student, materially assists him whenever he finds himself running away from tho point he is trying to impress upon his hearers. It is not too much to say that nearly every one present was disappointed in the subject of the address. Visions of minute descriptions of Brigham Young and his many wives, reasons in support of polygamy, facts about Salt Like City, and other information of an interesting character floated before the minds of those who went to hear Mr Geddes , but when he announced that he was going to talk about "the great plan of salvation," evident surprise and disappointment was depicted in the faces of many persons and several of them very soon afterwards left the hall. However, those who remained had the satisfaction of hearing a partial exposition of the views of the Mormons, and also a little about Brigham Young. Mr Geddes began by desiring any reporters of the Press present to take their seats at the table on the platform, and also asked any gentlemen who wished, to occupy tho chairs placed there, but, no one re spending to the mvititton, he offered up a prayer which the most orthodox clergyman could not haro t ikon exception to Ho then began by saying that ho had recoivcd the most courteous treatment from tho peoplo of this colony He congritiilated fas mamans on tho groat enterprise they had show n in the development of their country, which, ho said, was a beautiful land, n ith a mee chinato, and v ery much improved by tho gardons m it After thcBO preliminary flattering remarks, ho announced that ho was going to talk about the groat plan of salva tion All his pleaching lie saul, his teaching, and his exhortation, was strictlv in accordance with the Scriptures Beforo ho gave nut lim toxt, how ever, he briefly alluded to the peoplo to whom he belonged, of whoso history, he Bald, those present piobably know very little What thoy did know was pel haps from little sketches in tho newspapers, wiitten bv pel sons who liad visited Salt Lako Citv, and obtained falso impressions of the peoplo Mr Geddes proceeded to say that ho should endeavour to examine tho Gospel os it was established upon the earth by tho Groat Captain of Salvation, and for this purposo ho hoped his hearers would exeiciso their paticnco for tho space of an hour and a half or two hours, just as tho Spirit give lum uttoianco Sovoral persons looked rather gloomy at such a prospect, and walked out, but Mr Geddes, without noticing tho eu.it, gave out his toxt-lbth chapter of Mark, ho ginning at the 15th verse-* Go jo into nil the wot Id ami preach tho Gospel to every creature ' &c; Hie Scripturo distinctly laid down, he argued, that thoio was to bo one faith, one lord, and one baptism , and yet bow was it that, by tho last statistics, it was found that there wore 050 dif feicnt denominations on the earth?
