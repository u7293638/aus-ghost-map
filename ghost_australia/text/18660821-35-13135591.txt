MISCELLANEOUS NEWS. (From the papers to the 26th June.) The Marquis of W Waterford was defendant the other day in an action brought against him by a discharged butler named Morgan, to obtain damages for an alleged slander The Marquis had said of Morgan that he was given to drinking habits, and also to swearing, and evidence was given that he had sworn, at his master on certain specified occasions the butler declared that he had never sworn in his life, and called the housekeeper and another witness or a two to say that they had never heard him use bad language or seen him drunk On the other hand, the Marquis repeated some exceedingly ugly words which, he said, the butler had used to him, and some of the servants corroborated the r master The evidence as to drunkenness was not so clear, and probably the jury believed that the plaintiff was not guilty of that vice, though his tongue was not so much under control as he would have them believe, for they awarded him Â£25 It is a curious sign of the times that ballooning is coming into fashion The Morning Post of June 26th contains an account of an ascent which was made on Saturday from Windsor by two officers of the Blues, Messrs Burnaby and Westcar The account does not differ materially from other accounts with which every body is familiar , there is the usual bewildering talk about currents of air, refraction of the sun's rays, con- densation, eiaDoration, expansion, "c , etc, but the main gist of the letter seems to be that the day was calm, the jaunt prosperous, and the descent, which took place at Bletsoe, easy The only remarkable event which occurred to the daring adventurers was that they descended close to Mr Burnaby s own country house, where Mr "W estear mentions as a noteworthy fact that the gallant proprietor, although ar- ming in a balloon, was received with rare hospitality Formerly the gentlemen of the Household Horse used to content themselves with such domestic luxuries as valets and stud grooms , we gather from Mr West cars letter that that gallant officer keeps a menial of whom he speaks as my aeronaut, Mr Hampton " Such is the progress of science in the nineteenth century Mr Lowe, on leaving the House of Commons on the night of Monday, June 26th was set upon by a mob, and though there was no repetition of the proceedings which have rendered Kidderminster Historically f mous, the right hon gentleman was protected from what would certainly have been a very inconvenient pressure by the services of several policemen The Star, describing the crowd, says, "There cannot have been less than from 200 to 300 of the artisan class, all respectably dressed and well behaved, but for the vehemence of their denunciations of the member for Caine, who thought it worth while to walk behind and beside him through the Park until, havinjainved at the Mall, he got into the waggonette of a friend who happened to be passing The Star adds, " Mr Lowe bore the demonstration very cheerfully, but his bow to the people on riding off in the waggonette was a little spoilt by his gloves dropping on his face as he raised his hat ' Quite a different impression as to the materiel of the mob was made on "W D L in the well known faire pondent of the Times, who says, "My first impression was that Mr Villiers was being escorted home by pauper lunatics who were adopting this mode of congratulating him on his admirable management of metropolitan workhouse infirmaries, but a nearer inspection showed me that this was a grand Reform demonstration, and that the working man, was expressing his disapprobation of the opposition to the Government Reform Bill in general and of the conduct of Mr Lowe in particular Seeing him but slenderly attended, and judging from the appearance of his followers that something more than insult might be intended, joined his small bodyguard, and walked with him to the steps of the Duke of York's column, where he got into a carriage and drove away During the walk I took especial notice of the very few grown, menwhocontributedaver) inadequate bass to the shrill treble of the boy and girl majority of serenaders I know something of the real working man of London, and I can safely assert that not more than two or three of the little mob bore the least resemblance to the class intended to be represented The great majority were of that stamp whose proximity leads a man instinctively to button up his coat and feel for his watch two or three were indisputably drunk, and of these, one, a young fellow, about as ill favoured an example of a son elector as I have yet come across, lurched past me twice, and on each occasion endeavoured to articulate some dangerous doctrines, the syllables of which, however, like the Reform Bill itself, became fused in committee in his mouth, and never either redistributed or reproduced themselves in an intelligible shape The following ghost story finds a prominent place in most of the Parisian journals a Russian lady of rank died lately in Paris, and her husband sent for a barber to arrange her hair, as is usually done with the Russian dead The barber took his young son with him, and, to punish him for some indiscretion which he had committed, brutally compelled him to read aloud " Mon Voisin Ra) mond " whilst the hair of the corpse was being dressed The boy was terribly frightened at the task imposed on him, and returned home almost delirious but the cruel fathers turn was to come, and on the following night, and for many nights afterwards, did the appearance of the Russian lady sit by his bedside reading aloud to him improper novels At last the poor barber s black hair turned white under the well deserved infliction he was undergoing, button after the fair Russian had exhausted her report one of light literature and appeared to him no more, he was fortunate enough to discover a dye, -which completely restored his hair to its original thickness, colour, and gloss which he now sells at the extremely low price of
