OHIAPTIER VII. THn STAlITLED LOVtERS. We must now goback to on early period of the snaie evening. Thle moon was just risnlg like a large fire baloon in'the eastern sky, and shedding her soft but brilliant rays 'o the earth, wlhet the clock in the tower, at Staunton Hall strolk nin, 'At that moment a fine stalwart young mlan bounded over a stile on to the road which separated tlhe Park from the Glen grounds, nud proceeding along the rond for a quarteri of a mile, with thatt free and swinging gait which hotokened a light and a pleasant duty, he paused for a Inomont at the iron gates leading into Tite Glen grounds, bult only for a molllmelt, for -onl quick swoop with hlis bright eye told him imme tdiltoly that the objotit of his senrlc was not there. As Ih was moving away lie hoard a low whistle, but hte reongnisedl it at once, and going down the roant ntil Ie eamlle to a latt, hao darted up it quickly aind kneUling down liistoneC intently. Presently the whistle wasoe repeated, and this titmer, having no further doubt, ihe pult hllis fingers to his mouth and gave vent to a half whistlo, half ecreecih-liko a night bird--and rushing forward soon stood near throee menll. " All Alike, my heutty, youll and your ipls are at your poaching games again, tire you?" The speaker, Fralnk Pickford, Sir FIorbert Staunlltonl's trainer anld mallnager of. the stables, was a very handtsome, litely-forted man, nonearly six foot tall, with an olen,u honest countenance, and he looked a perfect FIorcules as Ihe stood in the muoonlight, regardtling the threeo ten littfore him, with a nlischievous sunile playing about his mouth. Miku, the chief o1 thle poachlere, did not appear at all dliseoncerted at the appearance of ralnk, oni tile conotrary, seemed to have anutieipatdl his coming, for he immnio linteoly said, "lAh Frnstk, iny honey, I know my whistlo wotild fetch ye, if ye wtas a miile oil." " Alit you raecal, Mlike, but of courso I know your signnl. What's the matter ilow? .Altyltessage." "Yes, ye spalpeUn," repliedd Mlike, digging his thumb into Frank's ribs, "t your celleti, the dark-haired Ruth, could not get away as early as siho thought for, and therefore tould tle to bid you tmate her Iy tlhe watherfll." I All rightt , Frank, mty toy, take care you don't got into trouble, and good night." Antd witllout waiting for any responsive greoting Fra?k scampered away, and was soma spooeding as fast as his sturdy legs could carry him to tihe wvalorfll. The waterfall was an artificial oino situated in Staunton Park. Thore was a fall of n dozen feet, and as the water fros, the brook fell over and daslied down onl to the stones beneath it slarkled like dtiaondso in the rays of the moon. Immediately over the fall, about three feat above it, was a footbridge, from which a commaunding view of the sur rounding sctnery could beo obtained, and on tllis bridgo on the night we speak of, was the figulre of a femttale, leaning over the handrail and looking at the falling .watei. She was dark and plainly dressed, it being evident from her attire that she was a servant in a good famsily. lWhile shell was gar.ing almost uncon sciously at the water, her quick atr soon dteteited the sounds of a footstep famliliar to her, and rising from lher leaning pos turo sithe looked towards the road. In a few minutes Frank had jumpted the stile and site was foledt in Iia arms. s " Alt Ruth, my darling, I had almost given yon. up." " ])unoer wna very late to-day, Frank, end I could not canie sooner so, I told Mile tto Uoot you and tell you to colme here, as it is no mllulh nearer the house." " Why Rutli, my girl, you lookod distressed. What is the matter ?" N" othing Frank, at least uothltg that concerns us. I am afraid however that there is trouble at the house.

" I fool it, Frank; there is 'sorrow in store for my master's louseo." " Cheer up .littl?~. Ruth. You will soon leave the house s'nd all its doonms and sorrowvsiid once inh suany Australia 'you will forget all trials and sorrows." Frank and Ruth then went uIp the dell and through' the lane, until they came to tlhe garden. Looking anxiously round, and soeing thiat neither human being nor ghost,was in sight, Ruth was once more folded to Frank's breast, and after a fervent "good-night" site parted froni her lqver to retire to her room and dream of the land of gold where her Frank wcas going to take her to. (To be continlued.)
