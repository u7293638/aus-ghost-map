RECENT PUBLICATIONS I Mr Henry Kendall a Songs from the Mountains comprise a good many fugitive produc- tions which have already appeared in print, and are not always up to the level of the poetry he has previously published Perhaps the best of the compositions the volume contains is the dedication to a mountain, and the following lines may be cited as those which, both in sentiment and expression, are worthiest of the writer at his beat " Hero in this home, Away from men and books and all the seas as, I take thee for my teacher In the voice Of deathless males), I, kneeling, hear God's grand authentic gospel Year by year The great sublime cantata of thy storm Strikes through my spirit fill, it with a life of startling beauty Thou my Bible art With holy leaves of rock, and flower, and tree'', And moss, and shining Tunnel From each page That helps to make thy awful volume, I have learned a noble lesson In the psalm Of thy grave winds, and in the liturgy of sharing waters, In 1 my Bout has board ThrirnJ;?r.worship, and from theo Indeed, The,," foundations of a finer hopes WoreuL-iorcd In and thou hast lifted up The band horizon for a largcrfalth ' Bat for a certain imperfections of metaphor in the last three lines, the foregoing passage would challenge unqualified praise, as a verbal interpretation of the influence upon an impressionable mind of one of the most august objects in nature The poem entitled " Beyond Kerguelen" contains some striking word pictures, and illustrates the power of the imagination to bring vividly before you a scene that the writer has never witnessed, but of which you feel that he has presented you with a more accurate description than could be furnished by nine men out of 10 who had actually visited that " ghost of a land by the ghost of a sea, of which Mr. Kendall writes " Vi card Is the most from the summit to base of It Run of Its heaven Is wizened and grey.

Dr. William Sharpe, who is described on the title page of his brochure as having been a surgeon in the British army, has detached from a larger work, and published in a separate form, a chapter on The Cause of Colour Among Races His theory is that although an original white race may have existed, from which the dark races might afterwards have arisen as the necessary result of climatic changes, coupled with an uncivilised primitive condition, yet that the present transition appears to be" from dark to fair, and he argues that the degree or intensity of colour bears an intimate relation to the conditions of existence under which a people LIVes, a coloured skin being necessary to resist the burn- ing effect of the direct rays of a tropical sun, and this resistance being due to the pigment, which is altogether wanting in the skins of white people As to the popular belief that a cold climate is conducive to fairness of complexion, Dr Sharpe re- minds us that in Terra del I uego there is no approach to anything of the kind, while he remarks, with respect to the converse proposition, namely, that a hot climate occasions a dark skin that there is a colony of Jews settled on the west coast of India for some 1,800 years, and they are still a fair people, while the Anglo- American, instead of approximating to the florid colour of the Red Indian, is noticeable for his pallor The question then arises, If mankind sprang from a single pair, how are we to account for the extraordinary diversities of colour which the skins of their offspring present, ranging from a creamy white to a jet black, with intermediate tints of yellow, five, red, and brown ' This is a difficulty which Dr Sharpe evades, and he contents himself with point- ing out the causes which conduce to the evolution of physical beauty, about which there canbetery little dispute The Pte J T Walters, rector of Norton, has written a series of lay sermons under the title of Thrift Lessons, which are calculated to do a great deal of good in a quiet and unobtrusive way They are plain and practical They are quite free from that good. goodness which prompts most people to throw down a religious book with a feeling of irritation and they deal with questions, of vital importance to every household. They expound in simple language the laws of health, and enforce the necessity of sound descent, pure air, pure water, wholesome and nutritious food, abstinence from intoxicating drinks, suitable clothing, rigid cleanliness, sufficient exercise, and proper dwell ing house They offer some useful advice as to the management of a cottage garden, the performance of household duties, the rearing of children in infancy, their education, and religious instruction, and then the reverend writer passes on to speak of cookery, sick nursing, simple remedies for ordinary ailments, domestic economy, and the obliga- tions of citizenship, and concludes with some chapters on Sunday thrift, the difficulties of faith, and the profitable life The book is very neatly got up, and deserves to have a wide circulation among those classes whose unthrTft is very often the result of ignorance, and whose transgression of natural laws aspect unfrequently attributable to the fact that they know nothing of their nature or existence There are fashions in literature as in everything else, and just now serial biographies are quite Ã  la mode The great philosophers, the great artists, the great musicians, the great writers, and other celebrities form the subject of compact memoirs, which appear periodically, in uniform size and binding, and now we have Men Worth Remembering on account of their piety One of these is Stephen Grellet, or more properly Etienne de Grellet, a man of noble family, who owned the famous porcelain works at Limoges, was for many years Comptroller of the Mint, and forsook the Roman Cathohcrehgion to embrace the tenets of the Society of Friends, dedicating himself thenceforth to works of mercy, and becoming a zealous advocate for the aboli- tion of slavery Visiting England in 1911 he was the means of inciting Mrs Fry to undertake her benevolent efforts on behalf of the female prisoners in Newgate, and he seems to have been engaged in missionary work in all parts of Europe up to the time of his death, which occurred in 183. A second biography is that of the well known Philip Doddridge, by Dr /'tanford It contains all the material facts connected with the life of one of the most distinguished Nonconformists of his day, whose Rise and Progress of Religion in the Soul was one of the most popular books of the last century , while his academy at Market Harborough, which he afterwards removed to Northampton, was the Alma Mater of the most influential of the old or orthodox school of dissenting mines- held in England in the generation succeeding his own 2, Songs from the Mountains By Henry Kendall Sidney W Maddock The Cause of Colour among Races By W Sharpe, IMD New York G.
