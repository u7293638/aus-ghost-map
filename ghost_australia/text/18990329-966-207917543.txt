JUST AT MfilSE. By FITZGERALD MOLLOY, Author of "The Devils Head,'' "A-Justified Sinner,"Sweet is BeVenge,' 'An Excellent Knave,"' &c-; CHAPTER XX.—EN PARIS. On reaching Paris Arthur Wei mail drwie with his wiie to r.n old-faMiioned, quiet hotel, which had once been the residence ofc a noble family, and notwithstanding lts pws sent use, still retained some appearance of its former dignity, though on a reduced "aad dinsr sC5.'o. Here he hir>d t> euite of aparfemenfe, consisting of three spacious square-shaped rooms opening into one another, their lofty ceilings, painted, their floors waxed, their furniture consisting of high, narrow mirrors, gilded marble-.topperi pier rabies, chairs and couches likewise gilt and iipholstered in blue brocade, whose faded S'^J" matched the window curtains and toe colour of the Wallpaper, with its sprawling pattern of impossible flowers. The rooms, which were on the second Boor, fa:_>ed the opposite angle of the great house and looked upon the courtyard around which IT was built; PO thait the sun seldom Shone irvto the apsrtments, whose sombre air -vap but little relieved by their tarnished gilding and'dim mirrors; by the candles ani lamps that failed to light, ard the wool f.rcs thai scarcely Tva.rii.ed them. Add felt chilled when slit- first entered the;n. and impressed by a sense of their solemn spleaidour. To her tahey looked lik* rooms that had wituessod a t-agedy; a;ad she felt certain she had but to gaze long enough into one of -file great spotted mirlors to see the reflection of some poor ghost standing behind -and peering over her uiuu'.UC . In the morning, however, her n^ivousnets had ' almost disappeared, so that she was prepared to overcome her depression and welcome .this change, if only for her "husband's- sake. Whilst drinking their coffee she sug[&&fed; that be should call upon Lawrence Held and some other friends whilst *=he unpacked her boxep aiid inade ready for the afternoon's sightseeing.

"Have yoUibeaitLabout your old friend the Princess - Vera he suddenly asked Welman. • . . - 1 . "This is our first day in Paris; we have heard nothing." - " v;".^..- ^ "She bias maie anothet-'sfeassiion" "the'" Russian and American colonies here, talk of nothing but her disappearance. - You - know what gofesips they all are." "Buf why Las she disappeared ? Where is she .gone?" ' - * "I catt't tell you whv, but she has «uddenly gone J» St. Petersburg." • \ "There's nothing particularly strange in' her going bac-k to her own country, I sup- • pose''" WelmfeB suggested.. "Ah, that's the -question. She went out as ®sual one .morning, but 'te didn't return during lie day her aunt and uncle were getting alarmed, r when the post brought them a. letter from ber,-saving she was then on her way to Russia. Siie knew they would not allow bet- to go, fco she- Quietly .took the matted into her own hands tod went." "Alone?" . 7". *'AU kinds of rumours Sew about. -Some said sihe went to join Aben Hiidos, who, is ' now in St: Petereourg. 1 think i told you how impressed he was by her, and tuey •nere seen walking together more. than: otice in-the Gardens-©i the Luxembourg." Adel listened in silent and breathless at-. Itenticn, her heart strangely moved by what She (heard. One day he had protested his love for her, and the next he had been fas cin&ved; by another woman, who, like herself, had probably fallen under the spell bt. hii> evil iuiluence. "He tiirows such an irresistible glamour' over women that one is prepared to "believe : they would risk anything for his sake,"' Lawrence Field said. "But not such at woman as the Princess Vera, Welman remarked. thought the same, and we were'right" "You were right V" Add said, leaning to- ' wards him, her face pale from suppressed excitement. . . . . . " Ves. in hei^note she told her uncle that she took advantage o£ Felix 'Alvas return home to travel with him to Russia." "She eioped with him?" Adel suggested. / "1 don't think BO. -A girl -who is willing to kill herself in the hope of joining her lover is not likely to run away with his friend; especially as there is no reason why she should not marry him if she chooses. . I believe—1 fear—she "is connected with some political plot, that she has gone to carry out. I am sure She has never forgiven the man who caused the death of Boris Riga." Welman thought of her unfathomable eyes, the iirrn purpose shown by the outline , of her cheek and chin, and the ..serene gravi .ty^oi her lice. . • — - . . "One would not be surprised at any heroic sacrifice die aught make," he said. "Her uncle is terribly upset," X&w;'ence Field told them. "He has "an atlaifJi' '<>f influenza at present, and is unable to follow her; so tiliat he has been obliged to Satisfy himself, by .telegraphing to his brothei; in St. Petersburg to meet and take charge of her when she arrives there.". "I hope she may not get into trouble," Arthur said. "At all events," the journalist remarked, 'lucky as Aben Hiidos is, he has not won her." ;;ls he lucky?" Welman asked. "I think him a remarkably lucky, chap." "1 didn't know. I am barely acquainted with him; but my wife knew him before we were married. "Yes," Adel assented, her head throbbing, her hands clutching the arms of her chair. ( "He was a friend of my stepfather's." "But how is he so lucky?" Welman enquired. "Why," replied Lawrence Field, "no one knows where he sprang from. There has always been some mystery about his beginnings. Some say he was the apprentice of a^phrenologist and astrologer wno lived in Vienna; but others say he w-is an acrobat in a circus that travelled through Europe. and that some wealthy man, hearing him sing, had his voice properlytrained." • "I didn't know that." • • "111en he has been a brilliant success from the first, and has already made a fortune. He has the reputation of-having fascinated ^women whom other- men have found like ice; and if a particular example of his good fortune is needed, one has only to refer to the recent railway accident, from which he escaped without a scratch,, whilst out of the three others in the carriage with him one got concussion of the brain, and another, a child, was killed. But what became of the third nobody knows, for he wouldn't speak of the affair, and refused to be interviewed about it."' Adel wearily passed a handkerchief over her blanched face, and closcd her tired eyes that they might not see her husband's shan>e and confusion: Even* word regarding the railway accident felt "like a blow on her heart, until she feared that she im;^ faint. Whilst consciousness was left hei-, she made an effort to rise aud leave the room. Field, who opened the door for her, r. r ticcd her pallor. "I fear your wife is i.;"' said to Welman. "^6, she is only tired; she hasn't qu'l ecovered from the crossing yesterduv liich was rather rough." *' "Now she has gone," spid the Journalist onfidentially, as he settled himcp4f dowu o gossip, 'T may tell you there's no'end of candal soine the round* abop* the who was with Aben Hildos in the railway crash. "A woman, I suppose ?" . X^ertamlyr Do -yon know Oacfcton, the «^esp<>g3ent of the "Boston Mer- .tWyr^ No? Well, he saw her getting ^totne carnage with Aben Hildos at \- <SS na Station that evening." "Did . he man. recognise ha:?" asked Wei "No.~He oi3y saw her back. Bat what became of-her is what -we all -want to fend out. Madame Lemont, who was once in love with Aben Hildos, but who now hates him, says the woman was killed, and that he left her-behind; others sav she turned back. J am ready to swear that she wasn t wjth'hnn in Paris." "If_I had_ known -he had such a reputation I would never have spoken to him; as it is. I will cut him if ever we meet again/' the artist said. "You will? Ah, you are a married man.---" "Yes; and every husband is bound to'be careful about the men he allows to meet his wife, especially when, like mine, she is as innocent as a child." n - o d 0 ?** are right; but as for other, men—— • & be thinks best/ What is that? Lawrence Field asked suddenly, as a dull thud sounded in th next room. Without answering" h&i;, Wdman sprang to the door, which he flung open, to see his wife lying white and motionless on th floor. • • . - {-To be continued to-morrow.)
