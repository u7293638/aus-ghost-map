WESLEYAN METHODIST CON- FERENCE. OPENED BY THE BEV. DB. BURGESS. BEV. G. E. BOWE ELECTED PRESIDENT. The^-first conference for Western Aus- tralia oil the Wesleyan Methodist Church was on Tuesday opened in Wesley Church,* Perth, by the Kev. H. T. Burgess, L.L.D., the President of the General Conference of the Methodist Church of Australasia. There iras a crowded congregation. After the singing of the customary hymn, " And are We Yet Alive," prayer was offered by the Kev. J. A. Jeffreys. The Kev. Dr. Burgess then delivered the following address ; My Dear Brethren, Seventy years ago this year a light was kindled in Western Australia that was never extinguished and still shines with ever-increasing brightness/ A rill began to -flow that has never dried up, ' and the volume of which has expanded until now it is a mighty and far-reach- ing river. Some unknown voice first raised a song of praise in a Methodist, class meeting. The name of the singer and the song are alike unknown, but though they have vanished from human history, the strain of melody has never entirely died away. A few faithful members of the Methodist Church, far from home and from the associations to .which, they were accustomed, gathered together for fellowship and prayer and praise. Without waiting for -ecdesias-,' tîcâl authority, the sanction Of presi- dent or chairman, or anything jof the kind, they organised a class meeting, and there they renewed their spiritual strength, took sweet counsel together, and bore their testimony to the power "of grace to Tceep them free . from- the abounding iniquity of -the land which they had made their home. All honour to the pioneers of Methodism in this colony, who sowed the earliest seed of which,we are reaping the haryestj^with praise and thanksgiving to God. SMALL BEGINNINGS. . For many years the rivulet was con- fined to a narrow channel, for the pro- gress of the colony and of all its in- terests was comparatively slow. The early Methodists, recognising their need of spiritual oversight and help, sought the services of a minister, and repeatedly appealed both to the authorities at home and in other parts of Australasia that ene might be_ sent. Por seven years their applications appear to have been made in vain, and when their re- quest was granted, so far as the con- ference at home was concerned, it was strangely frustrated and delayed. At length, xn 1837, the British Conference appdinted a minister to "Swan River, and the name of the Rev. William Long- bottom-stands on the "minutes." He . had laboured for some years Sn India,, where Ins health had broken down, .-and : had gone , to -Cape .Colony for rest and : '. recovery., Before the knowledge óf his ' appointment reached him, he. had re : turned to India, and thence he set out to fulfil the mission to which he had been, called. From Southern India .to Perth .is not a long distance as the crow flies, but, unfortunately, no such direct and rapid means of conveyance was available, and the only route by which the missionary could reach hrs charge was. of an extraordinary round- about and zig-zag character. The itinerary of his voyage serves to BIIOW in a strik- ing manner the changes that have taken place in little more than half a century. He (Mr. Longbottom) first of all sailed from India to Mauritius, where he ar- rived in due course, and, after waiting there a considerable time, in the vain hope of finding a way to reach some port of the mainland of Australia, he ob- tained a passage to Hobart.- Several' weeks elapsed subsequently to his land- ing in Tasmania before he was able to continue his journey, until it seemed almost impossible for him. to get to the appointed sphere of his labours. Weary of waiting, he eventually set sail in the .brig "Fanny," with his wife and child. The voyage was rough the weathér tem ? pestuous, the vessel scarcely sea-worthy, and ultimately it was cast ashore near -Encounter Bay, in South Australia. The Methodists of Adelaide welcomed the* shipwrecked minister when he ar- rived among them eight weeks after- ? wards, as" though he had-been sent to" them by the direct agency of Provi- dence, in answer to their prayers, and scarcely looked at the matter from thc West Australian ' standpoint. Mr. Longbottom became tho pioneer minis- ter of Adelaide, laboured with great suc- cess, and finally died and was buried there. His name is still as ointment poured forth in that country, and will. ever be held in grateful remembranee. THE FIEST MINISTER. The work awaiting Mr. Longbottom in Adelaide was so urgent and pressing that'ell thought of leaving it was aban- * doned, and consequently twp moire years elapsed before the infant church of Western Australia received a minister. Finallv. in T/G39, the Rev. Join Smithies was appointed the missionary, to the gratification of all concerned. Mr. Smithies had previously spent some years in Newfoundland,- so that in his case the transfer was nearly over half "the circumference of the globe, but in due course he entered upon his labours. For sixteen yeai-3 Mr. Smithies con- tinued to labour in Perth, and other parts of the colony, until the year 1855, when the Australasian Conference was formed, and in the same year he was appointed elsewhere. THE FIEST QUARTER-CENTURY. A quarter of a century had elapsed from the time when the first class meet- ing was held to the constitution of Western Australia as one of the districts of the Australasian Wesleyan Methodist Church. During that time there- had been not only the faithful prosecution of Christian work among the white population, but diligent efforts had been made among the aborigines. Services were held at Fremantle and Albany, and a native institution was formed at York. Among other , names that ap- peared «n the "minutes" in this period are those of the Rev. Thos. Raston, who was afterwards for many years a re- spected minister in . South Australia ; the Rev. William Lowe, to whom re- ference will have to be made again ; and the Rev. Samuel Hardey^ r So far as statistical reports form any ' indication whatever, the progress was anything but rapid, and the period was in that respect in strong contrast with later years. In 1855 there were two churches, -four other preaching places, 67 fully accredited church members, 160 scholars in the Sunday schools, and 450 attendants on public worship. The churches erected in Perth and Fremantle had an aggregate debt of £280. A church- waa in process of . . erection at .York, and another at Yanyedan. Such were the humble belongings of Metho- dism in Western Australia during its first .quarter of a century. Ko one heed wonder that progress was slow. Western Australia .was at that time a mission under the control andinanage ment of the London Board of Missions, but in an indefinite way connected with the australasian authorities, and-their work. Accordingly, there was divided responsibility, and this may partly ac- count for the lack of energy and enter- prise which, contrasts, so strongly with that of later times. AZTEBED RELATIONS. ; A sew condition of thing6 began with the year 1873, when, as the result of somewhat protracted negotiations, the Australasian 'Church came under a new constitution. What had previously been subject to the management of the same- Conference meeting in one or other of the principal cities was divided into four separate and self-administer- ing conferences, with a General Con- ference meeting at intervals of three or four years. Western Australia was at- tached to South Australia, but not in the same sense or in the same way that Queensland was connected with New South Wales, or Tasmania with Vic- toria, for it was felt by the Austealasian ; churches fha* Western Australia was a church in many senses .necessarily apart, divided by time and distance from any other large centre of religious activity. TKe affairs of the Church could not be effectively administered outside its own borders, and, accordingly, though its records were incorporated in the minutes of the öouth Australian conferences, the statistics were all along kept separate. It was recognised that except in name Western Australia was self-governing, that its district meeting was practically its Conference, and that only for tech- nical and legal-purposes did its appoint- ments come before the body which as sembLed in Adelaide. THE SECOND QÜABTEB-CENTUBT. : Growth'ib. the second quarter century of its history was .still extremely gradual, -but" preparation had been made - for future expansion in the circuits that had been formed. There were nine churches in the four preaching places, the membership had risen to 146, there were 696 .scholars, with 76 teachers within the ten Sabbath schools, and the number of attendants on public worship was given at 1,820. At the commence- ment of this period Mr. Smithies was i-emoved to New Norfolk, in Tasmania, I in which colony he laboured until his death, which occurred in the year 1871, and it is recorded of him that while in Western Australia he not only faithfully preached the Gospel to the English settlers, 'but was instant in season and out of season Jn his efforts' to Chris- tianise- the aborigines. The Rev. Samuel Hardey left for South Africa in 1862, and the Rev. William Lowe, who had been removed to Tasmania in 1859, .returned to Western Australia in 1866. Among the ministers who laboured for long or shorter "periods, the names of Messrs. Clay, Bond, Traylen and Laurence deserve honourable mention, some of them, were abundant in zeal, and indefatigable as labourers, under circumstances of much discouragement. A PKBBWESTXMM VISIT. - The remaining years of the past his- tory of "the Church hero naturally divide themselves- into -two decades. Near the beginning of the first tangible evidence was afforded by the South Aus- tralian Conference that it had gradually learnt to feel a larger amount of re- sponsibility and to take a deeper in- terest in the Church of this land. In response to an earnest request, the President of the Conference, the Rev. J. B- Stephenson, paid a lengthened visit and travelled extensively, visiting every circuit, and from his visit may be dated a new era in the management of the Church, Western Australia had ever afterwards friends at court, and *? the South Australian Conference a more intelligent appreciation of , it« ne^da, ' Accordingly, when the Ber. ' Wiilùuà Lowe relinquished the chairmanship" in," 1884, the Conference felt under oMfga«*' '?. Hon to send one of its ablest, ministère as his successor. The choice fell nipos the Her. Robert W. Campbali, and in making that appointment it was ielt that the Conference was giving of its best. REV. WILLIAM LOWE. - Concerning the character and labours ". of the Rev. William Lowe it is almost superfluous for me to speak. And yet, as Í knew him earlier than anyone here, I must be permitted to offer a tribute ta his memory. More than fifty year«, have elapseu since I was present at a . revival meeting he conducted-the first,, 0 I ever was in-and I remember its in fluen.ee yet. With earnest zeal he-had' I a vigorous and cultured mind, and in preaching was a workman that needed ¡not to be ashamed. He was greatly blessed in the conversion of sinners to God, was well able to strengthen the £ faith of believers, and young people in ??% particular found him a sympathetic friend. For seventeen years he was chairman of this district, and rendered 'J to it a longer service than anv other Bingle man. -"Of "him it may be said with exceptional ' propriety that "He* being dead jet speaketh." \- . RHV." R. W. -CAMPBELL.;;. % The three years during which Mr, , Campbell laboured in Perth were mark-- ^ ed by diligent discharge of duties on his v~ ;J*j part, followed by a large measure of sue- ( Z> cess. He was a man of great originality, * _ deep conscientiousness, and his charac- ; ter was distinguished by manly courage and earnest devotion to duty." His sud- den death on the last Sabbath of 1886 ji raniA nc a no-infill cm*rtincA on/î on ? ?. -t almost overwhelming shock. The day had been crowded with solemn and mani-': - UJ fold ministerial services, at the close of ^ which he simply lay down to die. The , î occurrence* profoundly impressed the entire community, and in South Austra lia it was felt that the vacancy thus crest ed would not - be easy to fill. The Bev. St ' C. Thomas, who succeeded Mr. Campbell 7' as chairman, by his genial, sympathetic ^J* character and patient labour, won for; himself high esteem. Failure of health ~ ' necessitated his removal from the colony t at the end of three years, which was -a ' subject for general regret. The Bev. J. Y. Simoson, by whom he was followed, was a man of different type, but of mark-' ed ability: It is only necessary to men- . ¿| iion these names in order to see that in* making -successive appointments, 4h©¿ South Australian Conference recognilBed' the claims of Western Australia, --enA"to£ «2?* supply the growing needs of an expand-' 12$ ing church. Time would fail to mentions _*SL the names and to describe the^charecteí- f^M istics of all the ministers who »jirere -agf K¡..¿ág ppinted to supply theincreasingdemana, . * Í but it is not too much to say that ht\ many instances loyal devotion to duty ^ and disregard of personal interest and *" ~ comfort were displayed ¿ry the men who - - C volunteered to serve the Church. * -~* í Air EXTENSION MOVE MTS NT. Towards the close of this decade, the first extension of Methodism on the goldfields, took place, while the Bev. P. C. Thomas was chairman of the district,, and it is scarcely improper to say that the Jiistory. of modern Western Austra-, lian Methodism dates from 1890, when. - different conditions began with the pro- clamation of a new constitution for the - colony. It was at that time that poll- ~ tical and providential indications com- ß bined to suggest a forward movement ^ which commenced not long afterwards. - - ; ; and has. never ceased. Even then, con-, ' - j, sidering that Methodism had been in ex- . ?'. istence for sftty years, the church, waa. numerically small. It would be'impro- . % per to overlook the fact that in a conn- ^ j try like this, what ia known as. the wejtr/. and tear, the losses hy emigration and* /-"Vg! in other ways are considerable ; notwith-^ ^ J|§ stehding'this, however, it can hardly be deemed satisfactory thai the mcrease m ten years was only 96, that áúgx.tísjfáf£^ additional .churches had been erected^i; U and that the mcrease of - adherents Mfkt't^ less than 1,400. " *' Y " v'^v EBV. G. E. BOWE. ' V The later impulse practically origi* neted some seven years ago, say, in 1893»' The hour had come, and the man. . Wes« ; tern Australia was on the eve of an ex* pansion and an upward movement, whicl* none could safely have predicted. A.' r; mighty tide of population was about Uf : set in on its shores. Scores of tiiott^.:.' ^ sands of keen-witted hard-handed sont . : of toil were about to spread themselves ?\ over its sandy wastes. To cope with thé . ":." new order of things, to give Methodisnt its right place, to enable it to enter the" v ^ doors which were shortly to open, anS ^ to enter them with becoming zeal and H diversified effort, a man of special char«- : acter was required, and God gave, hint*' to the Church in the person of Georg® ; -^'^ Edward Rowe. Mr.'Rowe's appointment- ; was the outcome of a singular chain of sf circumstances. He had visited England as a filial duty. On his return, catling ai Western Australia, he obtained in- formation concerning its character, pros- - pccts and interests; and though, per*" haps, he scarcely know it, he exficrtenOk -r, ed the stirrings of a Providential t*âV '1 As my colleague, I had opr^rt^nitawi5 possessed by no other «rf observilig tko* 1 inner working of his mind, and ot est!*- " " mating his special ooalifioations for tW work fliat- was requttfedL Of ^e^trefcgy* ¿ that ho has maintained, the stífcérgsfse that he has shown, and of the diveraMed efforts ho has put forth, I need «61 speak in detail. Under his management and direction Methodism in Western Í "Australia has fulfilled its mission to otra for tho souls and bodies of tuen. His " organisation of the Sisters of the People, and many other philanthropical works, . ? testify "to his sense of tho Ghurch's duty \ and responsibility. With sagacious boldness lie has extended the operations J of Methodism far and wide, until »pw .:;v;S| its agencies are to be found in actiW ^ operation in every centre oî u!atK», ....J ^l^i^íTBJictifieaTiudacifcywhich the Church ^^tf^ls^ed; thè líó^p^^iiaUdiiiff^ which Per^' -MethdajstB are *}úBtly £roud, issonly- one -example. .Pjcebably e would be the last man to claim an un \- due share of whatever praise or credit has-to be distributed, and yet the epi ?tar»h which commemorates the greatest r work of Sir Christopher Wren might be ! . applied to Mr. Rowe : Si monumen tum^quaeris, circumspice." - .Not in the metropolis alone, but throughout the settled portions of the -r ~ colony, the number of agents and agen- cies employed by Methodism has greatly v\ multiplied within the last decade, and %>"'to .those who have laboured . with the Chairman of the District-loyal minis pV-terfl and faithful laymen in various de -if jiartments of the Church-high commen- dation is due.

The subject is of far more importance in the adjoining colony than in this, because the Primi- tive iviethodists and the Bible Christian. Churches are relatively 6o much stron- ger, It would have been an undesirable thing for the division of the South Aus- tralian ConfeVence to have either pre- ceded or followed the union of the chur- ches by any considerable period. In Wes- tern Australia the practical effect of the union is principally that it brings this Conference into line on its basis, and administration with tho other confer- ences of the Australasian Church, which' either have accepted that basis or will shortly do sor METHODIST UNION. !Until two or three-years ago there was only one body of Methodists in this co- lony, hut wh.en the exodus'took place from South Australia, through the open- ing of the goldfields here, many memben of the Primitive Methodist and Bibi« -Christian. Circuits came over, and they are-not greatly to-he blamed that they sought the ministrations to which they .had*been, accustomed* I for one have inever-^een 'disoosed to harshly criticism the actions of-those churches in seekhm ito discharge their responsibilities -'-fx 'their own people; and it must no.t be forgotten ^at4 at'the time, the period when union would b*e effected was uncer- tain. Much crédit is to be given to those who had charge, of the union ne- gotiations for- the brotherly and Chris- tian spirit which made them successful, and so prevented the splitting bf Metho- dist interests here ih a manner that would-haye caused regret/ -The nett re- eölt is that throughout South and Wes- tern Australia, comprising two-thirds of the continent, there is now only one Me- thodist Church. Queensland effected -union two years ago..' In Victoria it will "be consumated less than ~iwo years hence, and we maj hope that New South Wales will not be long behind. Whfen the Methodist Church of Australasia in- cludes Tasmania,' New Zealand and the Isles»! the Southern Seas, it will have become a fact as well as a name. -' ^ WHAT OF TEE FOTUSB? . .

Methodism is differenti- ated front other Churches by «the itiner jttncy of its ministry, as the result of : which every munéter belongs not to an individual Church or circuit, but the of more than a century and a half has "proved that the Methodist system is one that has justified itself. It is un- deniably costly, involves a great amount, of personal sacrifice, dislocates arrange-* ments, and ruptures friendly relations, and must have broken down long ago un- der-these disabilities but for its singular j effectiveness. It renews the vitality and revives the interest of preacher and peo- '?, pie alike, and fosters a common interest I in the general welfare. Thus the con- \ nexional bond which is so important is rendered visible, durable andv real. In- stead of Churches and circuits becoming isolated am} selfish, they are members of an organic whole, each sympathising with all the rest, and not only caring for ' but sharing in the common burdens: the weak are assisted by the strong, and the operation is to their mutual advan- j tages. No organisation, however, and j no system could be effective of itself, for evangelistic fervour is a necessary of life. The machinery- of Methodism, as of any other Church however skilfully planned and carefully adjusjbed, would break down in operation but for the spirit of (Sod in'the midst of the wheels. ; Methodism was born, in a; revival, and -, 'as a revival it continues to live¿4f- it ls \ true to its character; Its mission is to i i 'spread scriptural "holiness . throughout the land, and' its agents have, as~"their ? f -^arampuát ?-ftufojfyç'âtiriii' souls, f ' The i -maxims in which thèse duties . are insist-, ed upon canl hardly ;be' unproved, even if they.belong to the hoary past.
