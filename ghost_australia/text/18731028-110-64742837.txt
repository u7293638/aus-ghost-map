However; Young came off in a canoe to- the steamer. He is the grandsau of the boatswain of the *"Bounty, and is now invested with magis teriat powers by the islanders themsslves, and hiar dctisioa is always tinal. He seemed an inteliigent, quiet man.

O ye friends afar, where the western sea Beats op round a lonely isle : Where the fruit drops ripe, and the fbwers grow red, In the light of her Maker's smile: Our hearts yearn out to your sunny home, And we send you love for love: There's one human heart all over the world, - As there's one blue sky above 1: We live in the shade of a glorious Past. With the ghosts of the great around, "They haunt our ways, and our household hearths. Are built on historic ground. You live in the light of the dawning day, With you future wide and free, You wait God's Lime for your noontide glow, And your heroes yet to be l: Our forefathers' greatnes' nu'rshadows nu,. Till often we feel afraid That we only copy the deeds they did,. And echo the words they said : But if by such echoes their tones can reach You, out on the western main, Then we thank our God fLr the work He gives, And know it was not in vain. 0, brothers ! fame is but a mocking thing And what has the world to pay For the light -of genius that cheers c mankind, While it burns itself away T 1 But the thought of a welcome kept for us In liomes ofa?new-born land, - Brightens our toil, like an E:len fiower Dropped from, an- ,ug-l's hand.
