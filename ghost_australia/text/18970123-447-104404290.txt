A GHOST LIBELLED. An anonymous scribe in Tuesday's , 'Telegraph' appeals to Cardinal Mown to screen himself, as far as his religious duties will at all permit, securely within doors, for his public appearance would only 'engender (alas! alas!) bitter, ran corous, sectarian hatred among the masses, who have hitherto dwelt in. peace and goodwill one towards an other.' Shades of the Kiama Ghost, listen to that ! Why did not your ghostly form glide into the room and. brain the shallow scribbler of such a calumny on the great part you played in the history., of. .the colony of New South Wales? Didn't you cause Catho lics for years to be ejected from the pub lic service, and from the offices of banks and mercantile firms, scarcely permit ting' them even to fill the menial posi tion of 'hewing wood and di'awing water,' branding them as a Pagan bro ther of flesh and blood once branded the early Christians as a danger to the State, a menace to liberty, the 'enemies of the human race?' Now the atrocity of having it basely proclaimed that you allowed the masses hitherto to dwell: 'in peace and goodwill one towards an other.' For complete ludicrous stupid ity and Ignorance the grounds on which opposition has been based to the Car dinal's candidature have, to use a worn phrase, 'seldom been equalled and never surpassed.' Turkey cocks be come Infuriated and maddened at (he sight of a piece of red cloth, and a trivial thing will also cause bulls to howl and bellow ferociously. We would pity the Turkey cocks and the bulls in their uncontrollable temper did we not know that they have not reasoning1 or reflecting faculties. How deadening an influence Australian Protestantism can. have on human beings, when some Pro testants, and a leading Protestant newspaper in Sydney are actually not ashamed to admit that the Cardinal's scarlet cloak on a platform would ...ive the same effect on the Protestants ns a red cloth would on Turkey cocks!
