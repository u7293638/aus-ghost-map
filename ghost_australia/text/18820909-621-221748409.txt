[?] BY ELBOTBIO Tklkgbath. (Fboic oub Special Bopoby») £ SYDNEY, SATUBDAT. The A.J.C. Spring Meeting commenced to -day und er the moet auspicious circumstences. The morning broke gloriously fine, gladdening the hearts nfm tend big visitors to the copipe wi#n indications of » charming spring-like day. Lom before the hour of starting there was unusual bustle andstir intbe principal streetsqf tbecny, and knots of people were to be seen assembled in front of the different sporting hoBtelries, , discussing the probabilities of the race for the " blue ribbon" of New South Wales, with a close interest. Many there were who vowed the favourite could not lose, while others de clared - ( that Navigator would make the favourite take in his sign. The journey to Hand wick was a pleasant one, and long before the hour of the starting of the first event there was a very fair attendance, which was further increased as the day advanced. Hiw Excellency the Governor and suite were present, and there was a large gathering of well-known Victorian sportsmen on the course. Mr. Sutton, an English oookmaker, was on to© course, and did a large business, laying far more - liberal odds than any of his Australian confreres. Punctual to time the bell rang out for the first event of the day, the Hurdle flaay fof which nine candidates faced the starter. The Dowiing Forest horse, Sportsman, with Gorrigan, was soon established a warm favourite at 5 to 4, but he went down easily before Basilisk, who jumped away with the lead, and was never headed, though had Corrigan not waited so long, the contest might have been more interesting. As it was,: however, Basilisk placed the third win in - Bueoresion- 'to his credit. The Trial Stakes furnished a most exciting struggle all the way up the straight, but Norton, by dint of hard riding, managed to get Saionara home first. All interest now began to be centered in' the Derby, the candidates for which all looked well. No fault could bfi found with the con dition of Segenhoe, who, of course, attracted the greatest amount of attention, though Mi. De Mestre's colt had many faithful adherents. Though a trifle big. Navigator looked well,1 and had evidently gone through a good' pre paration. The others of the quartette, AinVinlos onrl T T ne oIlA annAitWlH f/l Kft very fit. The race itself requires little de scription. Nicholas, in the interest of his stable companion, was. sent to make the run ning, "and be performed his task faithfully. For the first half of the journey the pace wqs very slow, and the favourite was running last. At the entrance of the straight all four horses were together, and loud cries were heard, f Segenhoe wins," but running Terv wide, he gave Navigator a slight advantage, and not withstanding that Yeomans made a desperate effort to reach the gallant little black, to ran home a comfortable winner by a length and a half, amidst tremendous excitement. The winner is a small but compact black colt by Robinson Crusoe, from the imported more j Cocoannt, by Nutbourne, and has started nine times, out of which he has won-eix, lost two, and ran a dead-heat witbGuesswork for seoond place in the Maribyrnong Plate, therefore the -victory is no fluke, and I am satisfied that Segenhoe is not the great colt that he has been represented, and tne clever division mentioned in my Friday's telegram, who would not have him for the Derby, were correct. When the race was over many ; ound fault with theridfog of -Yeomans; but I am satisfied that' had the riders been reversed the result would have been the same, and if the two horses meet in the V.R.C. Derby, Navigator will beat him again. Segenhoe was beaten all riie way, andQ in- my opinion, has not the ghost of a show for the V.R.C. Derby. Eighteen saddled up for the Epsom Handicap, and the judge's fiat was in : favour of Masquerade by half a length. Hecla again showed her ex cellence by landing the Spring Stakes some- what eisiiy. though her rider was nearly caught nappfog, as Barber came with a great rush at the finish, and was only just beaten. Through the accident which befell Fandango, who bolted at the home turn in the Welter Handicap, the ancient Saunterer was pro claimed the winner. Appended we give a detailed &ccount; ofthe racing: — " Hubdle Race, a handicap sweepstakes of 5 sovs. each, 1 ft., with 100 sovs. added. Second horse, 20 sovs. from tho prize, Two miles and a half.

' After the usual preliminaries, the quartette trere 'zoarchailed to . tti€Hr position ai tha gforng-post. Lord Loftns was on the riauie, Navigator next, with Nicholas next, and Segenhoe on the outside. Nicholas dashed away at the fall of the flag' followed by Lord Lortos and Navigator, the favourite being last to go. In this order they passed (he stand. At Cottsk corner Nicholas was ten lengths in advance, the others run ning in Indian file,, with vSegtmhoe still la?t. At (he back of the course the field closed up a little, and at the half-mile post Lord Loitu? went in . front. Thp going up to this had bCea very slow, but on rounding the bend the pace became very fast and Hales and Yeomans both began" to ride their horses. At (he entrance to the straight all four were together, Navigator having thfe slightest advantage, being on the inside. Segenhoe here ran verv wide. When they were fairly in the straight Yeomans sat down on the favourite, and made a tremendous effort to reach Navigator, who was a clear length in front, which he gradually increa-ed to two lengths as they n eared the winning lost, though Yeomans used the whip and £ ur pretty freely, which, however, did not avail pirn, as Navigator won pretty easily by a noligth and a half, amidst tremendous excite ment, Nicholas and Lord Loftu< runnings dead-heat for third place, six lengths behind.

JBryan 0JLyun lorcsed the pace far the first half irnie, Morpeth bring second, and Hypatia third, the favourite five lengths sway, newt. This order was maintained to the turn for home, where Masquerade and Bryxn Bora were seen threading their way to the front.

V T'lSVi ! -"flHOOND DAY; 1' The A.J. C- Spring Meeting was continued to day. The weather was again beautifully fine, and there wae an excellent attendance. Both stands were crowded, and there was a large number of ladies present. Hie racing throughout was well contested. Nine teen horses sported silk for the . Metropoli tan, and Sting retained his position as first favourite to the last. The race was run at good pace throughout, the lead alternating between Harebell, Brunette, and Britisher. Lord Burghley was last to get away, and although his rider made a show of whipping him, he occupied a rearmost position duringthe whole of the race. Lord Orville also got away badly, but he gradually worked his way through his horses, and entering the straight momentarily looked dangerous, but died away at the finish. It was reported that Sting had not done1 a gallop since his victory at Hawkesbury, which of course jeopardised his chance Of sucoess in" the Metropolitan. The win of Masquerade was not a popular one, in consequence of the tacties adopted by . k the stable. Yesterday Lord Burghley, who is iis the same stable as Masquerade, was made second favourite, and was backed by the uublio for a heap of money when his owner was supposed to have got his money on. Masquerade conse quently was knocked to 100 to 6. At midnight a well-known publican, who hails from Botany, apparently very drunk, came into Tattersall's, and backed Masquerade for upwards of £6,000. This commission was for the stable, the backing of Lord Burghley being evidently a blind. This sent Lord Burghley back in the market to 100 to 8, and Mas querade shortened to 5 to L Lord Buigfaley, of course, was never dangerous in the race, the Ivory crowd making no mistake about Masquerade, who won easily.

This being an off-day, only a moderate at tendance assembled: at Randwick to witness the third day of the A. J.C. Spring Meeting. " The weather was again most enjoyable, and the racing well contested. Tne Mares' Produce Stakes created almost as muoh ia- terest as the Derby. Many held the opinion that the Derby winner would go down easily before the daughter of Maribyrnongand Alpaca. Half an honrjbefore the race was run, Navi gator had a slight call in the betting ut 5 to 4 on him, but the extensive support awarded to' Hecla c&USed; Navigator to recede, and a large amount of wagering took place, some thou sands of pounds changing hands, the filly finally -leaving the paddock .at 5 to 4onlier, The race ie very easily described. Nfemgator lay third. until the 'turn for home, --when Hues took him tp the front, and he entered the straight pulling two. double. Williamson rode Hecla with great deter mination, but She could net mod a . vard with, the little blade. Conrng. up the straight. Hales, who was sitting still, kept continually looking over his shoulder, ana without the slightest effort, landed Navigator the easiest oft winners by, two lengths. I mentioned last Saturday, when the Derby was over, that I was satisfied that Segenhoe had not the ghost of a show for the V.R.C. Derby. I am now satisfied that Navigator is a great colt, and as he is susceptible of much improvement, the horse that can beat him will win the Victoria " blue ribbon" of 1882. ; The following are the particulars of the racing : — ' r> Suburban Handicap, of 150 so vs. For three years old and upwards.
