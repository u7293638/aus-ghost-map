BEAUTIFUL BRITAIN. The famous wit, Horace) Walpole, sum- married very neatly the absurdity of spook stories when he said, in speaking of the dilapidated condition of Ham House, that it was " in such a state of pulp and sisters, barricaded with walls, trees and gates, that one could imagine oneself in the midst of bygone ages, " and that he expected to see ghosts " sweep by him-" ghosts, too, that I would not give a sixpence to see, Lauder dale's and Tollemache a and Maitland's." Thereafter all, are very few ghosts among all those with which tradition endows the old homes of England that would be worth see- . ing if one really could see them And yet the ghost stories in themselves, full of the quaintness of the past century, make very pleasant reading, as do indeed many of the other excursions into the by-ways of history. which readers of our " Beautiful Britain " Portfolio find described for their benefit.
