Dressing Under Difficulties. Tho Tasmanian Main Line Bailway, in addition to being Ilkoly to give rise to n "oanso celebre," is, wo believo, destined to figuro in somo future romance and tale in tho usual manner in which trains are mado to work and perform their pnrts ia sensational novels of the Ainsworth, Lowis and Wood style. The latest skit has it, that a certain gentleman, an occasional resident ia our town, had to loavp by traio for Launceston tho next morning; so knowing the effects that nobbleriBi'ng has on ono's capabilities for early rising, he very wisely ordered a cab to call at his lodg ings at such a time the next morn ing as to seenre his sara nnd certain de parture. Thus having, "as far as human foresight conld command," arranged for and ensured the "passage up," our friend Bur- rendered himself to tho "Midnight's sliout and revelry, Tipsy' dance and jollity," which, of course, is usual on such occasions, and whiob custom, and, abovo ail, the par ticular occasion justified. Wo forbear relating tho remaining personal events and incidents of that evening ; bat suffice it to say that obedient to command, a tho time appointed, cabby rattled up to the good man's residence, but no passonger was there awaiting his arrival, and Jehu wns puzzled. An accident, by no means of nu uncommon occurrence, hnd happened, Bnd piovented tho intended fare from being n a punctual to his engagement as "lochar- rctier" would have wished. Tho truth is the good man had ovcrslopt, nnd while Jehu wos grumbling and in the strongest English expressing his disapprobation of thus being kept unnecessarily waiting, tlio oxpectod "fare" was fast iu the artnsjof Morpheus; but on receiving tho announcement that it was timo to riss and prepare for the journey that was before him, lio, recollecting the circumstances of the previous evening, and above all his appointment, throw off dull sleep, sprang out of bed, and looking at the time picco that merrily ticked over tho mantelpiece, fouud to hie indescribaole horror, that it barely wanted ten minutes to the time the train Blnrtcd, and in that briof spaco ho would have to wash, dress, and perform tho very essential, to a full-Hedged gentleman, duties of tho toilet. Tho thing was impossible, and dark deBpnir was just beginning to tako possession nnd " settle o'er his mind" whon a happy thought struck tho miserable man. Why, he could throw over his night clothes his old black cloak, " well brushed and neat," which was, poetry aside, none other than an unpretentious, but by no moans uucomfortable or incon venient UlBter great coat, and his clean whito shirt and its appurtenance, a collar, he could append to his portmanteau, and thus apparelled, no ono being any the wiser as to tho nature of tuo undergar ment, could with an easy mind take his passage to the station and his seat in the railway carriage. So, as Hamlet says, after "suiting tho action to the word," the voyagenr, thus equipped, entered the cab, and drove off to tho station. When . be arrived thero the train was just about to Btnrt, but our frieud managed to secure a ticket and scramplo into a first-class carringo, which, as ill-luck would have It, was occupied by some ladles and four or five young swells of the first water, who stBred uncommonly hard at tho "seedy," Blecply-looking, unkempt, and mysteri ously-dressed individual who uncoromoai- ously intruded with the accompaniment of n carpet- bag and parcel attached thereto. Every look was a dagger to tha heart of poor L (for that wns tho first initial of his name), who was always most scrupulous in points of dress, as overy gentleman is, or should be, and who always prided himeelf on making nn impression on the " profnnus vulgus " by his personal ap pearance, as well as on the Indies, to whom lie flattered himself to bo irrcsistablc. He wns not, as will bo readily expected, this timo very imposing nor in tho least im pulsive. But better tunes were on the wing, the train was about to pass through the tunnel, and a new light n sudd e i inspiration, seemed to break in upon his mind with tho thought that whilst this' underground passage was been made, conldg;bc((-not, aided by the Egyptian darkness, divest himself of tho Ulster as well ns of tho hateful nnder- garments, nnd qnickly endue himself in what we shall to spare tho delicacy of tho unfortunnt gentleman, call " une chemiBG blanche," So jitGt as tho carriage was entering th region of darkness, as quick ns thought MrL pulled off the unoffending over coat, nnd its immediate skin companion, "la robo de nnit," and then made a violent rash into the clean shirt ; but alas I wristbands and neckband were but toned as fast as new buttons could make them. In an agony of spirit easier to ba conceived than described, with n cold perspi ration starting from every pore, he mado su perhuman efforts to free himself from tho unfortunate dilemma by trying either to got into or get ont of the accursed article. But whilst nil this was going on, the train gra dually debouched from " lo chorain convert," glided into tho light of day, and discovered to the ocoapnnts of tho enrriago, tho 'unco Bight of something like Hamlet's ghost in a fog, hitting out right and left, whilo making at tho same lime an upward perpendicular movement, to find a passage either for his confined bond, or tho two arms, that wero so sud denly arrested in their course through a pair of whito linon shirt sleeves by " les boutons," At last, neither flesh and blood, nor buttons, being able to stand tlio fearful strain any longer, one wonld have to yield, and so the weaker of the two, tlic neckband button, gavo way, and allowed tho nobler portion of tbo human structure, which we term tho head, n free passoge. Tho wretched man then beheld, with a poignancy of feeling which none but those that have been similnrly circumstanced could imagine, tho indies in tho utmost con fusion, somo shutting ont the horrid nppari'- tion by hiding their faces in their hands ; others with cheeks "that but an hour aeo niusnea nt vne praise or cueir owu luvuu- nesB," now scarlet red with tho terrible thought t,f Beeing in all iloBtern. reality, tho sight of "beauty unadorned adorned the most," beiDg thus so unexpected, yet partially obtruded en their unwilling gaze, whilo the gentlemen wero vainly endeavoring to stiflo tbo almostuncontrolltthlo laughter that sueh grolesqueness provoked, although it must bs confessed that somo wero not without their misgivings as to having for a companion a maniac, or, at least, a being under the influ ence of strungo supernatural, porhaps dia bolical agency, . To spare tho feelings of tho man, as well as theso of tho ladies which would bo further shocked and offended by an ox- tended recital, of theso horrors, we will draw a veil over tho rest of tho proceed ings, leaving an ardent or inventivo imagination to supply the remaining act of such a laugh-iirovoking comedy; hut, first, for the sutisfuction of our readers, wo will say, and we havB it on good authority, that at tho next station, Mr L., with the greatest imaginable alnority, botook himself to another and Btill unoccupied carriage, there to brood over a misfortune that, though as unforeseen ns uncontrollablo, Bhed n mrlnnoholio gloom, that at timos nssdmed the tinge of mndnoss over tho mind of tho miserablo ono who, like a man that views a sceno through tho medium of groan spec tacles, nnd fancies earth, sky, son, and air being tbo samo verdant color as tho glasses ho wearB, bow for tho rost of his journey nothing but tho mocking vision of a carringo full of peoplo wildly laughing nt him fighting against fearful odds ts Becuro the laxury of a chnngo of clean linon. Tho feelings of tho unhappy man wero, wo have b3foro said, such ns defied portrayal, even by tho most searching skilful pen. Yet still ho must have felt inclined whon in the thick of his misfortune, in an ngony of soirit truly indescribable, to havo soroeohod with tho poet, that is, proBU.ming ho was acquainted with tho lincB, Final destruction sotzo oil all tlio world !
