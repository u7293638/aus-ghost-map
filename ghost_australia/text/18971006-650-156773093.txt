To the Editor of the National Advocate Sik, â€” Your correspondent at Lucknow has been at some pains to make things look as bad as possiblo for the strikers, and hahas proved to.be a bad prophet. The strike has now run nine weeks, and any man reading bis effusions would think the men would have given up the Strike Ghost long ago. My opinion of your man is that he is either a strong partisan of Lock or else ho is some crass individual with a discontented mind who would eat a strike loaf and side with his follows to their face and then sit down alone and pour out the vials of a distorted vision. Happily we have few men of that kind amongrt us, and for my part I would prefer living amongst vipers than with one such man. The Luck now slrilvcrs are going to win, make no mis take ; and the people of the colony will keop the strike funds alive all tho time. The great superintendent is now paying 7s Gd a day to his men, and ha3 given them a bonus to como up ns well. So where is the advant age to him ? He wanted to punish some body, and punished tho innocent. Which means honest miners and their wives and children. I aBk you to puhlish this as I have noticed your columns are opened to both eides. Yours, etc., STRIKER. Oct. 4.
