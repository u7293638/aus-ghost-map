Donegal. Faint is the fairy musio and palo tho fairy' ? rings, And lonely grows tho quickens around the holy -springs. . Tho Strangers* Forts no longer hoar tho Danish battle-oall, My sorrow and my sorrow, Donegal I Will you hoar thorn if you listen all tho twi light through Tho ragweed flowers talking to tho feather few ' When the foggy dews upon them with their love gifts fall?, My sorrow and my sorrow, Donegal I Tho world ories out for Una of the shadowy hair, All muaio wails for Oiflln j and tho oolouroci air , Woops heavy tears for Niam,- and' hoi1 spell songs all, My sorrow and my sorrow, Donegal I There is wooping wator in the holy well of . Doono, For tho.gay and gontlo pooploby tho harvest moon,* Unseen tho sloop flood's 'dropping from tho king fern tail- * My sorrow and my sorrow, Donogal 1 Will the strangers come again with their great swords made bare, And tho horned helmots shining on their yellow hair ? 'Will Manan of the Waters take their ships as Bteods to stall? ' , My sorrow and my sorrow, Donegal ! If tho Strangers come no more in the eye of the sun Their 'ghosts shall still hold revel in the forts the'jfc.-won ! They shall match themselves at hurling, and of gold shall be their ball, And their glory still be on thee, Donegal ! Nora Hopper,
