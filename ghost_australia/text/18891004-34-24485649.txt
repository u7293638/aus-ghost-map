If it wen wise to in crease the number af inimsuaislina wen they elected by the people, it was also wise to increanrthem if not absolatery elected by the people. Why aid they propose to Inonaie the members? Because having only two members trom each colony, they only got the ij><iii«i*i« of two men, whereas by having a larger number they enlarged the opportunity tor an exchange cf Mesa,and tha Influence of the Council would be much extended. Thsy wen only now giving ftlect to what wen the wishes ot ths Bouse bat saaiott. Tbe reprstentstives ot Sooth Auetn?a went to the Federal Oounoil for she porposs of orgiag an inorease in tbe number of members and a uniform mode ol election. Now on this latter ques tion a difficulty bad been experienced. In ftedlf ferent colcnies members were elected to the Houses ot Parliament under various qualifications, and in some colonies members of the Legislative Council were elected, wfcile in others they were nominates by tta Government. Sir Gamuel Griffith and other members of the Federal Council pointed out that for the pre sent it would be Irnpotdble to get the colonies to agree to one uniform mode ot election Then it was screed that an address should be sent to the Qoeen tn terms of the nsojnbon the Bouce wen now asked to adopt. In Victoria the leader of tbe Government bad moved tbe adoption of tbe address, -the leader of the OpportMo? bad seconded it, and tbe motion had been curled without any dMaVrn. (Cheers.) A sbnttar motion had been carried io Queensland, Western Aottnlhv, and Tasmania and it now remained tor us - tocsrrytt. He contended that we would be placed in amostfalse and humiliating position if the motion were not agreed to, seeing that we had taken the inttMrre In the matter, and while be had not the tlfehtrst haras to the result in this Hoase, he asked the member* of another branch ot the T«nlsliHne to oonetdn tbe fane position In wtdeb South Australia would bs placed H the address wan sot agreed to. ; Although be admitted tkat up to the pssaenttim* tbe i Federal Council had done but little.

Helookad sttbeqoettie?DOtM ose of tbe day, but as one of tbe future, which would reflect as it were the good, and useful actions of the put. Forty yean ago the unequal laws drove men into a state of domestic dasne sere than Illegal onanhatlnas. These omni satkas aad wwnHnaslnns had proved Wett ings to the world. Be would briefly- show the causes which bad driven men into mnoaa.

Ho matter what the age of a sovereign tt was always wotth its weight in gold, and to protect aad maintain the v?lne of a loaned sovereign fte banks formed tbutselvee into snsn~ii turns and made their own terms wift those who used tfeeirrooaey. Tbeman of labor If he required their money was bound to their win asd forced to their turne whether bs liked it or not Then was no choice, tor the banks wen masters of tbe attaaaon But tbe man of labor who put his labor on ihe market got jmt whs* the man of sovereigns out of bun. When fte contract expired fte isoor isme back, not aclmpalrsd like fte sovereign, but coatidenbly worn, and fte more often the labor re turned it was nearer its natural end until at list It seated to come back at all. tt wsa entirely worn out, and unlike the sovereign was always worth Us weight In gold t?JtDHbeeame valueless. The labor had been a cooveMlaooe and aervaet to the sovereign: U had done Ms duty; it oessed to exist; It wss dead and tonotten: but fte aapaaLsovereigg, lived on to w*ar ouVinonsabartaiaetadottfane. Tot they grumbled attrsdt asaadatioos, wMeh combined to protect tbeir labor, whtob wat ben to-day and gone to-morro? When was the eqnaUty of upitd and labor? Labor wat the tatabftd tervast aao served tbe world; the oapttaast wss the master aad ruled fte world, end often with a merciless iron tut That was Hit true relation between oapttalaad labor, and now hs would go on to sbow how tbe workiac men hsd emerged from a state ot brutal slavery to be freemen.
