2b the Editors of ÉeWi'Lifo ia Syndet/. ? . GKNTLBMBS,--AS you liaro not given Lottery's time in answer to J. C's question, it willnevor 'bo tukon for. granted that, Ben Bolt's three miles (5.-öl) has,never beeil beaten in tlie colony; andyoú 'will thus be ..cover- ing master Ben. with an hdVior. ho 'hhs -no claim to.:, I; havo no wish to take from the gallant- cliesnut anything that may be claimed for him j but I do not like to. Bee the "gamo old horses" of other days robbod of their hard-won laurels by horses that would, not stand the ghost of a chance with them. Whore .would alt the' " dons" of tho present day be if they, had such horses ns Old Jorrocks, Plover, Lottery, Blue, Bonnet, Cassandra, Harry Lorroquer, Marchioness, and' tithers. to compete with? These horses havo pinned away, but their per-. formanccs still exist, lt has been "all .tho go" of lute' years to pu(T up every 'winner;.- but our'old .horses whoso like we shall never seo nguiu-should not ba for-, gotten. [On tho present occasion I shall,' content my self by placing Lottery befare Ben1 Bolt by one second. Lottory and Jorroeks-bravo". old rJorrocks--ran three miles over Homebush in '44 in S 'min 60 socs, and stich, anothor race was never soon in this oolony. -it-may^bo said there is only one second between Bon Bolt' and tilt quickest three miles ever run her*. This would not bo correct. I can produco.an authenticated throe miles racc^rim in 6 nun 48 socs !*. which puts Bon Bolt quietly ono side nt once.. ;<?. ?. - - . ..' :-,. .' '.
