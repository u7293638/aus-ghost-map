ON THE TRACK OF A CONSPIRATOR. (By Lucian Sorreli.) 'Haunted? . -What a queer kid you are, Bob. ' Why on earth should it be?' 'Oh, I don't know,' answered Bob, rather sheepishly. 'Only such a jolly lot must have. happened here; and those blood stains ? '-, ? 'Were made by some iodine I upset this morning,' replied Dr. Everett, laughing. 'See that little sink, and the shelves and bottles? Well, this is really my dispen sary; and as I hadn't much accommodation I thought it'd be a good idea to iix it upsas a bedroom for you bo3rs. I fancied Id had everything you were likely to want put in; but 'pon my word, I forgot about ordering'ghosts for Bob. Still, I hope j'ou'il sleep comfortable in spite of that. Good night.' The two boj's undressed, and, jumping into bed, closed the mosquito curtains. Their father was the owner of some large silk mills at Lahore, and he had packed them off for a few days on a visit to then brother, Dr. Gerald Everett, who had been aiiuointed .a short time before resident Eng glish physician to the Maharajah of Bhun dapur. ' For several weeks the old mon arch had been suffering from a mysterious illness, and the doctor, whose services were required at all hours, had rooms in his palace, so the boys were actually dwelling for a time 'in marble balls. Jim Everett,' a matter-of-fact sort . of youth, was quite content with dreaming about them; but Bob, who had read enough books of adventure to know that the old marble floors of the palace— per- haps of that very room— must nave drunk in other liquid than iodine, and . that ghosts had every reason for haunting the place, tried) in vain! to, get to sleep. Hour after hour passed by as, tossing restlessly from side to side, he listened to the taono tonous ticking of the little travelling clockj and conjured up fanciful pictures of past tragedies. Suddenly his strained ears '.caught another sound mingled with the:ticking;. and, sitting bolt upright, he dre\v the gauze curtains noiselessly . aside. A 'bis mosquito sailed in Triumphantly, and. buzzed over his head. ' -:. :'? ? .'/.'? Bob got under the 'clothes : for protec tion ; but his head was very soon out ? again, for he distinctly heard someone trying the handle . of the door.-. A little moonligbt filtered through the ' iealo.usT.es;; just enough to show him, through the thin gauze curtains, that a man; -was creeping stealthily into the room.. *-Bob lay fetjH and held his : breath as: thei Jfijsure, which'-, earned a small lamp— -a^he. could tell frbm' the blurred light .-6np^ug;;fthrdugh^ tM; gauzes-passed tlie' rbedy ;£nd|»tplfi. .ton ^t^ wards'vthe shelves.1 :: ?

He pulled the' curtains an inch or two apart, and, peering through t saw some thing that seemed to send his heart into his mouth. Standing -by the shelves, with- ' ': the lamp-light full on his dark turbaned face, was a native whom young Everett had already noticed in the palace. Bob lay as still as a mouse, and watched . through his narrow spy-hole as the intru-' der took down a large glass, jar, and poured into it about twenty drops from a tiny red phial which he had with him-. He re stoppered the jar and placed it back on the shelf, and then crept noiselessly .'to wards the door. When he- reached it,,!. - he hesitated for a moment, turned back ' '- again, and, to Bob's'horror, drew aside the .. curtains of the bed. Bob shut his eyes' tightly, and hardly dared to breathe while the man stood, there, glaring down on the ^ '': boys in the lamp-light. At last, evidently ' ' :? satisfied with his inspection, the native let '?'.' the curtains fall; and passed out of the room. .„-.-?. . II. It must have been half an hour before.: Bob ventured to slip out of bed, light a -- candle, and examine .the jar which had - been 'doctored.' It was labelled 'die- ?'- tilled water,' and the contents of the ? phial must have been colorless, for there ??-':'.* was nothing to show that the 'jar had been '??'? tampered with. He put it back on the--., shelf; and then, after barricading the. door.'' . -'' with chairs and bags, slipped^ into l»edj '? :'.:'.l again, deciding to take Jim into his con-. -?-: fidence in the morning, and, if. possible; to ';r^-;: test the effect of the stuff., in some way.- '??'?-??'.. : He had hardly made up his mind, -it' .'''-?''?: seemed, before Gerald, thundered at ? the ??;. :J door.

N.ow.-'Ci then, Jim, get up, you lazy young beggar v^ —breakfast's on the table.' Dl. Everett -v^i- went over towards the shelves. 'I've gbt i^: to make up the morning dose for my old' ' . patient,' he said; 'it won't interfere with - ; your dressing, though.' . : To Bob's horror, he got down the -water =;V jar, and placed it on tne edge of the: sink, ?? 'while he reached up for some smaller bot--, ' ties. ,His young brother had not auite./:;.,? decided whether to say anything .about *h§M^ night's adventure, until he had tested; ?their.f.SSp contents of the jar; for the ;dt-cfcp^si|Bte||fflrtS -about ghosts- and; ?iniirders ':? ?.to'aafefb.ii%£a rather inclined to;c6nadefirsJ^^;J^5?jaia^^ warning!

Mian's gardens, which lay between tne palace Kr I and the river. The man turned sharp to ?' ,'thc left when he reached the waters edge,. ittrtd the two boys followed him lor about i half a mile, to a spot where the river was . ? 'broken into' two channels by a thickly ' [wooded island. A few yards further on , !a boat was fastened to a kind of windlass ion the shore, and, getting into her, the na ? l-jtive partly drifted, partly paddled across ko some marble landing steps on the island. i,When he had disappeared among Uie trees ?;*he boys ran forward to the windlass. i 'I say, here's a stroke of luoi, ex claimed' Jim, as he examined it. rwio the idea? The current sets strongly across ?the channel, so you* pay. out tne rope as ''?you' drift over, and then you re able to Jiaul yourself back again. Tell yoii whab Ifche fellow was in too mucn of a hurry to do more 'than lun the boat on to tiie mud. [We'll wind it in again and gb across. f It was not an easy nob, but at Jast tlie boys managed to haul the -boat back .o whore; and Jive minutes later they were following a winding path that ran through the trees and :-iirubs on the -island. It lj=d jto a little pinnacled pavilion, through the ?open window of which a light was shin , iing. Making a^-slight detour, the bovs crawled round the back of the house, -m- iil they were able to peer m without being ' .observed. -Luckily, the wimJcv was net many feet from the 'groun.i. ''What a- scrumptious little place!' whis pered Bob. 'Why, it's all gold and ivory! And just look at the lamp ? ' ?'Shut up!' Jim answered gruffly, as a Eecond native came forward from the back of the pavilion and joined thiir friend, who was standing by a little inlaid table, on which were a bottle of champagne and : two richly-chased- goblets. Hob gasped as !the newcomer put down on the table a bag, evidently filled with com, and a tiny ? terra-cotta ph«i!. ! ? 'The oilitr ivas red -I aavr it i& the 'lamplight,' Bob whispered. i The man whom they had tracked took up : ihe bag, looked at its contents conterup ; tuously, and (lung it on the table again with ? ?ii volley of angry words. For a minute or ?two there was a noisy discussion between the two men, then, with a shrug of the 1 shoulders, the island native went to the l-ack of the pavilion, closely followed by ihe other; and, shifting their ground a ftii't, tlie boys fiiiw that they had entered 'a a tiny room, screened from .the first by ? iheavy curtains. As the.-e closed behind .the couple, Bob sprang to the window, and tiirusf in his arm up to the shoulder. :? 'What on earth arc you up to':1' whis pered Jim. Half a minute later, with his face very flushed, Bob drew back his arm. j 'Tin doctoring the chap with Ins own medicine,' he said. 'Emptied the phial in . to his cup— that's all. Hush.' . ; At that moment tlie natives returned, \- ' the host looking as sour as .vinegar, and his visitor, who was jingling in his hand the bag of money, pleased and triumphant. ? --After a few more words, he finished the ' 1 oliairipagr.e, took up the phial, and went ? I out. The boys -crept after him behind the ' ?ir-ees. ? 'Well, nothing's happened, said Jim. . 'He seems rather unsettled on his pinSj though— too much ' champagne, I suppose. ; The native stepped rather heavily into the boat, and, paddling with one- hand, drew 'in the rope with the other. He had not 'gone many yards when the boys saw the a'-ope and ficull drop suddenly from his ' grasp, and, with a groan, he sank back in '?the boat. Bob was darting out from the ? {'bushes, when his brother clutched his arm, ?ani drew him back. 'Keep quiet, you idiot, he said. It a 'only a drunken sleep, 1 expect. Besides, :'he added, as a voice suddenly broke the 'stillness, 'there's someone on the other hank. He's hailing the chap, I think. ?The boys listened for a minute; then they :iboth sprang up, and, waving their caps, yelled to their brother across the water. -? 'Hullo, I've found you, then, you young ' ' 'beggars, lie shouted J3ai:k. ''What's -?: .wrong with the chap in the boat?' ?? ?? Before they could answer, lit' went to the windlass; and the boys waited wl-ile (the boat came swooping through the water i ' }to where Dr. Everett stood. He bent for ; --vard to shake the man; and then, with a :: :.?;-? Sudden exclamation, got in beside him, and ;' . 'paddled over to the island. '??'??'. : 'What's the meaning of this?' he asked. ''The fellow's dead!' '.' It did hot take Dr. Everett long to piece together the whole story from the boy's f' planation. The tnan. a high official in e Maharajah's suite, had evidently been the pay of a rival claimant to the ((throne, a -prince who had a palace on the JBJsland. T4ie old monarch's illness was due %o very skilful and gradual poisoning, the feontenbs oi 'the phials being no doubt -pre- ; ' Kiared hy the -prince himself. Of course pie dose which Bob had giveirto the native ' '. jiwas an exceptionally strong one, and his. constitution, unlike that of the old r . iMoJiarajab, had not been prepared to resist Wthe action of tlie poison by previous ldraufdits. -?? | 'Well,' said Dr. Everett, when they tod ?- ilhiddenthe body among *the bushes'on the. .^Selatfdi and crossed back to the shore, 'we „ .
