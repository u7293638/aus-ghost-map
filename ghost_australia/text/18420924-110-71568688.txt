THE BARK OF DEATH. In Fancy's world a valley lies, Of dark and fearless hue, Where, noiseless, viewless, vast of size, A river oozes through. Across that river, too and fro, A bark still gliding keeps, Yet stirs it not the wave below, In silence drear that sleeps. For, spectral as a cloud by night, That bark appears to view; Nor can the form that guides its flight, Be seen the darkness through. Tis Death! a shadow huge and dim; He sits to pilot o'er Enfranchlised ghosts, recalled by him From Time's sprite-haunted shore. Oh whither glides that spectral bark Far mid the gloom 'tis gone ! Again, through vista long and dark, It comes-with Death alone. Once more to Time's o'ershadowed coast It speeds --Once more appears, Surcharged'with many a silent ghost, And tow'rds the Future steers. And thus, while Time's dread coarse shall last, O'er that dark river's tide, To fill the Future from the Past, Death's bark shall ever glide.
