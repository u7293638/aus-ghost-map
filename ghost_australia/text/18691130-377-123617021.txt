MARYBOROUGH. [vau OU ont oe o umn?u'so ENT.] I am happy to inform you that on Saturday next the first number of the Maryborough Mail will issue -I believe as ajbi-weekly. It will supply a want that bas been long felt, and I trust, as I firmly believe, it will be a prosperous undertaking. Our old friend White, of the Burnellt Argus, is the proprietor. He will be favourably remembered as the proprietor of the Wide Bay Timcs, nine years ago, and as the first to. tart a newspaper north of Brisbane. This important and rapidly rising district has been toolong without a second newspaper. I trust the people of Wide Bay will see the necessity of giving the new undertaking their hearty support; and I sincerely hope Mr. White on Iis part will do his duty as a journalist strictly and impartially, and sternly set, his face against all cliques. It is reported that when White arrived from Gayndah by the coach and stated that'he was the representative of the Maryborough Mail, the 2ribune bolted and has not since been heard of-perhaps to Gayndab to resuscitate the A.rgas. Will the member for Maryburrum supply the Cleronicle with a few more coals to kbeep the pot boiling, or will he perpetrate another unbecoming act and leave it to perish ? Of course ; he will leave his friend, if not slave, to die ; and, as a consequenee, will never show his " brass" on the 3farboroegh hustings again; for without his "too, too' faithful slave his "brass" would be of no avarsil. Woe to "our coal bleak member" and the subservient hounds that are fawning on and whineing round him when he comes to the district he so grossly mie- represents! Ivanhoe is here clothedin Mail, armed eapra-pie, to assert the rights of Moryborough fearlessly. Will the Ghost of Ban Ban, alias Hard-up, alias the Burrum Monster, dare to cross blades with our champion ? No, lhe will book it (like the eribune), and may the blessing of a bullock-driveor go with him. November 22, 1869.
