r~ ABOVE THE SPEAKER. a( I Bt TiMOTHEUS. " Timotheus placed on high." - The nautical novelists as a trick of their trade have a habit of describing how suddenly the storm blows itself out The shrieking of the gale through the rigging is sue carded by the flapping of the canvas in the calm The sea which threatened to devour the vessel now fawns upon her sides and so on So it is with this Assembly), it is either all fury or all collapse this week was collapse again the previous Thursday Friday sitting and its proceedings rather seated hon members themselves None of them want to descend straight away to the American system of raking up or inventing home Scandals The members with skeletons in their closets are averse on that account and the members with clean hands know how readily charges are trumped up The leading case, of course, is that of Mark Twain, who stood for New York in order to give the citizens a chance of electing a strictly moral man, and who retired from the strife in consequence of the success of the other side in accumulating evidence that he was a demoralised camp. It was the obstructionists who were hit the previous week And these hits and their desertion by the Corner, together with the remonstrances of constituents and the reprobation of the press, made certain gentlemen somewhat sick The conclusion they came to was to drop this business and let legislation preceded It is a curious position, however The stranger enters the chamber either to see certain members playing the murderers down, forefeet firmly planted, now indulging in a kick, and now a bite-or else there is progress at a hand gallop So strong was the reaction that 80 out of the 87 members were for peace and progress on the Tuesday The exception was the South Melbourne junior Mr Gaunson made sporting offers to renew the conflict to further fit, fit the bill on the single electorates to fight it on the increase of Melbourne members, to fight it on the insufficient number of country members, or to fight it on any other reason but not one member could be found to stand either at his nUit hand or his left. Horatius Codes could not keep the bridge without some assistance, and the member for South Melbourne (easily) succumbed, easing the situation by " taking it out of a constituent, a municipal councillor who had written to the papers denying the statement that the local council was in favour of the stonewall This audacious individual was described to the House afterwards as crawling up the Ministers sleeve in order to be made a J P of The sight of the team all going seemed to fill the heart of the Premier r with glee It was impossible for him, apparently, to refrain from cracking his whip over their heads to keep the pace up One member had the benefit of an interjection that made him jump as though he were bit, and another member received a comment that caused him to kick Mr Munro was furious for a few moments, and Mr Zox was Bad for a whole evening Of course, it was a great thing for the Premier to see the bill safe and lying throughly The sea sion has been in session, and that of no one else As Treasurer he framed and in troduced the big Budget which lie almost but did not quite carr) As head of the Govern mental master of the subject-he framed and introduced the Electoral Bill, another big measure, and he could scarcely but have been hurt had he been compelled to drop this also The prospect of one big success was pleasant And it is pleasant also to be up in one s subject, know in" more than all the rest put together, and to be master of the situation, and this touching up of members is one of the little w a) s in which the Premier shows delight. Under some circumstances Ina com mental would have had the House in an uproar But then Mr Gillies would say that if there had been any chance of disturbing the peace he would not have touched up the horses. "I must do whatever my constituents tell me,' pleaded one representative ' I they might tell you to go to Hong Kong was the comment-and the number understood that the Minister would not object if the constituents did issue that in and ate 1 or once Mr Patterson found virtue rewarded in politics It was his address that hardened the Corner against stonewalling, and showed the Opposition that brocken" would destroy the party At the last pinch either Castlemaine or Maldon had to lose a member, or a member had to be added to the bill It seemed hard that the leader who had broken down the stonewall should be the sufferer Ministers could not consent but they did not refuse Members said Mr Gillies, must take the responsibility on them selves, and so on, and on the voices without a division, Castlemaine and Maldon retained their seats Mr Patterson did not have to say one word to make an appeal If, under these circumstances Castlemaine is not more bound to its senior representative than ever It is indeed guilty of black ingratitude The arrangement secured a peaceful end for the committee work of the measure Mandurang gets its territory back and its representative So does Sand hurst. And so it came to pass that at the j close the edifying spectacle was seen of Dr Quick congratulating the Government, and the M'Intyre leading off the final cheers. Thus it is in politics that the impossible happens The country pays as usual. It is charged with a new member, but in the general pact fication the country which is not usual gets something for its money After all that had been said about plots, about "gerrymandering and all that sort of thing, it was strange to see the electorates adopted in hot haste, with as a rule, the smallest of alterations. In the play, when Tilbunna raves about the Armada, hears the roar of its guns and the groans of the van quieted, and sees the flapping of the sails, the father checks the outburst with the historic rebuke, "the Spanish fleet you cannot see, because its not in sight" Hon members on these Electoral Bill occasions do the lilbuRne having business They decision about the iniquity of the Government measure, affirming with staggering solemnity that it is framed to crush the one side and to leave the other This is considered the orthodox procedure, but when it comes to the point no disclosures are made, because there are none to make Privately the current remark of the Opposition members was", " Oh, we know Mr Gillies is not that sort of a man, and publicly at the end, Mr Bent said he did not suppose anyone could have managed better It is with these tales of electoral scandals as with apparitions ' Do you believe in (ghosts' the lady asked Coleridge ' No madam was the reply, I have seen too many of them ' iheEastMclbourneelectorutenrrangemcnts seemed to have somewhat strained the reta turns between Mr Zox and the Premier If East Melbourne had to be increased Mr Zox wanted Jolimont, which is in his municipal bounds, sure] he has got South Fitzroy, which is outside them A protest has been put in, and an adverse third reading vote is talked of But probably Mr Zox will reserve his threatened severity for Electoral Hill No 2, the measure which is to imprison the men who votes twice, and to imprison also The man who does not vote at all Here Mr Fox can be as severe as he pleases, with the full approbation of his constituents And yet, probably, he will temper justice with mercy) He knows that Mr Gillies is one of a small group of constitutionalists who have never supported the property vote, believing that it did the part as much mis-. chief as good Mr Wrixon has been with him also the Ministers upon whom the surrender must have come as a strain ace Mr Walker and Mr Derham These hon gentlemen will be the victims to Peel a rule, that a politician may be slow to enter a Cabinet, but he must be slower still to leave it. Mr. Bent ort blacking and Its evils was interesting Most men can speak well when they know their subject When Reynard gate up the grapes, there is every reason to suppose that he was eloquent in the next alpine assembly upon the folly of high jumping On Thursday Mr Bent was in a minority of seven on a stonewall motion. On Mumlog places he upbraided the Comer (which had voted solid with the Government for its gross ingratitude in not crossing the floor, reflected on his associates for obstinacy in taking the division and finally settled down to a description of blocking as mere folly. "What is the use of it We lose our sleep and our tempers. It costs Â£2 for a cab to Brighton. Next day we are unfit for business. And nobody thanks us." But what of the current impression that Mr. Bent is the lender of the blockers? Well, Walpole regarded history as a collection of fables, and Mr. Bent would probably describe journalism as a string of ribs. The remains, be says, on the stonewall evenings, not to encourage the blockers, bat to moderate them. Every man his own Boswell, and why not every man his own whitewashed I
