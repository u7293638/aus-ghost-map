Church Lads' Brigade. Mb. Meiklbham, who is widely known for the interest be takes in boye, and for tbe fict that he gives his evenings constantly to pro-, viding sleight-of-hand entertainments for charitable pnrposes, gave last Saturday even ing, to the boys of the C.L.B. Co., an enter tainment in St. Peter's Schoolroom. Mr. Meikleham showed some remarkable illusions and many clever tricks with cards and simple household ' apparatus. The ' ghost' illusion wagjmoat successful ; tbe ' basket' trick pro duced |uproarioos fun ; and the recitation of the scene between Jonah and bis wife Maria on tbe appearance of a 'wild beast' under Maria's wardrobe oonvul&ed; everybody. Mr. Meikleham, when in Campbelltowu, in tbe street or elsewhere, is to be found surrounded by a crowd of interested boys. The C.L.B. Co. should be encouraged in the real design of their enrolment by such interest as Mr. Meikleham takes in them.
