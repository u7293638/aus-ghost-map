TORQUAY. (FROM OUH OWN CORRESPONDENT.) The Christmas week has passed quietly by, the only thing claiming special notice during the festive season being a really delightful musical entertainment, yclept the ' Flower Queen,' given by the young ladies of Latrobe last Friday even ing in the Devon Institute. The room liad been very prettily arranged, aud looked gay with ferns, flowers, and flags. The young ladies, between 20 and 30 in number, possessing in common with all Tasmanian young ladies, the bloom of health and beauty, were well up in their respective parts, and arranged in white muslin, decorated with the several flowers they represented, made a grand picture on the stage. An old Victorian friend, Mrs Purdm, made, as might be expected, a splendid accompanyist, and the cantata went off smoothly without the ghost of a hitch. The Rev. Mr Bennett, in a preliminary speech, explained the argument of the piece, and at its conclusion, Mr M'Call, on behalf of the cricket club, returned thanks to the ladies who had taken part, complimenting them on the success of the cantata, and Miss Bennett in particular for the pains taken in working the idea out. It is almost needless to state that the hall was densely packed, and the audience seemed to thoroughly appreciate the musical and histrionic abilities of the fair performers.
