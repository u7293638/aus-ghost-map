An Apparition. The public of Vienna have been much troubled by tlie story of an opparition[which has lately occupied the newspapers of the Austrinn Capital. A sentry, posted by night in the lobbies of tho Imperial Palace, observed to his dismay a female figure, enveloped in the long folds of a capacious cloak, emerge from the chambers of the iate Archduchess Sophin. The alarmed soUior at once saved himself from intercourse with the Â£host by mght, and told his story to his superior officer. Without putting faith in his narra tive, the Marshal of the Court established a watch, aud caused the lobbies communicating with the room of the mother of the Emperor to be occupied by the palace guards. Next night the mysterious vision was again seen by several persons, but vanished almost instantly Another night the phantom showed itself to a second sentry, who fainted with terror. Some days later a ne* sentry saw the spectre approach, but moro bold than his companions, maintained his sang froid, and aimed a blow at it with his bayonet. The spectre thereupon took to flight, but, pursued by the soldier, fell mor tally wounded by a bayonet thrust in the back. The guards and attendants hastened to the spot on hearing the cries of the wounded ghost, and found a beardless youth, who was recognised as a priest. The strangest part of the business is that the court has done its utmost to hush the matter np ; and the soldier whose bayonet led to the discovery of the mysterj has been relieved from his sentry duties, and sent, as was said, to join a distant garrison. The Tagblatt, however, says he has been put in a prison, and is now in soli tary confinement. The clerical papers deny that the ghost was a priest ; but, on the other hand, it is alleged that he was one of the young chaplains at tached to the palace, and a tool of the Jesuits.
