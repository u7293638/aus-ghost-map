THE DEFEAT T OF THE BERRY MINISTRY. OPINIONS OF THE COUNTRY PRESS, (FROM THE NEW AND IIWVTHORN _.\\.l'HL.H, MAHCII r) ) The election contest of the 28th February, 1880 has been fought and won by the Opposition, and one of the most remarkable features in connexion with it is the sudden disappearance of Berryism Before Saturday it was ram] ant but as the returns came in and above ed victory after victory for the Opposition it gave up the ghost without a murmur The real fact is that the time for the dissolution of the Ministry was come Tora long time there was little in common between Berryism and Liberalism and men turned from the former with eager long mg for peaceable and good government Sir Bryan O'Loghlen's defeat is perhaps one of the most satisfactory) items of Saturday 3 voting Aman of little ability and who was only taken in hand by Mr Berry) because he possessed a title, he raised and enriched him self by professed "sacrifices of which his own personal gain was alwayS the ultimate end An inexperienced and he) My petulant politician, and a blatant demagogue, he neither added dignity nor wisdom to the Senate, while his elevation to the judgeship he aimed at would have been a scandal and a disgrace However, for once, all along the line, moderation and common sense have scored a victory (1 ROM THE PRAHRAN AND ST MUJA CHROMCLE, HA ROU 5 ) The long looked for change has come-the change to which people of all classes have been looking for just and peaceable government for a cessation of the sickening flow of ill feeling and v vituperation that has too long sullied political and not left untinged even social life ; the change which it is hoped will bring back prosperity and the refreshing influences of confidence and mutual good- will between class and class The experi- ment of extreme liberalism has been tried, with all appliances and powers and funds, with crowds of supporters, with unchecked sway, and with plenty of time But what with the formidable character of the barriers raised by the opposite part), the inordinate cravings of the greed) multitude of hangers on, and their own jealousies and mistakes, the representatives of the great principle have utterly failed to accomplish any of the anticipated joys, beyond securing for them selves a three years job "The masses have therefore turned from them in disappointment, and have joined the conservative forces in lifting to the places of trust and power men of other views (FROM THE GIPPSLAND STANDARD, MARCH 4 ) Mr Berry and his party have been placed in a minority by the unmistakable vote of the people The result of the election on Saturday last may be accepted as proof positive that the people are not desirous of continu- ing the present state of things, and we may therefore venture to hope that wiser counsels will prevail in future under the new Ministry composed though it may be of old but well tried material Very few men indeed will be found denying the fact that during the reign of the Francis Kerferd Ministry) (from 10th June, 1872, to 6th August 1875 the business of the country was conducted in a statesmanlike and honest manner and that the colony was advancing in material prosperity) It will, therefore, be conceded by every) politician of moderate views that with such names as Francis, Kerferd, Vi rixon Gillies, Ramsay, Dr Madden, Jones, and MacMahon to choose from, Mr Service will have no difficulty in building up such a Cabinet He will meet with the support of the Assembly in large majority and the approval of the country at large (FROM THE GOULBURN ADVERTISER, MARCH 4 ) Vic- take this opportunity of again urging every possessor of a vote to show his appreciation of the responsibility by earnestly studying for himself the history of true liberalism in this country He will then find that all the cardinal measures of reform have originated with and been carried out, not by the clique who have now been justly expelled from office by their defrauded followers, but by the men who will now assume the reins, and who are falsely considered as representing conservative ideas In a democratic community like this the majority must rule, and upon the cool judgment of that majority the welfare of the country will depend The policy of the Berry) Ministry has been not to educate the minds of the electors by calm argument and per suasion, but to excite them into a frenzy against grievances for the most part purely imaginary) But the game is happily played out, and the people will soon discover that the solid present advantages attendant upon reputable government are infinitely preferable to the nonsensical prate about a " working man a paradise which Mr Berry promised to make of Victoria (FROM THE WOODEND ÃŽ.EVVS,M-RCII 5 ) It is now evident that the majority of the electors were utterly exasperated by the disastrous effects of the Berryism, revolution and corruption which they had long been powerless to resist, and that they waited patiently for the day of reckoning, determined then to strike such a blow for honest government and truth and justice as would shake down the rotten throne of Berryism and rid the land for ever
