NEW CALEDONIA. [BY TELEGRAPH.] (FROM OUR OWN CORRESPONDENT,) SYDNEY, WEDNESDAY. The steamer City of Melbourne, which arrived yesterday from Noumea, brings intelligence that a man named Odey, the keeper of a wine shop at Noumea, deliberately shot his wife with a revolver in a fit of jealousy, and then blew out his own brains The parties had only recently arrived from France. A bold attempt at escape was made on the 22nd July by six convicts at Isle Nou They, in broad daylight and in the presence of the guards, seized a boat which, as usual, had arrived in the early morning with rations from Noumea They dashed into the boat, throw the crew into the water, and tried to make off with the boat. The surveillance fired upon them, killed one, and wounded three of the others, one seriously This put an end to the insane attempt, for the convicts had not a ghost of a chance of succeeding in their efforts Quarantine has now ceased at Noumea Copious rains have fallen throughout New Caledonia
