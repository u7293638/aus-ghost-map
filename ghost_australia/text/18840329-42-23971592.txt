RACING NOTES. BY PEGASUS. It may not be perhaps amiss to suggest to the Q.T.C. authorities that they make arrange-[*] ments in time to secure a proper system of [?] for their Autumn Meeting. In the Sflaco it may bo conceded that it is a very ■■V if not an impossible, task for any one ■I to start a Held of horses, when the mfmth arc not particularly tractable, and VMr riders not particularly amenable to 4Mp||nc. There does not indeed seem any mpjaa why we should not follow the example «f MM V.R.C. in this matter, by having a •torts* and avsitttant starter, and a chalk line AM* by which the horses arc to range them- Wtfm fai line. In the event of any jockey i>ersisting in disregarding the oora- Smbof the starter, be should be fined, for fHt time lightly, and on a repetition of the nasmoro heavily. In this manner discipline ««■%! well be established, and horseowners lansMaot, in addition to the oilier uncertainties m BMCuig, have to look forward with fear and iMßßblinir U» the nag being lowered when one jMsjßat nearly six lengths or so in advance of ■MIINT. One, if not two, of the jockeys who Hmf at Beaudcsert deserved fining heavily, mm, m&t; only did they utterly disreganl the sjsssjflsjD(U of the starter to come back, but, Stenately, through the weakness of that U, were allowed to reap the roward of pertinacity and insubordination by scoring s>via> The employment of an assistant who ftawam the flag on a signal from the starter is sSMlhar essential element in getting the horses tjNf together; and surely when we see how a veil this s managed down south it is fcigh time that we should copy our neigh i in such an important particular. I have been informcf unofficially that the sjaatsmt of |>ayments for the Shorts Handicap. ? stated in the programme, in a mistake; ana •a. I trust it will be corrected as soon as Mamie. It will be noticed that the Shorts ■■Mtttcap, wbicb is the last rare of the rawtinj:, 4bJm thr place of thr Forced Handicap; and ffki payments, as published, are 1 soy. noraina ttaa fee, 1 \ soy. acceptance, and 1 soy. third Mfsjant, together with a sweepstakes of 2 sots., ltd makes a total of no les* than £•"> lU*. fcflfare a hone can start for tlm event. In the OtHMoiation Stakes or Forced ilandica|M, it is sjmn usual to make payments as low mv ■sjssiblc. »•> as to brin-: a large field to the post for the last evont of the meeting. Various •Mmt alterations in the programme suggest ttaaMclve*, and I am sure that if a Publicans' Pane of 100 *ovi., 1 mile, with 10s. entrance ■Ml 10i. acceptauce, could be collecteil (srkkh I think niijrht well ho Vita a little troublei, ami tho Ladies' Bracelet prises tint, i.hoihl, and third wore donated l>y aWßlbcrs of tho club and their friends, another ■Me could catily \tc inserted into each day's ■aflbsc.

It is known a« Uic '* »Jn»t trick," :ui i« work.tl a* follows: Kir«t of all. tli.ro nimt ht- two horses runuinr in the same interv-t, ono of which haa of conrno no chance of winning. The jockey of t»ic other home (with which it is intended to win> i* much under Wright, and ha* therefore to carry a belt loaded with sufficient ■hot to enable him to pass tbe ordeal of the clerk of tho wales, Going on to the course, this jockey finds an opportunity of supping hu belt and pause* it to bis comrade, and so rides the race very much under weight After passing the post, both hones run a consider able distance and in tho confusion and excite ment tho shot belt v supposed to be safely passed back again. Of course when clerks of the course and stewards are on the alert, and bring back the hones to weigh in without loss of time, the trick mutt be discovered, but the plan ia^uite feasible at country meetings, and when no one is suspecting anything of the kind. The idea, however, v a very ingenious one, and it seems a pity that the talent of the inventor should bo wasted on such an unworthy object. I am glad to hear that, stimulated by tho example of the Logan anil Albert Club, a jockey club is in course of formation at E»k. It will be named the Brisbane Kiver Jockey Club, and the promoter* have already received pro mises of substantial support from tbe statwn holdrrs in the district. I understand that it is intended to have a preliminary canter in the shape of a small meeting to be held in May. As tbe railway extension to Ksk is a matter of the immediate future, there can be no doubt that the meetings will be well patronised both by Brisbane. Ipswich, and Downs owners, if sufficient inducementM can be afforded then in the shape of fair conditions and of prize* worth winning. Mr. Jost's Respite has again taken a trip to Sydney under the care of O. Harris, to try his luck in the coming event* of the Hawksabury and A.J.C. meetings. I an in receipt of the full programme of the BlackaU Racing Club meeting to be held on Sith and 27th June. The principal event* are the Maiden Plate of 10 soys., Blackall Handi cap of 75 soys.. Steeplechase of 73 sot*., and BlackaU Racing Club Handicap of 200 soys.— entrance «>n/y 2-j #wr r»iU on the added money. The conditions of the Welter (Corinthian) Handicap are also very good. They run as follows:—" For all horses tbe homA jitU pro perty of members of any recognised race dab and to be ridden by amateur riders members of any recognised club." From our telegraphic advices I see that little wagering has been done on tbe coming events. Despot, Maroney, and Ghost are in favour for the Hawkesbury Handicap, but very little right out betting took place. For the A. J.C. St. Leger, 5 to 4 is the best offer against Martini-Henry, and ti to 4 against Le Grand. There is a disposition to back the utter at 7 to 4, while f> to 1 is forthcoming against cither Off Colour or Warwick. The following are the leading features of the Sydney Cop betting ■ —100 to 15 against Commotion; 100 to 12 against Le Grand; 100 to 8 each against Martini-Henry and Despot; 100 to 7 Off Colour. The principal scratching* for the Hawkesbury Handicap have been already announced. They arc—Daisy, The Drummer, Palarenda, Mil brodale. Raven, Torpedo. Dissy, Segenhoe, Sir Modrcd, Le Grand, Warwick, Aide- do-Camp, Old Gold. Masquerade, Hypatia, Bristol, Grosvenor, Rxeter, Wallangra, Lord Wilton, Boscawen, Drumstick, The Bean, Novice, Gladiator, Howlong, aud Ikaumont. Forty-one horses are left in for the Sydney Cup, and amongst the most prominent mal contents are Malna, Warick, Archie, Anglesey, Masquerade, Bristol, Merman, Nicholas, Hurricane, and Wallangra. "Nemo" in the .tyfww Mail, states that Warwick is said to be doing well at Warwick Farm, so there is more than a probability of his measuring strides with Martini-Henry, Le Grand, and Off Colour in the St. Leger. In the FmUml Australian "Sterling" has the following:-" Betting on the V.RC. Derby, ISM, has already commenced. On Tuesday the South Australian colt, The Broker, wa« backed to win £2000 at tens to one, a very short price indeed, considering that the race is nearly seven months off. The Broker, it will be remembered, was disposed of by auction last May, when Mr. John Crosier, jun., decided on giving up racing. The price paid was, I believe, I'JO guineas, though be cost Mr. Crosier Ift) guinea* in Sydney an a yearling. No two year-old in Victoria has made more rapid strides in learning his business, and he was appropriately named The Broker by Mr. Crozier, who, at the time he christened him, selected the name as a compliment to one of our leading turfites whose name the sire of The Broker claim* Another colt that haa been supported by a good South Australian judge is Phil Athol, by Blair Athol out of Phillina (imp.). Thu youngster was, lam in formed, bred in Kngland to Australian time and foaled here. One thousand to 100 was booked about him for the next V.R.C. Derby. and 1000 to 15 about hi* emulating his stable companion Martini-Henry* example of landing the big double. In the same stable is another colt named Tremando, by Tester (imp.) out of Agitation, and if all acconuts about him arc true, then he is verily a wonder. Followers of the Hod. Jok. White* 'table will remember bow Martini- Henry was saved till a three-year old, and the good results that followed through not hurrying him as a two-year-old. It remains now to be seen whether the .same wise counsels will prevail in reject to the two colti just mentioned. Should it do »o. we may again expect to see the |K>pular blue and white occupying a prominent position as the final struggle of the V.R.C. Derby of I*U takes plill'C.* A rather curious item of news conies to us from home, it appear^ that the (>adby Kai-c -course and Club »'oinpauy of Leicester have purchased the living of the parish of Oadby, the value of which v IT4OO a year.
