Dr. 'W.. Kùhpîe, "^rofesspr. : of Physiology, in the TJniveraity pf Heidelberg,- has been carefully reviewing and extending a . discovery .of Dr. 'Boll, \- now of ' Rome, tor.' Boll ' had found that the" external layer of the retina of the eye possesses, in life ;a beautiful purple color.., Tiié color is.' perpetually destroyed iand renewed, while tfié eye is doing work. , Dr. Krihne found that light wąs the agent.' by which the purple was destroyed ; while.. the animal is alive the color is -quickly r«- , stored by the secretive action of the neighboring tissues. The next discovery was that only certain kinds of light have the pow er of discharging the color. If kept in other ! kinds .of light, such ' for instance, a? :U obtained by' burning a mixture of .soclą , and alcohol, the purple color remains unaltered, even after death. Fiually, Dr,!, Kuhne found chemical re-agents that would fix the color. Now came the crowning experiment. He fastened a . rabbit , so that one of its eyes was for three minutes exposed to the light from ! an open window-shutter.. Then he in- . stantly decapitated the rabbit and pût the éyè in suitable pickle. Two miriutes after/, tije decapitation the other eye was simi- ; , ląrly exposed to light, and it too waę ' ' afterwards pickled. The next morning both eyes showed à sharply'defined image . " , of the • square of light, surrounded by ,a 'deep rośe-tint. The image in. thé second eye was somewliat the sharper and whiter bî the two. Professor Bunsen wàs present and witnessed this marvellous experiment. , , ; ' jObviously'. under mpre delicate treat- r mpnt'thé eye could be made to tell the stpry of fainter, impressions. The éyés of hùmàn victimsmayyet bear testimony iń, courts of; .law, when .murderers are' .pn trial. In "the case wehave,described, however, we have no doubt that Professors Kuhne and.-Bunsęn dined on the decapitated rabbit, arid that it agreed with th'em. ' We are only 01^ the threshold of à kimilar class of discoveries. Window glàss, for, instance, that has ltad : letters fastened tipon it.and hasrbeeri exposed to light for several years, is found tó have, undergone'some structural change, so . that no cleaning will wholly efface the evidence that the letters were once attached, ; Ńo matter how' thoroughly the glass may. be wiped and polished, a breath upon it brings' back the' shadowy outlines, the " ghosts ' of the letters -again. Similar, results have followed where nothing but a, shadow had rested upon' the pane.. It was.found that sunlight' changes the color of glass, just as it alters the sensitive plate in the photographer's oamera. - A little-more pf such progress may enable' us to compel the walls of old buildings to picture forth the scenes that wéré last enacted within 'them.
