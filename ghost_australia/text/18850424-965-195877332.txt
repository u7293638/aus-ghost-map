How ii BKan Acts when he Upsets an Inkstand. A man may be cool as an icicle under extraordinary circumstances of danger or excitement; he may preserve an even mind when a ghost comes into his room at midnight he may assume command and act nobly and well when the ship, is sinking; but let that man, let any man, upset his inkstand, and he springs to his feet, makesa desperate grasp for the inkstand, and knocks it halfway actoss the table, claws after hiB papers, and swoops them through the sable puddle to save them, tears hikVhite silk handkerchief from his pocket and mops up the ink with it, and after he has smeared the table, his hands, and his lavender trousersjwith ink, as far as it couldbe made to go, discovera that early in the engagement he knocked the inkstand clear off the table," and it has been draining its life-ink away all that time in the centre of the only light figure in the pattern of the carpet. Then he wonders why a man alwaj s mikes a fool of himself when he upsets a bottle of ^ink. He .doesn't know why. No body knows why. But every time it is so. If you don't believe it, try it.
