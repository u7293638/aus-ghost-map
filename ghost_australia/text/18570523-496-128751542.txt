There are some wags who say that the apparition was no other than a drunken fellow who had fallen amongst the charcoal, and consequently awoke disordered, with his face blackened ; others imagine that it possibly might have been a stray black- fellow in search of a night's lodging ; some guess it was our old friend the Yahoo, who be it remembered, first appeared in this part of the country ; others think it was the "Wandering Jew," while many speculate upon the ghost of the late Mr. Crockford, of West End notoriety ; nearly every one supposes it must have had a being, but our own and many others' opinion is, from what we hear, that it was found necessary, as in the instance of the British Bank, to wind up, and that the occasion was taken to veil the real intention in mystery—a supposi- tion which we are the more inclined to cling to from the fact of a sly and meaningful smile invariably playing upon the features of the Dramatis Personæ, whenever the reality of an apparition is talked of.
