THE PRIMACY OF THE ROMAN I PONTIFF LECTURE BY ARCHBISHOP CARR. In St Patrick's Cathedral last night Dr Carr the Archbishop of Melbourne, delivered the first of a series of three lectures entitled the Primacy of the Roman Pontiff The lectures are intended as a rejoinder to a lecture by Dr. Stacey Chapman (subsequently issued in pamphlet form in which objection was taken to the contentions of Dr Carr in a previous discourse Archbishop GAHII, in introducing his subject, said that he did not regard controversy as suited to the spirit of the season of Lent but it had been forced upon them He then proceeded - What I undertake to establish in the Catholic doctrine regarding the primacy of the Roman Pontiff Before proceeding to press it will be useful to devote this lecture to ex position and to such prefatory matter as will serve to clear the ground and allow a full view of the subject to be obtained in deal ing with the primacy of the Roman Pontiff it should not be neceSsary at the outset, to explain what every will informed student of ecclesiastical history is supposed to know, namely, that primacy is of two kinds -pruning) of honour and primacy of junadle tion Primacy of honour implies precedence in rank and dignity, but confers no real authority) or jurisdiction over others such a one is said to be present vita para, first amongst his equals Primacy of jurisdiction, on the other hand, is a prerogative which confers not only precedence in point of place and dignity, but also authority over others HUB it is needless to say, is the primary, or, as it is sometimes called, supremacy), which Catholics claim for the Roman Pontiff The authority which is involved in his prime) as an authority to teach to rule, and to correct, the limits of that authority are as wide as the Church of Christ upon earth The doctrine of the Catholic Church is clearly formulated in the decrees and canons of the Vatican Council Catholics then maintain (1) Unit St Peter was invested b) Christ with supreme authority) over his church (2) that bt Peter finally lured his See in Rome (3) that the Roman pontiffs and the successor of St. Peter in the See of Rome I know that some Protestant writers deny), or doubt that St. Peter was ever in Rome others assert that though he visited Rome, an 1 preached there he never was bishop of the See of Rome and others again that even though St. Peter held the primitive office, and was Bishop of Rome, still he had no successors in the primacy inasmuch as his primacy was temporary, and ceased with the admission of the Gentiles to the Church 1 not at present merely stated, not proving, Catholic doctrine but in regard to the first of these assertions I may remark that it is a dangerous and discreditable thing to den for controversial purposes, what involve the denial of the earliest and most important facts in the history of the Christian Church That bt Peter worked in Rome is a met Bliss Dallinger SO abundant!) proved and so deeply imbedded in the earliest christian history that whoever treats it as a legend ought in consistency) to treat the whole of the earliest church history as legends), or, at least, quite uncertain In the whole range of early church history there are few facts better authenticated or more satisfactory proved than St Peters visit to Rome, Ina l< finding the church in that city and his party room there Dr Cave, to distinguished Prutuatant writer, bears this unequivocal testimony) - "That I ever was at Rome on 1 held the see there for some time he intrepid!) airman with the whole quitting] be of the ancients We produce willie sea altogether unexceptionable and of the very richest and fruit) The Rev Dr Robertson Professor of 1 ecclesiastical History) King's College, is equally pronounced on this subject It is not so much a spirit of sound I criticism as a religious prejudice which has led some 1 rottstanU to deny that the apostle was ever at Jtotnc v here all as tent testimony) re] resents him to have suffered together with bt late in the reign of Nero Bishop Ihcott brushes aside the Protestant prejudices on this subject Nothing land Protestant prejudice he says can state 1 against the historical evidence that bt later sojourned and their in- Rome Vi hate or theological consequences i in) follow from It it is as certain that St Peter was at Home as that of John was at Ephesus Dr f gardner, an eminent Nonconformist divine thus witnesses It is not i needful to make many remarks upon this tradition Put it is easy to observe that it is the "world uncontradicted is interested testimony of an dent waters in the several parts of the world Giectvs I inns S) nans.

Days "All Uto fal hen, with great unanimity, bore asserted that startled go to Home and that he did go on that church ' To the third in statement, namely, that St. Peter had no successors in the primacy, we may oppose the testimony of eminent Protestant writers. Some of the most illustrious minds which Prim scientist has produced have full) titlmitttid the absolute need and actual existence of the Homes for the. Crowns and legibility, for example, were, as a great writer says, admittedly conspicuous among all their fellows for their great ability), their original knowledge of theology, their blameless and honourable lives, and the philosophical character of their mind, and this is the testimony of Grotius, it Inch, us it covers the Catholic position so full), 1 make no apology for quoting in such considerable length. [Dr. Carr quoted at length from vol. I, page 008.1 He then proceeded - Having stated that he had read the chief writers of ancient times as well Greek and Latin, especially Chrysostom und scheme, because they were considered happier than the rest in Abe exposition of the Holy Scripture, he is irresistibly forced to this conclusion-" I saw that these remained in that church which is bound to the Honum ' And, as we should expect, the question of the primacy of the Roman Pontiff came with special prominence before the capacious and studious number Grotius. He argues both from the testimony of history and from the necessity of things, Quoting St. Jerome to the client that " one out of the twelve (Apostles) is chosen for the very purpose that by the appointment of a head the occasion of schism may be removed, he continues "Such ft final started presbyteries The Bishop, among bishops the Metropolitan, for none other eitetcilMn another manner, to piaslilnoiit tin, rose Snell among all is the Roman bishop. This writer ought always to remain in the church, because the euiiHo always remains, that is, the danger of schism," And now I pass to the testimony of Leibnitz, of whom it is no exaggeration to say that for keenness of intellect and vast and varied learning he has probably no equal amongst Protestant writers.

Traces of the assumption that to them as successors of St 1 over belonged a paramount authority in ecclesiastical disputes His evidence is not the less valuable though, like other Protestant control essayists of far less note, he writes of what he calls the assumption' of the Roman bishops We are not to forget that he is dealing with those very ages in which, according to the generally received Protestant teaching, the faith of the Church was pure and the sanctity of the Roman Pontiff conspicuous Little as we may admire the methods of nationalistic writers, we must at least regard their admissions in favour of the Roman prime as the irresistible outcome of the facts of history The Catholic Church and she alone has consistently condemned their wholesale and de structure criticism of revealed truth, whilst Protestantin seemed satisfied if Home suffered equally with revelation Kenan and) surely he token as a typical representatives this School and there is no room for mistake in his words ' Uotno As the place in which the crest Idea of Callachor) was worked out More and moreover) as) it 1 sense the capital of Christianity and took the ) loco of Jerusalem as the religious centre of humanity) Its church claimed a precedence over all others william was generally) recognised The Bishop of Rome became the bishop of Illusions he was admonished all others Koine proclaims her rights dangerous right-of excommunicating those who do not walk step by step with her At the end of the second genuine he can aNo recognise li) »Irriistihichitishnpnsslhlo to mistake the spirit which in lb 0 mil proclaim the Infallibility of the Pope And back beyond the close of the second century, to the very dawn of uninspired Christian history and can trace the plant) of the Roman Pontiff The nearer he got to the lifetime of the Apostles is the more v valuable and authentic does the testimony) become Hence it is that Protestant writers have UBI I ever) effort and resorted to every device to depreciate the value of the early ecclesiastic ii records when the) witness to the existence of the Roman Primacy Of these the first in point of time is the letter of Pope St Clement to the Corinthians According to the most reliable authorities it was written about the year An '13 or 'lb 11 was addressed d to the Church in Corinth by the Church in Home and was intends d lo put an end to dissensions which had up on grieiotisscaiidul on all Billen It would seem that a few unruly members had driven out probably their bishop and some of his priests and the Church of Home (Rule to the rescue Though the authorship of the letter is not disputed it is set the constant effort of Protestant writers to transfer from St Cli ment to the Roman Church the claim which the letter dear!) sets forth to authoritatively interfere in the affairs of li distant church It would be fatal to Protestant theories of primitive church goers ment to allow that St Clement as Bishop of Home should assert his right to sit in july ment on the question whether the bishop and some of the priests of the Church of Corinth should be deposed, and should actually rum judgment on this matter that he should lay claim to submission and obedience on the ground that his words were the words of God, and were dictated by the Holy Ghost, that he should, after making a most solemn appeal to the three Divine persons, promise on the one hand benediction on the part of God to those who were obedient, and threaten on the other hand with the Divine displeasure those who at aimed his sentence that he should remind the Corinthians that it was better for them to be humble and approved in the sheep fold of Christ than to be in high tr> pute but cast out from His fold or forfeit the grace and promises of His Gospel, that he should teach the absolute necessity of Apostolical Suet session for a legitimate ministry), mentioning t placidly the threefold order of bishops, priests (or presb) ters), an I deacons, that he should, in turn, send his own is gates in order to secure the so quiescence of its Church of Corinth to nil! We need only read the letter to see how thoroughly the Pope St Clement, or the Roman Church, increases the primacy) of Jurisdiction, and insists on the necessary) of Apostolical Succession [Dr Carr quoted the paragraphs on the question from St. (harness Letter] He then went on - 1 Exception has been taken to the translation of the words print and fold and to the argument based on the latter word As to the use of the word priest, I consult this is a correct translation, as I believe in a Christian priesthood and if one is to credit the Book of Common Prayer, Anglicans, profess the flame belief, at least as far as the terminology is con- ruled As far as the word in Pope Clements letter goes I believe it may be indicated by) priest or presbyter alike, as in his time bishops as well as priests were included in the term presbyter As to the argument from the Lord fold it loses nothing li) substituting "hope" in its Hit ad, its in both cases the du plants are threatened with the sea tri st punishment, namely, exclusion from the ' church,' or from the " hope and promise of ("Christ In translation I followed All all and have BUCC consulted other works i In Archbishop quoted a number r of Piotontant writers on the authorities e character of Pope Clement's letter, and concluded -1 bus view ing the letter in its parts and usa in hole, and taking account of the circumstances in which it was written, with us we have already heard from the saint's own lips, he was constantly) expecting the fate of its martyrs! predecessors, and wrote with the calm dignity that belonged to one conscious of his worldwide jurisdiction, I now with even greater emphasis ask the question which I asked in a former lecture " Is it possible to have a clearer evidence of the Papal supremacy in the s cr) first century of the Church's existence' '
