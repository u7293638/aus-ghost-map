MRS. PARNELL AND CARLOW. WHY SHE STATED AWAY. The non-appearance of Mrs. O'dbea in Carlow on Sunday (says the Cork Herald., July 4) was a disappointment to thousands who were illcon Boled for the absence of the divorcee by her hus band's essay on his own merits But Mr. Parnell ?was coerced by his stalwarts on the Bcene to abandon his expressed intention of introducing her to the men and women of Carlow. 'Carry me down to Carlow— O, take me, Charlie dear, For thousands mnst be waiting Your peerles3 bride to cheer. In days when you weze powerful You loved me well, and now I'll win you back the laurels That once be-decked jour brow. 'Jjined hand in hand we'll conquer ???:.? Though myriad foes arise — The priests we'll linock to pieces, The * sweeps' we'll pulverise. O, take me down to Cailow Our subjects true to see, Attd where's the low-bred creature Will dare to scoff at me ?' . The ' Chief ' consented, smiling, . And pazed upon his bride. His noble heart was swelling With bappineFS and pride ; No ghosts of murdered peasants, No gloomy prison pen, No thoughts of ruined hompsteads Disturbed his grand soul then. Eni, rat-tat goes the knockt r Again and yvt again, Until the sounds are echoed IProui every Brighton lano ; Aal telegrams came pouring, From Carlow county fair, *O'a ! for the love of Heaven Dear Charlie, leave her there V The lady's brow grew darker, ' Twas b'ack as thunder cloud, Her acorn and hate she vented Tn accentB fierce and loud, f ut Charlie whispered softly — ' My, dear, though love is blind, Those Irish must be humoured, So you niuBt Btay behind.' And Bhe did.
