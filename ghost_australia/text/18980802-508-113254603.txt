THE 'GHOST' NUISATOJE. MELBOURNE, Monday.— The 'ghost' nuisance has reached Castlemaine. It is alleged that !a 'ghost' nightly disports itself around the Camp Reserve, and ladies and children are afraid to cross the reserve at night. The 'ghost' evi dently uses stilts, as it towers something I|Ke 7ft high. A number of young men from 'the fire brigade were out on Friday night looking for tfte 'apparition,' and were prepared to give it a great . T*v»«mHrm Tinrt fhev oome across it. The descrip tion o£ this 'ghost' tallies with 'Spring- heel Jack,' the supposed apparition who paraded outlying suburbs of Melbourne some years ago, frightening women . ' and children, a couple «-f the cases . termin ating fatally. 'Springheel Jack' was so-called ^on account of his high jumping feats, having on sev* ral occasions cleared the high galvanised Iron fence surrounding the Caulfield Racecourse. Every effort was made by the police to capture the-sttg-. rcsed 'ghost,' but were unavailing. He. was dressed in 'tights,' covered with phospabrujB, and wore a long robe, which he threw open,: dis playing his figure of 'dazzling light' to » -women and young children. Quite a scare was created for some time, but 'Jack' disappeared as' sud denly as he came. . , ~
