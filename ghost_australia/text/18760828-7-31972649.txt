MANOORA, AUGUST 24. For the past fortnight we have had very fine weather, but too dry; since last night, how- ever, we have had some fine rain, which it is to be hoped will continue. Feed is very scarce, and the dairy cattle of the farmers look uncommonly poor. Chaffcutting for the North is still going on briskly, and few haystacks are left.â€” A ghost story is haunting the district. A young farmer riding home late the other night, his horse shied at something, and he thought he saw a black object lying on the ground. He pushed his horse on, when some half mile beyond he believed he saw the same dark ob ject before him again. This upset him entirely, and he rode on at a furious rate till he came to the house of a farmer of his acquaintance, where he dropped fainting from his horse, and had to be put to bed. He did not rally for a day or two. Since this story has got wind several other persons have suffered under similar delusions.
