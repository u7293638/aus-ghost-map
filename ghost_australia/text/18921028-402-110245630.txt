THE JAPANESE M.P. Japan has borrowed Parliamentary institutions, amongst other luxuries, from the West ; and, since human nature under all skins is pretty much the same, the Japanese M.P. quickly develops all the familiar vices of the M.P. under other skies. He "wobbles" and "dodges ;" he " sits on a fence ;" he joins with his fellow legislators in " log-rolling" perfor- mances on the largest scale ; and having once secured his seat, he calmly ignores his constituents until the next election is in sight. But Japanese constituents deal faithfully with their guilty representatives According to Mr Rudyard Kipling, "a Radical Member of Parliament at Tokio has just got into trouble with his constituents, and they have sent him a priceless letter of reproof. Among other things, they point out that a politician should not be ' a waterweed, which wobbles hither and thither according to the mo- tion of the stream.' Nor should he ' like a ghost without legs, drift along before the mud.' ' Your conduct,' they say, ' has been that of both a water weed and a ghost, and we purpose in a little time to give you proof of our true Japanese spirit.' " This particular member of Parliament, Mr Rudyard Kipling reports, " will very probably be mobbed in his 'rickshaw and prodded to inconvenience with sword- sticks ; for the constituencies are most enlightened. But how in the world can a man under these skies behave ex- cept as a waterweed and a ghost : It is in the air—the wobble and the legless drift." Climate does, no doubt, affect virtue, in a most surprising manner ; but have we not amongst ourselves honorable members who resemble "drifting water- weeds" and "legless ghosts," even without the poor excuse of the enervating Japanese climate ? It is in the air, even in this colony—" the wobble and the leg less drift"—and who alas ! can invent a cure for it ? These Tokio radicals, how- ever, have at least enriched the political vocabulary by one or two delicious phrases.
