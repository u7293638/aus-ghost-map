Sports in the metropolis are Sp'SiMl'^ so3ie"ti'ea diVid'e them,""the consequence being small prizes, which result in poor exhibitions. Were the societies to amalgamate on such occasions, and offer large prists, the outcome would be very different. Sir Redmond Barry, that pattern of deportment, after escaping comparatively unhurt ' when his "train was upset by a whirlwind in Queensland* has sustained severe injury at home. The sagacious judge was driving iu from his farm near Mulgrave, wheu the horse became unmanageable, and, breaking the breeching,, upset the vehicle in at gully. His Slonor'^ arm was fractured at the elbow joint, and lie remained where he fell for some time, until a good Samaritau came b'y and brought him into the city. He is getting round linely, as a hale, hearty, ; healthy .gentleman always does, and he will spoil be out again gladdening the heart of Collins street with his representation of a gent of the olden time. Judg< Fellows takes the seat of honor while Sir Redmond is unwell- We have had two small fires. One took place in Smith street, Collingwood, T. W. Young's 1 grocery slio'p being completely gutted, avid Reed's' fari'cy shop damaged. Young's stock vas insured for £500, aud the building for £150. Two' wooden four-roomed buildings in Graham streWt; Sa'ndridge, -lavo been burnt -down ; they were insured for £100. The origin of these fires is uot knowL. A big rowiug event is to take,plac,e' on the Yarra next Saturday, L'. W. Bell, the champion of the colony, m'eeti'ng Detecitive Christie to contest a trophy of i'507 Christie has long been known as a " dark" horse' iti the rowing line, and the contest" nihi'st be highly interesting. The public mind was excited strongly over the unhappy railway accident at Benalla',' aud the closing incident was as painful ai even the casualty. Owing to gross mismanagement, the l^ody of the unfortunate man Thomas Donoghue, who died on Thursday last, remained in the hospital until Monday (live days) waiting an inquest, when no inquest was required. The weather was insufferably warm, and the hospital authorities were put to great straits. Our mayor, Mr. Gatehouse, outdoes Mr. Butters in his hospitality. He does make the champagne flow. He seizes on every opportunity to give champagne luncheons. To-day he entertained the members of the German transit of Venus observation expedition, which chose the Auckland Islands as their locate. The mayor can't talk German, • but his guests could appreciate his Moet and Chandon, so everything went merrily. The Commissioner of Customs, Mr. I Edward Cohen, is in very bad health at ' present, suffering from a complication of maladies. He'was very bad on Monday, I but was sufficiently recovered on Tuesday to take a drive. It is probable he will resign j as soon as the great building in Collins- | street, when he is to resu me his old occupation of auctioneer, is completely renovated, but I question if the lion, gentleman will have a long lease of this life. ' Poor Biddle, 1 ori6 ; 'of J the warmest supporters of cricket, is dead. Who that has attended our great cricket matches, particularly the All England Eleven contests, hut remembers him, a line portly gentleman, with a rosy English face, beaming with good humour. Mr. Biddle was over 20 years ago a member of the-firm of White; Brothers and _ . j - •, io. l c , : Co., wine and spirit merchants, now defunct., i Dattejrly, he :m?et;with/very heavy reverses in mining and speculating, "aiid had to seek the Insolveucy Court.
