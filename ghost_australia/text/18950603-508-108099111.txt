ST. MARY'S CATHEDRAL. Oa Sund »y morning the Rav. Prior Vaughan preached to a large congregation at Sti Mary's Cathedral, lie enose lor his text a verse of the hymn ot the H-oly Ghost, and in the course of his sermon said that there was noihing of more im portance than tQe gift of Divine grace. Hence it was that the Holy Father had hiit 'he other day sent a letter to the Brit sh people calling upon them to opeu their eyes to the claim of the Catholic Church, and exhorted them to the reunion of Christendom. But what he placed at the base of all — whai h« rested the greatest hopes on— was the power of prayer. By prayer they obtained God's grace, 'and without grace they could not be saved and brought into the one fold.
