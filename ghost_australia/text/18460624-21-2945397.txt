LOCAL. Civil Sittings.-The present sittings of the Supreme Court, for the trial of civil actions, has occupied a greater length of timo than any on record. One case, " Pearson v. Young," on a replevin bond, has, from the protracted nature of the proceedings, been made a remanet, and cannot, conse- quently, be tried until the sittings after next term. By the Jury Act of this island the judge must discharge the jury after their attendance for one week, and on Saturday they were dis- charged accordingly. The case of " Macdonald, assignee, v. Maddock and another" was then proceeding, and occupied the whole of Monday and yesterday. The verdict was for the plaintiff-damages Â£3000. Quarter Sessions.-The jurors who were summoned for the 6th April last to attend the Session for three months, will not be required again, as a fresh jury is summoned for the General Quarter Session, which will be held on Monday, the 6th July next. Norfolk Island.-Francis Burgess, Esq, P. M., has been appointed Judge at Norfolk Island, and K. Knight, Esq., that of Crown Prosecutor. Mechanics' Institute.-It will not be uninteresting to our juvenile readers to remind them that Professor Rennie announced, at the close of his last lecture, his intention to take up the subject of ghosts, spectres, and apparitions. Concert.-We draw the attention of the lovers of music to Mr. Ravac's concert at the Mechanics' Institute, on Thursday evening. Rev. W. JARRETT.-In the Courier of Saturday, in the South Australian intelligence, gathered from the Adelaide papers, it was staled that the Rev. W. Jarrett, of New Town, was expected there. We are informed thal an invitation to a pastoral charge was received by him, but not acceded to, and, therefore, the expectation of his arrival there is without foundation. English Intelligence.-We have been compelled to omit the summary prepared from our late English papers until our next number.
