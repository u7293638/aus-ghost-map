CURRENT LITERATURE. The L'A of the Right Hon. W E Forster, by T Wemyss Reid (Chapman and Hall), missed being a good biography through causes which he on the surface, although it is a little odd that the biographer himself seems act only to be aware of them. The last years of Mr. 1 orator a life, during which, in the opinion of many, he did and suffered the principal things which entitle him to an honourable place among English politicians, are precisely those which could hardly be properly treated of in these volumes. In the first place, Mr Wemyss Reid, with all his literary abilities and his genuine love and respect for the subject of his book, is scarcely the man to write a full and candid account of those strange and momentous transactions in which Mr Forster took so conspicuous a part. As until very lately the editor of the newspaper (the Leeds Me during), which enjoys the distinction of being the most thorough going partisan of the Home Rule interest, and which has been more than one singled out as the recipient of the confidences of the Gladstone family father, mother, and son-the public will hardly believe that Mr Wemyss Reid is to be trusted when he speaks of the curious and complicated intrigues which led to Mr Forster's resignation of office in 1883 with the secret history (never yet told) of the Kilmainham Treaty, and the release of Mr Parnell by Mr Gladstone the first step, as known live, in that new departure which has rent in twain the Liberal party Mr Reid, doubtless is a man of great sincerity and of final judgment, but his relations to the two men between whom he has to decide have been, if they are not now, so intimate that it is impossible for him, it be still retains any loyalty to his old chief, to be entirely just to Mr Forster Again, the time has not yet arrived when the story can be fully told of that mysterious passage in modem English politics the enforced retirement of Mr Forster so quickly followed by the tr "'i ly in the Phone- park, the sudden return of the Gladstone Government to a coercive policy, and the equally sudden conversion, two years after, to Home Rule We cannot believe that this book is accepted by Mr Forster's own friends as a sufficient vindication of his character It is a little remark. able that it ann i ra without" any ore face explaining according to the usual practice, the circumstances under which the work was composed, and the authority which has been stated in the biographer Mr Wemyss held appears, indeed to have had access to some family papers, but he v far he represent the views of those who have the best right to call themselves his political executors we are not told Would it be too curious for instance, to inquire what Mr Arnold Forster, the nephew and adopted son of the deceased statesman, thinks about the latter part of Mr Reid's book-that which I della with the Irish business' It is no secret in political circles that Mr Forster himself, before his death, was in the habit of venting very freely his opinion of his colleagues, and of inveighing bitterly against those who had trafficked with crime and treason for their own political ends Not a third of all this appears in Mr Reid's book The biographer preserves, indeed, a most con seen alive reticence in respect to this portion of Mr Forster's life While not attempting to conceal the fact that Mr Forster was deeply mortified and angered at what he considered to be his betrayal to the Irish part), the narrative is so cautiously worded and so artfully toned down that not many people reading, if they were not tolerably well acquainted area ly with this strange episode of Liberal Government, would suppose that what happened was any thing much more than the ordinary quarrels amongst members of a party The truth was that Mr. Forester s severance from the Glad stone policy and following was complete and final after May 1882 If anything had been wanting to fill up the cup of his anger at his treatment by his colleagues, it was the last attempt to pass off a garbled version of Mr Parnell a famous letter in the House of Commons that letter which assured Mr Gladstone of the support of the Parnellites to his policy on certain conditions The suppression of this clause when the letter was read out in the House was a device equally stupid and dishonourable, for Mr Parnell s stipulation was certain to come out sooner or later and no good could be achieved by hiding it unless it was the in tention of the Government to distort Mr Forster a act in resigning to his disadvantage The subject is a great deal too large and too much invested with bitter memories to be dealt with here. It is enough to say that Mr Reid writes such an account as carefully to cover over all the scandal which it caused or is likely to cause, to the Liberal party, Saying nothing but what is pleasant both of Mr Forster and of Mr Gladstone This is really the most remarkable literary feat which he has achieved in these two large volumes Apart from politics they are very good reading Born a Quaker, the descendant of along line of Quakers, Mr Forster remained paten himself gradually-as most Quakers of independent character have done and do from the trammels of the sect. Though ungainly in person and rough in manners, he was a man of refined nature, fond of social intercourse and popular in his club In his early years he became acquainted with the Carlyles, and his letters about them and his other literary friends are among the most pleasant pages in Mr Reid's book which is disfigured by some serious misprints and ill spelling Bmglir hill and Other Pieces, by V Anstey (Bradbury, Agnew, an I Co ), will be remembered by readers of Punch, of which not too comic periodical the pieces have been among the most popular attractions of late years. Mr Anstey's talent for humorous verse in which he is quite equal, in our opinion, to Mr Gilbert or Mr Bret Harte, will be a surprise to those who have not suspected all his resources, the "pieces' are declared to be written for the use of the young reciter, and doubtless they are very well adapted to serve that purpose But there is, perhaps, too much of the comic introduction with the hints for the management of the voice " Burglar Bill, ' which gives the name to the little volume, in the best of the process, and is intensely funny, with a distinct trace of pathos, 'The burglar is described as engaged in his occupation upon the second landing, while " down Titlow s a dinner party." He is interrupted by the apparition of a white-robed little figure, descending by the bannister, to sit on the stairs "till the tarts and jellies come Burglar Bill wishes he had selected some more seasonable time, but in reply to his hoarse injunction to go away and leave him to earn his bread, is entreated by the little girl to help her to break in her doll's house door, which refuses to open " Of the little anual flattery But the burglar wipes his brow He is wholly) unaccustomed To a kindly greeting now " All forgot en now the Jewels Once the i purpose of als Job Down he sinks upon the doormat, With a deep and choking sob The doll's house is produced by the little girl, and with centre bit and jemmy the burglar plies his trade - ' Sen or has he I anglers better, As he feels with honest pride in He is rewarded with a start and a kiss.

It is smartly and agreeably written with more dialogue than incident, without sensation, though there is a ghost in li, In fact a very palpable novel of the ordinary kind, capable of supplying what ordinary novel readers want. The Marland A 'Jack of Anglo Indian Life (Simpson Low and Co is not good enough to be interesting to any but Anglo Indians who need a very peculiar sort of literary ailment, and are but seldom favoured by such writing as that of the author of the Czar omelet of Diutui ore. A find to the Spirit, by Gertrude Warden (J W Arrowsmith, Bristol, is one of the sort called ' assailing thrillers,' nor the worst of the sort. It is a story of crime and murder, of an Italian, good looking, but of a low in effectual order, with a silky dark looks each and a heavy Bensual mouth, and, in fact, precisely such a villain as one expects to find in a shilling novel.
