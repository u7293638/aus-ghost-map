He had learned I much regarding the mission work of which Mr I lines was BO built an ornament and had learned of the terrible trials the missionaries of the South Seas had gone through There was not one of those missionaries who did not deceive the Victoria Cross as much as any one who had won it in the heated battle (Cheers ) Their work was one of perpetual sell sa< rice If he had now any sons to bring up, he would teach them to respect these missionaries and to understand what they went through How had they gained their immense v victories over the natives ' By first conquering of mischief, by showing the natives their habits of life, and teaching them to follow that life 'those in authority who went to raise the British flag in New Guinea had said it would have been impossible for them to do any thing without the missionaries (Cheers ) 1 li" pioneer missionaries had aided the naval authorities to establish in due form and miles the natives understand the British protectorate (Cheers) Mr Lawes the great Christi m preacher and missionary, if only for that one service deserved warm approbation a lien New Guinea came to be occupied by persons of the white race it was his earnest prayer that the speculators and land (rubbers, and land robbers, and scoundrels who had done so much has man these ECOS might not be allowed to settle there and hveainon"st the natives until the country was ripe to receive them and the risk of their encouraging bad habits was reduced to a minimum (Cheers ) the resolution was carried with acclama- tion Mr J E MAM» said it had been his intention to give a detailed account of his journey toNewGuineaon the occasion of the hoisting of the British flag there by Commodore 1 skin, but the arrival of Mr Lawes had induced him to alter his determination He read an interesting account of the voyage to New Guinea and the ceremonies performed by the commodore, including some other particulars relative to the cruise of the British men of war on that occasion, and the habits of the natives of the island, in one native school that he visited the children showed great quickness and intelligence, and in one place some of the natives, as be mentioned with much humour, picked his pockets with adroitness He testified to the great good produced by the missionaries amongst the natives, and to the tact and ability with which the commodore discharged his duties. he Rev W G LAWES, who was received standing and with loud applause, said I feel somewhat embarrassed in attempting to address this large ns>>cintilv tonight I have been so long in the backwoods of civilisation and speaking a strange tongue that I cannot readily command the terse and vigorous 1 relish with which I should like to do honour to my subject Then the subject 13 so large and indefinite and so much has been written and said about it that one is perplexed to know what to say and what to June unsaid I am not here to night as a traveller explorer naturalist or merchant but as a Christian missionary It is as a Christian minister that I shall speak to night hoping to be able to throw some light on the country and people from a missionary standpoint to the Rev. A. M. Murrin bel mgs the honour of founding the mission at Port Moresby as it had been many years before in the New Hebrides and New Caledonia In 1873 Mr Murray placed Some Raratongan teachers at Port Moresby, and in November, 1871 Mrs Lawes and I aimed there We arrived on a Saturday afternoon We went ashore the next day and selected the site for a house and before the next sunday were living in it. It was a hungry time at Port Moresby when we aim at It was difficult to understand what the. people lived on They would hang about for hours in the hope of a biscuit or a little rice The people were miserably poor, and the products of the country very few the people were suspicious, they ish, and trouble some Some plots were formed to kill us and annex our goods but through the protecting care of our God no harm befel us. We were accused of causing epidemics raising ghosts and robbing gardens (1 laugh ter) there was no law, government or order and policemen and magistrates were alike mil nown A ice was not disgraceful V thief was not ashamed of his stead ing, and men gloried and hoisted of murders that would have filled all this colony with horror and inclination to mention can be made of mission work in New Guinea without honour being paid to the South Sea Island teachers who have been in New Guinea the pioneers of civilisa- tion as well as Christianity (Applause) We have 28 of these from Tahiti, Raratonga, Samoa and Sure Islands (Applause) They occupy stations extending from Motu note in the west to the extreme eastern point of the island they have smoothed the way for white men in New Guinea and were of great service during the commodores mission in translating and explaining the proclamation (Applause ) They have a chair upon the sympathy, and help of all white men (Cheers ) Our entire mission staff in the eastern brunell consists of two European and 28 South Sea Island missionaries and I am glad now to be able to add to that number nine ordained New Guinea's who have just gone out as teachers of their countries The entire cost of this still is six at £2 000 a jury in re is a great misconception of missionary work and consequently of the 1 state of influence brought to bear on the people of a place his New Guinea Need I say we do not wear black coats nor yet preach long sermons We have not tried to teach any system of theology but be he ing the oil launch sent, as bringing goo

from what they see of it in the life than from what they hear about in sermons We have to give them object lessons in Christianity and show them what honesty truth, purity and righteousness are in the life and conduct ( Applause ) The schools are our greatest hope for the future enlightenment of New Guinea, there is however, very little desire for knowledge and the idea that by coming to school they are conferring a favour on us is still the common one If there was a school board in New Guinea they would have to pay the children for their attendance (laughter) They are fond of singing and Bing some 1 English tunes fairly well among others 'God Save the Queen -(ap plane) and the Marseillaise are (great favourites Need I say all our teaching his to be done in the native land as they have

our most bitter opponents Loud applause ) Oh the tongue is of some of the women at Port Moresby when we last went then (I matter) They believe in Home Rule in New Guinea and purchase it very vigor

at peace with all men Loud applause ) Dunn" that time much foundation of work has been done the value of which will be known in days to come I am carrying the four gospels through the press in the

laugh ) One of these auld His mission had done nothing to improve the condition of the people Another veteran of the pen of whose visit we have very pleasant recollections gave us some honest and kindly criticism He thought the gospel of maize lion d have been better than the gospel of Mattin iv and thatasinihiit, harvest of lillian corn would have been a greater good than passages of Scripture But in critic did not know that when we landed at Port Moresby in 1871 we found some maize growing in front of the teachers house (Applause) It was the first thing they did introduced and since then we have introduced melons pumpkins the papaw apple manioc tile pineapple and sweet potatoes Some oranges and lemons planted by Sir V, m M Hcnj at Yule Island are now buring and we have

and in doing it he has won the confidence uni este m of the people (Cheers ) His name will be remembered and cherished by this generation on New Guinea just as his uncle Captain (now Admiral) I rsl one of the Havannah is remembered in many of the South Sea Islands The work of proclaiming the protectorate has been done, and it has been well done It has been done in a Christian spirit for after

has braved the battle and the breeze for so many years has the class for its basis I am glad to testify that the honour of the flag was maintained by all the men of the s matron, and although so many men were constantly on shore I did not hear a single complaint against a marine or blue jacket The Nelson is not generally classed with missionary ships and yet she has been a practical teacher of justice righteousness and peace and these are a part of the Gospel we want to teach II he natives had never seen such a fleet of war canoes as the squadron and that these should leave without injuring anyone has been a grand moral teaching they have seen what power 1 noland has, and know that the commodore could have done any thing and yet injured no one and did not take so much as a banner without paying for it. The steam hammer that could crush granite has not cracked a cocoanut the natives see and wonder, but understand this. The protectorate has secured to the British nation the southern shores with the fine (cries of harbours which he along the coast I confess I should have been glad to have seen the union jack on both sides of the island (loud and prolonged applause) but the Imperial Government evidently means in the responsibility she assumes to discharge salts fully the duties it involves, and may well But ink from assuming a protectorate over unknown tubes in unknown territory And, after all, the German flag is a guarantee for law and order and justice It is only among barbarous tribes such as those on New Guinea and New Britain that we expect the suspicion which looks upon a foreign power as a hostile one (Applause) The natives of theprotcctomted district do understand the meaning of it, although they cannot comprehend it in all its bearings I trust the future development of the protectorate will be in harmony with its inauguration, and that it will become what Commodore Erskine was so anxious to make it, a protectorate of the people And the protection of native rights is not antagonistic to British interests 'The resources of the country will be best de v eloped through the natives, and not be riding roughshod over them 'that protection was needed the case of the Hopeful labour vessel amply) proves If the voice of mercy pleading for the lives of the condemned men be heard I hope there will be no lower together public mind of the SCIIBO of the greatness of their crime (Applause.)
