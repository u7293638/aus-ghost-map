But perhaps the most remarkable death from fear was that of the Dutch painter Pentman, who lived in the seventeenth century. One day lie went into a room full of anatomical subjects to sketch souie death's-heads and skeletons for a picture he in traded to paint. The weather was very sultry, and while sketching he fell, asleep; He was aroused by bones dancing around him. land the skeletons suspended from the ceiling clashed together. In a fit of horror he threw himself out of the window, and, though he. sustained no serious injury and was informed that a slight earthquake had caused the commotion among his ghastly surroundings, he died a few days after of nervous tremor. I could cite many other cases where, the shock to the nenous system which, we know as fright has produced death.'
