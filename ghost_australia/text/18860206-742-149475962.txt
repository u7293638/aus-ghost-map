THE Ai) VENTURES 'i v.l; . BRUCE FAMILY. Bv Mrs E. StuartMurphy. t y * \ ? 7 ~ - r r |fr- So, £ . *, ^ *' ^ i*. ? j PART T. — Chapter III. ( Continued ,) The climate of Scotland 13 so very invigorating that -one can walk almost for „ ever without feeling tired. If the ' Wan dering Jew' had been in Scotland he would W have tared to rest so much as lie did. In their autumnal walks they would come serosa ; the/ .lovely purple heather on the hillsides, for which Scot land is famous, i In the autiimn Mr Bruoe generally invited down a number of aportsmeniiiaiends of hia, to shoot iii his TTrt ittod o rrroof annrfaman piOSQJLVCO. ixc now » ahd- they would- bring home bags full of grouse and the lovely - golden pheasants. These gentlemen were invariably accom panied' by their wives, and then the castle, would be very gay. - But one autumn the castle J;rw£s full to : overflowing, so the Brupp8 did notknow where to put one par; ticular young gentleman (he was a bach el- ir), unless be . f?ps ; put into the haunted chamber, ; wiich .had never been used yet, foij. jtlie servants, who firmly believed in the legend, would not go near it, but this timp ltj 'l^a^to he used, for there was not j another room .available. Mr and Mrs Bruce . safd nothing 'whatsoever to him about the legend, for not believing in it themselves they did not think it wortf^ while mentioning t-he subject to him, ana fhiH being his firstvisit to 'Scotland it was not I likelyt ihetihe could have heard ' v /The -next morninghe did not appear until yery.la^e.- .ThelBcuces thought nothing of it,- thinking he was tiQ0d;with l).i8 long journey ;but when he did i.make .hip lappearance, his face was ghastly white- and he : kept ;hia handker chief to his mouth. .alL the time he was apologisingfor his tardy appearance. The Bruces did not like to question him, for /ihe jjBeemed to- avoid' the subject ; he only said that he had met with a bad accident in; the night which would necessitate his immediate return to London.; ; The Bruces -expressed ; great i regret a,t the abrupt termination of his yisfo and hoped he would ? return ere long. Every spring the Bruces went up to London for the season. They had. a fine mansion in Bryanstone Square, and another , in , Portman Square, then the most fashionable parts of London, but far from beingso now. They had their box; at the Opera House, Covent Gardens, when those famous singers, Jenny Lind, the Sw-ediah nightingale, as she was called, and Grrisi land Alboni were in their glory. They-alwaya attended the Queen's T)raw irig-nion& ^sed iCoutt' * balls; etc. * - Mrs ' Brace was a splendid horsewoman, the more spirited the horse the better she liked it. The two eldest girls had a beautiful little Shetland pony given to them by ia friend of their father's ; they had christened it Jessie. It's coat shone, like black satin ; there was not a white , hair in' it, a long flowing mane, and a tail; that -almost swept the ground. Oiie. day Mris Bruce was: riding : with one1 of her little girls on this lovely 'little pony, in Rotten Row, then, as well as aaiWj H the most fashionable;. ' Tide and drive in London, when the 'Queen stopped her carriage and went to inquire whether that pony was for sale, of course, Mrs Brucere turned the ahBwer it was riot,' Baying it was a gift to the children! a#d their especial peit. The Queen seemed greatly disappointed, as she wanted it for- her own children Abbut this, time they met , Mr Rowden, . , the gentlen^tf .who , had. ' left the castle 0ot abrup'tly'in^he autumn so he told them all about,ihat feventful night aB it proved to him. 'KHe'said that after he had got into bedsit Was close !upon midnight, a4d; directiy ithe dock struck the 'hour, he heard, mostunmistakably, somebody walking in .hisfroomj «ndr he- said it must have been a woman, ' for he heard the rufefclihgT ojf cthe garments distinctly'; and then he started and looked in the direc tion of the sound,' and by the aid of the nightlamp he saw - a lady, the fa c simile ot fchei picture, which he had noiicedJjafacege ttiog into bed.- - -She-was sfcauding. at the foot of the bed, holding ijp her fqr^firiger, from, which blood was a'-owly. dropping., He jumped out of bed, doing so struck his mouth against one of the posts of the bed at the -head : (it was a four-posteT), and knocked out two jaf -his front teeth. ^ When he looked again, the' lady was gone; At the last stroke of the clock she had vanished— where !to, he c'puld not imagine, for he e^axcfied the ; ;room, h^t could find no ^ca^/of .iany one.; his. door : was; locked just as he had left it. He -went back to bed, but not to sleep. Somnus, the god ofJ!sleepj had fled far 'from him ;! aha, bS^ides, the pain and annoyance of losing h&'.^out. teeth ; and, also being , a very bashful young man, he did not like the idea of a lady -standing and staring at him like thftt; ' ;He could not draw the cur- ; fttfos, likfc ''I®-1 RclS^ick -did, when the Iadj^eiitered ihe room which he had . iuistaken , for his own, for -- this lady tctok up her station at the foot of his 1 : bedii ' i He - said he felt his hair i^sjog pn^ ^hel( tpp of rhis head, as.if each distinct t^air was a ^ red hot thorn, if one could' possibly imagine such a thing. He was not affaidv; oh, no; lie. was simply 44 mystified. ' What bothered him most of all.was the joss of hisiwo front teeth ; how on earth could he appear before his hostess and all the Other ladies in' the morning minus .those tpvp fronti teeth:; ;so he ina-le.up his mind to return to London, so tliat the deutist could insert two false teeth at once. The Bruces . told him he must have dreamt it all, and jumped out of bed in ' his sleep ; at which he was highly indignant, and said that he was as wide ajwake then as at that moment. He vowed hie would never fcleep agaip in that room, nor; would 'he ever reiurn to the castlgj 'although repeatedly inv^e^. !ix) jdo so, but would decline laughingly, saying that he ba3 'hiid1' quTfe enotigb of Mrs Ghostest, fprt-ehe had, done him enough jniscmCT-TO'H^t ht^'-hS lifei and^he did hot care for a more\ injhpSte acquaintance With her, as the next time she might carry him-!off'bb5iily^v-'7'' ! ??'?- !

They all felt very vt ry pad} at leaving their dear old land, but after a while they calmed down and began to look about them and examine their fell6w-passong£-rs, as everyone does, more br leBB, on board ship. Mr Brace heard there were some Tasmanian gentlemen on jsoafd, so he cultivated their acquaintance ps rpuch as possible in order to obtain as inuch information as he could about this polony before arriving. They had the gi^od sense not to enlarge too much on its beauties, jbut gave hiui some valuable in formation so kindly and cheerfully, that Mr Bruce was . very, favorably impressed with the 'inhabitants of Tasmania. These gentlemen told the boys that they would see,, .cherries , growing with the Btones out side the fruit instead of inside, which, of bourse, the boys would not believe, tod told them not ' to play such tricks upon travellers* thinking that they were only chaffing them, being greenhorns, but they found out the truth very soon after wards, and were considerably surprised. They also told them that the Tasmanian jtrces shed their bark instead of their leaves, all of which none of them believed at the time, but were too polite to say so. The children's governess was accom panying the family .also. . She had been with them ever since their arrival in Eng land, and was a most estimable lady, very highly accomplished^ and a splendid musician. *. Mr Bruce was bringing out two sturdy Scotch farmers and their families, of almost grofrn-up boys and girls. They thought they would try their luck in the new country where the master was igoing t6. They were former tenants of Mr Bruce's. So they were indeed a numerous .party, besides the twa Scotch lassies, Mrs [Bruce's servants. They would form quite a small settlement of themselves, every one said -on board. They were bringing out all the furniture that would be requisite for their new house when it I would be built, and the girls' piano. They were all very musical and the young people's voices had been highly cultivated by the best masters in. jLondon. They had had a very delightful passage, and the captain very gallantly affirmed that it was owing to so many lovely ladies being on board ; for they had never ,had such fine, weather before ;nor were ever so free from sickness or [accidents during the long sea voyages. Before starting from England Mr Bruce had written to -his friend,! Mr Dalrymple, out here, asking hkn u he could possibly meet them on the arrival of the vessel, which he had fully in tended doing. He. engaged rooms for them at one of the best hotels, and when they arrived took all the trouble off Mr Bruce's hands. It was very tripe, indeed, for the Bruce's, on arriving at a strange place and in a strange country, to meet with such a dear and kind old , friend ; it did £iot seem quite:-: so strange and forlorn to them. Although they had been partly prepared beforehand, .yet everything seemed bo new and' curious to them, as was only natural. After a week'e rest Mr Bruce thought it high time to go and have a look at his land and. commence work. So he took his three strong sons with him, leaving the delicate ohe to look after his mother and sisters. a& he was afraid of his being knocked-up by the hard bush life. He also took the ! two sturdy Scotchmen, and proceeded to inspect his land; which was situated in the north-weBtern part of the colony. Great ^as their dismay when they- first came in sight of it, for Mr Dalrymple had never thought for a moment of preparing them fpr nothing but bush all .around. Mr Bruce was thunderstruck : he thought it would be the same as in England or Scotland, juBt buy the land and build ; but it was something rather different at present he found.. But he was not a man to be dis heartened. * He was a man of lew words, but plenty of action ; so he knew that he would have to make the best of it now, as the die was cast. With the help of his invaluable friend he set to work to get as many experienced hands as he could, so as to get the work done quicker, and bush fires and big trees toppling down every now and again, were the order of the day. The two Scbtchmen Btood aghast at such, a terrible waste of good firewood. They would stand and rub their heads, and exclaim, '* Eh 1 mon, wha' wad we hae' gien for a' this foine Wood in the ould countrie.' But they set to wotk'with a will, all of them; and having arrived at the end of the winter, Mr Bruce had a good prospect before him for a long time to get rid of all the 8crub} etc. Night and day the fires were kept Riming; they took it by relays to look aftqr these immense fires. As, to the boys, they were in- ecstasies. It seemed like, a #torry -ntt of one of their books of $dvei}tures ; they were never tired of dragging the tree ferns, logs, etc., to make up the 14 bon- fires,' as they called them, and then at night they would get one of the men to go with them to hunt the opossum. After some time they could wield the 'mighty axe ' almost like a bushman. They went to work con amove. Having been brought up in such a cold climate as Scotland, it had made them strong and hardy, besides all the oatmeal porridge, and milk which they had imbibed from childhood ; and being just ? fresh from a long sea voyage, they felt as strong and as -eager for work i as three young giants. Oatmeal is such a splendid thing for strengthening the sinews and muscles, all; of, .which w^ere wanted for the boah life, which 'our boys' were going to lead for the future. Mr Brijce did not stay in the bush all jthe i time, bijt went backwards and forwards to and from the town. When he told Mrs Bruce all about the clearing of the ground, burning of the scrub, cutting down the giants of the forest, etc., she thought he was joking at first, till he told her he was in suber earnest ; then she was indeed surprised — it seemed so extraordinary altogether. But Bhe was in no hurry to leave the town, for they had made some nice, agreeable friends there. The Tas manian gentleman that tbey had met with onboard ship, had introduced them to other friends of theirs, so they were becoming quite gay and happy, and particularly charmed with the sociableness and genuine kindness of the Tasmanians. They said it was something like the Indian life, for there were no end of picnics, etc., to show them all the beauties of the colony. They were indeed charmed with the magnificent tree ferns, which they' had never seen in their lives before. What with sight-seeing, riding, driving, and picnics, the time soon slipped away, and they were quite as much charmed with their life as the boys were with theirs, so everyone was satis fied. Mr Bruce having plenty of money the work of clearing went on like wildfire, as there were so many hands at work. In six months they had cleared sevierat acres, and some mien were engaged in building a fine substantial house. Mr Bruce wanted the estate to look as much as possible like one of their smaller oneB at Home before the ladies of his party jcame up to it. At the end of two years one would hardly have recognised the place. There was a grand looking man s ion, and several smaller houses at some distance for the Scotch families. A fine lawn in front of the house with English grass laid down, a flower garden, which the boys took the greatest delight in culti vating, for all the children had always been great gardeners ; from their earliest childhood they had had a piece of ground each to work in. The young people had brought out a great many bulbs and se^s from their gardens in .Scotland, as Mr Dalrymple had men tioned in his letter that English flowers grew beautifully out here. So they had ibrought all kinds of tare flower seeds with them, and now the boys were reaping the advantage of having done so, and were greatly surprised at the rapid growth of everything ;. so different to Scotland, where everything grows so slowly. Then there was a fine orchard, for on*b of the Scotchmen knew a great deal about gardening, so he was made to look after the orchard. Of course, the apple trees, etc., were still very small, but they were growing rapidly. There were pad docks laid down with English grass, in which were sheep, cows, goats, and horses grazing. There was a piggery, and ia large fowlhouse, well stocked with fowls. That was the business of the Scotchmen's girls to look after. At the end of three years, when every thing was looking really beautiful, Mr Bruce could look with pride on his hand jsome estate, and he and his sons thought the ladies might be introduced to their jfine domain now. When the ladies first caught sight of the property, they could hardly believe their eyes ; they said it .looked exactly like one of their Scottish properties, which had been brought bodily out here somehow or other, to Mr Bruce's intense delight, for that was exactly what he had been aiming at all along. Not having seen it in its wild state, they could hardly believe that Mr Bruce had not been joking when he told them the state it had been in at first.
