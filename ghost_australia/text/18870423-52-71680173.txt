Wtilker and O'Sullivan, had wasted the time of the ; House for nearly, elevtn hours'and a half, during1 which- period not ..af'Bingle, "utterance was . worthy hearing;1 . It was. a great effort,, and for tho - credit," of the ^ Assembly it may î be?1:1 hoped, thát4 f it^ will A..' bej unique., If? theirV object'.was* to' prevent/ Sirj* ,Henry ; Parkes' from speaking,^ it utterly ^failed ; ,f/r the Premier had decided to make'his speeçh at whatever time tho'oppor'tunity camé'; and, accord-, ingly, ¡when -Mr; Melville at last sat"; down) Sir Henry arose, and tho Housesoon filled.' (l . :.. \\..¡-. '; ' ? THE:PBEMIÍB'S SPEECÏI-' ( ..... . ; .was a good- deal labored' at .the heginning j and/ indeed, all through' it' was not pf aVvery .< nqyeLor, interesting character.. ~ Ho'began by sayingjthat, 'as what the threo previous sp'eak^rs'hM said was ?not worth notice^he should* not--pay any atten tion to 'utterances which he v.pould ' ,not understand..; Then ' he -went'1 into,* a" .-.long disquisition on the' workiug of ' freetradé.and protectionist principles, taking Englkñd- as the the'type' of . the; one system and America as the type . of--the other. He. was considerably interrupted by Messrs. Walker and Toohey, the latter : member apparently being .under the im pression that' as he had been uncommonly quiet all-tho * evening, it was- necessary now to biing himself into notoriety; ' Sir 'Henry managed to tread upon Mr.- Abbott's'corns, which was rather a different matter ; and he got pretty well snubbed for his pains, and had to apologise. The point of his whole1 speech, however, was that tho Ministry, by proposing the present tariff,,kad ful filled its pledges to the country, and that'it would not shrink from any opposition* It may be noted'here' that Sir 'Henry.feigned ignorance: of Mr. Copeland's hostile notice of motion given when the-House met; or, «at all events, professed that he did not understand that it was hostile. Had ho done so tie'would not have gone on, so he said, "w;t i business. '. But this was poor consola tion -to'Mr. 'Copeland; who-" afterward bitterly complained that all- the wind had been taken out of the sails of his motion by the Premier's speech. And - it : would be doing Very little justice td Sir Henry Parkos to< say that 'that was not precisely .whatrhe intended doings ' Tlîoré is no one sb( deaf as those who . won't h'ear> and bri'this occasion' it suited-Sir-Henry to be very conveniently deaf. .? |: The speech; lasted' over two hours/1 and-Mr.* Abbott'then'rosego reply. ¿ -First;he admiriistefc'ed a severe1 cati'gation ;td the-Premier,'.tellihg";h'im th«t .'.'he""was'*' offensive* td-his opponents,-, and -haughtily-. arrogant "and - insolent 'to' ""his súp-, porters j" and farther pointing out" that his recent habit of tendering perpetual apologies 'was so thin a device that' it' could' be easily ' seen through. Having'got so far Mr. Abbott made a trenchant speecu, attacking the general course1 "of policy pursued by the Ministry,, except as to its proposed retrenchments in the- public service, whore he said he went heart- and soul with them. Mr. Abbott spoke very : ably, although what hé said touched really but littfe upon tho ^financial proposals- of - tho Government;' his attack on them being probably purposely deferred ' ' until tho debate-upon Mr. Copeland's motion.. When-he, concluded there-was a' good deal' of 'squabbling between Messrs;'Garrett, 'Melville,1 Walker, and, Toohey; greatly to ' the disgust of the Chairman Of Committees (Mr;'Cameron);' Thenthö House, at 8 a.m.y adjourned'for 'an hour'*idr' breakfast., ¡When the committee-reBumedi'Mr.'Melville, who had had timo to-read the' morning papers;- and saw-what they had--'said'1 bf the previous even ing's performances; of 1 côurse; was wild* with rage.

This,in the circum stances, and considering that the Government is 1 ?so dissatisfied with the result of the inquest that- ' a special inquiry is to be made into the whole subject of the Bulli disaster, was unmanly and 1 un-English, or¿ as Mr. Abbott soundly termed it, ? " disgraceful.'' When-this matter had been dis posed- of with the contempt it merited, there' Was : - jsoruOitalk about the unemployed, who are' still!'aV thorn in the Ministerial side. ? The Government * " offers tho services bf these people to-the* municiVi. palities if they will pay half their wages ; the> r Government paying the other half. The estiniate'dt' rate of wa¿jcs is 5s per day ; but the Gity Council : . of Sydney to which the offer was made was horror J stricken at the idea. It was' more1 than any alderman's life, to say nothing of his position'or', popularity among the Sydney working classes; to> entortain the idea of employing.

They had promised their constituents to support a /' ' property tax ; and they could not now consistently v^ reruso their support to a motion which afflrmcd-the.. < ;.;. ? desirableness of such a tax. Taking up his texiryi> he proceeded to prove that in,..England¡'and else-is wehere tho bulk of taxation fell, upon - the middle". and* working classes ; and therefore *tho .' earner - would;be the; effect hero. The balance.could bö -' '. only obtaine'd^.by taxing the rich class, so- as -to-' . - ' make the taxation equal.

Mr. Garrel followed, and an uncommonly good speech M; .Garrett made. His great point was that,althoug the necessity for the taxation of. property wt fully admitted, it could be host worded throug ,the medium of a local government Act. Such a Act was under consideration ; and, therefore,^: .iras-premature to discuss tho-property tax no\ és^pecTally as there -was no necessity for-its imm< diate imposition. .

In shorl there was not a vestàgè ot interest,'or a single TaluabIe remark, made throughout the evenihg. ""ipúring the discussion members got curiously tnixed up between direct taxation, protection, and Ireetrdde ; or, as Mr. Eilis put it, between guineas and gooseberries.
