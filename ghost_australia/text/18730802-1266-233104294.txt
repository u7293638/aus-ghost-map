? REDUCE THE EXPENDITURE. To tlbc Editor of the Examiner. SIR,—I am not at all pleased with the prospect of our legislative proceedings, because the burthen of the song is, as it ever has been of late, "More taxation." How can it be otherwise with such expensive machinery at work, reminding one of a very large hat on a very small body? The members in the House of Assembly are now in committee upon the Estimates, and the reduction of ' the various departments if we consider the increase in some, will, as a very sensible member observed, be so very trifling (if a reduction at all) that they had better be passed as they stand without alteration. Indeed, the rule and rage seem still to be to increase taxation in spite of the frequent admonition " Hold hard, gentlemen," of the Treasurer, 'who has plenty to do amongst the many who are inclined to "override the hounds." One representative of the people at the far West proposes to have telegraphic •wires from Deloraine through the dense forests to Circular Head. This scheme is to cost at least £4000, and will be used upon an average about once a week, if not broken down by falling timber. Another proposes the payment to members for their expenses whilst Parliament is sitting, and this will entail the outlay of a few more thousands, to say nothing about its being infra dignitatem. I agree with what the spirited member for Fingal almost intimated the other day, that the Legislative Council is an incubus, an obstruction, a thing that is neither wanted nor desired. Do away with it altogether, Mr Editor, and let half a dozen of our cleverest men (and there is talent amongst the senators) rule our petty affairs, under the system of the old nominee council (to which we must assuredly return sooner or later); our state would then become healthy and wholesome ; there is not "a ghost of a chance" for it as now constituted. Yours, &c.; }— July 24. _ OBSERVER.
