VISIONS SO GRAND. Long sinoo, when the beard was like down on my ohin, In the fine yellow dawn of my days, It's small wss my bother with sorrow and sin. And my heart, hke a bonflro's blazo, Kept burning away By night and by day : I laughod at old Time, with his soytbo and his sand, Whilo listening to Hope with hor visions so grand ! Love oame with his dreams ; in tho folly of youth I thought a fair lady was mioo, - Pure, puro as tho angels— all love, joy, and truth ; Rut its lonely she left mo to pino— As the llowors decay She faded away ; And the grey eeard Time, with his scythe and his ' amid, Wont past me while mourning, my visions so grand ! O ! there's many a change in the world sinoe then, ' And my heart in its wisdom grows oold ; Still often I fool the lost love gnsh again, As I did in my young days of old. Now the snow comes down On my looks, dark brown, And tho sago smiles sad, as he turns up his oand, To ceo the pale ghosts of my visions so grand !
