MEMORIES. They come, as the breeze comes over the foam, Waking the waves that are sinking to sleep, The fairest of memories from far-away home, The dim dream of faces beyond the dark deep. They come as the stars oome out in the sky, That skimmer wherever the shadows may sweep, And thoir steps are as soft as the sound of a sigh, ' â€ž And I welcome them all while I wearily weep. They come as a song comes out of the past, 'A loved mother murmured in days that are dead, Whoso tones spirit- thrilling live on to the last, When the gloom of the heart wraps its gray o'er the head. They come like the ghosts from the grass shrouded graves, , And thev follow our footstens on life's winding way ; And they murmur around us as murmur the waves ' That sigh on tho shore at the dying of day. They como, sad as tears to tho eyes that are bright ; They como, swoot as smiles to the lips that aro pale ; They como, dim as dreams in the depths of tho night ; Thoy como, fair as flowors to tho summer loss vale. Them is not a heart that is not haunted so, Though far wo may stray from the scenes of tho past, Its momorios will follow wherever we go, And tho days that wore first sway the days that aro last.
