ORIGINAL. POETRY. ON GLOAMING GRASSES. The light is low upon the land, The wings of dusk are nigh, Upon the gloaming grasses stand Together, you and I. Why do we wait together so ? I would we were apart, For you may give me more of woe, And break again my heart. Yet, low as sunset in the hills, So low my pulse for thee, Thy glance no vein with rapture fills, No passion-ecstasy. Temp'nte as shadows coolly lain About the earth's dark breast, So do I meet thy gaze again, Untroubled, and at rest Why should I see 'reproaching eyes No Phoenix heart is mine, From dead-white ashes up to rise Responsively to thine. Why should I mourn to-night for hec? I ween no pity lay Within your faithless breast for me. The night you went away. Love! I have prayed for us to stand Just as we stand to-night, And yearning so, your touching hand Had filled my soul with light. But praying days have passed for me, And weepinsr nights grown still, Till freely now is given thee Forgiveness and goodwill. Kay, breathe no lie upon my faith, The heart you held was true . Who bears the blame, that panions wrath With wan eyes looks at you? Who bears the blame-that I do hold - Spent fires where flames did start? For you did turn the embers cold, When you did break my heart. So in the sundown shadows take My answer is your claim, Sweet love- in-ashee ?? will do Howe'er you call her name When gloaming grasses gather dew. . ln some far light Remember then the ghost you slew That walked the earth tonight JENNINGS CARMICHAEL THE nu mbet bfnefcrcpRpere published in all countries H'eitfmaiied fcfrMljOW/fSjWO ap pearing in Europe. <lermnpybeadsth«fifltwith 5,500; then cornea ^Vance with 4,106/Eng land, with 4,000, Austria-Hungary with 3,0Cft Italy with 1,400, Spain "with 850!
