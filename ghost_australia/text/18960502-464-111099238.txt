THE HON. JOHN DAVIES, C.M.G. ' - The Hon. John Davies, C.M.G., M.L.C, was an in teresting, although not by any means a striking, figure at the funeral of Sir Henry Parkes. . This well-known politician, as one of the founders, and for many years the spokesman of the Orange Lodge in New South Wales, was intimately associated with Sir Henry Parkes in political life. Mr Davies, then a- working blacksmith, was very active during the O'Farrell-Kiania Ghost period. For weeks past Mr. Davies had been so seriously ill that recovery was considcrcd hopeless. It must have been no small effort for him to attend the funeral. He looked terribly changed, and only a few in the crowd recog nized him as his carriage passed along. A few years back there was a ' break' in the relations existing between himself and his old friend, and speaking in the Legislative Council in reply to some sneering personal remark dropped by Sir Ilenvy in the other Chamber, Mr. Davies publicly threatened to expose Sir Henry by publishing some secret documents in his (Mr. Davies') possession.
