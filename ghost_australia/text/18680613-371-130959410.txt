It is quite certain thafc with many farmere itis either shriveled wheat for seed, or none, therefore in such cases the mischief, if it is one, was unavoid able. On the other hand it is an unde uiable fad^ that thin seed wheat, grown on the low- Wing lands of Huntingdon- ; shire and X-incolnshire, wherit mildew and rust of one form or another are chronic, is bouykt up tof *Ufety of the best English farmws at compaintirely high prices., - j . There has been a great expenditure of | wrath in this colony, at the affront or in8ult, as people please to call it, pat upon ' mi by a rttxnar of th© appointment of either Mr. Pope Henessy or |Lord Alfred Churchill, in tbe place ofthe late 8ir Boimnick Paly. Indignation meet ings are, it is rumored, to be held in Adelaide for the purpose of an expres sion of -epinKeii being given. l£ resolW ; tions ace carried At these meetings, ifr all human probability they will m^et the.

To those land- reforirieTs who put their faith in occupation and cultivation clauses and all the other' nostrums, we commend the perusal of the following; taken from tbe Melbourne Argus of May 29th, which does not paint the , prospects of i^he set tlers under the Yictonan Act in very glottaiy colors : — ' During the lasit general election, Mr. Grant propounded a scheme of land-law reform of what we felt com* ' i __ 3* ? ? *:?' ? i '*a ? peuea to express siroiig cusapproTiu* xor .months previously there had been an agitation afoot to obtain better terins for the holders under the selection Act of 1865, and from hintg that had falle^from Ministers and their Supporters, it had come to be generally believed that Mr. M'Culloch and his colleagues had some tbing in store for the ben^t of thitt class, Kor was the interest vfrhich the, matter excited altogether confined to the persons iriitaediately interested A case bad-been made out for the selectors which enlisted a good deal of public sympathy on their side, and .many were wfllirig that the terms of their leased Should l«r related since that was the only means by Vrhich their min might be averted. How great wes the disappointment,^ then, when Mr. Grant's altogether inadequate , reinedy was at length made public ! 'His own .pet settlers were in strait&for; money and unable to pay their rent. All .they hadt was already spent on improvements, and them operations had come to ^standstill.' The price of produce* had so fallen- off since they took up their land that aU their plans had been upset, and their only remaining chance lay in tbe placing of their rent payments to their credit as instalments of the purchase money of their * holdings. What, did Mr- Gxaxut offer thea instead ? ? That the selectors should still pay 2s. an acre per Amiiin^ or ten per cent upon the upset price, but that four per cent, of this sboqld go towards the ultimate redemption of the land ; that is, about 9d. of the 2s. was to be placed to the selector's credit; Of course this was a mere mockery of the hopes that had been permitted to grow up, and there was much disappointment in numberless - households when the. scheme;, was made public.' . The easy terms of which we have heard so much here are. said to be ruinously hard there —in fact, so much So that the proposal to reduce them by one-third is described as a tnockery ! Huirah ior cheap land, we say* and the Victorian Land Act! 'We have received some communica tions complaining of unfairness in some remarks that we made in our issue of last week contrasting the price of flour in Adelaide with it in Melbourne, and explaining the cause of the apparent discrepancy. Merchants write to say ihsit Adelaide flour is worth nearly £3 per ton more in Melbourne than the home manufactured article. It is bought principally for trans-shipment to mix with the inferior article which is pro duced m New Zealand. In consequence of this it is not even quoted in the Mel bourne Exchange list of prices current. To every well-wisher -of this colony it must be satisfactory to learn that* our home-made article, uirough no particular skill of our own, but. because of the inherent superiority of the raw material we use in manufacture, is superior to that of other colonies. And this only shews the worse than liselessness of those pro tectionist duties in force in Melbourne which We alluded fo last week. Ourj mercaisnTS say tuat ttte meiooarne muiers and deklers do not want Adelaide flour for themselves bait for purposes of com merce, for; transhipment* &c-; l%e pro tective duties of the Victorian Govern ment do not benefit the home producer,' as the Adelaide flour which ia imported' 'is transhipped.* The Victorian consumer^ simply get a worse articln for their monev than they would do if tio' protectionisf restrictive duties had been imposed!
