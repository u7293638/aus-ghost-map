THE ASTRAL PLANE, In tb© M -Nineteenth Century Rovlow" Mr Sinnett expounds the peculiarities of the astral plane. Ono chiof characteristic is that on the 41 astral light " (which is tho porvad- ing medlom of the astral plane, there aro projeotad- images of things dead and gone, buildings that have cramhlod away, hygono atreets with the moving pictures of tho in habitants that onco lived In tbem. In this sphere quisquo suns patimnr manes, oven down to hansom cabs and shop-windows : — V Scientific Inquiry carried on behind the aoenes of - - nature soon enables us to realiss that not only is tbore a 'ghost'— or, to uso a bettor term, an astaal counterpart— ot every coat and trousers that aver existed,' bat of ovory shop-window and paving-stone, and every market eart and hansom cab, or atom of mnttor in whatever form U maybe thought of. A hideous characteristic of this state of botng is that the hatred, malioe and oruolty, tho thirst to do evil to enemies, and aspirations of ovory degraded kind which rago through tho fevered physical world aro constantly taking shape in distressing ways oo tho antral piano of nature, where everyone of them finds romo too receptive medlom for -Its Impress. Tbo evil thoughts of men do not merely take shape as palnfol records of malovoleoce,but actually unite themsolvos with somo forms of llfo with whioh tbo astral piano is tromlug." All this, adds Mr Sinnett, may bo verified by 44 tho astral sense of any adequately qualified observer." —"Westminster Gozotto.
