All Righta Reserved.] Chapteb VI.— Hesteb. Both Rosie and. myself looked at Hester with the. utmost astonishment when we heard these words. 'Upon my word Hester!' said Rosie, shrusrging her Shoulders; Then with a great effort Heater tried to compose herself* She bit her lips, and trembled violently, and then she said falter ingly— _ .'.'?? 'I — I — should not have said that — but — but you do not understand.' J no, x ao noc, saia rtesie. 'fray, Hester, has Edward been making love to ' you ? He is quite capable of itr— and I pity y ba — for take my word for it, he- means to mkke love to Ethel Verner now7.'. . This was a cruel speech of Rosie's. Hester's face was again dyed scarlet as she made it; but, with another effort, Hester once more controlled herself . ' We had best not talk of it,' she said. 'How is your mamma to-day, M133 Margaret?' I answered her, and the conversation changed, but its effects remained. No sooner was she gone than Rosie began about it. . . ; 'What do you think of that ?' she said. ♦'That little fool, Hester, must absolutely be in love, with Edward I' II She was in earnest,' I answered. ' She was evidently completely upset.' - (t Poor goose I' said Rose; with some con* tempt. 'Fancy her, with ier ordinary face, fixing her heart upon a coarse man like Edward! He sees^-ne appreciates nothing but good looks in women. He is one of those wonderful lords of the creation whose souls are too narrow to believe we have any!' And Rosie laughed. . : ' Yet he w clever, Rosie,' I said, tt or at least was clever/' ? i.-. ' At aneering,' said Rosie. ' Nothing is so easy as to scoff at everything. If a man ha& a smart way of saying disagree* able things he is always considered clever.' 'I am sorry for Hester,' I said gravely, and I was truly sorry. I went over to her father's farm the next day to see her, but I found that she was not at home. Her mother, a homely,- hardworking farmer's wife, came out of her dairy to speak to me, and led me- jnto the fusty un used best parlor, and; dusted me a chair with her apron, and asked me to sit down. ' I'm glad to see you, Miss Marget,' she said, 'though yeu're only looking pinely surely. But you've had a vast of trouble up at the Hall, and if s a sad coming down having to leave it. I can't but blame the squire myself. As I say to John — 'Jofen, be always ready, for we never know when the call comes, and I've seen to John's will myself. -; . ? - - ' John' was Mrs. Wray's husband, Hester's father, and was a very respectable, decent kind of man. ' It was very sad,' I said. ' More than sad,' answered Mrs. Wray. 'We can get over sadness, but we cannot get over lack of wealth ! No, I blame the squire.' At this moment ' John' passed tlie window-^-a man bluff and burly — and his wife called him into the parlor as he entered the house. ? 'Come here, John,' she said, 'here's Miss Marget. As I'm telling her, she looks but ill, but then who can wonder? 'When you go, John, you won't be like the poor squire! You've made yourwilli and I know where it's safe locked away.' 'John' grinnedt and moved Ms feet uneasily, and then grinned again. ' Thou may gan' first,' he said. Mrs. Wray. looked surprised. John seldom asserted himself, and she evidently did riot like him to do so. 'KI do/' she said, 'Hester knows where my savin's are laid away, and tlie silver teapot which my father left me, for none came from your side, John, but the six silver teaspoons. But' she added, still thinking somewhat - indignantly, on John's idea that she might 'go' first, ' it's ill-talking to hear you speak; of me going first, for a poor, helpless body you would be without me, though, perhaps, I shouldn't say it myself. Still, for your own sake, John^Ihopeit will please the Lord to call you first. ?'??' - . John, however; yet looked ^dubious upon the point, for. he shuffled'-Ma big feet again, and rubbed his rosy forehead with one of his hard brown hands. Then an idea occurred to him. ' Ask about the lile has? he said, look ing anxiously at his wife. : 'To be sure,' she answered. 'Miss Marget, what's come over our Hester? She's not the same lass she was, and her father's sore put out about her. Ever since the squire's death she's been not like the same thing, for she was that fond of him she pined for him as if she'd been his own child. But last night she came home like one distraught. I heard, her wailing and weeping all the long night through, and when I taxed her with it she would give do reason. Then I said to|John, 'John, I'll ask Miss Marget,' and I was just going to ask you when John had the forwardness to put in his word.' ?- John made no remonstrance at this. This big stout man was in great awe of his ' missus,' as he called her, and she was truly his u missus.' But she was good to him, though she kept him in order. ' Men,' she at once- confided in me, # re quire a tight hand over them, Miss Marget/ and she kept a tight hand over her Jet?. But for all that John was a happy man, and throve, and saved money with the help, of his thrifty wife. Her butter was ,$he pride of the country side, and to go into her sweet smelling dairy was a treat. Etester (in old days) often brought us up cieam(and pats of delicious butter of 'mother'a making' to the Hall, and these gifts wera greatly appreciated by $$ 1 there. v w And-T-and Hester' was: ill last n^ght ?'

I said it,' responded John, nodding his head at his own sagacity, « I— I_do not know,' I faltered. How could I tell the anxious mother, what; I really thought? Yet I blamed myself afterwards for not -doing so. Her child was vary dear to this good woman, and a mother's word and counsel might have been of use. As it was I said nothing. I saw John's sound honest eyes .looking in my face with an expression of . ; dissatisfaction. It was like the instinct of a dumb, beast. He Could not have told why he did: aw-t believe that I laew nothing, and yet he felt it was 80, His narrow, inind understood what his tongue'could not express. .. ?, The shades of tfee autumn evening were gathering round me when .1 left the farm,, but still Hester had not returned. ' : ' Most likely she's waiting for you in the pillage,' suggested Mrs. Wray- and' thinking that this idea was. not-,an im probable one, I started on my return Jiome. It was now late in the autumn. The sere October leaves came floating to my feet as £ went on, and the cornfields were .: bare, and jfce stackyards full. -A. beautiful . season to my mind, and filled With a strange and solemn sense of rest.'

I said quickly. ** I mean I am not going to marry her,' answered Edward; 'as for cannot, that's another thing;' ??-?..-...,: Chapter VH.-^At the Hax-l. After all, I did act as chaperone to Miss Verneronher visitto the Hall. Edward spoke to my mother about my going, and she persuaded me to go.' - *' Try to be : kind ,to him, my dear,' she Isaid. ' I sometimes^think your dear father blamed himself for being too stern when that unhappy affair occurred which drove Edward first from home.' ' But I do not like Miss Verner, mother dear,' I said. - . 'ButifiEdwardadmires her so much,' urged my mother, ^perhaps he will marry her, and then— r-' 'I still would not like her.' 'We must try to like whoever he ? marries,' said my mother gently. 'lam: most anxious, Margaret, dear, for Edward' to settle. If he had a good wife all may yet be well with him.' ???.-:.?_. So, when Edward asked me agaia, I agreed to go. / ?? . ' The female Chapman,' he said, ' Jias bored me into asking Jier also, so. do .the amiable for once, . my dear Peg, and take this dreadful woman off my handsi' ; 'And leave you to flirt with Mis3 Verner ?' I said; V ' Exactly,' answered Edward, ' Nothing will give me greater pleasurei' And he He did flirt with Miss Verner, of rather Miss Verner flirted with him, for .Edward's feelings as regards her were, I am certain, pnlv. too real. ... ?: ? .j .; : Sosie declined to accompany me to the hall on this, occasion.; : ,A new and good-: looking .curate had lately come to the village, and Rosie, to my great amusement, Ihadsufldeniy become interested in parochial affajrs. -'..--. .,.;.- **:Of ceuTSe I- only pretend to be !' she saiA, laughing, upon my acpusing her of. this/ ** But even a curate, my dear- is better than nothing-:— and Mr. Armatege really is not bad.' . ; . X ','. ? So Bosie was going to pay some chari-, table visits with her curate on the after noon of the day on which Edward Jiad invited Mrs. Chapman and Miss Verner to have lunch at the Hall. _......, L ' I prefer Mr. Armatege's society to theirs,' she said frankly. 'I pity .'you, my poor Margaret, having to spend t% after noon alone with Mjs. Chapman, but my pity is not sincere enough -to offer to share , the task/- No, I:preferMjr. Ajmata^eJ ; A:i man at all events is never quite so tiresome as a woman.' ; . \- Thus I went alone. I had nevar; been at the Hall since we had left it, and a strange feeling came over me as I entered it once more. ' . The same, and not the same! I looked at ine iammar iurniture ; jl saw tne very Ann blots that the dear father's hand jiad: made on the inkstand that he always used, and I went up and Irid my nead upon the -chair . where lie had so often sat, and yet every thing seemed changed. ' How was this ? The rooms ; had a desolate gloomy look somehow, and .truly they seemed desolate tome! ' ; .;,'.: ;j ' I sat - down and thought of the dear ?' father and friend that I had lost. ? But I could not do so long. In. a few minutes I heard the voices of my brother and Miss Verner,and then they appeared, followed by 'W&s.; Chapman. :., . , ^ , . The doctor's wife was strangely different, in appearance to her handsome niece. -.r, She r was a very short stout little woman, with a 'brilliant vpatch of almost; scatlgt color on. each che^K, and she, had small beady eyes. Her, taste in dress also was not good, and , altogether you could scarcely believe that the elegant girl Ethel Verner was a relation of here. She was, however, kind-hearted in her way, and! am;sure:meant - well- .only she had nojta graceful way of showing her good mten^ons.^ .. ; ,, 'An, my dear Miss Margaret,' she said, hurrying up to me, and shaking my hand ynthasympathetiG sigh, 'you must feel ? very dull, I am. sure, sitting here alone. .Suchchangesrr-dear me, dear me— -I can only-fancy I see jour pqor ;father sitting; in ?thef9pm;Stai.' , , ... .'.;;.; ':?:- .

' ~t ipve grapes?' ;. 'Yes, but grapes and all must , remind Miss' Margaret here of - her poor father,' . said 'Mrs. .Chapman, really meaning to shew her sympathy.; 'Ay, ay,, he wasa great loss to you all, and somehow —I don't know how it is-^no disrespect is meant to you, Mr. Edward, but somehow the place doesn'tlook the same thing as it did in his time.' ?.??:? .... /Edward shrugged his shoulders.: . ' I am sorryi'Mrs.; Chapnian,';he said ; 'perhaps after lunch and a glass or two of champagne you may see things in a more favorable light.' . 'Oh, I don't know,' answered Mk. Chapman, 'for poor Mr. Selby had such, pleasant ways with him, there's, not many like him. 'He's getting very stout, Mr. Edward is/' she added in a lower tone to me, but quite loud enough for Edward to hear, and he hated to be considered stout. 'f!Don't you think, my deaiy he's getting T8tout.and coarse like? Ay^ay.; arid I re member him such a pretty, fresh-colore I lad ; but we all change.' And Mrs. Chap man looked contemplatively at Edward, who burst into a loud, but not a very plea sant laugh. / ' I never remember you -thin, Mrs, Chap man,' he said/, ''??.-, .\ ? : 'No, Mr. Edward, I'm stout-built, and always was,' answered Mrs. Chapman., ' When the doctor was. courting me^ t re ; member he used to call me a -plump little partridge, and Fye .never,' last my flesh.' ? ; ' No,' said Edwar^ - 'we may truly congratulate you upon that point.' i.V. '' All .this is very ipterestiiig? isn't it?' said Miss Verner, a little scornfully. *' M/ aunt's tender recollections, of my uncle; '^calling her^a partridge, and so on ?' — ; '7r^We^n^jde^^Jiqpe you may.gefc a3J gop^adBPtanftSiyQursincie^ that's all I caaj «ay,' said iMrs. Chapman, now looking at 'her^mece.^---^'1 !:--^ '?-- ;,- .- ? ?:- ?:'?; ; ?:?-'-* IMte, ,^MJ maj?: saH'5Etfi!§t Verner,; . ? ? r ?' ?? :- ?:?? !?:?-? - l' ? 'Thtin I have some chance of you nofc ' haling tiafy Miss Verner,' he sal4.: ' Mrs. Chapman,' he added, offering his arm to the stout little woinan- 'allow me to have the honor of escorting you to the dining room?' - . As Mrs. Chapman and Edward walked on; Miss Verner passed her arm confidingly through mine, . Thank you.- very very much for coming to-day/' she said. lt Edward, Mr. Selby told me you were 'unwilling to do so, and C can understand your feelings so well. But it is so good and kind of you to get over them, flow different you are to your sister. You are so kind and considerate — I am sure we shall be great, great friends,' And again ehe confidingly pressed my arm. I felt very uncomfortable. She'spoka exactly as if she were going to enter the family, and I was exceedingly embarrassed by her manner. But during the day I began to believe that Edward really was going to marry her. His eyes scarcely left her face, and lunch was no sooner over than they wandered off together on some excuse or other, and Mrs. Chapman and I were left to aniuse our selves as best we could. ; ? 'I'm sure I don't know what to say about it, Miss Margaret,' said Mrs. Chap man, alluding to Edward's attentions to her niece. ' Of course there's been sad stories about Mr. Edward and all that,, and the doctor doesn't think over well of him, to tell you the truth. But still you see Ethel has no money and no home, and she's very anxious to settle well, and husbands are not so easy got how-a-days.' : * 'Is she engaged to Mm ?' I asked, 'Not yet, but it's plain to see what's coming, I thittk,' answered Mrs. Chapman, ?ft and of course Mr. Edward's well off, and Ethel thinks that's a great thing. Not that I mean she thinks' only of that, or that she doesn't like him, or anything of that sort,' added poor Mrs. Chapman, afraid that she might have been talking- indiscreetly ; 'but I mean, of Course, money makes a great difference.' . ' It does- indeed,' I said. ' Girls are very queer now-a-days,' said Mrs. Chapman* 'In '??my young days we were all for looks, and who was the best dancer, and so on, and we used to leave the money part of the business to the old folks, and never thought, before we fell in love whether the young fellow's pockets were well lined of Jnrit. . But - ifs-all changed now. / Has he money ?' ? ? * Can he make a good settlement?' they ask, and they think more ? of that than their sweethearts, I think.' Li; this, way poor Mrs. Chapman rambled on during the whole afternoon, for we never saw anything of Edward and Miss Verner. About four o'clock, ; however, Mrs. Chapman happily began to doze, and so I quietlyleft her to «njoy her nap. I went upstairs to my dear father's room : and sat there more than an hour, thinking of his sudden death f how in a moment he passed from the sunlight into the darkness — -how in a moment lie ceased to be with us, leaving his wishes unfulfilled. For well; I kuew-ihat they were unful filled. Often had I heard him say that our ' dear mother never should be disturbed in her' home, yet now she was banished from the house where she ihad gone as a bride, ,and would this stranger— Ethel Verner— come in her stead ? ;. ... ; t .-, Sitting titiere in his room I thought of . ^ these things, and of the strange -problems '.6f life,: w)^ich only in, death, we shall solve. Was he so far away that he could not see , earth,, and his home, and his wife and children whom he had loved so well* ? Or did he see us, and know that we had been wronged, knowingly or. unknowingly ? - ? , For we naji been wronged. Edward; Iqnew what his father's wishes ihad been, and though his will had: disappeared the memory of it had not. . But the gate .was clbs^d-r-tetween,our father and us: was.the invisible barrier which, parts the living and the dead— -and he could not point across it. But somehow I thought he knew, and that the day might ^pprhaps come when his last . earthly wishes would no longer be hidden : from us. : ;. . : .- , I was roused from,; my reverie: by Edward's -voice calling my name.. Starting up I left my dreams and jcny crude -theories ; behind me,-an(J wenti back to M/r^. Chap man's conversation. ' But I found, lhat : the ladies were just starting homeward^ and to my surprise I saw an unmistakable frown . on Ethel Vernei's beautiful Ijrow.. - ..' Wherever ^ have you; been ?': she said, addressing me. ' We have been hunting . all oxer for you.' . - ; ; ?; .;f ? ?:, a Have you?' I answered with a smile. ' I did not expect you would miss me.' 'Oh but I did, I assure you,' said Miss Verner; ' Mr. Selby and I :gpt a little « tired of each other— and then we went to seek you.' ' * '' ' ' '? : . : I looked at Edward's face as she said this. He looked embarrassed and, greatly annoyed. , _ Then (for' him) he assumed a straifge humility of manner as he replied to her wbrcls. ' You shouldnot say that, Miss Verner,' he said. ' You may have been tired of me, that is likely enough, but I could never tire of you.' ' ! ; ? . ? Miss Verner airily shrugged her shoulders. 'I soon tire,' she said. 'My .good aunt are you not rea&y;? Good-bye, MissSalby,'' and she coldly gave me her hand. . : 'They'Ve fallen J out,' whispered Mrs, Chapman, as she was giving me a partioof kiss.' ' Good-bye, my dear ;- we'ye had an excellent lunch, arid I've enjoyed my little nap more than anything,' . : (To be continued.) ;
