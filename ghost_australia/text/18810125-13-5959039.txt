East Melbourne appears to bo an e\ ceptional electorate ihe constitutional party is always in some difficulty with regard to its second suit In West Melbourne, Richmond, and St Kilda amicable arrangement 3 ire made, and the d stricta aro fairly contested, but in Last Melbourne it co itmuaily happens that an appeal has tj be made to the patriotism of the elect rs to decide be tween personal claim to s lect d man and then to support Ira wit lout regard to personal prepossess ns uch action it seems probable will 'wve ie taken on the present occasion Thoseat iow\acant belongs to the constitutional party, and it is all important that the representa tion should not be handed over to the foo To lose East Melbourne would be a disgrace as well as a disaster, and the sting would be felt by every one of the constitutional electors They aie all aware that a fiasco would be felt as a blow both in tho H use and in the country, that a gloom would fall on the party , that prestige would be lost \ et it cannot be denied that a defeat is pos siblo if two candidates uch as Messta T WALSH and G Con .* go to the poll on their personal men s and individual claunSjWithout an autht fativ selection in favour of the one or ti e other At the election of July 1 ith 110 polling was /o\, 2 118, A K -nilli 2,089, GAUNSON, 1,11G TI 0 constitutional vote is not double tLtt pal'ed by the radical candidate Mr /iO\ did not obtain a majority of 2 a<t against 1, and therefore it is clear that if the con stitutional vote is equally divided be tween two candidates, the Berry faction havo a fair chance of returning their man They will argue that the constitution alists split up among themselves will not poll their full strength, while the rp heals may hope to do better with any other candidate than they did with Mr W GATO SON Nor is it possiblo to gainsay these conclusions On tho contrary, if Mr WALSH and Mr CJPUN' both go the poll it is quite poaoible for the radicals to concentrate upon a third man, and win the constituency fiom the divided majority The electors who mot in the Tem perance hall yesterday, though they were few m numbers, were fauly represen tative of tlie constituent^, and probably the views they expressed are shared by the bulk of the constitutionalists m the d istnet The friends of Mr WALS II are con vinced that their candidate is the man to win the seat with, but they are willing to support Mr Cou IN if he be selected, and the fuends of Mr COPPIN, while they are sure that he eau head the poll, declaro their readiness to rt^ipt and vote for Mi WALSH. Tht saue is almost entirely persono I 1 merges itself into one of claims 1* is urged that Mr WALSH has the gient ar claim upon East Melbourne hecaui r he sup ported the constitutional nominee both in February and July laut, and on tLa 1 othei hand it is contended that Mi I COPPIN bas rendered the party the more i service, because he recently contested Col hngwood To mako a choice under such circu nstancos is diflicult It may well bo (Mt six mon will go one way and si1" another, and hpnce the danger of the ¡)06ition, for if the candidates aro equal or near!) so at the poll, do ieat is a possibility "What is wanted at such a juncture LS an arbitration which should be fair, and which should carry so much weight with it that it would sway the electors, no mattor whether the candidates submitted to it or otherwise, and tho question l8 how to a . arti for the much needed refer ence Ibu decision of the preliminary gathering yesterdny was to call a public meeting of constitutional electors m some largo hall, upon an early day, m or "r that a -vote may be taken Tho public meeting, wo assume, will be held and it may do good soi vire if it is turned to proper account, and it may do much hann if allans aio not managed in an intelligent and patriotic spirit It may be urged that a public meeting is not the pioper place for such dohcate work as the tliscubsion of the personal merits and the political defects of one candi date or another, that one candidato may bo moro lucky in the attend a n.t of supporters than the other, and that the scale may be turned by men who aro not constitutionalists, nor yet East Melbourne voters Hore over, m the heat of the moment words aie upt to bo spoken by the personal pai' jans which stir up strife and render co operation difficult afterwards These objections aro on the surface On the other hand, we imagine the meeting w ould have a great moral effect if it were well Qttended by bona fide electors , if the rule wore laid down that dirty linen should not be washed in public , if this candidate were not assaded nor that dispaiaged , but f a resolution wera un" i imously passed expressmg tho opinion that the claims of Messrs Coi TIN and WALSH should be referred to arbitration, and pledging the electors to ounport the candidate selected by the arb hators A possible plan would bo ior the meeting to invite Mr WALSH to me three or six friends, for Mr Coi .PIN to nominate as many, and for these gentlemen to agree upon three of the leaders in the Assembly to Bit with them and arrive at a decision This is only one scheme Any arlu tration will suffice so long as a de cisión - hich can be loyally adhered to is armed at The necessity for some such action is admitted by the electors whenever they congregate together, aud there L every reason to believe that a fair scheme has only to be submitted to be generally supported A contest within the party is an evil to be jea lously avoided It must lead to bicker mgs, to heartburnings, and to quar relling among men who should bo standing shoulder to shouldei, and that would be a misfortune It might mean the loss of the seat, and that would be a calamity _ Among the exhibits in the Belgian court of the Melbourne International Exhibition is a collection of publications consisting chiefly of repoits bearing on the subject ot education in that country One of these documents contains a comprehensive statement by the Min ister of the Interior of what has been, and is being, accomplished tor the in duslnal and professional instruction of the people of Belgium At the present time theie aio in operation within the limits of that prosperous kingdom 32 in dusti lal schools, 59 workshops for appren tices, besides institutions foi public and gratuitous instruction in administrative and industrial law, popular astronomy, national history, political economy, ii dustnal and physical chemistry, and sanitary science at Brussels, and for e\phimng the construction, manage ment, and repair of steam engines at Namur All these establishments aro maintained and inspected at a total cost to the state of only £11,000 per annum , or less than half the amount winch is annually squandered away in this colony upon payment of salaries to members of the stipendiary brauch of the Legislature -he objects aimed at by the indus trial schooh are these-to give to work men such a scientific training as they aie unable to acquire in ordinary work »-hops , to procure for them tho means of making their labour more productive and remuneiativo, to developo their intelligence by familiarising them v\ i the general liws which govern tu tiansformations of matter, to emancip te them from the ty ranny of routine, and to augment the economic value of their products lu a wold, the handicrafts man is taught to work with his head as well as with his hands, he learns the why and the wherefore of ever} thing he does, and, what is of equally great nu portance, he acquires sound ideas with respect to such questions as capital and wages, the division of labour, the rela tions of employer and employed, tbo principles of exchange, and the i ole of machinery in pioduction Theie are 2G2 professors attached to the m düstnal schools, and thero are up waids of 8,000 persona receiving m stiuction in them In each place tho school is adapted to the special indus try or industries of the locality, and, as a geneial nile, the province and tbo municipality contribute, like tho state, to its support, while in the manufac tunng town of Huy the local authorities present every pupil who passes the final examination and obtains his diploma of capacity with a savings bank book in which two pounds have been cn tered to his credit The instruction is everywhere gratuitous, and is give" dunng two hours m the evoningi and in some places fiom 8 to half p ist 10 on Sunday mornings, the period over which it extends ranging from two to six years, although the avoiago limit appears to be three years Tho total averago cost of the 33 industrial schools is £15,000, of which two fifths is bome by the state, twofiftlw by the commune, and the balance by the province and private donors Nothing can be better or moio compre hensive than the lessons imparted m industrial economy and tho following extiact norn a cncular addiessed to tuo governors of the various piovinces by the Minister of the Interior, covering the programme of the course of instruct tion, and indicating how the professors should fulfil their duties in this respect, shows that m Belgium high offices aio filled by statesmen - " Tho professor mnat not lose sight of tua fact that he Is addressing workmen and that it is much less important to initiate his hearers into the more delicate problems and controverted questions relative to the produc tlon and distribution of wealth than to in culcato upon thom certain elementary troths demonstrated by common sense and by the obscrt ation of daily facts so as to place thom above tie reach of falso doctrines and of vulgar sophisms concerning capital, wages, strikes and the relationship between masters and men Thus comprehending tho task before him, the professor of political economy will contribute effectually to the prevention of losses and disorders such as aro frcniently cntai'ed by the too prevalent ignorance of the truo principles of the science Conversant himself with tho laboms of mdustrj, with the organisation 01 workshop* and with the daily life, the wants and aspirations 01 tho workman he will select lui examples and illustrations from amonj, the phenomena moBt familiar to his auditors A\ o may imagine the intense amusement which the writer of such a document as this, in J. country where there are 16'J poisons to the square milo, would ex ponence on reading that the Chief feecietny of an Australian colony, where there are barely ten persons to tho squaro mile, had giavelj expatiated upon the necessity of protection foi tho manufactures of the luttei, m older to próvido employment foi its íedundant population i And it is impossible to avoid reflecting upon the disisters wo might havo escaped if there had been an evening school of industry in Chel sea in which the rudiments of political economy were taught, and if Mr BLRHY Lad had the good fortune to bo one of its pupils The workshops for apprentices in Belgium owe their found ition to th=> depression undergone by the linen w eating industries ot tho country, ip consequence of the protective policy adopted by other nations half a century ago It was thought that this could be overcome by a retaliating tariff, but, cajs the íeport, "this measure of pro " tection was impotent to ward off a " cusís attributable chiefly to the infe " noiity of our means of production, and " to tho perfection which the fabrication " of linen had been biought to in neigh " homing countries " A lloyal com mission was appomted in 1810, and among the recommendations which it submitted to the Government was one for establishing schools and workshops for appientices These were instituted in IS 17, wero investigated, and fa-vourably repoited upon by a committee of inquiry in 18C0, and have proved to be highly beneficial to tho manufacturing indus tries of Belgium One fact mentioned by Inspector Viv Hi OKI , in his report for 1877, speaks volumes foi the efficacy of these institutions Ile says - "What proves the value oí the lie. mc " tion is that many of the workmen who " have been trained in them earn thiee " times as much as the same class of lt men did formerly " And it neces sarily follows that their labour, directed by intelligence, must be three times as productive to thoir employeis, ao otheiwise, tho latter could not afford to pay the highor rate of wages In almobt every case it is in tho manufactuio of textile fabrics that in struction is given, and the number of persons who have passed through tho woikshons for apprentices since they were fast opened is 21,922 Their annual cost does not exceed £3,000, of w hich the provinces and the communes bear about three eighths, and the stato the residue Besides these educational institutions, there is a High School of Commerce in Antwerp, in which young men are quail fied for mercantile and financial pur suits, and aro well giounded in the following subjects-Hie histoiy of com meicial products, commercial and in dustrial geography, political economy, the history of commerce ana ínaustiy, fiscal legislation, commercial and mtei national law, maritime aichitectmo and aimanionts, and the Flemish, German, Lnghsh, Spanish, and Italian languages, while a sum of £1,G00 is annually appropnated to defray the cost of foreign tiavel on the part of those pupils who have received the diploma of the institution Perhaps a know ledge of what is bomg done m tho way of industnal education in Belgium will enable oui leaders to undeistaud why its manufacturers, pio tected as they are by free ti ado, prove to be such formidable competitors to those of otht countries in foreign markets, and why so small a territory is enabled to maintain so largo a population We lmo recen ed sot eral leücii lately maintaining tho advisability of increasing tho tax on dogs, foi tho purposo of pi o motmg tlio destruction of i large propor tion of those mongrel brutes w fitch infest tho citj and suburbs Wo aro docidcdly of, opinion that any arrangement which would lmo the cQcct of lossonmg tho mimbei of theso pests bhould commend itsolf to tho judgment of evoiyono Nine tenths of tho ciirB which roam tho streets or lmk in obscure corners and n0hts of, way ai o neithoi useful noi ornamental, and might lecoivo their quietus with decided adtontago to society at large They make ni0ht hideous by their how lings, thoy tortuio tho sicl, harass tho nervous, dru o tho irritable to fren/y, and the mild tompoied to despair But tho biutes aro not only sources of annoyance-they aro posituo dangers to lifo and limb Thoy aro ono and all possessed by somo impulse of pecuhai malignity that causes tliem to rush at e\ cry horse thoy seo passing by, to the great poril of riders and driveis Nothing w di drive them oü until thoy Jiavo rohoved thoir oxuborant spirits uko street our knows tho length of a whip lash at a glance, and keeping just beyond Us rango ho runB along barking with de- moniac fury, jumping at tho horso's noso, or making "short digs" athis heels, tiintd tho nato traveller absolutely thirsts foi blood, and thinks that ho could d10 happy if, before giving up the ghost, ho could bo rovenged upon his canino per- secutor Sometimes two or moro mon- grels joui m tho sport, when, of eourao, tlio proceedings are oven moro chooiful and cvlmaiating By all means lot us i«oa heatier dog tax, and then pio «ably many of those baying, barking, growling, howling nuisancos will bo loft to find thoir way to the happy hunting grounds Thoy may render thoso mythi- cal loalms desolate and unfit foi tho poor Indian," but at all events wo snail bo "d of thoir maddomng cries and thou proiokwg pranks The tranquillity of Europe ia still menaced W the dispute between Turkey and Greece ?loo latter power is diBpoaed to insist upon jue cession of the territory allotted to hjr by "je late Berlin Conference, and a strong war- like feeling is reported to provail throughout ">e country The Russians havo obtained somo fresh successes over the Turcomans at Oeok Tepo, but have not yet captured the l0't Should they succeed, the Turcomans c°uld retire to Ashkabad, fioores, or tho line 0[ the Tf>iend, where, it ia aaid, the fighting force of the whole Tekke tribe maid be more I eaaily collected than at Geok Tepe His I Excellency Sir Hercules Robinson haa arrived ' at Cape Town.
