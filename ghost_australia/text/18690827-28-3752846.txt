THE POPE AND THE PATRIARCH OF ALEXANDRIA The Greek church has all along been the standing difficulty of Ultranationalism , It was impossible to ignore the Episcopal succession of her bishops and clergy as has been done, on the slenderest grounds, with the Anglican .Episcopal , It was equally Impossible In es- tablish any charge of heresy against heresy for on every point of doctrine she retained, with the minutest and most rigid accuracy, the faith of the ancient Church before the division of East and West, And, in fact, whatever individual theologians on either side may have said in the heat of debate, about the famous Felioque con- troversy, on neither has any forma! indictment for heresy been preferred, Two Popes, Cle ment VIII and Benedict XIV, have expressly ruledif thatlhe Greeks are bound to believe the Procession of the Holy Ghost from the non- but mt bouiul to o.seh'e it, unless thepe was danger of scandal," No such concession was eves' made, or could have been made» by th§ eiiily Church to the Ariane as to the use or disuse* of the critical H lota" with, which Qii>= bon makes §o merry, And» mo e than this, there has never been any formal denial on the part ol Reme that the ©reeks are Included lu the unify of the ©burch. On the contrary. It lias often hegn. implicitly admitted, Not only does $t, Bernard ask Pope likujeuius III, if he '.can possibly think It lawful te^d&Member; the Qh[[i'i}h," when his reference to "patriarchs" shows that he had the ¡Hast lu mind as well as the West, but the Popes themselves have aU ways used similar language, öregovy X, mm named the ©ounci! ol''Lyons "because of his extreme bitterness on beholding the v%)\t (if the UriivëPëia Qkwoh foreshadowed in the net of .Pete? the|¡fisherman» that broke tor the multi: tude of li-ihes which it enclosed! w§ Í!Q not wy* (Uvhkûû its flri'thi but notoriously and. ni mentably divided as to its faithful members," A passage in the original Decree, Inviting them to Basier was cancelled because the term {i here= iles" had iiccldentalty slipped into it, jâuge= nins IV, told.his envoys" thai the GouneU of Florence was sunanoned " for the union oí the Western and Ilastern ©burch," and asked the ©vgaUs that^lygs " in whftfc shall wa ba banar ii ted (f m fhü to unite the Qhwoh of @od !"
