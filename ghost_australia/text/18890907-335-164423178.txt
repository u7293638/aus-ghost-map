AS DZA.TE POET. Xever, since the days of Pope and Dennis, has anything quite bo savage appeared in literature ss Mr. Robert Brownings little ode, 'To Edward Fitzgerald,' published in the last AOiemtiOn. Mr. Aldis 'Wright, in his 'Xjife and Letters' of tlie translator of Omar Khayyam, had most incautiously admitted a hasty sentence of the genial ' Htz,' which ran: — 'Mrs. Browning's death is rather a relief to me, I must say : no more Aurora Leighs, thank God ' A woman of real genius, I know; but what is the upshot of it all! She aad her sex. bad better mind tlie kitchen and the children ; and perhaps the poor. Except in such things as little novels, they only devote themselves to what men do much better, leaving that which men do worse or net at all.' Mr. Browning, it seems, lighted on this unlucky passage — never, of course, meant for the public eye— end blazed forlh iuto the subjoined volcanic verses : — TolSmrAiLbFjTzta&iMi.; \- ° I chanced npoo a a£W book yesterday ; I opened it, and, vrhere mj- Jtagor laj '£ wilt page and uncut page, these wnrds I read— Some six or scren at most— And learned therebr Xhat run, fitzgerald, trham by car and eye She never knew, ' thank God my wife was dead.' Av, dead : ana were yourself alive, good Titx, Ear to return you thank? would task my wits. £icldng yon seems the cownoii lot^-f cdtb^ Whue more appropriate greeting lends yon grace, fiorely to spit there glorifies your face — Spitting from lips once sanctified by hers. July S, 1889. Eobert Bsowxikg. TawUcm animit ! Should a great poet thus, for a fretful phrase, Avenge the dead upon the dead, by telling him who was Ihe 'best friend' of Lord Tennyson, and author, in the way of translation, ol the' 'one -thing done divinely well,' that hie ghost is not good enough to spit at? Mr . Alois Wright has cer tainly mnch to answer for.
