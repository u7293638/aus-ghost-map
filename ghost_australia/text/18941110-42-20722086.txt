Flotsam and Jetsam. Songs of the Bush. [Some readers who heve been kind enough to send in contributions for this column evidently do not understand that only bush songs are wanted. The majority of so-called songs sent in are simply poems, often of tho sendor's own composition. While somo of these are worthy of publication, and are therefore held with a view to future insertion, tbey oan have no placo in this column, whioh is reserved for songs and songs only.] OLE MASSA. (Socond Version—supplied by W. M. D., Nive Downs.) Am,—" Bo early in tbe morning." As we were lying on our beds To rest awhile our weary heads Ole Massa oame, and thus did Bay, "Now boys be up at break of day." Chorus.—So early in tho morning, So early in the morning, So early In tbe morning, Just at the break of day. So we got up while the froßt was hard, And oaught our homos in the yard, Put the saddles on thoir baoks, And went to look for cattle tracks. When we got out amongst the gums We had some fun with our new chums, Found a mob of cattlo here, And straight baok to the yard did steor. An old poloy cow ran off the track, ' 01 o Massa went to fetch her buck, The horse he was riding being rather free Ban him against a myall tree. We got Ole Massa safely home— He said, " I never more will roam I"— Put him down upon his bed, But soou found out that he was dead.. As I walked out the very next night I got a most tremendous fright, For, sitting on the stockyard post, I saw my poor Ole Massa's ghost, A-smoking of the same old day As he used to smoke on a mustering day. Ole Massa's dead and gone to rest, Of "bosses" all he was the best. Never saw the like since I was born, Misß him now when dead and gone.
