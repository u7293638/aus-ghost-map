WILL you forget me or remember, sweet, Now all our golden Summer days are over, And if in any after-time we meet, Will you not be my love, nor I your lover ? It might have been ; but, since it is not BO, You have but little reason to regret me ; Yet,- jusb because I loved you I would know, Will you forget me 1 The roses dream beneath the silver light The pale moon sheds among the garden closes, And in the gleam your face shows cold and white, Yet fairer than the fairest of the roses. The river sings its ceaseless old refrain, And we are parting here where first you met me ; But in your heart is neither joy nor pain Will you forget me 1 I think you cared a little for a while, Enough to make Love's game a pleasant pastime, And yet you tell me smoothly with a smile That you and I have played it for the last time. You cared a little, though you marvel why I learned so well the fruitless task you set me, And wonder when I ask you, with a sigh, "Will you forget me 1 Oh, love, the roses here will bloom and fade, The river run on its endless course for ever, But one sweet hope that in its grave is laid Will rise again to warmth and brightness never ! And, dear, I think you cannot feel or know How much I could have loved you had you let me, Who, heedless of your scorning, love you so ! Will you forget me 1 " Good-bye " is but a little thing to say, And yet the word that careless lips have spoken None knows how many thousand times to-day, None knows how many thousand hearts has broken. Ah, sweet, I would my heart and lips lay dumb Where never any thought of you could fret me, And ghosts of buried dreams could never come ! Will you forget me 1
