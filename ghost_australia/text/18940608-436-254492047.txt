A GHOST YARN. The Dubbo Dispatch sajs :—TheCoalbaggie ghost is still tormenting the Stein family. It is now amusing itself by trying to burn down the house and make a bonfi.e of the girls' dresses. The invisible visitor is evidently not very chivalrous, or he would leave the women's finery alone. Bat, after all, I think the Coalbaggie hobgoblina has been outdone by the spirits, which have been cocjured up in Melbourne, by that respectable and intelligent body called the Pyschical Research Society, and of which the Rev. Charles Strong is a leading member. The spiritual visitants appear in glistening garments, shake hand?, eat bannocks with avidity, and appreciate chocolates. One of the spirits has acknowledged himself to be a certain Geordie Thompson, " frae Aberdeen awa," end he talkp, we are told, with an accent peculiar to Aberdonianp. What particular Geordie Thompson he may be is not ot course told by him, but it strikes me as singular that his christian name ehould be " George." That's the prenomen of the fellow, who is making things "quick and lively" for the Stein family. Bannocks are, however, tbe Aberdeen man's delight, while tbe Coalbaggle youth has a preference for cold vegetable. He won't take them eff the table or out of your hand, sb the better mannered and less shy Melbourne chap—he wants the plate to be placed under the table, and then he will attack it. Of course, I don't want to aay anything about either of the two phenomena, am quite prepared to believe there are more things in heaven and earth than are dreamt of in our philosophy, but still I can't help assert ing that the spirit which ate the bun at the Melbourne seance may be fairly said to " take the cake."
