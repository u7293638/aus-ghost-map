Ghosts. The painter toiled at his picture in the light of the northern sky, And his soul burned out at his easel as the paint grew hard and dry. The marvellous work that the painter wrought seemed full of depth and soul, And the people gazed at the deathless thing, while each one paid his toll. Then questioned the voice of the painter's heart, while the great man shook his head. "No motive pure can the world endure—I did it for gold," he said. The worker worked in the midnight black and under the light of day, And dragged his soul from out of himself and breathed it into the clay. Thus wrought the hand of the poet a song that the people sing, And, the sound of its wondrous music wells up like a living spring. Then questioned the voice of the poet's heart, and he bowed his head in shame. "No motive pure may my soul endure—I did it," he cried, "for fame." In front of the battle's wavering line the herb charged his steed; A thousand furies had hurried him on, and his was a hero's speed. Into the serried ranks of death he rode with a hero's shout, Till victory sat on the upraised flag, and the foe was put to rout. Then questioned the voice of the hero's heart, and he said, "The fight is won. Yet motive pure no man may endure—for glory the deed was done." L'ENVOI. Art met Duty, and Duty said, "Three beings have just been sold: One for glory, and one for fame and one for glit- tering gold. You were not there, and I was not there, yet the deeds they did rank high; Glory and Fame and Gold, it seems, are better than you and I." Said. Art, "Why not? You're a ghostly thing, and I myself am the same; We're not worth much to the popular touch with gold and glory and fame!" —Tom Masson in "Munsey's Magazine."
