PORTFOLIO. We possess the fulfilment of HIis propheti promise-the Comforter, the Holy Ghost, who teaches, sancitiie,, takes of the things of.Jesus, shows them to us, enables us to pray; and, Iimseclf, makes supplication for us. We rejice in that priestly blessing, in the very giving of which Christ ascerled to glory; and that blessing fills our whole life with power from on high. We a, able, by faith, to overcome tie worhl, being made more than conquerors through Iim who loved ,. s oon ,se shall inherit the Kingly glory. When the Gospel that went out from Jenlsalem returns to it, and the nation is converted, then will all nations become the king. donms of our God. Meanwhile, the chief matter of our preaching is the forgive. ness of sins, through the dying Saviour ; a new life of holiness, by power of the living Saviour; translation to Hleaven and eternal glory, by grace of the ascended and enthroned Saviour. Glory d'd not come suddenly upon Jesus. During the forty days of the risen life there was a process of glorifica tion-the resurrection was itself a glori fication, and the ascension was its climax-a sublime climax-the fill manifestation of HIs exaltation is in Heaven. The cronn, the dazzling crown of the resurrection, is the ascen sion. Otr present resurrection life, in whichiwe are conscious. even admids tour grief, of some blissful presence and know Jesus, should be a life of ascen sion. The ripeness of our present resur rection life, the climax of of our faith, when we shall know the dying Saviour yet more blessedly as the living Saviour, will pass into yet higher stages, so that heart and mind dwell in the Heavenly places in Christ, and Christ in us. Hereafter, Heaven will be our place: now, it should be our state; and it is not the end, but as the beginning of miraculous things; miracles to be wrought by the Spirit of love, of troth, of power.-Rec.
