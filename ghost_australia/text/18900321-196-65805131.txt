HOW THE ZULUS FIGHT By H. RIDER HAGGARD. Concluded from last week. Now the Zulus, running in the shape of a bow so as to wrap the laager round on three sides, were within seventy yards, and now fron every waggon broke tongues of fire. Over rolled a number of the Umtetwa, but the rest cared little. Forward they sped straight to the laanger, striving to force a way in. But the Boers plied them with volley after volley, and, packed as the Zulus were, the elephant guns, loaded with slugs and small shot did frightful execution. Only one man even got on to a waggon, and as he did so I saw a Boer woman strike him on the head with an axe. He fell down, and slowly, amid howls of derision from the two lines on the hill-side, the Zulus drew back. " Let us go, father !". shouted th saolderstoii the alope, uamong whom I was, to their chief, who had come up. " You have sent outthe little girls to light, and they ure frightened. Letus show them the way." . " N, no !" the ehief SIuesa .answered, laughin'g. ','Vat ia tminute nnd the little girls wilu grow fo womenh, itld women. are good enough to fight against Doers I'" : The attacking Zulus heard thel mockery of their fellows, and rushed forward again with a roar. ?But the Boers in the lhuger had found time to load, and they met with it warm recep tion. Rleserving ther lire till the Zulus wore packed like sheep in a kraal, they loosed into them with the.roere,;and the warriors fell in little heaps; IBut I esw that the blood of the Umtotwas was up; they did not mean to be beaten back this time, and the end was near. See ! six mon had leapt on to awaggoa, slali the manbohind it, and sprung into to laageri They were killed tiers, but others followed, and then I turned my head. But I could not shut my ears to the cnes of rage and ddath, ard, the terrible S'gEe!. ?'gre! of the savagoes as they did their work of murdor. Once onlyy I looloed up and saw poor Hatns Borthlastmftiing on a waggon smiting downe menl with the butt of. his rife. Then assegais shut up towards him like tongues of steel, and when I looked again he was gone. â€¢I turned sick with fear and rage. But alas ! what could I do t They were all dead now, andprobably my own turn was coming, only my death would niot be so swift. The fight was ended, and the two liues on the slope broke their order, and moved down to the laager. Presently we were there, and a dreadful sight it was. imany of the attacking Zulus were ldead-quite fifty I should say,'and at least a hundred atd and fifty woere wounded, some of them mortally. The chief Sususa gave an order, the dead men were picked up and piled in a heap, while those who were slightly hurt walked off to find some otne to tie ul their wounds. But the more serious cases tmot with a different treatment. . The chief or one of his indunas considered 'each case, mid if it was in any waiy bad, the maul was taken tilu and thrown into the river which ran near. None of them offeored any objection, though one poor follow swat to shore again. He did not stop there long, however, for they pushed him back and drowned him by force. The strangest case of all was that of tme. chief's own brother. He had boon captain of the line, and his ankle wvis smashed by a bullet. Sususa came up to hun, alid, having examined! the wound, rated him soundly for fatlitig in tishe first onslaughlt. The poor fellow made the excuse that it was. inot his fault, as the iBoers had hit him in the first rush. His brother admitted the truth of. this, and talked to him amicably.; .,: "Well," lio said 'at laegtih,,ofeorinn himaa Sho, chief," said the woundedman, looking at his ankle. " And to-morrow we must walk far," went on Sususa. " Say; thlei,'will you siet hre on the velltt or Sand he nodded towards the river. The mhin'dropped his head on his breast for a 'minutd:as though in thought. Presently h3 lifted it and looked bususa strnightin the fico. "'y talkie p ains me, my brothler,"'li said; '" I'think I willigo back, to Zululand, for, there is the only kraal I wish to see again, oven if I creep aboutit like a snakec." " It is well, my brothor," said the chief. SBeast softly,' aud: ltuviitg shaken.hands with him, hae go'a an ornderto one of the.inuddias, and turoned away. . . Then moe oamo, anls suppeortitg.thn o wouldod man, led him dlosn.to the banlks oft the stream; Here, at his request; they tied ii hetvy stone round his tneck, and threw him itltoa?,dsep pool. I.suw the whole. sad scene, and the-victim never oven winced. Ib was impossiblol-ot to admire the extraordinary- courage of the iant, or to' avoid boing struck with the eoldtehoodod cruelty of his brother the chief. Antlyet the act was necessary from his point of new. The man muotoither die swiftly, or.b leift to perish a' starvation, foi no Zul forse. will oncumber itself with vounded ment. Years of moerciless warfare hadhsohardened these, people that thoe looked on death as nothing,, and were, to do ttheti justice, as willing to meet it themseales its to millet iton others. W' hen this very Impi had beesentout by the Zulu King DIth;g t, it consisted of some nine thosand mten. Now; it numbered less tha threoo: ; all the nest were dead. They, too, weotld probably soo hbo dead. Wltat.did it matter P They livedl by war to die in bleod. It was thtelr 'ntural rod.. "Kill till you are killed." That is the. mottlao the Zulu soldier. It hat the merit of simuplicity. Meanwhile the warriors wereo looting the all the dadBoie tuti uro cahep. I looked at the haip ; all of them wero there including the two stout fraus, poor thintgs. But I mesedl one hotly, that of tha aits hingh's daughter, little 'ota.

Just then the great Zol, uBonbyano, w.ho It had loft my side tu indulga in the conugnilo oc- y culmtion of looting, coa out of a wuggot cry ing tlniat Iho haot got thie " little white oue."? I h looked; heo was carrying the child Totbs, grip ping her frock in one of his huge black sands. s He stalked up to where we were, uand held the Ii child before thechief. " Isit dead, father?". he said, with a laoug. o Now. as I could well see, the child was not b dead, but had been hidden away, and fainted si with fear. -. cl The chief glanced at it carelessly, and said- g S"Find out with your kerrie.". is Acting on this hint the black devil hold up the a child, atid was about to kill it with his knob- I. stick. This was more than I could bear. I st spring tit hsi and struck him with till my force i in the face, little caritg if I was speared or not. r Hei dropped Tote on the ground. h " Onu" hosaid, putting his hand tohis nose, n "the White Spirit has a hard fist. Come, e Spirit, I will fight you for the child." The soldiers chterdl and laughed. " Yes, yes I" they said, "lot Ilombytmno fight the to white Spirit for the child. Lot the-, tight o1 with assegais." n For a moment I hesitated. What clianco haid I against this black giant? But I had hi proneied'poorHans to save the child if I could, t andt what did it matter ? As well iienow as later. Iowever, Ihud wit enough left to nmako hi a'favour of it, and intimated to the chief - throughIlidaba-zimbi that I was quite willing to condescend to kill iBombyune, oil conditiol at that if I did so the child's life should be given at to me. Indaba-simbi interpreted my. words, at but I noticed that he would not look oni me as esi he spoke, but covered his face withis hins ads and spoke of mu as. " the ghost" or the " son S1 of tho s irit." For some reason that I have nasve? quitumnderorsootd, the chief consented to the 'duel.' I fancy it was because heo believed i meta iM oro thoan morial, and was anxious to is soo t-dnlstbof lombyaoe..-. .. " Leothetu fight," he said. " Give them i asegais andi no shields; the child shall be to or him who cosiqucre." .W "t Ye. yes" cried the soldiers. "Let thoem fight... Don't be afradd, Bombynio ; if he is a gr lpirit, hie's a very smnall ono." " I never was frightoened of man or beast, to aind amu trnOt goillg to ruts away fro i White r Ghost," answered the redoubtablo llombyaso, r as he examined the blade of his great bangwat un 1 orstobbing assegai. .i Tilten thug mnadd ring round us, gave mu a ivt siiilar assegoai, and.set in some test paces apart.
