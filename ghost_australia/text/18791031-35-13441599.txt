SCHOOL OF ARTS. Professor Pepper' s latest programme was the medium for conveying a vast amount of information in a most pleasant way to a very large number of people at the School of of Arts last night. The greatest interest in the entertainment was evinced by the audience, and frequent rounds of applause testified to its success. To-night Professor Pepper takes his benefit. The programme prepared for the occasion is a lengthy and very inviting one, and should prove the most attractive the Professor has yet given, in the first part the mysterious " Poitrail Limmer " will draw a portrait of the Hon. Graham Berry, and the Professor will deliver a lecture on " Fire Handling." In illustration of this lecture Professor Pepper will perform the scientific feats of plung- ing his naked hand into boiling lead, and of burning, for the first time in Sydney, a large diamond, of which Mr. Hollingdale, in King- street, is the donor. The first part will conclude with the Â¡UuMon--"Filler's Ghost." In the second the most interesting of the motompsyelioiiau illu- sions, and the bested the charming statuary pictures, will be repeated and displayed, and the amusing sketch, the *' Missing Ghosts," will conclude this capital bill. As Professor Pepper's season concludes on Tuesday next, but few opportunities remain of seeing his fascinating " scientific festi- vals."
