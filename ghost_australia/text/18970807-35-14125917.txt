Some oí tho visitors, liko one or two of the native Indian dignitaries, had remark- able records bohind them. Our own Tre- miera liavo their larger réputation all to mako yot, whatever their services within tho rospeotivo colonies. Some of thom havo left good improsnions in England, and tho spooohos of tho Preuiior o£ this colony have established a standard of comparison to which any discussion of the share of the colonies iu Imperial policy will in future bo largely referable But to the Canadian Promior bolongs tho dis- tinction of having in a measure dictatod a chango of policy to the mother country and procured tho abrogation of certain treaties with foreign nations. With Mr. C)inmberlaiu"s statetnont as cabled yester- day boforo tis, of courso, it is now ovident that tho denunciation of tho Gorman and Bolgiau treaties did not follow on Sir Wilfrid Laurior's single action. Tho Pre- miers, wo aro reminded, united in uiging tho advisableuoss of that step as a pre- liminary to improved trado relations be twoen the colonies and the mother coun- try. Mr. Chamberlain claims unnnimity for this action of tho Premiers, whioh raises nn interesting question ; but the fact remains that tho policy of Canada lod the way, tho speeches of tho Conadiau Promier levelled it, and tho honour of the situtation remains with Sir Wilfrid Laurier. His is nn interesting personality. As his portraits havo familiarised his fea tures to us thoy are those of a cultivated and thoughtful man of artistic tempera- ment anti of considerable refinement of character. His reputation and offective noss as an orator have gained him the name of tho " Silver-tongued Laurier." Dio has boen for a qunrtor of a century in politics, and ho was thirty years of ago and a barrister m his seventh year when he was first sent into tho Quebec provin- cial council as a Liberal. Thrco years lator ho was in tho Dominion Parliament, and at the ago of thirty-six he held n seat in tho Cabinet. Ilia varied experiences includo a term ns a journalist, which has not boon without tho influonco usually traceable in thoso who graduate into poli- tics from journalism. It adds to tho interest oxcitcd bj' the success of this singular man that ho is by birth and by many jwars' political associa- tion a French Canadian. Quebec, in which provinco Laurier was boru, quaintly preserves its old French characteristics, and the language and customs of the original Frenoh settlors strongly survive thore. Yet, ns wo soo, this old socioty has beon ablo to produco a practical poli- tician qualifiod to lead tho Liberal party in tho Dominion, and offectivo onough iis a loader to bring his party into power and to lead tho way in a policy which, in tho fow months since tho Laurior Cabinet was constituted, has boon powerful onough to chango British commercial dealings with two commercially - poworful foreign nations. As matters at prosont stand in thoso colonies, it would of conrso bo prac- tically impossible for an Australian Pro mior, howovor ablo or gifted, to aehiovo snell a record as tins It must bo remem- bered that tho so\on Australasian Ple- nums v. out to London each is tho lepre scntitno of his o«n separate colony, whilo tho Canadian Premier «vent as tho lepiosontativoof a wholo Dominion com pnsing a gioup of locally-governed colonies The Austrahsian Premiéis biought divided counsels Each had an opinion of his own Proetiado No« South Wales and protectionist Victoria could haidly bo oxpoctod to look fiom the same point o£ view nt the proposals submitted by Mr Chamberlain, "and so on all lound tho oncle With Canada tho case was diffeicnt The Premier «as tho mouth pieco of ihepohoj of tho «bolo Dominion, and ho represented in Ins singlo indivi- duality tho sense of the wholo gioup of provinces that go to loim that great ledo íation Quite apart fiom the considoia tion, then, that tho policy oi Oannda may have helped to seno the end which Mi Chamberlain is said to hive m íeseivo, it is apparent that the political head o£ a fedeiation hko that of the Canadian Dominion would eau y moro weight nt tho centro of the Empne than anj one oí a o-roup of soveu Premiers lepiostntmg supposedly loalous colonies and in some enses antagonistic policies liad the Pie mioi of Now South Wales, foi oxnr plo, been enablod to go to England is the Pic mioroftho Australian Commonwoiilth it is apunront that tho luíluoui e of the io piesontation would lune boon onoimously multiplied, and Ins declarations of policy or opinion would naturally have earned much groatei «eight Tho fact ma> stand as an illustrative instance oi the diiToionce in possibilities gonoially botwoon a con genes of sépante piovincos and it «elded fedeiation Sir Wilfrid Launer is a hronch Cana- dian . and the fact recalls the cnoum BtnncQ that »t is not BO veiy long: since the French element in Canada still constituted a grievous source of trouble to what it theu regarded as foreign rule. A vory slight acquaintance with the history of the provinces will suffice to show how rootod the fooling of disnffoction was, and naturally so m the circumstances. Yot to-day wo find one of this onco recalcitrant raco loading tho politics of tho wholo Dominion, loyally representing all classes and grades of his fellow-Canadians at the great racial festival last month, and so far I reversing tho old Pnpiueau policy of buy- ing nothing from England as to grant practically proforontial troatment to her products. A fow decades of years ago such an occurrence, wore it concoived of, would bo treated as an historical pheno- menon whorovor so thorough a revolution in polioy and sympathies was droumt of as possible How is tho chango to bo accounted for ? Tho answor is satisfac- torily and conclusively giveu by Sir AVil 1 frid Laurier himself. Ho finds the reason in the fact that England has rcfrninod from interfering in the internal govern- ment of the Dominion. As in these colonies, tho Canadians have boen freoly doworod with tho right to administor their own political institutions in thoir own way. At one time such nu oxperimonfc would bo conBidored suicidal. Some foreign nations in thoir colonising policies appear to so rogard it still. It moy be that the experiment was part of that policy at ono timo in favour with a section of British statesmen, of refusing to bo trammelled with colonies at all. AVhnt evor tho reason, tho fact stands as SirAVil frid Laurier has declared it. Tho Cana- dian provinces, Iiko tho Australasian colonies, aro stronger than ever in their attachmont to tho Empiro since thoir dis- charge of the duty of solf-govornmont has brought with it a sonse of constitutional responsibility, nnd tho career of tho Cana- dian Promier is interesting as n romnrk ablo individualisation of tho process. Another obstado lias been put in tho way of tho harmless ghosts that are sup- posed to froquont somo old housos, and to keep alivo in n somewhat noisy and dis- turbing way tlio memory of bygone tragedies. Tho London "Times," «-Inch has hithorlo boon satisfiod with discussing international treaties and tho methods of diplomacy, and tho ruling principles of finance, lias now begun lo ask for their credentials. Many a corre- spondent has tho famous journal sont to doseribo tho conduct of wars, or to study the conflict bot«-oon dip- lomatists, or to relato tho mau nors and customs and industries of outlying lands. It has rocontly appointed a correspondent to report on tho noises that aro heard in haunted housos, tho strange knooking at the doors nt mid- night, and the weird patter of ghostly footsteps in the corridors. The chango is amusing. The journal that has triod to influence tho courso of international politics sends a representativo to sloop in a room that is said to bo haunted, and to loam all tho local gossip that may bo available. Tho curiosity of the "Times" was aroused in this way. Tho Marquis of Buto rented, nr^parontly through nn agent nnd not diioctly, a house in Scotlaud which win considered to bo suitnblo for the investigation of weird nnd mysterious noises. An invita- tion was sent to tho mombors of the Society of Psychical Jiosearch to take up their quartors in tho house for a few months, and study tho supposed " phonomonn." A party of them wont down from London, armod with notebooks and tho latost theories and a determination to find something worthy of publishing to the world. After tho lapse of a month or two tho' ndvontuious correspondent paid his visit lo the mansion of Ballechin, for that is the namo of the plnco which ho has con- trived to mako famous. In London ho was told most minuto storios about the liouso, which had boen haunted, as was alleirod, for twenty or thirty years. On hÍ3 arrival ho was disappointed. After slooping for a couple of nights in tho room which was supposed to bo tho centro of nil tho mysterious noises, ho carno to the conclusion that there was nothing moro in it than tho creaking of tho furniture and tho sounds mado by the lighting of fires and the drawing of water and tho general work of tho liQusehold in tho morning. This, of course, might have boon put down to his own obtusenoss. As Mr. Andrew Lang pointod out in a letter to the " Times," thero may be some people so constituted that they are unablo to hoar mysterious noises until their atten- tion has boon called to thom in somo particular way. But* tho correspondent discovered that nobody in tho neighbour- hood kaow anything about the ghostly visitations which tho members of tho Society of Psychical Eesoarch woro in- vestigating. In London the allegations had boen most definite. At Ballochin nothing was known of thom. Nothing was left of tho statomonts which had braced him up during his long railway journey, and led him to expect an en- counter with the supernatural in the interests of truth and journalism. Then ho attacked that solemn body the Society of Psychical Eesoarch, and do scribed its members as listening in fear during tho midnight hours and putting down an ordinary cracklo in tho grnto to somo mysterious power, and taunted them virtually with imagin- ing pnotiomona. So the correspondent departed cheorfully from tho famous castle or mansion of Ballechin, and the sorious part of the businoss, which had nothing to do with ghosts, bogan. Tho ícpoit was ovtdontly too flippant and tho explanation too simple foi the pooplo who had spent thioe montliB in making notes, tho truth of which was attestr-d by twenty witnesses AVoro those twenty obsoivors to bo ignored and then notebooks and declarations and íeports thiust into a lumboi room as being uuvvorthj of publi- cation ? It would bo to ill purpose to speud somo months in n lnunted house amongst tho Scottish moors for such bootless íesult A serious conti ovorsj on the subject was slatted Bul it was complicated at the beginning by a lottei fiom Mi Allots, tho secretary of the Society ot Psychical Etsoarch, who cm distinguish lo»tvveon nijstenous noises as oasily as a ihitiy oxpprt can giade diffeiont kinds of buttei Mi Mjers baid that ho had \isitrd the placo and had como to tho conclusion that tho "phonomona" with which tho pijclncal houso paity had beon concoincd weio not woithy of a lopoitin the proceedings of the society Uns must havo boen a blow to thoso very serious pooplo who had arrayed no less than tw enty w îtnesseï But a vviitei of an analytical tuui of mind, who had boon a visitoi to tho haunted liou<¡e, and who was nppaiently disappointed, asked what ho was to believe, whon some piomi nent membors of tho socioty assoitcd that tho alleged " phonomona " woro fictitious, while othors mnmtaincd that thoy wore leal Mi Mjois, being sorely triol, nnswoied that although tho mombcis of Ins society could not agree upon thoir infoioncos and deductions, they woio 3'et ablo to follow ono mothod ol investigation Tho explanation has not yot boen gn en as lo tho valuo of a mothod that leads to contradiotoiy conclusions, though doubtless it baa some mysterious I worth But, what is of more importance to the observer, the direct evidence of the witnesses is most unsatisfactory Thus, to take but ono oxamplo, a butlor who had boon in tho service of tho ownor of tho house declared that ho novoi hoaid any noises at all another butloi, in tho soi vico of a tenant, wrote to say that at first ho had lioaid nothing, but aftoi somonoeks Ins sloop «as disturbed bv strange noises Who can decide whoio such witnesses disagioe ? It ia in reality a saddoning business Tho public will not bo improssod by the story, and the next occupants will havo no idea «hcthor their nights aro to bo mndo lively and motnoiablo bj inoxplicablo noisos, or «hethor they aro to bo as dull and droarv as dueling days m nutumu But tho discussion has takon a widoi turn lho o«nor wants to kno« «hy his houso has boon turned into a laboiatory for tho Socioty of Psychical lîosearch Ho did not let it for the locordof observations, but for the shooting and fishing on the estote Ile was utterly ignorintof the "uncanny" doings m bis houso until ho load the niticlo in tho " Tunos," and ho complains that without his kno«lodgo and foi no valid reason tho value of his piopoity has boon deproemtnd His caso is in somo rospocts pitiful If tho houso had been íeiillv hauntod, thon all tho people m tho two hemispheres who desired to bo " thrillod by spooks " might havo beon willing to pay a high rent foi it, whoroas at prosont thoio is only about it an unpiofitablo sus picton Somo rogard should certainly be paid to tho rights of the ownor Lord Onslow complains that « hen ho was in Now Zealand a house of Ins « as mado the scone of an o\ponmont by tho Society of Psjchical Research and that ridiculous stones weio sproad It certainty soems loabonablo that if a building is to bo íonted for tho purposo of ghost hunting tho piopnotoi should, be | informed of the objects which the tonants mean to pursue But, judging from tlio scientific explanation that has boen given in tho présent instance, tho ghost seoius to bo worso treated than anyone olso. Tho timo was when he could glido undisturbod in tho twilight among tho ruins of an nnciont abboy. In tho doad hours of night it was befitting for him to visit tho rooms that ho had known in his lifolimo, to troad tho corridors, to knock at doors, and to ennct again the scenes of othor days. His privileges havo boon lakon from him, and no hour of the day or night is loft to him. Whon ovor there is a rumour of mysterious ap- pearances or noises then sooietios and critics and noivspaper correspondents surgo round «-itli an oagornoss of in- quiry that would naturally put the orthodox ghost to flight. But the worst is the man of science. It is said that the noises at Ballechin, which is in a district in Perthshire that occasionally suffers from earthquake shocks, may be due to very slight seismic disturbances. It is only necessary to get instruments that measure minute and rapid vibrations, and then the bogey is ended and the mystery is dispelled. We know not who may be right or wrong ; the controversy is interesting because it has been conducted in the most serious and earnest fashion, as if all the problems of life depended upon some rumours regarding a lonely country house in a remote part of the United Kingdom which is within a seismic area. Of tho making of now editions, ns woll ns of books, there seems to bo no end in these days ; and perhaps somotimes the suffer- ing gonornl render views the first afflic- tion with moro equanimity than the second. Tho stoutest heart may'quail nt the task of trying to koop abreast with tho ovor-owelliug tido of current litera turo ; but an old work in a new form may bo easily digested. After oil, wo need not road it boforo wo discuss it : if the now edition is a voritnblo classic, a com- monplace of ovory library, it is not incumbent over to liavo road it. There aro certain English classics which wo spoak of with reverential awe, and treat witli equally tender noglcct. Is Sterne among this number of slighted immortals ? the book-lover must often wonder. A new edition of his works has boon mooted, nnd tho proposal has boon sufficient to stimu- late curiosity as to the niche in tho temple of literary fame actually hold by " Tristram Shandy " and " A Sentimental Journey." It has boon asked by com- petent critics whether Storno has anything more than an hereditary prestige, whbtbor people read him in tho concreto now ns wolf as appreciate him in tho abstract. This is perhaps so difficult a question to answer that its vory olusivoness suggests its usolessnoss. Boj'ond tho scope of the circulating librarj', thoro aro fow moons of gauging tho circulation of differont sorts of books. AVo can onsily realiso that Mr. Kipling and Mr. Barrie are very popular authors to-day ; but it would bo vory unsafe to ossumo from this know lodge that no ono now roads "The Anatomy of Melancholy," or " Urn-Burial." It is vory probablo that fow do ; but tho vigour of life of a classic is not to bo gauged by any comparative scale. The recollections of it treasured in " ovory lottorod heart " is moro to tho matter. Storno may not bo a great draw on the modern bookstall, any moro thau Eichtirdson, or Fielding, or Addison ; but has ho still a hold on tho literary affections of tho present day, and will ho appeal to any futuro rnco of roadors at all ? Theso aro tho quostions that puzzle tho litterateurs who have been rousod to a fresh consideration bf thoir author by tho talk of a now odition. It is nt least as interesting a phase of literary discussion, this attempt to appio eiato a famous author's leal place after ho lins beon dead over a eoutuiy, as many otheis What gives îoal permanence to nn authoi, so that ho shall be nt once famous and lend, has at all timos been a fascinating inquiry Perhnps at somo timo 01 other wo nil approach the en- tombed gioat ones with an honost desire to moko itheir acquaintance, but in too many cases tho attempt is a foiloin hope Dryden «ns a fino poot, but «hat tiuo modoru thinks of him in tho samo mental bi oath, so to speak, as Tennyson ?

But his astonish- ing and unique power of perceiving tho affecting in the ludicrous, his wonderful abrupt transitions from tho vulgar and lo«' to tho tragic, his profound anil suro knnivledgo of a few coinpoiiont strings that play upon tho heart, his humour and his knowledge of life,-suroly tho combi- nation of all theao rare qualities will not be viewed coldly in a futmo day. Soma of his sconos and detached passages aio uko life itsolf in the sonso of the absoluto verisimilitude which they call up ; and if ho employed his asterisks too often and too flagrantly, it should bo remembered that ho invontod his oivii style, and per- haps considered that ho had a porfect right to uso his own paton t. Moreover, it is tho vervwnnt of reserve on some subjects that makes Storno so profound a student in " the propor study of mankind "-Man.
