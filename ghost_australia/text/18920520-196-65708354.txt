S "Harmlet." " - r :Slhskespeare's lot = was i cast .ifi a happy period for the, full developmhent of hi's marvellous genius. Bad he lived thirty years before -le must have beed affected by the false euphemistic Ian. guago. and manners of the time, and which he so finely ridicules ill " Love's Ieabour Lost" and others of his plays. IInd-he been born during the, periflt when Charlds.J infringed upon coosti tutional practice, he woult have probably beeil drawn into that political strife and' struggle which separated friends and' sundered familics into hostile fragments. The peri d of Eliznbe:h, however, as has been frequently remarked, was fruit ful soil wherein the genuis of the poet could find root and flourish. What, then,' particunarlystrack men, and Shakespeare recognised it in.its fullest signilicance, was the breaking away fl.oi the old tra dition that deep learning could only be acquired by quiet seclusion and retire.. ment in the nooks- of monastic cells. Action and culture began to' be com bired. A kind of muscular Christianity sprang up. Men oft the Sir Philip Sidney and the Ri.loigh stamp were living exemplifications of the fact that learning, and bustle and connection with the outside world were quite compatible. The age of Shakespeare was one of great activity, a tiine when men of enterprise we re reqired; when matters of great pitch and moment were in full. swing. . Prospero represents the lingering glimpses of ungic superstitious arts in sinuating themselves into the-mind of a man of culture and refinement. Lapsing into studious habits, the'deposed duke forgot that acthn was necessary to pre serve himself from harm. Much the same will apply to Hamiet, lnbut the theme is placed on a more sublime level. Here was a prince of aboeit thirty years of *age, a time when the idealities of youth melt into thepr actical realities of manhood, or, as John Morley puts it in his brilliant essay on Jiurke, " The age when character usually either fritters itself away or grows strong on the in ward sustenance of solid and resolute aspirations." Hamlet, a prince, heir apparent to a throne, had spent his life in the studious calm of Wittenberg Uni versity, had apparently dived deep into the mystery surrounding the destiny of mar, had, with the wholesome egotismn of a young man, imbued himself with the idea that'he would set reforms at work to clear: away the clouds of abuse and allow all the sunshine of life to have free play. His life at the University was diversified by his fondness for the. theatre,. where his criticisms must have been apt and wise, judging by his mem orable advice to the players. At thirty years of :age he arrived home.- His father had died suddenly. His mother had marriedr his uncle. .Hamlet had been judging .the :world from .his owin standard point, had' been:, thinking noble tiohughts,.- bhad?een gathering.to gether '~igh ,inisided' -priaieplesiaind dto, award; suostenasnc f i:L ?........ ebi.e. aspirations:" '?iuch'sa nii;' as iHfimlet always, takes too ihigh :in estimate of0 things.

Hence his excla mation : "The time isnot L of joint, O, cursed spite, i ,That ever I was born to set, it right." is quite reasonable and to he expected fronm one of his temperament. This is considered by Goethe to-be the keynote of the play. Hamlet recognises his duty but doubts his ability to perform it. Here then was Shakespeare's l:ur pose. Hamlet studious, cultured, refined, must enter into action. Is his soul fit for the performance of it. Goothe says not. Hamlet has not the nerve, the nrve which makes a heroe.

This must rouse the fires of suspicion, slumbering in the mineu of Clodius into flame How can this be averted ? By the assuumption of mad; .ncss.

SHamlet's knowledge of actiing stands him now in good stead. He acts the part of a imadmann to' perfection. 'lThere is indeed a method in his mad ness. Hamlet's treatment of. Ophelia has been condemned as harsh and ill inanered. lint really this i. part of the character he is playing; and is one .of the most effective strokes, since it may divert suspicion from the cause of HIamlet's melancholy, and assign it to his love for Ophelia.

It is with difficulty that he coin trols his bitterness againsth is mother, in compliance with the beheste of the ghost. But even this restraint breaks down in AoT iI, wheor lie and higs mother meet face to face. His fiorce, just indignation denotrs so much sense and reason as to alnmot make the Queen believe him ' sane. Hamlet marks the effect, whicl would destroy hlis pur pose. He must disguise himself in niad ness, and the.ghost once more walks its melancholy way.

Lot n11 clone by quoting from Coleridge, what to my mind sums up thecharacter of " Haimlet " in words of much wisdom " Shakespeare wi.iced to impress upon us the truth that action is the ohiel end of existence, that no faculties of intellect however brilliant caln be considered valuable or, indeed, otherwise than as misfortunes if they withdraw us from' or render tis repugnant to action and lead us to think, and thinking of doing until the time ihas elapsed when we can. dao anything effectually. Hamlet was continually resolving, yet did nothingg but resolve."
