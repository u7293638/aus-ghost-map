He -is either insincere, or is coating the 'Liberals of the colony, bound hand and foot, into the toils of the men who hold, and who want permanently to lock up, the very lands which he professes to be anxious to rescue fror» the syndicate. The wave of mere- tricious public opinion which lie has fabri- cated by exhibiting the frightful ghosts of syndicates and black men may carry lum safely to the Treasury benches, but the con- sequences,, in the case of his eventual success in crippling the sugar planters and burking th« Transcontinental project, will be disastrous? to his reputation as- a public man, and seriously detrimental to the colony. The City Coancil are making slew pro- gress with the tramway question, but their report of last week, which is set down for consideration to-day, evidences that they have been making some usefulinvestigations, and have arrived at some definite conclusions on the subject. Their resolution to apply for an Order-in-Council to construct a tram« way through the principal line of traffic from "Woolloongabba to the intersection of Wickham-street with the Breakfast Creek- road seems a proper one. It might be very inconvenient for the public were the route indicated in the hands of three distinct tram- way authorities, as in that case tickets might not be interchangeable in the different sec- tions, and everyone coming into town from the suburbs might be required to pay double fare. .For example, a persomgetting on the cars at Woolloongabba would.proceed just two-thirds of a mile and theiij unless the different authorities could otherwise agree, have to pay again on entering the city boundary ¡it the junction of Vulture and Stanley streets. In the same way a pentan coming from beyond the Valley would be required to pay afresh on crossing the boundary in Wickhaiu-street. Moreover,, difficulties might arise from the conflict of time-tables which would seriously incommode' the traffic. It may be replied that the bodies exercising jurisdiction need only display a little connuon- sense to prevent friction of the kind indicated ; but those who have had experience of local authorities in their mutual intercourse, and who know tlio extreme difficulty of securing reciprocal action among them, would not like to-be responsible for the fantastic tricks which might be indulged in under the influence of local jealousy. It is obviously better that the contemplated tramway should be in the hands of a single authority, and as each local body will collect rates on that portion of the line which runs within their jurisdic- tion it is not at all requisite in respect of construction that there should be more than one finger in the pie. It is an open question whether the enterprise should be engaged in by the authorities at all, but, assum- ing the affirmative, the metropolitan council is evidently best fitted to incur the responsibility. The total distance is little more than three and a-hnlf miles, and the estimated cost at "£5000 a mile only ¿£18,33.). Allowing that the total cost, with rolling stock, including cars, &c;, would be "£25,000, the amount payable to the Colonial Treasurer under the Local Works Loans Act would be only ¿£1050 a-ycav, which in the term of twenty-one years would liquidate both interest charges and the principal sum, and leave the council in possession of a remunerative properly free from debt. And oven if the tramway failed to yield ¿2000 a-year piofit at first, it would .save the council a considerable sum every year in street maintenance, and in that way the undertaking would be indirectly remunerative. There is much to be said in favour of the tramway being undertaken bj* the local authorities in preference to a joint stock company, and it is amusing to lind Mr. Griffith and other public men who profess strong opposition to railways being controlled by syndicates desirous of the principal streets of the city falling under the domination of private companies. We do not think it material by whom tram- ways are undertaken, so long as the con- structing authority under the Order- in Uouncil satisfies the Government and the public of the- aeli'nuacy of the plans, and of their ability to oury out the work. If the City Council aro willing the Governor-in-Council has the money available, and the undertaking may be com- menced and completed without delay. It is not, wo understand, the intention of the council to work the line, but to maintain it in effective repair, and lease it for the ptn poses of traffic under pioper regulations. And asno special rate will be necessary for the work, the ratepayers need not appre- hend that the burden of taxation will be increased by the tramway. No interest or redemption payments will be demanded until the line begins to earn money, when it seems impossible th.it the net earnings should be insufficient to fully protect the taxpayers. While on this subject we may refer to an error, as we hold it to be, in the council's scheme The doublo line, and not a single one merely, should be carried across the bridge. There should be another lloor laid over the entire road sur- face of the structure, which should be as even as it is now, the only difference noticeable being four small grooves of ono mid one-eighth of an inch wide. Wero a single line alone laid down, the tramway surface would be at least au inch or two higher than the rest of the bridge lloor, which would be unsightly ¡is well as incon- venient to traffic. With a uniform level the whole surface would bo available for ordi- nary vehicles at all times except when the cars were actually p.issing, so that tho interruption to traffic would not be greater than at present occurs with the omnibuses. Resides the tramway would much relieve the ordinary vehicle ti.illic. Again, with ¡i single line the tranieiirs them- selves would be often delayed, because no two cars coining from opposite directions could be on the bridge at the same time. We trust this view of the matter will receive full consideration. If the council become the constructing authority they would do well either to procure the services of ¡i tramway engineer from South Australia or Xew Zealand, or send the city engineer to one or oilier of those colonies to ¡icquiro practical information on the subject. The council ought not to enter upon tramway construction until they have taken mensures to profit by the expérience gained at great expenso elsewheie in pro- viding this improved mean» of locomotion.

Yesteuday moi nmg about half past 6 the steward of the ship Doris Biodcrmm, which was moored in the river on Satin day morning opposite to Gibljs, Bi ight and Co 's wharf, dis- covered s fit o amongst tho caigo in the forchold. The alarm was given to tho master, Captain Neilson, anil tho crew, and to the other ships lying at the whancs and in the mer. The captains, othcers and crews of the other vessels weic very speedily on board the Dons Bro dcr<en, bringing with them-forcing pumps and othei appliances for the extinguishment of tire Captains Cater, Littler, Brand, and Har- burg, and the chief officer of the J R Pen- dergast rendered good sei nee, but not until the fire engine belongil); to the Brisbane Fire Brigade arrived and was got to ivoik was it that any perceptible effect was prtidhced. The alarm was gn cn at the station about a quarter past 7, and by half past 7 t^e brigade m charge of Messrs Hinton and Walsh had the engine on board a coal punt ard alongside the ship. Mr. E. Mac Donnell, of thp Fire Brigade Board, was also there After boles had been bored in the deck and a copious deluge of water discharged into the hold, the hatches were remoicd, and the hose waa taken below. The heat of the deck was very perceptible, and when the firemen went below they fonnd it necessary to coi er over their mouths and nostrils on account of tho dense steam and smoke After lal oui mg very hard, the biigadc, with tlie united help of the crew of the ship and the men belonging to the other vessels, were- successful m their efforts, and the fire was arrested without any serious damage to the cargo The principal injury to the cargo has been caused by watei The zeal and activity of the firemen is lughl) si oken of by Captain Neilson and by Captain Brown, Lloyd's Surveyor, who wis soon on board the ship Where credit is due it ia only just to give it, and the captain of the Dons Broderscn haa promptly thanked the Fire Brigade for their exertions) The mon were hard at work from half past 7 until half past 1, and did not leave the ship dntil all danger was past The steam lighter Louisa was taken alongside the ship, and the damaged caigo remoicd A large portion of the cargo in the forchold consisted of oilmen's stores, and it was fortunate that the fire was subdued in time, or the linseed oil and many other highly inflammable goods would have been on hie and nothing could have saved the 8hipi The cause of the fire up to the present remains a mystery, but it must have originated m the fore compartment, which is used for the storage of sails and rope, and has an iron bulkhead forward and a wooden one aft, separating it from the cargo. This compartment can onl) be entered by the fore hatch, which »as scaled up in Moreton Bay on tho 13th instant Captain Neilson is of opinion that the faro had been smouldering for some time, and that the lifting of the hatches m Moi eton Bay on the 23th instant to discharge 25 tons of pou dei, illoired a cm rent of air to pass tin ough the hold, a Inch fanned the smouldering embers into a flame Captain Wyborn, the hal bom mastc, and Mr. Burrell, the liqiudatoi m tlie estate of Messis.
