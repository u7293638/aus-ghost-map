ORIGINAL CORRESPONDENCE. THE LATE LOCAL COURT. To the Editor of tlit Be.ndigo Advertiser. Sir,—In your issue of the 22nd of August, 1856, something better tlmn two years and two months ago, a correspondent signing1 himself a "Pick and Shovel M.m," on the occasion of the first sitting of the Sandhurst Local Court—the first dttbut, as it were, of the late judiciary-like institu tion — ventured through the columns of the Advertiser (then a tri-weekly), and after a careful perusal of the then new Goldfields Act, and a quiet reading of the Goldfield* Commission Report, to express his conviction, auguring unfavorably of the operations of the nowly'ilcdged Local Court, which held its first sittings in the Chambers of tha Resident Warden on the Ilth of the ahovenamed month and year, predicting it an abortion, and unsuited to the exigencies of the times and the then condition of the goldfields, and calculated to soon die out of itself, and in all probability by a natural death too. I1o\y far the prediction of " Piok and Shovel Man" has come to pass in the recent melancholy suicide of the late Local Court your readers and the public may decide; certainly the prediction is not verified so far as a natural death is concerned, for the recent suicide must be pronounced in every sense of the word an " un natural death,"—at least a coroner and jury ivould put it down as such. The arguments employed by " Pick and Shovel Mas" were to the efleet that the measure was radically defective, not only as it applied to the constitution of Local Courts, but to all the leading poiuts of the new Goldfields Bill itself, which has been constructed evidently by persons totally ignorant of the real wants and requirements of the goldfields, and who had more or Jess misconstrued and misapplied many important (depositional, exceptional, and suggestive) portions of the Goldfields Commission ltoport, in carrying out the anomalous details of what might be termed their obstructive bill; but as the arguments on which those comments have been grounded are probably of too abstruse and-jjllemiottl a nature to enter into in detail, in the coUmins of a newspaper, I shall merely remark that-'thc prediction then entertained has in little better than two years come to pass nearly to the letter, and the Local Court is now no mote. Only two sbort years 1ms it figured on the stage of life, and then passed away by a deliberate net of sui cide on the part of its late members, to bo nut)i bered with the shadows of futurity, and to be recorded on the page of history among the things " that were." Alas ! lempora mutuittur. How far the gentlemen forming the late Local Court have been justified in the step they have taken, and in thus recklessly deserting their posts and their constituents in the hour of need, is a question on which a great diversity of opinion exists, and presents many grave and important consideration's. It Local Courts, and all such similar institutions!, are to be mere vehicles of flippancy, and a sort of rostrum or theatre as it wero for men to exhibit both the vanity and weakness of their nature, and without any due regard or proper respect for the interests of their constituents, and the public at largo, in a moment of caprice to put hand to their own life, and fling their resignations in the face of the Government, their abolition is a benefit to (lie community, and their existence should never have been tolerated on such a basis, and presents a practical and instructive illustration of the blun derings of legislations and legislators, and the torpor of mining communities and their represen tatives. The late Lncal Court members have been going about since their resignation, advocating the course they have pursued, in voluntarily resigning the important trusts confided to their keeping by the people—(in other words, blowing their own trumpets),—and also in advocating the claims of the Local Court as an institution. Now, ;.f the Local Court, as a public institution, be all they represent it, it seems a piece of gross inconsistency, and superlativo folly on their part, to have taken the course they have thought proper to pursue. It is like unto a man being provided with a good and trusty sword to defend himself and household against all injustice and aggression, yet, when an enemy appears before him, lie turns on his heel, throws away his good and trusty sword, and retreats into the innermost chamber of his house hold, and calls his people together and informs them that the enemy is at the gate ; and that he has thrown away his sword (his only defence), and is consequently unable to fight ; and then edifies them with a description of its virtues. The Local Court members have been respec tively returned b}- miniugjconstituencies, the same as members of Parliament or Municipal Town Councils, and duties equally as arduous and honorary have devolved on them to perform. That they have been recently placed in a somewhat critical position, it must be confessed, through the tergiversation of the Resident Warden 011 the one hand, and the " knock me down" stunning-like assumption of jpower of. Chinese Protector on the other hand,—not to speak of the threatened invasion on the part of the Government and their new Goldfields Bill,—and no doubt between the fires of these two official sreat guns, and the destroying angel in the dis tance, the seats of the Local Court members were beginning to get hot enough, and doubtless they considered it better to die by their own hands than to give up the ghost in a fair stand up " heel to toe'' fight, though it is generally believed had they shown a little more pluck and possessed the requisite courage to have only shaped themselves, and put away the white, feather altogether, they would in all probability have won the day,—who can tell ? They might and they might not have won, for in all local machinery there are often in visible wheels, and wheels within wheels, that are the prime movers of the machine, and at the same time invisible to superficial eyes. Some of the quidnunc's infer that this invisible agency would have in any case given tho Loeal Courtites a coup de qracc, and made it next to impossible for them to "have won the battle. Be this as it may, the prestige is certainly hot in favour of the Local Court members or the course pursued by them on the present occasion. Like a city besieged, and at the first summons of surrender from the besie gers, they have cowardly capitulated and deserted their ctf'ors on the ramparts, and thrown them selves on the clemency of the enemy, when they should have stood out to the last man and even fired the very button? off their coats, in defence sf their liberties and of the trust confided to thoir keeping by their brother diggers and mining constituents: how they "will manage to reconcile their conduct before the inoro intelli gent portion of their constituent! remains to be seen. Of course, there are at all times "flats' and " asses" in abundance, to be had for the drawing together, and, like herring* in a barrel or onions on a string, you have only to stoop down and pick them up by dozens, or take hold of them by the tails or the end of tho string and draw them after Vou in scores and by hundreds, and subserve them for every purpose you wish, and which they may seem bast adaptable and suited to apply to. These "flats" and "asses," too, would give ynu^ three times three iCr the livelong diurnal hours if you were only to tell them off a table or a chair that the moon was made of green cheese, and that the late Solomon Lobb's uncle wa« a member of the (used-to-be) Local Court. The ex-Local Oourt members, however, have promptly appeared to render an account of their stewardship, and, heaveu help them, how they have managed to stand uncovered in the presence even of the herrings and the onions, and to bay forth unto the moon their tale of a naughty Warden and a pig-tail Pro tector, is more than their best friends can telland now that they have received the applause and approbation of (the herrings and onions- like por tion of) their constituents, and whatever maybe the ultimate intentions of the said fish and vegetable like constituents to present their Local Court ex members, who have so nobly represented them and their interests in the councils of ths Court— whether with a banquet fitting the oceasion, or a piece or service of plate, or even' a nngget itself, let every loval subject of our dearly-beloved Queen and every patriotic mau on Bendigo say with a sincere heart to every individual member who committed suicide on the recent occasion in the Local Court, llrnnii'Sntd in pace, and una voce let the epitaph be inscribed over the tomb of all collectively, "Here lieth Caput mortuum et vo.v et pnw.tP.rea nihil ' A. PICK AN'D SHDVF.L MAN.
