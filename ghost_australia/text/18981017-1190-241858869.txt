To tho Editor of "The Herald." Sir,— In his letter described tho case of a lady who could see her deceased husband and bear his voice, .etc. Just fancy a ghost with lungs, and forcing Uic air through tho mouth, and modulated Into speech by tho tongue, as mankind do. It Is the stamp epi sode of that honest writer, Thos. I'earce, over again. ! will give a story of qulto a different lady. In the part of the old country where f came from, stories about ghosts, spirits, and fairies, was an every day conversation. Thero 1 know an old Indy of about &5 years of age. In conjunction with a numbor of other children, wo went to tho old lady to hear como of her great experience about ghosts, and shu an swered thus:— Well, children, I cannot say that I saw anything of the like myself, but I onco was slaying with ootne friends, and I saw thorn a man 111 and in bed, and be told mo that he could sco spirits, but I was told that he drank a large quantity of whisky. Which plainly ac counts. as ono-wriler said, for tho milk in tho coca&nut.; Now this old Indy's oxperlenco Is exactly my own, and not only mine, but that of every sensible person with whom I ever conversed, and If I travollrel tho world over unlit I roncbn.il tho age of 10, and conversed with all I met, I f'-el perfectly confident I would get from every one of them who had sound bodily health, tho samo answer na that given by the old lady. Mr Taylor states that ho can both sec and hold convcrso with enti tles or disembodied spirits, but ho doos not i say how he docs this. To my nnnd it th only the stamp pplBodo repeated. If Mr Taylor wishes pooplfi who arc not so gifted to be- llrvo him. let him describe in plain, practical language his method of calling up tho spirits from the vasty deep, and seeing and holding: converse with thorn, and thus teach us to bo- como as wiso us hlmsolf.— I am, etc., J.P.
