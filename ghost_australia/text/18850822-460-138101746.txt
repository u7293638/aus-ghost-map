VICTORIA AMATEUR TURF CLUB MEETING. SATCUDAT, AUGUST 15. Stewards-Hon. \V. Pearson, Messrs. A. IU Blackwood, J. L. Purves, H. Wisher, and M. O'Shanassy. Judge-Mr. G. Vowles. Starter -Mr. G. Watson. Handicapper- Mr. E. T. Barnard. Secretary-Mr. N. K. D. Bond. The Victoria Amateur Turf Cinb is seldom fortunate iu the matter of weather, and Saturday last was no exception to the rule. Fortunately it waa fine until an hour after noon, though lowering clouds denoted a showery day, and a goodly company had as sembled at Caulfield ere the first shower fell. Of -all Victorian courses that of the V. A.T.C. is the most comfortable under the dispiriting influence of rain, because the sandy nature of the soil prevents any accumulation of mud, so that, under foot at all events, visitors are free from inconvenience. The showers that fell were not frequent, but they prevented the ladies from showing themselves upon the lawn, and those who had secured seats in the stand remained there throughout the day. The new shilling stand outside was opened for the lirst time, but those present studiously avoided it, and the receipts from this source could scarcely have paid for the caretakers. There was a large attendance, however, and we believe the funds of the club received a welcome increase. The addition to the grand stand in the principal enclosure was patronised during the running of each race, and as this with the other put of the building was quite full when the Grand National Steeplechase was run, Mr. Bond and his committee may rest assured that even this addition to the accommodation will not prove more than sufficient for the Guiueas and Cup days. His Excellency Sir Henry Loch drove to the course, and was ac companied by his two eons. The first race set down for decision was the Sapling Stakes, and for this a field of 22 was announced, amongst them being several that had already appeared in pnblic, notably Edith, Uranus, ana Louise Berta. Among those that made their first appearance in public was Gari baldi, who waa said to be better than Edith, but Jones, it was whispered abroad, had made no mistake when he at Moonee Valley pronounced Louise Berta a first-class filly. Another Caalfield representativethatcreatcd a favourable impression was Manxman II., who had been tried well over the three furlongs, and was backed by his owner and friends. Anita was looked upon as the best of the Fiemington division, and accordingly she received plenty of support She iB a small but very smart-looking chestnut filly. Crack nell had been retained to ride her, but as he missed the train, a very able substitute waa found in Sanders. The Williamatown stable was represented by a racing-like filly in Aspramonte, who, it was reported, had done all that she had been asked on the course by the sea, and plenty ot money was invested in her favour. Soveral others were backed by their respective admirers, but for money Louise Berta was a betfcerfavourite than anything else. When they assembled at the post they gave Mr. Watson some trouble, and Myna broke away for nearly half a mile on her own account Eventually they were de spatched to a pretty even start, with the exception that Manxman IL took it into his head to remain at the post nntil the others bad got so far. away that pursuit was hope less. Among the first on her legs was Anita, but she immediately gave a couple of bucks, and so sudden was the effort that Sanders was nearly unseated. By this little freak Sir William Clarke's filly lost several lengths. LouiBe Berta always held a prominent po sition, and when fairly in the straight she shot out with such a lead that the race was at once seen to be at her meccy. Her jockcy j evidently was under this impression, for he left off riding, and was taking matters very j easily when Edith came with a wonderful rush, and the boy on Louise Berta hadj barely time to commence again, and get home i by the shortest of heads. Mr. L. L. Smith j was heartily congratulated npon the success! of bis filly, who was bred in South Australia by Sir ThomaB Elder. -She is by the Mel bourne Cup winner Darriwell, whose first season foals (now two rear olds) would be creditable to any sire in toe world. Her dam, Alethe, is by Gang Forward from Azema, by the Flying Dutchman from Arrogante, who runs back to the famous marelmperiDuse. With only four struck out of the Hurdle Race, 13 went to the post The appearance of Corrig&a; in the colours of Huntsman was the signal for a rash on to the Brighton trained horse, whoaoon went to a ebortprice, The Caulfield division were sweet upon Hippo griff, wbobecame second favourite. The Agent never, perhaps, presented a brighter and more thoroughly-brained appearance, and there was not the slightest trace of the prevailing epidemic. Nevertheless, 5 to 1 was to be obtained without any difficulty, this price being laid in hundreds before the horses left the paddock. Cripps had Duration in splendid condition, ana as he had been jumping well, a good deal of monor was invested in his behalf. Star, Guardtish, and the others were all looking well, but there was only one in the race, and that one was the top-weight, who made a pretty example of those opposed to him. Ace made the pace, and the first to coine to grief was The Ghost, but Batty fortunately escaped without injury. Then Ace came down a terrible cropper at the back of the course, and young Cope was stunned for a time, and had to be placed in the ambulance waggon. Meanwhile, The Agent, who had been running last, gradually made up his leeway, Ferguson showing excellent judg ment by the manner in which he saved ground. Duration was going strong and well, and in the bend, where Raven, Dura tion, Huntsman, and The Agent were.all <jf a bunch, the top-weight assumed command directly Ferguson asked bim. Coming away as be liked, he cantered past the post the easiest of winners, Ferguson patting him approvingly upon the neck as he approached the goal. An easier victory with a heavy weight has never been accomplished -so easy, indeed, that there can be no two opinions as to which is now the best hurdle racer of the day. Mr. Hart was not present to see bis wonderful little hone win, but we believe he backed him for a good stake. Only Cincinnatus and Breeze came, to the post lor the Selling Bace, and they Jaid 6 to4 pn Cin cmnatua when it ought to have been 10 to' 1 on Breeze. The result was that the layers of; the odds lost their money, and the, Breeae Wrty looked juj>iltui$.
