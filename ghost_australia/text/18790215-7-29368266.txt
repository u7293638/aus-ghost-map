The Advertiser. SATURDAY, FEBRUARY 15, 1879. In another column we publish a letter signed "Opposition," taking exception to a lender which appeared in this journal nearly a month ago, and two letters written by co—c one adopting the- tio?i de plume of **■ Traveller" that have been published sin es^ commenting veiy unfavorably upon the wine-shops in the country districts of this province. We will make the preliminary observation that it is very easy for a cer i—poodent under the shelter of an adopted signature to impute interested motives, to persons -with whom he differs in opinion, when the readers of his e_csio-ns have no positive means of knowing whether he has cr has not a person—-, oon cern in the subject about which he declaims with so much warmth. "Opposition" states that general assertions, of a damaging character respecting the beve rage sold at wiiie -shops are quite " readily and industriously made ani cir culated by those interested, in the beer monopoly and their follovrers," &-;. We thiuk it hardly necessary to- assure our readers, sf what "Opposition" iaall proba bility is himself fully— sured, that we have no cunctin in the l:er ti_dr*, aju-'i lcs3 in any monopoly connected with malt liquor--, and we can po_ir~ly state that "Traveller"' is as free as ourselvos from any share in a? profitable a traflk. Whether "Opposition' is deeply affected by anything likely either fe? hamper or to facilitate the colotral wine trade is a question upon which we* mast leave our readers to form the"*r ow_ con clusions from the tone of his ep:si"e, ITe challenges us to prove that wines nsnally sold at the shanties known as wine- shops are often immature, sometimes corrupt, and commonly strongly fortified. To prove this alsol—e!y would require that we should, en-plfty some one to visit these pla *es and bring away samples of the liquor, a task we do r.ot f.el called up_i to undertake at prrsent. Oar statements were b_ _ upan nlformation received from various poisons during a series of years who hive visited these shops and tried the liquors. We ipw observe, tm. thit 'Traveler,* 10 cur knowledge, has exceptional opportu nities for observing what is drunk acd what goes on generally at these places all over the colony. The peculiar effect of the liquor in so many cases up-)a those who drink it is another indication o" its quality. The probabilities are in favor of it being of ai inferior or hurtf ol character *t*Pir-3 shop-. when we consider that a large propori'-in, probably the greater number of them- are kept by persons whose knowledge of wine is about on a pa? with that of the "Victo rian black?—low who, after swallowlu? a tumbler of vinegar, eicia _ed, "My word.' benyjgood that one; ma know urn - him col—lial wine." The EUffgestion that if the wine at the?? places k so bad the police should seize it and have it analysed, aid that if it were found to be deleterious or unwholesome then the guilty persons should be prose cuted, sounds Terr feasible, but would in reality hardly meet the requirements of the case. The law allows colonial wine con taining 35 p_ cent, of firoof spirit to ha sold at licensed houses, and liquor of t"sis potency is likely to have a most unde sirable effect upon persons who drink it almost as freely as if it were lager beer Then, unless drugs are detected in wine' who is to decide whether it is deleterioas or unwholesome? A Bench of Magis trates would not necessarily be guided by an analysis. A Redlabile J.P. would iugift upon it that the finest claret or hock or sparkling Mosdle ever imported is rank poison; another of the great unpaid, with a ca-t-iron stomach, would laugh at the notion of any alcoholic drink hurting anybody; a third magistrate perhaps would, like the ii — Mr. Hogarth, sneer at science alto gether. Even scientists differ upon the question ofsScolio_ liebig speaks of win ? as tbe milt of the aged. Dr. Kichardsaa condemns it as a beverage, and hardly tolerates it as a tonic. For adulteration j with a noxious ingredient a wiaeseller might be punished, hut it would be difficult for tbe liw to deal with the unwholesomeness that simply arises out of some defect in the manu facture from the pure juice of ths grape. The customers must decide as to the quality, provided they are protected from the fraud of adulteration. It is nit mainly because of the character of tha liquor sold at most country wine-shops tb.it we believe their abolition would be a public benefit, but because these establishments are out of the way of regulur police control and great evils are connected with tb e_, as the reports of the Commissioner of Poli-e have more than onca^ testified. Thefa_ that a taste for good -wines is not pro moted by these shops is an additional reason, however, why their suppression would be regarded with general satis faction. We do not agree with "Traveller" tbat they should ba abolished all over the colony; but it would be well if they were not permitted where they cannot be kept under proper supervision. The quantity and proportion of palatable, wholesome wine produced in the colony is increasing, but in the shanties we speak of the better kinds are rarely if ever found. '• Opposition" attributes to us an assertion that the same wins cannot be got a second time. We said nothing of the sort; what we stated was that the principal reason why attempts to establish a trade in the old country for our wines had failed was that we could not supply one sort in sufficient quantity. If there is now a large accumu lation of good South Australian wines of certain kinds, that is a proper cause for £. —action, but we-3poJ—-of the state of affairshitherto, and that ocr statement was correct is known to every one-who has tried to induce J—ndon merchants to purchase ibe wines of thin colony.. The unfortunate dim ster to the I3riti<*U troops in South Africa evidently continues to cause much cx__me— in England, which the length of time that must elapse before any farther intelligence reicue^ London will not tand to les—n. Earl Beaconsfield, in referring to the affair in the House of Lords, has, the telegraph informs ue, assured the aatioa that the disaster.wall be fully wip„ out, and if the British are to maintain tlie'r position in South Africa there can ba vo doubt that neither men nor money must be spared in stiiking an effective and crus'iing •hiowat the power of the natives. The task may he a dUScult. but it has became now an absolutely. _—sssary one. The . Earl at the aamettme took occasion, by way ; presun\ably of a. set-off, to refer to the recent success of- the British arms in Afghanistan, saying that the object cf the expedition had been achieved by the re „ifi calion of the fronti—vof British India and the preservation of the independence of Afghanistan. While- it is tincereLy to ha j hoped that events will prove Eail J— ■_ons- field to be correct ibihts view of the position in A fghaniataa it must be confes—d that his remarks surely are prophetical.

At the meeting of the Board of Mana.e meet of tbe Add—de Ho:-pii_, on Friday*, it was decided to increaie'the honorary medical staff by tbe appointment of two new mem'—ij, making the total number seven. Notice* of motion for the nest meiting were given to the eSect that in eleoting additional mciicil offiaers preference should be given to graduate} of a British University or members of one of the Boyal Colleges off Physicians, and that ia future the term for which honorary medical o_c_a are elected shall hi limited to five years, sabje— to such arrangements for retirement and re election sa may be derided by the Board of Management, The Ik-itbouse on Althorpe Island has recently been completed, aid tbe light was ] exhibited for the first time on Friday n'-jht, February I*, in tbe presence of the menit-irs* of' the Marine B_rd, who were down tbere ia the Governor Musgrave for the piuvcse. Tiie light, which is a very powerful one, is erected ou the' southern point of the big Althoroe, tbe largest of the rocky islands of tbat name. The dis tance between the light on Cape Borda aad the nt* light is about 30 miles. Ihe islands are of banltic rosk, capped with lime—one, the only vegetation oeinga few stunted shrubs and coarse grass. The precipitous sides of the island i rise nearly 100 feet from tbe sea. and landing is usually effected on the north east side, where tbere is a little cove The advantages of tbe new light wiU be very great to mariners, tot while the well- know a Borda light will enable them to avoid the dan gerous rock-bound coast of Kangaroo I_snd, that now erect— will a*_ist them in steering dear of tbe shoals and shifting sands off the coast of Southern Forte's Peninsula. The light wa* plainly visible from Cape Borda ou Friday night. The surrey of the Hallett Railway extension line bas been commenced. A poll is to taike place to-day at Port Adelaide to decide whether the street* of the municipality are to be watered with salt —t:r or not. The Superintendent of Telegraphs sends us the following information received from Port Macquarie:—"Steamer Balliiia total wreck on bar bete." The -m—fall between 9 a.m. on Thursday and the same hour on Friday is registerd as follows:—Charlotte Waters, 0105. At the meeting of the Port Adelaide Corporation on Friday evening, Febru-i-y t4, it was decided to write to tbe Gaveronieit asking them to light St. Vincent street with gas. The residents of North Adelaide, Port Adelaide and its sab—-ban districts, also those living along the Poit-roai, are reminded that he water will be abut off from these places be tween the hours of 2 and 7 p.m. to day. On Friday afternoon the large tramcar wbich has been obtained by the Government for use ou the Gawler T——.way, was sent alons the line by way of trial. "We understand that regu lar passenger traffic is to be cmcuneuced oa Monday. The adjourned meeting of the subscribers to the Glenelg Institute was held at the Insti tute ou Friday even'ug, February 14. There was a modeiate attendance. Mr. W, E. Wigley, J.P- presided. The report and bilanc: phest for the past year were adopted, and the officei j for the next year were elected. The City Coroner will hold an enquiry at 10 o'clock this morning in the Ejard Boom of the Peimai.—it Equitable Building Society into the circumstances attending tbe fire whichoc-surred | in the Adelaide Photographic Company's esta blishment, King William-street, on Monday night. The members of the newly-formed com pany of riflemen iv connection with the Civil Service met for drill on Friday al>3-ac >n at the Drill-shed, Korth-tanacs. There were 25 gentlemen present, who were put through squad and marching drill by one of tlieGoveintnent instructors. They acquitted them—lyes very creditably. An inquest is to be held on Monday next -it 10 o'clock p.m. at Mrs. Brewer's wineshop, Creenhil'-road, on the fire which took place on Mr. Davenport's property. Tbe Coroner will be glad if persons who can give evidence tbat will throw light ou the origin of the fire, and who may not ba communicated with by the police, will aliend the inquest. The bad state of the streets at Port Ade laide seems likely to be soon altered. At a meeting of the Corporation on Friday evening it was resolved to expend £2fiX> in metalling and properly finishing the principal stre_3 in the town. There is no doubt that the action of the Council in this matter will cause great satisfaction, as the Port has got a very bad name for the bad condition of its streets. It was reported to the City Coroner on Friday that a _Mrs. Lydia Wood, ajed Oi, residing in Kensington-road, had died suddenly, and that gentleman on making enquiries ascer tained that the deceased had been out of health for some time. Dr. Baily, whs was called iv to see ber, but found her dead, was of opinion that death bad beeu causei by heiri dtssaie. The Coroner considered it unnecessary ta hold an inquest. The works aud sheds which are being erected at Kilkenny in connection with the Adelaide and Port Adelaide Brictanaking Com pany are making good progress, aud it is ex pected that everything will be ready for a com mencement in about two months hence.

It bas therefore had st least j three months subjection to tbe p„*i___l in fluence of a aea voyage. The toba _o was pro nounced by competent jadges on Friday morning to be entirely fiee Cram the pernicious effects _—lyto _s—i to inferior brands of tobacco -__arly.—eated. At the i_ta_eof Mr. Geo. Morgan, tiie health of the firm, coupled with the «—m «f the manager, Mr. Lawrence, was drunk in bempers of champagne; and _.c forea-uus, Mr. Asprey, was also complimented upon the sat—factor-** j-harfi--***' of the manufast—e. Mr. _aw__e^e visi—_ subsequently inspected the laetory.ai— expressed themselves highly pleased trith tbe management of tbe various processes. A deputation, consistiing of Mr. —- _i?._ti?i? of tbe Woodville District Count—), Councillor J. Jeaa_, and J. M. Bud dock (Clerk), waited on the Commissioner of Public Works on Friday mo—ing, February 14, -with refereoee to the Fort-road and district roads. The deputation was __odi_—. by Mr. W.H.Bean,MJ?. It was stated that owing to the bad state of the Port-road a large port—v of the tcsffie was divested oa to roads under the control of tbe District Council, tiie conse quence being that those roads were eonaiderably -cot up. The Council could not witb their limited funds keep them in repair, and they thought it a great hardship that their roils should be cut up on account of the bad state of the Port-road. Tbey-—l—d tbe Commissioner io place £200, or some other amount, on the .Estimates to assist "them in repairing the roads. In reply to tiie <—ntwym-innnrjMr.Minahan said tbe length of tbe two roads in question was about—yen miles. Mr. Been pointed out that some time ago a. similar request was granted to the _—_axsh Coon—.. The Commissioner, in reply.said tbe Woodville Council had as fair a claim on the Government es tiie Hutd—ar—t Council." He would recommend to his col- : leagues that an amount be placed on tiie Esti- ' mates. Di appeared to him. that no District Council could maintain roads if the traffic was to be —verted upon them owing to the main road being in disrepair. Xii~trn<-—>ns had : been given to'the Surveyor to the effect -that when the Pert road was repaired it was to be kept in that state. After the work was done he trusted the district reads would not be used for traffic tbat ought to go down the Port-road. Mr. Bean felt sure that when the Port-—ad was repaired there would bean _d>to simitar deputations. The Com —j_jon_ explained tbat ti_ Government had no funds in h*id at present, but would bave to go to Parliament for them. The members of tiie Town Council of Kensington and Norwood, aided by several ex members, bave formally acknowledged the ser vices of Mr. 8. D. Glyde, tbe ex-Mayor of tbe Hn_apaUty, during his recent tenure of office by a presentation, which was made to him in tiie Norwood Town Hall on Friday evening, February 14. Among those present were His Worship tiie Mayor (Mr. D. Pa—bam), and Councaiors Caterer, Humbley, Heanes, Bsiley, Psppin.and Sennets, and ex-Conncillors Wigg and Know—b. The presentation took tiie form of an oil-fainting of tiie recipient, by Mr. Solomon, of fiimdle-e—eet, wbo bas discharged bis commis—on so sat—facto—ly tbat Mr. G*yde*s fri—ids have it _ contemplation to bang a copy of bis production in the Council Chamber. The Mayor, who presided at tbe meeting and te_ deredthe portrait to Mr. Glyde, said be bad been a(__——irdui—g tiie tiireeyearsMr. Glyde bad filled the position of Mayor, and could testify to tbe uniformly fate end im partial discharge of his duties during that period. Mr. Glyde, ia acknowledging the gift, said that in the dis charge of his duties be bad been materially assisted by tiie cordial .co-operation of the entire Council, for which he begged to return them his sincere thanks. It was a very pleasing •rtfie—ion to him that during his presidency iv the Council they, had had ne bickerings to mar tbeir public usefulness as a body. The work achieved during the three years ia question, although useful, did not comprise anything of a kind calculated to immortalise their names, but he nevertheless thought that in the settlement of the Dequetville-terrace question, in, the tramway arrange—eats, ih.. the ..increased lighting of many thoroughfares, and in many other similar works, ■—^ratepayers bad bad substantial beueiits conferred upon them, and at tbe same time had the satisfaction of knowing that the Council was not in debt —that, iv short, _ the Corporation was in as good a position as any in the colony. Various gentle men present having endorsed the sentiment embodied in the Mayor's address to Mr. Glyde, the proceedings terminated with a vote of thanks to the Chairman.' When the Gawler people came to the conclusion that their Towu had at__* 1 s_ch a position of imf jrtance as to necessitate the erection of a Town Hall, it was thought advis able to build an edifice that would do credit to the place. After a little opposition ac the hands of a few, who thought a Town Hall was not necessary, the Council gained the sanction of the ratepayers to borrow £3,000. but it was then known tbat this -i-«hi"* would not fully de fray the cost. Aftertbecontracthad been coml -pteted and furniture obtained the Council found itself in want of about £1,000, aa the total c_t amounted to over £4,000. In order te provide funds for discharging the pressing liabilities, about a month ago negotiations were completed with the Bank for the loan of an extra £1,000 on the Council's promissory note for three months, and on Thursday even ing a meeting ot ratepayers was held in the Institute, at which sanction was sought to borrow £1,000 for a longer period. The (Jouucii would have consulted the ratepayers on tbe sab ject before, but they were expecting to come to terms with the Governnllent as to the price to be given for the market block. Titer had, however, failed to get the matt— settled, and wished to put themselves in a g—>d position in the event of their _irinj any ditti culty in obtaining the £t3UO expected. I_-, Worship -the Mayor, Mr. H_ K. Bright, juu_ presidea over a sparsely attended meeting. At r. Jas. Martin, J.P- in accordance with a pr_ui— msde when he was Mayor, proposed mat tne . Corporation J_ould be authorised to barrow £1,000 if neeesssry. He said they need hare uo alarm about their i_—iciai position. Coun cillor Dean seconded, saying the Government were throwing obst___ in tbe way of a settle ment of the market allotment transaction, and were thus a—e_listing this action on the port of the Council. Mr. _d ward Potter prop—3d as an amendment— *• That the ratepayers refuse to sanction the Corporation borrowing the money." He said the Council had spent more money than they had a right to.nad he would let them get -out of their nx as best they coiiid. Mr. Batchelor seconded. Mr. F. Hut—lie on supported the amendment, aud also to— ex cepuosi to the aedoa uf the Corporation. Ait_ 1 a discussion, in which a guoo. deal ot feeling I was shown, the resolution was carried. On Friday evening, February 14, the Bey. J. J. \V_twood Uelivered —I"inter—tiug lecture, in the blow _*.-inre H?il_ on "Toe Great Pyramid, the year IsSL, aud the cl„e ol the present era." _x_J._. _oui—_ c—upied the—i—r. i_ h?tl IV—aoj—ualt lv". Beiore dealing particulitriy witii tue _re_ Pyra—iil, the le—urer traced the history, caastnictioa and designs of the other -.j\p_ui pyra_ Is, which have been vari_udy _U—ated — 4% 07, and I—l in number. In«sp_kin3 ot the G._i Pyramid, whi-i was represented ia t„- ! tions on a l*"ge or 13—-a, svl its j 6>_belie re*igk>— r_eren—s, Hr. W_two— ; expressed bis great indebtedness to Prof——r ] P. Smyths*, who tiaamarie this pyramid a special ' study ;t_t be nther naively __rmed the audi- j ence that be did not beUeve all that would be i advai—ed in the lecture, although he did think j that the gre—_ parte* it had tne color of truch. .West oT the Gaxa group is situated the Great ) Pyramid, erected —.To b.c The author and i object of this gigantic, pile of __x_ry w_e ' long shrouded m mystery, but for many years I it -was the received opinion that Cheops, one til j the l^ypt—ni-_n-_ t ■>, bad caused it to oebmit j for a sepulchre. The researches ot modem • arch-eoiogis— had shown that this theory was i _it*——le, and 'that if the Bg; p__s haa cm- ! structed the pyramid it was _iu_ some giganac . external pressure, and before they had assumsd I \- their 6—l—que— proud position amongst sue ■ nations of antiquity. It was geeeraUyaamitt—. , that it Cheops oid build the pyramid be ' acred under tne direction of Poyletus, the ! Gre—:-form of tbe Hebrew name M—chl——_. It is afiirmed that Fnyietus, Melchissdec, or '■. r-_ing of Bight—man—•," could not nud ' an apptopriale ma in Palestine for the ! ere—ion of. tbia .^gaatie «UDnn_nt acd pro- j phe_c dy-ranip, and he consequently went to IC_ pt, where tor the space of 30 years he had I'—jWJO men employed on the works, at the completion of which be returned to Pale-wins and built Jerusalem. Tbe chequered history of the pyramid was afterwards traced by the lec turer through the earlier Christian centuries, the Mahomnvilan domination, aud tbe dark agea up to modem times. Mr. Weatwood aub —quemiy gave the length of the various pas eag_ an_ —i__e_ hi the pytamid in Scriptural cniiic mch c.«, which striagely co'ncided witb the opinioiis advanced by Proteoaor Smythe aod other well-known students of unfulfilled prophesies. The year 18&J; is spr_ _4 as the end of tbe pre—nt era by Profcsso*- Smythe ac cording to the tenrtiing ot tbe Great Pyramid as iutt-rp—led by him. The end of the pre—nt era, however, the lecturer explained, could not mean the end of the world, as the pyramid pro vided for auother stage ot existence which w«g to follow tbe disastrous eporh commenced by that j ear. Thi-sProf-ssorSuiytbebelieved would coincide with the Scriptural prediction, when the angels of heaven m the future tiuies ot trouble would take charge of and protect" tbe elect." According to the eminent Egyptologist quoted by the leetf-er, the Great Pyr_uid te__— that the English people are the lost ten trite*. At tbe cot-clumon of the lecture | Mr. Wtstwood quoted Mother IShiptun's uro- j pbecy, which of course beats out the pecti.iar theory of Profe_or Smy the and his followers. The members of the Concordia Biind played several musical selections on the Glenelg Jetty on Friday evening, February 14. Although the weather was rather cold tor the season there wss a large attendance of spectators. A challenge has been issued from the Templars liifle Club for six of its members to fire a match against any six men belonging to [ one Company iv tiie Volunteer Force, the Tern]-—re men to uIJ Enfield rifles, and the I Volunteers Mat-t—i-Henr-fa. The mat—ies arranged by the South Aus tralian Cricketing Association for this afternoon are—_Quth Adelaide v. South Australian, und K.a—ugton v. Kent.

East Adelaide, The usual monthly entertainment in con- ] necticn with the 1.0.G.T, Adelaide Lodge, iio. < 2,8.W.GX. of the World, was hdd in the Odd fellows' Hall, Franklin-street, on Thursday, ; February 13. The G.W.O.T, Bro. Win woodl, occupied the chair, and went into some details _sp_tingGoodTempi—ism. Songs, duets,aud recttatio— were gone through by li. res. Crowe, Smart, Baker, Gray,To-vcley, Cook, Barnes, and C_i_on; and Sisters Win wood and Stephens, and Miss B. \"_dep_r, assisted iv the vocii part cf the entertain-mitis. Misses SA. and C. A. Winwood presided at the pianoforte. There was a very large attendance. A concert in aid of the funds of the A.C.B—, Band, held oa Friday evening, at St. Francis Xavier's Hall, was very well att_ded, and went off most successfully. An attractive programme of vocal and instrumental music was performed, with Mr. Mc?ride as director, and Mr. McShen-y as leader of the Band. - The principal performers were Mr. J. L. Ha", Misses CSullivan, O'Brien, Flaherty, aud Messrs. Wilkin?, West—pp,and Hail—. Several pieces were encored, and the concert and drawing- room entertainment by the Amateur Christ) s provoked a large amount of apprecia tion from the audience. Lord Harry appears to be doing as he likes with the principal events in Tasmania, where he must have caused as much consterna tion as he did at G eelong when he won tbe Cup aud Handicap doubles. At Hobart Town be bas carried off the Gold Cup and the Alexandra Plate, and there is nothing to prevent him appropriating the _-.__eston Cup next week. On the first day Fmgal won tiie Hurdles, En chanter the Derwent Plate, Lord Harry the Cup, and Brisbane the Nursery Stakes. On the second day the Flying Handicap was won by Bapidity, the Welter Cup by Albion, tbe Alexandra Plate by Lord Harry with 8 st. 7 lbs. up, and the Hurdles by Cyclops. On tbe third dsy Brisbane won tbe Juvenile Stakes, Tom Ki—: the Weld Stakes, and Talleyrand the Steeplechase. Nominations for the Newmarket races, ! to be run at Morphetville on February 22, were received by Mr. S. Barnard up to 4 p.m. on Fri day, and considering the short notice given of the meeting, and the number of ho_— that are engaged in other events, the entries must be regarded as Very satisfactory. There arc eight j for the Hurdle*, eleven for the Cup, six for the j Steeplechase, and ten for the Half-mile Flutter, in addition to the fourteen who will compute in the Trot. Amongst the names of the uomiaa- | tors are several of the leading sporting men j of the colony, so that Mr. Barnard may confi dently anticipate a successful meeting from a racing point of view, and will nc- doubt be well patronised by tbe public. Arrangements have been made with the Glenelg Itailway Company to run trains at convenieut periods during the day. The weights will be declared on Monday next, February 17. The booths will be sold on the following day, and acceptances canst be made not later than Thursday, February 2 J.

Tan Ghele, with Mr. J. Hall as leader. Mr. G. Leopold is the stage manager. An entertainment by members of the Ade_ide Pioneer Lodge, jfo. 6, and the B'a — Diamond Minstrels w_ given iv the Tem pera—c Hall, North Adelaide, on Fridiy even ing, February 14.

One of the tillies I by —egeagle from Signet—fall sister to Device j —has not been alio* e_ tv go out of the coloay, ; having been purchased at a high figure and r. - tetved for training under the cue of Mr. j Jenkins.

The folios,ing extract from the l'kUadttphia Tones shows that hi: was nut without warning of the event which so sud denly terminated his earthly career:—'• It was on Saturday last that he—Heller—arrived iv town, and ou Sunday, iv company with his b__< >g manager, Mr. John Donnelly, he started towards Concert Hall to perfect not— arrangements preparatory to the season's en gt.geni-.ts that he intended playing iv tliis city. lie had ju_ received a letter from his intimate friend, _ A. Sothem, in which ihe penosator of Lord Dundreary sixiKe of the trouble he had with his attack of incipient paralysis. Walking up Cbeaiut-street Heller •suddenly experienced a twitching iv his arm, and was obliged to stop. To his manager and friend, hlr. Donnelly, he said, 'iSottittrn j I had an attack of paralysis, aod vow my turn • Las come.' Six times in the short walk from I j the Continental Hotel, at Kinth-street. to ' Thirteenth-street was Heller obliged to stop. Arrived at Concert Hall ne became very ill, and then Dr. Getciiell was sent tor, aud he found tbe magician suffering from a slight congestion of the lungs. ' Yes, yes,' said Heller, when Mr. Donnelly and tbe physician —Iked to him, ' but tbis is the last of it.' His friends told him that he was nervous, and that there was no reason for expecting any serious consequence from his ——Hi—i, but with the utmost composure—he was always full of nerve—he replied, 'Ah! yes, but I tell you this is the last of me.' Kobett Heller indeed spoke truly. The details of his sickness following the slight attack of Sunday have already been published, but the peculiar significance of his last act as a stage performer has not yet been referred to. Before Heller was noted as a quick-witted aud quick-fingered conjuror he achieved fame as a brilliant performer up— the piano, but it was long b.-fore his audiences smiled upon and applauded him. One night— an occasion that he neFer tired of talking about —be played the' Last Boee of Summer' in such an effective style that his listeners shouted their approval, snd Robert Heller had won a lasting name. On Monday night, in Concert Hall, when tbe entertainment was interrupted by his illness, Heller made his apology to tbe audience, and said that before dismissing them he would give a brief performance upon the piano. His pale face aud his actions showed that he was Buffering, but he sat down before the piano and he played the 'Last Bose of Summer' again, and played it,as his best friends unite in saj ing, as he never played it before, not even on that night wheu he achieved bis first success. As be left tbe hall he said,'l will never play again." 7
