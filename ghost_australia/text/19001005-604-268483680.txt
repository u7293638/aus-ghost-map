Why Shakespeare is Supreme. It ia the veraatlle working of Shake apeare’a Intellect that rendera hia supre macy unaaaallable. His mind, aa Hazlltt anggeBted, contained within itself the gerniB of every facnlty and feeling. He knew intuitively how every faculty and feeling would develop in every conceivable change of fortune. Men and woman good or bad, old or young, wiae'or foolish, merry or Bad, rich or poor—yielded their aecreta to him, and hia genlua illumined in turn every aspect of humanity that pre sents Itself on the highway of life. Each of his characters gives voice to thought or passion with an individuality and a naturalness that rouse in the intelligent playgoer and reader the illusion that they are ovorhoaring men and women apeak unpremeditatlngly among themselves, rather than that they are reading speeches or hearing written speeches recited. Tho more closely the words are studied, tho completer the illusion grows. Creatures of the Imagination — fairies, ghosts, witches, are delineated with a like potency, and the roader or spectator feels inatlnotlvely that these supernatural entl ! ties could not speak, feel, or act otherwise than Shakespeare represents them. So ! mighty a faculty seta at naught the I common limitations of nationality, and in every quarter of the globe to which civi lised life has penetrated Shakespeare’s | power ia recognised, All the world over language is applied to his creations that ordinarily applies to beings of flesh and blood. Hamlet and Othello, Lear and Macbeth, Ealataff, Brutus, Romeo, and Shylock are Btadled In almost :every civilised tongue as if they were historic personalities, and tho chief of the irnproB slve plirasoa that fall from tlioir lips aro rooted in tho speech of civilised humanity.
