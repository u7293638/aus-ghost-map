' Not yet, Miss Vernpn,' answered the stage-dpor keeper,; ' he is late, ain't he ?' ' ' It is most provoking ; the 'first night too, and I particularly told him to be early?'' rejoined tlie young and beautiful woman who had just stepped out of a carriage' at the. stage-door of the leading theatre in' Thornborough, a large provincial town in1 Blankshire. onau i sena up a ooy to ins lodging, madam?' ; . c- i ' Yes, do so, please ;' and the actress passed into the building with a vexed and even anxious frown on- her pencilled brow.: For to Clare Vernon almost everything of :n! great step in her career depended on the success ot the venture in which this Christ-; mas she had desperately launched the hard-; earned sdvirigs 'of years. ' The orphani daughter of a naval officer, left destitue inl very early girlhood and remarkably gifted! with beauty and talent, shehad gone ori tlie! stago at once, and was now only two On three and twenty, though she looked much younger. She had studied and toiled, iindl worked hard; all the harder because slie' had had to struggle againts the heavy tide; that sets so strongly against an actresswh'o1 determinately holds her honor priceless— ai bitter truth to all who know anything bfj the theatrical world— and beautiful; gifted Glare Vernon had refused' more .'offers' than she could count, which would at once have lifted her from obscurity to wealth' and fame. : ' r ??;-...., 'She played in Loudon in subordinate : parts, but in the provinces, for some time past, in leading heroines,- and was well 'known as a clever, rising artist, but, still the point to be attained remained, to'get tlie 'chance' to be seen in a leading port' on a1 gobd London stage, and she thought' the time had come when she' might, nay; mustj make a bold bid for that erid. ^Thorn borough was a large and important place,1 and surrounded, too, by rich countyhouse's,' most of which this Christmas were to be1 very full of guests, owing to the coming of age of the heir of- the leading inan of-the1, county. So Clare secure'd for ?l'ettding'-''parts thoroughly competent supporters, and took tlie Royal Theatre. ? ? ? Tliornborougli; for 'the Christmastide well advertised a varied and good re pertoire of pieces, the first of which, on this, the opening night, was 'EomeO' and Juliet.' More especially was the young actress anxious : now, because she' had ; just heard that a leading ' London manager! was in the tpwri, and. would' certainly 'bo preserit at the performance, ori which' so' much for1 her depended;- ?':? ' ' ! ? 'Mis Vernon has come just now, Miss Maynard|' said one of the stock company to the lady cast for Juliet's nurso, 'andl heard her tell old Joe to send up: to 'Mr Moore's.' : : ' Has she ? I hope nothing has happened;' returned the elder actress. -'Why, the' doors will be open directly. Ill1 tell you what, my dear. Clare Vernon was a great fool not to take the chance of cutting '-the. ! stage which she had years ago ; she 'might I have married well.' ' ! ?'?Married!' repeated the girl, incr'e'du-i lously, almost with a sneer. ' '??'??'? ' Miss Maynard nodded. '??''? 'I believe it's quite true. She wasn't above sixteen or seventeen, and had been! playing boy parts and small- female parts ?(she' was on the stage at' fourteen* you know), when this young fellow met her at some private theatricals where he played, and she 'was amongst the pros, they had ?for the small parts ; about a thosand a y'ear -he'd got, if not more, and not long after he made her an offer.' '? ' ' Dare say he did,' said the other drily ; ' but not of marriage. 'Tisn't likely she'd have refused.' ' 'She did though — couldn't leave the Stage, and so on ; and then a year after she saw his death in tho papers.' 'Well,' said the girl, ' I never thought that Miss Vernon was a fool till now.' A fool! had she been a fool? was the story all true ? Was she thinking of ? that past now, as she. paced her dressing-room waiting, in an anxiety which deepened every moment, for news of her' leading actor? Did she see' 'him- again on the temporary stage' in that, grand old hall, playmy the part of Benedict, so handsome and debonnair, so bright and so clover, that slie liad whispered to 'one of his felldws what a pity it was that such talent sliould be wasted m private life, just because Mr Seymour D'Arcy had a thousand a yeari Did she hear him again; spoiled eon 'of pleasure, who had never1 been gainsayed; pleading his love, praying her to leavo the stage, and be his darling, , liis bride ? ?
