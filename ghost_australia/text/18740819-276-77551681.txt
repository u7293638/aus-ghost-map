fENOLA.,: (From our own Correspondent.) Anenst 14. The'Murray troupe appeared Viiere the other night to ajvery poor house. This possibly 4rose; from the perform ance 'being; announced for Saturday and not taking-place till Monday.; The night also was wet, and the perform ance long arid1 tiresome. There was Borne very good step dancing and comic breakdowns,:.but the gentleman who enacted (the nigger, though capital on his ' piins, as soon as he opened his mouth betrayed his Caucasian origin. There was no trace of " Cain" sugar or otherwise about him then. Mr.-Boss Albertine did some clever trapeze business.' A performance was also announced for Tuesday night, which was again wet, but there was no attend .ance, and it consequently lapsed. I hope : they had better luck at The Mount, but W give credit where it is 'due;there was evidently no curtailing of the amusements on : account ofthe small attendance; .but this might well have been done .as regards the Ghost in the Pawn-shop, which played about twice as long as it ought to. .
