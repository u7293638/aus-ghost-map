TO THE EDITOR OF THE HERALD. I Sir-Now that the tactics of some of the would-be regenerators of society have been shown to be something like those of a captain who flourished his sword to frighten a distant enemy and killed his friends beside him, Is it not time the real working men put an end to the strike force v barely they were entitled far the play they give to get more sound advice than that which has led to such a complete muddle of their affairs, inflicted much misery on their wives and little ones, and caused so much inconvenience and loss to the thousands who are in no sense parties to the dispute. Nobody objects to a man belonging to a union, but when unionists seek to force other folks, whether they wish or not, to pay entrance fees, fines, c, and to join and become bound by the rules of their particular club, they prostitute the principles of unionism, and seek to interfere with liberty, The cry, " Down with the capitalist," coming from the labour party, is about as sensible as though they were to ask a man sitting on the end of a branch to cut it off near the tree The capitalist is the successful labourer or his representative, and capital itself is simply stored-up labour, or the money, which it represents, And to say that no man shall store up the result of his labour, or, mother words, save money in his youth for the needs of his age, as to destroy the value of honest toil, and make it impossible for the labourer to better his position someone must take charge of the money necessary to provide subsistence for the labour engaged on any undertaking the crop cannot be reaped, until it has had time to grow. and it is well that those who have made money should be encouraged to invest it in re- productive works which employ labour. It should be remembered that the much-abused capitalist and this beare particularly on the cases of banks and companies is very commonly the man or trustes put forward to represent them by hundreds of small investors, among them being widows, old and poor persons, who find it harder to live than those who talk so ghost. And such persons or capitalists dare not, however well they may themselves know their business, risk the money entrusted to them in any work the conduct of which may be taken out of their hands by irresponsible persons possibly without experience bo they unionists or not. It is only fair play that he who takes the risk of any venture should carry it out according to his own judgment True liberty would end our troubles, for then each man could and would go about his lawful business without fear of molesta- tion That this liberty is not yet enjoyed is shown by the I daily brutal attacks by numbers upon men and boys going home alone from work, and though responsibility is disclaimed by the labour party, this state of affairs reflects discredit upon every man who stands by and does not interfere in the name of freedom and fair play, and conduct is so un-English, as un-Australian, that without in any way reflecting upon the numbers of persons of foreign extraction who are among our best citizens, it may be well to inquire whether the bad section of the foreign element, which bore as in every seaport is so large a factor, may not be to blame. But be that as it may, every true man, be he unionist or free labourer, should see to it that persons of our own race govern this country. One of the greatest difficulties in arriving at a settlement arises from the fact that while they are good enough men to manage their own little clubs, the present developments are too big for some of the strike leaders to grasp, and there can be no safe settlement in the interests of the general public until they can be brought to see that what they are advocating is not the teaching of legiti- mi>iA unionism but of unionism gone mad. as I _,",_._" to., WILLIAM COPE.
