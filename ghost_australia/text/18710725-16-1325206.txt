Hie only reason tble conclusion it is pos sible to come to on the question is that Mi Beil blurted out the secret without leave It ne\ ei w as meant to be used as an elec tion cij, 01, as we have shown it would ha\e been used earlici The veiy manner in winch the Coiomvi r_Lvs_n_ft liitio duced the subjeet gi\es color to this suppo sition lie mentioned it as a nut" winch the Government 'bad to crack with the Opposition in Brisbane"-i soit of ace of trump, that the Mnustiy still held in their hand and meant to play when the gime grew despeiate And accouling to the repoit, theelectois of Dalby looked upon it isa elevei "dodge on the pait of the Ministi}, and cheeied fe announcement accordingly It w as hardly a statesmanlike mode of piomulgatiiy such an impoitant proposal although \eiy chaiactenstic The electois of Daloy were ught, it is a elevei dodge of the Ministry to endeavoi to check mite the Opposition and diveit attention from the issues they have laised If the seat of Government is removed fiom Bus bane, that will be another argument why the îailway should not be extended to the city, because, as the Ipswich phalanx eau piove, once the Parlament ceases to meet heie, ttid the Government ofiices aie closed tiade will decrease, and Ipswich will become the poit In fact, it is i ques tion wbethel the eity will not be deserted altogetbei, and the inhabitants îemove in a body to the banks of the Biemei Creek The dredge eau be kept at woik at Eagle lai m riats, «o as to allow soa-going ves sels to get up to Ipswich, but the Corpo ration of Brisbane had bettei not pioceed with the building of the budge That will never beiequued, besides, as the Coi osi \x I_E vsuiti it said, when he put a stop to the woik before, it would be an obstiuc tion to the nav igation oí tho i iveí The sacuiiee of the Government buildings elected and m couise of election will be of little consequence, as most of the money was rased by the sale of land within the niuuieipaht\, a moiety of which by ught belonged to tho Gorpoi ttion But, admitting that the Government w ill find no dilhculty in silencing the mom beis for Brisbane and Last Moreton on the question how will tbe advocates of Sepaia tion in the Noith îegaid the mattei ? Will Rockhampton be willing to give up its cherished idea of a new colony clear of debt with that town foi the capital' Will it be willing to be saddled with the debts of tho South "foi evei," as Mr Bell avers on con dition tlat Gladstone or Bowen becomes the political capital of the colony ?

A large number of them possess sufficient means to start in farming, and as they are all men who have followed the occupation in the sister colony, they are thoroughly conversant with the best systems requisite here, in view of the exigencies of the climate. If these families give a favorable report of the ground and climate, a large number will be induced to follow, so that before long quite a colony of Germans is expected to settle on the lands in that neighborhood.

The Sydney Mail thus summarises tho quartorly Btatomont of revenuo and expenditure of Now South Wales -" The reooipts for the quarter wore m excess of the expenditure for the quarter, the former amounting to £510,933, and the latter to £423,625 So far all is satis factory, and tho general result of tho quarter is an increase of tho available balance But, on the other hand, tho quarter's receipts woro below those of tho corrosponding period last year, and this ib not encouraging, as wo naturally look to seo the rovenuo improving year by year as tho population increases, and as expenditure increases also Tho falling off, however, is not much, and it disappears altogether when we take the wholo six month» into the calculation The chango in tho tariff mado by Parliament last session-namely, the diminution ia the number of articles subject to ad valorem duty and the increase of those subject to specific duties, has not very much moreased the revenue, the gain on the quarter being only about £500. So far as present appearances go, the Customs rovenue as a whole will not exceed that of last year, and the Assembly wasted an enormous amount of time in discussing the tariff, without really doing much to udn to tho rovonuo from this source The amendment of tho Stamp Act seems to havo boon a much moro effective piece of work Although the new sy stem has only been in operation foi a short time, it has already added £6000 to the revenuo, much to tho dis tress, probably, of thoso who, through fear of a heavy fine, were foiced to supply themselves with stamps, but, no doubt, greatly to the satis- faction of the Treasurer Free selectois have not responded with very groat alacrity to the invitation to pay up their balances in instal- ments, less than £1000 having como in from that source But four times that amount has been paid by others who wished to pay up their balareos in full and get thoir titles, and who havo not been tempted to delav that piocess in the expectation of getiing laud cheaper in a year oi two Publicans' licenses show an in creaso of Hourly £2000, though whether the cnlargoment of revenue from that source is a gain to the community ma) perhaps be well i oubted " TnE greatest foat ni tolegranhy yet performed is thus recorded bj tho Times -' Experiments wore made on tho Indo European Uno, via le beran, to work direct without any io transmis sion between England und India Communica- tion was first established direct between London nnd Kurracbee Iho director at Kurracheosent the following message to London -" Kurracbee, 8th, 5 3G p m -This message is tho first really sent from India to longland instantaneous!)
