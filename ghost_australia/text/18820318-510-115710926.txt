PHOEBE. Ere pales in Heaven the morning star, A bird, the loneliest of its kind, Hears Dawn's faint footfall from afar While all it's mates are dumb and blind. It is a wee sad-coloured thing, As shy and secret as a maid, That ere in choir the robins sing, Pipes its own name like one afraid. It seems pain-prompted to repeat, The story of some ancient ill, But Phoebe! Phoebe! sadly sweet Is all it says, and then is still. It calls and listens; Earth and sky, Hushed by the pathos of its fate, Listen; no whisper of reply Comes from its doom-dissevered mate. Phoebe! it calls and calls again, And Ovid, could he but have heard, Had hung a legendary pain About the memory of the bird; A pain articulate so long In penance of some mouldered crime Whose ghost still files the Furies' throng Down the waste solitudes of Time ; Waif of the young World's wonder hour, When gods found mortal maidens fair. And will malign was joined with power, Love's kindly laws to overbear, Like Procne, did it feel the stress And coil of the prevailing words Close round its being and compress Man's ampler nature to a bird's? One only memory left of all The motley crowd of vanished scenes, Hers—and vain impulse to recall By repetition what it means. Phoebe! is all it has to say In painful cadence o'er and o'er, Like children that have lost their way And know their names but nothing more. It is a type, since Nature's lyre Vibrates to every note in man, Of that insatiable desire, Meant to be so, since life began? Through Memory's chambers deep with- drawn Renew its iterations faint. So nigh! yet from remotest years It seems to draw its magic, rife With longings unappeased and tears Drawn from the very source of life. —JAMES RUSSELL LOWELL in Century Magazine.
