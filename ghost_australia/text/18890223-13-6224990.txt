PICTURESQUE VICTORIA. BY TELEMACHUS. ROUND TIIE MOUNTAINS TO MANS- FIELD. Around the mountains Yes ! My friend and I are at the end of a 300 miles trip around the mountains, and we have visited Mans- field, and are content and recuperated, yet somewhat stiff and weary. Our journey began with the mouth of that tunnel which so baulked and harassed the contractors for the little line between Yarra Flats and Healesville. Only a paltry bit of a line it seems through a nodule of a hill which a Zalinski gun should blow into actual smithereens in a half-dozen shots, but which contained such adamantine rocks, and such inexhaustible drifts, that months of labour were required to prepare the passage and wall it in securely. It is finished now ; the trains run right through. A holiday party has been taken from Healesville to Melbourne, and next spring the tourists will make up and down with no transfer from the railway to King Cobb. And then Healesville will begin to bud and to bloom, to put forth coffee palaces and hotels, to issue its invite tions to all and sundry to come up to the mountains, which rise from its right upward to some of the loftiest heights of the Big Divide. We do not tarry in Healesville longer than is necessary to taste the peaches and look at the hops of the district ; the former luscious, the latter luxuriant, wreathing their poles 10ft. high, making arbours ot every avenue, and dangling innumer- able fruit tassels, each one of which would fairly fill a nobbler-glass at a wayside inn. Up then by the Fernshaw-road, the old Yarra Track, which we propose to follow right through to its terminus at Wood's Point. Eight hundred feet up we look across roll ing woodlands, and fern or scrub clad ravines, to the noble front of Mount Monda ; and in the late afternoon Monda is all glorious with shadow and shine, with vesture of pearly mist and purple gloom. There is a broad, bare patch on his breast, which one might imagine to be tufted grass or short heathy scrub. You imagine you might sit there while the big timber aloft was waving in a gale, and look out over the valleys and plains. How singularly erroneous is the idea That ap parently bare patch, we are told by Mr. Fuller, who has surveyed and traversed all these mountains, is covered with a scrub growth 20ft high, through which you must cut your way with a tomahawk, and in which you see nothing but the endless succession of pale grey stems with the silvery underside ot the leaves and occasional patch ot blue above. The face of Monda must be great compan ilonship to any dweller in the mountains. It is as the face of a great angel for ever changing from mightiest passion to sweetest solicitude through all the infinitudes of time and clime. And slowly the people of the city are coming up here to dwell with Monda lhere is now a great coffee palace near completion on a fair opposing hill, but I do not imagine that Monda or any ot his brethren will find delight in the companionship of that coffee palace, for the architect's theory would not take instruction from the mountains. They have set a neat, rectangular, decorated candle-box of a thing in the midst of cones, and domes, and peaks, and serrated ridges - a magnificent building doubtless, which may become comfortable, and even luxurious, but which will no more harmonise with the sur roundings than its standing beverage with the taste a Highlander athirst with a morning walk or an evening discourse. One feels more affection for the old doomed cottages at Fernshaw than for the new and splendid coffee-palace. Did not Buvelot paint that old cottage hotel ? Have not guests and friends innumerable made the roof tree ring with song and chorus ? Did not the good landlady here claim lineal descent from that great hunts man and master singer who wrote the song of old songs, "John Peel" ? And the glades, and the dells, and the murmuring now that has accompanied so many vows, and the wonderful rose tree in the garden, with its never-failing crown of blooms, and the oak which shows for scarce nineteen years'growth a trunk of 18in. and a crown that would overshadow a council of war , and the Eng- Iish flowers and the English herbs, and the speck of a garden amid the gigantic forms and the tremendous glooms of the great Austra lian forest - all ate condemned now, all shortly will have passed away for ever. The babbling Watts, hurrying away to its new work, will have a voice pathetic as the old clock on the stairs, murmuring over and over the tales of its little bundle of memories, which can never be added to, because the wants ot the great city have crushed out all the promise and prospect of life of the little mountain hamlet. Addios, Fernshaw, so we leave you down in the gathiring gloom, for aiready the shadows have crept far up the mountain sides, and the white mists are weaving in the valleys as cerecloths for your burial. We climb the black spur, and wondered, as men must ever wonder, at the greatness and the grandeur of the forest clothing, which from bracken to tree tern, and from beech to mountain ash, rises 300ft aloft, a garment woven of the ages, fed by the airs, and watered by the rains and snows of thousands 0f years. I do not know how high the forest is, and am not just non going to enter into that contest which my friend and companion, Mr Davidson, is anxious to begin about the actual heights of the greatest trees. But near the summit we came ucross a prostrate hulk which sorely puzzled the labourers and the travellers on the roads. A monster on the upper side of the cutting had toppled over, and fallen across tho roadway. The trunk, 30ft, in circumference, lay right above the road. There was a coach on either side. The passengers had walked beneath, and the road men were now at work to make a way for horsemen and drays. They said it would be too much trouble to cut the tree, they would rather deepen the the tunnel beneath, rather cut away in the breast of mother earth than remove one of these, her forent children. We led our horses beneath the tree and mounted and rode again, rode hard, for already the low aun rays were firing the mountain heads, and we would not miss the glory which even- ing always makes on the infinitely varied contours ot these northern slopes. Just in time there was the indigo, as of the most profound ocean depths, overlaid with a film of gauze hanging as an actual taigible presence above the hidden gulfs, then directly above, in wonderful contrast, Down Down in lustrous violet and Mount Strick- land in burning cold, and the last flash on the strangely broken ridge of the Cathedral, which vanished as we gazed. I do not remember such masses of vivid colour in such notable contrast on any other evening in the mountains. The violet and the gold were pure as the pink which morning paints on the great snow-fields, and the indigo below as the earth's firmament which seems to mirror an unclouded sky in the great gulf of the Blue Mountains of New South Wales. Hut very soon the glory died, and the inagpiea ceased their canticles, and the jack ames their noisy chorus, and moo poo culled mopoke fur away, and bounce, bounce carne the wallaby unperccived through the scrub, and a little breeze began " to tremble o'er ' the broad leal es of the saplings b) the track, and to rock the light boughs uf the nmegalinas fur above, and to ninke dirge . like music which soundtd but a little while ero the muht closed in, and we pulled up for a spell at the cleanest inn in the colon), deep donn iii the valle) of Narbethong When we started a"*aui the full moon wns well above the treis, »nd tin white light Uoodtd all the valle) ol the Acheron We missed there ore its stunted mid gnarled and hideous dead treis 1 here was mist, tia a fair white limn cloth overall tin mile;, with great mountain masáis boj omi ¿1 greut white Bkeloton beside the mad would ocei stonall) stretch forth its weird (.aunt arms , n sapline,branch,tlicdin sptirklingonever) leal, would assume 1uorue1ur.nl> a i,hostl) shape At times the road waa decked with shadow, at tunes it ran bare and smooth through pus ture landa, from which came to 113 the whole- some odorous breath of tune.
