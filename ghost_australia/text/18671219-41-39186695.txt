HAMLET AND HIS FAiHElt'3 GHOST. TO THE EDITOK. sir— 1 find, Mr. Editor, that an unconscionable individual, who, from his name (if names have any just signification), ought to know better, haa been d'tingme a grievous injury. This 'Elder.' who siiouin oe canea lounger, proiesses to paroay what he calls Hamlet's moralizing before the ghost ot his father. Prithee infoim the man, witn my compliments, that he should quote me correctly or not at alL I was not, noc am I sucU an ass as to put words into the mouth of Hamlet which had been already used by my sanguinary friend Mac beth. Let Elder look at his Shakspeare before he ventures to quote me again. Fray tell the man that the following is the correct reading, and that the passage, which 13 from a speech of 'Macbeth,' a Scotch thane, who made some little noise in his day, is as follows :— 'The times have been. That when the brains were out, the man would die, And there an end; but now they rise again With twenty mortal murders on their crowns, And push us from our stools.' Let me say in thine ear that I do not fee how the passage could apply to the august assembly of which thisElderappesrstobeso bright an orna ment. 'When the brains are oaf.' Query— When are the brains in? * Keep thine eye open, Mr. Editor, and don't allow folks to misquote me again, or thou wilt hear from me sans cercmonie, Thine, W. SH-K-S-P-E (His Ghost). The Shades.
