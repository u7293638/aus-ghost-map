FOUND GUILTY, OR Ralph Chandos' Fate. A Stirring Tale of the Early Days of Botany Bay. FOUNDED ON FACT. CHAPTER XVI. PORT JACKSON. The rcscning ship prowl to be tbe Dnke of Wellington, convict-transport, bound from London to Sydney. She had some thirty women on board, with no male convicts Sho horn to,.and picked np the small boat and its occn pants. The latter damberrd to her deck with difficulty, being weak and cramped from insufficient diet and exercise. Miss Pelham was passed np first. Lord Strathmore dosely following her. The captain and officers of the Duke of Wellinirton thronged around the haggard waifs they had picked np. full of wonder nnd curiosity, at tbe singular spectacle they presented. Lord Strathmore. by .common and tadt consent cf his companions;""was spokesman of the party. Ue had bc tr_jcd no cowardly terror during his recent sufferings, but had been moody, reserve.), and grim of visage. Now he assumed an sir of condescension and authority befitting his high rank aad station.* fie swelled with importance. He f?lt himself every inch Lord of Stnthniore in England, end Governor- Genera! of Botany Bay. 110 nnnonnced hiaiself with proper prde and solemnity, snd his auditors received the announce ment with proper amazement and satis faction. " This young lady is Miss Pclhara," he declared, indicating her. •* This is her father. -Mr William TitHiara, the c -ine-t city banker, and my especial friend We were on onr way to Sydney in the ship Clytemnestni. with a hnndred and eighty convicts: on bond. The convicts arose and ma<tcred the soldiers and crew, and we barely escaped with our lives in the general confusion. We are starred and in need of yonr best offices." " The ship is at yonr disposal, my lord,'" said the captain, politely. "' Any thing we can 60 for yon and yonr friends we shall be glad to do. Will yon descend to the cabin 7" The ship was already nnder weigh again. Lord Strathmore inclined his head in assent, and took a step in the direction of the cabin. Suddenly, he paused and looks- around, his gaze failing upon .his hated cousin. Chandos, in spite of his unkempt and nnshaven appearance, in spile of his liaggardness and his worn garments, looked like an idea! yonng prince—straight and tall and stalwart, with a hanghty poise of his head, his long, blonde looks glitter ing in the sunshine, his light moustache filled with tangled sunbeams, shadowing a month as once stern as that of an ac cusing angel's, yet tender as a woman's. The captain's gaze followed that of Lord Strathmore, and he bowed low to this splendid young follow, who looked to him like a knight of chivalry, snehas he had read of in romance in his boyish days. " Look to that man, captain," said Lord Strathmore, in a harsh and dis- \ cordant voice "Heis a convict—one '■ of the one hundred and eighty on board of the Clytemnesti.."' The csptain recoiled a step with an incredulous stare. ** For shame, my lord ! " said Gerda Pelham, her eyes glowing with indigna tion. ** He saved onr lives at the -risk of his own. But for bim not one of as p-oaid ever have left the Clytemnestra ilire '. He has preserved onr lives all those weeks by the exercise of down>igbt heroism. Vre owe iim everything— erer-thing—" •• Gerda ! " intnrrcped her faUjer, nervously. " Do not reprove yonr daughter, my dear friend," said Lnrd Strathmijre, gmootUy. " Her euthusia-m docs credit to her warm heart *nd ber sense of -ratitnde- We do owe Mr Chandos a peat deal—l acknowlcdgo it—bnt hardly so ranch as Miss Pelham thinks. I see in him no hero, bat a convict bent on savins his own life, and who saved oars incidentally to bis main purpose. Bat. whatever my private feelings, I most consider my pnblic dnty. Tbe eves of England are npon me. As an ortici-l of the government of ray country, it is necessary that I sbonld be impartial. It behoves me to be a very Urntns. Captain.. I shall hold you, responsible for the safe keeping of the young roan." He resumed his course towards the cabin, bat tbe others of tbe party did not move. "Captain,** ?aid the ship's doctor, gravely, " this young gentleman is our preserver and benefactor. I must beg you to treat bim witb consideraribn __tii we reach Sydney. He is no otdinary convict, and I sincerely believe him to be innocent of any crime against the law." ''■_. s-Tbe Governor-General, Lord Strath more, could not, consistently with bis duty to the Government, take any other stand in regard to this enhappy young man than he has done," said Mr Pelham, with simple dignity. " bnt I think he should be treated with kindness, captain, for hia devotion to ns. *nd I join my en treaties to those of Doctor Marsh. It) is only hit U) e?J. however," he added, ??that 1 differ too tfce doctor in believ ing Mr Chando* innocent pf crime.' " The young man *-?.. be taken good <_.-? of," said tbe capttin. forming hi_ opinion of Chandos by the manner of Lord ritt-thmore. "\ ou may go for ward," and he addressed onr hero \- Here you, Tompkins, yon look after thi* young man. ar.d get him something to eat. JJbw, my lord, this way to the cabin." . He wnduct*- hi gnests thiilier. The cabin ~as n-3 luxurious room. being plain in tlie e-tr.-ic, with a divan running abont the wails. It tva-: clean, and looked to tlie wrary royagere a very haven of rest and safety. ?We'll __r C n breakfa't for you, directly, my !orJ." said the captain, after introducing himvif as Captain Hawardcn ; and, in the meantime, if jo-ll make yonr toilet, my room is at your seivice." _._• Lord Strathmore acknowledged this politeness by ? bow. The captain opened tlie door of n stateroom near at hand. " Miss Pelham," he said, " this room is nt jonr serricc. I "rill hire the steward make np the berth with fresh linen while yon ire at breakfast. This is the first olTk'cr'si room, find Im will lie happy to turn out f.r a lady. Yon will 6nd dean towels and soap and water in readiness for use. I will bring you a new comb nnd brush immediately. I am only sorry that I have no stewardess to attend upon yon." • Miss f'elhatn expressed bar thanks, and retired into tbe room assigned her, dosing tho door. Horiatber,and the doctor wcro next provided for with lodgings quite near to her. Tho captain bronght clean linen from his own stores, and those "of his officers, and supplied the gentlemen. Clothes brashes were brought into requisition, and b'd snd worn garments were brushed and shaken into cleanliness nnd respect ability. Miss Pelltam seen red her door, and took a thorough bath, feeling .thereby greatly refreshed. She was ncaily dressed when the captain knVscked at her door.and informoti her that' ho had fonnd some dctn linen for Iter among tbe stores of the convicts, and begged her acceptance of it. When lie hnii departed, sho opened her door." and took iv the things lie had bronght., The linen proved to be coarse and ill-itiide, but it waa dean.- and the young lady accepted it with gratitude. The comb and brash restored her dithevcllcl locks to glossy smoothness. - Her black gown was yet whole and decent. A white pocket-handkcreliiet'—onsrof tljo cap tain's - tied about her beck, supplied the lack of a collar., Her toilet thus lrtio-. ratr_, she re-entered the cabinl Breakfast was upon the table ; steam ing coffee, bacoiv, ant| <sgj^,i poi'ted meats, 'new'Tiread and'- ship's 'f.iscait,' made, up a repast that seemed to the new arrivals fit for a Sybarite. " liord ' Strathmorri 'came fortr-rd nnd offered his arm to __is_,.,Pc_iaui,-to lead her to tlie 'table.' Sfie ' declined the' proffered assistance with a coldness that startled him. Ue feared, lest, in liis enmity to his consin, he had gone too far. . '■' v-"' '■ •■"•- I-"" ■-' '"^lj-dcar„Wm Pelham," heJ'-codc I, in an!nndeiftoni*," **do; npt baa tt grjr" witit me. Uow conld I act differently in regard to Chandos ?. "* Do: yoo suppose that I do not feel the disgrace of the connection, and that I would not assist his escape if I conld? Bnt dnty. to a pnblic roan, is a stern word. I cannot betray^ the trust reposed in me. Believ ing Chandos goilty. I dare not tamper with my conscience or my duty, so far as to show him favor. If I lo?c yonr esteem. Miss Pelham, by my adherence to dnty. then I am indeed, the most miserable < f men." The hypocrite infused so much of seeming sincerity and passionate earnest ness into his tones that one more gifted with insight into bnman natnro than innocent "Getda might well have been imjioscd upon. Mr Pelham bad heard every word, as ho stood near, and be held ont bis band to Lord Strathmore, exclaiming warmly : *' Yon do well, St rat-more lo adhere to yonr principles of right. We'under stand yoor natural desire to shield ys.nr nnbappy consin, and to favor him. We Tespect yon all the more for yonr strict adherence to dnty. Gcrda is not offended with yon. How conld she he ? WbateTcr Chandos was to her in tho past, be is less than nothing now. Gerda lias sense to realise that the voting man is only a convict, condemned to transportation with hard labor for life There is a gulf fixed between tbtrai which even tbo most romantic and hare-brained girl in existence could never hope or desire to cross." There wa_ an an_ions look in his eyes that touched his daughter. She took his arm in silence, and was conducted to thb table. While she ate her break fast, she did some b-rd thinking, the reit-ll of which tvw a rcsolijiiop to tr?at Lord Stt-tbroore with uniform courtesy thereafter, not only teat-so an opjmstte course wonld offend her father, btjt for other reasons jrhicb seemed to ber ample andinoperative. . ,  ** I am growing to dislike bim cx tremelT," she tbonght, " bnt for papa - sake, and for llalph*- sake, I must con ceal my a version. He certainly hates Ralph. He is the one—the only ono— who has profited by old Lord "trath more's mnrder. I .omstimes think—" A shndder completed tbe -cntence. After breakfast, she begged Dr Marsh to look after the welfare of Chsiidns. The _ood doctor liMtoned to comply witb her request, finding Chandos in tbe forecastle, supplied with clean linen, comfortably fed. and lodged among the •jailors. His bearing and looks pro cl*imed bim ?n aristocrat, and they had received Mm cool.-, bnt his genial smile aod friendly ways had won npon them all, and, in spite of the stigma attticlied to him, the seamen were inclined to make maeh of him. Tbe doctor spent some hours with his joong friend, and retnrucd to the cabin io time for dinner. After that rncai he gave his arm to Miss Pelham, and walked with ber upon tho deck, rc'.ating to her the snb?tance of hi; rwent inter view with Chandos. nnd avowing to her again his belief in the yonng man's in nocence. " I was nerer more deeply interested in any man in my life," he esdii'mied. -1 am alone in tin; world.

" Yon. alone, my dear young lady, have any influence with his lord ship. If you ex.-.rciso your inflnoncc in ClinmWs behalf, tho horrors of his lot may be mitigated— not otherwise."' The girl flushed, then paled. Lord Strathmore had never, iv so many words, avowed himself her suitor, but her woman's intuitions bad told her that, he loved her, nnd sho know that any miti gation of her lover's lot was to bo ob tained only at tho price cf her hand.' 1 he doctor sighed again, interpreting her silence aright. The future looked very dark for Ohnndos nnd ho cnnld see no gleam of light anywhere for tho poor young follow. A few days if rest and comforlablo fare, of relief from torturing anxieties, restored tbo fngitives nf tho Clyiem nestra to some resemblance of. their former selves. Chandos reinainod in the forecastle, visited daily hy Dr -Marsh and Mr Gray, and now and then seeing from afar the eyes of the girl ho loved looking upon him with tenderness nnd yearning that thrilled him through and through. .That lovely, faithful face, ; fjill of unswerving fidelity, was to liim n star of hope and promise. At ai'hL, in .his lonely bnnk, it seemed to shine upon him ont nf tlie dark ocas like the face of on angel. He could not latterly despair so long as this ono true he-Art .dun; to him, and shared his griefs,, mourned over him, and bestoged llcareu daily .wjtfi prayers in his behalf. ! .The P.ukejof.Wcllingtnn was a good sailor. In a week's time she diww near her destination.-. Upon tho morning of the seventh day sfier tho rus-iie of Lord Strathmoro's party, there was great excitement upon.;' __trd/v'at.bln"b <JHiie against tho hori_on: indicating Jsind. This" bine line on nearer '-approach, developed into a.i?reati.walr ofrroek, destitute of trees Tho wind had shiflo < to tho nnrth-enst, aiding materially tho approach of tho. Wellington. The- sire nnd grandenr of tho cliffs _were now apparent; Tbo two heids-ofPirirt slack son liccame perceptible, all hough tho pas sage betweeoUiein was not yet plainly indicated, the third, or Middlo Head, appearing in tho opening. The Wellington, having taken oa board the pilot,-. who-;^aiTrruront iatja small boat; in "doe r_nf?i_-_*t!ie towering North Head, and entered Port .Jackson, sailing Win-eon tho opposite lines of cliffs, which formed immense buttresses, to (ho right and to the left. The scene, to English eyes," wis very striking. Tho sandstone rocks oh the- shore jutting out into the water, the strange trees, tho gums, with their light-grey trunks, predominating, the green grtss, tho shrubs, and all tho peculiarities of the Australian landscape were scanned with eager eyes. "~ Lord StrathmnreY bosom swelled as he gazed upon tbe land over which he had come to rnlo. He was the icprc sentatiic of Lis sorereign,.?nd -ijipicfore virtually monarch of this groi.it southern continent. Ho felt himself a king as,he surveyed his new empire. His ambition was at last gratified. He felt that his life was a succes". that his scheming and sinning had brought bim the result at which he had aimed. As he thus exulted, saving to him self tbat only thing mora remained to lm desired, and that one thing was posses sion of Gerda Pelham, thegir! approached bim. and stood at bis fide- He turned to her, his faco beaming. "After all onr perils wear, arrived at Sydney safely," he exclaimed. "Letus congratulate each other. -Miss Gerda." Mis? Pelham glanced in the direction of tbe forecastle. "I wish to speak to yon of Ktlpli Chandos, baron," she .said brtvely, although ber lip* quivered, nnd there: were tears in the sweet learlo-s eyes npraiscd to his. VI do not ask you to prove fslse to your idea of duty;-but I do ask you to spare him sll indignities, such as the prison and hard labor. The very fact tbat lie is a convict "s ? tprlnre tohinj. Do not let it bet added to by -nncf-tsasrv crqolly, I brse-ecli you." " Miss Pelham," siyd ; ••.a baron, : gallantly, " whatever T can do for Clian dos shalj be done for yonr sake." '.! . Tlio girl turne4 aw4y, atrtjek by the concluding wonjs of ljia septenca, yo feeling lighter at heart.

Sydney, at the time of which we write, although bj- no means so large or so prosperous ns at tho present day. wss a somewhat irregular but a hif?hly picinrefono town, with fine stieets, handsome buildings, and ample parks and pleasure grounds. The finest park in Sydney is known as the Domain. Attached to it arc the l.i.tnnii-l Gardens' ; lit" l'lncr Dnniain. containing a fine collection of living l.irds : and the Government Ho-?e. lh' re.idem c of the Governor, which is surrounded by especial and extensive grounds. It is tn the Government Home tint we now direct the attention of the reader. The Imildin. is .luadran.ular in shape, very largo and handsome, tituated upon mi eminence, and commanding a view of tlie waters of I'ort Jackson. Its air I of statclincss snd iiifi?nificc'ieo are well ' calculated to inssirc its new incumbent with a high idea of his own importance. It was tho day ?fMr the ?rriral of ibr ' Duke of Wellington at Port Jackson. The now Governor, Lord Strathmore, was seated nt it tabic in the pleasant breakfast-room of the palace. Ho had recovered somewhat from tho fatigues of his prolonged royago and disasters, nnd horn little resemblance lo the forlorn nnd unkempt fugitive of Pinnai'lo Island. His hair and liearil had been well trimmed, his ragged garments had been exchanged for broadcloth and lino linen ; his discontented and despairing expres sion had been replaced by one of self complacence, nt supremo content, of quint exultation. His swarthy face was Hushed ; his eyes sparkled ; and ho ap pearc.l to enjoy his luxurious repast with the appetite of a gourmand. His companion was Mr Pclliam. Tho round and rosy banker had recovered a good share of his former spirit?. He was well costumed, and seemed already to hare forgotten his recent privations and terrors. He Iveainc.-l upon his com panion with all the olden reverence for rank and title, and thought, in his own heart, tbat earth could afford him no higher joy than to become father-in-law to a peer of Knglnnd and Gorcruor- Uoneral of lluta'sy Bay. " I nm sorry that Miss Pelham is not able tn join us nt breakfast," said the bar.m. sipping his wine leisurely. "We need her presence to perfect our enjoy ment." *• She will appear at dinner," said the banker, " provided she can procure a suitable toilet She is going out early upon a shopping expedition " ' " I will have a carriage plsvxd at her 3err.ee. Wbiln Miss Pelham .occup'ic. hcrscif in shopping, I will consult with my g-crotarvnnd members of the council. .My delay in arriving here has caused certain complication*, I understand, to which I must devote my. immedinfa at tention. Duly before pleasure mnst lie tho motto of a.government officer, Sir I'elliam." "Certainly — certainly,"' said the banker. "I desire to call upon a correspondent here, and to attend my daughter, so my timo will bo fully occu pied.•' " f beg yon to maU yourself qnilc at hotne," remarked Lord Strathinore, arising. "It shall be m y study to make yon and Miss Pelham comfortable and hippy. Wo have passed through many' dangers together, and, although I have never addressed one word of love to yonr daughter, my desire to make her my wife has increased and strengthened into the dominant purpose of my life. Her bravery, sweetness, dclic-icy. nnd jwrfect refinement and good breeding, under circumstances calculated to try a soul to the utmost, have deepened my love and admiration for her. I assure yon, Mr Pelham, it wonld lie the hap piest day of my existence—that on which I should make Miss Pelham Lady Strathmore, and instil her mistress of this palace." The -inker's face flushed with prido and pleasure. . " It would be the happiest day of my life, also," be acknowledged. '• To see my dnnghtcr'preside over this provincial court wonld gratify mc lieyond measure. I am snro that Gerda likes you, baron— tliii much I may say with i mpriety. How much she likes yon," he added, with a smile, "yon must find ont for yourself." A shadow (lilted across the dark face of the governor. " I do not wish to risk rejection by speaking too soon,-' lie said, moo lily, walking toward tho window. ".Mies' Pelham possesses extraordinary beauty, and cannot lie insensible to tho fact. She is a queen among women, and fit to occupy a' royal throne. How she can waste her affections upon a convict sur passes my comprehension—" " But, my dear baron." interruplcd Mr Pelham, eagerly, " hor fancy for yonr uniorlnnatc cousin is a matter of the past. When he became a conrict, her affection for him ceased— "* "'HI' thought that,** said" lent-* Strathmore, would risk- everything and'VroposetoliM*to-day/' .'„_ '""'"" ' " " ft is so,"- asserted tlie banker, con fidently. *' It mutt be so. .My dnugb-' tor has been well brought up—as well u^any young woman in England. Jt would not, bp proper for her to love a convict, and my daughter is not one to 4o anything improper." ; "Chandos is confoundedly handsome." muttered Lord Strathmore, nneasily. " And he acted very will upon our small boat voyages. A routantia girl might easily inako him out a hero. He had been a yachtsman, yon know, and, know ing ben what tn do. naturally took the lead' Ho did all the wor<, and was head and front of affairs, Isesides saving us from the convicts, and all that tort of thini;. so that she is likely to idealise him. A girl's first fancy dies hard." " Itcannot survive the lo?? of respect," declared Mr Pelham. '• fierda is grate fti! tu Chandos fur saving her life, and so am l ; but I assure you. baron she appreciates tlio distance between them, the awful pit lie has dug with his own liauils,. .Slie is an heiress, the daughter ?f nn honourable man ; he is a cimvirt for life, his uncle's murderer. Kven if she loved him still, she must know that h>'r love is hopeless nnd worse limn hopeless:." •• Yes. it i.? hopeless ! He will live and dio a convict," • (vowing that tinder any circum stances sho could never marry him " said Mr Pelham, "tho must soon forget lliui. She loves me *s I love her. She will desire to please me. Need I say that all my parental influence will l>c exerted in yonr favour? I can safely promi-o you that Gerda will accept yonr offer ? henevor made " " Vet 1 must not be ti>-> prreipilate." s.iid Lord Stratlimore, tboiighfiilly. " It is Itetter to Iks too cautions than n.'t enough so. When Chandos is disposed .if, removed for ever from all possibility of seeing her again ; when she lias bid time to sco what her position would be as my wife ; when tint shall bare become ink-clod with the gaieties of ?y_n-j life and recovered entirely from he/ late ad ventures, I -ill speak, but not till then. Patience must be my motto. I always .tieeee.l in my undertakings ; I shall uot fail in this!" •• Of that I am sure !"said '.ho banker, warmly " Heiiieniber that I -pprwa'P the honour of your proposed ■ liance, and that Gerda will alway* b<x4 my tv-.be* in r*g*f- to ber fatara mul* ment." The two gentlemen shook hands. "What is to become of Chnndos?" asked Mr Pelham, after a brief pause. " Will his recent me.itorions conduct weigh in his favour 7" The baron shook his head. " I [car not," lie nnswercd. " He was sentenced for life, you know. Xolhiog he can do can mitigate his punishment. Ho will have to share the lot of all con victs. I have promised Miss Pclliam to do all I can in his behalf, bnt yon must realise my painful positio.. being his relative. 1 cannot prove false to my convictions of duty. I fear that the law must take its course." Mr I'elliam expressed his regret, but approved his lordship's Spartan adhei enco to duty. After a little further conversation, tho two gentlemen separ ated, Mr Pelham going to his daughter's room, nnd the governor proceeding to his council-chamber. An hour later, n carriage, drawn by two horses and nttended by coachman nnd footmen in livery, drew np at the stntc-cntranco of the palace, and Miss Pelham and her father descended and entered it- Tbcy wore driven lirectiy to George street, tho.principal .horonghf-rc of the tonn, when, tht host sltops, hotels, banks, and tho post- office aro located. It presented a hnsyscono at this hour of the morning with cr-wds nf pedestrians, and public and private vehicles nnd seemed a small London. The shops proved excellent, nnd Miss Pelham had no difficulty in procuring a necessary outfit suited to ber present nniniren.cii._. A bonnet, a handsome shawl, furs and gloves, wcro bronght into immediate use. After visiting n droismakcr and giving her orders, tho y ong'lady resigned her self to tho guidance of her father. whoso money, fortunately, had been upon his person at tho moment of escape from tha Clyt-mncstra, and who was thus able to meet the demands upon him. - Jn his turn-Mr Pel.minvi.iiod H-Jes peoplc, who supplied his requirements, or promised to do co with brief delny. " Back to Government House," he commanded, upon rc-entoring the car riage. " But return by a route, that will gire ns somo idea of the town." •; The carriage proceeded along Georgc stroet to Brickfield Hill, crossing Park streot to Elizabeth-street, and keeping in the pleasant shadow of HydoPark. Turning into iMncqnarie-slreet, they passed the Houses of Parliament and sercral .club houses, and entered the Government House grounds. > ,".:.', (To be Contintud.)
