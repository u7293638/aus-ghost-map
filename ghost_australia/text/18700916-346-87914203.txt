Thi Nrxr Szaticur or Pailixwest.-The ] political quidnuncs (says the Xtader) are already ] inquiring vrhat buiinetj will te done ia the j earning session of the Assembly. We are j inclined to esy in oa-e word-none. There rau.it, ] of course, be a few days or weeks of talk, bat it j will all hare reference to tb.e impending gentrai election. All messores of importance-aad we do not except that of the defences-will be kept open throughout the progress of the general election. Of course we do not speak fro;n inlor mation; we out airire at a correct judgment by a better process. By taking note of the flgns of the times, and reckoning probabilities, there is little difficulty in arriving at the conclusion that the dead-slire Assembly will not take to work kindly. It will be a posirire cruely to aik it to do anything else than wrap its mantle round it and give tip ibe ghost in decent tragic style. Goldes Gbass.-The Guilford correspondent of the 51. A writes:-A singular feature ol tbe flood was the deposit of gold on the green sward While tnsur of the rivulets yielded little or none of the precious meUJ, ihe short thick grass aste-J likeabiaj;kel, sndarretled ihelarniuated particlesof gold that the turbid waters carried down stream. In rnsny places that bt-re f/ten overflown the miner', both Chinese and E'jropezo, bzre shired off tie sod end washed it, getting a return that one wonld s:srcely credit. In one instance a'o;je 8 few hours washir.-g realised fifteen penny weights of flaky go'd. The water channel; areno^ mn'ch deeper than previoui.'y, and raush ie-s debris left than usutl, so that it is propor'.ionstely rchier, the daily earnings of the Chinese increased. So Mxioas art they to secure '.heir unexpected harvest, that they rroTS. not only early and l-ste, but could not reritt the temptatiQn of utiiiring Sunday and in all of the oat of way plssei their Cttdltt were bmy oa thst day.
