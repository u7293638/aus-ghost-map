THE FORSAKE^ FARMHOUSL Against the wooded hills it stands, Ghost of a dead home, staring through Its broken lights on wasted lands Where old time harvests grew. Unplowed, unsown, by scythe unshorn, The poor forsaken farm-fields lie, Once rich and rife with golden corn • And pale green breadths of rye. Of healthful herb and flower bereft, Tbe garden plot no housewife keeps; Through weeds and tangle only left The snake, its tenant, creeps. A lilac spray, once blossom'-clad, SWATS bare before the empty rooms ; Beside tha roofless porch a sad, Pathetic red rose blooms. His track, in mould of dust and drouth, On floor and hearth the squirrel leaves, And'in tha tireless chimney's mouth His web the spider weaves. The leaning barn about to fall Resounds no more on huskitfg eves; No cattle low in yard or stall, No thresher beats his shsaves. So sad, so drear! It seems almost^ Some haunting spirit makes ite sign ; . That down yon shadowy, lane some ghost Might drive his spectral kine. —J. G. WHITTIHB.
