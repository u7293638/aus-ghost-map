SCHOOL OF ARTS ANNUAL SOIEEE. Wednesday evening, February nth, 18G3, will long be re- membered by tbe members and friends ot the Maitland School of Aits as one of the moBt agreeable and pleasant ever spent in the town of West Maitland We allude to the second annual «oiré«, which took place on that night Tia was advertised to be ou the tables from hall-past nix to holt past seven o'clock, but owing to six o clock being the hour named on the tickets, a large number of the lair »ex had assembled in the ball at six o'clock, from which hour until the time mentioned lu the ad- vertisement the stream ot visitors continued to pour In The hall, as upon a former occasion, was tastefully decorated by the lady friind* ot tho institution with green bushes und the native "cornstalk." On the sides and ends of the building were suspended prettily wrought and appropriately worded mottoes -" Llther And a way or make one,' " Union is strength,' "Advance Australia, and " Success to tbe Mait- land School of Arts ' The tia, as upon the last soirée, which took place on the 5lh of June, 186-', was kindly and liberally proiided by the lady friends of the members of the institution, and great was the credit It reflected upon them Hie arrangements were admi- rable-the tables being loaded with good things The building, by half-past lix o clock, was quite full A little ooufusion ensued when tboBe who first sat down were moving from the ball to allow their successors to dud places at the tables, but this was only the prelude to a soene which took place shortly afterwards, and which it would be impossible adequately to describe About half past seven o'clock, the President, in the name of tti<* committee, requested all who were in the hall to retire during the time the stewards arranged the suits, and cleared away the tables, crockery, &c; This request being only very partially attended to, a Bcene of confusion, almost Irremediable, and not easily to be. forgotten, ensued flic sounds of strashing crockery and breaking stools were varied ever and anon by voices urging with a heartfelt solicitude the people to withdraw, but it was useless to persuade the assemblage to leal elbe room, though ouly for a few minutes lhe cousequeuce Mas that planks, stools, and plates aud dishes, had indiscriminately to be hauded through the first aperture that came in the way Just as the back part of the hall was getting cleared, the ru«li from behind was tremendous by I arties who fearid they »auld not be able to obtain seats At last the principal oostructiODS were re moved, the doors were fully opened and the public rushed in Ina ury short space ol time the large hall was crammed to suffocation At the previous «circe the hall was full, but ft was inuih more crowded on Wednesday night The assembly «X1 mixed one comprising a» it did, folks from Hexham, Morpeth, Last Maitland VU.t Maitland, and Lochinvar it had Leen resolved b) the committee prior to the soiret coming off, that on this oocm.ou the platlorm should be kept quite rlisr but the attempt to earry the rt«oHe into e\ecuiion was louud to b* u'terlj imj ractlcable pnd b* the time the Tre-l oent took the rti&ir; tlie ¡ atforin with tLi eieoj lien ol a rcall plaoe left for the reciters and singers was quite full The entranoea to the hall were all densely thronged, the window* all around presented a ridge ol faces and in a word every avail able inch in the building was crowded by persons anxious to hear the treat in store for them Hie chair was taken at about a quarter past eight o clock by the Itev J li thackeray, the presidentoi the institution »ho alter the Vulunteer Baud (who performed m the galler>) had pla>ed the Maitland Volunteer March, said by reterring to the programme they would find he was expicted to say a fe» words If nuy one was ntraid he was about to deliver au ora tlou they might make themselves easy on that noiut Wtiai he understood as an opening address was a very lew words li) wiy ol introduction, and to bid them all a hearty welcome Ho looked upon it us a great honor to be the president ol sucli au institution, or indeed tobe in any way connected with it He had speut Borne of ttie happiest days of his Hie within tile walls oi the Maitland School of Arts (hear, hear) He had derived a large amount of pleasure from the friendship he had found in connection with it, which he sincerely hoped might last to the end ot Ins life When he looked round him he saw several strange faces but he also suw many that be knew, and one and all lie would, in his own name, and on behalf of the committee bid once more a hearty welcome He hoped they would spend a pleasant evening from time to time in the course of the evening lie should have the opportunity of saying a few words but for the prcseut he would conclude by calling on Mr M farlane to sing the first song, called ' Scots Wha Hac The song named was Bung by Mr M r-nrlanc, in find rate st} le, eliciting warm mid lung continued marks of approbation on the part ol a delighted audience Mr MTarlanc, being vociferously encored, Bung ' 1 hero was a lad bom in Carlisle, which was also greeted with applause The Chairman here rose, and observed that he was extremely sorry to sec so many standing (some .'00 pcrsous were standing throughout the hall), but it could not be avoided, and was very suggestive oi one tact, viz , that tiley would ere long have to enlarge the room, as evidcutly it was not large enough for occa- sions like that The programme was then gone through All the pieces being received very favourably with one or two encoreB, in- cluding Mr M1 arlaiie lu his second song, for which he gave "Barley Kiga are Bonny O Mr Dean who gave for the enoore ' Widow Maclirec and Dr Doyle who attempted the " Bold Soldier Boy, but broke down, when ho sang ' Dear harp oi my country, singing to his own accompaniment The recitations on the whole were very efficiently rendered although in one or two cases we noticed the gentlemen reciting were not quite perfect in the text The singing was extremely good eliciting loud nnd long continued appluuse Mr Hitchins presided at tile piano 1 he Volunteer Band rendered cillaient service, and quite took the audience by surprise in the 'Night Bell Gallop where the vocal powers of the players are brought into requisition with great effect 1 his piece narrowly escaped an encore winch doubtless would have been accorded but for the lateness ol the hour The Chairman then rose and called upon Mr John Lee to propose a \oteof thanks to the ladlcB, which that gentleman did, remarking that at such a late hour he could not think of detaining them for any length of time Mr Henry Cohen seconded tho resolution, whloh was put and carried unanimously, the band ploying " Here s a Health to All Good Lasses On the motion of Mr D Anderson, seconded by Mr A Boggis, a similar vote was accorded to the Volunteer Band, tor their kindness in acceding to the request ot the committee to piny on that occasion 1 he band then pla> ed the National Anthem, and the best attended and most successful soiree ever held in West Maitland was at an end In retcrence to the number of persons present on Wednesday night, we may mention that it is the opinion of all whose situ allon in the hall wuuld eunble them to judge that there could not have been less than some 700 people in the building Add to that number those who blockaded the doors, and thronged the windows we opine theie must have been some 800 Indi- viduáis at one part ot the evening listening to tile entertain- ment 1 he proceeds of the sale of tickets, with the money collected at the doors, amounted, we understand, to about ¿Jt, NEWCASTLE CHURCH SOCIETY. The annual meeting of the Newcastle Church Society was held on Thursday, at hulfpast one o dock, in fat Marys Sohool room West Maitland In the morning divine service was performed bytheltcv G C Bode, incumbent of fat John s Church, Newcastle It was well attended, the text was 1 bamuel, 7 chap x11 verse After service a large number ol guests and residents in other parishes partook, by imitation of luncheon provided by ladles of the parish, and prepared and set lorth in the parsonage At the annual meeting the attendance numbered about two hundred persons principally ladies The Lord Bishop of the Diocese presided, and the following rev gentlemen were Îresent, namely -1 he ltcv Canon Greaves Rev G C Bode, lev S Simm, Kev J It Thackeray Kcv C Walsh, Kev J It Blomtlcld, Itev L. Iv 1 caiman Kev C W Hawkins, Kev L 1 yrrell A Glennie, and It Chapman The Bishop opened the proceedings with prayer, aller which the 100th psalm wus sung His Lordship then addressed the meeting, and said they had again by the all wise providence of God, been permitted to meet together on the occasion ol another annual meeting of the Church Society and although it might be fuir to expect and to find a good account of the society s proceedings, it would not have been unreasonable if a decrease In tho society s louds tor the year had to be reported by the secretary, as lost year had been an unusually severe one in its extreme drought, and thi3 had naturally acted upon the contributions of many who were most anxious to send in more than their ultered circumstances and the general loss in the district would permit, indeed, the loss lu the district put it out of the power of many to contribute at all Another fact which led allpreseut tocxpect a decreased uccount at thnt meeting was that the meetings heretofore had becu held yearly, and in Muy, whereas the present meeting was three months curlier, and the report and returns would thcr»» fore be for nine months only, instead of twelve He would have been much distressed ut a lulling ofTiu the contributions, hut the fact wan, that instead of a decrease there was au actual Increase in the amount made greater bj the proportionate time H» had therciore the glad tidings to announce tliut a good and satisfactory account could be renderul (Oueers), for, whilst the year 1861 WJS au increase on IGuU by£J00 so ISM was on 1851 by about £300, and it was tile more gratifying that the principal item of increase was to be lound in the clergymen s stipend column, whMi was the most Important Item ol the whole It wus then great matter for congratulation to find that instead of a decrease as might reasonably have been expected, there "u» au aotual increase, hut ns they would shortly hear a full oxplanaliou of the matter from the secretary he would not dwell further ou that subject One fact he would however, like to mention, w hich was perhaps destraille also it was in reference to diocesan affairs, but it was right to bring ¡t beforo tile laity, it was, that the society would not be enabled to pay more than the stipend of £150 to each clergyman in the district alter the present year, in consequence of there being no Government fund to fail back upon the Government fund was required to supply urgent wants in all parts ol the diocese, and it there were no general fund for that purpose the result would be as he before men- tioned It would therefore become the different districts to give largely in the most generous and the kindest feeling lie regretted to Bay that oue shortcoming at present was due to the church at Ivewcastlc not having sent any contribution up that year It might he fair to state however, that It was thought probable, ana desirable, that tint grammar school in Newcastle should be assisted to the extent ot £150 and It was agreed at a late meeting, at which he attended, that a master Bhould receive £150 and this sum was the amount which the Newcastle Church was short in its contribution, and that was how it arose, the first expense over, he hoped they would be no more deficient (cheers) 1 o go to other matters, he would allude to the subject of Borne ol the resolutions to be BUbmltttd to them, and as the Government had carried the question of State aid abolition, he felt it should be matter of serious consideration with members of the church not to be found wanting, if they saw the chance to find means so that tile want created might be speedily supplied, and if the laity gave contributions in their own parishes as God had prospered them, there could be but little fear but endowments could be effected Two en dowment grants had already been made to his knowledge, and he mentioned this only to show that what members in one pariah could do, members lu another could and, he hoped, would do One of the seeretarics (Mr Walsh) might take the oompllment lo himself in this instance, for it was in his parish that an endowment of £10 and another of £20 had been made Thoy were small, it Is true, but they would be of permanent good Again, with reference to the wants of the supporters of the church and the laity, it would be well of them to ask for special blesslug from God, not on their wisdom, but on their contributions The late drought, as he betöre men- tioned, had lett many unable to contribute, but tile people were still willing, and if so let them say they were, and give Now, he knew one layman who had been prospered during last year, by the blessing or the Lord he lind not lost one ot lils cattle, whilBt his neighbours lost all and that mau thought it due to show lils thankfulness to God, and on Tuesday he felt he Bhould bring aspecial contribution ot J-M to him (the Bishop) and his usual yearly amount ¿5, was rendered double theuceforward (cheers) Now this he knew, was a true thankfulness to God It conduced to the fuller enjoyment in the use of blessings and benefits and was an example to be followed lils lordship congratulated the meeting upon the aspect of affairs throughout the dioce6c, and hoped tiley would sustain the Churcli Society s high character, which, he said could be held up as equal to any in Lnglaud or the colony (cheers) Ibis he heard from n gen tlcman Irom Newfoundland, who stated that he had heard there-and It would be gratifying to the meeting to know it tlic society s rules men tioued und referred to as an example to all others it also was mutter ol fuct that their rules had been aocepted hy Dr Coswell as worthy of imitation and a great person-the Bishop ol Honolulu-lind two or three copies as on example to follow (chei rs) One more thing he would men tlon, that the Newcastle Church bociety bud been mentioned in other meetings, elsewhere His Lordahlp then reverted to the collection ol funds, which lie hoped would go on with life It was no mere matter of collection ol funds they had to look to however, but to the rearing of the young people , gentle men In collecting should have that fact before them Funds were required for building, too, but the great crowning fact was that the lunds were principally tor the purpose ol ministrations in bringing souls to Christ Jesus and he might Bay in entire opposition to anything to the contrary, that during his last visit in October lie never suw greater proof of the good done with the funds In bringing people to regard good and ho never Baw so many young children to be confirmed In congre- gations us at St Paul s, Singleton, Musclebrook, bconc, and other places Indeed, there was an unusual number of young people to be oontlrmed, and the fact nfTorded him great Joy to know it and lie now urged them all to greater exe rtiona , let there he no resting upon their oars there was great cause for hope, blessed hope, in serving the Lord more and more, and that they could throw themselves upon the God of hone, who had power to cause them to abide in hope through the Holy Ghost, he earnestly desired and felt would be the case Ho called upon til« Secretary to read the report The ltcv Canon GREAV. LS then read the report, of which the following ison abstract - " Tu elflli Annual lleport of the JVewcastle Church Society, 1802 " The resolution passed at the annual meeting of the New- castle Church Society last year having changed the period ot our assembling together fiom May to February, your com- mittee present tills, their twcllth annual report alter au interval of nine months instead of twelve as heretofore When therefore, it is borne in mind that the time during which the collections had been made has thus been shortened by three months and when In addition to this it is remembered that during the last year a drought of very great severity has prevailed throughout a great part of the district it cannot but call forth the expression of our htartlelt thauksgiving to be able to announce that the subscriptions have not suffered any diminution, but show an actual increase to the aggregate amount of 1.22110s Od 'I lie tact was one to occasion thanks fliving and to give encourugement to those who had laboured n the cauBc of the society Ihe steady progress so long vouch- safed it was trusted would still continue, and the thorough confidence expressed lu the society s operations would encourage its best friends to renewed exertions until every parish in the district reached the standard projosed by its rulis By this mians the clergy would tie amply provided for, aud their pure apostolio faith firmly planted lu the colony It was cause of thankfulness to kuow that the clergy generally had complied with the request to preach an annual sermon In Advent, for the general lund The wisdom ot Hie course had been demonstrated in the past year, and au unexpected di Helene} of £150 in that fuud, lu consequence ol the lailurc of oue of the parishes to fulfil its en- gagements had been made up It was hoped the annual appeal uu behalf of the fuud would be malutaiucd In passlug on to the enumeration of the parishes of the diocese it is ucees sary to bear in mtud that the statement would uot represent all that had been done, as many of the secretaries had failed to send in any detailed report "IvrttCASTi-E -1 roin the parish of Christ Church there was nothing to report St John B 1'arlsli had contributed £157 10s -au increase ol £3r 15s Id on lust year biuce the departure of the Itev H L Shaw, the duties bad been temporarily per formed by the Itev b IC li annan, and more recently by the Kcv J Wright The Itev G C Bode late of Glenmore, has been appointed to the cure, which wa« increasing in population 'Kalnovo 1'EnrtACi: offered u gratifying Instance of what might be done for the society, by perseverance In 1858 the contributions to the c1' rgy lund were £'> 5-< In 18J1 Í2H 10s , In lbi.0 Í4G 78 , ill 1801, ¿74 13s lid lSt,2, JL1.M 13s Id , be fides Lil* tot church buildings and £10 for the general fuud Hie etouc church has been completed aud a school house of Btone Is In course of erection Au organ has been provided, and the parish had contributed tovrards the stipend fund 1 Hlrkty b-q , has given ahile for a school hou'e at Millers forest to be usid also tor divine service HLXUAM-Has sent Into the society the sum of £35 14e 4d 1 hire v^ss H dec-ens'1 in tin \ opulattou reported by the Beere tary Mso the collieries in the neighbourhood called lor spiritual care A site for a Behool has been granted by the com »any " STROUD -Sent in £75 for stipend lund, besides £16 14s for diocesan purposes " WILLIAMS KI\ En -I or all purposes, raised £139 los.

handed to that society Hie past year was one of serious eventful interest to the Church The passing of the bill for the pruhlbtlon of future grants In aid of publlo worship would graduait) do away

overwhelming preponderance ol petitions against it would conclusively show \ ot the bill passed and us tlic existing rights ol present incumbents lia 1 been provided for there was little hope of the Koyal sanction being withheld \\\ hilst de plormg the passing, of a measure calculated as it was to do so much ii jury to the religious Interests of so sparsely a populitcd colony, it was matter for thankfulness that the aid would gradually cease There were two courses which could be pursued-the formation of au endowment fund in every parish and the lutroductiou ot the lull workings of tho society into eviry parish It was mat ter of surprise aud regret that some parishes raised £200 or £J00 and those adjoining not half that amount In these latter cases no doubt the people were as willing to give as in the formir but the same trouble it seemed had not or coul 1 not be taken to interest the people in the workings of the eoclcty 1 his was unfair to the other parishes of the diocese and should be If possible altered Although tidings had not yet come to hand of the establishment ot the new bishor ric of Grafton and Ann! dale it roit,lit fairly be expeoted that before their

and pleased to take part in the \ rocecdlne,* Ilia circumstance of the church Society hav.ug done so much good was attributable to the whole of those interested collecting steadily since the

gratifying to kne lso of the prust erlty of the whole d strlot and ol his own pa t of it-Morpeth But it would also bo understood that as the Government had withdrawn State aid It would be necessary on all to use greater efforts I very one present he lclt assured was pleased and satisfied with the report and for the pur] ose of permitting others to speak he would be brlel and propose That the report read be adopted and printed and circulated tkrougheet tile Diocese The Kev K CnAPMAN would gladly do his best on the occa sion to exj ress his concurrence with the report to the reading ol which he had listened with attention As to the position ol the different parts of the diocese he wus heartily glad to hear of an Increaio lu the funds and he hoped they would contluue to come in for the uses to which they had beeu and would be api lied for there evas no money he felt so well laid, ut as in building and increasing church acuommortatiou asvvasbeini; doue at St Mary s und Archdeacon Cowper
