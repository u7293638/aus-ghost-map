MISCELLANEOUS. The Collmann and Taechi are now extend ing levels on the new atone met with in the east crosscut 242ft from the shaft at 1724ft. The reef is 5in in size, but in places bulges out much larger. It is well mineralised and ■ bows f»ir gold well set in solid slooe. On tho footwall Lhoro is a nico black lead like ■late, and where ii joins tho stone is also nioe gold. At the level obovo (1645ft.) the icof is only 130ft from shaft. So thU it underlays to tho east 92ft in 89fr, Tho manager, Mr. Voale, was sure there was stone further ahead, and drove the crosscut 10ft further past the little ro.-f. Tie then stopped, hut ■till not being salisfi <d bored a hole in 8ft, and again mot with -toni showing mineral * in tho borings. Probably when they got tho lovols away they will then sea what this stone is. South Devon tributors milled 12 tons for 2oz 3dwt of gold, and tho company 42 tons for 2oz 14dwt. There is nothing to report in Iho mine. Unity tributors put through 34 tons for a yield of 14 az IQdwt of gold.

Tho Now Prince of Ware now extend ing their south level at 300ft to inlcr-oct the old roof worked 30 years ng> in th > old Wales shaft. During last wo-k an inspection of the eld shaft and workings wore made to define what stone was left. Tho old workings wi re found to be in a good state of presorva'iou, tbo timber standing well, tho water being oil gone. Thereof is piety well worked out below tho 1- v-1 and they wore not loo par ticular la keep in their own ground. In the old North Peg Leg mine tho stone is stand ing, hut it ii rather loo dangerous to go too close to inspect it, the slum ami slim-) of 30 years still living wet and sticky owing to the trader only just having drained off An old pick Wft« picked out from the slimo after 30 years Immersion, probably loft carelessly at knock off time by some minor. Tho pick is rusted very much, more especially the iron part Tho steel part is pretty sound. Tho handle is good and firm in tbo bead of tho pick. Tho wood is solid and is encrusted with mineral deposits, resembling streaks of gold—gold, of Course, in tbo half-manufactured slate. Tho pick will bo sent to t' o Juvenile Exhibition. Mr. L.
