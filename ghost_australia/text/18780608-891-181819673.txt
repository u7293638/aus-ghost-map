CHAPTER Trsrrsr THAT night Tom and Huck wcro ready for their.adventure.. They hung about the neigh* bonrhood of the,tavern until after nine, ono watching the alley at a distance, arid,the'other the tavern door. Nobody entered the alley or left it; nobody resembling the Spaniard en* tered or left the tavern door. The night pro mised to be a fair one; so Torn went homo, i with the understanding that if u considerable degree of darkness came on, Huck: was to come and u meow," whereupon lie would slip out' and try the key«. But the night remained clear, and Huck closed his watch and retired to bed in an empty sugar hogshead about twelvo. Tuesday the boy» had tho a^mo ill luck. Also Wednesday. . But Thursday night pro j mined better. Tom slipped out in pood season i with his aunt'a old tin lantern, aud a large towel to.blindfold it with. He..hid .the lantern in Huck'a sugar hogshead and tho Watch began. An hour before midnight tho tavern closed up" and its lights (tho'only ones thereabouts), were put out. No Spaniard'had been'seen. = No body had entered.or left tho alley. Everything was auspicious. Tho blackness ' of darkne«H reigned, tho perfect stillness was interrupted only by occasional mutterings of distant thun der. Tom got his lantern, lit, itin^ tho hogshead wrapped.it closely .in tha towel, and the two adventurers' crept in 'the gloom' 'tow'a'r&rthe; tavern. Huck stood1 sentry and Tom felt his way into: tha ?alley. . Then there, was a season of waiting anxiety tfcatweighei.upon: Huok's spirits like a mountain.'; Ho began .to /wish he could- see, a flash .from .the lantern-it would frighten h m, but . it .would at least .tell him that Tom was alive yet. ... It seemed hours siuce Tom had-disappeared Surely ho:mu6t have fainted; miiybe he ,was dead; maybe his heart had burst under.terror and excitement. In his UTu;i-inesd .Huck found himself drawing closet: and cloae'r-to the alloy, fearing all aorta of dreadfuli things,'and momentarily expecting some catastrophe,, to happen . that would take away ;hia breath. There was not 'much to take/away, -for he seemed only able to inhale; it by; thimblefuls and his heart would soon wear, itself out, the .way it was besting. ? Suddenly; there ;was a flash of light, and Tom came tearing by him: " Bun!" said ho; "run for your;life!" He needn't have repeated it;,. once . was enough; Huck was mating thirty ;or forty miles an hour before the repitition was uttered .The boys never stopped till they reached the shed of a deserted Blaughttr-house at the lower end of the village,-' Just as they .got within its shelter the storm burst and the rain poured "down:, As soon as Tom got. hiB breath, he said: , ,"Hu'ck, it was awful! ;Irtried two/of the keys Just as soft bb I could;.but they seemed to make such a power of racket that I couldn't ?hardly.get my breath, I was so scared, j 'lhey Wouldn't turn in the lock either. ..Well, with. outnoticing,what<I was doing, I took hold of the knob, and open comes , the door!: It wasn't locked!- I hopped in and Bhook.ofl the towel, and great.Ctesar's ghost!" - - " What!-what'd you see, Tom p" ! . ; . :. f'Huok, I-most stepped on .to ;Injun Joe's -hand." ."Nor.'.-. ." ^ :n Tear-: He ultras'. laying, there,' ;sound asleep \- on: the floor,7 .with his .'old patch < on his eye and his arras spread-out." . .. ..: "Lordy, what did you:do?-'-Did he wake .up?" ;. .; . -.:. .
