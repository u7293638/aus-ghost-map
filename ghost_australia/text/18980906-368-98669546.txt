Another "Ghost." Melbourne, Sunday.—During the past 10 days "a ghost" has been promenading the outskirts of Bendigo, much to the terror of the womanfolk; but efforts to capture the perpetrator of the scare have been unsuccess- ful. One evening the contents of a shot gun were discharged at the jokist, apparently without doing any damage, and a couple of evenings later a plucky young woman threw a stone at him, and the "ghost" retaliated by brutally striking her in the face with his fist. About 2 o'clock yesterday morning a tramway employee saw a figure in white staring at him from behind a fence. The employee was armed with a revolver, but was too frightened to use it.
