THE EVANGELICAL ALLIANCE On Monday afternoon, August 30, a meeting of ministers and members of Evangelical Churches in South Australia was held at the Veatry of the Presbyterian Church, Flinders- •beet Thmr m ? lire ? iHmijim af ?hMrn and laymen, and the Rev. M. H. Hodge having been voted to the chair, called on the Rev. James Way to offer prayer. The Caaiuus then ???miiinil that the ob ject of the meeting was to daaeas a. draft con stitution of the proposed Evangelical Union. He stated that fas baa <?% hastily gbnoed through Hie Oonstitatian. bat be believed it vac such tint if ha principles were worked out, it would tend to the benefit of (he individnals connected with the Society uml eff the Chin Act with whom mv* iadrndaals were essoaated. The Rev. J. Lyall anaounced having re cem&a; Utter from tbe Rev. Mr. Nicholls, of Brighton, iiM jiii fan warm ajiniiollij in tfee movement,and inextreme regretthslhe n I amble to be present that ?fhngoa. ' ?tbe U&4TT cojutmivnoa. The meeting then proceeded to diseaa* tbe Draft Constitiittoii a* submitted to the ministers iwnemhlcri oc the previous Monday afternoon. "GehkealPhwcipms.—l. TfritUiiaAlHumr is not to be considered aa alliaaane of dfnosrins tions or branches of the Cfaareh, bat af indm dual Christians, each acting on bia own reapoa rihaay." ~~* %*r ~ This m carried without digramina. "H. That in tins Affiance it is distinctly de clared that no compromise of the views of aaj meenber, or sanction of those of others on the polati wherein tfaejr differ it either required or expected, bat that all are held as free as before to maintain aad advocate their renpoos eonnc tions, with doe forbeanaee and brotherly love,*' With respect to thu prinople. Mc?oKFO?DstartedailiaiwiuM. HeOoaght itcbufced withittie article "objeet?," aad he asked for infbrmaEkm as to what were the prevailing errors against which Cbristaan tnttt was to be defended. Did it refer to the differ enees among themselves? The Chaibmav mid it was pretty well known what the prerafliag errors irfetieJ to w?ie —tbe •ran which were spoken of were fonaamc?tal, aad were well known without more specUicaDy. The Rev. Mr. Jefferis renwrlrfd that dnter eneea among themselves would not be consi dered as prevailing errors. Dr. Campbell suggested that if their difiaences were to be considered prevailing errors, no bsau of cvaa gelieal alliance eoold take place. (Gbeen.) He moved, and Mr. Cumming seconded the naVo? tion of this principle. Mr. G. W. Cotton wished to know distinctly if tt was an dentood that they wet* not to discos the divergence of their religious views. Unless this were definitely known, he conld not be one of the Alliance. The Rev. Mr. Henderson said bo comproaase whatever of aay ?C their respec- tive denominational principles was intended. The Rev. Mr. Casely thought there aboaU be a brosder bask of mkn, Se that of the Eva. gebed Allisnee of &aglaad.; beesase with out snefa a. basis they ought have sefsw tets of the Unitatian and Baaaaa Catholic Cbarehes osauag into their midst.

The Rev. Mr. Millard moved tbat they I adopt flat as their basis. Unless they did so he believed they would n> mStj asteay and meet with insnpecsble Jt&Wlti;^ indedming to associate with persona who denied the Dal* of the bird Jem Christ; or the Deity sad personality of the Holy Gfawt, or the cardinal doctnne of justification by faith alone. (Cheers.) The Rev. Mr. Binks seconded. Seeing the amount of time and ability devoted to tine preparation of tbe con stitution of the Bnttsh Evangelical Alliaaee he tbooght they need not hesitate to adopt it, especially after the manner in which the Alliance bad worked together, and the good it j iudamoupliahed. A question then araae uto i whether it would not be better to sabout tbe point, of tbe doctrinal basis to the saeeting seriatim, and Mr. Millard moved tbe adoption j of the first item—the doctrine of the Divine mapsaiion, authority, and sumeieucy of the Scnptnrea. The Rev. Mr. Jefferis expressed ieelittg considerable diffica% in providing far to any creed. He beaonaed to s. Church that didn't Bke tensAOtiraaaai?to creed* of binra devising, and be feared they would be mrrowiag the mrailinshui iacaZ euaUy if they ventared to adopt a basis of this kind. Mr. Burford thought if they earned tedoetdne of the DMtsTnamintion; isAerity, ul snnVieacr of the Halftones that that ami be the only hams of union. Mr. Earl felt conriaeed thai if (hey amdnliwdi to make a creed ud to tM sal every oae to aabacribe to it, that tbey would Bad conwdeTihV difieaUy in euiruj ?a the Affiance with any degree of ancoeas. He saw M> aeeemity for maki?g creeds of bun making mha,tbeTh*A*Oirituane4. The Rev. Mr. Jefferis reminded Mr. Earl that nearly all Lhe heresies with which the Chan* had been ?flitted had been fonad in the Keriptare*. (Cham.) The Rev. Mr. Patchell questioned wry bncb if they eou W hire an Evangelical Alliance wHhont a doetriaal baas. Hempie pared to mite heartily with the Evangelical miaiaVas, bat be ?w not prepared to mite with aaen who denied cardinal *eetriaea. The Rev. Mr. Wright remarked that if they simply canied the fint doctrine, the Unitarian* would be admitted, and he co?M as aooa unite with a dub who denied the divinity and work of the Holy Ghost in the eonvercion of soals a* he could with Unitarians. Mr. COTTON felt cer tain that if they were to hare an Evangelical Alliance it anut be on some each basis as that of the Alliance of Engbad. Dr. Campbell thought the additional daaat at the end of the doctrinal basis of the Eugliafa Alliance tended to Bailiff almost entireir what thebash set forth; and he thought if they were going to discass a, doetii?al lost tbfry would get into a great muddle and into many dhacaitira. If the basis was adopted there must be some machinety befaind it by which ?tanbenewki be admitted to (he Union. The Rev. Mr. Jefferis thought if they could only bit on a. method of defining what they all Meant by Evangelical Chcrches that all diffi culty woold be reuKrred. He believed if they could accept woe definition ef the words "Bnagetical Chinches'' without adapting any partacohr basis, they woqU secure *U their object, and amid all their daugeva. The Rev. Mr. Henderson still thought tbey should pressed witt (he eooadention of tue hao*. -.ad be did not sympathise with the fours exj<r<*ard as to creeds, because tbey eoald {bwJ tbna advet in (he aaane way a* had been done by U.^ Bngjkh Alliance. Mr. Burford thoaglit the AUaaee nhoald be open to all who might admission. The Rev. Mr. Price felt a strong objection to any creeds, ns did Mr. Jefferis, hot be rounded boa that m Uwir <ns? Cbwrel** they had their own aadfntood general was of the trnth-feheer^-alth-flgh they aught not care to term ttimr ririri agreed.

Mr. OonC fAt tint be was m? of the octaves lefaied to by the last speak?r ?• prttmg ??t the UUe " B/rngAUaX |<reK* iae," and he (hwaght that soeh Un^ttgt vm awfaeoondng sad he was ajrry it had been a*ed.

Why were they net one Cfaneh, and what need of any Aloaaee* H. ?ilijt?i>d to aay hnatan creed, and said they shaaM tab the Serinaics atoa* as their rale of faith aad practice. The Rev. Mr. Henderson moved as an amendment to Mr. Millard's proposition —"That the basis of the Evangelical Alliance of England be ac- ceptedhiMb.- Tinswaia?candedby the Rev.

Mr. Shaw noved Oat the pourfa of ike baaw be pot aeriatiML, remarking that whilst be bensred in the eternity ?f the soul, he did not eonsiAer that the haaMstaat? of the aoal was to be aicd in the ruae sense. Mr. Burford moved, and the Rev. F. W.
