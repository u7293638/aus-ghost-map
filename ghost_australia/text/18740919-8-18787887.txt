CHAPTER IX. G0DFÄEY SCHT/ÏLEB. It waa the day after Edith's visit to her mother, and taking advantage of the hour when Mrs. Sinclair took her after-luuch nap, she went out with her book into the grounds, and strolled on until she came to a clump of trees at the furthest extremity of the park, where was a little rustic chair This had always been her favorite resort, the place she sought when she wished to be alone, and here she sat down, ostensibly to read, but really to think -not so much of the past as of the future That her kind, indul- gent mistress, who had been an invalid for so many | years, and whom many pronounced only nervous and I fidgetty, was failing fast, was very apparent to her experienced eyes and only that morning she had observed that the handkerchief Mrs Sinclair held to her lips after a paroxysm of cough had a faint color- ing of blood upon it " And where shall I And a home like this when she is gone?' Edith asked herself, sadly. "I might go back to mother and help her with her sewing, and take Kitty's place," she said, shuddering a little as she thought of the small bouse in Caledonia Btreet, BO different from the pleasant home which had been hers for more than two years She might go out as a governess again, but when she remembered the insult which she had twice re- ceived when a governess, once from the y oung man of the house, who looked upon her as lawful prey, and once from the master, a brutal wretch who could not withstand her beauty, she thought any life pre- ferable to that Her face and manner were both against her, and if Mrs Sinclair died, her only safety was in her mother s house " Yes, that will be the end of it," she said, a little bitterly, as she remembered all her mother had hoped for her and what she had once hoped for herself So much was she absorbed in these reflections that she did not at first see the two gentlemen who bad entered the Park by a side gate, not far distant, and were walking slowly up the path which led directly past the chair in which she was sitting Two young gentlemen she thought them, for one at least was very young, with a supple, spncgj grace in every movement, whUe the other, whose step was quite as rapid, though it had more dignity and character in it, could not be old, or even middle-aged, with that fine, erect form, that heavy, silken beaid, and wealth of dark brown bair That it could be Col Schuyler and his son she never dreamed, for though Mis Sin- clair had said her brother was not j et forty-two, Edith, who, like most joungpeople, held forty asan age bordering an antediluviamsm, thought of him always as a greyi6h-haired man, with a stoop, per- haps, and a slow tread, and not at all like this man coming so swiftly toward her, and pointing out something in the Park to his companion Ile had evidentlj been at Oakwood before, for she heard him say. "We ought to see the house from this point This must be a new path since I was here, and yet I re- member that little ioot-bridge Your mother and I used often to come down to it, she liked to see the water falling over the white stones That was nine- teen j ears ago " " Hush-sb, father ' look, there's a young lady sil- ting in the shadow of those trees," came warmngly fiom the younger man, or boy, andthen,withagieat heart-throb, Edith knew who the strangers were and arose to her feet lhey were quite up to her now, and both removed their hats and stood with heads uncovered, while the elder said to her '1 beg jour pardon, miss, but will (his path take us directlj to the house at Oakwood ? I was here many jeais ago, and ought to know the waj, but it seems a little strange to me " His voice was very pleasant, and his manner defe- rential, as he stood looking at her, while, with a Qeep flush upon her usually white cheeks, Edith re- plied that the path did lead duectly to the house, which could be seen as soon as he reached the slight dechvitj yonder Then, with eyes cast down, she stood waiting for him to pass on, she thinking of that one time when she had spoken to him from the window of the cottage )n tar off Hampstead, and he thinking of the marvellous beauty of her face, and woudeimg who she could be "Some guest at Oakwood undoubtedlj," be thought, and then he put another question to her. and said, " Do you know if Mrs Sinclair is at home this morning ? I am her brother, Colonel Schujler, from America, and this is my sou Godfrey " With a bow to both gentlemen Edith replied " Mrs ¡sinclair ia at home, and is expecting you I am Edith Lyle, Mrs Sinclair's hired companion " She said tins proudlj, and witb a purpose not to deceive the gentlemen with regard to her position longer than was necessarj. She had so often been ipoken to bj strangers in just the respectful defe- rential toue with which Colonel Schujler had addressed her, and then had seen the look of unmistakable interest give place to one of surprise and indifference when her real position was known, that she wished to start fair with these guests of her emplojer, and she was neither astonished nor disappointed when she saw the peculiar look she knew so well steal over the grave, proud face of Colonel Schuyler, who bowed swiftly as he said "Ob, yes I knew she had some young person stajmg with her Thanks for your directions We shall find our way now very well Come Godfrey ' But Godfrey was in no particular haste to go on A beautiful girl was attractive to him under all cir- cumstances, whether the daughter of a hundred earls, or the paid compa on of his aunt, and lus manner had not changed one whit when Edith an- nounced herself as his inferior according to the creed of the beau monde " Come, my son," Colonel Schuyler said again, and then Godfrey passed on with a look at Edith, which plainly said " I'd enough sight rather stay with you, ¡jut you see it's impossible " It was the old, old storj , contempt from the older ones and impertinence from the younger so so soon as she was known for a dependent, Edith thought, and a few hot, resentful tears trickled through the white Angers she pressed to her eyes as the two men walked away and were lost to view over the little hill. And yet for once she was mis- taken Colonel Schujler had felt no contempt for her, he never felt that for any woman , and the change in his manner, when he found who she was, was involuntary, and owing wholly to hiB early training, which had built a hairier between himself and those who earned their daily biead' He had taken Edith foi the possible young ladj of some noble house, and was disappointed to find her only the companion of his sister, but a lady still, judging from her manners and speech , while Godfrey, though an intolerable tease, would sooner have parted with his right hand than have been rude to any woman A dress, whether it hung m slatternly folds around a washerwoman, or adorned the daughter of a duchess, was sacred in his ejes, and though ma certain way he bad all the pnde of the Schuj lers and Rossiters combined, it was a pride which prompted him to treat everj one kindly His mother, who had been very fond ot him, had done her best to make him understand that as a Rossiter and Schujler, it behooved him to demean himself like one worthy of so illustrious a line of ancestry, but Godfrey did not care for ancestrj, nor blood, nor social distinctions, and played with every ragged boy in Hampstead, and sat for hours with old Peterkm, the cobbler, and kept little Johnnie Mack at Schujler hill all day when his mother was out working, and the child would bave been alone but for this thoughtfulness JEverjbodj knew Godfrey Schujler, and everybody liked bim , a id even now, as I, Ettie Armstrong, the village schoolmistress, write of him, with the echo of his marriage bells ringing in my ears, I feel again the warm kiss from his full, red, boyish Ups, just as I used to feel it often during that one summer when he was my pupil m the old red school-house, and kept us constantly stirred up with bis love of fun and frolic. How many flowers and berries, and grapes and apples he brought me, and how his handsome saucy eyes would laugh up into mine when I tried to re- prove him. Oh, Godfrey, Godfrey, you were v erj dear lo me once-ay, are very dear still, and when I saw you go by to jour bridal with the great happiness shining in jour face, I prayed Heaven to bless j ou as you deserved, and so did many another one to whom you have been like the very brightness of the morning An intolerable tease, Godfrey was something of a terror to his eldest sister Julia, whose imperious and sometimes insolent manners he mimicked and ridiculed, while to Alice Creighton, of New "iork, who he knew bad been selected for his wife, be was a perpetual source of joy and annoyance both-joy when he treated her with that tenderness and gentle- ness so natural to him in his intercourse with girls, and annoyance when even with his arm around her waist he mimicked her affected wajs and her constant allusions to "when I was abroad " In stature Godfrey was tall, with a graceful, willowy form, a bright, though rather dark com plexijn, soft, laughing blue eyes, with a world of mischief m them, and rieb brown air which clus- tered m curls about his forehead, and which he parted in the middle until his sister Julis, who did not like it, called him a prig and an ape, while Alice, who did like it, said it wis " pretty, and just as the young noblemen wore their hair when she was abroad " That was enough for Godfrey If Alice Creighton liked it because she saw it abroad, he surely would not fol- low the fashion, and the next morning ut breakfast his curly locks were parted on the side very near to his left ear, and a black ribbon bound two or three tames around his head to keep his refractory hair in its place " If ever be went abroad he hoped he should not make a fool of himself by sniffing at his own country and swallow every thing foreign, from French frogs and snails to the Pope's great toe 1 ' he said, and now that he was abroad, he bristled all over with nation- ality, and wore his country outside as plainly as if be had placarded on his back-" I am an American, and proud of it, too " Nothing was quite equal to New York m his esti- mation, and particularly was he averse to the rosy, healthy-looking girls whom he everywhere met, and m his bist letter to his sisters and Alice he told them tbey were beauties compared with the Encii»h cnrio " even if Alice's nose was a pug and Jule'o forehead so low that it took a microscope to find it, and Em's ankles no bigger than a pair of knitting- needles " But when he came upon Edith Lyle, in her simple white wrapper, with the knot of blue ribbon in her golden brown hair, and her perfectly transparent complexion, he acknowledged to himself that here I at last, even on English soil, was a woman more beautiful than anything he had ever seen across the water, and he took off his hat and stood uncovered before her as readily as if she had been the queen. That she was only Edith Lyle, his aunt's companion, instead of the bigh-born lady he had at first supposed her to be, made no difference with htm She was a woman, a girl, and as he reached the little hill beyoDd where she was sitting, he turned to look at her again, and said - " By George, father, isn't she a beauty p" Mr Schuyler knew to whom his son referred, and answered, in his usual grave, quiet way " She had a fine profile, I thought. Yes, certainly, a remarkable profile " They were near the house by this time, and m the excitement of meeting with his sister and the long conversation which followed, he hardly thought of Edith again until dinner was announced, and she came in with Godfrey. That young man had soon jjrown. tired of listening to talk about people and things dating back to a time he could not remember, and had sauntered out into the grounds in quest of Edith, who was more to his taste than the close drawing-room and the invalid on the couch Edith was in the summer-house now, and Godfrey joined her there, and in his pleasant, winning way asked if he was intruding, and if he might come in and occupy one of the chairs, which looked so tempting under the green vines " It was an awful bore to hear old folks talk about a lot of antediluvian«," he said, "and if she did not mind he would sit with her awhile " Edith nodded assent and motioned him to a chair, which he took, and removing his soft hat and brush- ing back his curls, he said " Now let us talk " To talk was Godfrey's delight, and when to Edith's interrogatory " What shall we talk abaut ?" he replied " Whatever you like," and she rejoined "Tell me, then, of yourself and your home in America," he mentally pronounced her a fine girl, with no nonsense abeut her, and in less than an hour had told nearly all he knew of himself and of his family They had a splendid place at Hamp- stead, be said, not so big and rambling as the fine houses in England, but pleaBanter every way, and more home-like, with such a fine view of the Hudson and the blue mountains bey ond, " You have never been m America ?" he said, affirmatively, thus saving Edith the necessity of answering, " and so you do not know how beautiful the Hudson is Why, it beats the Rhine all to nothing " "Have you seen the Rhine f " Edith asked, smiling at this enthusiastic youth, so wholly American. "No," and Godfrey blushed as he met her smile, " but I've read of it, and heard Alice Creighton rave about it by the hour and still I know the Hudson is ahead 1 ou ought to see it once in the neigh- bourhood of the Highlands, the view from our tower is magnificent, with those blue peaks stretching away in the distance, and using one above the other until 1 used to think them the stairs which led to Heaven " How Edith's heart throbbed as she listened to his animated description of a place she, too, knew so well, though of her knowledge she dared not give a sign , and how she longed to question her companion of that grave on the hillside, but she could not, and as Godfrey evidently expected her to say something, she asked if he bad always lived in Hampstead " No , I was bom where a chap ought to be born to be all right, you know-ou Fifth avenue, m a blown stone front, so that the fiist breath I drew was sufficiently stuffy and aristocratic , but I went to the country when I was a little shaver, five or six years old Father took the old house down and built the new one I never shall forget it-never, for the dreadful thing which happened " Edith knew just what was coming, and steeled herself to listen to the details of that tragedy which had colored her whole life. Again the fingers of iron were clutching her throat, and suffocating her almost to madness, while Godfrty told of the young man whom he liked so much, and who had saved another's life at the loss of his own " And when they reached bim, the grass was wet with blood, and he lay white, and still, and dead " Godfrey's voice tiembled as he said these words, and he paused a moment in his tale, while Edith clasped her hands tightly together and tried to speak but could not for the smothered sensation choking and stifling her so " We buried him in our own lot, and bought him a grand monument, and there are many flowers round the spot," Godfrey continued, and then he glanced at Edith, and starting up, exclaimed " Why, what is the matter ? You are whiter than a ghost You are not going to faintv You must not faint ! I don't know what to do with girls who faint Alice did it once, or made believe, and I kissed her and bl ought her to quicker " He did not kiss Edith, or offer to, but he fanned her with his soft hat until she waved him off, and found Voice to say " It is the heat, and your vivid description of that poor fellow's death. Did you tell me he was mar- ried ?" She asked the question from an intense desire to know if any thing had ever been said of herself m connection with the dead " No, he was not married, but there was some talk of an affaire-du-coeur between bim and a young i/Qglish girl, who went off soon after There's a bug on y our dress. Miss Lyle. Why"-and, as if it had just occurred to him, Godfrey continued-" your name is the same as his. It cannot be, though, that you weie at all related He lived up near Alnwick On our way from Scotland, father and I hunted up his friends, a sister and widowed mother-poor but honest women, as the biographers say The mother lives with her daughter, and we gave them a thousand dollars, and the young woman pro- mised to call her little boy after me. The Gover- nor-that's father-did not quite like it, I gue«s, but I don't see the harm Why, I've named three different Dutch babies in Hampstead, all the children of Mrs Peterkin Vandeusenhisen Two of them are twins-And I called one Godfrey Scbuy 1er, and the other Schuyler Godfrey-while the third, which happened to be a girl, was christened Alice Creighton -that's a young lady from New York, father's ward, who is at Hampstead a great deal- and oh, so proud ' You ought to have seen her bit of a pug no»e go up when she heard the Dutch baby baptized Why, she nearly jumped out of her skin when Mrs Van-as I call her for short-on being asked for the name, re- plied 'Alice Creighton Vandeusenhisen, if you please.' The last was a suggestion of my own, by way of making a more striking impression on Alice, because, you see, Mrs Vandeusenhisen had a son Peterkin, junior, who was in love with Miss Creigh- ton, and used to send her cakes of maple sugar and sticks of molasses candy he made and pulled himself You ought to see his bands ' The day before the christening I dressed up like a gipsy, and deceived the girls and told their fortune, and said Alice would marry a Dutchman, with an awful long name, like Vandue something So complete was my disguise that they did not suspect me, and when Alice heard the name at church, Alice Creighton Vandeusenhisen, she started up as if to forbid the banns, and then catching sight of my face she understood it at once, and was so angry , and when we were home from church she cried and said she hated me, and would never speak to me ajain But she got over it, and last Christmas sent a wax doll with a squawk m its stomach to her naaiesuke " Godfrey had wandered very far from the woman on the heather hills who had called Abefard Lyte her son, and though Edith wished to know some- thing more of her she did uot venture to question her companion lest he should wonder at her interest in an entire stranger She had laughed immode- rately at his aecouut of the babies named for himself and Miss Alice, and when be finished she said " l'ou must be very fond of children, I think " "lea, I am I'd like a houseful, and when I marry I mean to have enough boys to make a brass band. I told Alice so once, and her pug went higher than it did when she beard the baby's name She called me a wretch, and an insulting dog, and said she hated boys, and me most of all 1 knew she didn't, though, becau»e you see, well, Alice has ten thousand a y ear, and that will straighten the worst case of turn-up nose m the world She is an orphan, and father is her guardian, and he and mother and Uncle Calvert, that's my half-uncle and Alice's, too, put their heads together and thought she'd be a good match for me, and it is rather an understood thing that we wil» marry sometime, but I don't believe we aie half as likely to as if they d said nothing about it A fellow don't want his wife picked out and brought to him off-hand, as Eve was brought to Adam." Here Godfrey paused, and rising from his chair shook down his pants, a habit of his when he was in- terested or excited, and as his sister Julia said, " bad talk on the brain " He certainly had it now, for Edith was the first one he had found whom he had cared to talk to since leaving the ship, and after two or three shakes he resumed his seat, and told her of himself particularly, how he was going to college the next year, if be was home in time, and after that in- tended to study law and distinguish himself, if pos- sible ' Mother was very proud of me, and hoped great things of me," he said " I do not wish to disappoint her, for though ehe is dead, I cannot help tbinkmg that she knows about me just the same, and when I am tempted to yield to what you call the small vices I al way feel her thin white hands on my head where she laid it not long before she died, and said, ' Be a good and great man, Godfrey, and avoid the first ap proachea of evil ' Mother was what they call a fashionable woman, but she was good before she died, and so sure as there is a heaven, so sure she is there, and I've never smoked, nor touched a drop of spirits, nor Bworn a word since she died, and I never mean to either " Godfrey's voice was low and tender, and his manner subdued when he spoke of his mother, but very dif- ferent when he touched upon his Bisters and ridiculed Julia's fine lady airs and Emma's readiness to be stuffed- his definition for believing everything Bhe heard, even to the most preposterous story. They were at Schuyler Hill now, he said, and Alice was there too, studying with their governess, Miss Brown- ing, who between the three, was awfully nagged, though she was quite as airy and stuck-up as Alice and Jule, and called him " that dreadful boy ! ' " Boy, indeed I and I most eighteen, and standing five feet ten in my socks, to say nothing of this in- cipient badge of manhood," and he stroked com- placently his chin and upper lip, where the beginning of a brown beard was visible How he had rattled on, his fresh young face glow- ing and hchting up with nts excitement, and how intently Edith listened and watched the play of his fine features, and admired his boyish beauty ! Surely m him there was nothing but goodness and truth, and as she looked at him she felt glad that his young life was spared, though she could not understand why her husband must have been sacrificed for him Once in her bitterness she had feit that she hated Godfrey Schuyler, but she did not hate him now, and as she walked slowly with him toward the house, she would have given much to have been as fresh, and frank, and open as he was, instead of living the lie she was living And to what intent ? What good had the deception ever done her p What good could it do her, and why continue it longer ? Why not be just wbat she was, with no concealment hanging over har, and startling her of times with a dread of discovery ? Why not tell Godfrey all about herself just as he had told ber of himself? Surelv, his recent talk with her would warrant such confidence, and why not commence at once a new life by ODenne«s and sincerity, even though she lost her place bv it f " I'll do it 8Dd brave my mother, who alone has stood in my way BO long," she thought, and without giv rag herself time to remember, she began -" Mr. Schuyler"-but before she could Bay any more, he interrupted her with " Don't, please, call me that. I'm too much of a boy. Nobody says that but Alice when she ii m a highfalutin' mood. Call me Godfrey, please, unless the name is too suggestive of ' Godfrey's Cordial,' in which case say Schujler, but pray leave off the Mister till my whiskers will at least cast a shadow on the wall Whj', I dare say I shall call you by your first name yet. You cannot be much my semor. How old are you, Miss Lyle p" It was a question which a little later m life, when more accustomed to the world and its usages, God- frey would not have asked, but Edith answered unhesitatingly, " I am twenty-seven." "Zounds!" said Godfrey. " You don't look it. I did not imagine you more than twenty. Why, you might almost be my mother I No, it will never do to call you Edith. Father's eyebrows would actually meet in the center at such audacity on my part ; that's a trick he has of scowling when disagreeably surprised Notice it sometimes, please Tbe only wrinkle in his face is that valley between his eyes." Thej were in the hall by this time, and bowing to her voluble acquaintance, Edith passed on to her room, where for half an hour or more she sat think- ing of the strange Prrvidence which had brought her so near to her past life, and wondering, too, what the result would be, and if she should tell Godfrey, as she had fully intended to do, when he interrupted her with his tide of talk It did not seem as easy to do it now as it had a little while ago, the good op- portunity was gone and might not return While thus musing the dressing bell rang, and turning from the window she began to dress for dinner with rather more interest than usual. Her salary would not allow a very extensive or expensive wardrobe, even if she had desired it, which she did not Her taste was simple, and she was one of the few to whom every color and style is becoming. Whatever she wore looked well upon her, and m ? little country town she would undoubtedly have set the fashion for all Selecting now from her ward- robe a soft, fleecy, gray tissue, with trimmings of pale blue, her favourite colour, she tied about bel throat n bit of rich lace which Mrs Sinclair had given her, and wore the pretty set of pink coral, also that lady's gift It was not often tbat she curled her hair, but to-day she let two heavy ringlets fall upon her neck, and knew herself how well she was look- ing when, at tbe nnging of the second bell, she descended to the hall, where Godfrey was waiting for her. He had thought her very handsome in her morning wrapper and garden hat, and when he saw her now he gave a suppressed kind of whistle, and with as much freedom as if she had been Alice Creighton, or one of his sisters, said to her, " Ain't you nobbj, though !" It is doubtful if Edith knew just what nobby meant, but she set it down as an Americanism, and knew she was complimented "Allow me," Godfrey said, and offering her his arm, he conducted her to tbe dining room, where his aunt and father were already assembled. (To be contmued)
