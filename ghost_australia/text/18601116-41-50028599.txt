^ARLIAMBNTAEY BUSINESS. The' dosing of the reomt session of the ' 3ritish Parliament was the occasion of a ' )itter .article in tho Ttmet against tho reckless iraate,of timo which character™.* tho n««imt- ' - moae ,ot conducting legislative businew. After ' seven, months ofhard drudgery, _with the ' exception of two measures, Bverything, wean told, .* for which Her Majesty thants Padia ment.has been done at the feg end of the session by. .a tenth-part ef the Legisfctuw iEverybody has .been, active, j^ith the single ^ception-of Parh'ament.

The .Prince of Wales and his colonial entertainers have 'done something. Parliament alone. has intended and talked, and hoped and feared, ? ,and seen and lamented, .and disagreed- an,d * postponed, and so frittered away the time: till the prorogation stared it in.the face, and then it made a hasty distribution of its effects, did something forJffiminals, sailoM,-landlords and tenants, charities,- thM' Eoina^Patholica, and then gave up the ghost.

Parliaments, however^ are becoming ^aore and more.talkative— 'The inordioate vanity of certain members of the Legislature^1 ' according to the. Times, sacrificed many valu able' months of the last session, causing some 1 useful measures to be set aside altogether,:and ^ compelling the Government to hurry dther* tliroiugh the House with af haste, not.afc.all. conduoive to the publio welfare. .The writer savs;:-:ccIt would probably not be difficult t» mentidrj' the names Of some ten gontlem^n whoBe opinions are as muoh without weight or J authority as their arguments are withont-poiat:,!: or force, but who {lave squandered, more of tho timo of the Legislature than all the rest of ^ Parliament p^-^tpgethelr.cr' These are the, . movers of perpetual adjournments, the inoes^ sant proposers ;.oX. useless and purposeless } questions, the men who, have always something -J to interpose between the House andCommittea' 't of Supply, and who have always something to ,' ' eay' -which, being pertinent , to Both ing, eUo -v fibdsits way into print among ths agree&bl;^Jl' varieties which usher in the vote of adjourn** ?- mer^t from Eriday to Monday.

' ' ' ' ' ' ' . , ' ' ? '?. . '~ - ? The House . of Commons, we need' hardly - -t say, is not the only place of legislation to\ which this complaint applies. It takes outf^' smnll Colonial Legislatures aa many n\ontha' to' ' get through their little business, as aro - ' occupied by the British Senate itself. Nor an republican Parliaments at all exempt from the evil. It is said, indeed, that American legu« i latprs are induced,' not 'only by love of,taljrv but also by love of payj to make their segsiorii ' long, Binca their remuneration dopeads upaa-- th^i length of their sittings..' But, looking at- ,, the evil now as feltjonlyin British Parliament!. ' and asoomplained of by tbe Times, how ia it to be lessened ? -The only remedy suggested } by|the writer is, that the systoni of appointing' Standing Committees aud Seleit Commit-' ^ tees Bhould bo extended, and tliat much of: the work now talked about in th« Ilouse should be done by those Com-' mittee.'. There is at the present time one ''; very important duty performed in Committee -? wliich used always to. devolve upon the Hoiue^t : t but which it could not now possibly fiod time, ., ? to 'attend to. We refer te the mode of dealing-: with petitions. During the recent session of . Parliament, we learn, there were as many a* ;: .?. 2^,264 petitions received by the House of CdmmonB, and the whole of these documents. V* w?re referreci, in accordance with the ususlj 1 ' practice, to a Standing Committee, which?-— ~. reported from time to time, and whichjjafter'^ reading through the petitions, selected. ,l,68li ''?':%. of \ them for publication.' There is other busiv - ;' nesa, the writer, in the. Times thinks, whicii^ ? might be disposed of in the same manner, and':' ' which, curiously enough, there aro apparently1 ^. sufficient patient, plodding members to-undet^ ^ ta^cei.
