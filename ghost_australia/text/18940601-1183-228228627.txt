I QUEER MILITARY ORDER. HIE chaplain of the forty-ninth Tennessee Regiment, Rev. J. H. McNeilty, remembers tho first battle order hn ever heard. And well ho inayâ€” it way so peculiar. It was in the fall of 1861, at Fort Donelson, where there wore only somo half a dozen companies fortifying and drilling. Tho new chaplain wns missing with tho sonior enptain. In those days, ho says, tho men had not yet given up all homo habits. Tlicy woro whito shirts and undor clothes, and every night undressed and went to bed ' like folks.' Ono day it was rumoured the gunboats were in tlio rivor bolow us, and wore coming up. About midnight, while nil wero sleeping soandly, tlio long roll began to beat in tho company stationed on tho river bank. At onco there was a stir in the camp. Officers wore calling men to fall in, and there was much hurrying to and fro. Captain Beaumont wns always careful about his dress when on duty, and oven now he did not neglect his toilet. Quickly he put on his uniform, and buckled on his sword, nnd stepped out of his tont to take command of his company. But his men had not beon so thoughtful. Tlioy sprang up and grasped their muskots, and formed in line in front of their tents but ovcry iinin of them lind forgotten to put on his trousers, and there tlicy stood in the starlight, in their night clothes like ' sheeted ghosts,' trembling with cold and excitement. As the captain and I stepped out, and his eye glanced along the line, his sense of propriety got the bettor of hismilitary(ardour and ho shouted out his first command : 1 Confound your foolish souls, go and put on your breeches I' Tho situation dawned on tho men, and with shouts of laughter they prepared for battle putting on those needful articles of apparel. Aftor all it was a false alarm, and they were soon sent to bed again.
