» to the editor of tub age. Sir, — Roforring to tbo report of tbe committee in this caso, it appears perplexing to me, as au uneducated man, bearing in mind tbat a neigh bor, in tbo county of Waterford, was ablo,. about twelve years since, to divest himself legally of bis . ecclesiastical faculties. The late Lord Stuart De Deciea had an only son - iu holy orders of the English Establishment who got a living in Lin colnshire. As the bouorublc and Reverend Henry Windsor Villiers Stuart, tlio boo. gontleman ap- Siied to bis Grace tho Right Honorable and Most .ovorend Fathor in God. tho Lord Archbishop of Canterbury) to caiicel lus ordinatiou and with draw tho, faculties conferred on biui by the imposition of hands aud inspiration of tho Holy Ghost. The Lord Archbishop by and with tho advico of bis Chancollor and Arcbiepiscopa! Council granted tho application in as full and ample manner as if he hud never been ordained, In tbo foliowiug year, 011 tho dea'-h of the most noblo and Rev. J. G. Marquis of Waturford, tho Earl of Tyrone, M.IY for Waterford, being elo- vatcd to. the Houso of Pobra, was succeeded by tbo hon. H. W. "V. Stuart as M.P. for Watorford. Tho, decision iu Lord Stuart'B case is at right angles with that" of Dr. Macartnoy, and tbo oviucnco of Canon Handfield aud Dr. Hcarni as exports, at variance with tho archie- piscopal see of Canterbury To an ordinary porson tho committco coocludo that tbe Cburch of England lioro is a reformed Oatholio cburch by \- confirming tbo indelibility of priests' orders in that ehurcb. — Yours, &o.;, JOHN PHELAN.
