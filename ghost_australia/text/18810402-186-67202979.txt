Mt first gust next morning 3a leaving the apartment where I had slept, «» for the uuxnose of fnrrr**™™r whether my bsdreom na«^ again entered after I had left it on tlK previous evening. I mbtfad fte 4»c, and cautiously looked in. Enough light came through between the drawn antaios to shew me that tiie room was appamitiy as I Mt H. I advanced to tbe window and bud the thread there, unbroken, and evidently untouched. I most confess I felt somewhat disappointed. My fears had probably exaggerated my conceptions of the danger, and IhadMtkjjetedl second visit as more than probable. After thinking, however, I came to the ajoctaonn that it was better as it was. Had my stxange visitor for any purpose eufaacd my room a second time, and fanad Hat I had quitted it, the eSect might bare been the ran of favourable to a discovery of the trickery, which discovery could best be forwarded by making as little change in my usual habits as possible. It -was not improbable. seeing that no suspicion had been annse&b; fee knowledge that L had changed my deeping apartment, that tins ' ghost ' might be flfnKAfawi to pay me a visit on -the ' following night; and by that time I hoped -to be able to arrange for the interception of my strange visitor. Hid the oetectjon of tbe trick. * In the course of the WM*''*^ I had made up mind how I should proceed. Mrs. Weevil generally left after breakfast on her errands to the neighbouring village or elsewhere, sot generally — *-~ jig for a tew boors ; and I thought this was a good time to obtain aa ? interview with Andrew the old gardener, who, I eaw, vas engaged +~m»W the wilts is front of the door. I had no doubt bow that what I had saen had been also appearing to Hie servants who had so suddenly departed on the previous evening ; and I had no donbt also that Andrew knew tbe whole story about the ghost having been again seen m tbe home. I opened the parJocr window, and spoke with him over the balcony. ' WIU you mne im nrifm Andrew* I should Eke to speak to JOB.* He stood fart moment in hesitation, scratch ing Inaheall.
