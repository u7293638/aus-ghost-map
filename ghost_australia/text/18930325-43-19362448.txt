LOVERS OF WARMTH. AY The intention of fire was a'great step in the progress of the human race, and it is not strange that'so many uncivilised peoples have superstitious notions! con nected with it. When our Australia* aborigines camp for the - night' a fire J is lighted in front of each hut—the huts be ing made of boughs, with the: openings carefully turned away from the wind—so that thefeet of those, who are sleeping within may be kept * warm. i If one of their, relatives has lately died, an additional, and ,solitary fitc is lighted at a little distance froni the huts, where the ghost of the deceased may sit down and warm himself without disturb ing the family hearth. '• ' ■ i ■ \ .In fact; warmth is so great a necessity to the natives.lhat they seem to think the dead can only by degrees become accos tomedio the want of it, and the airing of a grave by kindling i fire within it is a very important ceremony at a funeral. This same love of warmth creates an aversion to early rising, the natives are seldom seen abroad until! the sun has been but one or two hours above the hori zon. In wet weather it is usual to carry in the band, beneath the kangaroo skin a piece of smouldering wood, which compensates the bearer in some sort for the waat ofa flannel waistcoat, and en able* him to light a fire at a moment's notice. Each tribe possesses a territory of its own, and each family of the tribe has its own especial tract of land within llial ter ritory. Here a man can light his fire and build his hut without fear of molestation. It is, in fact, his paternal estate, so that the word " fire conveys to an Australian the same meaning of fatherland or lu'rth place as the word " hearth * conveys to a European, and is used by (lie aborigines in that sense. " I suppose Bliggin's shorthand writer lares him a great deal of time ? " " Yes. He doesn't have to look in the dictionary to see how words are spelled ■ow.1'
