The New Version of the New Testament. At last, after eleven years of unremitting labour by a company of the most learned men who could be found willing to devote themselves t ) so great a work, a revision of the Authorised Version of the New Testament has been come pleted and published from the University Press at Oxford It is part of the revision of the Holy Scriptures as a whole which may shortly be expected to be accomplished No greater literary work than this could have been under- taken none in which those who speak the English language could have been more deeply interested So thoroughly penetrated indeed has rnglishliteratuie been with the language of the authorised version of the Scriptures that it seems almost a desecration to touch what has so long been sanctioned For many generations have the words of these Scriptures become so familiar that a new version of the Bible would seem to convey to our sensibilities a shock almost as great as would be conveyed by the announcement of a new version of Milton or of Shakspeare Even its defects have become so associated with the whole body of English literature that any altera- tion seems to be a violation of historical sense must If the style so well as, if the translation fails even to express the most subtle shades of the original Greek Hebrew, bad it not yet acquired a kind of sanctity by association alone, independent altogether of its historical value ' Such feelings must survive for many years A new version of the Scriptures can scarcely be for those who speak the English language what the old has been As well might we expect to realise in bizarre revivals of Gothic architecture the mature dignity and mysterious beauty which still clings to the great fabrics of York, of Westminster, of Amiens, or of stone I For centuries these English Scriptures of the Old and New Testament have been like well use i weapons, cherished all the more for their imperfections But modern Scholarship in existing It is not now sufficient that learned men should be familiar with the dead languages from which these Scriptures are denied The Scriptures, na translated into the ' vulgar tongue,' must be vulgar no long r Play or not be as accurate translations as they well can be fashioned though they he on the old fashioned hues of the authorised version It is some five and twenty years since a strong movement in this direction had set in 1 mother to us as the translation of the Scriptures in which was dedicated to the " the most high and mighty J lines," who was King, not only of Great Britain, but of France and Ireland, it is, after all, only a modern version as compared with its antique originals Ike Scriptures no doubt had done their work in the far distant ages, remnants as they were of the primitive eras of faith They lived on through the dim learning of medieval history Almost altogether obscured for many toner itione, bow Burning and almost romantic is the story of their revival ! The new le arising came and with it came the discovery of these Scripture It was like the discovery of a hidden treasure of which all trace b and it had been lost Voteiing into the labours of raising, lyn lad made his translations of the ancient writings What a new light they threw upon life . Secretly in cil- rated they were read with it that, in spite of authoritative repressi m Defective is this to any nation was, it did its work It pi e) art of the way for more translations There were by bless great and little bibles for bishops and bibles for the people The King, a rebel to Pupil authority, while for bidding by public proclamation the public loading, graciously permitted the lieges to do so quietly, reverently, and secretly, for their instruction, at such times and places as might be convenient Thus it went on for some years, Coverdale s Bible being issued in 1598 For the next thirty years, during the reign of Edward VI, the reign of Mary, and the first twelve years of Elizabeth b reign, the Bishop a Bible and the G oneva Bible divided the popular r sympathies, the majority lining to the Geneva version Ibeu in 1571 Convocation made a decree that there should be a great bible in every bishop a palace, as well as in every cathedral and parish church Later on still, after James succeeded, Convention has declared that every churchwarden should supply his parish with a Great Bible -comprising volumes Shortly after came the present Authorised Version, which has kept its ground well, though a hill to authorise a revision who introduced into the Commons during the Long Parliament It did not pass, however, and now, after a lapse of 270 years, we have a portion of the revised edition, which in every respect is more complete and more accurate than any version which has preceded it The first meeting of the New Testament Company was held on the 22nd of June, 1870, at the Jerusalem Cha near, Westminster Abbey, under the presidency of Dr Ellicott, the Bishop of Gloucester and Bristol Shortly after, under sanction of Convocation the Westminster Company, under the presidency of the Bishop of Gloucester, through the intervention of Bishop Wilberforce, of Oxford, and Dean Stanley, placed themselves in communication with certain learned men in America, who formed themselves into two committees for the purpose of reviewing the work as it was revised in England This correspondence were commenced at the latter end of 1871, and was continued uninterruptedly till the close of the work. The differences between the companies, as organised in 1 unlaid and America, did not amount to many and these, at the request of the American revisers, are appended in the form of a list of readings and a design which was prepared by them As a sample of these may be quoted the three first -" 1 Strike out S (i c, Saint) from the title of the gospel and from the heading of the pages 2 Strike out the Apostle from the title of the Pauline Epistles, and of ' Paul the Apostle' from the title of the Epistle to the Hebrews 3 For ' Holy Ghost adopt uniformly the rendering ' Holy Spirit " The rules laid down as a guide to the revisers were as follows - 1 to introduce of few alterations na poral be in the text of the Authorised Version consistently with faith fulnera 2 In limit, as far as posed to the expression of such an orator i h to the language of the Authorised and earlier Tnglihli A curious J 1 toll company to go twice over the portion to be any se I of co i Provisionally the second time finally and on pi mell les 1 voting as hereinafter in provided 4 Di in the text to be idea ted so that for wl which the ex! lei co is decidedly pre| returning and that was on the text So I hope I differs from that from which the Authorised A orion was made the alteration be indicated in the lilarg ii 5 Po make or shun no change in the text on the serial d final revision by such Coin] any except two thirds of those present approve of the mine, but on the first revision to decide by sim} lo majorities 0 In every case of proposed alteration that may have given rise to discussion to defer the voting there upon till the next meeting whensoever the same shall be required by one third of those present at the meeting such men de 1 vote to be honour and iii the notice for the next meets g 7 To revise the head ings of chapters pages paragraphs, italics and punctuation. 8 to refer, on the part of each Company when on alder 1 desirable to divines scholars, and literary men, whether at home or abroad, for their opinions There were 407 meetings of the Westminster Company, the chairman attending 405, and the average attendance was IS out of a company of 24 The version is prof iced by a full statement from the revisers setting out the character of their work, the authority under which they acted together with other particular under the headings of Text, Translation, Languages, and Marginal Notes A work thus carried out by learned men, whose learning is universally allowed, is almost beyond criticism certainly beyond any criticism which can here be bestowed on it As a sample of re ulta, and of the version as we now find it, let us take the following - The two verses, the 7th and 8th of the first chapter of John, are omitted They have, it seems, been universally regarded as serious, and they now disappear altogether from the text The Lord's Prayer, as given in the 11th chapter of St Luke, now runs thus -" Father Hallowed be thy name Thy kingdom come Give us day by day our daily bread And for- give us our sins for we ourselves also forgive every one that is indebted to us And bring us not into temptation " And again in the other version of the same prayer, as given in the Sermon on the Mount, the concluding petition ruHR -" And bring us not into temptation, but deliver us from the Evil One " Speaking of this particular passage, and of the criticism which he seems to anticipate, Dr Ellicott Bays-" In all more difficult passages we have even given especial j heed to the great early versions and to the voice, wherever it could be heard in the same language as that which we were translating, of primitive | and patriotic antiquity In many of these passages it will be found that we are but reproducing that which had always been the interpreta- tion of the best and earliest writers of the Greek speaking Primitive Church We thus sought to tread the old paths as well as the new, and, while never neglecting modern scholarship, have never revered old interpretations without such a clear amount of internal 01 linguistic authority as rendered snell a u v rail a matter of district and indisputable! tiiitlifuliitea It need dead end job bind, perhaps, that so far as the Church of England is concerned the New Version of the New leatainentivill not at present take the place of the Authorised Version It is indeed only a part of the whole week now under revision When that is completed the whole willjiiodoubt, be brought under the proper authorities for consideration But the public itself must tosomeexteut be accustomed to the change before it can be usefully adopted Imbed it is by no means improbable that non conforming chunk bodies will be found more willing to adopt it than the Church of England herself Under any circumstances some years will probably elapse before this great work is accepted is the authoritative version for use in churches
