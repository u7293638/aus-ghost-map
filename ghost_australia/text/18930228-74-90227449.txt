LONGFORD. Messrs 1. Whitfeld and John Wright, J.'sP., attended at the police court this morning, when two codlin moth cases were disposed of. Mr Basil Archer pleaded guilty, and was fined 10s and costs. Mr W.V. Field, of Enfield, did not appear. The case was heard ex parte, proved, and a fine of Â£1 with costs, inflicted. A large quantity of wheat is still being carted into store and station here, and I hear of liberal purchases of the cereal having been made by a well known northern buyer of produce on behalf of a Hobart firm. In returning from a mountain trip in the Upper Liffey district last night a party driven by Mr Crack, in one of his convey ances, was treated to a ghost exhibition on one of the bridges crossing a creek. The horses espying the white object pulled up suddenly, and refused to proceed further, whereupon one of the party, armed with a big stick, volunteered to interview the stranger, and receiving no reply to his query deliberately knocked him (?) down. Falling heavily, without uttering a single groan, an inspection fol lowed, showing that the ghost was nothing more than a white post belonging to the bridge, suitably attired, and kept in posi tion by cords from either side. The obstruc tion having been removed the party pro ceeded on their way rejoicing. Feb. 27.
