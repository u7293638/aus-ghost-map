USES OF THE LORD'S DAY. To the Editor ofThe-ChtoreloofEnoland Messenger. SIR— Your correspondent, ' Layman,' as well as the author of the remarks on the use of the- Lord's Day for 'recreation,' which he finds so admirable, both seem strangely oblivious of one thing— that the weekly rest was ' made for man' before 'recreation' was neces sary, because before toil and waste existed. Both gentlemen, too, ignore the 'spirit of a man which is in him,' and which is the only part worth recreating, because the only part which is immortal. They both further ignore that ' there remaineth a rest (marg., ' keeping of Sabbath') for the people of God' after the toil and waste which now necessitate ' recreation' nave ceased to narass us. ' cayman, xoo, evidently forgets that the week-day rest was commanded before our first parents had any neighbours to love. I am afraid, sir, that too many of: us readers of the Bible, both lay and cleric, assume that 'the law of Moses' means the Decalogue — a mistake which Moses himself carefully guarded against (Deut. v. 22) — ' These words the Lord spake .... with a great voice, and lie added no more, and He wrote them on two tables of stone ;' and (Deut. iv. 13, U) — ' He wrote thovi upon two tables of stone. And the Lord commanded me at that time to teach you statutes and judgments,' of which St. Peter afterwards said, that they (the ' statutes and judgments') formed ' a yoke which neither his contemporaries nor their fathers were able to bear.' The 'highest good' for the beast of burden is ?to work for man ; the Sabbath is, then, most fit for the ' recreation' of the animal. But the ' highest good' for man is to be 'made like Jesus Christ ;' the day of Jesus Christ is, then, most fit for 'i his renewal by the Holy Ghost.'— Yours, ?? ,? , ; W.
