A CO xIsrzT. POLICY. So far, the Ministry has been able to hold consistently by the policy on which it originally assumed office, and it adheres to its determination to continue to do so. Rumours have been current of the intention of certain protected industries to give up the ghost in con. sequence of freetrade. But so far they keep healthily on. Mr. Goodlet an nounced his conversion to protection, stating that his cement works would have to be closed down in consequence of the removal of the duty. But now it transpires that he has secured a large Government contract for cement against all competitors, and will probably re convert to freetrade. The iron pipe industry was also to be smashed up, But instead of that, a large manufac" turing establishment in that line is being set up at Morpeth, which intends to flourish under freetrade. Yet again, one of the largest labour-employing enterprises in the world is erecting works at Balmain, in preference to any other part of Australia, averring that the fiscal policy of the colony suits them and all other large manufacturers better than that of any other colony of the group. Meanwhile, Sydney is growing in every direction, and the shipping and commerce of the part are developing to enormous proportions.
