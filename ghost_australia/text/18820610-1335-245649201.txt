LOCAL COURT—GAWLER. TUESDAY, JUNE 6. [Before Messrs. J. RndaU, S.M., and the Mayor of Gawler.] FOTHERINGOAM V. TAYLOR.—Mr. Lewis, for plaintiff, stated that the defendant had withdrawn the defence, and therefore judgment need only be signed. I QivroN v. DALY.—Action for £4. Mr. W. R. Lewis for the plaintiff; Mr. W. T. Foster for the defendant. This action arose out of plaintiff purchasing some fowls from the defendant in the Old Bushman YardB; and the plaintiff swore that the fowls were warranted to be sound and fit for eating. The fowls were taken from Mr. Burton's house to Kangaroo Flat, and while on the way there one died, and before the next morning two more had done the same thing, and by the end of the week the whole lot (10 in number) had given up the ghost. The mischief did not stop then, for no less than 45 of Mr. Burton's other fowls followed the bad example, before the disease was checked by a liberal treatment of nitre and sulphur, administered by Humphrey Boots, Mr. Burton's farm manager. For the defence it was denied mtst strongly that any guarantee was given that the fowls were sound, although at the same time there was nothing known to the defendant that they were not, and none of hiB other fowls had died since. Ultimately, after some very strong swearinc a verdict was given for lis. 8d., the amount plaintiff had paid.
