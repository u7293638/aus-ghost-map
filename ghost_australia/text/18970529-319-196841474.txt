NEW PUBLICATIONS. We have received from Geo. Robertson and Co. a large lithographic portrait of tho Queen in colors which will no doubt find appreciation as a cheap memento. The " Australasian Medical Gazette," published in Sydney, is to hand. There are several articles of interest to fchamsdical nrofession. From G. G. Ttirrl and Co., patent agents, wo have received tho "Inventors' Guide for 1897." A largo amount of valuable information is condensed in this little publication, and the instances cited in which invention has been rewarded should encourage everybody with the ghost of an idea to set about patenting it at once.
