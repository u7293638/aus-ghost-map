THE ML A.'s BY THE GHOST OP BURNS. Dear Punch its near han seven summers Sin' I was ane of the new comers, , Durin' that time I aft lia'e been Where different sorts o' fools were seen, (An'—that 'twas wrang I need na tell— I ha'e been ta'en for ane mysel) But ne'er before heard them debatin', Or try their skill at legislatin'; Now, I maun mak' a plain confession, I ha'e beheld them sit in Session, An| a. their gath'rin's drunk or sover— Their Spring-street meetin' triumphs over, For downright bosh naethin' surpasses Some o' these brayin' lang-ear'd asses. There's some wise men, I'm free to own But fools count maistly ten to one, Forbye wha gab, or gape, or snooze, There's nae a score mair i the house, Jist look down the lang cushion'd stools, Used in this " puradise o' fools," An' point me out a score wha'r fit For blaclrfellows to ha'e a seat. There's some wha'd mak a braw Premier, Mang nobblers, pipes, an' pots o' beer : In fact it's a well proven case They're maistly a' out o' their place— Au' mony a pot- house keeper says Isairly miss these M.L.A. V There's neither sprees nor fights gain on, Sin sic a ane's law-mak'in* gone ; I wish they'd soon let gang the House, " An' let's ance mair ha'e a carouse."
