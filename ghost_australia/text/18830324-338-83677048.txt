The Logan and Albert Jockey Club. ANNUAL MEETING. BY HERMIT. FIRST DAY. The fifth annual meeting of the above club took place at Beaudesert on Friday and Saturday last under most favorable auspices. The weather was all that could be desired, and the number of horses which had answered to the call of the L. and A.J.C. was far in excess of what are usually found at Queensland meetings. The attend ance was not up to that of last year; there was however a very fair roll rip of visitors, and all the available accommodation was utilised to its utmost capacity. The first day commenced with the Two-and-Three-Year-Old Sapling Stakes, and the scratching of Explorer and Sportsman left seven to face the starter's flag, and punctually to time they were dispatched on their journey. After Laura had made play to the half-mile post, Caducia took up the running and led her field at a good bat to the turn, where she collapsed and Nancy who was in excellent condition came on and won pretty comfortably though Peerless who was all behind at the commencement was drawing up to her a bit at the finish. Five went out for the Hurdle-Race for which Pastime was a strong favorite, though New Chum and Blazeaway each found supporters. However, as soon as New Chum came to grief there was evidently nothing in it but Pastime who was in splendid condition and galloped as strong as a lion all the way ; in fact I don't think I have ever seen him run a better race. Great interest was taken over the Beaudesert Plate, for which all the horses colored on the card with the exception of Nancy put in an appearance. Favoritism was pretty equally divided between Lady Vanda, Legacy, and Adamantea, Mussulman being held next in esteem, and nothing in the paddock presented such a thoroughly trained appearance as Mr. Patterson's chesnut. Response was well nigh neglected, neither did Gascon or Mozart go, down well with the public. Centurion was evidently a long way short of the mark, and Lord Nelson was altogether outclassed. Adamantea led her field along at a good pace for a mile, and at one time looked as if she would cut her field down, but before reaching the quarter-mile post her condition failed her and she col- lapsed, Response here put in her claim and won pretty comfortably at the finish. The winner is a daughter of Excelsior and was bred by Mr. Bundock, at Wyangerie, on the Richmond River. Directly the weights appeared for the Shorts' Handicap, Adamantea was spotted as the good thing in it, but the two top weights ran first and second, Young Australia winning rather easily. A Hack-Race which was won by Pilate then brought to a close the first day, of which I append the particulars. Two and THREE Year OLD SAPLING STAKES of 20 sovs., with a sweepstake of 1 sov. each from starters added ; second horse 5 sovs. from the prize ; weight for age ; ¾ mile. . Mr. J.

' ..-V' Laura jumped off with the lead with Cadueia next, at the back of athe course Caducia assumed command and forced the running to the quarter-mile, where Nancy drew to the front and won easily.

Pastime took the lead at starting but Briarroot soon supplanted him and led over the first jump which was safely got over by all. New Chum then rushed to the front and seeming to overpower his rider established a wide gap between himself a,nd the field, but at the next fence he ran round, and unshipped his rider. The other horses all fenced well and Briarroot still had the lead passing the stand, but it was only on sufferance and Moore then took Pastime to the front, a position he held with ease to the finish. Time, 4 min. 23.2 sees. BEATTDEQERT PLATE, 50 sovs., added to a sweep of 2 SOTS, each from starters; second horse sovs. from the prize: for all borses, to be handicapped. H mile. Mr. P. H. O.

They all got away to a good start, Adamantea at once being taken to the front, Legacy and Mussulman being the most prominent of the others. Adamantea main- tained her lead till coming near the quarter mile post, the others being well together with the exception of Lord Nelson who was hopelessly in the rear. Here Response shot out, from her field and turned into the straight with a lead of several lengths, and Lady Vanda made a des- perate effort to get up, but, though she gained ground, Response held her own to the finish winning by little more than a length. Time 2 min. 57 9/10 sec.

Adamantea went off with the lead but at the half mile Young Australia went up and took first place the others being close up. The brown horse, however, kept the lead to the finish and won with something in hand, by a couple of lengths. Time 1 min. 54½sec. SECOND DAY. Another fine day, and again towards eleven o'clock the stream of horsemen, vehicles, and foot passengers set in along the road to the racecourse. The attendance appeared slightly larger than on the previous day though there was not much difference in this respect. The Maiden Plate was looked on as a good thing for Peerless, but nothing had the ghost of a show with Sportsman who was for once in the humour. Mussulman won the Members' Plate easily enough, but unfortunately it was afterwards discovered that by some oversight he had carried 3 lb. short weight, and a protest being entered the stewards had no alternative but to disqualify him, and award Mr. Delpratt's handsome cup to Explorer. Young Australia was served up very warm for the All Aged Stakes, but Response just won by a neck after a very exciting race with Nancy. There was but little betting on the Logan Handicap, the condition of Lady Vanda being so much superior to that of her opponents that it looked like a certainty for her, and so if proved for she led from start to finish. Mailboy won the Settlers' race pretty easily, and Pilate won the Free Handicap after an interesting race with Nancy. After race occurred the only contretemps of the meeting, after passing the post Nancy seemed to stagger and falling down she died on tho spot, probably from some affection of the heart. This is hard lines on Mr. Jost, and he appears to have lost her just as she was showing improved from. The officials cannot be complimented too highly for the way in which all their arrangements were carried out and the go ahead manner in which they work to bring things to a successful issue is very pleasing. Mr. Brayford is evidently the right man in the right place, and L. & A. J.C. has before it, I am sure, a prosperous career. Below are the details. MAIDEN PLATE of 20 sovs,; for all norses which ha ve not won an advertised prize at time of entrance; winner of any prize after entry to carrj a penalty of 51b. j 1\ mile; weight for age. Mr. J. P.

Half a mile from home Centurion was beaten and Explorer taking his place went on in pursuit of Mussulman, who, however, held his own to the finish. Time, 3 min. 6 secs. Mussulman on coming in was found to have carried 3 lbs. short weight, so the Plate was awarded to Explorer. ALL AGED STAKES of 20 sovs, j for all horses j weight for age j 1 mile.
