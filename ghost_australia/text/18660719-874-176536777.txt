THE report Of the subjoined lecture has been forwarded to UA for publication, but we are not informed when it was delivered:— My text, sistern an bredren, aiut tu be found in yewer books dis ebenin, case I puposs no text but litenin yure ignerent minds upon opperer, an my subjic air an " Afrimn," dat is, a i-bred nigger. MYERBEER hevin bin utiforchunat in bisniss emmagrated South, an sot tip a, dried fruit store sum yeres ago in Louisiana. Thar he rut operrers, an did a mitey fine trade. He got lonesuin wun mornin, an tuktoo much water, wich hurt irn bad, an he let go de ghost on his own spousibility. Afore he wentefi, he mortalised de ebbeny race by ritin de operrer of " African," wich air now in fall go at de house ober de way; de best view for earing de mttsiek is to be sot in de gallery, case de high notes ob de singers reach di gallery fu3t. (Pass de jug; and now, my Christian bredren, do not misunderstan me.) " VASCO DI GAM A." am de " big purnkin," AN e war a sailor. His fader kep A ferry, and dar " VASCO" lern'd tu row. " INEZ" luvv'd de sailor, and cum nigh havin him—bat I procraetinait. Jest as " Don PEDRO," de rival (dey must hev 2 luvvers in opperar—d'ye hear dat, sistern?), is about to settle down with " INEZ" on a farm, " VASCO" shows up, and skates rite mong de crowd in de store war de kounsel sot. Two Injuns corned along o " VASCO"—one war " SELIKA," a queen at hum, but she hed bin unfovfcunat *, the tudder was " NELUSKO," a subjic fond o trabbeling. " SELTKA" war sweet ou " VASGO," with no streaky kin o love. (SAM, shake dat niggar dar—nebber seed a mouf like it—ef he snores agin, dis paper closes.) "VASCO" wants de kounsel to loan him a few ships—ao objectsliun tu a spare steemer. De chareman larffc rite out, BO " VASCO" hit him in de eye rite 'ont, for wich dey loekt " VASOO" up, down in de coal seller. (Dar's a pictur, my ard-itting bredren.) " NELUSKO" in the seller want? tu cut " VASCO'S" trote, jest fur to kill time. De gal objecs, and sneezed, ware by "VASCO" gits a kind o scared, an " Lusko" pollgised. By-an-by " VASGO" won a ship at a vaffel from New York, an gits away on de quite, an sails round fur to find de gold diggins which was brekkin out round India. Dat's de place war ellerpliants grow on trees. "DON. PEDEO" got a fare start in anoder paddle boat, but "VASCO'S" steme power lickt him holler, tharfor jest as " PEDRO 'rives out dar on de coast, dey pick up a ferry boat in wich " VASCO" is out arter oysters. Dey Injuns put off an rush de ship, scalp dey ole lot, bar " VASCO," who with de Injun gal settles down ou 40-acre lotments an du well. Dey pray all day outside, and dats no joke in a hot kountri. But de priests walk round de gal, an she sing3 out orful. Arter hewing "VASCO" made a maggistvate ail getting liim new close, she gits row in on Brahmins, an long a " VASCO" took tu singing outside de boss's house, and crowin like Shanghais. De boss was sufferin from eatin winter apples (dis took place in summer) an e couldn't stan dat. Kensquentli shee's ider got to clar out, or let go "VASCO" onto a ship, or loose her back air. Sistern, need I lucidate what she did? She guv him a bad dollar, a 50 cent note, a good square meal (dat's more dan dis crowd ebber let out for ine), put him up sum pau'loous, an sang him rite out o sight. My bredren, she den tuk tu drinkin, and liv'd on clams wich she stew'd under a tree at i tide. It war here she invented roller skates. She cuin htxtn won nite berry late, an wuss on dan ebber—couldn't stan nor niiffink; so she jsst lide down. She gets a kind o dry in de nite (drunlcers does), "an ate pumkin leaves all round. But her terrebel doom is ny. In a misjointed frensi she seezed a jug dar, Bwallerd water neat, an died in orful aggeny rite orf. Bredren, dar be 2 " SELIKAS troo, one dying ebbery nite, dey must hev 2. But dar be only one ESCOTT, and when de^get a better dis chile will be round. Also, too "VASCOS." Dar's powar in de young un, an arter hee's been tu skool he ought tu make money. Presently dis lecturer bleeves princply in. dey bird dats fledged, 'case a SQCIRES ain't foun growin wild. In coneloosau, wars de morral ? Listen, common peeploDon't go sailin roun tu much. Look out for spots nar 1mm—nebber Shanghai a Brahmin—stop crowin in de streetes. An, dear sistern, nebber take water neat—drink naia under trees, epeshally uiyerbeer, or huw-brew'd. . Dey sasser is gwine roun—let yure coin her no holes in. Dis cullectshun is fur de widdews and orfans of dey Injuns (after yure paster es got a new coat an boots, with a square meal tharfrom).
