The annual national fete in celebration of St Patricks Day was held yesterday in the Friendly Societies gardens under the auspices of the St Patrick s Society and the Hibernian Australasian Catholic Benefit Society Although not a general holiday the day devoted to the commemoration of the patron saint of Ireland was honoured by thousands hailing from the 1 emerald isle The proceedings were commenced at a coin paratively early hour by a procession consisting of members of the two societies marching through the principal streets of the city. The members of the St PUncles Society met at St Patrick's nail at a quarter last 10 and from thence proceeded to the vacant piece of ground in front of the Model Schools where they were joined by the members of the other society whose original rendezvous had been St Francis's Cathedral the two societies although differing in an important point in the constitution had coalesced for this special occasion. The H A C B Society as the name not tends makes religion a sine qua non and is confined to members of the Roman Catholic Church while the other and older society is national and is open to all Irishmen of whatever denomination for the present day horses or they co- operated and the members having formed in procession in front of the Model Schools marched along the chief streets accompanied by several bands and 5th banner s firing Ihepuncipai banner of catch society was borne in a lorry drawn by foul powerful horses whose heads were gaily decorated with ribbons The route selected was along Bourk e Elizabeth Collins and Spring streets and down the Richmond Road to the gardens The procession attracted considerable attention and was of course followed byciowdsof little boys who gazed with admiration on the spectacle and who would have accom pained the members even into the gardens had not the inexorable gatekeeper required the performance of on indispensable pie homely ceremony During the afternoon the attendance did not fall far short of 6,000 persons who notwithstanding the intense heat did not fail to enter heartily into the enjoyment of the day Dancing was carried on vigorously and persons of both sexes were to be seen enthusiastically performing Irish jigs until nature and the fiddlers were fain to cry Hold enough The hottest portions of the ground were in the shade under the booths which were so crowded by Um sty souls that even the outside heat was preferable The sports provided were of the usual kind and were up to the ordinary standard They afforded something for people to look at and enabled some of the professional runners to earn a little money The most amusing event was the walking the greasy pole on the lake Of course all the competitors tumbled in but a dip in snell weather was rather enjoyable than other wise The Cab Horse Road was the most exciting especially for the unfortunate animals engaged in it The following are are the w inner of the li mc main events -Maiden Race 200 yards 1 Lniight 1 A 1 elles 2 Sack Race C Ball P J Hegarty 2 Hurdle Race W F Pentecost 111 might 2 Greasy Pole hilson Cablloise Race Mickey 1 ice 1 Padd) 2 A protest was entered against the winning horse THE BALL AND SUPPER A ball and supper were given in the even sing in St Patrick's Hall Bourke street in celebration of the day There were about 300 persons present Dancing was commenced at 8 o'clock in the upper hall and lasted until half-past 10 when there was an interval for supper which was laid in the lower hall The room was tastefully deco rated fl EZZY Mr Hood the president of St Patrick's Society occupied the chair Sir Charles Gay an Duffy MLA Dr Macartney and Mr J Cm tam AILA were seated on his light and the non M O Grady MIA on 1 is left the usual loyal toasts were pre- posed, and also the toast of " His Excellency the Acting-Governor The PRESident proposed " The Parliament of Victoria " Mr. J Curtain, M.L A , responded, and said that the present Parliament would have deserved the veneration of future ages but for one mistake-that of discarding Sir Charles Gavan Duffy (Applause ) The PnEsroEKT proposed "Our Native Land." coupling with it also "The Day we Celebrate " The Hon M O'Grady, M L A , responded Sir ChARLES Gat am Durpr, in answer to repeated calls, also lose to reply, and was received with loud cheers He said Ladies and Gentlemen, I have travelled a long journey to day under a very ungenial sky, and I asked to be excused from speaking, but I confess when I heard the pleasant lush voices I could not resist It is forbidden to talk here on politics, but I venture to say that it is a pleasant memory to me that once a year, at this end of Bourke street, whatever mistakes they may make at the great House at the other and (applause), here I am quite certain of meeting friends who are not changed by any political circumstances, whose kindness " is still the same, whether we win or lose the game " (Hear, hear ). When I last met you here, 12 months ago, I was returning from a tour in which the chief districts in this country had given such enthusiastic support to the Administration with which I was connected as seemed to promise it a long life I meet you now, ladies and gentlemen, not merely fallen from power, but I am assured by certain well informed journals that I am actually politically dead and buried (Laughter and cheers.) I can only say that if I be so, you have given my ghost such a very pleasant reception (laughter), that I have determined once a year, on the 17th March, near the dead hour of midnight, to "appear" at St Patrick's Hall like Banquo in the middle of the festival I recently read a very strange story in one of the same well informed journals information that, in point of fact, I was shortly going home to be Minister for lie land (Laughter ) I may say, by the way, that that is a strange mission to give a dead man I am very sorry to inform youthatlhave not at present received any official intimation of the fact (Renewed laughter ) But I may say this, that if it be intended that the lush Minister shall be responsible to an Irish Parliament I will undertake the duty with great satisfaction (Applause ). The latest news is that, like a young lady who has become a bride, I have been changing my name , and as this news, unlike the rest, is not a fiction, I owe it to friends whom I see here to tell them something of that metamorphosis I ceased to be Chief Secretary in June last, and in October I received a letter from Lord Canterbury, informing me that the Secretary of State for the Colonies had instructed him to ascertain whether a companionship of the Order of St Michael and George would be acceptable to me? Let me say with respect to Lord Canterbury, that in all our political or social intercourse he treated me with a constant courtesy, frankness, and consideration, for which I must always remain his debtor But he had refused to dissolve Parliament when I considered I had a constitutional right to claim its dissolution, and as this distinction was offered me as soon as the papers connected with that transaction could have been had before the Secretary of State I concluded that it was possible, and even probable, that Lord Kimberley meant to intimate that he did not think I had received the support I was entitled to from the representative of the Crown on that occasion (Hear, hear ) Nevertheless, though that convention was very gratifying to me, I respectfully declined the proffered honour (A Voice "Quite right ') Shortly afterwards Lord Canterbury did me the favour to address another letter to me, asking whether I would accept a Knighthood' Upon that question there was the very strongest feeling among two sections of my friends My own country - men were of opinion that, having been four times a Cabinet Minister, and having been among the first men of my race and creed who had won that distinction in any British community since the Revolution, 1 was bound to accept this permanent testimony that I had performed the duties I undertook with integrity and discretion And some English and Scotch friends to whom I owed constant and ste idfast support in public life urged that if I declined it the very persons who were bursting with spilt and disappointment that the honour had been proffered to me would miss represent my refusal, and use it to provoke, and if possible to alienate, my English and Scottish friends I accepted, and I have since received letters of congratulation from every section of this community and I am not sure whether I felt more satisfaction at the congratulations of representative men among the Protestant democracy, who give me such generous support when I was last in office, of the congratulations of Irishmen who would have renounced and repudiated me if I had accepted any district don on the terms of forgetting my allegiance to my native country (Hear, hear) I may remind you that when the present Mr Justice 1 close s left yelled a vote of want of con- faience against the Government, I told him that I would not desert the fortunes of my native country for anything that Policemen of the Sovereign could bestow (Applause And now there has been enough of persona themes I will only add that though I was lecturing my health far away from the capital, and little disposed to quit the seaside till I Icltit m restored vigour, I could not resist the wishes of the committee of the St. Patrick Society that I should come here to-night They insisted that the exertion would done no injury and they were right for the breath of the ocean itself is not so refreshing to me as the dear familiar music of an Irish welcome (Loud applause ) Some other to ists were proposed Dancing was then recommenced, and continued until a late hour
