CONCLUSION OF THE CHAEGE OF A BISHOP IN ENGLAND. God give us all grace, whether clergy or laity, still more faithfully to labour ; still more earnestly to confess the faith of Christ crucified; still more solemnly to pray for the aid of ; the Holy Ghost, now it may be more mightily than ever, vouchsafed to each earnest worker in the Church of God. There is a spirit stirring in the church; there is every where among us a deepening sense of duty; there is in every true and brave heart a still more earnest desire to join in the ? holy warfare against the mustering powers of evil, of darkness, and of death. 0, let us obey these blessed callings ! It may be that the time is short, and that opportunities now mysteriously offered may never be offered again. The Eternal Spirit is now calling us to bear our part, it - may be, among lengthening shadows and closing dispensations. Wherefore, let us pray for grace to bear that part promptly and bravely, and having done all to stand. ? *m* In Western Africa there is a school for poor negro children. It is related of a little girl who attended that school that, . when one of her fellow-pupils had beaten her, she was asked, ' Did you beat her again V she answered, 'No, I left that to God!' Let us thank God for such fruit from missionary labours, and let us seek to multiply mission schools a thousand fold. Infants count by minutes; children by days; men by revolutions of ages; nations by revolutions of systems; the^ Eternal is in a perpetual present.
