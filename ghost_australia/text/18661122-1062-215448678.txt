For threo days wo sailed to tho north, and on our way. we met large quantities of ice; but it 'was of the kind that could do us no harm unless the woather changed to inlODse cold. We oaught aight of t.wo'borgs ; but they wore some (liatauce.away,.so tflat wo oould not' get much ofa viow of them,- and there was no possibility of their doing us damage. We arrived at the grounds the oaptain had olloBen, and whore wo had boon ritationod at - one time . during the summer, and' , for a week wo had goodjjick, capturing two 'largo/ 'sperm-whales ; and, as the wcolher continued pleasant', the mate, and thoso that had sided with him, forgot , all about tbei r dislike; of coming farther north, and' no ono wa tched the drifting ico that evory day came down in inoreasing quantities.

Tlio mate, lio dcolared, possessed too much, caution ; yet, before morn-, tng he had cause to Change his mind ; for the vessel was firmly -embedded in too frost arid ioo arid as immovable as' though she was sitting in her/ stocks.. /„:._r.:-_. ...

Still; the-mate, we knew, was of the opinion, or rather in'hopes, -thot the season was" too erirly- for it to remain Closed ;./and' here he. half agteed' with the Captain that it! would be .opori again, and give us a ohance. to pass throngh to .too south, - \- ; Three days went by, and the.cold.continued,. brit on the fourth it t became warmer, and then wo began to think of putting into execution a plan' that wo-hid been talking of since we had been caught in. the ice,-that of paying a Visit', (o a huge/'borg thaf-rippearod to bo some four miles away, 'on the outer edge of the ice ; tr at/least it seemed .ire if there .was an -open sea lyiog beyond; although', met could - hardly determine.
