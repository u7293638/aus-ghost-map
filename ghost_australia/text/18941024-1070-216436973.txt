CORDALBA. ifrou A COnBESPONIlBNT. Our littlo township is makiug a rapid movomcnt. That whioh was doneo sorub 3 months since is now tho' saono of aotivity. Tho Cordalba Hotol, being on the corner, was tho first to lead tho way and from their premises down towards tho school, clouting is going on apaao. Batcher, baker and blacksmith, havo built and others are clearing for improvements &o.;, with a viow of building in too near luturo. Tho mooting of the Planters Association re gumming in the oano ie of interest to all here and there is need for tho inspootor (Mr Tyrou) to visit tho Isis. os somo of tho oano is very badly affootod. Mr Walker's at Knookroo, I hoar is vory bad, so inuoh so that some of our other farmers are complaining at tboir cano and Mr Wolkor's being crushed at tho samo time, tho donsity is muoh less und thor havo to suffer as well. Messrs. Ponny and Com. will, no doubt, boo that this is altered without delay. 0 Wo have reoontly had two visits from th Railway District Engincor, Mr. Pagan' making inquiries as to tho requirements of the farraors Ac and as to how muoh trafflo thera will be for tho railway. It appears to havo go abroad that a few large estate .owners have beon trying to get the lino to stop about two miles from tho township. We are going to .havo a mooting to see about this gross in justice, Thero will bo tho biggest "go iu" that Cordalba bos over had if tho Jine doos not como right on hero. -If a fow thousand.pounds in tho tconof construction it is a ponny wiso and pound foolish polioy, If it is through tho in fluence of gontlomen holding largo ostates that tbo alteration is to bo madÂ© tho mombers i of tho Wide Bay and Burnott districts will bo ! expected to urgo clsowhero our claim to tho torminus hero. Undoubtedly a lino to Cor dalba will pay well. Thoro is tho Isis Central Mill Company certain to have a mill orootod and tho sito for tho Messrs. Young Bros.' mill , is likely to bo at this end. Many other reasons why it should oomo hero may bo cited, but oommon sonso must show that tho lino is in quired st this part in particular. ivuwbcuu iuui uaiu jubii jjuu weu uuuiwuuui rollers oomplotcd and will bo putiog on moro hands dotting tho weok.
