LYCEUM TlliOATKli. A well, attended house on Saturday evening witnessed the production of a uewspectral dramaof a highly exciting character, culled " The Haunted Life." The story originally appeared in Temple Kar, aiid created a great amount of interest, not only on account of the romaptic nature of the talc, the varied scenes in which its principal events arc laid, but also because it has connection with the ghost world, and in this respect lias a resemblance to the drama of " The Corsican Brothers." The groundwork of the tale, it appears, has beer, adapted to the stage by a well-known and talented local actor, Mr. II. K. Cox, and most of the dialogue, we are informed, has been supplied by him. That he has succeeded in producing a drama of thrilling interest cannot be doubted, if the ver dict of tlie audience be taken as any guide, and they are the best judges of what pleases them. The appearance of the ghosts at first, owing to some disarrangement of the apparatus, was hot so suc cessful as could be wished; but at the last, the airy visions were perfect. The scenery of the piece is new, and admirably painted by Mr. Varlej', and effectively gives in terest to the drama. Though the first representa tion, it went smoothly ; great care had evidently been bestowed upon it by the various members of the company who took part in its representation. All this tended to make the drama successful. The managers deserve the greatest praise for the excellent manner in which it has been put upon the stage; and they may confidently rely that for their spirited production they will meet a merited reward. The comic ballet of the "Dancing Scotchman," in which Fraulein Fannie and the Leopold Brothers appeared, was received with roars of laughter, and concluded the evening's entertainment. To-night, the "Haunted Life;" and the ballet' of "Amarosa'' will be per fcX-ned.
