The next provision be wished to leter.to was that pro viding for the abolition of appeals tromtpftl ConitB. He had already epojorai on this matter £nom an opposite point of view. He thought Oat there should J? greater libert* to B,ppeaL She fact that a. man oonld odt appeal beoaaee" Ins actaoh-'iras for ? trifle less Haa SSO was tie cause of the greatest complaint anion? suitors ?wifli rtpfad to tbe lUBqualitiy'of. )3ie js>v; ~ "3ji isases ntiAw £30 jtnagisizatea ooulddo astfiai liked on the faota, aid the moet absurd dedsiana—as tbeyoaeaaonalty did—beoraae they knew tost there wasno appeal, and yet if a oompBratn^y less important point of law 'were' involved there was an appeal. Members spoke "some tuneeasthough if there was* right of appeal it would be taken advantage of in every ease, bat if tiiey looked at the sta&tuxi; of die local Oourt they woold find how- few the appeals were in comparison to the number of caaesL * 'His experience led' him to believe that the fact that there was a right of appeal made the magistates more jameful, and -it was notapeable bow mneh more cateful they were in deciding eases where over £30 was invblved than where Aere was less.' It might be aaid by tiie Attorney-General that even where less Chan £30 was involved there was something like an appeal provided, hnmnfcg -the magis trate oonld state a special case;on ? punt of law, bat it was within the discretion of the' magistrate to' refuse it .Often also, eapeeianj' oatmde of Adelaide, where they did . grant it it -was only in sum words ae wonld nphald their decision and not to eetSs Ae disputed poirA. In his own experience he had ooine acrbei a magistzate who refused to grant a case, tecauso he said his decision might not be jnplield by the Supreme Oourt Bie only reaB|ln iar gnating such a obs was "?o obtain thex^union of the Supreme Ccrart, but in *^i?t case the magis trate evidently thought that it was more im portant that his decision' Bkoold be upheld than that .even jnstice'should be administered. If they provided that appeals should not be allowed unless £100 or upwards was involved, the injnstaoe' would be even greater, and fol lowing up bis idea that, the nght of appeal made the ?magistrates mate careful, ho would quote ifca following from a leading article in the South Eastern Star, which generally supported the Government :— "The Bill makes an alteration in Local Court procedure, which should be regarded with extreme caution. Clause 14 states:—*No appeal shall hereafter be allowed in any case for the recovery of debt or damages where the amount really in issue is less than £100, ex clusive of costs, unless such case involves some question of right other than the right to the debt or damages claimed.' Now this clause was probably introduced for' tho protection of poor men who might be suing debtors with means, in whose power it might be, by appealing, to heap up bests which the poorer claimant could not afford to pay. That phase of the question might be met by giving' the bench discretionary power, but to deny the right of appeal in eases -under £100 may be, and if earned no doubt will be, doinp serious injmtdoe to poor men. It oas occurred that & Ijocal Court bench during the heating of a SBse bag admitted.-evidenoe whioh had no bearing on the question at' issue, bat whioh influenced tie bench in its decision to the detriment of the poor man. B the light of appeal had been denied,-the loser of the action in this case would have suffered injustice. There is another point of view in winch the proposal to abolish this runt of appeal ought to be looked at It will make the special magistrates so secure in their positions that they may become careless, knowing that their decisions cannot be upset. These gentlemen may all be estimable, but all of them have not trained legal minds, and a dislike to being bored by a litigant who does not know how to conduct his case may cause a hasty decision qmte at variance with justice. Take away the right of appeal and the sufferer is at the mercy of perhaps a capricious S.M." Jf the Biu were carried in its present form it would embrace practically every Ijocal Court 'case, bo that there would be no appeal, how ever absurd the decision might, be. In Kngfand there was an aieolute nght of appeal in _every case wrwfdirig £80, and not the limited right, which we had in cases of under < £30, of the magistrate to grant a special case. ' The granting of special cases in Knpland was , much more extensive than here, because the ' judges in the County Courts were lawyers, i who appreciated the difficulties of a point of i law, while here there was a great deal of i difficulty in i?q.TH?y country magistrates i nnderjstand tho difficult points at issue, i In the city of Adelaide for this reason it was mneb easier to get a special case stated than in \- the country, which was not as it should be. i fie did not agree with Sir John Downer with > regard to the rule nisi because the present pro ; oedure seemed to him to be a waste of tune and money. Probably in the majority of cases I the judge who beard the case was not the one . who granted the rule nisi, and usually the . arguments which ?Hn?wi him to grant it were not considered at all. Obtaining a rule nisi ! sometimes meant eight or ten visits to judges' i chambers when the jndges were otherwise ? engaged, which had all to be paid for, and when i it was obtained the party was really no 1 better off. He thought that appeals should be i on mere notices, as was tbe case under the i Workmen's Idens Act, and this he considered was the best part of that-measure. Members had spoken as though the right of appeal was > altogether against the poor people, but be was ' sure if it was abolished there would be intense \- dissatisfaction amongst the poorer clamefl. : Under the Local Court Act in appealable cases : it was the duty of magistrates to take down evidence if requested, and counsel were com > pelled in cases of importance to ask the magis : trate to do so, but although that was the absolute duty of counsel, when they appeared ontsade of Adelaide if the request was made it i was very often regarded as an insult. The I mere fact of ??fci"g the request also raised a j > prejudice against the applicant's case in many instances. He knew one magistrate who i objected to take down evidence when re qnested, and when it was pointed out that the Act compelled him to do so he endeavored to persuadejcounsel not to insist upon it. Although magistrates often said they would take down i evidence when requested, it was frequently found after the case had been decided that they \- had taken down only one sentence and left out' 1 perhaps 50. That sort of thing constantly re i curred, and instances could be brought in which j people had lost cases on appeal merely because . the magistrate had not taken down the evidence ' as requested. He was glad to notice that in the : Privy Council lately that foolish notion had received a check, but he would like to see it i set out in the Bill that facts stated at the; : original trial and not recorded in the evidence' i could be brought forward in the Supreme \- Court. He was dissatisfied also with tbe i delays which took place, especially in the * Adelaide Local Court in connection with the ; issue of executions, and which greaily pre l judiced creditors. Tbey were kept three, > four, or five days, and the debtor in the mean time often heard of the execution, and took j steps which made it impossible to get his i goods. Such delay enabled the debtor to put r everyone at defiance. Creditora were pat to i great and unnecessary expense by the delays, which enabled the debtor to get nd of the > goods which might otherwise be seized. It ? should be a rale that everv execution , should be issued on the day it was ijLlodged. Otherwise they offend a jprs-. mmm for disbonMty* A tHH^ffflTTlftfi Ka3 told him 'that the Local, Court process owing to this difficulty and defects in regard to unsatisfied judgmente w&b; practically use* leas to email tradesmen. There me minor details in the Bill that he wooM not now fleal with then. He objected,strongljr to those daises which prevented coansdhorvaluators aopearing in actions against the! Government' Two classes of actions had been picked out in which the Government were certain to be one; of the parties. Under the Succession Duties' Act it was difficult to imagine a case in which the Government would not be one of the parties. Xt wawrffjffiraiife mic/\ fai fTnngnir a mnf* io Sooth Australia under the XAD&'Clapse? Oonsolidatioii <*t r id which the Government were not a,party. (The Attorney-Generai— "Yes.") Had there been one of the last fifty cases in which the Government bad not been a party ? As the Government owned the raiU ways it was practically certain that in all of die cases they would be a_party. In England there was a. Lands Clauses Consolidation Act which was practically similar, And there were at least, 1,000 cases brought into court under that Act for each case brought before the Adelaide Court. If there were anything improper .or unjust in allowing the plaintiff in each cases to have pro-' Sessional advice it would haws "been found oat in England, but there had not been the slightest suggestion there that ench eases should be treated different from tbe ordinary cases. They could imagine bow extremely preposterous it would appear in England if it were proposed that when a person brought an action against a railway company he should not be allowed to have counsel. It was really saying that the Government, who would be in the same position as the railway company, most win all of their oases. Was the poor and uneducated maa not to be Allowed arty-assis tance in his case? Suoh ajsuzgestion would not receive the slightest support in Eng land, and there was no reason why it should be adopted in South Australia. The idea was tbat as the Government represented all of the people no individual should complain of injustice at the hands of the State ; but that was a fallacy, because Hie owner of land which was taken by the Go vernment suffered just as much as he would if it were taken by a railway company. He dis agreed with the assertion that in these matters there was nothing to consider but the question of assessment. That was disproved by the great number of appeals which had been dealt with in Knyfand under the 'same sort jof Act and which involved questions of law. How was it possible for an nneducate d farmer whose land had been taken by the Government to place his case before the court properly ? The Government would have a man who was skilled and well up in the business, and toe farmer would be placed at a great disadvan tage. In instances such as the Happy Valley cases the owner of land taken might be a widow or children imder 21, and how would it be possible for her or thtrn to conduct her or their case ? From the point of view of the general public it was iniquitoudy unjust, and going back to the time when no one was allowed counsel. The clauses were the essence of the Bill, and they would do great injustice to every person whose land was taken under the compulsory powers of the Government. At present some members thought the Government ought not to pay costs when a decision went against them, but why should they not pay costs when the court held that the payment they offered was too small. The Government generally offered about half the value of property, and in many cases when people did not wish to sell, the fact of receiving a few hundred pounds was not full compensation to them. The Happy Valley people were driven out of the homes they lived in for 20 years. (The Attorney-General —"And were pretty well paid. 71) A good many of them did not get enough to compen sate them for their loss. When a person had a business in a settled place for 20 or 25 years and it was absolutely destroyed by the Govern ment taking the land, it was not full compen sation to give him a new bouse because the material part was the loss of the business. In these cases tho compensation should not be measured by the same fineness as was prac tised when' two . parties were treat ing fox ? sale,- la these cases. 10 per cent in additusi to the yalne TOraUtfawd. ? Ten per oenjb. was a small consolation to a-m&k; who was compelled'to take the value fixed by someone else. The nej* thing they would have would,be a proposal' by the Government jfio. abolish this compensation.

With the Gorernment ?s the defendant;'a plaintiff had to go through all aoite of perfor mances preparatory to the fiction coming off,: and this prastioauy'prevented *a'man from sueing the Government. A-petition of right had first to be presented, and this procedure 1 wasirksome and expensive, and in cases where men sued for small amounts it vrits practically prohibitory to any action being brooght against the Government. Tbey tried to pre vent people from doing whit was done in other countries, namely, to ,*llow any person who had a claim against any department "of the State to utilise the' Uocal or Supreme Court machinery togeta writ or a summons issued against thesecreitary of thatdeparbnent. That wonld do aw?y.<rith all the preliminary delay and incidental expense which i& the case of small claunaute pracocally prohibited them from going to court at all. The petition of right was a survival from the time when, the Go vernment never had occasion to be sued except for purposes strictly connected with the State; that was,-it was a survival of the time when there was no produce depot, and in fact no com mercial departments of the State. * These was some reason .for it in the old times,'because no ordinary subject would have an aofcion against tbe Government. No one would sue the Government for wages or for contract prices Bimply because the Government did not let any contracts. Now that the Government was one of the largest em ployers in a country like this there mustbe disputes between them and their contractors, but this provision practically prevented the latter from getting justice, and it furnished a powerful weapon to the Government officers to do-unfan- things. They could easily pass': a clause, if the majority of the Horn* were will ing, stating that in lied of tbe present pro cedure any action against, say, the Commis sioner of Public Works could be begun in the local Court by serving a snmmons on his sec retary, who would have instructions to know how to act. There were about \i other clauses upon which he was prepared to speak, but as these were matters of detaS, and did not involve questions of principle he would defer reference to them. Though the bulk of the clauses now u| the Bill were an improvement on last year's measure and were desirable yet he was finable to erase from his memory what took place last session when it was plainly evident that a majority of the members of the House, for reasons best known to themselves and unknown to anyone else, had decided to support tbe Bill and prevent any alteration being made in it. When, last year, two legal members of tbe Committe, Messrs. Homburg and Glynn, rose to point out the defects in the Bill there was a determination at once not to listen to them. Members ostentatiously yawned and made provision forgoingtosleep. Neitherof these two members received tbe slightest con sideration from the average member, and the average member absented himself and went into the corridor ready to vote for the Govern ment whenever they wanted him. He antici pated the same thing this year. Last session the clauses were run through, as " Hansard " would show. Though he admitted that there were 13 or 14 clauses that were good, there were others which were highly objectionable, and for this reason and the fact that the Bill tended to lessen the standard of the education of the profession, which was not too highly educated now, he opposed tbe second reading. I&r.; MOODY said it had been said that fools rushed in where angels feared to tread, and he felt it was rather presumptuous on his part to f oi low such an able and learned man as Sir. Ash on this subject. 1'or years be bad felt strongly on the question of law reform, and in 1879 3Ax.

Australia. A man who got through his examination in these branches could not be altogether incompetent. Sir John. Downer, in referring to theoretinal femining, stated:—"The Attbrney^tnaral' had fufther said that the result of the-present Eystem was to turn out men -who at the end of _ their articles tw .iftltogpth^**' iftaffi^?n^' Qutto^ recently he had read in a-book written by a celebrated man that " theories are the nnisance of soienoe; the rubbish which must be swept away that facts may be laid bare.1' The Attorney-General, in; delivering the policy of the Government in April last, said: —' "Now you can get through in three years if you attend the University 'and take a certain degree, obtain -certain certificates, and show ~your acquaintance with cBrtain dead lancuage& —Roman law—which when you know the best thing you can do is to forget (Laughter, and bear, bear.) There is no doubt about it that judges of the bench could not stand an exami nation in them. The whole result is that there. i is increased opportunity for admission to. the law^ivento those who attend these courses, itnfl imtoii mf mfrving naofnllyiw ?hoh- m.?t?^p offices, they waste their time m the acquisition of theoretical 'knowledge when the practical: knowledge they would gam in the office .would make infinitely better men of them—(hear, hear) —and make them much better qualified to follow their profession. (Hear, bear.) If three years is sufficient qualificsuon, than -1' say let them have three years only for actual service, and we hope to provide accordingly." He agreed with a very great deal of that, but thought a term of three years' service was little enough to enable a man to qualify for' the legal profession. Tbe public, however, did not bother about this point. Mr. Wood had said something about manufacturing lawyers, and he was surprised to bear that member say at the conclusion of his speech that bs would vote, for tbe second reading ot the Bill. (Mr. Wood—" Did you hear me say that?') The whole tenor of Mr. Wood's speech was against the Bill, and yet be had announced his intention of supporting it. (Mr. Wood—" I said I would go for tbe parts that were good," and the Attornsy-Geueral —"How could you .do that without voting for the second reading.") Coming to Part VL he approved of clause 13, but thought a new clause should follow it. At present the juris diction of the Local Court was limited to £500, and he would be inclined to extend that jurisdiction to £1,000. Section 16 be approved of, but in the following section the time allowed for application Bhould be extended. Clause 10 was somewhat ambiguous, and he would like to hear the Attorney-General explain its meaning. Sir John Downer in speaking upon this Bill had hardly done himself justice. That member had said :— " He quite understood there were two or three clauses thrown into this most mischievous Bill which might be fairly good : but he was not going to support tbe Bill to show his assent to those clauses when he dissented from tbe measure generally. If a member generally assented to the purport and object of a Bill, although be did not agree with every clause, he usually agreed to the second reading, but if he dissented from the general object of the Bill and thought it was pernicious, be should not support the second reading because one or He intended to oppose the Bill. TheBaftaS tbe practice and procedure-of tho Supreme Urartwasto be the same as that of theXocal Oourtjand everyone was captivated by the f* temailvTte Attomey^ieneral had said l?^ praCtl<S Ot *? Supreme Court was lengthy, costiy, cumbersome, wearvine. and tiresome in the extreme,' and that in order to do away with thn present svttem he wanted the prES^of "tfcTlJcat Courf but with one exception the practice of the two courts was substantially the same now. (The Attorney^General—'It does not pan out that way.) The Supreme Court Act was creatly indebted to tba administration by the pro fession, which had tried to help the Act The Local Court Act might have been made very much more technical had it-not been.lor the profession trying to assist it The Bill meant nothing. As a whole he was entirely opposed to the Bin. NotiiinKcouldbemoredanWous than to allow a Bill deajing with important general questions to go through eiinpiy be cause it contained clauses of undoubted merit to which they could not object" Sir John Downer ought not to take up -the stand he had taken l>nt ought rather to atusst with his legal knowledge in improving the Bill so that they might place a workable measure on the Statute-book. He believed clauses 26 and 27 would excite more discussion than any of the other provisions of the BilL Clause 27 was very harshly, worded. He failed to see why a layman who desired it should not have the power to engage a skilled lawyer to advo cate his cause before any oourt. As to As question of cheapening law surely ??wm?thi?ig could be done in the way of allowing coimtry courts to deal with insolvency business. These cases could very often be better settled by courts in the locality where the occurrence transpired than by a tribunal which was eitoaie some considerable distance away. ' Was there anything in the Bill to prevent solicitors from acting as auctioneers?

If there was, and be believed there was; aay standing gained by the appointment to a (J.C.-ship there should be a definite understanding as to the right of tbe Government to claim the services of a Q.C. when necessary.

Leaving this unsavory subject, he would refer to the support be bad received from the legal members of the House. It was just-about what he had expected to recejve. (Mr. Moody—"Hear, bear.") He listened with pleasure to the encouraging cheer of Mr. Moody, becau-% in connection with the law reforms effected in 1879-80 he was pleased to find that they received the support of such men aa Messrs. Moody ,and Landseer. He noticed also such names aa Lavington Glyde, Bright, and others, who did yeoman service. He was particularly interested to observe what was pie attitude of the .legal profession as regards one of tbe greatest' reforms of these tunes —the extension of the jurisdiction of the Local Courts from £100 to £490. Messrs. Giles and Moody suggested that it should be still further extended, and that was what be was attempting to do by introducing the Local Court practice into the Supreme Court, where it would be administered by the judges. He was sanguine that they would be able to carry that, but if they could not they would extend the Local .Court procedure as suggested.; This was a. snuch-vexed question at Hjestinie, and W was* amused to see tiow history repeated itself.

'That was bring ing' ' the judge into the - T^wTr Court. Had they . not . also secured .that all cases over £100 in the Adelaide Local Court should be taken by a judge sitting as i. Local Court, Both of tho3B measures were done while he was in office, and under the circumstances. ttXw Giles would not suggest that be had done nothing. They could not abolish the Supreme Court} but he wished to simplify and improve it They had taken the judges into tbe Local Court me much as could be fairly expected. If they took the practice and procedure of the Local Court into the Supreme Court and got the judges to administer it that was the next best thing to do. What reason could be urged (?gaisstit? There was? judge sitting in tbe Adelaide Local Court with jurisdiction np to £490. They were doing everything that could be wished. The Government were proposing a Very fair thing in d?nae 13. He was interested to obrcrve that in 1878 Parliament passed a Supreme Court Act, which was to simplify the law. It was thought so highly of that in 1880 reported and pointed to what they ventured to consider vn iVnififynt results accruing front the BilL They said it had simplified tbe Supreme Court and popularised it to. suoh an -extent that the fees had gone up and: the business had increased. A return signed by the Chief Justice,' Mr. Justice Gwyune. and Mr. Justice Boncaut, dated July 26,1880, wa?famished, and clause 5 said:— " The introduction of the new aj^tem has been accompanied with a striking increase in tbe businea of the court. During the first nine months after tbe "Act and tales came into operation {from April to December, 1879) more actions were commenced than for any 12 months daring the preceding ten years. During the half-year ending Jane 3D last 302 actions have been brought, being more than during the whole ol any year since 1865\. The judgments signed have in creased in amount from less than £20,000 in 1878, and a yearly average of a little less than £26,000 for the ten years ending 1878, to the rate for the last fifteen months of nearly £47,000 per annum. The monthly average of court fees for three years ending IS7S was £I£3 Os. lOd. F-ir the present year thts monthly averace i 3 £313 16s. Sd." On arguments such as that the judges founded contention, thftt. t^ft ?cooxb had |?ften popularised and was gladly availed of. He thought that a change had come over the figures, and he bad asked for information con cerning the years 1885-6, 1890-1, and 1895-15. In 1685-C there were 208 cases commenced, in IS9OI there were 11G, and in 1895-ti there were j only -S2. There had been a similar falling off i lof more than 100 per cent.' as regarded the amounts of judgments signed, the figures being; for ISBS-C £03,484; 1890-1, £16.641; and for 1595-6, £U,6OS, The average monthly court fees were:—lB3s-C, £81 ; IS4W-1, £7C; and 1895-C, £72. In 1893 he thought there was an increase in the court fees. That was the beat comparison he could make, and i a most startling decrease bad taken place in the business of the Supreme Court because the court was not so popular as it was. If members wished the public to avail them selves more of the services of the judges they would have to be taken -into the Local "Court or take the Local Court more into the Supreme Court. He believed that the clause would enable them to avail themselves of the Supreme Court procedure, and the beat judicial talent in deciding disputes in a manner that would not be effected by any other means. Talk about the simplicity of the Supreme Court procedure. He did sot know how many Acts and rales bad to be considered in connection with practice there. Let the Supreme Court have the benefit of the system that had worked so well in other directions so as to secure justice to all who really desired it and were entitled to it. He would intimate to the House what the attitude of the Government was in connection with the measure. They brought in lie Bill lan year and did all they could to carry it. It was forwarded to the Legislative Council at a late period of the session, and that was given as a reason for re jecting it. He did not know what was likely to be the late of the Bill in the Council, but it was admitted on all sides even by opponents that a great portion of it was desirable, and be was satis6ed that popular opinion required it to be passed. Possibly, looking at tbe advanced stage of the session, it would not be a bad plan after Retting it into committee to post pone further action in die matter andtake'it up next year at the stage, they left otf this Hession. Then the constituents would have a chance of pronounciuK a verdict on it at the next ejections, and die coarse he had intimated would probably be the one the House would be asked to adopt when the committee stags was reached. It was Dot the fault of the! Government that the measure had not passed earlier. Sir John Downer never indulged in anything in the shape of a stonewall, but there were others whose speeches in this connection could, be condensed. (Mr Burgoyne—" You might have'btought it in earlier.") They could not do two .things at once. This was one of the most important measures that had ever been. introduced, and he would be pleased to ''see it 'become law. He did not care from which side of the House hegot hints to improve the Bill,he would only tod gladly "accept'them, and he welcomed .suggestions .to improve tiie measure rromevery body. A lot of fudge had been talked about legal education, university training, too. It wa?. suggested that this, that, and the other thing should be learnt before a man was com petent to -draw up a conveyance, institute a Local Court action, give advice in a divorce action, or an action for assault. Fudge and nonsense! It bad -been said that if con veyancing were handed over to those who bad not gone through a certain training dire results would follow. Similar statements were mode when the Seal Property Act was passed. The lawyers-cet their faces against that, but it passed, and the result was that land brokers were licensed to cany out the ? provisions of the Btasri*eV>and they were doing it very well. No doubt there were some members of the profession who could do it a. ereat deal better and charge accordingly.' They could not eifleo* the members of a xoonopolv to throw open theirdoore to farther competition, for that would only induce cheapness for the benefit of toe public. The cry "Our craft is in'ttanger^ -was raised Hby the members of the roopoooly, whereupon the mononoliste looked to their interests.'- It was only human nature that trey should. Something had been said about free-trade in law. In a multitude of ad visers there was wisdom, and from the many ?begestions made to them they had to select one as regards the term which can 4idatis'sKoold'aervp prior to admission as '?plicitota.

Tbe main effect of them is to confine the plums to a few people who were fortunate enough to get a good education in tbeir youth, and to those who can afford to pay heavy premiums for their articles. Sweep away both and the result will astonish tbe legal profession in more Ways than one, and will certainly result in something like decency in the amounts of bills of costs." Did toon, members really believe that fiVe years' training at the university was necessary to qualify good men to advise on matters of dai{y occurrence ? Certainly not. Tlie result now wae that the profession was limited, the difficulties and expense which surrounded it closed its portals to many young men, talent was not encouraged aa it ought to be, indeed talent without capital or influence was shut out (Mr.-Wood —"Why have any examination?") Ab regarded examination that was of little assistance.' - -But the Government' did not -wah£ to do things too rashly. What they had said; was ?* You must pass an' examination on these "subjects, and you must pass it so as to show that you are posasjsed of knowledge reasonably sufficient to enable you to satis factorily discharge the ordinary duties of a solicitor." Something had been said about hfe having inaccurately referred to the exist ing provisions on the subject of legal educa tion. He had not done anything of the sort, and since then he bad fortified his mind an the .subject fay reference to the University calendar. He found it was there laid down that ?s regards the future every person must before entering- into articles produce to the board a certificate of bis having passed the matriculation examination in the Adelaide University, or some university recognised by the local institution. There wa? a further provision that persons who had been articled to some practitioner for the foil term of five years could be admitted to the profession. It was further provided that in the case of any person who during the period of his articles Lad tiken the degreeof ?5. A. a service of three years would be sufficient. So that under the present system a man who instead of serving his articles, as Sir John Downer had served them by following hi* master into the courts, receiving instruction from him, seeing how things were done and tbe way to do them, thus qualifying himself to manage a business, spent a considerable portion of his time in listening to lecturers who might have little standing in the profession, and whose adyics compared with tiio advice of his master uiigbt be altogether worthless, could enter the pro fession in three years, whilst the clerk who had worked hard from day to day in his employer's office could not be I admitted till he bad served five years. They talked about this matriculation examination. la that examination a candidate had to pass in three tmbjecte, one of which j must be English history and literature. The {candidate could take his choice of Latin, Greek, French, German,1 or Italian for another enbject, and ho couM choose either pure mathematics, geometry, experimental physics, botany, physiology, or geology for a third subject. It was compulsory that the candi date should pass in English.history, and here was one of the questions he had to answer. The fact of being able to answer such a question would till any lawyer with con-1 ndence when he rose to address a jury, j The question was:—"Write notes on tiie i Addled Parliament, Barebone's Parliament, the instrument of Government, the petition and advice." It struck him that one of the' chief objects of a thing of that sort was to enable a lawyer after be had got a seat in Par-; liament to come down and worry the Govern- j ment of the day by talking abr>ut the " Mad I Parliament," as air. Ash had done. Here was another question:—" Write notes on the wards in italics —talini night; lead our first battle; the intrenchant air; the air is delicate; the guilt of our great quclL" What was the seeling night? (Mr. Ash —" Have you never read Shakes peare?') He had read sufficient not to know that. Another question was:—''Give an aocount of the scene in which Macbeth sees the ghost of Banquo." Fancy a lawyer raising a point of law in the Local Court and being inhrrupted by Mr. Bussell, who asks for an authority on the subject Let anyone imagine the reply of the advocate, "I have no authority at hand, but I can (rive you an account of the scene in which Macbeth sees the ghost of Banquo." Then there was Latin which he would skip aver, ditto with French and German, likewise pure mathematics, experimental phy bics, botany, physiology, and geology. Some of the questions on Koman law, which were put to the candidates at the examination in 1893, were as follows: — "Sketch concisely the development of Roman law from the earliest times to the beginning of Justinian's reign. Explain the following ex pressions :—Ager vectiyalit, aelio Butdiana, tutor Jiduciariut, adquisitionez dominii natw ralis, litis contcstatio, cretio vulgaris, servitut altiut tollaidi." fie passed such questions, and so did . Sir John Downer, Mr. Ash, and every judge on the bench pass such useless knowledge. He appealed to the House to carry the Bill, and thus prevent the permanent requirement of knowledge of this description by persons who were desirous of entering an honorable pro fession, and to whom such knowledge was altogether useless and undesirable. The motion for the second reading of the Bill was declared carried, and Sir JOHN DOWNER called for a division, which re sulted as follows:— Arcs, 32—Messrs. Archibald, Batehelor, Blacker, Brooker, Borgoyne, Butler.- Car penter, Castine, Catt, Coneybeer, Cnmmins, Foster, Giles. Goode, Holder, Hooper, Jenkins, Landseer, McDonald, McGillivray, McPherson, Miller; Moody, Morris, O'Lough lin, O'Malley, Poynton, Price, Randell, Shannon, Wood, and Kingston (teller). Noes, 9 —Messrs. Ash, Copley, Duncan, Gilbert, Griffiths, Hague, Harrold, and Mort lock, and Sir John Downer tteller). A majority of 23 for the Ayes. Paibs — Ayes, Messrs. Cockbarn and Grainger; Koes, Messrs. Handyside aud Solomon. On the motion—"That the Speaker do now leave the chair, and the House resolve itself into a committee of the whole for the purpose of considering the BUL " Sir JOHN DOWNER said he did not in tend to make a long speech because he under stood that what the Attorney- General de sired was merely an affirmation of the principles of the Bill at the present time, and that he did not intend for a moment to carry out its de tails Just now. He agreed that the longer the matter was kept before the public the better they would understand that in the legal profession it was . well to have only men who thoroughly understood wirat they were doing. At a. previous etage he had endeavored to call the attention of tne House to the experience of centuries and the ex perience of the world as against our narrow 50 yens of experience, and he had pointed out that all the high authorities on the subject thought it necessary" to lay down a solid foundation in regard to the legal profession so that it might produce something more than mete casuist rhetoricians -who conld defeat a case here or -even a cose there. It was thought that this profession, which by natanal selection brought into jt the brightest geninses of the world, should te surrounded from the very, fact of its Attractiveness by pre cautions which would make those who followed it not clever men bat cautious, thoughtful men,. who might shed upon .the world a brighter light, aid that they might bring out'of the intellects that it attracted and the education which it required men who might not merely assist their fellows in the narrow limits in which they happened to be living, but might produce jurists whom the world might follow. It was from that point of view, speaking as thoughtfully as be could, and call ing attention to oil the mischief in the past from the insufficient education of the profes sion in England, and calling attention to the undoubted and admitted fact that we had pro duced same eminent rhetoricians but few jurists, he urged that they should make the profflEsion _be|ter, even than the Attorney-. General pr he had known itso that byrdegreee soot only would the beat intellects be attracted, but under cmnmstahces'wnioh.wauld be most beneficial to tne general public. As far as the mode, of . procedure was con cerned, - members had a aubject about which they knew .nothing, and they had also an address from the Attorney- General about tie simplicity of the -Local Court pro cedure, about which they also knew nothing, and then they bad the Attorney-General talking.of the difficulties of the Supreme Court, shoot which tbey again new nothing. He admitted that as far as the Supreme Court procedure was concerned it might be better administered, because it was intended to be as simple as that of the Local Court, with sucb qualifications as the necessarily more in tricate nature of the larger'interests involved required. If it had not proved, so the reproach must be on-tbose who had had the administeringx>f it As far as the Local Court procedure was concerned it was intended to be simple, and it had remained no, but he held that this was largely due to the action of the profession, which the Attorney-General so persistently decried. It was not true that the profession in any way wished to stand by their ofrn colors simply for tile purpose of injuring the public.' He had no doubt that the profes sion attributed importance to matters which the general public-'did not, and tbev insisted upon matters of particularity which might seem to the general public immaterial, but which CO the parties interested were most material. It was on these matters that some members were making statement founded not on/fact but on general prejudice. It was from this point of view that he spoke on the ques tion, which ?would-not afject him personally, but which' woulrf afiect the colony greatly, bbc&iise; according to the'BiH they must come to the conclusion that education was unneces sary and that the only principle in business was to leave people to do the .best they could, and that the beat protection that the public could have was the individual intelligence of each. If there was a line of argument which 'was more distinctly opposed to the policy of the country an represented by the Government it was this. What >iid it come to? The examinations were a sop' to Cerberus, because they were practically of no importance. They should not make thvir own inmrEcieat educa tion and their own indifierent success a, guide to the greater education or the greater success they hoped to see in the future. They were not without experience, because they knew that for centuries the English bar had no education at all, while they knew that die Continental bar always had; that whereas one had practically to go through formalities in order to be admitted, and the others had to endure culture before their claims for admission were recognised, and although they admitted that England had produced great lawyers and once in a way great jurists—they could count on their fingers' end the men who had left an indelible mark on time—on the other hand they bad the Con tinental jurists who always made law a higher study. Were they always going to educate everything down because the Attorney-General and himself had managed without that culture to achieve a certain success? Were they always going to say that it was not advisable that anyono should be educated'to do better? Were they to have free-trade in. intellect, in. business, and everything else ? Were they to license men to kill the body, destroy the soul, 'and injure property ? At 6.30 p.m. the sitting was suspended for an hour. ' (Continved on pane C.)
