Ibumor. The Boarding-House Joint. Each weary guest is worn to a ghost; Oh, list to oar tale of woe 1 How we long for a rest from oar landlady 'a roast, Bat bow she makes it go. Oh, sing me a hymn of the luscious ham, That never oar table sees I But only the limb of the ancient lamb Whose sequences are these: One day hot, and the next day cold, And the third day " stew" is its name; And the foarth day haeb, but the estne old joint It gets there, just the same. The markets groan with the fatted grouse The stalls overflow with fowl; I sometimes moan for a Gbinese mouse, Or a slice of toasted owl. Bat ever the shape of the aged sheep On the table Heb alone, And like faneral crape despair doth orrcp As the same old rule gobs on: One day hot, and the nest day cold, And the third to " stew'' we stoop : And the foarth day hash, acd the fifth sad day The bone is in the soap. If only the lamb were bred for lhe loom, And bis flesh was for food too coarse, I'd care not a darn for the lambkin's deem. No more than the horse-car horse. If the tariff tax would complete its tricks, And the price to heaven should soar, Such a state of facts would our landlacy fix, And we never would grumble more: One day hot, and the next day cold, And the third day greasily i-tewed; And the fourth day hashâ€”Will it ever reach Innocuous desuetude?
