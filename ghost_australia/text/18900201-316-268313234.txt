On the /occasion' of- this visit, and just as he. was . leaving, after having partaken of the usual hospitalities of the place, he espied in a corner of the farmyard an old' iron pot, nearly -spherical in shape?, which had formerly stood oh three legs, but could now only boast of two. Owing to its unsafe condition. it "had long since heetirdisusedj andhad;bee'nfCOnsiOTeutoits resting-place on the principle that for all the His of life-prevention is better than ciire.- A, somewhat'minute ...inspection of its'.ex-- terior revealed the figure, 16, • followed. by something which could not readily be deciphered ; . and*',instdad. bf concluding that ; these marks probabiy represented nothing more than the size of the article 'in- question^^ the : greit antiqu^yVrashly-cbacluded that the 16; with- the. ohliterafed marks rexiresehted'i'nothing short of tho date 01 its •manufacture..'- A pot whose early existence was probably contemporary with Cromwell could not be. permitted to remain in such a place.

';His/.path -lay along the bank, of saj small river, and : sb down to the mill. Here, it may be mentioned in parenthesis, lived an old sweetheart, who, out of patience, 1 suppose, in waiting ;for 'the-question'febm my .uncle, had accepted his. -rival, . the miller, fullytwenty years before. , Across the stream a dam;had been constructed for the purpose of diverting the water to the mill; ana. thus a pond was formed at least five "feet"deep. The -water of ten/flowed over the dam, forming.a beautiful .cascade^'-from'.Bis to eight feet in height;,; and when. the", water was low, people. frequently passed over the" wooden platform of the aain !.o save the walk to lie,bridge,"wliich -stood more than a hundred 1 - yards; below the ' mill. But, doubtless, my uncle had;aapther, reason.for selecting this route, a reason which received additional force from the strange appearance which he now presented. :'.•'• . .,.- As may be; readily, supposed, the action bf the water had rendered the platform very smooth and slippery. 1 Along this dangerous' path, however, my uucle proceeded, but whether from- the effect of the -aforesaid ispitalities, or from the weight of the pot 1 his head, he became unsteady in his gait, and suddenly slipped. A fall of 'eight feet to the bed of -the'river was hb jbke; besides, such^^^af all.could only^^ end iii tlie .destruction; of the. pot.!
