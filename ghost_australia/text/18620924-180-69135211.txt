dToit^sgoiutynift. Asa general rale, we wish it to be understood that we do not identify ourselves with the opinions or expression* of oar correspondents. To the Editor of the Inquirer and Commercial News. Sir, â€” Did it never occur to the Solon who wrote to jour contemporary, under the signature of Jacob Omnium, that there was such an adage as ' Penny wise and Found foolish.' and that one may expend profusely in some instances, parsimoniously in others, and indiscreetly in all? The stoppage of public works is too plain a proof that our late Governor was guilty of the first error. I cannot say from personal knowledge whether he committed the second error in tbe case of the Colonial Exhibition, but I know there was great grumbling at tbe time, because the funds were limited and to the present day it is asserted that the means of the committee were insufficient. Itbink the time bas almost arrived for us to hear tbe last of that very worthless person, Mr. Kennedy. God knows we had enough of him while with us, and I am not singular in saying I am heartily sick of his name ; I wish to forget him in peace and quietness. Let the man do mischief where ever he may be placed it is nothing to us. We can bless our stars at our riddance and there is no occasion to raise his ghost to worry as any more. B.
