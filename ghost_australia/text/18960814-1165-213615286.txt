JCow Martel the captain, Ferrand the engineer, bluff old Joyeuse the mate, the marquis, and many • others, hovered around us, all with distorted faces and despairing, gestures, -their Manes still unappeased.

A remarkable man has just died in the person of Abdul Huh, otherwise Sirdar Diler Tung, of Hyderabad fame. Of fine presence, much plausibility, and a masteiof idiomatic English, he had. some extraordinary adventures. Perhaps his most noteworthy achievement was to obtain from tbe Nizam's Government an enormous sum-of money as commission for promoting the Hyderabad Railway. This transaction formed the subject of a Parliamentary inquiry, and as a result of the invest'.gations he-was compelled to disgorge a • considerable part of his gains. But. he still remained a 'wealthy man, and cut no inconsiderable figure in Bombay, where he owned a large amount of house property. He claimed that he was a great friend of Sir Barile Frere.
