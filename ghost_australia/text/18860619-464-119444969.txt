At last something is to be done to make the approaches to the Spit at Middle Harbour less dangerous, and to improve the means of transit across the channel there — works much needed and long required. The unemployed are at work on this side of the Spit cutting a road round towards Shell Cove, where the gradient will be much less than that of the old road, which stands in some places at an angle of 45 degress. The ricketty and dangerous old punt now in the ferry is to be replaced by something ess barbarous. The ferryman, who works the punt with a wheel, recalls the picture of Charon ferry- ing the ghosts across the Stygian lake in his barge worked with a pole. Passengers and vehicles have not to wait 100 years on either side of the Spit before being ferried across, as the ghosts do on the banks of Cocytus, but the Middle Harbour ferrymen keep people waiting often too long for their comfort, especially if the wind is blowing off Ehrenbreitstein and the thermometer at 46 deg. He charges, too, a high fare for the accommodation he affords — 2s for a carriage, and 6d for a horse. Two of the ministers, Messrs. Lyne and Garvan, it is said, are favourable to make this a free ferry, but doubtless that will be opposed by the representatives of another suburb, who have had half a dozen bridges built at the public expense for the convenience of their con- stituents, all of which are now free to them. Let us hope the base envy of Balmain will no pre- vail on this occasion.
