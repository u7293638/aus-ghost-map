The fear lent wings to his feet, and be was sooa fiying dovni the deserted, street, as. fleetly and silently as a shadow pursued by the wind. Bareheaded and barefooted, with only his shirt anjd. pantaloons pn, he darted away through the darkness and pouring rain, scarcely knowing which way he went, only that it was away from the gaol. How good it seemed ! New life and new vigor came from every -Sying step. He was free, the sainfe? be praised- — he was free, and he grew joyously prodigal of his .stre,ngth, throwing aside th§ wind and Tain, defying them; to beat Itim. in this race.

His long practice and unerring instinct quickly told him how it was. He had been, running due east, and now with quick pre cision he turned direct south, no longer running, but walking with the rapid, springy tread of former years. On. he walked, hour after hour, the rain poariiag steadily all the ti^ne. At last a dim, gray'light- began spreading itself along the eastern horizon, and he looked anxiously to ' see where he was. In the darkness he had passed through Haddam and Ohester, and now he was close on the bprders of old .Say brook. -...-.? . ? JSfqt a moment was to be lost now. It Would never do to be seen 'on the road in this, plight, for even strangers would arrest such a looking object as he was ; a^d beside, his escape, if not already known, would be very soon, and men would, be scouring -the lots and woods long before noon. He knew there was, a boat waiting for him oS the beach, aad would wait there till a little past sunrise, and)' praising the 'saints that the morning promised to be dark and stormy,' and- consequently there would be few persons out early, he struck into an un fr©q«ented paihj a«d now; though he began to fee! tired and lame, started into a swift run fojr liberty and life. .Chapter XXVI.— Some Ose Sees the ?

Flying like a spectre along the wooded road, -a-'ssiall, sligjit man, without hat or shoes, his drenehed- shirt- clinging to his body, show ing- the sharp shoulder-blades and ribs, that stood out as if he was a living skeleton. The bare, torn feet were bleeding, at every step, the black matted curls closely hugged his bare headJ: and the pale, sallow face, where, the cheek bones stood out, and the hollow, lurid eyes sunk in, Wa.s a frightful thing to see, for bicod was gushing, out of biS|BOstrUs and eais as he Tan,, dripping on. his. beard and sliirl, till he seemed like the ghost of a murdered man .rising from his grave.

He tottered and swayed from side to side, but stiU strove to ran, seeing, with despairing eyes, ho w~ fast the sun was coming to the horizon now. Would not God hold it back for a few precious mofmeBts ? . The sun 'was already up as he came abreast Poker Rock.
