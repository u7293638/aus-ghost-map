DRAMATIC ENTERTAINMENT. -The Balmain Working Mon's Amatanr Dramatic Club garo a benefit to Mr. Edward Kelly in the Odd-fallows' Hall, Balmain, on Inst Tuesday evening. Mr. Kelly is a young man who was employed by Mort's Dry Dock Company. Whilst nt work, some two mo*nths bnok, lie received a sevoro accident by getting his right nrm drawn in some of the machinory, tho result of which was that ho was ncc«s- j sitatcd to havo his arm amputated between the shoulder nnd tho elbow. Of course, lie was unable to return to his work, and hoing married ho waa placed in rather awkwnrd circumstances ; and from these facts this entertainment was given. Tho pieces represented wero "The Spectre Bridegroom" and (by particular request) " Tho Unfinished Gentleman ;" nnd during tho intermission several dances nnd songs were given, including a sailor's hornpipe by Miss M'Koown, from tho Princo of Wales Opera House. Tho pieces were. noted in a very creditable mannor by the gontletr.cn amateurs, assisted by Miss Norton and Miss Holloway, who frequently had tho hons» in roars of laughter at tho sudden appearance of the supposed ghost, nnd various other lively parts. Tho whole of tho songs and dances were also performed well-so much BO that in each case there was an encore demanded. There waa a large number of persons present ; and, judging from f tho frequent applause bestowed on the performers, it was evident that tho efforts of tho club in a good cause were fully appreciated.
