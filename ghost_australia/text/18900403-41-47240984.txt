THE ONKAPARINGA STEEPLECHASE. TO THE EDITOR. Sir— Are we breeding mules or horses? Two letters in your paper of to-day complain as to the height of the fences in the Onka parioga Steeplechase— 4 ft. 2 in. Had the writers the ghost of an idea of Bteeple couraea whence we derive our stock they would find that 4 ft. 6 in. is the average height, without taking into consideration walla, dykes, &c.; We want hunters, not sheep-hurdlers. I am, Sir, &o.;, WILLIAM A. S. BLUE. Strathalbyn, April 1.
