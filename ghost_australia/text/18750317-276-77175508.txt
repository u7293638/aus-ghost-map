THE GHOST. The moon shone on the deep, And the landsmen were asleep, And night and morning met (For the midnight star had set), When by Portland's signal post Stood a sailor's mournful ghost. On the wire its hand it laid, And to the restless sea it said - Had this noble bay been crowned On the night that I was drowned With a breakwater to save Seamen from the heaving wave l had not been a ghost, Glbbering at this signal post; Hurried off In life's best bloom To a cold and watery tomb, With my dear children hurled On a cold and wartery world. And the blame Is great and sore, And it nestles at the door Of those who fraud devised And the breakwater excised, Double dealing Spensley you, And slippery Butters promised true To leave no stone unturned Until the work began; But when you were ''returned" You sent a heartless man To survey the coast around And swear that stone could not be found Where nought but stone uprears, And ledge on ledge uprears. But soon in spite of you And Kerferd and his orew This breakwater will rise A sweet sight for wondering eyes; And future ages will despise When they see Its structures rise The mean, time-serving throng Who delayed the work so long."
