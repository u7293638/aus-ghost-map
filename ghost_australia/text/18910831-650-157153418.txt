Dr. Camidge at Cowra. Speaking at a social reunion in Cowra a few evenings ago, in connection with an inducting ceremony, Dr. Camidgo, the Anglican Bishop of Bathurst, asked those present to remember that they were members of the parish, and had certain duties to porform. He next referred to the ancient institution of parishes, and related at length the argu ments used by him in opposition to those advanced by a clergyman who advocated tho abolition of the parochial system. He asked them not to look upon tho parish as a skeleton, but as something substantial, something real, a living thing, something to delight in. He urged them to guard against dis union, and advised them to sink their minor differences and work harmoniously for the common good of all. He had a great deal of enthusiasm in his disposi tion, and always desired to see a thing that required doing well, done well. He strongly deprecated indifference,' and earnestly invoked them to bo enthusias tic in parochial work, and thereby make tho parish of Cowra a thriving one. There was no such thing as standing still, because if they were not progressing they must bo going backward. The Bishop concluded with an eloquent appeal to the parishioners to support their pastor, and thus testify they were gaining in grace, in a knowledge of Jesus Christ, in fellowship with tho Holy Ghost, and in promoting the honor and glory of God.
