Armor in War, In ' Temple Bar ' for August there is a short and interesting account of ?what was probably -the last appear ance in the field of men in annori This was in January, 1799, at the town of Aquila, in the Abruzzo, then held by a garrison of 400 French troops. The peasants broke into the town, and though they were driven out by the French they continued to give serious trouble. They even drove the French into the fort and made ready to bombard them with heavy guns. The French were in an awls ward position. 'Boulart, the officer of artillery, ransacking his brains for the means of sending out men. to spike the guns on the glacis, under the fire of the insurgents from the neighbor ing houses, suddenly remembered he had seen in his magazines some suite of plate armor, and he proposed to try whether, protected by them, men could, not sally out and work in security under musketry fire. He got together 12 complete suits, and dressed out 12 gunners and grenadiers, thus selecting big men, be it remarked. At a certain hour the garrison lined the covered way, and from thence and from the fort opened a steady fire of musketiy and of artillery on the lines of the insurgents. Then out marched the 12 knights of the eighteenth century, ' much in David's state of mind when he complained he had not proved his armor. The men carried handspikes, hammers, and spikes. Moving natur ally, slowly, and awkwardly, in their heavy steel mail, still they succeeded in completing their work under a hail of bullets from the insurgents. The scene is described, as we can well believe, to have been most remarkable, and to have had something picturesque and also diabolical about it. As the mailed figures moved in silence amongst the guns, their handspikes looking like maces, their silence and the slowness of their. action seemed unnatural under tlie steady nail or : bullets. The insurgents were believed ;* to have thought hell itself- had sent ?% forth these extraordinary antagonists, \ ghosts of a past age ; while the French -| on the ramparts, true to their nature, J the first moment of anxiety over, burst -: into roars of laughter.'
