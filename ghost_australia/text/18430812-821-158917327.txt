CHRISTIAN UNION. A. subject of tlie deepest and most thrilling interest is at present laudably engaging the minds and hearts of the professed followers of Christ in England and Scotland, we mean the breaking down of the middle walls of partition which sectarian differences have raised, and the union of all parties in the common bonds of the Gospel, that there may be one flock undet one Shepherd. In these days of lamentable religious dissension and alienation it is refreshing to find a number, however small, of those who hold the great and fundamental doctrines of Christianity repudiating the spirit of cx clusivism considering it at once their duty and privelege to " love as brethren." Indeed Christianity recognizes no such distinctions as the followers of Christ have set up, and which have been the bane of the Church in all ages. * A very little acquaintance with the New Testa ment will convince any one that there is nothing more pressed upon the saints than union and oneness of mind* and nothing more condemned than division ; and yet what is more common, now-a- days, as well as amongst the Corinthian Churches, than for each to set up his own favourite preacher calling himself by his name and following him, every one saying, " I am of Paul, and I of Apollos," and "I of Wesley," and " I of Wliitefieldt" j But what is the rebuke of the Holy Ghost to all such ] through the mouth of the Apostle Paul 1 " While one j saith 1 am of Paul; and another, I am of Apollos, are j ye not carnal ?" Nay, how often is the cross superseded by the shibboleth of a party; the language of the con- I venticle made to contradict the teachings of Him who spake as never man spake ; and human codes and rules and doctrinal tests substituted for the laws and require ments of the " one Lawgiver ?" And who has not often sighed over the bickerings and strifes of private Christians as well as rival sects, and too often beheld brethren of the Established Church and fellow-servants of different Dissenting communities smiting one another and being smitten by the less peaceably disposed within their own pale ? Well might Mr James observe, whose pacific letter on this subject will be found amongst our Religious Intelligence, and to which we direct the special attention of our readers, that " Such is the pre sent alienated, as well as divided state of the different sections of the great body of ProteBtant Christians, that it almost becomes a question, whether our^ first object ought not to be the uuion of the Church, and not the conversion of the world." We have carefully perused the report of the meeting recently convened in London, for the purpose of pro moting union amongst Christians of different evangeli cal denominations, and which called forth Mr James's apostolic letter; and it is from a conviction of the at tractiveness of the subject to our religious readers, and the necessity which exists here as well as elsewhere, of closer union and cooperation amongst professing Chris tians, not only on each other's platforms and by inter changing occasional pulpit services, but by divesting controversy of its bitterness, by disarming it of its as perity, and by freeing it from the disingenuous arts which are so characteristic of it; and by frequent friendly associations conducted in the spirit of Christian benevolence, to produce a more intimate approximation to each other on those points on which they yet differ, whether they relate to doctrine or mode of worship, to church constitution or to discipline. It will be by such a union, combined with the exhibition of sound princi pies, good sense, " a right spirit," and an irreproachable character, that the disciples of Christ will most effec tually declare their fellowship in the truth; and by such means those truths in which they steadfastly believe will be presented to the world in a much more powerful and inviting form than has hitherto been the case. In the Saviour's intercessory prayer he prays that all his people may be " one," that the world might believe that God had sent him ; love to one another is elsewhere declared to be the badge of discipleship; and there is an admirable paraphrase on the Christian union of the New Testament, in the Wesleyan Hymn- Book which we should like to see fulfilled. " Let names and sects and parties fall# And thou, O Christ, be all in all." If Christians, instead of making sects out of their differences would stand together simply as saints, the body of Christ would not be so often divided, and the infidel and scoffer would have less occasion to seize upon those differences as a pretext for their impiety and unbelief; " altar" would not so often be set up " against altarthe externals of religion would give place to its " spirit" and " truth;" sectarian differences would be more seldom insisted upon before heathen converts to whom they have too frequently proved a stumbling block; and forms and ritual observances would not take the place of pure and undefiled religion.
