THE BALLARAT CHURCH CONGRESS. (From our Special Correspondent.) Ballarat, November 22, 1898. Lue in last week bishops from various parts of Australia began to arrive.

It wan however, notable for the lanresl clerical procession which has ever advanced op i the nave of this cathedral church. It was | preceded l?y irunijieters. and a magnificent ! banner, specially worked lor the congress, carrying riie amis oi Uie diocese and the ; bishop's mitre eonsniououslv in the van. The Bishop of ISallarat and Mrs. Thorn- ! ton had given a garden party in the after noon, which turned out, in consequence of the pourinj; raiki, to be sonielliins ot a. verandah aud siairease jtarade. All the ' j bishops, however, were there, and more ! than 150 invited *rues:.s ?b 0 were not in , ■ any way deterred from social enjoyment ! by fear of a wetting. Happily Bishops i ; Court lias large rojnis aud verandahs, as j ■ well as a heauf.iul garden. The wetting kept them from the cathedral in the oven i ing. On Tuesday morning the Mayors of BaJ- 1 j larat and Ballarat ICast joined in weleom- ! ing W the city and to the City Hall, which tl'.ey have placed at the disposal of con gress, the representatives of the fourth Ciiurch Congress held in Australia. The last was at Ilobart in 1891; the next it is hoped will be in Adelaide at a date to be I fixed later. The City Hall is large enough to seat some 600 people. It is profusely and tastefully adorned with banners and liass. with portraits of municipal cele brities and historic objects. The presi dent (the Mi.sliop of UmlnraO sits aloft in a vast platfoi-m-pnlpit- irihune sort of box. such as we are taught to l>elieve is the rostrum of the French Assembly. The secretary of congress (Archdeacon Tuckerl sits just beneath him. The archbishop and other bishops on a row of chairs to the right of the president, somewhat lower. They look not unlike a panel of jurymen. The hall is fairly well filled for the presi dent's inaugural address, which is de livered first of all. It lias been printed beforehand, and can be bouglit, the presi dent says, for the sum of threepence, if anybody thinks it worth while. The Bishop of Bailarai can rise to an occasion: He is the oldest member of the Australian l«?nch, iiavinfi been 23 years a bishop.. He claims therefore to have some experience, and to be able to give tome general ideas of colonial life. With n clear, resonant voice, in which every syllable is sounded and every point is pointed by inflection, with a humor which sparkles and gleams, he delivers what is universally declared to be a most notable, outspoken, aud able ad dress. It will be read very largely in all Australia. It is by no means full of praise only. It is by no means free from ideas' which many Churchmen will freely criticise. With all this, it. was strikingly delivered and closely followed. There -were times when lflud applause greeted recognition of clerical poverty, of Australian loyalty, of Ballarat's beauty and hospitality. Again there were times when a eh ill inn silence marked doubtful acceptance of certain, views—as when the liishop ceemed to think it undesirable to mark the limits of Uie church on cartli. The address was bristling with brilliant phrases—such as theac:—"lt behoves the eulogists of our local beauties to remember that they merit the criticism of guests from Adelaide, sparkling at Mount lefty's foot; from Uie witchery of Sydney Harbor; and from the slopes that girdle Hobart with loveliness; or in. speaking of the divisions in Christendom:—^ ? "There is no rancour between denomi nations here, thank God for that; but there is an unseemly 'racing.' ... How docs the Church of the Most High present itself in hundreds of bush towns, cen tering in one handsome school for teach ing only the secularises—one dicnified Courthouse fortrving evil doers? In the form of a handful of scattered paltry, often hideous, worship shevis —monuments of our partisanship and opinionatiyeness in relicion: their congregations vying with each other, not sotnuch (to all appear ance) in honoring God and savin;; souls as in carrrinjr out devices and entertainments for the enlistment of patronage, and the recruiting of a starveling trcasurv.** "We listen to tlie cabled hnlmub of ritualistic strife in Vngland. much as tbe placid surface of I-ake Ontario listens to the disUnt drumming of Niagara Falls." Tlie bishop was very out api>Ven in pointing out what he considered the chief dangers of Australian society—tbe doubt ful decrease of crime, the profanity, jn teniperance, and lust of snme bush towns, the Divorce Courts and their pestilent ro port«. the "contemptible country po*ss," the bitterness between employer and cm ploved. All this he prefaced with the re mark — "Tlie people of iheze colonies are one of the strongest, most courageous, cap able, nimble-minded, progressive, and interesting races the world has ever seen. Occupying a splendid land. with radiant climate. cx haust]?ss resources, and almost infinite po^siliilities. so soon as they are welded into one by Federation a glorious future ought to be before the Australian peonle." A crowded audience assemhled at 220 to listen to a paper read by the Bishop of Tasmania, ami followed by one from the Dean of Newcastle, on "The Church in her relation to the development of Australian character." The bishop preached the need of discipline, of self- control, of reve rence. The dean wished for more ecclesias tical organisation, and that of a nature more useful than the kind known in Xew South Wa3es. Ex- Judge Wilkinson said a great many things that were true, and some few that were audible. Then the Bishop of Newcastle took the flo3r and questioned whether there existed such a thing yetas character distinctly Australian. Certainly there was a Jove of novelty— particularly of. new preachers; there was at times a not inconsiderable self-conceit. Chnreh history ought to lw more taught. Our long descent ought to be more widely known—that we were not a paper-made Church datiug from Henry VIII.. and th.it our Orders were not given from below, but from above. Then followed an amusinc address from the Kcv. F.. C. Hindlev. who was able to demonstrate that the Yankee is of John Bull type, plus the Eed Indian, and averred that wherever original settlers deviated from their inherited type in a new coun try they deviated in the direction of the aboriginal. Tt was Archdeacon Wliitinjrton who. proclaiming that he was native horn, took great praise to himself for standing uj? after what had been said about Australian characteristics. He could not agree with what had been said by tiie president in his charge. The Church had not mani fested the maxim of "Advance Australia." The Church of England had not done its duty in the early limes of colonial history- It, had been slow. It had not been definite. It had not lwen progressive. What Aus tralian men demanded more than any thing else was that they should know what you were aiming at, and then even if they dissented they did not cease to respect. The Churdi must be clear in its teaching, clear about its duty, and -willing to take up all puMic questions, even of politics, which were not party questions. He sat down amid volleys of applause. Siliarat. .November 23. The press here while not unanimous in praising the president's address is certain that it was very impressive, and that com ling from the moat experienced of An* v tralian bishops it will receive much attea, r tion. The unlaudatory parts have taztaaf ■ been severely criticised by the "Kuit« Association-" The Melbourne "Ai&u.; «cv ■? ports that the address was rcinarkaoW lie rev. gentleman laying the banft^ great vigor on almost every paase « eolo-, nial life. Dr. Thornton, however, did not speak as criticising strangers, but as flWor. withiu. who regretted the deplorable «o?? ditions of his own land. - • ....

Then the speakers at Con*ies?#* and the Governor and staff -were all paaio-':.:l graphed together. J.-7&' It wfll be remembered that Congress *•*?« no legislative power.

' Tb?"S3 greatest bar to reunion with Rome flutniSi part of the Catholic Church was the doc-;;! trine of Papal supremacy. After the Be-^Ss formation the Pope expressed himself <e?fig| tirely willing to accept the whole of tfceSi finglish Prayer Book, almost aa it mr^ stands, if only Elizabeth would recognise'.V^ his supremacy.

They were chienVSl useful as a standing witness to the pet 3*¥.3 of importing philosophical terms into th*'<-' Catholic creed.

It was in much the usual style . of such pleas. The chaplain of the arch bishop supported the idea in a apeeet.'rfi which was neither remarkable for modesty' "' nor wisdom.
