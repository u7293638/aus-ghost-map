To THE EDITOR OF THE SYDNEY MONITOR, SIR, It is not true that Mr. Levey intends to treat the people with a spectacle of ghosts and hobgoblins; in lieu of plays. Mr. L. will not allow any thing to be performed without the sanction of a Committee of Gentlemen of the first rank and intelligence. Mr. L. has, in fact, put it out of his own power as to what particular representations shall be performed. Your's, &c.; A FRIEND TO THE DRAMA.
