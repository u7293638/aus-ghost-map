THE DAVENPORTS' SEANOE. I BY A VAGABOWO. In spite of the counter attraction of tfat b≪ at Government-boose, the Toim- hi&mi; fairly filled on Thursday night.

Hundreds do jbat trick-the Davenports much better than the rest. Again they entered the cabinet, ad in a little more than two minutes the jntredoorwas thrown open, and tambourines hurled oat, as always from one side, and iltenrardB the brothers were found bound, tighter, said the committee, than before, one them appearing greatly distressed, and ,th as if having undergone great exertion, ir. Service remarked their condition, bat >rofessoi Fay had an answer pat, "Folks mat freeze shut up in that cabinet half an boor." Then Mr. Service took his seat "amid loud cheers," his hands tied to the brothers as usual, and musical instruments toped on bis lap. The door was closed, and k customary row ensued, and afterwards Mr. Service was found released. He said he felt "something like a beetle crawling over his .
