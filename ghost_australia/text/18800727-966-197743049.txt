The business was somewhat more smoothly got through than on Saturday evening, and the leading points of the tragedy, particularly those in which the Prince is present, were received with enthusiasm. When Mr. Fairclough was in Adelaide last the appearance of the spirit of Hamlet's father in form was omitted, and the innovation seemed a sensible one, but he has evidently not found that the average playgoer cares for the tragedy without it, and bas therefore returned to the conventional Ghost.
