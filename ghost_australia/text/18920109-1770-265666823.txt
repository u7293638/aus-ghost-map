To HIE EDITOR OF THE TARH.1XGOWER TIMES. SIR,—It is an old axiom, " Tho' a manbe ever so poor, it is always well to show a respectable appearance to the world," aud there is uo doubt a great deal of truth in it—at least in many Cases it assures him credit with his butcher aud baker, and induces tlie not too liberal pub. to give liiin a refresher occasionally ; but I am afi-aid I am wandering from what I intended to say, viz.-"-At least if we arc poor our council might try not to spoil the beauty of our pretty town by removing that ghost of a tree (or else .plant bome ivy to cover its' nakedness) opposite the Bank ot Victoria, and a weli- known. private citizen, and owner of property in the same neighborhood would do well to effect some slight repairs aud add a little paint to the signboards on his buildings, lor at present they have a Very dilapidated -appearancc. I should" imagine that our shire council arc now accumulating a lot of money, as they appear to be strictly following the principles of Mr. Munro and spending next to nothing, at the same time letting everything go to the dogs, forgetting ubc old maxim that " a stitch in time saves nine." I would point out to them a warning that years ago a certain councillor (and still a live one) had all bridecs built -on -the frame principle ; a great flood came ; result, every .bridge w.-s swept away. At an imireuse cost pile bridges, were erected, whudi have withstood all floods since | but, unfortunately, the council. has never recovered its financial posltioii. The writer gives the above illustration simply to show that by neglecting or patching up work, in | the cud dcable'or treble tlie outlay will be required to carry out the work than if undertaken at once. At present the crown of the Main-road is perfectly hollow, sidetables full of water i uts, and many of the footpaths on -the leading streets In a dis graceful state; in fact, when wet weather sets in they will be impasiable.—Yours £c., RATEPAYER. ?
