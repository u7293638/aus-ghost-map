V.A.T.C. SUMMER MEETING. |By Telegraph, j Melbourne, December 2G. These races held to-day passed ott most successfully. The weather was beautiful, aud the attendance fair considering the numerous counter- attractions. The Grand Stand enclosure, however., was thinly patro nised, owing in a large measure to the want of proper accommodation on the railway, cattle trucks only being employed to convey visitors to and from the course. The new betting-ring, outside which betting was pro hibited, was UBed for the first time, and gave great dissatisfaction to the bookmakers who, while cheerfully paving the pound license fee, complained loudly against the restriction imposed, and after two or three races they left the ring, and carried on operations out side as usual. _ ThS ring, which is enclosed with" a low picket-fence, was open to the public. The chief ground of objection was that being situated some distance down the saddling paddock, it prevented business being done after the horses went to the post. In the Hurdle Race a protest entered bv the owner of Dhurriaghile against Lady Hamp den, on the ground of crossing, was dismissed. The following are the particulars:— SELLING RACE, Of 100 sots.
