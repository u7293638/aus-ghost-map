Concerning W.A. A thirsty land tor a thirst band- Grey ghosts in'the trails of .the boldr— The frenzied cry where the fever'd die— The shame of the woman sold— The easy mart for the gamblers' art Who play in the game of gold! Ah 1 who shajl s&y; in .the years to. toe— Oh, future of promise fair !— That all the w;ealth of thy monarchy, With all its pomp of'prosperity, Shall weigh in the balance, fair and.squars, With the load of a thousand hearts' despair! And a voioe comes lo>ir whpre;the dreamer* drink : . . . " In a sea of gall shall thy glones sink, Aiffl the hearts' despair of the living load tSbail lead the hravfi, and the: falt'nng Till ^6ts of blood shall the mightv sage Pour out on thy grovel- painted page!" ~"" dn.
