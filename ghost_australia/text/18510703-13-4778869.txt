Our busy days, our lonely nights, i Thv trackless z me surrounds, Caro hath no bond, and life no Inn, To pat t us from thy bounds. The exile crosses to his horns, The aged to his youth, Tis hard to find his promised land, The sago in search of truth. And Borne return with tidings heard From angels on their ti nek, Vv'hieh never in the speech of men The Â¡r souls can render back;. Thou holdest the harvest homes of hope That never blest our years, The grave of many a buried grief, The ghosts of all our fears ; For weary wastes and wilds are thine : But oh ! for one true chart To guide us to thy blessed isles That lie so far apart ! Our souls have seen them when they sought Their heritage ill thee, For wide and wondrous were the realms Of which they were made free ; "With liberty that never wore The bondage hard and cold," Of shallow praise, or paltry gain, To which our days were sold. 'The dead are in theo, we have seen . Their looks, and mouniM no more, And the stop? have wandered for and long That met us on thy shore. And some for whom no could forgive Our fortunes all the past, The loved and v orld-pnrled head Is Wore with our own at last. Not as they met us here, perchance , The fruit, the poor of hotel, Whom gold can bribe, whom words can sway, Whom sin and fear con lies ; But it 113 in love, and firm in faith, And all we deem it times, They might have been, were this cold earth Less full of cures and crimes. OF lovely art thou, world of dreams, To hearts that find thee thus, Mud-- glorious with that better paid Life never made to us. Our fields of toil, our tents of care, Are pitches-' horribly streams, But our spirit's country lies in thee, Thou soundless world of dreams ; Fawns Rnnwv.
