The Sculling Championship. SpeciaIi et 'LrmiB Joecr.' BEACH v. GAUDA-TTE. Loebok. S«ntemlwr20. X Kave In ny time bees present at many interesting aquatic contests in England and elsewhere, and I have a vivid recollection of the stubborn race for the amateur championship of England betweem Ijowades and Payne, as well as the nerer-to-be-f orgottea TJniTerBity race of tfaifl year, and the desperate struggles between Perkins and ?eter £emp,Hacterson and Boss, Hatterson&ad; Teemer, and StU'B last race irith I*e ; but never have I mtaessed aco»t«Btwkich.for severity aad «xciteiae&t; has equalled the great eveat of hist Saturday— the tace for the sculling championship of tie world between Beach andGandanr, which oertainly stamds imexampled. is tke anaals of boating. Owing to tke champion's easy victory in the Great International Sweepstakes tke xace in ques tion did not create anything like the interest which centred in the famous meetiag of Hanlan and xrickett in 1880. xne result was loona upon as a iorcgone condnsie*. Tke attendance of the publac was therefore not seady so large as might ha-re been expected on. «o im portant aa occasion, and tha b«a.ts which, followed the race were, comparatively, but poorly patronised. The idea had got abroad: that Beach was invincible, ana that the affair was next door to a walk oTer for him. Even the river-aide tal«nt— the aquatic quii-nuncs— -were of opinion that though QanAatzr might be able to make, a semblance of a show for a short distance, the race -would be virtually over lo-g before Hammersmith was reached. This was not my opinion, however. Tor those who do me the honor to read ay weekly xoteB, will recollect that I have always expressed a high opinion of Gandaur's ability, and Ihave said that ke was to my mind the best of the Transatlantics. The improvement he had made daring the last week or so before the race was simply astonishing, and frbxt the time of the arrival of Mr. St. John, his backer, at Putney, he has seemed to be a new man altogether. I recorded in your columns long ago What David Ward — Hanians quondam supporter, and pexhapi the best judge of bcoII ing in the world— told me of 'Jak«' even as much as six jears ago. He then assured me that Saudaur was, if anything, better than Hgnlnn ; and this was no mean praise, as the ' phenomenon' was then in the zenith of his -ower. Bearing this ia mind, I watched Master 'Jake' very closely in his traisimg, and I c&utioned; Beach that he would find him a very hard nut to crack. The result has preved that I was not very far oat in my judgment; for I i&ve; it from the champion's own lips that never in Ms life had he to zow so hard a xace, and ke hoped he might sever have to do eo again. As the sequel will show the race resolved itself into a question of down right bulldog pluck and physical strength, in which Beach lad just a little — very little the better of it. Both men were in the bloom of health, and Beach, who was trained to the hour, weighed about list 31b. Osodanr, though fit and well, weuld have been all the better tor another week's work, which it is perhaps as well for Beach he didn't have. He has lately been f eeliig lonely amd home sick ; and it was only when his good, generous friend and backer, Mr. St. John, arrived from Ameriea, that ke put any heart into his work, Se drew the scale at 12st 51b; so there was little to choose between the men as regards weight. TBS DAT was all that could be desired — a fairish tide was ruining, and uemitle breaze blew from the north- east. The Thames sonservancy arrangements were much better than on many recent occasions, and though the river was swarming with -oats of all descriptions, it cannot be said that the course iras badly kept, or that tke men were interfered with. is any way. It bad been arranged that the start should take place at 4.30, but the delay which, seems to be inseparable from sculling races on the Thames took place, ind it was folly 20 minutes or mere after time when the tea took, to their beats. Gaudanr was the first to appear, arrayed in a dark red sleeveless jersey and white trunks. He was quickly followed bythe champion, who was attired in jersey and trunks of yellow and black — the colors, I believe, of the Balmain K. C. — and a Cobden B. C. cap, of which dub no is an honorary member. Messrs. Deeble and Bt. John tossedfor stations, and th» former won for the 'champion, who left the choice to his pilot, jporonce in a way Tom Green displayed a LACK Of JXTDSHEST, aa he selected the Surrey station, which was decidedly the less favorable. He may have been influenced possibly by the fact that the tide was beginning to lose its strength, and he thought lie would have the fastest water; but ex perts were unanimous in saying tkat he committed a grave mist-*1''. 'While the men were backing to their starting skifEs some attempt at betting was made on board the umpire's brat, where tb.« bookies 'most do congregate,' but very little was done, 5 to 1 being the offer on Beach. All being nowin readin«si,at 4.5i., IKE BACK KEGAJT by mutual consent,, both men striking' the water simul taneously. It was evident that Beach was determined to force the pace, for he put his sculls in at the rate of 39 to the minute against 6aadaur'sS7. But notwithstanding this, the long powerful strokes of the Canadian drove his boat in front, and opposite the steamboat pier he had about 6ft the better of it. Beach sow appeared to put more power on, and by the time they reached the Star and Garter the boats were exactly level. Here Gaudaur began to forge ahead again., and passing what used to be called Bishop's Creek (lmin 29sec), he was about half a length to the good. Beach was now rowing his very hardest, and though the shelter afforded by the concrete wall favored the Canadian somewhat, tke champion gradually made up lost ground, and about half way up the wall 'level all' was again the erder of the day. Up to this time Gaudaur had hot been sculling in any thing like the form he had shown in^ practice. He ??screwed' about a good deal, and his finish was not by any means clean, contrasting in this respect most un favorably with Beach, who was rowing like a piece of machinery. Nevertheless, tke Canadian's sweeping stroke kept his boat on the move, and Tom Green had to call on Beach, wkj responded by a few vigorous strokes, and when he passed the Craven Steps (2min S2see), he had an advantage of about half a. length. Here Qaudanr bagan to wake up also, and by dint of hard work he had onee more got nearly level at Craven Cottage. This, however, was only momentary, for on reaching Walden's Beaeh. was again leading by half a length ; and when the spot where the Old Mile Tree used to stand Vlmia Slsec) he had just drawn his boat clear. At Rose Bank this advantage was increased to half a length, and at the Crab Tree a length clear divided tke beats. The race now looked as good as over, for after hehad passed the Soap Works (7min 20sec) with a lead of a length and a half, backers offered 10 TO 1 OK BEACH. It was evidtnt however that both men had had about enough of it, though they both held on gamely. Beach, either from fatigue, or because he took his eye off his pilot, here got a bit out of his course, and began to get athwart the current, so that in making the sho«t of the temporary Hammersmith bridge (9sec even), ho HAK^OWLT ESCAFID AS ACCrDEHT, for he had to pull hard on one hand to clear the buttress, which he struck hard with his right scuIL This contre temps appeared to flurry him a little, and' Qaudaur managed: to gain a length. Still it looked AHT ODDS OH BEACH, who once more drew away, and at the bottom of Cbiswick Eyot was fully three lengths ahead. Presently a. yell went up 'beach is BSixsxr.' andsare enough, despite Tom Green's frantlcgesticulations, the champion began to lose ground, and cheered on by Harry KeJUey (who had steered him a splendid course), Gauaaur began to creep up, and gradually decreasing Beach's load, which at Chiswick Church (13ntin 58sec) was reduced to little more than half a length. Still gaining stroke by stroke the gallant Canadian, when opposite Thorajcrof t's, actually took the lead. 5 TO 1 OK 6ATJDAUB was now offered in vain, and it certainly looked as.if the xace was over, for BEACH ACTTJALIT STOPPED XOWZ&G; for a second or two, apparently done up. I could hardly belie?* my eyes. The great Beach, the stayer of stayers, rowed to a standstill I Herer! He surely must be ' kidding' for a motive, and acting upon this idea I rashly invested £10 at the proffered odds. Tom Green now be came wildly excited, and calling upon Beach for an effort, the champion responded gamely and went off in pursuit of Gandaur, who was so dons up that he could only take advantage of his opponent's stoppage to the extent of half a length, by which distance he led at the pumping station. Never was such a struggle seen before on the Thames or anywhere else, and never did two men exhibit suoh DOWKBIQKT BtttLDOG COURAGE. Beaeh was rowing the stronger of the two sow, and in about one hundred yards or so, he had again drawn level, liven bow, it was anybody's race and the betting was even once more. But just as we Australian's were beginning to pluck up spirit again BEACH WAS AGAIH BEEH SO FAUES, and this time he fairly stopped, and once more we heard the cry ' Beach, is beaten.' There was no ™irtnV« about' it this time — a look at Deeblc's face was enough ; he was ae pale as a ghost. Kelley yelled at bis man, but ' Jake ' poor fellow could take but little advantage of Beach's collapse, as he was so done up 'hiwiimif that he could hardl/dxag his acuUs through the water. 100 TQ 5 OH &ATTHATTB; was now offered in vain, as the'Canadian managed to gain not quite a boatfs length. Once again did TEom Green call upon Beach, who was completely exhausted. ' Go on, Bill; he's beat too,' fhoutod Qreea? but all his persuasion was in vain till the champion's thoughts at this supreme moment flew back to Sydney. This was enough fox kirn. ' wHAX-wrfiL zhxt sat xs AtrsnuiiA?' So sooner had -this thought flashed through Us brain than, inspired by fresh courage, be nerved nijuelf for a flna etruggl«,andgiftedA» it were with renewed strength he set to work again. Sever have I seen such excitement as there was when slowly, but surely, n» began to creep up, and at the Bull's Head ke was once more level. Being' on bis own ground, as it were, bis partisans on the river bank were numerous and enthusiastic, and urged on by their cheers lie continued to pain, and at Barnes's Bridge (lSrain 68sec, (he fastest time on record) he was leading by half a lenjrth, Th« race was now over in reality, for poor Gaudanr, thoagh still persevering pluckily, was dead beaten, and when Beach passed his quarters at the 'White Hart he had placed daylight be tween the boats, and amid unparalleled excitement he passed the port at TffoTtinkn by nearly three lengths, in the extraordinary time of SSmia 29s«c, Gaudaur passing at gamin SVaec ri E- *( niuX SOWED, BSJLCSf' K SSJLVO, QAGTM.B1L,** ran? out from a thousand - throats, and cheor after cheer burst forth as Gaudaur rowed up alongside of the cham Jilon, and shook him warudy bythe hand saying, ** TOtr'ftS A WOXDXB.'
