VICTORIA AMATEUR TURF CLUB SPRING MEETING. Freer Day— Sxtubday, 11th October. Fob the opening day the Victoria Amateur Turf Olnb was very unfortunate from a meteorological point of view, other wise there waa nothing to cavil at. For a ooople of days previous rain had fallen heavily, and on Saturday morning tbe sky betokened a continuance of the watery visita tion ; and it did not belie its looks, for throughout tho afternoon there were several very heavy showers. Notwithstanding tbe QDpropitiouB state of the weather his Excel lency the Governor and suite visited tbe oourse. The attendance was Large when tbe bell rang for the Maiden Plate candidates to saddle up, the favourite for which was Tbe Bey, a St. Albans colt. The winner, however, turned up in tbe Caulfield trained horse, Norfolk, who won by a neok from Duration. Tbe Hurdle Raoe resulted in a surprise, the de spised outsider, Sinking Fund, wiuolog some what easily-from the heavily-backed Yately. Heavy rain fell just before the raoe was Started, but it kept off Jwhilst ths avast was being run. 'Twelve two-year-olds faced the starter for the Great Foal Stakes. Ring master, by King of tbe Ring— Ysrdley, was installed first favourite, and be won comfortably by a length at the finish, albeit he was disappointed at tbe turn. He was trained by James Wilson, jun., at Flemington. Daring the raoe Lady Adelaide's jockey waa unseated, but, beyond a shaking, he reoeived no injury. Although rain began to fall heavily, tbe Guineas can didates were all interviewed under tbe sheds. Rufue came in for a large share of attention, but the likeliest-looking Derby horse was Merrimu. Before the fall ef tbe flag 5 to 2 was difficult to obtain about tbe Williams- town representative, Helene. Tremando and David coming next in publio estimation. There is little to be told in connection with tba race, for after they had covered half a mile the 20 to 1 Sandal went to the front, was never headed, aud won by a couple of length, a eimilar distance separating Grati tude, who was second, from Helene. Pilot wa tbe whipper-in. For the Findon Harriers' " Vase" the strong field of 2G banters saddled up, the favourite. Chieftain, hailing from Ballarat. That his friends, who took 36 to 1 about their horse, knew bis excel lence was made clear, for at tbe fioish he bad everything in difficulties, and wou by four lengths from old Abdallah, who was fol lowed by Tbe Clown. Had not Yankee Grab come to grief over Syphon at tbe lent fenoe, probably the winner would not have bad such any easy win. TbeToorak Handi oap resulted iu an easy victory for Preoious Stone from tbe favourite, Meteor, and Prodi gal, tbe Tasmanian candidate.
