presbyterian union. DISCUSSION IN SYDNEY CHURCH ASSEMBLY. T SYDNEY. Tlmrsdav. Most of to-day's sitting of tlio Presby terian Assembly was occupied by "a discus sion on tlie scheme of federal. union. '.'A re- irart subai i-tlted upon intercourse with other ciliurches included a. report on union. Dr. Laing said that four years ago appear- ances were very much in -favor of the early consuriiination of union in Victoria. How ever, a certain party with certain fears had made certain changes, witii the. result' limit the matter had "been delayed for two years. There was still a small section; in Victoria which was disturbed abou't some points, so that the question remained where it stood two years back. It was peculiar that all the difficulties and delays had come from Victorian churches. Ghosts had 'been raised which it seemed to be the desire of some of their Victorian, brethren'' to lay. Ho did not say the ghosts were not real. They -were'roal to those -who feared ghosts. (Laughter.) It was their duty, therefore, to consider the condition of their Victorian brethren who feared ghosts. (Laughter.) There 'were, ' however, in the Alctorian church "liien of stouter mould, who saw no ghosts at all. Tho present was an import ant crisis/and he asked the house' to con sider the importance of the situation. It rested with "t-hein whether there should he an immediate union or a postponement sine die. The discussion was adjourned until to morrow. - : '
