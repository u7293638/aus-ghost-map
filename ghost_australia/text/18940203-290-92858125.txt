COOKE.1 When you find a certain lack In the stiffness of your back At a threatened fierce attack, Just tbe hour That you need yo»r every power, *JUUK a DIG For a thought to baffle it. .) ust recall tbat every knave, Every coward, can be brave Till the time That his courage should be prime — Then 'tis fled. Keep your head ! What a folly 'tis to lose it Just the time you want to use it ! When the ghost of some old shirk Comes to plague you, and to lurk In your study or your work, Here's a hit Like enough will settle it. Knowledge is a worthy prize ; Knowledge comes to him who tries — Whose endeavor Ceases never. Everybody would be wise As his neighbor, Were it not they who labor For the trophy creep, creep, creep, While the others lag or sleep ; And the sun comes up some day To behold one on his way Past the goal Which the soul Of another has desired. But whose motto was, 'I'm tired.' When the task of keeping guard Of your heart — Keeping weary watch and ward ' Of the part You are called upon to play Every day — Is becoming dry and hard — Conscience languid, virtue irksome, Good behavior growing worksomc — Think this thought : Doubtless everybody could, Doubtless everybody would, Be superlatively good, Were it nob That it's harder keeping straight Than it is to deviate : And to keep the way of right You must nave the pluck to fig tit.
