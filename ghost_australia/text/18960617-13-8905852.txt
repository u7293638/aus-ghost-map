'" "'i LONDON, May 16, Last Friday's debate on the Transvaal question revealed the policy of the Government, and to that extent public curiosity has been satisfied Public opinion, however, is by no means content with the Ministerial intentions Apart from the Opposition, whose duty is to suppose, there is a solid phalanx outside party lines, which is far from satisfied with what is roughly called the policy of whitewashing the Chartered Company On the other hand, there is a still larger body of public opinion that disapproves of the musical demand to secure the abolition of the company Nor are there many who commend such sweeping condemnation as that of Sir William V Harcourt the right hon gentleman s Speech was one long indictment, of the Old Bailey types speech for the prosecution According to Sir William, Dr Jameson was only a suburb n ite agent and the cipher telegrams, which he accepted as genuine, revealed a terrible condition of affairs which raised the question whether the administration of the company ought to remain in the hands of those who had grossly misused their powers While he did not believe that Mr Rhodes was actuated by a desire for gum, he was satisfied that the lust of dominion might find men as much astray as the greed of gold In this remark Sir W lllinm was supposed to endorse the Boer statement that Mr Cecil Rhodes has been playing for the first presidentship of a South African confederation Sir William Harcourt considered that the whole spirit of recent transactions at the Cape had been the spirit of Mammon If the Government continued the

Until that was done there would be no rest for South Africa. Mr. Chamberlain has been moved by these utterances of President Kruger to send him a telef nun urging him not to base his opinion upon abbreviated re parts of the Parliamentary debate, and cor lecting the Premier's inferences as to the supposed championship by the Government of Mr Cecil Rhodes. A good many persons present Mr. Chamberlain's desire to make soothing explanations to Kruger, 'the right hon. gentleman certainly deserves the reward of those who labour for pence. The only other subject in Parliament I worth noticing during the past week was the division on the second readings the 1 duett tion Bill. It was upon this measure that the Opposition challenged the Government for the first time upon a leading subject since the last general election, and the result has been simply disastrous. In place of a normal majority of ICO, the Government votes on Tuesday night were UM to 150, being a majority of 207. '1 life was brought about by the Irish vote, numbering CS, going into the Government lobby. 'Du- whole of the Irish party would have supported thcMiniatcrshnd they been in town, for upon this subject they bodily deserted their Hudical friends in obedience to the direction of the priesthood. 'Die outcome of these events will be very serious to the Opposition. The Itttdiculs have expressed the bitterest disappointment at the desertion of their Irish allies. The Coiigrefiattonsl-l'nloii, which Is I now in session, has, on the motion of Mr. Carvell Williams, seconded by the Rev. C. A. Herr), passed a resolution expressing profound disappointment at the attitude of the Irish party, Mr. Berry said the Nonconformists of England had sacrificed much for Ireland, but the notion of the Irish members had postponed Home Rule to a date which could not be guessed. In future, however, it would not be put before questions in which English Liberals were more deeply concerned. The Radical Committee of the House of Commons, instead of adopting a programme of Home Rule all round, have determined to have a platform of only one plank, viz, the abolition of the House of Lords. 'the ablest speech during the whole of the second reading discussions was delivered by Sir Edward Clarke, who showed a masterly knowledge of the subject, and advanced his position as one of the finest debaters in the present House. Lord li. Cecil, the fifth son of the Prime Minister, made his maiden speech, which was an exceedingly clever performance. 'The House was empty when he began, but it was full before he finished, All the rising young men are on the Conservative side of the House. The revolt of the Irish members once more shows how great is the power of the Roman hierarchy). They have now got absolute control of the Irish brigade, and though their influence will had to much worry about such questions as Catholic education and the Catholic University, it will effectually) lay the ghost of Home Rule.
