INTERCOLONIAL CRICKET. VICTORIA V. SOUTH AUSTRALIA. GIFFEN AGAIN SCORES. There was a great falling off authentic dance j yesterday when play was continued in the. match between Victoria and South Australia on the Melbourne Cricket ground By this time even enthusiasts in the game have had a surfeit of it, and those who have some thing else to do have gone to do it. There were still some who wished to see the game, and a hose only objection was put ing for admission One enterprising)outh had hit upon the ingenious plan of scaling the fence, then going out on a check and selling it at half the price of admission On being arrested he merely expressed the opinion that the in dustry was a good one, and that he would have c ' copped a bit at it but for the inter ference of the police What with discouraging admission to the ground and practically gagging those who do chance to get over without being seen, the Melbourne Cricket Club is taking all the charm out of cricket for one section of the community) Tortu namely football is still untrammelled by these etc etc restrictions, and freedom of speech will only tia heretoforocostarelaxed throat, and not the Â£3 fine, which was yesterday imposed on fruit patron of cricket who expresses! him self too warmly) on Tuesday The day was sultry in the extreme, and there was quite as much i'iltasiire in watching cricket as in taking part in it In fact several of the Vic towns were heard to say during the day that they could not understand all this anxiety to get a place in Victorian elevens When play ceased on Tuesday) the South Australians with OF for one wicket had a lead of 160 runs Gillen and Jarvis, with 20 apiece, took the creases to the bowling of Carlton and Trott, the slow bowler, for better luck, taking the opposite end to which he had previously bowled Giffen commenced business by driving Carlton to the on for 3 In Trott's first-ever Jarvis ran out and touched one of the slows just hard enough to keep it away from Lewis and not hard enough to put it over to Carlton in the slips although the latter tried hard to reach it, and in the follow- ing over ployed one close back torrent, all tempting, but none of them chances Although the batsmen put lots of weight into their strokes, Gillens drives being especially) hard, they could for a long time "as nothing but singles Jame finall) drove one of Irotts high and straight to the lence, and, us in the first innings, his cutting was clean and correct the running between wickets was good, and the batsmen second run for run, "33 all being posted '1 roll put an extra fieldsman in the dur i for Tara is the men being with one exception all in front of the wicket Jarvis got another of Trotts just clear of the field, the ball going over Walters s head, but Giffen ployed him very neatly to leg for 3 and June is smacked the next close to the oft fence for the same number M'Leod came on in place of J road when only a run was wanting to complete the hundred, and when the three figures were hoisted Jarvis had got 43 and Giffm 40 Jan ia was cheered for the prettiest stroke of the day, a cut past point, but Giffen especially) stated Carlton with every) respect, and got few runs from him, the first good one being an on drive for a couple Carlton gave the ball up to Worrell, however, when the score was less Giffen was batting with that mathematical accuracy) which, in his case usually means a mammoth score, while Jarvis playing sound cricket on the whole, it is less certain in some of his strokes It was not so much bourne to watch as batting to win, and the scores were called again ' 48 all Giffm got man) of Ina runs li) placing them to the on, where M'Leod was fielding as a sort of forward square leg Giffen was the first to reach the 60, Harry just failing to catch up to an oil drive to the boundary) He also put some power into an on hit at Worrall, but Bruce was in the way of the 4 M'Leod got his fingers warmed too, in stopping a hot return from Giffen the ball just whistling along the patched pitch Bruce was the next change and Trott came back with the immediate result that the ball, which had been keeping to the grass, Bought the air again one off hit by Jarvis going within a foot of M'Leod Giffen had gone right away from his partner, and reached 60 li nile Jarvis still hung on the 48 There was no excitement, for the batting, though sound, was to the Philistine altogether uninteresting The batsmen appeared to be holding themselves in reserve to smash the bowling about when all the starch was out of it. At lunch time the score was 138, Giffm fcO and Jarvis 51 Vi lull Jame was on the 13 Lewis had had a chance of stumping him, but the ball came so slowly that he took it in front of the wicket, and his over eagerness lost him the chair After luncheon the fieldsmen came out in Indian file, like men who had had all the exercise they wanted for that day Jarvis was particularly busy), but put one of Irotts almost within reach of M'Leod now the only man on the Victorian side who had t missed a winner Irotts luck would have lost A\ Waterloo had he been a Wellington Laver bowled at the other end there was still no bustle in the South Australian batting, both men just trotting for the runs Jarvis tried hard to avoid the exertion by Sweeping Trott to leg but it would t me to the fence, and he had to run his three At last Jarvis tried to pull a ball, got under it and gave Carlton at mid on an easy) catch He had got 64, and, while giving a couple of chances, his play in the match again made it a matter for wonder that he had not got more runs in England His score for either innings was more than his aggregate of 79 for 21 innings during the whole English tour, and 135 runs for a match looks anything but had cricket It would seem to imply, too, that our bow 1 ing is not quite of the same quality as the Enghsh 'The South Australians have a theory that Jarvis is of no use as a bat unless sent in first nndtheaetwo innings bear out that view The second wicket fell for his Reedman, who was next man, appeared to be in better fettle with the sions than in the first innings, and commenced to score briskly at put one of Irotts high in the air from a miss hit, but again right arm) from a man Laver kept them very) straight, and few runs were got from him Worrall still tamed most of the honours in holding stopping' very) hard off drives at his favourite post C M'Leod had another try, and Reedman drove him very prettily), his batting being altogether more attractive, it not more valuable, than Giffen s Carlton had a try again, although Trott was so far the only man from whose bowling accidents seemed probable Reedman Ilktu Carlton's bowling, went out to him lately, and was no time in getting into the twenties, his dashing down a pleasing the onlookers almost as much us Lions s Although the ground was last it was a long time before a second boundary hit was got Gillen being the performer to long leg It was one of the few he fell) hat there being content for the most part with the glance The runs came now with a rattle at both ends, Giffen being cheered for another slashing 4 to leg. 1 his stroke brought 200 up Giffm having 92 and Leeilman 2d Itccdmun stopped at that Running out to Carlton he lifted one high to long on, and Bruce getting back close to the fence made a very nice catch Ketdmans innings was the only bit of cricket of the day really worth watching unless one were fanatic call) fond of the game 1 bree for200 was the wholesome announcements Darling came in He stayed a little while, then cut one of Carlton's to deep point, where Trott caught him 4-0-203 Walter Giffm wosnext, and commented by off driving Carlton, showing some thing like IIIB old force on that side A burst of applause at a quarter to 1 told that George Giffen had got his hundred-and so far had not given the ghost of a change Walter was busy, hitting Carlton once to the fence at square leg in rare style, but failing in an attempt to repeat the stroke off the next ball Then he tried to drive ones put it upon the oil, unit Maplestone, running in, took the catch, gathering it in with the air of a man who wanted it to keen Rarely has a catch been more loudly cheered, and the team almost to a roan shook hands with their erring comrade, who had even thus late made atonement for his misdeeds The fifth wicket fell at 218, und Trid Jarvis was next man As soon as he came in Trott took the ball, and Jarvis lifted out over Carlton's head lit drove a number of them very) nicely, however The Store at the 4 o'clock adjournment was 221) On coming back Trott gave harry the ball, and the change was a lucky one, for the first ball clean bowled Tunis, and the brisk little Bhnmnntookhiaplace Only aamglthadbeen made when Giffen tried to glance Harry to leg missed it and was clean bowled, a bout for which Hurry got a storm of applause, that batsman a similar compliment a minute later Ula 103 was an exhibition of that patent, correct batting at which, on Australian wickets he is a master The seventh wicket fell at 227 Although Worrall s hands had been south knocked about with the cannon shots he had stopped, he still continued to save nine by his untiring fielding at mid-off Trott went on himself, as neither Blinman nor Haldane had shaped will against him in the first innings, the store being then 231 Haldane hit his first beautifully to long leg for 4, Stuckey trying hard to stop it, while in the same over Lewis appealed for stumping, but did not get it, and Harry made a heroic attempt to break Blinman a defence with an insidious grubber Haldane was playing Trott better this time-one hard hit to the fence at square leg being a sweet one In stay tug at home to them he was not happy, but any thing outside the leg was punished Blinman, with an on hit brought 200 up soon after he sent lorry travelling to the fence at long leg and the play was now altogether more attractive Haldane tried to punish another of trusts lig balls but it curled up in the Slips an I was easily held by Bruce making eight down for 252 and Victoiuvs outlook improving Parkin was just getting busy when he chopped one to the on and Maplestone running- in just got his hands under it in time nine for 263 As soon as Jones came the field cleared out into the country. He lifted one of Trots high to long on, but Laver mia judged the catch, which went over his head for -J Jones next tried it on the other side, Walters saving the fourth run there was no suggestion of the novice about Jones's batting but he didn't like flurry, and one in the next over cleaned bowled him Blinman carried on this but for 15 and the innings closed for 281, much fewer than the Victorians were at one time we illing to give The fielding was an improvement on the first innings, Lewis again allowing only a single bye for the innings Urara s bowling was largely responsible for the sudden close to what at one time looked like a long innings, and he was loudly cheered when with the promptitude noticeable all through the match the bowling averages were put on the board before the best player had left the field There was no luck about Marry a performance either for three of his wickets were clean bowled MLeoda figure it will be noticed, also read particularly well, and it was surprised to find that Trott had been so costly J W alters and Stuckey opened Victoria s second innings with 77 runs to make The bowlers were Jones and Fred Jarvis, as in the first innings, and both batsmen played quietly the light having been bad for the last hour or so Walters after back cutting one almost ran himself out, for he was some yards up the wicket when the ball was returned, but Jones failed to take it and he alters got back In backing up he tempted Walter Giffen to a shot at the wicket, and 3 went to Stuckey for the (overthrow In spite of Walters narrow escape they missed few chances of running but the first break came for too early for Victoria Stuckey tried to draw one of Jones's to leg and was bowled with a ball that glanced lightly from his paddock for 17 Worrall, who came next, had only time to get a single by a leg glance when stumps were drawn, leaving the Victorians a task ahead which even their warmest friends think they cannot accomplish with last use of the wicket Gillen wished to begin play at 11 today, and Trott would have done so but for the fact that rain was threatening and it might be detrimental to the interests of his side The scores now stand - SOUTH AUSTRALIA First Innings s 272 HK-0*sD IM-.1M18 J J Lyons b O M Lewis M 15 A li Jarvis c Carlton b Trott . , (14 0 Giffen, b Harry . 161 J Reedman c Bruce b Carlton .
