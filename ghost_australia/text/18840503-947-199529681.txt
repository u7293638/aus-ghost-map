. ?';???} ECHOES OP MELBOURNE '-...?I j:-....: (By The Ghost.) ?'?'? ? The Ministry, having postponed the in evitable' until the latest possible moment/ have at ldst set to work in earnest, and are now holding Cabinet meetings four times a week to prepare the measures to be sub mitted to Parliament in June. So busily do the members of the Government profess to be at work that not even one of their number could afford the time to attend the Eight Hours Demonstration and show Perhaps they realise the faft that the aforesaid working man stands in very little need of any one's sympathy, and that lie is in reality, in Yictoria, the mastor of the situation. In no other country 'under the wide canopy of Heaven ' could the demonstration held on Monday last be equalled. It was indeed the celebration of the triumph of labour. The only little drawback to its entire and unqualified success was its incompleteness. A close observer might. have remarked the absence of one or two classes of 'labourers.'

They have, by ' a considerable majority, agreed to uphold the present act in its integrity, to ? ignore entirely ' the Catholic grievance,' and not. to offend the democratic sentiments 'of the community by allowing . separate schools for the ' gutter children,' in a country where Jack is not only as good as his mas ter, but a trifle better. The draft report; compiled by Mr. .Rogers, Q.C.; contained, recommendations entirely at variance with . those which have been adopted. But 'the. chairman is at present away in Tasmania,: more profitably engaged than he would.be in defending his own opinions here/ and- therefore,1 perhaps, caring little that; his case affords yet one more exemplification of, the 'truth of the saying that avers that ','.

The anniversary of her Majesty's natal day will coriieround before Sir Henry Loch reaches our shores. Will the Acting-Governor feel called upon to entertain her liege subjects in Victoria while only receiving half the salary attaching to the vice-regal dignity ?

In a few days, perhaps, the claims foi' damages will begin to come ' in; and tlienthe extent of the injury suffered' well be ' 'known. For it is a somewhat extraordinary fact in connection with raili way statistics that trains to which mishaps occur always carry a large number of pas sengers, arid' this, although comparatively few tickets are issued.
