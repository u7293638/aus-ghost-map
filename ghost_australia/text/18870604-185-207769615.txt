SELECTED POETRY. CHORAL HYMN TO THE BLESSED TRINITY. The following hymn, composed by the Bis hop of Ballarat, was sung at the opening of the Adelaide Cathedral Organ:— f 1. Triune God! Thy praise to sing ‘ Every voice conspire for ever, Ci-cs. Nature all her music bring, Art of man her best endeavor; jf Every Height its anthem wake, \- Every Deep its answer make ! 2\. All the Earth doth worship Thee, m f " Lord of laud, and air, and ocean; ‘ With bowed head and bendiugkuee, Symbol of the heart’s devotion, All Thy Church glad homage pays, f Lifting high the note of praise. f Unto Thee, in loud refrain, J ' Lo the full-toned Choir rejoices, And the Organ lifts amain All her multitude of voices : n Ah ! what rapture ’tis to sing In Thy praise, Eterual King ! h 4. 0 that, as the inbreath’d wind Thrills dull pipes to sounds of sweetness, Silent hearts a voice might find— All our souls be tuued'to meet ness For the heaven-taught song they pour In Thy presence evermore ! 5, LMitl Thy glory, far above Yonder sky that arches o’er us, Seraphs, fired with sinless love, Chant in never-ceasing chorus, dokc Thau the harp more tuneful far, fi Louder than Thy thunders are ! era. ti. Higher yet one strain shall rise— Dearer to the Ear of Heaven— Thro’ the concert of the skies, Pierce the songs of the Forgiven; if And the Saved shout louder praise E’en than Angels’ skill to raise! y, 7. Holy, Holy, Holy Lord ! Thou V\ ho all from nothing spakest; Thou Whose blood for man was poured: Who dead souls to life awakest; if In thy Name is all our boast, Father, Sou, and Holy Ghost! Amen.
