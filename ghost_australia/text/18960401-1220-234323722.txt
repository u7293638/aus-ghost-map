The Floral Wonder of Panama. w The Holy Ghost flower, or Flor del Espiritu Santo, is found in the region of the Isthmus of Panama. It seems to thrive on low, marshy, spots, and springs up from decayed logs, or from crevices in the rocks. The larger and older bulbs frequently send up the leaf stalks six or seven feet in height and from these, which are joined, broad lanee- olated leaves are thrown out in pairs. The plant is , an annual, and in June, July and August the flower stalks start up from the base of the bulb, devoting all their energies to the formation of the buds. The buds are arranged on the stalks much like those of the hyacinth, the usual number for a well-grown stalk being from twelve to fifteen. The leaves are very pale green in color, as though in harmony with the delicate purity of the blossom. The blossom is of alabaster whiteness, much like the old- style English pulpit. This, of itself is strikingly curious, but it fades into insignificance when one looks into the centre of that strange blossom, for there, nestling in its very heart, is the very image .of a dove. It requires no imagina tion to see it. No one could mistake it for anything else, for no human skill could fashion its shape more per fectly, no artist could adorn it with more delicate tints, and i no perfumer could endow it with a more delicate fragrance. Right in the cup of the blos som, with the snow white canopy about it, rests this wondrous image, its delicately moulded wings drooping, half extended at its sides, its gold- tinted head bent slightly for ward, and its tiny, crimson- tipped bill almost touching its snowy breast. An observer who saw it in its native home, says : 44 Just as the figure of trie dove itself is there, beyond dispute, so does an expression pervade the image, an expres sion that even the most care less cannot fail to notice, the incarnation of humility and spiritual purity."
