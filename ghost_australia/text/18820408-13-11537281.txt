THE ZOOLOGICAL AND ACCLIMATISATION SOCIETY. The new policy adopted by the Acclimatisation Society is one which must prove very satisfactory to the public. The Government having at length given leave to make a small charge at the gates of all days of the week excepting Sunday, the society have resolved to endeavour to make the gardens worthy of the colony, and to give the public a eight really worth seeing for their money. They intend to procure from time to time, as their finances permit them, batches of newauitnals from foreign countries, and these animals will form over new attractions to the pretty gardens The society contemplates shortly sending to New Zealand for the many curious specimens of birds indigenous to that country and unknown in any other. The Indian animals which have already arrived may be looked on as the forerunners of others to come, for the fauna of India are notoriously very numerous and varied Those that have already arrived are singularly good specimens of their kind, and a short description of the habits of some of them may prove interesting to our untravelled readers the two specimens of the fields are the Bengal tiger Delis 'Itgria), and the Chair cat (Chase, Lybdcnsoi I elis Loans) The tiger is found through all India, from Cape Comorin to the Himalayas, and even on hills as high as 7,000ft It commonly prefers to haunt forests and jungles, only visiting the open country when in search of its prey The average size of a full grown male tiger is from 9ft to 'J' ft in length, and though in India " tiger stones ' are as common as snake stories in Australia, and tigers there are mentioned as attaining lengths only equalled by our snakes when described by imaginative snake killers, yet no good ground appears to exist for supposing that they do attain a greater length than that mentioned They are naturally cowardly, skulking animals, and fight only when driven to bay or when wounded A tiger will kill a cow about once a week so that his destructiveness will be seen to be very great Vi here once a tiger takes to killing man he cares for nothing else than human flesh, and man staying tigers will risk much in quest of their favourite food in the Nundah district, east of Jabbulpore, in 1859 and previous years, on an average two or three hundred villagers were killed yearly. Mr Vv ood alleges that a tigress has been known to cross with the lion, this was when animals were in captivity, but the young by brida died before reaching maturity The next specimen of the same family as the Chains, or common jungle cat of India This is also common all over India, and frequents both jungles and the open country It is extremely destructive to game and poultry. It crosses freely with the domestic cat In its shape and movements, it curiously resembles the tiger The specimens of Indian Bimi o are the so called "Entellua monkeys Press butin entitles) the common name of these in Bengal and Central India is " Large, or Hunumtn (long jaw) these monkeys are 1 very common from the right bank of the Ganges to Central India They sometimes enter towns in troops and plunder the grain i shops, for the Hindoos regard it OR sacrilege to kill them, 'The natives suppose that the bodies of these animals are the receptacles of human BOUIB which have nearly reached perfection, and thus to insult or kill a Hunumin is as much sacrilege as to offer violence to a member of a Royal family These monkeys are known and respected as great snake killers, they are specially clever of catching these reptiles when coiled up among the branches of trees The Mangoes (fferpestes Gris IS) belongs to the class of Riverina, and is a most interesting and most useful animal It is something like a ferret in shape, but its hair is of an iron grey colour, and its movements are more active than those of a ferret It is very destructive to poultry and rabbits, and it is believed that were a few of these animals liberated in a spot infested with rabbits that the latter pests would soon diminish in number, It is the sworn foe of rats, I birds, and small snakes It is commonly I believed in India that it has a natural I aversion to serpents of every kind, and that after being bitten by one it retires into the woods, and neutralises the poison by eating of some particular herb Many experiments have been made to attest its immunity from the poisonous bite of the cobra , it is certain that the mongoose generally koala the cobra, but it is also asserted that it avoids being bitten merely by its superior activity These little animals become very tame, and follow their owners about like dogs The two Bengal porcupines ( thyself i n crus tales) are very fine ii -women of their class The extraordinary natural armoury with which nature has provided these animals in their main point of interest They were for merly fabled to shoot these out at their enemies with fatal precision, but though they cannot do this, yet they can and do use these quills as defensive weapons when attacked, charging backwards at their face, and not unfrequently inflicting serious injury upon dogs or other assailants Even tigers have been killed with portions of the spine of a porcupine embedded in their body Porcupines live, like rabbits, in burrows in the sides of hills, and are fond of frequenting old runs The flesh is good eating, being white, and resembling delicate pork Iwo Himalayan black bears enrich our scanty collection of urBidu Their scientific name is Units Ubclanus, but Mr Wood seems wrong in saying that the country inhabited by this bear is manifest by its name, for as a matter of fact these bears are rare in Thibet, and are most common on the Himalayas In summer these animals mount to a considerable height, as high as the bottom of the snow line, in winter they descend to an elevation of about 5000ft Their chief food is fruit, roots, and grain Quiet and in offensive as they usually ore, these bears, if brought to bay will show fight in a most determined way, always attacking and mauling the face of their opponent It is said that there are few villages in the interior where some natives BO mutilated are not to be seen. the large Indian squirrel Malurus avenue,) IS what is sometimes called the scores bicolor, from the dark brown hue which is usually found to characterise its back, the sides and belly being of a golden yellow. But the colour varies much in various specimens It is found in the S E Himalayas, Nepal, and bikini Its native name is the Jelerang It is easily tamed, and is very amusing in its habits. its flesh is eaten by the natives of the countries which it inhabits, and is stated to be very delicate. the Blow lons (Ni/cticebus can dig) adus) belongs to the very interesting group of the demands, which forms the link between the monkeys and the quadrupeds proper the head of the demands is more pointed and fox like than that of the monkey s and their method of progression would lead one to place them among the true quadrupeds The word lemur means a night-walking ghost in Latin, and was applied to this group by scientific men on account of their nocturnal habits and their Stealthy and silent mode of progression. The native name of the slow long as the taking It is only found in the East of Bengal, Bungporo, Dacca, and the adjacent parts Its food is mostly the leaves of the trees which it fre quests, but it will also eat insects and, it is said, small birds. Mr Wood remarks upon the strange way in which the arteries and veins are grouped in the limbs of these animals In most animals one large trunk vessel enters the limb, and then branches off into a reticulation of numerous small channels in the Iona the arteries and veins as they enter the limb are divided into a quantity of cylindrical vessels lying close to each other for some distance, and giving off their tubes to different parts of the limb Sir W. Tones, quoted by Mr Verdon, gives an interesting account of one kept in captivity by him. It kept head downwards suspended by the hooked claw of the thumb of the hind feet We reserve our noted on the Indian, bids for a future occasion.
