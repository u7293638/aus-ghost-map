A CURIOUS STORY. In the last number of tho China Overland Mail, wc find the following : — A curious story is in circulation amongst the Chinese— curious, as it relates to the alleged appearance of tho murdered man's spirit asking for re- dress. Somo time ago a junk sailed mini Iloifoong, containing a number of coolies for the barracoons of 'Macao. Having arrived there, the live cargo was quickly disposed of, anil the captain received us freight some thing over 1000 dollars. This incited the helmsman and some of the crew to league themselves with two piratical junks to at tack tlio boat anil to roll the captain of the money. Two or three days sineo the junk left Macao, going hack to Hoifoong. On the way, near CTiang Chow, the two pirates hove in sight, and tlic helmsman steered close up to them, when the pirates hoarded the junk, killed the captain and threw liim overboard. Hero comes the mysterious part of the story. The master ol' tho Lnk Kee barra- coon dreamed a ill-cam, in which he saw the ghost of the murdered man before him, say ing ho hail been murdered, that ho was robbed of liis money, and that lie wished tlie liarraqoou master to complain nnd try to obtain redress for liim, which lie thought would not be difficult, as tlic pirates were sailing off Chang Chow. On the strength of this ilrcam, the harracoon master complained to tho Portuguese authdritios, who sent out a gunboat, and tlie pirates wore found at the spot indicated by tlie ghost. 1 1 is said that tho ei'ow of tho attacked junk (who had come to Hong Kotig sinco the robbery) had gone over to Macao ; ono of them was the brother of the deceased, nnd had been cut in several places. Whether there is any truth in the statement of tile appearance of tlie ghost or not, . the facts of the robbery and capture are correct.
