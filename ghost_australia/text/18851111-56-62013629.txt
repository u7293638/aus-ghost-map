MUDGEE. (Post.) CAL MINING AT TONG BONG.— It is in con- templation, by Mr. W. Wilkins and party, to open at once a tunnel on Mr. V. Dowling's ground at Tong Bong in order to prove the existence of a seam of coal, of whose presence in that place there are some very strong indica tions. Should the seam prove equal to expec tations, it will be worked without delay, and thus a very profitable industry will be estab lished almost at our very doors, and a great impetus will be given to mining enterprise in the district. THE VOLUNTEERS.— Staff-Sergeant Berkeley, of the 1st Regiment of Volunteer Infantry, is at present in Mudgee. He has been sent here to drill the recruits, and to aid in bringing the company to the highest possible state of effici ency. Sergeant Berkeley drills the recruits four nights a week, instructs the noncommis sioned officers one night, and drills the company on the regular parades. Sergeant Berkeley will probably remain in Mudgee till after the yearly inspection by the Commandant of the Forces, A GHOST.— A young gentleman of meek manners and mild disposition was considerably startled the other evening. He was taking a walk near the Presbyterian Cemetery, when he was horrified by a sudden apparition that fairly took his breath away. The awful form seemed to him to be more than eight feet high, and to have the visage and vestments of a minister. The young man did not stop to investigate this phenomenon scientifically, but took to his heels and arrived at his residence pale, breathless, and awe-struck. He was still more put out when he found that his ghost story was dis credited, and he himself laughed at for having been ' had.' It seems practical joking has not died even though the times are so bad.
