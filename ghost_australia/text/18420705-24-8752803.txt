THE LEARN EVERYTHING YOUNG LADY. Many a tear has been shed over " The Sorrows of Werter, many a sigh breathed for " The Sorrows of Rosalie ;" never having met with either of these dismally sounding productions, I cannot, of course, presume to decide on their capabilities for exciting the "melting mood;" but of one thing I am sure their griefs, whatever they may have been must fall short of mine. I am an only daughter. My parents, long before I was born, determined that I should be what I think is best defined by the expression of " a learn- everything young lady. In pursuance of their scheme, I was named Aspasia. My father would have preferred Corinne, but my mother asked Aspasia better Land, after a sharp dispute, during which my mother looked like Xantippe, I became As- pasia. Alas ! when and where shall I find a Pericles ! 'Tis true, that the mayor of a small French country town, where I once resided, piqued himself on resembling him but, though he did cut down all the trees, build a new meat market, paint the gates of the public gardens scarlet, mend the roads till they were impassable, set up monuments to the " memory of nobody," and triumphal arches of roses and ribands, and speeches the money out of our own pockets, yet I could never see the likeness. To return-my father, who is " a very clever man," took me in hand as soon as I could repeat " The Beggar's Petition and " the multiplication table;" tell what England is bounded by describe how Henry VIII. killed his wives and work that horrid sum " a privateer of two hundred and fifty men took a prize," me. (how fervently I used to wish they never had taken one, or that it had been empty all which accomplishments I owed to my mother. Under his care, I was instructed in navigation, which, he said, would be " very useful ;" and Algebra-" absolutely necessary for keeping household accounts, and making out washing bills ;" " dialling," that I might spend a month making something to tell the hour by, instead of looking at the time piece on the table ; geometry, trigonometry, and comic sections (in the course of which everything in the house, including mamma's stock of winter oranges, was cut into pyra- j aids and parabolas) ; a little gunnery and fortification (2 most particularly useful") ; fractions and decimals, and the cube root ! and prospective and the use of the globes and mapping, and astronomy, and, I think, J that's all and then back I went to mamma, I and a whole synod of masters and gover- i nesses. They taught me compassionate reader seven languages ร Does it not make you shudder ? Yes ; seven languages were actually dinned into my poor unfortunate head, by as many professors. Oh ! the agonies of Greek verbs and Latin cases " his lines, fuel"-" dominus, domini, domino a" German genders, where young women are neuter and French genders, where a whole army of dark desperadoes are feminine (and a soldier on duty is feminine, too, till his ยก guard is over, and then, I suppose, he is masculine again). The Italian abbrevia- tions, where two letters stand for fifty others, and the Spanish 6's and 5's which spoiled my face and pushed my front teeth ' out of their places. Pause here awhile, kind reader, and drop a tear ; but do not linger greater sorrows are yet to be recorded. My mother decided that I had a great genius for music, and a striking talent for drawing and at this moment, I draw in pencil, India ink, sepia, paint in oils and water-colours, and each play the harp, piano-forte, and guitar, and have taken lessons in thorough bass and the key bugle ! When I had arrived at this pitch of perfec- tion, my mother considered it was time I should be made useful. Accordingly, I was initiated into the mysteries of sewing and felling-whipping and gathering, &c.; The cook taught me to make pies the chaffeur to dress hair, an embroideries to flourish, a washerwoman to small-plait, a milliner to make flowers and nothing but a sudden and inevitable change of residence saved me from learning to manufacture baskets, fish trout, shoot sparrows, stuff birds, stick butterflies, and knit stockings. To add to all this, nature has endowed me with a propensity to scribble prosy rhyme, and rhyme prose-in fact, just what might be expected from a head where Homer floats in batter pudding, and music mixes with mathematics. Having then " this nice little point," my mother, of course, expects me to exercise it frequently. The consequence is, that it is only an additional misery. I have other employments, too, engrossing and ab- sorbing they engross paper, and absorb ink, but of them I will not speak now suf- fice it to say, they are public duties, and of the highest importance. Here I would again pause, to ask if my case be not one of heart-rending bitterness ; but the worst is yet to come ! Dear reader you doubtless imagine that all this was taught as such things usually are-care- lessly and slightly- forgotten as soon as acquired-passing over my mind as the light breezes of summer sweep over the calm bosom of a lake, leaving no trace of their rapid passage, when the momentary ripple was subsided. Oh, that it were so ; but, alas ! it is far otherwise. Before I conclude, I will give you an idea of our usual conversation, and a " sketchy view of my dismal employments. At breakfast, my father asks if I have " looked at my navigation lately;" fears I shall forget my fortification ; asks now if the beef were a fort, and the chocolate the enemy, how I would commence the attack and arranges the lumps of sugar like cannon balls in a barrack yard, and makes me tell him " the contents by proper rule. Mamma hopes I shall not forget my German; fears I am too much fascinated by the Italian ; begs I will remember my Greek ode ; inquiries after my Latin translation ; desires I will practise the first thing, or thinks I had better paint ; requests that I will not allow the pudding to slip my memory ; brings mc my stockings to mend ; gives me a particular list of all the types that are off and buttons " absent without leave ;" and puts a " broad" (as they say in the navy for ragged, against the names of everything in my wardrobe ! Well, the day wears on; I do first one thing, and then another; my mother always follows me, and repeating what yet remains to be achieved. Visitors come, and dinner comes, and the pudding does not come, and then scolding comes, and an anathema is pronounced against the Greek and the mathematics, by mamma, and a hint is thrown out against the stitching and hemming, by papa and all is confusion. Night comes at last, and I retire, after washing out, like Lady Macbeth, " the spots" (I omit her expletive) of ink, and paint, and earth-for I garden and study botany occasionally, to act over again in my sleep the deeds of the day to fight with Schiller's ghosts or Ho- mer's heroes, or fancy myself a second edi- tion of the *' Prometheus Vinctus." I have said enough ; such a tale needs no comment. I would not impair its simple truth by a single figure of speech. It must awaken the sympathies of many unfortunates of roy tribe, and perhaps touch the hearts of some mothers who have, hitherto resembled mine. It is an, appeal from the " learn everything young ladies," mental factory children of the nineteenth century, to the people of England. I trust it will be heard and answered New Monthly.
