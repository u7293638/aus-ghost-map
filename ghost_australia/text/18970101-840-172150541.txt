' Federal Spirit. " " Ono of tlio Melbourne newspapers is in a bud way- over tbe luck', of .a federal spirit in Australia. It wo ufd . appear from tlio jeremiads poured out by tluH, paper that no ono but . itself bus .the, federal spirit. If tliis " is tbe ease, ' why further trouble 'about fo.ioriition ? V Even tho ghost of poor old Pardee, would bo disturbed could it hear the things now said of him. It is 'charged against him that with all his efforts in rogurd to federation lie never imido tho slightest attempt to put tho consti tution of 1891 before tho Parliament of New South Wales. Quite right: he did not. Within a year after the pusaing of that con stitution by the convention ho moved, 110 doubt at the instance of Viutovln, that the people elenfc a convention, and that thut convention nbould frarno a constitution to be accepted by tho people. This was a short and easy method with auti-fcdcrationists. Our Sir Hugh Nelson is vmy roughly handled. He should feel' vory bud on rending whut is suid of him. But Ben jamih'i? mess of abuse is reserved for Mr. Reid, who has been 44 the most cynical in his anti-federal spirit." Tho curso pronounced on him is becauso ho passed a frcotrado tariff for Now South Wales whon ho know that federation would como first, a reformed tariff afterwards, and that tliut roformcd tariff would b.) the present tariff of Viotoria. Mr. Kingston, Premior of South Australia, 44 is but ono whit more sincere " (tho othor man is said not to bo sincero at ull), and Sir .John Forrest, of West Australia, is nearly, if not quite as bad as the Premier of Quecnslund. An example parallel to this may bo found in the old lady who was nob quito sure of tlio orthodoxy of uny ono siivo herself and her husband, und sho had her doubts about John.
