COMM EUC IA L INTELLIGENCE. The Argus Office, Tuesday Evening. In resuming for 1888 our periodical statements of the statistical position of bread stuffs, we have taken for a basis the revised estimates of the population of the colony publisher! by the Rev. eminent statist. Assuming that the increase will be at least as great as during the past year, the population on the 30th June next will be about 1,053,000, which number we take as the average for the year. As regards the population of Melbourne and its suburbs, who arrived by a similar process at 10,000 As the railway returns also include deliveries to Geelong, we add the population of that town (say 15,000) to that of Melbourne in order to get at the local consumption. Upon these data, therefore, we estimate consumption for 1888 as follows Average population of the colony for the year, l,03r>,000, nt BJ bushels per head, ¡3,b02,fiO0 bushels , average population of Melbourne and suburbs and Geelong for the year, of 4.11,000, tit 52 bushels per head, 2,370,500 bushels. The weekly averages are 111,000 bushels and 10,000 bushels respectively Our stocks and surplus of breadstuffs are therefore shown in the following tabulated form : Dara lintels Total h flour and was received at Melbourne and Port Melbourne. Williamstown, and Geelong to - .... Wheat received during the fortnight ending Jan. 14 Flour do. Consumption, J weeks, at 40,000 bushels per week . Shipments of wheat and flour to - ....

The estimated total available for shipment in time 190, 181 tons It should, be remarked that by Vin A ustr alaman considers that its estimate the minimum, and that it may thing the quantity named may be exceeded. At the commencement of another export season in breadstuffs, a glance at one or two altered conditions is necessary. In 1886 and 1887, owing to the short harvests of South Australia, Victorian (lourgaincda leading posi- lion in the markets of the northern colonies, New South Wales, and Queensland. But owing to the large South Australian export- able surplus this season, and the lower prices ruling in Adelaide than in Melbourne, the intercolonial trade is again being largely diverted to the former place. Another factor in the situation is supplied by the opening of two (flour mills in Sydney under Melbourne proprietorship These mills would take their supplies from Victoria, but the disparity of prices to which we have alluded has led to small milling vessels being engaged to carry a light from the outports of South Australia to Sydney Another point is that formerly South Australia, Bent trom 40,000 to 50 3000 tons of breadstuffs to South Africa annually, but this outlet has dwindled away until it has become almost insignificant Indian wheat has in fact, largely supplanted Australian wheat in that quarter of the world Such a limitation of the avenues for disposing of a surplus unfavourably n fleets the prospects of shippers, who, apart from the intercolonial trade, have practically only the British m tickets to look to We have, however, heard of a small vessel being taken up to carry wheat from South Australia to Natal 'The freight market is still uncertain, owing to the fact that in nearly every in stance the engagement has to be effected in London, if that has not already been done before the arrival here of the vessel The Dumbarton has been chartered with the option of loading at a South Australian port and unless Victorian wheat is obtainable at a shipping value we understand that the option will be released Negotiations are, we believe, pending with regard to another vessel, but shippers are acting with deliberation In addition to low prices and high freights, wheat farmers are also placed at a disadvantage by having to give 2d. per dozen more for their Backs this year the in last the lillie rence being represented by 3d per bushel On the other hand, liberal banking facilities are being extended to them on easier terms than usual The wheat market is at present man is certain and rather obscure state, the relative positions of farmers, grain merchants, brokers, and shippers not yet having been clearly defined Nearly all of the wheat now arriving has been already contracted for, so that little is coming into the open market A few small sales have been made at 3s 4d and one at 3s 4d , but at these prices shippers are not operating 'the demand for Hour has been good, and amongst trade Bales we have heard of a parcel of old being quitted at ii, while for 100 tons roller made £9 7s 6d job has been paid for export YY ith respect to barley, it is generally stated that it is all more or less dis coloured this season Malting has been sold at an improved price, 200 bags realising Is 73, but the large receipts of Cape barley have depressed the market, and sales have been made at 2s 9d to 2s 11d Oats are again firmer, with a good demand 'to arrive per next New Zealand steamer, 1,100 bags have been sold at 2s. 11 3d to 3s, and 350 bags at 2s 10d in bond for export.

The forty-seventh annual report, as at 30th September last, of the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company states that the net surplus for the year, including £1,101 brought forward, amounts to £17.1,082, which, after deducting the interim dividend of 2½ percent, pill in June last, admits of a further dividend at the same rate, a balance of £7,2 being carried forward to next year. The report refers to the building of four new steamers of upwards of 6000 tons each, of which the Victoria has made her first passage to Bombay, and the Britannia to Australia. The Oceana will follow the Britannia, and will be succeeded by the Arcadia The distance run by the company's steamers for the ji or has been 2,31 637 miles The wreck of the Tasmania has entailed a loss on the underwriting account of £127,711 but a bonus of percent has been paid to shareholders from the suspense account The report immoderately Hopeful as regards freight prospects Air William Duthie reports the sale of the ketch Windward for £305 to Mr S R Groom, who purchased on behalf of Mr T.
