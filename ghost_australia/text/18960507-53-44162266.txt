The B. H. J. C. Baces. At the Autumn , Meeting of the B. H. J. 0. yesterday the office-bearers were'as follow:-Judge, Mr.% P^n-. rose; starter, Mr. F. E. Bromley; clerk of the course, Mr. J. C. Massey; clerk of the Beales, Mr. J. P.; Megaw ; timekeeper, Mr. J. C. Kleinnammer; handicapper, Mr. A. J, Hall ; secre- tary,' Mr. J. Souter. ThVmeetjng could notbe considered a success in^anjr sense, as the'attend-: ance was small, the starters in no race .exceeded threes and there was "only one really good finish during the after- noon. It would appear that efforts on the part of the club to cater for the patronage of South Australian owners must always .be .fruitless;, yet the observation was made by a prominent sportsman the other day that he knew of 14 horses that most probably would have visited the Barrier had the fact been made known that other meetings were likely to be held here and at the river townships. The success of any 'meeting ' is "invariably commensurate' with the amount of zeal expended1 upon it by the managers. The racing calls for little observation beyond what has already appeared in the' MINBB. Donald Haydn's ; double win wis very popular. He carried off the Hurdle Race with Ghost, and the nexb event-the Autumn Handicap with Eaglehawk. Haydn is an un- tiring trainer, and withal a very decent fellow. Mr. George Miller was very pleased when Eaglehawk so meritori- ously " downed" Coorie in the Autumn Handicap. He bred the old gelding (who is by Wandearah) at Redan. Fairy was disqualified in the Welter Race through his owner having ridden at a pony meeting, notwithstanding that it was as an amateur. Fairy is very fleet. The Bib Lady, with little *% Freddie" Bromley, up, covered herself with glory by defeating Fairfield in the; Flying- - Handicap.' The chestnut came, too late, and was beaten by a bare length. The pony's performance was exceedingly brilliant, as the six furlongs was covered in '22Â£.
