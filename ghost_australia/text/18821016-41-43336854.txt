SPORTING. VICTORIA AMATEUR TURF CLUB MEETING.,- ' Second Dav. FBy Teleerai)h.l [From our «wn Reporter.] ' Melbourne, October 15. A lfcht rain fell on Saturday morning- and continued np to 12 o'clock, when the clouds cleared off and the sun shone, and ultimately fnr Ihe r*»«f nf fhl* Auv Mia ^iffnronf. miila *y\ Laulheld were lined with traps up to tho Lour of starting the first race. At the time the Cup was run there must have been 8.0D5 persons present, which ia far ihe largest attendance ever known on this course. Tho rain served to lay the dust on the round, but after thefirstracetheruuning ground was very much cut up, and in the Cup the horses were lost in a cloud of dust from the time they passed the Stand until they got to the top of the hill. The racing throughout the day was first class, but it was a disastrous afternoon for backers, as Little Jack was not mentioned until late on Friday night ; and as the stable did not touch him o:i the course, he was driven back to 100 to C, and the public little thought that he was to figure in the light of a winner. The Assvnan's running was too bad to be correct. He was unlucky in getting a bad position at the start, and alter passing the Stand with about twenty horses in front of him he never seemed to be able to get through the crowd. Sportsman was made favourite in ' a field of fourteen for ? the Hurdle' Race, but there *vas a strong following behind Lord of Clyde, and he went to the front and stayed there to the end. P'ighteeri runners were telegraphed for the Nursery Handicap, ? and Mr. Savill supplied a' favourite in Delusion. The Caultield filly. Duenna, a very nice youngster, was also at 100 to C, and the pair fought it out from start to finish. It was one of the bestridden races I have ever seen, and Yeoman's just nicked a verdict bv a head in the last half dozen strides. With this evidence of the stable being in form the Assyrian, shortened to 4 to 1 when the ring was formed to the Cup. Little Jack after Slaving touched 10 to 1 in the morning was driven to a 100 to 6; but there were some very heavy outlays on Vtrdure and Frvingpan, both of whom touched 6 to 1 before the start. The lot were saddled and paraded the pad dock some time before the start, and nothing looked better than Darebin, Commotion, Assyrian, Verdure, Fryincpan, and Gipsy Cooper. Neither of the St. Albans pair came in for much attention, consequent upon tne report that the stable believed Mistaken to be the better of the pair. The preliminaries took some time, but Mr. Watson bad the thirty-two marshalled at the post in good time, and it was a splendid sight to see the lot spread out at the top of the straight running. Fryingpan, nho was in a very bad temper; broke away several times, and de-, laycd the start a few minutes,' but eventually they were sent on their jour-: nev on very fair terms. Dougalstou appeared to be the first to move, but as they came to the Stand Verdure was clear of everything, ? and was making the pace a cracker: while Darebin, Fryingpan, Calma, Tumult, Dougal-' ston and Flying Jib were in good places. Alter . rounding ihe turn Tumult made an effort to cut down the flying grey, but she shook him off with great ease, and continued to load from Calma, Flying Jib, Darcoin, and Fryingpan. At thc-u've- furlong post Calma' was trying his best to lead Verdure and Darebin, who had been galloped on and badly cut, and had given way to fc lying Jiband Fryingpan. These four we're at the head of aflairs on entering the straight, and as Verdure was in lrout when they became fairly in a line fnr home her name was - sounded on all sides as the winner, but at the distance Little Jack got clear of the crowd, and came with a wet sail. The boy ou Verdure was watching Calma on the whip hand, and not Beeing Little Jack,' he left his position on the rails and gave the latter a chance, which Moore im- : mediately availed himself of, and dash ing up on the inside he caught the mare, and won amid tremendous excite ment bv half a length. Had Sheehan not' made the mistake mentioned Little Jack: might not have won, as there was no room. for him to get past on the outside at the time . he made his run. Calma, Fryingpan, and Baron Von Mueller were just at tho heels of ' Gipsy Cooper, and then came Gudarz, Cdor- ' cena, and Prattle. The favourite, after getting off badly and being knocked out of '- his stride in a collision, never seemed to get ; going, and he was not in the hunt at any part of the race. The victory was very quietly received, and the' St. Albans party are reported to have woa ; only & trifling stake on the race. Had Verdure won the ring would, have lost, heavily, but as it was they won to a man, ' and taken all through the meeting has been ' a lad one for backers. As a race the Findon Harriers' Cup was a farce. Of the twenty-\ four starters .all were out of it but four when half a mile had been traversed, and ! the Melbourne amateur ridera are, with : a few exceptions, quite out of placa in a (steeplechase. rThe Open Steeplechase was a grand race. Napoleon, the favourite, refused repeatedly; but a party of six or eight were in close company, and jumped grandly to the. finiih. Erin looked like winning after they got over the last fence, but he and Colling wood tired to nothing at the finish.and Sailor,., who was very badly ridden by a mere lad,, camein the last hundred yards, and woneasily by a length. When the betting opened on ? the Windsor Handicap 3 to 1 was offered on the field, but directly a move was made on. Prometheus the ring drew in their horns, and it was difficult to get 5 to 4 at the finish*. Saionara, Trevellyan, and Gasalier were all' ? supported, but they had no chance with th& brilliant Eon of Lunine, who jumped away in front and was never caught.

Passing the Stand Verdure led, closely followed by Tumult, Dongalston, Frrinepari, and Daxebin, the abso lutely last at this tune being Lord Burghley.

Entering the straight Calma was done, and Verdure looked all over a winner, her nearest attendants at the distance being Calma, Gipsy Cooper, and Little Jack, with Baron Ton Mueller and Gudarz nest. Verdure continued to lead until 100 yards from home, when the boy polled out from the rails, and Little Jack with a rush jost caught her, and won by half a length ; two lengths off Gipsy Cooper was third, and then came Calma, Fryingpan, and Baron von Mueller very close together, with Flying Jib and Mistaken at the head of the ruck.

The lot came at a great pace to the first fence, over which Breechloader acted as pioneer for Hands Down, Barcoo, and Sailor, the lot being whipped-in by Napoleon, who baulked after jump ing the hedge. Breechloader, Barcoo, and Hands Down went on with the running, Abdallah, Colling wood, and Sailor lying next ; and the only incident in the position round waa the falling of KmihVh and the disappearance of Stag, who baulked re peatedly. Coming to the treble, in front of the Stand, Barcoo was showing the way from Hands Down, Abdallah, Erin, Colhngwood, and Sailor, in the order named, bnt after rounding the turn Abdallah went to the head of affairs. On the far side of the course he, however, struck heavily and gave place to Erin and Collingwood, who went on stride for stride, with Barcoo, Abdallah, and Sailor close up, and Chrysalis rapidly making her way to the front At the last fence Erin and Col lingwood rose together, and then came Chrysalis, Barcoo, and Sailor, while Euchre and Abdallah were alsolclose np. Erin was the first to get into the straight and from this out a grand race took place place between Sailor, Erin, Collingwood, Barcoo, and Chrysalis, but the light weight lasted the longest, and won by a length ; Enn beat Colling wood by a head for second place, and then came Barcoo, Euchre, Chrysalis, Hands Down, and Abdallah, there not being more than twenty lengths between the first eight WETDSOB HANDICAP.
