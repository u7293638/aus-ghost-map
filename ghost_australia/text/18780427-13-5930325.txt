SOUTH AUSTRALIA. (FROM OUR OWN OOBRESF0HD_fT.) ADELAIDE, APRIL 2. With the exception of one district that of Flinders-the returns from all the constituencies have come in, and out of the 46 members who constitute our new House of Assembly we are now familiar with 43 of them Of these 43 no less than 11 now enter Parliament for the first time, five have in years gone by aired their presence in the hall of legislation, but for one or more sessions have been absent therefrom , there I maining 27 maybe regarded as old stagers, many of whom have grown grey in the Service of their country The 16 new members may be classified thus Engaged in trade, 8 , squatters, 2, farmers, 2, lawyers, 2, newspaper men, 1, nondescript, 1 It cannot be expected that every one of the two score and odd men who are to represent us in the forthcoming Parliament is a Solon Indeed, some of them are the very reverse of wise, and an old politician, who is fond of epigrams, thus distinguishes these latter " There are, he says, " men of gigantic beards and small understanding, men of Herculean stature and Liliputian mind, and men who assume virtues which they do not possess ' I may add that it would have been more correct to use the singular instead of the plural number in describing the representative cs of each of the classes But despite this threefold drawback, the House allrounder superior to any House that has preceded it for the last 12 years in point of moral excellence, wealth, intelligence, and debating power Among, the new members there are three who, from their force of character and speak mg capabilities, are bound to come to the front I allude to Messrs Bundey, Downer, and Parsons, and I should not be at all surprised to see this very able trio forming and consolidating a distinctly new party in the House. The result of the elections has been to give Mr Boucaut s Ministry a large majority, in fact a dangerously large majority, which will need very careful statesmanship to avoid disaster I do not suppose the new Parliament will be summoned for the despatch of business until the end of May 'Die relation of South Australia to the river trade is attracting considerable attention just now It is a fortunate thing for the colony that Mr Boucaut, the Premier, is the representative of Goolwa, which is the outlet port of the Murray, and t e may rest assured that so far as he is concerned everything will be done to develop the traffic which we ought to have had in years gone by, and which with proper facilities we may even yet secure Goolwa is a long way behind Echuca in respect to the conveniences and appliances for loading and unloading cargoes of wool and other produce The wharf cannot accommodate more than three steamers at a time , the storage room is about a tithe of the amount required, the cranes are worked by handinstcadof by steam and the arrangements for the transit of goods between Goolwa and Port Victor, which is done by horse tramway, need con- siderable improvement The increase in the trade of Goolwa and Port Victor for the two places cannot be separated, as together they represent the one port for the river trade, owing to the difficulty of navigating the Murray mouth during the last four years has been something wonderful In 1874, the down trade was represented by about 7,000 bales of wool, this year, it will be four times that quantity The up trade has in creased even in larger proportion, the ship ments of goods for the up rivers being 10,000 tons this season, as compared with 1,500 tons in 1872 It is generally acknowleged that to Messrs W M'Culloch and Co (Limited) is due much of the impetus which has of late years been given to our share of the traffic of the great rivers which all find their outlet in South Australia They have certainly proved that that traffic is capable of expansion, and it now rests with our Parliament and our Government to foster it by wise legislation and liberal regulations We are in great hopes that upon the completion of the North West Bend Railway and the Victor Harbour break- water, South Australia will be able to more than double her present trade with the Rn cane districts 'The Rev S Green has not set the Torrens on fire by his demand for an alteration of the Constitution Act, so as to enable clergymen to enter Parliament if they so desire it With the exception of the public meeting which was carried captive by his fervid oratory and his brilliant sallies he has met with little outside sympathy His contention is too suggestive of the evils of priestcraft, and seeing that we have been free from these in the past, it is thought to be inexpedient to open the door for their entrance now At the recent meetings of the Congregational Union, Mr J Lee, an insignificant labour gave notice that he would at the next meeting of the Union bring the matter forward for consideration, but the general feeling among the intelligent members of the body is that it would be far better to let the ques tiondrop Agitation will lift it into prominence, while neglect will kill it The official statistics of our late cereal harvest have at length been published, but the gross results differ so slightly from the newspaper estimates formed two months ago that no change is likely to be effected in the markets The difference is on the right side for the colony, the actual surplus of bread stuffs for export based upon the Government returns being 160 000 tons, as against the 150,000 tons which was the computation of the unofficial authorities The area placed under wheat cultivation last year exceeded 1,100,000 acres, and from the vast quantities of land which have been selected, coupled with the present favourable ploughing and sowing season, there should be at least 1,300,000 acres reaped next year. The general average per acre was 7 bushels 46 , but some districts yielded over 13 bushels to the acre The total produce was 9,034,092 bushels, and of this 3,140,000 bushels are supposed to be required for seed and home consumption, thus leaving, as I have said, about 160 000 tons for the use of intercolonial and foreign markets According to present quotations this will represent a money value of close upon two millions sterling 'Die audited accounts of the last quarters revenue and expenditure have been published The total revenue reached £397,201, which is an increase upon the corresponding period of last year of £27,441 but the expenditure has more than kept pace with the augmented income, being £442,152, or £45,015 in excess of the amount spent in the first three months of 1877 For the nine months the receipts and expenditure were £1,100,89(5, and £1,107,187 respectuclj- afactwhich, without much argument should suggest the adoption of some means by vi Inch our revenue can be increased so as to meet our expenditure, or our expenses curtailed and kept within the limits of our income AA e have had a line fall of rain throughout the colony Squatters are now more anxious to buy than to sell sheep, farmers are busy ploughing and sow it and traders, both in town and country are cheerfully anticipating a prosperous season THERE has been a great scandal at Lucknow A Hindoo widow desired to embrace the Christian religion and escaped from her uncle a house to that of a lady named Mrs vnnej, a member of the Zenana Mission His widow a relations demanded her extra editions but Miss Mulvaney refused to give her up so the relations brought a suit for her restoration in the local civil courts The suit was decided in favour of the Zenana Mission, but the Judicial Commissioner re v earned the decision on appeal and Sound an the widow has been restored to herdisconso late relatives During her examination she made the following statement I left for relation wished to adopt that of Jesus Christ got the knowledge from the Holy Book which is the Christian Bible inspired by the Holy Ghost But, according to the Commissioner, this cannot be accepted by a court of law as a sufficient reason for a minor to repudiate the protection of her lawful guardians '
