MONKEYS AND LIGHT. :.? ?' '. It is a strange fact that in night-timo an unknown sound will scaro monkeys almost out of their wits. Tho crenking of a wheel barrow, n whisper, tho rustling of it; window curtain; is enough to throw them into a fit of horrified screams and contortions; capuchin monkoys rush wildly through their cage, mac aques try to forco thoir prison-doors, tho littlo marmosets huddlo together hko tho princes in tho Tower, all about a matter thoy would disdain to notice in. daytime. Tho old males of the anthropoid- apos are about as hard to scaro as any living creature, but after dark the voriest triflo will inspire them with nn nlmost supernatural fenr ; nnd it mny bo a mere fnncy, 'jut I onnnot got rid of tho notion that this night-horror of our hirsute relatives must bo tho origin of tho spectrc droad of savago nations, and indirectly, per haps, of mcdimvnl domonism nnd modern spiritualism, — ,' ghost-mongery,' ns tho sceptical Germans call it. Monkoys nro not very sharp-scented, nnd havo to roly on their oyos, and in night-timo, therefore, nro nlmost nt tho morcy of their enemies, jaguars, pan thers, and leopards, whoso owl-oyes enable thorn to hunt by moonlight, and in tho virgin woods of tho tropics tho constant dread of mistaking tho approach of n murderer for tho rustling of the fitful night-wind would bo onoiigh to ninke n Berserker nervous. ' It is not books or pictures,' snys Chnrlos Lamb, ' nor tho Btories of foolish servants, which creato these terrors in children. Thoy can nt most givo thorn n direction. Tho stories of tlio Ohimioras and Gorgons may roproduco themselves in tho brain of superstition, but thoy woro thoro before. Thoy aro transcrjpls, types' : tho arohe-typos aro in us, and eternal. May it not bo that thoso archetypes aro tho prowling' ferae of tho tropical forests 'i—Ex- chahge. ? ? ? ''r- \ '
