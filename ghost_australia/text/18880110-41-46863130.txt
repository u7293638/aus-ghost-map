I had asked the railway porter If I must change my luggage from one train to another, .ffis reply .wasjihat I might either dp so hero or at Wolseley, the next station. I 'elected to leave it until reaching Wolseley, and bo went with three of my fellow travellera to lunch. On our return to the station; I found that the 'tr∈ in which I, hadjleft my luggage had gone on. I followed in the narrow-gauge (rain, and on arriyaTat Wolseley was calmly informed i that 'the train oontainiog my luggage had gone on to , Serviceton. Fortunately Mr. Mac farlane had travelled on by the first train, and v .had taken my luggage out , at Wolseley, else I should have been pu$ ,to conaiderable inconvenience by relying upon the information given by .the railway officials at Border Town. . At Narracoorte we found an apology for a refreshment-bar, where we obtained a c ip of, .weak tea. Cornwall,' wno was clever at jokes, said the tea was so, weak that it was hardly able to come ont of -the pot, while Wiseman suggested that per haps the weakness was caused by the hot weather... Unfortunately, for Wiseman's joke,. the weather was, not hot, so, the . cause pf that tea's weakness still remaias a mystery. Soon after passing Narra coorte Mr, a Macfarlane left; us. Some one now proposed, a quiet rubber at wbiat to help us to while away, the time. 0{,We were all modest at first, and nroteated very faintly. ;,l-at, strange to say, each member of the party produced at/^he same monienta^pack of f cards !

And I am not sore that the uiatter ended there, for in my bedroom Coring the i Wes ra»* hoars ayont tha twal I fancied I heard unmistakable sounds of merriment, intermixed occasionally by tv&i; Bhouta aa 'fpu*' ?? I go three,' 'I go nap.' What it meant I cannot gnesa, unless it be that the higher degrees of Masonry were being worked. Next morning it had been arranged that we were all to start for the 'Pont,' a place on the denelg Biver, in 'Victorian territory, at which there were a ferry and an hotel The morning was very hot, and I reaDy pitied the four horses toiling a distance of 26 miles with the little breeze 'blowing with them. Flies innumerable, of coarse, bat these were not nearly so great an infliction as the bad jokes made 'on the war. Some one wanted to know low many sheep would be left if oat of a flock' of twenty sick sheep two were to die. Then, we met a man on the road, and one of oar party asked him to take a draught from the whisky-flask. 'Man, thafs good Etuff,' he exclaimed; 'I wish my 'throat were a mile long, so that 1 could taste it all the way down.' Arrived at the Pant about noon. Ordered luncheon at the Belson HoteL Found the landlord to be one of the moat dis agreeable and disobliging men we ever met. Afternoon went to fish ; pulled up river in hot son. Toiled some hoars and caught nothing ; were told there was no end of fish there, however; something wrong with our bait evidently. At 7 p m. an affecting sight. Dr. Abernethy and I had arranged to stay some days here, bat others left for Mount Gambler. Parting most trying— tears, handker chiefs, &c.; Below the Pont there is a large lagoon. Doctor and I took oar guns and lines and went there. Found numerous black swans, and shot four with gun and rifle, but could not get them — too much mud to wade through! Tried fish ing by moonlight ; no result. Next morning rose at 4; pulled down the river some distance, landed, and walked round lagoon ia quest of docks and swans ; saw nothing bat three black crows. Son very hot for walking, so went back to breakfast verj© tired and somewhat uncertain about the quantity of sport we should find here. After break fast £ahed in river just about Pant; caught six fine bream and hooked a large fish which we could not land. Prospects of sport brighter. After dinner went back to same spot, but could not get a bite for some time. At last hooked a fine big fish, but could not get him out of water ; played with him a long time. Man came along bank of river and watched oar exciting sport ' Gueas you've got a big fish -there,' he said ; ' let out more line ; now steady him.' How he polls. Perhaps it's an eel. After much excitement it dawned upon as that we had caught — a snag, and so it proved. Spectator suddenly disappeared. Abernethy said something strong. I rolled up line. Tea at hotel ; fish badly cooked. Afterwards went to lagoon in quest of game, bat no success. Beautiful moonlight night, and rowing about oa the calm river was the perfection of enjoyment. Back to hotel with cegret ; though very tired cleaned guns, drank the health of Mr. Brown, also to the memoryof the lateDake of Wellington. ° Next morning passed quietly. Tried a little fishing, but only caught three small mullet. Went down to mouth of river. Beautiful sight to watch the waves of the sea breaking upon the sandbanks for milea * in every direction. Glorious breeze, too. Went some miles along the creek, which, empties iteelf near mouth of Glenelg Biver. Heard that .there were wild ducks in the creek. Oar usual lack — saw nothing. Sat down and looked at each other. What a day we were having. Harried back to hotel to prepare for swau stalking on the lagoon by moonlight. Fish for tea; badly cooked. Went to lagoon. Waited for moon to rise. Waited in vain. Moon hidden by clouds — our usual luck again. Went back to hotel satisfied that the Punt aa a place for sport was a failure. Pro posed going out early in morning to fish ; Abernethy would not hear of it. Morning very hot — north wind. Walked round township ; inspected racecourse and cricket ovaL After breakfast started for Mount Gambier. On way called at Temple ton's Halfway Home. Found Mia. Templeton very chatty. Told va some thrilling incidents of her twenty years' sojourn in this lonely spot. Gave us some sugar-beer, qualities of whish we duly recognised. Reached Mount Gambier in time for lunch. First decent meal for some days. Afternoon found the town very busy ; streets quite crowded. Made sundry calls to exchange New Year greetings. Arrange to start next morning for Mr.' Ehret'a camp at the Carpenter's Hocks. Our party increased to six in all. Started at 6 a.m. , Mr. Shred kindly under taking to drive as to the place. Moat of the way lay through the scrub, where there are no roads. I never saw such Bplendid driving in my life before. The manner in which oar team was kept clear of the roots, large stones, aad other obstructions which might have upset oar trap, the horses going at a good speed too, was a source of wonder to me. The scenery along the route was most interest ing, and in short, between the admiration for our driver's skill, the novelty of driv ing for the first time through the bush, the ever-changing scenery, and the high spirits in which* our party was thrown by the fresh morning breeze, I could not help exclaiming that it was the most delightful drive I had ever enjoyed. The camp was reached about 11 o'clock. We had taken an alfresco breakfast under the shade of a friendly tree on the way, so while lanch was being prepared we strolled round the place to view our situation and to get an appetite. Mr. Ehret has shown good taste in the choice of hia rite for a camp. It is on the sea shore, at a place where the land projects into tiie sea, coming to a sharp point. Oa each side of thfe point there is a large bay with good- sandy beach,' making Boleridid bathing- places, while a little out seawards ;. the sand gives place to low rocks, which serve as natural break waters. Among these rocks fish of all kinds iispbrt themselves. Numerous 4bit}a make it dangerous for bathers to go beyocu shallow water, nor are they always aafe front ^attack even dose to the shore. Lanch over oar indefatigable host pro posed a drive ' fa^° **» 'C™0 ** -luert of kangaroos. Saw WveraI» ** ««? vnofc get within ahootfcg disw'^ **** :he/f, my first experience oi be*!1^ gashed.

This interesting pwcesston went on untillBupooae thekangaropthought he had had enough fun out of me for one day, so he disappeared altogether. I then turned to go tack to my ^companions, After wandering for some time among the tattscrublbegan to reafo» the fact that I waa lost I cooeyed, but got no reply. Climbed a tree, but could _aee nothing, because of the dense timber, and at last began to fire my gun every_few muuuea. tojnve my companions a clue as to my whereaboufaB. AH was of no i avail, for.no answering Bound came, and I had joat began to feel anxious when I fancied 1 baud. the oack of & 8P* ** .aoma distance in the opposite direction to tiuiv in -which. I waf going- I retacstt ny steps, continued firing' my gun- ' icd at' last had tfce joy of hearing the iragbn crackling its way through the undergrowth, and soon joined my com rade*. The party had not lieard my ihpto,andso their coming In mydfoc tidn was quite accidental The sensation jf being lost in the bush is one that can jnly be understood after it has been ex perienced. We were now about 7 miles from the camp, which we reached just before dark. Up early next morning— by sonrlse. Party divided, one half going to catch srayfish and netting other fish. Dr. A. ind myself went for kangaroo in the scrub. Again oar usual lack; result, Dr. A. wounded one, but it got into the scrub and couldunot be found. San very hot. Oa returning to camp found our jompanions had been more snccesaful in their fishing. Four dozen crayfish, some Df them weighing T lb., and a nice basket of mullet were the results of their labours. Capital breakfast, mullet and crayfish dike perfect. After the meal was over had some fan in the bay spearing fish. Started for a rocky promontory on the seacoaafc about 2 miles distant, where some curiouB rock formations are to be seen. Another glorious drive it proved to be, Ehret sending the team along in fine style. Drove to top of a high hill by a path which took away our breath ; wagon on two wheels moat of the time. Said it was good for our livers. Didn't believe it Lunch on top- of this hill. Sun hot, but ex hilarating breeze blowing from the sea. Examined the rocks on aeashore. A wild spot. No chance for any vessel that once »ot driven in here. Place called Black fellow's Hole, said to be full of fish. Though, close to shore it is very deep. Some of oar party elected to try fishing here. Three of us drove on to Lake Bonney to get a few black swan, wild duck, and teaL Wagon on top of afore mentioned hill. Mr. Ehret asked if Dr. A. and I would waik down the hilL Did not like to show white feather, so elected bo ride down. Tied two hind wheels, then made a dash ; held our breaths ; iown we go ; she's tilting over ; now for i Bmash ; make ready to jump ; now she rights ; down at last ; close shave ; only Bhret'a skill and nerve saved us. Sha'n'ttry it again. Called at Cape Banks Lighthouse; wished keepers a happy new year. Arrived at Lake about 3 p.m. Lots of fowl, large boat, Btrong wind, could not travel fast enough, so only shot seven swana and a few ducks. Returned back rery wet and cold. Picked up our com panions at rocks. They had been unsuc sessfol; didn't believe Blackfellow's Eole was fall of fish. Fancy they had seen a ghost ; would not admit it though. Arrived at camp at dusk quite ready for tea. After that meal too tired to go out. Quiet rubber at whist, clean guns, bed. Tuesday two of oar party ill — rheumatics. Were to return to Mount Sambier in the afternoon ; final dip in the sea, then out crayfiehing until lucoh time. Packingup, horses ia ; all ready ? JS we go ; one look back at the place we leave with much regret after an all too brief stay. That glorious drive homeward L shall never forget. How anxious our lost (Ehret) was that I should kill my irat kangaroo. I had been unlucky litherto, and I believe the good old soul 'elt the disappointment as much as I did. Sow eagerly he watched the scrub as we Irove through in the hope of giving me a ast chance. And when the chance came ind I missed my mark, how the good lature of my friend still displayed itself, tnd he Bwore at the gun, at the ammu lition, at everything in fact except ie marksman. Dear old Ehret, I would Jiat the world held more such unselfish md generous dispositions as thine. Back » Mount Gambier, where in Thurston's imoking-room we related our exploits to nany assembled friends — exploits that oat nothing in the relation. Up betimes next morning to catch the train at an un necessary early hour, back through rocky country and desert scrub until Adelaide is reached, and our holiday trip ended. Grreat the pleasure that trip afforded as, and long will it live in oar recollections. And if any one wishes to escape the heat of Adelaide, get among pleasant scenery, ind is not over- anxious about getting 3port, he cannot do better than follow in nur tracks, only that he shonld shorten Ilia stay at the ' Pont,' and lengthen it it Ehret'a Gamp.
