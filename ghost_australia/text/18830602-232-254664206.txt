SYDNEY ECHOES. • Sydney; 24th May. (By W.L.D.) . The tnmcar question is one ot considerable fnportaoee brre, considering tliat a so less tag" ci^oact head line than "The Judgment of Jogger* aaut" ttu used by one of tbe papers here to asooacce tbe recent decision of the Supreme Court, that the steam motors, \rhl«h have reaped a plentiful bnman h&rr;±st since their inception, *»re an il.egal iostl ration. I don't ^app^se any* •oe nssUJy does imitate the Hiado? fanatics, and •willingly allows himself to beman^lM, bnt I suspect the victim*, and cot the xnoturs, are to blame by re&scn; of their own th<ragatlessn-*Bs. 31; a b-jrt cf qFllo£i?tlc process it is eisy to arrive at the conclusion that each pear,!** deserrj their fate, as for ioniance—1. tbonEhdefs people get ran over and killed; 2t thoaz+itlisa people ciu»e mrro than half the mtsc&ief; in this world ; 3, therefore i hoogbtless people are b^tt-r oat of it Bat it ha* ever been one <.«i t s .e first<lutirH<jf* 4 theanthorit:es n to pmtect fool* again it themselves, and so, I suppose, steam no* ore have to go, and the 15,000 passecsera a-rtay drewn to their several destinations by hor>e fie.-U.

Public opmi hi, however, is rambling «minoas!y ia the distance. When will it rtinble eatEcienrJy loud in Mtrlbonras aai Bill&r;&t; to procare tbo>s conv.-nient street tramways which are ftach r to Adelaide? If be correct, and a thing of beauty really be a joy for *>ver, Sydney appears in one direction to lack eternal j '-ys. It may be my misfortune that I htve no: crofsed tbe path of beauty yet, but I notice a strange berk o! poo-i !o:;ks about the c;iy.

Upon a spare half •Asn adj oinine the market, which is right in the most thickly populated pert of Syd--y, are gathered stag ether all the m:m<»«. sbowd, roandabd&ts;^ annt sallies, and sliaottng of the place, and they arud-ifnga roaring business. E^p cially the rival theatrical troupes, who devote ranch time in yelling at one another tram their open-air stages and very •kittle to their patrons at sixpence a h«ad within the booths. It is for all the wori.1 like an English village fair by naphtha light, only I suppose there atver »m a village fair at home vih«re tbe roand-' Ubonte were tumid by small portable steam exqalaite Qnisb. Refreshments galore, of coarse, chiefly for juvenile. If urere U not the venison paaty, tplnach, and pa&diog; msde hot of "Oliver Ooldralrh'a feast,, there are at letst bolLed p»s anlghty hot, and ice creams mighty cold/—a oom- "biaat-on wmanted. to rot the strongest jottth's •epigaetrtim, if liberally applied. ' M Vfhat I" want," said Mr Gradgrinft, *'is factsf and at any dismseion tbe majority of any British -an^l.iooe are sore to b* so many ^GradgTinds. Thi^ is fefadre won why Mr Brisht'had tj^ advantage, . -^ma a mixe-Taaii^rj'd point of view; in his recent ^•Mkrjrersj- with the Eer. E. C. Spicer. in which ftesecoo w^s p:t>tu>l against Gvnesis. Mr Charles Bright U w«ii knows as a clevsr controversialist •f ^ritaali>tic tendencies, .who, not being ^aite satisfied with th* cM order of thicgn, felines to acj.pt the revelations and «21 the c:aie*reotsof Holy V,':it. MrSpiceras less widely K'uown &3 a priest of the Anglican Church, which is witboot ahead here at prc-a«nt. Von'id he have «nt-»red ap*>n thij pib*ic bad thore been a Bi*hop < f >y«l i*-} ? Kvery x&n;'s west point is a belief in his a'Mify to <!•> o. b? somdthing Nature never intended hi n t-> do or 1-c, and Mr Spicer' evidently u th«a belief that he is a controversialist.

A wmt of lngtca! perception may be •f little ui )m-t:t v'a -a a mxn takes his atand upon revelation; but Mr Spider cat the ground from tinder %ls own f^et at the cutsst by expressing bis owa doubt of the authorised version of the translation of Genesis. In fact, hs sail it vu all wrong. M Then you are preachiug what you don't believe," 1 •came quick as lightning from bis opponent, and with this catchy catchy style wincing no Iittls ap. fdaaad; but the applause wan cot iortha triumph «f materialism over religion,only a British approval of a man gettia^ "ons"into hi/anUgonist in a f«lr fight. iSo thd debate went on; Bright reiterating the old platitudes, and Spacer flounderingmore aad Bore. Cd-nn, Denton, aod Professor M Coy, of Melbourne, were all m<«re cr Iras maltreated, and the discussion came to an end without anybody being edified or anyone hurt much, as all discus* &OU4; must end where one pins hi* faith to science and another t) revealed religion. To make the jnctorecjmplete.this week the Bishop of Melbourne, who thinks science and religion ehould go hand iu band, ought to have held the b dance between the rfi^patant-; as it was, the Minister if Public In* btru tion occupiei the chair. Tha ladies may be interested to learn that the ipodrra Hebrew authorities, with wb^m Mrs«plcer •rammad f^r theocea^lm, have de;ide«i ttiat-thbir general mother uid not c^mc out of Adam's side— that, in fact, the translation as we hare it of tbe anaent documents is all wrong. According to them, she appears to have a special creation; but then, ai «*ttier and far older rabbinical authorities have rxiiintsiaed Adam was created with a tail, that an was sent down to rat it off aud m %ke it into a woman, thit a monkey ttole It, that the angel «h%)»ed the monkey and caught hold of his tail, the tcata body getting ott with the Adamite production, tto i that ttn 4 left in the lurch, the angel fatfro&cd; •it .man en t o f the simiin appendage. All thi.t has bean seriouely avouched, and so it will be seen from a ciudal lecture of this kind that the ladies have an embarrassment of choice aa to their origin—rib, tail, or separate existerce. Wo h*va a very religious cause eeldn-e here ju mov The minister of the leading Wesleyan Chuixih, ttu Rev.

These are wonderful fellows, and aee farther than even tbe dreaming poet laureate in the ecstasy of inspiration. Be saw no further than tramau eye could see. but they behold such invisible charms about Hlacktown that their descriptions romance like a fairy tale.
