ENTERTAINMENTS. MECHANICS’ INSTITUTE. Professor Anderson, “the great wizard of the North," exhibited his skill as a prestidigi tateur at the Mechanics’ Institute last evening, and, as might be expected, attracted a very large audience, the lecture-hall being well ■filled. The entertainment is similar to those given some years ago by Heller, the famous magician, and later still by the Fakir of Oulii. Mr Anderson, who is assisted during his mysteries by Mrs Anderson, exhibited great proficiency in the art of magic, and bis tricks were performed with the ease and skill of a master. Among those which created ' the greatest amount of amusement was the intel lectual clock and bell; while the production of goldfish in globes of water completely mystified the audience. About one of his beat efforts was that known os the basket trick. In this Mrs Anderson is placed in a large basket which the wizard probes with a sword, when screams are heard issuing from.' it. The basket is then displayed—empty of course—and Mrs Anderson makes her appearance from another part of the.stage. The bird-cage trick was equally well done. , Professor Ander son will appear again this’ 'evening with a new supply of mysteries, including the ghost, spirit hands, live demon cauldron, marvellous disap pearance of a human being, and such like sen sational eights. ,
