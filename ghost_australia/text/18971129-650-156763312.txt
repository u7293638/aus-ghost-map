C0NFIRMA1 ION SIRVIJE. At S.S. Michael and John's Ca he dral yesterday afternoon, the Right Rev, Dr. B-rae. Bishop of Buthnrst, nBSi8tedby Revs. J.O'Dowtl (Adni.) and S. H, McGee, aomiiii-tered the act anient \--f (Jonfiimation to 125, candidates con sisting of girls, boys and aduns. The ceremony was a beautiful one. The girl can tidates were dressed in pare white, with veils. Tbero was s very arge congregat on. His Lordship in bis address explained fully the meaning of the Sacrament of Ooufi'-uiation. It was a Sacrament of iueir dory cunu auu nun merely a cere moDy. Some of those who separated 'rom the Chnrcb 300 years ago did away with it altogether, while others sti 1 held to it as a profe*sion of their faith, and did not regard it as a divine sacrament. His Lordship then dealt w tb confirma tion showing^ how it had beon one ol the mainstays of their cbarch. He said tho chnrcb was never more powerful and widespread than it was' to-day, and the reason could be ascribed to the Holy Ghost visiting its members, and tbns strengthening them in iheir faitb. The gift they were to receive was given them so that hey might he strong iu forritude. There were people who read every kind of paper bnt a religious one, and so with religions books. They go to every amusement no matter how stnp'd bnt they never went to a church. Addressing the boys he urged them to avoid the u-e of bad language, ospeuially that of villifyings God's names. It appeared to ba a universal custom among men to snear by tho name of God.
