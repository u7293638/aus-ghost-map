Some of these were used for the purpose intended, but thv rest, for reasons, which: it is now unneces sary to iccupitulate, , were piled up against the noi them wull of. the, Court House, and were suffered to, remain there .untouched lor the' last eighteen months or two years. The original cost of these -blocks wns' great, and since they were piled together in KinK-street, a Government man was stationed over them night and day, to pre vent them from being stolen.
