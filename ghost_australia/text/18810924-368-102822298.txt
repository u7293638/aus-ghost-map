, DON'T IRUN IN DERBT. BY GEOROGE W. BIUNGAY BEWARe- beware of debt, Pay down for wbat you get. Your clothes are not in style, But wear thci ybt awhile; Witi brush and needle, you Can maketthem "gond as new." The head, and not the hat, The hoart, net the cravat, Makes a success of life, For husband, child, and wife. Debt is a friglhtful ghost, ~Which haunts us when .we most, SDesire sweet peace to reign Within the imind's domain. The floor seems bare and cld, The furniture is old, But sveet is sleep oni straw. Where comes no fear of law, And theo.discourteous dun For debts that should not run. Don't run in debt, beware ! It is a trap, a snare; Let fashidon put dn airs, You shun its whims and cares; Fiune feathers somnetimes make Fine birds, sometimes they break 'The wings in which they're worn, Then drooping, soiled and torn, The bird in sorrow lies, Under unpitying skies. The debtor is a. slave; " Many a men " that's brave, Pales, trembles,v when he meaets His neighbor in the streets. When notes are "coming due,' WVhat will become of you? Unless you meet the bill; You are a debtor still ! O be-an honest man; \ Earn all you fairly can, And spend less than you earn. Haeys foresight to discern That he alone is free \ho scorns the luxury 5 That teaches mnen ta forget The penalties of debt; hor oven gyves of gold Will canker hearts they hold !
