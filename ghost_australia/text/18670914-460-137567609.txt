i . * -«-?-~ j TOWN MEWS. JSo despatches were received by the Govern ment by the list mqil relative to the visit to "this colony of the Dhke of Edinburgh, but soine newspapers arrived for His Royal High .nefes, which have been ordered to be sent on toi Adelaide. A paragraph ia the United Service Gazette fixes-the tame of his probable arrival in jthie colopy as the 4 th-of next monih. There cannot, however, be much dependence placed upon that announcement, as-no mention is made of Western Australia, 'near is any time allowed for the visit of the duke to that colony, although it has always been understood that he would call there. It w&fe; also previously reported that His Royal Highness would visit Mauritius, but toothing is now said of that intention. : A meeting of old isoldiets resident in the neighbourhood of Melbourne! was held ofi Mon day evening at the London Tavern, to oon sider the expediency, of forming a veteran battalion. , One object entertained by the originators of tHe proposal was to fssist in "the reception of H. Hi, the Duke of Edin bu^h,' and another t6' form a permanent co*npiabj/in the voluhieferforce.' About fifty persons Wert present' Mr. L. S. R. Lovell, late of the ISfch Light Infantry, wis voted to the chair. He stated that he had written to Colopel Anderson on the subject, but had .not .jet. received any reply, end he sug gested that those; present might enroll themselves as willing to serve, and the meet ing could then be adjourjied till Colonel Anderson had been communicated with. This suggestion was accepted, and thirty of those present entered theiiv. names. . The meietihg then adjourned tQl Friday evening, it is estimated that there are about 300 old soldiers residing near Melbourne, and from these it isanticipoted that a^very respectable compan might be formed. The Usual weekly meeting of the City . Council took place on Monday, but the busi ness was of little public interest. It was re solved that the Duke of Edinburgh should be invited to lay the foundation-stone of the new town-hall, and that a gold trowel should be made for use on the occasion. During a dispute which occurred a few days since in Little Lonsdale-street, between a man named Galvin and his wife, the woman received injuries of sufficient magnitude to necessitate her subsequent admission into the .hospital. After her discharge from that in stitution she died, and from suspicious par ticulars furnished to the police, Galvin was apprehended and lodged in the .central gaoL On, his being acquainted on Monday with the* death of his wife, the unfortunate man succeeded in administering to himself a dose of poisoh. On Saturday the foundation-stone'of a nfew bridge over the Merri Greek, on th6 Heidel berg-road, was laid. The old structure-^' wooden erection-has been in existence about flfteenjears, and has latterly been in a statoof great decay. The flood which occurred about thr^e years ago inflicted considerable damage upon it, and necessitated the expendi ture of a large - sum, of' jnoney , to" keep, it payable." Besides being out of repair, its!; situation is also inconvenient, the approaches to it on both sides of the' creek being very difficult.' ? The district lies within the jurisdiction of the Heidelberg Road Board; and that body, sensible of the defi ciencies of the present bridge, have for some time past been considering the expediencyol abolishing it altogether and constructing, a new one, which would render Heidelbeig more easily accessible from Melbourne." Ajs the j aid of the adjoining municipalities of East -Collrngwood and FitScroy could ?iot be obtained, the board sought the assistance of' . the Government, and after some negotiations the Minister of Roads promised to give £2,500 in aid of a new bridge. The re | mainder of the oost (about £6,900), will be borne by the Heideibexg Road Board alone, from its rates' and ?the toils derived from | the road. This bpard seems to be not I inattentive to the requirements of the locality within its bounds, for within thp last thrqe years it has completed two other br^d^&s; besidesthe one now commenced. It1 has builp ft substantial stone bridge over the Dare-' bin Greek, the cost- of which was about -£4,900; and has expended £1,607 on a bridge over the Plenty. Thus within th*®o.yeM8 ithe ;«2j>enjditiire made and propos%d' M neafly £JL5,^KK), The bridge the foundation-ptone-of i ,whi(|h wa8 laid on Saturday will beoione arcty °eliptical in form, and of e%hty taet1 spai springing from solid bluestoneashlar ! ftbutprients, its rise being twenty-elfeht fetet.'

The iestamated coataf '? fotmfldtibtt^tbhe was perfottnied bfllO'ofiii1 Sutherland, chairman of the Heidelberg Road Board, in the presence of ft large num ber of the inhabitants of, the district, and of several members of Parliament. Prior to the commencement of the pro-' ccedings, Mr. Trenoweth board) presented to Mr. Sutherland a silver trowel, suitably inscribed, subscribed for by the members and officers of the board. A bo; containing the Melbourne dailypapors, coins of the realm, and a parchment contain | infe the names of members and officers of the board, the engineers, and contractors, was then deposited in a cavity in the foundations, ; and the stone having been lowered to its reet ing-placo, Mr. Sutherland pronounced it to be well and truly laid. Mr. Sutherland then addressed the .assemblage, congratulating them upon the public spirit of the district in commencing such a work, and stating that be hoped when completed it would prove beneficial to the place. Mr. Balfour, M.L.A., also made a few congratulatory observations, remarking that this was. one of the best proofs of the continuing progress and im provement "Of the colony. Of the colony's moral advancement they had abundant evi dence. The exhibition lately held was an evidence of its rapid progress materially, but such works as this bridge would do more than any number of exhibitions to show its material prosperity. ' A short address was also delivered by Mr. Jt. G. Durham, clerk to the board, after which the greater part of the as semblage adjourned to a marquee, where 'a lunch was prepared for them by the contrac tors,-and a number of speeches were made bearing more or lees on the character of the day's proceedings. The annaal meeting of the subscribers to 4hc Horn brook Bagged-school Association was held on Monday in St. Geoige's-b»il; his Honour Judge Pohlman presiding. 2&e; report of the.committee stated that at the various schools there was, an average daily attend anoe of 577 children, all of whom would otherwise have been uncared for and neglected, and would in many cases have gone to swell the criminal population. The system of management was extremely ample and economical,, and at every one of die schools the receipts, exceeded the expendi ture. Dean Macartney, Dr. Cairns, Mr. Bar ker, Mr. T. T. A'Beckett, and other gentle men addressed the meetipg in support of the objects of the association. A deputation of Government contractors, headed by Messrs. Amess and Lin acre, on Tuesday waited upon the hon. the Com missioner of Public Works, for the purpose of bringing under his notice certain grievances they consider that they laboured under in con nexion with the enforcing of £he conditions attached to contracts held under Govern ment. The clauses of the conditions specially complained of were the following: -No. 5, en largement of contracts after acceptance of tender; No. 15, power to suspend worl^ when money not voted by Parliament; No. 24, power of inspector to require dismissal "by contractor of any workman; 'No. 26, as to mode of payment; No. 28, as to en forcement of contracts, appeal to inspector geneyal, $nd also mode of tendering. The deputation complained that the conditions of 'Contracts were sometimes altered unknown to the contractors, who were then left,to tender in the dark; that in some cases pay ment once a month had been refused ; that advances were net made on expensive por tions "of contracts nearly finished, *>n the ground that they only represented raw material; that occasionally, after a con ractor's deposit had been accepted, -and the . amount declared, tenders were again invited by advertisement* thus giving an. unfair Advantage to subsequent tenderers; that the ,system of opening tendeiB without accepting any greatly encouraged dummy tenderers ; and that the officers of the depart ment had put quite a new interpretation on the word " rubble," by which many con tractors had been .led into unlooked-for ex pense, rubble work as regarded by the offioeiB of the .department having become more expen sive than ashlar itaeliMr. Vale said he did npt think any injustice had been done under clause 5, but he was willing , to deal with any case in which tho contractor seemed to have been unfairly* treated. The only remedy for the grievances' said to exist under clause 15 was to get appro priation bills passed each year.' The opera tion'of clause, 24 did not appear to be harshi inasmuch as the inspector could not dismiss without submitting the matter to the in epector-generaL As to flause 20, he folly r©-_ cognised the desirability of prompt* payments, and, though he cauld r^ot pro mise that payments would always be ! monthly, it was intended that'tie/ should \, be" so.

Mr. Ford (the mayor) presided. The proceed- ings were somewhat noisy. Mr. Duncan McNaughton moved a resolution, express- ing regret that the Market Committee had agreed to adopt a piece of land which was really a swamp as a site for the market, and also regretting that the council had hurriedly resolved upon a work which would involve a large expenditure and a special rate. Mr. Levett seconded the motion. Both speakers denied that they entertained any opposition to a market. Councillor Tullett defended the action of the Market Committee, contending that the suc- cess of the market hitherto proved the pro- priety of the site, and maintaining that it would cost little over £100 for filling up and draining the land. Some words passed be- Tween Mr. Tullett and Mr. McNaughton, respecting a charge against the latter of improperly obtaining the plans for the market. Councillor Crouch admitted that it was desirable to establish a market, but asserted that the position chosen for it was not a proper one, and that the council had too hurriedly arrived at a decision upon it. Mr. H. M. C. Gemmell moved, and Dr. Van Hemert seconded, an amendment, that the meeting cordially approved of the action taken by the council to establish a permanent public market in St. Kilda on the site already selected, and urged the expediency of secu- ring the land and erecting the necessary buildings forthwith. After some remarks from Councillor Lord, the amendment was put and carried.

We may state that' nearly 300 destitute children are supported at the orphanage, and that it is necessary to' raise a consider able sum to enable the managers of the in stitution to claim the Government grant.' An institution which performs so great and vet so unobtrusive a work as the mainte nance of 800 orphans deserves the Recogni tion and support of the philanthropic por tion of the community. The manifestation of party feeling at the Biohmdnd Council-board lias become so dominant as to preclu4e the transaction of public business. The ostensible motive of compJaintput forward, bya -section of the i council is the omission of a protest against the anticipated proceedings of a special meet ing of the council from the minutes of such meeting; but it is quite apparent the - true ffliitth of obstruction is based uponrancOrous opposition in ihe selection of a fitting site for a new town-hall. The nature of the present dispute may be briefly stated.' Mr. Griffiths (the mayor) had applied to the council for leave of absence to visit Europe, and it had been determined to entertain theapplication at the next ordin&iy; meeting of the coun«jil (the 29th ult) In the meantime suspicion was aroused that a' section ;of the council would prove antagonistic to receiving Mr. Griffiths' application, and it aftetwa^Js tran spired that the line of tactics tobe puraued by the obstructionists was simply to retire from the; chamber whenever the application was brought forward for consideration. As their withdj&wal; would prevent the formation of a quorum, no business could be transacted; and if 6r. Griffiths absented himself from four consecutive meetings, according to the pro visions 6f the Municipal Act his seat would become forfeited.; > In oider to checkmate this manoeuvre, and as Mr. Griffiths; was anxious to leave the colony by die last out-going mail, a special meet ing of the council was summoned on the 24th nit to be held on the 28th. On tie. 26th ult,'A protest of the anticipated proceedings of the special meeting, signed by three coun cillors, was delivered to?Dr. Stewart, who had. been elected mayor. in thp room of Mr. Griffiths. The , sjp^ial ':n)e§tipg was held,, and-, leave,i o£v,absence .-for six moriths" was granted to. 'Mr.: (Jriffiths. Dr. Stewart, as chairman of tihecouncil, con . sidered ibe document placed In oh the26t|i jilt to be an illogical presumption, andaooordiagiy refused to insert the protest m the ainutes of the epedalmeeting. So tte matter rested uutil l^tTJuusday* Wheh the orainaiy meeting of faecoiwicU should havebeep held.

Only a few 'trifling improvements 'were suggested, and these are to be carried ' out. Tenders for "the construction of the vessel were to be immediately called for, and it is said that when finished the Victorian turret ship will be one-of tbe finest, If not the finest, vessel in the world. She will be tinned With four 600-pound gans, aiid is es timated to Cost £120;000. Before any tender is accepted it will be sent to Major Pasley fpr his Approval.'

It' represents the Prince of Wales, as Hamlet, struggling with John Bull, who, as Horatio, is holding him back from pursuing the ghost of Oeorge IV., to whom the Prince is saying, Til follow thee!' 'The inference is obvious, and the 'publication of such a picture is surely a Sign of the times; for the Tomahawk (says the Flaneur in the Star) is by no' means " & low Radical papfcr." It? is'another sign of the times, which will probably have been noticed by those whose inclination or whose duty prompts their attendance atpubhc dinners, that while the toast of the Prince of Wales, once so provocative of enthusiasm, is now received .with comparative coldnees, the mention of the name of the Princess calls forth unmistakable demonstrations of sym pathy and "personal attachment. Qui vivra verra.,n The usual monthly meeting of the Fourth Union Building Society was held on Thursday evening last, at the offices, 82 Collins-street east, the Hon: Hehry Miller, president, in the chair. The > receipts for the month, amounted to £3,200, and a few shares were sold at premiums tanging from £10 15s. 6d. to £1178. 6d. per share, the chairman remark ing that the low Tate of premium ought to bring in a large number of borrowers. In consequence of the wet state of the weather, there was a very meagre attendance at tiie battalion drill of the Metropolitan Artillery, at the orderly-room, William-street, last evening.
