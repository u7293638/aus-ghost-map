CHAPTER X11 THE ANSWERED PBAYZB. For the many dajs and nights that little Ked tossed in delirium, Luke watched by him with as great anxiety and tender care as the kindest-hearted mother could do Moaning about the burda and squirrels, imagining that be whs again in England, with no fire in the poor cold cottage by the Ghost pool, and once m a while crying piteousiy for breid, bis r w ings gave Luke some idea of what the suffer- ings of the little life had been But at length the crisis of the disease was passed, and the doctor's face began to weir a more cheerful expresión whenever he entered the sick room As the chid s mind became clearer, he began to comphm of a pain in his leg and cry piteousiy for his sister "Let her go to hun," said the physician one day, bearing the cry, " for I see she's already booked for the disease " So for a day the children were to ether, and then Alice was laid in bed beside her brother Being a stronger child it would seem, sbu had the fever m a ver> mild form, so thit by Christmas Eve both children were down stairs by the kitchen fire, Alice only a little thinner, but poor ^ ed a perfect skeleton, with his large swollen leg bandaged out before him The meek little fellow was verj patient, and as a sudden twinge of pam shot through his poor leg, he would look at it pityingly, but no tear dimmed his .ye Luke, in his ¿oy at the children's recovery, had gone to Boston in the morning, intending to bring back with him the materials for "a jolly Christmas." As he was starting, he gave to the boy and girl this exciting admonition "àow,be good children all day, and when you hear Uncle Luke outside the door this evening jump for joy, for such jollj things hell bring home to you, jou never saw in all your lives before 1" It waa a clear, cold day, with a bracing wind, that seemed to have m it a tinge of rose color, as it rippled over the crisp enow, and shook the last scar- let bernes from the barberry bushes, and Luke had not felt so hght- bearted since he left England as ha did this da} gliding merni} along rirsi. io a uiae ana coniecuûnery store went he, and brought out two parcela Then to a dry-goods' etore on Washington-street that bore over its en- trance the sign, * Kmmo+h & Co " Ihen to a book store, and, last of all to several toy stores, chuck- ling with delight as specimens of smiling beauty, in the shape of curly-headed dolls were shown him Now all this absorbed a great quantity of time, for Luke took laborious pains m selecting his articles making all sorts of ingumes as to the durabilitj of the articles he purchased, and wanting great strength and beaut\ combined for compara- tively little cash. And greatlj pleased was be after all the little things were packed in the sleigh, think- ing of the childrens delight when they should see their presents They, poor things, had tried to be very patient through all the long long dav especially Ved, who kept so still before the great fire that he fell into a a good sleep and did not wake up till late m the afternoon. Mary Jane had waded through the snow in the morning and gathered her arms full of odorous cedar bought«, with which she decorated the bedrooms and kitchen walls She was very good tempered to-day, saying lota of funny things to the children, and bustling and bnghtemng, and burnishing up everything to such a de- gree that the verj sun seemed to hate caught n little of the fnction, and was glowing with a more bnl liant light >ied idly watching her, wondered in his childish wa> if she wouldn t lake some of the anow outside next and give it a good scrubbing The very last thing Mary Jane did, after lighting all the lamps on the shelf and three home madecandles, was to draw forth the largest table in the house, and after spreading on it the whitest of white Cloths, to Jay thereon a substantial round of eat- ables Then she took her knitting and sat down to watt for Luke, being soon rewarded by hearing tbe tinkling eleigh bells grow louder and louder, tdlat last with a 'whoa!" Luke drew upright m the flood of light that fell from the open door, and jumped out much to the relief of the children, who were worked up to the highest pitch of excite- ment. "All ready'" he cried, looking in on the waiting group " Then, here we go " So saying, he brought in from the sleigh his arms full f f parcele, and depositing them on the kitchen floor, returned to the sleigh, and did the same thing over aL.ain. Leaving the horse standing outside for awhile, Luke shut the door, and said '* Now we begin " Ho felt the package nearest to bim with his thumb and finger to be sure of its contents, and ad- ded "Here, Mary Jane, this is for you But, before you open it let me say, that dresses were made to wear, and not to lay bj in a cuist " Mary Jane tore open the wrapper, and almost abneked with delight "A black silk dress '" "And this,'* said Luke, *s he hastily unfolded wrappings of soft white paper, " this is for my little AlicV" < Out came a large, curl} -headed doll that performed the marvellous operation of opening and shutting ita eyea and giving heartrending enes with the most placid countenance imaginable Poor, patient little î»ed was rewarded for his gentleness b} the gift of a real drum and large \oah'a ark, and was so delighted that ho laughed till the tear» ran down his weak face Besides all this there was a large cake, all white und glistening on the top, and when it nos cut >ou should have seen how rich it looked, and how tbe laige raisins and pieces of citron stuck out. Then there was a package of the " v ery best" cand}, all made into pigs, and sheep, and birds, and bottles, and balls, and pans, and 1 don't know what not. Then a box, that Luke said . " Flayed of its own accord the most wonderful tunes" " Is there nothing for you, Uncle Luke ?" asked thebo}. "Oh }e% to be sure, my little man," and the speaker drew towards bim a square package, and cutting the stiff strings displayed to view a little pile of books. " Now first and foremost, this large one with the nice red covers is all full of Christmas stones, with beautiful colored pictures, and shall be read some- times to good children. This one is a Bible, and this one HS tells how to get rich and be successful in life. Then those little ones with the nice pictures aro for Ned an* Alice to learn to read by when the} get well again So now we'll give a good hurrah '-have some supper, aud then the little folks will go to bed." Didn't the children sleep well that night, and didn't Luke rise next day more satisfied with biinaelf than ever before-even though there remained but five cents in the bag he called his puree, and it would be some time before another quarter's wagts were due Didn't he seem almost happ}. with hie great calm eyes looking up at the glonous sky« as Christ's blessed birthday broke over the land.
