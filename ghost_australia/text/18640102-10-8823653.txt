CRICKET. Fourteen gentlemen of the south v. eleven players of England. This match was played on Monday and Tuesday, September 28 and 29, at the Antelope-ground, Southampton. It was the wind-up match of Hampshire cricket for this year, and a match that will bear a wonderful deal of talking about for years to come, on account of " the hundred-weight" of runs scored therein by Mr. Grace. The Players were overmatched at the onset, but Ellis and II, li. Stephenson being unable to play left the profes- sionals without the ghost of a chance, A wet morning up to 10 on Monday wore, into a fine aftcr- noon, but left the ground pulpy, and the Gentle- men being minus some of their men) perforce began the hitting at half-past 1, with Mr. E. M. Grace, (or No. 1, sa |io is called), and Mr. G. Jr. Ede, the 'popular little H.C, C, 0, secretary, to tho bowling .of Caffyn and James JMIIywhite, jua. We have neil her neoessity, inclination, or apace to pilo up columns of syllables and sounds signifying "notli *iág" for although Mr. Eccloa ployed web for 10, 'wado by a uno off drive for 4, throe 3's (drives all) ? A 2, and a single, and Mr. Bailey (emergency) hit bardi'or hU li, the interest of the innings was centred in Mr. E. M. Grace's 112 (41 more than tho other 13 scored from the hal), und all about that nay be thus noted :-Mr. G race wont No. 1, be had 'scored 4 runs only when ha hit up a moonrnker, which Stubberfiold stared at, but " never went a nigh j" he then made his score into 23 when Win. Humphrey, ot deep square-leg, slopped tho ball with his right hand, Cut did not hold it. A re- markable fino drive for 4 to the orchard hurdle muda his score 40; and when it was at 45 ho hit one high up to mid-off, which Win. Humphrey caught, aud then dropped' (truly a bud minn this). He then scored 8 more riuip, when hu was lot off by Souther ton, and then Mr. Grace went on anyhow hitting nil «lind-from all sorts of bowlers with a freedom and 'force truly surprising. Bowler alter bowler t ried at .him.paitner after partnorlufthim,uud tlio fieldsmen < .np iu aknotj if over an eleven wure,and they went to .liquor. "How many havo I scored?" nsl;ed hoof .tho only scorer iu tho tent. " 81, sir," answored Bodle, " 6 more, then I make np my 3000," ¡mid Mr. G. Caffyn was forthwith driven for a 4, and tuen a drive for a singla brought out a loud cheer, ¡and the 3000 was effected, Soon after, another, cheer announced ho had scored ICO runs in tho, Mitch; ho then scored a 2, and then throoS's, and thou (with only two wickets to go down) ho superbly drove one from Lillywhite, which Cnilyn clovorly caught, and Mr. Grace was out for a certainly lucky but as certainly fino freo hitting innings of'112 runs; ho went in first man at half past one, mid (dinner intervening) was out the twelfth down at a quarter past 5 with the score ut 190. His bits comprised a cut for 5 (one for tho overthrow), two 4's (drives both), 17 3's (Que hits all round), 11 2's, and 20 singles ; ha had seven different howlers at lum (some on twice), and his 112 brought his season's i uns to cxaolly 8081 (just think off/iut, Mr. Brook). Tho other wioket-i quickly fell, and to tho groat delight of the Eleven Player?, tho iuniuga was used up ut half i>. "? i ="'?"? ' " - past 5 o'olock for 193 runs. This finished the day's play. ' Tuesday was a splendid day, the company was a ' thorough good ona, the cricket wob pretty fair, and tho wind-up as jolly a ono as anybody could wish for. The Players' first innings of 91 runs was made from the bowling of Messro. Grace, Frere, and Eccles (slow). Thomas Ucarno's 19 included a fine straight drivo for 6 from Mr. Grace. Caffyn's 22 was well obtained by a 4. a 3, a 2, &c.; John Lillywhito played in good form for 12. and then ran himself out like a raw colt; and Bailey surprised a great many people (himself in- cluded) bj' scoring 11. They were all out before 2 o'clock.and at 3 followed their innings with Caffyn and Hearne to the bowling of Mr. Campbell and Mr. Maturin. Caffyn made two Bingles, and a 2 to log, and then opened his shoulders to ono from Mr. Maturin, and made one of tho finest square leg hits for 6 ever seen.elearout of the ground ; he then scored 5 moro runs, and was absurdly missed at square leg by Mr. Frederick, but he aftorwards sent one up that came down into safe hands at point. Hearne's 21 was another good innings, comprising a 4, a 3, four 2's (he made a 3 and two2's from one over of Mr. Matmiu's), John Lillywhite again pla) ed well (bar a one-handed hit to leg for 2) for 17\. wiienTie was fairly beat and bowled by a slow. Julius*Co)3ar's 23 was not only the highest score in the match, but was out-and-out good cricket; and Holmes (who went in No. G) played n Bteady not out innings of 15, and saved the Players n one iunings defeat. Thoy scored 121, leaving at 20 minutes to G, tho Gentlemen 20 runs to score to win. With avery laudable desire to play the match out, the Players wero quickly on turf again, and a merry crew they were. Point enjoyed a cigar ; long leg alternately enjoyed a bit of chaff with the lookers-on, ' and a suck at a rare-smelling Havannah; while Mr. Umpire was pulling away at a short pipe, and the '* chaff" all round was something to hear. This was all very jolly na doubt, but wo do doubt if it was cricket. The light was a woful bad one-¡n fact, the* moon was all but up when the match was over-and the very fino bowling of young Lillywhito (who scored 28 balls and no run scored from him) took two wickets while Southerton's slow did two more, ero the 20 runs were scored ; so after nil the Gentlemen won by nine wickets only, the following being the full score:- i The Fourteen Gentlesibn.
