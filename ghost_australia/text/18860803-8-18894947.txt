POISTltY. f KILLING TIME, I Ofton tlie foolish apeak ol " killing time," Spending la idleness the prcclout hour« ; They dread with ateps laborious to ollmb Life's rugged path, but play among the flowers. They lay that time hanga honvy on their banda, Yet do not spend It usefully In work. But follow blindly Pleasure's rose-crowned bandi Through pleasant ways, where treacherous pit-falla lurk They do not know that those who with a will Strive manfully to gain some noble end, Alone are able at the last to kill Old Time, and make even death itself tbtlr friend. Although they go, their work remains behind, ' The lasting evidence of time well spent; For thus the labeur of man's hands or mind Forma his memorial and his monument. But those who. In their thoughtlessness, conspire To kill their best friend, Time, will find at lagt They are pursued by feet that never tire i By ghost« of precious hours slain In the past, And when, at last, their sands of life have nut, And they count o'er their losses and their gains, Then will they wish their foolish deeds undone, And long to lire their wasted lives again. And then will they dlscor?r, when too late, Instead of killing time as tbey bad thought, Time bia killed them. Such crcr is th» late 01 weak, ignoble souls that live for naught.
