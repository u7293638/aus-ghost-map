The Tichborne Case. THE EX-CONVICT. WHO IS HE? Thus the New York Hbbaxi- : — The Boger Tioh borne-Orton affair is worse than Banquo's ghost. It comes to the surface, like scam, in many mid most unexpected quarters. Miss Georgians, Baring, sister of the Baring Brothers, London, has now come out is behalf of the 'claimant.' She sent Edmund Orton to Sydney, New South Wales, to see an inmate of the Pcrramatta Lunatic Asylum. Edmund returns with the astounding statement that the saad lunatic is his brother-, Arthur Orton. If, then, the ' claimant' is not Arthur Orton and is not Sir Bog-er, who is he? He was proved at the trial to be respectively both persons. What an easy matter identity is.' It re minds us of the meeting of two Dublin men. ' Good monrin'j Mr. M'Cacttiyi' ' Ah, 'tis yerself, Mr. O'Connor — hope yer well.' ' Indade, but me name's not O'Connor, I doan know.' 'Nayther is m ne M'Oarthy.' 'Ohl Thin it's nayfiier of us.' The ex-convict may now again ,arivet public attention by proving who he really is.
