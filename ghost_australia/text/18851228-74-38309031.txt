CRICKET. NOrTIt V. SOUTH. The thirty-fiftih North v. South Oricket matches was commenced on the Laun cestou Cricket Ground on Saturdaymorning, and from present appearances the Fame pro mises to be a victory for the visitors, but the "glorious uncertainty of cricket," which is the beat exemplifier of the French proverb "The unexpected always happens," may to-day alter the pharo of the game. The Southern moo having travelled from the capital in the night train on Christmas night were scarcely up to concert pitch, this possibly acsounting for the match not commencing till 11"30. Owing to a family bereavement, S. K. Chapman and E. Swan wore unable to play for the South, their places being filled by E. Maxwell and 8. Chancellor, whilst in the Northern team 0. G. Douglas tilled thoe place of Lillierap, who could not get away. Davies captained the visitors, and WVatson the local men, and the latter winning the toss selected to bat on a good, but rather dead, wicket. J. MI. MIartin and L. It. Snms opened the game to the bowling of Kendall and Burn, the fornmer beating Sams in his second over with a good one. Savigny and Martin then played the best cricket shown during the in nings, Martin scoring more rapidly than usual. The second wicket fell for 46, and the only other double figures obtained were Watson 14. Gow 14, and It. Sams 10. Gow showed great improvement, and played a very nice innings against excellent bowling. The total obtained wao 102, MIartin being top scorer with an ex. cellently compiled 26. Kendall bowled splendidly, but with hard luck, securing 4 wickets for 40 rune. Ryan, the most pro mlsing bowler in the South, obtained the ex cellent averngo of 6 for 42, and after his first few overs bowled with great judgment. The innings lasted exactly two Ihoars, and after lunch Davies sent in Cox and Gatehouse, the bowling being entrusted to Sidebottom and Manufield, the former clean bowling Cox in his second over for a duck. M'Allan and Gate. houte then played the best cricket of the day, scoring 23 and 32 respectively hy clean, eafe, play, without thu ghost of a show. Wheu they were separated wickets fell quickly, and with 0 doirn for 60 it appeared a good thing for'the North. lurn and Maxwell, however, stopped the collapse, the former hitting with great vigour and freedom for 52 not out, the best innings of the day excepting one mistake, his score including seven fours and one five, whlilst Maxwell's 23 contained four fours. Chlncellor and Kendall contributed a useful 12 and 10 respectively at the tail, bringing the total up to 167. Watson made a mistake in keeping Sidobottom and Manufleld on too long, espleeilly thelatter, for although both bowled well they became expensive. Cow obtained the first-rate average of 5 for 45, and probably never bowled better in a match, whilst It. H. Sams, who should have .been. put on earlner, scoured 2 for 6. ,The innings closed st440, and after a'brlof adjournment the North eom moncoed their second i0nlogs with 65 to the bad, Martin and L. R. Samns facing Kendall and Rynn. After putting tho last-pnmed over the chains splendidly for 5, and socoring a single, klirtin was beaten by a beauty from Ryan, clean.bowling him for 6. Gow and Peters fell in quick succession to Kendall and Ryan r0 slectively. Savigny than joiuod Sens, and both batted well againot good bowling, Sas especially displaying very neat but careful cricket. He was leaon howled for 17 y Rlyan with a hall that worked right across, Penneo father and Savigny playing oute time (six o'clock). The lielding generally speaking was good, Sideobottomn especially being noticeable for his brillianocv. particularly. in fielding his own bhowling.
