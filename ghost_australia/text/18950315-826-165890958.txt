CONFESSION AND ABSOLUTION. TO THE EDITOR. Sir—After reading your beautiful ex planation of church ceremonial, for the information of "Geo. G. W.," I thought I would drop you a line and ask you if a priest can forgive a man who makes his confession and is guilty of murder. This question has been asked by a friendly Protestant neighbor of a Catholic neigh bor, and as I know you will give an in telligent reply, I will please trespass on you to do so. I am, Sir, &c.;, JAMES |CADAN. Mount Bryan, March 9. [There is a little confusion in the way this question is put, though the meaning is clear. Every Catholic knows that it is God who forgives sins through the instru mentality of. his priests—a power which was given them when Christ said to his apostles, " Receive ye the Holy Ghost. Whose sins ye shall forgive, they are for given them ; and whose sins you shall re tain they are retained " (John xx. 22, 23). But the penitent must be truly sorry for his sins and desirous of atoning for them, otherwise the absolution given by the priest has no effect. With true contrition no sin is too heinous to be forgiven. There is no limit to the mercy of God. " Even if your sins are as red as scarlet they shall be made whiter than snow." A priest then has power to grant absolution for murder, if the penitent confesses the siu and is sincerely sorry for having committed it. A contrite and humble heart the Lord will not despise. — Ed.]
