To the Editor of the Review. 1 1 Sure, Mr. Ghost, you're very rude, To bid me come away, Before I've worn my new 6ilk gown, Which I got homo to-day." The Ghost and the Lady. Ma. ErnTon,—Your merry correspondent " Lillibullero" amuses himself with referring to the new " Political Association" kindly volunteering to relieve the Local Government of its labors, an assumption of duties wliich he seems to believe will be kindly accepted. Now, Sir, your correspondent forgets that, perhaps, the Governor may not be quite of that opinion. Like the lady in the old ballad, who when the ghost summoned her away, referred to her new silk gown, perhaps bia lCxoellency may refer to His own. Iffs Excellency may perhaps reply somewhat to the effect, " Stop a little, gentlemen, if you please; I have scarcely worn my new government gown; it will be quite time enough for you to put it on when it appears either that it does not fit me, or that I have worn it out." The people seem to think it fits him capitally well at present, and as new as it is, if the " delegates" cut it up even into shreds and patches, and divide it amongst them, there will be hardly a bit a-piece for them, wherewith to cover themselves,—Yours, Mr, Editor, SHANDV.
