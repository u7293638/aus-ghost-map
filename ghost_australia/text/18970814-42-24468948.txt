The Storyteller. The Christian. THIRD BOOK.—THE DEVIL'S ACRE. I. BY HALL CAINE, Author of "The Manxman." Behind Buckingham Palace there is a little square of modest houses standing back from the tide of traffic and neatly always as quiet as a cloister. At one angle of the square there is a house somewhat larger than the rest, but just es simple and unassuming. In the dining-room of this house an, elderly lady was sitting down to lunch alone, with the covers laid for another at the opposite side of the table. \- "Hae ye the spare rooni ready, Bnnna VI ■ " Yes, ma'am," said the maid. • ■:- • - \- "And the sheets done airing ? 'And tmith the pillows? And the pillow* ■lips—and everything finished ?" , The maid was answering ." Yes," to •act) of these questions when a hansom eaib came rattling up to the front of the bouse, and tbe old lady leapt out. of her seat . ; ■ " It's himself!" she cried, and she ran like a girl to the ball. The door bad been opened before she got there, and a deep voice was saying, » Is Mrs. Callender " " It's John ! My gracious! It's John Storm !" the old woman cried, and she lifted both hands as If to fling herself . Into his arms. **My goodness, laddie, but ye gave poor auld Jane sic a start T Expected ye T To be sure we expected ye, and terribly thrang we've been all morning making ready. Only my daft auld {brain must have been a wee ajee. But," smiling through her teaxs, " has a body never a cheek that ye must be kissing sit ber hand ?

One"of them was from his uncle, *%be Pfrfme Minister: " I rejoice to bear jof your mast sensible resolution.

The former appears to be a subject of com mon talk in thte island already, and no - . doubt the latter will soon be so." . ■ Jdhn flinched as at a cut across ttie face and, then smiled a pmile of relief. - Apparently Glory ypas writing home .wherever #he. was, and there wae.good news In that at all events. .' "Come your irays fn, laddie,, and let me look at ye, again. Man, but your face la pale and your bonnie eyes are that sunken ! . . . But sit ye down and cat.

They Tvere tooly men ; they Mved a holy lffe ; •he had not been good enough for their company. . . ... . . "But I .feel like a sajlor home from sea." he said. "Tell we what has 'happened." " Births, marriages, and deaths ? I suppose ye're like the lave of the men, and think nothing else matter® to a woman. But come, n<ow, more chicken ? No ? A wee bitee ? Ay, but ye're call* altered, laddie 1 Weel, where can a body begin ?" " The Canon—haw Ist he ?" " Fine as flvepence. Good as ever In the pulpit ?

Yes, Indeed, a rehearsal, and the 'deacon, •honest man, in the mlduie of the mag nificence!" Jdhn Storm's pale face was twitching.

" It was the first m thing I had heard tell of for years—and the nurses axe good women for all that High-spirtted?

He -would step round to tfce hospital; he had questions to ask there, and it would be a walk after luncheon. " Do," said Mrs. Calleuder ; " butt re member dinner at 0. And hark, ye, hinny, this noose is to be' your name until you light on a better one, so just sleep saf tin It and wake merrily.

The day was bright, the sun was shin ing, and the streets were full of thoroughbred horses in gorgeous car riages with coachmen m splendid liveries going to the drawing- room in ■honour of the royal birthday. As Jobn went by the palace the approaches to it were thronged, the band of the House bold Cwvalry was playing within the rails, and officers in full-dress uniform, memt>ers of the tHplomatic service, with swords and cocked hats, and ladies in gorgeous brocades, carrying bouquets of orchids and -wearing tiaras of diamonds and large .white plumes, were- filing through the gates towards the Throne room. The' aortal looted strangely uii fa'iuHJar after so short an absence, and there were new faces among the nurses who passed to aiid fro In the corridors. John naked for the matron, and wag re ceived with constrained and distant courtesy, Was she-well-? Quite well? They had ft resident chaplain now, and, bednfg in ■ priest*?- orders, he had- many advantage* where death • was so fre <iueht. Was he sure he liad not been ill ? John understood. It was almost as if lie had come out of some super natural existence. People looked at him as if they were afraid. **T came to ask if you could tell me anything of Nurse Quayle V' he said. The matron could tell liim nothiing. The girl had gone; they had been com pelled to part with lier. Nothing serious ? No, but totally unfit to be a nuree. She had some good qualities cer tainly— cheerfulness, brightness, tender ness—and for the sake of these, and hia own interest iv the girl, they had put up with inconceivable rudeness and irregu larities. What had become of her ? She really could not say. Nurse All worthy might know—and the matron took up her pen. John found the ward sister, with tire bouse .doctor at the bed of a patient. She was short and even curt; Bald over 'her shoulder she knew nothing aborit the girl, and then turned back to her work. As John passed out of the ward the doctor followed him, and stfld per haps the porter might be able to tell him something. . The porter was difficult at first, bat seeing his way clearer after a while, life admitted to receiving letters for the nuuse and delivering them up to her when she called. That was long ago, and she had; not been there, since New Year's Eve. Then she had given him a dhilMng, and said »he would trouble him no more. John gave him five shillings, and asked if anybody ever called for her. Yes, once. Who was it ? A gentleman. Had he left !his name ? No, but he had said he would write. When wa« that ? A day or two before she was there the last time. Drake ! There could not be a shadow of a doubt of it. John Storm looked at the clock. It was 3.45. Then he but toned hig coat and crossed the street to the park, with his face in the direction of St. James's-sireet. Horatio Drake bad given & luncheon in his rooms that day in honour of Glory's first public appearance. The performance was to come off at night, but In the course of the morniug there had been a drew rehearsal in the salon of tae Corinthian Club. Twenty men and women, chiefly journalists and artists, had assembled there to get a Drat glimpse of the debutante, and cameras had lurked behind portieres and in alcoves to catch her poses, *her expression*, her fleeting smiles, and humorous grimaces. Then the company toad adjourned to Drake's chamber* The luncheon was now over, the laat guest had gone, and the host was in his diutag-rooni alone. <■- Drake was standing by tlpe'chfanfiey piecc ta>Utiug ft arm* length* a pencil sketch of n woman's beautiful face and lithe ngnr*. " Like herself 4t's alive to the flnger-tlB*!" |ie/tjho&gnt;, and then he propped. It against the pier-glass. There was a <iound of the opening and closing of the outer door downstairs, and Lord Robert entered the room. He looked heated, harassed, and exhausted. Shaking out his perfumed pocket-hand kerchief he mopped Us forehead, drew a long breath, and dropped into a chair. "I've done It/ he said; "it's all over." Polly Love had lunched with the com pany that day, and Lord Robert bad re turned home with her in order to break the news of, m*> approaching marriage. He gave hJs. 'version of what had oc curred. While the girl had been remov ing 'her hAtAQd Jacket he ha* sat at the piano end thumbed it, hacdly knowing how to begin. All at once he had saitd, "Do you know, my dear, I'm- to fee married on Saturday ?" She.had -sal* nothing at first, and he had played the piano furiously. Heaven*-, -what a frame of mind to be in ! Why didn't the girl speak ? At last he had looked round at her, snd there she stood, smiling, grin ■ ningr. gasping, and white as a ghost. Suddenly sihe had begun to cry. Good God, such crying ! Yes, it was all over. Everything had been settled somehow. " But I'll be in harder condition be/ore I tackle 4uch a job again," said Lord Robert. ; ' There was silence for a moment. Drake was leaning on tie mantelpiece, his legs crossed, and one foot beating on the hearthrug. The men were ashamed, attd they began to talk of mdiXferent things. Smoke ? Didn't mind. 'Those Indian cigars were good. Not bad, cer tainly. At length Drake said in a* different voice, "Cruel but necessary, Robert necessary to the woman who i« going to be your wife, cruel to the poor girl jyho •has been." Lord Robert tossed his head and snorted Ilka a colt, rose to tys feet Im pationtly, stretched- his arm, and shot out his striped cuff, and walked to and fro across the room. " 'Pon my soul I believe I should haY» stuck to the little thing but for the old •girl, don't you.know. She's made such a good sodal running lately, . . ..arid then she's started thia evangelical craze, too,   . No. Polly Wouldn't have suited her "book . auyhs>w..' r " •Silence again, and then further talk on indifferent things. . . "Wish Benson wouldn't sweep the coda-water off the table." 4>Ring for iL" <4Tho little thing really cares for one, don't you know. And it isn't my fault, to it ? I had to hedge. Frank, dear boy, you're always taunting me with the treadmill we have to turn tor the sake of society and so forth, but with debts about a man's neck like a millstone, what could a man do ?" •' I don't lufiau that you're worse thaa others, old fellow," said Drake, "or that (sacrificing this one poor child is going to mend matters much——" *' No,' it isn't likely to improve my style of going, is it ?" " But that man John Storm was not so far wrong after all; and for this polygamy of our lavender-glove tribe the nation itself will be overtaken by the judgment of God one of these days?' Lord Robert broke into a peal of de risive laughter. " "Goon!" be cried. •' Go on, dear boy ! It's funny to hear you though-* \--after to-day'e proceedings, too !" and he glanced significantly around the table. Drake brought down his first with a thump on to the mantelpiece. "Hold your tongue, Robert. How often am I to tell you this is a different thdng en tirely ? Because I discover a creature of genius and try to help her to the posi tion she deserves !" " You hypocrite ! If it had been a .man Instead of a charming little woman with big eyes, don't you know 1" But there had been a ring at the outer door, and Benson had come in to say that a derapman w«« waiting dowc- Btslra. "Little GoMrfhtly again 1" said Lord Robert wearily. "Are these everlast ing arrangements neveil " •.' The man stopped him. It was not Mr. Gollghtty; it was a stranger j would not give his name; looked like a Catholic priest; had been there be fore, he thought. " Can it ba .. . talk of the devil 1" "Ask him up," said Drake. And while Brake bit his lip and clenched his hands, and Lord Robert took up a scent bottle and sprayed himself with eau-de cologne, they saw a man clad In the long coat of a priest come Into the room —calm, grave, self-possessed, very pale, with hollow and shaven cheeks and dark, sunken eyes, wh»ch burned with a sombre tire, and 'head so closely cropped as to seem to be almost bald. John -Storm's anger had cooled. As he crossed the park the heat of his soul had turned to fear, and while he stood < in the hall below, with an atmosphere of perfume about him, and even a delicate sen«e of a feminine presence, his fear had turned to terror. On that account he had refused to send up Ms name, and on going up the staircase lined with, prints he had been tempted to turn about and fly, lest he should come upon Glory face to face. But finding only the two men In the room above, bis courage came back, and l«e 'hated himself for his treacherous thought of her. " Yon will forgive me for this uncere monious visit, sir," he <aaid, addressing himself to Drake. Drake motioned to him to be seated. He bowed, but continued to stand. "Your friend will remember that I have been here before;" Lord Robert bent hie head, and went on trifling with the spray. ." It was a painful errand relating to a girl who bad been nurse at the hospital. T3\e girl was nothing to me, but she bad a companion who was very much." Brake nodded, and Ills lips stiffened, but he did not speak. " You arc aware that since then I 'have been away from the hospital. I wrote to you on the subject; you will remember that." " Well V said Drake. ■ "v \--" I liave only just retained, and have come direct from the hospital now." "Well?" "I see you know -what I mean, sir. My young friend has gone. Can yon tell me where to find her 7" " Sorry I cannot," said Drake coldly, and It stung him to see a look of bound less relief cross the grave face in front of him. "Then you don't know " "I didn't say that," «*aid Drake, and then the lines of pain came back. "At the request of her people I brought her up to London, str. Natur ally they will look to me for news of flier, and I feel responsible for her welfare." " If that Is so you must pardon me for saying you've taken your duty lightly," said Drake. . ) John Storm gripped the rail of the chair in front of him, and there -wast silence for a moment. ':" Whatever I may have to blame my- •elf with in the past it would relieve me to find her well end happy and *afe from all harm." - " *4 Sue is well and happy and safe, too •—I elm tell you that much." There was another woment of silence, ' and then John Storm said in 'broken sen tences, and in a voice that was struife gllng to control Itself, " I have known Her since /She was c clii'ld. sir. ... You cannot think how many tender memories. . .. It to nearly* a year since I saw her, and 'one liked to sec old :frtetkte after an; absence." Drake did not speak, but he dropped 'hie head, for John's eyes had begun to All. •" We were good friend*, too. Boy and girl comrades almost. Brother and «*teter. I should say. 'for that was how I liked to think of myself—her elder ■brother, "bound to take care of her." There was a little trill of derisive laughter from the other side of tho room, whore Lord Robert had put tl'tf spray down noisily, and turned to look out into the street. Then John .Storm drew lihr.self up, aud said in a firm Voice— v "Gentlemen, why dhould I mince matter*? I will not do so. The girl .we «(peak of i» mote to me than anybody else in the world besides. Perhaps she was orie of the reasons why I went into -that monastery. Certainly «he is the •reason I have come out of it. I lmo .come to find her. I rfhall find her. If elie is in difficulty or danger I intend t;> • *uve her. -Will you tell me -where she io V" "Mr. Slorm," said Drake, "I am sorry, very son-y, but What you soy compels me to apeak plainly. The lady Is well, and safe, and happy. If her friends are auxloiH about Jitu* she can reassure thorn for herself, and no doubt :Jia« already done so. But in the posi tion «me occupies at present yog are a dajigeron* n»an. It might not be her wish, and it would not be to her advan tage, to meet wlfh you, and I cannot allow, her to run the rtek." "Has It come to that ? Have yon a ri*ht to speak for her, sir V "Perhaps I have " Drake hesi tated, and then said with a rush, "the right to protect her against a fanatic" John Storm curbed 'himself; he bad been through a long eohooMng. " Man, Jbe- feonest," he said. " Kit her yoar In terest is good or bad, selfish or unseMkfti. .WJilt'h Is it V" Drake maVle no answer. • "But it would be t)eele«i to bandy words, sir. I didn't come here to do that. Will you tell me where she is ?" " No." " Then it is to be a duel between us - c that so V You for the girl's body and me for her soul ? Very well, I take your efcallengo." . tliere was silence once more, and John Storm's eyes wandered about the room. They fixed themselves at length on tho sketch by the pier-glass. " O» my former visit I met with the same reception, sir. The girl could take care of herself. It was no- business of mmc, How that relation has ended I do not ask. But this one " "Tills one U an entirely different matter, sir," said Drake, "and I will tuank yon not to—" But John Storm was making the sign of the croe<? on hi* breast, and saying. <vi one who was uttering a prayer, "God grant it fas and always may be !" At the next moment he was gone from the room. The two men stood where he had left them until lib foot steps had censed on the stairs, and the door had cloecd behind him. Then •Drake cried, "Benson—a telegraph form ! I must telegraph to Koenlg at once." ."Yes, he'll follow her up on the tiottble quick," «ald Lord Robert. " But what matter ? 'His face will be enough to frighten the girl. Ugh ! It was the fa'oe of a death's 'head." "Shut up, you fool! It was the face of a god," said Drake. At dinner that night John Storm was more thau usually silent, and to break in upon Ll* gravity Mrs. Calleuder asked him what he lutended to do next. "To tako priest's orders. without delay," :he «aid. , "And wliiU, then?'! : "Then," he said, lifting a twitching. and «nfferiug face, "to make an attack (W the one mighty stronghold of tho devil's kingdom whereof woman is the direct and im mediate victim; to t*»H Society over again It Is an organised foypoortsy for the punrait and demoral isation of woman, and the Church that ■bachelorhood Is not celibacy, and poly gamy is against the laws of God; to look and search for the beaten and broken who He scattered and astray in our bewilder >d cities, and to protect them and shelter them whatever they are, however low they nave fallen, be cause they are my sister*, and I lovo them." " God bless ye, laddie ! That's spoken like a man !" said the old woman, rising from her seat But John Storm's pale face had al ready flushed up to the eyes, and he dropped hi* head as one w3io was •«hamed.
