LAL LAL. (FROM OUR CORRESPONDENT.) On Good Friday a team of cricketers from the Newport workshops visited Lal Lal and played a match against the locals, with the following resu lt :—Newport—1st innings, 69; Lai Lai, 124. J. Goddard 40 and C. Mitchell 32 were the principal eoorers for Lai Lai. The feature of the match was the excellent wicket keeping of Robert Barnes, of the Lai Lai team. The visitors were supplied with an excellent repast by Mr G. Way, of the Railway hotel, and were loud in their praises of the treatment extended to them—so in all. In the evening the visitors, forming themselves into a dra matio club, gave an excellent entertainment. The proceeds were to be devoted to the Bal larat Hospital, but I am sorry to say that institution will not benefit very much, judging from the poor attendance. ' Re ligious scruples doubtless kept many away. Thß performers acquitted themselves very creditably in the following programme:— Overture (piano), Professor De Varney; songs, “ The skipper” and “ The sleeping camp,” Mr W. J. Jones; recitations, “ The cork arm” and “ Cricket at Killaloo,” Mr W. Bunn; song, “Paradise alley,” Mr F. Lewis; songs, “Queen of the earth” and “You’ll remember me,” Mr J. Hermsn; song (comic), “For me,” Mr W. Harley; song (comic), Mr L. A. Riley: comic sketch, “The ghost in the pawnshop,” Messrs Copplestone, Bunn, and Keenan; farce, “ April fools,” Messrs Hillman, Down, and Bunn; and farce, “The dustman’s revenge,” members of the company. The visitors left Lai Lai next morning in two carryalls for Bnninyong, where they played a district eleven. The whole affair was carried ont throngh the exertions of Mr Will. Thomas, of Newport, formerly of Ballarat. Next Saturday the'Lai Lai cricketers visit Ballarat for the purpose of playing the Press. A good game should be the result. There is some talk of working the local railway station shorthanded. More abont this in my next.
