' ONLY 3. GHOST.' TO THE EDITOB OF THE ' ' TEIiBGBAPH.' _ Sm, — I boliovo in ghosts. I believe that men can walk tho earth after they die ; but I don't ? credit the statement that a man walks the earth beforo .ho is born. However, hoar what your : contemporary says of the birth and lifo of Horace Groely. In tho first placo it states that Horaco was born in 1831, and then very saga- - eiously observes, ' consequently he must havo been 61 years old when he died.' Now, to ar rive at such a conclusion, would b» as puzzling ? ' as to comprohond WilcookB1 letter of yoster day, relating to a calculation of foot and -links. But here comes the most mysterious part. 1-l1 In 1825 Horaco was in Vermont with his parents.' This, of course, would be six years before he was born, unless it affirms the question asked by Nioodomus — ' Can a man be born a second time?' Of course if you oredit thiB,' your mind will be prepared to acoept as a faot tho next statement, that ' in 1831 (the year ho was ' firstborn in) ho orriyed in New York, and, ia1 1834, being then of tlio tender ago of throe years, he entered into partnership with a large firm. It is - a pity that tho writer should have devoted so much titno narrating the Hfo of Mr. Grcoly_ from a period of one to threo years, when it would have been moi'o interesting to have given us the six years boforo ho was born, or tho twonty jears that appear to bo required to make Mr. Greoly 61 years of ago. As Sir R. R. Mackenzio UBod to say, tho ' weather is so confusing ;' perhaps this may have something to do with tho fog that tho historian got into. Yours, &c;, PSYCHE.
