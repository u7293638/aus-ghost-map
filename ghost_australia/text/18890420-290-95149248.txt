All the anecdotes told in America on the subject of Boston are satires upon the pra sumjptuouB character of the Bbstonian, who considers Boston the centre of the universe.

'Hello!' from the other end. ' Is that you, Artemisia ?' '- Yes, dear.'' 'Well, my love, and how do you like it up there ?' ' Oh, it's very nice, of course ; bat it isn't Boston.' An agreeable young man waB calling with due ceremony on a nice girl the other evening, when her brother Tom, just arrived home from, college on the evening train, rushed into the room and embraced bis sister. 'Why, how plump you've grown, Edith !' he exclaimed. 'You're really quite an armful !' 'Isn't she 2'' exclaimed the agreeable young man, and then he felt a chill racing down nis spinal column. 'That is.' he stammered, 'I've no doubt o£ it — I ? ' The brother looked carving knives at him and the maiden blushed furiously.. ' I mean— er,' Baid he, ' I should judge so.' Wife (IL30 pm)— 'Whafs that honiii odor? Smells like alcohol.'' Husband— - i'Y-8-8, my dear, we use alcohol at the lodge for initiations.

At that moment the man came round the corner, smiling with delight and both hands ready for shaking, and aB he halted he said—' WelL boys, I got there.' 'You bet you did,'' shouted the four in chorus. 'And I want you to drink with me,' 'You bet we will!: Hurrah for you!' And they drank his beec and said they had rather Been all the rest of the ticket defeated than to have him get left, Before Prince Bismarck reconstructed the- map of Europe and made a united Germany a dozen little principalities used to annoy travellers by stopping them at their frontiers until they had satisfied the Custom-house demands, A Yankee once had his carriage etopped at tbe frontier of a petty prince's country. The Herr Ober-Controlleur at the Custom houee came forward, and much to bis indignation was received in a nonchalant, way. The Yankee was ungentlemanly enough not to get out of the carriage or even to take off hiB hat. The Herr Ober sharply demanded, the keys of. the tourist's trunks, which his sub ordinate began handling roughly. ' Here, hands off!' shouted the Yankee. 'I didn't come from the United States of America to be controlled by you. Put those trunks back. Ill not go through you at all. I'll turn bask. I'm in no hurry, and don't care for losing a. day. You're no country — you're only a spot. I'll go round you.' Aud he did. Peter De Wint, the artist, always had a. show at home before 'sending in day' to the Water- color Exhibition. He arranged his rtroductious in his drawing room, markiiur those sold with a little white label. At these private views it was the habit of a wealthy acquaintance to lament year after year that this or that 'perfect gem' was beyond his reach, being decked with the ticket. Such a game was a dangerous one to play with Da Wint. After this little device had done duty some balf-dczen tames he determined to be even with its inventor. The day came round foe another private view. The friend arrived and went into raptures before a pair of labelled ? drawings. 'Now, De Wint,' he exclaimed, ' those are exactly the things I should like to poeeees. ' What a pity they are sold 1' ' My dear fellow,' said -the painter, slapping him oa the shoulder, 'I knew you would like them, so I put the ticket on to keep them for you I' Tableau 2 But the drawings had to be taken i 'othervtise,' De Wint would conclude, 'I would have shown him the door.' Josh Billings was one hot day out for a long walk, being followed by a very shaggy, pccr-lookisg mongrel of a dog, worth about 10 ctnts for the value of bis skin, and chanced to roue upon a wayeids inn, at which » number of students were washing the dust from thtir throats. Whether it was this Bight which made him feel dry or whether he really waB thirfty ia not recorded, but certainly he went in, and, standing apart from the noisy students, called for a drink of beer. Oaeof the students happening to notice Josh, and thinking from hiB homely-looking dresB that he wsb a poor man, meant to have some fun with him ; so going up to him he said, ' That's a fine dog of yours, my man.' 'Yes, air,' eaid Josh, ' I wouldn't take 20 dollars for that dog.' What ! not take 20 dollars for a thing like that.' ' No.' 'Well, look here, I will fiive you 20 dollars for him.' 'I won't take it.' The student thinking that the sight of the money would be more tempting to catch the old man telling a lie, counted out 30 dollar pieces, and making a pile of tbem, said, ' There, old man, won't you part with your dog for that pile of money.' ' No,' said Josh, ' I said I wouldn't take 20 dollars for him, and I won't because he aint worth it,' then dexterously knocking off the top coin, he swept he remaining 19 dollars into bis pocket 'I don't mind parting with him for that.' Tae tudentsaid that he was 'done,' and amid he derisive laughter of bis companions turned the dog into the street: The animal did not &t; sny time belong to Josh, bat had followed Lino upon his way. ALBX-AND-HEB. There was a\:b.ap who kept a store, And though there might be grander, He sold biB goods to all who came, And his name was Alexander, He mixed his goods with cunning hand, He was a skilful brander ; And, since biB sugar was half sand, They called him Alex-Sander. He had hie dear one, and she came, And lovingly be scanned her ; He aBked her would she change her name, Then a ring did Alex- hand her. ' Oh, yeB,' said she, with smiling lip, ' If I can be commander ; ' And w- they formed a partnership, And called it Alex and her.
