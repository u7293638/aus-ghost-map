TYRANNY IN AUSTRIA. [From the AVtos of the World. Mav 25.1 U hat ne predicted a fortnight ago has already come to pasa. The excitement produced in every class of society in Amtria by the return to the worst traditions of Austrian histmv to h*,™,,^ Ao~ cnption. I he Bishops themselves are frightened, and are publishing apologies end explanations to allay the fears of the suspicious. They have raised a storm, however, which they will not find it so easy a matter to still. The Prince Archbishop of Vienna is the first in the field ; but his address is so poor, that it were not worth noticing but for the singularly naive consolation he offers his flock on the score of ec clesiastical punishments. ' The infliction of the public and heavier punishments of the Church,' he says, '* will not be left to the whim, pas3ion, or zeal of particular priests, but will be entrusted to the Bishops, *whora the Holy Ghost hath ap pointed to rule over the Church of God.f (Acis, c. xx., v. 28.)' The quotation, if such a garbling of Scripture can be so called, is the Archbishop's, not ours. The Bohemians, who have hitherto been the most devoted children of the Catholic Church, are up in arms ; and it will be weli if old /ecollections of IIuss and Z*ska do not again raise the fl-iDies of religious madness and religious wars. The German papers already announce a stir in the Greek Church. The Bishops of the nonsuited Greek Churches of Temesvar, Grosswardein, Her mannstatlt, and Czernowitz, are about to demand of the Ministers the same privileges as have been accorded to the Catholic Bishops. The Saxons, devoted adherents of Austria, are still stout Pro testants; and it is really pitiable to see the struggle between their loyalty and their frar of Catholic persecution. The latter feeling, however, seems to h;ive got the mastery. The begin to doubt the word of their Emperor, and declared it is impoa. tible to contemplate the effects of this new mea sure in Transylvania without a shudder. More chains must be forged for poor Austria. She hits dared to move her giant limbs. They must be bound down, weakened, crippled.. Count Thun's retnedv for revolution among the lower clergy is exceeded by his nostrum for curing all tendencies to freedom of thought in the minus of the Catholic youth. Education in Austria is to be entrusted to the same fostering episcopal care. Freedom of instruction is one of the first principles of the Charter of the 4th of March ; and yet in the name of that Charter, the Emperor now ordains that — 1\. No one shall be appointed teacher of the Ca tholic religion in any public school without the pprmission of the Bishops. 2. The Bishop has the power to take away the permission — temove the teacher — when he pleases. In like manner, the theolopic.il teachers can only follow such classes as the Bishop shall permit ! even the class-books are subject to his censure ! In the lower, or the people's schools, say the Bishops, the religious education has hitherto been under the direction of the Catholic clergy ; but, for the future, this must be extended to the middle and higher schools. Instead of one teacher named by the Government, and exercising no influence in the general direc tion of the schools, the Bishops are in future to have two in each Gymnasium appointed by the Bishops, mixing in the management of the school, and teaching in the other branches also, to give them more influence and authority. By means of these two agents and spies, the Bishops no douut calculate, and justly, on soon getting the who'e direction into their own hands. As an apt com mentary on the spirit in which these changes have been effected, we may mention that an exceedingly popular and liberal Professor of Theology, Sidon, lias just been removed from his chair, and de prived of his pension, because, according to a Bohemian journal. '* in the Diet he sat somewhat more to the left than Bishop Przem-sl, and ven tured to sprak in favour of emancipating education from the Church, r.nd granting greater freedom to the lower clergy.' The Jesuits, too, who had been expelled from Austria for more than the last half century, have been readmitted ; and are flocking back in shoals. We shall soon find them ugain at the head of the educational establishments. The violation of the spirit and letter of the Con stitution of March displayed in these concessions to the Catholic hierarchy, is greater even than would at first sight appear. The exceptional po sition of Austria at the present moment, and the impossibility of calling a Diet, has been some ex ruse, even with the greatest sticklers for constitu tional form 8, fur the provisional publication of certain laws without which the State machine could not have moved. But even the most despotically inclined are startled by this total rupture of the bonds which subjected in some degree the Church to the State; and especially by the indecent haste which has pressed it forward without the slightest plea of urgency. So weighty a matter would surely have kept, till the feelings of the people had been consulted, and their consent obtained. Nor is this the worst aspect of the question. Other laws have been declared only provisional, and re quiring confirmation by the Diet ; this one is ab solute ; and should the Diet at any future period wish to reverse the decision and .return to the laws find conditions under which the Church has hi therto moved, it will not be found so very easy a matter.
