TO THE EDITOR. Sir-If our highly estimable and much valued friend, the Rev. Morgan Williams, had searched the whole world for an argument in favour of the belief that the Bible Translation Society is not sectarian, he surely could not have found one more to the purpose than that which forms the gist and culminating point of his letter in your issue of the 13th inst.. In the part referred to he is endeavouring to prove that none but Baptists could be in favour of translating the word "baptize" so as to sig nify the covering of the whole body, and thus he says - "For men to propagate one view and prac tise another would be to convict themselves not only of inconsistency but of dishonesty." From such imputations, however, we step aside, and simply make reference to the rubric of the Church of England, where it is directed thus:-"And then, naming it [the infant] after them (if they shall certify him that the child may well endure it) he shall dip it in the water discreetly, saying , -' I baptize thee in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost.' " The word " baptize " then, as by law established, means to dip. But, I ask, is the view thus propagated carried out in practice? We call upon the uni verse to witness, and answer- "No!" Yours truly, JAS. STOBIE.
