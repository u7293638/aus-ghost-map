Electricity and telephones are pursuing the brilliant course of their triumphs, new apparatus for the popu- | landing of both coming into existence every day, A j new method of producing gas from coal has been invented by a French chemist, and promises brilliant rose suit?. By this new system the coal produces from 25 to 75 per cent, more gas than it can be made to yield by the ordinary method, and the gas thus produced U . much whiter and clearer, and is free from all danger of explosion. The coke thus obtained is equally superior, as the coal is not deprived of any other element than its gas on the other hand, the coal-tar element disappears almost entirely. The inventor of this new system is patenting his discovery all over Europe, and expects to revolutionise the production of gas.
