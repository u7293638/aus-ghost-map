NAPPING IN CHURCH. A writer in Temple Bar r* lates some anec dotes about celebrated persons caught nap ping. Mrs. Carlyle, with wliom bad nights were the rule, one Sunday afternoon de liberately took a nap. And tlie recording angel no doubt made light of the offence on the pari of the tired hard-pressed woman, if he did not actually blot it out. This is how she confesses it, with not the smallest show of compunction, in a letter to her husband. " When the sermon Iwgan I made myself, at the bottom of it (the HuIters' deep pew), a Bort of Persian couch out of the praying cushions ; laid off my bonnet, and Btretched myself out very much at my ease. I seemed to have bÂ»en thus just one drowsy minute when a slight rustling and the words, ' New to Father, Son, ami Holy Ghost,' warned tne to put on my hornet, Btid made me for the first time aware that I had been asleep." Sir Henry Hawkins has purchased an historic mansion at Farnham. It was the residence ol Sir William Temple, who was frequently visited by Dean Swilt; and Stella lived in a oottage on the property. Sir William Rose was the last owner.
