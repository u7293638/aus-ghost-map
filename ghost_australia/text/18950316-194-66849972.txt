Spiritualistic Frauds, \Ir Maskolyno, in an interview which appears in the "English Illustrated Mangazine," gives the following account of how he first began to suspect the bona fides of spiritualism :-'" The first awaken ing of my interest in the exposure of spiritualistic frauds arose in this way. It was during my apprenticeship. Adja cent to our place of business there resided cures yi table- t rr amusement, and the Fox family d startled America by a second edition-of the " Cock-lane Ghost.' Well, these mesmerists commenced to hold spiritual iatic seances, and one day the woman brought to our shop what she cnlled a surgical appliance to be repaired. It con sitted of two levers, a long one and a short one, each mounted upon a pivot attached to a strap, and connected by a piece of catgut. As you may suppose, I en tirely failedto eewhat kind of surgicalap pliance this thing cou!d be, and wascurious to discover its real use. Having re paired it, I devoted a few minutes to experimenting with it, and found that by buckling the strap of the short lever round the left ankle, and that of the long -lever round the leg just below the knee, by pressing the right heel upon a projec tion at the side of the short lever the long one could be jerked up and made to striik 'the?stnJdr-side -or the table. Accord inely, I booked it as a table-rapping apparatus, and the bill was sent In: ' Re pairs to table-rapping apparatus, is. 6id.' This I considered very sharp on my part at the time; but it was about the worst thing I could have done, as it pre vented a complete exposure of these im postors being male. Although several persons, at my suggestion, attended the seances afterwards, with the object of catching the lady red-handed, no table rapping was ever attempted. This was a.lesson by which I profited, greatly in my subsequent investigations." 0-
