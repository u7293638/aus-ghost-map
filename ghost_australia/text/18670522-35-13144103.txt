SLAVERY IN THE SOUTH SEAS. f To the Editor of the Hera! I. Stn-Our mail arrived here yesterday, and in looking at it Build for January was, 1867, I was somewhat startled is acting "Shanty in the <SJ//:/I Sis," and reading on and finding that It had particular reference to FIJI, I was more astonished, and still more to find the letter was from my respected brother, the Rev W M'Cullagh, 65th vtLom I have corresponded on the subject Now I have doubt as to the motive which has called forth this letter, neither will deny) the necessity) of watching over the weaker races in these seas , but the want of information on the subject, so far as Fiji a concerned, has misled your correspondent, and the statements may mislead others, and cause unnecessary anxiety M) only object in we ing, is to give you come information, and to assure our friends in the colonies, as well as all lovers of humanity, that we, the Wesleyans Mr s-ionanes, will not flinch from our duty, when duty calls" My remarks shall be seen and mi sale n nts such as can be treated if needed, indeed I could fill a column of your invaluable paper with letters and documents, from the planters themselves, which would prove their humaneness and Christian feeling towards the loans man, as well as that prudence which guards self interest. On the arrival of the first lot of imported labour we made inquiry at the Consulate as to how the men were chained, and found it was by the consent of the Consul", end that the matter was being watched We felt it was in safe hands, and that us any abuses might arise wool) Lad to represent There, and redress would soon be granted As the Commodore will shortly visit, and the whole system be laid before him and he will no doubt report accordingly, I need not refer fully to con ular action in the case It is something as follows Versus procure a certificate and promise to make engagement 1 through an in- interpreter, take care of the men on the voyage", register them at the Consulate before landing at the plantations, and return them at expiration of term This met the case at the first while the nurmWof the men was small, but certain evils have been arising, which call for further punning the system, and laws have under can s deration for some months, and are now in course of adoption. So far as my own experience and information go the more I are well treated on the whole, and much improved by their stay in Fiji, and I believe, under judicious management the fathers DIB) be made a mutual benefit I ha rain brought here are all heathens, and of the w eldest apple crops I shall not soon forget going OF board a vessel loaded with keen men a few months ago I found many could talk English h while their Lcalhenish appearance was most alarming So much for vaunted civilisation We are all acquainted with the difficulty of teaching these men at their o vi land but I believe if teachers could be supplied who understood their language much influence might be gained over them in this strange kind indeed some few have already become Christians, and attend our Fijian service, while the most of them look infinite]) better than on their arrival I have already written to the Brethren occupying those islands, recommending then to send teachers, for whom we would care and help on from one plantation to another, and in every way forward our great cause , but should they not be able to send teachers we will still do our best to Chris name and otherwise case for these men I amnotadvo c ing the doing evil that good may come I would not try to make that appear a lYci science which tramples on man's right But I unbelievers taking advantage of every circumstance which gives the opportunity of doing good to our fellow men I believe this Tanoa labour says ear to be one. history is out of the ip question Let us have no cries of " Wolf" But, if there by a cause, we will move heaven and earth on behalf of the wronged. We have no trees here or Uncle Jesus, so do not 1 to their ghosts trouble our Christian people in the colonies, As to Lrgrecs, the Fijians three elves would teach such men if an) should arise among us ' Our young men need "reed up" in the great speeches of the great u co who never then until they saw the Opas system of slavery Eappcd and heard by faith its crash But if all lovers of animal) will ere the calmer, safer, and more urgent duty of proving and putting the shoulder to the wheel, and helping all our national) institutions in the South Seas, we shall soon too a more dreadful slavery that of sin, heathenism, and Satan swept away, and the Christian religion with all its blessings tilling these In civ lines I now give you a few extracts from letters, which you can use just as you please The) will show two things at least, viz that there has been sortie abuse of the j them, and that twill not be allowed with impunity Ina fact of a few abuses and a little irregularity should no stamp this system as slavery A little time will demonstrate that neither- cflluaN, planters, or missionaries are indifferent to the rights of these islanders in for the present I beg to assure all our Chris ian friends and fellow labourers that we are at our post and doing duty In conclusion I should deprecate anything that should disturb the present promising, results to in n) of our most worthy planters Patience, perseverance and toil is now about to be rewarded with a good profitable crop of cotton, and nothing but the want of steady labour with God's blessing eau prevent many from becoming rich men. The cotton planting is proved a since a cooee, eVc, will soon follow, as in and are used to meet the nee "Mary expense Native Govern mints are Long forced wah liberal laws, lands are being thrown open at Is per acre arrangements are being made for Fijian labour and on the whole I think, there is much to encourage the settlers- and our whole community.
