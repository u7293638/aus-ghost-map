THE QUEEN'S JUBILEE. FURTHER CELEBRATIONS. UNITED THANKSGIVING SERVICE AT THE TOWN-HALL. AN IMMENSE CONCOURSE IN ATTEND DANCE. One of the most remarkable features in the celebration of her Majesty's Jubilee in Melbourne was seen last night when a united thanksgiving service, in which all the leading Protestant denominations took part, was held at the Town hall Before the chair was taken at eight o'clock, every part and corner of the hall was taken up 'The gallery was very Booncrowded, and the audience overflowed the platform, till the committee were obliged to close the doors, and to refuse admittance to the hundreds who were still seeking an entrance The congregation was undoubtedly the largest which has ever assembled in Melbourne, and numbered between 1000 and 6000 persons The chair was taken by the Bishop of Melbourne (Dr Gee) and on the platform were the great majority of the Protestant clergymen of the me tropobs, the President of the Legislative Council (Sir James MacBain), Mr Francis Ormond, M.L.C., and many other prominent citizens. A large united choir, formed by the following churches and under the leadership of Mr T IH Guenett was stationed upon the platform -St. Paul's Church of England, St. Johns Church of England, Scots Church, the Toorak Presbyterian Church, Wesley Church, the Collins street Congregational Church, the Collins street Baptist Church, and the Albert street Baptist Church Mr J T. R Edeson presided at the organ, assisted by Mr W G Turner Mr J BALFOUR, M L. C , said that he had been asked to intimate that Lady Loch regretted that she had so many engagements that day that she found it impossible to carry out her intention to be present at that meeting His Excellency the Governor was unable to attend owing to a previous engagement. The hymn "Before Jehovah a Awful Throne' was then sung, after which the Rev. H Herlitz read a portion of 1 salm -i, and chapter tin of Romans Prayer was offered by the Rev. J W Crisp 'The Bishop of Mlllouiinl who was received with applause, sud,-We have met together under very exceptional circumstances, and the subject may be viewed in various ways We might be regarded as a company of people come together as citizens of Melbourne, and as members of the British Empire, to thank God for the great blessings which have been so appropriately summed up in the prayer in which we have joined We might be regarded as a company of people assembled together to thank God for the long reign of our good Queen Victoria, and for the noble and virtuous (pinches she has been enabled to display during the whole of her reign to thank them for the progress made in science, in art, in literature, and in education All these things are matters of true thanksgiving to God But this meeting is unique As to do not meet mainly to thank God for such external things. We meet as members of the Church of Christ, as Christian men and women (Applause) We desire to live, we desire to work, and we hope, if God calls us to it, we should be prepared to suffer pro- cyclist Do We wish to regard the various events that take place in the world mainly from this point of view bowley affect, for weal or for woe, the fortunes of Christ's holy church ' (Applause ) We meet to thank God for the blessings bestowed during Queen Victoria s long reign upon the Church of Christ through out her empire from this point of view I cannot think of any passage in Gods ho!) word which so truly expresses the feelings with which we, as Christian people look back upon Queen Victoria's reign as does this ben had the churches rear, and were edified, and walking in the fear of the Lord, and in the comfort of the Holy Ghost, were multiplied ' (Applause.) And now, looking on this period, I think we shall have little difficulty in deciding what that substantial blessing in, which ought to stand first and foremost in our thoughts at this time, and it is this-the marvellous extension of missionary operations and of missionary efforts throughout the Queen's vast colonial and Indian empire and throughout the whole world 1 Ina lins ' cell the gr indeat feature of the whole period of the history of the Church of Christ, No former age and known anything like it, or any thing to parallel it (Applause.) The London Missionary Society can point to that grand achievement of the success of the Gospel in Madagascar, and she can point to the advance of Christian men and women to the shores of Nyassa in 1 Eastern Africa the Wesleyan Missionary Society can point to the Christianization of the inlands at 1 none of the most remarkable efforts the Christian church has known of spreading the Gospel Fund doing it successfully Scotchmen can point to the great Dr Duff, an 1 to his labours in India, and they can also point to the pedestal on which stands the statue of Dr Livingstone, m I Amburgh Hie) can show the passer by that he carries a Bible and an axe in his hand, well teaching, us that although the two of civilisation and Uniterm! improvement may cut away a vast number of abuses and ignorance and errors yet, nevertheless, that the advance of culture is of little worth unless it be accompanied by the 1 non ledge of God, in the faith which our Lord Jesus Christ reveals And, again, the Church Missionary Society can point to Imnevelly and Sierra Leone and to her work in create in equatorial Africa in the defence. and the promulgation of which the mart) red Hun nington joined the noble army at the right band of God And therefore we say that not only is this topic a most suitable one for such a meeting as this, but it is also one in which we all join, and in which God has blessed all our efforts I see a vast number of ladies here I was reading not long ago of what that veteran Indian missionary, Mr I cupold, now with God, said He said-" he cut) five years ago, if anybody had told me that the time would soon come when we should have our Christian ladies teaching the women (of India at such places as Benares, and Lucknow and Agra, and Delhi, and Peshawur, I would have said it (would have been a (grand achievement indeed, but for my own part, I felt the day was far distant Now what do we see it From Calcutta to Benares and down as low as Pittance of motor him 1 100 -mains open for Christmas ladies ( Vpplnu e ) All these things lend us to exclaim, " W line hath God wrought.' The fact is, however infidels may boast, and w hate ver and by the subtlety of the arguments they employ, the existence, and the bee, and the expansion and the vigour, and the hopefulness of the Church of Christ are the grandest and most unequivocal evidence of the divine mission of the church and we meet together on such an occasion as this to praise God for the success of his church Not long ago Professor M Williams, professor of Sanscrit in the Oxford University, addressing a grand meeting in connection with the British an 1 1 Foreign Bible Society held in ) Exeter hall, said that during the present year 10 stately volumes have issued from the port press containing the great sacre I lion Christian books of the world-the I spital a the Koran, the Vcdu, the "endavesto, and the l/ritinga-of Confucius And he said, "I have been study ing these sacred book a now for as long as 10 ears, and at one time I frankly confessed that I was nlmostdismu}ed by the fascination of the study, 1 found gems of thought; coruscations of light leading up into the bliiclcilorkiiessofilicBiirroiindinglicuthtniam, until at last I begun to think that the drift of some of our philosophers might be true, and that these old religions were illustrations of the law of development and evolution, and that they were intended in the providence of God to spring up from light to light and from truth to truth until they should be crowned by Cliristinnit) iib thousand substance of it fill ''But, hesnid/'Iliavclivedlongoiiougli to see the error into which I was in danger of falling I know now that the developments of these non Christian religions, however much the) may be added ure developments in the wrong direction They do not lead up to Carmarthen) lead away from Him ' the world by wisdom knows not God "And ' he added. look at such a bleat truth us this, God hath made Christ to be seen For us who knew no am Look again, ' I am the Resurrection and the Life, saith the Lord took until, '3 teeth to eat the flesh of the honor man, and drink His blood ye have no life in you There is nothing in all the non Christian sacred books to parallel, or be at all compared, with such statements as these And these statements concerning our Lord Jesus Christ create not merely a gift, but a vast chasm between Christianity and the religions of the world, so vast that it is impossible for the Christian to shake hands on the right side of the gulf with those who are on the wrong side " " and " he said " read these books if you like, and put them all on your left hand and put the Bible on the right, and see how unparalleled, how unique it is as containing the one only remedy for sin that mankind needs " (Applause ) We are allowed a very short time to speak his is a grand meeting, and calls out all the enthusiasm that a man has in him, but we must obey orders (Laughter) But I must say this, that we must remember always to unite thankfulness for the past with hope for the time to come I know of no period in the Church of Christ when she had much right to thank God and to take courage as she has now I think the words of the Psalmist will apply- 'God hath been mindful of us He will bless us ' Our blessed Lord, just before His crucifixion, had the question put to Him by His Dis ciples "Master, what shall be the sign of 'J li) coming and that question elicited a long discourse, much of which is very mysterious, but there is one saying in that discourse that seems to me not to be matinees at all, but to be as plain as it could be written It latins, ' This Gospel of the Kingdom shall be preached throughout the whole world as a tin stimony to nil n ttions, and then shall the end come " How near or how distant that end may be we cannot tell, but we see that the missionary stations of the Church of Christ girdle the Jobs the sun never sets upon the preaching of the Cross by Christian missionaries, and it that be the case in the key has been put into the hand of the Christian Church, and God has given her grace to enter in at the countless doors that are being opened, will not the time soon come was his one hope of the church in the ascended and glowing Lord shall be abundantly fulfilled and the day) shall break and the shadows shall flee away ' (Cheers ) Dr But we said here are many aspects from which we may regard the Queen's Jubilee, and I think there is no side upon which we can look at it which has greater interest and greater importance than that which is represented by our meeting to night We have looked back and have reviewed many of the conditions and events and movements of the last half century, and I think no one can review them without abundant thanksgivings to God for His good ness and mercies 'He mr has been filled with acclamations of loyalty to the Queen, not one of them too full of acclaim, too rich, too worth) for one so worthy of all that is rendered to her-(applause)-and J think we shall all the better express our feeling to her by responding to her own request, so religious find so devout, that her people should unite with her in thanks giving to God for all his mercies to her The Queen b) that act has touched the whole of this Jubilee movement with a nobler light She has given to it a devout spirit, and, instead of allowing ourselves to be lost in the mere pleasure of the hour, in the gaiety in the illumination, in the activity, in the state paLcaiury, all of which are most becoming, we should kill them with thanks giving to Almighty God Nor should we only look back. the Divine Spirit of the present hour and the thought of the Divine providence that has been ours, and is still ours, compel us to look forWard There are probably not many here to night who will see another jubilee There are some, perhaps, who may, at all events, see the close of the century of this young nations life, and as they then will review, so we may at this moment look forward a little to that coming half century M) otvniumdwas filled With this thought when I looked at that great gathering of children in the Exhibition building this afternoon (Applause ). It seems to me that of all the Jubilee rejoic England they have been great and splendid there are none that have been nobler or more fitting than the meeting this afternoon and the meeting to night. When I saw those gathered thousands and heard that grand swell of music the children s voices blending in sweetness and fulness, led with such pre- cisión-(applause)-with such wonderful rapidity of response to every signal that was made, and I remembered that that was the expression of the young religious life of this city, I took courage as I thought of the future and thanked God for the presage of good that it gave Itwasanoble demonstration, and I think the Lnhop is to be congratulated on the outcome of it (Applause ) I don't know what unbelief may have to do in the future, but I am not much afraid of the workings of unbelief if we can only show such great masses of these young hearts full of the knowledge of the Gospel and inspired by the grace of God (Applause) And so, while looking back and thanking God for what He has done, we are not going to believe that the past has been more glorious than the future, will he but rather that there will be richer and fuller blessings at the time to come than there have been in the list ( Applause ) We nui) until, too not only of the past or the future, but looking round us, standing upon such a platform as this to night, we may well feel greatly encourage 1 The bible says that if a man desire the office of a bishop he desireth a good work Now I don't know that the Bishop will ever discharge a nobler or a better day) than he has done to much in press ling over such a gathering n Christians. (Applause.) And this is one of the significant features of our time While the decision i tional hues, I think, are being drunk sharply and strongly, yet granted those lines, they are not so high as that we cannot shake hands over them, and join together for a great common purpose (Applause ) If this Jubilee fulfils no other purpose, it will do great good in showing that, forgetting that we are scour lied we can all meet to night as brethren to think God for His common good to us all But there is one aspect of our time I must mention, and I think in doing so I would be very much in harmony with the spirit of the Queen, and with very much of the spirit of this age There is a marked; passage in II delicate state, that great romance of Goethe's, so full of knowledge of human nature and instruction to man, where W Wilhelm Meister le trust threefold culture He shows a sort of vast college, and the children in it are the Jet, first of all, reverence to that which is above them, and they left the hand find worship Then they go a step further, and learn reverence to that which is upon a level with them and they extend the time to grasp the ot a brother Later still comes the third Baron and the most difficult of all for them to learn, and that is reverence for we line is beneath them, But the children are tim Jit to place the Ininti downward, as if in help Now it seems to me that during the last half century in the period which the Queen's Jubilee closes in 1 inland and! throughout all the empire this has been learnt, not only greater reverence for what is above, not only greater respect for others upon a level with us, but also greater river once for w h it is beneath (Applause) In deepest, sympathy, compassion, and help, Men are born unit to remember the prisoner -not only that he should be punished, but, if possible, that he should be redeemed, (apulause)-to remember the orphan, not only that he should play a part in some romance of sensibility or some picture of artistic skill, but that there should be thrown round about him the arms of a tender fatherhood and motherhood, and that the children who have lost their parents may yet led that they have found many a parental heart in the pit) and love that are shown them 'They are beginning to have sympathy with all those who are in distress I could not help reading with the idea post emotion thcniiountofnbini-uctwli its toil, plate in this city ada) or two ago While a great civic banquet was proceeding there was another r not of the great and famous not of the well known and the wealth) but of the outcast, the street wanderer, and the released prisoner I thought there was scarcely anything in all this Jubilee more siLiiilieaiit-I am not (quite sure whether there was any thing, over which the Queen herself would more rejoice than that exhibition of tenderness and pity for the outcast and the lost. (Applause) This is one of the lessons which have been learnt during thelnsthitlf century) Mr nsheiirtshnve been touched and made pitiful So we are gathered here to night us a great brother hood-gathered round about the leading Christian p sister of the city as representatives of the various churches, and lifting thanks toGodtornll His wirelessed rev len tug the past v Uli gratitude, find looking forward to the future, with hope, with hearts pitiful, tender, a apathetic towards those who are in need and distress, not only physical but moral, and so as it seems to me, main testing more of the spirit of Jesus Christ than we can in any other fashion in our place amongst men (Loud applause ) The hymn, "All hail the power of Torus' name, was sung, and prayer was offered up by the Rev Allan Webb 'the Rev Dr Cani none Lui s said I must express the great satisfaction which I beg to most of standing face to face with this great and noble meeting I believe that there was no church throughout our empire in which last Lord's Day thanks were not given to God for His great goodness to us as a kingdom and as a church I believe that in every church throughout the British Empire) our Sovereign wits worthily remembered last Lord's Day, and it is most pleasant to be here to night,hLCiuisi we are hue from different churches and from different communions, and we are here to show that we turn out", not only in our loyalty to the Sovereign, but also in devout thankfulness for those great spiritual blessings which it has pleased Almighty God during the last M years to bestow upon our country, and upon the Christian Church of our mil (Applause ) Hua Jubilee has been celebrated in many ways It has been celebrated by the loud acclaim of people, it has been celebrated by blaze of light and by roar of cannon, b) feast, and dance, and song , but we are there to show that there is a religious - especially religious - aspect in which this celebration may be regarded, and in which it ought to be regarded, and we cannot allow it to pass without dwelling- upon that religious aspect There are many points of view from which we may regard this Jubilee as a religious spirit I think that it ought to make us feel our responsibility to God as a nation There has been nothing that has occurred in the life of any of us that has given us a truer idea than this celebration of the vastness and greatness of the British Empire God has given us a great place among the nations of the earth we one be unto us is we do not feel our responsibility to the King of Kings and to the Lord of Lords There have been empires almost as great as ours in the world before, but they gave way to sin to luxury, and to forfeit! ness of God and of all above them and their candlestickwasremovedoutofitaplace Letua pra), before this celebration passes trout us let us pray earnestly to the King of Kings and the Lord of Lords that we may be filled with a sense of our responsibility to Almighty God as a nation and an people, and that we may be delivered from those vices that, see er or later, bring about national ruin and disaster (Loud up please ) There is another aspect in which this celebration may be viewed We have all been thinking much of the material progress that his attended the last 50) en a-progressive science progressive art, progressive literature, progressive discover) but we must not forget the great spiritual progress that has been made and on which you yourself, my lords worthily) dwelt at the beginning of this meeting I believe that there has been in the reign of Queen I Victoria a marvellous quid ening and after giving of religions life-the quiet ening of religious life by the Holy Spirit of God Vic- must remember that to night, and, while we think of the material progress which has marked the Victorian era we ought to offer prayers of intend.- thanks to God for the spiritual progress by which in many directions the Victorian era has been marked It has been hand ed not out) by a wonderful extension of the kingdom of Jesus Christ, but it has been marked at home by a desire to uplift the fallen and the deceased I was reading not long ago a wonderful boon!, which gave an account of society in the reign of Queen Anne's reign that is Bometinica compared with the reign of Queen Victoria. It is b) a Mr Ashton and it gives us extract from newspapers and periodicals of that time, and but presents us with a perfect photograph of the reign of Queen Anne But take that book and read it and then think of all that has been done in the reign of Queen v Victoria for the fallen and (legra led and for the little children, and how many) noble and good and great men have gone down to the haunts of vice and crime to succour and help the fallen (Applause ) There is another aspect in which I think this celebration may be regarded looking at it from a religious point of view I think that we ought to feel deep the usefulness to Almighty God for His providence in having called such a Sovereign to reign over us (Applause) It is sometimes said that the Queen is a more figurehead to the ship of state, and that she has no real power in this realm for good or for evil Those who speak that way speak the Lange ire of thoughtless an I foolish people (Applause ) Anyone who has a history 1 nowa now largely the influence of the sovereign extends throughout the community We know that there have been sovereigns upon the British throne whose influence was of the most deplorable and pernicious character, who leptacourt that was hotbed of luxury and of vice and of bin limit; God that cannot be said of our gracious queen (Applause) May we not all of us thank God that she has always thrown her influence on the side of purity of life and morals and she has banished and never suffered to intrude within the limits of the Court anything that is dissolute oran) thing that is vicious That is a great cause for the thankfulness to Almighty God that we ought all of us to feel to night I happen to be it humble member of the Royal household and I have been honoured by meeting" the Sovereign on many occasions, but am unable to say anything but that which is patent to the whole world that she is a simple minded, a noble hearted, a godly and a pious woman, who is filled with the deepest sympathy for all who have suffered, for she herself has suffered (Applause ) She has gone through great sorrows, she has lost her husband, she has lost children, and out of her own experience of for now it is that she has been always ready to feel for the sorrow s and the trials of others And more than that she has in her own actions, 80 far as she was able done everything to throw her influence on the she of good She had the benefit for years of the companionship of that noble man, 1 mice Albert (A plause ) And anyone who reads the life of that noble man must feel how great a line Its removal was to the British empire But our Queen has endeavoured day by) day to carry out all his plans, and to walk in his footsteps He should thank God that we have n Queen so simple he late 1 and so pure minded 1 She has asked for the prayers of the people Oh ! of) friends, will you not give her yours' Will you not as Sunday b) Sunday comes round, and the prayer for the Queen is offered will you can't put your beans into that prayer' She needs ) our pra) era in a special manner, to the life of a sovereign is to a great extent a very lonely one Iriythut to her declining years she may be strengthened by the grace of God, that at eventide it may be lovely with her one. that havill) she and pass away in the love and the affection other people to exchange the e irish crown for the heavenly and incorruptible (Cheers ) The choir then sing the II Hallelujah Chorus, after which the audience joined in the National Anthem and the proceeding were closed with the benediction which was pronounced by the Bishop of Melbourne.
