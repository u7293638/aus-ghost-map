To aid. the effort with .capital is invariably :the most efficacious way to kill it. Two' evils Heoat the root of this healthy fraternity in Fraance-the want of patience and the introduction' of politics'? It is abstract, not practical lolitics that form the fault in crery strata of French society; as for pai tience to await results, it is a contradictory ele-' meit.' Theru'is not i people 'in' the world inmore industrious than the French ; if not hard, theyarei constant workers: Frci ea'rly mo'rn till ileviy'ev e they keel pegging away ; with light hearts they accotmlish their daily toil, and, however littlenaiiy he the recompense, some traction is always laid by for the 'rainy daiy Eigland divides'hel penny into fourths, France into tenths; the Briton.per-& Isaps takes iro note of the farthings, the Gaul treasures the centimes, knowing that one hundlred of them: tmakes a franc. There is no trade in Paris offers so many.advan tagea ford the success of the co-oplertive principle as that of the bakers; it has-anything but sinll prolits, and certainly its returns ale quick ; it jiwould not have to encounter any guildopposition; 'oice centime or five less in the pound weight of bread eould draw all Paris. But the bakers' will oiit club together ; they are in full'war at present over' night work-of course, divided. The .6,000imeni bers of the co-operation fight as Guelfs and G-hi. belin;es. Like the butchers, the bakers are a very orderly set of men, and eschew politics.' One party desires to finish work before midnight? in stead of then commencing. The Commune by a decree abolished night-work in the bake-hoii?s,amid; out of gratitude' the bakers persisted 'in folloiving tlhe old plan.., Employers are neutral'in the di' pi te; they have" only to keep their' sholis ope From 6 a.m. to 10 p.m., as required by law.. The aen are paid according to the number of laoynavles baked, and since Paisins must have their. fancy hot rolls every morning with. their ei?fia?t lait,' their wishes must be complied with; If, as "it is asserted, the ols, large as well as small, can be so, preserved as to admit of .being baked equally well in the afternoon, the matter can. be easily tested. Freilch breadl is very lighti' almost " savoury" ihen .fresh, but after twelve :horschanges inte something very unpalatable. Dutch harm is used or leavennug, and. wood ever- for cooking, -:The. bakers work in a state of nudity nearly, with the Ghost of kilt; ii this state they will pass into the street, to the" wine-shop to slake their thirst, ir respectivo of weather.

This will largely correct the ,want'of. dicilplino in the French army, but above all will put an end: to th career of the political general,' whose place is with his men--not in the Assembly, where partizan polities reduces' his influence to a aonentity. :'MaeMahon is 'a more respected than an able soldier, amnd lie is respccted: lecause he keels aloof from politics.
