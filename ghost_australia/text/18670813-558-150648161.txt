POST OFFICE SCANDAL AT MEREDITH. L . ? TO THE EDITOR OF THE ADVERTISER. Sir,-Allow ine to correct a misapprehen sion which has crept into your leading article of Saturday in reference to the post-, office scandal at Meredith. It is m reference to the. charge qf debauchery, 'rijis oharge in its simple form was never made by me. The following words occur in my letter to the Adcertiaer of Aug. 2:-"Public senti ment is thoroughly debauchcd-on the very borders of infamy." In the advertisement calling the meeting cn the Gth Aug., the opposite party made this equivalent to a charge of debauchery, and by dissociating it froth "public sentiment," and' coupling it with "drunkenness," they have obviously conjured up a ghost of their own.- Finding 'that the bar of public opinion in Meredith was just the bar of the postmaster's public house, I pronounced such public sentiment to. bo in a debauched. condition. Unfor tunately for the credit of Meredith the evidence now of the triith"of~>rhat"I have said is lrjorc complete than when I wrote theietter of the 2nd August.' Begging to thank you most cordially for the light which you have thrown uimri a local evil, I am, &c.;,_ : ; JrETEB M'Pkeusojt. . Manse, Meredith, Aug. 12,1SG7.
