SELECTED POETRY. THE ALBUM. My photography album ? Certainly. You cau look, if you wish, my dear ; To me it is just like a graveyard, Though I go through it once a year. Any new faces ? No, indeed. No, I stopped collecting some years ago. And yet, Jeauette, look well at the book, It is full of histories strange ; The faces are just an index, dear, To stories of pitiful change — Drama and poem and tragedy, Which I alone have the power to see. Ah! I thought you would pause at that face; She was fair as a poet's lay. The sweet rose of her English home ; Yet she perished far, far away, In the black massacre at Oawnpore Sue suffered and died — we know no more. And that ? Ah, yes, 'tis a noble head ! Soul sits on the clear, lofty brow ; She was my friend in the days gone by, And she is my enemy now. Mistake, and wrong, and sorrow — alas ! One of life's tragedies — let it pass. This face ? He was my lover, Jeanette, And perchance he remembers to-day The Dassiouate wrona- that wrecked us both When he sailed in his angev away. Hcavt-sickand hopeless through weary years, At length I forgot him — despite these tears. That handsome fellow ? He loved me too, And he vowed he would die, my dear, When I told him '? No !' 'tis long ago : He married the very next year. That oue I liked a little, but he Cared much for my gold, nothing for me. Brides and bridegrooms together, dear, And most of them parted to-day ; Some famous men that av« quite forgot, Some beauties faded aud grey. Close the book, for 'tis just as f said — Full of pale ghosts from a life that's dead. — Harpers Weekly.
