HOW A GOOD SHIP WAS LOST. On the night of October 27th, 1842, the good ship " Mary Compton," of Bristol, Eng- land, was strugling with a fearful gale off the coast of North America. The wind blew fur- iously, but the weather was clear, and the Cap- light in the lighthouse on the Iron Rock Shoals This lighthouse marked the entrance to the harbour. Once, there, and they were safe. Sure of his position, he sailed on confidently. Five minutes later the ship struck with a fear- ful shock and went to pieces. Four men, in- cluding the Captain, were saved. On reaching the shore they found a strange thing had hap- pened. An enemy of the lighthouse keeper had bound him hand and foot and extinguished the light. Souls, as well as ships, steer by the lights. Hope is the most important lighthouse in the world. What shall be said of the man who darkens it in the face of a storm-tossed spirit? " You are beyond human aid? " These words were said by a physician to a woman who had come to consult him. Admitting that he thought so, had he the right to say so ? No ; for he might be wrongâ€” and in any ease he had no business to put out the light. This woman had been ill for some time. In June, 1889, she was greatly alarmed by her symptoms. Her heart palpitated, and she was so giddy she could scarcely stand. Her head whirled " and," she said. " all objects seemed to go into a cloud." She had to hold herself up or sit down for fear of falling. She broke out in a sweat although cold as death. A dreadful cough racked her frame so that she could not lie down in bed and sleep. " I could scarcely crawl about the house," she says, " I was so weak. I tried different remedies and medicines without avail. I went to the Dispensary at New Brjggate and asked the doctor to tell me the worst. His answer was' ' I have' mixed' you some medicine ; you can take it or leave it. I took it for three weeks, then gave up in despair. " I talked with two other physicians. The last one said, ' You are past human aid.' " My heart sank within me, for I had five little children, and my death would leave them without a mother's love and care. I went home and cried till I was sick. I had no ap- petite and had lost flesh till I was thin as a ghost ! My Mother came to see me and did not know me. My skin was of a green and yellow colour, and when I ate anything it seemed to stick in my throat. About this time I commenced vomiting, and what I threw up was tinged with blood. Once I began to vomit at nine o'clock on a Saturday morning and scarcely got rest from it until Monday morn- ing. " At this time I remembered that Mrs. Wil- son, with whom I formerly worked in Craw- ford's Mill, in East Street, Leeds (where I live) had been cured by Mother Seigel's Curative Syrup. So I sent to Mr. Jesson's the Chemist, in Great Garden Street, and got a bottle. A few doses stopped the vomiting, and by degrees from day to day I felt better. Soon I could eat a dry crust, and by the time I had finished the second bottle I had got over all my bad symptoms, and was fast getting my strength back. I am now (April, 1890). in better health than ever before in my life. "I should have taken Mother Seigel's Cura- tive Syrup sooner, but my husband was out of work and we had only a trifle coming in from his club, but I thank God I did get it at last, and it cured me, bad off as I was. All my friends and neighbours know the facts I have related and I will reply to my letters of en- quiry." (Signed), Mrs. Ann Mills, 40, Bread Street, York Road, Leeds.
