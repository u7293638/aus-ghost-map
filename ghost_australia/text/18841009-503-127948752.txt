Not Proud of her Countryman. Sam Jones, of Gold Hill, who dearly loves a joke, has a domestio in his house who is a countrywoman of Sullivan. The other morn ing he and Evan Williams wera eating break fast , when, by a preooncerted agreement, they began a dialogue something like this, Sam leading off — ' Curious, ain't it, that Sullivan took water from that Dutchman ? ' ' Yes, indeed ; I was quite astonished. He ' Well, I don't bla'n; him. Hans ia a big man and strong as a bull, and I guess he oan lick any two men in the world, John in cluded.' ' Phat's that, Mister Jones ? ' broke in the domestic, who had been hovering about tho table, ' a Dutchman liok John Sullivan I Are yez crazy or dreaming. Mister Jones ? ' ' 'It's a fact,' said Williams. 'Hans Meyer, forman of the No. 2 crosscut, Grown Point, deposited 500 dola. forfeit to meet Sullivan, and when he saw our man he weak ened and let the money slide.' The domestic dropped a china plate on the floor, and Btood speeohless. ' He breaks all his rook :with his fist,' broke in Sam, ' and runB the Bteam drill by hand. We pay him 12 dols. a day just for the steam ho savea. Sullivan happened to como in when he was making birdseye porphyry with his fist, and I'm blamed if he didn't turn pale as a ghost.' 'Mr. Jones, if Mr. Evan Williams aays this I'd belave him, but as you say so it wouldn't go. There must be some mishtake about his bein' a Dutchman.' 'He is a Dutchman,' Baid Williams, gravely; ' or else I don't know a Dutchman wnen I see him.' 'Thin, gintlemen,' replied the domestic, drawing herself up a couple of inches higher, ' all I've got to say is that John L. Sullivan's no Irishman, and don't spake of him as one in myprisenoe.' — Carson (Nev.) Appeal.
