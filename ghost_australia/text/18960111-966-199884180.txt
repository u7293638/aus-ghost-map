THE RIDDLER. NEW PROBLEMS. 11;517. Charade, by T. E. Smyth, B.A.— Ouce on a time, no matter when or where, An editor bowed down by carkinc care, Sat sad and silent in his officc chair ; Wrinkled his brow, and rumpled w-a-s liis hair, Man was his cheek dejected was his air, Ab though his soul were sunk iu dull despair. Upon his hands he leant his down-bent head- Sadly he sighed, and to himself he said— " Is there no ray of light to pierce the gloom? No flash of fun lo make the liiddler boom? Is there no help or succour to he had? Will no one send us in a good charade?" No more, he said, for as an echo pat Smote on his ear a. gentle rat-tat-tat. And passing softly through the open door, A small hoy lightly crossed the ottice floor. ' A slip of copy in his hand he bore— A single slender slip and nothing more. Which on the table he half laid, half threw, And vrith a sunny smile inliaste withdrew. The great man eyed the slip at first askance. Then swiftly scanned it with his eagle glance, And cried aloud " By gum, the very thing; Here is the true heroic ring and swing -t The airy wit, as starbeams clear and fine; The laughter that exhilarates like wine, And the imagination all compact That fuses, fashions, and transfigures fact; The all-absorbing, all-subduing art That kindles thought and soothes and cheers the heart. There's sccoiid point and purpose in it too. Great ghost of Caxton ! this will pull u_s through. But where's the nipper goneto? Call him back. By Jove! I'll send old T.E.S. a cheque That will astonish him ; for by this Jirst I'll do the total thing for once or burst." 11.518.
