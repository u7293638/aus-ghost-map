THE HUNTERS. A LAMENT. Oh! "Why did they my Hunter stay, And keep him oil this troubled shore, When he intended to depart ? My Hunter is a dreadful bore. Tliere was a time when he was uew, He made a little harmless mirth, By his eccentric style and talk,— But that was all that he was worth. The best of sport must dreary grow ;— One could not evermore be laughing E'en at Griuialdi's ghost, were it To 3'icld us more than mortal chaffing. And so the mincing democrat— The revolutionary beau Had ceased to make the people smile, And might have been allowed to go. Now being stopped, perhaps he may Become a martyr, to the mind Of simple, easy- going- folks, Not ovenvise, but overkind :— Become a martyr—or a sort Of injured, helpless demigod ; Because oil liini, as other men, Has chanced to fall the legal rod. ()h, how I wish that he had left, Because, as I have said before, He is, and for long time lias been, A most unmitigated bore. To keep him, at his wife's request,— It was a foolish thing to do ; 'Twere better to have giv'n him way, And with him sent the " missis " too.
