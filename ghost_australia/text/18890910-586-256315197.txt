AN IRATE POET. Never, since the days of Pope and Dennis, has anything quite so savage appeared in. literature as Mr. Robert Browning's little ode, To Edward Fitzgerald," published in the last Mherumai. Mr. Aidis Wright, m his " life and Letters" of the translator of Omar Khayyam, had most incautiously admitted a hasty sentence of the ganial " Fitz," which, ran: —"Mrs. Browning's death is rather a rdief to me, I must say: no more Aurora Leighs, thank God! A woman of real genius, I know; but what is the upshot of it all! She and her sex had better mind the kitchen and the children; ajid. perhaps the poor. Except in such things as Uttle novels, they only devote themselves to what men do much better, leaving that whxdl men do worse or not at all." Mr. Browning, it seems, lighted on this unlucky passage—never, of course, meant for the public eye—and blazed forth into the subjoined volcanic verses:— To EDWAED Fftzoebalb. I cfauneed lapotx a oewliook yesterday; I opened it, and, where mviiiigCT lay "fwivt, page and uncut rage, these words 1 Teaa-" Borne eix or seven at most-and learned thereby That vou, Fitzgerald, whom by ear and eye She never knew, "thank God my wife wasdeai." Ay, dead! and were yourself alive, good Fitz, How to return you tfcnxto wrald task my wits.

Ttatteme ammixl Should a great poet thus, for a fretful phrase, avenge the dead upon the dead, by telling him who was the "best friend" of Lord Tennyson, and author, in the way of translation, of tie "one thing done divinely well," that his ghost is not good enough to spit at? Mr. Aldis Wright has certainly wnA to answer for.
