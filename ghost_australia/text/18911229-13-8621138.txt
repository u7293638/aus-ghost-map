1 i RELIGIOUS INSTRUCTION IN STATE SCHOOLS. .-. TO THE EDITOR OF THE ARGUS. Sir, As one who has had considerable experience in elementary school teaching, I venture to ask you for an opportunity of pointing out not only the futility, but also the mischievous tendency of the scheme for gil and religious instruction in state schools advocated by the National Scripture League Many good Protestant workmen have in the centre of their best room a magnificent trophy, consisting of a handsomely bound Bible, on which is often placed a wool mat and a vase of flowers! J his Bible is looked upon as the symbol of the bulwark of Protestantism, but except as a guarantee of respectability usually serves no other purpose than that of family register though there may be a vague idea or hope that it will be used otherwise some day Now, surely those who would use the Bible as a mere moral text-book with interesting stones are but one step removed from this form of idolatry God's word must be used in God g way, reverently, frequently, and as a whole is it is to be really the light of our path Using it in any other way is only to bring in that familiarity that breeds contempt Yew sensible men would maintain that torn or dilapidated Bibles ought not to be destroyed because it is supposed that scattered leaves have brought about the conversion of infidels 'The worship of the letter is very little better than that we worship of the paper and put it of must distinguish between religious teaching" and mere scripture teaching, and religious teaching to be effective can only be given by religions persons Mrs Besant, judging from her autobiography, knew her Billie far better than the average Protestant, but the knowledge certainly has not kept her firm in the faith I believe that mere Scripture teaching will make the children more ready to listen to the state cavillings of freethought, and have as little moral effect as the teaching oijEwpv tables or Shakspeare's plays the NPL asks for the instruction of the Scriptures without dogmatic teaching,, and for that purpose they appear to recommend the books of extracts used in New South Wales, is the Irish National Series Now, Sir, I would recommend every der,.) man before taking the platform of the N SEL to procure, as I have done those books from the secretary, 237 Collins street. I he first of the New Testament books is in harmonised version of a large part of the Gospels from which it is noteworthy that the following are omitted the visit of the Magi, the turning of water into wine, Jesus walking on the sea our blessed Lord's reply Robt Peters confession the conversations with Nicodemus and the woman of Samaria, the discourses on the Bread of Life, the Good Shepherd and the true vine, and four of the seven last words In place of the Ave Maria is the following paraphrase " And the cup of saluted her as one peculiarly blessed of God and intimate to her that although she was a virgin she should bear a Boil by the immediate power of the Holy Ghost and that she should call His name Jesus, which name signifies Saviour When the union had finished His annunciation, Mary said Behold the handmaid to Pp 45 It is said that no note or comment is to be made by the teacher If so, the scheme condemns itself, for mere reading round will make the lessons often unintelligible, and wearisome to both teachers and scholars But in the particular books recommended there are explanatory notes which, in several cases, are controversial and with a Protestant bias, as "we shall render the Greek words in question by the English words * repentance or Deni fence,' and 'repent' For Roman Catholics, in otuding under the words repentance or prudence, not only internal sorrow for sin, with purpose of of future amendment, but also a disposition on the part of the penitent to manifest his Inn and sorrow for sin by penitential works, do In fact Include In the word 'repent . all that they mean by the phrase 'do penance,' whereas although the word 'i chance,' according to Roman Catholic doctrine essentially implies intense sorrow for sin, It conveys to Protestant only the idea of certain austerities, or voluntary sufferings, or at least certain exercises peculiar to the Church of Rome It is obvious therefore that while Roman Catholics are in no danger of being misled by the use of the words ' repentance ' or penitence . Protestants would be in danger of being misled by the use of the words penance and do penance" P 12 ' Greater as to doctrine, John could only announce the coming of the Messiah, but faithful evangelists after Christ's resurrection could preach Christ crucified for our sins, and risen again for our justification ' P 27 "The true followers of Christ, but more especially good ministers are compared to salt and are of great use both by their teaching and example ' P 08 "By the children of this world' is meant worldly minded men, who are more prudent and diligent in their temporal concerns than Professors of religion are in spiritual matters ' P 61 And from the second volume on the Acts " Elders the , clergy ) ' P 37 " Presliylcrs or Elders A general name for those who were appointed to take charge of the churches, called so because they were usually experienced men, advanced in life" P 48 "Unto w hint to , under what name or up to what doctrine or profession were baptised ? , , . Paul then explained in what the doctrine or profession Implied In Christian baptism differed from that which was Implied in the baptism of John P 03 To break bread, i e, to partake of the Lords Supper ' P 70 The notes too often require paraphrasing, and are frequently almost unintelligible to the ordinary young teacher fig The passages enclosed in brackets in this temperate not found in some manuscripts, and there fore are omitted by many modern critics, us Griesbnch, kc -they are supposed to have been supplied from the parallel passages in Matt vi They are omitted in the Armenian and Vulgate translations Origen says that Luke has them not, though Matthew- has It is well to remember that there is no ex intention whatever of what is meant by I found version, Hheims Testament, or the words and phrases quoted above The first part of the Lords Prayer, on which this is a note, is printed tims - "[Our] rather (the art In heal an], hallowed be Thy name Tin, kingdom come [Thy will be done, as in heaven, so on earth] ' Again, at the end of each chapter a series of words is eh c, to be explained presum ' ably by the teacher according to his or her private opinion Such words as the follow Inguregiven -"Remission, '"propitiation," "profession" (Heb iv, II), mysteries," virtue," to take up His cross,' ordinances " the children of the world and the children of light, ' "Justification," "elect redeemed ministers," evangelists," pasture " Long passages are quoted from the Psalms both in the Old Testament and New testa- ment series, and in every case from the Douay version A Catholic would object to the habitual use of the names of New Testament saints without the title of Bamt pre fixed, and to the use of ordinary type for the initial of pronouns relating to the Holy Trinity Religious teaching must be dogmatical the , doctrinal), for how can the existence of God, the Incarnation, order that the bible is to be reverenced as the written word of God be said to be other than dogmas With out doctrine our religion is like a human being without a skeleton-a weak thing that cannot stand upright But these dogmas are not SUfficient. What right have I or any Christian, to teach halt or part of the faith only Christian in contending for the faith, as it Jude bids, must contend for the faith, the whole faith, and nothing but the faith I To teach Christ merely as a good example, without teaching the was we are enabled to follow His example, is not to teach Chris country, but history oils There is, perhaps, no doubt that the league represents the opinion of the majority of the colony, but I have yet to learn that the. points as vox yet the scheme seems to me to be an attempt to form a new unsacraniental religion that is dignified by the name of unsec paganism At the same time things are undoubtedly bud as they are, and the return to denominational teaching is out of the range of practical politics, and would, pi chaps, bring about a worse state of affairs May I venture to suggest, though I have been but four years in Australia, and the matter may appear to be thrashed out. a plan which may effect Hinch good and might be adopted with out any amendment or alteration whatever in the present act Let each child's denomination be entered in the general register on admission as in Queensland, and let say, two mornings in the week be set apart for religious instruction during the last three quarters of an hour, the instruction to be given, not in school but in the churches and Sunday schools of the Hermes denominations around, children belonging to any sect that does not provide such instruction to go to school at the usual hour, and to be grouped *ogctherfoi moral, object, or other lessons The ministers might be provided with printed tickets, or metal tokens, to give at the close of each lesson, different tickets being used by differ ininiHtorH, these tickets to be given to the teacher as a guarantee of its presence at a ligious Instruction Half an hour is usually quite as long as the average untrained teacher can hold the attention of children, and if the children were dismissed from the church half an hour after the school commenced they would have ample time to take their places before the second term There would certainly be some difficulties, and it would not reach all cases, but I think it has much to recommend it, for teaching is given at the right time, and by the right persons, without any opportunity for proBelj rising It seems to me to be the best way, with denominations unable to provide their own schools, of supplementing Sunday school work, and reaching the lowest stratum, that frequently receives no religious instruction and tends most to open vice -YoiirBj to , THE SOLITARY DISSENTIENT.
