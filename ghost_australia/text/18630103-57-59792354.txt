PARRAMATTA, RACES Judge Thomas May, Esq., Treasurer John Williams Esq Stewards ??; Thomas May Esq Clerk of the Course:- Jas. Cranny, Esq Amongst the numerous holiday sports pravided for the celebration of the new year, the Parramatta race meeting held deservedly a foremost place ; and all things considered the stewards have every reason to feel grati- fied at the result of their labours. The attendance was good, and the racing, for the most part, excellent, not- withstanding that the roasting heat of the weather on Thursday was scarcely adapted either for horses or human beings. The Maiden Plate fell to the Camden mare Gondola, whose great dash of foot and fine mode of going made her beforehand a very great favourite. A good race for the Publican's Purse followed, but in this Morris's horse, George the First, proved too much for his opponents, winning both beats cleverly and without any great amount of punishment or exertion. The Dis- trict Purse was won by a horse called Childers, by War- wick; and in the Galloway Stakes Matthews' famous pony Billy had to cry "a go" to White Stockings, a regular little plum of a mare belonging to Mr Foody. In proceeding to chronicle the running for the various events, we may remark ea passant that the absence of cards was much felt, the spectators having no means of knowing what animals were entered till the names were posted outside tho judge's stand immediately preceding each race. This is an omission which, on future occasions, the stewards will no doubt rectify, particularly as no outlay is involved in providing the accommodation. But that we were aware of there being a local printer at Parramatta, we should ourselves have been only too glad to strike off a few hundred cards, satisfied as we are that we should have been remunerated for our trouble by a ready and extensive sale. But leaving this subject, and congratu- lating our neighbours on the success and good order which marked their meeting, it now becomes our duty to record the issue, commencing with the FIRST DAY, THURSDAY JAN. 1ST.

It should be mentioned, however, that it was only by taking off her shoes that the winner was brought within the condition "not exceeding 14 hands." This race wound up the first day's running. SECOND DAY, FRIDAY, JANUARY 2. The weather yesterday was quite a contrast to that of the preceding day, the atmosphere being remarkably clear and devoid of that intense heat, which rendered | the first day so very oppressive. In point of attendance, the second day was fully equal, ii not superior, to Thurs- day, while so far as the sport was concerned there was a decided improvement; the first two races in particular, being of a most exciting nature. The only remarkable occurrence of tho meeting was the incident to Aaron that rather famous bolting horse ?ing brought him- is a ? This is the only accident that occurred, the sports in all other respects passing off in a most satisfactory manner. We append an account of the second day's running. First Race — The TOWN PLATE of £40, with a sweep of two sovs each; for all horses that have never won an advertised prize exceeding £50; weight for age; one event three times round the course.

' ^__¡L-_ Third Race — The Hack Stakes of £15 with ? ? for all hacks; to be approved of by the stewards; the winner to be sold after the race for £20 any surplus to go to the fund; weight for age; heats, Mr Foody Ryan's Ford, 9st 3lb... ... ... Scotchney 4 1 1 Schofield's Dorado, 9st 3lb. ... ... ... ? Gilligan's Happy Jack, 9st 3lb ... ... ... ? First heat. — The mare was ? all the way merely saving her distance in the first spurt, which was won by Ford by a length, Dorado second, and Happy Jack third. Second heat. — White Stocking was agan reserved till reaching the hollow, when she put on steam, rushed forward, and won by a length and a hal ; Dorado beating Happy Jack by the same distance. FINAL HEAT. — There was a strong suspicion abroad that something crooked was intended over this deciding heat, and that the mare was not meant to win. The horse led by three lengths to the back, when he gave, place to White Stockings, who ran in a length and a half in advance. On coming to scale, it was found that by some means or other the rider of Whitestockings had lost a stirrup and strap, and it was feared he would be disqualified for short weight. He turned the scale how- ever, and the mare was declared the winner. She was sold after the race for £42, the funds netting £21 by the event.
