He was prepared, and had been since that time, to be whatever Christ wanted him. He had related his experience to encourage others to go in for this most blessing, and if they knew as he knew how it meant the subjugation of sol" and the fulness of joy in the Holy Ghost they would not rest content without it The Rev. Rainsford Bavin announced that the united Communion service would be held at 10 30 to-day instead of at 7 a.m. as previously announced.
