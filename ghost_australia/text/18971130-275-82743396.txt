A GHOST STORY. A party of people had been tell ing ghost stories, the ghosts in every case being accounted for in some matter-of-fact way which aroused the laughter 'of the lis teners when they came to an enu. At hist the host was asked for his contribution. 'i saw a ghost once,'. he admitted, 'and although it's a -?ood while since I thought of it I can well remember my fright, I waw a boy about 12 years old, and I had ben oil fishing all clay. 1 stopped to take supper at my uncle's farm on the way homo, and after supper went out to tho barn with my cousin Sim while ho did the milking. Then Sim and I sat down in tho hayloft for a while discussing some plan, I have for gotten what, and it was dusk be fore I started on my lonely wialk home. I had never known diat it was to bo afraid, but I did remem ber, as I started down the long lano close to tho graveyard, that Borne foolish girls had said ghosts walked in that lano after dark. Just after I had turned into tho lane I saw what seomd to be a shadowy figure walking, or rather flitting, a short distance in front of me. Involuntarily I lagged a little; tho shadowy figure seemed to do the same. Then 1 hastened my stops, and still the flitting figure in shadowy garments kept before me, at exactly the same distance. In spite or niyselt I began to i'eel frightened, and when I turned out of tho hme on to the lonliest stretch of road anywhere about and saw tho hovering figure still before mo, the perspiration started out of my forehead in beads. I put up a damp hand to a still dnmper lore head and brushed away a wisp of hay which had been hanging to my hat-brim in front of my eyes! I saw no more of my ghostly com panion, it is needless to Ray, and I Avas so nsltnmed of myself that it was ^enrs before I could make up my mind to tell such a joke on my self.
