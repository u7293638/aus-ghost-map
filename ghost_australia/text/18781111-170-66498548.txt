SALti 0? bHURTHCTUNti. Polly §00 gentlemen. Including repre sentatives from all the colonies, attended the aale or Mr 0, B. Fiabrt'i herd of shorthorn cattle held on Monday, the Age t»yr, at his Woodlands estate, and it was expected that a very successful day's work would be the result; but Mr Synuot, the able auctioneer of the firm of Messrs Richard Gibson and Co., had not proceeded far when it was rident that there were very few nyen at the prices wbioh the high uolity of tho stock should hare common i ded. Tho young bulls were odorod first, and tbe priors ranged from 20 guineas for a yearling, to 06, 130, 160, and 155 for two and thne-rror-olda, untillot 17wat!offend; ohen the h ghost prior, 600 cnineas, was reanhed. This prire was obtained for Agamfinnon's Prince, red and white, liy Agamemnon (imp.), which was knockrd down lo the bid of Hmi-i Marden, Hill and Clarke, rf Sydney. Agamemnon's Prince was a fire model of the shorthorn, aud a well-grown joungster of eighteen months old, with grand frame, eood haudllng qualities, and a better develop ment of the flint than most ol the mem bers of the herd. Altrr disposing of eight other young bulls, at prices ranging from 40 to 95 guineas, it was resolved to offer some of the females of the herd, and when 6ve fine pedigreod cows bad boon sold at 70, 120, 80, 160, and 80 guineas respectively, it was apparent that tho prices oxpected would not be nearly roafised. It was therofore decidod by Mr Fither to withdraw the rest of the cattle, ond the salo terminated. Twenty four males and five females were dispowd of, and the receipts amounlod to 2280 guineas. Tbe fact that the herd ii not well known, owinc to the proprietor's m,t having hern a frequent exhibitor at stock ahowa, will account in some measure for the unsatisfactory resu't rt (hn sale.
