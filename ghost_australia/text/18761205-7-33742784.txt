THE DALAY OF THE FRENCH NATION. WE recently placed before our readers some observations on the causes which ap- <*> pear to be operating to depopulate France. Amongst the primary reasons which it is alleged contribute towwdstiwt end btne destruction of its manhood in the wan in which that nation has been engaged. In the toeament from which we quoted in onj jprenees article, it ? admitted that 4bi recent yean referred to, in which the d6c*M?e in tin naaanen of the taale youtfcsof Fnnce wm very striking, cor respond to the time of the Russian waf. It is etenfed, however, ffeattins famishes an ad?qua4e explanation of the fact. The writes urthetftitinglj weribes it to i?d laws, which, acting diicedy ?ad pwrtrtwniy upon the' pronrieton of led estate, discourage marriage, a?* so prevents the Jreiwi >of bir^s. In alluding to fee "war" theory,aeMy*: ?Wooia to (Mk wen so; brt ?n the French in tfcfe Unit of marrying at the age of !a6 yearsP They an not; BOria fact*aAey in any of tfe other cototnes tni|gnse.

Than ace so many restrictions m to inii^rjs?rTice,agei&c;^ ftc^tbat often people caaao^ marry wnen all circomstancee of a family aatare are favorable, and the jenng foQn. are agreed. The general result |s that | parents make up the maftiafes of: their • cMkiren instead of.aUowinf tium to tut ! themselves, and where marriages are began ; Without affection on either s?3e/and often 1 with positive djslike, or, jqii^e aa often. without previous acquaintance: between the (contracting patties, aoihjog better Ami I indifference and its certain Consequences can be looked for from snctraQiaabea. In ; estimating the decrease of the French , pOO^fiy foSO utCt wOCfl SOI oO^Ot to IUMW , received thegwvecMisiderntio? it desert** 'as taken by ttoetf. It it ia dwca?sed il connection with other htwi, ifetena?d to regulate different matte?*, but tend% to thessme end, ft ??mnaPi a, <erion* slfe. The writer.seems to dwell only upon a partial applicatio* of a cisar general jria ciple, tad that it, that all laws wnkh restrict the legitiniate umoaof tijn sexes produce a low condition of moral*, <W certain re?dt of which is a decline ta Hw number of birtiu. The writer contimae—* 1 French fosvaab insist sometimes more than it jastifiable on I tin enugntion of tine Genn?n pofKilation, | to escape die military regime to which the I country is condemned. Tfce fact i??artain, I but what is not less certain is that the I population of the German empire does not \ suffer any dimiaotioa. It is tibeaaa excess, : which goes off like a swam of bees, and which carries all over tile earth tike language, the manners, and the interests of Germany." Tie G&nnam; no 4oast emi gxate in huge nwubera^ and they go to ?well the population in Canada, the United States, Australia, New Zealand, and othor countries. They hare no colonies of their own, and they can scarcely be said to ataaap German manners and interests upon the countries they resort to. They become absorbed into the popalation* of tike new countries, and become part of them. They intermarry with the races which people them, and are subject to their laws. They insensiblj lose their national* dutinctivene^s in accepting tike institutions and conforming to the customs which prgvad, and*? mferge into fee masses of the states which receive titem. How far a paoeiy German ?olo?y> subject to a system of Government sach as tiMt which obtains in tine enqpire wodd succeed, can only be a matter of conjoctore. It does not seem improbable, however, that it wount eventually show some of loose symptoms of arrested development which , are apparent in French cotooks, and daaxiy traceable to experunentsl coiomaatian by a Government wholly i?Dontnt of the pro cess, instead of that healthy growth ?fc£ch i attends the efforts of a free people fast ' upon founding new homes for themselves and their descendants. It is worthy iof remark that,- nobritiManding tike enozmons annual dinx of people froa tike I British Istaaa% and which fans ?en?w?y drfrfi4 the nopolatio? of Ireland, the ag^egate mnAn of tike inhabitant* of the United Kingdom continne to augment in a greater ratio taan tisat of Gemany, with its compamtiv?ly small em^ntion, andtraaseeadai?eteiy way that of France, with no em^Bltian stall.
