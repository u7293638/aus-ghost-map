AN UP COUNTRY GHOST . \--- Maryborough has a sensation in the shape of a ghost. The story runs that a tall figure in white has of late made its appearance near Gidding's, in the vicinity of Princes' Park. It is habited in the dress of a female, and stands for hours immovable, and transfixed to one spot. Next it was seen about Blackman's Lead, and lastly it has-or sometbing very like it-turned up near the reservoir. It has severely frightened numerous individuals, and almost performed the miracle of changing the Ethiop's skin. The police have been after it, but have not succeeded in catching it yet. A blackfellow, who had evidently been very much agitated about something of the kind, appeared before the Maryborough Police Court on Monday morning, and complained of the conduct of the ghost, but his Worship (Mr Joyce) said he could do nothing for him, and advised him to catch it. -Maryborough Advertiser.
