QUEENSLAND. Brisbane files are to the 13th inst. ThoBiisiane Courier of Thursday last contains the following paragraph, with reference to the person who was lately alluded to in the telegram from Sydney :-" It is pretty well known that the illustrious stranger who lately honoured our poor city with his presence, under the style, title, and dignity of the Count von Attems, is the individual who in our Sydney telegram of Tuesday was said to have ob obtained large advances in that he managed during his short stay here to walk into the good graces of some of our citizens, and to make rather heavy drafts on their bankers. His courtship, it will be remembered, left Brisbane in that renowned craft, the Hamlet's Ghost, the history of which vessel ought to be written some day and he has last been heard of at Cleveland Bay. A warrant is out for his apprehension, and troopers have been despatched overland from Port Denison to secure him if possible before he makes a descent on our friends in Batavia. We failed to notice the count as he deserved whom he was in Brisbane, but should he visit us again, especially with the order which the Sheriff of Queensland desires to confer on him on his breast, and Mr. Seymour's decorations at his wrist, we shall endeavour to make amends for our former neglect of Son v Altesse,"
