THE RESURRECTION MAN". Perhaps you're not aware How the deeds of Burke and Hare, When they'd made a dreadful scare. Came to end. But, lest history repeat Such a cold and guilty feat, For sage and fool 'tis meet To perpend. Each his twenty guineas made Digging bodies newly laid 'Neath the sad cypress shade, Up for sale. And great scientific men Earning fame by knife and pen, Paid them often and again On the naiL Fairy Science has a claim To put sentiment to shame, Though pity, all the same, Judgment warps. So, when Messieurs Hare and Burke Did a night of digging work. Doctors'paymentdian't shirk For the corpse. But one night these digging'men Sat inside a boozing den, And with gin now and again Slaked their thirst. When one ventured to propound Bodies easier could be found Which had ne'er been in the ground Buried first. So they bought a sickly life. And, avoiding drug or knife. Made the dying body rife With their gin. Till the weary spirit fled And, the "party" being dead, To the hospital they sped For the tin. But the doctors smelt a rat And refused the money flat And said ne'er corpse like that Should come in. So the diggers, looking black. To the boozing den went back To have another crack At the gin. Then there entered men in blue (The diggers' faces bore that hue) And they bursted up this new Little game. And Messieurs Burke and Hare, To the prison did repair, While their patrons had to bear Half the blame. Ifew, the moral, it is plain To the speculative swain, Of a corpse make honest gain, If you can. But, if you hone to thrive, Do not trade in ghosts alive, Or to prison you will drive In the van.
