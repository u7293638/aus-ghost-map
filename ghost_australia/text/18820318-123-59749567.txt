At Mars' harph blast arch, r impart; altar, falls! Ah, hard as adamant a braggart Czar Arms vassal swarms, and fans a fatal war! Rampant at that bad cal:, a Vandal band Harass and harm and ransack Wallach- land. A Tartar phalanx Balkars scarp hath past, And Allah's standard falls, alis ! at last. THE FALL OF EVE --E. Eve, Eden's empress, needs defended be; The Serpent greets her when she seeks the tree. Serene she sees the speckled tempter creep; Gentle he seems--perverted schemer deep Yet endless preterts ever fresh prefers Perverts her senses; revels when she errs, Sneers when she weeps.-regrets, repents she fell, Then, deep revenged, re.seeks the nether hell. . THE APPROACH OF EVENING.-r. Idling I sit in this mild twilight dim, Whilst birds in wild swift vigils circling skim, Light wings in sighing sink, till rising bright Night's virgin pilgrim swims in vivid light. INCONTROVERTIBLE FACTS-O. No monk too good to rob, or cog, or plot; No fool so gross to bolt Scotch collops hot. From Donjon tops no Oronooko rolls. Logwood, not lotus floods, Operto'sbowls. Troops of old toss-pots oft to sit consort. Box tops schoolboys, too, do flog for sport. No cool monsoons blow oft on Oxford dons, Orthodox jog trot bookwork Solomons! Bold Ostrogoths of ghosts no horror show On London shop-fronts no hop blossoms grow. To crocks of gold no Dodo looks for food. On seft cloth footstools no old fox doth b'ood. Long storm-toest sloops forlorn do work to port. Books do not roost on spoosn, nor wood cocks snort, Nor dog on snowdrop or on coltsfoot rolls, Nor common frog c.ncocts long protocols. THE SAME SUBJECT CONTINUED.-U. Dull humdrum murmurs lull, but hubbub stuns. Lucullus sn ifs up musk, mundangus shuns. Puss purrs, buds bursts, bac's butt, luck turns up trumps; But full cups, hurtful, spur up unjust thumps.
