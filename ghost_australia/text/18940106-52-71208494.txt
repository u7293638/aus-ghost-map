SUDDEN DEATH TO FLIES. j " Come inside a minute," said a dealer in pianos recently. "I have discovered the greatest fly trap on earth, and I want to show it to you." He led the way to an instrument at the rear of the store on which was a newspaper. On the paper had been placed a bunch of sweet peas. At least 1000 dead flies were lying on the paper in the immediate vicinity of the hunch of flowers. " I threw these here by chance," he continued, "and in about ten minutes I happened to notice that every fly that alighted on tho flowers died in a very short time." Even as ho spoke a number of the . insects which had stopped to suck the deadly sweet had toppled over dead. They alighted with their usual buzz, stopped momentarily, quivered in their legs, flapped their wings weakly several #nies, and then gave up the ghost. ?
