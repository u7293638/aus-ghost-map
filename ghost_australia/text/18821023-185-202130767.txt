CHARITY SUNDAY. The annual collections in aid of the local charities were taken up yesterday in the ma jority of Protestant churches, and, as will be seen from the subjoined particulars, the appeals, made were generally liberally re sponded to. The collections in the Roman Catholic churches will not be made for about three weeks, whilst at St. Paul's Church of England, Ballarat East, the charity services have had to be postponed, consequent upon the wor of renovation which is now going on there. The following are the detailed par ticulars :— Christ Church Pro-Cathedral—The Rev. Julius Lewis officiated at the morning service, and the Rev. H. W. H. Adeney at night.

Offertory, £13 3s 9d, of which £2 2s was for the Refuge, The evening sermon was from Acta xx, 35 — "Remember the words of the Lord Jesus; how be said, ‘ It is more blessed to give than to receive,’ ” from which the preacher showed that as we listen with respect and attention to one who is master of his subject, so, as was shown in the morning sermon, the Lord Jesus being thoroughly master of that of which He spake in the text, his words demanded our respectful and practical attention, and expe rience has abundantly proved the perfect truth of the statement. Offertory £9 0s 3d, of which £1 4s 5d was for the Refuge. In the afternoon a Flower Service was held, when the church was filled to its utmost capacity. The address was based on Canticles ii,, 12.

Jewish Synagogue—The Rev. I. M. Goldreich addressed an earnest appeal on behalf of the local charities from the life of Abraham, which formed the Scripture lessen of the day. Mr Goldreich took for his text Genesis xv., 6 —“ And he (Abraham) believed in the Eternal, who accounted it to him as righteousness”— and showed that the English word “righteous ness” in the text was in the original Hebrew “ zedakak," a word which in Hebrew amongst Hebrews was used to express every deed of kindness, benevolence, and charity. If then his congregation wished to copy their patriarch’s belief in God they must also copy his deeds of unselfish and pious benevolence, of which the context afforded so many illus trations. Then, and then only would they be worthy descendants of their great ancestor, and, like him, would their faith in God be accounted unto them as “righteousness.” The collection is likely to reach £13, the average of former years.
