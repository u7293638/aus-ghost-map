Greece and Italy, we will- Say little; ..The ground has been tob often trodden,; iand the, facts, or fictioris are the elements of education. Yet we may remark that in both' instances tha gradation from soothsaying to; teratology— from inspirations to visions and omens— was the same. It lias been reasonably conjectured that their mythology was the vestige of an extinct natural philosophy -; and, (in the 'tendency to personify powers of nature, we see. the continued; working of the impulse to reduce Divinity to the comprehension of hu- -manity. Throughout we see the action of two totally different systems — one which was purely Pantheistic; and another, which in dulged the rage , for pfrsonification and ob jectivity by endless attempts to separate the Deity into an. aggregate of numberless indi vidualities. Thus was their sp:rit- world formed': of which, each of the inhabitants had its (distinct office and power; and, as a con sequent necessity to satisfy human wants, each had its temples, its ministers, and its interpre ters. Tlie: superstii ions of the Indo-Germariic nations and the'Medimval ages have their dis tinctive but aualogous characteristics. ' It is -impossible "to glance at them without feeling the difference of the spirit that moved the Did .-world- and that which moves the new. ' It is jnqt .irierely the contrast between the opposite -influences of the West, but the contrast be) itween the opposite influences of the East) .which strikes. ' On the -one hand is n gloomy; vague superstition, . peopled with-' ghastly; gigantic forms of1 Scandinavian deities— fierce) merciless, blood-thirsty, and taking a cruel pleasure in destroying' their wretched creatures ; and on the other the pure' and genteel spirit of a (humanizing religion; struggling into light -through the incrustations of a weak human nature) In tho first elements we'see dissemina- . ted . Orientalism1 still i lingering in a Caucasian .progeny— retaining rnany of the grand linea-' .rrients. of the Eastern deities ; but roughened, mill: eveu uriiouilscvi (.u — — migratory arid energetic race. Tlie derivative :superstitions are similar in character. All the powers 'of the invisible -world become forthwith -more active for good and evil. ' The gods of (the 'Eastern: world ; partook of the sedentary 'equanimity of the climate. Their:wrath,' When it -descended'.' was indeed of the desolating iwratli oF the Simoon — it was not a dlastise- rment,: but an exteririination. But in general -their Influence was considered to be calm/ be nignant, and equable as the -temperature ; less so in torrid India and Egypt — more so in placid :Greece and Italy. All mythology wis tinc tured by its climate and locality. Vastness, monstrosity, and sublime stillness befitted the gods and spirits of boundless deserts and endless summers. The men that breathed the light and elastic atmosphere of Greece — cheer ful, buoyaut, intoxicating — as naturally peopled .their varied hills and laughing streams with deities, "fickle as their votaries, of whom they were the idealised type. So in Italy, a graver race gave graver characteristics to its Pantheon. Jupitor -is-;a 'moire massive creation than the sethorit l Zeus. " But iri Northern Europe the mythology was stern, dark, and ferocious. The Walhrilla ' was peopled with demons and hob goblins, .such as an" Eastern or Southern fancy could hardly- have1 conceived. Odin and Thor were 'the heroes, an! therefore the gods, of the Sea-kings and their elans. Druids sacrificed liecatoriibs of human victims to appease their hiriglign&nt; gods ; frantic fury played its wildest freaks in the dark forests of Germany and' Britain. Christianity changed without altering radically the existing delusions.- It spiritualised much ; but left much also as it was." Oracles spoke ho longer ; but miraculous legends introduced a new mythology. Mon- strons and terrible forms were no longer seen traversing the boundless forests ; but angels occasionally, and devils more ' frequently haunted the wood and the castle-corridors. That most perfect of poetical creations, the di minutive Fairy, was . preparing the way for Oberoti andTitania; and now also Puck was often seen)— yuitu' mutaHilis; allius et ater — Sometimes leading the boor into the swamp, 'drid sometimes threshing his corn for him. A hideous/ grotesque development and degrada- tio'ri' of the Greek Pan roamed - the world as its evil principle ; whispering angels stood prompt ing the smiles of infant children, and extend ing, crowns of martyrdom over the dying victim ; and "pale ghosts were seer. Hovering at' mid night; " Much that was beautiful and sublime was) mingled with ir.ore that, was merely re volting ' and ridiculous ; bat the new and awful "viewB'of human ' responsibility tended to make mehnapproxiiriate as ejosely as possible to the inVisible world, The rage for magic became stronger '.thqri ever) Thence only, in 'thc ab sence of special revelations) could man's future tie'" known.' ; /The supply soon satisfied the demand; witches and wizards risked temporal arid everi eternal flames, to gain present profit; iirid 'those who' consulted tlieui eagerly one day, burned them as> eagerly the next.
