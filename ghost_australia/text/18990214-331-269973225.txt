MISFORTUNES NEVER COME ALONE. HEALTH BETTER THAN WEALTH. DEATH MAKES A DOUBLE ATTACK, BUT IT IS FOILED BY DODD’S KIDNEY riLLS. While in the best of health it is risky to explore the crazy and rotten workings of an abandoned mind. When the eyes are dimmed with disease and the muscles contracted with pain it is indeed dangerous to grope amongst the murky drives and subterranean chambers which the superstitions people with the phantoms of their excit’d fancy. Many an old mine in this colony has the reputation of being hannlea by the ghosts of their victims. The most likely wraith to meet in them, however, is species of death, as the f dlowing will show :— “ Orango Gardens, Maryborough, “ 14tli October, 1898. “ The Dodd’s Medicine Co.,— “ Up till two months ago my health was very unsatisfactory. I had rheumatic pains in the back and legs, which grew worse. While engaged with a mate exploring an abandoned mine at Mariner’s Reef for gold I caught cold, and had the misfortune to meet with an accident, 1 fell 30 feet down the Ehaft, rarrowly escapiog death and meeting with severe injuries to the back and head. This, coming on my former ill-health, prostrated me altogether. At this time a friend brought me two boxes of Dodd's Kidney Pills which I took and continued. They have effected a wonderful change. Am how in the best health, and grateful for the good done me. Albert Joxes." Had Mr Jones taken Dodd s Kidney Pills before examining the old mine he might have been saved the accident. With braced muscles and alert eyes, which are the index of health, the slip which precipitated him down the shaft would not have happened, if he has not yet got fcbo gold lie sought he has obtained something infinitely tetter, in the shape of good health. Dodd's Kidney Pills are sold by all chemists and storekeepers at 2s 6d a box, six boxes fourteen shillings and sixpence, or will be sent (post paid) on receipt of price by The Dodd’s Medicine Co., Mi-lbonrne.
