I have shown that danger: — even death— of ten awaits the detective in the ordinary execution of his duty. I have no wish to trumpet it forth, or pile up any sham senti ment about it. I give it as a st9rn f act, \ that is all. Desperate criminals, when ? fairly hounded out, can turn, and fight, and struggle, and even kill, in the race for dear life and liberty; and, of course, the hunters must take their chance. Very.! little lets out a life in this world of ours, ! and it is not a little that a detective has to ; face. '„ That by the wayi; For a sample of a good stiff chase, take the following :-— i One dark wintry morning in November, -I I was sent for in hot haste, and the following telegram placed m my hand: — '] 'Gjanton Pier Police Station, 8 a.m. ! 'A seaman f grind killed on the railway line between^ Scotland-street and Trinity — the head completely severed from the body. I have.; had the body broughthere. -Please send .some one down to investigate— JMcGovan, if you can spare him.: : ' John Wab^drop.' . \- I stared and stared at the flimsy in my hand, and read and rer-read it in vain. I knew the sender well— a quiet, r un officious man who could think and see a , great way before opening his mouth once— ! and I was utterly at a loss as to what he could- see in such a simple occurrence to demand -my presence and assistance. The seaman had just been drunk, I thought, and had by some means wandered on to j the line and then got killed for bis \ stupidity* I say :-- so. I - thosghV &?dj ?so I -aaiesay eyer^ one^else snight lave \ ^thbugatjliad not1 Jonny been Statiohmaster at Granton. It would be a curious investi gation — and one, I believe, of no small magnitude— to try and discover how many 'accidents' on the railway are in reality no accidents at all. However, there was something under it all. I had to go, and the sooner T was stirring the better. Such was my con clusion, though I had taken some time to get at it, just as a man sometimes dallies with a letter, wondering what it can con tain, when he could at once tear it open and see. Meantime McSweeny had dropped in, -tnd as he had nothing particular its hand I took him with me. As we got out of the Office, and1 were crossing towards Wrarriston Close to get down to the Waverley Station, a trifling incident occurred, which I noted and com miisiicated to my companion. It was that we were being watered and followed1 by. Nat Hinchie, one of the most dai-ing and desperate cracksmen that ever infested Edinburgh. What couid bring him out so early, asdonsuch a cold morning, and then set him on our track, puzzled us both. Watching and following is generally on our own side, not on that of the criminal. Of course we did our best to keep him under the delusion that we had not taken mdre than a passing notice of him^ and thus we progressed till the railway ticket-office was reached, when we found our broken-no3ed gentleman close behind us, as if he had re solved to go by the same train. But no. We got two for Granton, and then heard him make some demurring en quiry about some train which did not start for more than an hour, and then slink off without expending a penny* A look and a wink was enough between us. 'He only wanted to know where we were going,' I said with quick decision. ' He must nave some interest in us. Lat's reverse it. You follow him, while I go to Granton and hear what Jonny has to ? say about it.' With a significant lowering of the left eyelid, McSweeny was off. The train took me off next, and I soon got to Granton Pier Station. ' Well, Jonny, what's wrong now ?' I said, as I shook hands with the inspector. ' That's just what I want you to decide,' he replied. ' But you'd better see the body first,' and he led the wayto where it was I examined it attentively. The head had been cut clean off by the wheels, but, beyond a few scratches and cuts about the face, and a dark, round indention on the top of the forehead, I could detect nothing uncommon about it. It is true, the said indention did catch my eye particularly, and I favored it with a pretty long and curious stare, but beyond that I had no suspicion, and opened my eyes a little when Wardrop eagerly cried — ' Well, what do you think of that ?' - ' That' so evidently meant the strange indention in the forehead that I examined it again. ' Nothing particularly. I suppose it has been done by the wheels in passing.' 'I think not. Have you ever seen a blow given by a cracksn a Vs ned ly ?' ' Ay, and felt it too, as you very well know.' 'Well, that's one.' This was a ereat deal for him to venture^ and I stared at the markmore intently than ever, quite sure that more was coming. And I was right. ? ' Listen, ;while I give you the facts,' he continued. 'David Law, the deceasedj left his ship, yesterday morning with £38 and a silver watch in his possession. When his body was discovered, not a ghost of a coin or a watch was to be 'found on him. But more; I was at the railway station ' myself in th? morning, . and distinctly remember noticing. this : man, from two causes. In the first place, I was watching a notorious cracksman, who was loitering and hanging about near him ; and, in the second place, when the sailor took out a first-class ticket, the other I was watching immediately had his changed for one of the same kind. The sailor, after standing treat to about half-a-dozen at the bar, got into the train at last, and then Nat Hinchie siunk-in after him ? '_._ -, , . .--... ' W'ho!' I cried, with a great start. 'Nat Hinchie. You know him well;, at least, you have cause to know him.' ' 'I do. Go on— go bri!' I cried, with sudden interest and feyerish haste. 'Well, La^ was, seen by one of his mates floating about the High-street, .yes terday afternoon, in company with a man whose description exactly -ftts Nat, Hinchie. But that is not all* Early this morning, long before the ticket-office was open for the first trairij two men^ presumably Law and Hinchie, presented themselves at the Scot land-street Station, wanting tickets for Granton. They were both drunk, but to all appearance Hinchie was by far the worst of the two:, -Being told they were far too soon, they wandered aboUi the station f ot a while, occasionally breakingout into an altercation among themselves about something, and then tkey- were lost Bight of, having disappeared somewhere into the dark ness, The very first train that passed after that had taken off Law's head. The driver noticed a kind of hitch in the engine ; men were sent back, and the body diseovered. No other was in sight; and,, as I have saidj not a penny, not an article was found on the Sailor ; Ms very, knife and tobacco were gone.' ????' - ' Did anv one overhear their altercation ? at the station?' ='--' ' ' . . ^ \- ' Yesi a.young lad, the night pointsman ; but he was gone home when I got there. I have his address, though— it is quite close ; at hand— and, if you have no objection, we will go Tound and rouse Mm up.' I was otiE with him at once/as iquiek as I could get my legs to move, without abso lutely running* I had become deeply inte rested in theicase,and was fervently thank ing my stars that I had set McSweeny -to'* look after tiie villain who had foiiowed us to the station. I was reckoning a little too se- ?? curelyyaswill appear ; but, of course, I could not know ±hat then. I. owed Hinchie some thingior placing me oni the disabled list foi nearly a fortnight once, and my very, fingers tingled at the thought of. fairly laying Mm: by the heels.; If all that Wardrop hinted ; at proved correct, something more fearful \ than anything I had ever wished fo-- had occurred, which, if proved, would probably relieve me of the villain for life. - c-- j. ; We soon gotto ihe;&ftdress; tittle :poihts-= man, cand-r-fi little ^xmlnndly, perhaps— loused ibimiitiprout of kisimst sleep.

He had on a silk hat and a lolaek suit, with false whiskers and moustache ; and carried a small carpet bag 'and a silk umbrella.' ^'Oh! he's for a journey, then. Did McSweeny not come out after him?' ' No, sorry a bit — he never ? ' I did not hear the rest, for I was tearing ?up the steep wynd as fast as legs could carry me. I took a moment's breath at the top, and then cut down towards the railway by Halkerston's Wynd and Market-street. Why I thought he had made for the rail way I cannot tell. Turning down into the Cowgate certainly did not point in that direction, but then I knew that Hinchie, like most thieves, was very lazy, and would not walk an inch if he could ride. On the whole, I suppose, the instinct of experience prompted me toit. At any rate, l was right. I did not pause at the ticket office, but sprang down towards the platform whole stairs at a time, in case a train might be starting, bearing my man snugly ensconced. I did not find Mm, or any trace of him, on the left side; and then, in defiance of all rule, I cut right across the rails to where a Glasgow train stood puffing in readiness to start. One of the guards collared me roughly, and then smiled but at his mistake, as he recognised me and let me go; but the moment's delay almost cost me my man. I ran hastily over inearly the whole train, and at last stopped at a first-class carriage, in a corner, of which a sickly-looking gentleman was reposing, his hat on the wire , cage overhead, his carpetbag on the seat before him, and his head and shoulders completely enveloped in a comfortable travelling plaid. . - . u Show your- ticket,' I said, sharply and gruffly.' . ; . . .. ? . : . \\- ? .; He obeyed at once, Holding the, plaid up about his mouth with the other hand, as if sorely troubled with the toothache. ; I saw at once that he had no gloves on, showing an exceedingly dirty paw with un trimmed nails to match. If he had shown the right hand I would have known him at once, for I knew that Hinehie bore on that hand & broken little finger. 1 a It won't do,' I cried, u show your face.' ** Toothache, excuse me,' he answered, in muffled tones, shrinking a little. ' Quick I' and my. hand was on the plaid — 'quick! the train is beginning .to move.' There was no time for delay now. With a wrench X had itofE, and the false whiskers : eamewithit. : ? \- Nat JBBnchie and I stood, face to face, glaring into each other's eyes. A curse from hiih, and a ^iumphant ex clamation frbm me, and'theiA sprang back wards to the doort&eihoutto; them to stop the train, which was%ctually moving. But in the moment's pause he was not idle.. -??'?? The window of the opposite door was down, and leaving hat, plaid, and carpet bag to their fate, he bounded right through on to the ground, more neatly than eyer harlequin went through a u practicable shop window ' or ** drawing-room mirror.' It was a dangerous jump, and might have cost .him his life, for the guard had either not heard or .misunderstood my-cry,.--. and the motion of the train was quickenmg; Jmt the moment I saw him spring up unhurt and dash across the rails, nothing would serve me but I must be after hiwi by the same aperture — just as_a . cat in the excite ment of the chase will scramble through the I same narrow bars.and slits dodged through I T)y^. mouse 'in ihev agonising attempt to I -jsbape.- 6^.... ^C-^; ' ..] .

I was now hatless, and somewhat torn and muddy ; but the moment my hands were relieved of Pete I dashed off and down into Blackfriars Wynd, leaving the enquiring crowd far behind. My old Irish woman served me in good stead again. ' Seen him ?' I gasped, as Icaught sight of her face. ' Yes, he's just gone in; wid only his trousers and shirt on.' ' Good ! Now let Mm escape if he can !' I plunged into the dark entry, felt for the door, and neither knocked nor waited for invitation. The door was fastened inside, but I ran back to the wall and then dashed myself on it with a force that sent it crash ing inwards in smithereens. It was very dark, but I could see that a woman, fierce and determined-looMug as a tigress about to be robbed of its cubs, was rearing herself before me. It was Hinchie's mistress, and there was a look about her eyes that I did'ntlike. ' Well, Moll, where is he ?' I demanded, quite heedless of her dark scowls. ' He's got to come out, so lie may as well do it at once. It's a lifer this time.' Something glittering in her hand caught my eye, as she answered, in still, deadly tones — ' He is here ! Take him, if you dare !' The arm that was to wield the knife was drawn back — and it was a powerful' one, as I had felt before — but I had no time for nonsense, and I sprang on her, wrenched it from her hand, and then hurled her, with all the strength I could command, against the stone wall. Something caught her feet, and she went flop down, hit her head with a hard thud^and lay quiet. The ken behind — a damp, slimy hole — I had been in before, and it did not take a second to reach it. But I had no light, and could not get the matches I carried to strike. I knew the murderer was there, and nowhere elss, for the place had no window ; but I was afraid to quit the doorway lest he should double and slip out. I was in a fix, but in a moment the thought struck me to listen for his breathing. That did it. Like me, he had had a hard run, and the moment his panting reached my ear I was upon him. We struggled and struggled, and hissed and fought and kicked and tore at each other, till I thought he never would give in. My own strength was going — his seemed as fresh as ever. I must do some thing at once, or not do it at all. It flashed on me to try the plan that had settled the woman, and with a sudden timi I seized him and hurled him into the dark ness behind. But strange, he did not reach the wall — no, nor the floor either. There was no dull thud nor crashing fall, but in its place a dreadful yell — a whish of damp aii1, a splash deep down, and theu a deathly silence. I could not understand it. I was breathless, torn, bleeding, aud almost done out, but I managed to gasp out — ' Are you there, Hinehie?' There was no answer, not even a groan ; and I crawled forward, feeling cautiously along the floor with my hands. . ? '. '. Then I began to have an girling into the mystery. I felt first a long broad trap in the floor, and then inside of that the round mouth of an old well or pit, reaching down I knew not how far. It had been a close shave with me, and I daresay if he had not struggled to send ms down alone, in the knocking about we might have tumbled in together. I got back slowly to the other den, and was then joined by other two detectives and some policemen, who had been attracted by the commotion in the High-street at the ' lugging up of Pete Finnigan. The woman was taken off to the Office, and then we got lights and ropes and pro ceeded to inspect the old well. It was yeiy deep. With a strong light we could just see the water and no more. But there was no trace of Hinehie. I wished some one to be lowered down, and even offered to be the man myself; but they demurred, saying that the old hole would probably be full of foul air, which would choke a man in a moment. To test it a light was lowered till it nearly reached the water, when it suddenly burned blue and went out, with a strong draught, I thought — with the foul air, they persisted. - However, we could do nothing more in the meantime ; and two men were left to watch the well, while I was helped htyne to have some rest and refreshment. But early in the morning, or, as some would say, in the middle of the night, an astounding piece of news came to the Office from Burntisla&d;, across the water. It was that a man, in every point .answering the description of Hinehie had been accidentally drowned in jumping -off the u waggon boat? — r-that is, one of the long steamers fitted with rails on which railway ?; waggons are tub and conveyed bodily across, ithej For^h. As a favor, and under the plea, -of, urgent business, he had been allowed -to cross in it; hut there being no proper gangway* in the darkness he had missed his footing, and .gone down between the landing and' the steamer^ an-i Jong before lie was fished up the life was put of him. .. ,?? I could- not belieye it^when the word wasbrought;to me' ;? andheariag that the body was being brought; w0t, for the puiv pose of identification, I limped all the way to the_ Office., and thenee3TELo\srn to the Waverley Station, to see it. And it was'Hinchiej really and tr-aly. But how in the world had he; escaped? and .how was it that McSweeney.h^dVnever turned up? - :. ?_ .. f,.r ?-- ?: \ -These questions iat once, rose to our lips, j .and naturally enough our thoughts reverted to the old well in the den at the foot of ^lackfriar's Wynd. ? .. . ; -v'fWe must have another look at it,' I ?said, and the suggestion was at onee acted .upon. We ^ot down/to the place, assured ourselves from the ;two; sentinels that no one ; had come out by the top of the well, and ; then I was lowered into ifc : Just as my feet touched the water, a -strong current ~of air-caught the light in my hand and extinguished' it, but I shouted out to those overhead not to pull me up till I ; was ready. I swung groping about, and ? ?soon discovered the cause of the draught 4- \ a wide, square opening in the side .of the i well-^a kind of giant .waste-pipe, for pre- : venting the water in the well' from, rising above a certain height. . . But I discovered more, for Jwanfed to see where it led to, and crept-.into {some I distance, when I came upon^a' sbft/.warmi body^ which moved — I may says, kicked arid grunted enei^etically^--at:m^:itouchi; ?- , ' ? ' A moment's inspection convinced me that the great bundle was a man, securely roped acd gagged, and instead of gliding past, I seized him by the collar and tugged him back towards the well. Then the faint light from the torches above re vealed features that I knew. 'What? McSweeny!' I cried, as I cut away the bandages and. set his tongue free. ' Are you alive ?' ' No, I'm dead, ye divil, with hunger,' he returned, with a wolfish snap. ' Why did ye go off last night without lettin' me out?' ' Why did you let us off without shouting out?' . 'Shout, ye divil? Put that in your mouth an' tie it in, an' see how much ye can shout.' ' But how did you get in ?' ' Get, in ? He axed me in — to have some dinner, he said — an' then they fought me, an' showed me they were the strongest, 'an' then crammed me mouth wid that ould rope. Then they said they hoped I liked my dinner, and that it 'ud sit aisy on me stomach, and tied up me eyes an' shoved me in here. It's a wonder the rats left any of ine. They were enquiring after my health more than once in the night time.' 'Hinehie got off.' 'Ah, so he did ; I felt him crawl over me : I knew he wasn't a rat, curse Mm.' 'But he's dead — drowned.' ' Ah, that's good !' was the unctuous re joinder, and the first thing he did when his hands were free was to rub them joyfully. We were soon hauled up, and McS wesny, I am glad to say, was not much the worse of his long fast. The outlet in the well, we afterwards found, led into the common sewer, but how Hinehie got out of that I never could tell, unless he had squirmed himself out by one of the wide street syphers. Hinchie's mistress got 30 days, while Pete Finnigan was treated to 60, with the forfeiture of his broker's licence. The most of the money stolen from the sailor was re covered, but the secret of the murder, if there was one committed, died with Nat Hinehie.
