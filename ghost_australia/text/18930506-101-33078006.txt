(Ab,bear in miud, thia garden waBenohanted!) ; -Edgar Allan Poe. j "I wish you were hore.iny dear," wrote Norah Fraser to Mrs. Douglas, when the Íroung wife had occupied lier new home a ittle more than a week. " Don't tell your husband I said so. Men are unreasonable cattle, and lie might think I was tryiug to so wfdissension in the cage of the turtle doves, and to pnt migratory thoughts into the mind of the dearest giri in the world; I have no such intention, of cours», but a talk with you would do nie good. Do you know what that little wretch, whom I prefer not to name, has i done P Ton weald never guess. He introduced an- other Tory candidate, and for a few dave bouletered him np. Then, seeing that he is not quite a little king.upou-whoels ; that the electors will not vote for his pro tege-he declares openly that he is dis- appointed in Mr. Graham; that, having promised, he must give the man his own vote ; bot he trusts that nobody else will follow hts example. > ^' Eileen, I i.want to know what itj means; I begin to think he is deep-, * deep1 and ely7- like Joe ttagstock.- ij wish yon were here to help me to unravel! the mystery. It is like walking on thej brink of a 'precipage' ia the dark-not knowing what the next day may bring! forth. I am' sufo something most un-! (looked for is going to startle ns eoóu." The mystery that Mrs. JTraeer wondered, about was never made plain to the general Îrablic; but when ehe heard a few days ater that a Liberal candidate wa? in the field, she guessed the. troth, which was this : a Liberal must be induced to stand for the electorate. Then Sir William) would request the superduous candidates to retire, m favour of the one he would select, and hé would not make that choice without consulting Edward Severn; SQ the.game was in hie own hands ! ; It is a delicate matter for a Conservai tive member to try to bring a Liberal candidate forward ; bat the riches with which Mr. Severn wouldhaverecompensed Korah for the loss ot ber self-respect, helped him. He bribed an unscrupulous Liberal to go to the poll. j rtjToù have no risk," «aid he. " I'll pair electioneering expenses and. your deposit as well, if yon allow yourself to ble nominated. Of course you will not bte returned { bat I'll allow- yoe a hundreji pounds tb make up fer disappointed hopes -if you leave my name entirely out of the business!" _.' " ' > j Mr. fïnvern need not have made that last condition. For hie own sake the Liberal was not likely to publish the pafv ' ? ticulars of that nomination. He swallowed the indignation that a. wealthier man might have shewn, and pocked the sovereigns with the. secret of how he had earned them. j Of conree, when Sir William MacBain made his choice of a follower1-the dis- carded candidates, though indignant, offered no opposition to the will of the great man. Sir William forbade the fight,! and rather than split the votes and give ai Liberal the chance of the seat, they obeA dientiy withdrew from the contest. , Mrs. Fraser wrote again to Eileen. ; "For weeks I have lain iu a pulpy r*. condition-crashed almost flat by onr disgusting defeat, or, let me say, by Mr. Severn's disgusting triumph.

"Oh, if you cali it a duty I îiaVe noth- j lng more to say.excopt don't b* very long, j It will be desperately lonely here without ; you." She wen* close to him and etroked his ! hair. " Dear Norman, you are a good boy ; and very loveable when jou are so nice." From Moorinba Eileen wrote letters teeming with love and sympathy for her " poor desertedboy/' thus early consigned to a state of grass widowerhood. He answered back : " One never knows how much one can endure, untU one is compelled to submit to privation. OE course, dear darling, I mus you avery ; hour au\l minute of the day ; yet I eat and . drink, and, incredible as it seems, some- times find myself as merry as if the sweetest girl in the world hadn't grown hard-hearted, and. left me all forlorn." If Eileen bad been asked, she would not be able to say why that letter dis pleased^er^yThe troth was, she liked to think heraart indispensable to him. The Eileen I am - trying to portray was no calm, ideal creature, but a girl of impulse -full of imperfections, for which those who understood her loved her the more ; swift at inward rebellion when anything jarred upon the super- sensitive finer chords. It hurt her now to think of him eating, drinking and merry, while she was away. p|ajd ho [spoken of himself gloomy and obmforilésa ar^ his books, she wonld have returned at once with a heart over- tiring with pitying love. She withdrew the feeling of sympathy that had dictated the first letter, and wrote again, but. in a superficial strain. \- " I jun rejoiced to hear that you can do so well without me. I had thought of going back at the end of the week, but since you aro comfortable jt înay delay my return. Theyatealt so pleased to have me here. A ftreadfnl thing has happened, that gave nie Mite a shock. Mrs; Cas- well was Idlled a "few days ago. I had never met.lier, as you know! By the way, she was your aunt!" Mrs. Douglas received a great deal more than "quite a shock" when she heard of Mrs. Caswell's awfully sndd«n ond. She had indeed been prostrated, but she would not say so to Norman. The thought of him merry put everything out of tune, therefore she wrote merely a polite little note, as she would to a stranger. One day as she and Miss Gray sat talking to Mrs. Thornhill, who often went to Moorinba, Mrs. Frazer arrived, looking white and scared. Eileen saw at once that something had happened, but when she asked, in an undertone. what,-wNorah .made a motion towards Miss Gray. It was something that must not be blurted out.abruptly before that lady. Mrs. Frazer «at olmtfering iii almost her usual bright way for about ten minâtes, then she said suddenly.

"I know it-I knew it! Oh, great heaven, I was sure of it !" The two visitors looked at one another in amazement. It wee tree that Mrs. Cae well was a kind of. annt of Eileen's, but that did not account for the horror end surprising guess at tho1 troth. They knew she was not the ono to grieve for her kindred because they Were . lier kindred. Eileen never m all her life shed regulation tears. They did not know she felt "guilty of death "-remem- bering the wicked wish that would not be stifled whenever ehe thought of Eleanore's spoilt life. She fancied now that she must have prayed for this catastrophe/ and she would have given her life ta recall the unhappy dead. ? Then Mr*. Thornhill solved the riddle of Eileen's distress-(for the poor girl'« head was buried, in the sofa cashions). " They were of one house, you know,' said ehe, in a low voice. " Perhaps Mrs Douglas had a warning - or saw hei wraith,"-Mrs. Thornhill believed ur respectable ghosts-they; were good form, " The Douglases are a good old «Scotcl i family, and it is very likely she saw some ? thing. I had a warning myself the nigh! before my father died."
