SALVATION ARMY WEEK OF SELE-DENIAL TOTAL FOE, AUSTRALASIA, £25,350. THE WORLD'S JRECORD BEATEN. HEW ZEALAND HEADS THE POLL. , " It won't do. l oan raise a better song any day.of the week in Melbourne ; and I've yet to learn that Sydney is willing to take a back seat' to Melbourne. (Cheers.) Is'ovv, then,, you up in the top shelf there—(laughter)— among the gods, why.don't you sing. . If you don't, I won't tell you what's inside;; these papers." ; (Cries of "Oh.") It was Com mandant Booth who spoke. His auditors were Salvationists, drawn from the city and all the. suburbs around (writes the' Sydney JJaibj lclojrnph of October 27.) They crowded the . Centenary Hall trom . the floor lite rally _ to the ceiling. There was scarcely j standing room -in either of ; the ■ galleries. Everybody was more or less excited, and the enthusiasm which wa3 engendered knew no bounds. Themeeting had been called to hear the official results of the self-denial effort declared. The totals had been- kept a profound secret. Even the officers were not taken. into confi dence, and expectancy was written on: every face. _ The - officers of the leading corps ;and divisions, as well as of the colonies, had invoked a keen spirit of rivalry by. challenging each other to head the poll. • Punctually at 8 o'clock a whistle sounded. Everybody seemed to know the signal and rose to his or her ieet. It announced the advent of the Commandant and Mrs. Booth, who_ were greeted with deafening cheers,' musical honors, and the waving of handker chiefs. They were preceded on to the platform by seven officers dressed in white duck suits, with asearlet sash,'showing in large white letters across their breasts the' names of the seven colo nies of Australasia. i'heir appearance caused a mildsensationi Col6nelPearc( Victoria), Colonel Estill, and Mrs. Estill al^o occupied prominent seats. Colonel Peart opened the proceedings by announcing a hymn entitled " March on," which he declared to bo "the grandest song in the book." Major Braham followed with prayer, until he was interrupted by the com mandant, who, with his concertina, commenced a pretty refrain, "I heard ; of a Saviour whose love was so great." Then Colonel Estill prayed. He thanked;God for "the tot?.ls which the Commandant was going to announce," and for the partial restoration to health of Mrs. Booth. "Now,, what's the -matter with you Syduey people," shouted tho Commandant, as he took charge of the meeting. "You seem to be on pins and. needles." (Laughter.) - Then: he went on to say that he reckoned-the Sydney soldiers were honored in being the first to hear the territorial totals announced. These things were usually, done at the headquarters in Melbourne. For .that night the. head quarters were in Sydney, as ho .had the conceit to believe that_ the headquarters of the Salvation Army; in Australasia were under his hat. (Laughter and cheers.) As the constituted director of the Army in Aus tralasia and the representative of their beloved General—(cheers)--ho Was there, to give the ] record of tbe latest battle fought for God and i humanity under the Southern Cross. He did so with mingled feelings of wonder and praise, i He was not a novice in the Army. Born in its ranks he- had ,been privileged, to beai participator in some of its brightest achieve-1 raents. (Cheers.); He rose to speak, there-1 fore, not as. the scribe3 did " merely, i but a3 one with some degree of authority. Somo people did not:■ know the -secret of the power of the Salvation Army. Next to God and the Holy Ghost, it lay in tho fact that tbe Armyjbad gone;back to the creed of the Founder of Christianity, The cross .was their attraction. .("-Hallelujah,".. "Glory," -and cries of :" Fire a volley.") . Self-denial week represented not merely -the principle of grasp and cadge, as some of their enemies said. It represented the principle of self-denial. The movement. - had been started in .: England some 10 or ••11: - years: - ago, when the Army ' had little but. -its-.-wits and devotion to depend upon.. It began m a small way, and the result the first year was about £2,000. Last year the total .throughout the worid' was not far short of £60,000— (applause) — of which Australia had con tributed 17,000 sovereigns. Woe to them if they had not done as well thi3 year. (Laughter and cheers.) The amount of toil put into the effort this year bad been enough to make the angels shout for joy. Some of the women had been at it when asleep—(laughter)—and very much ab ib when awake. (Cheers.) lb was ■ the hardest cro3s : in the world to be a beggar—to go round from door to door like the rag and bones man—(laughter)— and to push and push; for God know ib took an awful lob of push to squeeze a threepenny bit out of some people. _ (Laughter.) One girl, : under exceptional circumstances, had collected £415s. " God bless the girl/' If it hadn't been wicked he would have liked to kissi her when she : told' him—(laughter)—but since he had been married his wife claimed all the kisses he could coin. ' (Great laughter and Mrs. Booth, "Don't enlarge on the subject.") . He knew ' the character of the Army v soldiers in England, Canada, Africa, and on the Continent of Europe; but for devotion, for going at it without being pressed, for going at it with a shout, and sticking to it with glorious enthusiasm, he had never met the like of the Salvationists in Australasia—r (deafening cheers)—and,; added the Comman dant, witn a significant hod, "I've told the General so in this week's dispatches." : In fact, he had told him to make haste and get through his work on the other side, and come out to Australia and see the real Salvationist (Great cheering.)
