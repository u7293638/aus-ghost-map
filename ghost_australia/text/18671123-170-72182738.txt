TO MR. J--HN DAVIES. SOLE PRO PRIETOR OF THE HOBART TOWN UEHCURY. (Per javor of tlie Cornwall Chronicle. J Dsab John, — I almost blushed, for old friendship's sake, at your trying to impose upon the credulity of the working men's deputation, by stating you were in the habit of paying from £125 to £150 per week in wages. I had trusted that you were relorming ere this, and aui eorry to see that to your other foibles you add that of kelle white lie!1, but of course you were always tbe chap to co the ' whole bog or none.' Vet, dear John, it would tie better to stick to the truth, and have said a third of the amount named and that you always have the worth of your money out of your employes. You will not take it ill when I tell you theee pilU won't be swallowed ; tbe days of bnnkum are past, and you are too well kuotvn lor a long 'un, lor any credence to be placed in anything you may try to make people believe. Adieo, dear Jack ; believe me to be as I always am, Yours faithfully, Bihcuall's Ghost. Launceston, Nov. 20, I8G7.
