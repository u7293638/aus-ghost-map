The Men Who" Died. Gentlemen, stand for a silent toast, To be drunk with drooping head The men who died at a falling post, Who won the least, and who gave the most — To nnr hfAVfi- rief natari riaari. Ghosts of the slain, call out to-night, From the graves across the sea. "Soldiers slain in a losing fight — A wild attack on a mountain height, Or a hopeless charge — are we. " Soldiers crossing a ford in flood, Or led to a false attack , Dragging our guns through seas of mud, Dark'ning the earth with our hearts' best blood, As we fought our passage back. " Soldiers marched through the sunburnt day, Marched through the cold, chill night, Walking asleep ; in the morning grey In front of the trenches brought to bay, With an unseen foe to light. f Soldiers — pawns of the gen'ral's game, Yet we lives to lose or five — Done to death on a field of shame ; We gave our lives for our country's name — We had nothing more to give." Gentlemen, drink with uplifted head, Proud though the worst is faced ; Gntlemen, here's to our honoured dead, The men who fought, and the men who bled — Defeated, but not disgraced ! " To- Dav."
