ECHOES OP MELBOURNE J-. 1 : ; [Bt The Ghost.J : : ; ? i ,i It is satisfactory to know that tne state-' ment made in the Assembly by Mr. Ander-' son that 'four hundred young girls under the age of fourteen were leading a life of shame in; Melbourne' has been pronoun ced, after : a careful investigation ? by a number of our most experienced police officers, as ''entirely without foundation, and that this opinion is f ully endorsed by the leading members of the Salvation1 Army, 'who are certainly in a position' -to know whether there is . any-; truth 'in the assertion.' :. It is perhaps as well that there Bhould:be in every community people with amania for starring up the noisome depths of the social edifice, ^opening up its 'sewers and. laying bare its; : cloaca maxima. Enquiry ' is stipulated : by their iaotiorij and enquiry elicits .the truths It ia per haps, as well that the statement was' pub licly made : instead of being- whispered ? about;' as otherwise no authoritative denial pf the slander iipon the purity; of the ris ing generation of Victoria would have been possible. .Doubtless the ' lamkineas ' ? ; is at thepresent time one of the typeB'of ? colonial young- womanhood, but 'between; nnchastity and rpwdiness there is' a wide gulf. !In, regard to this1 matter, ; it : is assuredly satisfactory to be ! able to record1; another/instance in which 'the- devil is ' net as black as he: is painted'.'.';;1 ?' '! ;'. ? When some imitator '? of.1 the ? elder ? D'lsraeli undertakes thtf taskVof enditing' the curiosities of colonial literature^ the history, of the' Viet orian Review Company will 'in-all probability occupy a prominent position in the pages of ther compilation. The recently filed insolvency schedule of Mr.- Henry Henty shows that a loss; of; ?upwards'- of thirty-two, thousand pounds is ' dub to that gentleman's dabbling in news- ] papers.- ; As there are numerous ; other ; gentlemen interested in the publications' issued from the Flinders-lane office, the losses incurred in providing the public' with the mental pabulum must amount to-' a pretty considerable figure. It is certainly a: matter for regret that the purveyors of news for the ' gentle public ' should have; received such a poor recognition of their labours, and that during a long series of years they should, as it were, have been doing good by stealth and blushing to find it fame.
