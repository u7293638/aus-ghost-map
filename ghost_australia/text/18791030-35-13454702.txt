SCHOOL OF ARTS. The excellent programme which Professer Pepper has arranged to make his final appearances at the School of Arts paiticularly attractive drew a large and attractive audience together last night. The chief features in the entertainment were the Metempsychosian illustrations of the story of " Fisher's Ghost," and the beautiful Grecian fable "Pygmalion and Galatea", the representation of ancient and modern statuary: the farcical sketch the "Missing Ghost " and the "spiritual seance" .The present programme will be repeated for the last time to night, and tomorrow the Professor takes a well-deserved benefit. The specialities wall be a lecture on fire handling, Protessor Pepper performing some startling experiments in illustration of his remarks, and a "Paganini spiritual violin solo," and there are to be many other attractions besides.
