About twelve persona haring “ Uati. fled " to th at effect, the presober commenced to e<ng " Book of Ages,” and tbe congregation joioed io, Several others then gsro testimonies. Mr Yatman, in offering up prayer, asked God to bless the British Empire and help bar in ber time «f trouble, and after that to grant peso*. Mr Ystman eoon drifts from solemn subjects to ligh'er odes ; .one minute he brings tears to the ejes of h<s hearers, aed the n*xt he has them oonvulfeed wi'h laughter. He advised ihem to be joyful over their religion, and not like some who bad sour faces, whioh made everyone eround miserable, They were enongh to give a pereon the reiiginai dyspeptic, he added, and ibe experienoe was similar to taking a do*e of medicine.

Yesterday afternoon Mr Yatmsn delivered a powerful address to young men, on " VYfaat Comes After Death ?' The meeting, which was purely of the iDspirstionsI order, closed with prayer. He claimed, after going deeply into the subject, that the only one who gave a solution to the problem of tbe future was tbe 800 of Mary, the Son of God, who said " All that are in their graves shall come forth, some to the resorreotion of life, and some to tbe ruaneetion of damnation.* Man did ootdieliks sdog.
