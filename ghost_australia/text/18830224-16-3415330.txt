IT was evening time before Dick awoke from the fitful sleep the strong nobblers Brooks had entailing had thrown him into BCSUILS, the kind hearted landlord had put not a few drops of laudanum into these nobblers, to-as he said to Mrs Brooks "quiet line down a bit and bring the cheque to his mind " the Dick i roused up Mr Brooks brought him a pannikin of strong hot tea, which enlivened him wonder full), so that he seemed more himself than he had been for days Undoubtedly) the sedative had done him good, for he ate a fan mail, had a good wash, and looked quite a new man The landlord therefore thought it 1 good time to jog his memory again and said to him "I'll tell you will it it is, Dick, if on don't find that cheque I shall stick to ) our horses and swag, although the) w n t pix half join bill ' "What cheque' Whit bill' What do you mean, an ' Did I not give t ) on a cheque some day or other ' I have a sort of recollection of doing so ' "Yes, on (one me one this morning, but it was only for £10 uni join account is DD) 1'Js 91 ; so for be it the other cheque for £100 that you said ) on him ' Cheque for ills which I said I had ' Oh, that is it, is it' I begin to see things now Times been your pretty) game!

CHAPTER X THE BURKE DISTRICTS XBANDONMEM UD RE OCCUPATION ONE of the most marked features of Australian history, whether of district, town, 01 indust j, is the pulse like way in which de x elopement has been aimed at Progress has never been continuous, seasons of great de pi session lime always alternated with those of any accident This certainly may be said to be the usual rule of the world whether as regards nation or men idual All sunshine is the lot of none the dark cloudy days must, by the law of nature, follow the hue But these periods of progress and retrogression bare per has been more frequent in these colonies because they are the native all result of the rapid rate of hung we indulge in and the general eagerness there is among us to detach suddenly and easily if possible That is, there is a speculative chess pet lading our whole community, engendered doubtless by the gambling spirit of gold hunting which stilled the Aus trains upon their new lease of life, and which causes action and reaction to be more frequent than in older and more staid countries A gold diggings ceases to be a engines still on, and the onetime rowdy and bustling township becomes deserted and reaches back to features care Such disease districts are common all over the land, but there comes a time to each and every one of them when capital is induced to try again if the gold is not all gone Then is the mine to reef discovered, money is invested settlers of a less restless stamp are attracted, and grade ii but sure pro- gress is made It is almost impossible to point to a single Australian town that has not a history something similar to the above Nor is it only in such an exciting bustle as gold digging that this feature is to be observed The quiet occupation of sheep and cattle i using on Crown lands, called in the colonies squatting, his shown just as fitful a history Kew districts have been in side known by explorers and immediately rushed by pastoralists, only to again defeat to the Crown after a year or two's occupancy Then a second time does there come the wave of progress, just as in the case of gold digging, in the shape of the money ed man who is now king systematically and not impulses c) and the district which by the unsuccessful ones had been decca ed to be totally unfitted for stock raising is found to possess advantages inherent in it alone Thus has it been with the new splendid districts of the Darling River, with Southern Riverina, with the greater part of interior New South Wales, with the coast country of Queensland, and also with that immense area of this latter named colony the district of Burke In the late years which have elapsed since the burning of the Dead Finish hotel and the opening time of this chapter one of these waves of depression had passed over this Gulf Country BY cr had broken out in But below in, the then capital of the day act, death had been mated the little Topiilition and frightened aw ax the I remainder, although proof was conclusive that this special fever was imported by a trading schooner, and was not peculiar to the climate, yet a se use took place and the town of Burke soon had not a single inhabitant left in it very low indeed did the tide ebb from the one time bustling Albert River The squatting stations of the district ongi nails had been stocked mostly with sheep of the poor est out that) -the rejected curls of the flocks of New South Wales stations-and these sheep did not thine Expenses of station management were at that time excessive) bein j Fencing in had not been adopted, also the 1 nine German war broke c out and wool went down to no place at all so that sheep farming in this far away legion was found to be any thing but profitable, and many of the pioneer settlers were i lined Vgam, to crown the case of disaster, there came in 1870 a tremendous Hood in the Flinders and other of the large in ers Homesteads were swept away, and thousands of sheep and cattle were drowned Thus it came about that almost the whole Burke district was i elevated to solitude and nitric The roads quickly got obliterated by overgrowth All bush public houses were abandoned, with the exception of one at Normanton, on the Gulf shores and one at the Cloncui i j k)0 miles inland Taking those Cloncui i y mountains as a centre and dest thing with a radius of 100 miles a car cle an omen it, there existed within it an area of no less than 600 miles diameter of the finest possible grazing country in the world, and yet the whole of this was lying almost useless But fortunately there were a few plucky pioneer squatters men who cared naught for comfort or ills comfort, for semi starvation and difficulties, such men as Hann, "W nlkoi, Hetzer, M Intyre, M'Gilluj, Cuthbert, Gibson, Walsh, Sheila, Hayes, and Henry, who recognised that they were settled on the best of land, and that success must perforce come of such a circumstance The glowing success of these at last gradually) dawned upon the mind of the capitalist squatter of the South Then a rush for the country set in that suit passed that of its most prosperous days, every square mile of an area no land was hunted out, the Lands office was besieged and nearly all the hardy faithful pioneers, I am glad to say, sold out at high prices and reaped the reward of then years of self denial and hardship It was just at the time of this feverish race tion towards prosperity that I again found it) self acting as manager of those station upon which at one time had stood that most ment of pioneer ciiihsntion-the Dead Finish Hotel I need not sure how this came about, as it is foreign to the story) , still, if things had not turned out so this tale would never have been written, for it was the extraordinary on cumstance that I have now to relate in connection with the fate of an old stockman, Red Dick, that caused me to hunt up his history and put it on record It was now no uncommon occurrence for parties to pass the homestead one time owned by Mr Stapleton-traioiling with mobs of cattle, and searches new pastoral country These expeditions were lariously equipped, from the light luggage speculate a party of old Queenslanders, with only 600 head of cattle, and pack horses upon which all nations and requirements were carried, to the more combat some and elaborate turn out of the Victorian capitalist, with 1000 to 2000 head of cattle, drays, covered waggon for the owner and family, and other impedimenta very trouble- some in new country where even a of risk is not to be seen, let alone a road One night upon an ii ed at my homestead I found a large mob of cattle camped morn It was evident at a glance, as I took in the surroundings, that the owner was now to the district and probably was a man of capital, and that he intended looking after things himself, for I noticed a comfortable colored tun oiling waggon, and beside it was a woman respectably dressed and evidently of superior bearing Hospitality was, and still is axntuecicijwheio practised in the Burke district, and so any new comers as well as known residents were always muted to pass the night at the home stead After introducing myself to the lady and gentleman, I found that their names were Mr and Mrs Thornley), and during our seen nig s com ci sation was told that they were old Victorian squatters, but that owing to the extinction of the squatter in that colony by the encroachments of the selector former they had decided to be axed to Queensland and search out new pastures, and that they were now bound for the Leichhardt River, where they) had been told some good country was to be got On the load Mr Thornley had fallen in with a well known Gulf man, one Jack Naish, who, for the comfortable consideration of £200, had agreed to show him this unoccupied country ; and pilot the whole lot to it Now, according to the Crown Lands Act of Queensland, it is necessary, before any application can be lodged for previously unoccupied pastoral country, that the applicant make a declaration to the effect that he has iii c head of cattle upon every square c mile of the country applied for, the consequence of this being that there frequently were most exciting races between different parties, each of whom knew of the same space blocks of land, as to which could get his lot of cattle on first Tins being accomplished, the would be now nor had to mount horse and ideas Normanton, perhaps 400 miles distant, and there lodge his application, for the first application lodged got the country j It sometimes happened that two lots of cattle would enter upon the same block on the same day and unknown to each other, and the consternation of the parties when meeting may be imagined. Then each would select his best couple of horses, and the race would be to the one who could outing 01 out dodge the other The tricks resorted to, and these races when won, formed a great source of causing talk at all camp hies Now, Mr Thornley had been anxious to secure 300 square miles of country-a quantity that seemed a large one to him as lately a Victorian squatter although decidedly a small sum to a " Gulf ' man-and so he had provided himself with 1500 head of cattle, but when he had mentioned this to knowing Jack Kalaf this old pioneer had laughed heartily at his "greenness," as he died it, and then explained that with only 500 head he could take up the whole Leichhardt, for all that the Act required was for the applicant to decline that the sum had been stocked, but mentioned nothing as to how long it was to remain stocked. "So he said, "all you have got to do is to travel the 1 505 up one side of the river and down the other, thus stOc'unS each block as j on p last over it, and by this means asks JP 5000 square miles if you like Moieoici,"h0c^t»i»cd)' thcieisanothei mob coming from the Diamantina"; River travelling by the Cloncui i j and Chu a StiVuO". and as far as I could gather from inquiries ttiCJ are bound for these very blocks I am putting on up to so you had better let me push on with 500 head, you can then start for Not manton and make your applications for as much country as you like " To Jack Ralsh s intense disgust Mr Thornley could not be brought to see this in any light than that it was dishonest, to say the least of it "I will not go outside the law and commit perjury for the sake of a bit of country, ' he said what's or other s may choose to do ' Ralsh tried hard to convince him that perjury in the Gulf district, when applied to the evasion of the Land Act, was no perjury at all, that everyone did it, even the magistrates squatters themselves But Mr Thornley was him, and declared that he would not follow their example "Well, then," replied his guide, "there is nothing for it but to take the short cut through the sea rib and pass by the old Dead Finish I don't like doing it, I confess, but you compel me to, for we have lost so much time on the load through eau lying those via etched young c Eyes that I feel those Diamantina follow will be down before us " "Why don't you like going this short cut you speak of ' ' questioned the squatter "Because, in the first place, there is not a vestige of a track for the waggon and drays, and there is a belt of fifty miles of gidya scrub to go through, and I and other doubtful about the water. Also if the rainy season sets in it may aux day-then we should be swamped in the level flooded country around the Alexandra lagoons Then there is another reason, which you will doubtless 1 nigh at, but which any old Gulf man would consider the worst objection of the lot It is that we must camp at the Dead fresh water holes, it being the last water for a stage of twenty five miles through dense scrub, that distance we may man the, although the weather is hot, and those miserable cows and calves of join a will many of them drop behind, but if we do not camp there, as the next water on this side is fifteen miles from it, that would make a stage too long to turn el ' "Well, why not camp at this Dead Finish water hole, as you call it' "Why not Good heavens ' man, don't you know it is haunted by the ghost of Red Dick and that the only mob that ventured to camp there since his death was sentenced to glory by the ghostly stocks in ' "If that is your only reason, Ralsh,' replied the squatter in a most cj mean time, I'll like the chance of the oldest if you will guarantee the twenty fifth mile day stage and the Alex undi i L rooms ' "Oh, it's all very well for you to say Hint, but supposing there is a smash in the cattle, I lose my bonus more) I tell) on, I don't like the ghost although on do sneer at the idea Bullocky Bob s in him once, and so did Jim the can in , also that now chum swell at Bal done, and a mob of blacks camped thieves so frightened by his appearance that they are in by the red white " ' Don 11 ilk such confounded nonsense, Ralsh I thought you were a man of more sense than to believe such camp fire jams 'These ghost seers, blacks included, probably had a bottle of two of Janucson's bi uni) with them that's the most likely solution of the case At an lat 111 pat on the £200 bonus, even if the ghost does scatter the cattle, but what about the scrub ' "Well, if you we will put that in writing I don't think the scrub will troubles so very) much I have twice taken cattle through it, but that was years ago, when the Gulf was full of the usual jolly old stock of fellows and squatters did not trial chain buggies with their wives and baggage " This was intended as a hit it Mr Chomley, for Jack was somewhat nettled at his speeling ridicule about the ghost However, the squatter thought it wise to take no notice of it, and that night he in one out an agreement by which he bound himself to pay Ralsh his money even if the ghost did scatter the cattle, and he told him to come at the Dead Finish water hole and chance it "I could not have ei edited that such superstitions existed in this new country, and in these days of education and scientific discovery, he said to himself, is Jack Walsh left the tent "Supid self opinionated fool! thought Ralsh, as he carefully folded the agreement and put it in his pocket book [TO at CONTINUED]
