'So,' teid he, I you are an. impostor 'as wdllas a gambler f, Tpu are not a fit persou to be a Christian, minister: I shall expose you.'. A; demon' rose suddenly within me. My temper had been , violent as a ..youth, but I had not an ontbunt; for. many : years. This demon within me lifted my hand : I struck bim. Tbe look of contempt and areraon upon the old man's face changed to one of fear. The eight, of his fear maddened me. X seized the heavy-headed stiok that stood beside his . desk, , and struck him fiercely. He threw np his hands. ,X struck them down. He tottered and fell, striking: his head heavily against the tcorner of the desk as he did so, .. I , belie ve that blowldlled him, but. I am none the less.-his slayer. At the side. of. the ..prostrate figure! seemed to come to myself :; again., I knelt, beside him i 1 called him; he did not answer. Then! ?ran. out into the darkness, where Caleb was lying 'npon the^bench. I stripped off my coat ana thrust it upon him. -1 took Ihe hat from my head and pressed it upon his* . Anil then, maddened :by v the - memory of . that old. white-haired, man upon the floor insido, I ran back again.

I rashed-out. into the dadmess again. ^ My God l my God! what darkness have I not groped through sinoe 1' , ; t ... He flung np his hands over his head, and lifted his haggard face, . as if beseeohing pity from a visibly God who sat enthroned some where in the spa^e above him. 4 1 made those passes before Caleb's face whiok had hitherto restored him to oonscious ness. Like my effort to place htm under control before, these attempts : were only partially successful. I seized him by, thearm and 'dragged him down the road towards the bridge. He must have stood where Ihad loft him a long while, for I ran as Oain ran. I made my. hasty call upon the Broad bents. Then X ran out into the night again1 up the canal, stumbling along - Ihe east shore. X i .heard mole, bells along the tow-path :on the other side. X flung myself in the grass until they passed. X heard the boy aiwfwyig as he. ran beside tho mules, and X envied him his light heart. WbatshouldX'doP what should I dof But as I Btumbled along in the dark, after they had passed, X came upon a little flat boat half drawn.up. on the bank. There was a piece of wood. beside it. I poshed the .boat off and paddled over. There X set it 'adrift, and, walking back towards the bridge, X met the oanal-boat with the captain I knew. - I hailed him. X wanted some one to -know X was on that side of the , canal. He fold me the ..bridge-.tender. had . just told him Mr. Atteirly had been murdered. Then I went to. the Manor. I had no peace because of Caleb. What was his state? When I saw him, his coat was blood-stained. They were questioning him,— my God! Again my pride arose : the devil whispered in my oar, * Be silent. You are. not suspeoted. What would it be to the Ohurch if your name should be heard in connection with tbia night's workP' I said a few words, and rushed away out in the night ag%in.

I saw my hope of heaven here, and my hope of heaven hereafter, go down into the bottom less pit .of my awful orime. The day he died for me, as Christ died for other sinners, I died a thousand deaths. And not ' one, — I swear to my hope of forgiveness in some coming age, when. my soul has been purged by an eternity of suffering whioh X would, on, so gladly submit to ! — not pnoe 'was] I deterred from speakings from confessiiig my guilt,' by fear of .the cbnsequeuoes to me.

He staggered a -moment ; in that I moment the doctor's strong arm was around him. The minister's right hand flattered feebly, then groped its way up and hid itself under his ooat over hia heart. The doctor eased him down to the ohair and knelt beside him. f Listen/ he Baid, in a low bat intense voice. -* Listen ; try to hear me.1 He placed his lips olose to the dulling ear and whispered two or three words. So iutense was his desire to com* munioate this tidings, of whatever nature, to the man in his armB that he plaoed one hand over the right hand under the ooat and shook it slightly. 1 Tlie 'minister's head ' was ' against'his shoulder : again he vphiBpered his -message. The - eyelids fluttered, . the eyes opened for an instant, and the whole body thrilled as if electrified. He tried to stagger to his feet, with his face full of wonder and happiness, the radianoe of an expression whose like no eye there had ever seen upon a haman faoe before. And; turning thus as if ' to. repeat this message to the world, witb the i'oy and wonder ot it on his oountenanoe, his lead fell baokward upon the doctor's shoul der, the clinched right hand relaxed and slipped out to clasp feebly with the left, and both ' lay quietly folding1 the dead young mother's pioture over the still heart. CHAPTER XX. Ontslde the night was wil d an d frosty . In tbe belt of timber where the whippoorwill sang in the past the - wind whined and howled as though ghosts of the old paok were abroad, and dead leaves rustled and whirled as . if Rent flying by their sourrying feet. Somewhere ahead the wraith of the red fox .might be running, ' the ' red fpx whose desoendan^' had been taught to fear the trap and gun more than the yelping paok. And this wild nijrht put its dark hands against the sash ana shook the oourt-house windows nntil they rattled again. The dark* ness pressed thiok and black against the panes and peered .into the court-room, where lamps smoked and flickered In little currents of air rushing in through shrunken case ments. The litter of books and legal docu ments upon one of the long tattles had been' ! pushed aride, and upon this the prisoner lay with his white face gleaming in the lamp light and his hands still in the position 'in ' whioh they had been placed by his last con scious effort. Two or three physioians struggled out of the orowd, and with Dr. Matneson made a brief examination of that figure stretched but so qoiotly among the papers that had been evidence against it. The thrcfog of the semi-lighted rear of. the , room remained spellbound in its cramped and wearisome positions, mi conscious of its own discomforts in' the absorbing interest of the aoene before it. Many people hod prept at the nunister's recital, and -now and then^ Sob here and; there in the crowd, or a long, quivering ' «gh, testified that some Matbewon. who flx^^Wjipbn wiists of d ithe-'nwui liQ. had iSted to &e; iable, said, ^emriy,— ^ : [ , rToar honor, ihe prisoner %t the bar has indeed passed before that Higher Tribunal of whioh he spoke. . 'He is dead. I believe,'— and the dootor turned to include the. room as he continued, * I believe that he died happy because 3of my message to him. X have this' same message to deliver to you, for I believe that your. Eejoioing will be only. seoond to that of the' suffering soul that 'just passed among us. ( It is a long story, bat it . supplements and completes .the one proceeding it. It olears tho mysteries that nave for so long a time made' the Manor aud Mystery synonymous words. I must go baok to the day of tbe execution of Caleb Newal, and in ao doing it wtfl'notbe necessary forme, to repeat what. X have so often repeated to many of you as . individuals, and to all of you in this court room, about my confidence in the innooence of my friend. I have established that in nooence. I have fulfilled the vow X made upon.lus scaffold to clear his name of every stain npon .it.- Batl^ ^ have now to relate to you a Btory stranger than any you have list-, ened to here. - . *It Will be remembered my many of you that after the execution I myself conveyed the biody of my friend to the Manor.
