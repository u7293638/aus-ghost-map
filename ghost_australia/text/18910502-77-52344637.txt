The day after the burned visit of Agnes to the Park had been ont. of guthenug daikness, and exhaustion to the young eull'erer He was so ill und had beeu ill so long that the interest of the household had almost come to an end There vi as nothing to be done for linn, not cien the beef tea to picparc, the variety of driuks w hich had kept up u certain link ot service between the sick room aud the rest of the house All that seemed ovci Ho had passed fiom the necessities of life while still living, und no» there not, nothing but u half impatient w ail ing-n longing of strained nerves and attention for the end of the suspense-till all should be over, and the little talc told out Letitia, who felt herself the chief person involved, did not feel even impatient that da) It was by thus time a foregone con elusion, a question of time The doctoi even had said scarcely anything, had out) shaken his head, and even the cheerful nurse, the woman of daylight and good hope, was daunted, and did not repeat her better auguries John who had niuided his wife, w ho lind refused to discuss the subject, now let her speak, sitting w Uli hu head bent on his breast, and making little reply, but stiU listening to what she said She had a great man) plans, indeed had drawn out in her active mind a whole scheme of proceedings for their future guidance, or changes to be made both for pleasure and profit, things of much more importance than these alterations tn the house on which she had set her mind the first time Bhe caine into it Letitia spoke low, but she spoke boldl), bidding her bus band remember that though it was very sad it was a thing that had always been necessary to look forward, and that after all it was his just inheritance that was now coming to bun. Aud Jolm had not stopped hei to da). It was all true enough The poor boy had been an interruption to the course of events, and now things were returning to then natural course He had u soft heart, aud it was soie for the poor boy, but Letitia had reason on her side, and what she said ,wos not to be refuted or despised She was ver) busy that dal, not going out for her drive or receiving an) visitors, not even any of the anxious inquirers who caine to beg for a little more nifoi matron than the bulletin gave-theclenc.il people about, and the nearest neighbours, w horn hitherto she had aUovved to enter ver) busy in her own room planning out a great man) things It would make a change to ev ei y liod) -a different st) le of hv mg, a great extension and amplification would now not only be possible but necessary She put it all dow n on panel, making out her arrangements systematically, which was an exercise that she lovel If the poor boy lingered for a week longer that would make no difference after all ishe had ptomised to Duke to send for lum if Mar became worse , but she decided that she would not do so, for what would be the goodv Mar was for too weak to take an interest in an)one, perhaps even to recognise his cousui And Letitia felt that she could not bear the nols) grief w ith vi Inch her son would no doubt receive the newe wInch was the best news for him that could possibly be It was bad enough to sec Lett) with her red eyes moping about the house, and Tiny dev otuig herself to her lessons as if the mortification of her soul over thcin »as more appropriate to the crisis than anything she cared for Little fools ' w ho did not know what was to their advantage' But even to them it would not make the difference it would make to Duke For Duke there could be no doubt it was the one thing to be desired, jet Letitia knew he would make a greater fuss than even the girls w ere doing, and this she could not bear Next momuig she was a little latci than usual m lcav ing her room. She had not slept well Her mind had been so full of all that she had to do It ivas not anxiety that kept her awake, for au MO tv had almost left her in the ccrtaiut) of v hat was going to happen, but merely the pre occupation of her mind and the responsible} on her shoulders of seeing that ever) thing vi as done in tins emergenc) so as to secure the npprov al of the world Though hernund uusfull of exultation she lias most anxious not to show it, not to be spoken of as heartless or w orldl) A slight fear that she had committed herself to the attendants of the sick loom, and that thev hod Eeneirated hei true feclmirs, ti onblcd her a ttle , but w lint did a couple of nurses matter'' She was so late that mornmg that she did not as usual sec the night nuise willi her lugubrious countenance shaking hei head as she went to take her neccssar) icst Letitia liked the night nurse best She had alwa)s thought the othci too hopeful, but w hat did it matter now w hat one thought or the other '' She went direct to the sick room wheu she left her own, putting on as she went the necessary solemnity of countenance w it li w Inch to receive what there would be no doubt would be bad new s It startled her a little lo beat an unusual murmur of voices in the ante room where the doctor was m the habit of pausing to gil e his directions She could not hear ii bat the) said, but there was something m the tone of the consultation which struck her, like a Budden dart thrown from some unseen hand What did it mean* She went into the room quickly, her composure distill bed, though she would not allow herself to think there was a») i reason What reason could there be * The lirst ] thing Letitia saw was the nurse cr)ing-the chcei ful nurse-the fool of an optimist who hud ni» ays said he w ould get b'tlci Ah ' all vi as 01 or then» This woman had the folly to allon herself to get interested m the cote, and, besides, might well be cryiug too for the end of a good job \ spint of muhec and fierce opposition somehow spiung up in Letitia s mind, and prompted this mean thought V cs it was the end of a good joh, of good feeding aud good pay, and veri casyvioik rtowoudei she cried , and to make herself interesting too, in the doctor's eyes This flashed tluougli Mrs Parke s mind in a second, while she was walking into the room It broke up her ealin, but rather w ith a fierce impulse of impatience and desire to take the huss) b) the shoulders than with an) real foal The doctor vius stooping over the tiblc w riting a prescription A prescription ' \\\ hat did the) w ant with such a thing no« * He looked up w hen he hcaid her step His face was beaming He put down hispen mci caine forn ard, holding out both hands " I have the liest of news for)ou this morning, my deai lad), ' lie said Letitia w as too much startled to speak She would not, eould not, pel mil herself to believe her c)cs She drew her hands impatiently from his clasp " The crisis has come-and passed, ' he said " The lever has gone I find his temperature almost noi mai, and the pulse quite quiet " "What* said Letitia She would not believe her ears Sho had no tune to regulate her countenance to look as if she were glad Her jaw fell, her eyes glared " What' she said, and she could say no mole "I do not wonder yon arc overcome I feel m)sc1f ab if it were too much Sit down and take a moment to recover-' She sat down mechanically andglarcdat lum Hir feeling was that if theic had been a knife on the table she would have struck at linn nith it-a sharp one, that would have turned that Birnie into a grimace and made an end of it Too much ' The fever gone, gone, Sho panted for breath, fiel eely, like a wild beast "It is wonderful, but it is true, said Dr Barker Be added after a moment, " it IS curious the different way« we take it., .(Fads good little woman, who always hoped the best-cries-and you, Mrs. Parke, you-" "Do you mean that he will.live!" Letitia said. " I hope so-I hope so. The only danger now is weakness : ii ive can feed him up and keep him quiet. It is ? all a question of strength-" { "You have said that ever since you were called in." I " Ah, yes, that is true, but in a different sense. Strength to struggle with a fever is one thing ; strength to pick up when it is goua is another. Yesterday, every moment the fire was flaming, burning out his life-now every moment isagaiu. Look at him. He's asleep. He hasn't been asleep, to call sleeping-not honest sleep-for days and nights All this was but as the blowing of the wind to Letitia. She did not hear the words. Sho heard only over and over again : " tlicfever has gone- But by this time abo bad begun to call iicr strength to her, to remember dully that she must not betray herself. She interrupted the doctor in the midst of his phrase. " Do you mean that he will live Î" she said agaui "As long I hope," saul the doctor, prompt') " as ins best friends could desire " I don't seem to understand," Letitia said " I thought all hope was over I thought he n as d) ing Why did \ ou make mc think so and my husband, too v "I um sorry if I havegivcnyou unnecessar) pam Mrs Parke-' "Oh, unnecessar) ' it «aball unnecessary, I suppose, i ou have-)ou have frightcued us foi nothing, Dr Bai ker gil en us such da)s and uights ' She broke into a little w ild laugh " And all the time there was nothing iu it ' ' she cried The nurse had di led lier c) es and was staring at this Btrange exhibition, and Letitia had begun to perceive that she had got out of her own control, and could nut recover the command of her words and looks She had been so taken b) surprise, so ovcru helmed by the Budden shod» that the commotion in her brain was like madness It was all she could do not to shriek out, to fl) at the spectators like a wild cat Ho« dared they look and see w hat she hud not the strength to conceal ' "I will go, and coll John, he will tell you what he thinks, she said, n ith the impulse of a maddened woman to bring a man's strength into her quand and punish hir adversary W.at she thought John could do to Dr Barker she did uot know and indeed she did not go to tell John She returned to her room which she had left ouly a few minutes before and from which she chased the frightened housemaids with a stamp on the floor which made them fly wildl), leaving brooms and dusters behind The windows were all opeu, the sunshine bursting in in a great twinkling of hghtafteryesterday s ram She locked the door that she might be aloue, and closed the w indo« s one after another with a sound like thunder lo give expression to the tage that dev cured hei was soiucthiug a ueccssit), the ouly wa) of gcttmg out hcrpassion The fever gone, the fever gone ' the fever which was her friend, which had woikcd for her, which had firouused everything-everything that her leart desire!

" My God ' ' said Dr Barker, who was not so restrained " She is wild with disappoint nient and rage Did Bhe wish the lx>y to diev "Oh, doctor-she wished her own boy to be in his place, ' said the nurse, w ho perhaps had a semi matet nal light upon the mutter The doctor kept on shaking nis head as he finished hu prescription " Don t wukc linn foi this or anything-not oven for food but give lum the food as I told you " "I know, I know, ' said the nurse on whom the overstrain of hei nenes was telling, too, " don't yon think I know, sir, how impôt tant it is " Dou t you go ofT, too-don t leave lum for a moment Avoid all noise or discussion lr) and keep cicr)one out, especially He did not finish Ins sentence, hut it was iinnceessaiy "All I can do, doctoi-all I eau do But Mrs Parke is the unstress of the house "She will not co-nc backagain, he said, "she will be in a temblé fright when bhe knows how she betrayed hcisclf Poor thing ' as )ou sav it was to put her boy in his place Thcv w ere w lid before w lien this boy was horn \\\ eil, pel haps theic is some excuse for them ' But you w ill come back to night """ "I should think so, indocd, ' he said, "and bcfoi c to night And I shall see John Pal ke as I go ' But by that étrange influence which nobody can explain, before the doctoi left the room the neus had somehow flashed through the house The fcvci gone ' John Parke caine out into the hall as Di Barker carne downstairs " Is it true" he said It would be vam to assert that lhere was not a dull throb which was not of plcusuie or gratitude through John Parke s being wheu that rumour had come to lum The cup was dashed from Ins Ups again, and this t une for ev ei He had to pause x moment ni the library, where he wae sitting, thinking involuntarily of the new life, to gulp down something-which shamed him to the bottom of ins heart But w hen he caine out to meet the doctor that ver) shock had brought all hie tenderer feelings back " Is it true * he said, with a quiver of emotion ni Ins voice And at that moment Lett) carne flying m from the paik and flung herself upon his neck, and kissed lum like a whirlwind "Oh, papa, Mars better she saul, her voice between a soft shout and song of joy ringing tin ough the gi cat house The was no doubt, no hesitation in Let v s rapture and thankfulness And it was with almost as true a heart, uotwitli standing his momentary pang of feeling, that lohn giasped the doctoi's hand and said "Thankt od How the ne« s i an through the house ' It was known before it was ever spoken at all to the cook, who immediately lose from the retirement in wInch she «as considering her menu and oidercd a delicate young chicken to be prepared to make soup "I know what's «anted after a fever Something bevor) hour, said that diguitur) It swept up like a breeze to the housemaids upstairs busy with their work "Oh, that's what's put the Missis in such u passion, ' the) said with unerring logic 1 iny, released from hei lessons by the same liistiuctiv c consciousness of something, danced a w lid jig round the hall to the lune of " Mar s better. Mar 's better ' with all hu han floating about bet, and her shoes coming off in her frenzy And thus nature and human feeling held the day and reigned triumphant, notliwithstanding the fierce tragedy, indescribable, terrible-a passion which rent the veiy soul, and to which nocrime, no horror was impossible, which raged and exhausted itself m the silence, shut up with itself and all devilish impulses in the best room, m the bosom of the mistress of the house C SAI TER \LVI Letitia was a long time in hei room, and was not visible at all downstairs during the moment of gladness winch changed the aspect of everything Her door remained locked all the morning, and the housemaids were shut out, unable to " do ' the room, which was the most curious interruption cf all the laws of life The bed was not made, nor au) thing sw cpt nor dusted at noon when Bhe appeared downstairs-a thing which had never happened before ni the house, which never happens in any respectable house except in cases «Milnes«. Missis'«-room too, the most important of all 1 Nobody saw what wooton inside in those two long hours. Perhaps only John divined the strain which was going on In his wife's mind, and he but imperfectly, having little In his own nature of the poison in hers. And John took very good care not to disturb Letitia. He would neither go him- self nor let Letty go to make «ure that her mother knew the good news about Mar., or to see if she were ill or anything wrong. .'Sho was snre to know, he said I and no doubt she bad something to do which kept her in her room. But there was also no doubt that he was somewhat nervous himself at her long disappearance. Two hours she was invisible, which for the mother of a family and the mistress of a house is a very long time. When she carne downstairs Bhe lud her bonnet on and was going out. She had ordered the brougham though it was a very bright and warm day, and announced that she was going to Ridding for some shopping she hod to do, but wauted no one to go with her-nor were they to wait luncheon for her should she be late. " You have heard of course, Letitia, about Mar.," John said, as he came out with his old-fashioned politeness to put his wife into the carriage. "Is tlieicanything new about Mar elie said, with a sort of disdain "Oh, mamma, lies better1 The fever is gone, he is going to get well, cried Tiny, who was still dancing about the hall " Is that all * said Mrs Parke, " I heard that hours ago -and she droi c away vi ithout a emile, without a word of satisfaction, or even pretended satisfaction-her face as blank as if it had been cut out of stone They watched the carriage turn the corner into the ivenue with i chill at their healts "Waa mamma angry* Tiny asked John Parke made no answer to his child e question, but went imok to the library, and took up his paper with a heavy heart He had felt it himself, more «hame to him, more or leas a sort of horrible pong of disappointment but she-it troubled lum to -du ino how she must lie feeling it What awful sensations and sentiments were in her heart ' It was Lot for herself, John said, trying to excuse her-it was for Duke and for him. If she only wou-d understand that he did not gund, that he was glad, ver) glad, that his brothers son was getting better, that Mar was far too much like his own child to make his recovery any thing but a happy circumstance < John s heart ached for that unmoving fixed face Oh if she could be persuaded that neither Duke nor he would hal e been happy in the promotion that came through harm to Mar ' Letitia sank back in the corner of the brougham where nobody could see She had been in almost a frenzy of rage and nain, walking about the room, throwing herself on the sofa and even on the floor m the abandon ment of her fierce misery, hurting herself like a passionate child No shame no pride had restrained her She had locked her door and closed lier Windows and givcu herself up to the parox)sm which wouldllave been shameful if anyone had seen it-yet which gave a certain horrible relief to the sensations that rent her to pieces To have it all snatched from her hands again when she had made up her mind to it, when everything was so certain ' To be proved a fool, a fool, again trusting in a chance w Inch never would come It seemed to Letitia that God was her enemy, and a malignant one, exulting ui her disappointment, laughing at her pangs She was too angry, too cruelly outraged to be content with thinking of chance or that it was her luck, as some people say She wanted someone to hate for it-someone whose fault it was, w horn she could rev ile and affront and def) to his face The deception of circum stances, the disappointment of hopes, the cruel way lu which she had been lulled into security only to be the more bitterly awakened from her illusion, made her mad Not as Maiy had been mide mad, not with any confusion of mind but with a horrible and intense subversion, a sense of being at war with everything, and living only to revenge herself upon God and man She lind revenged herself upon herself first of all, beating her head against the «all, digging hei nails into her flesh, because she had been such a fool, oh, such a fool ' as to lieliei c that w hat she wished was to be And then there formed ni muid an awful thought, a movement of resistance, a refusal to be overtluoivn. She would not, she w ould not allon herself to be {iloycd with, to he beaton, to be foiled, to lave the cup snatched from her lips just when she was about to drink No, she would not submit' Though God was the Mastei, yet there were wa)s of overcoming Hun-yes there were wa) s of overcoming Though He said life, a human creature though so weak, if she had but courage enough, could say death, and He would not he able to picient it In the madness of her disappointment and lebelbon there came into Letitia s ui|ud a suggestion, au idea. It did not sccin so much in order to hav e hei ow n w ill, and her ow n advantage, as in ordet to cet the betta of God, who had shaped things the othci «ay Ho thought, pcrlmjis, there was nothing she could do, that bhe would have to beal it No, then she vi oui 1 not' He should sec He was a t)ratit He had the power but lhere were wa}s of baffling linn-thcic was a wa) Never in ill Letitia s struggles had this thought come into her mind before Mar had been helpless in her hands foi )ears hut her aim had never armed itself against lum She had nev cr sought to harm lum H she li id exaggerated and cultivated his weakness it had been half, as she said, in a kind of scornful piceaution, that nothing might happen to lum in her house and half from a grudge, lest he should emulate her own sturdy bovs, over whom he had so great and undeserved nu uU au tage She had never thought of harming him After, when he w as rcaU) ill, when Proi idence itself (for her mind could he pious when this influence which shapes events was on her side) had seemed to arrange for Ins removal as she piousl) said, to a better world, it would have been more than nature had not her mind rushed forward to that ev idently approaching conclusion which would make so great a difference Oh, the difference it would make ' enough to deaden the sense of I it) to sharpen eveiy covetous desire But still she had not thought of do ne anything to secure the end she dean ed No, no' all the otliei wiy-nothing had been neglected, nothing refused that would help him-nothing except hei desire her sti ong unspoken w ish, had been against him And what had that to do with the issue one way or the other'' A woman cannot piay lo God that a bo) may die Ilma the only unfair advantage which the inteiisit) of hei wiall might have gncn her vi as taken aw a) On the othci side they had this unfair adv antere- they could pray, and pray us long as they pleased if that «as any good She had only her strong, persistent never suspended wish Nothing nothing had she done aganiBt lum She had never once thought of assisting or hastening fate But now that God had tuincd cveiything the wrong w ay and dashed the cup fi oin her lips, and set Himself against beg no» in the frenzy that filled her liosom, the lace, the shame, the rebellion, the wild nnii over whelming passion, a new furious light had blazed in upon the boiling wai es Ah, God «as great, the) said He could restore life when everything pointed to another conclusion He could w ork a miracle-but a womau could fod Him She could kill though He made alive A moment of time, an insigntficant action-and all His healing aud restoration would come to nothing Where dill it conic from-that awful suggestion* How did it anse'' In what way was it shaped' Troin what scourcc did it come the horrible thoughtv It caine cutting through her mind and all her agitation in a moment as if it had been flung into her saul from outside It caine like a flash of lightning, like an arrow, like a pointed dart that cut into the flesh It was not lliore one moment, and the next it was thcie, dominating all the commotion, penetratinj, all the fever and the tumult-u master thought She drove along the country roads in the corner of her coinage, seeing nothing through the noonday sunshine and the Bhade of the trees, through -villages and by corn- field« where the storing of the 'harvest had begun-and heard nothlngand notloednothlng. At last she pulled the string strongly and told the coachman not to goto Ridding but in the other direction to another little town, to a certain house whero she had a call to make. And she made the call ; and came out of the house while the coachman was walking his horses up and down, and'Went into the chief street of the place and made a few Ïiurchases, then returned to the house of her riend and got into tho brougham and drove home. The coachman had not been aware that she hod done anything but come out of the house Where «he had been calling when he drew- np. And he drove home very quickly, having himself come ont before his dinner hour, a thing that did not please him. Letitia was very pole when she came home tired with her long drive, hut she rat her luncheon and did not again shut herself from lior family nor did she avoid speaking of Mar. She went to look at him after she had rested a little. " But I see very little difference," she said. " He secmB to mc just us ill as over, ton weak to move, and scarcely opening his eyes. " " But the fever has gone, they all cried together. Letitia shook her head " I hope the doctor was not mistaken,' she Bald Her words threw a cold chill upon the household after the delight of the morning But that was all "Missis was ulwajs one to take the worst view of everything, the cook remarked, to whom the undeniable proof of improvement which Mar had shown by swallowing his chicken broth «as a pi oof that needed no confirmation She sent upa little of the same broth to Mrs Parke, hearing that she had n headache, and received a message back to the effect that the Boup was ver) good and that it must be kept always going al«a)s read), as the )nnng gentleman was able to take it "But I li try lum with a bit of chicken to morrow, no more slops, ' said the cook Thus, though she shook her head and owned that she was not herself so hopeful os Dr Barker, Letitia sanctioned more or less the satisfaction of the household, and spent the afternoon in a legitimate way bhe was frightfully pale and complained of a head ache, which she partly attributed to fatigue and partly to the sun Yet she saw one or two people « ho called, and explained Mar 's condition to them "presumably so much better, she said, ' but I fear, I fear the doctor takes too sanguine a view A week Jience, if all is well-But," she said, "the 'strain of suspense is terrible, almost worse than anythuig that is certain " There were people who Bau her that da) who declared afterwards that tliev could not understand why it was said of Mrs Parke that chu had no heart VMry, if there ever was a vi oman who felt deepl), it was Mrs Parke. The Buspeiuc about her poor nephew and his long illness had worn tier to a shadow , it had nearly killed her-especially as, poor thing, she was not one who took a cheerful view Letitia paid scierai \ isits m the evening to the sick room, or to the ante room connected with it, after the nujit uui se had begun her dutv The other -attendant was not in svm patfiy with the mistress of I he house out she stood with the night nurse at the door of the room and peel ed at Mar , and they mutually shook then beads and gave each other meaning looks "I wish I could see him with Nurse Robinson's c)es,' the atten dant said, and Mrs Parke replied with a sigh that she hoped most earnestly the doctor was not mistaken " Tor I see no difference, Nurse "And neither do I, ma'am," said the gloomy w oman She paused for a moment, and then sic added m a whisper, "I've no business to interfere, but I can't hear to see you looking so pale, I do wish, Mrs Parke that yon would go to bed " I thought the same of you, nurse said Mrs Pai ko, "indeed I wanted to offer to sit up half the nnjit to let you have a little rest " "Thank you, very much, but I must keep to my post,' the tv oman said "Then you must let me eile jon some of my cordial' said Mrs Parke "I have an old mixture lh.it has been in the family foi a long time You must take a little of it from my hand , it will strengthen you " There was a little argument over this, nil whispered at the door of Mar '» room, and at last the nurse consented She was so touched that when Letitia caine back carrying the drink, she ventured to give Mrs Parke atnnidkiss, and to say, " Deai lady, I wish you would go to bed )ourself and get a good rest It is almost more trying when one begins to hope, and you are frightfully pale Letitia took the kiss in very good part (for the nurse was a lady) and promised to go and rest It vi as still caily, the household not yet settled to the quiet of the night, und John had not come upstairs so that tlicie was nobody to note Letitia s movemente, who vunt and caine through the half lit corridor in a dal 1 di CSSIIIL, gonn, and with a noiseless foot, stealing fioni hei nwu loom to tint of the patient She had mude this little pilgrimage sei eral times when, listening m the anteroom she heaid at lost the hcav), icgular breathing of the attendant ni Mar's room, which proved to her that w hat she intended had come to pass Letitia paused for a moment outside the door She was a little, light w oman, still slim, and thin as in her lounger days She moved like a ghost, making no sound , but u hen she perceived that all was leady for her purpose, there was something that almost berra) ed her, and that was the labouring, gasping breath of excitement, winch it was alf she could do to keep down Her lungs, hei heart, were so strained by the effort to be calm that hei hurried respiration carne like the breath of a furnace, hot and litten uptcd She stood hold ing on to the framework of the door, looking in from the comparative light of the room in which she stood to the shaded room m which Mar lay, w ith the li(Jit falling upon the table by his bedside, where were Ins drinks and medicines-and faintly upon the white pillow with the dark head sunk upon it, ni a ghostly stillness The nurse sat in an easy chair behind, out of the light, with hei head fallen buck, wrapped in sleep, bieuthing icgularly and deep Letitia s cod nud watched for a whole long minute, which might have been a year, peering with hei w hite an 1 gh istly face, like a visible spmt of evil \\\ lien she had a little subdued the pautiug of her lieait she pushed the door noiselessly, and stole into the i oom She kept her eyes upon tlu sleeping nurse, ready to draw hack if she should move but that was the onh intciruption Lctitn feared She had left the door open foi hei own safe retieat It had not occurred to her that anyone could folio« belum! her She went ovci to the bedsi le to the table on which ,the light fell And then she stood still again foi another tcuihlc moment Did her heart fail her did any hand of grace hold her back ?
