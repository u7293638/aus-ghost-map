THE BEECHEB SCANDAL. __ _ _ The San Franciaoo Examiner says;— '-othing could be more wid« of tbe mark than the idea en tertained in same quarters that the Plymouth Church scandal is to be permitted to lie dormant and suffered to dio from old age. As far as the public is concerned, of course, it' the whole hideous thing could be b«riod in oblivion it were well ; and Beecher's partisans might pursue their efforts to cover up the skeleton and exorcise the ghost undisturbed.

Buddington . and Storrs are said to be at the bottom, is already afloat, to reinves tigate the whole case, as between Beecber and the Tilton family by a general conclave of the Con gregational Churches, and the anxiety of Plymouth to escape going to the foundation of tho matter will avail nothing.
