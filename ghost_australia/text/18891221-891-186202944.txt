I was just sufficiently awake to follow what my gobd aunt said, but I Uxtk no interest in it. I had not even sufficient energy left to raise a blush at the reference to my eccapade with the looking-glass. I made my toilet mechanically, went downstairs,.ate on excellent, dinner— when did a boy ever fail in this part of his duty ?—and fell asleep immediately afterwards in the draw ing-room.-. .. I slept all tlie evening, .but net all the time, quite soundly.*. At times fragments of th«- con versation reached me. but tlicv seemed to come from averv Jong way ^11.. I thought I heard my uncle say/"" I've a great mind to get a feather and tickle his nose," iuidrWj: Auntrejcined, " Oh, let the poor, boy alone, 1'rank; yon know he's been tiavellhig.all day,' 'and is quite done tip." I also.had.'at que time a kind qf consciousness that" a"'visitor "was arriving—I may cren have shaken hands with. her. J rather think I did,' but.ifc was 'all in a. mechanical sort of way. FinalIy,T heard iny uncle, who was an athletic giant, remark, "If*his room is ready,'! think 111 carry the little beggar up to bed, holl sleep more comfortably • there. Of. course, there's a fire in the room, isn't there t'"... " Yes," said my aunt "Then I'll take him up and get him to undress, and light a night-light, and hell bo all right" ... I then felt myself lifted by the good-natured giant and carried up more stairs tiian I had been accustomed to mount. I got myself undressed somehow, and scrambled into a very comfortable bed^-ob, the.. delicioits sensation!—and what happened next Ido* not know in the least, for hi a second I wai fast asleep. I jdo not suppbSc'I ever slept more lormdly in my lifeV But I'woke at last, and with a start. I was conscious that it v;as some noi-e that li.ul made me awake thus"suddenly, but what the noiso was I did not know. I sat up in bed and listened,'with'eyes'drowsily blinking. The noise was reputed. It was like that of some falling object, ahd it evidently came from a" large wall cupboardin a recess near the door. It made me feel nWyous/ahd my Rervou&ne.vs; dispelled my sleepine&g.;/I'.tried to make out. whore I* was. Thw/e isjalways something 'peculiar*'in the sensa tion of waking upsuddenly. in a ftrunge loom, f and tliis.rooxn >i*aK;perfwtly'stniiige to me. All at once if flashed across my : mind that I was at Mayfield, in; iiiy' uncle's house, and not in the room I usually occupied. But if so, in what / room? " I glanced round-the chamber more' curiously.. The fire was still alight, though burning low, but the night-light had either not been lighted or had gorio.out. All at once the log sank down in the fire, and a flame flashed up for a-moment.. I held ' my breath, for in that moment I had, seen two carved figures of mer maids.,'ono' on each sido of the mantelpiece. Mrs. '-'Werdmore's account • recurred to my memory. I was in the haunted room! • * • • The first thing ,a boy does when ho is fright ened fat night is to draw the - bedclothes in stinctively over lus head ns tho first and most natural protection. I did this; but, after a few minutes, tho arrangement did not satisfy me. Tho atmosphere * is too much like- that-of; the metropolitan railway j and, besides, ■ you can't help thinking that, if anythirig - is going to happen to you, you would prefer to know something about it beforehand. So after a while I drow down the bedclothes, and looked cautiously round tho room again. • Tho fire was; burning a littlo more brightly, and I saw that on the1 wash-stand was a night-light, together with a box of matches. Summoning .up all my courage, I jumped out of bed/stuck»a match, arid lighted the night-light Darkness * makes cowards of us all; a light, if not always'a pro-; tection, is always a comfort, and I never«felt more grateful for one than T did on this occa sion. • ' : \- I did not liko the mermaids, but I stood a moment in front of tho fire. The light/had revived my courage; hut I kept looking round the room; and listening. Say what you will, it is not nice to be ' in,; a - haunted room, even - though tho. haunting rests - on - ho better authority than that of some, foolish jMre. Werdmore. •• .' - Suddenly, as I stood! 'there, ' something or other seemed; to ; fall inside the cup board with-" a: great "noise. " I started;• I did not like this inexplicable noise. 'Then all at 011001 formed a sublime resolution. I would look into that cupboard, cost me what it might. IM could find anything to accountUor. the noise,. it would relieve my mind of half its terror; if not, well, then I would leave tho room, even if I had to pass the rest of the night on the stairs. One thmg seemed to favour the scheme. The cupboard stood'near the door; I could, there fore, readily make mjT escape if necessary. 2kly clothes were on a chair. I took them up, as i thougliwt .would ixj wcii.to'.nave tliein with me, if I we& compelled-to qint the room suddenly.-' Thetil took the.precaution to open* the door ^quite. .wide, and advanced towards the cupboard, night-light in hand. ' The door of the cupboard was tail and wide. The key was in the lock. With lips compressed, but hancLthat. trembled, I turned the key and opened the door. Then I uttered a shriek, droppedf the light, and. fled from the room. Luckily the moon was shining 011 the stairs, or I might have broken iny neck. I leaped ,two stairs or more at a tiuwLto the very., bottom of the home. The kitchen-door was open—I rushed in—a fire was burning, I flung myself into the fat. cooks easy-chair, .aud -sat. there; with excitement, "and ^casting. nervous 'glauces towards tl^e .door" to"' sle/Lf-I were pursued.' \V.! " pursi r..ir What h>/l I seen ? .^fra.'

Werdmore. As she had Imh ro correct in her description of the ghost's apjKtaraiico, ro there, was good ground to noj>o that she was equally correct with respect tovits lieing a stay-at-home | ghost, or, to use her expression, 4" a Homer." 1 This thought comforted nie a little. By degrees I grew more and more certain that I was safe where I was. and that it would not follow nit*.. After a while, I looked at the kitchen clock that was ticking cheerily close to my, right ear. What'had" taken place had not taken'place at the witching hour of midnight; forit was already o o'clock. At (►, or half-past, the servants would come down, and T should bo no longer by ray;, self.' That '"reminded" me of my toilet. My clothes were still in iny hand; I;put." theni on,' and felt in even- way more comfortable. If ghosts have to be interviewed at all, it is better' to do so in full costume—it gives a certain am fidencc as well us warmth. The kitchen-maid, a plump, good-natured girl, was the first to appear upon the scene, and was a little startled to find a young gentleman in |jo.-:*e».sion of her domain. X told her the truth, but not quite all of it. 1 said J had not been able to sleep, and had come down there for warmth and comfort. She had no reason' to object, a*; 1 had kept up the fire nicely for her— and myself. The only person 1 meant to tell of my adven ture was iny aunt; and, to do this, 1 liad to wait,' i»nt i! she should come down, which she generally did before any of the others.
