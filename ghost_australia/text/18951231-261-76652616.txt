i Caldwell at Springfield. I ITrnK'a the spot. Look around you. Above on the height Lav the Hessians encamp?. - Ã®dy the church on thc right Stood the flaunt Jersey (armers. And here ran a wall Too may dig anywhere and you will turn op a ball. Nothing more. Grasses spring, waters run, flowers blow Pretty much aB tbe; did ninety-three years ego. Nothing more did I say ? Stay one moment ; you've heard OE Caldwell, the parson who once preaohed Ibo word Down at Springfield? What I No? Come, that's bad. Why he bad All the Jerseys aflame. And they gave him the nama Of the " rebel high priest." Ho stuok in their gorge, For bo loved the Lord Oed-and be hated King George I He had cause, you might say, when the Hes sians that day Marched ap with Knypbaueen, they stopped on their way At the " Farms," where his wi(e, with a obild in her arms, Sat alone in the house. How ithsppencd none knew But God-end one of the hireling crew Who Bred the shot. Enough I There she lay, And Caldwell, the chaplain, her husband, away 1 Did bc preaoh-did he pray ? Think of him, as you stand By tbe old church to-day ; think ot him and that band Of military cowboys I See the smoke and (be heat Ol that reckless advance-of that struggling retreat I Keep the ghost of that wife foully slain in youl view And what could you-what should yon, what would you do? Why, just what he did I They were lett in tbe lurch, For want of mora wadding. He ran to (bc church, Brolio the door, stripped the pews, and dashed out in the road With his arms full of hymn-books and threw down bis load At their feet I Then above all the shoutioc and shotB Bang his voioe : " Put Watts into 'em, boys ; give 'em Watts." And they did. That is all. Grasses spring flowers blow, Pretty much as they did ninety-three yean ago: Ton may dig anywhere end you'll turn np I ball, But not always a hero like this-and that'i all.
