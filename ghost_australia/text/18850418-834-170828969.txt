For Those Who Fail. 'All honour to him who shnll win tbepri/e,' The woild has cried for a thousand years ; But to him 'who trios and who fails and dies I give great honour and glory and tears Qivoglory and honour and pitiful tears , To nil who fail in their deeds sublime, Their ghosts ire found m the van of yrais , They were horn with tune nuuUanciof time Oh',1 great is 'the hero' wlio wins a name, But grciter many and many a time 'Some pilp'-fiiced 'fellow who dies hi shiune And lets God ttuiali the thought sublime. 'And great is the man! with a sword undrawn, Arid good is:the min who refrains from wino ; But the man iwho fails, and yet still lights on, Lo, he is the twin-born brother of mine. '''' ?
