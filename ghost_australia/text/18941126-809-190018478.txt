" FINANCE AND TRADE. Saturday Evening. It is a well established fact that igntJrance is the active medium in the cultivation of " bogies." The appeal to something outside immediate surroundings permits excursions iuto the mysterious, and thus bit by bit the monster i9 created. The village yokel, in like manner, creates a scare by the manufacture of a hollbwed tdrnip shaped like a human face, draped with the ordinary smock, and lighted with the farthing rush, until some bold spirit exposes the ghost fraud. It is Bomewhat difficult to deter mine whioh order tho would be considered farmers' friend journal can claim to represent, though it is evident that the persistence with which the Argentina wheat bogie is thrust for- ward must be due either to ignorance or design. Tito contention of tlhc Age baa been that, although Argentina has oomo somewhat suddenly to the front in tho supply of the world's wheat requirements, the prominenoe gained is largely duo to the gold premium and to unusually good -harvests. Further, that whilst Argentina lias become a larger producer, other countries are so restricting their sowings this year that it is quite possible that supply and demand will be brought into oloser relation, and that this will induce an improvement in prices. Further, our experiences tell us that in Argentina seasons are not dependable, and that no -harvest is assured until it is in the hay. Our new authority would suggest that all this is changed, but unfortu nately we have the immediate testimony of Mr. "William Bateraan, who has had ten years' trial of the republic, and who sums up his remarks with the statement that it is "the uncertainty of. the climate which is the great' drawback." It is conditions of this character which will suggest to unprejudiced reviewers of the market that to dogmatise on the imme diate futuro of prices is not only foolish, but suggests an ignorance of actual existing con ditions of supply. There is, however, unfortu nately at the present time a feoling that all this bogie business is got up to bear the market. To somo extent this receives color from the contradictory statements which the journal referred to publishes in its commercial and cable columns. For instance the former says to day, that there is "a reaction in the Loudon wlioat market." Tho latter says: — "Wheat and Flour: Victoria is firm at 25s. , New Zea land is steady at 25s., Australian superfine (lour is firm at 18s.5 If the market is firm and steady whero is tho reaction? And it is just this differ ence which gives the clue to tho Argentiua bogie creation. As Cardinal Newman's well-known apostrophe to Light is drawn on by the wheat critic, it in just possible that there is a desire to be " load " in tho right direction. An indication of the strong demand for what aro termed "gilt edged" securities at the present moment in London, as well as the largo supply of uninvested money, is afforded by the subscriptions for the Ceylon loan. This iasuo of a Crown colony may be regarded as endorsed by tho British Government, and henoe is specially favorable for the investment of trust funds under the rules of the English courts. The amount open for tender was £500,000, bearing interest at the rate of 3 per cent. The total subscriptions recoivod amounted to - £3,750,000, whilst tho price obtained may lie estimated from the fact that tenders over £100 16a. receive 7 per cent, of the sums applied for. With regard to the position of tho London money market on the 19th ult., the Times writes thus : — No change is apparent in rates of interest and discount in Lombard-street. Holders of good hilts can, with a little activo inquiry, obtain pniutically ilicir own terms, and 4 per cent, is tho tine working rate. The bank return is featureless, there being only slight changes since last week, but the com parison of tlic main items with what they were a year ago is always interesting. A slight fall iu tho New York Exchange supports the belief that no large gold shipments will take place to London before January next; and a further trifling rise in the Paris cueque weakens tho Continental demand for gold. There was sotuo inquiry for French account to-day, hut the price offered was too low to lead to busiuoHS. We subjoin our usual table of quota tions ;— Bunk of Keg- Loaus.

This was figured at loss than 169,000,000 dol., while Sir. l'reston says now that he seas 174,000,000 dol. in sight, with prospect of still greater increase. Ho estimates 42,000,000 dol. to 45,000,000 do!, for tho United States, against about 36,000,000 dol, last yenqj 40,000,000 dol. for Soutli Africa, against about 29,300,000 dol. in 1893 ; and 38,000,000 dol. for Australia, against 35,680,000 do!, last year. The two sections showing lliu greatest increase aro South Africa, exceeding 10,000,000 dol., and the United States about 7,000,000 do!. The total will be nbout 175,000,000 dol. for the world, against about 169,000,000" doi. in Mr. Preston's provious estimate for tile year, und 155,000,000 dol. last year. The increase in gold production for the world in 1894, there fore, is stated at about 20,000,000 dol. Mr. l'reston expresses the bolicf that tho stimulus to gold production since the fail in tho prico of silver will continue to result in suohnneulnrgcd production that tho alarm over a gold scarcity will be effectually quieted. . I''iirliicr, it must not be overlooked that tho increased production,., of West Australia is likely in tho immediate future to largely influence tiio supply. Upon one or two occasions our cablo messages have referred to contemplated combinations be tween the American and Russian oil interests. New York advices by the mail report that fol lowing on tho rupture of negotiations between tho Standard Oil Company and tho Russian pro ducers, tho sales agents who handle all of the Russian oil in tho other European countries outsido of Russia liavo in ado arrangements with the export companies in America .to supply them with the higher grades of oil wherewith to carry war into the Standard Oil Company's own territory in Europe, which the Russians have liitborto left umnoiested. The two ex porting concerns represented iu the arrange ment aro the Columbian ' Oil Company, whioh handles the export oil for the United States l'ipa Lino Company, and the firm of Goepel and Trube. The relations with tho Mannhcimer Oil Company, whioh handles much of the oil of tho independent American companies, have been strengthened, and it is now believed that the chances of the Standard over acquir ing a monopoly of the ' business in Germany are gone. If tho oontliot con tinues .it may result in the completion of another American pipe line to tidewater. The pipes of the United States Pipe Lino Company now roach to Wilkesbarro, whence tlio oil is brought to tidewater by cars over the Jersey Central railroad. With rogard to the London tallow market, our advices dated 19th ult. report as follows : — The market has continued quiet, and transac tions aro only of moderate extent, owing to the am))le available' supplies.
