Little Bay Hospital. Little Bay has a hospital, and this hospital is, according to Mr. Melville, in a most terrible and disorganised condition. From the hon. mem ber's statement, it appears that the Government stores have been purloined, that horses have been broken in for private persons at the Government expense, that a ghost appears nightly at tne ceasiaes 01 tne patients, ana last but not least, that there is a white leper attached to the establishment. Mr. Melville continued to expatiate upon all these terrors ; but it was not quite clear whether the white leper broie inmthe horses, whether the driver of the ambulance posed as the ghost of the storekeeper or purloined the stores, or whether Mr. Melville's witnesses, seven in number, had got to the spirit cask and dreamt the whole affair; bat at any rate the facts will be more fully explained this even ing, when Mr. Melville will move the adjourn ment of the House, with a view to obtaining a select committee to inquire into the matter.
