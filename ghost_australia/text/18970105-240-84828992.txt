TIlE BISIIOP'S GlIOSI'.. A.DUBLIN STORY, A very strange story comes from Dublin. On the afternoon of the day of the sudden death of the Bishop of Kit Iloe and Mnrs WVynne, a lady walking in one of the suburbs of Dublin met a clergymnn whom shie supPosed to hbe the Bishop and inquired for Mrs Wynne. "She," was the reply, " is dead, and," after a pause, "tho Bishop, too, is deod." Tie lady owas quite.overcome, and on recovering herself found that the clergy man, whom she had supposed to be the Bishop, had vanished. Sheimmoediately went and explained the occurrence to a well-known Irish Protestoant dignitary, who is a firm beliorver in supernatural appearances. He said there was no doubt that she had been accorded an in. torviow with the spirit of tlhe departed Bishop. Thle story was extensisely cir colated in Dublin society, and was told to a clergyman when visiting the family of a well-known judge. "Why," said the astonished clerie, " I am the Bishop's ghost. A lady whom I had not known came up to me on the road at that time and asked me how Mrs Wynne was. I said she was dead, and that tbe Bishop was also dead. The lady naturally seemed greatly distressed, and I passed on." There is a very striking likeness betweenthe dead Bishop and the clergy. man for whom he was mistaken.
