" Tïie Sptíinx."»: ? OscATt, WnUDE, the aesthete and artis- tic pbsturer, is a very dim memory ; but Oscar Wilde, the cynical writer, the defiant dramatist, the remarkable poet, is becoming one of the mo9t prominent figures in current liter- ature. To the degree of this promi- nence his most recently published poem, "The Sphinx," will add greatly says the Daily Telegraph. This extra- ordinary production Mr. Wilde has kept by him'in manuscript for many years, not, he declares, with a view to polishing! and repolishing it, but because he feared that its publication would be " a fatal blow to English domesticity." "The Sphinx" is a' magnificent poem, carven with infi- nite care from Egyptian .granite, and richly inlaid with Eastern gems. There are passages in it that Mr. Podsnap would no more think of leaving within reach of the Young Person than he would think of sup- plying that perilously sensitive moral exotic with a course of early Swin- burne unbowdlerised. But even if everybody read "The Sphinx," mar- riage asan institution would survive, and the British matron remain mis tress of the situation. There are few better lines in " The Sphinx," or in any modern poem, than these, in which the poet upbraids the sinful muse which inspired and direc- ted his work : ""What songless tongueless ghost of sin crept through the curtains of the night, And saw my taper burning bright, and knocked, and bade you enter in ? Are there not others mora accursed, whiter with leprosies than I ? Are Abana and Pharpar dry that you conic here to slake your thirst? Go hence, you loathsome mystery! hideous animal, get hence! T Ton wake in me each bestial sense, you make me what I would not be. **False sphinx I false sphinx! by reedy Styx old Charon, leaning on his oar, : "Waits for my coin : go thou before, and leave me to my crucifix, > Whose pallid burden, sick with pain, watches the world with wearied eyes, , And weeps for every soul that dies, and weeps for every soul in vain."
