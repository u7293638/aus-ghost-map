THE BEBEIS. BY M. MT-ONNELL BODKIN (AUTHOR OP 'A STOLEN LIFE.' ETC., ETC.) CHAPTER XIV.— MAN'S INHUMANITY TO MAN. rpiien flung the youth his naked hand against the shear ing sword; Tben sprung the motiier on the brand with wiici her son was gored; ?Then sank the gramideire on the floor, his gnajudbaibes clutching wild; -nien fled the maiden moaning faint, and nestled with the child. « 'It's no use preaching peace,' growled Chris ty Culkin; 'flesh and blood cannot stand it. It's enough to make the dead rise from their graves, let alone the living-. Besides,' lie weut on— for Maurice Blake, gazing sadly out on the fair, moonlit scene, answered nothing to liis grumblings— 'besides, the yeos are sazing the arms, pikes, and the like, which is all the poor boys has to depend on, and then quietly tilling them off at their aize, ail as one as gliLH-p in a slaughter-house.' -But a rising w.ould mean wholesale slaugh ter.' Maurice answered at last. 'The people, scaneivd and distracted, without arms or leaders, could make no head against the sol dieie. -They cannot stand the devilment that's in , it forever.' 'One way or the other — it is a terrible I I'lioiee.' I 'Best die fighting anyhow, if die we must,' I Christy answered grimly, and Maurice, finding I 110 answer, lapsed again into troubled silence. I They bad come a long night and day's jour-j I ney fi-oin Dublin into Wexford, and their souls ' were .sickened by the things they had seen by the way. It was as if a host of devils had irone over the country 'before them. Not tweu iy miles from Dublin they passed through the Wsckeuird ruins of little hamlets, still smoking from recent lire: the doorways cumbered with the half-charred corpses of men. women, and i-'uildren. shot or stabbed to death in their fran tii- efforts to escape_the flames. Everywhere was silence and desolation, for ilie frightened people had fled for shelter to the woods and mountains. Footsore and heartsore. they had rested now at the foot of a wooded slope that looked wide I over a fair, moonlit landscape in hilly Wex ! fci'd. Just a little while before they had come I upon the mute and ghastly witnesses of a fieue that had fired Christy's calm blood and I stirred him to this unwonted speech. | On a peaceful country laneway, where the I shadows of the hedgerow-;- black in the rnoon I light, lay like intricate laeework on the ground, I and the night air was faint with the scent of The wild flowers, they stumbled suddenly on the corpse of a young woman, with her baby in her arms, both newly slain; so newly that I the blood, still dripping from the open wound in the child's throat, made a broadening black stain on the bosom of the dead mother. Scarcely twenty yards further on three yeo men were stretched etark dead, staring at the moon, with a ghastly pike thrust through side or breast; and beyond them, where the ground was torn by a fierce straggle, the body of a young peasant lay riddled with bullets and bayonets. His dead face was savagely bearer by musket butts out of all human resemblance, but his right hand still grasped a pike, whose broad blade, dim and sticky with new-shed Mood, told ite own story of vengeance on the murderers of his wife and child. It was indeed hard to realise, when all na :ure slept in the holy stillness of a midsum mer's night that this calm and lovely scene was in truth a hell of man's making. A light wind' from the south made leaves and shadows quiver in the moonlight, blowing coolly on the fevered faces and hot, dry eyes of those lonely watchers. All round, the land lay naked in the white light, peaceful and beautiful as a j dream of heaven. But far out, the wide curve of the horizon's rim was broken with blotches of dusky redt And .each blotch they knew was the devil's bonfire — a burning homestead. I 'Brighter and brighter those blotches grew with. I ti-f mounting flames and vague sounds of hor I tot: savage shouts and shrieks of pain came I faintly to their ears on the breath of the soft I south wind. I Then of a sudden, nearer, though still dis tant, a strange sound broke out in which all i else was lost. At first there was the tramp ling of feet and the clank of weapons and the murmur of voices. Then, clear and distinct, i a whistling sound— swish, swish, swish— like ilie beating of wild fowls' wings to the fowler's w.irchful ears by the water side on a still, frosty night. Blake, whose hearing was keen as a hunted hare's, heard, or thought he heard, a faint moaning that filled the interstices of this strange sound. Even while they. listened, straining their eyes in vain in the direction of the sound, the moon light faded slowly from the sky, the grey dawn stole like a ghost upon the world. The chill sky warmed from grey to white, from white to rose, from rose to flame color. Then sudden ly the red sun's edge showed over the hilltops, aud the waking birds in the branches twittered their welcome. Another dangerous day' was upon them. 'Come,' Blake said, and without a word more they started on their journey, plunging deeper into the close shelter of the woods, but still heading towards the quarter whence the ('.range sounds had come during the night. Ruth men were armed to the teeth, and Blake carried, slung over his shoulder, a powerful tk'kl-glass, that had served him well in many a limiting and scouting expedition in the New vrorld. They were bound for the town of Wexford. there to meet the leaders of the move ment and convey to them Lord Edward's dying cc tinsel of patience. They waiked over a mile with eyes and ears alert, yet saw or heard nothing. Through all mat wide region, from which the people had tied in terror of their lives, leaving only the U- ad behind, was silence and desolation. Crossing an abrupt ridge, narrow and steep as a house roof, that completely closed the view of the further side, they came with start ling suddenness on a fairy -like dell hid ha the heart of the hills. A little stream . leaping down the hillside, wi'h the red glow of the rising sun on its wa tcr. fnimil 5tsf-lf in tVio vnilp-c a c\naa -jjaiI nf green moss and mantling shrubs, and ran with a cool, pleasant tinkling through the woods. A Held of standing com, the green ears just :ouched with gold, the long stalk rustling in slutting, shadowy waves as the wind went over it, ran in a sharp angle close up to the wood's edge. Beyond the corn a stretch of Sieen pasture lay, and in its centre a huge haw thorn, stretching broad boughs, stood alone. But the campaigners' quick eyes found traces of man's marring hand upon this peaceful -^leue. Close to the wood's edge there were the marks of a camping-place, recently desert , ?d. The corn was torn up and trampled down 'with feet and hoofs, and scattered broadcast over the ground. At the further edge of the }Titm great volumes of smoke rose sluggishly ajrniust the pure opal of the morning sky, and tliiough the broken masses of the smoke they eau-rht a glimpse of the sharp gables of a ruin «' homestead. . A broad trampled track right through the sinniiiag corn led them to the solitary haw-' ili'::i. All round the tree the lush grass -was uampled and torn, and here and there the blown earth showed. From a broad branch that stretched out scarcely a yard above their heads, the bark was stripped away in white patches. Stooping down, Christy touched the trampled grass with his hand and brought it up clammy with new spilled blood. Thetf the full meaning of the strange sounds they had heard during the night came suddenly to both at once. 'The devils! the born devils!' Christy growl ed. 'They have been flogging some poor wretch all through the night; flogging him to death most like.' Maurice searched the empty field with keen eyos. 'What have they done with the man?' he said. 'Or the corpse?' Christy muttered. From long sojourn in the woods the Ked In? dian'» trail-finding instinct was keen in both. Beyond tue trampled circle round the tree's . t trunk there -yeas a slight break In the grass, and a faint line stretched back towards ; the ; wood as if some animal had crawled through. They followed cautiously! Here and there a smear of blood on the bent blades of grass .told them' fligy were : on the right track. TBrougii the cornfield the trail was easy to find, but at the wood's edge it taxed their skill and pa tience. Through the thick underwood they pushed slowly till they came to where the ground cleared and tree-trunks stood apart, though the green shade was close overhead and the tinkling stream widened. -lo a glassy pool, with velvet moss upon the margin. There the mutilated body of the tortured wretch lay motionless, seemingly dead. Right at the pool's brim the body was stretched, naked to the waist, all red and raw with wel tering bruises— a miserable sight. The face was hanging over the pool, and slowlydrip ping blood had curdled in thin red lines — like the veins in marble — in the clear water below. A quick shiver ran through the body at the sound of approaching footsteps. He is still alive,' Blake whispered, while slowly and painfully a pale, blood- smeared face was turned towards them. ]- 'Friends! friends!' Blake called out eagerly id answer to the abject terror of those staring eyes. The passion of pity in his voice calmed the poor wretch's fear in a .moment. 'A little water,' Tie feebly moaned piteous ly, for the pool's edge was steep, and the tan talising coolness lay just beyond the reach of his parched lips. Again and again he drank, with an eagerness that told how fierce must have been the long ing that drew him to the pool's brink, how hor rible the agony of that tantalising thirst But when they would have raised him from the ground, he moaned out a pitiful prayer to let him lie. 'I am dying,' he whispered, 'I want to die. They burned my house down last night, and killed my wife and child in cold blood as they ran from the flames. I begged them to kill me too, but I had stabbed their sergeant with a pitch fork when he struck my wife down, and they were wild- for revenge. My death wasn't enough for them: they were maddened to see the big strong brute lying flat on his back with the prongs of the fork through his breast.' Even then a grim pleasure at the thought made itself felt in the faltering voice of the dying man. .; ^ 'They dragged me across the fields and tied me to the hawthorn there yonder in the pasture land, grumbling all the time that they had no pitch cap with them for the d — -& Popish croppy. , 'But a man they called Tom the Devil, a man with a great hooked nose and a mouth -like the cut of a knife, cried out he'd fix me up for them. 'The moonlight was bright as day, and 1 could see his face as he spoke plainer than I see yours now. Faith, it was no lie to call Mm 'the devil.' There's ne'er a devil in Hell that would take more delight in his wicked work. He rubbed my head between his hands with damp gunpowder, that stuck like putty, and when it dried a bit set fire to it.' The wretch writhed again at the bare re membrance of the agony he had endured. Looking more closely they saw that his head was covered with grey ashes, through which the scalp showed, wrinkled, and cracked with dry white blisters. 'Then,' the faint voice went on, 'when I came back out of the faint, they flogged me; taking turns at it through the night, 10 make me tell who had arms hid. But I knew of ne'er a wan, and with God's blessing I'd have held my tongue if I did 'itself. Just at day break they cut me down, and I fell and lay in a heap on the ground. One soldier with a drop of pity in him would have put his bayonet through me as I lay, but the captain held him back. ' 'Let the dog be,' he said; 'let him take his own time dying. It would be a pity to hurry ; him.' 'With that they left me. I was burning with the drought. Ail the pain I had was no thing to that 'The cool music of the water calling from the woods seemed to put a mad kind of life in me. One of my legs was broken. As God is my judge, I never knew it till I tried to stand and fell again. I suppose a bullet did that at the burning. But with God's help I crawled all the way. dragging the leg after me till I came to the pool's brink. There I saw the water down forninst me, and I could not reach it. Cold and fresh it was, but I could not reach it; I couldn't reach it.' His voice broke into a kind of scream, then died away to a low moaning sound. 'Water!' he whispered presently, and again they held a full cup to his lips, and with a deep sigh of pleasure he drained it to the bottom. After that he lay for a few moments quite still, breathing quickly. 'There was something I wanted to say to you before I died,' he 'began again. 'What was it? Good Lord! what was it? Yes, I re member now. They are making straight for Father Murphy's— him that was always a true friend of the people, and is with them heart and soul in the good cause, though it's preach ing patience he does be of late. The yeomen are death on him altogether. They took great delight in telling before me, one to the other, the blaLck deeds they were on for, and boasted how they meant to catch the ? rebelly Pa pish in his hole and burn the masshouse over his head, and him inside of it If you could give him word of their coming, it would be the beat day's work ever you did. It would be my poor soul's past board to heaven to have a hand in it.' 'But you yourself?' Maurice began. 'We can't leave you here.' . 'Xeverinind me.' the dying man cried, with* straDge energy, 'what's the like of me in com parison with the saving of God's priest? If you ? ' The collapse came suddenly. A shiver ran through the mutilated body, and the words were lost in a hoarse rattle in his throat. 'But we don't know Father Murphy,' Blake persisted, bending close over that he might hear. 'We don't know the way to him.' He spoke to deaf ears. Death had come, a merciful relief to agony. {To be continued.) 'WEEKS JUESC '2E12$^.
