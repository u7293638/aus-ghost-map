JOSEPH JEFFERSON AUTOBIOGRAPHY. From the first publication of Colley Cibber Apology in 1719 down to the present time the autobiographies of actors and actresses have been among the most entertaining books of their class and they are rendered still more so in our own days by the fact that the stars of the theatrical profession uses the whole of tho civilised v world in pursuit of fame and fortune so that their spheres of incident and adventure are men easily widened in consequence This has been the case with Mr Joseph Jefferson in whom the people of Melbourne must feel an especial interest for it was in this city and in our own columns it was first announced that an actor of exceptional Remus had presented himself to the world. It was here that he played the whole of his extensive repertoire and proved himself to be as admirable in Asalrenchurd, Caleb Plummer Salem Scudder, Solon Shingle Jesse Rural, Tobias Shortcut, Dig gory Phil Stapleton and twenty other characters as he was in that with which he is so intimately identified Rip Van Winkle and it was the artistic success he achieved in Melbourne, when audiences were much more difficult to please than they are now, that encouraged him to submit himself to the a verdict of a London audience which ratified in the most emphatic manner the justice of the estimate formed of him in Australia We have already spoken of the literary quality of Mr Jefferson's Autobiography, and shall now proceed to make some extracts from it - OHILDISII HFCOITICTIOVS I may almost say that I was bom in a theatre At all events my earliest notice tions are entirely connected with one It was a rickety old frnino building with a broad gable facing on a wide as emit, and situated in the city of Washington the door from our back entry opened upon the stage, and as a toddling little chop in a short frock I was allowed full run of the place So ' behind the scenes was in) first play house I had seen many rehearsals, and sometimes enjoyed a peep at the play, having been taken on ''marms simple party child in groups of happy peasantry Naturally, therefore I was stage struck at an early age The first dim receive twin 1 have of a public appearance comes before me as a still tied child in a white tunic beautifully striped with gold bands, and in the grasp and on the shoulders of an in fruit 1 tragedian crossing is shaky bridge amid the deafening report of guns and pistols and in a blaze of fire and smoke To me the situation seemed nervous and in order to render my position more secure 1 seized Bella by the hair of his head Let go he cried but I was obeying the first law of nature not Bella so I tightened my gasp upon his tragic top knot The battle was short but decisive for in the next moment I had pulled off his feather duster head dress wig and nil, thereby unintentionally scalping the enemy and as he was past the prime of life the noble Peruvian stoo I bald headed in the middle of the bridge before an admiring audience Mr MO Ain There were two private boats (in the the title of the then small town of Chicago) with little white and gold balustrades mil turkey red curtains Uv er one boy a portrait of Beethoven and over the other a portrait of Handel-upon unfriendly) terms ghinni, at each other the dome was pale blue with pink an 1 White clouds on which reposed four ungraceful bullet-girls representing the sea sons and apparently dropping showers snow, mill grapes into the pit of cr each season there floated four fat little cherubim in various stages of spinal curvature My father being a scenic artist himself was naturally disposed to be critical and which the p unter asked his opinion of the dome he replied 1 Well since you ask me don't you think that your angels are a little still in their attic duties No sir not for angels "When I deal with an) theological subjects 1 never put in) figures in natural attitudes it would be an harmonious A natural angel would he out of keeping with the rest of the work to which my father replied that it was quite in el) that such would be the case But you) have you made Handel and Beethoven frown at each other ' They are not my whole Kicul subjects No no said the painter, but they are musicians you know and great musicians always quarrel eli' He his' life lOUMl SIHIIvOFIMU LAWlER In the midst of our usine, fortunes a heavy blow fell upon us A religious rei wal was in process at the time and the fathers of the church not only launched forth against us in their sermons but by some political manoeuvre got the city to pass a new law injurious hens) license against our air and) calling I forget the amount but it was large enough to be prohibitory fierceness tel able condition of affairs all our mail able funds invested, the Legislature in session the town full of people, and we by a heavy license di meet the privilege of opening the new theatre!
