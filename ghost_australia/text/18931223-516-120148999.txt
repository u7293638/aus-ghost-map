In an instant, quicker than' thought, I had started from my feigned clumbers '; 1 was at the door, 1 had butted and locked it. There were several bolts to this old-fashioned door, there were, even chains. I drew every bolt, I made every rusty chain secure. I was not an instant too soon. { had bcaict-ly fastened the last chain, with fingers (hat trembled, before the thief re turned. He saw that he had been outwitted, nnd his sRvaye anger knew no bounds.

I jiow occupied a most cheerful, modern, - and unghostlike room, and but lor ou^i cir cumstunce my visit would have' tieeii thor oughly utireiiiarkable. . This was the circumstance which seems in a wonderful way to point a moral to my cur ious tale. I paid my visit to the GlitTords during the Assizes. ' Squire ??Qlifforiji' as one of the most influential country 'mandates, was necessarily inrcli occupied with liis mag isterial duties during this liiue. Every morn-' ing be went early into Lewis, the town wiitire' tbe Assizes Xverekhelil. ' Oiie liiorniag he told us of a case which interested lum. ' II He is a hardened villian,' he said, ' he has again and again bten brought befoie nn-, but has never yet been convicted. He is un questionably a thief j indeed, one of the no torious characters in the place ; but' he is such ftslippery dbg, rid jury has yet' found hiin.guilty. VVell, he is to bo tried again to dayli and I do linpe we shall tiave some luck witji him this tiine.11 ' i.ne. oquirH weiu away, hilu it cauie imo his wife's head and mine to pay a visit to the court, and see fur .ourselves the prisoner in vcjipm he was interested. ' ? ?-' Wo sooner said than done. We drove in to. Lewis, and presently found, ourselves in the large and irjwded building. When we entered, the case under discussion had not commenced, but a moment aftfer a fresh pris oner' was ushered into the dock. What was the. matter with me! I found my sight grpwing dim. I found myself bend ing forward, and peering hard. The memory of bv. old terror came back, the sensation of a couple of hours of mortal agony' returned to inn again. Who was in tbe piismer's dock II ki;ew the man. He was my guest of the Tapestry chamber of ten years ago. There he stood, surly, indifferent, with bis vast liroari th and height', his raven- black hair, and that peculiar white lock flung back from his linw. He did not glance at any one, but kept his eyes on the ground. 1 could not contain myself ; I forgot every thing uut my sense of discovery. I started to my feet, and spoke. ' Mr. Clifford, I know that tnnn ;he was in my 100111 ten years ago, Do you remem ber the night when I got the terrible fright in the Taprstry chamber in your house 1 There is the man who frightened me. I could never forget his face. There he stands.' Whatever effects my wordB had on the ' squire and the judge, there is no doubt at all of their remarkable significance to the prisoner. His indifference left -him ; he. staredwide-open and terrified eyes at me. It was plain that if I recognised him, he also recognised me. All his bravado left him ; he muttered something, his face was blanched, then suddenly he fell on his knees nnd covered it with bis hands. 'My evider.o* was remarkable and con clusive; and (hat dny, for the first linn', Hercules Armstrong was committed toprisou. He hndjong l-e.mi thf terror of the neigh liourbood, and no one regretted thu just pun ishment whichiind fallen upon him. What liis subsequent ciirter may be I knov not ; this is the present end of a strange and per fectly true Btory.— Cassetts Family Mugatine.
