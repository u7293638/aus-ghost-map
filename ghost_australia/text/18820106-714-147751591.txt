GOOD MORROW, BLYTHE NEW TEAR. Good morrow, blythe Now Year! Com'st thou in peace to greet us, Or full of storm and fear ? Our dim eyes cannot pierce Tliro' the thick mists that meet us 5 Is thy face fair or fierce r "We loot back through the past ; Dead hopes—grim ghosts—glare at us 5 Old cares dark shadows cast. Yet joy and mirth are there— Beauty midst shreds and tatters— Thou may'st be free from care. Is it ourselves, of thou, Marring this life or making ? . Can we rule fortune now ? Can we in heart be calm, "While grief our life is shaking 5 Smitten by Fate's strong arm ? New Year, can'st thoii not give Sweet balm to hearts nigh breaking 5 Teaching us how to live ? Thy brethren, "dead and gone, Schooled us in health and sickness ; Yet comfort have we none. Can'st thou not teach us how— Tho' we lack sight and quickness— Blythesome to he as thou ? O, take thy test and preach ; For our soul's wisdom cater; ■Trust and contentment teach. Thou, glad New Year, we know True art to thy Creator ; O, mahe us triie also ! O, whether joy or pain Thou art for us up-storing, Let us their meaning gain. O, G-od, within this year, Answer our seed's imploring j O, bring thyself more near.
