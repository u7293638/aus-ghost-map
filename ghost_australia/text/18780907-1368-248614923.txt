It will be sufficient to. say that she belonged to A superior rank in life to mine, that her people thought they were doing me great honour in giving her to me, and expected me to do a great deal in return. I didn't care what I did; it was my pride to anticipate her every wish'; and when it became a question of where we should live after we were marrifM, .! told her she should have the best house in London, and at once proceeded to lpok after it. I consulted the leading hou6e-agents, and was taken by them oyer many " desirable mansions" and " palatial residences," but bnly one specially otruck my fancy—No. 80 Severn-Bqvare, in the. very heart' of the fashionable quarter of London, out, in appearance, in interest, in what I may. call " feeling," as for re i Oved from the giddy vanities as if it had been a turreted castle with a ^raw-bridge, moat, and ciungeon-keep in the hoart of Qloacestersbire. ; . What mas itti history, I aBked- the agent when he first mentioned it to me. It had belonged, be said, fpr. many years to the family of Lord Starboard, the great naral commander ; end had been occupied during her lifetime by the Honourable Miss Bracewell, a strauge old maiden lady, the last surviving member of the race. She died several : years ago, and since then the house has been furnished at various times on short tenancies. Now the lease and furniture were to be sold. ' Something ..in the. manner of Mr. Glenluce, the agent,-as he gave me "this information, impressed me oddly, and I wanted more,particulars. Mr. Glenluce shrugged his shoulders. He would be frank with me, he said. There was a ridiculous,rumour that the house was haunted ;.the tenants could not stop there they said they saw somebody or heard something, but did not know what—-probably all nonsense. Truth of the matter was, the honourable MisB Bracev/ell did not die a natural deatii;' was found murdered-^stranglea in tier bed, i^, point, of fact; and doubtless hence the preposterous rumours. The notion of iacce$s to a haunted,house, which would have excited the curiosity of many, the fear.of more, had 710 sort of interest for me. , It was'an Mtnnti>)n"ny ajolerably cheap raTej and I made an apppoint'ment with Mr Glenluce to take me over the premises determining if they suited ti» close tfye bargain. '''Certainly it was a strange weird-looking place as We surveyed, it from' the - outside.- .The windows grimy and bespattered with the black deposit of a hundred London rain- storms, the ' door paintleas, "tne larfia railingp rusty and broken. High up ov^r the worn uneven steps were two scrolls of ironwork joined: together in the centre, where ,tlfa bettered \- glass-lamp, apparently 'made .ioi, oil iand' not for :gas, atill huhg ; and on either side were thi paiated extinguishers in -which the links of '4>ygoae 'generations had been' 'qudnched,',-, A,-nt,41d^. woman/ bowed with Sg^' and «tiff**wilh rheumatism, which showed itself in her knarl^d joints, opened the door, TCBponsive to Mr. .Qlepluce's ring^ xer^ o^df^opan, with •tjright beady eyes in a dull white face, on which bristly gray hairs grew in abnormal places. She looked somewhat surprised at being summoned,'but,, "recognising the agent, bobbfed a curtBey' and gave us admittance. She was very degf and almost useless, Mr Glenluce lold me, ,but Was .the only person Tie cbttld procure, no natter what wages were offered,' to sleep in the house. She had been bpgn- therein Miss Brace well's'time, as la^'s maid, 1 he added, with a confidential wink, and was;'" supposed to know a lot." Preceded by the strange attendant we. Entered the hall,' which was ' lofty, and spaciojis, and went through the principal fopms. Yhe SPSfttnenta aad furniture ipret^y .weir fulfilled my preiftiipclved nbSpLs of them: they were all wholly out of dat^, and the one trould hare to be robuilt, end the other replaced before I could think of entering the .house,, I do .r^mensber, though, that I noticed a narrow tortuous private staircase from the top of the house at thp back'to the basement," with private or concealed doors to •it from the different floors;' I have told yon that I am not easily impressed by ghostly notions; buttbe damp mouldy smell, /and .the sepulchral silence reigning throughout the house, h, d had their effect Upon me ; and I was about to whisper to Mr- Qli'nJijop to come away as quickly as possible, when, the old woman, who had not.spoken hitherto, but evidently divined my .errand, nudged the . agent's elbow. •• " Take him downstairs/' she said; '-Mr. Glenluce, who was not aware of tjjy intention of cxtenmve rehabilit^tioii, seemed, jjD fought, somewhat annoyed at the suggestion; but secing that ! heard the- remark, he made no objection,. and, accompanied by our weird guide, we ! descended the stone stall's to the basement, . The houses of the period, when Severn-square ' was al-' most a suburb of London^ hdj gardens generally ia (he rear, and beneath those gardens a tunnel of suliwpy often led to dutached kitehenB and stables; ~ to iauiidi-ies' with rooms under tliem; to within or beyond the kitchens; while under the njcft-s at the back were large Cellars or lofts. Wo. |Q gf (his description. Mter wo had gone ihn<?ugh tfcp pp fpaff kitchens, pantries, larders, and domestic offices, the old woman led us through $he #p$ep£round tunnel tQ a detached room, which might have been /used lis a' servant's hall. At the end of this room was a door, which, on opening, I found led into a large vaulted cellar,, apparently half-filled with rubbish and lumber. I motioned the old woman to approach with her light, but by signs she perempiorily refused to advance a step; so, faking the lamp froih her hand, I entered .the cellar and looked round it., . There were some old trunks' and hampers, a broken washstand,, jo rickety set of drawers—the mere domestic refuse that one would have expected, to find stowed away in such a place; but injpojking round tarefully, and in pflBsing the lamp over the walls, I discoveied another door, J' "heayily clamped with iron and securely faBtened, which did not 'eeem to have besn opened for generations.- '^ fiitile attempt to screen it from casual observa* tion had evidently been made by fitting over the door a rough set of boarded shelves, on which were some emp y earthenware pots and bpttles. Handles there were none; and when I placed my fingers in the key-hole and attempted to shake the door, I merely created a'strange hollow rambling echo,. which, I will admit, gave tne a ~ certain feeling of fright. I withdrew ray fingers quickly, and returned to the servants' hall, where found the old woman watching my move, ments with a strangely troubled expres tion of countenance. I was only loo glad to escape from the place, and wo left at once. ' There is no need to describe in de tail why the plans as regards the house were never carried out,' -recommenced Horton, after a short pause. ' From certain circumstances my—my marriage was broken offj and though I had com pleted the purchase of the lease, end though the house was mine, I forbore giving orders for any of the alterations. Af length, an opportunity for ; other invest ments offering, I determined to sell my properly in Severn-square. No sooner had I mentioned the subject to Nr. Glenluce than he told mc he could find me an in Btoni purchaser and a large, profit, seemed that scarcely had; I concluded my bargain before the agent received a letter, from a legal firm, acting for a client whom they would not name, bat who was anxious to acquire the house in Severn square. They were told that Jt had just been Bold; but, acting on tbeir client'i instructions, from time to time they pertinaciously reiterated their, request; ahd no sooner was my desire to sell made known to them than they bid some thousand or twelve hundred, pounds mor than I had paid for the immediate assignment of the lease and furniture I mentioned the circumstance to my friend Wolfrey here; to whom I had pre 'viously described my visit to the haunted house, and all I had heard abobt it from Mr. Glenluce, when be implored me, b> fore parting with my right, to give him an opportunity of patsing onenight elohe in the house in Severn-iquSe. I did my teBt to dissuade him from attempting such an enterprise, but in vain; the more I argued the more determined he grew, until I finally gave hitn the permission required.
