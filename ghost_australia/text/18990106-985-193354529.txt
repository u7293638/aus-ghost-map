Promoted by a Cat. It is not very often that a cat is the means of getting a man pronioted-in the service, but this happened a few years ago in a northern force. There was a ghost scare in a village. Strange noises had been heard for two or three nights and days in an old disused barn. One night the villagers determined to hunt the ghost down. They nearly all turned out. Some had pitchforks, others, spades, hammers, knives, or anything they could use as a weapon. But when they reached the barn and heard the rattling inside, none of them dare enter until the village constable came on the scene. He burst the doors open, and ran the ghost into a corner of the barn, when be found that it was not a ghost, but a cat. It had got its head fast in an old salmon-tin, and, in trying to extricate itself, had dragged the can over the stone floor, making the strange noises that had frightened all the village. The villagers got up a petition in favour of the constable, for having displayed so much courage in facing an unseen danger. It was sent to the proper quarter, with the result that he was promoted to " merit class." Out of the hundred roads over the Pyrenees between France and Spain, only three are passable for carriages. In some recent boring operations in America the workmen came on a solid layer of wood, 15 feet thick, 50 feet below the surface. Cloth is now being successfully made from wood. The latest journalistic venture in Japan is a paper devoted to sporting matters. The first number has ar ticles on rowing, swimming, and foot ball. Fifty thousand Bank of England notes are on the average made daily.
