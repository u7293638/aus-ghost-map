LONDON TOWN TALK. (FROM OUR OWN CORRESPONDENT.) LONDON, Feb. 8. There was once a gourmand who used to be moved to tears by the spectacle of a goose, or turkey, badly carved He thought it such wicked waste of good material The same sort of regret afflicts me when I see an excellent subject for a striking book spoilt in the " treatment." No one boy as a ghost story better than I do, or say as more honestly to believe in it, and consequently no one looked forward with greater expectation to the publication of the Haunted Homes of Great Britain, that has just been given to the world Unhappily, the goose has been spoilt by the can er, and the workman failure It would seem almost impossible to turn out 70 ghost stories founded on fact, and not one of them worth reading, but the feat has in this case been accomplished 'The editor seems tohuvethought tlmttliest)le of his book would best suit the matter by being as much like dry bones' as possible. The stones are so short that they read like paragraphs, and are told in the boldest manner, and one can honestly any in their favour that not one of them would frighten a child of eight On the other hand, as a ghost guide book, the volume is valuable, and nervous persons will know what houses in every county to avoid. By Some " arrangement, I suppose, with a Berlin house, the publishers have contain d that the White Lady of Baireuth should appear coincidently to a Berlin sentinel, her advance (winding) sheets were doubtless sent out before the day of publication She is supposed to herald the demise of the head of the Hohenzollerns, and as he is 87, her reputation is not likely to suffer most li, indeed, as the -Emperor believe as in her, it is only too probable that the prophetess will bring her own fulfilment This lady is nearly 600 years old, and if she has not all her faculties about her (as is always said of very elderly people), she certainly still walks without assistance It would be a curious speculation, but not perhaps altogether a barren one, to consider how far the theory of ancestral apparitions has assisted the hereditary and aristocratic system. It is true that there have been a few vulgar ghosts, but, as is fitting, they have had no great reputation, and have much suffered from exposure" 'He Cook lane ghost, once so famous, is now only used for the purpose of looking at the philosophers who believed in it, while the apparition of Mrs Veal has been exploded in a still more lamentable fashion It is well known that Defoe composed it for a publisher who wanted to get rid of his edition of Dielincourt on Death He makes the denizen of the other world solemnly advise those she has left behind her to "try Drclincourt ' No other devotional work, she assures them, is to be compared to it for saving souls and the in serious device was completely successful Defoe was wise, for the object he had in view, to make his ghost a middle class one but she was only an invention Genuine ghosts are almost always aristocratic, and, as I was about to say, what belief there is in them helps to strengthen the feudal feeling 1 here must, argue the belief ors, be something of virtue in a long line of ancestors since that, and that only, moves spiritual beings to come from the world beyond the grave to visit a poor mortals It is shocking to remark that the author of Alice the Wonderland has in his latest volume- Ithymeaml Heaton striven to popularme apparitions He asserts that villa residences are h united quite as much as feudal castles not, however, so numerously he speaks of a modest tenement, of 150 a year or so, as a one ghost house and with all his humour, he has perhaps never made use of a more happy expression Writers of fiction and poets have long complained of the unequal competition to which they are exposed with members of royal families It is getting quite exceptional for a reigning house to have no authors among them and their Royal Highnesses are now taking to the dramatic line Prince Nicholas, of Monten go, has brought out a play on the Ci Itmje boards, entitled "'The impresses the Balkans, and described as "a national a id patriotic drama J ins seems to me a really good stroke of business for even if he does not make much profit by the performance, he will tims disseminate good political principles, attachment to the reigning dynasty and adverts e himself not only as the author of the place in question but as the most admiral li of (half) sovereigns li the necessity should cverarise(w))ich Heaven forbid to resuscitate the lining loyalty) of this country, it will still remain for one of the Piincessesot the Blood to bring out a melodrama at the Surrey I theatre in which all the good people shall lie Royalists, and all the villains icy ublicans While ghosts frequent only " the best circles w mines and terrible examples often take place in the lower Cobbler- and tailors who commit perjury), while the) Invoke dumbness upon them selves if they are not speaking truth, have their wish (like the Artful Dodger who wanted to see his prosecutor) immediately gratified and washerwomen are struck dead for taking their davies' that no town else are missing from their list of articles from the months A soldier at Gosport Hospital was reported last week by the newspapers, not the doctor to have been struck with blindness immediately on having invoked that catastrophe upon himself.

Both mines have disappeared from the news papers for many years, but we are going to explore the Gulf of Salamis After Xerxes and his sunken fleet. What a flood of classical lore will be poured out upon us, if anything comes out of these dredging operations How leader and Ajax:, of whom we flattered ourselves we had heard the last at Dr Su labour b, will once more put in their claims upon our attention I look forward with no prehension to a series of archaeological articles in the lending journal, beginning with "Every) one who is acquainted with the nature of a trireme, or "It was on the 30th October, exactly 2163 years ago, As. this will be worse than Lord Randolph Churchill Though our date is no longer BC, certain barbarous tastes and instincts still survive among us which would much better befit that epoch than our own We have, it is true, no gladiatorial show s, but a large concourse of apparently respectable people can it seems be attracted by the spectacle of seeing a husband shoot a potato on his wife a forehead with a rifle bullet Not content with her survival from this perilous feat, they absolutely permitted the man to repeat it while lying on his back, when-as they could not but have expected he shot her Upon this the audience dispersed, with the comfortable conviction no doubt, that they had really got their money is worth This happened at Leicester, A d 1881 The "confidence trick has been flourish- ing lately in London with peculiar vigour Three gentlemen make acquaintance on the top of an omnibus One of them has GOC in his pocket to give to the poor, and seeks the advice of the two others as to its distribution All he asks for beyond a judicious benevolence, is a proof of confidence which of course results in a fool been, cleaned out by a thief and his confederate The marvel is how any man could be so great a fool From the constancy of the occurrence, as well as from its peculiar nature, I have a strong conviction that among the class called ' yokels there must be a bond Ade habit of showing "confidence as a test of friendship I have never heard of an example of it, but I am sure the system must exist Can any of your correspondents throw any light upon the subject ' If it does not exist, how is it that such a monstrous proposition as that of leaving your purse in the hands of an utter stranger should be acceded to with such ailment) and even enthusiasm Like the rest of the population, according to Carlyle, yokels may be " mostly fools, but I cannot believe they are such fools as in this matter the appear to be I believe, if the practice were investigated, some explanation of what is otherwise a phenomenon would be dis- covered It is astonishing how long a story, however strange, may be believed, if no one in particular is interested in its contradiction Mr Barnum's white elephant has not only been exposed in all its blackness, but has been the means of exploding all other white elephant It now appears on the best scientific no those), that there never was anything of the kind in existence We have used it as metaphor for hundreds of years, it is incorporated into our language as an expression for a gift that is the cause of ruinous expense to the receiver, and yet the thing itself seems to have been the mere offspring of the ima "mutton of some early traveller One would have imagined that elephants of some kind even if they were only white) brown ones were revered in Siam, but even this appears to be a popular error Mr Darnum s agents have the hardihood to state in public that "no less an authority than the Siamese ambassador has pronounced the creature to be "a genuine Bticrcd while elephant to which the ambassador replies not only that he never saw the beast in question, and doesn t want to see it, but that the existence of sacred elephants is altogether unknown in Siam After this what in one to believe that is told of far away countries Mr Burnuin-though unwittingly has given as great a shock to the believers in travel " its Mr 1 rouble has done in the case of history The will of the lady who lately left £400,000 to the Pope is it seems about to be disputed It certainly seems hard that so much money should go out of the country where it is so much wanted into the pockets of a foreign potentate But so far as the religious question goes I suppose time is nothing to prevent such a bequest.
