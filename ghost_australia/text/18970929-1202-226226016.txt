FRIENDSHIP, Old tiuie again, with weary step and slow Has brought ine back a friend of long ago; The forest flowers seem brighter to my eyes, For smiles I thought, perchance, were in the The days of friendship, sweet in broken days, I cannot bring my pen to sing your praise As poets sing, in sweet melodious rhyme ; But what is praise when once is banished time? I once again chain up the hours ago, And see the sunbeams on the Goulburn glow ; The weaving corn bends down its heavy head As if in sleep, ere hours of day be fled. The silent boats glide by like fairy ghosts On haunted streams of which some story boasts ; And those who row so silent do they keep, That not a word from boat to bank Â«ill creep. And you dear friend of times unbroken bliss. Of that departed all and nothingness ; The shadow of his wing stayed not so long, As to impair in thee life's silvern song. Which to the glad in heart, in life the true. Takes but the tone of days to give anew A richer fulness to the hours we know More perfectly through tears which overflow. And thus king Time leads through the space of years, My friend to-day, lead on throifgh hopes and fears, For in that mystic future of all time, Most friendship link our lives to life devine. J.S.A.
