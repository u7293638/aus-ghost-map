THE QUEENSCLIFF RAILWAY. TO THE EDITOR OF THE ARGUS. Sir, — There is one consideration in con- nexion with the proposed railway from Geelong to "the Cliff" which I have not seen adverted to yet, and that is the fact, that by making the detour to Drysdale you not only give the line a chance of paying, but you enable the 60 artillerymen who are sta- tioned there to reach this by rail. Sir Wm. Jervois, in his Defence report, refers to them as he does to the 100 men at Geelong, and doubtless intended that the railway, when constructed, was to be available for both places. Another consideration is that the direct line, which Mr. Woods talks of making, would cost a great deal more than the Drysdale line, though three miles shorter. Any one who knows what the traffic is at present between this and Geelong, will tell you that by the direct line there is not the ghost of a chance of the thing ever paying — the country it traverses being about the poorest in Victoria — whereas the Drysdale line passes through an exceedingly rich dis- trict. Let the Drysdale people agitate, and send up a deputation to Mr. Woods, even though they should have to submit to the indignity of being introduced by Mr. Ince. The whole colony will support them. We cannot afford to have another non-paying railway. — I am, &c.;, NEPEAN. Queenscliff, Jan 3.
