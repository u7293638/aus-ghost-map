AUNT 'CINDA'S RANCH. Scribner's Monthly. THERE was plenty of game in the neigh-<*> bourhood of Aunt 'Cinda's Banch, as we had been told; but our informant had neglected to state that it was also one of the dreariest pl*ce> on-earth. ? Far aa the eye ciuld reach in every direction lay only prarie, prairie, prairie—treeless and fiat, wtfh abort; trivial grass, and over the race of it all, that, indescribable tawny blur, pecu liar to the outlying- Sanaa* .'plains Tbe little level river In.front of the ranch bid no hanks, and flowed floggi?hly; the ranch ttteJf mi ay f ouMoomed cabinof Jnelan cholly mdobt, flanked by. a atone corral, in whlcti were awkwircl racks and trough* for. :?.;,.???::?;','?;? ?J^^-' : <,--. ?'?? ?'??';'' ; The interest and eidtementofour chases after antelopes, jack-rabbirs, and: 6cc?- sionaQy a> wandering, buffalo, served to kill time for us daring the d?y, bat when even ing csma smd we returned to the .laocb, tired cut and thinking of home, the sense of etrilo became almost painful. The fact that the ranch was a stage station, where a .brief halt was made for supper, alone re deemed it from utter desoiaiion, for Una gave as oar sola gUmpaes of the distant wstidVm th* facet, and conversation of the passengers, with now and then a aba* news paper. We used to stand witching tbe slow sad gorgeous Bassets with a pretty pretense of adaursHoD, when, in reality, oar taonghu were beat opW catching sight of the first curt ol dost that should denota the approach ing stags.- The passengers were not always either attractive or eommnuiettivs, bat all tbo same wa hailed them warmly ; and whan they left, ?'? tha. horiaion' seemed swiftly to widen, and the stars to creep farther upward in tbe bJgb, inhoepttabla sky. ... It was at snoti empty times that wa turned forlornly to oar associates of the raoeh—to tha landlady, Aunt 'Cinda M'Uu!aa, sail tbe swarthy Mex ; e*n and liis .wife, who were in her service. Tha resource was ea oapronisbla ?no at first;. bat gradually wa found Aant 'Cinda to be acaaraoter worth knowing, and yoa may be sure we left no artifice untried to win from her all she had to. tell. She was robust, strong-featured, andifibont forty-fiva yean old; there were streaks el gray in her heavy black hair, a few wrinkles ia her cheeks; bar eves hia an alert and seeking look, such as yoa see ta the eyes of persons who live much along. Sometimes,when she grew animated, and a fleeting. inula came to her aid, we could believe that in her girlish days she had lacked bat little—say merely a change of njouth—to make her pretty. Bat it was her story, and not herself* that mainly held our attention and encouraged' onr in quiries; -indeed, she usually appeared, when recounting .the strange incidents of her history, to be talking: of someone else, so free from vanity was she, and so candid. She had been reared, we learned, in the Booai'aLtck country, in Missouri, and' there had Aaron M'MiQan known and wooed her. .?? The memory of her courtship was very vivid to her, and she dwelt npoa it with lingering fondnees. *? Aaron waa'nt tho partiest man in the world, by long odds/* aha would say ; *? he was light-com plected, and had sandy beard, and freckles; bat he was jestas good as ever, they make "em. I disremember how 'twas that he fust begun keepio* company with mc. Ther* was likelier gals than mc in:tho settlement :< Lucy Walker, for one, that song alto and played onto tha melodeon ; and Samsathy Pettis, that had money in her 'own right, an* aeoh little) Uperio' feet, . an* shanked to show 'am, too. Bat Aaron an* mc, we both flak a shins t* each other, sh'hedidat 'pear 's if hakeared a button for any o* tha balance of 'em. ''Cindy,' ha used to say, < some gals ia party and high steppin'. an* soma is handy abont bakhr* an' waavia* an' seen, an* some is peartinTarnia'; bat it's tha average as counts. 'Cindy.' ril ne var forglt that, not it I live a thousan* years. It's the average as coants ;' I can a'most hear him saym* that now. He used to come to'sea ma every other Sonday, rain or shins, an* when tha* was a moon, had take ma to meatin', over to foor mile away. Tha Camabellitas an* Methodis* ossd to have anion meettn's there, as* ravivsls, an' shO?tia.' Aaron's folks was Campbellites, an* ha bant tbat- way, and nun* was BaptisV - Bat we didn't never argy; shout rehgkm. Bless yon, no." ' ; . Than she would detail to as, bit by hit, the current of their closer talks together, as they rode homeward from church, or sat npontho porch behind tha morning-glaries. It eoald, hardly be called love-making. Aant 'Cicda harsetf tsrnted it and even that sounded too heetis far an in tsreonrsa mat had in it apparently so little of passion—so. email a chance of heart- break, Bat perhaps beneath that calm surface, beyond grasp of expression, had throbbed a wealth of reverent and tender preference that waa worth everything else in life— these simple, undemonstrative natores so frequently shame tha best of love's ex ample* with their nsgoeased and qtdet power. ? Certainly, this humble woman, no longer young, and Kring over again that faroffdream, stOl kept her faith, and made a royal comfort of it. And yet, so far as wa cooM. ascertain, her matter-of-fact, Aaron had bat once, in aU their conrtship, ventured to kiss her. 'Til sever forgit it, not to my dyia* day,** she said. " It waa of a Sonday night* the last Sunday in September, out by the gate, as he waa goia* : away. w"e*d been a-taUda' of things as fnrna aa could be to sparkin', an' all of a sadden, like's if he'd been possessed, he pat'his faco close op to mine, and—l declare to gracious, I couldn't V been worse sn'prised if he?d V hit mc. * Land takes, Aaron T I screamed. An' the next ' annate I snickered right oar- I couldn't help it for seem' how flustered As was, and kind o* undecided. I vow, I b'Here he thought he'd mined mc; but he hadn't. Lordy, lordy, it comes back to mc jest like ? 'twas only, yisterday." / Than she dropped .her head, and her fingers twitched a* her apron, as she added, in a deprecating tone: " Ypa'mu 'BthinkTm soft,lexpset; bat I can't help it. I can't forget rem* things," Tha tears ia bar ayes said as much, and ttOfS. ;?:-<?'?'- . ' J Ihey were married in Hms,lw? cams to know,snd went to housekeeping; but they were poor; they had to rent land;. bad lock followed their planting, and finally, Aaron determined to go wast with tha Santa F6 frsighters, manyof whom, ones as poor as himself, had been known to return from that mysterious rsgloa with mousy enough to hay weftimprovsd farms ia ths Boone's Oak eeoatry* "I*Wtezo?hfmalxmttt l '>raU Aunt 'Cind<; ?> ha waa alien' dreadful sot is hia ways, an* couldn't be aoaxefi* ag'lu* the gram. That was his weak spot; everybmly has one; yon know. It was a'mosttoo much tor mc to see him start oft on secha journey, but I made myrelf think it would tarn out for the beat; and I kaowad he'd coma back/* Too years puratd, however, and he did not retain, nor did she hear aught front him, except that he had rlrdyreaobed Santa Jfe. A third year, almost, dragged away without sight or tidings of him. and then aha resolved to move out into Bansaa, along the route ha had taken— u eo'a to be nigher to him,? aha told us, .*? an* meat him as hoeome home.*' And so aha had "been pushing on from place to place, through hardship, and .danger, by tha great trail across the plains, until now she could see. on a clear day. the outlines of tha mountains that the knew he moat pass over on hia way eastward.,;. She had supported herself, by cooking and wash ing;, for the freightera,. and caring, for the sack who fell in her way, and at length had contrived, after.years:of: "Bcrimpin* an* dickerin*,'' aa ahe described it, to secure this isolated ranch, where she dispensed hotmealsat a dollar" each; incluaing soda biscuits and; the accompaniment of a real table-cloth. And'here sho waited, watch ful and patient, for the truant' fanahaad. "He's sure to oome,** ahe'would aay, "and I can't miss him ; 'twouldn't sn*priee mc to have him drop in any day." Sho scanned the faces of the alighting jasiengera from tha. stage' every- evening with. habitual eagerness, and yet a trifle' tiniidly, as if doubtful about tho kind of receptioa he wonld give her; indeed; ahe said ones: U I dunno but it'll r?a *im to'meet np with, mc so suddent away out here, an* him a-thtnk iu* I'm in Missouri; may be I hadn't orter "a* come.** Every day some special dish' was cooked as he ? had been "wont to prefer it; the best- bed,ln a room by itself,' was kept always vacant for him ; regularly, each afternoon, an* would unloose her abundsnt hair, and gather it into a long, thick braid, after the obsolete fashion of her girlhood, and tie it with a scrap cf Tibboa— because "Aaron liked it better that way.** '. Toe fast ? that aha had received bat one letter from him in all tha long years did n->t seem so nnaecoantable alter aha informal us that, owing to early neglect, he waa "onhandy with a pan," and. generally had hia writing, dona, by prosy. In strict troth, he probably oould not write a word. "But he knows Aggers joat as nafral as kin be," aha hastened to plead for him, ?< an* I never seed the steer or hog 'at he couldn't guess tbe heft of nigh onto a few pound; an' nobody could ever beat *im a-etpharin' out coin in the crib." Sba retased, also, to confess a moment's uneasiness aa to his personal safety'; bath hia absence and his sileoM failed to disconcert her. "He kin take keer of hisself anywheres," aha declared, with evident pride, ??aa* if he's dona got hurt or made way with, I'd hava some warnin' of it, in a dream or aomethia'.Bat I ain't had's much as a sign in tho eoffee groun'a to make ma Bleared. 01 course, hall come back. What, in tha world would ha stay away fori" It waa idle to dispute auah trust, even silently. Not only that, it waa impoasibla to avoid sharing it, aad soon it became as much our habit as it was hers, to look from day to day for the coming of tha absent husband. So minutely did she talk of him that wo believed we shonld recognise him at sight; in fact, we felt ao sura of tins, and expected tion came to ba ao fidgety with as that often, whan the weather waa fair, wa would stroll ont for miles on oar ponies to mast the ataga and get aa earlier glance at tbe occupants, honing thus to spy Aaron, and gallop back to Aunt 'Cinda with tha good news of hia ap proach. Such was par thought, oar talk, as we cantered leisurely along tha trail one quiet evening, and, rounding a carve, came meeting a single queer, covered waggon, drawn by oxen, and crraakiag pitaoosly. "inside the vehicle lay a man, with pallid face and long, attagghng whiskers, who raised hjrnaslfoo his elbow to salute us, and then sank down sgtin with ao expression of pain; near hia side slept a baby; tha wif* and I mother sat in frost, on a tilting seat, guiding ** the critters'* with a well-worn Mexican go?a. It was a novel eight, and provoked at ones both cariosity and sympathy. We forgot abont tha etage. wa forgot about Aaroa; aad when the baby awoke preaeatl7, and pat ha ! ?my fists to its oheeka and Raatd at as fn ahy, debating woaddr— v if trying to identify as with something seen in its jast-vanished dream—we. almost ceased to realise the great, faMtrstehing and empty periphery of desert, a child waa such a godsend there. " Tee," said the woman, aa wa wheeled about, and rode beside the waggon, with onr ponies reined In to salt the slow gslfc of the oxen, "Yes, X think she's a tofo'ble nice baby, myself. We call her Catle. bat her name's Adsline, same's mine. He named I bet''—mdiestfeg the pile and ailiat father, i whose thin fingers clutched the child's frock protectlngly. -. "Hssyour hasbaad been sick long?" \- " Moron a month," the man answered. "Bat I'm plckfa* op now. I ain't nigh ao porely as I was bask in tha valley.

Wy, two weeks ago, he was jest plain akin aad bones. His own mother wouldn't V knowed him.* ? " I seed my shsdder on the grata one day," the man called oat, wish a grim chuckle, " an',lt sktert m?," He did not speak again, except in an undertone to the restless child, during tbe hour or more that we plodded aloag to gether; hut the woaiaa w>a talkative, an-i wegleaaed from, her, by easy degrees, that tbey had been living in New Mexico, and were now on their way back to "God's country,'* east of the plain V"ererla?tialy put but," as she expressed it, " with the greasers,' as' their lazy, triflia', good-for nothin* ways." She had lost one husband there, "shot irj the sneakin' Apaches," and married another, and there Catie had been born; and they milked goates there, and tied pigs to stakes, and bad no society, and no rain; and so oa and bo on. "It's jest too omeryto talk about," she exclaimed, and then went on talking about it faster than ever; aad only our arrival at the ranch cat short her fluent and sneering dis closures.-: '?' ?/. At sight of ns; Aunt *Cm<*a came hurry ing forward.- "For pity's sake!" she said, and waited to be told what it all meant. We repeated.briefly what facts we had gathered concerning the travellers, not omitting the baby, and laying: some stress upon the man's iHness. " A sick man ?" aoawereS Aunt 'Cinda. " Fetch him right in. An'the.baby, too,, an* the Woman—aU > of 'em,** she insisted, and turned to lead tha way, murmuring to herself, in a pleased manner, " Goodness gracious, a baby [" ' The sick man rose withfa sudden effort, i and sat upright. The dusk had thickened and the stars were coming out, and the path to tbe door ot the cabin, along which ha east ayeaxnlnglook, was beginning to !oia itself ia tfaa proximata and dusty segs-hmsn. " I goau I'd tttte? ?rtajfia tht waggon," haeb. I'erved; tha'U be too many, of tu. n And then, gWno:nx ekyward. *' it's a-j{oi?£ t>>. be a party night," ha added, and dropped back upon hia pallet. Aunt 'Clnda hesitated, listonsd, I*e*d about, and slowly returned. The mother , had' just climbed down from her unosrtain seat, and was holding the baby, io her arms [ wnift aha dumsfly adjusted her skirts. ? With i a soliciting geature. bat without spoaking, I Aunt 'Cinda took tha child, and. stepping I aside* turned ita littla surprised face to the stars and gaaad npon it fixedly—wishing it wera hers,' wa "Imagined. "Ton ennnia* little darttn'," ehe said, direeUy.aria banded it bank-in tha aama peealiar,- impulsive manner. Then she moved forward - a few short paces, and stood, with bowed head, very dose to the waggon. The sick man must hava heard her, for immediately, almost, he .waa sitting' up agaio, leaning oat over the waggon-side. > Her face, as she ! lifted it, touched hia ; there was a fluttering ?mstaaf? pause; : ' aha grasped hia hand: I '** If yoa ain't Aaron MoM?lan, you're bis ghost I" ' We hastened to them. She had an arm ; about his nock, now, and his head was upon I her shoulder. In the starlight he looked [to be sleeping. I ?* Don't yoa know mc. Aaron ?** ahe said, |fervently; "Ob, don't you know ma?" The man opened his.eyes with a curious I start, and regarded her a minute' like one amaced: *' They told me—yon was dead—'Cindy." He spoke slowly, in a choked and wavering tone, aad made a motioo aa it to ?' lie' down again. ' "But I osn'tdead, Aaron," urged Aunt 'Cinda,:tightening her hold npon him, and atrokiiighis temples;'..l ain't dead, don't jousee? I'm. right here by you, an* a. 1 holdin' yonr ban*. I 'come away out here tomari yoa, Aaron. Aitftyougladtoseeme? It's been so long. Don't be,mad at mc, Aaron, don't.

"Ton don't know what afix rmio.** Bat she did know—had we not told her, eoold aha not sea ?—that ha ana vary ill,, and weak aad nervous; and be aaemad togaeaa her thought, for in tbe next brsath ha said, "I don't mean the sicknesa;" and then, pointing a finger in tbe direction ol tbe mother and child, hs added: "That's my baby, yonder, "Cindy.** He waited for her fe? reply ; ha looked up into her face, imploringly; but she said not a word.. Sorely she bad heard him ; did she not understand r He waited' a moment longer. Than.he glanced again at her face, again pointed to too mother and child, and suddenly, with woe- begona. bnt hlnnt and erael force, exclaimed: ** 'Cindy, L-I've—got another wife I" ' Sba did not saraam, poor woman, .nor faint, nor stir.. Tha voice of the child broke the stillnees, at length, with a quick, impatient call, lika tbe chirp of a : hungry*' bird.. And than Aunt .'Cinda carefully relaaaad her arm from, about hu neck, and tamed her head away, and bid her f see with her bands, and sobbed ! " Oh, Aaron, Aaron, Aaron !**' The sight waa not one for strange or acci dental eyes,'aad we'retired, my companion and I, to a respectful distance. What mora was said we eoold not know, bat they con versed there together far several minutes, the three ot them—not agrily nor loudly, but very earnestly—and two or three times we detested tha shrill voiea of tha ohfld's mother above tho others, as if in special entreaty. Onr hearts involuntarily went oat to Aaat 'Chtda, and vat there waa the shrinking mother with her ? baby; and there was the sorely beset and helpless Aaron also. The stars glittered sharply, hot coldly ; tha ad vancing night made tho landscape sinister aad spectra]. Wa did not notiea tha sick man get ont of tha waggon, bat presently ho same moving towards us. On eilharsideof him walkel one of the women, supporting him, and Aaat 'Cinda carried the child. It waa a group that Millet woold hava liked to paint—it seemed a blended part of. tha grotesque and fluctuating shadows. Their talk had ceased. Their thoughts we eoold not ?? catch, of coarse. Bat as they draw aigh us, they halted ; aad in an anxious, coaxing tone, Aaron said: though, tbat one or t'other of yon-matt go on with mc to-morrow." The women gave their aasant, we inferred, for he added, aa if in answer, "That's bracin'." Than they resumed their way, fa silence again, and slowly; aad looking after them, we saw them reach the cabin and enter at tbe open doofrr-jaxt as the stage came rattling up. an hoar late, crowded with pissengsrs. Tha aupper waa delayed that nutat, bat He quality made ample amends.. We had never before aaea Aunt 'Cinda's table so invitingly spread, partierilarly aa' to canned froita asdnnanipeetad tumbler* of jtDy aad preserves ; and there waa buttered toast, too, and'lamps of eld-time loaf-eugar for the coffee. Oaa guest said the feast was good enough ; for a weddlag—at which Aaat 'Clada ooloured, and sighed forlornly, aad they all laughed. Ah, they did not gueae how that snggestive word wonnded her! Bnt Aaron was not to be seen, nor the woman with tha baby; they had eaten by theraaetve*, before wa ware called, as waa proper, and were waiting for Anai 'Cinda: in " the extry room,** aa she had named It, tha rooat ao long sacredly kept for Aaron's coming. -And so tha nmrrimsnt aronnd the table went on nocheekod. The guests were bUmelets, to be arire; nevertheless, their jokea and laughter were exasperating; their very presence had the effect of an in trusion. We felt a supreme relic?, I know, when it waa over at last, aad the stage bad departed, and the secret was safe - r and then we ventured to inquire after the sick man, and to tender oar services, should he need or desire them. : : U'? "He's weaker'nheleta on," Aunt 'Cinda informed us; "an' he don't'pear to have no appetite. I felt so sorry for him, a tryin* so hard to eat when he cbnlda't.'" It waa sechaaice supper, he eaid. Zckmld'a* cried to see him a-loakin' ao wiahin* at them pickled tomatusea—like X nsed to make 'em back vender. He is Aaron, yoa know, and ahe turned from ns, rather abruptly,' we thought, and left the room. We lit'our pipes, and sauntered but to fook after our ponies. It had grown much darker. We could not ceo the shallow, crawling river. The waggon still stood by the road-aide, the loosed covering flapping like aonte great fateful wing; the oxen were- graaing contentedly a few rods away. From tha far-off mystery of space' and vagnenes?, came 'an echo "of a coyote's spiteful challenge. The daily ye?ow ; of the atone corral waa ' sub dued to the tone of ancient and crumbling ruins; for S a moment, wis felt as if we ought to find moes and vines there. Our ponies lay reclined upon the trodden. fceding : ground, and did not so much aa prick np an ear when we talked to them and patted them, with' accustomed famili arity. lii vara we tried to chat'of pleaaant things, of other scenes. ' The\a6lifcude would not ba disturbed ; and somehow the amoka from oor.pipea, instead ot floating | upward; waa waited into our faoes/ and oar stoltiv iy-:; J y} When we retained to tho cabin, finally." ' wn 'were tuxprised, though not displeased, Ito learn that Aaron., was to chare our sleeping-room. They had kindled a blaxo for him in the big fire-place, and made him a generous couch of blankets, clean, and white; with astonishing sheets and pillow dips, that were full of deep creases, and must have been a long time folded. That bedlookedmore like.home than.anything, wo had seen: fox months, albeit there waa no bedstead... Ho evidently felt out of place and embarrassed in it; he would hava rested better, we fancied, had they given! him less of softness and daintiness* aad' brought him hia frontiersman's saddle* - with the sheepskin top', for a pillow i a droll hint of the kind "came over hia . face, and gave it a downcast expres sion- ' We aimed- to avoid conversation with him, knowing how fatigued, un strung, and fat need of sleep ha waa; bat ha - talked in spite ot us, and regardless whether wa responded or not.

"One or t'other of 'em will go on.with ma in the mornin'," he said, in an absent and weary way, and then waa silent. - .'-..?-.?? \- We remained sitting by his bedside fully an boor; wa feared he might awake and ? feel hurt at not finding soma one to talk to. Bat he slept on ao quietly and reatfolly that ft seamed nseless to wait any longer, and we retired.' Onr bunk was but across tha room from his, and wa could easily hear if he sailed, we said to ourselves, and w? wonld bo up vary early. It was then tea o'clock. Tha fire had dwindled to a handful of waning coals. We bi?k9dorrrblankete closely about us, and dreamed of home. All at once—it might have been but a minnta afterward, for aB waknaw; in reality it waa almost daylight—wa were aroused by shuffling feet and an mterise whispering. Wa lsaped out of bad, with revolvers drawn aad cooked. A single glance ravaaled tha situa tion- There were the two women bending over Aaron with a bottle and spoons, and a I cop of water* and a camphorised handker chief ; and he-was moaning, and tossing with agony. : He had grown desperately , worse during the night, and his complain ing had not disturbed -.. u5.,.: Bat Aunt 'Cindahad heard him, in tha next': room; perhaps she waa awake and listening.- Sha looked up, white and appealing, before wa conld sneak;, we understood only too'wall what ahe thought., Adeline. chafed tha poor, fellow's chiQ hand vigorously, and. did not heed ns. ~ After a time, with each, scant relief a -- ? we could give him, he became quiet (e x r cent for hia heavy audlabonredbreathia g) : ; and we watched him keenly, hoping he would .sleep- again.

Hia quivering lips , shaped a few words mores :, " Be good," wo heard him weakly mutter,' .?;".' "be good—to the baby." . The room became momently lighter; the last of the vbadows that had lurked all night in the corners vanished one by one ; a. crimson flush slowly overspread the ?' window.
