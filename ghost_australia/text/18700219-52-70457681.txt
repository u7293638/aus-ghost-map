Tho (Ecumenical Council opened on the 8th. amidst gloom, rain, Looming of cannon, and ponling of tho hells of 3G0 churches. 800 ecclesiastics wore present, and thousands of spectators. Tho ordor oi service was mass, tho inaugimil discourse hy thc Archbopish of Iconium, tho Papal benediction, tho homage of members of tho Council to tho Popo, and to tho Holy Ghost; and a Te Deum for subsequent sittings were given with closed doors. Already thoro are reports of dissension and intrigues amongst tho Fathers, and a strong opposition of French, German, and American bishops to tho dogma of infallibility, but subtle measures aro taken by tho Pope and his Jesuit advisers to still o discussion by remitting ob- noxious subjects to sale committees. Tho Bull communicated at the second meeting lias occasioned surprise and indignation. If tho infallibility project is insisted on a great disruption is probable. . The Council is expected to sit for six months. Tho Fronch ambassador has warned tho. Popo of tho probable consequences of his high-handed pro- ceedings. Ono Cardinal is doad.
