MINES AND MINING. Oargo. (JTROU OUR OORHE8ÏONDENT.) September 30. IN my last I spoke of the demise of the Cargo Con pany, but if they are dead their ghost stills walks th earth, and entered an appearance in the flesh at Toe gong the other day before the court of petty sessions with a view of obtaining a magistrate's order for th delivery of a portion of their machinery from Mr Bayliss, of the Post-oflice Store, Cargo, who, althongl he has not the sign of the triplicate sphere outsidi his establishment, still, to a certain extent, has beei acting the paternal towards the bullook-drivers, wh< deposited it with him when they found the company could or perhaps would not pay the carriage. Ii appears that some members of the company, with theil usual astuteness, thought by paying Air. Bayliss foi the storeage he would surrender possession, and ix digging parlance, let the buJlookies rip. But Mr. Bayliss did not exactly see this, having an eye both tc the present as well as the futuro. He at fie first was glad to, and did receive some L20 from the company, and in the second, knowing there was no possibility of making more from them, and that there might bo some chance of profit from bullookey who lives on the spot, advised them (that is the company) to apply to the magistrates. This was dono, but it was not in the worshipful J. P.'a power to grant them relief. Why does not the unfortunate company die out respectably ? Surely, what little there may be left in the cash line, from the Bale of their machines, could be better employed than in endless litigation. We have lately had some pretty heavy showers, which have supplied us with water for washing pur poses, and that makes the plaoe look up. Messrs. Wall and Churoh's maohine is nearly completed. Tho Pros pectors, Lucknow Beef, have resumed operations, and I will shortly be followed by the Rise and Shine, ko. r Our school ÍB opened, and at present the number of soholars is over fifty. This is a good beginning.
