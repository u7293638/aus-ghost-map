" THE CURRENT THAT KILLS " Many people have as genuine a terror of electricity as their ancestors had of ghosts and church y yards at midnight This (remarks the hospital) is quite foolish As in the case of ghosts, it is Ignorance which frightens, but knowledge which reassures Dr J B Verity, in his " Electricity up to Date," tells us that though " some fatal results have happened, electricity does not kill wholesale, as does dynamite, gunpowder, or coal gas explosions , nor is the list of fatal accidents to be compared with deaths due to exploding or over- turned oil lamps " It is well to remember that the ability to bear electric currents varies in different individuals Moreover, that electricity will cer trimly kill if contact ho good and pressure sufficient, need not be denied Indeed, it will kill very promptly and certainly , so much so that Dr A oats thinks capital punishment by electrocution is much the most speedy and painless of all the mc thods of killing known to science On this point he reminds us that since electrify travels much quicker than sensory nerve currents the brain is rapidly rendered insensitive and the subject therefore becomes quite unconscious long before the sensory nerves can communicate the impression of paper " " The current that kills " is, however, as perfectly under the control of those who have but a little real knowledge as is the gas burner or even the composite candle COL OUR BLINDNESS A Frenchman, Mons Dubois, has made an interesting suggestion as to the origin of colour- blindness This defect of vision almost invariably consists in inability to recognise red Now a body cooling down from incandescence (remarks Knouklji) extends its spectrum towards the red end, or mother words the white hot or violet coloured body becomes } oUow and finally a dull red as it cools A few stars such as Sirius and white hot, many others like our sun are cooler and therefore y yellow, whilst others are so cooled down as to shine with a dull red light Primitive man, according to Mons Dubois, lived when the arm was in either The Sirius or the previous stage, that is, when the sun, which is the source of all colour, was white hot, and had no road component in its spectrum , he had, therefore, no power of recognising red Colour blindness, therefore, s is a Mons Dubois, is merely atavism or degenera- tion to the primitive type The objection to this ingenious theory is that we have no reason what over for supposing that primitive man was contemporary with a white hot sun, further, all white man sure that we know of have some rod at any rate in their spectrum The intensity of particular components of the spectrum may vary, but the components are still there
