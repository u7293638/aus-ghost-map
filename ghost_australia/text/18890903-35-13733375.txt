ORANGEMEN AND 710MAA GATBOLKS, ? TO THE EDITOR OF THE HERALD. Sir,-In your issue of last r idly in a letter headed II above from Mr Thomas Lutton I have no wish to enter into a n house controversy with Mr Lutton nor am I going to do so, as I am tender of fighting this praying At the time of the late elections, the Cathol a priests and laymen were charged with having entered into a conspiracy to make protection the fiscal law of the colony by voting- as one man for prosecute Mr B. R Wise made a similar charge i',jß>t them in an article in M'Millan''s Maya.mryjt the free-trade meeting at the Protestant Hall, is reported in your paper under the heading ' SecUnan Combination," the charge was again made that the Catholics voted en mats for protest lion, which charge I say is an seamen slander. Mr Lutton publishes a copy of a letter date May 7, 1885, purporting to be from Cardinal Moran's reference to Catholics becoming members of Oddfellows, Druids, and other lodges The letter he publishes may be true 1 belong to no society, and never did and know nothing of the matter Mr Lutton refers to but his letter IS beside the question The societies be refers to are not political organisations like the Orange Lodges The charge against the Catholics was that they voted on masse to carry protection I say it is an infamous slander originated for political purposes, and that it was effectual I challenge anyone to prove the statement Speaking for myself, I can safely say that I always supported the Liberal party not caring what a man's religion was so long as he political opinions and mine were the same And I think I am correct in saving that the great majority of the East Sydney electors-that is the Catholic portion of them voted for Mr Burdekin and Mr Reid at the last election In my opinion the man who creates sectarian strife at any time, and the bigots of all creed', Catholic and Protestant oaks, are the curse of the country. Mr Lutton publishes extracts from the at cular of the Loyal Or urge Institution, signed by the Rev. Mr Madgwick, R W G M to show how harmless the L O L is, and that Orange- men are not forced to vote as they are told by the Grand Lodge or its branches The Orange Lodge is a secret society, and no one but its members know what the orders are, nor are they likely to divulge them But I say that not only at the last election but at many previous ones that the members of the Orange societies (that is, the political Orangemen, voted en masse, and as they were instructed to vote The Orange Society may be quite harmless as a political society but I would like to ask Mr I utton if it is not a fact that the Orange Society expelled Mows Fremlin and Foo e because they voted for the Stuart Government and as they did not expel them for that, what were thieves polled for And if it is not a fact that at the time Messrs Fremlin and Poole were defeated that the Orangemen, by order of the lodges, voted en masse against them, whilst on previous occasions the Orange men voted on masse for Messrs Fremlin and Poole Messrs, Tomalin and Pool, I believe belonged to the Orange Society, and are Rtinch Protestants if the ( cardinal acted in a tyrannical manner as per Mr I Upton's letter in interfering with Catholics becoming members of Oddfellows' I cases, Vc I think that every unbiassed man will agree with me that the action of the Orange Lodges as regards News 1 remhn and Poole for voting as they thought fit was still more tyrannical Acmn I would like to ask Mr Lutton if it is not a fact that the Orange Lodge expelled our present Mayor because he as Mayor of the city attended a charitable ball given in aid of the funds of St A intent s No play What a terrible crime to commit to attend a charitable I ball given in aid of the funds of a Koojan Catholic Hospital, where Protestants and Catholic alike receive kind treatment' I think that is the case of the Mayor the action of the Orange lodges is infinitely more tyrannical than the case he cites To show Air Lutton that the Orange stirs (ion is not the harmless political institution he wishes us to believe is I refer you to " May's Parliamentary History) of England " wherein the Orange comely of Great Britain was charged with conspiring to de throne her present most gracious Majesty the Queen and to place their Grand Master, the Duke of Cumberland (known as the Butcher of Cumberland), on the throne in place of her Majesty Queen Victoria A Select Committee of the House of Commons, of which the celebrated Joseph Hume was chairman, was appointed to investigate the, charges, which were proved to be true, and a penal law was passed ranking v a punishable offence for certain persons to belong to an Orange lodge These gentlemen are always wasting of their loyalty to the Queen, and trying to cram tam doctrines down the throats of those who are opposing them, politically or otherwise If you will kindly publish this, I will promise not to trespass any farmer on your valuable space 48 a Catholic I felt indignant at the charges made against the Catholics of voting on taste for protection It is well known to those who have watched the crooked game of politics for many years that the boot is on the Orange leg I forms, v, would be glad to see all men at elections vote purse on \- i s s i in "lye and let the accursed sectarian J "> die out for ever.
