THE GHOST, TO THB EDITOE OP THE HERALD. SIR,—1 consider it is noar time steps were taken for the arrest of tho cowardly individual that is endangering the lives of so many females s but I cannot see why citizens should be asked to take such an active duty for the arrest of the above, Are not the police for the purpose of protecting the public? I cannot see why one or two of them should not be appointed, to see whether they could not bring him to justice. And if it be considered .that they are entitled to a reward, let it be given.
