GOOD FRIDAY. I. " My God, my God, oh why hast thou In this last hour forsaken me ?" The Saviour cried, and bowing low His sacred head, this thorn-girt brown Gave up the ghost in agony. II Then o'er the earth a darkness spread, The temple's vail was rent The saints arose from out the dead, From Calvary the people fled, And to the city went. III. The astonished soldier, when he saw The wonders where he stood, , (Although a servant of the law), Confess'd with fear and trembling awo " This was the Son of God." IV. " It is finished," all is past, The Royal sufferer's gone, But he shall come with power at last, (And may that hour approach with haste), To call his people home, v. For sure I am, that we shall see The mocked, the scourged, the crucified HE that was hanged upon the tree Descend in pomp and majesty. By saints and angels glorified. in. The judge of man shall come in power To be the Judge of men And guilt shall tremble in that hour. And hearts of men shall fail from fear, And terror shake them then, viz. That brow which were the bloody crown, By cruel men put on, Shall shine with radiance of its own, And in its brightness shall be shewn The splendour of the sun. vm. Then shall each trembling sinners call Unto the lofty hills, Upon his guilty head to fall, Or night to spread her blackest pall, To hide him from these ills. IX. While Heaven is rent with piteous cries For mercy (sought too late), The dead from out their graves shall rise (Wak'd by the trumpet of the skies) To hear their final fate. x. The quick and dead, before the Lord, Shall stand in mute array, And then to each He will accord (Still faithful to his holy word) His judgment on that day. XI. Oh I let us then so guide our feet Through life's dark painful road, 1 That we our Lord with joy may meet, His hour of coming gladly greet, And live thenceforth with GOD. G. C. N.
