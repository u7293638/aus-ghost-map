PRACTICAL JOKING AT BENDIGO. A "GHOST" AT LARGE. MELBOURNE, September 4. During the past ten days a ghost has been promenading the outskirts of Bendigo, much to the terror of women- folk. Efforts to capture the perpetrator of the scare have proved unsuccessful. One evening the contents of a shot gun were discharged at the jokist, but apparently without my damage being done to him. A couple of evenings later a plucky young woman threw a stone at the ghost, who retaliated by brutally striking her in the face with his fist. About 2 o'clock yester- day morning a tram employee saw a figure in white staring at him from behind a fence. The employee was armed with a revolver, but was too frightened to use it.
