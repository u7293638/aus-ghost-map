MONDAY, NO VEMBER 25, 1878. The Government is very anxious to bring the session to a close as speedily as possible, and with thus object in view Las cleared the notice paper at a great late lins "bl nighter of the innocents, as the operation of discharging bills which it is thought advisable to drop is called, always gives rise to reflections on the want of practical wisdom which characterizes our system of government The theory is that Ministers are these vants of the public, and are bound to attend to and carry on its pressing business The practice is to allow them to single ' outcertammcasures which they think will best please their purity, and to neglect everything else Take what has been opened its session as a proof of your statement there is a multitude of questions awaiting legislative treatment of primary importance to the wolf are of the people questions which, if the doc tors had a proper sense of what is due to them, could not be neglected by any Minister 1 01 claim is, the question of a Metropolitan Board of Works, be necessary for the management of many matters in which the people of Melbourne and the suburbs no mutually concerned. These matters are of the utmost import ince including as they do drainage, cheap water supply, and many other things which affect the everyday life of the people and yet year after year is allowed to pass by without the Government of the day being forced to dedicate its atton turn to the establishment of such a body Instead of being compelled to attend to matters like these, Ministers are permitted, if not encouraged, to take up theoretical questions which in flame party passion and destroy liar mony between the different classes of society, but which could never under any circumstances add anything to the happiness, safety, or prosperity of the community But without insisting further on the fact that there are many things essential to the comfort and well being of the people, which Ministers have not thought it their duty to deal with, we may mention one or two of the practical measures actually taken in hand, and then abandoned, because the the ore tical question of reform has monopolised the time of Parliament in the first place, we may mention the bill for the suppression of the rabbit nuisance, which was struck on the paper on Thursday last Some law for the destruction of these animals appears to be one of the pressing necessities of the day Our i readers will remember how the proposal to legislate was brought about Mr LONG MOKL, the Commissioner of Lands, paid a visit to the north-western part of the colony, and was so struck by what he saw of the ravages committed by these pests, that he took action immediately on his return to town He arranged with the Chief Secretary to introduce a bill to provide for their compulsory destruction, and in moving the second leading made out a case for legislation which appeared to be in answerable He said that rabbits are increasing in numbers in the districts adjoining the mallee country with ev. trending rapidity, that when they firmly establish themselves in any locality it is almost impossible to exterminate them, that isolated efforts for their destruction are perfectly futile, and that the experience of other colo- mes goes to show that without united effort, under legal sanction, nothing can be done " The nuisance, said the hon gentleman, " was of so much magnitude " in the northern districts of this colony, " that unless contest measures ? etc " taken ! like to 1 hit, a large portion of the country would be milked The " crops were destroyed and the country " left without a blade of grass Mr LoNOioiti, in the course of his speech, drew quite a touching picture of the evils and distress inflicted on individuals by the existence of this nuisance He spoke of pom selectors past the vigour of manhood, compelled to sit up all night in order to protect their fields, the produce of which is their only support and stand by He told the Assembly, moreover, that there was no middle course between the extirpation of rabbits and the desolation of a large portion of the colony Under the circumstances, we should have supposed that any Government that thought its responsibilities extended beyond the duty of drawing its monthly salary, would have insisted on some legiSlation taking place in connexion with the matter before the ter mination of the session We did not think that the Ministerial proposals were judicious, and said so at the time. The Legislative Council also appears to have considered them capable of amendment But no one, we imagine, ever dreamt of making such a matter a party question For ourselves, we can say most sincerely that, requesting the difficulty of the position and the urgent necessity for action, we should have been prepared to give the Minister boy of assistance in any endeavour to abate a practical nuisance Oinmons, doubt less, will alvvajsdifiei on such a subject, but it is one which involves no political principle, and which should be settled by the earnest co-operation of all parties Legislation on the rabbit question, how ever, which is necessary to save a large portion of the country morn rain, has been deferred simply because the Council did not regard the question exactly flora Mr LONGMORE'S stand point Is it possible to imagine any thing more absurd in connexion with a free people, who are never tired of asserting their ability to manage public affairs sensibly take another bill which has been discharged from the paper as a proof of the folly exhibited in our legislative proceedings, for which the Government is not to be blamed so much as the people. We allude to the protests Management Bill this measure may not have been a miracle of constructive wisdom, but no doubt it would have done something to wards stopping the waste of time that is at present going on When we consider how absolutely essential the preservation of forests is to the continued fertility and healthiness of a country, can we too strongly condemn the folly which year after year allows their proper i emulation and maintenance to be neglected ? And the absurdity of neglecting these and cognate matters becomes all the more striking when we consider the business which has caused them to be put aside Reform, we are told, must supersede all other subjects A great many people appear to adopt this view, but is there any reasonable ground for it 1 Admitting that it is desirable to lessen the faction between the two Chambers, are we, we would ask, to sacrifice tangible benefits of essential necessaries to the assumed need for smoother action in our legislative machinery - In all seriousness we would request the people to ask themselves what it is they are sacrificing so much for What can they fairly demand that they have not got? Supposing they had all the reform bill that all the " liberal " parties in the arm case could devise, do they imagine that they would be any better off? The power of riding rough shod over the rich Mould neither add a cubit to their stature nor a penny to their purse They might bring rum on the country by harassing capitalists, but labour can never hope to benefit by anything that pi c cuts its employment It may be said that they have no wish to harass capt dists, but surely they must see that capital requires some better assurance for its s feet than the fluctuating desires of a people who in a fit of passion put a Ministry like the present into office Once more, we would ask is the compar Lively question ible benefit we are in chase of under the mine of reform likely to compensate us for the losses we are encountering in endeavouring to bring it about In every way we are suffering Commence, property the material prospects of the present generation, and the interests of the next are all being sacrificed in an attempt to bring about changes in the machinery of go\ ei nment These changes, if made, would probably lead to anarchy, and in the interior could not benefit a single soul Is it wise to neglect practical legislation of the sort we have alluded to in an endeavour to effect them 1 the introduction into England of the American caucus, system, 01 father of secret and irresponsible conventions, for the purpose of working long elections in the interest of party oigamsalums, is a proceeding which is naturally viewed with aversion and dismay by the best friends of the representative government which it is calculated to subvert That it should have received the treaty and inconsiderate approving of some prominent politicians in the mother country is not to be regarded as an argument in its favour It is, on the con liar j, another painful evidence of the fact that public men too frequently succumb to the temptation to subordinate their convictions as statesmen to the temporary exigencies of the party with which they are associated, and to sacrifice the interests of the country to personal ambition It is a proof, also, that the perversion and deformation of the political institutions of the United States which have resulted from the caucus and the convention, are very imperfectly understood in Great Britain for it there is one point upon which high minded Americans of all parties are perfectly agreed, and in which the most respectable and unie pendent reviews, magazines, and new papers of that country contains ism declaring that "the machine, as it is called, is the perennial fountain head of some of the greatest evils which afflict the nation And the magnitude of these is scarcely susceptible of exaggeration Some of them were thus enumerated by Jit D vv ID DuDEr. 1 frED man article upon "Corruption in Politics," which appealed in the International Re- saw - W c sec 39 states on ing an aggregate of 332 OCO COOdol and of which eight way neither principal nor interest we see counties, cities and townships overwhelmed with debt and all the while these various Govern ments feder ii state and munich al-take from our people in taxes more than any Government of Christendom takes from its 1 con le We see offices which it is the fare tion of the 1 resident to kill and which it is his plain duty to fill with the truest and best farmed out to senators and representatives in Congress ye see offices claim. 1 and be stov ed not for merit but for party work and is a n itur in consequence we see the public sentences cient and disordered }\eseevenal Legislatures and executive officers receiving gifts We see the most depraved and least read easily be newspaper press in all the world We see a customs tariff which taxes 62 mi ported articles and 172 different grades of these articles some of them to the extent of 100 per cent of their value while the tariff of England to yes only 17 and the tariff of Germans 152 arranged in 7 classes vi e see depreciated paper money forced upon creditors who contracted for corn and surprise prices back and forth like the swell of a weavers shuttle 'Ne see a commerce which once covered the seas now so dum wished that in this present year the tonnage of our sea going, steamers is 283 000 while that of England is 3 Vs. 000 1 fifteen years ago we were advancing with the stride of a giant to he dominion of the seas to day the trident is in other hands The lion Cvri. SUIIJIV, a member of President by i s' Cabinet, told the Senate that there was nothing resembling the depravity and corruption of political life in America in any other civilised country in the world, that the great agency of demoralisation was the caucus system, and that, unless it were destroyed, republican institutions would be the risk of polishing of the dry lot And another distinguished politician li is described how, when a convention has been organised by fraud, it is " suit "sounded an armed mob of horses " and ballot box stuffed, with a hu cling "judiciary to defend, and a very of press to apologise for it, and how a dozen wire pullers, control the nominations for every high office in their state, because they can manipulate " a suit " cient number of men, trained for the " purpose, who sneeze whenever there masters take snuff These conventions, under the name of executive committees, are being transplanted to the mother country, and form the subject of a well timed article by Mr E D S WilSON in the October number of the Nineteenth Cen Tiny Ile îunaiksthat if the joke which Mr. 1 OESTi ii refused to pass under at Bradford should be once accepted by candidates for a seat in the House of Commons, " it will crush out indi " viduality of character in public life, " will extinguish the nee discussion and competitive examination of opinions " before elections, will practically dis " franchiseminouties, will stukeashaip " line between parties, and a handsaw " not by real and natural differences of " principle but by the controversy that " may best be twisted into a ' city,' and, " worst of all, will pass under the control " of the wire pullers, and will develope " all the evils which have degraded " and defeated popular government in " the United States " A member elected under such degrading conditions will be merely a delegate, and will not be even the delegate of the constituency, but of the little knot of wire-pullers calling itself an executive committee of a reform league, to which he owes his nomination lines will be composed of professional politicians, who will make their own venal and dirty objects to accomplish, and from whom the delegate must submit to receive his instructions, under penalty of being placed under the ban of his masters at the next general election None but such plants, abject place-hunters, and most destitute of principle and independence will stoop to the humiliation of entering a professedly Representative Chamber by such despicable means, and the result would be what has actually occurred in the United States the ss ticism from public life of the more worth, the eminent ability, and in the true sense of the would-be natural aristocracy of the country there would be in every constituency a small self appointed college of primary electors, "holding, as JohN. SiUAHi May remark ed, " no permanent office 01 " position in the public eye, ' deliberating in secret, utterly irresponsible and exercising the functions from motives that might be simply capacious to day and thoroughly corrupt To morrow When that philosophical writer discussed this subject twenty years you, he apologised "for saying so much against a political expedient which perhaps " could not, in England, muster a single " adherent The time has come, in fortunately, when this pernicious system finds many advocates, who perceive its utility for unity put posts, while they are blind to the subversion of representative government which it would inevitably entail It has destroyed individual liberty and individual responsibility in the United states, where it has established a new form of despotism, as odious and revolting as it is vulgar and debasing, and Mr Wi I son who is himself a liberal may well declare that " there are no imaginable "gains to be expected from the second " struction of a Liberal majority in the " House of Commons that can be " weighed for an instant in the scales " of prudence, 01 in those of principle, " against the complicated pieces of " organisation under the caucus Jf English politicians wish to be informed what suits the system has home in Victoria, the reply is this -It has substituted voting machines for representatives in the Legislative Assembly, it has supplied the open discussion of questions of 1 up and policy in that Chamber and it has enabled a clique of vociferous and no scrupulous agitators to combine to deny the light of public meeting and of free speech to their political opponents Against such an intolerable tyranny the instincts of our countrymen at home will HE i el j revolt A member of the Ministerial majority in the Assembly writes to express approval of the resolution earned at the Echuca meeting on Friday, that " no " embassy should be sent to the Lin " penal authorities until all other means of settlement have been exhausted ' But he proceeds to ask, " What Ure " the local means by which reform " can be effected and to argue that every means known to the constitution has been tried already, and has failed , so that the embassy, according to the Echuca resolution, is justified, and has become a necessity The letter appeals in another column The reply to it is obvious The letter of the constitution may be obeyed by Ministers sending up to the Council in bill of which they do not themselves approve, which they admit contains provisions too preposterous for that body to seriously entertain, but, leiUj, the constitution is mocked at by such a procedure The Lower House sends iv sham bill to the Upper House, and because that bill is not approved of, a case it is considered as established N > br c moral constitution in the world but would break down if subjected to such a sham, and it is childishness under shell cirumstances to blame the constitution, and to speak of its failure, and the need of reform by means of outside agencies We apprehend that what the Echuca lost in tion means to assert is that a band fair offer at i of01 m should be made before we confess to the world that we are in capable of self government Suchanotloifc has yet to be attempted it is practicable; and in all human probability would, sooner or later, be low aided by success. The Council has sent to the Assembly a perfectly honest bill, claiming no now powers, but popularising the Upper Clnml co by doubling its constituency, curtailing the provinces, and reduce ing the tenure of office its members have hitherto ence jed Prominent Ministerial supporters have declared in the House that there is not one word in this bill to which they can takcotlcnce, while the measure would certainly receive the unanimous wife of the Opposition The only objection urged on the Ministerial side is that the bill does not NO far enough in the matter of avoiding dead locks, but this defect is easily remedied Two clauses could be added to the measure the one to provide that Appio portion Ijills not containing new and unsettled and disputed questions of public policy should always pass and the other to provide that in case of disputes between the two Houses b that notices should be subject to a dissolution It is unnecessary to enter into the argument in fu out of a double dissolution The principle is now widely accepted, in the belief that it would introduce that feeling of mutual dependence and joint consideration on the out of the two Houses which is new mill ippily wanting The Assembly members, not caring about a penal dissolution, would think twice before proved in a collision by any rash action on their part and the Council members at any and even this would have before them the knowledge that they were mine Lately describable for their actions On the basis already indicated a bill could be fi imed which would go far to unite the Lower House, and which would occur e strong support within the Upper Chamber and which, as it would certainly satisfy the country, would have a future before it Such a measure would be a real and honest measure, and not a sham, and until a real and honest bill has been sent by the Assembly to the Council it is idle to speak of local means having been exhausted So far, m truth, local means have not once been fairly tried grass fire select committee appointed by the Legislative Council to inquire as to the issue of free passes by the Railway du partment does not appear to Invobeou sufficiently keen in its pursuit of knowledge That passes were granted during the elections in an improper manner in order to assist in the return of Mines tend candidates was at the time matter of common talk, and a month or two age Mr Tnvstii moved for a return which it was thought might throw light on the subject But delay after delay took place, and there being apparently no prospect of getting information out of the department, a committee was appointed the result is purely negative of The committee reports that, having examined the secretary of Railways, and three subordinate officers of the permanent staff, it has come to the conclusion that " there is a "laxity and want of arrangement about "the free pass system which evidently " requires amendment by an unproved " departmental supervision and more " strictly defined responsibility ' All this was perfectly well known before If there had been any department in super "vision" at all, the heston al of railway privileges for election put poses would have been impossible The passes which helped to win the two West Melbourne elections could not have been issued, for it would have been necessary to give the reason for granting them, and this would have stopped the game If thecoininitteeliaddetonuiiiodto probe the matter to the bottom it should not have been content with taking the evidence of the penny ment officer i It should line examined the Commissioner of R ubi Lys, and the persons who are reputed to have received the passes for distribution The names of these persons have been men I loned without an j pi defence of secresy Had the committee could easily have placed its hands upon them If it is not too 1 site of the session we trust the committee will be open the inquiry, for the purpose of getting mfoiiuiitiuu of a more positive character Things at present are left in very unsatisfactory position Nothing whatever is proved, but the suspicion of wrong doing is as str ing as over The public interest demands that every effort should be made t > ii i iv o at the ii nth So far the committee has been preserved in its object, and supposing the depar intent to be guilty of the corrupt practices alleged against it, the report presented to the Council will only contain it in wrong doing For it has only to perpetuate the lux system complained of, and it will escape exposure We ask, therefore, for further and searching investigation An interesting exact amount is lining made by the miners say it Rhoims That body has founded a school of industry, capable of accommodating 300 pupils, and affording a course of nish motion covering a space of three years, to which boys between 12 and 15 yous of age are admissible from other schools It possesses a stay of six professors, and there is a teacher in each of the work shop in one of these practical mechanics is taught in all its branches, steam power, a forgo, benches, and all kinds of tools and implements being pro voted In another part of the establishment the boys learn the carpenter's, joiner 2, and cabinet, makers arts In a thud department we wing is carried on by means of numerous hand looms, and the textile fabrics produced ne from designs devised upon

staple, how to wash and cleanse it without injuring its fibre of its lustre, how to extract from it the natural grease and reduce it to a solid substance, how to prepare dyeing colours, and how to apply them Attached to the school is a large piece of ground, planted with trees, shrubs, herbs, and flowers and here the science of botany 13 t night The institution has now been in existence for two years, and the advantages it offers seem to be eagerly embraced by the rising generation in Rheims, who had in it much more entertaining and profitable occupation than in lounging about the streets of the city after night fall, and poisoning the in with the fumes of cheap tobacco, for the evening lectures, which are free to all the residents in the place, are numerously attended and yeilds prized Altogether, the under taking is one deserving of the warmest approbation, and its success will probably lead to the example thus set being emu lated by other cities It is the kind of education which is most wanted in this " working day world, and nowhere so much, perhaps, as in the colony of Vic- toria Another blow, as will be seen by our cable message, has been struck by the British in Afghanistan Ali Masjid a fort in the Khyber Pass has been captured, and our forces are advancing According to them telligence from the Indian papers which we published on the Ith inst an attack on

likely to be made to modify the resolutions which are to be brought before the Council on Tuesday, and with certain matters, tions, they would find a large measure of sup- port in the lower House-a sufficient measure to compel the Government to reconsider its course of action The Minister of Railways as was indicated on Saturday would probably be the case, has decided to accept the tender of the associated coal companies for the supply at Newcastle of 50,000 tons of coal required for the use of the A Vctorian Railways during the ensuing year The coal is to be delivered on board the vessels of Messrs Mllnruth and Co at a uniform price of 15s i el ton The name of the contracting companies are the Australian Agricultural Newcastle and Wallsend, Co operative, Duckenfield and 1 regulate coal

required standard In cases of dispute the companies will have power to appeal to two experts and an umpire With the cost of the carriage from Newcastle the price to the department of the coal used during the next 12 months will thus be-24 s per ton delivered at Melbourne or Williamstown, 21s 9d at Geelong, and 27s at Portland In all probability, however, only a nominal quantity will be landed

Mr F Stephen appeared for the former and Mr Nathan for the latter the assault was of a very trifling nature in itself, but appeared to be the result of some very disgraceful conduct on the part of the defendant and three other young men of good position who had been invited to a social entertainment given in the Rechabite hall, on the 20th July, by the Brighton Juvenile Athletic Club, on which occasion they pelted the ladies and gentlemen amateurs who performed with vegetables, and finished their proceedings by spilling some filthy smelling composition on the door.
