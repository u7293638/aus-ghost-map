A S T O R M BY " OUND." I stand alone on the balcony, and view the grand world beneath and above ine. What a grand creation ! What a supreme mystery? Those great black clouds up yonder surely foretell a storm. I watch them intently and see all sorts of signs and symbols written there—all gloomy tliey appear to me—but: I think of the silver lining," and look for it. It is not there ! So, even in life, we see tlie black clouds of trouble, hemmitfg us in, and if we look at that moment for the lining we fail to see it ; but when the clouds have dispersed, as in the course of nature they must do, then-, that sweet little ray of light cklled " silver lining " appears to cheer us. My eyes leave the gloomy sky to gaze down on civilization—-not nearly so-mysterious as that great sky above me, and not nearly so beautiful. Still it hath its charm. Away to the right rises that pretty hill ou whose side and top stand the stately mansions of the -blest (with this ^Yorld's richer). The houses look shadowy and gloomy, and the huge old trees ail around them throw weird shadows on the walls. Here and ; there.i light glitters in a window. Mj imagination pictures a solitary watch er—-maybe 'tis a gentle woman tend iug a sick husband or ohild, or perhaps'tis a girl trying so hard to win that scholarship, and so she reads on far iiito the night, conning over her studies,-and trying to make,her young Ibrkiri 'VretisOin i\\\ a. circle," Ah"! lassie, and where are your pretty roses going to, meantime ? In tlie morning you rise with heavy eyes, pale cheeks, and a cross moufcli, and all for scholarship! Lay your books aside, arid go out into the garden and view the mystic world around you ! You wiH:/l<?SnV;mdre in one ho,ur froifl ,that study of nature t han niglits of bookneading . will , teach you. Learn ! There is another light twinkling over there! I wonder who is the occupant of that room. Fancy tells me 'tis two lassies who/cannot, sleep oiiitilJ all; "the little arid 'big events'of the' daycare given in ftnet confidence to each lit'her. Prattle on, babies, only be sure and turn the._ gas., off,safely ere you bi^eaciiothergo.od-nigiit, arid try once more to court " JSfature^s sweet restorer."
