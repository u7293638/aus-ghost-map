'Possum in a Firo Bell. The local fire bells (says the Wagga Advertiser) have been called upon to do a fair share of dutty lately, but the central instrument in Fitzmaurice-street was put to a decidedly novel use on Thursday afternoon, when it became a temporary fabiding place" for a festive young '.possum, which was observedto be perched on the tongue of the bell, doing a gentle swing.. Had it been night, and had the 'possum succeeded in raising a note or two out of the bell, Wagga might have been in a position to work up a little ghost story of its own-such as are becoming fashionable again, say "the haunted bell," for at the first sound of the dread note that 'possum would have fled for the nearest gum-tree, and then the mystery would have been bow the bell came to speak.
