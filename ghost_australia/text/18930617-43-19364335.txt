" You wont to a cL-iss moutin' 1 Aw, yes, I heerd about it" " Well, I don't wonder that young people don't cjre a>x>»t going. The leader had prepared nothing that would interest or help, flc simply droned out a few worn ont platitudes." . " He spoke as the Spirit gave him utter ance, young man." Andrew was silent. An answer isprang to his lips, but he did not give uttcrancoto it It would seem irreverent. "The only power to save is religion, young msn " asserted Henry. - -1 agree with you," replied Andrew,) " but it must be a real religion—a religionl touching every phase of life, and fathom-! ing the deepest human needs. A religion; lite you were telling me about in that) hymn you quoted is a caric*turc of real re-j ligion.' Henry wnuld have replied, but be heard his daughter coming into the house. " Will you uso yonr influence, and get your Church to take up this matter ?'* an drew asked, seeing him hesitate. " So, young man. Onr chapel and schoolroom was built as the house of Uod. I will never consent for it to bcconio a clnu-room ' Uoth church and chapel had refused hiai, then, for he knew t'uat llcnry VdUud was si mnch a master at the chapel as the rector was lit the church. Certainly the leaders of religion were aguinat him. Andrew enjoyed his tea thoroughly. Cer tainly Henry was a poor exponent of his religion, if that religion was the one ex pressed in Charles 'Wesley's hymn, for hii table was literally laden with good food. A great ham, meat pasties, the remains of a Inge chicken pie, nnd abundance of clotted cream were placed on the table, while cakes 1 and taru were bronght forward in great varieties. <. ertainly, whatever niujht be the condition of the, poor f&rui; lal>onrer, Mr Yelland f .red sumptuously every d»y. Aft^r tr.i toe tntaily wont to chapel, An drew being placed in Henry's pew. He found the place nearly full, and unusual interest «.ia manifested. Andrew found that the church had been trying to "get up a revival," and on t'.iis night they expected a breakdown among the unconverted. Htnry preached a remarkable sermon, and oc thLs oeciwsion made a great effect. I will not try and reproduce it. If 1 did 1 should be accused of irreverence, for many of his sutementi would shock many who have ni'tcr attended a revival meeting in Lomnehire. Ue took for bis text, '-roe wages of sin is death," and spent his whole powers in trying to tell the meaning of death, which in nia conception was » eon acieui eUaaal torture. He quoted the Hethodut cate>:hi»ai, which said that the wicked would be punUhed in hell by hav ing their bodies tormented by fire, a_d their eouls by a sense of the wiath of God. He, moreover, enlarged on the idea tnat these lurments would last for ever and ever. And yet the man who preached Un« could crack a joke with the best at the right time—that is to say, on holiday oc casions, marketdays, gales, and so on, while he ccrald eit rout beef and plum-pudding with a splendid appetite. At U-ugth the aennon came to an end, and the prayer-meeting commenced. Now came the time when the Loaoisnire charac ter shone oat. A great fear, almost amounting to a panic, had laid hold of many cf the people, who commenced to gruon. There was manifest sincerity, too, and a serious look settled on their faces. And this was scarcely wondetfaL Fancy, if you can, a place nearly ten miles from a gas lamp, where the people had been Uoght fur Ung generations to believe in ghosts, apparitions. Satanic visitations, and so forth, and then think of the effect of preaching fearful doctrines. Moreover, it was a dart night, and some had to go long dislanct-a alone. Every bnsh would be an uncarthl.v visitant, every sound the foot step of i've dead. The hymns they sang, too, were calculated to arouse every bit of latent rupcrstition in their natures. ' Andruw lUtuued in wonder. The people did not eing unmusically, but the words were terrible:— " We (ball eeo {be Judge descending, In that great d*y, Whilst the mighty, mighty trumpet Sbill go Bounding through the Vitle. " We eliall see the graves all opening In the old churchyard. Whilst the mighty, mighty trnmpet, etc. " We Bhail bear the devil* howling In thtt great day, "Whilst the mighty, mighty trumpet, etc These words were set to a weird, creepy Mnd of mnsic, and a) at the dose, of each verse nearly the whole congregation bare; forth with the following retrain:— "Turn, poor sinner, and escape eternal tire, , For you'll have t» stuod the lire in that great day '— Andrew began to feel something of the influence of a revival meeting.. And yet there were no penitents. The truth was the people were accustomed to this kind of thing, and while it exerted an influence, many regarded it as a matter of COUTM. . . Ab the meeting went on, the noise be came great. One or two commenced to shout, three or four prayed at one time, until rjuiet thought was almost impossible. I will not describe this meeting further, or I shall, perchance, be accused of dealiDf flippantly with a solemn theme. Forth, same reason I will not rcla'e the conversa tion which followed by some of tie prin cipal members of the Chnrch. At tltexauie time,if Ism t)tell the story of Andrew Fairfax, 1 must necessarily refer to this part of his life. Neither wonld I be accust-d of tack of sympathy with religious revival* —nay, I have every belief in them, pio )ded tbby are gonuino. Moreover, there was some excuse fur the kind of meeting 1 have described. Tho pcoplo are not very t susceptible to finer influences, their very conditiol of Hfo had rendered them bo sluggish and lethargic that only tho3e in- Bucrcos which r.i>pe*lcd to their grosser natures had much effect upon them. Andrew, however, did not find the meet ing helpful. To iho young man whose surroundings had bacn different, and whose intellect had been trained, the teaching and general influence wen>. repugnant. So much was this so that when ho was asked about his own spiritual condition, bo was led to give expression to soina very strong wotds. He told these peoplo that their conception of God and religion was op posed to what was l»st and truest, and that it* power, would grow less ;e»r by year. .'•.•' ■ ■ * '"■■'' X »*«*. Tho young man left tho chapel with a bad name, *nd it was hinto-1 that Any ( one Holding such opinions as his was; sufficient to kill any revival. Andrew went home with a sad heart. He felt as though he could do nothing The clergyman had declined- to, belphiin.; the peoplo at the chapel evidently 'regarded him as a dangerous young man. Mean while the villagers dragged out a weary, painful existence. VThcy had nothing.that gava interest to their live*, r nothing.to re tlnc or ennoble them. As for their future, only » painful old ngo and the workhouw stared them in tho face.;.?. ■ ;■.: jl--J ■ It is truo that both church and chapol existed,; but •-what did they: do? ft to former adhured to ancient forms'and-'coa ventiontl method], but it had lost touch with tha people. The groat vanlt-lHre building w»a opened only ona d»y, a W4«k, and then it was nearly empty. A» for the chapel, thcro were activity and earnestness but the work done was oie-»idod aad in efficient. The; people did not- seem 'to realize that tbe same laws prevailed in the spiritual a3 in the natural realm, and thus life was without its truajoy. Hicy.carod a great deal about saving people from hell and getting them to heaven, but as to try ing to make thia world lesa like hell and more lit c heaven, by bettering the physical and social conditions of the people, they did not regard that as a part of , r their religion. For weets togothcr there wvis nothing to interest or amuse great numbers of the people, and thus somehow they lose grip of that which was purely emotional. No d?ubt both chapel ana church did an amount of good, bat they both lacked that social clement, that regard for this work-a day world, whereby they could have been a great power for good. , "Oh," though Andrew, "if some broad minded young curate and some thorough going uiinist-r could cocao to thctfo placcj of worship, and then unitedly go to wort whut a change' could be wrought hpral Religion could be made a thousand times more to them than it is now—but it cannot be, I suppose.

The servant stared at him, but took hU message to her mistress, and returned a few seconds later, saying that Him Lezant would see him. . . He followed the ferrant in a somewhat critical mood. Ho had never soea Mits Lczant to bis knowledge, and expected to find a grim, hard-fetturod .woman.. Cer tainly tue letter sho had sent him did not promise anything very favorable, and when the door opened, and ho was" ushered into x finely furnished room, he wondered how the owner of such a houto could be bo in different to the welfare of tho poor cottagers on the estate. ; '..,: By tbe eide of the fireplace sit two j ladies, who both turned at Andrew* en trance, and then his heart gave a great bound. The younger of tbo two ladies was tbe one whose horse ho had guided through the fields not long before, and whom he had seen at church that very morning. Their eyea met, and a rosy fliuh mantled •ie young lady's cheeks. _ " Andrew Fairfax r" she said, as if m •loobt. '• Sly name is Andrew Fairfax, replied the young m»n. ■' 1 caw you yesterday f" " And this morning," replied he.

Surely he had enough to occupy his time and thought, and ho wondered what the outcome ct it all was to be. lie fell asleep at len^ta, however, and awoke in the morning with his mind clear. When he left the fArmhouse fur tlio cuttle shed, he found tlint the run was fulling heavily, and that there waj every pronpect of a wet day. So much thu worse for the inmates of tho wretched, leaky cctt&ges.; Still, for some reasons he was not sorry. He could do nothing on tlio farm while it rained so heavily, lie would bu ible to get to the village sgaiu.

He stopped until the'eart came up, for he saw beneath the tarpaulin covering' the athletic form of the young miller, who, wonderful for' a Loamshire rustic, was reading a daily paper. " Kernicki i should liku to speak to you." Martin Kernick immediately folded his paper and turned towards Andrew, as if waiting for him to proceed. " I am given to understand that you are a* politician." ' . 1 Kernick smiled, and proudly assented. •• What are your politics worth ?" "AgooddeaL' 1 un a staunch Liberal.
