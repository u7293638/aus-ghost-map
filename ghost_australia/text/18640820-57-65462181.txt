Funny Old Cock " Tho cock, «vJiich is tho lleraVl of the mont." Tercent Henri/ Shukspere Our venerable daily contemporary is evidently sufTer iiig from sovore punching on tho head, or something of tint sort, for ho is growing awfully funny in his old age, and by u frantic uso of scissors, he is convulsing the wholo of civilised ICuropo with cosmopolitan witticisms whick, otherwise, would havo returned ... To tho mild p:ipor whence they sprung, Unknown, uuhououred, and unhung out to fa mo. lix. yr. In an extract from tho Straits limes, inserted in our V. C's issue of yesterday, touch- ing the discovery of u now shoal, nour one already known ss tho Prince of Wules, it is asserted by the fucetious re- porter that it is culled tho Alexandra, " doubtless from ita being well tinder the lee ol' tho Prhico of Wales." (!) '.I'liero is some excuse for tho originsl imposerai this po* um! (n)iukuiii tax on our patience, becuuse au editor who is always in straits is nut urally sometimos " hard up" for something to say, but there is not tho slightest ¡otu of thu ghost of a particle of extenuation for our V.C. to bring it ont into tho light of " brooded watchful day." If this .ort ofthing ia persisted in, wo shall bo reluctantly com- pelled to resign our "cup and bells," smash our bowl, squeeze our lomon dry, iulur oui- rum in our "Jiving se- pulchre," and present the spoon with tho appropriate in , lerijition, "detur digniori," tj the editor.
