Spiritualistic Frauds, Mr Mlaskelyne, in an interview which appears in the "English llluptrated M?gazine," gives the following account of how he first began to suspect the bona fides of spiritualism :--" The first awaken ing of my interest in the exposure of spiritualistic frauds arose in this way. It was during my apprenticeship. Adja cent to our place of business there resided a man and woman who professed to effect cures by mesmerism. About that time table - turning became a fashionable amusement, and the Fox fanily had .startled America by a second edition of ton c--- An Ghost' Well, these mesnleorsts cuoR. ----- " s spiritual itic seances, and one da/y - _. brought to our shop what sn sur√Ωicl ppliance tobe sepaired.

As you may suppose, I en tirely failedto seewhat kind of surgicelap pliance this thing cou'd be, and wascurious to discover its real use. Having re paired it, I devoted a few minutes to experimenting with it, and found that by buckling the strap of the short lever round the left ankle, and that of the long lever round the leg just below the knee, by pressingthe right heel upon a projec tion at the side of the short lever the long one could be jerked up and made to strike the under-aide of the table.

This was a fsleon bywihich I profited, greatly in my subsequent investigations."
