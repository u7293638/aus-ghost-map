Scarcely choosing his own direction, but letting .Fate lead him as he would, he turned towards the Embassy, walk Inu fast. It had been earlier, though so much darker, that winter night. He had come out from the Embassy from that door there, and he-liad passed, as he was passing now, and then foot steps had come tapping after him - a iv'oman's hand had touched his arm As if his thought had materialised he heard the same sound agaln, quick steps, a voice, and a hard on his arm. "'r Tristram! Oh, thank Heaven, it's Â¢Vou!" SIe turned. A woman in a dark, plain dress was at his side, and, panting avith the haste she had made, was fum bling tremulously to untie a heavy veil that masked her face. With a wrench -she tore it off, and looked him in the iyes. A strange, fateful thrill crept * through his veins.
