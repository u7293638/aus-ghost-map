Tbe time of the Assembly has been alsaost entirely occupied in uinntssing the«3ot«rsv meat scheme for taxation and theJ?ndgat speech of tbe Treasurer, the Hon. J. P. Boucaut ThedebaUonth?ktter,aaoatii?>e of whiA w« gave in our last news summary, was Mtnewbat less protracted than usual, boaorable members hatis« uyqmuiAl) 4a trrwrssrf to resTTe their aloqaeaee lor the battle over the proposed pi?aurtj and in come taxes. It maybeagain briefly exslasnai that the Treasurer Mrtiapated a defeat o* about £-172,160 on the current fi^-^ui year, to aid in meeting which he proposed to impose a tax on property and on all ' incomes over £200 per aanuon. The House, however, decided that additional taxation for the aunple purpose of inqwasing the | revenue was not necessary, thus practically expressing the belief of the majority that there will really be bo deficit. The aew I taxes if finally adopted will be to enable the ! Government to remit a portion of the i Customs duties hwied upon the *ssc*smti?M ] of life. The formal naolatJuMs at first moved by the Treasurer wen to tit* safest, that under the exjatmg system of taxation ; absentees and the wealthier daaaea of the conununitj do not c^vtnbnte a fair share towards the national burthens, and that, therefore, the inridwnne of +*i"*"roughs i to be placed on a more equitable basis. Mr.., Boucaut explained that he proposed to tax the asEeased annaal value ef landed pga perty and the income tram fixed per sonal properly, lika share* and aaavtgageu, at the rate of tid. in the poaad. All otfaar property was also to be taxed, but then setmed to be some doubt as to whatthn ate would be—whether Gd, or 3d. The fiat £200 of income, whether from property or earnings, was to be fixempt. The tax on income from earnings he proposed to make threepence in the pound. The debate on the resolution'was long and tedious, and unfortunately much time waa wasted in the errhanfe of racrimiua tions between Mr. Boucaut and the ex- TreaGurer, Mr. Boaa. The chief atraffgte waa over the refuaal of Mr. Boucaut to assent to the introdoction tt a ckuue into the Bill providing that the new Una fihonld not be levied unttt the Customs tariff has been readjusted, and thk omMsi tion fina% found, exnroeijnn in two*^ns?ad mente to the fininiiiiaiint 1111 ilultsan. moved by Mr. Wardj ihefimt, which we ban re ferred to, aCrming (hat additional tautaoa m iwij. aad the aseuad thatth« CmUmm tariff dmU be ndscod, the fnjV?nm?

The Go frnnaiirt relations fora propaljtox ware eventually pond, with the modifeatio? tint £300 dboold bo the limit of taxable income, and that capital invested in trade or bonoem should only be taxed at three pence in the posod on an eetimsted annas] value of 5 per oast. The firat of these modifiratMM wu proposed by U? Ministry in coufoiiHi with a geoera&y; eapimueid wish of —.■■!■— T of the Hoaa?; ia fact the threepenny tax was, we believe, put of their ongiaal scaesne, though it ww aot nay dearly ap parent Cram the resohrtioai. The pwpuetd tax on boom wu negat?ed by a laajrwity of three.

An inquest was held by the C% Coroner (Mr.Thomaa Ward, J.P.), an Wednesday, Sen tosher 4, a* Walkerr^ on tbe body of Thomas Fielder, who died suddenly two days previously. William Boae. taker, wd—Deceased was in my employ. Last saw him alive oa Monday ana iogatmboot 29 minutes past 6, whan he com plained of feeling bad and tried to vomit. Told him to lease off work and go home. He was steady, honest,and industrious. HarthaFielder said—The deceased was my husband. He used to complain of headaches and sickness. He came borne on Monday evening at about a quarter to 7 o'clock. Be said he felt ill, and laid down on the bed. He called for me and * went to him, when be asked for some mustard and water to make him stok, which I gave him. Be some and it made him vomit. IT<* got op and sat in a ebair, and whilst vomiting fell to the ground. I tried to raise him, but eoold not. Put piUows under his head, and went for his father. He got to the boose before I did, and when I got back deceased was dead. Dr. Bfdntyre, surgeon, said—l was called on Monday evening between 7 and 8 to Bee deceased. Went at once, and found him lying on the bed with his clothes on, quite j dead. Have made a pom-mortem examination of the body. Examined the brain first. On re- j moving the skull found considerable Hmmlih.. turn. It was very dark. On opening the mem- . brane covering the brain found thin clotted blood all over the superior part. The brain i itself was healthy. The blood which I found ; came from one of the Tains. Opened the ohest. The lungs ware healthy, and also the heart, which was empty of blood. Opened the abdomen and found the membranes healthy. The bowels and stomach were also healthy. The right side of the liver was considerably enlarged I and soft. If deceased had lived much longer an aboess would have formed there. All the other organs were healthy The cause of death would be haanorrhagic effusion on the brain. Gould i notsayif mediaal assistance had been called earlier whether deneased could have been saved. The vomiting would stjnndate the act of oircaU tion and accelerate death. James Fielder said the deceased was his eon. Last Monday was called by deceased* wife, who said, "Gome quick, Tom is dying, if not dead." I reached the bouse a minute before deceased's wife, and found deceased on the floor, I believe dead. We tried for a long time to restore him before the doctor came. The Coroner having summed up, a verdict was returned to the effect chat de ceased died from ** hwmorrhagic effusion on the brain." Mr. Tnos.

The singing of MUs Howarde, Misi Minna Fisher, and Miss Maggie Knight evi dently gave much pleasure, encores being narrowly escaped. The faMymMnireyji efforts of the latter lady were loudly applauded, and a redemand was made. To-night the same pieces will be repeated.
