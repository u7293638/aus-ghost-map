PARKES-DIBBS RECONCILIATION. Sir Henry Parkes walked into the Oppo- sition room by the back door. Sir George sprang from the sofa, and as he advanced Sir Henry gave utterance to these preg- nant words: "Good morning Sir George, how are you?" Great CÃ¦sar's ghost! Great Samson's hair! Or any other kind of swear Or wicked exclamation!! Oh, what a day, my countrymen! Oh, what a scene was witnessed then, And all to save the nation! These two white-headed, grand old knights The heroes of so many fights, Are going to put things all to rights By reconciliation. O, Moses' cat! Jehosophat!! Or any other swear word that Will meet the situation!! Who would have thought, a few short weeks Ago, they would be joining cheeks In tearful osculation! And is it that they've kinder grown And wish to humble and atone! Another dog has got the bone! Oh, that's the explanation. \--"Orange Leader."
