SPORTING. To-day the third and last day's racing in connection with the V.R.C. Autumn Meeting -will take place at Flemington, and though a very small field will go for the Champion Stakes, the big race of the day, the other events will be well con tested. The races to-day are the Maiden otaKes, iNursery Handicap, Autumn Handicap, Champion Stakes, All-Aged Stakes, and Free Handicap. 'Augur,' in the Australasian, in speaking of tbe Champion Stakes, says : — The great weight-for-age race of the autumn has been shorn of nearly all its interest by the withdrawal of Trenton. Had this fine son of Musket kept sound there would have been tremendous ex citement when he and his sp .ing conqueror went forth to fight their battle o'er again. In his absence, nothing seems to have a ghost of a chance with Trident. PBOBABLE STABTERS FOE THE CHAMPION STAKES. Horse. Pedigree. Jockey. Trident ... Robinson Crusoe — Hales Cocoanut ? Volcano ...
