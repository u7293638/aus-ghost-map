&ORMAN0H;& (From an occasiondl Go-respondent). Tlie creamery is îikây to be In fall swing before long, and%reat hopes are entertained of its proving a 4^c'ded success. Those wishing music tail ion >a»re to have a good chance shortly, as Mr Mnlholland is makîrig arrangements' for pupils for the piano nnd violin. This will be a bo >n to this district, sMhere is plenty of latent music talent which but wants developing. A most successful concert, followed by the customary bill, was held at Gormandale on Thursday last. The effort was in aid of the piano fund, and the excellent house on the occasion must have been gratifying to, the Mechanics? committee, and I am glad to state that the financialresalts wpre very satisfactory, as nearly £1G was taken, which, after deduct ing expenses, leaves a good balance. Mr Gilsenau, who presiJed at the concert, intimated that Mr ilapon, M.L.A., had expected to preside on the occasion, but owing to tlie date being altered from Friday to Thursday, he regretted bis ii.ability to do so. The followinglengthy programme was then gone through :—Duett, violin and piano, Mr and Miss Alice Graham, was. very well rendered, and as this was the young 1 lady's first public appearance llie applause given was well deservd. ; Mr Hart in his song, "They all love Jack,"" pleased the audience very much ; a recitalirp "Waterloo'' was then nicely given by Master C. Waters; Mr F. Faulkner, in his selection "The bashful man,"' tickled the audience ; Mr J.- Wat ers' song, "Four jolly Smitns," was liearl to great advantage ; " Help at the r'ght time" was well recited by Mr Hamond ; Miss Greenwell, who was the only lady vocalist on the occasion, and whose appearance on the platform wa3 the signal for applause, was deservedly encoivd for tlie s«>ng " Nellie was raking - the hay ; an instrumental piece was spiritedly given by Dr Wafers (banjo), Mr Horne (pia^o), Mr MulhollanJ (violin), and Mr Graham (violin), at the conclusion of which the performers were greeted with Ion I applause ; Mr J- Waters then sang with taste and expres-. sion " Down went the Captain" ; the old favorite " Pa.Mle your own Canoe"' was then rendered by Mr R. Graham, who.was encore 1. The second part of the programme included some performerswho arrived late in the evening. The overture by Dr Waters (banjo), Mr Home (piano), Mr Mnlholland'(violin), was qnite a feature of the evening ; a. comic song by Air F. Faulkner, "Johnnie don't wriggle the baby," pleased theandience mucli, and an encore ; was ihe result ; Mr Hamond's recitation, -'On the line." was given with much dramatic force, and was loudlyapplauded ; the appearance of Mr Clues in his odd make-up set the house in a r->ar, and an encore was demanded at the end of his'f Langhing Song," He was accompanied by Messrs Horne and. ^Mqlliplland. An inftnnBenist duett, by -JïissCampbelL^dJIr^eTiteHs, "Alas those Chimes" (Maritona), and later on.
