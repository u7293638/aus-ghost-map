PROFESSOR l'EPPEll, A chabgc of programme was presented at thd Town Hall by Professor Pepper, who deserved to bo greeted by a larger audience on New Year's Night. Pilcher's portrait limner was tlie first novelty, showing a fairly executed portrait of Lord Beaconsfield, drawn on the screen somowhat after the fashion of tho Biblical handwriting on tho wall. Next, tho weird story of Fisher's Ghost was told by tho Frofeasor, illustrated upon tile moral of "murder will out" with spectral anil super natural apparitions enough fur the most insatiato lover 'of shades of tho departed. Tho illusions of the modern Atctcinpsychosis wero repented, and then came tho agreeable singing of Aliss Emily Beaumont. After this, "Voyages in tho Air" opened up a new field of the marvellous and instructive in the direction of mronauts, and their wonderful apparatus, dating from the early days of Persian mythology, to thcballoonfor scientific or war observations as used at tho present day, and at tho seigo of Paris. The different flying machines, their various modes of progression, and the almost uniform mid unhappy fate of their inventors, who have come to grief in ' rashly testing them; wero graphically shown in quick succession, followed by views of cloud land at different nltitudcs, and in different degrees of rarified atmosphere. Theso were very beautiful and elicited muoh applause. Alount Vesuvius in a stato of eruption, an Esqui maux Snow Village, Iiddystono Lighthouso by day and niglit, and with a terrific storm beating upon its majestic dome; Tintorn Abbey, England; St. Peter's, Rome ; and tbe Alosque of Omar, wero superb and highly artistic views. " Tiie grotesque tom-tom player," aed tho goblin-like "Creeping horrors on the screen,"eoiieluded tlie entertainment. The same programme will be given to-night, and to morrow afternoon a malinie will be held.
