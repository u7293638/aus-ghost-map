BALMAIN REGATTA. The principal feature iii this colony of tho celebration of Prince .of. Wales birthday is the annual regatta at Balmain, whioh this year has proved more successful than any of its iaostardentsupporters expected. The arrange ments for tho conduct of the regatta by tbo large and enthusiastic committee were very complete indeed, and never before has such punctuality been observe'd in starting the races. The Balmain. Steam Ferry Co. might have arranged that steamers could have been run more conveniently early in the day, and one of their steamers passing, the flagship actually rofused to call for a few moments at the stage to hind competitors and tho various Press representatives' who were expected to see the first race. The 3.9. Barcoo, Captain James Banks, A.U.S.N. Col, had been placed at the disposal of the committee as flagship, and Captain Banks'- good services' and help to the comriiittee -were-: recognised by the presentation of -a case of carvers, suitably inscribed, and handed over by Mr. George Clubb, Mayor of : Balmain, and suitably acknowledged by the gallant skipper. The visitors to the flagship were not as numerous as might havo been expeoted, but matters were kept lively by the Balmain Alliance Band stationed on tho poop. The wind blew lightly -from the. north-east up to lunoli time, when -it. freshened- considerably. The light breeze and smooth water favored the rowing races, tho majority of which were got off before lunch, but the sails of the sailing craft flapped idly under the lee of the points they had to round, and the sun shone down fiercely on the crews as they sat and waited for the puffs. Once the breeze setin tberays of the sun woro nicely tempered, and a better day for the regatta could not have been had. There were ho accidents, . but n. couple of canvassers capsizod'near the flagship, more to the delight than otherwise of the occupants, who wore real water-rats. . The -water-police wero inattendance, and rendered good help to boats in distross. In fact everything in connection with' the regatta-reflects extreme credit on the promoters, who had such a little time to arrange the details, i Tho lion, secre taries were alive to' their responsibilities, and most courteous in their attention to both the visitors and Press representatives, for which unanimous-praise is bestowod.

As tho flag fell Jenny Wren wns first ovor tho lino, followed by tho Louolle, Astrrea, and Norna in th6 order named, tho startor evidently mistaking the time, fts there Btill wanted about ton to fifteen seconds when tho flag camo down.
