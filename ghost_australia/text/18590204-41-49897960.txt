If lOther- wise minded, I might have invited the former, by the example of Robert Brbwn, to renounce their principles of separation and to talfe orders in the English Church, and even to take benc* ficea therein; whereas I did not suggest in my first letter to Mr. Binney a complete fusioa of existing separate ecclesiastical associations; in order- to obtain Church Union. ^ Unity j in variety' was all I contemplated ; each' Church retaining (so long as it thought h fit): its own 'internal and esoteric discipline tlnd mode of worBhipi over and -aoore' the 'adoption '?? pf. -the orthodox preed, a settled, Uturgjyj and ? sacramental ? olHees '- (qot, ^hoi»pW*, to the -exclusion of ? fred :p^r4y jr), rti the. expretsion of that faith,; arm j/lasily, ^of that'' common form of; government, .which,, haying descended from the ( apostolic age, must in its simpler farm h -ve had ihiits favour the 'judgment' and santion of ^he Apostles themselves.
