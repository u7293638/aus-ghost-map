MELBOURNE. 15th August. (FROM OUR OWN CORRESPONDENT.)

Sir James M'Culloch and'the Hon. Mr £ phersojn have also consented to act as vice-patrons, and the list of classes will be advertised shortly. - I understand that a requisition is at present being a lar S_ e number of, influential shareholders m Melbourne 01 the Quarts Mining Company Freehold Reef, Hepburn, to have a meeting called of the shareholders here, for'the purpose of con sidering as to the removal or dismissal of the present directors of the company, and of the present legal manager, and likewise to consider as to the removal of the registered office of the company from Ballarat to Daylesford or Melbourne. The- Melbourne shares holders, it seems, are rampant about recent manage ment, and contemplate, if possible, something like a renovation in that particular. . The trial of James Cusack for murdering his wife at Gooley s Creek, in the Wood’s Point district, was this morning postponed until Tuesday on the application of Mr Duigan. The police somehow are reaping- large harvests just now amongst the Melbourne “cracksmen.” This morning three adepts in the art were put upon their trial for burglary at the Criminal Sessions. Water man, Anstice, and Thompson, three notorious members of the order of light-fingered gents, had been, durino the night of the sth and the morning of the 6th inst., under the surveillance of the police, and about three in the morning Anstice was found outside the Golden Fleece hotel, and on seeing the detectives he bolted, while the other two were caught inside, but before they had had time to ransack the place’ the darbies were put on. Waterman and Thompson pleaded guilty, and Anstice was found guilty. Several convictions were proved against all the prisoners, and they were remanded for sentence. ... ■’ This morning the case of the Attorney- General v Hardy came on for hearing before his Honor Mr Jus tice Molesworth, in the Court of Equity. Mr Webb appeared for the plaintiff, the defendant being unre presented. It was a bill for an injunction to restrain the defendant from mining under the streets of Balla rat. His Honor granted the injunction as prayed for. The action brought by Mr E. O’Keefe against the Board of Land and Workß will come on for trial to morrow morning. Robert -Davies was tried and acquitted to-day on a charge of assaulting one Moore, in May last, with a hand-saw, and thereby inflicting grievous bodily harm. It appears that the prisoner and another man went into the Canada hotel and asked for drinks, when the prosecutor went up to him and, without receiving any provocation, struck him repeatedly on the face with the back of his hand, and then pitched him out into the street on to his head. The prisoner picked him self up and, re-entering the hotel, he struck the prose cutor two or three times on the head with a handsaw, inflicting considerable injuries. The jury acquitted the prisoner. An influential deputation waited on the Chief Secretary to-day, in reference to the carrying out of a railway line from Portland to Branxholme, but nothing decisive was arrived at pending the settlement of the line to Hamilton, the next work to be undertaken.
