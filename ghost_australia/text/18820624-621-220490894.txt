POETRY. ' SUNRISE. by the sea. A waning of the golden lamps In heaven's eternal dome, A glimmer on the dasky sands (Ghost like creeps up tbo foam) A blended hue above the waves — The lily and the rose — A fleecy clond of dappled bloom, Like that the pansy shows ; A tinge the morning-glory wears, With pearly dew-drops wet ; A blash as of the columbine, A tint of violet; And ever in the brightening sky, Some changing splendour born, Till leaf by leaf, a perfect flower, UnfoldB the bnd of morn. — Albert Laighton, in 44 Atlantic Monthly" for April.
