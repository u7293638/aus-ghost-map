agreed that if a flower were burnt and pulverised, a start might be obtained which was the essential part of the flower, that on mixing this substance with something which was not disclosed, and applying heat, a spectral flower would arise, corresponding to that which was burnt This was explained by supposing that the particles of the Bait, when heated, attracted one another, and flew off into the respective places they had occupied when in the living plant so that they thus formed a shadowy representation of it That being taken for an established fact, it was easy enough to apply it to the human body, which, who is running underground, threw off such particles of the essential salt to rise into the air, be drawn into their old relative positions, and thus form horrid apparitions

the appearance of spectres in hectic and other fevers The ghosts seen by Nicolai, the philosophical book seller of Berlin, disappeared gradually on the application of leeches Spectral impressions may result also from direct irritation of the brain, or from a high state of nervous irritability acting upon the body generally The spectres will agree mostly with the mind they spring from. A philosophical man like Nicolai has visions of men, dogs, and horses, such as he would see in daily life Others, who have their minds full of supernatural tales, and who associate with darkness, instead of nature's rest, the spirits unrest, will are the Bott of ghosts they occupy their minds with Others, again, whose philosophy leads to a faith in V Bible intercourse between the living and the dead, will not fail to obtain r> excellent corroborations of their due nine When supernatural forms are not repetition of familiar shapes, but follow Current superstitions, it has been always observed that they correspond to the forms adopted by popular belief 1 some familiar paint ings and sculptures.

Visions seen in the ecstasies of saints themselves were commonly true visions, natural, as results of an overstrained mind in a wasted and often tortured body The visions seen by the dying may be explained also by the condition of the body in the last stage of many diseases, when the commonness of spectral delusions has given rise to a strong faith in our frequent visible communion with angelo and departed spirits in the hour of death, Ivtvit to sight, hearing is the sense most frequently imposed on, and no sound is so commonly imagined as the call of a farrier c sermon Dr. Johnson fancied he heard his mother call "Svm, when she was a hundred miles away, end was much disappointed when nothing ensued Ihvt call by k familiar voice was a frequent experience of the present writer it was commonly n home voice, and a loud clear, and abrupt monosyllabic call J but he has heard the voice of a brother miles away, ? speaking as if from behind his shoulder in a college library, and turned to answer in a voice itself so uiBcnoibly subdued to harmony with the impression, as considerably to surprise a fellow-student who was standing near.

As it takes only ten days to prepare a sago tree, a man has the rest of the year entirely at his own disposal, which he appends usually in sheer idleness Even if he has to buy a sago tree, he can obtain one for about 7s C J and as labour in Coram is in a day, the total cost of a v ear's food for one man is about 12s.
