SUNDAY SKETCHES. (BY A STRANGER.) A PANEGYRIC AT ST. PATRICK'S. St. Patrick was a gentleman " It is easier both to understand and agree with the old balladeer than the modern panegyrist We take it for granted that St Patrick must have been a gentleman, or he would never have achieved such a world-wide and general popularity No man lack- ing in the essentials of a gentleman was ever popular after the fashion of St Patrick A i man may have many merits and still be famous, man) virtues may be closely allied to vices, and still command the affection and admiration of a class What do we read of the soldiers' The). love a captain to obey, Dolstcrous as March. yet fresh as May, 1 ver the first to Beale a tower.

Lverthing echoes in a Gothic cathedral except organ music. 'The elaborate series of the music echo by and by, and echo may perhaps be responsible for a little thinness of tone, which seemed to mar the effect of the highest soprano passages, and possibly forthright confusion of sound which usurped the place of majestic harmony where the whole choir should have warbled together as the angels in the great composer's mind. But there was not much need for excuse The choir was strong, the conductor efficient, the organ mellow and grand, and generally the effect such us to make the listener quite content to praise God by deputy But St Patrick' said most in the mass the preacher entered the pulpit and proceeded to read a passage from the history of Joseph, and then to enter on a comparison of the be braved youth who came to rule Egypt and th slave boy of mastic parentage, who blessed and sapctifiedlreland, and won the title of apostle to the western world The preacher was filled full of good intent as of beautiful brogue and native eloquence He desired to praise and glorify St Patrick according to the measure of his worth, to tell the people how all the glory was achieved, and to point out how in a humble way they might all follow in the same track, and hope to share in the same reward The eloquent doctor was well read in the accepted history of the saint He told of his boyish trials and hopes, of his many labours and larger woes of his toils, penances, and prayers, in a ceaseless adorn non and infinite labour and love. in some respects a very accurate!) detailed picture of the saint was painted He genutlected seven hundred, he prayed three hundred, times a day and found time apparently to keep accurate count of all), he repeated the whole of the Psalms of David in every day) and most) of them ever) night, immersed in ice cold water, with his hands aloft to heaven ' (yet keeping careful count) he preached in incessantly, built churches, labouring with his own hands, sent out missionary priests to all neighbouring lands, and gave Ireland those long years of feast and plenty preced- ing the seven centuries of famine, which are not yet spent A most devout and laborious and penitential saint as described by the preacher, worthy of any form of mart) room the most diabolical minded pagan could devise, and yet not exactly the saint Ireland worships, and England, with the rest of the world, dearly loves. We have all been mistaken in our notion of the saint, or otherwise the reverend doctor had not so mastered his complete history as to realise to himself and plant for us a clear and recognisable picture We did not seem to find an old acquaintance in the picture of the panegyric. Somewhere, far away in memory, like a dreamland glimpse of a bygone existence, there is a Patrick who lived in Ireland, and is loved for ever, as an Arthur in England (Nobody cares for the George-who, if all be true that is told of him, ought never to have passed the devil's advocate ) Arthur m England, Patrick in Ireland, both vague and vast and with diflt culty resolved into any recognisable shape Arthur did indeed ' A man a ghost Stream as a cloud, man shaped from mountain peak, And close to cairn and cromlech And Geoffrey and Male or sought with scant success to i harm him into recognisable con- dition 'the master singer of our own time touched till the filmy threads of tradition with the magic of his genius, and Arthur stood out-a gentleman 'The type of all gentle hood. true to every requirement of the motto of noblesse oblige. type for the king and the commoner in England for ever and for ever And St. Patrick was a gentleman The old ballad singer struck that one great truth, the reverend panegyrist missed it We might have reverenced the fasting saint, honoured the church builder, esteemed the missionary), but it must have been the gentleman who won our love. " St. Patrick was a gentleman I that should have been the text for the panegyric Some where amongst the musty folios of the round towers or in the traditions of the people, there must be evidences of this gentle hood, material which wrought with craft and power will give us the ideal of those qualities we associate with all that is best in the Irish race. The matchless bravery as distinguished from the savage thirst of blood, the heroic fortitude which suffers and wants, and stoops to no meonorbase deliverance, the bound les8generoait), the Sparkling wit, the mind table humour, nil imbued with a Christian meekness, surrounded by again like halo That is the St Patrick to cast out the snakes, but that is not the St. Patrick of the pane Ryrie of the cathedral Poor St Patrick the preacher, with his fear ml penances, his stupendous labours, immersed in the ice cold water, with bands aloft to Heaven ' Let us be prompt and glad to admit that he was made the type of many noble virtues, and the text of much use ful preaching to the event congrega- tion An example of penitence, of sane vibration, of punt and tenderness, and love And what large opportunity the preacher discovered for emulating his virtues, and yet, what singular connection did he trace between the blessings which crowned the sufferings of the saint and those which followed the long endurance 01 his particular people They now were in the seven this years, the seven centuries of tribute tion, whose troubles and privations had done so much to depopulate Ireland and replenish and sanctify the world Irishmen said the eloquent doctor, with all clearness and force, never leave Ireland except under compulsion, and what does all the world owe to the various forms of compulsion which have forced Irish men out to their great work in all nations' Magnificent cathedrals in America and Australia I Missionaries to all heather! nations What would the world have been without them and would 1 they have had existence but for the long oppressions of Ireland ' Both questions present difficulties to the candid reasoner First of the former, it may be Sold its many aspects are too vast and complex to be dealt with in any single article, of the latter, it is a difficulty which has not occurred to the preacher alone, and bears evidence to an honesty of intent which scorns all boast of unassisted missionary spirit, or unlet and undaunted colonial enterprise. But Build up here a fitting shrine for the saint of your love and adoration, make a magnificent home on this glorious Bite , plant the cross of St Patrick on the highest pm uncle of the worthiest shrine of the city Lift the proud walls on these massive foundations , set the painted windows ablaze with glorious colour, do not let the ivy outgrow your completed work, or this generation pass before all is perfect There is no difficulty in agreeing with that The saint will be painted aright some day, and then it will be a matter of much congratulation that his house is ready Meanwhile, though there must needs be man wants, and some few discordant elements in any unfinished work, there seems to be occasion for a word of comment on some few eye sores which might easily be removed Cobwebs on the vaulted roofs of the aisles could be removed with the assistance of a ladder and a long handled broom, and spiders have not the excuse of sparrows for their choice of habita- tion Plum black lettered placards, announcing the purpose of the inside collection, destroy utterly the artistic effect of the tail brass candlesticks And last-a very small matter should not the cushions of the preacher s desk be brushed, and dusted, and shaken before the congregation as semble ¿
