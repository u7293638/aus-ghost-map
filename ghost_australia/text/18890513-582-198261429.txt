; correspondence. Sib,— Kindly .permit me to make a few statements in reference te some remarks made at the anniversary of the Campbells Greek IVes- Ieyan Church on Wednesday last. A rev gentle man made some comments similar to what he "did about 25 years ago. He stated that it was the most difficult matter to preach to empty pews, which, n-i douht. Sir, iri very true, hut he further guaranteed the congregation if they would all sit in 'the centre nt the church he would preach to them some 'of his best sermons. This I fail to understand, for if men preach as moved by the Holy Ghost, no riiatte'r where the people sit, sermons directed by the spirit of God will burn with intensity pf feeling, when the result, will be the salvation of immortal souls. Churches everywhere are speaking of the lamentableness of empty pews, ana the cry of the present age is for learned arid cultured clergy. Colleges arid Universities are sending riien out stuffed full of learning, and full of doc trine, but tbes'c do not attract and meet the failures. If men' s6 trained in culture and doc- ' trine, then, fail to reach the mass of people with such 'sounding sermons, and wliile ministers coiitfnue ti> soar to such theoretical heights, empty jfcws "there will be. What is wanted is tliat earnest zeal which many of the old fathers had — to know nothing among men, save Christ. What did tlte'Saviour mean when he said — " If I be lifted np'I will draw all men unto Me." If w e Want to see our churches filled, it must bo 'done by faithful riervunts of God, -who, like the apostles of old, not only preached Christ, but lived Christ. Such being the case, there will bo no fear of colds, and our church organs troubled with asthma, 6r bronchitis. — Yours, Ac., Campbells Creek, May 13th, 1889 JUNIUS.
