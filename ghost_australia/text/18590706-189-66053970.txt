THE CHINESE MISSION. Pursuant to adrertiscment,ah public meeting was held on Tuesday evening at the Council Chambers, Sturt street, for the purpose of receiving from the - Bishop of Victoria (Hong Kong) a description -of the -state of the Mission- in China, and of the diocese of Victoria. The Chambers were well filled soon after the hour advertised for the opening of thé proceedings and, soon after the business was opened, the place was densely crowded. The chair was taken by. Jas. Oddie, Treasurer of the Ballarat Branch of the Chinese Mission in this Colony, and, assembled around him on the platform, were the Bishop of Victoria, the reverend Messrs Potter, Searle, and Bickford,-and Messrs W. H. Foster, and the Mission Agent, Lo Sam Yuen The proceedings were Opened, by ismging the hymn c»mn^icaBg <*From all that dwell below the skies,** after winch 'prayer was offered by theiler.

There waa a large population, and : the Chinese portion svas very ignorant, «rät the Taiseion, therefore, should bave our sy m-. pathiea. ,;. , -./ . '.X ¿ ! ^ Tee resolution was carried by aoclatna&ra.; ' The Bishop of Victoria then addressed Ute* meeting. He returned his sincere and hearty thanks for the welcome W liad received fay the meeting and the people pf oBallarstt. . :He had come hither in the hope that he might oe useful in: raising a phQauÜirorA^iiitereet^ in the Chinese misóon. ' '-China ' must ever be interesting alike to the «nan of letters, the statesman; 'end;^the Christian. His special business, then was to' report on the Ballarat Chinese jrnission, and to make what sugges- : ttons he thbnglit might be useful with respect to the'future management' of "the'mitmon. Doubtless the briiigntg pf the Chintae hither was providential, and^amid |he new come.; rumors Of wats, he trusted we jshouldjall see ' the hand of God at work in tal the changes . taking place in the old world and the new. The advent office trade wjis accompanied by ^ the 0|>ening of the Californian and Australian gold fields. Since then a .road had been opened to Japan. Now colonisation was form ing here the nucleus of vast future empires, and who would say the vicinage of Cltina was. not one of God'« plans for the Cluistianiza tion of that populous empire^ He believed : God meant that the con tact bf the two races \ Bhould do away with the. prejudices ¿so long existing,'and open the . way for the bitter j civilization of China. He would :.not j meddle with " our local politics at all. A residence of fifteen years in China had assured him that people were A: loyal i and kindly- people, and well able and ready to appreciate all acts of kindness and .sym pathy. The patriarchal system of Govern ? ; ment extant in China made obedience and j kindliness a habit as it : were; «nd nowhere else was there more filial piety to be reoog- \ nized. The interior bf à Chinese family" wa* j a beautiful sight. Old age and parental authority were venerated and obeyed there with greater deference than anywhere else;' and even we might leirn ' from them in these respects. The permanency of her institutions might be taken as a fulfilment of toe promise attached to the fifth commandment,, True, her government was despotic, birt a demo cratic element was extant there nevertheless, and was growing too. The Press had a sub stitute there. But Ote prevalence of secret, societies in China was a great eviL -Springing* from the advent of the Manchon dynasty. some of those secret societies had long existed, but now they seemed to have de generated into mere secret organizations for. mutual succor from the law. But he: did not believe Ve need fear stich" organisa- ; tions here. Here they were too glad to be under our equal rule to band together for , any secret purposes ns at home. ' ''There might be occasional ^convenience found i from their esprit de corp* which-led them' sometimes to hide one another from arrest ! when die laws had been infracted China had anticipated Great Britain for ' several centuries in many literary matters, parti- * cularly in reference to competitive examin ations for all « fficer-i of the state. The : putting up of offices for sale bad become a great evil, and that evil had been increased, necessary though it were froth want of funds in the public treasury, hy the heavy indem nity imposed on the Emperor by the British in the late war. Literature flourished in Chine, but the emigrants who came hither were poor and illiterate. Th-, res angwin ¿emt forced them hither, and th< y «houH he received with sympathy and kindness. Old and decrrpid par. nts were eupport-d often from the proceeds raised by the emigrants hire. The discoveries in tbe arts and sciences in China were many of them anterior to those in Europe, but no correspondent advances had been made by the Chinese people. They seemed to stand still with the inventions they had had for so many centuries, as for instance, the compass, block printing and gunpowder. Theology in China was rather a system of political ethics after Confucius than a system of morals or religious duties. That sage seemed to teach that aa people were not per fect in knowledge of the things of this world it was utterly useless to bother about the next world ; but there seemed to bc a partial recognition among the people, of the principles of natural theology. Buddhism had, how ever, overrun the whole empire, and that, too, by the means of the Press. The tracts dis tributed by Buddhist mendicant priests had mainly effected this; and in that fact he trusted that he saw the ground for hope for the spread of Ciiristianity over all that land by a similar agency. There was but little religious feeling in China. The worship of the ancestral tablet was the chief religions sentiment among the Chinese people. Bot there was ne religious veneration,there, for on their holy days they wordd bring then gaming tables into use everywhere, eren amid their chief religious observances. The worship of their' ancestors, bow ever, was a most tender and deeply rooted «nperetition, and no mistnonary ought to forgetJ Hist, or too harshly attempt to overthrow the practice, till he should be able to build up something better in its place. Adverting to the civil war in- China, the Bishop dwelt upon the sufferings experienced in consequence, and the many episodical evidences given of the moral influence of the nussionaries^and the good feeling of-fte inhabitants 'towards foreigners. Iconoclasts, sent, as they said, by heaven, to set1 np Ti .Ping Won the Eng of Peace, (fae insurgents fought through a bloody war to get lid of tbe Tartar dynasty, and set up the regal and pacific Ti Ping Won. Then there were sob or assistant kings, one of whom claimed tb be a brother of God, another a simim-law, and another thc Holy Ghost < the4 comforter. Most frightful had been the desttoäonJbrougb^aboufc-by-tht wtu% .and great firâ&t;àes had been al sc opened np miAjàoy and elsewhere for tht spread of t^hristian truth; so he would hope that the great Ti^ingiebellion would prov« to be a means of Otóñese enlightenment Most iiHTxffit'frrwoT^ Plenipotentiary to lend any aid to the effet* dynasty ot Clima. 1 J Anarchy* was iripread ova all the land* the law '*üsr powerless, and s .oomriletev.|9t3td.-.coteo6 prevailed every where.

The Bishop lio. asid the Chinaman responds to sympathy. Then let us frown down the petty tyrannies praoti»ed opon these strangers by ^ too many of tlte , European population.

The Ber. Mr Potter, incumbent of Christ's Church, supported .die vote, and congratu lated himself and the meeting on the presence of the Bishop here, in connection with the "forms, and usages anddoctrines of the Church' of England. The Chairman put the motion, which was responded to by the crowded. meeting rising and cheering." , , * ¡I The Bishop briefly aclmovH edged the vote, afler jwhioh , ;th^ sung, the: benediction was pronounced, and the meeting broke up.. .' . ... * The amount collected during the meeting was £14 ls, which, with £13158 6d collected on Sunday,-jnakes a total of £27 6s 6d. IKQ.ÜE8T.-Br CLendinning held an in quest at the" Lamb Inn, on Tuesday, 5th .inst., on the body of Elisabeth Whit?, aged about three and a half years, who died after ashor , illness on Monday morning. The post mar^ teni ' examination made by Dr Allison, re-" vealed inflammation of the stomach, but there was no evidence as to the origin thereof, the doctor nevertheless gave it as his opinion that' the diet of the child on Saturday last would, have greatly aggravated any previous irrita tion. The said diet consisted of sugar stick of a yellow and pink color, afier which bread and cheese, and at night comed beef. The jury returned a verdict in" accordance with the facts above stated.
