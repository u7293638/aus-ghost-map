\ ^tSe GEELONG HANDICAPS. I ,TO 'TtJB EDXTOE OF THE AUSTRALASIAN. " Xflst week I had occasion to haul Mr. Sio^Qng jpver the coata; for the way in which th# Gresuick handicaps were made, and now I am ooee^more fcompelled to rueh into print, on account of the terrible mull made of the two prrtftipal fcr.efe at Geelong. ' Not that, as in the fpirper, C8K, there, are many'mistakes com xaiUed, but the weights. jawfcraed to the tiro the lop of the list spoil the wtioie «or<eern. Oid England's performances cer tainly ertifle hie: t& carrv hi? wef^ht for age, Ost., 6Qicr.g6t.Eud; a croa u of moderates. Let -us feee. what they are. At Rmdwiek, last aiitjjicn, .he ran nowhere to Fishhook and Hair Alhol for atbe Leger, baring fallen soon /I'tereiarticg; was just defeated by a head by 'Haxnbleion &iil;, for the Maiden Plate; won the' JBtuie Stakes, one mile and a quarter, fqtilfoja 2mio. 21rec., beating Blair At hoi (3;b; fxtra), who ran Fishhook to a head for the Leger; and, carrying 8st. 121b., Lady longefon, 8»t, beat him for tlie. Rons Handicap by a nose. Last New Year's Day, at Melbourne, he made hie appes ranee for the fort Phillip Stakffi in half condition, and as a satura) consequence was nowhere; but at JBendigo lie had so much improved that, carrying 8bL 21b, lie von the Sandhurst Cup, two. "mSes and a distance, in 4miu. gsec., .ljeatug Norms, 5#t. 8!b., Woodman, 7st. 101b., . and- .^Tokeiy 5st. l21b.-for which win he here receives 41b. from Norma, 71b. from Token, «iud only -gives Woodman 21 b. Verily this is .{gggnig ihe.boot on the wrong leg with a T«$geanoe. Besides which, on the following jday .be woe the Bendigo Town .Plate, weight lor-i^e, in a common canter; but sulking in the , Bendigo Handicap, ran nowhere. In ?epite of Cowra's Xasmauian performances, I _ think she***' quite entitled to receive 4lb., in .additionjto her year, from Old Sogland, and accordingly ought to have had 8it. 10lb. At die present weights none of those below jthttejtwo hare any chance. And.poor Faugh a-ballsgb again gets* «tone too, much. Why what ch#tnce has a common hack racehorse with Io»yboy at equal weights p I auppote .Token-gets 61b. more than Norma because the latter.teat him so easily, at a diifweiice of 4Jb., .the ot|*er day at Bendigo.
