GHOSTS. to tus editor op tub aos. Sir, — Your review ot Mr. Ingram s book on ghots and supernatural, in Saturday's issue, woald lead to the belief that you are quite oblivi ous of the cvidoncs of Alfred Russell Wallace, F.R.G.S., tbo eminent naturalist ; Wm. Crookes, F.U.8.; Lord Kayleigh, F.1CS., professor of physics in tho University of Cambridge : Crom- \pflll Vnrlftv. F.R.S.. C.K.: W. P. Barrett, nro. feasor of physics in the Royal College of Science, Dublin ; Professor De Morgan, President of tbo Mathematical Society of London ; Dr. Elliotson, F.R.S., Bn. Howiit, Dr. Wm. Gregory, professor of chemistry in the Univerity of Edinburgh, and a large number of others, eminent in literature and scieoce in England, continental Europe and America. Oth&rw; se you would h&vo; scarcely reached the conclusion that " belief in ghosts is composed of a reminiscence of ancestor worship," and " that shrinking which timid people feci in the dark." It has fallen to my lot 10 exp'ain away ono or two ghosts, even to tho satisfaction of tho seers, but in face of the evidence above re ferred to (tuore than strong enough to hang the Archbishop of Canterbury), I do uot feel myself in a position to deny that "thero are more things in heaven and earth thau are dreamed of in our philosophy." If believers in tupernatuial ap pearances wero bold enough to record their ex perience (reri or imagined) and evidence was taken, I think more than "ouo ghost with pre tensions to authenticity." would bo discovered in Australia. — Yours, ftrnth Yarra, I4tb May. SCEPTIC.
