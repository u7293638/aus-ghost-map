BERWICK. From our ownr correspondent. The usual weekly meeting of the Ber wick Mutual Improvement Society was held on Thursday evening last, in the Mechanics' Instiute, Mr. Camm in the chair. Notwithstanding the unfavorable weather, there was a very fair attendance of members and their friends. The pro gramme for the night, which consisted of "Readings from Shakespeare," was gone into with considerable spirit. As might haveobeen expected, the old favorite pas. sages formed the bulk of the entertain ment, Mr. C. Searle giving " Mark Antony," Mr. J. Wilson, "The speech of Portia," Mr. D. Martin, "Cardinal Wols. Icy," and Mr. Camm, "All the world's a stage."' The soft accents of Mr. Bucks' voice were heard to advantage in "King Henry's soliloquy." Among the im promptu speeches, which came in as a sort of addendum to the proceedings, MIr. Bain spoke on. "A. blade of grass," and showed how much interest and ianstruc tion might be found by a careful eye in the green fields. On the whole, the meeting was well sustained, and reflected great credit on its aspiring.young mem bers. The recent appearance of a ghost in our quiet community has given rise to a con siderable amount of speculation in certain quarters. Whether it was a boii Jide ghost or only a phantasm of the brain, is a question which is under inquiry. One thing at least is certain, and that is, that it observed the etiquette traditionally ascribed to such 'uncanny' visitors by ap. pearing in the moonlight. Probably you may hear something more about it in my next.
