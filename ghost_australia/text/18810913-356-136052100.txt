IIEXIHAI. On Friday afternoon, 9th inst., we had quite alittle sensation, in the shape of a boat race between 0. Hudson and W. Boyd (not THE Boyd, don't you know)- two of Messre. Brown's workmen. About 5.30 p.m. both men appeared, Hudson being rather on the fleshy side; still he was first favourite, and odds were offered on him, with no takers. After the usual preliminaries the men were sent away to a, tolerably even start; but before many strokes were made it was quite evident that Charlie was too great an adept at handling the levers for his opponent, which, together with his pulling by far the better boat of the two, left Boyd with out a ghost of a chance, who, conse quently, soon caved in, and left Charlie to pull home as he liked. There was a, tolerable muster to witness the contest. A cricket match-being the first of the season-was played on Saturday, betwesei the Hexham 0.0. and the Woodberry 0.0., which resulted in a win for the latter team. The game was decided by the first innings, the relitive scores being Hexham, first innings, 39; Woodberry, 3 ; 'Hexbam, second innings, 6 wickets for 81. There was a slight contr;etemps during the match, which nearly brought the game to a premature conclusion. Mr. F. Harvey, in whose paddock the match was being played, raised an objection to its being proceeded with, owing to a per sonal animosity to the captain of the Hexham team; but by that gentleman very good naturedly withdrauing from the game, and subsequently from the paddock, the match, was proceeded with, though not with tlid' sani;d tirit.
