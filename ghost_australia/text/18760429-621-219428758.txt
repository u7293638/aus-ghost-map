an eccentric ghost. The London Globe says. that ghosts have re cently become much more varied in their mani festations than in the old times, when they always appeared in the same garb, and went through the same set of dreary performances. Mr. Crookes, it is weU known, has made quite a friend of Katie King, who reveals herself to him and a company of admiring spiritualists with the most charming freedom, not even flying from the glare of the electric Hght. He also grasps mysterious hands, which fade away in his grip, sometimes leaving flowers in his possession. In America a ghost has taken to displaying its presence in ways even more im pressive than those with which Mr. Crookes has made us familiar. Every reader of " Alice in Wonderland" must remember the cat which astonishes the little lady by vanishing into space, its grin alone remaining. According to the New York Times the ghost which is now filling American spiritualists with delightful horror has taken a hint from this peculiar animal. It appears before 44 circles" as a pair of eyes resembling baUs of fire. These eyes " float through the air of a crowded room, and produce such a sensation among the spectators as no previous ghost has ever produced." There is evidence that the eyes are not solitary phenomena, but belong to a body, for " the ghost is in the habit of dropping into a lady s bed-chamber at untimely hours., and of carry ing away the bed-clothes, and occasionaUy also the unfortunate occupant of the bed." Of course, no one knows why the strange being should manifest itself by its eyes alone. The fact is curious, but aU religions have their mysteries, and this particular mystery is left unexplained by the spiritualists.
