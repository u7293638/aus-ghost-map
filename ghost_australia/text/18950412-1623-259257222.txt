The mixture was perfectly white and ground like' llour. I vas undoubtedly hungry, and as I ate the food the thought occurred how I could have existed so Ions; supposing the ])eiiod wa.s as I believed since my wound -without food. The quantitygiven me was very large, but I • at the whole of it and felt very better. much " from something resembling a bottle <'f white e.la.-s [ touk a drink of water, and afterwards the tall man gave me a small fragrant of heib, or rather he placed it close to my nose, and as I in baled the scent it had a somnolent effect. As I dropped oil' to sleep my visitors departed. " When I awoke the first man whom I had seen was standing beside me, and he commenced talking in the same strange language which I had previously heard, lie several times pointed to Avarels the spot whence he and his companion used to enter and depart. I gathered from his actions that he was inviting me to accompany him, and sitting up on the coin h willingness to do so. 1 signified my 11 1 telt pertes tlv strong now, and was indeed glad of a little exen ise. bead ing the way like a ghost I saw that at the side my visitors ent-aed and departed there was a small exit. It was so arranged that it could not be noticed until mostly on it. from this a number of huge steps led downwards. 'I here must have been neaily one hun tir ed, and when the bottom was reached an immense space stretched out. " A dull light pencila.ted the place, though how or where it came from I did not a.t the time know. It seemed to me that wc must have gone about tour miles through winding passages and vaulted cavei ns sometimes downwards and as fmpiently ascending, when almost without warning save for a ((tieer noise I heard we came on the :.hoies of a great subterranean sea. I was nttcaly astounded at the exti aordinai y sight. The waters spaikled almost as if the film were shining on them, and even to my unaccustomed eyas vision was easy for iully a couple of miles around. " A low beach ran round the watery expanse and the sands -littered as the slight waves tolled in upon them. As I afterwards saw, the beach was entirely composed of disintegrated granite and the beel of the buried sea was of the s.mie material. The cup of my astonishment was, however, filled when [ noticed that on the sea were numerous fantastically shaped canoes —or rather boats—like Malay proas, or the canoes used by many of the South Sea islanders. Some of these had one and others two or three occupants, who were clad in a light-fitting brownish costume." " When wc first saw you," exclaimed Stanley, recovering from his surprise, " you were dressed in the same manner, I think !" "Yes," continued O'Malley, "the garments you saw on me were similar to those I noticed worn by the boatman on the strange sea, for afterwards I spent most of my time—as befitted one brought up to the sea—on the subter rancan ocean, as I called it. "I looked in vain for the opposite shores of the water, but as far as I could see it stretched further still. "Walking down on the sands, my guide led the way to the neatest canoe—or rather he accompanied me towards it— I was eager to know what its occtllor 1'iants were doing on that buried sea. | As wo reached the water I instinctively i tilled the julm of my hand with the tluid and tasted it.

T '- tnnit-sluped, tuotigli more elongated, but the ones [ •a\v were not blind. " When, as I told you, T saw the people in the canoes I was doubly a.,- tonislK d. first the sm pn.,e of seeing over a hundred human beings pale as my guide on the water in boats was al most oveiwhelming, and would pio bably have been (piite so had it not been for previously seeing the two pale beings in my sick chamber, as I may call it. "The next smpiisc I got was to find these men were-like Peter and James of holy memory -lidieimen. As I eagerly watched the boat nearest me 1 saw that whilst some of them had nets others used small reeds like spears, and the place seemed to team with lish. Some weie of a reddish brown colour, but the gieater part were white. I signified my desiie to see mmuc of them at < loser quarte'is to my guide, and he, making a signal to one boats, it came of the' to the glittering strand. 1 he occupants were two men not tin like my guide, inasmuch as, they were dean shaved , but, as I have already said, their dress was somewhat different. I hey looked keenly at me with then daik pink eyes, but certainly did not evince half as much cunosity at my np pearance as 1 did at theirs. They wen almost as phlegmatic and fateful as an Hindoo or an American Indian. '"Stepping into the l.^oat, which would have comfortably held half-a do/en adults, the two men paddled out to the spot they had just left and again re sinned their occupation. As 1 looked over the side of the small craft 1 could see dimly a fish occasionally swim by, but those in the boat with keener sight invariably speared them in the most elextereius fashion. ( Hnte a num bet of lish lay m the bottom of the canoe. None of them were large, though some shaped like- a salmon trout coulel not have been less than i 8 inches in length. "As I bwaine accustomed to the sigh": I looked upward almost expecting that 1 would see the sun's ra\s sto aming down, luit thai did not mee! my vision. I could, however, not fail to notice thai in a hundred directions there was what might be called ieHeeled light, which to some extent illumined the seascape. " I knew sufficient of the rudiments of optie.s to unelerstand that in the first instance that light must have come from the Mm, but how it was conveyed and distributed was long a mystery to me. furthermore, I began to realise that the mysterious place 1 was in was almost as well ventilated as though it were on the surface of the earth. This was another riddle to me. Then how diel these fish obtain their food ? I picked up one from the bottom of the boat and carefully examined it. I found that it was in excellent condition, and later on when I partook of some it proved most delicate and palatable. " Not understanding the language of the subterranean residents 1 was, of course, at a great disadvantage, as I could not make inquiries, but later on it was all made plain. " Presently r heard a babble of sound about me, and I saw on turning my head that the fishers were ail making for the beach or shore. Our boat was also pulled in and the two men proceeded to pack the fish into a kind of white rush basket. The scene on the beach at this time was one of great animation, as all the occupants of the canoes were gathering up their spoil and preparing to depart. I asked my guide in Knglish what it all meant, and where they were going, but he only stared blankly at me and said something in his own tongue which was as ««nntclli-tble to me as my (jucstion were " to him " As soon as the crowd had departed —m hich they did in a direction onpo- ate M . to that m which we came-my ni>stenous guide .. went atter (hern - and - -I fo!-; 'owed. Walking round the beach for J tHr«»-» a mile a broad par-s- igc—or | I tatliea high mad, if it might be so called — u ' as ''s.t hed, and we turned into a . unt'' ... ,, we , came , to another , space. --,.-,-; It seemed to be ns large as tlie sea, which we had just left, in area, but, unlike th<. fitter, there was no water in it. On t,lC '-'intrary I at oncc glUg,scd that it i was the site of a town or village, though nn hou-.es <.>r public buildings in the c ; e nwe mean were to be seen. Munj s< reens of various sober "'olouis were dotted over the spat e, and ! ' )0 '^ntre was a large clearing.

"I suppose you were the centre of attraction and curiosity by the women and chihhen in the billing gate market ?'' Mills said, with a laugh! "No; they scarcely took notice of me, and then that was another sign to my mind of the eastern origin of the people If they stared at me they must have done so surreptitiously, for I diel not notice them, and their manner was full of decorum. "Of course I am narrating my story just as events happened to me. I could easily anli< ipate by the light of my subsequent knowledge, if I (-boose to do so, hut it would only spoil the histoiy. "As I wa, thus musing I he sere en was lifted and my guide entered with some beautifully < ooked fish. Jt had been stuffed with some of the Homy malei lals I had previously eaten. Tin . was mixed wnh fiagiant hcilrs and the whole then baked. " I could not undeistand how this was done, lor throughout my raiubli s I had not noticed the least sign of liie or smoke. I lasted the h ,h. whu h 1 found to be delicious, and as (here was a large stone basin of fie .h water in the pla< e I made an excellent meal. In addition to the fish there were some fiat, bisenit-shapcci pieces of ground vegetable mattei which lasted not unlike potato ( ake.

"An outlet from the buiied ;ea r<r lake existed a hundred and nUg yards back and a broad cascade of foaming water came tumbling down into a great circular basin apparently formed of the purest white marble. I thought at the time that the basin was a natural formation, but I afterwards found it was not so—at least to some extent it was, but the marble had been obtained miles away and skilfully built info the natural depression. From the great basin radiated a number of smaller ones of all shapes and si;:cs, and the whole presented a most beautiful appearance.
