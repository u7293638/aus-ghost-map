THE MYSTERY OF MISS GAREW. By-XL E. STANLEY Pjsnn. " Jack, is it your 'intention to marry Mrs. Winthrop?" ..... . "If she will do me the .honour to C ac.c< pt me—it is." .•.,-.. . .This point-blank eiiquiry and decisive replvwere exchanged between-. myself, Wilfred Madeley, and ray friend, Jack Daven.->iit, one autumn evening five years «go, as we stood on the terrace of the hotel at Biirgenstock, near Lucerne. "Biirgenstock.'' us perhaps-some of; my leaders are aware, is a lofty wooded . promontory, which juts out abruptly 011 the east side of the lake of Lucerne. A funicular railway shoots up almost perpendicula'ly from the shore to the summit of the cliff, • which is-crowned by a big while hotel, where my friend and I had been spending our autumn holiday. We \ve*v both hamsters,-but I was perforce a hard 1 worker,' while Davenant mere).?, "coquetted with the law,' 1 having ind.eperideiit : meanp. " Is there any j;ist : .rd.usekoiviiiipedi7 ment wliy I should not:.-marry""Mrs: Winihrpp ?" he demanded; "turning- hift a4aildson 1 o bronzed face.towards me.'.;;. • in' 'eVuSjIFfenBe oB. the word, and" yon aie a lucky man if'yor win lier. But there may be an ' impediment.' Her sister, Miss Carew, has evidently made up her liiind, for reasons best known to herself, that Mrs. Winthrop shall not marry again if she can prevent it." '•But fori tmately she can't prevent it." he interrupted." "If Stella—Mrs Winthrop—loves 1 ne, as I hope and believe she does, it is not likely she will give me up at the bidding of that interfering old maid." " She would he very foolish to do so. But she seems to be in the habit of yielding lo her sister, and even to be a little afraid of her, which surprises me, for Miss Carew does not give' one the. impression of being a particularly strong-willed or strong- minded person." " Not strong-minded certainly," he acquiesced. " In fact it has occurred to me more than once that she is a little bit," he touched his forehead significantly, <• and perhaps that is the, reason Mrs. Winthrop gives way ,t'o her, not to irritate her by opposition. ITaven't. you noticed hernervousrestless manner, and the scared sort'of look she lias, as if she had once seen a ghost and had never got over itf I laughed. " She is sane enough to make herself uncommonly disagreeable sometimes," I remarked : " but to do her justice, she seems devoted to her sister, though in a jealous sort i.f way that must be rather tryiug." " Trying 1 Stella must be an angel to endure it !" he exclaimed. " Poor darling, her life has not been a very bright one hitherto. Married at eighteen to a man old enough to be her father, who kept her shut up like a nun,, and now, tormented by the tyranny' and old-maid sister ' 13ut, if i>< «.n jlor,„M i o me, the future shall atone for'fihe pits^he added, .more to.himself than to mo, and returned to his contemplation of the view. At a giddy depth below us lay the '' Lake of the Four Cantons," calm as a mirror in the evening stillness, while to right and left, like twin sentinels, rose the majestic forms of the Righi and Mount, Pilatns. The sun had set' long ago, but the golden glow still, lingered, and all the air seemed luminous. Dinner was over, and; the Biirgenstock guests, among whom Germans predominated, were trooping out on the terrace to drink coffee and enjoy the cool evening air. . Trim -waitresses bustled about, the hotel-band-began to to play, and presently'an electric lampwas strung up to a pole above our heads, illuminating, the ierra.ee igiiymv). " Here they are at last!" Jack exclaimed, after many expectant glances; over his shoulder, arid lie went forward to meet two ladies who had 'just : emerged from the house, Except in figure and complexion,., both being fair, and both tall and'! slender, the sisters were as great'a .con-.' trast as could well lie imagined. " Mrs,. Winthrop was a fragile,.girlish-looking: woman of three or fourr:and-t'wenty,- with soft appealing blue ey.cs., and arched biw£,' which gave her face a look of innocent -surprise.: It-was. 'a; face which, if not. actually beautiful, was singularly attractive; none, the, less so, perhaps,. for tbe suggestion of. weakness in the pretty curved lips and dimpled chin. Miss Garew was-at least ten years lier aist&Ps; 's^m^'-i^.lbbked even olde^^'ad^Kerr^/.tfi^ks^'Jter worn features and pallid . compleki'dp. Her manner was-nervous and abrupt, and her eyes, One brown'' eye's, which redeemed;- her. . face .-from plainness—iiacl at. times,! as. Jack had i'Cinarke'!, a eui.'io.usly.stiirtledlook, as if the shadow ofrsome;great';fear"haa passed ovet her .. . " JJ.ow laic you are !" wasimyiriend's greeting.

" And . not very 'safe,'/\\.Davj3iiant- ..added, lowering his voice; " there is a' thief in itliisThouse.

" You make me quite nervous," Mrs. Winthrop declared, half- laughing, half serious. " I hope Arc you-going, Edith f she broke off, as Miss Garew began to roll up lifer knitting. " Yes, I am cold," the latter replied;' with a shiver. " You had -better co'nieindpors too, it is getting late." ,' The young widow iiesitated, butmeeting her lover's pleading gaze, she' answered with unusual decision : "Notyet ; I will join you presently." Her sister seemed about to speak again, but changed her • mind,'- and J walked -away in silence. Soon afterwards, I also discreetly' vanished, leaving Davenant to make 1 the most of his opportunity. f= An liour later, loo'king from my windpw, 1 saw the two 'lovers', still tete-a-iiile,' apparently unconscious of the fact that' Miss Carew, grim and inscrutable as j one of tbe Fates, was watching them' from the steps of the verandah. II. " Well, Jack, am I to congratulate 1 you?" I asked my friend the following day, as we were smoking after lunch in a shady nook of the shrubbery. " Congratulate me on what 1" he demanded moodily. " Oil having won the "fair widow, for I suppose you came to an understanding last night? Surely she has.no^t refused ryou ! "• I added, noticing his ,gloomy, expression. "She neither refused nor-accepted me,"lie.answered, 'discontentedly. " 1 could not set hei^to" give me a definite answer. She-acknowledged that shecared far me, but talked mysteriously .o&nn;,,.obstacle between us, and when 1 aaliod. , i ' Of course the ' 0&tacl;&' v il®HikH<^,t^l<j —confound her !
