LAYING A GHOST. The proceedings taken by the young men of the neighbourhood have probably effec tually 'laid' the Bayne-tttreet ghost, Bendigo, as on Sunday night the masquerader was fired at by a party searching for him, and, leaving his ghostly mantle, escaped over a fence and disappeared. Shortly after 8 o'clock some youths, armed with a double-barrelled gun, stationed themselves at the corner of Bayne-streeb and Sfcewarfc-street, and had not been waiting long when piercing screams were heard from tho corner of the next street. lho young men ran to the spot, and found a girl frantic and trembling with fright. She could only utter, ' The ghost, the ghost,' and swooned away. Turn ing the corner tho lads saw a tigure in white moving slowly along the footpath, under the shade of the street trees. One of them fired at it, and without a sound the figure jumped a neighboring fence, and made off into the garden. The ghostly mantle was dropped in tho flight, and when picked up was found to consisb of half a dozon yards of white muslin. As it bore shot marks it is more thnn pro bable that the ' ghost ' was struck by some of the pellets, though he gave no Bign. Tho whole neighborhood was aroused in a very chorb time, but though searoh was made till midnight nothing more was seen of the author of tbe scare.
