THE WOODSIDE GHOST. The sequel to the Woodside ghost story, which was published in The Advertiser recently, was enacted in the local Police Court on Thursday. A charge was laid by the police against A. Rudd of unlawfully disguising himself with a piece of white cloth, and he was therefore deemed to be idle and disorderly. Mr. L. von Doussa prosecuted and Mr. R. D. Beresford appeared to defend. The evidence showed that on the night of May 6, while Thomas Meddal, who was de scribed as "a shoemaker and poet," was on his way home he noticed a figure in white emerging from the Wesleyan Ceme tery. As it approached him he heard it say, "Thomas Meddal, l claimyou." He answered, "Take me, then," and struck it with a stick which be carried. The ghost "closed" with him, and in the scuffle the sheet was dis arranged, and Meddal identified Rudd. The result of the case was that a fine of 10s. was inflicted, with costs, making Â£4 5s. which tile ghost had to pay for his nocturnal rambling.
