THEY LIVE FAST IN PARIS. I By latest reporta it is proved that lunacy is greatly on the increase in Paris and its environs, but judging from the tone of the newspapers there regarding this country alone, it would " need no ghost come to tell us that," nor " report" neither. 'This, of course, is " spoke sarcastic." Seriously, tlie statistics alluded to are deeply interesting and well worthy of study-they are not only surprising, but startling. Up to I860 the number of female lunatics far exceeded that of the male, whereas now the men supply more than one-half the entire number. The married and single lunatics are about equal. When we come to inquire into the supposed cause of this advancing wave of insanity, it is found that excessive drinking is the leading one. Yet all writers have hitherto pointed to France as less drunken than England or Scotland. The most important element in bringing about the increase in the number of lunatics is " domestic troubles," which do not come from " money losses," nor " domestic affliction." Therefore, we must conclude that "conjugal iufidelity" alone affords the true explanation.
