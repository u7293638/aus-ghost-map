WEDNESDAY, AUGUST 27, 1873. The Electoral Act Amendment Bill Nvas laid aside by the Legislative Coun- cil last liight, on the motion5 of Mr. O'shanassy, by a majority of 1G to 10. "With the exception of a few local nota- bilities, who have been reckoning their chickens before they were hatched, and ? cultivating constituencies which were only in the embryo, we suspect that nobody will be violently grieved at the fate which has overtaken the measure. Even its authors-it may I be anticipated-will neither tear their ] hair nor indulge in passionate expres- sions of sorrow over their " lost " Leonore." Tho preparation and in- troduction of a Reform Bill were forced ' upon them by the exigencies of their position j and while, in the concoction of it, they were compelled to consider not so much what was desirable as what was practicable, and what would I be acceptable to the majority of the Assembly, they must have in-1 dividually felt that, neither in principle nor in detail, was the measure one of which-as private members-they could have heartily approved. One-horse con- stituencies had nothing to recommend them beyond the altogether unworthy plea of their novelty. No really valid j reasons were adduced for increasing the | number of representatives in the As- sembly to 90, and the abolition of the ratepayers' qualification seemed to have been resolved upon without rhyme or reason. There was considerable force in Mr. ! O'Shanassyt's remark last night, that owing to tho entire absence of anything like- an organised and effective Opposi- tion in the Lower House, the duties and responsibilities properly attaching to such a body were unfairly cast upon the LegislatiY'e Council. It is in that Chamber, he obser\red, that the Mi- nisterial measures, Yvhich aro acquiesced in and perhaps amended, but not criticised by the Assembly, havo to be discussed and disposed of on their merits. So far as the debate of last night was concerned, the duty Yvas satis- factorily performed. The speeches were for the most part concise, practical, and to the point, and although they never rose into eloquence-for Mr. Fitz- gerald's fervid volubility cannot lay claim to that epithet-the general tone and character of the discussion were creditable to both sides of the House. A good point was made by the leader of the Opposition Yvhen he reminded his hearers that cabals wore quite as frequent in largo as in small assem- blies ; as also when ho remarked that while the bill made no pro- vision whatever for the representation of minorities, it Yvould almost inevitably happen that, Yvherever there were several candidates before a ' constituency a minority only would bo represented. It YY'as altogether superfluous, he argued, to increase the number of law-makers, at the very time when there was little or no work to do, and Yvhen local legisla- tion Yvas actually played out. Oh the Ministerial side of the ques- tion, the best speech Yvas that of Sir Francis Murphy, although ho Only ? professed to give a qualified support to the bill. He contended that this Yvas a favourable opportunity for rectifying acknoYY'ledged anomalies in our electoral system, and volunteered a defence of representation by purely local men, failing apparently to perceive that a Parliament should be a national council, composed of men capable of taking broad and national vícyvs of public questions, and not of provin- cial delegates, elected for the promotion of the small interests of their respective localities. However, the Council has apostrophised the bill in much the same terms as Hamlet adjured his father's ghost,-" Rest, perturbed spirit, rest ! " and its repose is not likely to be dis- turbed, Yve believe, by any ebullitions of painful emotion on the part of the Government or of the country. The concession made by Mr. Langton to popular feeling with regard to the rate of interest to be allowed on the savings banks deposits has not been in vain. The second reading of the bill to effect an amalgamation between the post-office and commissioners' banks was carried last evening by 32 to 23, despite the strenuous efforts of those who thought they saw a favourable oppor- tunity of harassing the Government in connexion with the proposal. As Mr. Francis pointed out, the agita- tion against the measure has been more noisy than widely spread. "We can scarcely wonder that those gentlemen who feel that their services will in all probability be dispensed with so soon as the new arrangements are perfected should have done their utmost to perpetuate the existing state of affairs, but there is very little reason to doubt that they were at the bottom of all the opposition out of doors that the Trea- surer's scheme has evoked. Some hon. members, led away by the interested clamour that has been raised over the matter, have been anxious to gain a little cheap popularity by espousing the cause of the malcontents, but the result of last night's division will show them that they have miscalculated the strength of public feeling. The House is se sensitivo to extraneous influences, that we may be sure the numbers would have been very different if the Govern- ment plan had been asunpopularthrough out the country as it was represented to be. The opposition was kept alive with difficulty by a few, and directly a pro- mise Yvas made that the i per cent, rate of interest should not only be maintained in favour of the com- missioners' customers, but that a simi- lar benefit should be extended to those who dealt with the Post-office department, tlie movement collapsed. There can be no doubt that if the reserve fund, which, as we have fre- quently shown, is the legitimate property of the state, is to be distributed amongst those who exercise the virtue of thrift, it should be divided equally amongst all, and not alloNved to fall to the lot of a favoured section. Under existing circumstances this is as fair an arrange- ment as could reasonably be looked for, or, to put it in another way, it is a com- promise to which the least objection can be taken. The principle of the bill having been now accepted, it is perhaps hardly worth while to say anything more in its sup- port. But there was a vieNv of the case put forward by the Attorney-General that has not, so far as Yve are aYvare, been noticed before, and ivhich is Yvorthy of brief consideration. The hon. gentle- man pointed out that the eleven banks at present carrying on business under the .auspices of the commissioners are each separate and distinct institutions, having no connexion Yvith and no reliance on each other. In the event of any mis- fortune happening to one, the funds of the restare not legallyavailabletotide it over its difficulties. It has only a right to demand from the commissioners the exact sum deposited Yvith them. Mr. Stüpiiln mentioned a case with which he Yvas professionally connected, Yvhore a considerable sum of money had been invested in the names of three orphan children. Their mother married again, and her second husband, being addicted to vicious courses, forged the names of the infants, and succeeded in obtaining possession of their funds, Yvhich he squandered Yvith all convenient speed. Application Yvas made to the trustees to make good the loss Yvhich had accrued through the mismanagement or neglect of their servants, but those gentlemen repudiated all liability. They had not got the money, they said, and therefore could not pay-it. The particular sum had been ear-marked to meet a certain liability, and it having been paid aYvay in error, there Yvas nothing in their hands to satisfy the demand made upon them Hero was an instance, one would think, when the reservo fund might havo been properly drawn on to make good the loss, but the fact that no such course Yvas adopted shows, YNe think, very conclusively that the commissioner! did not think their accumulated profits NN ere av nuable to meet such cases This being the case, we may well ask, of what use is a rcserv e fund to the customers of their banks 1 The amount was even tually forthcoming after a county court judge, yyIio acted as arbitiator, h id made an order foi pt) ment, but how it was proem ed Mr Stiphin hid ncvei been able to ascertain But although a b ink might be able to meeta compai.ttrv ely small loss of this dcsciiption, m wh it position would its customers find themselves if theie was any sciions deficiency in its funds, and the commissioners icfused to lecogmse the liability of their reserv e to meet tlie emergency? It is evident that a claim would be foithwith made on the national coilers, and such piessute w ould be brought to bear on Parliament as would be certain to secuie its recog nition As w as forcibly pointed out by Mr Francis and Mr Cohln, nine tenths of the depositors aie undoi the impression that the Government is re sponsible, and how ever groundless then convictions on this head may be m point of law, it isalmost impossible to undeceiv e them The same idea pervaded the minds of the customeis of the Rochdale Savings Bank, w Inch failed some j eai -, ago, and caused a vast amount of misery We think we may safely say that, whatever its legal position may be, the Government here would be held moially bound to protect the depositors fiom loss m the event of the tiustee3 of the various banks being unable to meet their engagements, and such being the case, it is surely only leasonoble that the management of the funds should be in the hands of the state It was interesting to hear the diversity of opinion oxpressed duimg the debate on this question of state liability And there could not be a better proof, we imagine, of the desirability of qpttmf the matter bevond the nossibilirv setting the matter beyond the possibility of a doubt. Concerning the safety of the money in the postofKce banks there can never be the shadoYv of a misgi\'ing, nor can there be any fear of its not being immediately available Yvhen de- manded in due form. The officials of the old banks, haY'ing done their utmost to avert their impend- ing fate, and failed, it is not perhaps too much to expect that they should abstain from all further opposition. We do not think they Yvill have much to complain of under the new regime. It is the intention of the Government to take over all the officers Yvhose services can be utilised, and tho rest aro to be compensated on the most liberal scale. Every officer dispensed Yvith will bo entitled to receive, for every year of ser- vice under the commissioners or trustees, one month's salary at the rate at Yvhich he may be paid at tho time the act comes into operation, -with 10 years added by Yvay of bonus, and a proportionate sum for any additional time less than a year. And furthermore if any such officer shall be appointed to an office in the public service at a reduced rate of pay, he is to receive " in con " sideration thereof a sum amounting to " one-twelfth part of such reduction for " each year of service." We think it will be admitted that those provisions shoYV anything but a niggardly spirit. While yvo still retain our opinion con- cerning the unadvisability of moving in the matter at the present time, Yve have no doubt of the beneficial nature of the proposed alterations, and hope to see the bill become law Yvithout any unnecessary delay. The City Council have decided that there shall be shops fronting the streets around the Eastern Market. As this arrangement will limit the available mar- ket space probably as to one-sixth of its whole area, and as the ground has already been found too small for market purposes, this decision to enclose it with shops can only be explained by supposing that the council are more eager to increase their gains than to accommodate the public. One advocate of shops, during the dis- cussion which took place upon tho propo- sition, quoted the Western Market as an instance, showing the practicability of shops being built round a market. But this gentleman would surely never call the block of buildings in Collins-street west a market, in the sense in which markets are understood. The truth is, the Western Market buildings were put up because almost any com plete structure was better than the ruins which for so many years had disgraced the place, and the few melan- choly potato warehouses which line the quadrangle are as much like a market as Carlton-gardens are like Chatsworth But it is to be hoped that the Eastern Market will be a little different from a narrowed-up square, enclosed by a hollow wall, the compartments of which are potato-bins on one side and fruit shops on the other. We have an example of the kind of shops the City Council are likely to build in that low of unsavoury little kennels extending on the west side of the present market, from Bourke-street to Little Collins street. It requires a good strong stomach to enable any average citizen to pass from one end of them to the other without feeling poorly. The less of such shops we have the better. What is really wanted at the Eastern Market is a roof of ground glass, a floor of bluestone, some rows of conveniently-arranged stone stands, and a good many fountains of wate. The varying requirements for the display of different commodities would suggest all the rest of the accommodation, and the enforcement of order and clean- liness would complete the arrangements To occupy half the space with brickwork, for the sake of increasing the city reve nues, would be unjust both to the buyers and sellers of market produce. Ugly and dirty as the present market is, it is more convenient than any palatial dreariness contemplated by our civic rulers. More over, it is questionable if the building of shops on a market reserve is quite legal, so that probably this aspect of the ques- tion will have to be reconsidered. However much wo may boliove m the virtues of the birch, the cane, or tho strap for the collection of ju- venile delinquents-such playful youug creatures, for instance, as Masters George Smitu, Edward Boswell, Johh Kinnlally, and George Whbi-mb, who recently broke into a chuicli, smashed the bookcase, poiuod the sa ciamental wine into tho harmonium, &c; -we would draw the lino somowheio.

Telegraphic communication with Europe Pas restored yesterday. By a majority of 10 to 10 the Legislative Council yesterday resolved to lay aside the Electoral Act Amendment Bill transmitted for the concurrence of that body by the legislative Assembly. This course was taken upon the invitation of Mr. O'shanassy, Who opposed and condemned all the leading lniuciples of the measure. It would perhaps have been better if the bolder course of lejecling the second reading or carrying the .ordinary motion that the bill be read a second time that day six months had been taken, JiecatiBc then the matter would have been definitely Bettled for the Bession. The expedient adopted for getting rid of the mcasuic is sometimes íesoiled to when the privileges of cither House ¡ire in question. The eflect of such a proceeding is that the l)ill may be revived during the same Bession. The Assembly may appoint two members to ascertain what has become of the measure, and upon their report the HoiiBe may determine to once more intro- duce the bill, with the view of sending it again to the other branch of the Legislature, cr a conference with a committee of the legislative Council may be asked for in order that a compromise may be arrived at. It is »ot likely, however, that the Government Yvill take either of these steps. In all proba- bility the really important business of the BCBBion, such as the Appropriation Bill and the Railway Bill, will be pushed forward as ? rapidly as possible, that some measures will be allowed to drop through, and that at an carl} date a prorogation, Yvith a view to a speedy dissolution and an appeal to the country on the Tlcctoral Bill, will tako place 'J he Go\ eminent m the Legislative As sembly jesterday succeeded m carrying the second reading of their Savings Dank Law Amendment Bill bj a majority of nine the numbers being 32 to 23 The only speeches delivered winch broke new ¿round were those of Mr Y\ rixon on the one side, and the Attorney General on the other The lion member for Belfast alluded to some clauses m the present ttt winch seemed toautho rise a distribution of profits as well as the pajment of interest and argued therefrom that the accumulated balance to the credit of the savings banks was the pro perty of the dei osttois and that to apprrpnate it as proposed would be abroach of faith Mr Stephen showed that this view of the matter could not be upheld because the 23rd clause of the old act providing for the distribution of profits was purposely left out of the existing act The word profits alluded to by the lion membei had no meaning and the deduction he drew from it could no more l e sustained than could the Becond story of a house after the basement had been pulled down Last night tho Lcyslativ e Assembly agreed to oblige mr Ilibiiiuuimwii by v-onaenting to devote Thursday night to the consideration of the Permissive Bill In another column will be found a tele gram from Deniliquin, Btatmg that a commu nication had been received on the authority of Mr Parkes to the effect that the Govern- ments of New South YValcs and Victoria had agreed upon the construction of a bridge across the Murray, which would be com menced immediately Wo are able to say that our Government has not been informed of such a circumstance About a week Bince, a communication was forwarded to the Colonial Secretary of New South Wales accompanying apian showing the site of the proposed railway and road bridge across the Murray at Lchuca as agreed upon by the representatives of the two Govern ments in 1800 The communication also stated that if Mr Parkes did not intend to reopen the question of site but adhered to the arrangement previously made, the Government of Victoria would at once have plans of the bridge prepared which would bo sent to the Colonial Secretary of the sister colony for his approval, and that on being approved the work should be commenced To this communication no reply has as yet been received, but if the telegram referred to be correct it means that New South Wales has consented to the terms previously settled between the two colonies, and insisted upon by Victoria vi?

It was alleged by members of the deputation that if that sum was gi anted it was very unlikely that further state-aid would be asked for. Mr. Langton promised to submit the matter to his colleagues. A deputation from the Geelong corporation, accompanied by the representatives for the district, waited upon the Minister of Lands yesterday with reference to the Geelong reserves. The corpoiation was desirous of ascertaining the conditions upon which it was to undertake the contiol of the public gar- dens. The council were willing to take charge of the íeserves, but they were anxious to know the amount of assistance they would obtain from the Government. Mr. Casey explained that, in accordance with the regulations already issued, the state would supplement any amount locally raised by an equal contribution. The Ciovvn grant for the reserves would bo made out in the name of the corporation and of the Board of Land and Works jointly, but the corporation would have full control over the management of the gardens, it being understood, however, that the money so supplemented by the state would be devoted to the practical maintenance of the grounds. After some desultory discussion, the deputa- tion suggested that the Geelong Council would be willing to give £750 per annum for the maintenance of the public reserves, but they desired that the fencing around the Botanical gardens which was at present in a vcrj dilapidated condition should be renewed The cost would lie about £750 and that amount they considered the state should pro vide Mr Casey offered togtveonehalf on con ditton that the council laised the other half, but this was not deemed altogether satisfae toi} Lvcntually he promised to brim, the matter before his colleagues The

Cameron, on piocceding to tho place indi- cated, fonnd that some stones had been luid on tho rails, and one of the stones he esti- mated to weigh at least 281b. The discovery of the obstructions fortunately frustrated the malicious intentions of the miscreant who placed the stones on the rails.
