MR. EAGAR STILL AL]^i.\ %Fhe living Geoffrey Eagar^the busy^ r %tive, chattermg clerk— ruining the finan .

AndHvhen he was summa ry—and, as we,all thought, finally— dis- ; posed^of we breathed more freely, and ' ~ pT.?

We had all -S?St Wj*1}? assisted at his obsequies. ^political 'wake' was really about one^ i of the most delightful events of the season iookuig on him as a defunct politician, we ..were more and more amazed to find what , J small creature had been ruling us We ..,ielt with the mighty satirist of Rome, -'' -; . m Mors sola fatetur -^ Quantula smt hominum corpuscula ,' But there he was dead! That was the f^ancholy satisfaction. He could Tot get out of his grave to accomplish what ap peared to be one of the sublime objects of i;^*-^, to shake the who'e ,SecUt of the country He has disappointed us all. He has left the sepulchre and ?,^rned up on Tuesday night atVwUm . ^eatre In that dilapidated templet ??jrineh few persons ever went for fun_a ,,;large number of people went on Tuesday ,,iught from curiosity. For there if*£ ;,perSonofMr ^off^y EagL, ^ 'a W ?cial resurrection. The g?eat and hungry ::mr^t3 Dr Wilson, was by the siS icJh?. ghost; and that arable/ persuasive ,. and hberal politician, Mr. W. R. pid(S i *f n*len- £6 T?S °f his Prese^e and the fascinations of his oratory to the enter „ teinment. The laconic Eamell was on the -. platform ; and indeed all of our seltdenv :- Ing and devoted patriots who want bread beef, and beer at the expense of the public' were assembled to welcome once more to Me and hope and place the man over f whose exit we had laughed and whose his I tory we had hoped the world had in mercy I forgotten. There they were on the stage j I of that very dimly-lit building, all pre pared to denounce the tariff and to damn | its author. The meeting had been admi rably arranged. It was announced that a J ' distinguished citizen' would appear and I take part in the proceedings. No one j dared to whisper the name. It might have I I been the Chief Justice, or his. epistolary J friend Mr. David Buchanan. Sporting I men might have tossed up as to whether it I was Lord Belmore or the Bishop of the I Free Church of England. The mystery I intensified the interest, and the « distin guished citizen' drew better than Italian Opera or the German-English drama of Mr. Bandmann. The industrious and not [ highly scrupulous agents of the P.P. A. arranged for an enthusiastic demonstra tion, a great popular condemnation of Mr. Samuel, and the elevation of Mr. Eagar.' The working men of Sydney, however, who have some interest in saving their class I from shame— who, like all other working men in every part of the world, have the keenest perception of impostors and the most undisguised detestation of shams— the working men of Sydney attended the meeting in large numbers. And, as a matter of course, they resented the insolence of trading politicians— starved-out adven turers in public life— fellows hungering after bawbees as greatness hungers alter glory— coming forward and pretending to play the patriot and to win the support of ! the people. And so it happened that the entertainment at the « Lyceum' was good —good as a pure matter of fun— good as showing that the people are not the vie timK OT fl.n imnnoifinT. .--,,,! ? i ? i i I „ ^^ ^TUOlululi — anu gooci as clearly I manifesting how little is the influence for good or evil of such persons as those who performed on Tuesday evening. That dramatic company, at all events, has had I its day. Its season was a very short, a very brilliant, but in the end a very disas trous one. If the whole corps dramatique would remove in a body to some congenial clime, where there is nn roG-noA ™;«™\\-,™ no public opinion, no gallant determina tion to chastise impostors, and where an i anti-Irish drama can be played and raptu rously applauded through a whole season, we would guarantee the performers a per fect immunity from such treatment as thev received c-n Tuesday night.
