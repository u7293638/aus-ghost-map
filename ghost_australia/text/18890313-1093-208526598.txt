TOO DEEP FOR TEARS. Oat of the silence, cold and drear, Of the ghost-like phantomB of yesteryear, Comes the low wailing, full of fear, Of a pain too deep for tears. Out of theBtormrack overhead, With it's.distant ramble, all thunder fed, Comes the deep anguish, full of dread, Of a pain too deep for tears, Out of the ocean's ceaseless tide, With the deepsea secrets its cold depths hide, Comes the sad murmur, far and wide, Of a pain too deep for tears,. For my love lies dead 'neath the Iow'ring sky, While the sere leaveB fall and bare branches sigh, \- And the sad sea moans and the wind blows high, And my pain is too deep for tears.
