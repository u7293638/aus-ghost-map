A GHOST ACTIVE. A REPORT is in circulation that at a public meeting in one of the metropolitan suburbs, not long ago, three gentlemen read speeches in opposition to the policy of the Reid Ministry. Some enquiring and ingenious reporter managed to get hold of the manuscript of the speeches and reso- lutions, and discovered that they were all in the same handwriting and that the paper was all embossed with one and the same stamp. Now, the ghost, it is said, that could do this must have been a very clever fellow. Who is the ghost ? Many surmises have been made. The odds, however, go in the direction of the National Association. Just a hint. On the next occasion the speeches should be type written. They will bo the easier read. They should be upon different kinds of paper, and written in different coloured ink. There is no use in ghosts and associations playing high unless they manage it in a way to remove all suspicion of their personality.
