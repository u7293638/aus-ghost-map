MR. BEST'S ORGAN RECITALS. The sixth of Mr W T Best's recitals upon the grand city organ was given last evening, and once again an enormous audience was attracted by the reputation of the famous organist and the acknowledged ment of the instrument on which his performances are now being given Mendelssohn's organ sonata in D major (No 6) was the first item of the well-selected programme The nobility of the opening ghost-like movement of course made itself felt, as also did the stirring vigour of the final Allegro con fine but it was the delicate " Andante" in B minor, with its Uno pedal obligate, that proved most moving and most enjoyable of the out of the programme the most important work was B Concerto in G major by Handel-one of the series for the modern popular millions of which the public is so largely indebted to Mr Best himself The work in question is in four movements, Laurie, Giaconnu Andante, and Fugue the alternations of orchestral and organ effects in these concertos render them more attractive to the ear, and is it is just in such matters that the great organist is especially effective, it need hardly be said that the offence was much enjoyed Mr. Frost's " Reverie Rtltglouse on themes by Adolphe Adams," would have been butter enjoyed had the themes themselves been more familiar to the masses, but the stirring '1 inform" for the trumpet stops, by the Chevalier Loinmens never fails to interest the audience, wherever heard Rossini's ' triumphal March," from "Le Bigge do Corinth," proved especially attractive, and a " Paste rule" in C, and "Grand Choeur" in G, by Theodore Scheme, were well set as the final items of the recital the pompous vigour of the last-named piece rendering it exceptionally effective as a conclusion The next recital will take place on Thursday afternoon, at 3 o'clock.
