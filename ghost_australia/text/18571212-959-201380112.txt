HOBART TOWN ANNIVERSARY REGATTA. This annual festival came off on Thursday, 3rd Decem- ber. The early morning was lowering, but the clouds par- tially cleared away as the day advanced. The Domain was crowded with citizens, and most of the shops in the city were closed, the streets being almost entirely de- sorted. The scene in the paddock was truly animating. The thousands who had gathered together to witness the sport ; the gay and fluttering pennons of the shipping ; and the hundreds of boats which dotted the surface of the water, all contributing to impart a holiday dress, which, save on such festivals as these, is never to be seen. Although the races were not so good as on many former occasions, we believe the public had no reason for complaining of any lack of amusement. His Excel lency arrived on the ground, accompanied by Lady Young, Lady Campbell, and many of the elite of the city, shortly after ten o'clock, and was escorted to the Grand Stand ; immediately after which the first start was made. The booths were well supplied with every refreshment; and the band of the 12th Regiment dis- coursed most exquisite music' at intervals during the day. No accident, that we have heard of, took place; and we believe that on returning towards their various abodes in the evening, the citizens had every reason to congratulate themselves upon a day passed in uninter- rupted enjoyment: FIRST RACE. DINGY RACE, net exceeding 18 foot, pulled by two youths under 16 years of age, and a steerer. To start from a boat moored off Macquarie Point, round a boat moored off Pavilion Point, and back to place of starting. First dingy £8, second ditto £5, third ditto £6 Hunter -Henry Harrison........,............ 1 Phantom-C. Bent...............................2 Secret— D. Barclay ...............................3 Seven boats started for this race. They went off well together, and maintained the contest with good spirit throughout. The prizes were delivered to the successful competitors by the Governor. SECOND RACE. Amateurs, pulling in four-oared whaleboats, for the Ladies' Purse. To be pulled by parties employed in public or private- offices, and mercantile assistants. To start from a boat moored off Pavilion Point, thence round a boat moored off Kangaroo Bluff, and back to place of starting. First boat to receive the Ladies' Purse, £20. Sylph— T.Ivey .......................................................................................................................1 Florence Nightingale— 11 Pitt............................................................................................. 2 Heather Bell — A. Bock................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................... 3 This was a well-contested race. At starting, Heather Bell went off with the load, but had soon to give way to Sylph and Florence Nightingale. The latter struggled hard to reach Pavilion Point first, but was unsuccessful, Sylph increasing the distance between herself and her competitor. At rounding the boat, Heather Bell was considerably in the rear, where she remained throughout the race. Aa they neared the boat moored off Kangaroo Bluff, Florence Nightingale picked up ground, which she again lost on rounding the boat, and enabled the Sylph to recover between the Bluff and the goal. Flo- rence Nightingale was no way disheartened, and put on extra speed, but to no purpose, Sylph was too far ahead to be outstripped at that point of the race, and went in. the winner after a well-contested struggle. THIRD RACE Native Youths' Race, for lads and apprentices not exceeding 18 years of age, pulling in four-cared whale- boats not exceeding 25 feet long. Same course as the race for the Ladies' Purse. First boat to receive £15, second ditto, £10; third ditto, £5. Faugh-a-Ballagh-. R.Purdy ... 1 Scamp-J. Wilkinson ... 2 Nightingale-J. Archer ... 3 Witch of the Wave-W. Bent ,,,4 Shamrock-II. Boon ... 5 Prince of Wales—Geo. Kenny .... 6 The prizes were not distributed, a protest having been sent in, on the ground of the crew of the Faugh -a-Ballagh being over age. FOURTH RACE. THE TASMAN PRIZE, for five-cared whaleboats; the same course as tbe race for the Ladies' Purse. First boat to receive £15 ; second do, £5. Columbine--.J. Hop wood.... 1 Calypso-McKay ... 2 FIFTH BACE. SAILING VESSELS of all descriptions. To take the same course as the race for the Tasman Prize. First boat to receive £20. Shannon, barge — Mark Webb ... 1 Pryde, barge- *- John Nichols ... 2 Connaught Ranger, barge-Cathcart ... 3 A capital start was effected, the vessels making a fair wind of it at first. In running down to the lower buoy boat the barges were ' all well together, but when the course was altered, and they commenced beating to windward, it became immediately apparent that the Shannon would be the successful competitor. Her powers for going to windward are evidently very great. The result was, as anticipated; her two rivals coming in a bad second and third. SIXTH RACE. SAILING BOATS, under three tons (time race). To take the same course as the Tasman Prize. First boat to receive £15 ; second do., £10 ; third do., £5. Blue Bell, schooner, water line 26 ft.' 6 in., beam 6 ft. 6 in. —A. M'Grcgor ? 1 Lady Young, schooner, water line 26 ft. 6 in., beam 6 ft. 6 in.— L. Young ? 2 The Lady Young reached the goal 27 miuuto3 : after the BIue Bell. SEVENTH RACE. AMATEURS' 'RACE, under 19 years of ago, pulling in four- oared whaleboats. To be pulled by parties in public or private offices, and mercantile assistants. To take the same course as the first race. First boat £15, second ditto £8. Heather Bell-T. Ivey ... 1 Little Innocent--E. Chapman ... 2 Isabella— George Kenny.... 3 Coquette-- J. Mall ... 4 Katty Darling--J. G. Splller... 5 Eight boats came to the line. Upon the gun being fired a most lively scene occurred. This squadron 0! little boats were almost instantly attired with canvas of different colours, size, and shape, and off they Started, en masse. Amid this little fleet was especially noticed a boat, built expressly for the occasion by Mr. McGregor. Nautical men were heard to pronounce it the most beau- tiful specimen of architecture ever built in this colony. From stem to stern, and from keel to mast head, hull, gear, and sails, were perfect models. No doubt to be entertained as to the result of the race, and the anticipations were realised. The wind unfortunately was very light, and consequently the race lasted some time. The first boat- came in twenty minutes before the second ; the rest wore nowhere. The Ariel at one time was looking up well for a good place at the finish, but was thrown out of the race by the accidental Ioss of her mast. Bioiirn baoe. Sailing Vessels of all descriptions. To tako the samo courae as tho race for tho Tasman Prize ; twice round. Firat boat to receive £15, second do to. , Ivanhoc ? ...(nasstlan) 1 Five vossols started for this raco, amongst which was tho old competitor of tho Svdnoy yacht—the Govornor Wilmot. Lately, however, the lvanhoe has been added to, 7 inches below and 6 above. This alteration bos evi dently increased hor Bailing powers. She went away with tho lead, and was never afterwards approached, leaving tho other competitors nowhero. Tho wind was very light and hauling during this race. Vessels going in different directions wero each carrying fair winds. At one moment they were bccalmod, at the next going free, and then almost immediately on a wind. At starting, tho yacht kept the Mocquarie Point shore well aboard, and by this means seemod to obtain an immonso advan tage. Nevertheless, wo doubt ?whether, even under tho most favourable circumstances, the Wilmot would stand the ghost of a chance with the Sydney stranger. WSTH RACE. . Amateubs and Native Youths, pulling in fouroarod whaloboats, not exceeding 25 feet long. To tako the same courso as the raco for the Ladies' Purse. First boat to receivo £15; second ditto, £10; third ditto, £5. ' ' Favourite ? (J. Bezetto) 1 FauKh-a-Ballaga , ? (J. llopwood) 2 Nlgbtlngal ? (K. Klsby) 3 A Buck Hunt wound up the sports.
