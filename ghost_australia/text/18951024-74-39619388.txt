FRENCH PIGEON HOMINGi Sixty thuusand birds released to fly to all parts of the country ! A curious sight was witnessed recently on the open grounds between the Point d' Lena and the fhon lineaux railway station, when no fewer than sixty thousand carrier pigeons were let loose. The course was organised by the Petit Journal, and was intended to show the vitality of the pigeon-breeding in dustry in France. The first start took place at four o'clock in the morning. In spite of the early hour a' considerable crowd had collected. The signal for re. leasing the first batch of pigeons was given by a cannon shot from the Eiffel Tower, and others followed in rapid succession. The President of the Republic was present at the start, and after a short speech 5000 pigeons belonging to the nboth-west, the west, and central regions were released. The coup d' oeil was extremely picturesque, the thousands of birds whirling round for some minutes in wide circles before stream ing off in very long columns towards their various destinations. Mother-'I sent you my photograph. Don't you think it is a good likeness?' Married Daughter-' Well, I should say it is. It is so life-like that when my hus band saw it he turned as pale as a ghost." Toacher-'Do you know why Robbie Jones is not at school?' Tommy-'Hes sick.' Teacher-' Are you sure?' Tommy -' Yes; I saw him sittin' at the window with his face clean and his hair combed.' Keep your temper, laddie. Never quarrel wi' an angry person, especially a woman. Mind ye, a soft answer's aye best. It's commanded-and, forbye, it makes them far madder than onything else ye could say.'
