R. E7 Ewing until Friday .morning. .The report of the home mission com mittee oh other subjects was adopted. A long discussion took place after' the reading of the re- 'port of the Sabbath observance committee. It was . proposed/in a resolution founded on the report, to.petition Parliament against running trains on the railways on: Sundays/ and the holding of Sun day church parades,' and the /using of railways and -omhibuscs by . ministers and members of ohnrches was absolutely , condemned. There was .ain .obvious' difference : of opinion amongst the members of the assembly on. the points named, the Rev.- W. Henderson, an' ex- moderator, being pfominent in asserting his right to preach when, where, and under what circumstances he' pleased, andjalso to Use public conveyances' on Sunday; but"" the resolution proposed by the committee was agreed to without a division. On Thursday, the Assembly adonted the report of .the ladies' college committee. . An appeal of the Rev.' I. 'Hethorington against a" , decision of the commission to lend £500 of the loan fund to : the assembly hall trustees occupied a great deal :of time in discussing.'. Eventually the appeal was dismissed. ' The report of the sustentation fund committee. was read and adopted, and it was re solved' to send .deputations to the larger presby- iteries to urge the claims of the fund.
