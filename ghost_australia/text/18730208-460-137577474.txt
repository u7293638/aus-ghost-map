Thackeray, Leech. Docglas Jerrold, Madise, StacfieH, Marryaa ard a good many where—he scarcely ere: wrote a letter to any one of them, tat con fined bis epistolary correspondence entirely to Mr. Foreter. Regarded from this pohit of view—that is to say, of the personal relations of Mr. John Forsterwith Dickens—this book is a very srac cessful one. Oneside, at least, of Dickens we see very distinctly. This second volume ez over the period between DM2 artd I85L, when Dickens was at the very height of fais genius, and at the pinnacle of his repu tation—before any of those wretched do mestic scandals had begun to disturb his peace and to damage his character. Mr. Fonster takes up bis work at the point of Dickens* return from America, which wa3 regarded as a relief by himself from an un congenial atmosphere. In spite of Dickens' FfifUf-al leanings, and the effusion with which be spoke in public of America and American institutions, it is obvious enough that to the last be disliked the country and the profile. He came away on his first visit disgusted and disapfidnted with the Americans ; and the best evidence of this is to Ire found in the original preface which lie wrote for the Aim rkan Kt/sji, and which Mr. Forater, for some inscrutable reason, petwuaided him to sup press. It sees the light now for the first time, and is certainly worthy of preserva tion ; and the following extracts are from it :— " fSTfcOJKCTOfc}', ASH SKCeHSARY TO feE KKAD.

" H is not statistical FigureH of arithmetic bare already been heaped upon America's devoted heaii, almost as lavishly as figures of speech have been ruled above Shakspeare's grave. " It comprehends no small talk concernini; individuals, and no violation of the socia confidences of private life. The very preva lent piactice of kidnapping live ladies and gentlemen, forcing them into cabinets, and labelling and ticketing fhetn, whether they win or no, for the gratification of the idle and the curious, is not to my taste. Therefore, I have avoided it. " It has not a grain of any political ingre dient in its whole composition. j " This book is simply what it claims to 1* j —a record of the impressions 1 received from , day to day during my hasty travels in Ame- ; rica, and sometimes (bntnot always) of the I conclusions to which they, and after recol- j lections of them, have lea me; a description of the country I passed through; of the in stitution* I visited; of the Mnd of people among whom ! journeyed; and of the man ners and customs that came within my own observation. Very many works having just the same scope and range have been already published, but! think that these two volumes stand in need of no apology on that account, WjeirMterestof such productions. if they have atty, fiat in the varying Impressions made by , the same novel things on different minds, and not in new discoveries or extraordinary adventnrat',. ! 44 But, venturing to dissent even from these filgh authorities, I formed my own opinion of ' its Value in the outset, and retain it to this hottrt and< in asserting (as I invariably did *' : occasions) my, liberty and free* „eh wpiie f was among the Amer in tnaintaining it at home, I be> ueye.

Chnzzletoe, Chazzleboy, Caubblewia, and Chnzzlewig. Dickens was always verr hapfy in LLs choice of names, and took great pains, as did another great novelist, Balzac, in their selection. Char zlewit we perceive at once'we cannot tell rriiri to he better than any of those dLscnsssed. The book was intended at first not to in dode any American scenes, hnt As howl of tage which was set vp on the other side of the Atlantic at the pictures, certainly not bv any means highly coloured, conveyed in" the American Aofe*, induced Dickens, bv way of answer to the chalie-x-e of his American | cntxcs, to return to the subject of America j The story excited the author, as usuah ! ver7 greatly, and he tooli a deep i>er- I sonal interest in the characters. After j he had written the first number " fae was socager to try the effect of Pecksniff and I Pinch that he came down (from a sick ! room) with the ink hardly dry on the last I slip to read the manuscript"—need we sav ^ to Mr. Foreter » Witli Mrs. Gamp, from the i moment of iter first conception, he always j declared that he "meant to make his mark." It is interesting to learn that the idea of this i immortal creature was not entirely original. I but that, like many of Dickens' best diame ters, she was drawn after a living model. • Foreter thus descrilies the genesis of the Gamp :— rjt rsL&!!i'n8 a, 01 r incnley as the midsummer mouths were > coming on, his introduction of Mrs, Ganin I and the uses to which he should annly that ! remarkable riersonage, first occurred to him. ' In his preface to the book he speaks of her : T tvlT ,reI,r«^ntat!oi., at the time it was published, of the lured attendant on the Poormsickness; but he might have added that the nch were no better off, for Mrs Gamps original was in reality a person hired' by a most distinguished friend of his own, a lady, to take charge of an invalid very dear to her; and the common habit of this nurse *{le ?,l.c* roorn, atnong other Gumpish pecullarities, was to rub her nose along the tha/firlf6 ta,,/e,"leJ- M'hether or not, on that first mention of her, I had any doubts ™bm*uCha diaracter could Ire made a '?!

In spite of its wonderful humour in quite a new vein, the popularity of Martin Ohuzzk wit, we are surprised to learn, was not equal t° that of its predecessors. 'Already the critics had begun to raise the ciy of declining powers and "written out," though Dickens had not yet produced his master. a1^8' *nl^'°tthe opening of the Manchester Athehanm, Dickens gave the first public proof of a new faculty,as a preacher upon the social problems of the dge. In this ye'ar wag published the Christmas Carol, that brightest and truest emanatiou of the author's genius, whidi raised.him immensely in the opinion of the world, showiiig him, to be as great a tnester oyer; tears as over .'hUigbieri Grea^: as was the popularity of theiGaro?, .however! rtdidnot yield somuchprofitas waSexpected ' "Wiw ."Ibi^n^nnici '-•* anticipations as tohis forte, y Now lw^n the Jret of, Aote monetary troubles^irbmSjhich to the.last he was never free.

I was obliged to lock myself in when I finished it yesterday, for my face was swollen tor the time to twice its proper size, and was hugely ridiculous. .... I am going for a long walk to clear my head. I feel that I am very shaky from work, and throw down my pen for the day. There! (that's where it fell).'' A few days afterwards he writes, Thank God ! I have finished 77te Chime?. Tltis moment I take np my pen to say only tliat much, and to add that I have had what the women call a * real good cry." " He made a horned visit to London on purpose to read his story to a select circle of friends, ond the scene is given in a capital sketch by Maclise, who was present Among the company were Carlyle, Stanfield, Douglas Jerrold, Laman Blanchard, Harness, Dyce, and 3Ir. Forster himself. On his return to Italy he visited some of the larger cities, but expressed his disappointment at most of them. He had no knowledge of and no-j taste for art, and the wonders of sculpture j and painting, which attracted all the world, 1 had no charms foTliim. Of Rome he says, I it was "no more my Route, degraded, and fallen, and lying asleep in the sun amidst a heap of ruins, than Lincoln's Inn Fields is." Naples he likened to a favourite pie-stye of his near Broadstairs. It was dull of raffish counts and more than doubtful countesses the noodles and the blacklegs of good society.' Venice struck him most, as rnav be seen from the Pictures of Italy. From the Albaro and the Genoa letters we might extract endless entertainment, i i here is a pleasant account of how he went ; to visit the theatre when Dumas's absurd i urama or ' Kean" was performed. The actors who represented the English players j of the period appeared in red steeple j crowned hats and very loose blouses, with I !!r,21ad belte and buckles round their waist. 1 here was a mysterious person called the I I rmce of Yar-Iees (Wales), the youngest and slimmest man in the company, whose Oauihage in Kean's dressirigrcom was irresistible : and the dresser wore top-boots, a great skull-cap, a black velvet jacket,, and leather breeches. One or two of the actors looked veiy hard at me to see how I was touched by these English peculiarities— especially when Kean kissed his male friends on both cheeks." . The Genoa summers Mould have been pleasanter but for fleas and mosquitoes ; for year of them Dickens declares that lie had to lie covered up with gauze, "like cold meat in a £ 18 ^t e, t€rrier, familiarly known as limter Doodle," was even a greater martyr. Dickens writes that " • Timber' has had every hair upon his liody cut off because of the fleas, and he looks like the ghost of a drowned dog come out of a pond after a | week or so. It is very awful to me to see liim I slide into a room. He knows the change ! upon lum, and is always turning round j and round to look for himself. I think lie I J!?i i • ^gl?.ef,f' Afow days later is the I followmg bulletin ^"'Timber's' hair is growing again, so thatyou can clearlyperceive ! ^ The fteas only keep three of ; msiegs off the ground now, and he some, v times mores of his omi accord towards some j place where they don't want to go." \ _YVe have received from Londdii Bmh ; mmye, Ijy " CapricornusJ' The es&ys; are-A ( 'L Facte about Australia ; EL Co-operative Settlement ;,and III.
