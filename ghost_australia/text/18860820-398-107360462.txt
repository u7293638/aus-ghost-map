THE FORSAKEN FARMHOUSE. i Against the wooded hills it stands, [ Ghost; of a dead homo, staring through j Its broken lights on wasted lands j Where old time harvests grew. Unplowed, unsown, by scythe unshorn, The poor forsaken farm-fi'-'lds lie, j Once rich and rife with golden com And pale green breadths of rye. Of healthful herb and flower bereft, I The garden plot no housewife keeps ; Through weeds aud tangle only left The snake, its tenant, creeps. A lilac spray, once blossom-clad, Sways bare before the empty rooms ; Beside the roofless porch a sad, Pathetic red rose blooms. His track, in mould of dust and drouth, On floor and hearth the squirrel leaves, And in the tireless chimney's mouth. His web the spider weaves. The leaning barn about to fall Resounds no more on husking eves; No cattle low in yard or stall, No thresher beats his sheaves. So sad, so drear I It seems almost Some haunting spirit makes its sign ; i That down yon shadowy l≠ some ghost I Might drive his spectral kine. —j, G. whittieb,
