TO TBE EDITOR. Sir,—All who value Church order will fervently trust that " Riverina Churebman's " suggestion will not be complied with. That such a course Bhouid be for a moment contemplated passes ordinary comprehension. Seiting aside the question of expense—which to a struggling diocese would be considerable—what possible benefit could compensate for such an act of disloyalty and schism ? On this point I would like to ask three simple questions:— 1\. Would the Bishop-elect consent to be sent to England to tike an oath of allegiance to a foreign Primate, while owing'legitmate obedience to the Primate of Australia and Tasmania. 2\. Would the General Synod of Australia and Tasmania suffer one of its members to swear fealty to a foreign power while professing to be loyal to bis own metropolitan and Primate holding eqnsl authority by ali cotholic usage. 3\. Whet would be a».id of a private individual who for the sake of retaining an endowment— whether 10,000 pounds or 10,000 pence—was content to take a fictitious oath of canonical obedience to an authority who bad not the ghost of a claim to that obedience, and who could not exact it without detracting frnm the legitimate authority of a brother Primate who had every claim ? I am, &c.;, February 20. EDWARD SYMONDS.
