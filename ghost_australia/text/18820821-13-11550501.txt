MONDAY, AUGUST 21, 1882. The elections for the reformed Legislative Council are now rapidly drawing nigh The occasion is one of the greatest interest, and also of the greatest importance, which has occurred in our history It specially concerns the constitutional party, for in November we shall have such a Council as constitutionalists have striven for The dividing line between them and the radicals for years past has been the question whether the Council should be a mere body of registration, placed under restraint with no force behind it, or an efficient and untrammelled House, bold with the knowledge that most of the best elements of the colony are behind it The free and strong Council has been established If the new Chamber obtains in comparison with the Assembly the same eloquence and the same ability as the House of Lords possesses in comparison with the Commons, it must be much more than the House of Lords, because it will be strongly representative instead of being merely hereditary There is no reason why it should not achieve such a position as that secured by the Senate in the United States The Senate is the ruling body, not because of any superiority of functions guaranteed by law, but because its peru fence and its constitution attract able men to its ranks, and make it something more than the embodiment of some popular passion or prejudice of the hour The Council, as the firm House, and with the settled interests of the colony committed to its charge, may win the same heights The first elections are the most important of all, as they will necessarily do much to give tone and character to the House and on the other hand, they will be the most difficult to manage and to arrange for. The constituencies are new constituencies ; the provinces are new ; the machinery is new and we must expect stiffness in working. Candidates may hesitate about coming forward, and electors may scarcely know to whom to apply. Thus it is necessary that the working politicians who have laboured hard and with intelligence since 1877 in order to buttress our institutions with a stable Council should continue a little further their exertions. The constitutional committees of the Assembly in their respective districts practically represent the new electors, and it might be well for their chairmen to call them together, with a view to organisation and joint action, and in order that the vote may be concentrated upon one candidate, and that candidate the best man who can be obtained. We believe that it is possible to obtain a victory all down the line, and the moral effect of thus demonstrating that the householders of Victoria are a law-abiding and orderly people, who look with disapprobation on class strife, attacks on capital, and violent tactics, would be immense. A new Assembly will be elected next year. That Assembly may be as ignorant and as violent as the House of the 11th May, but with a united and high class Council in existence, it would recognise the uselessness of attempting to repeat the career of 1877. And it is a return of the Black Wednesday terror that property-holders have to guard against. They can do so now by the election of a Council which will be above faction on the one hand, and which, however amenable to reason, can never submit to the vulgar coercion of the past on the other. The electors, we believe, will do their duty. In the con- stituencies we have every confidence, What is to be desired is that suitable candidates should declare themselves, and that at an early date, for if the proper men do not come forward, then men of an improper class will be apt to rush in There are indications already of the appearance upon the scene of candidates whose nomination tends to make the Council look ridiculous, whereas, if good names are officially men tioned, opposition is at once deterred. In the meantime we advise electors to make no premature promises of support It has been the misfortune of the constitutional party hitherto that it could not tempt many of its best representatives to take part in public life The men themselves shrink from enter- ing an arena where they must patter with economic doctrine, and must deal tenderly with crazes, and must run the gauntlet of the boy hero meetings But the situation is different now The new constituencies, however they may determine will be courteous, and will listen to both sides Rowdyism will have no place amongst them, and the liberal doctrine of freedom for commerce, free dom for the producer, freedom for the labourer, will be no disqualification in their eyes. The misfortune will be severe if the opportunity is neglected, and if men of tried worth, who are held in high esteem by their fellow citizens, should fail to come forward The old Council was called by its critics a Council of fossils Any warrant for the sneer has rapidly been passing away, and recent elections in town and country have resulted in the return of members who are almost all that could be desired "We want more of those citizens who are taking an active part in the battle of life, and are familiar in the busy haunts of man The Mayors of Melbourne have of late displayed ability and character The various exhibitions have brought capable men to the front The presidents of the Chamber of Commerce have done well It is for citizens of their class-a class which has hitherto stood far too much aloof from the Assembly for whom the opening now exists Such men, we trust, will be divorced from politics no longer We may remind them of their duty to a land which has repaid them well for their private industry and zeal " Our " country," says a great Roman, " has " not given us birth nor educated as " under her law as if she expected no Bui,! Cr: from me, or that, seLiuub to " administer to our convenience only, " she might afford a safe retreat for the " indulgence of our case, or a peaceful " asylum for our indolence " So it is here Victoria requires that the men who are building up their own fortunes should unselfishly assist in preserving the state In accordance with our promise, We' shall now proceed to indicate how clause 3 of Mr ] i M b Railway Bill should be remodelled in order to make the measure subservient to national, as distinguished from merely local interests We have already said that as the funds available are limited, alterations must be confined to a redistribution of expenditure The first thing we propose is to strike out all suburban lines that are not required for the legitimate accommodation of the public The Assembly has refused to sanction the Albert p iron to Elwood railway principally on the ground that the localities through which it would run are sufficiently well served atpresentinotherways If thatisthecase now, their wants will be more than met for years to come by the tramways, which will certainly be provided in some way or other before long On the same grounds the line to Picnic Point might well be omitted Very likely this short extension would pay, but it is not really needed Excursionists who go to spend the day by the sea are not, as a rule, in a desperate hurry to reach a given spot They are content to stroll along, bearing their commissariat stores with them, ready to camp in the first spot that takes their fancy The whole of the beach from P rishton station to the Point is occupied on festal occasions by holiday makers, and they do not want to have a locomotive battling pass them all day-smoking aid shrieking, and hissing, and making parents anxious about stray children in order that, when they wish to proceed to the end of the camping ground, they may be able to save half an hour in reaching their destination Another line not wanted is that from Fitzroy to Collingwood Anything more ridiculous than this proposal is almost beyond conception Nothing but the obligation which Mr BENT took upon himself of proposing a railway in every electoral district could ever have in duced him to suggest such an absurdity The line would start from near the junction of Brunswick-street and the Northcote road, and run due east until it joined the Alphington Railway about Hoddle street A traveller who could saunter from the starting point to the Flinders street terminus in about half an hour, or traverse the distance in far less time by omnibus, would be taken a long journey round by Collingwood and East Richmond if he would go by the train. The proposal is almost an insult to a deliberative Assembly The track from North Sandridge to the mouth of the Yarra is not wanted at present, and should also go out of the bill It is supported on the ground that it would carry the bluestone of Williamstown to the south eastern suburbs, and would assist in the work of reclaiming Crown lands The reply to these representations is that Williamstown bluestone now finds its way to the districts mentioned by means of water carriage across the bay, and that low lying lands are being filled up now with sufficient speed in connexion with the operations of the Melbourne Harbour Trust Our second method of providing funds for expenditure in the country districts is to strike out all suburban lines that are not likely to pay Amongst these we place the line from Clifton hill to the Royal park There is no local traffic between these places to give interest and working expenses on what must necessarily be an expensive line But we shall be told that it forms part of the " outer circle," and is needed to put the south, eastern system and the Whittlesea line into communication with Spencer-street with out passage through the Flinders street station Inpassmg,wer_aypointo_t that the Whittlesea line might go direct from Preston to the Royal park Taking the outer circle as a whole, we have no hesitation in saying that, while money is needed for other purposes, it ought not to be commenced. There is no justification at present for construct- ing either that portion of the circuit which lies between Clifton hill and Brunswick, or that between Camberwell and Murrumbeena The line from Camberwell is not at present in the bill, but the Premier has promised to introduce it. We believe that all that is said about the necessity of relieving the traffic on the Gipps Land line between Melbourne and Oakleigh, now that a double track has been laid, in some thing worse than nonsense The port manent officers of the department no doubt wish to have every convenience, so that the traffic may be conducted with the least possible trouble and no sponsibility to themselves, and the Minister seizes on their representations as an excuse for making lines which will not stand upon their own merits Tho whole of the Gipps Land travel together is a mere drop in the ocean as compared with the business done by many European and American railways the perpetual cry about relieving tins in c and that from the few trains that run daily is a farce It springs, we imagine, from official indolence on the one hand, and the desire of the Minister to placate political support on the other the object of a competent traffic manager would be to find more work for existing lines not to divert the little that presents itself into other channels At the same time, we are ready to admit that at some future day fifty years hence it maybe-the outer circle railway will probably be needed If, therefore, it should be thought advisable to lay out a reasonable sum of money in purchasing land along the route while it can be secured at a reasonable rate, we should offer no objection It might be let on terms which would admit of its being taken possession of when wanted, and the rental would pay the interest on the cost There is one other suburban line that should be rejected, on the ground that it would not pay, viz that from Picnic station to Glen Iris, and on to a point on the line from Camberwell to Murrumbeena It is impossible to deny that the country along the valley of the Gardiner's Creek is very beautiful, and no doubt it will some day be covered with vine residences At present, however, these residences are mostly the hubbub The line would be a convenience to those who live in the neighbourhood, and would greatly increase the value of property But until there is sufficient population to make a railway pay from the first, the district should wait Unless under very exceptional circumstances, no suburban lines should be constructed which would not be undertaken by private enterprise if opportunity were afforded The railway under notice would not be quite such a land jobbers' line as that which Mr BEST intended to lay down between Picnic Point and Cheltenham, but it would differ only in degree The one suburban line which we think should be made is that from Alphington to Upper Heidelberg It was intended to carry it that length is the first instance, and nothing but want of funds made Alphington the objective point for a time It must be remembered, moreover, that the Heidelberg line is the commencement of a railway to a distinct part of the country, the obvious extension bears towards Eltham and the district beyond With regard to the Kew line, we entertain some doubt As, however, there is a large and growing population there, and there seems no probability of tramway communication in the immediate future, we think that the one mile of construction asked for might be conceded The two lines that would be made, if our suggestions were adopted, are estimated to cover 32 miles, and would cost at schedule prices, £25,000 Take this from the total amount put down for suburban lines (£145,800), and we have a sum of £120,800 set free for national purposes We trust that the Assembly in consenting to hear counsel at the brim of the House for the Melbourne Harbour Trust commissioners, meant to in time that it now intends to deal with the amending bill in a practical was the manner in which this impor- tat t measure has been treated hitherto is a disgrace to the popular branch of the Leys! nature As most of our readers know Some slight technical doubt was cast upon the legality of the Trust proceedings by an immaterial flaw in its original constitution The commissioners have been ailing for years to have this defect remedied by an act validating their past actions and assuring their future position As Parliament has charged the Trust with certain duties surely powers Bli old he non to the latter body which cannot be called in question The commissioners moreover desire to obtain possession of the land and the borrowing powers which are essential to the prosecution of the works necessary for the improvement of the port Of course they have no personal interest in the matter They can go on tory comfortably as they are but having undertaken a given task they are properly anxious to carry it out it been the Amending Bill was before a select committee, a combination of suburban representatives and office seeking politicians managed to carry a series of recommendations entirely altering its character If the proposed amendments were to be adopted, the corporation would be a trust for every other place except Melbourne, while the commissioners, instead of being more chosen for their known fitness by individuals and bodies directly interested, would be persons skilled in the art of popularity hunting nominated by the majority of an electoral body without special knowledge or sense of responsibility In fact, the suggestions of the select committee would differentiate the Melbourne Harbour Trust from every body formed for similar purposes under the sun The Tn st would be false to the interests confided to its charge if it consented to promote such radical changes in its constitution Even if it were to favour the changes, there would be very little prospect of their being accomplished, as without doubt the Upper House would Scout such destructive proposals Hat ing regard to the political situation, the commissioners now ask that organic questions shall be postponed to a more convenient season, that past proceedings shall be technically validated, and that the Trust shall be placed in a position to fulfil the objects for which it was created More moderate and business Uko requests it would be impossible to conceit o, and we trust that the signs of impatience with which Mr LOOIIOEB S factious remarks were received on Wednesday afternoon, are indications that the House in weary of the obstructive tactics hitherto successfully practised Popular institutions are discredited by the fact that such a work as the improvement of the port of Melbourne is almost at a standstill because a few members wish to strengthen their hold upon suburban constituencies, and others desire to throw open certain commissionership to trading politicians The desirability of cultivating wattle trees on the lands enclosed between the railway fences was discussed in the Assembly on Thursday evening, when a vote of £1,000 for the purpose was under discussion KcuaoiiB were advanced to show that the planting of wattles in the enclosures would prove advantageous to the tanning industry as well as remunerative to the Govern- ment On the other hand, Mr WILLIAM Uoni loses opposed the project, on the ground that wattle plant i tions of the kind referred to would become harbours for rabbits Mr BUOIKV expressed the conviction that such plantations would augment the risk of fire from an engine spark In the dry season the grass between the trees would be liable to take fire, and thus destroy the wattles m well as extend the fire beyond the railway fences Sir CHARLES MACMAHON feared that the planting of wattles would prove a post since the seeds would in case of storm be scattered far and wide, thus constituting a nuisance to landholders near the r ill way lines The majority of the speakers, i however, were decidedly in favour of the Government project One aspect of the question, however, was not alluded to in the debate, but it cannot be safely over looked the idea of wattle planting was urged on the Government several years ago, and it would then have been adopted had it not been for the firmly expressed opinion of Mr. THOMAS HIGINBOTHAM, then engineer in chief, that the safety of railway travelling would be impaired by the growth. He pointed out that wattles grow with great rapidity, and that in a short time they would obstruct the view of the line to the engine driver, especially where the line was at all curved They would also, in his opinion, obstruct the view of signals and bags, and for this reason he was entirely opposed to the project. Before, therefore, the House commits itself to the wattle planting experiment, it would be worth while to ascertain the opinion of the engineer in chief and his subordinates on the subject It is pointed out that it will be difficult to see a green flag on a green back-ground, and that in some curves, if wattles are growing, it will be impossible to see any flag at all Sir BRYAN O'LOGHLEN proposed to take the question of national wattle culture into consideration in connexion with the new Land Bill, and possibly prudence would suggest that this is the best course to pursue The RMSS Clyde, after a quick run from Colombo, arrived in the bay shortly after 4 o'clock yesterday afternoon, with the mails from England and the East Her dates of English papers are to the 11th uU and these and the mails have been landed within 37 days from London 'lheCI>de had a fine weather passage all the way from London, and did some fast steaming on the way out The mails were contained in 341 bags and packages, of which 143 bags were for Melbourne, 33 for Geelong, 03 for Kew .Zealand,3G for Tasmania, 41 for Sydney 12 for Queensland, and eight for Noumea There were also two bags for the naval squadron The mails for Tasmania were transhipped at the Heads, and those for Sydney were to leave by train this morning. The New Zealand portion will be taken on Wednesday by the s s Arawata The situation in Egypt has undergone a slight change The naval and military force deal altered from Alexandria to attack Aboukir was diverted from its original destination, and a descent was made upon Port Said. The natives were disarmed, and the place was taken possession of Tina work having been completed, the attack on Aboukir will, it is expected, take place shortly There has been some skirmishing with Arabi s out j posts near the Mahrnudyieh Canal, but nothing important has yet occurred The principal business in the Legislative As- sembly this week will be the Railway Con- struction Bill A vote will be taken as early as possible on The 5th clause of the measure which related to the erection of workshops the connexion between Spencer-street and flin ders street stations and incidentally to the plans for a central passenger station The remaining clauses of the bill will then be proceeded with, and afterwards the third clause will be recommitted to enable the House to reconsider subsections, which were merely passed pro forma The Government intend to ask the Assembly to assent to certain grants being made to water trusts, on terms previously explained to the House The conference between the Legislative Council and the Legislative Assembly on the Licensees Qualifying Bill will be held at half-past 7 o clock to morrow evening, in the south library of the Houses of Parliament In its original form the bill provided for the enrolment of licensees under the Land Act rated at 225 and upwards When the measure reached the Council a new clause was in suited to model a proviso in the Reform Act of 1881, which was calculated to prevent the enrolment of another class of voters, viz , joint owners Clause 21 confers votes upon joint owners but at the end occur the following words provided that the names of the persons so entitled to vote shall appear in the rate book Now occupying joint owners cannot appear in the rate book On the motion of Sir Charles Sladen the proviso was altered (by the Licensees Qualifying Bill!) so as to run thus - Provided that the names of all persons claiming to vote as rate paying electors shall appear on the rate book The question at issue is almost purely technical, though the Opposition in the Assembly object to fair Charles Sladen a amendment from a wish to put a check on plural voting It is not certain that the proviso in its amended form will cure the defect which has been discovered, nor on the other hand, are constitutional authorities agreed as to what the effect of the proviso will be if it is allowed to stand unaltered As it takes away many votes which the dance was expressly designed to confer, Borne authorities doubt whether the proviso can possess any validity Without such a restriction as is imposed by the original proviso, the clause would simply continue the practice which has been in operation since the introduction of the existing electoral system Both Houses will suspend their proceedings during the sitting of the conference, which may possibly last for two hours The Conn- on will be represented by Sir Charles Sladen, Dr Dobson, Dr Hearn, Messrs MacBain Anderson, Jenner, Balfour, Lorimer, and Fitzgerald The representatives appointed by the Assembly are Mr Bent, Mr Deakin, Mr. Francis, Mr Gillies, Mr Kerferd, Sir Bryan O'Loghlen Sir John O Shanassy, Mr. Pearson, and Mr Wrixon The Treasurer has received very satisfactory reports of the progress of the for sea now works All the guns in the Queenscliff battery have been mounted, and as quickly as possible those Swan Island are being placed in position On Wednesday next tenders will he opened for the erection of the battery at Point Nepean, and that work will be proceeded with without de- "'J' A difficulty is likely to arise in connexion with this fort in consequence M the absence of any supply of water.

In the case of the Canadians, who have forwarded an address to the Queen urging that the principle of Home Rule, as advocated by Mr. Parnell and his party, should he carried out in Ireland, we learn that an important correspondence has since taken place on the subject between He Majesty s Government and the Government of Canada, and that the former have eJ preceed emphatic disapproval of the conduct of the Dominion authorities The Victorian address, which as Mr Patterson very truly remarked in the House of Assembly, is full of ' seditious and treasonable language has, fortunately, no come under the notice of the Crown, it having been sent to the Lord Mayor of Dublin is this address the Irish, are referred to as an oppressed people, under the hoof of a foreign devotion. Such language as this comes, from the Queen s subjects in her distant possessions can only serve to inflame the passions of the Irish race, and incite them to further rebellion We are glad to find when the car ject was brought before the Victorian Assembly), that Sir John O Shanassy gave some very sensible advice to his countrymen It is, as he was, their duty as colonists to stand aloof from matters in which they can exercise no practical power, and we may add that certainly the very last thing they should do is to attempt to harass the Imperial Government in their endeavour to restore law and order amongst a dissatisfied section of: the United kingdom At a meeting of the Victorian Football As sociation, held at Messrs. Young and Jack Bona Hotel on Friday evening, the dispute between players of the Carlton one Hotham clubs, which took place on the previous Saturday, and during which blows were struck, was considered The association decided to disqualify the offending players. Coulthard of Carlton, and Tankard of Hotham, for the remainder of the season, This decision has occasioned some strong feeling among the members of the two clubs interested The Carlton players have manifested great opposition to the enforce- ment of the decision On Saturday last, they declined to play the match against Melbourne without Coulthard, and as the Melbourne club did not feel justified in permitting him to play, the match did not take place.
