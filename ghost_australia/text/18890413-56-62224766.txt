How to Treat Stammerers. I wish to show parents and guardians what a dreadful thing to a high-spirited and nm bitiomboy stammering is. I say emphati cally, if taken iu it.s earliest staires, it can be (.?ll'eolually checked. People aro apt to imagine that it. is ii thing of Miiall moment, and a defect which tho b'jy will ' |*ro\v out of.' Fathers, I tell you plainly that, tri lling as it. may appear to you, it is u matter of terrible impiruiuco to the lad's future wel fare, comfort, and happine.su. In somo odd eases, undoubtedly, sulfcrers do ' grow out of it ;' but in the great majority it grows upon them till thoy biXMiua confirmed stammerers, and their whole life is overshadowed by a dark cloud. A few words to tho general public as to their treatment of sfammerors or stu.t.icw Mauykiiid-h-rri' e:lincn nud women endeavour to help tho sutferer by saying tho word which they iuuigiuo ho is striving to utter. Friends, don't do this. In the urn jority of cases you will get hold of tho wrong word, and mako his confusion worso confounded. And apart from this, it is ox tremely galling to him to bo dependent on other pooplo in this way. If you wish to earn his gratitudo and respect, endeavour to listen to him as if you had not noticed any thing peculiar iu his speech. Never laugh at a stammerer. If you could for onco put yourself in his placoand feel the uuuttorable humiliation which ho experiences, you would never again let tho ghost of a siuilo cross your faco when lalking loono. AVhon I have gone into shops or ojlices and, whilst striving hard to mako inysolf intelligible, havo seen tho clerks or assistants grinning us though they (bought it lino fun, it; has Kometinies been very difficult to restrain myself .. from 1 going for them' and administering a salu tary lesson.â€” l'fum Cuwll's FumMy Maijuzbic fur February.
