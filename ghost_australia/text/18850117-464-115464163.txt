THE KIAMA GHOST. ('TO THE 'rcnTTrvn. ^ _ Sir, — As some of your readers are anxious to hear something of the history of the ' Kiania Ghost,' I will try and o-ive the desired informa tion as truthfully as possible. Before reaching the point where this Ghost was brought upon tho scene by the then Mr. Henry Parkos, noAV. Sir Henry Parkos, I will have to tread over some very rough ground, and call to remembrance trying times and desperate efforts made to ruin every man who maintained the position of an un compromising patriotic Irishman, no matter what his position or creod. _ in March, 1808, the Duke of Edinburgh arrived m Sydney, and for a month previous to his arrival, a portion of the Prose in Sydney was very industrious in spreading- all sorts of 'villainous rumours respecting Fenians being in largo num bers m Noav- South Wales ; and Mr. Parkes at Kiama, as reported by tho Hkbald's telegrams, stated :-— ' Fivo hundred persons were sworn in as special constables, as a guard appointed to ride in a lino Avith the body of the Duke, when he first landed on thoso shores.' Such conduct as this caused tho people all through tho country to look upon oach other Avith suspicion ; Grange societies were brought into existonce, and the upshot Avas that ono class of tho community was set against tho other by a lot of designing ruffians.
