Moreover, although nothing had come of the loan or ?loans of which the Duke had vaguely hinted, was not the Finance Minister of France an important personage to know ?

'History tells us, howeveri 'that a^ patient reader of 'Gulliver's Travels' : was at last heard to, say l with an air of conviction^ that he did not believe one word of. what he had bejen reading ; and so, at length it occurred to MivOrant that there was some uncertainty about M Natal'fl narratives. ;- The Scotch merchant ivehtured to write to M. Barthelemy St. Hiliare, and was informed. thatM:. ^ Tliera knew nothing whatever about the gentle man who had been negotiating important business ? for him in the remote ends of ?Hie earthr. ; Moreover, Mr. Grant now be thought him of consulting the list of mem bers of the National Assembly at Versailles, in which' M. ]Natal had incautiously said his native .would be found... His name was not found, ;On the contrary, circum stances iarose toshow that there^ was no such name^and- that the Due de Bal$n had no more solid existence on this earth than the ghost of= Hamlet's father. But the rpersonator-of the Duke had so muchreality about him as to let thq^law, to use: a common expression, lay him, ...by the Tieek j and in spite of his :aB&everations; he was condemned to three years' ?im- prisonment,, to. a. fine, of 3,000 francs, and ordered to pay 30,000 francs indem nity to Mr. McTaggatt Grant. Which are we to think the greater — the audacity of this bold and ingenious swindler, or the exceeding simplicity of his victim ? --
