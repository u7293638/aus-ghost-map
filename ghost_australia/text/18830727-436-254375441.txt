A TALE 1 . For four generations there has been a mystery at Glamis Castle which no one has ever been able to fathom (writes an English paper). Some said it was a ghost, others a mysteriously hidden treasure; but rumors of a more or less uncauuy nature floated round the country, and have done so for about ninty- three years. Four Earls of Strathmore have seated themselves in ancestral state at Westminister, and yet all the while the real Earl, the eldest of the family was alive, hidden in the vast old feudal palace at Glamis. He died only last year, aged 92 years, and he was a monster. He stood eight feet in height. His head and the upper part of his body resembled that of a toad. His skin was marked with black and white splotches, and his hands were webbed. He could not speak or hear, but his eyes were bright but wild. He never showed "signs of reason, and in order to avoid legal difficulties and painful revelations, this horror was hidden in a building erected on purpose. His gaolers were paid handsome annuities to keep silent. As each Earl succeeded to the estate he was taken to see this terrific creature, and it is said that one of these gentlemen almost lost his reason in beholding the loathsome and gigantic horror. Last year the poor wretch died, and his secret has come out, owing to difficulties concerning the disposal of hiB remains. The most extraordinary part of it all is that the whereabouts of the monster Earl was kept so wonderfully quiet and also that he lived to 6uch an advanced age. Glamis Castle is the one referred to in Macbeth. Tint musical boxes, playing one tune very faintly, are now suspended to the waist bells of trans-Atlantic belles. These melodious trinkets usually contain hairpins, clove Ibuttonera, and other minot adjuncts of.-lh0 I 'femininfe toilette.
