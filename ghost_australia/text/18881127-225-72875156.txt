It was then that I tsw Imy fatlher approaching, leading this unsts by the armn. Htse proceeded to introdie?U himt1 to le as 3Ir. Anthtony Black. From the eourtesy with which miiy fatcher treated Mr. Black I saw that lie evidently liked him very much. This :;erplexed tme, as I thought I had never, in all i my life, tiet any one so strangely repulsive, and it was with much dis pleasure that I heard my father urging intia to come often to see us. iHe was not slow in availing himself of this invitation, aid succeeding days saw him frequently at our houso, My fathelr' interest in thie mtai lay it the fact that lihe, ioo, was a student its hidden lore, and together they pursued this strange suc Black had not visited. us- many tines before I fancied I saw' a change in my father. lie g-re: silent and moody, and seemied to be wandering-in-the-clouds most of the tilnm.. As for toe, the anore I saw of our vititor the mioref I ?re to disli.e and distrust hissn, and a feeling of impending evil came over ile. One evening my father invited him to dine with us. Ah, that hour! I can never forget it. The man wore a cotn tinual smile, which seemed to hide somel-. thing terrible behind it, and his lit:le black eyes glittered. 1 tried to avoid looking at him, but was soon conscious of a strange fascinationl which kept my eyes fastened on himn. f felt as if I must obey him, and my father seemed equally fascinated; for lie hung on every word tile strange man uttered. That awfiul, awful dinner ! It makes nte shudder now when I think of it. At times I would make an almost Euper huinan effort to remove lny eyes fromis Black's fice, and then solne horrible power slowly drew them back. But at last the meal was ended, amnd I escaped to my room. Nanny, nly old nurse, was waiting for me there, and as I entered, she ex claimed: " Lair. Mliss Addie,whlat do matter wid you, chile ? You look as dough you doune seell a ghost." "Oh1, anny,"I? said, " llam suresonle thing dreadful is going to happen ! 1 feel it-I see it !" "Blrcs de chile!" said Nanny. "Nuffen dreliul can't happmen to yo' while olo Nanuny's around to take care ob you ! Dun' bodder yo' head 'bout dat no' mu', honey." " Nanny," said I, '" the next time that MIr. Black comes here, I want you to try and see him, and then tell me what you think of him." Nanlny's opportunity came soon. for in a couple of days tlhe man was there again, and she happened to let hims in.' She caule running upstairs, and burst in upon I see him ! I see hint ! Lor.

What for ole inarse want to bring such a ting as d at heah i Sil 's I stla' htsah, Miss Addie, I tinki wl:en I see him dat de'osc bay conle to call." %lan,-'s opinion convinced 1me that there realldy ias something fearful about Ir. Black. A inameles terror took possession of ime, alld.though I tried to shake off the feeling, gloom pervaded crerything.- . Iite continued to come freqluently to. tile louse, and I wais ofteil, atimy father's request, conpelled to see him; but I ueverr did so witilhout feeling conscious that .1 was entirely subject to: his will. One day my father sent. for ite tou conmc. to the library. ' The -ulnuaons I used Id obey so gladly lilled lle with dread, and: I cltetred with fear 'and trembling.

"W\hatt dey been a loin' now to bring d gicf to liy 1pure chile I" "Oth, Nannly," said 1, "Iie wants to marry 1ie to him."' " Marry you to wnh", honey ?" "T'ro Mr. Itlack. U Nanlny, Naunny!

Tile stransge part of it was that my mnind remlainled ,perfectly clear, anld I knewc everything I did, ialthough I had 1no plower to control myself. toe day, after amn exhibition of tl1is kind, I saw with terror mny father's startled face; llack's tiendish counten anee.
