Stockholm's Haunted Palace. The Stockholm correspondent of the Independent Beige tells this ghost story : For a long time it has been no secret that spirits haunt the royal palace in Stockholm. Years ago the king became so thoroughly convinced of the presence of ghosts that he hod the big wing most frequented by them torn down and rebuilt. But the ghosts did not disappear when the alteration was made, and they still carry on their nightly carousals. A month ago the Danish Crown Prince and his wife, while visiting the Stockholm court, lived in the haunted palace. On the first night there was an extraordinary manifestation. A chamberlain was lifted from his bed by invisible hands and was laid on a table at the end of a bedroom farthest from the bed. On the fol- lowing morning Prince Johann asked him if he had heard the uproar in his room. On the evening of the same day the Princess Louise was writing in a room brilliantly lighted. Suddenly a woman appeared and began extinguishing the lights. The Princess Louise, who is celebrated for her courage, tried to lay hands on the woman, I but tha latter vanished as suddenly as she appeared. Prince Christian, the eldest son [ of the crown prince, wished late one after- noon to fetch something from a dimly lighted i room He left hi3 father and mother, only to re- turn a few moments later empty-handed, white and | trembling. He said that he had found the room filled with strange figures, which barred his way and made threatening gestures. The day before his departure the Danish crown prince was playing, carde with the Crown Prince of Sweden, when Prince Gustav, turning white with fear, exclaimed that a giant was behind Prince Johann's chair, looking at his cards. Both princes sprang to their feet and the giant disappeared. Nobody in the Swedish royal family doubts the presence of the ghosts, but the subject of their appearance is tabooed at court.
