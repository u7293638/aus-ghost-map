HORRID MURDER CORONER'S INQUEST. — In our Sa- turday's number we gave an account of some human remains being found on the Thursday preceding near the North Head, and the particulars subsequently ob- tained afford but too much reason to infer that the unfortunate individual met his death by violence. On the affair being communicated to the Police, an active Conductor, named O'Mears, and another constable, were despatched to the spot with a shell, having orders to bring up the body therein, and make every enquiry that might tend to the elucida- tion of the mystery in which the affair was enveloped. They accordingly took a boat, proceeded to the place, which is an almost inaccessible scrub, situ- ated not far from Manly Beach, and a place such as few persons would think of entering unless for some specific object; here they discovered the object of their search, together with the articles of dress, enumerated in our former report, and also a horse- pistol, all of which they brought up to Sydney, and left at the Kings-Head Inn, in Harrington-street, where, at twelve o'clock on Monday, an Inquest was hold by Major Smeathman, and an unusually intelligent jury ; W. Williams, Esq. Foreman. To the lock of the pistol was attached some human hair, and a spot of blood was also visible on the but. Mr. W. with great care succeeded in placing together the mutilated relics of a piece of paper found in one of the pockets, on which was distinctly traced the name Patrick Duffey; nothing else was in the pocket; the fob had evidently been cut off with a knife, and the silk stock had apparently been per- forated by a pistol ball. O'Mears was examined as to the particulars of his expedition, and stated that, by way of making enquiries, he went to the habi- tation of a small settler named Whealley, situate about half a mile from the spot, and on asking for that person was informed by his brother, a lad about eleven years of age, that neither his brother nor the government man were then at home, but he expected them every minute. They waited for above three hours, during which neither appeared, and in the mean time, took the opportunity of interrogating the boy. O'Meara first enquired of him whether he had seen any bushrangers that way lately, to which he replied in the negative; adding, however, that his brother was afraid to be out late at night, for fear of the ghost of the murdered man. Upon being asked where he was murdered, he described the very place at which they found the unfortunate victim. Upon further questions being put, he seemed to re- gain his recollection, and shifted his story, saying it was the drowned fisherman that was buried at Manly Beach he was afraid of. — Under these circum- stances, the jury suggested to the Coroner the pro- priety of adjourning till the following day, and that, in the mean time, he should issue his warrant to in- sure the attendance of the above three persons. This was assented to, and at eleven o'clock-on Tuesday they re-assembled, when the boy was first brought forward and closely examined. He now denied his former statement, and prevaricated greatly ; he acknowledged that his brother formerly possessed a horse-pistol, and the description he gave of it corresponded with the one now found. Being asked what his brother had done with it, he replied that he had brought it to Sydney to his father four months back ; but in a subsequent part of his examination, said he brought it to a veteran. He did not know Patrick Duffey, he said, but heard his brother speak of him as a good Kangarooer. — Snell, the government man to Whealley, was next examined ; he denied any knowledge of Duffey ; said he had never seen him at his master's house ; and that his master never had any sword or pistol (although the constable had previously deposed to finding a sword hanging in the room). He admitted that some time since his master brought home a watch with a steel chain. Being unable to elicit any thing further at present from this man, Whealley himself was next called in, and while standing by the side of the body, Mr. Williams suddenly put the ques- tion to him, whether he ever knew Patrick Duffey! Upon this unexpected demand, his countenance suddenly fell, and he faintly replied in the affirma- tive. It was therefore deemed fit to send him out of the room, and during his absence a discussion took place as to the propriety of putting any fur- ther interrogatories to him, after which he was again called in, and particularly cautioned that he was not bound to answer any question that might tend to his own prejudice. He was then asked several questions, in reply to which, among other matters, he admitted that the watch now in his possession was formerly Duf- fey's, accounting for it by saying that he gave him a pistol for it, which he acknowledged to be the one now produced. The last time he had seen Duffey, he said, was at his hut ; and that on that occasion he brought him up to Sydney in his boat, accompanied by Snell, since which he was gone to the Coal River and he had seen nothing further of him. This, how- ever, Snell, on being called in, denied. After ma- ture deliberation, and diligently considering every feature of the evidence adduced, the jury felt them- selves bound, under all the circumstances of the case, to return a verdict of Wilful murder against John Whealley and John Snell, for feloniously killing a person to the inquest unknown, but supposed to have been named Patrick Duffey."

Wo understand he will offer another valuable collection next Saturday. A new road, we understand, is about to be made between Bathurst and Hunter's River; the present communication is guided by notched trees, at suitable distances. A witness, giving evidence before the Police Bench on Tuesday, being asked to describe two men, whom he had seen on his farm, observed "the shortest of them was very long !" On Monday night, as Thornton, Cuff, and two other constables were going their rounds, they detected a fellow in the act of attempting a burglary in the house of Mr. Donnison, of Hunter-street. He had removed one square of glass, when hearing their approach, he laid himself down to hide, but they were on the alert, and discovered him. He turns out to be a man who absconded some months since from Hyde Parrack Barracks; and, on being taken before the Bench at that place, was sentenced to be worked on the roads in irons for twelve calen- dar months. A settler named White, who resides near the junction of the Liverpool and Sydney roads toward Parramatta, was stopped on Sunday last, by two fellows. They overhauled him, and took eleven shillings and part of his apparel, leaving behind them a black silk handkerchief, which is now in the possession of tho Police. THE MARCH OF INTELECT.—At Bristol Assizes a man named Bleck, was examined as a witness in a case of arson, whose evidence afforded a fine display of the rapid strides which intellect and science have made in these days of enlighten- ment. In answer to a question from Counsel, re- lative to the marks made on the beards by tho smoko of a candle, the witness said he had ob- served "marks of the traits or rays of the concen- calloric". This singularly scientific answer con- vulsed the court with laughter. The witness could not be prevailed upon to explain the meaning of the term to the learned counsel, but on the Recorder confessing that he himself was ignorant of the precise meaning of the term, the man of science, and member of Mechanics' Institutes, condescended to state, that the "rays of concentrated colleric," meant "the flame of the candle or torch." GAMING FOR MONEY.—In the reign of Richard I, an edict was issued concerning gaming, by which no person in the army was permitted to play at any sort of game for money, except knights and clergymen, who in one whole day and night should not lose more than twenty shillings, on pain of forfeiting one hundred shillings to the archbishop of the army. The two kings might play for what they pleased ; but their attendants not for more than twenty shillings, otherwise they were to be whipped naked, through the army for three days. EGYPT.—The Moniteur of the 13th April contains a letter from M. Pariset, dated Cairo, the 18th of December. After stating that there are great indications of another attack of plague in March, which, however, may not be of a very malignant character, the writer makes some in- teresting observations on mummies, and expresses his conviction that the ancient practice of embalm- ing was an hygæan precaution; he was, however, at first, embarrassed to comprehend where so much animal matter could bo concealed; but the difficulty, he says, disappears, on considering the number of square leagues thus occupied in the desert and in the mountains. The plain of mummies at Sequeral covers forty- nine square leagues ; and there are streets cut out in the Libyan chain of mountains twenty feet wide, and thirty in height, for a dis- tance of six leagues, all filled with the mummies of the ibis and the ass ; and in the Arabian chain is a natural grotto, upwards of four leagues in extent, full of the mummies of crocodiles, serpents, frogs, and birds, mingled together in a way which proves that they wero not treated as divinities.
