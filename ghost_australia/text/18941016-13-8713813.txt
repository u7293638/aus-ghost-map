TUESDAY, OCTOBER 10, 1894. The surprise in the Ministerial programme was the joint inclusion of the one man one Y e to and the one woman. ODO vote 'there was nothing to lead the public to the belief that Ministers WOuld elect to fly this particular lines at this particular juncture, when the WOrk to be done is urgent and practical rather than theoretic Mr ÏURNMI was questioned on the suffrage subject at St Kilda, and he replied - He believed in the principle of one man one vote but he thought this was not the time when the ship was in distress that there about 1 he quarrelling among the crew It may reasonable compromise could be arrived at it should be attempted until the question of ft li ration test rtnine 1 this matter He thought a re is unable compile miss would be to give a man 11 vote for his manhood 1 and also one for some other district in which he had pre pert) erasers) ing on business Surely no elector of St Kilda could suppose that the gentleman who reared as a sucking dove, so as to affright no 0110 World in a few days so as a "Minister urging the principle he was loth to quarrel and ready to complaints about, and urging it in its SOY crest form Moreover, as No know, Sir lui DI ino, S till oar) left the Munro Ministry rather than nth crate the "one man one vote ' principle lines Mr 'iuuNius assurances and Sir 1 RL DI RICK. SUUOODS record Munro well calculated to create the impression that the Micalago issue was to be left severely alone, at least until our troubles are over 'There may be an explanation somewhat to justify this reversal of public form by the two leaders of the Gover moment, the Assembly leader and the Council leader but it does not suggest itself The politician who does not have " one man one " vote " can scarcely be enthusiastic about " one woman one vote and it is difficult to see how the union of two pi maples to which the individual or less eau result 111 one principle which he can warmly champion but putting such considerations as these aside, the question arises whether these constitutional cover I ought to be possible 'The claim is made that so many candidates live quietly given in their adhesion to the Vi woman Suffrage association in order to secure the aid of spirited canVassers and of casting Y notes, that a bill can be rushed through the J Power House Should a surprise of this sort be permissible ? A school of thinkers is springing up in Great latin YMIO are realising and not arguing that laws should be divided into two disses-onluiary and costs tutional and that the latter should not be altered as readily and as lightly as the other 'Iho example usually taken is that of the United States, where the separation is absolute and complete, and has been maintained for a century as benefit ml But, as a matter of fact, we have examples ninth nearer home AYo adopt this system of distinguishing between ordinary and constitutional legislation 111 all our business affairs In the ordinary joint stock imp my, the shareholders elect directors who transact the business of the day in consultation and on their own authority, but when the articles of association are to be altered the directors, though of their w lsdom they may make proposals, yet they cannot LINO effect to the Mines without formally consulting the shareholders on that special point And no one ever heard of an objection to this course It common Is itself to one and all as equitable and prudent And what the at tides of association are to a company the constitution is to a country. The constitution states the form of government under which the people live and the principles on which it is founded, and it is not common sense that the form of government should be changed or that the principle should be valued without clear 1 novelette and a distinct affirmation It would not strike a stranger as snpeiHtiYcly YMSO that we should sandwich a change in the constitution between a bill for creating a local racecourse and a bill for licensing and regulating bone and bottle boys, and that we should allow the one measure to be dealt with as summarily and as quickly as the other if the intelligent stranger YYOIO told that Yvo adopted the one practice in our public and the other in our business affair she would probably say that YYO showed much more of wisdom. 111 our commercial than in our political arrangements It may be added that a good many commercial disasters would have been avoided if articles of association had been more beat than they YYOIO and if directors had been allowed loss latitude than they were 111 manipulating them and with fundamental principles 111 a constitution it is much the same No one can be hurt by full debate and a matured decision, and everyone may be injured by impulsive, half informed, or catch decisions A democracy no more requires that the first sheet in the street, or the first flashing 1111 pression of the political agitator, shall be imposed upon the statute book than does any other form of govern most In this instance the proposed change might prove in practice tun thing or nothing the government of the world so far has been conducted by males The formes in the long run, mall countries, are the majority, so that the mixed government might be a transfer of power from the mole to the female Supposing that the women of a house hold were always guided by the nuns culine heads, why, no great alterations might happen, but supposing that women, as a whole, listened to flatterers and toehailatansoi proved Yvaj ward, the ultimate changes might be much more than anyone has yet speculated upon 'there is another side to the cause, 111 get! by those who believe that women would be more quick in detecting and in punishing notorious wrong down than are men, and would be more eager to acknowledge the power of the priest or the tone in politics than is the total hams and "rational" make these ideas, and especially the supposition that the clergy would be strengthened by the change, are the influences that induce so many of the Conservative leaders in Great Britain to advocate the system But apart from these arguments the consideration remains that transforming political power and responsibility from one sex to another has all the possibilities of a revolution, and that such a change should hardly come as a make weight, or as a sop, or as an after thought, or to fill up a woman in a Ministerial programme It should be gravely debated All the practical contingencies should be con- sidered 1 01 instance, how would the system affect country districts where the total votes could not bring in wife, daughter, and helps with the facility with which townspeople could take the petticoated members of their households to record their votes 1 No thought so far has been given to points such as these It is to be noted also that the Conservative movement for the female suffrage in Great Britain is usually associated with a proposal that the constitution shall be strengthened in the thinner mentioned, namely, by great precautions being taken against hasty changes of the organic or fundamental law, and in particular the Conservative leaders have urged that after laws of this organic class are adopted they should pass the ordeal of a referendum None of those checks are spoken of here With the lightest of hearts we have proposals made for making off hind changes which might have the most far reaching of consequences A Machiavellian idea has found expression that the Ministry have linked the two proposals together to secure the intention of both Any way it would not be astonishing to find that Ministers are telling one section of their friends "'who movement " does not hurt you, and it pleases those " other follows " Spooks " do not readily lend them selves to statistical treatment 'They laugh at arithmetic, and refuse on any terms to be imprisoned in schedules But a very elaborate Census of Ghosts has just been brought to a close by the British Psychical Research Society, and the "report" is published with a gravity of classification and a wealth of laborious schedules worthy of a committee of German statisticians Professor SIDOW you, the chairman of the Psychical Research Society's committee, defines the report as a Census of hallucinations but this title is unphilosophical vague The term hallucinations " takes in the whole realm of human delusions, from a plain w Oman's faith in her own beauty to a dull man's admiration of his own wit Professor SIDGWJCK'S inquiry was limited to that single class of hallucinations known as "spooks" And never before were those tucky and elusive subjects put so resolutely under the scientific microscope for M\ melancholy j cars a committee, which included Professor Sinowich, Sir V V li Mines, Mr li VMC roiiMom, Mrs iSinrwicK, and a number of other ladies and gentlemen, have sat on this somewhat addled egg '1 hoyhavchad the assistance of chiffon 110 investigators, the majority of them, naturally, being women Dus faithful band has toiled since April, 1889, in search of "phan "trains" and ghostly hnlliinnattons generally They have separately, and in the most solemn manner, interrogated no less than 17,000 witnesses, and their replies are tabulated with the minuteness of a series of life assurance tables the opportunity of interrogate ing an air Uni spook, in the first person, unfortunately did not offer itself, so the evidence li is to be discounted by the falling circumstance that it is feet ondit and As each one in this profession of 17,000 witnesses mounted the witness box he or she wits solemnly questioned " Have you " over, when behaving yourself to be " completely awake, had a vivid impress " sion of seeing or being touched by a "hung being or inanimate object, or of " hearing a voice, which impression, so " far as you could describe, was not " due to any external physical cause 1" and the exporters of the 17,000 are embodied in a report of 500 pages, making up perhaps the best bit of unconsciously humorous literature which has appeared for the entertainment of mankind during those late dull years What, indeed, can be more humorous than the spectacle of 410 ladies and gentlemen devoting themselves for live diligent } cats to the single occupation of proposing, as a sort of conundrum, to over body they met the inquiry in substance, "Do you know a spook 1 ' There is no touch of a reverent humour, however, in the report of Pro fessor biimwiiKH committee They have conducted then scientific search for a ghost with quite delightful earnest less Out of the 17,000 persons whom they put to the question only 2,272 pretended to so much as a nodding acquaintance with a spook, and even this number, on being sifted, shrank to 1,081 On an average, that is, about one person in every ton amongst those examined was afflicted with the "Halle "station" that he had rubbed shoulders with a ghost, that some airy voice had syllables his name, or some unseen fingers had twitched his coat tails Or, to express these statistics in the high stopping language of psychical " research," the figures " seem to sug " gest that mankind may be divided " into two unequal fractions, one month " consisting of those who have had " personal experience of the super"

There " were only 16 angels and religious " phantasms, 33 grotesque and horrible " apparitions, and in 27 cases the " spectral form was that of an animal " Of the visual apparitions 4 00, or " nearly one half, were seen within the "lost ten years, d 23 were soon when "the observer was awake in bed or " immediately after working, in 438 cases " the recipient was up and indoors, and " 201 wore out

horrible," or even four logged and adorned with a special tail, after these alarming examples lhostatisticaof the Psychical Research Society seem to prove that the present population of the globe includes at least 10,000,000 ghost seems, a fact to the humane mind of a very distressing character If these spook discerning millions could only be sifted out, and induced to emigrate and set up a separate colony of their own, we might! expect to have some very interesting social developments life " ghost seeing " age, the committee report, is between 20 and 29 and this is an unexpected bit of statistics The rheumy optics of spectacled ago, or the fancy lit orbs of innocent childhood, it might be imagined, would pay most attention to the signalling of spooks The amount " of evidence, at present," YVO are gravely informed, " does not itself con " stitute a conclusive case for post mortem agency," yet it adorns " some argument for the continuity of " psychical life, and the possibility of " communications from the dead The committee quote a case flour bran, and add, cautiously, that " a " few more YVOII evidenced cases of this sort" would go far to establish the agency of the dead Apparitions of the (load, the committee say, occur most frequently at or soon after the moment of death, and become rarer as time goes by and the evidence, we are assured, " certainly suggests " that there is no discontinuity at the point of death, and no abrupt breach of communication with the living the part of the newly dead-a decidedly uncomfortable suggestion life evidence in proof that people YVIIO promise to appeal after death have kept their promise, the committee declare, " seems almost to day of " as to suppose that the office of the " promise depends upon the state of " the dead or dying person ' A dis embodied citizen, that is, may find it 03 difficult to keep an appointment exactly as a citizen yet in the flesh may find it difficult to meet a bill What is described as the strongest " case yielded by the whole 17,000 Yvitnosscs m proof that the dead take part in the affairs of the living does not, to the ups chical intellect at least, seem of overridden strength On a given date at an 1 night a young lady named Miss DOBSON was aroused, in the most approved fashion, by hearing her muna called three times feel prosaically imagined at first that it was her " uncle," though whether he was in the habit of wandering about in the dark at so late an hour inquiring for his niece is not shown On the third call Miss DODSON recognised the voice as that of her mamma," who had been dead 16 years. The apparition of her mother then came round a screen with two children in her arms, placed them in bed, care fully tucked them in, and exacted from her daughter a promise to take care of them live apparition then disappeared round the screen, and Miss Don ses, according to her own, evidence, went calmly to sleep with the two spectral children in bed with her " When I " ftYvoko," she reports, with an air of mild surprise, " there was nothing " But two d a y s afterwards came (the news of the death of a sister-in-law, leaving two children, one of them a newly born infant, of YVIIOSO existence Miss DoDSON was unaware, but of whom she immediately took charge Professor SiDtvwioh, on cross examining Miss DODSON, made what he describes as " the interesting " discovery " that the Bjioctral children who Yvero tucked in with her wore of nHcs corresponding with those of the actual children.
