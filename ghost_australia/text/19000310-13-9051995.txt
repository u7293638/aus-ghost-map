WOMAN'S REALM. "Thou art a woman, And that his saying the best and worst of thee." —Bailey Among other signs of the times that women are no longer the down-trodden slaves of tyrant man is the encouraging symptom that the aforesaid tyrant is now handing out a much more liberal and, what is more to the point, a more regular, dress allowance to his womenkind. It is as- serted, and with reason, that a wife with so much or so little per week to dress on, paid regularly in advance, is much more in- dependent than she who has to coax the reluctant guinea forth every time she wants a new autumn hat. There is some- thing galling in having to assume a mendicant whine when one asks one's hus- band for the very desirable dollars, but many a woman is forced to adopt that tone, and beg as a favour what she should receive as a right. When "father" handed "mother" out a cheque whenever she wan- tled new clothes, or, worse still, when "mother and the girls" simply got their things on credit, and waited tremblingly for the monthly bill to come in, there was apt to be a vast deal of unpleasantness even in the happiest homes. But now, in almost every household of moderate means, each of the girls has a fixed and separate allowance, and must dress on that It is a most valuable plan to give the just emancipated school girl a certain fixed sum and full liberty and license backed by a little judicious advice-to buy what she likes. She will, doubtless, at first get into hopeless muddles, spend five times as much as she can afford on laces, gloves, and other fripperies, and utterly neglect a warm jacket, thick soled boots, and other unormental, but useful garments. But, in the end, if she have any head at all, she will know the value of money, and have learned to clothe herself economically and tastefully And she will find shopping a much more interesting experience when she does it "on her own, and has to plan and contrive to make her money go as far as possible, than when she listlessly trails into the draper's behind mother, and has to ac- cept the maternal taste and decision as final, from hat to shoe-tips An authority declares that the three hardest things for an eighteen-year-old girl to learn are how to talk, how to listen, and how to walk upstairs. Eighteen is the regulation coming-out age in England, and damsels of those years are very often shy and gauche, and quite abashed at a ball or dinner party. Here, where the debutante forestalls her English cousin by a couple of years, sweet eighteen is as often as not a self-possessed woman of the world with a brace of seasons behind her. How- ever, the art of conversation is one that doesn't come by nature to every girl, even an Australian. To be able to keep the ball rolling without effort and without self-con- sciousncss is hard, but to appear to be in- terestedly listening without that preoccu- pied look appearing and giving one quite away, is harder still—and young girls are sometimes distressingly hard to interest in any topic save themselves. But hardest of all is the art of stepping upstairs in a long skirt, without tripping up at every second step. South Africa is a fine field for the adven- turess. Some pleasing revelations are coming out about sundry of the so-called nurses, who are trooping to the Cape. The papers say that at present any woman, pro- viding she can obtain command of a hun- dred pounds or so, can seemingly go to the Cape, wear some sort of a unifoim, and call herself a nurse. London has had a grand clearance of some ladies who, if they had remained behind, would have had to face debt and other unpleasantness. It is a lamentable state of things that these self seeking frauds should be able to mas- querade as nurses and throw discredit on a profession full of noble-hearted unselfish members. Then the social advertiser is reaping a rich harvest by posing as a "pa- triotic" writer of stories and ballads, which she buys from a "ghost", and an under- paid ghost at that. Frauds of this char- acter are soon found out; but the society adventuresses, the so called patriotic ac- tresses and the sham nurses who are everywhere imposing upon the credulity of the public, and who are merely furthering their own selfish ends at the expense of patriotism, are a distinct cause of danger to society at large Women dramatists aro coming to the front with a rush So much do they im press tliemsclves on this generation Unit thoy aie lectured about and discussed MrB Oscar Boringer delivered an address on the subject" lately to the Society of Women Journaliste Ihe lecturcss herself has wnttci plays, ' A Bit of Old Oh Isca' being the best know n iiere She pointed out that although Hannah More at the beginning of tile century waa a successful wntet of plays, having had some played by Garnck himself, and having made ovei Jb3l),000 bv her writings generally, yet from 1830 to 1875 there had been a slump in feminine drama Since then women have had then chance, and taken full advantage of it Hie Canary," now running in London, is by Miss Constance I letcher, know u as George Heming," and is "ono of the wittiest pro auctions of a woman s brain " Isot only is it wittv, but abounds in a ' subtle sense of farcical humoui " What avould Hannoh Moro havo said to that' The excellent Hannah would liave been as much horrified at the idea of humoui us bhe would be of sweating Artistic girls, anxious to earn an honest penny or more, might do worse than turn their attention to painting dress»s Hand painted chiflón, mousseline de soie, and gauze aie all the luge foi evening gowns, tit, bought ready painted their price is n small fortune A girl clever with hei brushes might be kept busy working foi her friends at cut rates for if she charged moderately she would be sure to be in great request 1 or instance, black mous sehne de soie, with a bodice design of «car lot poppies, light fcathei) grasses, with but ternlea hero and tliere, would be cliarming the buttei flies with spangles sewn on the wings, and spangles m other designs, as fancy dictates lins delightfully bright and niry effect, and othcis equnll) so could be attained by a girl w îth n small ar tlstic talent, not able to attain the higher flight» of landscape and figure painting Beautiful decoration of the above kind re deems at small cost an otherwise hopelessly commonplace and undistinguished ball gown There is going to be a change in the lime honouicd court train It is prophesied thit -
