FRAGMENT FROM AN OLD LATIN ODE. A DULL deep pain is at my heart, My eyes are wet with bitter tears, That gush from that still silent fount— The memory of bygone years. Oh! that within the iron gates Where death receives the trembling ghost, Some spot were found—some quiet nook— Where we might converse with the lost! Where, far from life and light, and pain, In that still shadow of the tomb, • Our souls might meet with theirs, and! they . . Fill in our Hearts the vacant room. Oh! kingdom rich in conquered spoils! Oh I land whence none can e'er return J Thfe«oul is fihut and barred in thee I Eyen«theduflt^ritlmtl»TOn.. 1 —J*fi4 C. Simgson.
