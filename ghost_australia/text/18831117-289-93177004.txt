fcteaiiiiife^' ; THEATRE ROyAL. There was only a moderate jhoase at -.the - Theatre Royal on Monday night, when Mr. Geo. Coppin presented ft- change of -prttJ - ?'- gamine, the fresh pieces being 'Hot Siuhr*- Fool as he Looks' and ' Tbe Artful Dadgg.' Mr. B* J. Byron'8-eooeBtzic comedy isrso well known to playgoers' that we neefrntitr ? enter into any description of the plot Mr. ? - - Mould, the messenger of. Mr. Daniel Mings- : troyd, is a character almost as familiar as the ghost in 'Hamlet,' though it reauires far more acting than the spiricuel 'personage with whom we have coupled it. Visitors to the Adelaide stage have seen Mr. Coppin in this part before, and when we say that ids inter pretation of the character under notice is as - good now as ever it was we need add notftiirg more. The veteran actor amused theiisteners from the moment he came on until the end of ' the piece, and although the audience wa* a . small one it was at least very apprecia tive, and rounds of applause greeted the 'grand old man' at various times daring . the performance: He was ably Bapportfed by Mr. Hodson as Murgatroy4, Mr. Rogers £3 /. Frederic Grantley, Mr. WaltonasSicStiiBoii -. ? Simple, and Mr. H«zUtt as CbptBJnMartarti ; while the female characters found excellent interpreters in the Misses Watts-HulUpa, ' ? SolaEge-Novaro, and Flora Aratead; The - amusiEg farce 'The Artful Dodge ' was also greatly appreciated, and as Demosthettes ? - : Dodge Mr. Coppin kept bis audience in roars of laughter. Mr. Tolano as- Trundle. Mr. Sweeney as Grudge, Mr. Hazlitt as Nudge, and Mr. Walton as Badge, were ail admirably . ' . : ? cast, while the ladies who sustained the characters of Emily Wilton aad Susan Smudge left nothing to be desired.
