An attempt is being made in the old country to revive the belief in visitants from another world, and many are the wonderful stories that fill some of the journals. The sceptical mind is, however, inclined to adopt Scrooge's remark to Marley's ghost: "How do I know that you are not a bit of undigested bread ?" for, of all the ghost producers, a bit of " heavy' 'bread is the most potent. It is a wonder, therefore, that people do not adopt the surest spell against ghosts by using Borwick's Gold Medal Baking Powder in making bread; for, although it won't " raise ghosts," it will raise bread in the most admirable fashion, Every wise storekeeper has it by him, and every good housewife buys it.

Large and small bottles are obtainable at every respectable Hotel in the colonies, and the name of M. Moss and Co, is on the top label of the yellow wrapper. None else is genuine. DEW OF THE ARTS-The very name of this celebrated Swiss tonic is appetizing, and its beneficial effects as restorative and invigorant, an antidote to miasma, a remedy for general weakness and nervousness, a means of averting the diseases incident to hot climates, and A specific for dyspepsia, are beyond all question. These are good reasons why we should congratulate our readers on the introduction of the oldest, and most famous, and certainly the most palatable, of all European cordials into this far- away corner of the globe The only agents of the proprietor in Australia are Messrs, M, Moss and Co., and to that enterprising firm we owe its importation into Australia. It is already a favourite with every class and calling among us, and may be regarded henceforward as a staple article. 6437 HOLLOWAY'S OINTMENT AND PILLS None except the uncommonly hardy can hope to escape continued, unsettled, and unusually wet weather without some bodily discomfort or actual disease.
