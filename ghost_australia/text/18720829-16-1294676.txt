BISHOP TUFNELL AND HIS "EYES." TO THE EDITOR OF THE BRISBANE COURIER. SIR-It is deeply to be deplored that this rev. gentleman should have again re wed his sectarian crusade. One would have thought that the general public feeling displayed d on his former charge would have put all sensitive minds to utter shame and silence It seems, however, he is inclined to rev how his attacks w the fiercer spirit than over He has thrown down the gauntlet with a vengeance, openly coal longing., public opinion on the merits of National verse Denominational Schools sing it as his opinion: that if Ihepoople could be pelled to morrow a large my unity would be found in favor of sectarian rather than secular instruction I, for one, am bold enough to tell him that if he thinks proper to test the matter fairly and openly he will find to his cost that he is woefully mistaken Neither he nor anybody else can have much fault to find with the generous extension of the Education Act by the Hon Charles Lilley, or with the Board of Education, especially of late, Since the multiplication of schools three ghost the colony, and the increased a number of able teachers they have engaged for their gran I public task Outcrio of a religious as well as of a political native are too often got up under very slender pretences, and oft n r still under prejudice, ignorance, and misunderstand ing Just so is this mischievous outcry for Dei ominational touching Bishop Tuf roll would make us believe that the National is an ungodly system Surely neither he, nor any of his followers, can over have troubled themselves with the perusal of the reading books placed in the hands of pupils instructed under the Boa d's directions It is only right that the public generally should look for themselves into these books, when they will find a very large portion of them conveying more outlines of Biblical instruction than I venture to assert, are admitted into any other academies, private or public c In the First Book of Lessons put into the hands of children there are several moral lessons and muably suited for their infant minds, on greedy ear, charity, duty to parents, the value of domestic australia, produce of the soil The Value of Prayer and Praise to the Almighty," " The Fate of the Wicked-" The Evils of False hood," " The W, orders of Creation," " Kindness to One Another," " He gives twice who give with a Mill, and many others, all conv lying Christian truths that parents, or even the clergy whom eelvoB, could hardly excel This valuable little prime concludes with the following Scriptural lesson " It was God that made me it is he that still keeps me in life. It is from Him that all the good things come, which are in my lot And it was He who sent Christ to save me I wish that I could love him, and in Him, and do His will, and pray to Him as I ought It is a great sin to break the Lord's Day, or to take His name in vain, or to go with t> one who walk in the paths of Bin He hates all such things, and in His were 11 will come upon those who do them, and who will not turn from them I pray that I may not think bad thoughts nor Speak bud words, nor do bad deeds" Would any teacher be expected to instruct further Could any clergyman select a more suitable lesson P Have any of the Sunday schools Presbyterian, Catholic, or Protestant anything better, 01 so good ? With your permission I will now refer to my children's Second class books, in which it will be seen that no less than 04 pages are wholly devoted to the inculcation of Scriptural extracts and lessons from the Old and New Testaments The following are the subjects alluded to - Adam and Eve, All Mankind, God's FamiU, Cain and Abel, Call of Abraham, Capture and Deliverance of Lot, Destr tion of Sodom and Gomorrah, The Flood, God the Eather and Ruler of AU, How the World was Wide Night, Parting of Abraham and Lot, The Seasons, View of Natu o, The W rks of God, Changes of Nature, Compassion, Evening Hymn, Hea i only Wisdom, Lesson from a Cloud, Love between B others and Sisters Morning Hymn, The Mother's Lament My Mother, An Orphan's Recollections of her Mother, Our Father Who art in Heaven (admirably paraphrased), The Beauties of the Rainbow, Summer and its Splendor, The Sunbeam, Thoughts of Christ. The Voice of Spring, and many others having a marked religious tendency As the education of Qucoual riders may well be formed the subject of all subjects nearest to the hearts of parents, please to allow me to continue a few extracts from the Third Book of Lessons, so wisely selected by the National Board of Education for England, Ireland, and Scotland, and very rarely (I think) adopted here In the Third Book, then, just handed to me by my daughter, I find the following re- ligious lessons - The Wonders and immensity of the Universe the journey to Bethlehem, the PIOUS Sons, Respect for the Aged, purely Scripture history the Birth of Isaac and Expulsion of Ishmael, the Tri ii of Abraham's Fa th, Death of Sarah, Marriage of Isaac, Death of Abraham, Jacob and Esau, a long History of Joseph, Biographical Sketch of Moses, Deliverance of the Israelites, Ac The foregoing occupy up wards of sixty pages Allow me now to proceed to the Fourth Book, in which n v son has just pointed out the following subjects, entirely Scriptural -The journeying of the Israelites, Settlement in the Holy Land, the Hebrew Commonwealth, Government by Judges, History of the Israelites from the establishment of the Monarchy until the Birth of Christ, Jewish Festivals and Ordinances, Scriptural Blmdnca (a lesson I par- ticularly recommend to the discontent ), the Supreme Intelligence the Beauty of the World To these may be a tded numerous lessons bl J graphical, in for teal, and topographical, from the best poets, ancient and modern, and in all of which I feel bound to say many adults, as well as children, may learn Bound moral lessons, as well us all the leading features of cripple 0 H story What more would Dr Tufnell or any other divine expect to be taught in public schools ? Are we in the 19th century, to call up all the old bigotry and intolerance of the past through our children ? Are we to array them in classes to learn catechisms of opposing creeds, Protestant, Catholic, Presbyterian, Wesley an, primitive Methodist tie, Anauism, Galvanism, Mahommodamsm, Judaism, " Ohineseisui," Budeltsm, Utabiam, and all the other " isms " that may be scattered in small sections throughout the colony I trow not, and before Dr Tufnell attempt any further raid upon the gullibility of the public I would strongly recommend him to pause, ere he flings the sectarian firestick too far or most assuredly, like the native's boomerang, it will reveal. By all means let well alone Free education has of Hy justified itself, the Board, and the Minister and Government who gave it to Queensland. It is a complete success , such a one, indeed, as the people love too well to exchange for Dr Tufuell's or any other system u It may have, and no doubt has, somewhat injured private scholastic establishments, but SO do all reform', more a loss, clash with private interests None but the most b good and selfish will however, repine at this, for it is very clear that the Board's course of instruction (barring Dr. Tufnoll's Bible teaching system) is as high as it need be to suit the wants of the colony. As an instance; of its popularity, I find my children, now, side-by-side the sons and daughters of the first citizens in Bria> bane, and any system that will attract such a state of kind feeling among our children is richly deserving of the highest commendation. Fearing to trespass further on your space I conclude, and beg to remain, yours, &c.;, MATE HE M f LIAS.
