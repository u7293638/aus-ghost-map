Miscellaneous News; The DRAMA;— The bills of fare for Saturday evening-was the- Castle Spectre. Dancing on the Tight Rope, and a Farce .called No. The former has been often- before the Public. but with the present cast of character, more than half the beauty of the piece is lost. Knowles played with his usual nerve. Mr. Simes' Earl Percy was a mull, that gentleman should suck eggs to clear his wizen. Mr. Grove played H ass an in cha racter ; the wonderful evolutions of the legs and s of this worthy are astounding; he is well qualified to play the Clown to the Rope, but for Tragedy, Comedy, or melodrama pro proh pudor. What made him leave out that splendid passage of. tearing the bracelet of "Samba's hair from| his arm to heap up bitterer vengeance against, the Chistians? Was it because the house was thin or from ignorance Mr Meredith -played Father Phillip with much spirit. Mrs. Jones played Angela genteely.- Mrs. Meredith's Alice was below par. The Ghost should be played by a person at least three feet taller than the-one who exhibited on Saturday night. The lad Quin then performed on the tight rope with his usual suc cess; the public have bad quite sufficient of this kind of thing0nce a week would answer. The farce of "no," for the first time is a lively little thing, but the cast not good. Sir George 'Doubtful by Mr Lane should have been-' played by Knowles, the former gentle voice resembling a cracked. fiddle. Mrs. Meredith should play Lady jDoubtful without a pocket handker chief in her hand, it is too much in the Chamber maid style The farce was well; received, and, with a diferent cast and more study become a favourite. Sir John Jamieson will this season make 2,000 gallons of various discriptions of wine from his vineyard at Regentville, and, if some of our wealthy proprietors would emulate his example in a very few years, we might expect another, valuable ex- port to be added to the product of the Colony. For the purpose of fostering this nascent source of wealth an order was lately obtained; we believe at the insistence of Sir John, that all brandy used in the making of wine should be exempt in the pay- ment of duty. This regulation, which exists so at the Caape of Good Hope, is unfortunately coupled with a restriction imposed by the Com missioners of the Custom, which renders renders it nearly unavailing,— this is not only that a person should be appointed, which, which is reasonable enough to see that -the brandy so exempted should be actually used in the wine but that the wine itself should be bonded for exportation. Now this is very hard, because in the making of wine, in a young country, it is not to be expected that it would for some years be brought to such perfection as to pay the proprietor to export, although he might be remuneration by disposing of it, or using it in the Colony. It is to be hoped, therefore, that repre sentations will be made in the proper quarter to procure B''reliixat:6n;of a ' restriction, wiiiLh'' will liave sftmaleiial inftuence. in checking the e.npen 'stye evperimerUSi which' must be made ere tht manufactute.of ,wiae icaiio be brought to anything: jlike a reasonable; degree of .perfection. :i . , 1 ??.?ii,1f ? 1 On Tuesday.. night: a-female residing in Goulburn ? street,, having occaaronito^visit a Iriend, locked up her house and departed, -leaving no one in charge.! ;On -returnin-g. a ushoit;tiine- afterward*, to her-np', ?ni«M surprise she foimdqt he whi(io w open, .and nt woinan' inside rummuging, .her, , -draweis*. ,:Tlie intruder having be^n handed over to tlie Pulj.ci-, soitie trifling artiGles of wealing apparel, it wms It is an old saying, that new brooms sweep clean, and doubtless ihey -ought,, but .they, appear tp* retard the , motions in' the. legal departments of this Colony, judging from the length of tmie thui the Jud^tSj Jury, llepprteis, 5tc; are kept 'cpn- slanfl) iii the i briminal Cbiirt., for want of'inlpr ni'a-ions I'eing' .presented to 'the Goiirt, There* i» also a grt-a' defect in the serving of jmbpeenas, by vvhiclv '/,'inahy pjisoners tre uunble to /defend themselves.' .-??'' - ?
