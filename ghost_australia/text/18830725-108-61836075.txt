SPORTING NOTES. (BY SE~o IcoR.) The racing season having once again fairly started, followers of the sport in this district have now to turn their at tention to the weights for the Sale Turf Club Winter Meeting. Tattler, Belle Brandon, and Black Prince appear to be about the best in the Hurdle Race. There are no less than 25 horses in the Winter Handicap, and, judging from the quality of the horses entered, it should prove a most exciting contest. The Ghost can hardly be expected to give Glbs to Mis. taken, and I should think that Transferred was the bast of those down to Oat. Corio. lanes with 8st 131bs is fairly treated, and should hold Liddington with only a differ coc of i31bs safe, Contessina I have a great fancy for, but Taper seems hardly treated at 8st 5bs.., Phantom, if like the Phantom of old, should win, but nothing has been heard of him for some time past. Iron Hand we have yet to hear front, al. though it is whispered that this colt is a shade better than Magnot, if so the race is all over " bar the shouting." Jose phine is nicely in at 8st 21bs. Westbury and King Charles, at 8st, have about as much as they can carry. Turretfiold at Set is another of my fancies. Belle Bran. don I do not like. Douglaston is about played out. Tantaliser is out of his depth in such company, and of those be. low him the only one likely to prove troublesome is Quality. The Wattle Steeplechase should fall to Coomete or Shamrock, Speculator and Trumpeter be ing about the next best. The A.J.O. Derby is at present receiv ing most attention, and,. as Archie and Off Color are not engaged in it, the issue will probably be between Warwick and Martmni- Henry, of whom report speaks very favourably. For the V. R.C. Derby Archie and Warwick divide the honors, Off Color running them very close, while rfartini- Henry is the only other colt mentioned.
