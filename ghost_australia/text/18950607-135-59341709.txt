POETRY. To Lay the Ghost, You say you've a ghost that haunts you, The ghost of a vain regret, The thought of the years you have wasted, And would, if you could, forget. Your heart overflows with sorrow As you think of the misspent Past, Opourtunities lost for ever Crowd memory thick and fast. But all your vain regrettings Will never lay the ghost Which makes us, each one, at some time, His most unwilling host. For the only way to do it Is to rise to a better life, To build up the old waste places, To start on a holy strife. To conquer your lower nature, To crucify Self, and to live, Henceforth, to a nobler purpose, Your time and your strength to give. Oh, live as a man and a Christian, And you shall have Farce at the last. And your deathbed shall not be haunted By the ghost of a misspent Past.
