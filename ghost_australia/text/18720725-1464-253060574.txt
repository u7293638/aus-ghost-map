THE DESTROYING ANGEL. (Vide Cartoon.) I the mid- watch of night, when the flickering light Of the lamps fell faint through the gloom — . When the snore of repose from Bradridge's nose Soared out in that gentleman's room — While Chapman slept, and the hobbies kept An eye on a drunken bard : Through the Town Hall doors crept a Thing of claws, Though the gates were bolted hard. A terrible Form, with features yet warm From the tropical clime below : For the hue of its face illumined the place With a burning blood-coloured glow ! And its shapeless hands were as red as brands From the nethermost flames alight ; While the way that it swore, and stamped on the floor, Was a caution, that awful night. And the documents grand of the sapient band Who rule o'er the civic roast, Amid yells of scorn, to shreds were torn, By this ghastly-grinning Ghost. Btt never a shout brought a " trap " about To stop its devilish glee ; Though its fiendish cries and flaring eyes Were fearful to hear and to see. But the crow of the cock brought the usual shock, And the Demon slithered away : Still the wreck it wrought in its wicked sport Was sadder than bard can say. And the next day's wail in the civic pale Sent a thrill through the whole of the town ; And the manner of Joe when he saw the "go " Would have brought a gallery down. And the hue and cry, that by and bye Went abroad o'er the face of the land, For the fiend unknown, made the horses moan At the neighbouring omnibus stand ; But only now is the cause of the row Brought forth from its den and disclosed : So turn to our sketch, and " twig " the wretch By Punch and his Toby exposed.
