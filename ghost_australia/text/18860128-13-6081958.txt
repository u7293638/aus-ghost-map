THURSDAY, JANUARY 28, 1886. The constitutional caucus yesterday was a perfect contrast in every sense of the word to the noisy, argumentative, bickering gatherings held by the Radical party at an earlier period of the poli- tical situation. When the present House met, 38 constitutionalists had seats, making them the strongest party in the Legislature, as they were— and as no doubt they still are—the strongest in the country. The radi- cals claimed 35 members for their side. What Mr. DEAKIN'S present strength is cannot be accurately stated, but it is to be presumed to be from 20 to 24 votes. Mr. GILLIES had 22 members actually present yesterday. Apologies for non-attendance, containing assurances of support, were received from four others. Several members, such as Mr. OFFICER (who is travelling in Tasmania), Mr. STAUGHTON, and Mr. WALLACE, could not be communicated with, but their personal and political sympathies are well known. So are those of Mr. ROBERTSON and Mr. GIBB, who, together with Mr. SERVICE, are retiring from the House, and could not speak for the future of the party. But it is clear that if Mr. GILLIES met the present House at the present moment ho would have 32 constitutional mein bers at least in favour at this juncture of tho coalition principle, and of giving tho member for ltodney and tho mern ber for West Bourke a fiee hand Tho computation docs not take count of the two membeis for West Melbourne, who wero absent, but w lioso consti tuents no doubt will tako cal o that they do not mtroduco disunion into the ranks, nor of tho "-uc cessor to Mr KIRHRD, who may be assumed to be of Mr KIRIÍRD'S mind If Mr DLAKIN has 21 votes, tho new Mimstiy would have a powerful majouty in tho piesent House of at least two to one A gi eat many votes can be struck oft with the result of still leaving a new coalition Ministry with a good worklug lead Of course the constituencies may i everse all this, but the gentlemen who met yesteiday appeal to be quito satis fled that their electors aio with them in a desire not to distuib the present quiot, either by insidious blows at capital or by tho prosecution of egregious "fads" Mr GILI ii s explained that Mi SLRVICE did not feel justified in taking auy stop to break up a successful combination be causo he is ill, and tho constitutional members aro unanimous in consideung that, looking at Parliament as it is now constituted, the retiimg Piemier had practically no choice but to suggest the membei for Eodney as hit successor In those cases, it is no use talking about some ideal chief 'Iho paity has to tako tho best man available, and Mr GILLIES has fanly woikcd his way to a I chance at tho front Hie only feai is that the success of yosteulays piocccdmgs may induce Mr GILLIES to think, too lightly of tho views and feelings of tho constitu tional majority bo much pressure is being put on Mi Di vkiv that it is possible he will desire to bo placed in a bettei position than Mr Bl RR\ was, aud oflcuce would natuially bo given if such concessions wcro made We are sure that the idea m tho mind of e\ cry mombei piesent yesteiday was that the geneious torms conceded bv Mi SEP\ ICE should be granted, and no moro It is no use entering into a coalition of this chai actor except upon a footing of equality So the constitutionalists who are in tho majority, willingly admit to the radicals, who are in the minority, but to grant more would be a grave error in tactics Mi SERMCI and Mr BLI I Y nominated each an equal number of mcmbeis in the two Houses, and this manly division of powei and in llucuco inspired confidence, and was tit the bottom of the success of the pie sont Government Libeity was taken to veto a particular appointment which Ah BrpiiY might have made, namely, that of the author of tho «candáis in the I ducition depaitinent but we apple bend no buch stipulation is necossaiy now, as Air Di VMV IS not likclj to look to any of the politicians who aie hanging on his flank endeavounng to embanass his movements and they in eludo tho only members to whom ob lection could be faulv taken 'iho Piemicus, however, ti.o// foi the pei&onnel; of his team and he cannot but beal that consideration in mind As a veteran also, it is his duty to save Mr DEAKIN from error, remem bering that the radical press lays stress upon tho second adjective m its constant i eferente to the member for West Bourke ns a ." promising yoting man." On the whole, the constitutional mem- bers can be congratulated upon having preserved their unity during a campaign of great length and of unexampled per- formance. They allowed Sir BRYAN O'LOGIILKN to take ollico and to hold it until his Government broke down through sheer incapacity, and then they macio an unselfish arrangement with the other party, and their tone is equally patriotic to day. It is impos- sible to feel other than suro of the success iu the immediate future of a party which has given such magnificent and practical assurauco to the country that its object is never individual poYver, but always prosperity and peace. There must bo something serious tho matter Yvith a political party when it is constrained by btrcss of circumstances to comparo itself to a preparation of sauerkraut. " We Liberals,'' says Mr. STEAD'S organ in London, " aro in a " fine pickle just now', and no mistake." And this familiar, half-slangy style of composition is, as every one knows, Mr. STEAD'S own patent. That great and good man loves to deal with the most weighty topics in his shirt sleeves, as it were. And the rollicking meta- phor which he or his locum tenens adopts to illustrate the actual condi- tion of English Liberals, is reproduced here to describe the plight of Victorian radicals. But why does the Victorian radical turn in his distress to pickles 1 Mr. SERVICE declared tlio other day at Castlemaine that we could not have "the '. old parties back again, not even their " ghosts, but only their offensive " corpses." is it suggested that the corpse of the old Liberal party would keep better if carefully pickled ? Any preparation which included samples of the whole so-called Liberal party under present circumstances would bo a pre- paration of mixed pickles unquestion- ably. There is Dr. IÏOSE'S new league, which lias issued a manifesto wildly oblivious of English grammar and full of heresies, such as compensation to people whose goods or houses are taken for state purposes. Mr. MIRAMS and Mr. MUNRO, again, want to set up a pickle jar of their own, and then there is the other league, xvhoso name we forget at the moment, whick wants to abolish interest on loans, and collec- tion of dobts, and such things. All this is bad, and the remedy suggested is that a manifesto should be issued, clearly explaining and harmonising the miscellaneous views of these politicians. If this bo done, "and the seal of the " party " bo attached to the manifesto, the constitutionalists will be prevented from repealing the liberal legislation of the last ten years, and all will bo well. What can bo meant by all this groan- ing and moaning, these slangy meta- phors about being " in a fine pickle," and so forth 1 The constitutionalists, although so frequently slain and annihilated of recent years, seem to be moderately contented with their lot ; they do not even possess a " seal of the " party " to attach to documents, and as to setting to work to repeal all the liberal legislation of the last ten years, they are at present decidedly languid. Can it be that the prophets and seers of radicalism are nervous about the effect upon the average Vic- torian elector of the legislation of the last ten months-about the effect of one or txvo acts not enforced yet, but to be enfoiced presently. Thero seems to be a suspicion that the people .of the colony are not in lovo with tho kind of nigger-driving and spoon-feeding legislation which was initiated during the late session. Tho proposal to revivo a bastard copy of the Inquisition in Victoria is not '\ ory in vitmg to Victorians generally, but strong as the abstract objection to this kind of petty slaveiy undoubtedly is, the outcry, when once the army of inspectors, sub inspectors, deputy sub inspectais, spies, informers, and black mailers, sets to work to enforce the early closing clauses of the 1 actones Act, may be a good deal strongei still The attempt to enforce the law may lead to some squabbling and much grumbling Will all this popular discontent add to the sharpness of the "fine pickle ' in which " we liberals" now writhe ? That is tho painful question of the moment Other brands of " fine pickle, ' how ever, remain in reserve Numbers of small shopkeepers are as yet unaware that a law has actually been passed which empowers a sort of latter day familiar of tho Inquisition to turn customers out of shops and extin guish the lights during business hours fortunately, peihaps it was so arranged that the " go to bed " clause which disfigures a fairly useful factories act should not come into operation until after the elections By the middle of Febiuaij, therefore, tho small shopkeepers will not be quite as angry with the " half "blown socialists' who fathered this curfew legislation as they may be later on But with íegaid to the ill starred and ahcadj-reponted of Licensing Act, the case is bomowhat different That act will como into opeiation m ti few d lys and theie will just bo timo for the public to get thoioughly nutated by some of its piousions, and foi the liconsed victuallcis to thoroughly mal e up then minds how to deal, according to the beat of their ability, with the people who initiated and sup ported tho act in question Where the ' party ' vote is split by many candi dates trying for one seat, a solid vote from any quarter, backed by organisa lion and money, ought to tell All tho elements of a really "fine pickle aio thus contained in this wretched Licensu ¿ Act business Ali CHILDI i s plunged into tho muht of pickle of tho woist kind when he mtioduccd his last (his \eiy last)budgot, containing ponai taxes on beei and spnits-a budget which turned out a Government Even Prince Bismarck. got into trouble over a beer tax a while ago, and had to repeal it At the polls during tho recent general election in Great Britain, swift and sudden judgment has fallen upon the majority of the amiable but wearisome teetotal fanatics Sir WiLiRiD LAwsoN himself, Mr CAINE (an equally pertinacious and unscrupulous advocate of the modern social Inquisition), Mi G*OR_I RUS'-I-LL, Air SAMC/LL SMITH, Ali B Winrwoi ni, and a number of other politicians who are quite incapable of reading the real opinion of tho average Briton on this teetotal ques tion, met with the same fate as Mr Alu-sro, Air HAIIF\, and othet " temperance " candidates have met with in Victoria The friendly, although decidedly "slangy," warning ot the Pull Mall Gazette, is really meant to teach Liberals that they must pocket their whims and crotchets, and suppress their ten dency to woolgathering and moonraking as soon as it becomes apparent that tho people do not care for such things The advice given to radicals here is on the contrary, to try a hair of the legis lation dog which has bitten them already, and to go on the same road "which spells ruin ' Although many severe things have been said about radicals in this new country and the old, they are never quite so silly 0r so felonious as their organ here makes them out to be No "base, bloody, and brutal constitu- lionalists are going to try and repeal all the statutes passed during the last few years en masse, and it is equally im- probable that Victorian radicals will ever commit themselves to crazy schemes of repudiation in the shape of foolish absentee taxes or the like Every one is concerned in keeping up the credit of the colony, and it is rather hard on Victorian radicals to be identified with such pernicious nonsense. The blessings of high xvages, slioiter houis of labour, and trades ori"ini a tions have fieqtiently been represente 1 as only the prelude to higher attum ments-as the ladder by winch the YYorkmg man xvas to raise himself, both in mental culture and in social aniem ties The argument is not meiely plausible, but one that xvill be reidilv idmitted If a man is over worked he has neither time noi strength to spire for the impiovement of his mind , and unless he bo at the Fame time fairh paid, he cannot afford tho finer plea sures, and YYIII bo tempted to drift into the gross r A certain amount of lei sure is undoubtedly necessary both for recreation and for purposes of liistruc tion Without it the more cultured classes XYOiild nevei have gained their position and the tastes that they pi up most highly But in Victoria tliii preliminary stage lias been reached foi some time-this scaffolding on XYIUCII the neYV society of labour is to be built is almost fully completed Eight hn ir» aro lecognised as constituting a fan day s XYOik, and tho rate of xYages is> so high that a careful aitisan can surround himself not only with the comforts of life but with many of its lui-uries Hie condition of things revealod m some distuets of England, where bad house?

The medical evidence showed that the child's throat had been cut, but no verdict was arrived at, as the sisters of the girl could not attend, and the inquest had to be adjourned for a month, in order that their state- ment might be procured. The funeral of the murdered girl took place during the afternoon. About 5 o clock yesterday afternoon the eldest son in the family, Charles Hampton, showed decided signs of insanity. He refused to partake of his tea, on the ground that it had been drugged. He continued to get worse until hall past 11 o'clock, when he became very much excited.

The follow- ing gentlemen were present :- The mayor, who was in the chair; Messrs Thornley and Williamson, MLC's; Mr Toohey MLA ; and Messrs. Joseph Jones, C.P. Williams, Akosky, A. Robertson, E.G. Fitzgibbon, and J. Lake. Upon consideration of a letter from Mr Vickers, the honorary secretary to the fund at Panmure, asking that a delegate should be appointed to join in deciding as to the distnbution of the amounts collected, it was resolved that the mayor be asked to act in that capacity. That gentleman consented to do so, and intimated that he would proceed to the locality of the fires as soon as possible. With regard to en- listing public sympathy on a larger scale, it was decided to again write to the Bishop of Melbourne asking him to give an address at a public meeting to be held at the Town-hall on as early a date as might suit his conve- nience. Owing to the infrequency of com- munication with the portion of the country in which the Bishop of Melbourne is at pre- sent residing, no reply had been received to the communication sent him some days ago. It was announced that the total subscrip- tion to the fund in the hands of the Mayor amounted to £719 2s 5d, including £50 sub- scribed at the Melbourne Stock Exchange. The meeting then adjourned.
