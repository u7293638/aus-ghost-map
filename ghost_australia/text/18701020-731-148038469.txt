(.To the Edtior of the Ohroriide^ 8D8,-— Our annual Agricultural Show is at )iand,tand Us there seems to be at least the ^ghoet of ach^ace of having His Excellency rthe Governor as a , visitor at the same, it is \- hoped that our local' producers of all grades ''fere bestirring themselves with a view to mak . ing the exhibition of Wednesday next what it ' ought to be— a practical demonstration that oar boasted agricultural superiority consists of Bomethmg more tangible than air bubbles, and i that they grossly malign the social character ; ^ of ihe ^district who strive to picture us as a ?+ ' community of.fire-eaters, incapable of unity. , -The^-rogrammeof the. coming show, for a young society, appears to be both comprehen- ? «iye «ad ^bcral.
