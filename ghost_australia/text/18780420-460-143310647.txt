POETRY. THE HOUSE OF DEATH. BY MRS. MOOLTON. Not a band has lifted the latchct Since she went out of the door No footstep shall cross the threshold Since she can come in no more. There is rust upon locks and hinges, And mould and blight on the walls, And silence faints in the chambers, And darkness waits in the halls Waits as all things have waited Since she went, that day of spring, Borne in her pallid splendour To dwell in the Court of the King: With lilies on brow tod bosom, With robes of silken sheen, And her wonderful, frozen beauty The lilies and silk between. Red roses she left behind her, But they died long, long ago 'Twas the odorous ghost of a blossom That seemed through the dusk to glow. The garments she left mock the shadows With hints of womanly grace, And her image swims in the minor That was BO used to her face. The birds make insolent' music Where the sunshine riots outside, And the winds are merry and wanton With the summer's pomp and pride. But into this desolate mansion, Where Love has closed the door, Nor sunshine nor summer shall enter, Since she can come in no more.
