She crossed the Equator on the nineteenth day out, in lon. 25deg. W. ; passed the meridian of the Cape of Good Hope on the forty-fourth day out, in lat. 44deg. S. ; and sighted Cape Otway on the sixty-sixth day. She has since been detained by heavy gales. She signalized Cape Schanck at three p.m. on the 6th, and was obliged to lie-to off the Heads during the night, and entered early yesterday morning, reaching Hobson's Bay soon afterwards. Captain Bawn reports having experienced baffling winds through the latitudes of the S.E. trades, being forced to go close to the Brazilian coast, and from passing the meridian of Cape Good Hope strong N.W. gales ; also that when close to Cape Otway, on Sunday last, he hoisted his signals, and again when off Cape Schanck on the following day, but no report was made of it. On arrival in Hobson's Bay, the pas- sengers presented Captain Bawn with a handsome testimonial, thanking him and his officers for their kindness and attention throughout the voyage. The ship is, as usual, in first-rate order, although having encountered such fearful weather. THE A.S.N. Company's s.s.s. Wonga Wonga left Sydney at twenty minutes past four p.m. on the 4th inst. Passed Gabo Island at thirty-four minutes past, three on the following day ; and passed through Port Philip Heads during a fearful gale on Monday evening, anchoring outside Gellibrand's Point shortly before midnight, where she was obliged to remain until yes- terday afternoon, when the storm lulled a little, and and was enabled to reach the Railway Pier. When coming through the tide rip at the heads she was pooped by a tremendous sea, which started a portion of the bulwarks. VESSELS SPOKEN BY THE TRUE BRITON.—May 28, Attila, ship, bound hence, lat. 23deg. 30min. S., lon. 35deg. 9min. W. May 31, Dorothea, also for this port, lat. 29deg. 53min. S., lon. 27deg. 5min. W. THE s.s.s. Black Swan left George Town Heads at nine a.m. on the 5th inst., and arrived in Hobson's Bay early yesterday. Captain Woods reports that for the first part of the passage he had strong north-west winds, which veered to south and south east. On the following day the gale increased ; and at ten p.m., blowing a hurricane, hove to, with head to southward, until four a.m. yesterday, when the weather cleared up ; passed through Port Philip Heads at nine a.m. DURING the past three days the bay has been visited by fearful storms, which commenced at north, and have since veered round to S.E., accompanied by a tremendous confused sea ; so much so that the steam tug Lioness, with anchor and chain for ship Golden South, at the Heads, which started yesterday fore- noon, was obliged to put back. Some of the ships at the different piers have carried away portions of their chain plates, and several small craft and boats have sunk at their moorings. Fortunately no loss of life is reported. As an instance of the severity of the gale on Monday last the A. S. N. Company's s.s.s. City of Melbourne was obliged to put back to Port Philip Heads, where she anchored until the gale abated a little. THE following is the list of cabin passengers per ship Wave of Life, for London :—Mr. and Mrs. Whitney and child ; Mr. and Mrs. Fairlie ; Mrs. George Turn- bull and two children ; Dr. and Mrs. King ; Mr. and Mrs. Radmalt and child ; Mr. and Mrs. Vincent and three children ; Captain R. Farrer and Son ; Dr. Barry, Master Finnasy ; Messrs. Holmes and Kliem, and two Masters Booth. CAPTAIN PATRICK, of the s.s. Keera, reports being unable to start at her usual time from Port Albert, owing to a severe gale from N.W., almost approaching to a hurricane, blowing down one house, several chim- neys, and doing other damage not ascertained. The following day wind moderated ; at eleven a.m. started for Melbourne. Four p.m., wind strong, increasing breeze, brought up in Waterloo Bay. Eight p.m., gale increased so much as to make the bay a perfect sheet of foam. Parted starboard chain. Left Water- loo Bay at ten a.m. following morning, with light N. E. breeze. When off Cape Paterson, at four p.m., wind suddenly shifted round to S.E., blowing a hurricane, with heavy sea and rain. Hove to all night. Passed Heads at daylight, and arrived at Queen's Wharf at half past eleven a.m. on Tuesday. NOTICE TO VESSELS EXEMPT FROM PILOTAGE.—Much inconvenience is experienced in consequence of masters of vessels arriving in port neglecting to hoist the num- ber of the port from whence they come, although such vessels may be exempt from pilotage ; and attention is called to the following regulation :—" The master of a vessel shall not be entitled to claim exemption from the payment of pilotage unless when within one league of the entrance of any port or harbour a signal be also hoisted in some conspicuous part of the rigging, accord- ing to the numeral pendant used for such purpose, in- dicating the port from which such vessel has arrived" (11 Victoria, No. 15, Sec. 3).—Sydney Morning Herald, July 1. WRECK OF THE SCHOONER PRINCE OF DENMARK.— From the information we were able to gather yester- day respecting the wreck of his vessel, it appears that she left Sydney about the beginning of February last, for one of the islands of the Chesterfield Group, on which is situated a whaling station. She was loaded with stores for this station, where she arrived about the 20th February. She had landed successfully nearly the whole of her cargo when, on the 19th March, during a heavy gale, she parted her cables and went ashore. In about half an hour scarcely a vestige of the vessel was to be seen. The whole of the crew with great difficulty succeeded in saving their lives by either swimming or floating on the debris of the wreck to the shore. On the second day after the wreck the weather became calm, and some of the island blacks, by diving, succeeded in bringing up from the wreck sundry small articles, among which were several of the carpenter's tools and a spy-glass, and one or two chests belonging to the seamen. As early as possible after the wreck the crew commenced the building of the little vessel which has brought ten of the crew safely from Brampton Shoal to Brisbane, a distance of about 600 miles—this voyage was com- pleted in eight days. The vessel, which was somewhat appropriately and good- humouredly named by the crew Hamlet's Ghost, is built partly from portions of tho wreck which were washed on shore, and partly from some boat planking which was brought from Sydney for the use of the station. She is built after the American style, and taking into consideration the difficulties under which she was constructed, she is a very creditable piece of work. She is cutter rigged, and we understand from the crew that she behaves well in a seaway ; her speed is not despicable, as may be ascertained by the quick run she made to this port. Eleven of the natives who were part of the crew of the schooner Prince of Denmark were left on the island with about eighteen months' provisions. Dur- ing the voyage of the Hamlet's Ghost to Brisbane, she experienced fine weather until nearing this coast, when she encountered strong southerly winds for the last two days. The crew had plenty of provisions during the whole of the passage. The following ves- sels were spoken :—The Eliza, brig (whaler), Captain Ormstalk, from Hobart Town, six weeks out and clean ; the American barque Eliza, from New Bedford, thirty months out, with 1,000 barrels of oil. This vessel supplied them with water and a quantity of provisions. The Offley, a whaler, Captain Robinson, from Hobart Town, two months out, and clean ; and the Bonnie Doon, Captain Wybrow, with forty barrels of oil, and in a leaky condition. We understand that the schooner Prince of Denmark was the property of Captain Bennet, and that she was built of British oak, as far back as the year 1789.—Queensland Guardian, 1st inst.
