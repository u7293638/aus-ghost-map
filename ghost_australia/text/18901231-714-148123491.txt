THE D?|NQ YEAR. A MIDNIGHT MASS. (LOSGFELLOW.) Yes, the Year is growing old, And his eye is pale and bleared ! Death, with frosty hand and cold, Plucks the old man by the beard, Sorely,—sorely' The leaves are falling, falling, Solemnly and slow ; Caw 1 caw 1 the rooks are calling; It is a sound of woe, A sound of woe! Through woods and mountain passes The winds, like anthems, roll; They are chanting solemn masses, Singing, " Pray for this poor soul, Tray,:—Pray! " And the hooded clouds, like friars, Tell their beads in drops of rain, And patter their doleful prayers ;— But their prayers are all in vain, All in vain ! There he stands in the foul weather, The foolish, fond Old Year, Crowned with wild flowers and with heather, Like weak, despised Lear, A king,—a king ! Then comes the summer-like day, Bids the old man rejoice ! His joy ! his last 1 O, the old man gray Loveth that ever-soft voice, Gentle and low. To the crimson woods he saith,— To the voice gentle and low Of the soft air, like a daughter's breath— " Pray do not mock me so 1 Do not laugh at me 3 " And now the sweet day is dead ; Cold in his arms it lies ; No stain from its breath is spread Over the glassy skies, No mist or stain! Then, too, the Old Year dieth, And the forests utter a moan, Like the voice of one who crieth In the wilderness alone, " Yex not his ghost! " Then comes, with an awful roar, Gathering and sounding on, The storm-wind from Labrador, The wind Euroclydon, The storm-wind ! Howl 5 bowl! and from the forest Sweep the red leaves away 3 Would the sins that thon abhorrest, O Soul! could thus decay And be swept away ! For there shall come a mightier blast, There shall be a darker day ; And the stars, from heaven down-cast, Like red leaves be swept away ! Kyrie, eleyson! Christe, eleyson 3
