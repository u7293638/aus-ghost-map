In the Argus he is reported to/tho. extent of nearly ten columns,'andthe town and country press all notice his deliverance .^'approvingly. There has been . no.

The] first of-the above-named sums- was thought to . be. a close approximation, to the true'value of the property by the /Audit Commissioners,- to whom it fcas referred.That did not) however, seem to meet the views-bf th'e Gotapany, who .;aet a much higher valu"e::.ou their property, and the negotiations frere endedj;- by. the Go vernment declining^to make' any .offer at pre- ( ; s.ent. Instead of buying "the.- Hobson's Bay Lines, the*' Engineer-in-Ohief proposed to have an; outer, circle rail way around Melbourne, and to spend the money- which would have been* absorbed in buying out the'Hobson's. Bay Com pany in a new central station for passengers for all the^ lines which now are or shall here after be built. This .scheme,,however, has not been.adopted.'on account of its expense.

In the matter of'seri culture, >you might do worse,-for Mrs. NeilL has just received highly complimentary' letters from England on the success of her efforts'; and what is more and better, has a fresh stock of Beed on the' way 'out.1 All honor .to the zeal which kindles with so much warmths in the bosom of :one i at her1 *time of life, when with others it begins to abate. ) ' ' Patrick -Coaday Buckley's will case,' whioh has now been before the Supreme Court here for some days, must be of soma interest to you, inasmuch.. £as; one > or two . South: Australians. •figure rather prominently in connection with it. Buckley'was a squatter, residing in Gippsland; at.Prospeot Station, and died.in,the early part of 1872, worth £80,000, intestate as. was sup posed,, and, the Curator took possession of his "estate. Now, however, one Thomas Maher comes forward with a will, executed so far back as 1817 by Buckley, in the presence of credible witnesses, Jin which the whole of Buckley's ;property is bequeathed to him and his "wife, and he' claims under it. Mr. Richard '.Holland, J.P., of Gawler, was a neighbor "of Maher and Buckley until 1843, and spoke positively, to'the genuineness of all the signa tures to the will, except Keighrell's, and that, afterrsome*consideration, he thought, must be right,' ' Johii ,' Nichols, a, . South Australian farmer and'winegrower, formerly a servant of "Maher, was present when the will was written by a* person named as Hopping Henii«ssy,i in Maker's house, in 1844, and remembered hear ing ikread out-both before and after signature. Maher had. since been residing in Kew South Wales,•" and did not hear of Buckley's death until lately, when he found that the will had been mislaid, and much time was lost- in the search-for- ifr.— At length it was recovered; however, and there really seems nothing what ever to throw a doubt on its authenticity,'or to stand diet ween Maher and the possession of Buckley's property, unless iq. be the discovery of another will, of which there is," it Beems, no probability. - • ^Diphtheria is still rife in.' Viotoria, particu larly in the country districts, and Mr. Great head's'.'sulphuric acid cure has been tried in some -cases, with great- success. [There has, in fact, been only two or'three reported cases of ifailhra^ahd in one or two of them the applica ble n had been, so, long delayed as to shut out all hope of recovery. Mr. Greathead writes to the papers to-sayi jhat-"tour:'<lrop3 of sulphuric' acidBhouldbe used in three-fourths of half pint of water:" but he "still abstains from stating what the'Strength of'the acid'should bei Probably -.-the ..ordinary . dilute- ..sul phuric; "aoid-of the; shops;; which, in that." quantity .of water would be tolerably, strong, yet not likely to be productive of harm,''if it didno, good;: Some of. the medical'- men- are said to be:using it'extensively, and speak highly of'its effects; . That, was, indeed, the case with many,; before Mr.. Greathead called attention to; it,, although not. in the . precise form pre scribed by that gentleman., Still'that does.not detract from Mr." Greathead's merits. He is entitled to the oredit of having brought it into general Use; I". How long' it will be before the papers cease to be filled with reputed cases1 of. " dummyism" it • is impossible to say; probably not while there is another^ acre of -land to be selected. But 'thsy have'been "unusually fall of" suclfre puted cases within the'iast week or 10 days, and "there.: mflst ^have been as much false' swearing about them as there" was in -the old time in England, when oaths were administered to kll sorts of people at every turn. Mr. Don raised himself, into notice' by taking up a stockwhip' and- saying .he' would drive the squatters across the Murray, and Mr. Casey is said-to have taken up the ghost of that whip, and to be Usingit as if he-had the same object in view. Mr. Casey goe3 to an immense deal of trouble-to-put down " dummyism," and-it must be added, in many - cases, with'-indifferent suc cess. -Yet he still sticks to it, and:he seems to have got on the right tack with- regard to "^dnmmyism" in the Wiinmera : and Stawell districts, . After all, the best- cure' for this is ; not'-' to • put temptations in people's way, : and these Mr. Casey- is ' rather in creasing- than.: diminishing. - The' cases now under investigation, or at least some of them, appear to be of a flagrant character, if we may judge'from the-evidence, arid it is-said to be the intention of the-Minister of Lands, where this violation of the law can he proved; not' only td-'neSnme -the-land taken up by the squatters' "servants "for the squatters'"use," but where the-law will warrant it, to doelare the squatter's own licericetobe forfeited", and to let out the land to others who -will be more law abiding and less ; rapacious. An immense deal nf evidence has been taken-at Stawell before a Commission of .Enquiry,- and -theuinvestiga tiojis have not yet terminated. .-J. ; jri The .following has been .found under thebiead or ''Criminal Trials" in the rules and 'regulk tiobs -drawn' up for ~ the1 guidance of colonial7 Governors,, and has been quoted-in- support of the) course adopted by Mr. -Stephen -mth regard to M-ounfcand Morris "Under the Aot 12 and il3jVio., cap, 96, all persons charged;in:any colony with offences committed oni the sea may be Jdealt with in.the same manner as if the offence had been committed on -waters within thd local :jurisdiction of the. Courts of; the colony." ; Whether, or not this: applies to the case mf Mount and Morris, -although it sup .posts Mr. Stephen's view on'-'that ' case; ■ is noij .very-- apparent. Another -portion-- of -these : regulations is,- however,-quite in point,' and -it^: would' appear that ithas ;to, a great exfenfclbeen acted .hpon.''- It-is-this Her Majesty's Government will be- ready to afford any information;, instructions, and advice for which the .Gbvernori ina^ think it-necessary to apply, whenever anjr question may arise m any orimibal proceeding in which there hiay be any spepial adequate motive for invoking..the inter. ference of Her Majesty's: Government: in.this colony." But then it is the Governor, it:seems, and not the Government, by whom" the" applica tion is tol be imadej aiid that, hardly 7 squares with -the notions entertained here by thcjse '.who take 'Mr. .Higinbotbam as their " guide,; philosopher, and friend" in the. relation of "the colonial to the Imperial autho rities. i -Wherel Mounti and . Morris. now arej is a matter of some doubt, some alleging - thsjt ..they haye;left the colony., byship, and, others that they are lying in.perdu not far from Melbourne, .-It-has even been said.that.a fresh. warrant; has been issued; for their reapprehen-. Bion,. but; this js stoutly denied. ;It is known; thajtthof Government have resolved on further steps, with a view, if possible, to vindicate the law, but the actual course intended is for. obvious reasons kept secret. ' 7 ; • (gratifying ^accounts are received from most quarters of the stafe of the growing crops. Ariund Melbourne the_ hay crops are particu larly Btrong and, healthy, but in some places the' " takeall" has appeared, and is doing much damage. Hay crops, which looked strong and 'healthy :a month or six weeks ago, have n!ow dwindled almostfco.npthing.. Where the sur -resnlt of my own observation. - The locusts are &tso; showing in some "places;'-but'-not to bitch an extent as was at one- time ^dreaded. 'Hojwever, the season for them is -yet young. ; | ^ukeris "said- to-beJ-Btill doiDg great1 mischief to the flocks in some! districts, and Mr. Thomas's fluke remedy is strongly recommended for it. 'That ia said tobe much better than salt,'a« the aheep. take to itj ik is added, quite as' readily," if not, indeed, more so.; In too many cases, however, sheepfarmers do not like to incur the •risk of being thought to be the possessors of unsound flocks, and have to pay the penalty of using nothing. ■ As Thomas's remedy may, how 'ever, .be .used as a preventive as well as a cure,. 'the'risk of a loss of reputation by its use is, one : would think, comparatively slight. Now that the distribution.: of tlie charitable vote—for which some better name should be found—has teen decided upon, it really seems strange that there Bhould have been all the un pleasant references there were to it in an earlier part of the session. Whether Mr. Langton had, dnring the long interval which has elapsed since the amount: ta he appropriated,-to that purpose this year: was iirst announced, suc ceeded in "nobbling" hon. members or not, there was certainly much less " scrambling" for portions of it for the several institutions in the country districts than might have been expected. There was, to be sure, a general wish-expressed by i some few- members, probably intended for • tbe ears of-their constituents, that the vote for their particular districts might be increased, whioh Mr, Langton somehow succeededin show I ing had" Been already, in most 'oases, antici pated. The total amount set apart for this put;" pose was £120,000; andalthoughit may notin terest your readers to know what was allotted | to each particular institution, legend the lis t, rather for. the purpose of ^p.on^eying' ah^idea" of; the number and extent 'of the "charitable in stitutions now; spread over; the.;cqlopy.: i.Eor i example : *— Hospitals —"Amhers'ti £1,859; Alexandra, £200; Ararat, £1,450; Ballarat, £4,500; Beeohworth, £3,000; Belfast, £750; Bendigo, £6,000; Castlemaine, £2,?#0; Glunes, £1,250; 0re3wick,!£l,0Q0; Daylesford,'£1,000; Dun oily, £2,000; Hamilton, £1,050'; Heath cote, £500Horsham, £500.; ..Inglewood, £2,000; Kilmore, £1,000; Kyneton, £1,100; Maldon, £450; Mansfield, £450; Mary borough, Melbourne, £15,000; Alfred Hos pital, Melbourne, £3,500; Lying-in Hos pital, Melbourne, £1,750;-.;;" Pleasant Greek, £2,300; Portland; £500' .Sale, ..£300; Swan Hill, £1,000; Upper Gouiburn, £950; Wanga ratta, £500; and Hospital for Sick'''Children,' Melbourne, £3,000.

Ear off as that may seem, itiwill yet come, and sooner than the people in the provinces either desire or expect.
