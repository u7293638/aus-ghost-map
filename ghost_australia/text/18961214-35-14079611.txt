AMUSEMENTS. 'O LYCEUM-" THERESE RAQUIN." Tragedy robbed of its crown and sceptre and presented under the meanest guise, Tragedy which shows us the mere physical terror of two murderers, destitute of any religious idea to lHBtify us in describing that terror as remorse composes the tissue of horrors entitled " Tberoso I require " However, Uns rcahsticdruma bears the impress of Emile Zola's genius The crescendo of horror that seems to culminate in the dreadful it adding night of the third act, but reaches a more terrible climax in the fourth, is graduated with ghost-like skill Mrs Potter and Mr Bellow play their parts in quite a new manner, throughout the first two scenes scarcely seeming to act in the conventional sense of the term Their style hero is veritably that of the natural school lately upheld by 31 Antoine at the Paris Theatre Libre Their acting of the two great situations is marvellously powerful, and Mrs Potter, it will be noted, entirely throws off polite comedy in order to assume the gait and manner of a milliner's girl Always perfectly natural and in character, Mrs Potter played the important part with restrained, impressive force Many of the audience were too crushed and appalled by the sordid tragedy to ap- plaud even at the close of the great scenes But the mass, of those present, recognising the supreme art of the stars, instated on calling them forward again and again There is, indeed, an infant yet result in the form of a girlish bridesmaid, cleverly played by Miss Pollie Emery, who makes one tremble Behind all is strange romance about malady as (< something sweet and terrible, like sailing on golden clouds to soft music," is certainly a knowledge of life that bears upon the nerves, and it is a relief to see that curious little girl off the stage Otherwise, the land is entirely engrossed by the sordid fascination of the story The dramatist points in with amplitude of detail the background of petty shop- keeping life in Paris necessary to give the tragedy its bourgeois atmosphere The old gossips who play dominoes as they talk their friendly nothings become at times tedious with their realistic twaddle Mme Barques has married her sickly, empty-headed son Camille to his beautiful cousin, Therese She will curse him so nicely, and also make the dear boy has Linseed tea is no little time Therese falls passionately in love with Laurent The same idea strikes the guilty pair when Camille proposes to row on the river at Saint Ouon In the second act, the family is in mourning for Camille, accidentally drowned at Saint-Saens. A year has passed Old Mine Raquin, who weeps and prays s daily for her lost Camille, now fears that her beloved Tuberose is dying of grief This abomin- able creature is in reality merely sick with a languishing desire for Laurent As an inspiration from above, the old mother lacerated her own heart to leave Therese, and urges her to marry Laurent The vile hypocrites reluctantly consent, and the bereaved mother blesses them At last the nuptial chamber. " At last, after working and waiting for this happiness for a whole year '" cues Laurent But there is no response from the woman Trembling, and icy cold, her fears infect the man, and the corpse of their victim rises like a spectre between them This ghastly scene brings Mrs Potter and Mr Bellew before us as great artists The forced and uneasy attempt to forget the crime in general conversation, the frenzies of fear into v, inch first one and then the other falls, the dreadful curiosity of the woman by which she forced her accomplice to describe the body at the morgue, all swollen, and the corners of the month twisted into a cheering smile, and the climax, in which the woman falls swooning to the ground, are so shown as to seize the spectator as if an icy hand were placed upon his heart The cold light of morning enters that frightful Wedding chamber " We have murdered Love," sighs Thereto, just as Macbeth once groaned that he had murdered Sleep But their stormy recrimination has alarmed the old mother She enters in time to hear their secret " Murderers '" she gasps, and sinks into a chair bereft of speech and motion, paralysed in every limb In the last act the domino polly goes on as lief ore, but old Mme Saqui, wheeled in ia her invalid chair, takes no part in it What thoughts revolve in the brain, still active in the dead body ' Only her eyes speak and the sight of those boobies at their game pretending to know " exactly what she wants, and giving themselves invitations to " come again next Thursday as usual," when the eyes are struggling to denounce the murderers, IB frightful But when the visitors have gone, Therese and Lau- rent enter upon their daily jangle, each trying to throw the blame of the curse upon the other Oh the agony of those moments for the speechless mother, as she hears every detail of the murder described Therese tortures Laurent to madness and delirium us she butes in his ear " You killed Camille " Suddenly the sullen, hang-dog Laurent loses his reason He imagines himself the murdered man Like a wild beast he chatters to himself, raves wildly, and falls to the ground Mr Fellow's achieve this point was in- describably strong and vivid Laurent determines; to poison his accomplice The paralytic woman by a superhuman effort jerks the knife from the table to the feet of Therese She seizes it to stab Laurent, and then to those silently accusing eyes that are ever upon them is suddenly added the light of joy Speech returns to the aged Medusa, and the murderers, as she proclaims their doom, commit suicide Apart from the extraordinarily realistic art of the principals, there was much to impress in Mrs. Walter Hill's well-studied conception of the help less, revengeful mother and Mr C M Berkeley's portrait of the sickly, chattering Camille was true to life Mr Wilson Forbes as Richards and Mr Olly Deering as Gave, the domino- players, were a trifle too noisy and laboured in their style for this curious piece, but were effective on conventional lines The farewell appearances will be continued by the revival of " The Lady of Lyons " on Wednesday, " She Stoops to Conquer " on Thursday, and " The Ironmaster " on Friday, with a special programme for Saturday.
