The Phantom Train. ————♦———— 'I believe in spirits and ghosts,' says a night watchman on the New York Central Railroad at Albany. ' I know such things exist. Come, the night of the 27th of April, and I'll convince you.' He then told of the phantom train that every year comes up the road with the body of Abraham Lincoln. Regularly, he says, on the night of the 27th of April, about mid- night, the air on the track becomes very keen and cutting. On either side it is calm and still. Every watchman when he feels this air, steps off the track and sits down to watch. Soon after, the pilot engine, with long black streamers and a band of skeletons with instruments, all playing dirges, grinning fleshless spectres sitting all about on the locomotive and the catafalque and funeral train, pass along noiselessly. The track ahead seems covered with black carpet, and the wheels are draped and muffled. There is no clatter. All about the coffin of the murdered Lin- coln, in the air, above the train and be- hind it, are numbers of blue-coated men in soldier uniform, some with arms, some with coffins on their backs, some leaning on them. ' It has al- ways seemed to us,' says the watchman, ' that all the vast armies of men who died in the war were there escorting that train.'
