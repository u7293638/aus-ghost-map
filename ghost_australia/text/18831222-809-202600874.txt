RAILWAY PATRONAGE. to tub editor olf iiik aok. Sin, — Your correspondent, Railway is led into error with regard to his remarks about the officials in tho Post Office. In the mall branch of that department the gazetted holidays are almost a dead letter, so far as tho majority of tho employis in that' branch is concerned,-1 tbo greater number of whom have 70, SO and HO hours to their credit for tho current year without the ghost of a chance of realising one duy on account. Your correspondent is also out with regard to the number of hours which coii.-itiuilo u day's work in the 14. P.O. In the department referred to it is no unusual thing to have to work 10 or 11 hours a day, aud without any consideration for the overtime. And as to the annual incro- mout, there are many who hare not as yet received that increase, although entitled to it since the commencement of the financial year, so that "Railways," and those for whom. ho writes, are not tho only employes who sutler in justice through tho mismanagement of some official or officials at the hood of affairs. — Yours, &c.;, MAILS.
