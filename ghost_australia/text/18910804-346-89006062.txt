AN EXTRAORDINARY SHOOTING CASE PLAYING THE GHOST. Last evening the police received informa tion that a youth named Peter Shenandorff had been treated by Dr. J. M. Eadie for gunshot wounds which he had sustained under somewhat peculiar circumstances. Plain-clothes Constables Davidson and Non- mus were " told off" to make inquiries, and the result of their investigations were that they proceeded to Mr. Smith's butchery establishment in Prowse's-road, and arrested a young man named George Ridley on a charge of discharging firearms with intent to do grevious bodily harm. Ridley was brought into the city and lodged in the lockup shortly before-midnight. Several different versions were given re- garding the occurrence, but so far as could bo obtained the facts are that for some time past the youths in the locality have been trying to frighten each other by wrapping themselves up in a sheet and playing the ghost. On Sunday evening about eight o clock three youth named Peter Shenan- dorff, a rag and bone gatherer residing in Havelock- streett, Long Gully, James Martin and Harry Gundry were standing in Prowso's road talking, when Ridley suddenly jumped out from amongst some bushes and fired off a pistol which was loaded with shot. Shenandorff was struck by the shot in the arm and thigh, while Gundry and Martin received injuries in the abdomen. Fortunately for Ridley, so far as can be said yet, none of the injuries are serious. The accused will be brought before the City Bench this morning, when in all pro- bability the police will apply for a remand to enable them to produce evidence in the case.
