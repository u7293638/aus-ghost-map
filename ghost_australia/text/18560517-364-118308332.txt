MA IT LAND. (From the Maitland Mercury.) MAITLAND SCHOOL OF ARTS. At the fort- nightly meeting on Thursday evening, Mr. Sinclair gave an essay on "Spirit Rapping." After a few remarks upon the debateable nature of the subject, he proceeded to show the different tests which had been applied to it in England, some ascribing it to disease, to mono- mania, spectral illusions, mental illusions, &e;, But he argued that they could not be brought to bear upon the subject. Many of the wisest men have tested it in a great many ways, and were perfectly bewildered, and the only con- clusion that could be arrived at, was that the sounds were occasioned by mysterious agencies. Having explained the subject of the "mediums" of whom he asserted there were 30,000, and through home the spirits wore supposed to communicate with a man in the flesh, he pro- ceeded to show the manner in which the com- munications were made, and adduced several amusing and wonderful incidents as convincing truths. He contended that imposture was out of the question, as it was impossible that so many thousands who have been acted upon by it but that one of them would "blab," besides that it was against reason that so many would join in a trickery; and then were not to reject it because we could believe, saying these things happen in America, and why not here, as an oyster might, if told that there was a sun, say "1 don't believe it, I never heard of it before.'" In the debate which followed several of the speakers ascribed it to mental illusion, a dis- eased mind, all of them agreeing it was a species of humbug. In the course of the dis - cussions several laughable ghost stories were told, and after an animated discussion a vote of thanks was given to the essayist, and the meeting separated.
