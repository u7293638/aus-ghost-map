THE FEDERAL PLOT The Labour squares are forming ; The Labour Parties grow ; From every plundered province We soon will have to go. Have we no tricks remaining ? Is all our hocus spent? May we demand no Jonger Our Interest and Eent 1 Born thralls of our dominion, Ye lawyers of our train, Can ye not weave a method To rob them of their gain 1 Can ye not sweeten bondage With Democratic pap, Or bait with Forms of Freedom A constitution-trap? Persuade them sign the contract Before they've read it through ; We'll coronet your women, And judgeships give to you. ♦ * * Well done ! Elected Houses And votes. that equal seem Will make them think it's */i«-Bill, That they shall be supreme. The name, too, ' Federation,' Of comfortable sound, » Will drve their drivelling legions Imploring to be bound. You've guarded well our bastions With deep and bridgeless moat ; You've given us the whip-hand. In veto, tax, and vote. You've made them choose our minions ? To mutilate their rights ; Surrender all they've bled for In Armaggedon fights, In new vice-regal velvet You've wrapped a Csesar's paw ; You've perched upon their Future The Vultures of the Law. Heed not the ghosts of ' Judas' That dog you while you live ; For coronetted women And judgeships fair we give. Tocsinger.
