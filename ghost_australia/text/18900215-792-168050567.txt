DIOCESE OF BALLARAT. {From our own Correspondent? The College of the Holy Ghost resumed work, after the Christmas recess, on last Tuesday. A good number of new boarders and pupils hare entered. The Very Rev. Fr. Refte, C.SS.Sp. (the president), is assisted by Frs. Brennan Carey, Croagh, and Smidth, of the . Congregation, and a number of lay professors and masters. Tbe usual monthly meeting of the Christian Doctrine Society was held on last Sunday evening, after Vespers.- I may mention that this society has a good library, and that the members have the privilege of borrowing books free of charge. Non-members can borrow books by paying one shilling a month. Considerable progress has been made by the committee in connection with the 8 ports which are to be held on the Miners' Racecourse, Redan, on St. Patrick's Day, under the auspices of the H.A.C.B. Society (No. 2 branch). A programme has been drawn up, and the attraction will be equal to anything offered on former occasions. The proceeds are to be applied to the support of the Catholic schools of Ballarat. In the evening there will be a grand concert in the Alfred Hall, and as the committee have secured the services of some of the leading professional musicians and amateurs, it is expected that it will be a great success. A meeting of the committee re the erection of a house for the widow Whelan, whose dwelling got burned down on New Year's Day, was held on last Monday evening. It was resolved that, in order to supplement the amount expected to be received by the concert which is about to be held, a public subscription be made.
