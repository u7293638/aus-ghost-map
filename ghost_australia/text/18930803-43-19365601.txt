Then ho remembered Vane's singular melancholy, his li'iis reveries, thisso broken dreams and sudden exclamations. They were all explained now. What had ho deno ? Of what crime had he been guilty? Was it murder? Tit- thought was horrible to bo tho bond friend of a man who. perchance, hid the stamp of Cain upon him. To livo in tho sumo tent, to cat. talk at tho snmo board tm-ethcr as if that secret had not be.— ' The doubt was in itself more thnn mere pain to tho mind of the cultured youn-; Englishman. _ What then should ho do? Give him «p—send information to Melbourne? "No!" Fenton lay hack in his chair, it li;lit glaring in his ryes. " Not mine tliefiniier to bo pointed at him," ho said. " Of whatever he lie guilty. I cannot for ccc that t'w.ia ho who nursed me back from tho threshold of death to life. Jul-e not. So be it." One day when tho young Englishman liad smwn well and strong, and whilo this Titori Valley rang with the sound of hamner and pick and cradle, Vnno came into the tent "here his comrado was pro raring the mid-day meal, with a pale face knd a etagjoring pail. " You are ill, dear Vane," cried his friend. " >S'u. Let mo rest quietly a moment," snd when he had rested he said, " shako hinda, Howo. Fortune has smiled upon ua at last." Th_ young digger star.-* at his mate in nervous excitement without a word in reply, hut there came an idea into his minil that Vane is in one of his moods again. i'or l"n_ and weary months these two men have fought a stern tight with for tune for a slico of her favors. With that f'vrisli hope, which gives us both etron.th and courage to gold-seekers, th-;y had toiled and endured privation of .in ordinary kind. D-ggcrs each side of their., ami round and abiut lliem had f.ntiiil the precious ore almost without an ct-ort. but to them, work as they un_ht, success seemed to mock at them. Fortune had come at length, however. ss Vane had said, and, morcver, had tliowe-cd her favors in such vilnablo quantity and quality on our two friends tint ir.nn henceforth they need toil and moil aid starve no more. Tu.n Vano told how he had found a prmli;.'ii.us nugget—found it at the point ot lis pick when abou«. to leave work for limner—a lilije lump of shining gold, winch taxd'all his strength to removo fr.im in bed.

Fenton Howe nvmed in no hurry to depart. •"In a ceriain lovely night after dinner, tnd while the pair enjoyed their cigar.. Temple Vane broke tilenco on the sub ject. " When do you intend going honjc, my \--v Howe 1" he said. D-ar H„» a takes tho cheroot from be tween his teeth and laughs.

" Just «o. , I could not go en dcthabik to ll:s people whose n.tuct I have men tioned." " You have not mentioned any names yet," erica Yanc, interrupting. " True, old fellow. L~t iii- see," and llowo fumbles in tho recesses of .his packet book, and draws forth two very tattered missives. " Toil liavo heard of M ijor Woldon, of Pinefalls," ho siys.

What is it, dear friend 1" ho cries, rising. " It is nothing," mutters Vane, totting hit cignr away. " I am not much of a smoker, and that weed ia a very b_d one, that's nil. You were saying—" "Look hero, Vano," say* tho young Englishman, abruptly, laying his hand on tlio other's arm, and which causes his friend to look attentively at him. "See here,- old follow, we have snllored much together, }-ou and I, and I feel I have some right to know what makes you >o moodly betimes without any apparent cause, .ounoi you trust mo ? lam a gcntloman, and, moreover, Ido not ro i|uest you to confide in me, out nf mero idle curiosity. I must remind yon that you saved my life, and 1 am longing to pay my debt with interest." Temple Vane laughs. "My dear Howe, you aro full of crochets to-night. Bo lievo me, there's nothing the matter be yond a fit of indigestion. Melancholy usually marks mo for her own, after din ner. I feel lam not much of n com panion for you a; nny time, but I have done my best not to bore you altogether when thct'i fits are upon me. If, as yon say I have duno you a sorvice, you can repay mo by having compassion on on unfortunate dyspeptic by altogether ignor ing his oddities." " J will try. Vane," replies Howe, with an impatient gesture " But answer mo one question—were you ever in doubt ?" " About whom" " Any of your friends, for instance.1' "Make tho question a personal one, and say Fentou Howe."' " Very well. Fcr example—say you had n doubt respecting Fenton Howo— that lie was not what he teemed—a scoundrel for inslanco, or may be some thing worse." "It is not possible I could fancy my friend a scoundrel." " But if you had a tormenting doubt that he was 1" erica the other in persistent tones. Temple Vano turns his ptlo face to wards tho speaker with a shade of sur prise in his grave eves. " Deubt has slain some of the noblest of mankind." he f tya, softly. *• The glorious intellect of tho immortal Shakespeare gathered all the forces of its potent power to cronte a Desdcmona. Why? To thnw that doubt in the person of tho noble Moor, cruelly murdered her. Doubt it ono of the most teiriblo weapons iv ihe armory of the principle of evil. It do> s not kill j in fair and open conduct, hut crawls like n inidni_.it thief to its victim. Had I a doubt respecting my friend, hit n.lio.t. ' should bo both judge and jury, and he should ttand or fall on these alone with " You aro right, Vane, give me your hand,'* and Fentou Howe's eyes are moist with emotion. Timt night Vane lay awake tormented with troubled thoughts, but the young Englishman slept well, and dreamed of the pig hunt on the morrow. CHAPTER jll.. A TIG HUNT. The native settlement of Slxketu, on the Bay of Plenty, Tnuranga, consisted of about fifty wharves, the vails and the roof being built of a thick anbsUnce called A*i A*i, which is manufactured from the native flax, and is impervious to the fierce and constant winter rains. Theso huts aro scattered over a fino patch of clearing about three hundred acres in extent, and sheltered by the Tonga Peak Mountain. The ptaee fwarmed with dogs of al most every kind of mongrel; and the pack came barking and snarling round the heels of our two friends, JJowe and Vane, as they made their way through the village tbe morning following the events of our last chapter. Te IJunns, Uio Maori chieftain, came forth to meet them, clad in his huntine toga of brown mica flax, his head adorned with a large toho feather. The Maori was surrounded by tventyof his warriors, all ready armed for the fray. Tjuranga smarms with wild pics, and a pig hunt is n favorite pastime with tbe Mayri when he is not at war with his neighbor* or the Pakehas. The native uses neither horse nor hound •n this psstime ; indeed, the rocky coun try where tht> porkers are mostly found) will not admit of it. All that jj required aro sound lungs and a swift pair of heels.' After partaking of the chiefs hospi tality, which was not much to the taste* of the young men, the party, with several dogs, headed for Tonga I'cak, where game was to be had in plenty. ; Temple Vane nnd his companion were both/armed with i» dotihle-barrei)ed rifle, and most of the Manries carried fowling pieces. ' It proved no child's play toiling; up the it B? side of the mountain, where there was no regular path, aave that made by the Manries with their tomahawks. GUtno on noon the party emerged uj>on a patch of thick.scrub, and here the chief called a halt. Dividing his men into two divisions tho-Maori dispatched one part to the eastward, and turning to Vane and Howe lie pointed out a dump of gigantic kMTipiM*-, m 4 ftrawmft tt adrttor, *•■•'• , .' ■ As wo drew near the snot indicated the country aiirnnmdhig becamo broken and irrcß'iltr. Hugh k.iuri pino trees, tome rising to a hcigth uf ono hundred and sixty foet.grcw nlniost »ido by side, with thick coils of tho New /.calami crecpor— tupplo j«ck—cnrlcd and entwined about their broad truukt and branches, and descending thenco In the ground again like ropea dangling from the span of a stranded -hip. At length thoy entered a flat apaco where tho undergrowth wnj very rank and luxuriant; Hero the chief halted, and directed our two friends to accompany two of hit men to a tpot lower down. O:io of the warriors could speak a little English. " You know how to catch pig ?" said ha to Howe. " No; I havo nevor taken part in a pig hunt .ffore." " Ah, rakoha toon lee." Ho dived suddenly into a thick copse "f ferns, nnd laying dowii upon hit face, began making a succession of grunts and squeaks so imil..tiYi>iy true to the noises made by tho porcine specios that Vano instantly brought hit gun to his shoulder for a shot. The Maori laughed.- queer noiseless laugh at thu P.ko.ia't mis nko, nnd again repeated the sound?. : " Pig, him sly follow; smoll Pakoha," taid tho savage, with a grin. "Maori mor 1 ily tlisn pig. Him no likb Maori, not n liitlo bit. Maori fond of pig." And lie laughed again, but no sound fol lowed. .  ■ ■ ZZ ;■- - >• ' Vano nnd Howe crouohed down besido their swarthy companions for tome time, when gradually they bocame cognisant of a low rustling sound some distanno away. The Maori ce.iscd his mimicry, and looked up with an intelligent glance. Presently tho sounds crow nearer, ac companied by hoar-o grunt-, and im mediately five or six full groan pigt, headed by a fierce- looking boar with long projecting tutkt, earco bjunditic forth, and. breaking cover a. tho tight of tho hunters, fled twiftly out into tho more open bush land, and in a lino almost with tho chief and his men. Hero one of tho dogs broke from the party, and the frightened pigs, catching tight of him, wheeled half round, nnd scampered away in another direction. Tally-ho 1 The chato began. Pakehat, Maories, nnd dogt were in full cry. - . Over fallen logs, nnd over deep ereeki and gullies went the game, screaming with rage and fright. "Th? dogs, with gaping mouths, stretched tilVmsolvei out after their prey; whilo tho Maoriet, in frantic deli.ht, leaped high in tho nir, uttering their torriblo bit'lo cry, their features distorted, and clearing apace with their tomahawks at every bouod. Tally-ho 1 over boulders, massive ar,d fantastic in shape, and standing like hugo giants to bar the pursuers course ; over sharp jutting rocks and across deep chasms, where one false ttcp would have boon sudden death, Maori and P.tkeha running and shouting, yelling and laugh ing, their breath going aud coming in short gasps, each is striving who thall be first in tho exciting raco. Tally-ho 1 through swamps and bog went thogrunters for dear life, thoirlong snouts covered with foam, their hair bristling like quills upon tho fretful por cupine. The swiftest dog was within a few foot of the Hniennost porker when the boar turned at bay, and with ono sweep of hit sharp tusks inflicted a wound which totally disabled the poor bruto. Onward yet 1 The chase is now going at a slower rate, and the dogs are fast gaining on their pray. T* Hunna is lead ing the van, and teems lo have plenty of "stoy "in him yet: Vane is next, strug gling like n second Doerfoot for the lead ; llowo is half a mile away in the rear, pulling and blowing like a whale, and gesticulating like a madman. Tally-ho 1 A Mtori pig hunt it a hno thing to lest the soundness of one'i lunss. At the bottom of a d»cp ravine tho pigs were run down, and the tinal ttruggle be tween them and tho dogt took place One couragcont hpite, a large dingo, teizeil the boar by the throat, and in tpito of tßvtral wounds held on to lijs. prov until Te Hunna came up, who, with one blow of his keen tomahawk, aplit tho boar's skull in twain. Another do; caught a porker by the ear, and there held him until he wat secured and finally despatched by ono of the -Maories. A tine plump pis tried to hide itself behind a mass of rock that opened out to thu hill above, but Temple Vane brought him down with a clever shot that won the goodwill of the chieltnin. After tho pigs had been despatched the Mnoriet bled and dragged them to tho creek clo.o by, where they wore thorough ly cleansed. The butchering then b?gan, and llowo noticed the Maoriet carefully examined the liver of each pig. He enquired tbo cauiF, and waa informed that a filthy disease it prevalent among the wild piga of the Northern Island, and that the only way of detecting thoqe diseased it by pntulrv white tpots bvor the surface of the liver. A great crowd awaited vi at the Maori villace on our return with the game. Te Hunna insisted on Vine and hit com panion dining with him off tho spoil, and remaining with him at the Jlaptt that night. To give the dinner more tuuo the chieftain tent an invitation to the mission ary of the . place—Hatker Bell— who joined the party forthwith, together with hit assistant, Burke Brady by name, a>id the smallest, yet, withal, the merriest and mott antic anrite for an adult in the colony. Hit br-gue ra most refrethins, tnd hit stories both original and laugh able in the extreme. This comical little joker kept the com pany iv excellent humor until the small hours of morning, and when il was day he proposed to snow our friends the Hot Springs in the vicinity. The offer was accepted b,y our two friends, who, after ihey had indulged in the luxury of a plunge' into the river and had breakfasted, started off to (Irak Hini on foot, accompanied by Burke Brady, who acted as guiije," together »*ith Mr Bell and Te Hunna'. ...'.. Z. ' ; A dense fog lay upqi) tj)e Woptato as they started; they had toioral milos to walk, but ' before tbey had completed their journey the thick mitt had vanished beneath the beams of the sun, and now, what a sight.; In .wilt course, forming rspidt after rapids, the ; Wail—to , waa plunging through a deep valley between steep rising mountain! ; -its floods, whirl ing, and foaming round two email rocky islands in the middle of tbe river, were dashing with a lotd uproar through the defile of the valley. Along its banks white clouds of a 1 earn were ascending from hot cascades filling jnto t||'e river, and from bt|ius fill) <|f boiling water thut in by a v hite mats of stone. Yonder a steaming fountain wis rising and falling; now th-ro sprang fr-uu aiuthor placn a second fountain ; this also cessed in its turn ; then t«o cum menced playing timultaneoutly, one ma%fi low at the river tank, and the othtr op poiiu ayw__mw. aaa tim •_• play continued with endless changes, a* though experiments were being made with grand waterworks to tee whether tho waterfalls hail % sufficient supply. llowo began to count tho pltcci where a boiling water basin was visible or where a cloud of tteim indicated tho existence of such, but the}' becamo to intcrntiaiglad within his vision that he wat unable to turvey them accurately; Tho region of springs extend., along tho rivor a distance of about a milo on both banks, tho larger portion of them being aituatcd unon tho right bank. It in, however, difficult of access, since the rapid stream cannot bo patted close by the springs themselves, but only far above or below, and then it would bo necessary lo climb along tho steep sloping river banks, covered with denso undergrowth, where tho traveller, upon a toil totally noftoncd by hot vapours, would bo ovory moment in danger of sinking into boiling mud. Tho party wore obliged lo content thomsclvot with a closer inspection of the springs situated on tho left river bank. Tlio largest is called by the native! Puia-Tb-Muni, and is closo by tho bank of tho river. ■■■■'"' . ' Tho manner in which they practically experienced tho intermittent properties of thit fountain proves sufficiently how much caution is necessary in approaching snch sprinss fur tho first time. Burko Brady, diadaining tho warning- of Mr Bell, and wishing to enjoy the luxury of a bath, plunged into' the stream; ; when suddenly loud detonations wuro heard, and they saw tho water madly boiling up in a basin .lose by. ; Brady atartcd back again in terror, and gained the bank just in time to escapo a thowor bath of boiling water, fur now, amid hitting and roaring, a ttc-ming water column wat being ejected from the bum in a slanting direc tion, and to tho hoight of about twenty feet- When the shower had subsided we 'stepped up to the btsin and found it empty, and were ablo to look down to a depth of eight feet into a funnel thsped, gradually contracting. aperturo, from which' tteam etcaped with a hitting noiao. Gradually tho water rose again, and after thu lapso of a fe.v minutci the Second eruption took placo. Orakhini proved very interetting to them, apart from the many material curios in its neighborhood. Through the influonce of Mr Bell and Te Hnnna, they had an opportunity of witnessing the Maori—i at work, makingrugt and matt. The flax plant grows most abundantly in every part of the Waikato. To the native it lias proved tho moat useful plant in tho whulo vegotable kingdom, both socially and pecuniarly; from it the Maori builds and ornaments his whare, manufactures hit clothing, and it is alto ono of the best paying commodities of barter between him and hit Pakeha brother. Ba growth ii very rapid, tho stalk shooting to a height of ton to twclvo feet, tho apex being crowned by pale yel low blossom, Which has a pretty appear ance while in flower. In a valley to the rear of tho settlement wo found tho -taories employed on a plantation of flax. He.. were a dozen dark forma uf both texes squatting in a clnstcr cutting down tho broad blades ; others were conveying it in bundles to a third party seated on tho bank pf the river; the latter wore engaged splitting the loaf and stripping off.'to inner fibre with mussel thells—a rather peculiar and dexterously managed process, almost impossible for any but the Maorics themselves to execute with suc cess. Tho fibro produced from the loaf it white in color, and is remarkably sift nnd silk-like to the touch. Burke Brady took a leaf of it to make a whip for a Maori child ; ho cut it across, and then stripped off the inner fibre by merely pressing the end of his thumb along it. Tho missionary informed them that the soft substanco thus produced is called muka, and when dried and nssortod is used in making the most luxurious mats and nntivo apivuul. " But you shall see them at work in the Eaitaka whare," aaid he, leading tho way to a long shed situ ated on the rising ground ahnve the flu bush. This building was closo upon _ Inquired feet long, with, a, corresHittdiug width, and coiilainod alkiut fifty native women and girl- in groups of five and six, busily employed >n tho various stages of rug making, llore w-ire a group platting the pnrcrti, a very ■ common mat. only u.ed at tloorcloth. Tho material u-ed was com posed of unscraped flax split into narrow bands and closely woven togethor. When finished it presented a glossy straw-like appearance. Tl-ey alto make the whole paraphernalia ol platta nnd dishes in use at tho Hapu out uf the aame substance. The next party were engaged on tho htro. This wat manufactured with scraped (lax, tho machine used for the process somewhat ■ resembling a harp After it came from this rude appliance the mat was ornamented with various dyed las'- Tho dyes of different colora aro obtained with little trouble from the bark of trees in the vicinity. "The rug ma.t most, T*?He^ *V 'he Maories," said, the nptsimviTy, "is. the Kaita,."' This, is vjoven of tl\e vojy finest white muca, and is notsuUied by any tag 6f ornament, except a border about a foot in width of a different color. The border is black at a rule, cxeopt when the sots of parallel zigzag linet and the spaces bo tween them are left white, thut forming a beautiful article. Speaking a few words in tho Maori language to a grey-headed old chief who accompanied them, Mr Roll conducted them to a lipr of shelves, Bcreeped by thick mats, at the other end of the wharo.' Here were piled up co«tly rugs and dresses, fancy articles in mat ting, and a host of brilliant colored trifle* intended for the Auokland market. The chief unfolded one splendid rug that es pecially attracted their attention. It was at large at one of our railway wrappers, dyed black, and with a soft velv.t like shade, its only ornament a white circle in the centre, about the six; of a dinner plate. Howe held it in his hinds admir ing its' beauty, when Brady, ■_ who an standing at hit tide, nisei hold of it, and throwing it oyer' hit juqy form, strode majestically up and down the ' shed like a.Ugekinff.
