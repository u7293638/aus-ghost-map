The Right Man FOR the Right Place. Happy Paterson ! It has sent two hundred and eighty electors to its polling- place, and they have returned a Brown ! one of the Browns ! one of that family — with or without the e — whose name, alas, is so seldom met with, but who start up here and there, like grim ghosts of the nast, to defeat the machinations of the cunning. Who knew Brown ? Echo answers — the Paterson only. There are now four Browns in the House — almost as many as the six Eich- monds of the vision-seeing Eichard. . Brown, of the Paterson, is the fourth leaf of this shamrock. If report speaks true, Brown's object in going into Parliament is for the purpose of getting a Government billet. Happy Brown, if he thinks he may get it. Mr. Punch wishes it, with all his heart — because, if it is so, Brown adds another to the happy band of patriots that enter the House for the same purpose, but who haven't the courage to say so, and who appear perfectly astounded if an appointment is offered, or even hinted at, to them or their relations, and become so confused that when a divi sion takes place in the House they actually find themselves — to the amusement of everybody — voting with the very men against whom they had for weeks been declaiming. Happy is the Paterson that has a Brown to represent it, and raise it to honour in his own person when it is moribund. For doomed it certainly is. What business in any list of electorates has a Paterson that numbers less than five hun dred electors, and can send only two hundred and eighty to the poll ?
