How could I arm myself against unknown dangers ? I stopped abruptly and tearing the message which I still held in my hand into a dozen . pieces, I' flung it carelessly into the gutter ; I would not, I determined, trouble rafy head any more about it. I would instead devote all my thoughts and all my energies to the. unravelling of my own terrible puzzle. But stay, had the clue to that puzzle already been placed in my hands, and bad: I unwittingly despised it ?

' I was- depriyedi,byI',one,;fen'!8trbkeivof ' f riendB, name, position, and personality. . Unless I could regain :the- memory of my own past existence, I must be of all men. the most miserable. How had I lost that memory ? Could - some strange mental metamorphosis have taken place in me irithin- the; last 'fouf-and- twenty , hours I Could memory alone; have been paralysed while n:y intellectual powers remained untouched,? . Cou||d v mine be a new; soul inhabiting an unfamiliar body, or bad I been the victim of'some hideous jugglery? Who -was the man that had. hailed, the cabman 1 Could he have drugged and, possibly, robbed me ? Could it be that my memory was lying dormant, needing only some kindly ray from the past to awaken gone for evermore ? Could any doctor aid. me to recover it ? Had any ever met with a aimilar. case- to- mine 1 I started to .'my feet with the intention of consulting the nearest physician ; but as I remembered the hdpelesa i° difficulty' 'oi making ; iny j,tory icleaVi even to the most sympa thetic of medical men, I Bank back again' on the Beat.. -I should, very probably, bo deemed a madman, and handed over to the care of the nearest authorities. Dr. Malchi, thank God, had hot questioned my sanity. He had, after all, acted towards me with far more consideration and kindness than I might have reason ably expected to receive from a sl.ranger. He had not, apparently, doubted the truth of my story, neither had he shown any mortifying surprise at it. He had, in spite of my impatience and petulance, treated me with marked courtesy. I would, I silently determined, remember for the future the claim, he held on my gratitude. I mused thus for several hours. People strolled and gossipped near ma, and several eyed me curiously ; but, after my first quick glance at their faced, I heeded them not. Little' children laughed and played around me, but when one of them chanced to, gaze i . at me with innocent inquieitivenoaa I turned morosely » way from their wondering eyes... *I^-a- man; grown— envied the little children their happy- memory of the sunny years through which they hadalready tripped. ; Presently 'brie of them— a dimpled golden haired fairy1— timidly touched my hand. : .

I retraoed my stepa accord ingly, -but as ! I turnedintoCheaterfield Road, - a curious horror concerning my; parposed re-entrance into J)iel Malchi's, jabpde took possession of me. I tried to fight: against it, buf once, twioe, thrice my feet almost involuntarily carried me past the door which had been so mysteri ously closed in my. faoe. Some presenti ment of future ill seemed to warn me from again crossing ita threshold. 'Flee, flee, while yet there is time,' a voice seemed to whisper in my ear, but common sense forbade me to listen to it. Dr. Malchi had surely shown himself to be my very good friend. How could I be bo base, so ungrateful, as to ignore his past kindness, and, for no reason at all, cut myself adrift from the only man who, as it were, formed the connecting link between m y past and present ? Beside, the mysterious message had hinted of the existence of a friend as well as an enemy beneath (prcsumably)that roof. Whether, therefore, Dr. Malobi was my friead or foe, I would not prove indifferent to my own future welfare by neglecting to avail myself of any chance, however remote, of regaining my lost memory. ''-?? \- I turned resolutely on my heel, and, walking boldly up the whitened steps, rang the bell with a steady 'h'andT ? ' . Tho door was immediately opened by the dumb woman. She did not show, any surprise at seeing me, but curtseying deferentially, at once led the way into a largo and handsomely furnished drawing-; room, ,...' It waa untenanted, and,: after wheeling, an inyitinglpoking easy chair {toward! me, she noiselessly disappeared. V j ( 'This ( woman certainly was not the .writer of the - myatorious message,' I ithough't; ' half laughingly, an i' flung jmyself wearily into the chair; I had been a fool to credit * her, even in my romoteBt fancy,; with it.

'Regina, you will, for my sake, I hope, honour ;thia gentle man with your friendship.' I hardly noticed th » dexterous way ia^ which Dr. Malohi had overcame the difficulty of not addressing me by name. My eyes, my thoughts were wholly fixed upon the woman standing before me.' I have said that she was beautiful, but how can I describe her rare loveliness ? If T catalogue her starry midnight eyes, her wealth of raven hair, her perfeot features, her peaoh-like complexion, her rounded figure, and her stately height, I shall have drawn but a vague portrait of Regina Latimor. . I cannot pourtray tbe mingled passion and Bweatness which lurked in her dark orbs any more than I can the varying expression of , her haughtily beautiful face. Regina she.w*a; indeed-dghtly named. She was, verily a, queen amongst women. ? ' . .: : i atood looking almost stupiduy at her for some moments after my host had taken his place, and not until he somer. what significantly bade ^rne seat myself *! did I awake to a aense rof my own tin pardonable rudeness. Deeply ashamedX sank into my allotted seat, and vainly ?trove to recover thie composure I had jo strangely lost. . Dr. Malchi discoursed .as fluently, at :diriher as he' had' at, breakfast, 'but'hil witty pleasantries.repeived but. scant en-: courageraent from either of his compan ions. Mi'bb Latimer looked' more like* beautiful statue than a Hvirig woman. ' Sh« barely lifted her eyes from 'her plate, ? and replied only In monosyllables to the few remarks I dared address to her. Once, and once only, did I see her glance towards me and the momentary .interest the glance betrayed mystified rather than flattered me-rit was to. strange, a .blend ing of iioornful curiosity ' and con, temptuous pity. I smarfed aa mnnh beneath it as if it had been an unexpected lash from a hidden whip. And yet I felt that her contempt was' not so hard to bear as her indifferenco w?ujd hive bben. ' '; ' The doctor did not ailude in any way to the extraordinary oiroumstanca under which I had become and remained his guest, ., I wondered how muoh, or how little, Miss Latimer knew of my singular history.'
