It was of much interest because it was the commencement of a new step forward in the spiritual progress of that growing important place For some time there had been a small price of worship in which the Church of England competition him assemble- but for two or three Mars rust it had been projected to build a more suitable church than that rare dv in existence The steps which were taken in furtherance of that object had so far progressed that those present had met together that day to commence the building of a church that should be suitable to tin dish- trict that was suitable to its appearance, arrangements, and proportions It was true that it was only a portion of the church which it was intended at first to erect that they were about to build, but it would be capable of enlargement, and when completed, would hold about 4.0 persons He liked to look forward to the progress of the church in every parish, and as there were signs of material process all along the line from Sydney to Parramatta, he thought they were quite justified in considering, and makes provision for those who would come there in the future as well as those who existed at the present time. He had seen many instances of (homeless erected which, in the course of a few years had become too small for the play -in which they were built, but it was hoped that proper r j 1 n\ 1 ton had been made with regard to the dimensions of the structure which was about to be raised the importance of the present occasion arose out of the met that they were building a house for the war ship of Almighty God trio Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost, and he would like that ussenil Iv to be in a much that that was one of the great objects for which they built churches-that God might be worshipped, ona 11 sides that that His word minute be preached, and that pure and pi aver might attend to Him who was our God and Father through Jesus Christ our Lord In addition to the preach- ing of the word there would be the administration of the Holy Sacrament and the assembling to, either of God's people for mutual edification and encourage mint in Christian progress. And seeing that the building was one in which those objects would be advance 2, he considered that a very important step was now being taken in the bay ing of the foundation Mono A material church, like a spiritual church, was intended to be a witness for God in the pla r in which it existed building Fit it n for the special honour and glory of God It was 11 testimony for Hun in the land and if that building was a Christian church it was a testimony in favour of our Chi distrust), and when connected with the Church of England it was a testimony of the doctrines and discipline of their own beloved Church to her people and to others who might become acquainted with the principles which she taught And he did think that it was very important, for the real process of this colony, that churches should be thus multiplied as rapidly as it was found to be prudent to do so It was desirable that immigrants and other persons who came to the various parts of the colony, should find that witness in existence, and be led to see that there was a minister who was trying to instil into the minds of the people a truly Christian Brant, and that the Church was really endeavouring to advance the glory of God, and the moral and spiritual welfare of mankind Where no such witnesses existed religion died out, and people who had received a ligious impressions in their youth after a time were not influenced by them He had often visited cures where he was told that beyond a certain boundary there was no Sunday but he was glad to say that its the churches had been multiplied, and ministers bent to minister in them, Christianity had been pushed forward, and had spread her bungil influences far and wide They know too how great was the danger of people losing their religious pi maples and religious activities even III places such as that if there were no < nurse in it. He thought that therefore they should greatly value churches which had such a beneficial effect upon the people as he had alluded to And he true ed that the building of which the foundation was no ' being commenced would be productive of much good to the township of 61 linville He trusted that the salvation purchased by the blood of Christ would be proclaimed in that building and that there would be a power for good emanating from that church and influencing the lives of all the residents of Granville They should remember that the great object of building that church was the spiritual welfare of mankind. A Christian congregation in form war of little value unless it were productive of a higher life and of calling forth spiritual aspirations, spiritual prayers, and spiritual praises, by all of which God would be glori- fied How 112 very thankful to find that so much had been done already in the way of obtaining, means by which that building should be carried on He noticed that it was stated in a circular which he had, that whilst the total expenditure would be nearly £2000, the sum of 640 had been received, and a further sum of £315 promised, leaving a probable indebtedness of £1040 He hoped that such efforts would be made to reduce that amount that the church would be opened almost if not quite free of debt. He spoke of the willingness to contribute towards the cost of meeting a church shown rocowMv by the parishioners of St. Augustine's. Bulli, and referred to St Philip's Church, which cost 16,000, and St Stephen's, Newtown, stylish cost £12,000 Both these sums, he said, were contributed without anything like bazaar or fair, or any of the extreme efforts which were made in the " ("is s for religious purposes the money Wm contributed in pass or to those is era of praying people, and li those ss he had hurt t» that M CI e moved by the love of Christ and of KOUIB numeral He trusted that the same upintwoulj animate them in future I they should be governed by the example of the early Christians, who acted nobly, giving of their substance gladly for the welfare of the Church by the extension of the Kingdom of Christ He thought that some of the plans adopted in the present day for railing money for Church purposes had a deadening influence upon Christian chants H S hoped that greater liberality would be practiced, and that the spirit of denying one's self for Christ's sale and for the welfare of mankind would be diffused more and more throughout the Church of England in that diocese as well as through out the colony There was another point towhich°he wished to refer He felt that if their beloved Bishop had been spared to them to return to this land, and to be present on that occasion, how gladly he would have rejoiced in seeing another church added to those which had been built during the last 25 years, and how glad his heart would have been if he had been permitted to meet them there to encourage them in their work. He (the Dean thought that his removal was a call upon all churchmen to exert themselves more than they had yet done to promote the work in which his Lordship had taken so large" a part, so that the charge might not be made at some future time that the Church had been deprived of power, and that she fell into a state of comparative deadness because her members did not exercise greater energy. He concluded by appealing to them to contribute liberally towards the reduction of the debt The Rev Canon GtiNTiirn contended that the Churches Ethelind had been a blessing for very many years, and referred to the testimony of Tertullian and others with respect to the early origin of the Clare h He pointed out that 1 though we valued the arts, sciences, and music, they were not enough to satisfy the longing of the soul, and argued that although societies and other moralists had placed bets of the world lofty ideals, they had never attained to those ideals themselves He also alluded to the good which would wins from the building of that church, and concluded by making an appeal on behalf of the building fund) During were then placed on the stone, and it was subsequently neck I turned them, with a sum of £60 contributed by a lad), they amounted to £253 A luncheon so as held in a temporary building on the church property in the afternoon, under the presidency of the late Mr (juutlior, who apologised for the absence of the Iii n Mr Lackey, and explained that it had been decided that there should be no toasts Brief addresses were ps on by the it to, the Rev.
