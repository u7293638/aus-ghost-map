THE LAW AND THE GHOST. To the Editor of The Herald. Snt,â€” I understand Mr Barry SulliVan accounts for tho nonappcarauco of his Ghost on Suturday night, by saying that it was suddenly interdicted by tbo law. This may bo so j ouc it Beema Tery curious thot another giutlomen, being also proprietor of a "Ghost" . and liable to a similar interdict, receiTed tbe dooument so early as Friday last. I si : it myself. Do you really believe, Mr Editor, - that Mr Barry Sullivan was " taken so short' aa he professes ? And if not, was not bis . conctuot in keeping tho mattor so loug bid from tiie public, a "Revival" of a very old and not very odifying triok ? Yours truly, ANOTHER GHOST.
