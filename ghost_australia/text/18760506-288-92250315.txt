The ' shooting affair was a Remarkable one. A Celestial : landing here from Hongkong some months ago put up at the hostelry; of $$r.

At the Criminal Sittings of the Supreme Court held at Maryborough, Queensland, on April 11, Alexander Rixson was charged with the murder of his wife, Annie George Rixson. The prisoner (states the Melbourne Argus) was supposed to have strangled his wife, with whom he had been living on bad terms. Dr. Little, one of the medical witnesses, considered it probable that the marks of strangulation might have been caused by the deceased herself. His Honor Judge Lutwyche quoted Shakapeare's description of the murder of the Duke of Gloucester in 'King Henry VI. '— ' See how the blood is settled en his face! Oft have I seen a timely-parted ghost Of ashy semblance, meagre, pale, and blood less Being all descended to the laboring heart ; Who, in the conflict that it holds with death, Attracts the same for aidance 'gainst the enemy; Which with the heart, there, cools, and ne'er returneth To blush and beautify the cheek again. But see, his face is black, and full of blood; His eyeballs further out than when he lived, Staring full ghastly like a strangled man : His hair upreared, his nostrils stretched with struggling, His hands abroad, displayed, as one that grasped And tugged for life, and was by strength subdued." Dr. Little said he was not familiar with the passage, but the description was an excellent one of the symptoms of strangulation. The prisoner denied his guilt. His Honor, in summing up, pointed out that strong suspicion against the prisoner was not sufficient; the Jury must be sure that his hands were the direct cause of her death, and there was no direct testimony to that effect. The greatest difficulty was the medical evidence, and there was a good deal of doubt there. Dr Little had asserted that he was not satisfied in his own mind, and if the evidence had ended there he should have told them to acquit the prisoner. But there was other and very strong evidence, and if the Jury had no reasonable doubt they must return a verdict of guilty. After an ab sence of half an hour, the Jury returned with a verdict of "not guilty," and prisoner was discharged.
