When I see the tray, it reminds me of the Father, Son, end Holy Ghost. When I see the four, it Mtnioda me of the four Evangelists who proaohed, fit., Matthew, Murk, Luke, and John 7 whan I *t» the five, it reminds me of the ftrfVirgins who4fmmed their lamps —there were tea, bnt ive were -fools and were ehut out; when I see the six, it re minds me that in six days the Lord made the bsavens and tha earth. When I see the sevea, it reminds me that on the seventh day God rested from his work — Q« made and hallowed it. When I see the tight, it remind* ma ot the eight righteous persons that were saved when God drowned the world, viz., Noah, and his wife, his three sons and their wives. When I see the nite, it remindo me of the nioe lepers who were oleaaeed by our Saviour*— there were ten, but only one returned thanks. When I aee the ten it reminds me of the Ten Com mandments, which Gol handed down to Moses oa a tablet of etone. When I see tbe King it reminds me of the great King of Heaven, who is God Almighty. When 1 see the Queen it reminds bis of tbe Qtieen of Sbeba, who went to hear the .wisdom of Solwnon, for ahe was as Tris« a woman as he wae a man. She brought with her fifty hp/i tmi fifty girls, all dressed in boys' apparel, to «ee whether King Solomon could tell which were 'boye and which -were girls. King Solomon sent for 100 basins of water for them to wash themselves in i the girl* washed to the elbows, and the boys only to the wrist, So King Solomon tpU brithis.' . ' TOsH,-' Mid the Mayor, you have given the description of all the cards in the pack excepfone.' ?? Which ie that ?' aeked the soldier. ' The knave,' said the Mayor. ' I will give your honor a description of that, too, if you will not be angry.' ' ' I will not,' said the Mayor, \if you will not term me aa the knave.' « Well,1' said the soldier, 'The greatest knav£ ^ the I onsUble who brought me hers.'' ' I do not know,' said the Mayor, ?? whether he is the greatest knave or not, but I do know that he is the greatest fool.' \- When I count the number of spots in a pack I find S65, the number of days in a year. When I count the number of cards in a pack I find that tbere are fifty-two, or ae many weeks as there are in a year. . And I find four snits, the number of weefcsin a month.- I find there -are 12 ptetamcarde in a pack, representing the number of months in a year and, on counting the trioks, I find thirteen, the number of weeks in a quarter. So you see, sir, that tbe pack of carda serve for a Bible, almanac and common prayer book to me.' [Author un known, but it is probable that the produc tion is of comparatively ancient date.]
