" Renting articles for occasions," said a New York jeweller, " is a growing feature with us. It is hardly a regular business, bat a number of the large honses are in It to an extent. They call it accommodating their friends, but they collect fees. There is a woman in that city in the business of renting jewellery who frequently lets out from 850,000 to 875.000 worth of jewels in an evening. Who are the borrowers? Mostly men. You would not think it. You would guess that feminine vanity was at the bottom of the business; but tbe male bird is the vainest, let me tell you. Besides, women usually own more gems than men. The articles loaned are diamonds principally— Btuds, collar-buttons, ringe, sleeve-buttonB, &c.; Men want them for receptions, weddings, and dinners.

Jewellers, of course, do not let these valubles to people they do not know. They exact security for the most expensive. Articles of vettu and bric-a brae for adorning a room are often rented also. Ail of these must be returned early the next morning."
