BOXING-DAY. Boxing day was celebrated in Melbourne with universal festivity The people turned out en masse for open air enjoyment No holiday m all tho year is like Boxing day If only one file were to be indulged in it would by common coiiBOnt be held on Boxing day when all kinds and conditions of men can unite in pleasure seeking without regard to Beet or creed Coming after tho qniPt observance of Christmas Day, the time of family reunion and gather ing round the feativo board, this great carnival invites all cíaseos to unbend in healthy relaxation just before they reBume once more the stern work of life The day amiled on the general joy The weather waa beautifully ßne, the heat of the aun being tempered b) a cool sea breeze It WftS a day which might bo looked for in the freshnees of spring rather than m midsum,. mer, and the moat waa mad? ur it The city wbb tu fete from au early hour There could be nomiBtoking the air of general jollity and merrymaking of the well dresaed crowds who ulled tho footpaths the omnibuses and the railway traine, on their way to the favourite resorts around the city 1 rom the humble spring cart or lorry to the well horsed and bandeóme equipage every kind of vehicle waa pressed into the serv ice of private picnic par ties They flocked to 1 erntree Gully, Mordial Ioc, Brighton, St Kilda and a hundred other pretty but less known haunts, and helped to make up the bustle of that general exodua which the Intercolonial Cricket Match the Temperance Gala, tho marino excursions, and the Caulfield races drew from Melbourne and its Buburba all the forenoon in a continuous Btream The suburban railways of courae carried by far the larger number of the excur BiomstB, and at the-lirabeth street passenger Btation the department did ita work well, thanka, in a large measuro, to tho barrier Byetem and plenty of rolling stock But to pro vide these latter resources the Prince a bridge eztenBionB, the IineB to Caulfield, Mordialloc, and other Btationa, wore sadly depleted, and the result was a spectacle, at the sight of which, bad he Been it, the moat pachyderma touB Mimater of Railwaya would have found it difficult to repreaa aome twinges of com punction. Thousands of people had to be carried in cattle trucks, which not even all the epikenard and cassia of the East would have purified, and which ordinary washing left re dolent of their ordinary occupants. Tho miserable leavening of proper carnageB in each of the long trama waa quite inadequate to the number of first-class ticketholders, and the result waa that many of thom pre. ferred to forego their wished for visit to Caul- field than be carried like horned stock or prisoners of the Crown Those who did manage to get to the course bad a good day's sport, which waa happily unattended by any serious accident The Temperance Gala drew about 25,000 visitors, and the varioua aporta passed off successfully. The chief feature of interest waa the distribution of pnzea on the art union principle, the first pn/e being a cottage, value£100 Tho Intercolonial Cricket Match waa very largely attended (about 11,000), and tho play, though in favour of New South Wales, waa more acceptable to the spectators than the beginning of the match on Saturday Tho visitors' score was just 100 ahead of that of Victoria on tho Brat innings, but Mackhara and M'Donnell, by putting on 00 runs before the former retired firat wicket down for Victoria in the second innings, did a greut deal to equalise the chances of tho game, which will be continued today Tho marine excur. aiona tempted many peoplo to tako a trip on the baj, and tbo special trama to Ballarat, Geelong, Sale, and Wodonga, took away a good contingent of city folk The only ra 1 way mishap consisted in aomo empty car ringea getting off tho lino at 1 Undera atreet ^ i«.} irero Boon restored, and no uiock ot the passenger "allic occurred By returns pub. liahed below it will bo seen that the railway traffic waa very heavy In tho oveumg the BtrectB of the city were again thronged, and eil the placea of amuaement were crowded to ox cees by visitors anxious to catch tho first sight of tho Christmas entertainments Altogether Boxing Day of tina j ear in ever) respett filled all tho requirements of a national holiday THE RAILWAY TRA1TIC The arrangements for passenger traflic at the -linders atreet Btation wero fully equal to the occasion, although the great depart mental atram of the year cornea on Bosing Daj. Tor yeara thia great central tnlrcpol haa been steadily improved aa experience and the growing trafkc gJided neceasary alterationa, until it is now capable of despatching with ease and comfort the largest number of ex curaiomsta Melbourne and Buburba can Bupply. Tho radical chauge in the issue and collection of ticketa wrought by tho barrier ay atom and tho exclusion of all but bond fide travellers from the precincta of the Btation, ia found to be of great value on occaaiona auch aa Boxing Day, when there ia nu unusual rush of paasongera. The teat jeaterdoy waa moat satisfactory , the enormous traffic moved without bitch, annoyance, or inconvenience If there waa one department more smoothly worked than another, it waa the Brighton line, which used to cause such scenes of jostling at the Bmall ticket windows and overcrowding m the trams Now, tho rowB of broad windows, each ticketed with the names of the place for which ticketa could be obtained, the addi- tional number of entrances, tho eaay and efficient euperviaion of ticketa, and the quick deapatch of trama, wero quite enough to atart holiday makers on their outing in an excellent humour with the world m general and tho railway depart- ment, which had mado so much pro viBion for their comfort, in particular. The new office at the eastern end of the station, reserved exclusively for the sale of Brighton tickets, waa very useful in easing the other windowa and diverting the stream of pur- chasers towards a place where there was plenty of room for them to move It would be well if another offico of the same pattern could bo erected at the west end to do similar Bervice for the St Kilda and Sandridge linea, for although nothing like a block at any time occurred at theso booking offices, it waa noticeable that the entrances to them were narrower than thoae at the Brighton and Hawthorn end The rush to Sandridge was very great all the forenoon, as the day being bo fino a trip down the bay in one of the lleet of steamers leaving that port waB a favourite means of spending the day 'i he promenade at St Kilda and ita cool clear sea baths evidently had fascinations, for thoueanda booked themselves for that desti- nation, and aasiBted to make up a very heavy return of the day's buBineaB. Towards 10 o clock there waB a lull in the tide of excur- sionista Between 2 and 3 o'clock thoae deBiroua only of anafternoon'a outing had tobo provided for, and thon a little later the return traffic commenced Theil for a time there wbb just aa mnch buatle to speed the return- ing holiday makers aa there had been to send them away in the morning. Night had well advanced ere all the work was done. A great contrast to the well organiaed machinery and completeness at the central suburban station waspreaented at the Prince a bridge station. Hero all waa bustle and con- fusion. This waa not the fault of the cflicials, who worked hard to do their boBt under difficulties The truth is, tina Btation, with ita new and very popular lines, is only in tho embryonic Btage in all its appliances. It had no barriera, few carnages, and manj cattle trucks The fondness of the people for Mordialloc, and the attractions of the Caulfield races were too mnch for the re aourcea of the department The ticket windows were too few, the entrances woro fewer, and there was no diviaion of the paa Bengers according to the trama they should fill, although the farce was gone through of admitting them at different gatea according to their destinations Once on the platform they mingled and crammed themselves con- fusedly and excitedlyintothofiratcompartmont that carno to hand Someof the arrangements were laughably primitive The gate of the gooda Bheda waa opened for the entry of paaeengers, for whoae perilous deacent from the high level above toy ladders were placed at angles which a hodman might shrink from aa too precipitous The cattle truck trains were a special feature, They had been washed, but they had an evil smell, and around them clustered dark clouda of flies Rude eeata had been provided, A yell of denalon would rise from the crowd as one of these luxurious trains would draw up In front of the platform, and then seeing that it was a case of Hobson a choice, the trucks would be rushed pell mell, amid the mimicry of all the sounds usual at the draft- ing of atock-the barking or doga, the lowing of cattle, and plaintive call of sheep. Stand- ing room oniy waa not despised, but here and there a seat would be reluctantly vacated by a passenger who found himself mistaken in believing that he had stomach and nerve enough for a railway ride under such con- ditions Otheis who) had not Been the notifi cation of the Railway department in which inviting mention had been made of "seated trucks turned away m diBguat, notwith a landing that portera made tho odioua and explanatory companaon that there wero no seats last year Tor such Bmall amelioration in the vicisitudes of railway travelling m 'S letona, it must bo confessed thero did not appear to be a very lively feel ing of gratitude It was not an exhila- rating spectacle to aee the citi7en8 ot Mel- bourne on their holiday inn confined behind bnra like the liona and tigera of «.coper and Boiley a circus but the good humour of a colonial crowd did not desert them in the ordeal, ¡md each man mt&ht; com fort his neighbour in the worda of Bunyan ' Bo of good cheer, brother,

afternoon on the Caulfield coiubc waa not nearly bo numerous as such an excellent programme well de8ervod The inBide of tho courae waa very well patronia»d, but the Btand enclosure was not nearly ao well attended aa might have been expected The want of proper railway carnagea to con vey the viBitors from Melbourne to the courae was doubtless the cause why ao few ladies graced the grand stand The graaa has grown rapidly on tho now piece of land that has been added to tho saddling paddock, but tho throng of pedestrians and racehorses cut it up a good deal, and during the latter part of the day the course waa very duBty Ihe plan of confining tho bookmakers to tho new ring at the clock tower excited great diBaatiafaction among the metalhcianB A notice waa posted on the ground to the effect that any bookmaker plying his avocation outetdo the ring would be expelled from the ground but it waa not carried into effect Betting waa carried on for a Bhort time in the encloaure, but gra dually one after another tho bookmakers came out, till at laat not one of the fieldora waa left in the ring The etewarde caused tho names of those who were betting outside the ring to be taken down with the view of deal ing with them hereafter The racing commenced with the Selling I ace, for which eight horses started Ghost being made a very strong favourite Kanaka got awoy in front, and mado the running till reaching the straight where Ghost who got off badly, carno up on tho outside and Songater waa showing well forward on the meide Songater soon died away, and Ghost passing Kanaka half way home, won very eaBily by five lengths The winner was put up for sale and bought in for 100 guineas all ot which goeB to the club funds Llevon coltB and lillies came out for tbe Juvenile Stal ob tbo pride of

after hearing the evidence the atewarda dia missed it The Christmas Handicap brought out ten starters of which Colstoun waa the nioBt fancied, though Baron von Mueller who waa in admirable condition, waa well eupported Paul with Declamation nearly level on tho outside, made the running for about a mile, when Adventurer showed in front for a abort diätanco Paul carno n(,ain, and led into the

the ate«arda appointed the match to bo run oil after tbo Malvern Hai dicap Tho betting waa in favour of Baron von Muller, but he cut up badly in the run off, and waa beaton fully a quarter of a mile from home Ihe Open Steeplechase brought out 11 starters Bryan O Lynn, though not well known in public, waa made firat favourite The race waa a chapter of accidente Blackthorn fell at the first fence, Collingwood and Premier fell at the second Squire fell before going a mile, Breechloader fell early in tbe Becond round and Ascot fell after running well for about two miles and a half Bryan O Lynn and tho Hawk raced in front all tho second round The latter, who was very pluckily ridden by a lad named M Gowan gavo Bryan OLjnn a great deal of trouble, and waa only beaten by three quartera of a

A brasa band aocom panied the steamer, and contributed greatly to the amusement of the excursionist On arriving at Geelong, the visitors scattered themselves in picnic parties along the beach, and inspected all the local Bights of interest.

The passenger wero soon scattered all over tho lulls and round the different Bights that are to be aeon at Portarlington The vessel left on the return tup at J o'clock, Jt waa spent in much the aatno manner aa the passage down, and was concluded at C o'clock. The Southern Cross left tho South wharf ahortly after 9 o'clock for Portarlington, and got clear of tho river about 10. The vessel was filled with pleasure-seekers, and waa accompanied by another detachmout of Sutch's band.

The match between the Eton Ivo Bligh's team of English cricketers and IS of Ballarat w'B commenced on tho Eastern Ot al j esterday morning, and during the day the attendance numbered between 1,000 and 3,000. W, li JTiggia captained the local t»am, and Cooper, of Ballarat, played m Vernon'a place for the Englishmen, until that player arrived in the afternoon. Tho wicket waa in splendid order, and Figgis, winning the toss Bent AntclilTo and Lawler to commence operations for tho eighteen. Steel bowled from the north end and Barlow from the eouth. Arncliffe opened out at a gentle one from Steel and started the score ; the bowler bungled the return, or tho player would have been Bent to the right- about. Barlow, however, revenged Ina brother bowler by sending Antcliffe'a stumpa all over the ground with a fal' pitched ball. Percy Lewis hlled the vacancy, and commenced in 1iib usual cautious style , after making 3 oil Barlow by an on drive, and 1 off Steel, no further liberties could be taken, and maiden after maiden was sent down from each end. Getting moro daring, Lewis began to hit out freely, and pumahed Barlow until ho had added 11 to the Bcore. In Btepping out to an enticing one from Steel, he missed it, and 'lylecote had his baila off before he could return to the crease, but it waa bo close that the umpire waa almost in doubt. However, with a heaitating atep ho left tho wicket, and one of the beat bats of the team was lost. Lawler, who had been playing carefully, became set, and led the field a merry dance Hit after hit went to tho chaina, and at lunch timo he had added the respectably total of 35 to tho score Coulsell took Lewis's position but failed to assist the total beforo his stumpa were scattered by Steel. M'Gregor, in the gap, commenced by vigorously bitting all over the ground, and with Lawler carried on a fast game. At lunch time the Bcora Btojd, threo wicicets for 70 runa Upon resuming C. T btudd went on at the north end, anl Lawler, after adding 2 more to the 85 he left oil with, waB taken at point by Bligh, off Barlow All tho bowlera were tried at him, but without effect, and hia 3/ was gamed by first class cricket Iho board showed 72 tvheu Worrall joined M'Gregor, and commenced by hitting at everything, runs continued to come, and Steel relieved Bjirlow at tho south end. A drive by M Gregor waa badly fielded, or ho would have paid the penalty of attempting a Becond run Ho made amends, however, ahortly afterwards bj lifting one of Steel a clean over the chains for four amidst a aalvo of applause, Worrall disgusted btudd by stopping every ball, but managed to get one to the chaîna, sending the acore to 100, in three houra from the delivery of the firat ball. BateB went on at the south end, and waa knocked all over the ground, and 120 quickly followed. L»Bhe waa tried at the south end, but failed to come oft. Four went up from his hrat over, and M'Gregor knocked him »t.out "".»<,,",. lunj. o,..i ..i,«,oa Barlow in the next over, but both men had now thoroughly mastered all the English bowling, aud runa came fast. In attempting a aliort one the ball waa smartly returned by Steel, and Tyla cotte scattered M'Gregor a wicketa after he had scored 53 in a free hitting style Vernon took Cooper B place in tho held at tbia Btnge, and Nettle filled the vacancy caused by M'Gregor a retirement, to tho bowl ing of C T, btudd, and Worrall carried on the campaign Another change m tho bowl- ing waa fouud neceaaary, and Read went on at tlie north end Shortly afterwardB Worrall touched ono of Siudd'a gently in tho air lylecoto was underneath, and tho bata man retired with 52 to his credit bix v ickets for 102. Downes, one of t'io most steady bata followed, but waa cleu i bowled by a puzzler from Steel after making 7\. liggi«, the captain, was not in form, and waB soon diamiased-eight wickets for 1S1. BateB went on at the Bouth end in the room of btudd, and Barnea relieved Steel. The effect was a dissolution brought about by a skier Bent by Nettlo mto Bttea a hand3. T Antchlie joined Cooper, and both wera dia missed, the former caught by Bates aud the latter bowled by Barnea Duffy and Jackaou filled the vacancies, and m a feiv minutes carried the score to 200. In the next hit Jackson, tho Bonnor or the team lifted one outsido the reserve for 0 Duffy loat his wicket by a fine catch by Bates, and Jtckaon narrowly eacaped a similar fate from Barlow , the ball went almost out of sight, and it ap peared to fall direct into Barlow a hands, through which it slipped Shortly after Barnes sent him a Bhooter, and bia retirement to the pavilion at the aame time-13 wicketa for 215 Bryant waa clean bowled the second ball from Barnea. Bodycomb followed m two minutes, caught by Tylecote. Bradley failed to contribute, aud Wollaston, the last mau, joined riggiB, who waa caught, and the inninga cloaed with j, total of 220 five minuteB beforo timo waa called.

THEATRE ROYAL. "JACK AND THE BEANSTALK." The pantomime entitled " Jack and the BeanBtalk " was produced laBt night for the first time, before an audience which crowded the theatre to excess in ovory part. The principal features of the production were sketched in The Aigus of Saturday last, and it will have been gathered that the panto- mimo as adapted for production here is one that affords ample Bcopo for excellence of scenic illustration and Bpectacular effects. Mr. Henning3 has, a i usual, not confined himself to those romark able fantasies in painting, of which panto- mime scenery ¡B generally chiefly composed, but has also again Bhown in a fine Bones of panoramic pamtinga, how well ho can make localities or incidents upon which public interest has centred, lend themselves to pictureaque effects Hia panorama depicta incidents in connexion with the Egyptian war A portion of the British Ueet ia ürflt Been leaving Valetta, near Malta, and then follow a number of marino views in Mr. Hen ninga'B best style, terminating with a spirited picture of the bombardment of Alexandria and of the city in (lames. This was groatly admired, and when, after a well arranged militaryBpectaclerepresenting "thecharge of the Black Watch," there was disclosed a por- trait of Her Majesty the Queen, with repré- sentatives of her ormy and navy, the enthusiasm of tho audienco found vent in moat hearty applauBe. The transformation Bceno is happily conceived and effectively worked out. From " Cloudland " to a chaotic ahyes, only relieved by the water which u flowing in silvery Bpray over rocky precipices, from this wild scone to ft lovely pic lure of tho island of Cythera, each chongo (liBcloBea some scene more pleas ing than the last, and finally, m a Bub aqueous view, tho artist finds acope for bia imagination, and presenta a compoai tion abounding in fantastic designs and brilliantly eftectne combinations of colour. Several unfortunate bitches in the acenic ar rnngementa marred the effect of aoveral Bcenea, but on a second production theao will probably bo avoided, and Mr. Hen- nings a excellent work will receive greater appreciation. Iho caat ia fairly strong, and introduces one or two new faces, besides comprising several members who have beeu for Bome time absent from tbo Theatre Royal The principal part is assigned to Mías Maggio Oliver, whose opportunities, however, aro limited but what there ib for her to do Bho doea with a great deal of vivacity and an eacy and pleasing manner. Her firat song waa apreeably rendere', and under very discouraging conditiona Bho did moro then her share towards endeavouring to mako tho dialogue How on regard lesa of constant noisy interruptions, Miss Jem y Bryco was welcomed on her re- al peurnnco in a congenial character, tbo Mi^ea Deorwyn established themaelvea as great favourites by reason of their extremely pleasing appearance, elegance of manner, and graceful dancing , and Miaa Lena Edwin waa a very agreeable, if by no means typical, representative of "tho man in the moon' Mr Greville and Mr Eland Holt vied with each other in the display of broad humour, and in creating boisterous merri- ment Mr Charlea Brown supplied the demoniacal and melodramatic element with unlimited force and fury Mr Musgravchad but little to do, and Messrs. B N Jones, Han a Phillips and Daniela had but to display for a brief time cancaturea of prominent politicmiB, in which they attained only a moderate Bucees», aa regarda the counterfeita which they preaented.

Iho work baa achieved considerable fame in Europa and America, and moro lately in Sydney, where the present company havo for Borne time pajt been playing it It ia Ccr tainly a masterly combination and arrauf,ement of all the most popular features of euch productions, music, spec tacle, comedy, and sentiment being deftly woven together in a dalling and very divert mg masa Aa performed last night tho caat was aa follows -Laurent XVII (Duke of Piombino), Mr U H Harwood , Priuce 1 tit tehni (Crown Punco of Pisa), Mr W H Woodfield, Pippo (a Bhepherd), Slgnor G Verdi, Rocco (a farmer), Mr Llvvin Kelly , Parafante (a Bergeant), Mr W II Harrison , Mutbeo (an îniikeeper), Mr, Ben Leviaon Guiseppe (a peasant), Mr J S Porter, liamena (Laurents daughter), Mi=a Nelho Stewart, Bettina ,(a country tiri, ' Li Mas cotto ), Misa Moggio Moore T he plot of the opera has much to recom rneud it on the score of novelty, and it aborda ample opportunity for working up droll situations and the introduction of thoae pretty and brilliant nothings in the way of jokes and repattce, without which no modern comic opera ia properly furnished Bettma, tho rnncipal personate, ia a Mascotte, or one endowed by fairies with the extraordinary power of briupin" all aorta of good fortune to those with whom abo is associated. At the time the opera opens she is ongaf,ed aa a herder of tuikeya by the brother ot a luckless fermer named Rocco The latter foila to understand how it ia that while his crops fail, hia cattle stray, and bia afiaira generally take a profitless turn, bia brother a enterprises all prove successful Ho makes Eeveral apphcationa for help to the fortunata one, and after jeara of waiting, Bettina ia Bent to him us a present Sho falls m love with one of his farm servants, Pippo, and everything promieea well for Rocco King Laurent X\ li , a dilapidated old monarch of auperatitioua temperament, comeB upon the aceuo while out hunting, and discovering Bettinas wonderful power, quietly ap propna'es her, with the object of re triewng the fallen fortunes of his Roy ii house Rocco he rewards with the office of cb imberlam, and Pippo, finding his sweet- heart thus rndely torn from him, joina a troupe of strolling dancera, who aro on their way to perform at court On arrival at the palace, Bettma ia created a couiitea», and Laurent and Bocco bend their united energiea to the laBk of keeping her separate from Pippo, tlie man she loves, being well aware that the legend of the Maacotte contains tbo following warning - ' JJ she loves whom sho filial!

The Rocco of Mr, Edwin Kelly waa taceedingly good, and aa the supporter of King Lamont, whom he, aa a dutiful subject, occasionally re- lieved from the necessity of einging, ho appeared to be congenially situated 11 o music of the opera ia admirably suited to tho light and any churacter of tho whole work. Nowhero using to anything like extraordinary merit, it is conaistently good throughout Some of the amorous songa are especially taking, though their strong originality will probably be a Blight bar to their ready acceptance by the general public. Tho composer haa at timea allowed him eelf unusual latitude in bia phrasoa, and peculiar intervals and successions aro plentifully found through tho acoro Tho general style, however, baa a dis tinct and pleasing individuality, and tho music as a whole, judging by the expencnco of tho pnBt, will probably uocome popular, Among thepnncipalfeatures of therepresen tation are tho scenic and apectacular. Tim three acts of which it consista aro threo hand some pictures which command admiration Tho first ia Roccoa farmstead with all tho farmyard paraphernalia, and tho aceuo is animated by moving groupa of peasants and huntera in many co'oured costume» The aecond act discloses a room in tho interior of Laurert'a palace. On tho nae oi the curtain a number of pages, dressed in crimson and light blue, nro aeon reclining in various picturesque attitudes on tho flJor, a charming view ot ainver, with a ruatio town, being obaervablo over the edge of tha verandah into which the room opens. The last act is the most glowing of aliso far ra grouping nnd brilliancy aro concerned. Tue aoldiera of Entellim aro camping on tho edge ol a dente forçat. They aro elad in variously coloured uniforma, crimaon and white being atrikingly prominent. Their silvered helmets, halberds, and accoutre- ments shimmer dazzlingly in tho light of tho oxy hydrogen lamp which is cast upon them, and tho result ia the production of a very lm poaing spectacle. Tho now scenery baa been painted by Mr. Georgo Gordon, and the costumes are specially imported for the Aus- tralian performance of the opera. "La Mascotte" will bo repeated tonight and until further notice. THE TOWN-IIALL CONCERT. The ballad and instrumental concert in the Town hall, in aid of St George's Schools, Carlton, waa patronised by a largo number of well-wiahere. The management had con- fided tbo arrangementa to Mr. Charlea Sykes, who secured the co-operation of Misa José- phine O Brien, Signora Venosta, Mr. Knight Aston, Mr. P Shannon, and Mr. lrod Jolley aa vocalists, and Mr David Leo organiat Beforo tho commencement ol the concert the nudienco wero addressed by the \ ery Rev Prior Butler, who thanked them for their patronage and the asaiatance thoy had thus rendered in maintaining the schools It waB a disgrace, ho Ban!, to the colony that tho Catholic community had to resort to such meanB, though they wero for supporting their educational Bystem against the vast monopoly by the state. The presence of so many persona that evening would bo a protest against that gigantic monopoly of intellect - tho running of children aa if they were expresa traniB, under one bj atom, and ono modo of pro ducing what their opponenta wero pleased to call the cream ol learning. So long aa tin atate system laated, so long would they keep knocking against it until thoy tumbled it to pieces, and secured fair play for all aecte. AMioever undertook the mstruc tion of the young, whether thay bo Catholics, Preeby terian1", or Epiacop liana, bad a right to have their talent", genius, and industry recognised by the state, which had no right to monopolise that duty I xpenenco in other countries where the stato grasped everything had ahown whvt would be tho reault Here the control by tho state of education meant the moulding of the coneciencea of tho children, but God save ua from tho morality of tho statesmen ovcru° The object of education was dear to all their heartB, and, on behalf of the com- mittee, he must again thank the audienco for their patronage. Tho concert then pro- ceeded, Mr Leo opening with the ex quiBite overture to "Tho Poet and Pea- sant" with which the organiat haa ao offen charmed bia heareis Two other aoloa " Ro mmipceucea of Ireland," and the "Turkish patrol" wero also performed by him during the evening.

THE BIJOU THEATRE. "Maritana' waa revived for the holiday night, and ita performance waa particularly acceptable to the patrona of this theatre The impersonation of the (,itana by Miss Montague ia admittedly one of the beat, if not tho best, seen in Melbourne, and her render- ing of tbo beautiful music of tho part was ns sympathetic and aa enjoyable aa ever Mr lumera spirited Don Cesar also poa3esje3 ami lo merit, and otherwise the company is moderately well fitted for tho performance of the work. _ ST GEORGE S HALL. "Clark and Ryman's Muldoon Picnic Party ' wf>a very well patromaed Hat mgnt at St George's Hall. 'Iho programme given on the opening night waa repeated, and waa heartily relished hy tho audience The ballads sung by Mr. T B Dixon, and the songa of Mr A. Lawton, wero highly appreciated. Mr 1\. M Clark and Miss Lillie Linden were entertaining in their character changea, and in the picnic scenes MeBBra Clark and M E Gilbert, with their Iriah comicalities, kept the people roaring with laughter. THE TEMPERANCE HALL, "THE BOTTLE" A very largo audienco waa attracted to tho 'temperance hall lost night to witness a revival of the moral and tomperanco drama "The Bottle," founded on the engravings of Georgo Cruiksbank. The character of Richard T hornley, the irresolute and wretched drunkard, waa played by Mr A J. Byrne, who faithfully depicted the aucceeding Btagea of degradation through which tho drunkard pasEed in consequence of Ina infatuation for the bottle Ruth Thornley, the unfortunate wifo ot Richard, waa personated by Miaa Marian Willie, and she infused a considerable amount of patboaintothcnumcrouasceneaahe waa called upon to participate in. The drama ia au extremely doleful one almoat from the commencement to tbo end, and the audience were in a continual etato of depression, ex- cepting in several brief scenes, when they were amused by the comicahtiea of Mr. E. D Hay garth, aa Sam Coddles, the potboy, and of Misa Li/vie Dixon, who played Kitty Crump, the ehoebinder. The piece will be repeated thia evening VICTORIA-HALL. There waa a large audienco at the Victoria hill laBt night, when Baclielder's Anglo American MinetrelB appeared m an ontirely new programme.

Bergin, and "Pretty Blue Eyea," by Mr Beaumont Read, were rendered with good effect and favourably received. Mesara S. Keenan and Al. Moynham wero very suc- cessful in their comic Bongs, and the first part was closed with an amusing sketch, entitled " Compulaory Education." The triple Eand jig by Bella, Willie, and Percy Perman waB well executed, and the entnrtamrnent waa concluded with a pantomime (in black) entitled "St Georgo and the Dragon " The principal character wero Buatomedby MeaBrs Beaumont T^ad, W.
