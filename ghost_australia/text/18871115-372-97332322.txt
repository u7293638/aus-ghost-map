JOKING WITH A POWDER HOUSE. There was a fall of rock at one of the tun nels on the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, and our train waa detained at a flag-station for three or four hours. The passengers strolled about to pass the time away, and a dozen of us had gone down the track half e mile to wards the quarry when -we came to a rough looking shanty erected about 200 feet from the track, and partly hidden by great rocks. There was a small piece of red cardboard in eight on the building, but if it had any print ing or writing on it we couldn't see from that distance. A passenger pulled out his revolver and observed : 'I think I can chip that card, though it's a pretty long shot.' He fired and missed it. Then a second pulled his revolver and fired and hit the corner of the card. Then out came seven or eight . weapons, and there was a general blazing Â« way for at least ten minutes, when the card fell. We had just put up our pis tols when a man came running up from the quarry, waving hie hat, and yelling : ' Stop t stop I' When he reached us he was out of breath and pale as a ghost. 'W-what were you shooting at?' he gasped. 'At a red card on that shanty.' He beckoned for us to follow, and led the way to the house and opened the door. The place con tained 19 kegs of blasting powder and 150 pounds of nitro-glycerine, and some of our bullets had *' barked' two -or three of the kegs. ? I don't know by what route the others got back to the train, nor how long it took*em, but I flew, and the rate of speed beat any pigeon record you ever heard of.
