THE A.R.C. BIRTHDAY MEETING. STEEPLECHASE DAY. SATEBDAY, MAT 29. Stewards. Messrs. E. W. Ellis, S. J. Jacobs, J. Pile, T. Barnfield, H. W. Varley, D. James, A. D. Handysiae, M.P., W. Nicholls, and S. A. White, and Hon. J. H. Howe; Jud^e, Mr. J. Barker; Starter, Mr. F. Cornelius; Handicapper, Mr. H. Hughes; Official Timekeeper, Mr. W. Gordon; Hon. Surgeons, Drs. J. A. G. Hamilton and T. Cawley; Clerk of the Scales, Mr. H. H. Parr; .Clerk of the Course, Mr. J. Reid; Secretary, Mr. S. R. Heseltine. In fine weather the Birthday Meeting of the Adelaide Racing Club was brought to a i conclusion on the Old Course on Saturday f afternoon. The attendance, which was very satisfactory, included the Chief Secretary, Hon. J. V. O'lioghlin, tt^e Commissioner of Crown Lands, Hon. L. O'Loughlin, £ and some Victorian visitors. A few of the latter came from Melbourne by the express which left on Friday afternoon, but through a delay they did not arrive in Adelaide until three hours lat«. with the result that they did not reach the course in time for the first event. The racing on Saturday was perhaps the most interesting of the three days, the fields £ being exceptionally good. It was not, however, devoid of accident. In the Hurdle Race UZ, Nita, and Jack Sprat all came to grief half a mile from home, and Howie, who was on UZ, fell with such force that he received a severe concussion, and was still unconscious on Sunday night. Ellis, the -rider of Bernal in the Steeplechase, also had the misfortune to break his collarbone. Though £13,940 was invested in the totalizator, it fell short by £2,333 of the amount recorded last year, while the total sum for the meeting was £41,934, as compared with £50,088 received for the three days in 1S96. At the recent S.A.J.C. Autumn fixture £38,925 103. was put through, A pleasing ceremony in connection with Saturday's proceedings was the presentation of the Alderman Cup to Mr. A. A. Samuel, the owner of The Chevalier. After the horse had won the mile-and-three-quarter race he was led to the front of the Grand Stand, with Dawes, his rider, in the saddle, while the Committee and Stewards of the Club occupied seats in the viceregal box. Mr. H. W. Varley, in presenting the Cup, said that the gift was only one instance of many of the generous nature of Alderman Kither, a citizen of whom they had every reason to be proud. Mr. Kither was away On a trip to England, but it would be gratifying to him to find that his Cup hod been won by a gentleman who enjoyed the reputation of being a true sportsman in every sense of the word. They were pleased to welcome Mr. Samuel from Victoria, and congratulated him on having achieved success, even though it came on the last day of the meeting, tie hoped that he would visit South Australia again. Three cheers were then given for the winner, the donor, the rider, and trainer. Mr. Samuel suitably acknowledged the compliment, but his flow of* oratory was spoilt through a stampede of the crowd in the Stand after a pickpocket, who was caught by an onlooker before he got clear of the enclosure. The Victorian owner, however, in his reply said that he felt proud of winning the Cup, the first he had appropriated. He had experienced rather bad luck this trip in South Australia, and he should not have remained here but that he wished to annex the trophy in the Alderman Cup, which he had thought he had a very fair chance of doing. Though he was the owner of The Chevalier, the credit of the victory was due to his trainer, Foulsham. Thi3 concluded the speechmaking, and backers then turned their attention to picking the winner of the Rose Park Handicap, which, by-the-way, the majority of them missed. We understand that Mr. Samuel, recognising the attention and time that Foulsham has devoted to the preparation of The Chevalier, has handed over to him the cup which he received. The whole of the arrangements on the course on Saturday were complete, and it is only fair to award praise to Mr. S. R. Heseltine and his staff on the successful results which attended their efforts. i When the weighing bell rungfor the Disposal Stakes it was found that Mr. Nicholson had withdrawn Kase in favour of Golden Fleece, but the Victorian mare was not in request, being one of the biggest outsiders of the race. A favourite was found in De la Volta, and backers made an auspicious start, as after Royalty had looked dangerous to the pickets she came avva?' and stalling off Harold beat him with something to spare. Golden Fleece was conspicuous for the first three furlongs by her presence in the rear. It is said she slipped when the barrier was raised. On De la Volta being submitted to the hammer she was bought in for 50 gs. The riders in this and the other races during the afternoon wore crape round their arms out of respect to "the deceased jockey, C. Ohlsen, who was on Kimbolton on the first two days of the meeting. Jack Sprat was again entrusted with the honour of first favourite in the Second Hurdle Race, though Regent, UZ, Kimbolton, and General Gordon were all well backed. Nita and UZ ma.de the most of the running, but Jack Sprat, Kimbolton, and Albury Queen were always handy, and going past the five furlongs the lot were pretty well bunched. The next hurdle, however, spoilt what might have been an interesting race, as UZ and Nita fell and Jack Sprat came over them. This left Kimbolton in possession from Albury Queen, and the visitor, holding the mare safe for the rest of the journey, beat her comfortably by half-adozen lengths, with General Gordon third. McGowan remounted Jack Sprat, and Deveney also escaped injury, but, as stated above, Howie was not so fortunate. The whole of the thirteen on the card for the Marryatville Handicap sported silk, but Mr. Hughes had put them so well together that at least half a dozen had substantial supporters. The Victorian money, however, came so strongly for Lilith at the finish that she had the call over the local lot in the market, Stafia and Foliage being about in equal request, closely pressed by Haivrel and Damper. Up to the pickets the issue was in doubt, but when Stafia was brought to the front here—on the outside this time— he smothered the leaders in the most hollow fashion, and though Damper essayed to catch him the task was quite beyond him, the brilliant chestnut scoring a comfortable victory. The performance of Staffa with 9 st. on his back was an exceedingly good one, and he is certainly entitled to the position of champion of the colony up to a mile at the present thne. A word of praise is due to Bailey for the manner in which he turned him out. The dividend—£8 Is.—which Staffa paid was a surprising one when his late form is taken into consideration. Damper ran well, as did also Trsntalto and The Idler. Britomaxte aad Gcrassmere disputed favouritism in the teeplechase, the public deciding to once mora upport Alec Taylors celaing in the hope of is standing up. The race, however, was onsidered so open _ that either of tho air would have paid 4$ to 1 in the otalizator, while Eclipse would have reurned his investors about £0 9s. Then anked Stockings, and after him Bernal, he outsider of the party being Abbotsford. nce they had fairly settled into their places t was seen that the rider of Stockings had intructions to force the pace and thus take full dvantage of his light weight. He accordingly iloted the field over the treble in front of the taod—with the exception of Arbitrator, who ome to grief at the first obstacle—and as they ame round the second time he was still in ommand of Eclipse, who had joined him at he seven furlongs, Britomarte, Grassmere, anjo, Confidence, Desperado, and The ctress as named. Grsasmere, however, was umping very badly, while Banjo, Desperado,^ nd The Actress were picked out as beaten. t will be noticed that at this stage Abbotsord and Bernal were missing, the former aving baulked at the South-terrace corner, hile the Sydney horse had toppled over at he fence in the dip. Once out of the fiat nclosure S toe kings and Eclipse drew out, nd went past the Church well dear of Britoarte, Grassmeno, and Confidence; but at the ouble near the seven furlongs Britomarte as within three lengths of them, and with onfidence drawing eloeer the quartet came on o the last jump on top of the hill well together. The obstacle, however, shattered the hopes ot backers of Eclipse and Britomarte, who fell, while it alii placed Grassmere out of court, as he declined it. What might have proved a capital finish was thus spoilt, though Confidence and Stockings provided the spectators with plenty of excitement. The pair raced down the stnight is company, and up to the beginning of the Old Stand the popular old grey appeared to have the verdict in hand, but he failed there, and was beaten by five lengths. Britomarte, who was remounted, was a bad third, being nearly two furlongs off, followed by Eclipse, ridden by an outsider, and then the length of the straight away were Desperado and Grassmere, these being the only other two which finished. Stockings, who is owned by Mr. H. A. Morris, haiis trom the South-East, and is by Hamlet's Ghost from Miss Twist. The whole of the dozen left in the Alderman's Cup presented themselves to Mr. Cornelius, The Chevalier being served up a very warm favourite, with Thunder Queen carrvingthe most money of the others. The running was made by Princess of Wales and U.Z., but they were both well beaten two furlongs from home—Princess of Wales retired on the hill—where Viking shot out, and he was going great guns up to the pickets. Inside the distance, however, The Chevalier came upon the sfieae, and securing the measure of Viking at the Old Stand he won handsomely by two and a half lengths. Response was a length away third, with Princess of Wales, who came again, fourth. The Rose Park Handicap saw no less than nineteen runners, and as it was only a five-furlong flutter the chances were against losers over the meeting getting a recovery. The big field were not kept long in. tha dark—it was 5 o'clock before the race was started — and it was soon observed that Tranquillity was out by herself, while Thunderer's green jacket was seen in the rear. As Tranquillity was . lengths to the good two furlongs from home t was thought she might see the full journey out, but these hopes were dissipated at the pickets, where sue shut up like a pricked bladder. Beau Brummell and Wild Olive were here prominent, but at the half- distance Esau shot out and beat the Victorian pair by a length and a half. The winner is in the same stable as Fund, who went out the better favourite, though a substantial commission was executed m favour of Esau in the 10s. totalizator. The winner paid a dividend of £17 7s. The following are the particulars of the running:— DI8P08AL STAKES.

When the Barrier was raised, Iluroe, Royalty, and The Imp were the first to draw out from Harold, while the two last to commence were Marcius and Golden Fleece. Racing up the rise. The Imp was in command from Royalty, Harold, and Cigarette, with Berniee next, while Golden Fleece was stfil in the rear. The Imp had not been displaced on top of the hill, where Royalty and Harold were running next clear of Ladykiller, Iluree, and De la Volta, and Royalty and The Imp came into the straight from lluree and Harold, with De la Volta and Berniee heading the others. Two furlongs from home Royalty was just clear of De la Valla, Iluree, and Cigarette, and at the pickets the order was Royalty, De la Volta, Harold, and Cobalt. De la Volta, however, secured the measure of Royalty opposite the Old Stand, and stalling off a run on the part of Harold beat him comfortably by a length and a halt. Royalty was third three-quarters of a length off, and then came Cobalt, Morna Lee, and Cigarette, the last four being Goldfn Fleece, Wahine, The Imp, and Marcius. Time, 1 min. 19J sec.

The start took place at the halfmile post, and the first hurdle in the straight wag negotiated by Wirrawa and General Gordon, just clear of Nita and Jack Sprat, while Albany and Kimbolton -headed the next division, which was whipped in by Conscript. At the following hurdle Nita had joicied General Gordon, the pair making play from Jack Sprat, Kimbolton, and Regent, but as they swept past the Stand Nita had a slight call over Albany, Jack Sprat, and General Gordon, who were closely attended by Albury Queen and U.Z., the last one at this stage being Conscript. Nita held her own racing out of the straight, but at the mile-and-afurlong cost she was joined by Albury Queen, who led over the obstacle sightly in advance of Nita, withUZ, Jack Sprat, Kimbolton, Regent, and General Gordon handy. As they came on to the seven-furlong post Nita and UZ were together, the pair being closely attended by Kimbolton, Albury Queen, and Jack Sprat, the last-named being at the head of Regent and General Gordon. They ran in this order along the back and to the hurdle near the halfmile post, which brought UZ, Nita, and Jack Sprat to grief, leaving Kimbolton to go on and enter the straight in advance of Albury Queen, Rsyent, and General Gordon. Kimbolton then drew away, and holding his own over the remaining hurdles won comfortably by half a dozen lengths, three-quarters of a length separating the second and third horses. Regent was only a neck off fourth, .ind then fifty yards away came Conscript, Albany, and Wirrawa. Time, 4 min. 4 sec.
