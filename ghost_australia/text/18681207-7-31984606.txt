It therefore appear* positively sinful to destroy palatable and wholesome food, which would furnish an agreeable change at thousands of table*. Thia, however, is being done, almost from necessity, as it appear* cheaper to kill the rabbits in some plage* by thousands, leaving them to rot in their holes than to sell dun tor human food. This suggests an anoma lous state of things in the labor market. Here is an article of universal demand which may be had at first hand for almost nothing; but it cannot he brought to the consumer without being encumbered with profits of intermediate dealers, which nuke the article too dear for the man of the people, John Chinaman has stepped into the field and supplied as with vege table* where the Europeans could not make a living at it, and although probably there would be a little prejudice against taking animal food through the Chinamen, it is evident that "John " could utilise the now wafted bounties of Providence greatly to his own gain and ours also. The following paragraph is u going the rounds," and it will sound oddly by the side of ?toriesofwantanddestitution:—" Miscalculated that over 300,000 rabbits must have been de stroyed within the last few months on Or. Stod dart's station, near Colac. They have not been counted, but the calculation has been made in the following manner:—On one 320-acre pad dock there were 731 wombat hales; 631 of these were so blocked up that it was impossible for the rabbits in them to escape; out of the re maining 140 holes 4,000 rabbits were killed by means of traps or by digging out Taking, therefore, an average, the number in the 631 bloeked-up holes would be, say, 25,000, making a total of 29,000 for the paddock. In other paddocks 8,000 holes have been blocked up, and it is supposed that rabbits were quite as nume rous in tHese as in the 100 holes where the rabbits were killed and counted. Taking this as a guide, the total number killed in the 8,000 holes would be 320,000, or a grand total of 349,000 rabbits. There are no wombat holes on the remaining half of the run, it being thickly intersected with stones, and here the rabbits are as nume rous as ever; so it is only fair to presume that there must at the commencement of the slaugh ter have been at least three-quarters of a million of rabbits. Fifteen years ago Dr. Stoddart made two unsuccessful attempts to breed rabbits on his run. The Austrian Count "Attems," whom the Sydney and Brisbane people vae go delighted to honor, has come to grief. The following is a translation of a paragraph in the Handdibiad, a BaUvian journal of October 21 :— " Sourabaya, October 5, 1868. "The commander of the Austrian yacht, Hamlet's Ghost, who has arrived in this port, has made a complaint to the English Consul that on his voyage to this place, when close under the Java Coast, he had met an English ship, that on firing a salute in honor of the British flag, the salute was not returned. Now we read in a newspaper of Passarawang the following, which clears up the mystery:— Commander Said Alsegaf, in charge of the British brig Diamond, which has arrived here from Probolingo, with Rattinese horses, men tions that he had been attacked near Boyoeki by a Prussian'or Russian cutter of about 8 kojangs (13 tons): that the cutter fired a blank cartridge across his vessel, and afterwards one with ball. On his threatening to sink the yacht she ceased firing. This yacht must be the same which Said Alsegaf had already met at Koepang, in Timor. She was manned by Eu ropeans and belonged to Sydney." Other advices state that information of the "Count's expected arrival was telegraphed from Batavia to Sourabaya, some Batavian mer chants having been advised of his doings in Sydney. This warning led to enquiry, and it was found that the fellow had already per suaded a Bank to "do" a bill for him. The Bank, however, finding that the Count had " done" them, had him arrested, and it is now said that an "Austrian Count" passed some fictitious paper on an Amsterdam Bank about this time last year under similar pretences. The probability is, that the Batavian Govern ment win he quite ready to delegate to Sydney the duty of inflicting upon this accomplished swindler the punishment be deserves, and it is, therefore, not improbable that his enthusiastic admirers, male and female, in the eastern metropolis, may have the pleasure of seeing their distinguished friend again. Many of them will doubtless regret the abolition of the stocks and the whipping post. Our Attorney-General is busily engaged in ?niti.tiiig reforms. One of the changes con templated is tile breaking up of the Chinese encampments, which are to be found at the principal gold-fields. It is believed by many that disease is generated by the herding together of these people in dirty ill-ventilated and rickety dwellings, and that the crimes and immoralities which are undoubtedly prevalent among them would be lessened if they were more scattered amongst the European popula tion and thus kept under surveillance. It is argued on the other hand, however, that the very isolation of these people in camps and village* rather lessens than otherwise their op portunities to do wrong. However, the various Borough Councib are appealed to for informa tion, and we shall probably have the whole Chinese question discussed on the reassembling of Parliament Vinegrowing is- not in this colony the old established industry that it is in South Aus tralia, but an evidence of its having now attained to a position of importance as one of our national resources is afforded by Friday's Qa&tte;, which contains a series of regulations affecting vineyard stills. Your vignerons may wish to compare the Victorian regulation* with those of yonr colony, and therefore I give the principal of them. The others relate to the providing separate room* under lock and key, labelling spirit cask* and keeping quarterly accounts of the spirits made. Clauses 2 and 3 are a* follow* :— "2. Every proprietor of vineyard licensed to distil spirits for fortifying his wine shall keep on the premises for which he is so licensed a book or diary, to be specially used for the pur pose, in which shall be entered a record of all proceedings connected with such distillation, the date* on which the still may have been in use, the quantity of spirits made on such day and the* strength thereof, and the manner in which the spirits bo distilled may have been dis posed of; and shall, when required by an Inspector or other officer of distilleries, produce or deliver such book or diary for his inspection; and shall also, at leant three day* previous to uaiag the said still, at any time forward by post, or deliver to the Inspector or other officer of distilleries stationed nearest to his premises as before mentioned, a notice stating the date on which he intends to commence distillation, and the period daring which he intends to carry it oa. "3. The cellar or store- room required by the 13th and 18th sections of the Act to be provided for the storage of spirits shall be kept for that purpose only, and no other liquid of any kind, except ?pints made at the licensed still, shall be deposited therein. If a portion of the wine cellar is used for the purpose, such portion shall be securely partitioned off, so as to be capable of being securely locked if necessary, and no other liquid than spirits shall be kept therein.'* It is to be hoped that these regulations, if they am upheld in their stringency, will operate a* a check npon the undue use of the still in our vineyards. Except in the case of wines for exportation, or the process of ?*?*ing f^. mentation in certain wines which may thereby be rendered more palatable to the ladies, the less we have of it in our vineyards the better. A cue of snake poisoning which is likely to be of infinite importance occurred on Monday morning to Mr. John Brown, Stationmaster on' the MeUmunu and Brighton line. A brown ?aake, nearly three feet long, was apparently killed by a platelayer on the line and thrown up on to the platform. It was picked up by Brown, who, a* the men state, struck it with his hand, and thereby grazed hi* fore finger against the poison fang. He himself said he had been bitten, sad this appears to be bone out by tile fact of the wound exhibiting two email punc ture*. Thinking Bothi?g of it at first, he after ward* became eomatoae, and was taken to Dr. Arnold's, at St Kflda, who applied the usual remedies of excision and frequent dose* of am monia and ftimulaat*. He was sinking rapidly, under this treatment with every prospect of a fatal termination. Mr. W. O. a'Beekett, Burgeon, of St. KJlda, was sent for in consulta tion, and he applied galvanism, which had a marked but temporary effect Professor Hal ford afterward* came, and upon the application of hi* new remedy—die injection of ammonia into the system, by opening a vein—the patient speedily rerorered consciousness (nearly 12 hoar* after bring bitten), and is now in a fair way of remvery. This u the first opportunity Dr. Hetferdhas had of personally experiment in, on a human being. Although in a case at Beechworth the ether day. another medical man tried tit* remedy, which Dr. Halford bad found efiUa^sUhfciexperimenUone>gs,andwtth The work* for the permanent fixing of the new equatorial telescope at the Observatory have been commenced, and to give some idea of the earn which ha* been taken to ensure solidity of bad* for tike great spaoe-test, I may inform you that the substratum wffl be a nearly solid pieee of stonework, patent axed on the face, about 20 feet by 7 feet, 20 feet in height, 16 or 17 above ground, resting on an 18-inch founda tion of concrete.
