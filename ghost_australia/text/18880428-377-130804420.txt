ST. STEPHEN'S CHURCH, MA MA CREEK. [FROM A CORRESPONDENT.] The above church was solemnly opened on Satur day, the 21st, by the Ven. Archdeacon Jonc\es, of Toowoomba, assisted by the Rev. J. Hurt The day's services commenced with a hymn, succeeded by a prayer dedicating the church to the worship of the Holy Trinity, and in honour of the first martyr, St. Stephen. Then followed shortened matins, with an adult baptism. After the Benedictus had been sung, the memorial altar was solemnly conse- crated to sacred uses by the Archdeacon. The Communion Service was then held, and many par- took of the sacred myteries. About 1 30 p.m. refreshments were provided on the ground, near the church, and 150 persons partook of an excellent tea, genernusly provided by the lady members of the congregation. At 3.30 p m. evensong was sung, and the Archdeacon again administered the sacra- ment of Holy Baptism and preached a very impres-. sive sermon, dwelling especially on the human body being the temple of the Holy Ghost, and speaking of the life of St. Stephen as a pattern life for the young. Before giving the blessing, the Archdeacnon thanked the congregation for their untiring zeal in making the day so successful, and congratulated them on the beautiful temple they had erected for the worship of Almighty God. The church was crowded at both services, which were most impres- sive. I think the most beautiful features of the services were the adult baptism and the good be- haviour of the little children, who, on each occasion, sat on the steps of the sanctuary, so that there might be more sitting-room for their elders in the body of the elurch.
