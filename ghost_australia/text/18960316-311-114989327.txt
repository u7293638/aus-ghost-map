A Floral Wonder of Panama. Tho Holy Ghost flower, or Flor del Espiritu Santo, is found in the region of tho Isthmus of Panama. It seems to thrive in low, marshy spots, and springs up from decayed logs or from crevices in tho rocks. Tho larger nnd older bulbs frequently send up tho leaf stalks six or seven feet in height and from these, which are joined, broad lanoeolated leaves uro thrown out in pairs. The plant is an annual, and in Juno, July and August the flower stnlks start up from tho base of tho bulb, devoting nil their energies to tho formation of the buds. The buds are arranged on the stalks much liko those of tho hyacinth, tho usual number for a well-grown stalk to boar from twelve to fifteon. Tho leaves are very pule green in color, as though in harmony with the delicate purity of bho blossom. The blossom is of an alabaster whiteness, much liko the old* Stylo English pulpit. This, of itself, is strikingly curious hut it fades into insigni ficance when ono looks into tho centre of that, strange blossom, for thoro, nestling in its very heart, is thuf perfect image of a dovo. It requires no imagination to see it. No ono could mistake it for anything olso, for no human skill could fashion its shape moro perfectly, no artist could adorn it with moro elegant tints, and no perfumer could endow it with a moro delicate frngrance, Right in the cup of tho blossom, with tho snow white canopy vabout. it, rests this wondrous image, its delicately mould* d wings droop ing, half extended at its sido, its gold-tinted head bent slightly forward, and its tiny, crimson-tipped bill almost touohing its snowy breast. An observer who saw io in its native homo, says : " Just as the fk'uro of the dove itself is tlu re, beyond dispute, so docs an expression pervado tho image, an expresMon that oven tho most cnrelops cannot fail to notice, tho incarnation of humility aud spiritual purity."
