A Curious Story. The following (says the European Mail of March 26) is reported by a Scotch paper to have taken place at a wedding which was being cele brated the other evening in a quiet place on the oouthern confines of Angus. The bridegroom waB a worthy septuagenarian, and the bride a buxom widow fully thirty years his junior. The bridegroom had been deprived only seven months ago of the partner for nearly half a cen tury of his joys and sorrows, who had left him with a considerable number of " dry notes." The neighbours took unusual iuterest in the wedding, and two constables attended to preserve order. The clergyman having been admitted, the outer door of the building was locked to pre vent intrusion. The only wedding guests other than the rev. gentleman were three or four fe males. During the proceedings there appeared all of a sudden " a lady in white" gliding into the room. She offered a shake hands with the women, who screamed fiercely, and then 6he said, " I'm M G , come for my siller. Willie S (meaning her grave digger) haslet ipe oot for a short time, an' if I denna get it the noo I'll be back, Guidnicht!" On which the ghost quietly withdrew.
