: A PBEACHEB FOB THE FBONT, What the High Church party will lose In England the High Church party in South A Â£- .l'ica will gain, says the' "King," for Canon Knox Little is off to the. front to minister to the soldlcc on the field of battle, and to ex- hort him with that wonderful eloquence that haB held congregations of rich and poor alike, spellbound and is always thought of In con nection with his name. It would be easier to say where the Canon has not preached than to enumerate the pulpits he has occupied, and wherever lie has gone he has always found crowds to listen to him. His delivery, his great command of language, ills beautiful metaphors, and his interesting personality are famous all over the country, and though to-day he Is, well advanced in years and the voice Is a little harder and moro strained, tho attraction Is there just the same. A promi nent High Churchman, a member of that union of which Lord Halifax is president, he has wot, however, entered bitterly Into the controversy that rages continually in tho Church, "and his popularity by no means ex tends to- thoss of his own opinions alone. In the cloisters of Worcester Cathedral, of which .he was made a Canon by Mr. Gladstone, ho is said to commune with the ghosts that haunt it, and report has It that so deep is his belief In these visitants that they have entered largely Into his career.- Canon Knox Little has gone to the war at the special re quest of Lord Roberts, who has a great ad-, miration for him, another magnet being the Canon's son, who Is fighting for his country,. Besides this son the Canon has several other children. The greatest serrnon he ever preached was on the text, "He Is chlefest among 10,000; He. is altogether lovely." It was a superb piece of oratory, and those who heard It will not forget It to their dying day.
