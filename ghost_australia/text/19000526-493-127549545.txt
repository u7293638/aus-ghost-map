POETRY. I \- THE VIOLIN. .'She stood tad plsyad, lsrge-eyed and and, vWith that old, subtle graco she had, : Drawing her bow with bending wrist, i And I, with head thrown back to liet. Heard stir a troubled ghost within That slender, vibrant riolin ! A ghost that turned and peered and aung, (Oh, the dear past upon its tongue !) It wept and laughed and wept more loud, And I, cloBe listening, with head bowed, .Knew a stilled voice waB singing in ?That pulsing, straining violin. It drooped and, wavering, fell away .To sobbing silencc ; then, less gay , .It Boated and. tremulous, Bunfe to rest, And back my heart flew to my breast, '(O hoping done ! O fondeat sin ! O sweet, ghoBt-haunted violin !)
