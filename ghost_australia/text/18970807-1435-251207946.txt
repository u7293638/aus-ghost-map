A Song. (JOHN REEVES SUTTON, IN Lotus). Come, boys, pile up the crackling logs, Be merry while we mav 1 Outside the winds shriek through the boge, Tbe w&iling; cat3 and howling dogs Give portent of the day . We die! Long life to death ! Come, take the jug and fill your glass, And drink to all a toast; The modeBt wife, the shameless lass; Life is but short, and s ion we pass 1 From flesh and blood to ghost; We die!' Long life to death I Come, while away the passing hoar And give rib need to time! The tjevil take tbe Crabb'd and sour, We'll drink a toast to him whose power None can withstand. A crime To die! Lone life to death 1'
