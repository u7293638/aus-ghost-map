I (from On Empirt't Corrttpondtnt.) | MAïcn 15rn -Our escort this week will rather astonish yon of the metropolis, as it conveys above 10,000 OES (ton thousand ounoes) and leaves 8000 on in the camp for want of conveyance Of a truth havo " tbo good old times' returned in mining matters, and Ballaarat is rivalled, soon to be eclipsed, and thrown into tie shade, by the long hidden treasures of the Lachlan About 120 holes are all, as jet bottomed, and not one-half of those olaimB have washed a single load of " stutt " To men- tion some patches out ot buckets, and Bingle maohinea of twenty losas each, vould astonish the oldest ot the genus diggers and, as actually half buckets of gold are seen handled, and sighed or gloried over daily, we shall see a stampede set in towards this quarter unequalled in the annals of digging home diflioulty as to tracing the Viotona load oaused no little discussion during the past week, and two meet- ings to solve the question were held, and a wish ei Íiressed on the part of the Victoria lead men to stop the urther working of tbo Caledonian lead until 'io doubt as to its being an integral part of tho Viotori» lend be olesred np, seeing the Viotona lead is the oldest ocoupted of the two Tho prospectors of the Caledonian washed eight pounds on Friday night, out of two or three buckets , and Bbares are up to £400 eaoh, near the upper end.
