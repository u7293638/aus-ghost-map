ÜHE "QUEEN" AND POPE* TOAST. JtüLSEWHERE we give our view of what we concieve to be the merits of the sectarian controversy now raging. Tn this colnmn we alinde to it again only for the purpose of drawing attention to the following fact? :-(1) A General Election is impending. (2) We have more important matters to consider than the relat've merits of holv water and Boyne watpr «rd the like. (3) Thax electors «bonld vote for men as men, and because fch«»v favor reform and progress, and not bficanse they are either Catholics or Protestant«. (4) That these outbreaks of intolerance are generally timed for a General Election so as to divert people's minds from more important subjects. (5) That being so, the electors should have j nothing to do with anyone who] attempts to holst himself into Parlia- j ment by fomenting sectarian animosi- j ties. (6) That the maxim of the State should be in religious matters as in all else, "Equal rights to all, special privileges to none." (7) That the electors should not be led away from their plain duty by the ghost of King Pilly or any other ecclesiastical will o' ¡the wisp. (8) That priestly inter- ference in politics should not be tolerated.
