A Living Ghost. Walking In Her Sleep. Is the dark hours of a recent Sunday morning, eays the Hobart (Tasmania) Mercury, a young man was wending his way homewards past the disused burial ground in Campbell street, when he saw a tall, white robed figure stalking among the tombs. He did not run away, but " went for " the ghost, only to find it was a young woman in her role de chambre, and in sound sleep. While meditating as to what was to be done, he was made aware of a man similarly attired, who asked bis business in a rather gruff sort of way. Explanations followed, and it came out that the ghostly looking figure was the wife of a respectable artisan, who, missing her from hie side, rose from his bed and went to look for her, and found her wandering in the gloomy . necropolis.
