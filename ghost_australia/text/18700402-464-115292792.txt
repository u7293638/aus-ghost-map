ROME. THE COUNCIL. The tenth general congregation was held in the Vatican Basilica on the 14th. Mass was said by Mgr. Limberti, Archbishop of Florence. The Fathers were then invited by the Cardinal President to proceed to the election of the Commission of Missions and Oriental Rites, .which will be presided by Cardinal Barnabo, Prefect of Propaganda* While the votes were being collected in baskets by . the secretaries of the Council, two new schemata relating to the subject of Ecclesiastical Discipline were distributed to the Fathers. The discussion which had pre viously occupied the attention of the .Coun cil is terminated, and the schema is referred to the Commission de Fide. The first speakers on the question of Discipline were Cardinal Schwarzenberg, Archbishbpr of Prague ; Cardinal Mathieu, Archbishop of Besan^on ; Mgr Ballerini, Latin Patriarch of Alexandria ; Mgr Simon, ArchbishopPri mate of Gran ; and Mgr Monson y Martins, Archbishop of Grenada. The discussion was to be resumed on the following day. We should only deceive our readers by pretending to give any authentic account of what passed in the Tenth Congregation. The statements volunteered in Protestant; journals are either guesses or inventions. The Fathers are bound to secrecy, and Cardinal de Angelisis said to have reminded .'.themlpnce more, on the 14th,, that, rjothing could relieve thera' froni this /obligation, which wiis ^trictjy '6b^eirVed(pi f pjrti&f; Coun cil&K;'IThe public is only 48lt^ie4i;by:r]tlie: .idle, tsjiles of newspaper reporter^; ^OJ^ect, to be in personal' coninluniQatjion jvii^hj Bishops, who do not! know them, £n4; vfou.ic!; not give them any information! ; i£. |h-ey ',&&,' Buft-if .we do nofejands(janiio^:pqiSs^.,.any; knowledge of what passed, . it , is 'at least ,cern tain,:foron this point the; Bishops ar£ not restrained from speakings opjenly, that} they enjoy the most unlimited freedom of digcua; aioni .; : 'Considering; ;ttat;;;they. i; were '; sujn; ? moned- torthe Council .

We shall profit jberes after by the result of deliberations of which we 'only know at, present that, in wisdom and learning, they are worthy of the chief pastors to whose care the .flock of Christ has been committed. Whatever be the; final issue of their meditations and . discussions; the Church will accept it, when confirmed by the Supreme Pontiff, as the teaching of the Holy Ghost. . ??' . We have an interesting account from one ?of our correspondents of the religious: ser vices in the Church of St. Andrea , della Valle, which commenced on the Epiphany, and in which so many illustrious Prelates of all. nations have taken part. The first Mass is at half-past five, followed by an Italian ser mon at six, after, which Benediction of the Most Holy Sacrament is. given. There is High Mass at nine, celebrated according to the Latin, and again at.ten, according to one of the Oriental Kites. Of the latter we are told that 'the language, the vestments, the frave and majestic figures of these Eastern 'relates, with their flowing beards, seem to place us in the presence of St. Cyril, St. Athanasius, or St. Chrysostom, and attract a crowd of attentive strangers of various nationalities, who recognise, under external ?differences of form, that unchanging identity of faith which unites in one Body, and under one Head, the members of all the Churches throughout the world.' At eleven there is a sermon in English, German, or Spanish, and at two in French. At half -past five crowds may be seen in all the neighbouring Piazzas, gathered round preachers, ' Svegli arini' — 'awakeners' — who know how to touch the heart, though they follow another model than the magnificent orations deli vered in the Church of St. Andrea della Valle. As to the latter, we are assured that any passage bearing upon the great questions before the .Council is always heard with deep ?emotion. The French Bishop of Tulle was listened to with breathless interest when he reproved, in language of great elevation, the pusillanimity of those who affect to appre hend danger from the expected definitions of the Council. Why, he asked, did the Babe of Bethlehem come at the time and in the manner He did? Surely neither the moment nor the place were ' opportune.' His doc trines, as the world thought, were still more 4 'inopportune.' And the world crucified its Saviour. But the world, continued the venerable Bishop, now, as then, is in darkr ness, its great want is light. Let then the Church give it light, and the world will live. ' Yivent les ames,' he added, with an energy, which stirred every heart, ' perissent les erreurs' ! ; ? . : The Bishop of Poitiers preached on the 14fch to an immense congregation. The successor of S. Hilary, it was fitting that he should preach on S. Hilary's day. The ser mon, is, said to have produced a profound impression, and ..one hearer says of it : 'It was more than a sermon, it was an event.' As it will be printed immediately, Catholics of all nations -will- be able to profit by it. ? But even the Bishop of Poitiers, whose name is dear to all Christians, did not surpass another; illustrious .Prelate, who, although a Swiss, has been called the Chrysostom of the French pulpit. The discourse of Mgr Mermillod, Bishop of Hebron and Coadjutor of Geneva, was one of the most remarkable ever heard from his lips. He preached from the text: 'The weak things of the world hath God chosen.to con found the strong.' Bethlehem, the Taber nacle, and the Vatican : a babe, a host, and a feeble old man ; these are three resistless powers in the hand of God. This was the thought developed by Mgr. Mermillod. In describing the fear and agitation caused by the wnpious teaching of Arius, he drew a piqtitre , ii*j 1 wjiich; every :.| one; -yecognise^ the pjesQtttj .condition; of society,;-an.ci ^en-pre-i dieted ainid ;th#, tears of his a.u-iien.c.e,ithat, the ;r,emedy ^applied so ©ffec^ayy by the Qcjuttou^oi^NJee would be, applied .?vyith aiiaiiar, ifesujlts, by ;the Council.^ .th#!

On Sunday, the 9th, the Holy Father gave auaience az tne v atican to a muiuituae of the faithful, estimated at twelve or fifteen hundred. Kis Holiness ascended his throne, and began by observing that to speak to such an assembly one by one, as he desired to do, was not possible, both on account of his. continual fatigues, and the length of time which would be required. . ' You have come here for two things,' continued the Holy Father ; ' to see the Pope, and to re ceive his benediction. You behold the Pope, and' as to the benediction, you will receive it after I have addressed a. few words to you. The subject of these reflections I will take from the Gospel of the day : the findingof our Lord in tbe temple.' After reminding the assembly of the answer given by our Lord to His Blessed Mother and S. Joseph, that he had quitted them, in spite of the sorrow which His absence would oc casion them, 'to do the will of His Heavenly Father,' the Sovereign Pontiff went on thus : ' This saying of our Lord is designed to teach us that we also are upon earth for no other purpose than to do the will of our Father who is in Heaven. It is to obey this Divine will that I have gathered together the Coun cil now assembled in the Vatican, which at this moment attracts the attention of the whole world. Some say that the Council will arrange everything, and put an end to all the divisions which exist among men ; but the hearts and minds of men can only be changed by our Heavenly Father, Who ?alone has power to renew the face of the earth. Others believe that it will accom plish nothing, and speak of it with derision. I am a poor and miserable man, but I am the Pope, the Vicar of Jesus Christ, the head of the Catholic Church, and I have called together this Council, which will do what it is appointed to do. Certain pre tended wise men, blind leaders of the blind, desire that particular questions be avoided, and that nothing be done contrary to the prevailing ideas of the age. But I tell you that the truth must be pro claimed in order that liberty may be established, and that we must never fear either to proclaim truth or to condemn error. I wish to be free myself .and that truth' should be free. As. to. the affairs of this world, I have nothing to do with them. My business is with the affairs of God, of the Church, of the Holy See, and of the whole Christian society.' Offer then your prayers, your tears, your supplications, so that you may constrain the Holy Spirit to fortify and enlighten the Fathers of the Council, that truth may triumph and error be condemned. There are among; you Ca tholics of all nations, English, French, Spanish, Germans, who have come to seek strength and consolation at the Ghaifl of Peter. O my God, send forth Thy Holy Spirit, hear and answer the prayers of Thy whole people, and bless this people which is Thine. And you all who are here assembled around me- receive the benediction which I 1 ? i ?'? . ? ,'?
