Thubsday, Januaey 9. '{Before Messrs. H. B. Downer, S.M., T. Reid, J.P , and Dn Moore; J.P.] ' - C SioDiaaT and A. A. Faibclotigh v. Smith AND Stetstabt. — £10, for money due, and £90, damages for, breach of agreement. Mr. Pater . for the plaintiffs; Mr. Stuart for the defen dants, who pleaded a set;off of £3, and that the contract was conditional. The i-lajatigs were proprietors of a Ghost Illusion variety Trojips, and on November 21 were travelling in the ' South'Epst. On that day they took four tickets to travel in the defendants' coach irom Eeacbpojrt to Robe:, but the defendants refused .to take them to the latter place uutil-they had , paid a sum of £3 owing by them- on a previous occasion for trap-hire from Millicerit to Beacli- ' pert. Tbe plaintiffs offered their cheque for the amount but the defendants-refused to take' it, although they were told that the plaintiffs would lose the next steamer from Robe to A ie laide, and would be delayed ten daje, besides incurring considerable loss and expense. la consequence of this delay the plaintiffs were unable to proceed on their professional trip through the ^Northern districts^ arid were de barred from any pecuniary advantages ':. that' would have accrued from it. Mr. Stuart con tended that there was a eondifeion implied— that plaintiffs should pay the £3 before they should be allowed to avail themselves of the tickets bought from the defendauW agent. The Court ruled that tbe defendants could not go behind the contract-, expressed on 'tbe tickets. Mr. Stnart called no evidence, but .addressed himself to the question of damages, and endeavored to show that the damages claimed were excessive, and that -the 'prospec tive profits to accrue from the Northern trip were too remote. Verdict for the plaintiffs for £27 by consent, casts to be taxed on a higher scale. . ,
