EXTR1OEDWAK\' MOUNTAIN MYSTEET A GOLDITELD STORY. CI gave a promise to Margaret Drood,* he says, ' which. I do not want to break. I have borrowed lier horse, and wish, to return it safely. If you. intend to go at once to Caledonia, I am content to go as a prisoner ?with the rest, and ask only one favor at your hands — that is, that you -will let me see and talk with Mag. I heard something said a moment ago which led me to think that you meant to wait here for reinf orce- Tnents — ' ' 1 see,' said Stanhope, ' and you don't want to wait.' Then he turned to Vernet. ' Van, what do you intend? Others besides Dutton would be glad to set out for Cale donia. There's that old man Stephen Wray— ' * True,' said Vernet 5 and then he glanced I at Dutton and hesitated. Cool Han3c promptly took the hint, nodded understandingly to Stanhope and walked slowly along the bank of the creek. When he had passed out of hear ing distance, he halted, faced about and stood waiting. * That fellow's a perfect riddle,' said Vernet, looking after him j « he's well named.' . « ?Yes. However, I think I begin to understand him. Leave him to me. Van. Cool Hank will open his lips at the right time. Now, what is your plan ?' * Why, -we are not a strong guard, Dick, and this is how I left matters at the Over land oflice ; they are to muster their strength, drivers and all, and as many out siders as they know iihey can trust. They counted on a reinforcement, too, by yester day's coach from the east. They expect to be strong enough to take matters into their own hands. Their plan was to -wait, and if we didn't come back or send a mes senger ?within a given time, they were to set out 5n search of us. Jfow, as we have run' down our game so soon, I think we will send some one to Caledonia to carry ?the news and bring help. We can't leave these wounded men, and we can't 'take them -until assistance comes.* 'Good! I'll be the man to carry the news; and 111 take Cool Hank and Mr. Wray, and be responsible for their- good behavior.' * Very welL Sow lef s go up tike hill and bring in our three prisoners.' * Dutton/ said Stanhope, as they ap proached Gool Hank, pfei there a better or a shorter way to Caledonia than, that by which -we camer along the coach, road, you know, and across that ingenious draw bridge?' ' Yes/ answered CooTHank. * Thermit you'll lead the way, we -wSl &et; ' out for Caledonia in. fifteen minutes. Where did yon. leave Mag's horse ?' 'A quarter of a mile from the creek? \- Well, get him, and bring him nearer. You'll have to change horses, if there is one that's fresher in that hidden stable. Can yon. lead the -way ixt-4foa-trtobS' Cool Hank hesitated. * I can/ inierpo«ed Vernet, and there are tea good horses there, Dutton, we've £ofC@d 8O {puck out of Hedley, that you. m&Y; apeak -wailumt fear tnat_yori!*re be troyi»g your comrades, *43«ntleJ»e»-'6s3d OooTHanl^ earnestly, ?

' Yes.' ' And perhaps you remember all that I told you about his interview with Mack ?' ' Yes, yes.' 'Well, I think that for some reason Dittos, and Selwyn have changed identi ties. Wouldn't that explain it F' * Why, yes. If they have been taking him for Selwyn, and are aware, as they must be by this time, that Selwyn is dead, that would explain, it. What do you make of the fellow, anyhow.' * I'll tell you. I've heeii studying him, and I believe I've hit somewhere near the truth. The trapping of Wray and holding him for ransom was Selwyn's work, and was planned and executed ?without the knowledge or consent of Lieuteha.nt Dut ton. He rebelled, against it ; that 'was the one desperate deed that he could not wink at. He wanted to set Wray free, and they differed about it. As for the de coying of Miss Wray here, I don't believe that Cool Hank knew anything of it. I expect that was what Mack whispered to him — the one thing- 1 didn't manage to hear that eight in the secret chamber. Now, supposing my notions to have some foun dation, can't you put yourself in his place — can't you see that he could not offer anything like a true statement of his case without making himself appear a coward, if no worse ?' ' Well, yes, supposing what you think to be true. And hasn't it occurred to you that there may be another reason for his reticence r' 'Another? what?' * Possibly he can't make h-ia case very clear without implicating himself in that murder business.' ' Umph !' said Stanhope, keeping his face set steadily up the hill, ' possibly !' But his friend knew that there was scepticism in his tone. ? They found the three prisoners just as they had been left, and drove them back, after releasing their feet, at the muzzles of their own pistols. They found Cool Hank. Dutton sitting at the base of the rocky wall, and Mountain Mag's favorite steed, Nick, grazing near the stream. As they approached with their ^ prisoners, Hank arose and began to scale the rocks ahead of them. The 'morning was well advanced' when Vernet and Stanhope appeared again among their companions. Dalton and Strong were busy over the fire, which they had rekin dled. .They had found the storehouse of the robbers, and were preparing a meaL Doctor Mitchell and Stephen Wray sat apart from the rest, in earnest con versation. If the horrible suggestion of Blowey had struck the heart of the father with a palsy of terror, the conflict had roused the man, and, shackled as he was, he had fought valiantly. It was Dan Strong who had struck off his fetters, and no words were needed to tell them all that here was the missing father, of Barbara Wray. He told his story briefly, and it proved that the detectives, in constructing a theory had hit the truth. And he could not hear too much of his daughter. They told him of the forged letter, and how it had deceived both Barbara and 3£r. FoUingsbee ; how she had arrived in Cale donia, and of her grief and consternation upon learning that he was not there. But they did not name Duke Selwyn j and when they told how she had found a friend in Mountain i£ag, and a home at the ranch, they did not mention the attack and attempt to abduct Barbara. ' I see it all now,' Stephen Wray said,, fixing his keen eyes upon Vernet's face, * and I'll never again trust myself as a reader of the ' human face divine,' It was the zaan Selwyn who planned all this. It never occurred to me to suspect him, until it was too late. When I reached Ca ledonia there was a letter from Selwyn awaiting me in the post-office. It was hy his written directions that I called for it before-registering at the hotel. In it he deplored the necessity for Ms presence in Bockville on the day -when I would arrive, and gave most plausible reasons. It was for our mutual benefit, he said, and might result in considerable gain. He suggested that X drop my identity. I remember the very words? ** In- such, a place as C ? /' he said, **-libereTnigh.t be adventurers from N, Y. who would fail to recognise your name if xtot your face. To be known as a man of -wealth, nere is simply to court dan ger.

' ? f - -y . 1 Is that fellow among these men ?' asked Vernet quickly. * Yes,' answered the old millionaire, with a nod toward tihe row of still, shrouded forms, 'he's there, and I shan't mourn Tn-m.' * And all the time that you have been a prisoner, you have never seen the leader of this band ?' queried Stanhope. ' Never once .' That ruffian, Blowey, has , been the go-between. Perhaps I committed a blunder by boldly declaring that I sus pected Selwyn ; but I had got my eyes open at last, and although they denied all knowledge of such a person, I could see by their manner that I had startled them, and they were puzzled how to act. They sent a man to confer with their leader, and in the meantime left me ^pretty much alone. But when they got their orders, the game began. They bullied and threat ened. One they got kp a hanging farce, and actually had. me at the end of a rope. But I knew that my neck was safe, and I laughed at them. About two weeks ago I tried to escape. It was the first chance that I had found, and the force -was weak ened by half a dozen ; but they caught me in the act, and then Blowey chained me by the leg. I got so desperate, at last, that I told Blowey I would negotiate for my freedom — that was little more than a week ago — if he would bring me face to face with the ringleader. . I took it for granted that Selwyn was the man, and for the first time Blowey forgot to deny it. He sent away a messenger that same night, and they did not approach me again on the subject for two days. Then the messenger come back, and he must have brought some startling news, for it set them all in a flutter, and Blowey afterward grew daily more aggressive. Messengers were coming and going ; raiding parties have been scouting and coming back sullen and almost empty handed 5 my position was growing more and more difficult to endure as the robbers' schemes began to miscarry. Good Heavens '.' cried the old man, look' Tig about 1't», as if for the first time he fully realised the peril from which he had been rescued, ' if I hod known, during1 this last miserable week, that my daughter had been so nearly dragged into the toils, the villains would have had me at their mercy. Now, I will spend thrice the money they wanted to extort from me, to find and punish that renegade, Selwyn.' 1TO 3E COHTOTUED.)
