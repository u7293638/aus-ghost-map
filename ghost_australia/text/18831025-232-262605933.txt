• THE "WHY AND WHEREFORE." What is to blame for the terrible state of things Is tbe mother country ? It is not that England, the world's banker, cannot support her noos and daughters as decently as Belgium, Denmark, and other poorer countries It is because England pampers a favored few of her sous and daughters at the cost of the many. These "accidents of accidents" are allowed to dear the vecpl^ off the land to make room for gsms, to afford them the morbid and murderous pleasure of shooting them down, while the masses in the crowded cities are crying— " Why are we housed like filthy swine? Swine? they tzavebetter care; "Tor we are pent on with the plague- Shut out from light and air. We work and wear our lives away To heap this dty*s wealth; But labor God decreed for us— Us man denies a * health." Vdl may the poor woman driven from the country tnto the back slums say, as she recalls the past— 4 1 1 used to throw my basement wide To breathe the morning's breath; But sow X keen tbe window dose— The air smells so like death. Once only, on my window-aiQ, I placed a little flower, Something to tell me of the fields— It withered in an hour." What can she expect her child's future to be, bora and reared sxoldst such -surroundings f In \- vain she longs to be able to ramble with him In the country, where the gentry «re knocking down tbe birds. She exclaims— "Oh/woold thai I could lead my child Over the meadows green, And see fahn playing with the flowers Bit eyesliave never seen!
