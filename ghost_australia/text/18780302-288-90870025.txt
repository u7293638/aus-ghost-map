THE MYSTERIES OF CEIME: OB, The ExMEBnarGss of as* EDarsiraaH Deteoite.— No. IiXXV. [Published by special arrangement with the Author.] HAUNTED, It may have been thought strange that ' in speaking of the ' Haunted House ' be yond Lovers' Loan, which now sheltered both the Human and Jem Congo, I did not allude to the story which gave it the evil reputation, nor pause to describe the peculiar : form which the visitation was supposed to assume ; but that I had a reason for my silence will be clearly seen from the follow ing curious easel Singularly enough itnow ', falls to me to give two ghost stories run- ? sing, both interesting in themselves, and Btill more so from their intimate conhectioi with the string of cases I have latterly been trying to link into something like the order mwhichthey occurred. , .? :;_ *'' r : A day or two after the escape of Simon Penbank from the cellar in the Happy Land — it must have been on th|Tlf-ffipf No vember, as wiitbe seen presently— I was. : sitting by the fire in the sergeant's room a!,; the Office, when an 'elderly lady appeared, and asked 'to see a detective, whom eha , named.

'Exactly. I am glad to hear you speak so frankly ,;' she said^ with an instantaneous unbending: of her. hard features.' - '^You- niean torhint that I am no beauty, but that I am one jadt to be influenced by trifles P' -?: I bowed. : : ?' . ,.:.?.; .: .'.-.; ? ? ? ??- :';: , ? u Well, you. -.have exactly hit my cha racter. I am not amiable— make no pre tensions to it— most persons, I suspect, look upon. me as a detestable crab^tickof an old. maid — but mark me, the very worst never accused me of silliness or supersti tion. Now for the point in hand— I trust you are no believer in ghosts?' '??'-..? ' Not! in the ordinary .sense/' I slowly replied, after a moment's thought. 'I do not believe it possible for the spirits of the dead to reappear and go through' tangible actions; but I can conceive it possible for a person's health to be in such a state that they really^ imagine they see the living representation of the defunct person before them, and that, too, apart from any ob servable delirium or insanity.' 'Exactly— that is just what I myself always believed till lately. I .was no believer in ghosts — I even thought, as I do now, that not one-hundredth part of the ghost stories written had ever any founda tion whatever but .in the brain of the authors — and yet I, with all my scepticism —with all my firmnessand strength of will —am haunted!' tlDo you mean by a ghost, or by the recollection of some wrong P' I said, with some interest. ; The words were carelessly given, but, to my surprise, they appeared to strike home. The lady started at the words, then flushed, and then the whole expression of her face softened and clouded as she sighed out — 'By both. I know not what prompted you to put the question, but it strangely happens that your surmise is right in the double sense, and the wrong and the ghost are so intimately connected that it is im possible to speak of them separately. My name is Miss Glenroy. Some years ago I came into possession of a deal of money, though even before that time I was living in independence ; and, not liking the west, where I was brought up, I came through' to Edinburgh and bought Oakwood Villa, out at the Lovers' Loan, which I entered about two years ago.' 'What— the 'Haunted House?'' I exclaimed, interrupting her. 'I have heard about that place.' ' Yes, but it was not haunted then,' was the quiet reply, given a little sadly. 'The owner—one of your Edinburgh solicitors — had died, the place was adver tised for sale. I liked the lioase and the situation— a fine southern exposure — and I bought it. Now, to enable you to under stand what followed, I must tell you that the augmentation of my fortune which sent me to Edinburgh— and, indeed, caused the whole mischief — has a' curious history attacked to it. It came from my own uncle, a man only a few, years older than myself; Now, though there -was little intercourse between us, it was known to me that this uncle had what we called a half-brother — that is, an ille gitimate — who was only a few years younger than my uncle, but who, being his father's son, got leave to hang about the property— looking after it, living in it- and enjoying a moderate income; which he was allowed annually to deduct from the rents. Here I will be candid with you— it was generally understood and believed that this illegitimate brother, Peter McArthur by name, was, in the event of my uncle dying first, to come heir to the whole property- — I mean that there was a will to that effect drawn up by the father of both. However, no sooner was my uncle dead than this will was missed — stolen, some said, though if such were really the case1 1 can solemnly lay my hand on my heart, and swear that I at least knew nothing of the wrong. You will easily guess what followed — my half uncle, whom from my infancy, though I had never once placed eyes on him, I had been taught to shun and despise— the7 poor useless old man— had no legal right to remain— I was the only heir at ; law; and in my .?' heat, and gteed J of wealth, I -actually had him hounded ? forth in the depth . of ^winter, after a determined process of ejectment at l law, and with such-bitterness [that when he l came to my house to implore mercy, I ' actually refused to see Mm, tod had him - hurled forth by my servant.' : -- ?

In one of the win dow recesses was fixed a broad nutho^tnj desk, which, as it was not an encumbrance^ ? and was a useful article, I allowed .to re main. Well, I entered the house in ti»a month of March, and sawjnothing to disturb me till the evening, of the 15th of May— tiie day for the drawing of my rente.— Whether my mind had been running oh this fact, and the knowledge that part of my wealth was ill gotten, I know not, but r felt restlesa and uneasy during the whole evening, and when I at laat retired to rest it was only to toss about ;:|pr hours : the prey to stinging^remorse. The night, I. remember well, was' clear and bright^ and, ; my blinds being drawn up, I looked away ', over at the hills bathed in moonlight, wondering that' everything could be so peaceful while I was racked with care and grief. About 12 o'clock — now, 4o .not, smile, for I have since tried hard to prove . that it was not at the orthodox ghostly hour, but without suocess-rabout 12,, I say, I was startled by a soft footfall on the lobby leading to my 'bedroom. Yes, there was no doubt about it — there was distinctly audible a footfall— ao it was a walking, not. a gliding ghost. Thinking. it might be one of the servants, I paid no rheed to the sound till it approached the door of my roonu . Then a hand was gently laid on the brass knob — I could see it turned — the door ; opened, and an old man, white and bald headed with age, and attired in a suit of, faded black, entered, and, without taking the slightest notice of me or my presence, reclosed the door, walked straight to the '. mahogany desk at the: window, drew in a chair and sat down, and then, taking a packet of papers from his pocket, he be^tanto go through. the motions of arranging them in a certain order. At first . 1 had tried to scream, but somehow ,ti»e ^ sound died away in ,my throat, and, had he been a thief or a murderer, I am sure he could have accomplished my death without i me being able to raise a single cry of alarm., But, if bodily fear ;at firsti.poa- ? sessed my senses, it Very rapidly merged,, into supernatural horror as I came, to discover the fact that the spectre was - perfectly unconscious 'of my presence and, . to listen to the dreadful whispers that , issued in odd scraps from his rigid lips. At first I was too much frightened and astonished to take, note of its words, but, the moment I did so I was petrified, ''Another quarter-day come round,' , it ; noareely whispered, .with a vain search through the bundle; of papers, as if one ; were amisaing. fThe, will, I think, was , stolen— yes,butf or, a thing to be stolen there must first be a thief . A bill of ejectment— , threats, quarrels, then sheriff officer and process of law burrows. Cruel hag, she : will soon have my head in the \ grave. A cook — she calls herself a cook-^-and she persecutes my life out., Where is the grave^deep enough to hold her?1 As the spectre whispered, the words out he re- j tied the papers, started up, methodically , replaced tiie chair he had been uang, and : gilded out of the room in the same pensive and despondent way— passing close to the foot of niy bed, b'ut never opce looking . , towards me, and carefully closing the door behind him,?- ?',.-, ,:,.??: 3 -.

Here I accommodated the lady to the best of my ability with a seat on the edge of the bedstead, and then, turning down the shade of the lantern, I proceeded to pace the room backwards and forwards with : unceasing regularity in wait for the won derful ghost. I speak ; thus because I had not the slightest expectation of being disturbed. I had: formed a theory of my own on the matter, and though it was obviously full of flaws, I stuck to it firmly. J udge, then, of my surprise when in the midst of admiring the distant bills, clad in the mellow bright ness of the moonlight, I was startled by a gurgling cry of terror from below the window where I had planted McSweeny. I was; at the window and peering down in his direction in an inetant, and then I saw the miserable coward down on his knees, with his hat off and hie hair almost standing on end as he gazed with protruding eyes at the door of a scullery or wash-house built out from that end of the house. The door appeared to haveTjeen opened in some magic way — and some one, a man I. thought, just entered ; and while McSweeny 's stuttering 'O-oo-po-oh!5' fell on flle stall air, I was not a little, astonished to see the door gently ciosefrbm within, and then to hear it locked on the inside,... : , ,jj; . 'Somebody's coming,' I ioarsely whis-. pered, with considerable excitement, to my trembling companion; and! then as I looked . down once more;, McSweeny, freed, from the bonds of terror, sprang to bis feet, dashed from the .spot— over mailings and hedges with the agility of a ip.onkey-7-^uad vanished like a flash w ' And somebody 'a. gone/' I added, smiling, in spite of myself; at ^the frantic retreat.; '.. ,,:f. ..,...'. ** Don't faint, I heg of you,'' I saidhur riedlyj-as I saw .my companion press her hand on her. breast, and then .heard a moan of, pain or terror escape her lips.

' ; After the death of his master, be being ; olfl'Tand frail, had ^een pensioned oS by '? the widow before she left for London, and i had^rented a little house in Buccleuch street. It was now evident to me that in ; imagination he had gone back to his old : employment, and, being in possession of a j key to the back door, had visited the house ^ once a quarter, precisely as he had been : accustomed to do during bis master's life— ' with this difference, however, that he had upon the latter occasions been all the time wrapped in slumber, and under the impres sion tb!at he was only dreaming what was actually taking place. All tbis«ame4ioine like a flash, but I had no time to follow the thought out, for the . poof old man was sobbing and quivering in an hysterical fit, which I began to fear would never leave him; He had frightened us, but I am bound to say our fear was nothing to that which he himself now manifested, and the imploring and fearful glance up in my face was enough to banish the lightest words of enquiry from my lips. 'Oh, God! where am II?' he -gurgled; and at last, when, by the joint efforts of my companion and myself, he had been brought round, he cried, ' What did you bring me here for, and what lrave-I done ?' The questions were ' easier put than answered, so as to be intelligible to him, for his intellect at the best was rather clouded.; but- soothing him in the best way possible, we got' Mm -out of -the house, and soon after hailed a passing cab and had him conveyed safely te his home. After a week's illness, arising from the shock to his nerves caused by the sudden awakening by me,- the eccentric old clerk was able to. see me, and then I got a clue to his disjointed talk which had so ap palled the [remorse-stricken lady whom he had ' haunted.' Peter Me Arthur, the man whom she had wronged, it seemed had been the old clerk's friend from boyhood, and, not being able to pay for or employ a lawyer, on the case going against him he had repeatedly written through to his old friend describing, the case, and getting such advice as old John Lamont and his friendly master could [ supply. ' The old hag,' however, to whom i he had occasionally made allusion, I may say, was not Miss Glenroy, but an old cook j whoVhad been in Mr. Biggar's employ, and to whom the old clerk had borne a most un swerving hatred and antipathy. Thus the whole thing was effectually cleared up, and Miss Glenroy's mind set at ; rest; for the clerk's usefulness did not end wjth the explanation. He ferreted out with wonderful skill fhe daughter of the man she had wronged; 'Mstftution was made ; and, instead of being an old maid _ shunned for h«r' eccentricities — living in 'solitude and Btivfcd o'-Jlj lot. her money— jMiss Glenrpy became the head of the re-. covered family cf the poor widow ; and I thus I may set my ghost down as the least I mischievous and malicious that was ever ; written about. '. ; But was I satisfied? Most certainly not. The whole of this did not acconnt for the butdle of thievies' tools found in the house. I was so puzzled and determined to have I the story brought but my way that I reso lutely disputed every inch as the details were unveiled by the strange sleepwalker ; and even when the whole was. clearly established, I still doulrted. That the mystwy was not to remain long unsolved will be seen from the following sketch. I To be continued.) ? ? . -*? - ?'
