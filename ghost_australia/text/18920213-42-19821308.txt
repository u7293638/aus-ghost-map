DOGS AND GHOSTS. "Perhaps you are not aware," said a young man to the Charleston Democrat scribe, " that dogs and horses are as much afraid of ghosts and other uncanny of mysterious things as are the most timid of the human race. I proved it one time on two dog at at any rate. Not long after the war the negroes were so bad about our place in Kentucky that it was with difficulty we could keep our belongings on our place. Every other method having failed, I finally hit upon the plan of frightening them by appearing before them dressed as a ghost is said to habilitate itself. Of course the negroes were successfully frightened away from us, but upon one occasion I also frightened our two watch dogs as badly as any negro over was frightened by ghostly apparition. The dogs were fierce fellows, and would allow no stranger or strange thing on the place, but one moonlight night they came upon me in spectral attire. The dog that first caught a glimpse of me just humped up his back until all four of his feet covered not more than 6in. of Kentucky soil. His eyes stood out and his hair stood up, and he began moving backward, never for an instant taking his eyes of my figure. His companion came up, went through the same movement, and both began backing cautiously from me, and as long as I could see them they put distance between us in that way. A few moments later I heard them barking at home, half a mile distance. They had taken refuge under the house, and it was four days before we could coax them out again."
