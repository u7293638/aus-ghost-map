A WOMAN'S LETTER FROM LONDON. LONDON, May The season is at last with us, though the weather is cold enough for furs, and the row is only moderately full in the morning Yon will gather from this that east wind and chilly afternoons are not conducive to sitting out of doors Nothing is, or ever has been, so badly needed as a smart kind of winter garden where pretty toilettes could be worn, where tot and good music might be enjoyed at the same time People say this ideal pi ice may yet come , but in the seats of the mighty who control these things are conservative souls who find all the recreation they need in the sunny window of their club, or in to suggest some of their own libraries Any- where else the green slopes behind the Achilles statue would be alive with people disporting themselves in a house of glass Yet no one contemplates that this is to be much of a season The Princess of Wales is in mourn- ing and not likely to be much in London. The Princess backwards and forwards A theatre here, a small dinner or two, then to Newmarket, Sandringham, and at country homes It may rest with her Majesty, who is wonderfully set up by her winter at Nice, to give a zest to this part of the year Her 80th birthday draws nigh, and she will celebrate it by coming to London for the laying of the foundation of the new section of the South Kensington Museum The only lion in town is Mr Rhodes, and his roaring cannot last long, for he hurries back to Africa with much less fuss than most of us make over crossing the Channel The Academy is drawing full houses daily A poor show, though one is tempted to suggest that a biennial exhibition would be better than an annual one Painters would have more time to collect ideas or to travel, because it seems essential as time goes on and distances are annihilated that artists should I travel, as do authors, in search of now colour Then, of course, two other exhibi- tions, the Now and the International Galleries, rob the Academy of much of its old distinction People two of portraits it is a sign of the times that men can only afford to paint them, for money gets less and less plentiful for pictures when so much of it is laid out in other ways Lord Salisbury in his speech at the Academy banquet descanted on the paucity of material there for forming pictures of really artistic most out of the costumes in which the end of the century finds us, an Inferno haunted by women in bloomers Lady Warburton took the cap as utting her own head, and spoke up for feminine Ixious, making merry with the picture artists present of the Prime Minister, the Son of Many Ceoils " huddled in a great coat " Then the stage took up the cry against the divided skirt, upon which society seems to be in complete unison You must eat your lunch or drink your tea in the commercial room if you elect to wear the breaks on a cycling tour or else go unrefreshed In other words, " bloomers are off The New South Wales contingent of Lancers is at Aldershot, settled down to some hard work with the Cavalry Division We shall see them at the Military Tournament, when some pretty horsemanship will take place As an old Australian I love nothing so well as that firm seat and absolute assurance in the saddle the Australian horseman shows This will bring the men to London, and recall to us something of 1897, that memorable year when the Empire paraded before the Queen to celebrate her sixty years' reign Tiny j par the aim of the tournament is to show something of the difficulties that beset our over victorious army in bush fighting All the military centres are rehearsing, and Clarkson is as busy if he were getting costumes ready for the Christmas pantomime 1 am told Tommy Atkins will not make up his neck, so tights to match as nearly as possible the colouring of each duBl y warrior are being made from drawings supplied by different artists Greater Britain opens on Monday, at Earl's Court One may fairly say the summer has begun, but who can feel rapture at sitting under the stars with a north east breeze blowing and until we get warmer weather both Greater Britain and the Imperial Institute will languish for want of patronage The show of Africans already ex cites curiosity A perfect colony of them are camped at Earl's Court, with an admiring crowd of boys who are proud to do the smallest service for their brethren from over the sea I have been the round of the new pieces at the theatres, and begin by " Robespierre," which, in importance, dwarfs everything, especially those productions concerned with Trench historical plays Sir Henry Irving looks so well, plays with vigour, and yet with such dignity and restraint, that one hopes he has many more successes to make There is no doubt the carts of management were him down He looked preoccupied, pale, and had lost some of the nuances of his art Best and the attendant nurs- ing going into dock as it were have restored him and with the Lyceum managed on other lines no doubt much of the anxiety with h brought about the illness has been lifted from him His reception was immense He is so modest, so graceful, so full of love for his public, so considerate to old friends, that no one saw the house rise at him, as he entered down a lonely glade with his arms full of flowers, without a moistened eye and tightness of throat Playing that night was at a discount. Emotion reigned on both sides of the curtain It is a superb production St real that is I left the theatre the truth of the Stroud seemed to be all tumbrils The Ghosts of Robes- pierre victims were the erly managed , the crowds splendidly acted But of all the acts I like best Act III , where Robespierre was in his own room-a quiet scene, most tenderly played It is the fault of Sir Henry's temperament that one does not quite give the character its full fury of dislike All men who live before the world have to pay the penalty of popular success by private unrest and many moments of depression Sardou makes Robespierre crave for sleep and for some human touch of love The pillows of great men are full of whispers After the Lyceum-a long way of tor-" Carnac Sahib " picturesque, erring on the side of cleanliness, considering it portrays India, but a poor play, not worth criticism, except that the small parts are so well played by Mr Tree's company a company so good one grudges them wasting energies and time on tawdry melodrama Lewis Waller suit ed consistently right through He hates his part Mrs Brown-Potter puts on a French accent, and plays an Englishwoman in India as if she were a Cocotte of the Boulevards Everybody is inquiring, " What's happened to Jones of At the St. James's Mr George Alexander has a virile production, " In the Days of Old " There are many retailers, drawbridges rattle up and down, armour is burnished, and swords are forged, and romance of the York and Lancaster period is portrayed Mr Alexander wears costume with a gallant air, but the play is difficult to follow, and the wearing of the roses is not clearly enough defined The partisans changes from red to white, and from white to red, as quickly as a Radical " rats " through the shades of Liberalism to ultra Conservatism Given a chance, London would be blossoming in beautifully dressed women Lace conto, lace peplums, Soft stuffs, over tightly fitting skirts I never saw so much lace, and the effect is charmingly soft and graceful It is reported that Paris is weary of double skirts, and that the plain well-cut skirt is again the mode Few women of arry the double to act well, and the extreme tightness affected bore is by degrees sounding its own death knell Worth's costumes look positively full after what we have seen here The hats are really beautiful. The flow ors never so beautiful one huge rose in a rest of tulle and straw trimming and they are turned up behind because the hair is dressed high again, waved and very elaborate Indeed, "elaboration" is the most de jour in any thing concerning the apparel- ing of our womankind
