SKETCHES PROM QUEENSLAND.

I had to pass tnrough a dense scrub of beautiful shrubs and trees, with a wonderful variety of foliage, but the underwood and vines of all kinds, made it almost impenetrable, nnd many a tumble I had over these vines, for they were so remarkably flne and yet so strong, that to attempt to ignore them made it troublesome work. As for ganie, there were a fewscrub tnrkey.but uu.get-r.t-ablc. On the sides of the hills and open grouud, quail abounded in thousands ; a tine large grey bird, so numerous and so tame, that one could have knocked three or four over with sticka and stones at pleasure ; I did not exert myself however or waste any ammuni tion, . retaining my powder and energy for a possible hostile reception on the part of something ; for though an aboriginal was never, known to have ventured out so far, yet in wandering about in an. out of , the way sort of ptaco liko this by oneself , there is a kind, of uncertainty nnd an undeflneable sort of feeling, like playing with an unloaded gun— there is no saying when it might gooff. However, I wandered on in .uninterrupted solitude and followed a little valley intersect ing the island for about a quarter of a mile when1 1 came into another scrub, and ,J after scrambling about for, some time, suddenly emerged onto a crescent- shaped, fairy-like beach, snowy-white- nnd -smooth, about 60 yards long and flanked at each end by huge cliffs, .'up one of whichi'afteria spell- and smoke,: I clambored, iand onto -.the summit 6f-''-,1he' 'peak/ whence1 I had' an /ex tensive and rather a grand view.J'iAway to the east the great Barrier Reef was jnst visible ; 'to: the -west' . the much ; broken coasttline of thoimainland^iand ; nenren hand abird's-eyo .viewJofi thewholeiisland- -While sitting;dbiYn-and:;admiring-: the. ; view, 11 and thinking how 1 remarkably qnioti And! still everything was, i my ; reverie -was 1. rather startlingly'br'6ken in upon' by an ominous boo-boo-booing from a large ithiok.. :bush; :in the immediate vicinity, the only one for-half '? amile round; andright on: the isummit,: then ! iv tremendous rustling landcscrambling.:; A| gorilla,'by jingo !.':was; my I iinsfanf -.tliought i nnd oxclnmation;.but on nearer.'app'roach. out flew a largei&wamp; pheasant,:but-jit.carhe so : ,close,'.jand.' with! sneh'a; stUnningeffect-J hadn't the least' ideaihow to,ishoobiit.'i The top of the peak i8about!900ifept,above:;tho sea,' from iwhichiclbseiinishorejcpuldibs. seen numerous 'coral -banks,iand,; what .(was; more '- to the purpose, .1 saw i about tn dozen- .-. turtle I crawling' about in the;8hallowi,w.iter,;.ev:en at ihe'ihcight'Ifwasaboye them; and of which 1 .several-got into our clutches during the: even ing; f I returned to the boat; and/in. ,thciaftec noon we tried fishing, but thebait being. bad j ?were^insuccessf ul.Thewateris so.-wonderf ully ; . olear here that. with lOfathoms^ofchainione could see the ancbocas plainly as possible, also our;sinkers and baits. : During.the afternoon om forces werei»ngmented bythe arrival of twoiflshermen fromiBowen, in .ai cockle-shell of a: boat,, and for whprai o,ur. skipper .1 pro- j dieted a' 'watery grave 'some..o£ -thtse days] foriventuring to seairi, such a.'.thingO'.- They,! had come-to ? spend': their.
