"I confess it all," Mrs Vavasor be gan ; "I don't know how you have found it out, but it is true, every word. I did change -the children. I halted the Coun- tess of Ruysland; but for her I should have been Lionel Cardonnell's wife. I married John Hia.rma.Ti, but I despised him. Poor, weak fool, I was glad when he died. She gave me money, she gave me presents, and I took them all, and hated her more every day. She wasn't happy with her husband — -that wiaa some comfort. She was jealous— she had a furious temper. Kaitherme inherited It, you may remember." She shivered as she pronounced the home. "My baby waa a month old the nlglit she ran away from the earl In a fit of fury and came to me. Th-ait night her baity was born — a girl, too. Next morn ing she was dead. She died in my arms, in mv nnnr cottage. without husband or friend near her. That would have satis fied most women — it didn't satisfy me. They came and took her away. The earl told me to keep and nurse the child— who so fit as I? 1 don't believe he ever looked nt il. He didn't care much for his wife, but the manner of her death was a shock and a scandal. They buried her, and he v flit away. "I went to live in a village some thirty miles away. I took no especial care of either of them, but they grew and thrived In spite of that. My daughter had brown eyes and flaxen hair, and was small and delicate- looking — much the prettier of the two. The earl's daughter had grey eyes and brown hair, and was large for a child of two years. She hod her mother's temper and her mother's will; mine was one of the gentlest crea tures that ever was born. I called the earl's daughter .Katherine', I called mine Cecil, as Lord Ruysland had desired ills daughter to be named. I was well paid, but I grew tried to death of taking care of them and vegetating in a stupid vil lage. I wrote to Lord Ruysland to come for his child. "He came, and I gave him mine. I did not let him see the other at all. I told him my little girl was ailing, and he took the other away totally unsuspecting. Then I sold off everything and went to Prance, taking little Kathie with me. Tim /oral 1 Li /-« T r r> n Kidlu Itlirt -A-tlA. CUdlOlUII LIL IT IliLii X WOD UAtnj fc followed; the child escaped.

He offered to adopt little Kathie in her stead, and I closed with the offer at once. I never saw her again until, under the name of Mrs Vava sor, I came to Scarswood Park, and met her as Sir John's heiress. "I solemnly swear that the young girl who was known as Katherlne Danger- field was, in reality, the Lady Cecil Olive, only child of the Earl and Countess of Ruysland. The person who now bears that title is my daughter, christened Katherine Harman. I will swear this In' any court of law. I changed them out of revenge upon the late Lady Ruys land. (Signed) "HARRIET HARMAN." The wretched woman wrote her name; old Hannah and Henry Otis affixed theirs as witnesses. He folded up the docu ment, superscribed ft "Confession of Harriet Harman," and placed it In his breast pocket. She sat watching every motion with terrified eyes. "What are you going to do with it?" she asked, eagerly. "I am going to place it In the hands of Lord Ruysland between this and to-mor row night. The rank and name your daughter has usurped for two-and- twenty years shall he taken from her be fore the expiration of four-and-twemy nours "It was no fault of hers," the guilty i woman said, with trembling lips. She started to her feet and caught him as he wa sturning away. '.'Take me away from this horrible house; — now, at once. Do anything you as he was turning away. I Not to-night," he answered coldly. It is impossible. You would make your escape, and that I can't allow. Six I years ago you had your day — this is i mine.

In five minutes old Hannah was up and dressed, and in the room of her young mistress. Katherine (let uscallherby Lheoldname) had sprung from her bed also as that authoritative knock resounded through the house. "It must be Henry Otis— it can be no one else at this hour. Go, open the door, Hannah, and let them in, whoever they may be." Hannah went. She Hung open the door, and stood confronted by a tall man, with a dark, handsome, stern-look- lng face, and an unmistakably military air. "I wish to see Miss Herncastle," tills gentleman began, with perfect abrupt- »R.oO| A ivuu\% llldL is 1 It: lis IltriU, "Who are you, sir?" old Hannah de manded, with equal sternness; "and by what right do you come at such a time of morning as this, routing decent folks out of their beds?" "My name is O'Donnell. T am Miss Herncastle's friend, and I have come to do her a service; while there is yet time. Before two hours it may be too late. Give her this, I entreat you, and tell her I must see her." "Yes, Hannah, give it to me. I'm not afraid of Caprain O'Donnell. Let me see what he has to say." It was Katherine herself — in slippers and dressing gown — her brown hair un done, rippling in the old girlish way over her shoulders. In that white negligee, with hair unbound, and its natural col or, she looked, with the rose-fiush of lite August sunrise upon her, younger, fair er, fresher, than he had ever seen her before. She took no notice of him. She took the card from Hannah gravely — and gravely examined it. Beneath his name In pencil was written — "I know that you are here. I come as your friend. If you have any regard for yourself you will see me at once." She looked up and held out her hand to 111 III, VV 1 L 11 a, SIIIJUZ tl Silllllt? Lllill. HfctU something of the old brightness, the old saucy defiance of Katherine Dangerfield. "Good morning, Captain O'Donnell. My friends are so few and far between at present, that it would be a thousand pities to refuse an audience io one of them. But you my friend '. Isn't that rather a new role for the gallant caprain of chasseurs?" She led the way into the bare looking apartment, where last night Harriet Harman had made her confession, and pointed to a chair. There was a grace, a triumph about her he had never seen before — the whole expression of her face waa changed. Where was the 6ad, sombre face of Miss Herncastle now? A sort of proud triumph lit all the face be fore him. He accepted the chair only to lean across its wooden back and look at her. She slood where the golden sunshine fell fullest upon her — her tall form looking taller and more classic than ever in her trailing white robe, a crimson cord for her girdle. The brown hair was swept off forehead and temples, showing the scar on the left plainly, and adding to the nobility of liar face. The black had been washed from the eyebrows — alto gether she was changed almost out of knowledge. "Will Captain O'Donnell — my friend — who has "hunted me down from first to last — speak? What is it'that has taken you out of your bed at this uncivilised hour and brought you to Bracken Hol low and me?" The ringing tone of he)- voice, the meaning sparkle of her eye and smile confounded him. "To warn you for the last lime." "For the last time— to warn me of what?" "That all is known— all." "What does all comprise? May J ask you to explain?" "That the death and burial of Kath erine Dangerfield was a fraud, and Miss Herncastle and Katherine Dangerfield are one and the same. I am acting on no suspicion — I rarely act on that. I am acting on certainty. I knew the grave in Castleford churchyard to be a fraud —the tombstone lying even more than tombstones usually lie. I knew that grave held an empty coffin." "May I ask how?" "In the simplest manner possible. I employed a man accustomed to such dreadful work, and opened the grave. We raised the coffin, opened that, and found, as I told you nothing. She sat and looked at him— wonder not unmixed with a species of amusement and admiration, in her face. ; Captain O'Donnell, you are an extraor dinary man." "No; I don't see il," he answered coolly. "It wasn't anything very ex traordinary. From the hour I discover ed your identity with the New York ac tress my suspicions were aroused. You had never given up the stage and buried yourself alive at Scarswood in. the capa city of governess without some powerful latent motive. That motive, I confess, I fel: curious .to discover. Then you made love to Sir Arthur Tregenna — I beg your pard-on, permitted him to fall in love with you." Katherine smiled once more. "As Sir Arthur had long before been signed, sealed, and delivered over to Lady Cecil Clive, and he seemed powerless to help liimself, I felt called upon to help him. He is my friend, you know, sd also is his affianced wife. Then you played ghost — oh, yes, you did — and frightened Sir Peter to the verge of in sanity. Altogether you were too dan- grous a sort of person to be allowed to go on without a short pull up from some one." Again his listener smiled as she recall ed Sir Peter's ghastly face of fright. "Captain O'Donnell, I cannot under stand why you should take the trouble to come here and say this. Why shouid you endeavor Lo save a woman you hold in aversion and contempt — a woman, in short, whom you hate?" "Whom I hate!" he repeated, quietly. "Since when have I told you I hated you?

I believe a great and generous nature has been warped. Katherine Dangerfield, I pity you — from my soul I do — and with my whole heart I stand before you, your friend. It is not too late yet ; pause, while there Is yet time, on the road you are treading, and go back." There was no mistaking his earnest ness, the generous glow of Ills face, the friendly warmth of his tone. She had turned away from him and was looking out at the golden morning sky. "Go back!" she repeated, bitterly. "Is there ever any going back in this world? Six years ago 1 might have'listened ; to day it is too late." She covered her face with her hands, her breast heaving, the color burning in her face, moved to the very depth of her soul with a passion of which he did not dream. "Come, Katherine — you have fought long and well, and nothing lias come of it. Give it up, and for ever." Her hands dropped from her face; some thing in the last words seemed to rouse her. She looked at him steadily. "And nothing has come of it?" she re peated. "That is your mistake, Captain O'Donnell. Something lias come of " it. I — what?" " "Tell me, and see." "I confess," she went on, "to all laid to my charge. I am Katherine Danger- field; I have been burled and risou from the dead, and with that resurrection my nature seemed to change. I have brood ed on one subject — my wrongs — until I believe my brain has turned. I fied from the house of my tiaze and loyal friend, Henry Otis, and went to America. 1 be came the New York actress you so clev erly recognised. From Nejv York I wrote to Mr Otis. I told him if Gaston Dan tree died to bury him decently — if he lived, lo furnish him with money to quit England. Unhappily he died, but not for more than a year after receiving his injuries. All those years I remained in New York I worked hard in my profes sion, and rose. I made money, and I hoarded it like a miser. Day and night, stronger and stronger with each year, grew the determination to return, to keep my vow. I tell you I believe there were times when I was insane on this subject. Death alone could have held me back. I waited patiently, while burning with impatience; I worked, I hoarded, and at last my day came. I returned to Eng land; I made my way into Llie family of Sir Peter Dangerfield; my revenge had begun. "I had a double motive in returning— one, my vengeance on him; the other, to discover my parentage. i nau a ciu e, and, strange to say, in working out one, I was working out the other. You know what followed — I played ghost, and terri fied the master of Scarswood, as I think he was never terrified before. I owe you no grudge; you were doing your duty, and i honor you for it. For fiir Arthur, you need not have been so much afraid; it was a triumph to take him from Lady Cecil— to anger Lady Danger- field; but. bad as I am, I don't think I ever was base enough to marry him, even if lie had asked me. He had never wronged me, and I only waged war with those who did." "You waged war with Lady Cecil Clive in taking her lover from her, and she certainly never wronged you. She was your friend through all." The hard look came over her face once more, a hard light in her eyes. "Was she ? In your eyes, of course, Lady Cecil can do no evil. But what if 1 told you she had done me the deepest, the deadliest wrong of all!" He looked at her in surprise. "I don't understand," he said, a little coldly. "I believe Lady Cecil to be in capable of wilfully wronging anyone, and she always spoke gently of you." Ehe leaned her forehead on her hands, and pushed back her hHir with a long, tired sigh. "Oh, Jleaven,- 1 want to do right- -My JUIgSpis feel as though I were steeped In crime to the Lips. If I could only die and end it all! But death passes the guilty, and miserable by, and takes the happy and the good." Her folded arms were lying on the table; her head fell forward on them, as though she never cared to lift it again. O'Donnell took both her hands in his, a compassion such as he had never felt for any human being before stirring his heart. "What am I that I should judge ? There is nothing but pity for you in' my heart — nothing. Give up this dark and dangerous life, and be true to yourself — to the noble nature Heaven has given you — once more." She rose up, her hands still in his, a sort of inspiration shining in her face. "I will," she answered. "You, whom I thought my enemy, shall save me. I renounce it — the plotting — the evil — the revenge — and for your sake, for the love you bear her, I wall spare her." He looked at her in mute inquiry. She entiled, drew away Iter hands, and re sumed lier seat. "You do not understand. See here, Captain O'Donnell: I told you, did 1 not, my second object in returning to Eng land was to discover my parentage? Well, I have discovered it." "You have?" he cried, breathlessly. "I have discovered it. My father lives, and the daughter of my nurse occupies my place in his heart, the name I should .bear. It's a very old story — changed at nurse — and that nurse has confessed all." : "You have done this? Then I con- gratulate you, indeed! You will go to your father at once, of course? No one, believe me, can rejoice at this more sin cerely than I." "You mistake— I shall never go! This morning I had intended — but that is ail past now. If I renounce my revenge and wrong-doing in one way, I renounce it in all. I never understood half mea sures." "But there is no wrong-doing here— it is right, it is your duty to go." She smiled. "t wonder If this would be your advice if — if, for example only — my father were the Earl of Ruysland. I name him, you understand, as the first I think of." "I should tell you still to go. Right is right. Though the Ear! of Ruysland were your fallic-r, though Lady Cecil had usurped your place, I should still say, go — tell the truth, be the cost what it may." "You, who love Lady Cecil, give me this advice? Captain O'Donnell, you don't love her." "I love liet so well that 1 leave lier; I love her so well that if the thing you speak of were possible, I would be the first to go and tell lier. Once again — in the face of all that may follow — I re peat, go! Tell the truth, take the place and name that ire yours, and let me help you if I can." But still she sat, keeping that strange, wistful, searching gaze on his face. "You love her so well that you leave her," she repeated, dreamily. Thc-n she cros-sed the room without a woi'd, lit a candle, and placed it oil the table be fore him. He watched her in silent sur prise. She drew from her pocket a folded paper, and handed it to him. "You have done greater service than you dream of in coming here," she said. "Do one last favor. I want this paper destroyed. I have a whimsical fancy Lo see you do it. Hold it to the candle and let it burn." He took it doubtfully. He read the superscription — "Confession of HarrieL Harman," and hesitated. "I don't know — why should 1? Why is this ?" "Nothing tliat concerns any one on earth out myself. You will be doing -a good deed, I believe, in destroying It. Let me see you burn it. I can do it, of course; but, us 1 said. T have a fancy that yours should be the hand to destroy it. Burn it, Captain O'Donnell." Still wondering — still doubting — he obeyed: held flic- paper in the flame of the candle until it dropped in a chaired cloud on the table. Then she held out her hand to him with :i bravo, bright smile. "Once more I thank you. You have done me a great service. You have saved me from myself. When do you leave?" "rrcs if. T pud fiirl vrm in -inv way— if I can take you to. your father "You are ready to do it, I know; but I have not qullo made up my mind about that yet. It is not a thing to be done in ?. hurry. Let us say good-bye, and part for the present." He stood and looked at lier doubtfully. He felt vaguely that never had lie been farther from understanding her than at this moment. "Farewell, Captain O'Donnell, my friend," she said, softly. There was a lingering lendcrness in Iter voice, in her eyes, that might have told him her secret. But men are totally blind sometimes. He saw nothing;. "Not farewell," ho said; "but au re voir." She went with hjm to the door. She watched htm with wistful eyes out of sight. "Farewell," she murmured— "farewell for ever. If Henry Otis had been to me six years ago what you are I had been saved." When Captain O'Donnell had left Bracken Hollow, she took pen and paper and wrote the following note to Mr Otis, which subsequently Hannah was In structed to give lo that gentleman when he came oyer from Castleford : "Henry — my Brother,— You will be stliiirised -pained, angered, It may be— fefcc o|ng. — — — — " " . ft plotting, tlie weary, wicked, endless- scheming that brought revenge, per- haps, but never happiness— and the con-, i ft-ssiou is burned !
