The recent meetings of tbe Austral asian Association for tbe Advancement of Hknenoe, held in Melbourne, eppeor in many respects to have bebQ an. un- qualified success. Not only were tlie proceedings conducted witb.-A . large' amount of earnestness end enthusiasm, but many of the papers read were of a character that will Tender them highly valuable as records /or , future reference. When the volume of 'pro ceedings is published this year it mil no doubt-have a very large 'circulation,, and thus the experiences oV exipbtts in .many branches of science, and bearing upon subjects that affect our daily welfare, physically, socially, and morally, will be brought within the reach of thousands who have been unable from various 'causes to attend the meetings at which they were recorded. That the meetings of such an Association as^tbe Australasian Association for the Ad vancement of Science must be produc tive of good 16 beyond doubti and in voting liberal sums to assist the objects of the Association the New South Wales and Victorian Governments have, set an example thfet must not -be over^ looked when provision is being made for the meeting to be held in Tasmania in the year 1892. The means of popularising science in the present ^ay are veiy great, and the masses are now receiving through the medium of the Press, and by such chancels as the Australasian Association, a knowledge of scientific subjects the attainment of which would have been impossible a few years ago. This is a matter for congratulation, inasmuch aa such know ledge tends to elevate the mind, to im prove the social and moral condition of the people, and to bring the masses, through a knowledge of Nature's laws, to a larger and clearer recognition of a Power that lies behind all Law, and that sustains all things from' the protoplasmic germ of life to the publime and universal ' Whole — tbe ' All-sustainer' of Goethe. The soope of the Association was clearlv set forth by the President for the year, Baron Von Mueller, in his openiug address at the Town Hall, Melbourne, on the 7th inst. ' The destination of this institution,' he said, 'is a far wider one than may be supposed gene rally by our fellow-colonists. . . . Though we cannot expect every member, porhaps according to some European standard, to bo engaged actively iu pursuits of discovery witli a strict scientific bearing, ] feel uure 1 express the feelings of all whom pro fessional positions or amateur inclina-^ tions bring together on the path of knowledpe, when I affirm that the Association joyously and gratefully welcomes whomsoever will cheer us in our aspirations, will listen to our dis cussions, and will support us by that moral influence which every educated and thoughtful layman can bring po bear.' Referring more particularly to* the direct objects of the Association, the Baron went on to say : — ' We accept on Australian soil this move ment ... in all its bearings, hopes, and responsibilities, with perhaps thia .one- preference, that, while endeavor to follow the . cosmopolitan course as adopted in the northern world, we would cherish some predilec tion for maintaining a command over the fields of indigenous work in these far southern regions, without, how ever, any wish of monopoly. . Irrespective .of carrying on original research, worthy of a country fef i 1 juvenile freshness, 'it is our duty inore' . especially to instil the flow of iufonna- - tion from so manifold sources near, us,' in such a manner that new growth for further developments may arise in all possible directions. . '^lucV human faculty is always going to waste. Let this Association, in its popularity, collect all stray forces — especially as here, on new grounds, tbe very novelty of research must stimulate to more ardent action Umdjkfeoerl emulation.

Curing his remarks, Mr Snazelle said fa is aim was to 'produce 'a- cultured rent«rtaiD ment, and he has certainly admirably suc ceeded in doing so. He evidently has a mortal hatred of the genus ' larrikin, ' and we regret be has in hie Launceston audi ences had same specimens of the unwel come class. Mr Snazelle's rendition, on Saturday night, of ' The Whistler 1 met in Switzerland ' was, to the great annoyance of himself And the house 'marred by some frilly fellow who attempted !to Jjx a whistle of his own. Railway .Slbbpsbs.— Major Tottenham 1 kindly supplies the following extract of a letter received from a firm in Calcutta:— ' Referring to your enquiry regarding rail way sleepers, we beg to state that the sizes most in use this Bide of India are — Metre euage, 6ft by 8in by 4in ; broad guage, 10ft by iOin -by din. ^Che cross-section muet by rectangular. The timber most be sound, well-grown, and seasoned ; free from large knbts, ring ' fehakes, splits, rot, or other; imperfections that would render the sleepers unfit for the purposes required, and should be cut so as to avoid the' material defects of the heart of the trees. *' . . . . Broad guage sleepers are, however, deliverable in Calcutta, and five rupees 'each is paid for them. There is a market here for good hard wood for building purposes. Teak is cbiefiy used, It would, however, be necessary for you to send specimens before we could answer your questions as to «cantlingB, lengths, etc. The Arm says that ! the metre gusge sleepers would probably not pay, owing to expense of carriage by rail— 121 miles — and then by ferry. The building timber would have to ba as well , seasoned, etc., as that for broad guage sleepers. Whether freight from Hobart and Launceston or other Tasmanian port direct could be got cheap enough would be worth enquiry on the part of eaw millers. 1 publish the information, such as it is, in the hope that it may be of use to those con cerned. Itwill be useless, however.to Bend any but thoroughly seasoned stuff, for the heat would destroy jt before arrival even. Lawbbncb Valk Band of- Uopb.— The usual monthly moeting of the above Band of Hope was held ou Friday evening last, when the cliurcb was erowded to exw. In the absence of the Rev, W.

Hill, which were received with deserved applause; also recitations of a first^clase character by Mr6 Craib, Master Lloyd, ttessrs. R. and J. Jacobson, A. Symonds, Vf*. Tyson, and W. Sayer ; also a novelty in the shape of a mouth organ selection by Mr Reuben Mace, which wascapitallyrendered, and - received an enthusiastic encore. Several hymns were eung by the audience, led by a select choir composed of town friends. Miss Holland presided at tbe organ in her well known efficient style. A hearty vote-of .thanks was accorded to the chairman, organist, and.to all who had taken part in the meeting. After a very pleasant «od profitable evening had been spent, the meeting,, which was a decided success, closed with the Benediction.

Jtyrpp DftpyTOBD.— The few people who were pongregated on the Catacadc Bridge and in vite vicinity 'about 10 30 ra-OU oh Saturday were surprised by seeing the body of a man floating down the Cataract from the direction of tbe falls towards the bridge. Mr Charles Waters, who was the first to notice the corpse, gave immediate information torthe p&lice; station', and Con stables Campbell and Mansou were de spatched to recover it and convey it to the morgue. Although the body was after wards identified as that of Thos. Harrison, a well-known resident of Eardley-street, and aged about 75 years, the case, like the majority of others, is surrounded by a mystery which cannot be solved. Tbe deceased was a man of eccentric habits, and . often wandered aimlessly about; - knowing - - apparently little of what he did, and, caring less. Later on in the day an inquest was held at the River View Hotel, Charles-street, before Mr £- Whitfeld, obroner, when the evidence was taken of the men who first saw and re covered tbe body, together with that of Mrs Harrison, who identified it as that of her husband, and testified to bis strange habits ; and also (Jutt of 2)r.- U G. Thompson, who Haid that deceased met his d^atii bv drownipg, end that there were no marks of violence about the body, after which the jury returned a verdict of 'Death by drowning, but that Lhure was no evidence to show how deceased got into the water.? j Salvation Abmt — Several farewell ! services were hell at the Salvation' Army Barracks yesterday, when Staff -Captain and Mrs Bennett gave farewell addresses. There were 'large attendances at each of the services, and much regret was expressed by tbe several officers and soldiers at the pro jected departure of the Staff-Captain and nis esteemed wife. ^ Excubsion Tbain.— The picnic train to Denison Gorge, Lebrina, and Golconda, which runs every Saturday, weather per mitting, is not diminishing in popularity ; 'but, ou tbe contrary, greater difficulty is weekly experienced by the railway officials in , finding sitting accommodation for'the numbers of persons anxious' to escape the city heat and dust and revel in the sylvan glades -of ..these picturesque spots. On Saturday last large numbers left town for these reports, and after inhaling, the fresh air of ' the country returned, teeling con eiderably recuperated by Lhe outing. 1 Cabmkn Rkwabb I— From the notice of the town clerk, which appears in our advertising columns, cabmen are warned I not to inegiect - licencing their cabs to-day or stand the chance of beingproseouted if foand plying unlicensed.

CABTBjL^-Oor North-West Coast repre sentative writes:— The anniversary services in connection with the Wesleyan Church were held on Sunday, when sermons were preached afternoon and evening by Rev. J. May to large congregations. The prises were distributed -in the afternoon, the 'Weather was most oppressive, no doubts ^ preventing larger gatherings. On Wednes , day the usual tea meeting was held in the , church, for which tbe building bad been tastefully decorated with ferns, evergreens, and flowers. Two tables, the entire length : f3t the building, were laden with all the 'substantia Is and delicacies which only the Qadies of oar farming communities know how to .provide. There was a very good attendance, and the afternoon was spent in singing by the .choir, with Mrs Robertson as organist, and games amongst the young folks. As waitresses at the tables the Misses M'Pherson (2), Dolbell (2), Lewis, Gould, Lamont, and Stucaatar performed their duties cheerfully and well ; a«d to the liberality of Mesdames Joe Win.
