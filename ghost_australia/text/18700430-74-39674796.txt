THE CHINESE CUSTOM OF RE- MOVING THE DEAD. The Cannonbar correspondent of the Dubbo Dispatclh relates that about three years ago a Chinaman, shepherding on the Bogan, cut his throat, having taken the precaution to stow away a good meal first. It was a nasty, cold, wet morning in May, when Se-ma- Cronang (or whatever his name was) turned over his swag, destroyed some valuable papers, examined his razor, polished off a hearty breakfast, and walked in from the kitchen to the house, thinking, I have no doubt, that it would be a greater honor to perform this feat (which one so seldom sees done) before the master instead of the cook. The celestial remarked that "he was werry cold," and was told to go into the kitchen and warm himself. He replied, "I'll show you," and pulling out a razor, which owing to the darkness of the room looked like a piece of black tape, turned coolly round, com- pressed his lips, and made a long incision, severing the carotid artery, and which failing continued hacking away. Se-ma-Cronang's spirit had fled before the body had touched the ground - merely a slight quiver of the lips. John had "thanked the world." Three hours afterwards he was buried. Since then his perturbed spirit has been seen twice, making night hideous, but only seen by one who believes in ghosts. However, it appears that his bones were not to rest in that spot. A month ago four Chinamen called, borrowed a spade, dug up the remains of poor John, drank brandy, burnt lights round the grave to appease the soul, laid the bones most care- fully on a clean cloth, and started for China, not wishing to leave the remains of one who had sacrificed himself to some great idol in a Christian country.
