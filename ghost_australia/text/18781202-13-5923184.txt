" THE THEATRES. THEATRE ROYAL. THE LANCASHIRE LASS. Mr H J Byron's drama of "The Lancashire Lass, which has many times been played in Melbourne during the last 10 years, was reproduced on Saturday night at the Theatre Royal to a very good house It is one of those domestic dramas which hold their place upon the stage, for the good reason that they are constructed with an eye to cumulative effect, all the situations being interdependent Although some of the characters are slightly overdrawn, there is no marked violation of probability in them, and there is plenty of contrast, both in the characters and in the several passages, those which are comic being placed in striking relief with those that are tragically coloured Its present revival is not distinguished by any special preparation in the way of scenery, which, although for the most part fairly enough appropriate, is not uniformly so the concluding scene in the first act, indeed being almost absurdly inexpressive For the most part the piece was very well played, Mr Greville s Party by the Name of Johnson engaging by far the largest share of attention, as it has done on all previous occasions when he has appeared in it Indeed Mr de valle may be said to have made this character quite his own, so far as Melbourne is concerned, and it would be almost lash venture for any one else to appear in it in this case, for it is one of the very few parts played by Mr Greville in which he has an opportunity of showing that, when the occasion needs, he can express pathos with quite as telling an effect as humour In the interview with Geoffrey Danville, where Johnson describes the suffering and death of the woman he had loved and whom Danville had ruined, the real tenderness of Mr Grey like stone and manner could not well be exceeded It de monstrates that Mr Greville, besides being a most amusing low comedian, can be some thing else when the character and the situation require it Miss Navaro as Ruth Kirby played with true feeling and unforced earnest- ness, and very skilfully depicted the transition process from the flattered vanity of a country girl to the strong constancy of the sorrow tried woman Mr Appleton did all proper justice to the work of developing the principal villany of the piece, and Mr Vincent was moderately successful in the opposite process of develop- ing the leading virtue Mr Taylors Spotty, if not quite so amusing as we have seen it when otherwise cast, was marked by care, intelligence, and the absence of any disposition to burlesque Miss Carrington was quite out of her element as Kate Garstone, and Miss Melrose was hardly well placed as a typical fashionable heiress Mr Stuart O'Brien was exactly suited with the character of Mr Mellick, and Mr C esar did his work well as the enthusiastic policeman the bills announced that the gentleman who played Mr Milder, the lawyers clerk, appeared for the first time Under the circumstances he got on very well, but surely he could have invented a less puerile nom de theatre than that of O'Brien spelt back wards _ THE PRINCESSS THE A THE THE FREE CHRISTMAS NIGHTS On Saturday night a sensational drama, "The Three Christmas Night. or, the Murder at the Old Mill, was produced for the first time in Melbourne at this theatre The play consists, as the title suggests, of the events of three Christmas nights On the first a terrible murder is committed, and an innocent man, the village blacksmith who is on the eve of marriage with a woman he had seduced some time previously-is accused and, chiefly on the evidence of his in tended wife, convicted of the crime Escaping from prison he, four years afterwards, returns to his old home, to find his unfortunate victim mad, but Bane enough to recognise him through all changes On the same night, one of the real murderers is at the village inn The maniac has tracked him She enters a room resolved to strangle him and finds, instead, her former lover Thinking she sees a ghost she rushes away, to be followed by theblacksmith.and, in the mean time, the real murderer is put to death by one of his former confederates Toby Darwen, who escapes, and the unfortunate blacksmith is a second time falsely accused Twelve cars afterwards he again returns having by good I conduct earned a conditional pardon Aus I tralia has yielded him untold wealth , nuggets and bank notes innumerable hang round his neck in a canvas bag These he exhibits to an admiring crowd He is suddenly startled by what he thinks the ghost of his old love It proves to be his daughter, and he is rejoicing in the prospect of some one to love and to receive his wealth, when a third time he is accused of murder Luckily his daughter is able to save him and after so many perils he dies at peace with ex er) one The real murderer confesses his crime, and establishes the blacksmith's mine cence Mr Carey, as Jack Baw try, the hero of the piece, acquitted himself most creditably) The inconsistencies in the part were not of his making The author opens his drama by disclosing the blacksmith at work on Christmas night, and by the remonstrance of his friend, Timothy Entwistle (Mr Cottier) it is manifested that Bavvtry is working to give relief to one in distress By his succeeding speech he appears a model of all the cardinal virtues He goes on a kindly message to the village, returning just in time to save Lizzie Lee (Mrs Tav arose) from the coarse attentions of the arch villain of the pla), Tom Hejwood (Mr Metcalfe), and his spirited interference loses much of its charm when we find that Lizzie has been his victim, and that she finds it necessary to remind him of his promise to make an honest woman of her Heywood, feigning regret for his insolence to Life, asks Bavvtry to drink with him, and the old story follows-his drink is drugged, Heywood, with Toby (Mr Poole) and Black Norris (Mr I Forde), has agreed to murder and rob old farmer Aldmgson Black Norris changes coats with the stupefied Bavvtry The farmer in struggling tears a button from his murderers coat This, with Lies evidence, is enough Mr Metcalfe through out was so quiet in his demeanour that it was hard to believe that he represented so thorough a scoundrel Mr Carey was frequently applauded He had evidently carefully studied his part, and he gave his own intelligence to help out the authors somewhat meagre outline Mrs Tavares had to play the double parts of mother and daughter She was very effective as the wretched woman driven mad by finding herself the accuser of her lover Her maniac laughter was painful in its intensity, and her powerful portrayal again and again called forth warm approbation from the audience Mrs Wooldridge made the most of a very insignificant part, and the same may be said of Mr Lenton Mr Whyte, too, had but little to do or say What was given him was well done The "hit of the piece, new to here and heroine, was undoubtedly Mr Poole His makeup, his vocabulary, his magic "roof walk, and his business throughout were capital, and his comicality made up for much that was dreary in the play As Bessie Leigh Mrs 'Tavares was natural and attractive The play demanded that she should be prepared to shoot a villain and she displaced more than ordinary familiarity with firearms and flourished a pistol as though twice pocket-handkerchief The scenery was good, and there were calls for the artist The curtain was raised after each act, and twice raised at the close The audience, a very large one, particularly in the dress circle, were in good humour, and applauded the absurdities as heartily as the good points in the play The intervals, between the acts were very long, and there were many extraordinary causes An apology was offered for the delay and the entertainment closed with the farce of "Turn Him Out" It is announced that this theatre is closed until further notice.
