No tidings have as yet arrived of the missing Buninyong mail. The general opinion -- but it is only opinion -- is, that the mail has been robbed and the driver either murdered or tied to a tree. This day's escort is anxiously looked for, in the hope that it may bring some intelligence of this most mysterious affair. A petition is being got up to His Excellency, to save the life of the wretched man Goldman, recently con- victed of the murder of Corporal Harvey. How far the petition may be successful, I cannot even conjec- ture; but the case of Goldman perhaps presents fewer obstacles, to its being favorably responded to than any case of murder I recollect in the colony. In his case there was no gain to the murderer; neither money nor property seemed to be his object. It was a crime committed rashly, and without any regard to the con- sequences. But it was also a deliberate act,—an unprovoked (for there was nothing to justify it) de- struction of the body, and perhaps the soul, of a fellow creature; and it might prove a very dangerous experiment to extend mercy in such a case. Instead of waylaying their victims in future, murderers might be induced to provoke a quarrel with them, and rest on the plea of justifiable homicide, or depend for their lives on the fact of the crime being committed rashly, and while they were excited. The fact of Goldman bring a man of respectable parentage and education, but especially the fact of his being a foreigner, have no doubt created much sympathy for him; and so far as he, as a mur- derer, is concerned, few people would regret to hear of his escape from the gallows, although they could not but admit that he had deserved to die. Two robberies observed here on Sunday night: one, the shop of a Jeweller named Whittaker, Corio-street and the other, the house of a Mr. Bedford in South Geelong. In neither case was any great amount of property, stolen.
