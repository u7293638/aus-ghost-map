GHOST-HUNTING. EXTEAOEDHsAIiT SCENES. Seldom has" suet a scene occurred in a London churchyard as was witnessed during the early hours of the morning of the 21st August in the churchyard of the old parish church ofSL John at Hackney, when fully a thousand men and women turned out from their houses in the neighborhood to hunt the parish ghost. 3?or some time past people passing through the churchyard late at nigllt hare been startled by " a ghost in a sheet." "Women have fainted with fright, and the local newspapers have published accounts of the strange affair. Whether this morning's scene was planned cannot he ascertained (says the Westminster " Gazette" of the 21st August), but between 10 and 11 o'clock last night a mixed crowd began to assemble at the j rear of the church where the ghost was supposed to he, and where in the usual | way scarcely anyone passes after 11 j o'clock. A long wait until midnight, and th n, as no ghost appeared, the crowd went in search of it. Armed with lanterns and candles, and carrying sticks and stones, the crowd climbed the rail ings from the pathways, and took possession of the burial-ground. Graves and tombstones were clambered over, and recently- restored mounds were trampled down. A portion of the crowd looked upon the whole affair as a joke, and con sequently every few-minutes the cry was foolishly raised of " There it goes! " and immediately the whole crowd rushed in the direction indicated, and, as no ghost could he seen, it was argued by the more superstitious portion of ihe crowd that the ghost had disappeared into the earth. Others in the crowd amused themselves by making the night hideous with imitations of unearthly cries, and althongh the police were called to clear the place, it was not until the verge of daylisht that the last few disappointed stragglers went away.
