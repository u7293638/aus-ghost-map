Tho first was with referenco to the dismissal of tho Parliamentary Librarian, Mr. I'arrell, but he would riot treat ' of it at any longth, because; no doubt, it would be n subject for discussion hereafter. (Hear, hear.) He wished to refer to tho tho case because tho untruths in connection with the appointment of Mr. I'arrell had had frtmolliiug like two years to sink into tho public )uind ; and as ho desired that the refuta tion might also have time to do so before the discussion of the matter look place, he would usk tho House to understand that tliero was absolutely no understanding between Mr. Far rell and himself — (Hear, hear) — iu connection with Castloinainc, and - that he had no par :c.nfAr wish at that tiuio to stand for a seat in JPrirlianiont. Ho had mentioned somo months ueforo that he would bo willing to accept a can riaaturo for a constituency; but as no opnor 'O'litCy offered itself, ho had contemplated and ?:o8'eyeii written to inform his friouds of I113' Intention of returning to England in tho ensuing autumn. Mr. Farrcll saw him and said that tho Ministry did not wish him to resign until somo ono was found to stand 'in his plnco and votb with tho party, end he asked him (Mr. Pearson) if he would-bo willing to do so.

The Ministry had no hope of carrying a Reform Bill, and they were merely making a stalking horso of that. bill, and using it as a means to hold on' to office. He was quite pro .pared for dissolution— (checrsand countercheors) — but he thought it a degradation to tho Honse that these threats . should be made in . inspired leading articles. The Government got info office under a kind of false pretence ; tho House had already been told that twenty inem. bora sittiug on tho other side of the House owed their soat3 to the hon. member for l'iclfast. Sir JOHN O'SHANASSY: I (lid not say so. Mr. TUCKER : Well, then, tho hon. member said ho had boon influential in the election of twenjy members.

It had gone beyond that, arid it ' was too late 'in, tho day to --so consider-... it.1 ? The principle had been the law forvnine ? yoara'; it had been approVed' by Iho pcoplo at'.'fdiir dis-' tinct general elections, because ho -wduht assert that it was 'approved even at tho last' election.

The matter was one embracing a' largo public policy, and ho did riot think . thnV'n chance majority should silently ropndiato it. At- all events tlioy ohould not' do so until they got. an expressed1 opinion upon the -suhjeeffrom The country, . which/ ho contended,' was ? riot givcirat tho last clectiom ??Ho was awuro; -what coiirso would ' bo i;..followcd ?? if'., tho- i hon. mem-, her for Mandurang succcedod in his- motion/: but he (Mr. Berry) believed-, and it was an undsr stood matter,, that although it was an open ques tion, andnot a-Ministorial 0110 ; if tho majority ?? affirmed theprinciplo,the Govcrninentwbuld in good faith do all they could to boo that itwa..im mediately put upon tho statute book, of the co lony; It had to bo done iu good faith or not at all. - Since paymont of members there had bcon larger attendances at tho House and a greater desire evinced to diligently carry out the business of the country. In every way Parliaments under payment of mombors had been better than those which preceded them. Several electors in the colony had affirmed the principle, and it was one of cvon greater importance than tho Reform Hill, for it meant tho representation of manhood suffrage. He would pay tho hon. mem ber f or J5oroondiira the compliment of saying that ho had been consistent upon this question. He (Mr. Murray Smith) had nover taken payment for his services a3 a member, and his action showed an adhcrenco to a principle that was rarely mot with. If it was a sound system of national policy it was applicable to the town as well as to the country. Ho had only spoken at this length because it was an important question, aud in ordor that it might not be lost sight of from a public point of view. Mr. LEVIEN believed that tho principle of payment of members was a right one in theory, but in practico its application was detrimental to tho best interests of the country. The conduct of Parliament for tho last n'uio years had shown that, and ho was therefore not justified in voting for the motion. Ho would support payment to country inembora who resided in tho country, but nothing olse. Mr. DOW contended that ovory member in the House could givo an honest opinion on the matter. Thoy wero oithcr in favor of payment of members, or partly in favor of it, or totally opposed to payment altogother. Ho had always been in favor of tho policy, and had advocated it as a principle, and not for any solf- iuterestcd motives. There could bo no half-moasnres about ' a .question of this kind, for if an hon, member believed in payment to those who occupied tho Treasury bouches, ho could not but givo hia voto in favor of paymont to private members as well. Mr. SERVICE said that in making a fow re marks 011 the motion ho desired tp speak a3 a privato member. Thi3 question had novor boen iutoducod by any Government or dealt with as n -matter of public policy until tho hon. momber for Gcelong had dono so in tho last Parliament. Gn tho first occasion Mr. Macgregor had introduced it ; on tho second it wa3 brought on privately by Mr. W, Collard Smith : and on tho last occasion it wa3 for tho firat time usod by Mr. Berry as a groat and important question, upon ? which tho fete' of tho Liberal .party depended. It scsincd to !hiiii':(Mr. 'Service') that ihe.Iiscussion turned', ? itself intS 'llireo' consecutive pitrts^fira't-i' that' itlley.'- did not commit themselves to the1' ?qticstion that, members uliould be pYtd.- Now, ' ?was it possible for. those who were opposed to ; 'payment iri any shape to allow the motion to go 1 jWiiliout.il division, and a division implied a do- | ?bate? He denied that there' had been any iu- - iorc.iscd feeling iu the country in favor of pay- ! 1 m'ciU- of members. On the contrary, it was the fooling against if that- had ' increased. ' He ! did not think that this principle could be ! ?permanent, at all events until some provision J iwns.miulc for submitting such questions to the ' opinion of thceountry.andthe Reform lSill,whicli;j iwould have to be dealt with, -would contain that ' provision. .

He' thought tho system o£ payment, instead of making members independent, rendered them, dependent upon the Govorumout. He intended, to vote ugninst the motion. . . .
