IVHAT'' IS TRUTH ? TO TIIE EDITOR, S?,--Under tile above handing Mr. R. Sindel writes in your last ire tha action, or inaction, of the W .s loyan conferouco in tihe matter of divorce. With most of the members of thoconfcrenc, I had left beforu the question came on. But I read tihe report of the subsequent proceedings in the Sydney papers. I did not read that, as Mir. Sindel says, " the chairmau reIused to put tihe motion condemn ing the divorco movement of the day, because asn ho (the chairmaun) sanid, he feared it would be loit." The presidont of the coufe'renco never refuses to put a motiou on such grounds. Buot the motion was withdrawn by thu mover rather than risk a possible defent. The fact doubtless wnoas tlhat the cenfereneo wans attenuaonted to a ghost of its former self, nod it nwas not thought wise to have a decision upon esuch a gravo qruestion given by osuch a small remnant, and whlen there was a difference of opinion even in tlhant. I do not therefore admit that whant weh as done on the occasion at all represents the views of our church upon this important nmatter or an be cousidered ne interprotativo of its attitude towards thile Divoroeu Bill. Ohler Wesleyann conoferences bhave this year recorded their disapprovaol of thebo extended bases of divorce that it isl contemplated to nilow.--Yours, &cE.;, ARTHUR J. WEBB.
