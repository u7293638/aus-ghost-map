Australian Belief. ALL the tribes believe that the earth is flat, and that the rsky is propped up on poles. Beyond the sky is the gum-tree country, the home of spirits and ghosts. Every man has within him a Yavibo, or spirit, which can leave his body and wander even to the gumtree country and talk with the spirits there, or converse with the wandering ghosts of other sleepers. The . state of departed souls and their doings after leaving the human body fijla great part of Australian mythology. The dead are buried doubled up, the body lying on the side, and the usual deposit is made of the personal effects of the deceased. Mr. Howitt, in the Journal of the Anthropological Institute.
