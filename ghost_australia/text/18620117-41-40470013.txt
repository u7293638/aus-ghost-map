KAPUNDA. [From our own Correspondent.] Kapunda, January 16. The blessed rain is at length descending, after a fortnight's intense heat, during part of which our town has proved, contrary to general rule, to be the hottest in the colony, the thermometer at the Telegraph Station reaching as high as 126° in the shade on one occasion, and frequently reaching 115°. The former I should have thought an error but that it was partly corroborated by other ther- mometers. An inquest was held yesterday by Mr. Browne. S.M., at Mr. McNamara's, on a fire which burned 20 acres of grass on the line of railway, about four miles from here, and which, but for the desperate exertions of the neighbours, would have destroyed some ten square miles of wheat. The verdict showed that it was caused by the railway engine, which for two days have been without the spark-catchor— a most dangerous thing during the very hot weather, especially as the grass along the line is a foot hiuli, while the strong winds blow the sparks hundreds of yards. Coal and coke aru burnt instead of wood, as causing less sparks; but still the catcher should never be taken off; or, if it has to be cleaned, another should be provided. A lecture was delivered at the Institute last Friday, by Captain Needham, on 'The Siege of Sebastopol" Very few attended. The subject advertised was 'Ghosts,' by the Rev. Mr. Russell; but that gentleman was unable to atten4 and Captain Needham kindly filled his place. I understand that Dr. Tallis, of the Adelaide Hospital, in about to commence practice here in the place of Dr. Blood, who intends leaving the colony shortly.
