i : THE; UNBIDDEN GUEST.,., It was-oiie ;of those foggy evenings towards"1' the close of autumn/ when horses are "apt "''to1'1' poke their noses into shop windows, and . p'e-. destriahs pressed for time to find that': 'they have gone just half a town's length out : of . their road : in a word, it was an orthodox - November evening, when Nicholas Klauersat .-, in his leather-botromed arm chair, -hy'a' cozy fireside, with a black cat purring and wash ing her ears at his feet, and a spacious glass,'' with nothing in it but a spoon, on a. table be. side him. His wife— considerate creature !— . having quitted him to visit a gossip in the neighborhood, he had been indemnifying hbu-' self for his solitude by a hearty supper, which' ! despatched, he was now, in the true spirit : of luxurious idlesse,' indulging in a variety of ' vague, listless ruminations— at one moment'1 shaping figures out of the glowing embers, and at another speculating on the probability of his.: escaping the effects of -the last mouthful of -a" delicious pate, which, like many another ,'epi-1 cure, he had prevailed on himself to swallow, merely because it was the last. Ah, that last mouthful ! How much : mis- chief has accrued to society from indulging in it. Could he but have refrained from the 'si/'" vory superfluity, and obeyed the remonstrances-, . of nature when she cried ' hold, enough !' Sir. ' Gregory Gaster might have. been alive to this . : hour; but it lay so provokingly before him,' -, right under his veiy nose, at the late 'Lord1 Mayor's inauguration feast, that his epicurism was not proof against the seduction ; « it is the ' last mouthful, ' said he, ' and surely tlidh coin. . do me no great harm ! ' So he swallowed it, and died that same night of a surfeit. 'What made a howling maniac of Atkinson, the. rich- > stockbroker? Precisely the same infirmity of purpose exhibited in a different form. He had ' " already amassed a ' plum,' and was advised by all who felt an interest in his welfare to retire and hive his gains. But no, he must secure- one, more slice— just one ' last mouthful the new tempting foreign loan. Well, he did, so, but scarcely was the false hunger of his avarice appeased, when down went the stock1,': 1 and away went the fortune of the distracted ' miser. Poor Charles Mordaunt! He, .too,1' must, insist on his 'last mouthful,' for who' does not know that ambition, like covetousness and gluttony, has an ever craving wolf in its. belly ? Charles had long held a distinguished,1 post in the cabinet, but what of that ? Though high — he was not highest ; power had yet one ' last mouthful ' wherewith to tempt his appe- ' tite, and in intriguing for possession of this' he- sacrificed character, and, ultimately,- life it-' self. I might enumerate a thousand other in-. . stances of the danger of giving way to the temptation of. a ' last mouthful,' but I am hot : writing a homily, so must return to the hero 1 of my narrative, whom I left indolently rumi-. ' nating by his fire-side. While thus 'occupied; a sudden knock at the door roused him from his reveries, and,' gently raising himself/, iie began to consider who the varlet could be, that thus dared to disturb an Ingoldstadt burgher in the very midst of his nocturnal devotions; Some people speculate on visitors by: their1- knock, and Nicholas was one Of these. His first impression was that the intruder , was nb' , other than his wife, returned unexpectedly ;to modei ate any exuberant felicity he .might j.be indulging in ; but the sang froid. of his/cat,: who well knew the dreaded rap, convincedihimi i that this could not be the case, and he Was-ih"' the act of puzzling himself with a1 variety 'iff'""- conjectures, 'when;, bang !

Accordingly;' after - \ cautiously peeping through the : key.- hole, in order to get some glimpse of the stranger's" _ face or figure, in which, however, he was dis-'-'- appointed by the darkness of the night;' he' unlocked the door and let him in, not. a ' Httie'j ' induced thereto by the rain, which now' began', to descend in torrents ; for Nicholas, notwith- , standing his self-importance, was, in the main, , ; a well-natured fellow, and would scarcely have refused shelter, even to a poor man, at such lac season. ' No sooner had the stranger entered than he moved briskly forward into the parlor, , and'dn- ' ' sconcing himself in his host's own , sabred'' OP1 chair, said, in a chuckling tone— , n1 'How are you, Nick?

Be had a grey, piercing eye, ever on the look- out, as if for'his landlord's silver spoons ; a huge mouth, which seemed made for no other 'purpose than to perplex a perigord pie ; broad, square chest, indicating prodigious personal strength ; legs bowed like a parenthe sis.;' and large red ears, which stood off from either side his head, like the paddle-boxes of a steam-hoat. The general expression of his cast-iron countenance was that of caustic hu mor ; , but it was constantly changing, as were also: the tones of his voice, which were now arch and sportive, and now harsh and peculiar asth'ose of a Yankee boatswain. His attire presented nothing remarkable, except that he "wore a pair of superannuated black shorts, a seedy, cocked hat, and pearl-grey stockings, with clocks running tip to the calf of his leg. Altogether, his look, style, and bearing; con veyed the idea of a mouldy lawyer on the hunt 'for a client.

Was he a player— was he a pedlar — was he this — "was he that — was he t'other ? A thousand -random speculations passed through the bur gher's brain, and as he hinted the most plaus- '. ible of these to his guest, in the hope of draw- ...ing him out, he received such curt dry answers as served still further to mystify him ; and at -length he had nothing left for it, but to scratch -his. head, and put on that air of uncommon se riousness which is the last resource of men in a state of perplexity. But though the stranger refused to gratify ..-, his host's curiosity, he evidently enjoyed' his ,. bewilderment ; and filling his glass lor, I be lieve, the twentieth time, drained it to . the health of Nicholas, and then setting it down .with the sell-satisfied air of a good man who . . has -just fulfilled a sacred duty! said,' Wh'ataiis- you; Nick ? you look amazed.. /' 7 . ' And no wonder. But, I say what are you going to do with that ham-bone f'" - ; , v ' Swallow it to be sure.' " . ' ' ' ' ' Swallow it ? Mercy on us, what a stbmach you must have!' " Why, what a fuss the man' makes abo'iit a small ham bone 1 There' was a time, Nick, when you were running a poor, houseless lad about Ingoldstadt, when you . would not , kave turned up your nose evenata'ham hone.' s Few great men like to be reminded of their past insignificance, and Nicholas was proverbi ally sensitive on this point, 1 Looking therefore his guest as savagely as he could have eaten him; he said— ' I d have you to know, friend, that T am a burgher of Ingoldstadt, and will have no free doms taken with me ; so, if you cannot keep a civil tongue ia your head, the best tiling you can do will be to quit my house.' ; 'B|lh! hah! liah 1 ' replied the unknown, throwing himself back in his arm-chair, and ut- tering a sort of hoarse, imperfect bleat, ;likjs a sheep with a sore throat : '.yon-are in- a pas sion, Nick ; be calm, I beg, as you value -my good opinion.' ... 'Your good opinion 1 Well; upon my soul, you are, without exception, the most impudent dog I ever set eyes on,' said the burgher, more and more puzzled to account for his guest's.in- explicable conduct. ' Don't be saucy, Nick, or I shall pull your nose,' and before the indignant Nicholas bad time to express his opinion of this unparalleled affront, the stranger seized the ham bone and swallowed it with the same apparent ease with which Ramo Samee used to swallow a bolster ; his host, while lie witnessed this achievement! giving vent to his wonder in such broken sen tences as ' Well, I never'—' Can it be possible?' — ' Bless my heart, what a mouthful ! ' - The table being now fairly cleared; Nicholas began to entertain a hope that his guest would take his departure, and to expedite so desirable a move," he yawned as if he had just finished the perusal of the Omnipresence of the' Deity,' and threw out hints about its being late, and time for all decent folks to be a-bed But the stranger either could not, or would hot;1, tin derstand his meaning, whereupon Nicholas: was. formally proceeding to give him noi ice tp:!quit; ' when he was stopped- by ' Your ; ham 7:bqbe makes a very ; pretty relhh, Master vKlauer-;- but now for serious 'eating.

You know well — for I can see it in your hesitating l»ok — th-it there is just a pate or two left in your pantry, so go and fetch ihem. Come, not a word, 1 will he obeyed ; ' and the stranger cast such a fierce, mennceous glance at his host, that Nicholas, who was of a, pacific turn of soul, was actually bullied into ! submission, though it went into his very heart's core to see the dainties which he had especially ; put by for the morrow's recreations thus con-' signed to the all-devouring maw of some an-, onymous adventurer. As this last reflection crossed his mind, and he saw his unbidden guest making the most de structive inroads on the integrity of his dailing viands, his own mouth began 16 water, and at length his epicurean propensities getting the better of him, he burst out with ' Stop, fail- play's, a. jewel ; it's my turn now,' and. made an immediate snatch at the one remaining dainty. . , . _ , ' Why, you greedy brute!', roared'the eb- raged stranger, hurling his cocked- hat at- Ni cholas's head, ' would you have ine die of hun ger, while that vile, sophisticated paunch of yours is crammed even to suffocation? For shame, Master Klauer, for shame; how cnnyou' expect' me to call again, if you treat 'me in this unhandsome, manner ?' W- ith which ' wo' ds he laid fast 'hold of the pate, and .'.bolted it in what Lord Duberly significantly / calls the twit kling of a bed-pole. .-i, Up to this hour the honest burgher had kept his fpars under some sort qf;restruint ; b.ut they now- began: to overpower him, especially when 'he 'came-to reflect, on his , position, ; Not a'soiil. bat himself and his strange, visitor were in, -ilie house; the hour was verging on-midnight ; 'ihe; patrol had taken his last rounds,' . and the sound "of footsteps . had long .'since died away in , the streets. Y et at this very . hour/for 1 aught- Ni cholas could say to the ci'ihVrary, he'might. be sitting cheek by jowl with :80iTie , cool and prac tised- desperado, who, taking advantage of the favorable opportunity, ' might rdb-rmurder--7' pop him into a sack — and bury him in; a coal- ;hole. In such an event, who could hear his outcries? His neighbor on the right was a deaf baker, and on the left a bed-ridden book seller. It was a clear case. Hap what' might, he had not the. ghost of a chance 'left— not a peg whereon to hang a hope. 7 These dismal reflections were not at all re lieved by the lights and sounds about him. His favorite cat, with that fine tact peculiar .to: ani mals, kept constantly peeping out between his legs, and casting uneasy glances at the stran-. ger— the tall upright clock ticked like a death- watch in his ear — the sulky fire set all, the per-: suasions of the poker at defiance— and the lights on the table burned or seemed to burn with a strange, sickly light, throwing the most.ecceu.- tric lights and shades on the harsh -lineaments of the stranger. Nicholas, was ' by no' means deficient in personal courage, yet he: could .hot choose but feel alarmed at1 his position1; and when, with a shrewd eye to results, be stole a glance at his visitor's athletic frame, and- then took into consideration his own helpless obe sity, his very soul sickened within him,1 and he was thinking by what means he might best rid himself of his unbidden guest's presence, when; as if he read what was passing in his mind, the latter observed— 1 You don't half like me, Nick— I see you don't. Well, there is no accouiiting'for tastes, thoueh 1 have been reckoned handsome, L as sure you. However, never mind that ; let us talk of more important matters.; ... Ypto. pan-, try' — - .

'You aire sarprised at my appetite!' re sumed the stranger, 'and no wonder, fori look delicate.' - ' Delicate 1' muttered Nicholas, while, the phantom, of a wan smile flitted across .'his face. , ... M 7 ' No more of this, Nick,' -said the Unknown, sternly,.

If I do,' rejoined the burgher, in a high state of acetouB effervescence, ' I'll be' — - ' A loud laugh— Say rather a?fierce!yell of ex/ liltation from the anonymous!
