,,/BALLARAT BISHOPRIC. — We. (ArgiiB) cannot well imngine anything more disgiHceful to llie'ineniEers of the, Church of England in this colony tlian tbeRifficulty which., has arisen in connexion with ,tbq en-_ dowineht of the Ballarat bishopric'. ' Patting ilia I'sillniAtin oona/>) r\f iho rilKA nnlrlA illifl gether, let us consider the, eubject in a pure) v business' )>oint' of view. " As is well known, the adherents of the! Anglican .Cburcb. in' this colony are far more numerous tbanzthose.oi any. other denomination. ./ They have decided through 'thqir representatives, in the Churetii Assembly that it is neoessary to found au- dther .-Bep, ,tbe emolument attached/ to which should !'be XI, 000 jier annum, derived from h capital- sum of £20,000. Anyone would haye | thought /that amongst tlie' wjettlthy difir ciples "of/ that church .such a cpmpanuively trivial, ; sum/. would havei been subscribed in a week/ r./It! is almost impossible to" -take up 11 fileTof papers after- the arrival1 of/tbe'-Ebglisb mail without rending of some 'gen tleman who h'ojS'; built ;apd endowed a church or/school, ai a cost to himself, far exceeding , the: amoun t required to place the Ballarat bishopric 011 a a'ound pecuniary footing.- How different ia, it' /with us. By the . utmost exertionaiid Ardhdeacon Stretch, has. been very aoti.ve iri: the. matter— betweeu £9,000 and £10,000 has been collected or promised; ithd in'order1 not1 tb.'allow Dr Perry, to. whom the! selection of;'the new prelate has been in trusted, to be disgraced in the eyes of the church at home, it is necessary to full back upon the fund ac- cruing'frqm tbe siims annually received from the 'state, which fund was intended "fur en tirely different purposes. But this is not all; . or' by any means the- worst. Not only has it been found!>nece6sary - to 'divei't moneys front their legitimate uses in order to provide an other ''oveiaeei" /for the Anglican flock, but also to go cap in band, and; beg for a grant of £2,000 from the Society for Promoting Chris- tian;Kni)wledge. .-This is the last drop in. the cupt'ojf/humiliatidri.- Here we'/fiftd-ia large" proportion' of the popula -ion of 'a rich and prosperous colony — never /back ward, be it ob served, in boasiing of its' wealih and indep'sn- dence--suing, in forma, pauperis for some assistahd9 to relieve .their! spiritual destitu-, tion. Are they not aware that England, with its ieemiDg population, has also its re ligious wants'? Really, it appears to us that if money for 'these matters must pass between the countries, it should go. the'/other way. However tliB may be, one -thing is, certain- no decent membei of the Church of England will ever be ' able/ to look (at/tbe coming bishop of Ballarat' without 'some'thibg akin .to a feeling of: shame. The new bishop -will in voluntarily and unintentionally, remind, those to"-, wb'oiu''.1 /he'iuiniaferbj jhJh/Ab '.ItiiiBy'.bVe. his presence amongst/them in some measure to a charitable dole. /!'/, - , ;/!' . ! / ., All About a Ghost ! — From time' to time; we..(Shoalhaven.

The ghost, in defiance/ /of all locks/ bolts, /and bars, entered the house, and Williams then saw the figure' of a map, dressed, apparently, in the gurb of a bashman. ' It went to the bed where Mr and Mrs Williams were lying, and pulled'the bed clothes off the bed, and lay down beside Williams,' ;who//ho.wever, could feel nothing when he". put out his' hand to' touch' if.
