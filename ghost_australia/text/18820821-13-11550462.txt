VICTORIA AMATEUR TURF CLUB. AUGUST MEETING. The race meeting held by this club at Caulfield on Saturday last will long be regarded as one of the most successful yet held since the inauguration of the V A T C There have upon some few occasions been larger crowds, and perhaps more valuable stakes competed for, but taken generally, a better day's sport has rarely been witnessed The amateur element introduced into a programme always ensures a goodly attendance of the public, and thanks to Messrs Andrew and Robert Chirnside, this feature was prominently to the fore, inasmuch as two races were especially set apart for amateur riders, ' each race being rendered especially attractive by band some additions of plate presented by the aforenamed gentlemen A general feeling of regret was expressed at the cause of Mr A S Chirnside's absence, owing to a painful illness The weather was in every way most agreeable for a Grand National day, and the large attendance of the general public showed most conclusively that when a good programme is submitted a due share of public patronage is assured, and those who supported the club have every reason to be satisfied, for the report from first to last was of a superior description, the Caulfield Grand National producing such a race as is rarely seen Punctually to time the bell rang out its summons for the first event on the card, previous to which, however, His Excellency the Governor, accompanied by Lord Hervey Phipps and Captain Le Patourel, arrived, and the sale is held of 2.1 youngsters faced the Starter s Hug AB they took their present Mary canter they were closely scrutinised and the majority certainly showed excellent quality. It is scarcely to be wondered at that Mr W, ate on should have some slight difficulty in getting SO large and juvenile a field well away, but after a few unsuccessful attempts the ii g fell to a some what indifferent start, Duenna, who was the favourite KIHI of the forest, and one carrying the colours of Mr L L Smith lining first to show in front a position the two first named maintained until the bush, Honora, vi who waaalrnostlust away coming fast through her field and finishing a fair third The Hurdle Race which followed proved a Bones of centre trips from first to last Merry Maid, who was ridden in a wild ridiculous fashion, rushed to the front at the word to go, and was soon a long way ahead of horfield those in her in mediate wake being Red Rover, Tlolworth and Lord of Clyde, the favourite Rhesus and Dhurringile being considerably in their rear At the far turn, however, the former three run off and the race was left to Merry Maid, RhcBue, rind Dhurringile, the former continuing her wild career It seemed at one time an utter impossibility for her two opponents ever to overtake her as she led into the straight fully ten lengths ahead of Rhesus, who kind, when to all appearances too late started in hot pursuit Merry Maid, however tired, and Khesua caught her within a few lengths of home and won brilliantly On returning to scale Sanderson, the rider of Merry Maid, was brought before the stewards for having missed a hurdle and yet continued the race, for which offence he was very properly disqualified for 12 months. The Amateur Challenge Cup brought out all those coloured on the card, eight gentleman riders starting It was a capital race, notwithstanding the customary falls which seem inevitable whenever an amateur steeplechase is being run, but the wish was to a certain extent unsatisfactory, for Mr Sholleck, on Edith, went inside a post and a protest entered by the rider of Glow light being sustained, he was disqualified In spite of sundry falls, which are fully referred to later on, fortunately none of the riders received more than a severe shaking The inevitable Selling Rice followed and L'bc Ghost, ridden in winkers, easily settled the pretensions of his opponents winning comfortably The Caulfield Grand National next demanded attention, and there was but one absentee from the hat, namely The Marquis, thus beating the magnificent field of 17 It is highly improbable that a Quer spectacle boB ever yet been witnessed in the Australian colonies, the horses one and all tall ing their fences in grand style, indeed, it was not until passing the stand the BOconrt time that a mishap of any consequence occurred , here, however, Breechloader came down, later on Mameluke fell and Stag ran round, but the majority were jumping splendidly Left Bower, who was favourite, never occupied a very prominent position until the turn for home, the running being taken up by Sara field, Young Deceiver, Hands Down, and Jack Scandal alternately, but, when Corrigan did call upon his horse he passed his opponents one by one as if they were standing still, and cantered up the straight an easy winner, Chrysalis being second and Jack Scandal third Napoleon, who was running very strongly, came down heavily at the last fence, or he probably would have finished close up For the Amateur Flat Race Grambeau was made a strong favourite and although he was ridden by Mr J O Inglis, he could only get second to Don Quixote, who won without trouble The SAILING ST IVES 01 £0 says For two year olds Weights, colts 7st 12th , fillies 7st 7lb Three furlongs Mr D S W aliácea gi Duenna, by Lecturer -
