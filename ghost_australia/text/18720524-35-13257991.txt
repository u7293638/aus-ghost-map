MR. PARKES ON MR. FORSTER. TO THE EDITOR OF THE HERALD. Sir -The Ministerial election for East Sydney)- being over, it term B not an improper time for me to notice, with your 1 ltd permission, certain personal references and allusions to insert, introduced by Mr. Parkes among the other elaborate personalities b) which the public utterances of this high public personage have been of late so abundantly) dia languished. I find it reported, in the Tin aid of May 22, that Mr Parkes, in his perfunctory oration at the nomination for Paddington, the day previous, spoke of me as follows - He offered the choice of office to Mr William Forster II at gentleman, when he trusted with the formation of an Administration, and it a condition that he (Mr. Parkes") should not be a member of it So far as this statement has any meaning, I give it the List unqualified denial 'I deny that under the circum bad news referred to, or under any circumstances, I made, or endeavoured to exact from any person whatever, such a condition. And indeed to any person of sound judgment, not thrown off his balance by personal prejudices or overweening self-appreciation, one would think the Mnttmuit in question must be obvious!) not only untrue, but absurd, With whom did I " make, from whom was it necessary, or even possible for me to exact such con Qition, lot the exclusion of Mr Parkes, or anybody i With his accustomed happy indefiniteness and oracular obscurity, Mr 1 area has taken care not to enlighten the public upon this point He has not told us what benefit or service I cleared, or could offer, in return for, or in consideration of, this so called condition He has not shown how the question of such a condition more, or could have arisen, between myself and the other persons with whom I was brought into personal or political communication It was quite unnecessary for me to propose such a case- amen to her Majesty's representative, because I had all the Parliament-nay, the colony-to choose from, and was in no way bound to name any particular individual And even Mr Parkes, with all his curious felicity of assertion and innuendo, will scarcely venture to assert or insinuate that if I had been ignorant or foolish enough to propose such a condition to Sir Alfred Stephen, he would have entertained at for a moment And as to the persons whose co-operation I sought, it is clear, is 1 was the belief, that the power of making or exacting conditions rested with them, and not with me It may, or may not have been-Int whether or not is real]) quite an ii Btf rial to the question-that these persons offered me certain toDdmons as the price of their co-operation and that one of these conditions was that I should seek the i to operation of Mr Parkes It is true that long before, and also after, I was honoured by Sir Alfred Stephen with the trust above mentioned, I found myself beset by friends of Mr Parkes, who died in their power to induce either to seek the co operation of Mr Parkes, or to join him in forming an Administration They may have done this from the purest public motives, and in no way from con i lactations of prospect of benefit to themselves, as possible members or supporters of what I was assured would be a very strong Government indeed, is perhaps it would have been They may have done it without the knowledge of "Mr Parkes, who, in his grand innocence and simplicity, seems to be generally quite ignorant of what his friends are saying or doing on his behalf It may have been greatly to my loss and discredit that I did not comply with these as documents, or that I did not accept such a condition, supposing it to have been effused However, as the public are already aware, I neither sought Mr. Parke 's co-operation, nor, when he Eouent mine, by off ring me of ore, did I for a moment hesitate to refuse his offer. But all this does not prove the truth of Mr Parkes's statement, because it was in my power to hold myself aloof from him, as I have held myself up of, without any c dillon whatsoever I am not quite deÂ« whether, by his statements or in RiMBticns of i n intrigue tig inst him, Mr Parkes intended to brand me as one of the intriguers But why should I expect to escape bealhleiB men than Sir Alfred Stephen' Everyone km was that it i ilnrptteriBtic of Mr. Parkes on all suitable occasions, to picture himself as the centre of a crisis, and surrounded by dark etntpracica und intrigues And doubtless theme essful author of the Feniuc Con- spiracy, popularly known UH the .. Kiama, Ghost," may claim a sort of vested right in public of creditor. But in this case, from what has been said about a, the public will be apt tobuFptttthat, if any intrigue existed it was all on the other side, and that its object was to table or to coerce me into an ass nation which, he never profitable to myself and others, would have destro)t.Whatovet public reputation x pcsEfEB whether it be free c or small. Another of Mr Parke B B y,c\\\ some characteristics has been exemplified in this matter I mean the prerogative he assumes to diaper 60 with the ordinary obligations of honour between man and man, and to regard all breaches of private confidence as capable of being condoned for his own personal prop for convenience Whatever sutton of conditions arose Wweenm) self and those whose cooper attend sought in forming a Ministry could only have become known to him by their disclosure of what occurred in such confidential intercourse as necessarily belonged to- mat occur soon ThiS public promulgation-I pressure with the concurrence of his colleagues is worthy of the states man who, after having been possessed for seventeen )CB/B of a letter confidentially addressed to him as editor of a newspaper, divulged its contents to damage or confound a political o] pt neat in the Legislative Assembly And now I venture to ask why cannot Mr. Parkes not in place .. If, for a short time, by no desire or effort of my own, I stood a little in his way, I have left the road open to him Junee. Whatever he or his friends' me as I, have not interfered with his nrronncmcnte, or joined in any of these " machinations" attributed to all who do not see -OB I own I do not see -in Mr Parker, a Political Mas club I have saved him from a perhaps troublesome and impracticable colleague, by refusing office under what we are t do is to be the strongest Government ever known or heard of Some time or other I may tell him why I refused bm efftr But in the meantime, why does he not love me to that obscurity und insignificance which I had the bad title or Jolly to prefer of being associated with him in political partnership Surely, after such a convincing; proof of my want of foresight and patriotism, I have reason to complain that he should still think it worth his willing to make me the butt of ambiguous obaigcBanel pro soundly philosophical sartasmi-or worse-that he should continue to be matter me with mawkish praises, than wbiih-letme assure him, whatever he may think to the ci story- he bring eau Romero nauseous to any man of ordinary refinement, not to speak of decent feeling, or ci nimou honesty I am, Sir, yours As WILLIAM FORSTER. Sydney, May 23.
