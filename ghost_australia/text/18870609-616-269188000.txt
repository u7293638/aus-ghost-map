BETHANGA. [from our own correspondent.] Tuesday, Juno 7. Snow commenced to taU about 8 a.m. on Monday and continued until noon when the rain came down. The hills are quite white and this has seldom been seen in Bethanga before. I have a recollection of a similar fall about six years ago. Mr. Askew intends removing the house known as the All Nations Hotel, which he intends having erected dose to his hotel as an assembly room. The furnaces have been running now about a fortnight without a stop and some sixty tons of regulus has been turned out. This is one of the best runs ever known here. Last Saturday was pay day and about £1100 was disbursed. The Albury Minstrels gave us a great treat in the Star Hall on Satur day night. The building was not well filled in consequence of tho entertainment not being sufficiently .advertised. Tho minstrels had some difficulty in getting a piano. It appears that they had hired the Bethanga Hall with the understanding that there was a piano there, and they did not find out that there was no instrument at the place until their arrival in Bethanga. They were glad to get tho Star hall at tho last moment as no one would lend them a piano except the owners of the latter hall. The entertainment was very good. The “ Ghost in a Pawn Shoj>” fairly brought down the house. I feel sure this company would have a “bumper” house if they came this way again.
