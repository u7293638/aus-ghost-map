poetry For those wlto Fail. " ALL honor to him who shall win the prize," The world baa cricd for a thousand years ; But to him who tries, and who fails, and dies, I give great honor, and glory, and teara. Give glory, and honor, and pitiful tears To all who fail in their deeds sublime, Their ghosts are many in the van of years, They were born with Time in advance of Time. Oh, great is the hero who wins a name, But greater, many and many a time, Some pale-faced fellow who dies in shame, And lets God finish the thought sublime. And great is the man with a sword undrawn, And good is the man who refrains from . wine; But the man who fails and yet still fights on, Lo, he is the twin-bom brother of mine.
