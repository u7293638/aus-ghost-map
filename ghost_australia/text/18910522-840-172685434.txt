Geyndah races tuko pluoo on Wednesday and Thursday 'next, and if all that wo hear of Margott oftn'ho depcndod upon, she should win two ont of tho throa principal handicaps, if not the treble ; but she may racot very respeatablo opposition from Baton and Mr. Singlo's horso Buckingham, who racod so wall at Kilkivan lostwook. Although tbo Brisbane Oup horses, Buttons and Laureato, won their races at Warwlok and Beaudosett roephotivoly, the performance of neither brought 'thorn into more favourable notiao for tho big race next Monday, for But ton' really heat nothing oxcopt Garuda, who war rid ten far loss judiciously in that race than under M'Cabo's guiditiou in the >Tnrf 01 uh Haudloap noxt day, fur the lattar rode intelli gently to orders, and gat all that could be got at of the filly. Lanroate, too, had nothing' behind him better than Navigator, who was in receipt of bnt 3 lbs., and though tho son of Bopilevo won with ridioulons ease, ho, liko Battens at Warwiok, was bound to do that or givo up the ghost ns a oup oandidato. His, dofent: by Vizier iu tho threo- quarter . mile Beacdesort Plato goos for Uttlo or nothing, to my . mind, and in nowise rubs off what little gilt there was on tho gingerbread of his mile and a-hali win ; for the horse is vory sore, and slow to get gal loping, and his oonqucror, though no wonder, is very bard to catch when given any law. It was a poor field that Kadi: beat in tho local race, tbo Totvnsvulo Oup. Criterion got homo gallantly, and a bib luokily too, perhaps, in tho Hurdles, aud Oslo- donian ran respectably, as did tho Wilbcrforco gelding, Bight Bower, till bo foil.
