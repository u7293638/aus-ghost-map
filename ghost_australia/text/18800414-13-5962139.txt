I ST. PAUL'S CATHEDRAL. I The foundation-stone of St Paul s Cathe- dral was laid yesterday afternoon by His Ex cellency tho Marquis of Normanby The weather was delightfully fine, and the very large number of persons present testified to the great interest taken in the erection of the cathedral. THE CATHEDRAL MOVEMENT In connexion with yesterday's ceremony it will be interesting to trace the efforts winch have been made from time to time to erect a tathedr il m Melbourne The first proposal of tins eharicter emanated from Lisboy Perry at whose instance a meeting te ton°ider the Bubject w is held at Bishops court Ihe ollera ot assistance received at that aneetiug wer», however, bo ni Pie,mhiant that the proposal waa aban doned for a time In August, 18G2 tin bishop atain brought the subject forward this t me before the council of the dioceao, but tue proposal met w lth no better fate Ii 1%4 a church waa needed lor Trinity parish and the neccsaity for a cathedral havuif become more apparent it was decided te erect a building upon such a plan that for t time it might net as the parish church and be ultimately transformed into a chapterhouse for a cathedral Hie result vv is the erection of the i resent Irinitv Church at I ist Melbourne Nothing further waa done until 1 cbruary li*'1> when at a meet n _ of the Church Assembly the Rev C mon Handheld moved lor the appontment of o committee to consider the desirability of obtaining plana for u cathedril Ihe com mittet waa appointed j Ians wero prepared and n report waa presented to the assembly by Canon Handheld 1 be report m addition to the committees views on the cathedral contained several valuable suggestions as to the constitution of the cathedril board and ultimately formed the basis of the first Cathedral Act 'Hie report however, led to no practical results as regarda the erection of a cathedral, nnd the subject rested in nbey ance until lSuS, when Mr Speedily a pupil of Sir Gilbert Scott, viaited Melbourne after having superintended the erection of a catho dral m New Zealand Ilia viBit here revived the agitation, and Mr Speedily, in con junction with Mr Terry, vvaB employed to prepare fresh dcsignB for a cathedral these were prepared, and, although defects were noticed in them, they were approved of, and remained the reco=nised plans for the pro posed cathedral until a change of site ren dered freah designs necessary Tins waa not, how ever, until after the arrival of Bishop Moorhouse in January, 1877 Speaking at the brilliant reception accorded to him in tho Town hall, on January 10, Dr Moorhouse referred to the ordination held by him m St James s Church on the preceding daj, and condemned that church as a verymconve vient building for one which they were con strained to call their cathedral He went on to say " Tlicro oug it to bo a placo open In Molbourno for nil churchmen on suth au occasion, vvhero there were no Appropriated Beats and no vergor to say, «Come out of that seat, and let somo ono else come in, but »hero cv cry ono could Bit vvhero ho liked Ho wanted to seo In Melbourno for his fellow churchmen-not of one parish, but of all parishes-aud for all strangers coming to Melbourne from timo to timo, grand ser vices such as peoplo crowded to In St Pauls or Westminster Abbey lio wanted a placo vvhoro lio could put lils fAot and preach ovcry Sun day In his own cathedral, and lie was suro It was north «hilo to build a cathedral If thoy could If peoplo wero in a small placo or district ho would say only build a shanty for a church, as that vvould accord with their circumstances, but peoplo around Mel bourne built palaces for residences, and It did not accord with their daily Ufo to put up shanties for churches Tho peoplo of 8ydnoy and Adelaide wero shaming tho people of Melbourne by their churches, and tho Prcsby torlans and Indopendeit« In Mci bourne wero showing the Church of England people hero what to do IIo had asked what wero tho prill clpal churches ho saw hero and to whom thoy bo longed, and was told that thoy belonged to tho Roman Catholics, or tho Independents, or tho Presbyterians and when bo asked what belonged to the Church of England ho was told St James s It lnicjitbe said ho would lind many difficulties in Iii» way in regard to tho cathedral, but ho had never y et gone back half a loot In tho faco of dlfllculty, and ho would not do so until ho was In his dotage If they would sot to work lu right earnest, and assist bim In raising tho cathedral, they would soon hav o It finished Ho novv follow od in tho steps of one who had built up the church hero, and if bo asked thom to make Its walls somowhat stronger, and to decóralo it they might trust him so far, and extend to him some of tho help thoy had extended to his predecessor The reeult of this appeal to the church was soon evident On the 22nd January the council of the diocese mot and appointed a very large and influential committee to con Bider and report upon the best site for a cathedral, and upon the beat method of raising funds for ita erection 1 his committee recommended the site upon which St James a Church stands and th it a le idmg English nrchitect Bhould be applied to tor suitable designs Upon the recommendation being submitted to the Church Aaaembly, they ob jected to the St James 8 site and oxpressed a preference for one on the 1 astern hill, either uloiifcSide of the Houses of Parliament or on the site now occupied by the model schools Neither of these could however, be obtained, and the Bites of St Petera and St l'uula ond of Trinity Church, Last Melbourne weio mentioned Ihen be^an what may be termed the battle of the sites, and an extraordinary session of the Church As sembly was held in November 1877, to select one Hie East Melbourne sito was not approved of by Bishop Moorhouse and the three sites submitted to the issembly were St Pauls St Peters and St Jameas In favour of St Peters it was urged tint its natural elevation would secure conspicu ousness for the cathedral whereas St Pauls being m a hollow and surrounded by ware houses, would, in time be left as desolate on Sundnvs aa St James s was at that time St Peters was also objected to on the principle that the Parliament Iioubcs vvould hide the cathedral from view while for St lameasit waa pointed out that it had been apecially reserved for the site of the catheral tint it had av iluable endowment and that the site , was an elevated one Hie speakers in favour of St 1 uni s, on the other hand, asserte 1 that itB position waa excellent for a cathedral as it would be the first object to attract the attention of the many thousands who would pass it daily After a prolonged discus-non the assembly divided upon the tbreeproposed sites with the following reault -lor St Paula II votes for St Peters "0, and for St lames a, 20 The last named having the stn illest number of votes waB rejected and a further vote taken between St Peters and fat I nul s when 01 votes were given in favour of the latter and 11 foi tho former St Pauls was therefore decided upon andern bodied in the Cithedral Bill Hie next difliculty which arose was with respect to the selection of an irchitect, some wishing the work to be entrusted to an I nghsh architect of know nubility and otherafavouringcompetí tion whereby local architects would h ive been enabled to compete It was seen however that m an o] en competition the services of Buch men as Sir GilbertSeott and Mr 1 utter field nntht be lost and it was igreed to apply to the latter gentleman for pi ins Ilusivas Jone mid the design submitted by him to the Church Assembly was approve 1 of and ia the ono upon which St P ml s C ithcdral is now to be erected TnE BUILDING Since the design was originally received from Mr Butterfield the situation of the C ithedral building has undergone mi

allowed for additional extensions if these wero in time found to bo necessary Orientation has thus been abandoned, but in describing the proposed cathedral it will bo moro convenient, perhaps, to

Tbero may bo severa reasons, but one is certainly this-becausi music and worship have never been weddei together here under the moat favourable con ditionB Weneed a service w hich shall not onl; give expression to rehgiouB emotion ulread] m existence, but which shall also evoke i when it is absent Impassioned preaching will do something to this end, nay, it will de very much But then impassioned preachint ib not alwayB to be had, or, at leaBt, no1 always in effective power It may be greatlj helped, nay, as in the case of Elisha, it may be superseded by the mysterious influence ol music I have myself felt the wondrouE power of musical services They have melted me when I was hard, they have raised me when I was sluggish, they have spiritualised me when I was earthly Let us only make our young people feel them at their best, when they elevute by their grandeur and edify by their simplicity, and then, while the taste for them spreads, their use in our parish churches would become at once more attractive and more edifying Again, tliere is another and a generally uti suspected use in a large building It helps to make good preachers Ina large building the preacher must speak alowly and distinctly If he mumbles, or dropa bia voice, or takea it easily he will be as the peasant Bald, ' like a bee m a bottle -there will be a bu/¿ and u hum, but there w ill be nothing more (Laugh ter ) Lut when a man l8 compelled to ape ik alowly ind distinctly, he heaiB ind noticca nil that he is saying And if it be foolish or dis jointed, or bald, or dialigured by vapid rhetoric or mixed metaphor, he is himself made coiirciohb of the tact, and covered as he deserves to be with shame at his own performance Depend upon it the next timo he preaches in the cathedral, he will tike caie to have fresh thought lo_ically arranged and nervously expressed And haunt done well once he will acquire the habit of trying always todo well Besides when one spe iks slowly, one must not have too much to say, mid thus one geta into the habit of preachint abort sermons-short ser mons with a good deal m them All these you will observe ire properly the results of having a large and lofty building But now to say a word of the services It is only by cathedral sen icea, vv Uli a c ithedral stall, that we can cirry out adequately the church 8 system of perpetual prayer Vnd you who have had no experience of this system, can hardly conceive its precious and lofty uses Let me specify one or two In a great civic community like tina, there will alvvaya be de vout souls, detached Irom life by the stroke of sickness or the decay of age, who Ion,; to spend their remaining days in communion with the Lord their God 'these are the Simeons and the Annaa who have no wish to depart from the temple day or night And nowhere but in the great church of a cathe dral city can they lind the means of gratifying their desire 'I here, in the stillness and the great space filled continually with the plead mg of prayer and the swell of praise, they lind the atmoaphere which they long to breathe , there, they draw near to God, and live in au anticipated heaven Do you think we do not need than-we busy men, distracted by the caree, the labours, the Borrows of time' Why, to tina day there dw ella, and, to the end of the days that I sojourn upon earth, there will dwell in the eje of my soul, the vision of two aged servants of God-an aged man and woman, whoml once met at a funeral There was the htjit of a better world in the delicate tlow of their faces, tliere waa the peace of lieav en in their gentle saintly ey es And that vision is with mo still-it is and it wall bo to the end-as the visible embodiment of what I would he, and cannot now bo , and yet of what 1 hope that, one day, I may become through the mercy and long Buffering of God And then, again, in the heart of a great city, not upon aomo hill at a distance, but in the heart of a great city, where all its passion and crime are, there should be a house of God ever open, where those who are broken by life s sorrows or sorely am«tten by hfcB sins may always be able to find guidance and solace when they need it When the poor feuilty outcast at his worst-near the brink of the dark river, it may be-is vv andenng in the city desert, aimleBSly, desperately, looking vainly for some helj), some hope, some pity there should always bo an open house of prayer in his own path, as an ark into which lie ma) Uee fcr refuge Ile cannot wait for Sunday nere and now he must be helped, or not at all Open your cathedral m Ina very pathway , let it s prayers plead, let it s praises swell, and perhaps they may lift his lost soul so near to Mount Pisgah that he may catch thence'Some rij of tho Divine pity which h ia Bc'Ling-some glmji se of the blessed hop without which he cannot live Oh, m friends there are many that Bwell the Bin aro there none of these that will hel to build tho refuge' 1 hue spoken c the building and its services But er I close 1 must Bay ono word, how ever brief, about the cathedral chaptei In all ages of the Church Catholic and moa effectually in its best ages, the chapter ha been the council of the bishop \our bisho sorclj needs such a council now and thor But how can that be' j ou will say Has b not the church asaemblj-baa ho not th council of the diocese He has, thank God but these do not give lum the help ho need;
