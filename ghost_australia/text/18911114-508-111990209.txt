That which, however, most particularly allured . him was undoubtedly the *« Gos clkens/' and -with the autocrat-prof essor- poe?3 you^g man, Tom, he would have saw*— Though fair her features be I - ~ '.- It is her figure pleases me. Another thing, too, Which added piquancy , to her pursuit was the notorious fact that, in the preceding season, she had received the full- blooded advances of a splendid Russian Archduke -with indifference, and had treated the aristocratic overtures of an Austrian prlncelet with a maddening dis dain. The former had hastened back to his beloved Paris and despairingly plunged into the wildest of excesses; the latter hadf^&Uen; an easy victim to the designing daughter of a well-known ex-tobacconist of th« West End. These things had been the -common talk of the town, and, although they -were to Lady Hilda painful memories, nevertheless '. they proved an additional charm to one who loved a dash of cayenne in every dish. Sir Harry might perhaps, if ever he gave a thought to matters which had 2x0 : .personal bearing, have agreed that that country is happy which has no history, bufra Woman without a past he considered of all things the most insipid. As to his rival, Claude Brathwaite, on the other ~ hand, much need not here .be saidj except that where Sir Harry was of a calculating turn of mind, Claude was dis interested 3 -where Sir Harry looked upon women as chattels, Claude looked upon them as angels. Which of these young men: was furthest out in his estimate it does not,concern us here to discuss. Tiie yea* tras drawing to a close at the time pur story open3. The Farmley Butts. Christinas party was complete, and Sir Hairy Penniless and Claude Brathwaite were for the first time guests in the an cestral halls of Lady Hilda's father, the Maiqu^s tit Flinders. Their professed object was the snooting of pheasants ; their real and perfectly ostensible pursuit the larger htuhan g≰ above mentioned. Amongst the guests there was ofte looker-on who took the deepest interest in the rivalry of these two young men. This was i old Lady Penniless, Sir Harry's mother. She was what the world calls a ' character,' a natne generally given to those who can ?boast an unusually large proportion of that coniruodity. She was one of these who hold therasolves licensed to say the rudest things in the rudest manner, provided their observations are seasoned with a little smartness. She always walked with the support of an. ebony stick, and, just as she considered that every one who had pet corns or gouty toes %kould keep, themselves out of its way, so she considered any pro truding moral excrescences to be fair game for the exercise of her sarcastic wit. She had travelled much in her youth, and boasted that she never slept without a loaded revolver under her pillow. She had ?witnessed every vice that she had not practised, and was generally .spoken of as ?' that wicked old woman.' indeed, there , was but one virtue, which was ungrudg ingly conceded to her, and that was a deep and real affection for her disreputable little son. That he was not a model of virtue has already appeared, but he, too, must have his due. There was no denying it that, in a very rough and uncouth manner, Sir Hairy Penniless, on his side, evinced a very strong affection for his Wicked «6ld lady-mother. Thus it came about that these two were inseparable companions, living together in London, punting together at Monte Carlo, playing baccarat at Aix-les-Bains, going into training at Hamburg for sext season's course of dinners, and so it came about that they were to be found together at Framley; Butts, For the last two years, ever since Lady Hilda had been ' out,' Lady Penniless nad been scheming for an invitation to the soi&ewhat; excluded gatherings at the Butts, ; but this was the first occasion upon which her efforts h3d been crowned with success. She had noted Lady Hilda's unusual beduty, and knew, of course, what all the , world knew, that she was the possessor of £5000 a year in her own 'risht. And the scheming ' old lady, having consulted with he.r son, had made up her mind that it should be through no fault of hers if her Harry~f ailed to marry into the wealthy Brandon family. Now, when once Lady Penniless had made up her mind to any thing j' that 'thing was, in her ladyship's opinion, incre than half accomplished. As matters turned out, in this case, however, sfee was hardly prepared for the very lead ing part she was destined to play in the ensuing events. Monday in Christmas week had arrived, arul a brilliant party was seated round the hospitable board. X-r GlMstmaB Day in this particular' year happlBned'uppn a Friday. The weather up ;l^,^^.had been exceptionally jppen,#and vpiiej^^^shooting was the order of the : ? d^y. ^; The 'men had to- day been in the ?'.. «oyetsi icbneec[uently they were . tired at .- SiitHerStinae and undemonstrative, and the ladie^, admewhat disgusted, had left them \ v^fy-'tl5:»^sultory' conversation oyer their ^ :i^5$a|jp -: ^hts;tliey had lingered over, and, dtas|piug-tho; reception-rooms blank, had; aft^rWatde collected in the smoking-ioom.

TJkey learned tha^ the|gho^fly^apparition was that ~ot rTt tibrpaSiir; ;'3ffifcjt 'Elizabeth, usually called Lady Beft^ that she was the fairest Brandon th'Sj^is,S/ever been (at this Claude incred%i|ousiy shakes his head); that she was engaged .£&?£*& ioiaTried*.to a certain Sir 'Bohufl^Bat^t, wlip had been found stabbed to th©; h%r|': in.: /his bed the morning of ihe w^^d^g^ay,' and, finally, that the unhappy lady-had stabbed her self to death beneath ^heje 'own portrait in the picture, gallery Kt^o- d^Jf afterwards, attired in all. her wquLi^e wedding finery, as, indeed, she had but rjust been painted by Sir Joshua. ; ^ ^ ? v ' And,' continued the Marquis, 'there is a foolish notion in the family — how it has arisen it would he^djfiicjilt to say — the ladies, of course, believe in it im plicitly—that any ^ daughter of the house who is mei and kis$e-l by this ghostly dame must accept ihe very :next proposal of marriage made tp her,.or her married life Will prove nothing less thaii disastrous. There are various 'cloggelrels embodying the , Superstitions, attaching to the ghost. This is the one referring to the curious notion I have mentioned-:- ; A winsome bride the ;^L-ady ': Betty is, And woe to Branddn who shall bide her kiss, ^ '?'?', '?: ??..?'?'':.' Nor fall into her -nexte wooer's arms, But curse another with her teasing charms. /..-i'. And then the garrulous 'gentleman went on to tell at length certain apocryphal tales of divorce, desertion, cruelty, and other miseries which had followed upon a disregarding of this 'ghostly tradition. These weref amusing enough, but Claude, for his part, felt, this ; washing of dirty linen in public would-: have been better honored in the . breach: than . in the ob servance. ,. 'y' :?'?'. v As may be readily understood, the imagi nations of both these young men were somewhat fired T-y .tins narration, long winded though it was..;: Sir Harry, in par ticular, evinced so strong a desire to become acquainted with all the details of the tradition that his host volunteered to escort him to the gallery andjpbint out the various beauties of the picture.. ; This offer was eagerly accepted, and with, such particu larity did the young man examine all its details and appreciate vail its attractions that the old man. went ..to, bed convinced that his guest was % jierspn of far more than ordinary culture and? observation. Claude, in the, meantime, remained in the smoking-room with the t^fro Jbored cousins above mentioned. ; : '. V On the Marquis's ;:4epariure with Sir Harry, one of them, Horace Starling by name, had addressed himself to his com panion — : V . . 'Why is it that- : Che .''old man never tells the rest of -the legend now-a-days, Charlie ?' : £\\.''~ ' Oh, I think his memory's going,', says the oth'er cousin. ?*? I oiiiy wi.sh he would forget the whole fl, * ; nonsense.' ' Why, what .else is iiiere?' said Claude, with an alert show of interest, in marked contrast to the languid bore do in of the others. '-' . f . ' Oh,' drawls Starling, af ter^ pausing as long as was decent, to see if Charlie would save him the trouble of repeating the story. ' It's only some stupid \ idea that the wretched creature will continue to drag on a miserable existence, ^strolling about at nights, and frightening , everybody, until somebody goes to marry her in the spirit world. There's a rhyme about it, but my memory's so bad. Whatis it, Charlie? AIL I can remember it that there's a deal of swearing in it.'* . , . '?_.. Charlie's memory, proved, happily, some what more robust than Horace's, and he repeated the following stanza — A bloody bride, the Lady Betty is, ? A. bloody bridegro∋, ilie' does ^want, I ™ i ? r, ,\\-r- ::?,-.. .'??-... And she will -yrander Junder mortal skies Until a bloody^hande^)ridegroom dies. ' There,' said Horace triumphantly. ' I told; you there wis plenty of bad language about it.' jy ;?-:';.«.'??

' Oh,' said Charlie^ t^ierfe's no mystery about that. When it was too late to stop Lady Betty killing herself, they found that Sir Bohun was really niaasried already, and had left a wife and ftV-? dhildreD.' After which- unusually ^animated conver sation, Horace ya#ne^ aiid-the party broke up and went off lc- bed:* ^ ; * The next morfllnjgfSJi Harry declared that business cabled Mni to town for a couple of daya, but tk^t %$ would certainly be back on Chrietnias 'EV&i; ; He assured Lady Hilda, whoira U^mta^&d; to bid fare well to alone, thi^t ^jcrthirig^but matters of the most urgent impoibajace would induce him to tear himself ^d«a 3&er;«ide, and -for once he told the absqiute^truth.

He, of course, pro Eessed-aifoin^; ? bounded admiration for the splendid rpor-« trait of the Lady Betty, about whoin he feigned the profoundest ignorance, draw ing his companion on to tell as much o£r its history as she was inclined to, and then enjoying in ungenerous, manly ; fashion* the confusion with which she pulled her-; self up as she approached the more sug gestive portion of the legend. ,..? ,? -. v ...,-? *?

Then it flashed across him that there had been a cause celebre in the family, about which- the less said the better, and about which even the Marquis, in. hifc garrulity the night before, had made no mention ; and he recklessly dashed into -n idiotic remark to cover the poor girl's confusion^ He drew attention to the benevolent? expres sion which suffused the countenance -s£ the stone lion upon which the lovely. Lady Betty w^as represented resting her hand*, and niade it possihle for Lady Hilda to ? laugh at the notion that any lamb of. ordi nary spirit would really feel it quite dero gatory to lie down by such a lion's side. . - Claude had fully intended to bring matters to a head that evening, but. after, this unfortunate stirring of a painful memory he felt the occasion to be un pro- pitious. ?.':..,?' Meanwhile Sir Harry was working hard to bring about hj foul means what Claude was trying to accomplish by fair. His scheme was a daring and dangerous one, and he determined to keep it profoundly secret, even from his lady-mothe*. ;,'? . . J On arriving in town, his first destination was the well-known print shop of Messrs. Tombs and Co., in Pall Mall, who are re puted to have the most complete set of en gravings after the works of .Sir. Joshua; Reynolds in the world. He had but to state his requirements, and in due course w&S; unearthed from their portfolios a fine full' length copy of the very picture he had seen the night before at Framley Butts j en-, graved in mezzotint by one ' Fisher, at the Golden Head, in Lincoln Fields?f Ujanesi-, tatingly possessing himself of this at,; it must be confessed, a somewhat exorbitant; price, he chartered a hansom and bore it off to the shop of Mr. and Mrs. Alibi, 'the well-known theatrical costumiers. With this lady and gentleman he spent -th'e- whole morning in deep consultation, critically examining the Lady Btetty'sV garments, headdress, and jewellery, and finally submitting hia august person i.o ^ scientific and thorough application of fftie yard measure. He then left with the strictest injunctions to spate no troabte'Ot ; expense so as to have everything ready £or trying on Jthe following day. ? ? . Slight, fair, and smoothly shav6n\ toough the horsey young baronet was,, he' did not fail . when, ot\\. the WednesiEltajj', arrayed in these fine feathers, he regarded himself in the full-length mirrors at the rear of the establishment in Coventry* street, to draw a most unflattering bom parison between his own hard, cruel eyes, and full Sensual lips, and the frank, .clear look of the lovely Lady Betty, Whodi he was striving to personate. Biit Sir Hairy was an adept at casting aside any s6nli^ mental feelings, and, as the contrast forced upon him what he had lost arid ; could never regain, he laughed the idea savagely' out of court. ? Turning to Mrs. Alibi, he expressed him self completely satisfied with the trans formation brought about by her. and her husband, and ordered the finishing touches to be put, and the dress, wig, and the sham jewellery to be ready packed for him to take away on the following afternoon. The next day being Christmas Eve, Sir Harry put in his appearance at the dinner table at Framley Butts. As a penalty of his rank he found, himself, somewhat to his disgust, handed over to the tender mercies of. Lady Flinders, whilst Lady Hilda sat far down the table under, the wing of Claude Brathwaite. Bitterly, he cursed Ilia misfortune as he recog nised, even at that distance, the easy terms, upon which they seemed to be, and his poor hostess, who could get nothing but the curtest of replies .to her good-natured platitudes, came to the conclusion that %e was a very disagreeable young man indeed. He was consumed by jealousy and anger as he admitted to himself the unmis takable advance that his rival had made in , his absence. By the end of dinner he felt that there was no time to be lost—- the moment for determined action had arrived. The pictures at Framley Butts; Were hung in a long central gallery on the firBt floor. From each side of this galler^ branched off numerous passages leading to the more important bedroom suites, ?:?'_? ?--.'. On this particular evening, Claude, whosa room, was situated in one of the; corridors on the north side, had gone1 up. to Lord Ernest Brandon's room, which lay on ^ the south side of the gallery, to have a smoke and quiet chat. They sat late recalling old 'varsity times, and it was Hot before a^Ld? Slight that Claude set etf to finiiais-''©^^ room. The ends of the cprri;3or« ???#&~e*l?' tjiey abutted oh the gallery ^e^l:d^e^i with heavy curtains.

A second glance, how ^v^i relieved this momentary suspicion, fojr;lie saw that the hair was dressed in a &jr;%nsr foreign to any young lady of his 'AMiiainfcance. From its movements it was e^dent that the ey«s belonging to it, which hejcould not distinguish, were occupied in aspiring themselves that all was still. Evidently satisfied with the look of things, 7tifi;^iiead:Was soon followed by a body iciothed in dress and. jewels of unusual and dazzling beauty, though of archaic pat^ t|i*cu. Straightening herself up, the lady .glided quietly into the moonlight, gently pulling to the door* of Sir Harry *s room. Siie: stood still for a moment, as though listening intently j and Claude then noticed, to his further amazement, that the dress was precisely that of the picture he h.aC lately examined with such cafe, with t^ie great diamond earrings and the great emerald brooch, all complete. It was, with 90 doubt, the ghost of the Lady Betty. '.Terrified at the sight, Claude felt a hor rible fascination which dtew him to look on- the ghostly lady's face — and then he 'knew all. ; At the first moment he had thought that he had. come upon a scandal ; at the second he fcad* been convinced that he beheld an apparition ; and now he knew that he had surpfise.4 Sir Harry. V His. first impulse -was to fly at his rival /and. wring his nefarious intentions from h'i'm, but a caution restrained his hand long enough for him to realise that more might be gained by awaiting developments. ??;. Close to the great picture of « the Lady Btitty, which hung upon the north side, .fa4 a small alcove, partially curtained off from the. gallery. Into this, after a moment's pause, Claude saw Sir Harry make his way. : :?_'-, jdELecognising his opportunity, Claude at Ojice slipped noiselessly across the thick Carpet-of the gallery, and, without attract iftgattention, gained the door of Sir Harry's room. His mind was* now fully made up aS to his course of action^ and he swore to himself he would not spare his rival the JtHtjterest disgrace it was in his power, to i ?'bring upon him. ? ?^Quietly, extracting the bey from the iaside of the door he peeped out to make JCertain that the masquerader wa3 still en^ 'sconced in his alcove. -;As a matter of fact Sir Harry was standing well back in the recess, intently wajching an opposite boudoir, from which he, knew, the Lady Hilda would soon eilierge. Here he knew she nightly carried ©n^a dressing-gown chat over the affairs of ti« preceding day with a bosom friend. Hiis plans had naturally been laid with the utmost care. ? Claude then , finding that the masquerader -jTTP&s; well out of the way, slipped from the rciom, hastily inserted the key on the out side, and, closing^ the door, turned it easily a%xl noiselessly in the lock. He then -|pietiy, wiihdrew it, and gained, without 'observation, the curtain which guarded the corridor leading, to his own room. Here lie paused to consider whether or not he should remain and gloat over the torture an4 despair of his rival when he should find himself barred from his room, and adrift in a strange house in such terribly .Compromising attire. ?- Sir Harry's proposed line of action was of course by this time perfectly clear to Claude. It was, as has been said, notor ious that Lady Hilda was in 'the habit of gpssippikg till psst midnight in the bou doir marked 17, a fact which was usually cast in his daughter's teeth by the Marquis On her late arrival at the breakfast table. And it was abundantly evident 1 hat it was Sir Harry's intention to watch for her, per sonate the ghost, even to the extremity of kissing her, and on the first opportunity in the morning offer her his hand and, what he was pleased to call, his heart. He evidently trusted to his luck and her memory of the family tradition to obtain -him a favorable reception. ^Claude, then, having roughly realised that this was Sir Harry's plan of campaign was at first inclined to let things take 'their course. He would allow his rival to pave the way for a proposal of marriage in the morning, and then contrive that Claude Brathwaite should step in where Sir Harry Penniless had so carefully made preparation. The idea of making his rival a catspaw was really very tempting. ,A moment's consideration, however, «hbwed.him that this would not do at alL In- the first place, it would be too much of a toss up who would have the first opportunity in the morning ; and, in the second place, he had put a bar to the smooth, working or things by locking Sir -Harry but of his room. Besides this, of c&urse;, his chivalry would not permit him to ; stand- by and see his lady love half frightened out of her wits by the appari tion, not to mention the impossibility of Wfcaflding by and seeing Lady Hilda's fair -cheek polluted by the Mss of his hated iiiyal.- ..' ? '''?No, indeed ; this he felt was out of the question. Probably the best and simplest ithing that would be to fetch Ernest Bran ^doh and confront him with his would-be brother-in-law in his bizarre and ^comprbmLsing dress. The difficulty iwas t6'? get ^across the gallery with wut ??- j Qb«ervatiott.

V Claude now found himself standing in the middle of the gallery, uncertain 'what next to do, and realisins: that his rival, en sconced in the alcove, must know that his scheme was discovered. Should h-& rouse the house, or should he have it out with Sir Harry alone? * No; Kd made up his mind that, now that Lady Hilda was out of the way, he would carry out hid first in tention. He set off accordingly f ot Lord Ernest's room. ' Him he found in shirt and trousers, nearly reafly for bed. He hur riedly £o Id Iritn what had occurred, and, each taking a stick, they together sallied out to confront the wretched masquerader, whom Ernest Brandon hated just about as much as did his friend. The heat of his indigna tion may be easily imagined, and he vowed dire vengeance against the despic able creature who proposed to make so outrageous a return to his father's hospi tality. As they reached the gallery and threw aside the curtaan, the first sight that caught their- attention Was ridiculous in the extreme. There before them in ' the moonlight, was this gorgeously dressed creature, with, brocaded skirts, pulled high i for greater coiryenience, kicking with ! might and main fcfc the locked and un | yielding door -£ his bedroom. The sight ' was so ludicrous that they could not for the moment restrain their merriment, and they stood watching him like two cats gloating over their helpless prey. Sir j Harry heard them, and turned found. Poor | wretch, what a ghastly whiteness his face showed in the moonlight ! There was a gleam of desperate madness in his eyes. j With an appalling, scream he rushed head' long away across the gallery, and disap peared behind the 'curtains of one of the j corridors. In a ijflomeiit Brandon and | Brathwaite were in 'full cry in hia rear. As they gained the entrance to the corridor, he had nearly reached its end, and they | were but just in tinie tQ see him open a ! door and disappear for the second time. As ? they reached this point the door was banged in their faces, and the key on the inside was turned in the lock with a sharp crack. ' I. ' Well,' said^CEifnest Brandon, . «* we've run the devil to earth this time.' The words were hardly cut of his mouth when a sharp report rang through the stillness of the night. The two friends looked at one another in dismay. There was the fail of a heavy body in the room, a shriek, and a hollow groan. « My God, Brathwait©,' said Ernest, ' the poor devil's shot himself. Here, quick ; put your back against the wall, and kick the door in.' The panels of the heavy door groaned, the lock cracked, and* the door flew open on its hinged. Just heaven ! what a eight it was that met their eyes. There, fallen in a ghastly heap upon the floor, decked out in all his grotesque finery, the flaxen wig fallen back f rbm his livid face, crouched Sir Harry Penniless, with parted Jips and fast-glazing eyes. His hand was over hia heart, and through thei twitching fingers ooze^d on the BilSen cordet the dull red blood. And the moon through the window looked down unblinking on the sickening sight. Beyond, within the curtains of a great carved bedstead, the ghastly, terrified face, illuminated by a reading-lamp which stood at the bedside, sat up an old, gaunt figure in laced and broidered linen. Its right hand grasped and held in front a pistol, from the muzzle of which still curled a line of blue and wavering smoke. In its left hand was grasped a bell-rope, at Which it tugged un ! ceasiugly. — I At a glance th© fall meaning of the I sight was ^biit too apparent. Sir Harry i Penniless was fast journeying to the i spirit i realms to hi in© ghostly Brandon's \- bridegroom, and it was the hand of Lady Penniless that had dispatched him there. A. bloody bride the Lady Betty is j A bloody bridegroom ishe has got* I wts. No more she'll wandef under mortal skies, For, lo I a t|too&y;^^^ dies.
