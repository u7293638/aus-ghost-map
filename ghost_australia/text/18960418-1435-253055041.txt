Then even paler turned that villain's face, and half unconsciously he. mattered, " Oh, Lord,' I'm lost ! She has got the muffler off froiriher mouth." At the same instant the negro cabin steward, who had for the last five years sailed in the ship, rushed up from below, and while the white of his big eyes rolled to and fro in fear, he shouted to the captain :— " Oh, inassacap'n!—oh, Massa Gap'n Bowline, there's a ghostess down below! I've heard her scream, an' I've seen her face, an' it's jist all the same as Mrs. Edmiston!" "Curses on your head, you black scoundrel!" shouted the red-haired stranger. " It is not her!" And as he sprang from the rigging toward the negro, the villain slipped and fell upon the deck. At the same moment a sea swept on board, /for an instant drenching him and completely hiding him from new as it dashed him ag»inst the inside of the opposite bulwarks. When he again' arose, there was indeed a transmogrification in his appearance. His head, which a' moment before was covered with long. red,', bushy hair, was now bare as the deck below him, his chin and fiicej" which' Tisid" Tieeif covered iwith a shaggy pair of .whiskers, twys smooth and: beardless. The sea op* fall had broken the fastenings of his wig and false beard, and hie now stood uncovered in his villainy; " Blast .my eyes if there ain't something wrong gpin' on here. You said you saw a ghost down below that looked just like Mrs. Edmiston, Jake." " Yes, massa 1 cap'n, I -did • see ghostess, audi hear uni holler, an' 'twas jist all the same as Missy Edmiston " Here, Mr. Brace;'' shouted the captain, " look out for tlje ship ! I'm going below, .a, minute jfco-unreere- Jthis.,Jbis mystery., Thera is^opie^fojil work on here! |]i00| ^fl man twit's l^n jailing mnjer msecolo: * j'bu^tay •pn oecM, thtiH come u]_ I don't like to see met) iffeflfed^to ^Ww the.<cok& > 6f their iliair -ttnd* the«iflut?bf their jib!

As the captain said this, he go below, first handing his Mr. Brace, who had come afl bim in the watch; but thejw less strapger nuhed to $ way at the same time, " Oh, 4on't tar ;to see"h^r, (»plain "I I can in take care of hen J: wia^mgliferieieC a little—bui,^™.^. ^,,,^ " Stay stajJ^n Slek til I come' upfagaio, I.iell ye:i I'mdaptiain here, andl do&Mifc; % ,*ut jpfc down out of that Brace get some spare rigging - in your hand, I mean to tow that fellow into port: blast my eyes if he shall sail in tliii ship ! O you nigger, come.down out ofthat.rigging!" But the wretch, instead of coming down, still clambered up higher, and was now clinging to the shrouds, ' under the top-rim, and, as he paused.there, he begged for mercy. " Oh, yes ; you wouldj like to take care of your p6or sister, wouldn't you ? Now do you just come right down from aloft, there, before 1 send up after, you," shouted the enraged captain ; then turning to Brace, he added :— " Who do you think that rascal's poor, crazy sister is, Mr. Brace ?":.< " Why ! I haven't the remotest idea, Cap'n, only I think he's a lying shark, that is all." " Well, Brace, it ain't nobody but our own Mrs. Edmiston, that infernal pirate has been trying to Smuggle off England for tlie black-hearted Lord Hawkhurst J" " What ? Mrs. Edmiston. O you shark! Come down from aloft, and let me overhaul your worm- eaten log of a hull." " Take a hand with you, and go up and help him down," said the captain. To this order, Brace gave hasty obedience. . The stranger was, for a landsman, in a fearful situation. He was clinging to. the shrouds, and »s the vessel reeled to and fro in he Jheavy sea-way, he was swinging one moment ow\tbe lilack waves, the next, over the deck of the Bhip, and death would follow; his tall in either case, if he struck inside or outside the ship. As Brace and oue of the orew.started up the rigging, the unhappy man attempted to crawl up over the toprim, but just as his hands had clutched the rail that ran arotind the top, a heavy sea struck tbri'''ship/ and War' feet slipped from the $hrouds,' and fora moment be swung helplessly in , -the'' air: clinging onlj with hife hands. .0, how hopeless arid agonising was' tisdown-; ward glance as 'he'. saW thai his liour';hadi come.

And sad, oh how sad was the meeting four months afterwards, of the pale and still feeble Edmiston and his wife, when the " Ruth" once more dropped anchor in Boston Harbor. Yet, when the twain told each other their trials ahd troubles,, they gratefully knelt themselves down unto their Heavenly Father and offered up a hearty thanksgiving to Him for their preservation from such dangers. And when the father, the brave, stern man, wept bitterly for nis lost son, that Christian .mother sadly but meekly said:— . ... ... '> God's holy will be done I Let us not mnrmuf! He has left us one, our own dear, dear Lettie : let us so rear and educate, her, that she will not only be our comfort and pride, but a blessing to the world' in which God has been pleased , to place her." Then he checked the heart-dew which gushed from his sorrowing eyes, while calmness aiid smiles returned to, him, he kissed the blessed treasure -which was linked to his heart. No richer treasure could be given to man on earth. A pure, fond, tender, sympathising, christian wife. It was the day subsequent to the death of Robert Champ, the pirate, which we described in our fourteenth chapter! In front of the house which hacl so lately beep occupied, the flag of the Sea King; wared from its usual staff, but it was lialf-mfl8t ; i s counterpart at the peak of the brig at anchor in the bay was likewise half-mast, as were also thfe flags of the smaller proas which lay in the harbor. The siih had just risen and shone brightly from a cloudless $ky. upon the beautiful 1 fepot,which we Lave before described. Preparations art being made the pirates to bujy their chiefin Saccordance 'with, his last wish. The .vessels ' were prepared for Sea, and their boats had; landed a portion of their crews to bear and the body, to' the ,brig. It; xvas a .strange sight to see '6 searrbbber thus buried with all the care and ceremony tyMbh Sroiild ^attetti' the entombment of .jBi'^wfflli'.fcng^'jit wfts st^angfe 'to see a: pro^easiop formed "of,. yoiip^i ; dresB^-ih ; %hite,with basketeof iflowers in' their hiindB, yet' it was soj, and wheti • Ji" TTU-L --iii.* ••MIU&X;*—iu ! 6fit! "of ,g6 which we, have described, was brought forth,' borne by; the chief officers of tiie band, headed by B e r t r a m . : t h e s e littlej children wiflfeea^slowly in front of the Wdy' to 'the boat; scattering flowers ari i'^oir, eweet In'slow. and'^noistired ;Steps.<. .:All' tWs 'Wlai^ ei<^edingly sttange,' yeti it. showed ^fei 1 stittti' 'bf^dl^te^xiiid^lp^lilg' to j^I^h^^lDPQi, thpug^ ^olii 'and vricSt^'Cf^diril^^ h^ had autVoril settled home for his crews, in '^^ing wivesi a»di< ihomes. and drawinK around echoes over the calm bay; which wag' barely rippled by a soft land-breeze. After the salute had been fired, the seamen sprang aloft, the brig's sails were loosened, and she, followed by all the smaller vessels, gracefully glided out of the harbor. That day, when the red sun stood at meridian, the brig was hove to in the blue waters of the' Mozambique Channel. The other vessels were hove to close alongside of her, and while another slow and solemn salute of the minute-guns was fired, the body of the Sea King, weighed down. even as he had desired, with gold, ;Miripfd"o£ jdwtqwith which seamen iargrt®??^!!'!?"^ was com_ mitted to the fathomless deep. No prayer was said t)ver it—they were not men of prayer wlio buried him. The burial over, the vessels again returned to their anchorage. It was midnight. In the same room where the pirate chief had died, sat young Bertram, his successor. In his hind the young man held the minature which had been given him by the dying chief, and which he supposed to be the likeness of his father, because it so much resembled himself. But hi6 gaze was fixed on a journal before him ; the book to which Champ in hi6 dying moments alluded. It was a diary of his life. One entry in this book had met the eye of .Bertram, and again did he peruse it. As he read it he murmured to himself :— "Oh, can it be that my father yet lives ? Have, I a mother? .Ij who.have never known the kind dare of either.? It ie here written that I am the son of an English lord ; that t was torn from my mothers arms in my third year. I remember nothing about it; I have been with the band ever since I can retoofiect myself : and if now l hav^, a father—« mother—my life and my calling will forever bar me trom them^ tot am1 not at war with all the World ? Is not all the world at war witii me—and if they live, are they not of the, world ?• This miniature was huug around my neck % this braid ;of dark brown hair, when I was torn .from my mo'ther's sidp ! , Where could Aave iny father tave been 7,, He is not mentioned in connection with that event.

After tliey iw^re all assembled, 'the yoiithfulJe^er ,ptepj>ed forth iipon the portico wlwhf ftpnj^id J^e house, and as he appealed £lad shouts -grdeted tiixdi " I,-thfitkk.yoir Tor ! .^pti^^'^n^t^;'' fi^id Kef ^.fiH® I'i^w^^^lp^fl^my lin^; i W^Uiyoa , * fAy, we • will ; li"; was itlie general response. \ ... ; : ' >» " 'it'M *
