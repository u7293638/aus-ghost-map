It was past 6 o'clock, an angry-looking, ? stormy afternoon.- I was riding up a valley through the hills to the west, in the teeth" d£ the wind which was blowing big brown' clouds over the high ridge of me mountains mrough the gap in which. Iho sunh&cl; gone down, ^.desolate littlela&ejholf-amothered; by rushes, fills up the lower end of the valley through which my road went. It was black with the small waves that the wind had whipped all over it, and the nearer hniw hid it from the yellow light that was still flow ing in a long stream over the shoulder of the Forna. The narrow bohireen on which I was travelling was squeezed close in between the lake- Lough Clurej its name is-the Btaep, up-springing sides of a f urzy hill that rose nearly sheer out of the water. I remem ber the thought striking me that this was just the Bort of time one might expect to meet the Black Hound that the oountry people say lives in Lough Glure. Tb.cy say he comes up now and then, dark and dripping out of the water, and on whoever he lays his paw there comes a black sickness like the plague, and no one has ever recovered from it. But one cannot believe all their stories. A little boy riding on a donkey met me ; a gray ghost of a donkey, and a little boy who looked in the twilight as ghostly as his jack ast. He bobbed hu head to me as he passed, but I did not take any notice of him. I was jogging steadily on, with the rent, which had been paid me in veiy small coin, clinking in my pookets. My thoughts were back in. Paris. This was a good-for-nothing, colour' ; less Hfel was living-no profession, no hopes, no future. I wish thei^e had never been any idea ofjpudqpg a prieBt of me. It was an un lucky tiling, somehow, I had gone back of a resolve of that kind. I could not shake off a superstitious feeling that doing go brought some blight over my life, 'My God! Look at that little -dog!' . This from the donkey-boy whom I had just passed blended with a yell from 9 dog. I looked round; the bqy.was off hia donkey, atooplng over something in the road.

However, ai time there was nothing for me to do but ait etill, and it was just three weeks later that I was told one morning tha t awomim was at the door wantingto epeak to. me.

There was hardly a touch of white in the- blue s¥y that April morning. Very high up there was a lark singing; in the lower levels oftheairployer were wheeling and whistling; the wind kronght the soft spring musio of the bleat ing of lambs to me in purring waves of sound. It shook the f usohsia hedge that was .sprout- . ing at the foot of the jgardenand ibroughtthe crisp sheaths of the elin-tree budB fluttering down onto thegrou&d;^ -. I suppose I noticed these things then, or I should not be able to feW them: so«leariy now-but I do not rembniber doing so. I stared atthe purple mark oit my right hand where the wound made by the dog's "teeth had been. It was too Late now for any of the ordinary rough-and-ready cures; and the probability seemed to be that as I bad kept well up to this, nothing was going to happen to me and Ineed take no precautionary measures. Indeed, only for the cows I don't believe I would have thought twice about it, but their dying certainly gave me a bit of a shake; and the talk I had with the dispen sary doctor not long ago about this M. Pas teur's cure for hydrophobia recurred to mo (though, to teU the truth, little Considine said he had not such great opinion of it) and I had been feeling unsettled and restless for some time ; in fact, putting one thing and another together, I thought the best thing I could do was to start off for Paris as soon as I could. J do not mean to pretend thatlhador have much faith. in this system of PaBteur's. I had heard only very little of it from Dr. CJen sidine, andhad read shout as much in the newspapers, and I 'think I am not disposed to believe new things very readily.

' I -would like to know what reason they hare for Baying that. I cannot even he sore if it was Shaun or the mad dog that bit me, and, ,anyhow, I came aB Boon as I could. _ T-hey tell me I mast go to them twice,' mornings and evenings, but I will not. K they cannot- -. get enough poison into me once in a day they will have to be content to let me be a decimal on the wrong side of their average of cures. Dr. CJonsidine told me it was only once aday they injected the staff-' and quite often enough, too,' he said, and he is a smart little man and knows what lio is talking about, T. am not going to have anything to say to their ' intensive treatment,' and so I told them-I more than half think I was a fool for coming at all. Paris is not what I remember it, and ? T «m very lonesome herewith no one to speak Yegterday morning was my first visit to M. Pasteur'b, and I wentfthere again to-day. It is a ourious place, and they are a funny crew of people that you see there, from every nation on the earth, all waiting to have what you would think was worse than death put into their veinB for the sake of getting fife out of it. I could not help wondering for how many of them the bargain would turn out successfully. There was a strange-looking girl got into the same tram as I did when I was leaving the Pantheon yesterday. She had mow soft, grayish-yellow hair than she knew what to do with. It was wound in big wisps over her head like ropes of bay-«soogawns'we call them at home-and her eyes looked like well* of some pale yellow-green oil. Icouldnofc get her face out of my mind last night, while that fellow kept me awake with his fiddling. I wished he was dead, with his dirges. This morning I met that girl again. This time I was in the Rue d'TJlm, juBt leaving the Eoole Normale after my daily dose-of poison. She looked very, hard at me. I won der if she recognized my white face and foxy ta,"e*ta- Aran 12tib. I never used to be much of a one to keep ® ? diary, hut now, it seems, L have'taken a new turn. Perhaps it is what the -old women, call the change before death:(tfaoughI don't Jp»" lieve I'm going to die atall). The night be«' fore last-just after. I had made £helast«atay -the fiddling began again, woraethanever wyeaming, and ciyinglike eOme creature in mortal pain. I was cross and tired, a^d.1 could HOt*tftndfit. A rang for Unfa*#* m vain, Midfinally Ileftmy ioom^and making^ my way upfche steep stairs to the next itag*i Itaooked at.thedoor ofthfimuiedinan. ? An inner door opened and shut, And then the door, I was at opened* veir littto. % - ' j ask pardon, monsieur,' I began, * buti am an invalid,. and your .-violin prevents mo ? from sleeping.' , The door was opened more widely,>ndl 1 heard fin exclamation in a .wobuh'4 voice.'-5 The gas in the towage hadheen pot otifc and ; the lamp in theroom behiiid her did inot jarivie iukoh light, but wife ev*n lew IshouH ttUl have recognized the girl with ihe yellow ntv.' ( I regret that I have disturbed you> mon sieur,' she said ur French, with- a certain; soft foreign accent that puzzled me aa to her nationality. ' I am also an mvaud -^she laughed a little-'but with me it is different -my violin helps me to sleep.' f .. She turned and spoke to some one in the innroom in a language which I.haduever heard before. An oldish woman came for ward with the lamp in her handi < Eado, hold the light thatmonsieur may doacendthese charming stairs in safety, ' said the girl in French ; 4 ion toir, montifur.' She went into the inner room, slamming the ddor KAind her, and the servant stood with the lamp outside at the head of the stairs until I had turned down the corridor to my own . room. What she had meant by saying that infer nal fiddling sent her to sleep, I cotda,not imagine. I like music well enough at a proper " time, and as far as I oould jndgfen&e; played remarkably well; but at 1 o'clock -px the morning to be kept aWake by scroatns, and lamentations like an old woman kefening at a funeral was mow than I oould stand. -v And why had she laughed P Altogether she was a curious girl, and Iwondereaifl should meet her again out of doors jiexfc morn 'illg,;^ .k I looked out foir her in the Roe d'TTliiv aWL at the omnibus bureau outsid e the Patitogm, where I had seen her before. I thought it likely that shfevwas taking lessons Sn;ittomo, or the likfe, from some oSthe many who live thereabouts. But I did jot sfee her. I Bfcrolled oil down the Stue duPanuieon^ feeling very "low m my mind. The flocror? Had been abusing me fer not coming to them before, if they cannot cgre me wilh oM d& depressed ana side. _ I looked in at the shop window ag Ipassea. Mid dull they were, too.

She lifted the pale-yellow ladies that half concealed her eyes. ' No, monsieur; tho charm I had worked; I slept well.' I wondered in my own mind what 6he meant by this, but I did not like to ask it. She had turned to study the pamphlet again ; I saw it i was one by a celebrated French doctor on 'La Rage,' and I felt, naturally, a sort of personal curiosity as to why she was reading ' Mademoiselle is interested in that subject?' I began again. She turned upon me with a kiad of defiacne. ' And why should I not beP' she replied a little oxoitedly, but there was a hunted fright* ened look in her face. ' Is not every one talk ing of la rage now P You-you yourself seem to be interested in this illness, or else why do you go daily to If Pasteur's ?' She said this still with a gay manner, but she watched closely for my answer. ' I am one of his patients, mademoilselle,' I answered. All the laughter left her face. She got very white. ' And so am I also,' she said 6lowly, as if the words were forced out of her, her big eyes wide open, and looking as if a light had sud denly gone out behind them as she stared into my face. APRIL 17th. The more I see of her, the more she per plexes me, and the more I think of he. In deed, I keep thinking of very little else these times, and I try to clear my head by writing as much down as I can. .

Indeed, long after she had ceae »d, I had l»»'n awake tossing and thinking, think* ing 'There are some nights,' she Went on quickly, with fee scared white look coming into her face which I had seen in it before, .when I must play: then I cannot hear the sound of its f set galloping softly toWardme, and its pantings.

Her right hand was lying on the table, un gloved ; my eyes followed hers to the. purple mark of the now healed "wound.

It was more than I could stand to sifc'there and watch her. I got up and walked around the table and. Bat down by her side.

She handed me tjte' cup and I raised it to my Hps, but as I tried to drink there came a spasm in my throat, and £ felt I could not swallow. It frightened me, but I said nothing, and we sat for a long time talking and making plans of what ye would do when we were married. Every mo ment that I was near her, every stir ofher hand in mine, every touch of her soft oheek as she leaned her head on my shoulder, sent a rush through my veins of keen love and desire to live, and even then I was beginning to know that it was a mockery for me to talk of the future. She saw that I had not drunk my tea. 'I will give you more,' Bhe said, 'mis ifi cold.' She gave it to me, and when she did not see, I tried again to drink it; and again the spasm and the rigid contraction of all the muscles in my throat. So X told her I did not care for it; and I said good-night to her ; that it was late. God knows I have much to do, and I had much to do before I could sleep, but I shall sleep sound enough when it is done. I kissed her twice, three times, as a dying man kisses a crucifix, but to me those losses brought no hope. It is nearly midnight, and ihnust stop. I leave her to God--inay! h^'havfe mercy on my soul. . BIEBCE Cqekac. * . ?".<*; <3 >._! Yv' j r; '¥ V7T * ExlraitJrotn ' Lc Soir,J^pqil26.
