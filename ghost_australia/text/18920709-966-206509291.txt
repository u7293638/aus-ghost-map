THE MISER'S GHOST. A clergyman, detained late one night, at a friend's house, accepted, unhesitatingly, the offer of sleeping accommodation in the only disengaged 100m—the hauntedchamber. Now, as the reverend gentleman made it a practice never to travel ever so short a distance without some abstruse theological work in his pocket for perusal at odd •moments, it is not surprising that on this occasion he sat up till after the witching hour; indeed, it was nearly 1 o'clock a.m. when, in a complete but threadbare mediaeval suit, the vapoury spirit of yet another miser—a skinflint ancestor of the clergyman's host—appeared bsfore him, whom the readywitted parson at once interviewed somewhat as follows—" Pardon me, sir, you are, doubtless, a resident in this neighbourhood?" "I am !" replied the somewhat flabby phautom in Fejmlcbral tones. " Ah : just so. fou live, if 1 may be allov.ed the expression, in this house —have done so, in fac-t, for some time past?" "Three hundred years." "Dear me! you don't say so?" "I do." "And have subscribed. naturally, to many local charities— eh '!'' " Devil a bit," said the skinflint's ghost, clutching the bag of sovereigns he carried more closely to his bony sides; " devil a bit, sir." " Well, then," replied the cleric, ' you'll pardon my saying so, I know, but don't you think it's about time you did?" And with thi6 he politely presented a subscription-list for he renovation of the parish church. "You will see," he went on, " I have here the names f some of the most influential" He could proceed no further. The smell of sulphur was simply unbearable, and the miser's ghost was laid for ever. The room has since been con- verted into a nursery.— Irving Montague.
