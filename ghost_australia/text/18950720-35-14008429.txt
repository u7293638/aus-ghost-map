An announcement having been made that there would be a special meeting of the general committee formed to secure the return of Sir Henry Parkes, it was accepted by many who were not supporters of the candidate as an intimation that he would make a speech, and in the expectation that the speech would be of a rasping character fully 300 electors and others assembled at noon } yesterday at Vickery's Chambers, Pitt-street This gathering embraced the general committee and many others Amongst the supporters of Sir Henry Ayers Dr. W. Edward Warren, the Hons. John Davies, O M.G., C. J. Roberts, O.M.G., and W. J. Trickett, Ms.L.C., Mr Donald Manson, Mr. J. M. Conroy, and Mr Oscar Meyer Sir Henry Parkes came into the room a few minutes after 12 o'clock, and was received with loud cheers Sir Henry Parkes, after remaining seated for a few minutes rose, and was received with renewed cheering He said -Mr Chairman and gentle- men's am here with much regret that some interruption should have taken place in your proceedings I will not say a single word as to the cause of that interruption. (Here Sir Henry paused for a considerable time ) I in here Air Chairman and gentleman, to give you all the help I can in what I believe is a contest more full of interest and benefit to this country than any I ever engaged in in all my long life (Cheers ) who persons who say I have turned round are simply scandalous slaves I hold the same opinions now that I hold as a young man when I first entered the Legislature, but I hold them with the matured thoughts of a long life and with them enlightened, as it were, by my experience of a difficult road But I have done more-and it is the last time I shall refer to myself than the persons who are libelling me could do if they lived a thousand yeara-(cheers)-if all their efforts were united-in advancing popular principles and popular idea in this country (Cheers ) I was filled with a consuming belief when I was a young man that as time advanced, as the country developed, as the native born increased, a feeling of pure and genuine patriotism would spring up and especially when I saw our University founded, with its colleges with its grammar schools, and when I saw the beneficent system of public school instruction spread through the land-(cheers)-I thought these great advantages, which our fathers never enjoyed, would give us a no er generation so enlightened, so full of public spirit, so disinterested, that it would be superior to any attack upon the institutions of the country which I, among others, have done so much to acquire (Cheers ) I believe in a true democracy I believe in a democracy which would result in sending its best, its most fitted, its most gifted, citizens to govern the country (Applause ") It is because I believe we should only have one aristocracy-that an aristocracy of mental gifts and personal worth, which would ward off ruffianly hands that are aiming at the very heart of our public liberty-that I throw myself into this contest (Cheers ) I have entered this contest because I believe the persons we are fighting, so far from being liberals, so far from being genuine freetraders, are simply persons who by mean, contemptible aims are ready to go to any extreme, in any direction, not to benefit any class of the people but to gratify r the foulest and dirtiest of ambition (Cheers ). It is impossible for me to shut my eyes, or for any well-meaning man in the country to shut his eyes, to the infamous tactics resorted to (Applause ) What could be more infamous than the person who degrades the position of Prime Minister giving it forth to the world that there are vast sums of money behind me ? (Hear, hear ) I don't believe there is a bank in Sydney would pay £5 to save my life I don't believe I am working now with any sum of money to serve the legitimate purposes of this election in excess of the sum I have had for such a purpose at any other time The money passes through my hands in conjunction with another gentleman, and I don't believe the sum at our des posai-nistend of amounting to thousands has reached more than some £300 (Applause ) I believe this money has been honestly subscribed by-in some instances, at least persons who could ill afford it, in order to advance the cause with which I am identified, and that is the cause of the people of New South Wales their liberties which are in terrible danger and their prosperity in the future (Loud cheers ) I denounce this attempt on the part of the Prime Minister to furnish us with four dishonour as an infamous attempt to mislead the public by most in body and indefensible means (Applause ). The newspapers tell us that he stated that " if he were beaten for the King Division thought it was impossible for him to he beaten (Loud cheers laughter, and a voice " A good shot ") They tell us that he stated that " if he were beaten for the King Division 20 gentlemen were ready to resign their seats for him " (Laughter ) Where are the " 20 " gentlemen who hold seats ? (Hear hear ) There are only four I don't think Mr Ewing would resign his seat I don't think Mr Ferguson would resign his seat (A Voice " Not much ") I don't think Mr Sleath would he is a likely buffer to resign his seat for the Prime Minister Mr M Court will turn the tables over more than once before be resigns in favour of the Prime Minister Why, nearly all these gentlemen are smarting in private with a grievance against Mr Reid for being sent to the country so unnecessarily to waste their time and money without any possibility of doing any good If Mr Reid should be beaten-and he admits that is possible daughter and applause) he will find very few people who will be anxious to resign their seats for him (Hear, hear) They will think twice about it and they will want to know why he im- perished his own seat so foolishly I instance that as showing with what want of any foundation in reason and in fact he makes these wild statements Was it not unworthy of anyone unworthy of even a boy-to make a statement that " 26 members " were ready to rest go their seats when there were not at that time more than two who had seats to resign (Applause ) I mention that as a proof of what a thoughtless, Mustering vam gentleman this Prime Minister is (Applause ) We have committed the mistake of putting a very unfit man at the head of affairs At every step he takes by every sentiment he utters he shows how unfit and how unscrupulous he is and how prepared he is to resort the step L. have taken Surely I have said enough (Hear hear ) I have loved this country as warmly as any mail could love t (Hear hear ) I have laboured night and day for a lifetime to serve lU li ghost interests and Mr Reid himself has repeatedly said so (Hear hear 1 He has within the last few weeks repeatedly said so but then he added that I had done so much it was time I gave way to a younger man (Laughter ) Well men are not measured by years They are measured by strength they are measured by capacity to serve their fellow-men and, if we take that scale of accounting for here Mr Reid is a far older man than I (Applause ) If he had toiled as much as if he had gone through what I have gone through it would be impossible for his small brain to he accompanied by such a huge belly (Api lause and laughter ) I don t hesitate m speak- ing thus of him, because there is nothing too foul which he has not said or me As he began this personal quarrel ' (A Voice " Reid ') Before I was talked of as an opponent of his he and his gang of petty men announced a direct lyddite as an opponent to keep me out of Parliament at all, in the person of a gentleman of whom I don't wish to say much, but of whom I desire to pay for one thing that it was his character that deterred me from entering into a contract with him in this election I did not feel disposed to condescend to fight a person like Mr E M Clark, whom Mr Reid and his friends brought out, not be cause he could serve the country we all know that he cannot-not because he advocates any set of principles, to know he does not not because he has had any experience which would enable him to serve the country, and not because he can espouse any cause save his own paltry interest That was the man Mr Reid brought forward to keep me out of Parliament (A Voice " It's a shame " ) No, it was very becoming I have not done that, I have not brought out some tool to oppose him I am here myself (Loud cheers ). He told the hireling scribblers who wait upon him that he treated my opposition to him as an idle wind, that it could not affect him, and he would go in flung with a majority of 400 or -500 (A Voice " Will he a ") This is how he has been, ed in this contest all through He, despite the fact that he is the Prime Minister, has behaved himself in a worse way than any man deficient in pi maple that I ever saw engage in a great election before His wretched speeches contain nothing Examine them Not one principle is defined, not one question is vindicated, not one intelligent purpose is put forth (Applause ) Well, is it any wonder that I or any person who has done something for the country even if it be only the one-hundredth part of what I have done cannot stand idly by and leave this incapable man to put his (destroying hands upon the institutions which have been planted in this country by many men whose shoes he was noA or worthy to clean (Applause ) Have we not had in this country, besides Air Wentworth, Sir James Martin, Charles Cox, per, Sir John Robertson, and a large number of other men in measurably superior to Mr Reid in every respect ? ( applause ) If they were alive now they avoided hardly he able to find language sufficiently strong to lash the pretences of Mr Reid Another reason that induces me to present myself is to vindicate the work of those great men who have gone before us I have looked back and seen the grand and noble work which the men who are in their graves did And this pandered to the lowest classes comes before us and tries to discredit the past Take mayors for it that the man who in any case city tries to discredit the past is a man to be avoided in public and private life (Cheers ) The past of a country even with its errors w hen it has been adorned and illuminated by some of the great minds is a firmament where only the stars are visible to light us to the future (Applause ) And the man as he seeks to throw a sackcloth over the light produced by those who have gone before him is in mind and heart and nature a thoroughly unpatriotic and bad man. (Cheers J No wonder, then, I am willing to fight this contest out (Applause ). In my absence Air Reid has fought it very well for me. He could not have used his breath-is far as it has any effect more effectively in my case than he has done (Cheers ) But he will discover that there is too much common sense in the minds of the people of this country, too clear a conception of justice, too high in appreciation of the men who have gone before us and what they have done for us-for them to be led away (except the very inferior class of the country, by such an unfit time as Mr George Reid is (F. - thusiastic cheers y; ) I he members of the press now retired as a?
