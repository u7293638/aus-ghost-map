KIAMA. The traveller who has a weakness for mythology will be ready to admit that Kiama, like Delos, has risen from the ocean. And the sea in its fury makes wild but bootless attempts to regain dominion over the quiet, peaceful town. Neptune has in vain exhausted his resources. The hard granite rocks resist imperiously the savage onslaughts of the angry waves, and scornfully send back to the deep the bounding billows which leap furiously against the headlands. The municipal council have made vast strides in advancing local interests. The calm determination of the citizens to advance socially and morally tms lovely district is paiircea on every coun tenance. They reck not what the wild waves are saying the whole day long; and they seem quite indifferent to every measure and law which the pre sent Government have enacted or intend to enact for the purpose of improving the social standing of the people. Even the plebiscite proposed by the learned member for Reclfern has no attraction for the sturdy inhabitants of Kiama. They depend for success and prosperity on the industry and energy of the people, who have already shown what these qualities can effect. Dairies and creameries are as numerous as are the railway stations. If flocks and herds are a proof of prosperity, Illawarra is the most favoured district in Australia. Eight over the sea stand tho Catholic church, convent, and schools, the latter being under the care of the Sisters of St, Joseph. The Kiania Ghost no longer disturbs the peaceful and friendly relations which exist among all oroocls and classes. Percentage for Kiania school, 65.
