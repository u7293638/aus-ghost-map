LONDON TOWN TALK. I a - (FROM OUR OWN 0OBuE3r0NDE!iT.) LONDON, FEB. li.

It is printed rather veil, costs twopence, and is full of the most abstruse things. But the main intention of this admirable organ, so far as I can decipher it, is to prove we are all Jews In connexion with the anti-Semitic movement in German) this is really rather interesting It seems to me a morbid ambition to try to prove oneself a Hebrew when no one suspects it, but the idea is at least an original one Human endeavour has hitherto been all the other way. There is no fiction, properly so called, in the journal in question, but the facts elude one Admitting, for the purpose of getting on, that the Stone Kingdom predicted by the prophet Daniel in the British Empire I can I get on I find myself in another Stone Kingdom, the Great Pyramid of Egypt, of which there is a huge diagram, and every convenience for exploration I am told that " it is an inspired building, just as the Biblia an inspired book, and that there are a quantity of " facts inside of it Upon my word I am not exaggerating "God. caused the Great Pyramid to be built with these facts inside, me My brain reels and I clutch at an advertisement. as something real and tangible It is the prospectus of the " British Israel Identity) Corporation, who supply all works upon the identity (one would think this was a branch of our old friend Sir Rogers establishment in cabinets (here one gets mixed up with Maskelyne and Cooke at 2s One of the gentlemen who purvey them is the first identity quart) r In what epoch of humanity, I wonder, were Englishmen burnt alive, scraped to death, and otherwise put to inconvenience, for believing themselves to be the Lost T tribes of IBI all ' Upon the first rumour of their being found I remember Theodore Hook, so far from any idea of persecu- tion entering his mind, expressed an immense satisfaction "I have already borrowed BE much of the other tribes he said, "as they can be induced to lend me His idea was that a new era of accommodation bills was about to dawn upon him Among other publications advertised there is the Woihliudu Raiowned for the seven Iden lifications (price sixpence), in which it is established conclusively not only that the British are really lost Israel, but that America is identified with Manasseh This remarkable work, by the bye, I perceive by another advertisement, is given away by a furniture warehouseman to every purchaser of a chair, bedstead, or adjustable folding chair, which seems very convenient Here is your theological work in company with something comfortable to sit in and digest it at leisure But it certainly discloses an eye to business "The identity paper knife just the thing wanted, is also an advertisement which rather smacks of the nimble ninepence, and in connexion with thepiramidical secret is a little disappoint- ing Perhaps, however, these proofs of appreciation of the main chance are a part of the great design They suggest at least that it is not impossible that the Identity Corporation may be Jews Among the people to be pitied in the late show deluge actors occupy the first place , it was bad enough for playgoers, but they had at worst to stop at home The poor players had to get to their theatres somehow, and home again Miss Kate Santley, I read, being unable on that first (and worst) Tuesday to get either cab or carriage to take her to Drury Lane, hailed the driver of a Pickford van, and by blandishments and large as prevailed upon him to deliver her at her destination as heavy) goods A friend of mine described to me a moving appeal made by a theatrical manager to his scant) audience, which resulted in their hall taking back their money or accepting tickets for another night except three persons -a gentleman and two ladies, who sat imperturbably in their stable If it is hard to play to 30 people, it must be harder to play to only three, and the manager once more appeared before the curtain and besought the indnl gence of this remnant " Sir, ' replied the gentleman, "What you remark is full of good sense, but we live in a suburb Not a cab can be procured for love or money, and our brougham is ordered for 11 o'clock What are we to do in the meantime' The little party were invited behind the curtain, and passed a very pleasant evening The well intentioned efforts of the American Government to give us, at all events some measure of copyright, which English authors very gladly welcome upon the in one of half a loaf being better than no bread, Bland in danger of being nullified by the action of the Board of Trade An officer of that department who has the same advanced views concerning literary rights that Mr Biggar holds on land and Mr Tchx P)ut upon properly) ¡,enerall)-baa persuaded his chief to propose the following suggestion as a rider to the American offer - "That all Publish books published with the consent of their authors in the States shall be admitted into England and all parts of the Empire ' Under pretext of extending American literature and is merely a plan for destroying English cup) right The manufacturer is to be protected that is to say, the paper maker, the printer, and the binder , but the author to whom all these trades owe their being is to be swamped by dame editions That so mischievous a proposal should become law, because a pig in the Board of Trade has a maggot in his brain, is impossible, if public attention is once drawn to it, but there is danger lest this should really happen unless authors bestir themselves The underhand character of the plan may be gathered from not a word being said about the Tauchnit? editions of English authors-a precisely parallel case and a much easier one to state, if the Government official had the courage of his opinions he would at once propose the admission of Tauchmtz into England, but he knows that a scheme of robbery BO open as that would disgust everybody) The whole attempt shows his folly as well as his ingratitude, for it is plain he is incapable of thinking for himself, and where would he be without writers to think for him As for supposing that they would think for him for nothing, let him look at America, whose native authors, thanks to the non existence of international COD) right, may be counted on the hand But for the existence of copyright we should never have read Thomas Carlyle, for from the first he was dependent on his pen, and if the pirated editions of his works had been admitted into England he would have been at least impoverished With what happy adjectives he would have described this fledgling of the Board of Trade Pro- bably by the exact contour) of " an eternal vent) It is a theme I perceive, of general congratulation that this great genius should have reached so extreme a limit of human life To this doctrine I cannot subscribe It seems to me that Dickens and Thackeray and George Eliot had a better fate One cannot forget that in his later years Carlyle gave his vote for American slavery, and became more or less allied with aristocratic principles I prefer to think of him as the historian of the revolution, and the destroyer of shams and hypocrisies What vigour the man had what confidence in the right, what loathing of the false and the base, and yet what a noble tenderness and pity for human weakness underlies) it all in the matter of literary kleptomania plagiarism-there can be no doubt that Lord Beaconsfield stands facile princeps Even in Endymion half a dozen instances have been pointed out and sometimes with an innocent surprise that shows the discoverer is a very young critic Moreover his lordship always Steals from small people-Mortimer Collins, writers in the Sporting Magazine Kc for though he once took whole pages of the Edinburgh Review to swell one of his three volume novels, he did not know at the time he was filching from Macau) But the other day a still more curious example occurred of the love of literary theft for its own sake 'come scribe in the Whitehall Review has actual]) been stealing from Lord Desart novels Hellas confessed his crime, and in doing so is proved to have Borne merit besides penitence, name!), the gift of humour He fell into the error of copying his lordship s words, he says, through having been recently reading his lordships words to improve his style To pass to another class of performers who would think of a Band of Hope being in reality a band of juvenile brigands or a Sunday school a school for pickpockets' I dont mean to say that that has happened, but, what is quite as strange the Convalescent Hospital at W.eybridge has, it seems, been made use of by burglars as a convenient I

recognised Mr William Sykes and others affecting delicacy of constitution Imagine neuralgia with a crew bar, and the last lingering symptoms of bronchitis with a centre bit It is worth noting by the bye, that one disease which burglars must not have is asthma At Bournemouth the other day, Lady Feversham and her daughter heard someone breathing hard under the library table, who turned out to be

brutal wings with a 5 and a dash and ). But there must now be a new fount of type for bad words, and a slang dictionary for the use of the gallery I warned you some months ago that our French importation, vitriol throwing, would take the place of Aunt Sally among popular amusements, and it is already established amongst us When a member of the lower classes says to anyone he doesn't like, "I have got something for you, the latter, if he is wise at once turns his back and covers his face with his hands "In Paris, writes the French correspondent of one of the papers, " it is hardly safe for any one who has excited any feeling of rancour to go about, unless with a solu- tion of lime water and ammonia, which checks the action of vitriol I take the following from the current number of '1 Hills 'There lived, until a week ago, in the Royal Mews at Hampton court the widow and family of a former coachman in the Royal service His history was this - When quite a lad, while attending one day as groom, a phaeton in which the then Duke of Cumberland was driving the then Princess Victoria, the horses took fright and ran away, and but for the presence of mind of this youth, the consequences might have been calamitous The groom was warmly thanked at the time by the Royal personages, and was never forgotten by them Some time afterwards the King of Hanover, recognising the man in his place as coachman on one of the Royal carriage, went up and shook him cordially by the hand, assuring him at the same time that he had not forgotten that he had saved his (the King a) life Her Majesty gave this coachman when he retired from active work a set of apartments in the Royal Mews at Hampton Court There he died about a couple of years ago, and his widow petitioning to be allowed to continue to occupy the rooms, received permission to remain in them during Her Majesty a pleasure ' But the control of the apartments in the Royal Mews is unhappily now in the hands of an official (unlike the apartments in the Palace, of which her Majesty retains the patronage herself and it was Her Majesty) s pleasure,' as interpreted by certain officials, that the widow should receive summary notice to quit on the first of the present month, in order to make room for the coachman of the Princess Frederica, the grandchild of the King who told her husband that he had saved his life But neither Queen nor Princess, I feel well assured, knows of the ungracious act which has been committed in Her Majesty's name "
