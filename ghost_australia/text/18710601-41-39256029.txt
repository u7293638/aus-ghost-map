THE CASE 6F DOUGLAS/ TO THE EDITOR. '' Mrâ€” ipu will oi course allow me to reply. I don't know, how. 'Shakspeare's Ghost', gets bis living; but. if honestly, whit more rifftit has he in he anevrenaner AnrrAnvuident or meddle with public affairs than I nave? I reject his recommendation, and advise, him not again to degrade Shakspeare's im mortal lines on the quality of mercy. They! were addressed by Portia on behalf of an! unfortunate but upright insolvent,. and not] in interceding for the perpetrator 6i a' cowardly revolting murder. ? , .The Rev. Mr. Parsons, has made out no case in favour of Douglas, who it seems did, sit under his ministry, but did not profit by it, for he shortly afterwards committed murder. Mr. PatSGnVs description \\-f me as b^jng ' a pragmatical and egotistical individual will appear to any one reading his speech, on the trumpery precedency question as uncommonly ? like a case of the devil rebuking sin. , : Already an aspirant after Douglas's fame has appeared in the Police Court for ? threatening to serve his wife as Douglas served his, and Mr. Parsons had better keep his powder dry for the coming occurrence.
