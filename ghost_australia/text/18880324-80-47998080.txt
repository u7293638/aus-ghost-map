A Glass of Cold Water. Tha following ia the apostrophe upon " A Glass of Cold Water," by John B. Gough : Where is the liquor which God the Eternal brewed for all his children? Not in the simmering still,over smoky fires choked with poisonous gases, and surrounded with the stench of sickening odors and rank corrup- tions, doth your Father in heaven prepare the precious essence of life, the pure, cold water. But in the green glade and grassy dell where the red deer wanders.and the child loves to play; there God brews it. And down, low down in the loweBt valleys, where the fountains murmur and the rills ring; and high upon the tall mountain tops, where ike naked granite glitters like gold in the ann ; where the storm cloud broods, and the thunder storms crash ; and away far ont on the wide wild sea, where the hurricane bowie muaic and the big waves roar ; the chorus sweeping the march of God ; there ho brews it-that beverage of lifa and health giving water. And everywhere it is a thing ol beauty, gleaming in the dewdrop ; singing in the summer rain : shining in the ice gem til] the leaves all seem to turn to living jewels spreading a golden wall over the setting sun or a white gauze around the midnight moon Sporting in the cataract; sleeping in tin glacier ; dancing in the hail shower ; folding its blight snow curtains softly about thÂ« wintry world and weaving the many coloree iris, that seraph's zone of tbe sky, whosi warp is the raindrop of earth, whose woof i the sunbeam of heaven all checkered ove with celestial flowers by the mystic hand o refraction. Sill always it is beautiful, tba life giving water; no poison bubbles on it brink; ita foam brings not madness an murder; na Wood stains ita liquid glass pale widows and starving children weep n burning tears in its depth; no drunker ahiieking ghost bom the grave cozasa il i the words ol eternal despair ; speak ont, ruy friends, wonld yon exchange it for demon's drink, alcohol?
