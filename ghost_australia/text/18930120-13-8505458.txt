TREE GODS. (From the Daily News). Why do races of men in very different ages and distant parts of the world. Yvorslnp trees' This is a question which the learned have often asked, especially in German 'NY throat troubling himself much as to what the Germans say (and, indeed, they seldom trouble themselves about what me say), Mr Grant Allen has solved the difficulty to his own satisfaction in a work on 'the Atlas o; Catvllm (Nutt) It is a very pretty book, containing a charming trans tion of the poem , the announcement, which will be new to many, that Captains was a Celt, a dissertation on tree worship and another on a certain Latin metre The important thing however, for our curiosity is to know why savage and civilised races have worshipped trees Mr Max Muller says they do so because trees suggest to them shadowy notion of the Infinite Other inquirers re- mark that they know nothing which savages do not worship, and that it would be odd if they made an exception of trees and left them alone, while they venerate the earth, the sky, the moon, sardines, frogs, mice, and their own grandfathers Mr 1 razed, to some extent following Mimnhardt, has recently in The Golden Bough laid much stress on the worship of spirits in corn and in vegetation Different peoples, all the world over have taken it into their heads that the " corn spirit ' is embodied in a certain person, have treated him like a king, have been sacrificed him, and have sometimes buried bits of him to fertilise the fields Probably our May Queens and Jack s at the Green are the latest representatives of the unlucky beings who were at once the god and the victim Mr Grant Allen, following what he calls Mr Herbert Spencer is, and what others call Dr Ijlors, hypothesis (it is really much older than either of them), thinks that all the gods of the nations were originally the ghosts of dead ancestors or at least sprang from the state of mind gradually evolved out of a belief in the friendly or in friendly ghosts Then how is the worship of trees to be accounted for on this hypothesis ' One might mistake a tree for a ghost, but one could hardly mistake a ghost for a tree Mr Allen's ingenuity is never at fault, and he easily shows that dead men are buried that trees and other v vegetables grow on their graves that the vegetable may be taken for a manifestation of the spirit of the deceased within the grave, and so the vegetable may share in the worship of the spirit in all speculations of this kind it is necessary, as Bacon says, to examine contradictory in stances ' cases where we had the effect without the presumed cause, and the cause without the expected effect 'that is, in this affair, it would be scientific to study, not only the tree worship but the funereal customs of all races Some tribes burn and do not burn their dead, do they worship trees and, if so, how is the circumstance to be explained is burning with them a later practice than burying' Some peoples expose their dead on raised platforms others on towers Some mummies their dead, like the Egyptians and the Peruvians , some bury them in vaults of stone out of which nothing could grow, some, like the Incas, preserved the Royal deceased seated in splendour-nothing could spring out of their graves , some buried the defunct m caves-out of, or rather in, caves, trees are not likely to develop There are peoples which have stripped the flesh off the dead, and consigned the bones to the sea, or otherwise got rid of them there be peoples which pile mounds of loose stones cairns as the Scotch say, over the dead , trees and v vegetation would find scant soil on a cairn Others have eaten their deceased relations , trees cannot be sepulchral ornaments of corpses accounted for in this manner to some inquirers it will seem that all these and other funereal rates must be carefully scrutinised before Mr Grant Allen's hypothesis can be admitted as sound and satisfactory It will have to be ascertained whether persons who employ all the methods of disposing of the dead which cannot conceivably allow trees to grow over them are tree worshippers or not Clearly this inquiry is a wide one, and an enormous heap of matter needs to be sifted Again, it would be needful to ask whether any peoples worship trees for some other reason than Mr Allen's and this is a difficult study indeed for worshippers often give a false or fanciful reason for their conduct Thus we might say that Mr Allen has made a very good case out for some examples of tree worship, while about many other cases we need more information Greek examples of gods, very respectable gods, who were, in some places tree gods are numerous, but Mr Allen does not investigate them Nor does he at nil lead in Bacons 'contradictory in stances to examine which is scientifically essential We need to know a very great deal more than we do know before we can come to any scientific conclusion about a matter so perplexed For example, some Australian black-fellows re card some trees as their ancestors trans- formed, and will not cut them down Now we really must know all about the burial customs of that particular tribe, must know whether they have well marked cemeteries, and vi whether trees grow on them and w whether there are not other objects such as stars and beasts, into which they think their fathers ore transformed before we can say whether the superstition grew, like the tree out of tunes A very rude and wandering tube is apt, one might think, to lose sight of its family vault Such a tribe will not make offerings of food at the graves, or not often Mr Allen has an ingenious theory that such offerings may be the origin of cultivation the savage says fruits let us say, by the tomb 'The dead men within may for these the soil (though we fancy they are often buried too deep) Other causes may provoke fertility , the seeds of the fruit may flourish, theyoungtiees may be regarded as a man a cessation of the dead, and so may attain a sacred character No doubt this may happen, and hence too may come the habit of rank ing a fertilising influence, by killing some human victim and burying bits of him about the fields This is a rite of some tribes in India, also of the Pawnees in America, while the Athenians used pigs instead of people for the purpose It is unluckily too late in the day to ask whether old tumult or burial mounds are really notably fertile Mr Allen has remarked the interesting fact that Scotch first not now indigenous to Southern England, surround the barrows of the ancient dead Are the graves as old as the barrows' On the other hand, in the south of Scotland there are many great tumut, with no trees in their immediate neighbourhood, above all, with no Scotch first Very commonly the parish kirk stands hard by such barrows in a certain Argileshtrc strath, the ancient circle of sepulchral stones may be seen with the oats win in, all round it, but probably the dead do little or nothing for the oats Mr Allen omits two useful instances the trees which tile Muses, according to Homer, planted on a heroic grave, and the grace of the lovers in the ballad They buried the ano In Mar) s kirk The other In Vimy s pine, And out of the aue there even a back, and out of the other a briar Usually the parish clerk comes by and extirpate these heathenish trees, in one case, By cam the Black Douglas And he was wondrous rouen, 1 for he has been the board briar, And thrown it in the loch doubtless to prevent tree worship Perhaps a severe inquirer will say that Mr Allen has written an interesting book, and has, in many cases, connected trees and tombs ghosts, gods, and tree worship but he will reserve his belief till somebody more elaborately examines the funereal customs of the world, as connected with the religious view of vegetation 'lode this properly needs as much space as Mr IWer enjoys in his Goldeniioujh Mankind is always discover- ing the master key of the chamber of the past, but somehow the key usually proves disappointing Probably there is no one muster key at all Perhaps someone will say that when buy age ghosts lie up trees, this is a mere survival of primitive man, pro- ably arboreal At the meeting of the Electrical Engineers on December 1, a discussion took place on the paper
