MOKDA Y, DECEMBER 9, 1878. We chew attention on Saturday to the gross misstatements contained in LTib Everill NCY b speech at the prorogation of Parliament with regard to the condition of the country, and to the impropriety, of implicating Divine Provi dence in a fraudulent attestation of an imaginary prosperity On the evening; of the day the address in question was delivered, Mr Gaunson met his constituents at Ararat, and spoke openly of the widespread distress which prevails throughout the colony in consequence of Minister lal proceedings Ali Gyunsox said plainly that in his opinion the "con " tinuance in office of the Berry Govern " ment was the main cause of thedeepdis " to ness which existed all over the colony, " and especially around Melbourne, " owing to the sense of security they And inspired in the employ era "labour" Was this declaration by a disclaimer ? Did any one do either by speech 01 interjection, existence of the depression wl Mr Gaunson's mentioned? Nothing the soil His assertion we have qu was endorsed by the cheers of the present, who have doubtless by time begun to count the cost of " Liberal Government and heroic relation If there was room for doubt as to the meaning of these che all hesitancy with respect to the intent was fully cleared up by the meeting closed A M Buchan who, we are informed, is known as " " working man's friend, lose to a; few words in favour of the Ahnisl winch, for some reason which he did; condescend to explain, he declared to the best Government for the poor in that the colony had ever had Dear Mr Buen vi. AN and his popular fancies, we venture to think that but long the masses will regard Mr Bar and his colleagues as the greatest ever inflicted on them However, opinion expressed by this profession friend of the people did not in with acceptance We are told that was received with "Uproar, grow " and a voice, 'They (the Ministers) i " mining the country " Mr. G u soils s meeting appears to have been fairly representative one-not pacts by reform leaguers, but neither containing members of all parties a near approach to unanimity, thereto which existed on this point is a striking, and is a strong corroboration of what we have asserted in the columns concerning the state of the and industry No doubt there were many present who, on the strength some n national sentiment, believe of Mr Buch vi, us that the Berry Admin stration is a boon to the working class' but not even then zeal for a few elling a revolutionary Government could find them to endorse the fiction put into mouth of the Qui i y s repre entail concerning the continued prosperity the " producing and manufacturing; " interests of the country But it is not only in connexion w i matters of that, and industry that the Government has deliberately sought deceive the public The same u scrupulous audacity which proclaim a state of prosperity which has i existence is apparent in the amount ment that in a military point Mew the country is in a co dition of safety The paragraph the speech to which we refer is follows " The Imperial Gover ment at present engaged in a was which in eventuate in a collision with a friend: "power" [As there is no civil w: raging in any part of the empire, v were under the impression that the cc sion. with a foreign power had already taken place We fancy that the Afghans opposed to General Roberts Perry, are rather of this opinion W suppose " foreign power, in the relates the words are used, is liberal English for European naval power But to proceed] "My advisers are " confident that every possible step to " been taken to strengthen and improve " our defences so as to prevent the " possibility of a successful hosts " demonstration against this country This is another instance of reckless assertion being lesoitedtointhe hope ( closing Minister in short comings Every one who knows anything about the state of our defence works will be prepared t to case the statement in every particular Ex city possible step has not been taken to enable us to repel aggression and not only is a hostile " demolish' " tion against the country within the power of an enterprising enemy, but also a damaging attack and a parcel, ransom It is true that the Government has increased the battery power a Queenscliff, and also put some guns in position at Point Nepean, but no commander of any dash would be deterred from attempting an entrance by the-. obstacles He would either am the Gauntlet, taking the many chances in in favour of not being struck, or he would land a force under cover of Point Loma dale and take the Queenscliff battery in reverse This latter danger was guarded against in So Willi m Jlh vois's scheme by enclosing the works a Queenscliff with a wall, and, we think, . ditch, the whole enclosure being commanded by a towel, the iii of from vinci would soon clear out any intruders When Mr. By my talks about every possible step Lix ing been taken to strengthen and improve our defences we would ask him why this wall and towel, which are essential to the safety and efficiency of the Queenscliff bat tents, have not been erected I? But apart from these w works at Queens cliff, which after all are merely outworks what has been done for the defence of the metropolis? The Nelson, it is true, has been cut down, at a cost of £16,000, but beyond enriching Mr A T Clvkivs constituents and furnishing the Government with a large pleasure boat, the operation is utterly useless At the commencement of 1877 Lieutenant BuCdvle, of the Royal Navy, reported on the proposal to use; this fine old vessel, and gave it as his _ di beiate opinion that, cut down or entire, she would prove alike valueless as a means of defence The real defence of Melbourne was designed by Sir WilLiAM Jervois to be the forts at the entrance to the west and south channels, and lines of torpedoes covered by these works Any vessel making for the bay would have to pass these forts within point blank range, and would stand a good chance of being blown out of the water With these facts we believe that Melbourne would be unapproachable by sea by any enemy we are likely to see in Southern waters , without them we feel convinced that three or four vessels-only one of which need be capable of engaging the Co bo as might do almost as they pleased, the batteries at Queenscliff and Point Nepean to the con- trary notwithstanding We may be told perhaps that there is a plentiful supply of torpedoes on hand with which the channels could be blocked, but experience goes to show that torpedoes are of little use for the defence of a port without covering works Seeing, then that not a stone of these essential forts has been laid, although there is nothing to stop the way, the statement put into the Gov lawsons mouth with regard to the defences is simply a piece of liberal ' effrontery In this, as in all other things, Mr Bunny seems to imagine that he has only to make a assertion in order to produce a fact in many respects the most innocent bill of the session is that which was hurried through during the last few sittings. of the House and which by came how -very much at the surprise of the Government The land Act Amend- ment Pill was not sent up to the Council until the Appropriation Bill had been disposed of by the Iowa House, am the Council had thus to make a choice between not dealing with the one measures del rung the other, and was intends to men share in either case I wish.) adopted the latter alternative and, moreover, it dealt with the bill in a spirit of conciliation As the measure now stands it does two things It extends the term during which the selector is on licence from three to six years, and under certain conditions it was the necessity of residence The former proposition is that of the Government, and the latter was adopted by Ministers in deference to the expressed wish of the Assembly, and no doubt it has seemed for the measure a certain amount of populars.) And indeed the non residence clause is of value if only as indicative of a return to commonsense The most radical of hard íefomiers-even the extreme men who drew up the recent report of the Land Commission-havebeguntoiccognise the impolicy) of saying strictly and stain.) that in no case shall a man with capital go upon the land, and it is with their consent that we have the present con- cession clumsy concession, it is true but still to be prized, as pointing to a hereafter When the measure was first made ducedive opposed it heartily, and such of the original parts as are still in existence at c deserting of animadvert on the proposal of the Government was that the lessee should not be able to obtain a title, not to give a title, for a period of 20 years During this period the selector was practically to be prohibited from intercourse with the banks, or with any other financial institutions requiring legitimate seem it for legitimate advances, and it need scarcely be said that the agricultural interest has just as much need of monetary accommodation as any other trade or occupation The origin of the idea was the horror with which the Minister of Lands regards mortgages He takes mortgages to be the testing ment by which the rich man hims the poor man, whereas, as the records of every building society will show, a mortgage is the instrument by which the poor industrious sober man can utilise the capital of other s, and can em ich himself What is good for the tradesman who desires to acquire a house must be good for the elector who wishes to work a farm Eve by man in the Assembly with a practical knowledge of banking and of finance, no matter on which side of the House he was sitting, pointed out to Ministers the folly the) w ci c contemplating and the Council, in which men of business are more abundant than is the case below, had no hesitation in inviting the Lower House to reconsider its determination, with the result that hon neighbors unanimously agreed to allow a grant to issue w hence as the lessee chooses to pay up This alteration, which makes a title possible, and will enable the lessee to obtain credit, no doubt takes the sting out of the new act, but even as it stands it is questionable how far the measure in its dealings with the selector s is an improvement on the existing law If anything was shown by the evidence taken by the Royal Commission it was that the men of the selector is often affected during his career as a licensee, when, having no security) to oil as, he falls into the hands of the user, and now that the probationary period is doubled, the poor man is more likely than ever to become the prey of the 20 and 30 and 40 percent Impress The stock keener and the agricultural implement maker could see then way to give credit during the last year or eighteen months of the licence period, because then a bankrupt advance became possible, but waiting for four or five years is a very different thing No doubt there is a set off, as the selector pays Is per annum as rent instead of 2s , and has six years instead of three wherein to make his improvements, so that his annual outlay on this account need be only 3s 4d per acre instead of 6s 8d Still the tent has to be paid, and the improvements have to be effected ultimately , capital must be sunk before the land will yield an) actual, and serious doubts must be entertained whether the extension of time compensates for the i withdrawal of financial facilities The lent payment was no difficulty to a man with money, and the man without funds is necessarily the very) person who most leagues to have the capital of others The te mission is small and the disability) is heavy If the new act is left to its operation, this portion of it we may men will work not so much in favour of the active, energetic, pushing man anxious to turn the land to profitable account at once, but will tend to encourage the men who durdin) on their. own account, who hang on doing as little as possible, and then sell However, it was not for the Lc_,kh try e Council to obstinately dam legible tion The Upper House vindicated it usefulness by giving the Assembly an opportunity of reconsidering its hasty and extraordinary decision about the 20 years since, and it was fair to me said the non residence clause as a set off against the extension of the probationary period The land laws have to be cased in another year in consequence of the parent act expiring by effluxion of time In the meanwhile the Royal Commission is to take evi- dence, and we may hope that selectors s will speak out, and light will penetrate In any case, the notice dence clause was worth paying a piano for Under it the state will obt un Ls per acre instead of £1, or will double its receipts, and as men will not pay the price unless the land is worth the money, no one will be injured by the change Possibly the principle will grow. and more favour will be shown next year than was the case this to the proposition of the minority of the Eo) as Commission-that we should deal with the remnant of our domain on a commercial and not a sentimental basis, should classify) the land which is left us, and sell each class at its legitimate market value When that system is adopted-and not till then the boss cockie will die out on the one hand, and the dummy will disappear on the other, for there will be no necessity for a go between, and these will have the pleasure of seeing the lane' it selK bought for use and put into cutive thousands, as the returns show us, that is not now the case Having sacrificed three fourths of our agricultural land to liberal ideas and delusions, it must be admitted to be high time that we reasonably utilise the remainder In alluding to the he u ) fill which had taken pi lee in Victoria in securities before the last mail left England, Mr Wi^r o vi ii attributes the dear ociation amongst other things, to the bad effect of the " colony s political cross purposes If " moss purposes' and violent contentions have such a prejudicial effect, what may we expect from recent proceedings Along with our debentures will go home reports of the Ministerial speeches recently) delivered, and we ask people to imagine, if they can, what effect the latter will have on the value of the former We are asking English c capitalists to lend us their money, while the people in authority, are recklessly destroying our credit for the sole purpose of keeping in office When British investors than that Ministers of the Crown in Victoria deliberately incited the masses to lovely turn and bloodshed in support of a policy which, if realised, would ship property of every shred of security, is there likely to be a wish for our " promises to pay I When they hear that a gentleman who is one of His Excellency's adv waters ondea yours waul matice pi expense to excite the hatred of the unthinking crowd against men whose only 01 uno is that they bought land and paid for it, is it not almost certain that they will look forward to the day when the possession of debentures will be regarded equally as a, crime, and refuse fiomtcndeung? We doubt very much whether under the circumstances the loan will be floated at all, but it is certain that it will not be without difficulty or a heavy discount The fact of Mr Berry and his colleagues being in office would under any circumstances cost the colony deal, but each treason able speech will increase the loss Let it be remembered that every half percent is equal to £25,000, 01 botweonfoui and no miles of railways fully equipped Under some circumstances of course Mr Lot MORE, even as a Minister, might spout sedition at Hotham 01 elsewhere without affecting any one in particular People who heard him or came by accident what he had said might wonder for a minute that His Excellency did not do his duty and immediately gazette him out of office, but beyond this no interest would be excited by his utter trees At the present juncture, how ev 01, it is different v care about to send two men home on a to his errand, and then pro- once and doings in London, being part { of the news of the day, will draw public attention to our affairs When, then, tenders are invited for ora debentures, the proceedings of the distinguished visitors and then associates are likely to attain a most undesirable prominence When it becomes generally 1 known that Mr. Berry contemplates further dead locks and a row with the Colonial Office, and that the talk of his colleagues is daily of revolution, confiscation, swords, slid toughs, and other things of a kindred nature, what man will be fool enough to cut ust us with his money - At the Parliamentary dinner given in Sydney in honour of Mr W M'AitTiioi, M P for Lambeth, the guest of the ot on nig expressed his great admiration for what he had hitherto seen in the course of his antipodean to acts and said that he thought it would not be a bad thing if the Secretary of State for the Colonies would spare nine months or so to make a tour through Canada, the United States, and Australia he f vi from being a bad thing, it would be one of the most real vant seems proceedings imaginable We fear, however, that other ties and the exigencies of party Government will always pi "tent the gentleman actually holding the seas of the Colonial Office of a son absenting, himself from his post in London for anything like the time necessary to make a profitable inspection of the provinces under his rule The proper time to make acquaintance with the de- pendencies of the empire is before as sinning the responsibilities of office, or, if the duty has been neglected, in those intervals between the periods of office which "lvointeimittöntloisuie Ihoioean be no doubt that a personal ic pi entrance with the great and growing, communities which are building up the Greater But in that seems destined to encircle the world, sin must be considered an essential part of an English statesman training It is necessary that those who advise that Man say should understand colonial life and feeling Those who is time then knowledge of countries horn blue books and despatches, can never realise their condition, then sensibilities, and then aspirations as those can who have studied the politics on the spot, figured then amusements, and mixed in their social life in the mind of the of the, the communities they lead of, or abuse, of manage no abstract things to the latter they are living breathing-, entities, filled with the energy, moved by the passions, and astir with the hopes and fears of humanity In these days of rapid loco motion, there is no excuse for the indifference with which the colonies are too frequently treated The empire, as a whole, suffers from the neglect they experience If English statesmen and the English people generally had a more intimate personal knowledge of their affects their capabilities, and then in evitable future, they would cherish the connexion between the mother country and its offshoots with a warmth which is now too often conspicuous by its absence Nov that loyalty has taken to travelling, we trust that colonial toms may become fashionable, and that before in my years the every personal acquaintance with Greater Britain may be considered necessary part of a liberal education A Reuter s telegram from Wellington announces that the Marquis of Normanby has accepted the Governorship of Victoria and will leave New Zealand at the end of January. This is confirmatory of the information which we published on Friday on the authority of private letters received from England by the mail The British force which is now marching on Cabul in three columns consists of about 10,000 men, the whole being under the command of General Crawford Chamberlain while the divisional commands have been entrusted to General Maude, General Bid Culph, and General Roberts Of two of these columns we have already received in portant information The force which started from Peshawur and proceeded by the Khyber Pass encountered the enemy at Ali Masjid and having successfully stormed that fort have pushed on to Jellalabad, which is stated to have been evacuated According to the records of the Russian central staff office, Jellalabad only contains 1 000 inhabitants It is described as a place of respectable strength but abandoned ItisdistantOOmilesfroin Cabul, over a very precipitous country, for whereas Jellalabad is our. TOGO above the sea, the altitude of Cabul is 0 500ft The principal attention has been directed to the movements of the Kohat column, directed by General Roberts which penetrated the Ameer a territory by the Kurram Valley route, and al pancreas fares the Railway Pass before resist ance was offered by the enemy The Kurram Valley is the best known route, and in the most fertile 'I he Palw ar Pass 13 more than halfway to Cabul and it was anticipated that, in the event of this Murray Valley scheme hemp; undertaken, the Sarwar Pasha, the Bazar lJjrakht dedle 1? miles in length and the Shuter Our day Pass, would all be strongly fortified and fiercely defended The Jays tribe, which inhabit the mountain to fell, between I in 11 and Shuter G Arden and the Minerals on the southern slope of the Piuunr Mountain are in the pay of the Ameer and believed to be attached to his cause Further on the fanatical Khostw all tube and the Jadrans will probably have to be encountered 1 In reaching Pal war General Roberts is we than a hundred miles of the Afghan capital, but bobas jet the most difficult portion of his journey to confront, as the valleys of the Kmnun and Cabul, with their tributaries, are the most densely inhabited parts of the country of the Quettah column), which is to reach Afghanistan hythe Bolan Pass, we have but little information, but as the pass is impassable after the middle of November, it is probable that no advance in this direction further than Quettah will be made until the spring The Cabinet arrangements connected with the departure of the Chief Secretary will be made this week V e have mentioned already that Sir Bryan O'Loghlen will act as Chief Secretary With regard to the pressure it is probable that it will he entrusted to Major Smith, and in order to enable the hon. gentleman to take charge of the department the Mining office will be temporarily administered in part or altogether by the Minister of Lands If the arrangement works well an additional reason will be supplied for making the long talked of amalgamation of the two offices The Chief Secretary was not able to attend at his departments on Saturday in consequence of a slight accident which he met with in returning from the Nelson Cup Mr Berry did not leave with the rest of the visitors by the tug steamers, but came by the steam launch of the vessel The little craft jumped about in the sea, and on stepping into her the Chief Secretary missed his foot ing, and in the fall bruised both legs severely Mr Berry attended Parliament on Friday but matters have not improved since then, and his medical adviser orders rest for a few days A mass meeting at which the Chief Secretary is to speak is to be held before the departure of the embassy to England. The locality originally fixed for the demonstration was Geelong, and probably though not certainly, this selection will be adhered to During the last few days interviews have taken place between Mr. G B Kerferd, as representative of the Harbour Trust Commis- sioners, and Mr Croker, solicitor for Messrs. VV right, Orr, and Co., for the purpose of con- widening the possibility of arriving at a solu- tion of the dock difficulty, but up to the present time no progress has been made On Friday evening Mr Croker tendered to Mr Kerferd a draft copy of a memorandum containing proposals differing in no essential particular from those that have previously been submitted, and which the Harbour Trust Commissioners have all along declined to entertain V right, Orr, and Co propose to surrender that portion of the old dock which projects into the river in consideration of receiving the sum of £1,500, and being allowed the right of entrance to a second dock They also propose to assign the commissioners their interest in a triangular piece of land about 30ft long and to cooperate with the commissioners in obtaining for the fruit from the Com- missioncr of Crown Lands the permissive occupancy of a small corner piece of land to the southeast of VC right Orr, and Co's new leasehold To these proposals the Harbour 'Iilist object that the entrance to a second dock claimed by Wright Orr, and Co would interfere with the continuity of the wharf which it is proposed to construct on that side of the river, and that the portion of land which by right Orr and Co offer to surrender would be utterly useless to them for any purpose The subject in dis 1 ute, therefore between the Harbour Trust and VV right Orr, and Co remains in status quo, and it is understood that the commissioners will make no further effort to effect a compromise till they receive an answer to the proposal made to Wright, Orr and Co a fortnight ago, that the matter should be referred to arbitration on a basis arranged by Mr Lyell The exact hour at which the Australian eleven will arrive in town to morrow has not yet been fixed, but the special train will probably be timed to come in before 3 o'clock 'len of the eleven have reached Albury, and will spend a portion of to day 111 practice Mr Spofforth readied Melbourne by the Chief 10t s son Saturday.
