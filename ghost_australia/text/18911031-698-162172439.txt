AQUATICS. Sailing Notes. The first race of the season for boats of the Sydne Amateur Sailing. Club took place on Saturday afternoon last, for prizes of £i, £2, and £1 respectively, when the following were the entries and handicaps: — Netta, 20ft., scratch.; Curlew, 22ft., 2 minutes ; Yacuna, 22ft., 3 minutes ; Genesta, 20ft., and Ellie, 22ft., each 5 minutes ; Xarifa, 24ft., 6 minutes; Elsie, 24ft., 7 minutes; and Varuiia, 22ft., 9 minutes. The course was the usual Lightship track, viz., from a flying start at 3.15 p.m. from a line between the starter's boat and the beacon on Kirribilli Point, down round the lightship and Sow and Pigs and Shark XEMU.U.U, iuuuu u uuut uji. X'uli* .lu-aia^uiiiu;, thence round Fort Denison and back to flagboat. The wind was blowing nice and fresh from the north east. Owing to the illness of her owner the Varuna did not start ; Netta did not come to the scratch either. The club in this race decided to go back to the system of giving handicaps at the start, which was experi mented on a number of years ago, and did not prove popular ; but as the public have taken a much greater interest in sailing events of late years, this system of starting will, perhaps, be found more acceptable. It was carried out in several of the Port Jackson Club races last season, and although the crews of the boats on scratch or near it objected to the system, still the public who followed the races found it more intel ligible than the old style. The finishing times were Yacuna, 4h. 5lm. 2ls. ; Curlew, 4h. 54m. 12s. ; Genesta, 4h. 5Gm. 16s. ; Ellie, 4b. 56m. 18s. ; Xarifa, 4h. 56m. 35s. ; Elsie, 4h. 59m. 28s. Yacuna therefore had a comfortable win, with Curlew second, and, owing to Genesta starting some seconds before her time, this was deducted, which allowed Ellie third place. Messrs. J. H'Hurtrie and C. H. Goddard had charge of the race as starter and umpire respec tively. This newly-formed Sydney Flying Squadron Yacht Club held its first 'race on Saturday afternoon hist, and as there were new ideas to be worked out, it was a foregone conclusion that a large number of persons would attend to watch the' proceedings and judge whether these new ideas are likely to become popular. The special features of the club are that competing boats are to carry coloured designs on their sails ; that the boats have no beating, but sail round a triangular course and no boat leading is to prevent another passing her ; and thirdly, that the handicaps are given at the start. With reference to the first-named special feature, it ?was intended at first that the boats were to carry striped sails, but as great objection was taken to this, coloured designs were allowed in the shape of crosses, stars, crescents, &c.; A large crowd of visitors were conveyed from different parts of the harbour to Clark Island and landed there, this being the point from whence the boats started. The steamer Agenoria, having on board the umpire (Mr. T. Saunders), who at the last moment took the place of the official umpire (Mr. Fitzhardinge), followed the races throughout. The steamer Gosford also followed the races, with a large crowd of visitors on board. There were two preliminary heats, and from these the first and second boats competed in the final. The course was from Clark Island round mark in Hose Bay, round mark in Taylor Bay near sunken steamer Cen tennial, and back to starting-point. First Heat.— Grace Darling, 20ft., D. A. Hansen, 3 minutes ; Ghost, 24ft., Arthur Thomas, 2} minutes ; Violet, 22ft., Gr. Holmes, 1$ minute; Mare'ilia, 24ft., C. P. M'Conville, J minute; Volunteer, 24ft., J. Robinson, scratch. It was about 25 minutes to 4 when the Grace Darling was sent away. The Ghost was the next to be sent, but, like all other ghosts, she could not be found when wanted. Violet got over her mark much better than the next boats in order, Mas silia and Volunteer. Ghost started after the scratch boat. Before reaching the first mark Violet's jibcarried away, in fact she nearly lost her mast, and had to retire. The first mark was rounded as follows : — Grace Darling, 3h. 49m. 17s. ; Massilia, 3h. 51m. 40s. ; Volunteer, 3h. 52m. 10s. ; Ghost, 3h. 5fim. 21s. Second mark was reached by Grace Darling at 3h. 59m. 4s. ; Massilia, 4h. 0m. 39s. ; Volunteer, 4h, lm. 25s. Massilia set spinnaker for the run back, but the tack came adrift off Bradley's and it had to be re-set. The finishing times were — Grace Darling, 4h. 7m. 10s. ; Massilia, 4h. 8m. 5s. ; Volunteer, 4h. 9m. Second Heat.— Maritana, 20ft., O. Taylor, 3} minutes ; Kananook, 26ft., Mark Foy, 1J minute ; Our Own, 24ft., S. Hellings, 1| minute ; Begina, 24ft., George Pavrett, J minute ; Lottie, 24ft, C. P.TSl'Con ville, scratch; Mantura, 24ft., Chris. Webb, scratch. Neither Maritana nor Lottie started. Kananook and Our Own got away splendidly together at 4h. 31m. 25s. Begina crossed at 4h. 32m. 2ns., and Mantura at ih. 33m. 5s. Kananook was .first to reach the . mark in Hose Bay at 4h. 42m. 10s., Our Own 4b. \- 42m. 20s., Begina 4h. 42m. 45s., Mantura 4h. 43m. 5s. For the lead to the second mark all the boats seemed to go rather far to windward, the times round ing being Kananook 4h. 51m. 42s., Our Own 4h. 51m. 55s., Begina 4h. 52m. 9s., Mantura 4h. 52m. 14s. Our Own nearly came to grief in the jibe, and lost some distance, which she again picked up in getting her spinnaker set first. Kananook and Mantura set squaresails. Much excitement was caused as the boats ran back, being all of a heap, the finishing times being — Kananook, 4h. 59m. 30s. ; Mantura, 4h. 59m. 33s. ; Begina and Our Own together at 4h. 59m. 41s. Final Heat.— For this heat the following were the competitors : — Grace Darling, Kananook, Massilia, and Mantura. Grace Darling was first away at 5h. 16m, 44s. ; Kananook at 5h. 18m. 10s. ; Massilia, 5h. 19m. 8s. ; and Mantura, 5h. 19m. 40s. ' Shortly after starting Grace Darling's bailer threw his bucket overboard, which did not improve her prospects, owing to it being very much wanted to keep the water out of her. All the rear boats closed up before reaching the first mark, which was rounded by Grace Darling at 5h. 27m. 40s. ; Kananook, 5h. 28m. 20s. ; Massilia, 5h. 28m. 40s. ; Mantura, oh. 29m. 14s. Massilia passed Kananook before reaching second mark, the times being — Grace Darling, oh. 37m. 35s. ; MagRUVa, 5h. 37m. 43s. ; Kananook, 5h. 38m. 2s. ; Mantura, 5h. 38m. 15s. Massilia nearly made a mess of the jibe, and her gear aloft seemed to get fouL . She and Grace Darling set spinnakers, whilst Kananook and Mantura set squaresails for the run to finish, the latter also adding topsail. The Grace Darling was passed by all the others, and both Kaua ? nook and Mantura were crawling on to Massilia, when the latter's gaff carried away, and she gradually dropped into third position. Mantura passed Kananook just before reaching the flagboat. The finishing times of the first three were — Mantura, 5h. 55m. 5Os ; Kananook, 5h. 55m. 51s. ; Massilia, 5h. 55m. 52s. The scratch boat Mantura, splendidly sailed by Chris. Webb, secured a most popular win. The second boat, Kananook, and third boat, Massilia, were abx- well sailed by Messrs. Foy and M'Conville respectively. On the results, the handicapper. Mr. W. Griffiths, must be complimented. The general success of the affair, however, is mainly due to Mr. W. Fitzhenry, who started the boats and laid the course, besides attending to matters in general. The second race on the programme of the John stone's Bay Sailing Club, which was for boats from 14ft io 18ft., was sailed last Saturday after noon for prizes of £5 and £1, being first and second respectively, the course being from a flying start from Johnstone's Bay down round Shark Island and back to flagboat. The craft entered, with their handicaps, were as follows :— Edith, 18ft., scratch ; Cygnet, 18ft, | minute ; Our Boys, 16ft., and Sophie, 16ft., each 2 minutes; Our Len, 16ft-, 3£ jninutes ; - Thomas Punch, 14ft., 5} minutes! * With the exception of the Gygnet (which did not put in an appearance) the rest of the boats were des patched to a fairly good start by Mr. F. Stevenson, the wind blowing moderately from the north-east and - the tide ebbing. After passing Garden Island on the way back to the flagboat, Sophie gave up, thus leaving the Edith and Thomas Punch to fight it out. On jibbing round Shark Island the times were — Edith, at 4h. 20m. 10s : and Thomas Punch, at 4h. 34m. 30s. On the way back to John stone's Bay the Edith increased her lead considerably, and passed the flagboat at 4h. 50m. 25s., the Thomas Punch following at 5h. llm. 45s. Thus, after deduct ing time allowance, Edith beat Thomas Punch by 15m. 35s. The boats were sailed by Tom Cole brook and T. M'Farlane respectively. Protests have been entered by both, which will be considered at the club's next meeting. In connection with the Botany Sailing Club a race for sailing boats under working sails took place on Saturday afternoon last for prizes presented by the club, when the following boats entered and started : — Marvel, scratch ; Alure, 5 minutes ; Young Fred, 6 minutes ; Honeydew,8 minutes ; Ionic, Isabel, and Flirt, 9 minutes each ; Chance, 11 minutes. The usual Botany course was sailed. The handicaps were given at the start. With a nice north-easter blowing the boats were not long in completing the course, the winner turning up in Alure, the second and third boats, Ionic and Flirt, making a grand race all through. The finishing times were— Alure, 5h. 26m. 25s.-; Ionic, 5h. 30m. 6s. ; Flirt, 5h. 30m. l£s. ; Young Fred, 5h. 31m. 48s. ; Marvel, 5h. 34m. 15s ; others not timed. Mr. Clarke officiated as starter, and Mr. F. J. Thomas judge.
