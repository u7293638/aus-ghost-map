CURRENT LITERATURE. A further instalment of Letters of TI mas Cay rule (Macmillan and Co seems to have been called for rather because Mr 1 Froude had published some of them before than because of any real interest which is contained in them The public will begin to think that we have had almost too much of Mr Carlyle and to feel that it is being punished because of the sins of his literary executor According to a prefatory note by Mr 1 hot Norton which appears in the front of these two volumes we should not have had these additional letters had not Mr 1 made, in his Life of Cat has', printed some of them with surprising indifference to correctness while dr wing from them inferences which were unwarranted and open to question.

It was a severe trial indeed for the bright young wife, accustomed to the refinements of polished society, to be taken to the solitary farm house of Craigen periods, in the Annandale wilds, but for anything that we learn from these letters, she had but little reason to complain of her literary mate, with whose circumstances and whose character she must have been, or ought to have been, familiar After their removal to London, the letters, of course, in crease in interest, as Carlyle enlarged the circle of his literary acquaintances His descrip notes of some of them are perfect portraits in pen and ink, as good as any he ever painted, and not by any means so ill natured as Mr Froude had made them out to be.

Nevertire less, it is well calculated to serve its purpose. Mr Eggleston though an ardent and patriotic citizen of the great Republic, is commendably) free from most of the literary vices of his nation He is entirely unprejudiced and independent, nor do we detect, even in his narrative of the early struggles of his countrymen for freedom, any trace of unfairness, still less of exaggeration or high falutin He is plain even to baldness, and his studies do not appear to have advanced greatly in the direction of general history or geography, and he has told the story of the rise and progress of his country very carefully and industrious) He seems to its agree that Christopher Columbus was born with those names, and he has some ideas of Asiatic ethnography) Vasco da Gama, according to him, succeeded in sailing; round the Cape of Good Hope, and reaching Calcutta in India - a remarkable feat, which Ciruoena has some how forgotten to record It may be, perhaps, for the reason that Calicut did not exist in Vasco de Garait a time Mr I "liston apparently) means Calicut, which is a long way oil from the City of Palaces The book is very profusely illustrated, but in the artistic side cannot be and to be strong as it is rich borne of the portraits of the early heroes of American history are ludicrous caricatures, and Raleigh and Queen Elizabeth have received but scant justice at the artists hands On the other hand, the native statesmen and warriors are no better treated so we must acquit the picture makers of all design political and otherwise The History of the Great Cml War, by Samuel R. Gardiner (Longmans and Co ), has reached to its second volume. This great and valuable work, which must henceforth stand as the one authentic record of this period in the English language, has all the solid qualities of a history of the best class and of the old classical type We may judge of the minuteness and labonousness of the task to which Mr Gardiner has committed himself, by the met that this second volume of some fOO pages deals only. with the transactions of the three years between 163. 7 At this rate we shall not see the end of the Civil War for man) volumes became Lives of the Fitters by 1 Frederic W Farrar, D D (A and C Blick), can scarcely be said to belong to literature, though written with much fervour and fluency of style the 1 others are those of the early church, of the first four centuries, who are less known and peril taps regarded in these our Protestant times than they deserve to be Archdeacon Farrar has dealt with his task, which can in no sense be said to be a light one, with a bus dant erudition and industry) In the Camelot Vie (Walter Scott) we have the Pentameion and other Jinauinarq Comet filions, b) W after having Landor, edited by Havelock Dilks Landor is a writer who does not lend himself readily) to selection, but these are among the gems of his writings It is a pity we have no good complete edition of Landor s works That in two large volumes, double columns, is by no means complete, and it is in a form the most repulsive to the true book lover Mr Ellis's introductory preface is all too scant), and with scarcely what amount: of sympathy which an editor ought to feel for such a man OB I Landor, a writer of the most beautiful prose, and some of the rarest verse, in our language, of whom it may be and that, You must love him ere to you He will prove worthy of ) mr love Francis Bacon, his Life and Philosophy by John Nichol (VV Blackwood and Sons) is the second part of Professor Nichols work on the great English philosopher It will be appreciated by those who are students of the invigorate Magna the greatest contribu- tion ever made by man to the science of knowledge Professor Nichol writes mad'), hard style, which is uninviting but he shows himself a master of the Baconian philosophy), and has conceived a due estimate of the greatness of his subject The' lie of Ifeaili by Du BoisgobP) (Vizetelly and Co.) is one of the series of translations from modern Trench novelists, for which there seems to be an ample market in this country Du Boisgobey is one of the most eminent of the disciples of Suburban, and though a long way behind his master r in the art of story telling, he may be read with interest by those who long for an excitement greater than can refurnished by the ordinary English sensation mongers till I came ota Aint main Life, by George Van Hare ( Hen and Co.) is a curious record of an adventurous life, told in a slap dash, lived), artless fashion, which is not without its attraction Mr Van Hare has been ever) thing, from a horse trainer to a circus proprietor, and travelled everywhere with all sorts of animals, from gorillas to female rope dancers He has been sometimes fortunate, sometimes unlucky, but he managed to keep up a good heart through all his troubles, and is always ready to try his luck again He has brought over real North American Indians to exhibit in London, and was tolerably successful till his Yankee partners "Bkediiddled without pay mganybid) leaving the poor Indians up at Camden Town to starve He his travelled with a Tableau Vivants Troupe, and an Irish entertainment ' In fact, there is nothing Mr Van Hare has not shown, and no entertainment for which he has not entered He has an infinite number of nee dates to tell about a great many persons once known to the public, such as Mr G F Smith of Drury lane, and "Paddy Green of Evans's and he tells them with a great deal of spirit and freedom The Sphere of the Camera n romance, by Julian Hawthorne 'Chatto and Windus, is a powerfully) written story on the now popular theme of occult, or spiritual, Influence Mr Hawthorne has talents worthy of being spent on a better ear jest this mellon of pending with spooks and the sham supernatural is equally debasing to the writer and demoralising to the reader Body and Soul, b) Fred Noel Paton (W Blackwood and Sons), is another story of the same kind-dev er, but unhealth) und morbid The writers of these sensational traits all lack the one essential quality which makes this kind of romance tolerable.
