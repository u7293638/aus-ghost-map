BUT Donal did not feel that even then would he have exhausted the likelihood of discovery in it the source of the music that had so long haunted the house was in JLJIIUI hop in a chimney til it had not ci 01 sen ed) been used, might be enough for the other dwellers in the castle but Doing wanted to know as well why if this His i examine), it had been seldom mci was never used, also to what 100111 it was a examine) For the thought had struck him Could the music have any thing to do with the main legend that hung vaporous about the ancient house' Perhaps he might not so as mediator) have sought a possible connection between the two, but that the talk about the unknow in a room in the castle had got on spa e id nig, unique) after popular legends you had come near el and notice, and that had natur ill) increased the talk about it At the same time were fined occasional and increasing hints us to a ghost being even now seen it times about the castle As to this latter, Don ii had concluded the stone 01 more of the domestics might have had a glimpse of the evil in his esticas merit walks about the house, and land either imagined a ghost or had chosen to use the memory of their own flight to produce like effect upon yielded listeners With all its vagueness, the report was yet is was natural, associated with that of the lost cb tuber, as if from that the spectre issued, and to that he returned Various were the conjectures as to what ghost it might be among the few who were inclined to believe in such things, according to the version of the story adopted Donal, by nature strongly in god towards the roots of things, could not fail to let his mind west at times even on such a comparatively) unimportant virtuous of mystery, and cherish a desire to discover whether any or how much truth was at the root of it-for a root, great or small, there must be to everything, even the greatest he that ever was told-a root, that is, if not in the material, then in the moral world But he had no right to go pr) nig about the place, or doing anything which, if known, might be disagreeable He must take an opportunity of first suggesting the idea to Lady Victoria By the way she took it he would be guided For the present he must wait. His spare hours were now much occupied with his friend Andrew Comm The good man had so far recovered as to think himself able to work again , but he soon found it was very little he could do His strength was gone, and the exertion necessary to the lightest labour caused him pain It was sad to watch him on his stool, now putting in a stitch, now stopping for the cough which so sorely haunted his thin wind blown tent His face had grown very white and thin, and he had nearly lost his merriment, though not his cheerful ness, for he never looked other than quite content however things were with him. He had made up his mind that he was not to get better, but was to go home through a lingering illness He was ready to go and ready to linger, as God pleased Nor was there any thing w onder ful in its being so with such a man To most it will appeal more wonderful that he had no uneasiness as to how his Door) would fare when he was gone The house was then own, but there was no money in it-not even enough to pay the taxes, and if she sold it the proceeds would not be enough for her to live upon The neighbours, with the instinct of inferior natures, were severe upon Andrew's indifference to her welfare, manifest, they judged, in his great cheerfulness on the brink of the grave, but seat ce one of them knew the world of faith in which he lived, 01 could have understood that for the cobbler to allow the smallest danger of things going wrong for Dooly would have been to go down to the grave with the feeling that the universe was upheld only in the slipper) arms of chance A little moan escaping from Door), as she looked one evening into her money teapot, made Donal ask her a question of two She confessed that she had but a sixpence left New Donal had spent next to nothing since he came, and had therefore a few pounds in hand His father and mother he knew, a case in want of nothing his friend Sir Gibbie Galbraith was such a good son to them that compared with foregone hardships, never at the time counted such, they were now living in luxury Old Robert doubted whether he was not ministering to the flesh in letting Janet provide beef horse for him twice in the week' So Doing was free to spend for the friends next him-which was just what the people at home who were grand in the way they thought about money, would have approved of Never in that little cottage has a penny) been wasted never once one refused where there was in meet its need But first he must talk to Amliew An row, he said 1111 thanking' yon mean to grow in some short of silver 1 these times 0 w artlessness ' Deed, I wadna wonder ' ' answered Andrew "Door) says seething abouts truffles " Well, ' 1 returned Donal, ' thank God I have some 1' tie ill pickle one being' otherwise was hit, and set in danger of' sinking', an' atween brothers there sudna be two purses Yehia yer am down to his after, sir," said Andrew " They're sweet little efter better horses they was 1' their lives-the)'ie as feel utE 13 I am myself up 1' yon grey castle The) has a fresh what but for them, 01 somebody their stead, was ill he lived to be the great man he is the noo, an' there's a thing owes music for him to do for them, see my sister's no) fun to do wi' us I like-an' I like you an Doery, is ye well ken, better nor anybody but a few auld cleans 'Thereupon the old man put him through catechism as to his ways and means and prospects, and, finding that Donal believed as he ml) as himself in the care of the Master, and was convinced there was nothing that Master would rather see him do with his money than help those who needed it, especially those who trusted in Him, he yielded "Its no, ye see," said Doiul, "that I have any doubt of the Lord providing' glen 1 had first, but he hands the thing to my hand', just as fickle as ever he said there is for you to do, Donal ' five fowls of' this war, Andrew, might say it was laid on a pair student to have to pass his hard won cash, but you m' mc kegs better, view We ken theres nee guid 111 silver, ony mair than in anything further, but to do the will of' the Lord wi' it-an' to help one another is the thing he likes best to see come of' the silver It's 110 't he's short head', ye ken, Andrew ' ' " Weel, IN take it," said the old man "1 here's what I had," I returned Donal, hand- ing him the money ' Nana, name of' that ! ' said Andrew " Yeretreatin'mclikca muckle 1 cry in' an inn' beggai-olFeiin' me a' that at once' What syne wad be the prolonged sweetness of' hour' 'to free her hands from the rib of' an angel as he sent free v Yarra home on' j cr corner'" Here shone a glimmer of the old merriment through the vein look and pale eyes-' Nana, so,' he went on, 'just talk the thing over wi' Doory, an' let her have what she wants and the man She wadna like it What kens what may come the meantime '-Death lum sol', maybe' Or section Doone a Ino shillings, an when that is done she can last we been " Donal was forced to leave it thus, but he did his utmost to impress upon Dooly that all he had was it her disposal ' I got new clothes, he said, "just before I came I have all I can possibly vi me to eat and drink, and much more, and, for books there's a whole ancient library at my service ' what can I want more" Its just a mere luxury to hand the money over to join, Doory 1111 thinking, Doors, for he had got by this time to address the old woman by her husband's pet name for her, "the res nobody 1' this wall, cup the oonseen Lord himself', loses jet man she wee! as you an mc Weel ken I you an' lum w and shall e ) cr last crust was me an' I'm only Lucia' c o' yes um good will when ye tak sac long is 1 h be anything Thus adjured the old woman made no dith cult) , if her husband was satisfied, she was satisfied His time was now drawing nigh for the return of Lord tongue, but Uppio had learned only his at once, and nothing concerning his action But, as if she foresaw it, there was a restless light 111 her eyes When Stephen Kennedy said that Eppie had gone back to her L,iandpucnt.s, a faint hope revived in his bosom , he knew nothing of the late passage bear even the lovers and his friends He but knew that she was looking sad is if she had lost her lover, unfit seemed to him as if now she might it be 1st admit him to be of some service to her Sep nation had begotten 1901 and more gentle thoughts of her in his heart, he was only to forgive every) thing, and believe nothing serious against lies, if only she would let him love her runs The modesty of true love had however, restrained I Jinn from throwing himself 111 her way until 1 The sole right of publication in Queensland of "Donal Grant has been purchased by the Brisbane A Newspaper Company, Limited. some time should have elapsed, allowing her to forget a little He haunted the house, however, in the hope of getting a peep of her and when she begin to go again into the town he saw her repeatedly following her for the sake of being near her, but taking care she should not see him, and, paid) for our herself absorption, he succeeded in escaping his notice At length however, one night rather more til in a month after her return, he tried to summon up courage to accost her. It was a warm lovely), moonlit night, half the street floored with quaint black shadows from the gables, the other shining like the sand on the seashore the yellow light On the moon, side the people standing at then doors could recognise each other's face but in the shadow it was not easy to tell who was passing at a little distance Eppic had gone into the hiker s whose d tighter was her friend, Kennedy had seen her go in and stood in the sh widow, waiting for her to carry. out, and till but deep mud to speak to her that night if he could be rein trod within a good while, but one accustomed to wait for the, rush of the sea learns patience At length she appealed By this time, however, though not his patience, Kennedy s courage li id no early ev upon facts, and when he saw her coming towards him he stepped mules in archway, let her pass, and followed flesh All at once a resolve, winch yet was no resolve, awoke him He did not know how or whence it e one He said it was as if some one-not that he felt anything had taken him by the shoulders and pushed him up to her She started when he stepped in front of her, and gave a little cry ' Dinna be felt at me, Eppic," said Kennedy) "I w ulm hurt a han overhead I had rather be skinned nose !

She began to cry "Glen anything of my power wild tak the grief also' ye, Eppic, ' said Kennedy, ease but to speak-yo main ken that 1 in no gain' to ask you to marry me, for that I ken ye wadna care about, but then I can be a free to you or yours, or may be allocated anything to help i j or table I'm ready to lay me the dirt afore ye I hue nee care for myself' on) man, an' there fore mann do some thing for somebody)- an' wha sac soon as yourself, Eppley ' For sole answer, Eppie went on crying She was far from happy She had nearly, she thought, persuaded herself that all was over between her and Lord Toi give, and she felt almost as if she could, but for shame, have allowed Kennedy to comfort her as an old friend But everything in her mind was so confused, and over thing around her so miserable, that there was nothing to be done but cry And as she continued crying, and they were in a walled lane into which no windows I looked, Kennedy, in the simplicity of his heart, and the desire to comfort her who little from him deserved comfort, came quietly but with throbbing heart up to her, and putting his arm around her, said again "Dinna be heard at me, Eppie I'm a manpower can be fit to do ve on) him Its no as my am, Eppie, I wad presume to do anything for you, but only as an auld green, sam to take the dog off o' ye Are j o in want of any thing ' Ye man had a heap of table, I weel ken, we' yer grandfather s mischance, an' it's not easy to ttn'cistan'things may well be turntn'scnice wife, but be sure of this, that as lang s ray neither has anything shall be blyth to share the same was you an ) ours " He said his mother, but she had nothing save what he provided for her " Thank ye, Stephen, ' said Eppie touched with his goodness, but there's nee necessity.

Lpp o ! he called in a time in which siding nation blended with surprise Eppie uttered a little shock, and ran to him. But he pushed her as i) "My lord said KoineIv, the lass will nine offer of) help I 'will doubt there's line but eased em please her But I swell by God, my lord, given to do her any winn,, 111 no use, night and day, till I have made ye repent it " Go to the devil' said relate, "what have you to do with her Speak out like a man and show your light, and you may take her I replied) prepared to go li lives with you " Again Eppic would have clung to him, but again he pushed her away ' Oh, my love!

He had while absent been able enough to get on without her, but no sooner was he home than, in the west) lack of any thing else to interest him, the feelings he had begun to think, without knowing whether to lament or rejoice over them, on the point of being lost, began to revive, and he had set out to gain, if possible, a sight of Eppie, whom, when he saw in such close i el tions, us it appeared with her old lover, in at a sense of unpardonable injury possessed him, and next the conviction that he was, as he called it, is madly in love with her as ever Satisfied that the interview had not been of her st eking, neither was to her satisfaction, he felt the tide of old tenderness come streaming back over the ghastly sands of jealousy, and here the) parted he had made with her an appointment to meet the next night in a more suitable spot Before Lppic centered the house she did her best to remove all traces of the varied emotions she had undergone, but she could not help the shining of her eyes, for the joy lamp is lighted on her bosom shone through them Donal was seated by her go and father leading , he had not the opportunity of leading to him many things of which the old man had no idea ( li it such ousted I believe those last days of sickness and weakness were among the most blessed of Ins hCe things could be done for a man like him which could not be done for even many a good man with ten times his education He looked up when Eppic entered, md the same moment Don in know the secret not from her face, but from Andrew s, the grandfather read it from her sand Donal read it to win his She has seen Poiguel' he said to himself, and added, "I hope the old man will be dead before she comes to worse ' ' flO 111 CON UNIT t) As coming) mining matters are progi casing favourably) The stampers of only one of the two or washing machines are kept in motion, as there is no water in the dam of the last plant ex cited Thirteen claims are now being we or Led on what is considered payable stone 'There appl n to be vast bodies of stone situate yield from 15dwt to 13d t per ton and is the reefs around and not difficult to work they will afford profitable employment to then how an s for many cars the Billaiat Jubilee Camp at) are proceeding with th awakened general) No alum in gold his been found is yet it is, however, generally believed that where there are so many) gold bearing reefs there must be alluvial runs not far distant Ki J l the kidneys health) and unobstructed with Hop Bitters and nounced not fear sickness Read
