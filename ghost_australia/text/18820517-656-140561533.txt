MO-ril-KONU. ' What dost tlion here, Thou dusky courtier, Within tlio pinky palace of tho 10 Hero is 110 bed for Ihee, No honeyed spieery, — But for tlio golden bee, And tho gay wind, and 1110 Its sweetness grows, ltnvcr, thou dost forget ; Seek thou tho passion-llowcr Bloom of ono twilight hour. Haste, thou art lato 1 Its hidden savors wait. Por theo is spread Its soft, purple coverlet ; Moth, art thou sped ? — Dim as a ghost I10 flics Through tho uiglit mysterios.' — Miss Hutouinsoh.
