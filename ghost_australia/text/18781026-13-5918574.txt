IT A TA'. (FROM OUR OWN OOltUtarOVDEST ) ROME Age 20 his wonderful old Rome wonderful new Louie too for that matter '-is so admitted By the capital of the world of art and in a more especial manner of sculpture to it I think it will be not uninteresting to your readers if I seize the opportunity afforded by the season during which political life is suspended as much as that of i h) benting airman is in the matter to give them some account of what our sculptors li ive recently been done One of the most notable of these is Mr Warrington Wood a native of the town of vi aviation in L incnshire I should be justified perhaps by the verdict of the highest art authority in 1 once the celebrated Academy of St I are in saying the most notable for that venerable and learned body has just conferred the eagerly sought and rare)) given honour of membership on our countryman Mr VA good For the most part Roman artists are gre glances They may be found clustered to them two or three different localities, all of them in positions not for distant from each other, in what may be called the West end of Rome, the quarter of the modern city mainly inhabited and frequented by the foreign v visitors Rut Mr W Wood has established his studio and residents far away from the of fashionable haunts in the immediate neigh bourhood of the Lateran he had a strong temptation to do so Some of your readers possibly may have heard of the Marchese Cam) aim and his once celebrated museum of Etruscan antiquities He built the edifice which is now the studio of Mr Wood, for his museum in the midst of a delightful garden It is an edifice of considerable architectural pretension and I makes decidedly the finest and handsomest Sculptor s studio in Rome the story of the Marchese Campana a rum and of the dispersion of his museum, due, it is said rather to the treachery and injustice of the old Papal Government than to any fault of his own is one which it is beside the purpose to tell here Suffice it that the lovely garden, with its then useless building was to be sold, and that Mr Wood made the purchase It was thought a bold and somewhat hazardous step at the time for a young sculptor to place himself so far out of the us asbestos those who are likely to become patrons But it must be supposed that Mr Wood thought that he had it in him to make his studio sufficiently attractive to bring such visitors as he cared to see there all the way to the Lateran And if such was his feeling on the subject the re suit has abundantly justified his prevision I cannot attempt to describe to you, or even to mention, the numerous works among which the visitor finds himself on entering the magnificent studio several of which are in marble, awaiting a purchaser, while the more important are the plaster casts of the works which have been sent home to their various owners-like ghosts still haunting the spot where they were first called to her The most recent work which W arnngton M Wood has completed is also the most am bitions and the most important he has ever execute!, a sure indication of his rising reputation and consists of three colossal statues and a series of subjects in bass i chew, for the adornment of a new art gallery at Liverpool, we Inchhasbeen with more than princely) magna licence presented to that city by Sir Andrew B Vi alker, the mayor of Liverpool One of the three colossal statues, an emblematic figure of Liverpool, is placed on the top of the building, while equally colossal sitting figures of Michael Angelo and Raphael are placed one on each side of the principal entrance The order was a truly royal one, and well has the sculptor justified the confidence which was reposed in him The opinion in Rome as to the high merit of the work was unanimous and it is pleasant to know that our Roman art verdict has been entirely ratified by opinion at home His lasso relien "surround the upper part of the exterior of the building on three sides On the front are two compositions, each 34ft in length by 4ft high That to the right of a spectator facing the building represents King John presenting the first charter to the burgesses of Liverpool, A D 1207 The ancient castle is seen in the background The King is surrounded by his guards the military dress of that period being well adapted to the purposes of sculpture and the Bishop of Chester is standing on his right hand That to the left represents Her present Majesty the Queen, together with the Prince Consort, entering Liverpool on the occasion of her first and only visit to that city, A.D 18.1 the people cheering the Royal cortege fill the background The side relief to the right shows King William III embarking for Ireland at Hajlake, A D 1890 In the background are seen the ships, to which the troops are being conveyed in small boats The king is on horseback, surrounded by his staff, superintending the embarkation The length of this composition is 20ft, and the height 4ft The fourth lasso t believe represents the Duke of Edinburgh laying the foundation stone of the building The major (who is the donor), the members of the council, and the Archbishop of York are present The size of this is the same as the preceding Certainly, the entire work isoneofthefinest,if notthefinest thing of the kind that England possesses, and Liverpool is, and may well be proud of it, and of the Lancashire artist who executed it Mr Wood is now executing a statue of heroic size of Sir Andrew Walker, the magnificent donor of the art gallery This work has been subscribed for in Liverpool, and is commissioned by the town. The visitor to Mr 'Woods studio will be specially struck by a bust still in the day of the Marchioness of Breadalbane It has been modelled by the artist for the purpose of executing a full length statue of her ladyship in the character of Ruth The face is a singularly pleasing one, and the artist has caught the likeness, and the especially sweet expression of it very successfully There is also at present in Mr Woods studio a very striking model for a commemorative statue to the Hungarian patriot Deak As yet Mr Wood has only been commissioned to furnish a model for the proposed monument He was so commissioned on declining to enter into competition for the execution of the statue, and there can, I think, be little doubt that, when his sketch shall have been seen at Pesth, the Hungarians will seek no further for the commemorative statue they desire The pedestal which Mr Wood has prepared and suggested for the statue is in the renaissance style, and is adorned by two bassi dies, one of which will represent the declaration of the independence of Hungary, and the other the Queen Empress in the art of laying a wreath on Deak s coffin If the visitor wishes to see, in the marble, the very grand group of Satan and the Archangel Michael, of which only the plaster cast remains in the studio he must go to Warrington, Mr Wood a native place, to look for it, for his townsmen, bent on possessing some work of their celebrated fellow townsman, selected tina group and made it their own. A more grandi) poetical conception of the action represented it would be impossible to imagine The absolutely passionless but as absolutely resistless force with which the Archangel is smiting the abject and crouching but still defiant fiend is very fine in deed A very beautiful contrast in feeling and treatment to this is a recumbent Eve 'The first copy of this exquisitely beautiful figure is in America But the artist has produced no less than six i replicas of it at the demand of successive amateurs, and it may be safely predicted that the marble now in his studio will not be allowed to remain there long Mr Wood is essentially a classical artist, and has based his style and mode of treatment on a severe study of the ancient models But he has perceived that such following of the ancient masters should be subordinated to the necessity of making art in every) kind the representative c of its on n age And some words spoken by) Mr P H Rathbone the chairman it a dinner given to Mr. Wood on the 8th of last September at Liverpool express the truth on this subject so well that they are worth quoting -"The statue of Liverpool said the chairman in the come of his speech has been pretty freely critic used, but I am bound to say that all the criticisms against it have been so far as I know really compliments For instance, it has been said that the statue was sitting on a cotton sale and we were told that Phi di is knew nothing of cotton bales All I can say is joining the worse for Phidias I am perfectly sure that living was too treat and honest man not to have made use of cotton bales if the Greeks had been fortunate enough to have cotton balls and not unfortunate enough to have to fight for their freedom even) day of their Inca You may depend upon it that the Greeks would not have been ashamed of their daily work In no nation has there been great art when that nation had not believed in itself and the work it was doing The great I Florentine sculptors were what they were because they believed in Florence and Mr N\ arrington N\ ood deserves your thanks because although he (train from classic fount runs he believed in his own day, which has its own lessons to teach and which he had the power to put into marble line is it seems some time (the view of the matter the name of Professor Kopf one of the most distinguished of the German art colony here is well known throughout Europe, and not unknown in America On entering his studio in the Nicolo degli Incunbih which runs from the N. a B humor into the Corso the visitor will be first struck by finding himself opposite a wall absolutely covered by an extraordinary number of busts m basso relieve on circular hack grounds Borne 20in in diameter They are in 1 Master of course the marbles having gone home to those who have sat for them, but the) form a record of fast work such as perhaps, no other studio in Rome can show There are the heads of several well known personages, especially) German liner ir) men among them But even if the visitor should not recognise his) features which are known to him, it is impossible to doubt that all of them are striking likenesses The busts are in N cr) low relief, much after the manner of Donatello, and the production of such portraits is rather a specialty of Signor Koi f AA works of imagination however abound in his studio I noticed especially an Eve reclining on the grass as yet only in the clay, but which promises to be a very beautiful figure Nobody who enters Signor Kopf a studio will fail to be struck by four very grandly conceived figures recumbent, in the attitude of the celebrated figures by MichelAngelo in the Medieem Chapel at Florence They represent the four elements, under the emblematic figures of Prometheus for fire the Goddess Gala for earth, Zephyr for air, and Venus (both of the sea for water These figures constitute the principal one ments of a chimney) piece executed for Queen Olga of Wurtemberg, whose bust also Professor Koch has executed in marble, and a N ery queen like bust it is for the same Royal patroness he has produced a ' Puta, or group of the Virgin mother holding the dead Christ on her knees which is now in the Catholic Church at Stuttgart This is a very remarkable group The entire collapse of the dead figure and the boy mg pathos of the mother's sorroW indicate a N very complete master over all the resources of art A nymph shrinking in alarm from a lizard has been one of the most successful of Professor Kopfs productions It has been several times repeated for purchasers, both in Europe and America Another extremely pleasing work is an imaginative figure representing the "Jewel ler's Daughter of the well known poem by Uhl and It is less than half life size, draped in the medieval German fashion and would make an exceedingly pleasing ornament for a drawingroom or conservatory A speaking bust of the Emperor William, already in the marble though not quite finished, but which will shortly be sent to Germany, is not needed to remind one of the artists nationality Though " drinking of classic fountains, as was said of Mr Warrington Wood in the above quoted extract, Professor Kopf is a German, and characteristically shows himself to he such in his work I may refer to the Jewellers Daughter as especially indicative of this quality of the professors work There is also a fountain with three tritons sporting on the brink of the basin, executed for the Emperor of Russia, which is now at the Imperial palace of Greenbaum, of which the same remark may be made One of the most remarkable studios in Rome is that of Signor D Epinay, a British subject, though of French extraction and culture As the N îsitor w take up the long Via Sistine, leading from the Piazza Barberini to the Tniuti de Monti, the Ville de' Medici, and the Pinqian hill, he will find Signor D Epinay'ÍBtudio on his left hand, at No 59, nearly at the top of the hill Entering a room, in which several workmen are busy) on statues in different stages of their translation into marble, he will find that it is only the anteroom to several others similarly occupied, and to one little bijou of a showroom, in which several of the artists favourite Nvorka in marble reproductions are gathered together, beyond which is the pn. N ate studio in which the thoughts to be subsequently put into marble are conceived and shaped into their first expression in clay It would fill two or three letters to give a due account of all the works completed, or in different stages of progress, which divide the visitors' attention in Signor D Edina) s studio It must suffice to mention some of the most remarkable and the most recent Signor D Epinay will send three works to the Exposition Universelle at Paris, where they will be found in the British department First a statue of Her Royal Highness the Princess of Wales, the property of H R H the Prince There is another statuette of the Princess in the artists studio, dressed in a fancy costume of the period of Charles IX of France And it is impossible to imagine anything more graceful, and at the same time truly regal, in the expression and pose of the youthful yet strikingly dignified figure Her Royal Highness sat to Signor D Epinay for the portrait, and I have the means of knowing that she was very highly pleased with it One of the most interesting works in Signor D Epinay s studio at the present time is a head of Shakspeare s Ophelia lying on a flat surface amid its streaming hair It is worth while to tell the circumstance which led to the a reduction of this work, though I wish particularly to call attention to it now for another reason Signor D Epinay was at one of the fashionable French watering places where one of the common amusements of the female bathers was to faite la planchette, as they called it, i e to float on the back in the water, remaining as motionless as possible Vi eil, there was to be a great dinner, or supper, or festival of some kind, and Signor D Epinay wishing to contribute some thing on the occasion which should serve to mark his remembrance of the pleasant weeks he had spent among the society gathered together there, modelled an Ophelia drowned but floating on the water after the fashion of the planchette, in such sort that the work should serve as an engine for the adorn- ment of the table. The idea and the execution of it was highly successful And in truth it would he difficult to conceive a thing of its kind more beautiful than the head of D Epinay s Ophelia But my especial object in mentioning it now is to draw attention to the reproduction of this head, which is now in the artist's studio and this for the sake of the material in which he has re- produced it. It is of terra cotta, but coated with a very fine polished white glazing, which produces a result precisely resembling the celebrated Luca della Robbia wars of the 15th century That special art, of which Florence and other places in Tuscany still possess so many highly prized examples, was as is well known, lost when the nephews of Luca della Robbie, who practised it after him according to methods taught by him, died And it has never been rediscovered to the present day The effect is that of statues in the finest white porcelain, which, save in case of destruction by violence, is far more indestructible by the influences of weather and atmosphere than marble itself And of course it is ncics.iiril) far less costly than marble Nothing could be better than the head of Ophelia, in his may be seen in this ware in Signor Ü Epinay. studio And should he be able, with an) ceil unty of success, to produce statues or statuettes in this Robina ware, it would be a most i in portant discovery in art for basis of statuettes intended for the adornment of modern houses, with their still rooms, nothing could be better adapted than this re production of the old 13th century process It seems to have been entirely confined to the members of the Della Robbia f milly, the uncle Luca and his nephews 'though I cannot find space to enumerate even a great variety) of Statues chief) female mind nude, of extreme beauty) of his li Signor 1) Upin i) li is produced during the last the or three etna, I must not omit to notice as one of a very different kind, wind is H of the highest interest It is least of the face of Pius IX, taken immediately after his de lib, seen as it reposed on the pillow of his death bed The pleasant and many of the features is very striking The artist is about to put it into marble, but nsta will also be made, and any 1 elson desirous of possessing one should address a line to Signor Alessandro Malnien, o I Via Sistmn, who has the copyright of the cast It strikes me that if this land of the late Pontiff could be reproduced in the material of the Ophelia of which I have been speaking, thousands of copies of it would be sold Si he is the name of the last life size figure from the chisel of Signor D Epm ly It is a very lovely figure on a pedestal, with inches containing four original statuettes, and is the property of M U jnfcil, the wellknown art dealer of Paris There is one other work of which I must say a word, though it be only a passing one, to call attention to it. It is the fire of a sleeping Satjr, which was first executed in marble, but which the artist has recently re- produced in the marble called Rosso notice It is known that the quarries of this beautiful bloodied marble, lost during many centuries, haji- iTecently been rediscovered But it has been chiefly used in modern times for quite small models and tina Satyr by Signor DJ priv is the first modern work of my size in Rosso article which I have seen the wonderful expression of sleep in Destroy ly marked but lower than human features, and in every part of the crouching figure, is very remarkable
