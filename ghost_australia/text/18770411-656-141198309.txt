The ooloured plates in Dr. Bezold's book illustrate tbis very vividly, but the redder can produce a similar effect, by putting va^disk-or figure out out of blaok paper or cloth on a bright ooloured surfaoe — red, yellow, green, blue, or purple — and spreading the white tissuo paper over the whole. The 'variety of hues wh[oh the' blaok assumes is very striking, and tends deoidedly to shako one's, faith in tho popular proverb that 'iseeiOR is believing.' We know that the blaok .'is blaok, but we oannot see it as black, however earnestly, we may , endeavour to reason ourselves out of the illusion. — Boston Journal of Chemistry. ;
