William Taylor on his leaving Sydney, July 11th, 1895' When the applause which followed the reading of the address had subsided, Mr John Caldwell said he had been very unex- pected!) called upon by the ladies connected with the York street congregation and of Sydney, to present to the Rev. William Taylor a purse of gold as a manifestation of their affection for his dear wife (Applause) The ladies had only finished their working of the purse a few minutes ago, and he was therefore, having had no notice, not prepared to make a speech He thought that this was a credit to the ladies who had interested themselves in this matter, and thattho) had only done their duty in thus showing their highest respect for Mrs Taylor and her husband. He was aware that many fair daughters of Australia had received spiritual good from thommistra lions of the Rev. Mr Taylor, and it was but right and proper that they should show their esteem for Mrs Taylor, tonhomtbov were greatly indebted, in that she had so unselfishly) concurred minor husband's visit to Australia. (Applause.) He had also been requested by a lady who had been a Sabbath scholar in connection with the mother church of the Wesleyan denomination in Sydney (Prince street Chapel), to present to Mr Taylor this token of her appreciation of his services and successful labours for the welfare of the young people of New South Wales (Applause ) loo purse contained one hundred sovereigns, and the second gift was a beautiful card basket, wrought in leather The Rev William Taylor then rose, and, after the loud and prolonged applause of the audience had subsided, remarked He had almost said that all this was a work of supererogation, but he did not at all wish to convey an idea that he did not appreciate what they had done, though it was altogether out of the order of his plans and usual experiences He had never encouraged a meeting of this sort, but his motto was to go right on, and have an appointment to preach or lecture every night in the week They tried to get up a meeting of the kind in Ballarat a year and a half ago, but he told them that he would have no such demonstration in Auckland, they had a little tea, but they got it all over before preaching at 7 o'clock But as for this vast concern, it took him all aback, he had not been consulted at all in the matter, and had had an appointment to pi each to night at the Glebe Road He was, however, under very great obligations to his dear meets in Sydney and the neighbouring circuits He recognised friends who were present from different parts of the colony, he loved them all, and gave them credit for doing as much as the most He must say) that ever) where throughout his travels in this and the neighbouring colonies he has received the most savage inc kindness and sympathy from all the ministers with whom no had been acquainted (Applause.) He had received the greatest possible attention and Christian love from all the families in which he had sojourned He had had the pleasure of knowing that God is gracious Spirit had been manifested small places to a greater or less extent which it had been his onulogo to visit (Applause) He had had the pleasure to know that ei ei) where in the order of Providence that the God who had sent him bad graciously) accompanied him with His presence and Spirit While he had not sought the praise of men-for his reputation, his all, was committed to secure of God more than twenty years ago yet he had received sympathy), kindness, and liberality) beyond what he ever could have expected Although it had been his almost untenable practice to decline offers of financial aid and gifts, jet he could not do so on this occasion because it was given on behalf of his wife He did not know how much the purse contained, but he knew she deserved it all, though it were full and running over (Applause ) Mr. Caldwell and well said that but for Mrs Taylor, you would never have seen Mr Taylor She had as great an anxiety in the work of God in which he was engaged, as for as her heart, Sympson), and self denial was concerned, as he had She never yet said "sta),' but always go where duty called (Applause) On one occasion in New York city when, through the impru- dence of some parties in out-door preaching, a municipal Chiltern was secured, and when, nevertheless, it became duty, as he believed, to preach to the masses regard loss of the order of those high in authority , when it was believed that his life would be imperilled from the mob, he consulted his wife whether it was best, under the circumstances, to go, said she, " Go, of course, and I will go with you ' (Applause) In the early days of California, when the gambling saloons were all open and crowded to overflowing on the Sabbath and when it was thought to be perilous to the death to sing them out of their sons and preach to them the Gospel, he went and jong them out, and his wife always went along with time and heir ed him ( Applause ) The reverend gentleman then narrated how that in compliance with a suggestion made by) Mrs Ta)lorhohad determined upon visiting England, Europe, and Palestine, for personal improvement and ultimate usefulness He also explained i. ' "L ""T0111 solicitations of a colonist from Australia, warns he met in Canada, that he had been induced to extend his travels to these colonies (not for pleasure simply, but in the way of duty and that his wife, overcoming her natural reluctance had acquiesced in his design He had own engaged, as the) know, for a little over two years, in Victoria, Yandama, New South Wales, Queensland, and New Zealand and he expected to sail for South Australia Z *"'D'T?W His business was not to preach a new Gospel or to advance now theories, and yet, as he believed, there were specific points embraced in his providential mission His aim was to contribute as much as he could by his as if debts of"' "the Model Preacher," to restore to so much the original Model for Gospel preaching clear- less, earnestness, Titeralness, naturalness, and appropriate near (Applause) Of course, there was a great deal of neatness and clearness in the pulpits of the different do flight" of Chains, but, without designing it, through the learning of metaphysicians, the Gospel had, SfniTT , .
