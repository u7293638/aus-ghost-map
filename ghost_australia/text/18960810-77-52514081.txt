St. Lawrence, 7th August, 1890. Typhoid ia a dispuse of bacilli, typhoid bacilli ; and the bacilli v>e find in human excre- ment, and in drinking water fouled by auch excrement. It is probable that no man or woman ever takes typhoid except by swallow- ing some typhoid bacilli. They may bc swallowed, us wc have said, in drinking water, or they may be flying about thc air in the neighbourhood of typhoid excrement, and may bo swallowed with mouthfuls of air. What then √çB tho first and last commandment of typhoid prevention ? "Cleanliness; personal and public cleanliness," It is all there. If wc keep ourselves clean : if wc keep our drink- ing water clean ; if we keep our closets and our drains, and kitchens, sculleries, gardens, streets, and towiiB entirely clean, typhoid will be practically as great a stranger to most of us as is the ghost of King Solomon or the shade of tho extinct Deinotbcrium.-Hospital.
