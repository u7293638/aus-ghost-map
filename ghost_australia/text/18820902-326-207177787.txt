AN OUTSPOKEN PREACHER. The ,e Kyneton Guardian" records some of the incidents of a revival mission of the Rev. John M Neill, BA. In his message last evening1 Mr M£Neill said that he was sometimes asked whether it was sinful to attend quadrille assemblies or dancing classes. He was not going to.say whether it wns wrnrnr or nor. but his text told him that thev should be " sealed with the Holev Spirit of promise," and have " the earnest of their inheritance" within. He would give a cheque for £50 il they could produce anyone who was filled with the Holy Ghost and yet attended dancing assemblies. If a man bad the earnest of bis inheritance with him, and was full up of the Holey Ghost, it would take a very strong rope and a powerful locomotive to drag him into a dancing room where people went spinning round and round like so many idiots, and it would be hell to him until he could get out again. The preacher also indulged in parable. He represented the Lord as having lost some of His flock, and as saying to the angel Gabriel—" Gabriel, just go down to the world and see if you can bunt them up." Gabriel started on his mission, and reported, " Lord, I hear the shuffling of feet in here," when the Lord replied, " Oh ! none of my flock could be found there ; that is a ball-room." Mr M'Neill concluded this illustration by expressing the hope that the Lord would never send Gabriel to look for him in a ball-room.
