The Forton Ghosts. An extraordinary affair took place in tbe early hours of the morning of January 25 at Forton Barracks, the headquarters of the Portsmouth divi s;on of the Royal Marine Li^ht Infan try, a non-commissioned officer being shot by a sentry as the result, it is thought, of sheer fright. Forton has had the reputation of being a most fruitful nrovider of sensa tions. Close by is a burying place, wherein lie the bodies of hundreds of French prisoners, whose ghosts are said to perambulate the vicinity every now and again. It was this belief, it may be remembered, which led to a inisbapto a sentry a few months ago. : Early yesterday morning Private Sutton provided yet another Sensation. At 2 o'clock Lance-Corporal A. V. Davis, with four privates, were relieving guard, and when they approached the Pay Office, where Sutton was on guard, the latter ^suddenly presented his rifle and fired four shots ir: rapid succession. Two of the bullets took effect on Davis, one grazing his head and taking ;ff some of his hair, and the other pene trating one of- his thighs, but fortunately missing the bone and arteries. On hearing the reports the guards charged Sutton with fixed bayonets, and made him a prisoner The sentry, quietly submitted. He maue no state meat, and has refused to give any ac count as to what induced him to fire. He is a young recruit, aud thi* was the first time of his doing ' sentry go.' Luckily lib markmanship is not of a high order. Otherwise his four shots would probably have resulted in four funerals. ' It is believed that -some of the older men had been amusing themselves by telling him tales of that pur ticular place being_ haut) i:ed, with a view of frighten ing him. and that on hearing the ad vancing footsteps he fired the shots out or' funk.' ? Davis was one of the Marines who took part in the Benin expedition. Though badly hurt, his condition is no-, at all critical.â€” 'Daily Mail.'
