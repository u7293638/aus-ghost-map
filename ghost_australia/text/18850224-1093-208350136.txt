A Headless â‚¬liost. A headless ghost has made its appearance near Epbrata, in Pennsylvania, where itexcites considerable curiosity and alarm. There is no donbt whatever as to its being a veritable ghost. It was first seen by the Rev. Daniel Witner when returning home one evening from the sehoolhouse in Manor township, where he had been preaching. Mr. Witner had gone but a short distance when lie saw coming to wards him what he supposed to be a man carry ing a lantern. On the nearer approach of the object he was, to use his own expression, "almost paralyzed with horror" to find that it was a moving body without a head. His terror was still further increased on seeing the head carried in one of the hands. " The fear ful object," he says, "took its place by my side, and accompanied me to my very door. How I managed to retain consciousness and reach home I don't know. It was the most fearful experi ence I ever had, and I hope I may never have the like again." The reverend gentleman's statement is fully corroborated by two ladies and a Mr. Kaufman, who from a distance of about a hundred yards saw the ghost meet Mr. Witner and walk away with him, but were too appalled by the spectacle to interfere. The ghost has since been seen several times, and the nerves of the inhabitants of the district are described as being in "a frightful state of tension." It is somewhat refreshing in these days of vulgar "spiritual manifestations" to hear of a good old-fashioned ghost without a head, of whose blood-curdling qualifications there is no mistake. These headless ghosts were once common enough in England (says St. James's Gazette), but have of late years become almost extinct. Perhaps they have all gone to America.
