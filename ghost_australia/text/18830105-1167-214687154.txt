I would let that go with whisky. It |is elcarly taught that tilioso bodies arc temples for tho HOLY GHOST, and we ought to be careful to keep them pure. I do not think it is becoming for it son of the Most High to be using that filthy weed, and I have an idea that many a man that uses tobacco is led thereby info drinking, I think it belongR to the old nature, antl I would let it go. How is it. with men who have no work, using tobacco ? I don't ecu how they can afford it; put it on that ground. I do not think it keeps the body iu a healthy state. I think we ought to be very careful about the body, because it 19 so identified with the soul."
