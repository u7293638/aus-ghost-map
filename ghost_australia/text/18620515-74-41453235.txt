LAUNCESTON EXAMINER. f/ursday/, Ain/ I 5, 1 8(12. ASOIrllEl? GHOST. LAST year an inlsure affecting Australia made its appearance for a moment in the record of debate, but as time rolled on it entirely disappeared, and left no trace of its existence. What is the meaning of the following telegraph from London dated 12th April, 1862?-"The second, reading of the Australian Government Act Amendment Bill took place in the House of Lords. There was a long dis cussion." Can anybody tell us anything about it? Is the Imperial Parliament really to rescue us from the consequences of our own conceit, folly, and extrava gance? Are those powers which have been used for evil to be recalled? Is that liberty, which has only been abused, to be resumed by the parent State? A " long discussion"-surely that means something. We shall await with im patience the arrival of the next monthly mail, unless some one in the secret will inform us of the purport of the Bill referred to.
