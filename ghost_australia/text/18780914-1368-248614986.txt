These words only increased his if right; but I would hear no further pailey ; so pulling the key from my pocket, I fitted it with some difficulty into the lock, turned it, and pushed the door' opon. Although, as I .believed, the hoube had been closely shut up for months, 'I was immediately conscious of a breath of wind,, damp, saU, ^n^ ^^nging, playing npon me. ^n^poe^a^E^rant felt it too, for Jft ; fihuflderedand pufild la^ coat closelj^iolind him^but he lo^'pot a moment in depositmfff^my parcel on the gi^l^d—the pair ofcabdleB, box of ma.t che^y madw)iAof wood; and dark Jantfern which he brought witK°^hira~afidY3h beating a t-peedy af «y reiterated deeire^h^ijgeieyt J wtlked the heavy dpftf .with ;iny shoulders.

In our .most serious moments we are always-open to a touch of the ridiculous' aa3 "grotesque ; and. I protest to you 4hat -as 11 stood i alone in ! that cavernous*hall, with my heart bep.ting almost audibly within me, I thought jof Mr. Pickwick and Lie adventures with -ithe dait lantern, and emiled in invoiun- 'tarily at the reminiscence. Then taking 'my lantet-h inone hand) and gathering Hp the articles which my servant had left from the floor with the other, I started to ascend the stairs. I had scarcely moved when the breath of damp fait air again iblew over me, more powerfuj. this, time, raising the hair from .thy che&rt; and fluttering; the paper in which some of my thing were wrapped ; and at the samo time l heard, as plainly as l have heard ^nything in my life, the pattering sound of 9 pair of feet—small naked,. fept.. they., teemed to my hstening.ear —dropping one. after the other just in;ftontof.vie. -i'.I. ^topped, low&red.thp; lanterp, endV^azedintently in (id vance, hut could seeaothing^ the footBteps bad stopped top ; hut .^vhen { mo ved again, they reci®Mij<}ed-7^>atter latter; just the soliiid qne. hears'tit ^bedime or in early morning on a nursery-floor.

BallingJt^e lantern to it, I foutod it to le a'J^i&ut; .of a woman, young and beautifm, dressed a rosecoloiircd brocaded taegtu, with a gray silk quilted petticoat, from Tinderneath 'Which peeped her grey-silk stockings with red cloel^, and her tiny shoes with high red heel's.' Her dark c.hesnut hair, which tho wore Without powder, was massed upon her fbreh'exd, and fell in luxurious curls over her shoulders. The face was one of muclr beauty combined with great power, the eye gazing out -from the canvas at me as I looked at them with a -glance of superb scorn. Again and again vt' returndi .fej e -contemplation of this pic- \--mt. as life, -iw iUr holding the t>ff from further io thrdugh aporjibn of the iorn tapwtryj I perceived 'loffieth'ing'like ihe ouuioe of a door ; and puUipg. -the masked curtain aside. I discovered a small squpre exit,, fitting most ingeniously ibto the wood-' w-ork of the wall, passing through which I found myself about midway, on the epiral staircase, .which, as ^prion (h js told yon, traversed the building from the roof to the basement, with a meaosof commu-* nicstion to -each of the difterent floors. It was At once obvious «io mo that if any trickery were to be expected at all, it would be carried out most effectually by this means ; and I took the precaution on my return, not merely to turn the rusty key in the lock on the inside, but to barricade it with a heavy ottoman which stood in the centre of the back room. 'I returned to the front drawing-room, where the fire was now blazing, brightly, shut and locked the folding-doors behind me. At that moment : roy senses were clear, my mind was well balanced. I lai l iny watch on the table, and checked: the beating of my pulse by it—seven ty-- five to the minute, its ordinary rate. Since I had first heard the pattering noise on the stairs, I had felt no fear, though the strange impression of the portrait ib. the further room still haunted me unpleasantly. It glared upon me from the pages of my, book which I had taken up, and was about to' lay 'down in despair, when the iron tongues of the neighbouring clocks clanged out the hour of midbight.' The sound had scarcely ceased, when I lieard a long low cry, a cry as of a child in agony. " It. seemed to rise . in the basement, ind to grow in vehemence and excitement as. it came .sweeping, up the stiirs until it found articiilatioti— "Help! Help!" —in a piercing child? like shriek. I seized my revolver and sprang to my feet. Then, as if at a blast from the damp salt -air which came whirling into the chamber again, the doer flew open, the candles were extinguished and the flames of the burning logs threw a lurid light over the room. " Jlelp ! help !" The piercing appeal was echoing on the landing. And now came again the pattering of the childish foot, this time inta.t|Io roonj and cloae by the spot where I stood. They passed me close, quicker and more agitated thac they had bepn'at;first; andtaffcer.them Vere more footsteps, heavier this, time—those of- a man. with a strong determined stride. " Help ! help 1" The cry waxed fainter. It'seerued to (JUBS through in the further room, the door swung Jieavily back of its own accord, and I sank into my chair with the cold drops of sweat standing on my brow, ' ^ " ^ ; ; ' How lo'bg I ^imained 'thus, I know, not. I imagine, however, i;hat I required but a few seconds to steady my nerves and regain, my composure"; for when the clocks outside 6l rack the half-hour I ,was sufficiently myself to, be aware .of the advantage of a light,' and was creeping about for a match-box, with'the intention of re lighting the extinguishedjiandle. I dropped on my hands- and kners,. for I thought! heard the box roll under the table,; wheb -1 was 'startled with the sound of three loud -knoclie—loiitl, but- muffled as it were hy distance-r-heavy and strong, with an. interval between.eaqhthe sound coming .apparently from the basement' ; floor, yet far in the rear of the house.
