The V. Wellington At her fit of the 27th has the following on the subject it was very currently rumoured in town yesterday that his Excellency the Governor had determined to put a veto on the purchase of the Manawatu block. It was even and that, on Monday, his Excellency had an interview with Parakylia and others of the recusants, and. had endeavoured to persuade them to give their consent, but without avail. On making inquiries in the proper quarter we were informed that his Excellency does not intend to restrain the purchase Same paper of December 3rd adds Dr. Featherston goes up to the Manawatu district to-day to make arrangements for the purchase of the long-coveted block on Wednesday next We trust he may be successful, but we doubt it. There have been many indications that the payment of the Â£25,000 for the land will not finally settle the question, and time, instead of smoothing over the difficulties, has only rendered them greater. The Machines Returned to PusovnKiru.-Undor date November 25th, the correspondent of the Wellington Independent writes from Camp te Whenuku as follows -The rebels have again returned to Pungurehu, the village from which Major M'Donnell drove them some six weeks since. On the 22nd, Captain Ross went out with a party consisting of about fifty Europeans and the same number of Maories, his orders were to patrol the right bank of the river, and, if possible, to ascertain whether the report which we had heard of the rebels, having returned, was correct. On his way across the plain, and when close to the destroyed village of Kingston, he saw about fifteen of the rebels running across his front ; a slight skirmish, ensued, but no damage was done on either side. It certainly was a providential escape for the Hauhaus, as they at one time were not more than fifty yards off. Major M Connell has since learned from W iremu (a chief who has lately come "in) that Fox and his party, about forty strong, have come back to fight. With the small number of men Major O'Donnell has at present at this post he cannot do much, as the most he can take into the field would be about 100, and half of these are Moones.
