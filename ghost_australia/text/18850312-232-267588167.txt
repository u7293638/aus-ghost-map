TO THE EDITOB OP THE CODBIEB. SRN,—I would seek an inch or two in your columns to refute a einglexlause in the somewhat lengthy and abnormal epistle of your correspondent "Phllo," ab hoc el ab hoc. He says—" I do not know of any passage in the Bible claiming for It as bsing the words of the Almighty Father of. the universe, either inspirationally or orally." That 'PhiIo"does not know much of the Bible IB, alas, -only too evident from his letter, but on the foregoing point I may be able to illuminate him a little. It is written—" All Scripture is given by inspiration of God " (2 Timothy iii., 15). " Prophesy came not in old time by the will of man, but holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost" (2 Peter 1., 12). "As God spake by the mouth of His holy prophets since the world began" (Luke 1., 70). Words whioh the Holy Ghost teacheth " (1 Cor. it., 13).- "God bath spoken by the mouth of HiB holy prophets since the world bi>gan "<Acts iii.. 21). I might add more, but there is.no'need—"The" natural jnaa reoelveth cot the- things of the spirit of God, for they .are foolishness unto Him, neither can He know them, because they are spiritually discerned" (1 Cor. ii,( 14). Philo's " letter has confirmed me in a conviction I have had for. some time, viz :— That when opposers of divine, inspiration confine themselves to the ground of human reason and logic tbey have " a ehow of wisdom," but when they endeavor to make Scripture contradict Itself, or dabble in its doctrines and principles, they only snobeed in. manifesting, their own ignoranoe. The first Napoleon- once gave a home thrust to some of bis officers, who bad been very freely ventilating their unbelief in the Bible. Said he—>'Gentlemen, it seemo- to me yon make amendB for not believing the ' Bible, by belUvlng everythlng elap." There is nothing more credulous than tbe incredulity of soepticiam.—Yours, &c.;, S.J.B.C.
