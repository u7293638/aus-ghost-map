TOONGABBIE ( From our own Correspondent.) For some time back, considerable dissatisfaction has been brewing over the mansions of the dead.'' "Each member of the community appears to think they have a vested interest in that particular property known as the Toongabbie Cemetery, and therefore have watched clostly and carefully for the annual report and balance sheet. It is. very problematical whether the directors will declare a dividend oat of the funds in these days of depression, yet nevertheless the public want to know is the concern paying, or does it want reconstructing. Toongabbieites are a law and order party, and the law they will have carried out decently and in order. Ho ghost, they say, shall rise from "that hallowed spo$( to reproachlts custodians for breaches of law, either mortal or divi&e; ; and the Government Gazette mu9t yearly set their minds at rest regarding the ponnds,. shillings, and pence. Grand reports continue to -, reach us about; the fabulous finds at Eaglehawk, and several prospectors are out around here. I guess if the Secretary of Mines distribute! a few 30s each around here, the recipients would not trouble him about the free pass and miner's right. We have had a kerosene shale boom, a marble boom, a coal boom, and why not a gold boom ? I - am informed the creamery is going its butter this year, -AKeH—dduor-Toongabbie 1- I—shall surprised if that ijes not grow into a profitable concern yet. It is rather amusing sometimes to hear clergymen preaching about our legislators as if they were children of tho devil. Does it never strike them that our senators have a large people of ail creeds, from all nations, and of vast and varied interests to watch over, and that according to their light they are equally as earnest in striving to promote the people's welfare as the parish parson in his limited sphere, amongst his own creed in his own small parish.
