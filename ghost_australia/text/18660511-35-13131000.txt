IHK EDUCATIONAL FRANCHISE. Hou6E e«* COMMONS, Fr.iinuAiiY 20. JUR CIAV rose to move for leave to bring in a bill to «extend the elective franchise for cities and boroughs m England and Wales He said that, though he had no ?expectation that his motion for leave to introdiite the bill would be refused, yet, as the proposal he was about to make was quite a novel one, he should be "wanting in respect to the House if he did not at the first stace of the bill endeavour to explain its prin- ciples His bill did not mtcrfere in any w îy with any existnig franchise, but contemplated that anv man ol full figo, not otherwise ebsqualihcd, and not hiving a .vote by any other title, should hav e the right to de mond to be submitted to mi ex imination by the Civil Service Commissioners, and, on passing that cxamina to then satisfaction, to receive a certificate Ihat certificate, upon being handed to the town clerk in a coiporate town, and m a non corporate town to som" person exercisuig analogous functions, would entitle the holder to be placed on the register It had been suggested that the words "full nge, which meant twenty-one years, should for tins purpose be taken to mean 25 years, and if it should appear advisable to make thnt change he could see no ob|ection to it As it waB desirable to provide against the possibility of having n Bort of v agrant population of electors, the hill would enact that n mon before claiming to be examined mubt have resided six months m the plate for which ho claimed to vote Here, again, if the House should be of opinion that the term of six Months should be altered to 12 months he would not object, though, for his ow n part, he thought tho term of six months better On his leaving the place TV here he had resided, tins elector would be bound to give notice to the town clerk, who would return to rum his certificate and îemove him from the register Ho "would not be liable to a second examination, but he "would not be able to claim to be placed on the register of the place where he went to live untd he had resided there either BIA or tw elv e months, as the House night determine 1 here w as no serious mechanical dit £ cul tv, he liad good íeason to believe in the w ay .f his plan In 1839 he served on a committee to consider the working of the Civil Servite Lxamina tions, and one of the subjetts of inquiry was how fur it "waa practicable to allow cverv man in the country, "without nomination, to demand to be examined as to his competency for different positions in the Civil feen ice The idea toiitcinpl ited a laige number ol examinations-lareei, probablv, than would be re quired under the bill now proposed, and icrtainly ol a mnch more elaborate character A gentleman con- nected with the Civil bervice Commission, who gave evidence before that committee, said he saw no diffi- culty in the task suggested, and Mr llorac c Mann put in a plan by which lie proposed to carry it out Other gentlemen connected with the Civil Service Commission w ere, he understood, ol the same opinion He was assured, too, that those examinations would involve no vciy great expense, and tint the expense .would be fully met by a fee of one shilling, pay able by each candidite on piesenting himself for examina- tion, and by n further lee of one shilling and sixpence on the receipt of Ins certificate The examination winch ho should propose would bo very nearly the same as that exacted from the lower outdoor othcers of the Customs, consisting of w ritmg spelling, mid the first io write and spell, his abdity to read might be taken for granted It was debirable that thfcsc examinations should be conducted entirely by the Civil Service Commissioners Anything like local examination "would be sure to excite lealousics It would be saul in one place that only Conserva'ivc candidates for ex- amination, anti in another only Liberal candidates, passed The Civil Service Coiiimiisioncrs would, therefore, appoint from time to time in every city where there were candidates for examination an officer whose duty it would be to hand to each candidate sealed papers, íeceived from the Com- missioners, to rcteive from the candidates then ?written answeis, and to send them sealed to the Com- missioners Tins olhccr would also be required to read three or four short easy sentences, w Inch the candidates would write down, ns an exercise ni writing and spelling This plan nffected tw o classes of persons-. those who had already acquired the necessary know - ledge, and those who tould acquire it in a very short tune. The first class mcluded men in v arious posi- tions m life, many of whom had not a vote troni accident or because they cared little about it, such as clergymen, members of the learned professions, teachers-of whom there were ¿1,000 in England and "Wales-the commercial class, who numbered nearly 60,000 persons, and assistants m shops Ihe greater part ol them would be able to pass the ex- amination, but v cry lew had votes, and his proposal "would, he was assured, be considered a great andsufii cient boon as far as they were concerned But beyond these there was another class which could pass the examination without any trouble whatever—he meant the best of the working class, who formed no incon- siderable number Now, all these classes, from the highest down to these working men, every one so to speak, had expressed a willingness to be admitted to the franchise, and their admission was contem- plated by "fancy franchises," as they were called in most undeserved derision Those franchises, however, if his proposition became law, would be unnecessary With regard to the working men, there had been expressed in almost every speech on the hustings a willingness to admit the best of that class to the franchise ; and he proposed the way ho had explained of making the selection, if not as a perfect plan, at least the best that could be devised He now came to the class who had not acquired sufficient knowledge to enable them to pass the examination, but who must acquire it at no distant day—he meant the bulk of the working classes He believed he had as large an experience as almost any man in the country of the cost of these men in pains and labour to acquire the amount of knowledge he had described, for, from the commence- ment, he had watched with the greatest anxiety, not without a knowledge of the candidates themselves, and with great interest in their success, the result of the examinations for the lower places in the Hull Cus- toms from that experience he could state, with the greatest confidence, that any ordinary working man, or one somewhat above him in position—say, the son of a small shopkeeper- although he might master these examinations, must sacrifice to the school- master his leisure hours, few and uneasy as they weie, for three or four months, before he could obtain the amount of knowledge required The man .who did this to obtain the franchise he, for one, would welcome to it and he would trust him freely, not on account of his little smattering, but because of his earnestness and industry in acquiring it The best guarantee for the trustworthy character of a voter was his anxious desue to obtain a vote As to those who already had the knowledge required, he did not con- sider this a perfect test In such a matter probably no test could be perfcet, but, as a test of social posi- tion and trustworthiness, that which he proposed was, at least, ts good as the possession of a ¿10 oi £7 house But, with regard to those who weie un- educated and who must acquire this knowledge, he looked upon it as n test of something v ery much botter-as a test of earnestness lhere was a very general belief m that House and in the country that it wa» absolutelv necessary to do something in the ?way of extending the elective franchise lhere was a desire still more general that vvhatevei was done should have some condition of permanence , and theic , was a fear in the minds of many that this condition of I permanence could ncv ei be lound in a mere low enng of the property qualification (Hear) Nor w is that i "\ ery unreasonable, for it w as clear that if they retimed I property as the sole title to the franchise, there could be no standing, no safe resting place until they had arrived at the lowest symbol of propeity whatever that might be (Hcai, hear ) He therefore oilered I this proposi 1 as containing a condition of permanence Should it become law m the country, no man, as fur as the boroughs and cities of Lngland and "Wales w eie concerned, could have any lust cause of complaint on the score of being excluded from the franchise YS lth regard to the objections that might be urged against his proposal, he might be reminded that thirty ., ears ago an educational test w as a fav ourite idea of Lord Brougham and other Kefonneis, but it was given up as impracticable Ihis was true, but those gieat authorities proposed an educational test as the basis and sole title to the franchise It was obiected to them that in order to find a sufficiently large consti- tuency it would be necessary to have the test so low ns to produce univ eis ii suflrage , probably, the mere writing of the name would be held sufficient, and the examinations would be so numerous that the system practically could not be brought into operation Now, .whether these reasons were cogent-as to which there might be some diflerence of opmion-they ni no way applied to his scheme , because his franchise was not the basis or sole title, but only one title to a vote, and it would neither be necessary to put the standard of education low, nor did it mvolv e any impossible number of examinations He had been asked why his proposal should be confined to the towns and not extended to the counties Now, he thought he had gone to the extreme limit of what was prudent for a private member to propose , it was more htting that the counties should be dealt with by county members But beyona tins, the proposal was pot no applicable to the county as it was to the borough franchise. The inhabitants of every town hail easy nnd cheap nctes"< to the schoolmister, mil the miiil popnl ition would probably have to go so fat nnd to spend so much mone) md labour in order to icquirc the knowledge required of thora that it was quite possible in counties the scheme vveuld be inope- rative Then, again, he had been told that if one mnii'vvns to be examined all should bt examined "Why should not nil pass through the bnmo orleil > lie cntnclv difTered from that opinion Hint umll boto full into the mistake made at present- linmclv, to recognise only one title to the franchise At present, except m the eise ot treemen, pro pert) alone formed the title to the franchise, he -wished to introduce a second title-nitcl ligence, and he did not ask that intelligence should be propertied But he was told, on the one hand, that his scheme would amount to universal suffrage, and, on the other, that, though it sounded well, practically it would admit none of the working classes to the suf frage They would not take the trouble he required of them Now, m this conflict of opinion he might leave the one of these objections to answer the other, nnd console himself vv ith the belief that he hit on .1 happy medium , but, in reply to the former objection, he vv ould mike this admission, that, should this bdl become law, it wis quite possible m jcars to conn,, which none of them, he feared, would live to see, the proposil might have led to somethuig not ver j unlike universal suffrage, but it would be by gradual and safe changes, such as those under which our Constitu- tion hid grown to what it is, anil to which oin institu- tions gradiiallj and eafclv adapted themselves, much more gradually and snfclj than thev would adapt them- selves to a Mimlnr result, arrived at bj insisting on the retention ot propertj ns the onlj condition of the frau chise But it might be asked, vv here w as the permanence of the "»cheme! 1 he educational standard might be low - creel as easj n« the propcit) qualitieation lie thought not llesnw permnnence m this, thatno man could have any cause el complaint m beuig excluded from the franchise which he would not be ashamed to urge He siw permanenro also in the well-know n tendencj of examinations to become more strict rather than more ensy, but more than all, he saw the condition of permanence m the double title to ?* ote The one could take care of the other lhe householder would nlvvnvsbc opposed to the debasement of the educa tional standard, and the man who had acquired a vote for a certificate of educition would alvvnjs oppose tlie lowering of the propert} qualification, telling his neighbour to toke the same pains anil get his ?sote in lhe same iniumcr «o } e h"d dee A_g tn tho other objection, that practically the man would admit very few of the working classes, he disbelieved the asser- tion, and should be sorry indeed if it were true He believed a very large number of the most intelligent of the working classes would immediately avail them- selves of it in quite sufficient numbers to take away any ground of complaint that as a class they were un represented Others would be stimulated by the example of their fellows mid qunhfj themselves for the franchise "Why should they not take the same trouble to acquire the franchise which they took for the hard work and meagre means of a tidewaiter, or the very subordinate situation on a railroad ? His honorable friend the member for btoekport (Mr \\\ atkm) could bear lum out that these examinations m the case of between 2000 and 1000 railway servants, had been attended with the best results Why, therefore, should not the same class take as much trouble to obtain the franchise as they did to obtain their situations? Should it tirn out that but few of the working classes chose to avail themselves of the opportunity so offered them, it would be a proof that they were not really deserving of the franchise, and that their supposed smarting sense of injury at being excluded from it had no existence except m the minds of those who pro fciscil to speak on their behalf Lastly (loud and prolongod cheers), not a few gentlemen asked what nceessitj there was for doing ni) thing with rcgird to this question, as the country was prosperous and contented, and ii it weie polled from one end to the other the mniont) would be m favour of lea ing well alone (Hear, henr ) Ho believed such to be the opinions of the existing constituencies but whether that wcie so oi not it was impossible to escape the question Iheic

countr) was diderent from what it vvis at present, and when there were practical gnevanccs t® be îedressed, ncveitheless it was im- possible to escape them with honour He took their case to be tiiat of a bodv oí men, the large mnjontj of whom were unwilling to pa) a debt thej were all pledged to discharge, but in the end thej must either pi) or be dishonoured Nearly all of them, both ?within and without the House, had given pledges fiom which thej should not wish to escape, and had riiseel hopes which thej might weil be afraid to dis- appoint, ind no man could pleise himself with the belief that this was a matter he coulel shuflle off and allow to be forgotten (Hear, hear ) Let him lather consider m vv lint com it vt ould be honest and safe to pi) the tlcbt fiom which there vv is no escape (Hear, hear ) He was grateful for the patience with which tlie House lind listened to him, but he should feel thnt he liad nselesslj occupied their time unless he drew from them, ind especinllj fiom her Mnjcstj s Government, «onie expression of their opinion upon this ejbjcct (Hear, hear ) Hew is iware that the nove.lt) of his plan might startle the tunid, while its moderation might fail to satisfj the lash, but he was honestlj convmced that it was a wise ind safe measure, and were he not afraid of being chnrged .with presumption he «hould si) that it was the most wise and the most safe mensure that coulel be proposed AVhatevor wetc its idvantages or its disndvantikes, he offered the mensuies for neir consul«ation as his contribution towards the solution of the greit question of Parliamentnrj Reform , and willi sinceie difhduice, but not without hope, he left the matter in the hands of the House and of the eountrj Loud cheers ) Mr Giegoiv said that whatevei night be the judgment of the House with regard to the expediency and the practicibihtj of the bill introduced b) his lion friend, the) would all adnu* that the question was one which ue«er\ed their serious consideration, and he jouied in the hope of the hon gentlemnn thnt the opinion of her Mnjestj's Government upon the question, ns fnr ns it was formed up to thcpiesent moment, would be communicated to them in the course of the evening (Hear, hear) iho House should beni in mind that this vv as no mere effort of political dilettanteism, that the address to which the) baa just listened was not the speech of some new member anxious to obtun a name for political libeinht), but that the meisuie had been introduced by a gentleman vvho.hid been long in that House, and who íeprcsented i large and intelligent con stituenc), who lind himself taken part in all the great busmess of the House for )eirs post, and who lind brought to benr upon all questions an amount of piactical good sense and judgment which had invnri nblj caused him to be listened to vv ith attention nnd ic6pcct (Hear) Moieover, the lion gentleman had ilwnjs taken his stand in the ranks of the most ndvnneed oí the Liberil pnitj , therefore, it could not be suggested that he lind brought forward tin-, measure for the purpose of endenv ounng to stifle the question oi reform As the lion member had said, the bill might be looked at from tw o points of v iev\, first, as íegireled its own intrinsic merits, and seeondl),as regmded its iel ition to the Government bill On the first pomt, he did not hesitite to sa) that he iccepteel the bill as being good in itself, and lie felt bound to make this deelaration to prevent the supposi- tion that m -v oting m fnv our of the bill he vv is seeking to bring confusion upon the I ibeial members or to endanger the Government measure In making some observations ln^t j ear upon the bill introduced b) tlie lion member tor Leeds, agiinst which he subsequent!) voted, he expressed his intention of votuig in fivour of in) bill which should include that portion of the working classes whose enfranchise ment should be for the benefit of the country The bill now before them would cirr) into eiltet the punciple he then laid down, ind it piecisely hit the cli6s to which Earl Russell refeired in his repl) to the Scotch deputation that waited upon lum jesteida), namel) the intelligent and skilled artisans who, in consequence of the requirements of their large families, were unable to occupy £10 houses He, therefore, idvocited the passing of this bill, as it would tdm.it to the suflrngc those who should be admitted-the elite of the working classes lhe noble lord, in moving the address to Her Majest) on the opening of Parliament, said, " The greater number you add to the suffrage, the greater power you confer upon the decisions oi this House and he agreed w ith that opinion, with the qualification that those numbers should represent on the one hand the property of the kingdom, and on the other hand its intelligence and its education While the existing fran- chise provided for the representation of the property the bill of the hon member prcv ided for the represen- tation of intelligence and education It had been said that the bill of tlie lion member was too narrow, and, on the other hand, that it was too wide On the first pomt he w as prepared to admit that he did not think the bill, mite present form, would admit any very large number of the working class Had the Secre- tary for the Treasury been m his place he would have borne out the assertion Without comparing the standard of education m England with that of Ireland, he might say that his lion friend the Secretary to tho ircasïïry w as often obliged to WTUC a letter to a gentleman expressing deep regret that a young person in whom he had taken a great interest, although he had under gore many months preparation, had not succeeded m obtaining the appointment he had sought Then, on the other hand, that most valuable portion of the communitv, comprising men in business, lawyers, nUorneys, clerks and others who did not possess the franchise, were all provided for in the scheme of his hon friend, and they got rid of those fancy franchises with which they had been racking their brains during the last few vcars lhere were, then, those who saul that in a short time this franchise would be so extensive is to amount ilmost to universal suffrage Ho agreed w i h his lion friend that the period would be very long ocfore that took place , but, if ltshould come to universal suffrage, nil he could say was, " So heit (Hear, hear ) In that event, however, they would have tikcn the danger out of uriverstil suffrage, because the right to vo»c would then depend upon an educated and r reflecting tlas=, who had long been undergoing a political edutation His argument was this, that a longer period must elapse under the bill of Ins lion friend before univ crsal suffrage existed m this country than w oula if they lowered the franchise All he could snv for himself was, that if they were to be smothered or swamped, he would much rather be drowned in a butt of malmsey than in a barrel of swipes (Great laughter) lie had heard the bill styled peel autieul and coxcombical, but the very worst imputation he had heard cast on it was that it was a new thing He also heard one member say, "lhere goes Conlueius " (laughter)-meaning his lion friend, who vvas then passing-' the would be lawgiver, who would rule this country on the prin- ciple of ¡itaati and competitive examinations ' Now, tliev ought to put as de for the present all questions concerning the machinery of the bill, and tontine their attention to the broad principle of it Ho might ask for this bill tht advocacy of all those gentlemen who had taken a prominent part in reform debates, espe- cially his lion friend the member for Leeds lliat gentleman had made many speeches on the worthiness of the w orking classes for the franchise, alluding to their mechanics institutes, and the number of cheap publications that circulate among them it being not the w calth of those classes but their intelligence whith moved his heart His hon friend would naturally refer to his own £6 Bill, and compare it with the present bill He, however, might quote the evidence of a gentleman who knew quito as much of the work- ing classes ns ins non friend He was such a pohtitian as w oulil be designated in an American paper as a " stock, lock, and barrel Radical -(laughter)-he meant Mr Holyoake (Hear) That gentleman last y car wrote n pamphlet m which, though there was mue h to disapprove, there wos much both spirited and honest 1 list Session he quoted fiom it a passage which was worth repeating, especially as there was a large number of new members present He wanted to compare the pioposal now with what he presumed would be the proposal hereafter Mr Holyoake, with regard to a £( bill, thus expressed himself - "I know towns where nrdent Reformers ore afraid of an unqualified suffrage Oood Radicals, the most thorough of their class, have saul to me, ' lhere is a mob m our town ("there is m every town), ignorant, selfish, a enal, and reckless of principle Had they voted, our Liberal members would be unseated at the next election I hey would vote against those w ho seek to laisc them Ibis is the general feeling in Liberal boioughs Now there is no plan of i £b sut frage w Inch selects the w orthy and excludes the base All £0 suflrage is blind, mid hence we have Radicals

is incapacitated by some considerations of personal unfitness orpohti.al dangers 1 his bill of his lion friend fitted the expression of the Chancellor of the Exchequer to a hair By it they excluded those two exceptionable qualities-' per- sonal unfitness and political danger, or, m other words, ignorance and guilt A franchise of this description would greatly tend to check venality and corruption, not because a man who was able to do a sum m multiplication w ould not take a bribe, but a number of men w ho could read, write, and reflect, and discuss among themselves the merits of a candi- date, w ere the less likely to be actuated bv degrading and v enal considerations, than a constituency formed by ameic lowering of the suffrage Not only so, but on intelligent constituency would be more likely to return a higher class of members ihe Maa or of Melbourne lately told bun that a large number of enlightened and liberal men were working in the Australian colonies for an educational franchise m lieu of what was nearly universal suffrage, which had become almost intolerable (Hear, hear ) If the House would give its countenance to this bill bv thoroughly discussing it, thev would greatly aid the efforts now beult, made in Australia As they w ere going to gratify England with a Reform Bill, he was perfectlv convmced thev w ould not deny a similar bill to Ireland If they brought m a double-banclcd bill for town and cities of course they would be prepared to sweep away a number of small boroughs, and to add their representatives to the large towns, such as Kingstown and Belfast He presumed thev would also hav c somethmg to do w ith the franchise He lind heard may a complaint made of the w ant ol indepen- dence and thought in some of the constituencies, but he had never heard any mm in Ireland, however Hadieal he might be, advocate the lowering of the suffrage (Hear, hear ) But were they to give such a suffrage to the country as that advocated by Ins lion fiiend, they would greatly strengthen the in tellectual capacities of the constituencies He would now turn to that small geographical point in w Inch they on that side of the House weresittm,; (Laugh tei ) He ceuld not help remarking the omuious and strange whispers that had reached his ears from the mouths of many Liberal members m reference to the £G franchise, which, whenever it was mentioned, gave rise to expressions of extreme disgust (Hear, heai ) He did not know anything of the Government pro- posal at present No doubt it would be a very beautiful composition, endow ed with all those ciiarms winch mature experience and vouthful ardour could confer upon it But "those whom the g ds love elie young ' (A lougn ) He was sorry to say they had heard on too many occasions tint some of its nurses, if they only got the chance, were prepared to "overlie and suffocate it (I lugnter ) If the Government brought in a single baneled bdl, they knew v era w eil that thev and their bill w ould be as dead as Julius Cesar within a month, and if they brought in a double-barreled bill, thev knew,whatever the political allegiance of those that w ere to be de stroyed, that Uiere were

div erted the mind fion ev era thing else, and when any other business was proposed it became a mere excuse and obstacle in the way (Renewed laughter) He was looking foiward to something thoroughly libeial, and, to his mind, thoroughly safe also, something that w ould strike a stronger and a higher chord throughout the country, if an appeal to the country w ei e to be made, than that unseemly appeal ad miso icoi dam,-w e must do something In case of such on event lie wished to louse the enthusiasm and intelligence of the people in behalf of some measure calculated to elev ate the constituencies rather than to debise them The elements of such requirements, he believed, he could discern in the bill biought forward by his lion friend, and as such he should giv e it his most cordial support After n short pause Lord Elcho rose Ile s ud ho had no intention of entering into the geneial question of Reform, because he was aware that hon gentlemen on both sides of the House w

ot a mensure based upon the reduction of the franchise one grounded upon the test of educa- tion In bringing forward tins motion his lion friend had followed in the wake of the hon member for "Westminster (Mr Mill), Mr Hare, and other political writers Hie lion member for "Westminster especiallj insisted most strenuousl) sn his writing upon evcrj mnn obtnimng that position in the State to which his acquirements entitled him-that a master of arts should have moro influence than any of the voters proposed bj the hon gentleman Such a test ns that proposed bj the lion gtntieman-and indeed he be lievedthnt it wus one of the arguments which the lion gentleman himself urged m its favour-would be in itself a test as to the sincerity of the v oter in his desire to obtain the franchise lhere were many lion gentlemen who were sceptical of the honest) and smcentv of w orking men upon this point, and the pass mg of this measure would have the effect of show ing whether these objections were well founded or not Then, again, it would not increase the anoma- lies of the present Bystem, for, instead of admitting to n participation in electoral pnv deges, as the mere lowering of the franchise would do, the provident ami the improvident alike, it would extend those privi- leges only to the intelligent and earnest members of tht working classes It would futher solve the diffi- cult question of the lodger enfranchisement, because, ns was well known, under the present system, a Rothschild or a Mill, unless occupying a house, possessed no share in our system of representation The objections to the measure, however, to which he | would glance for a moment or two, were many and serious In the first place, it w ns nov el, ind to some extent pedantic Is cither of these circumstances w as ns a rule acceptable to tie House, but when thej met .with a measure in which both w ere combined he couhl not help thinking that the probability of its passing wns Bomevvnat remote (Hef, hear ) Awain,

surrounded Mr Hoismnn -I certninl) expected to hen i lew words from the Irensurj Bench on this subject of busing the franchise on intelligence (Hear, hear ) Considering whit the hubjett is, it is only due to the House thal we should heal some expression of opinion from tht Ireasurj Benth on the proposal of m) hon friend (Hear, heir ) I do not think the circumstance tint the other side of the House

foi Hull from that great question of Reform w Inch her Majestj s Minibters led us to believe until we read the Queens bpeech-(laughter)- w is the most ibsorbmg, the most overwhelming, tht most pressing mid in intt, the supreme question of the daj I should, therefore, have thought that when the question vis brought forwird to dav the right hon gentlemen on the Ireasurj Bench ind their friends below the goigwij would hive shown great alncrit) ni expressing to the House the opinions which the) have expressed out of doois ('Hear, hcai, mel laughter ) I can imagine sue excuse for their

Majesty's Gov eminent, and there ma) be a par donible feeling of dissatisfiction at the contrast ob- vious to the most ruperficnl obseiver suggested b) the piesence of m> lion friend My lion friend pledged himself, like the Government, to introduce a Reform Bill it the earliest period of the session, but, unlike the Government, he has kept his pledge (I nughter ) The lion member, too, had to hasp his bill on statistics, but, unlike the Government, h> had no paid officers to assist lum, md, still more unlike the Government, his statistics are complete (Re- newed laughter ) Ldte the Government, again, he wishes to extend the franchise, but, unlike tkc Government, he bases Ins proposed extension on a principle (Loud laughter) And ne has attained a statesmanship beyond that which Earl Russell has ever nttamed with Ins one idea, which is to give us a House of Commons elected by a mob (Cheers) I can w eil understand the position occu pied by my lion friend to night-that of a reformer pledged to reform, who, at the earliest moment, îedcems his plcdgf (Laughter) A business like reformer, who has prepared his bill, and bases it upon a principle, may well excite feelings of embarrass ment on the lrcasury Bench ÎLoud laughter ) But, Sir, if my right lion fi end the Chancellor of the Lxchequer is unwilling ti express any opinion on this bill, 1 am still more surprised at the silence of the large and comprehensive reformers below the gangway They have tiven no response whatever to this proposal to base the fnncbise on intelligence, though that is what they have been roaring ibout all their lives (Laughter) When the lion member fo' Hull resumed his scat, I thought so mun) of them would be strrting up for the honour of becondmg the motion, that you, Sir, would have been per- plexed which of them to name, instead of which they all remained fixed to their seats (Renewed laughter, Has their ardour been expended and exhausted dunng the recess5 Or did it receive its quietus on the day the Queen s Spceehwas dehvcied ' (Loud laughter) I must say, judging from what we have teen, that there was never so potent an instrument, and one with &o; magical an effect, as the Queen s Speech, for it mesmerised in n moment nil the laige and comprehensive reformers in Her Majesty g domi- nions (General laughter) Hie lion member for Birmingham was the hrst to show that he was stunned and silenced "\\\ hen I w as coming dow n to the House at 1 o clock on the day Parliament was opened, I had not had an opportunity e i reading the Queen s Speech, but 1 met a friend of mine who has a seat on tins side of the House, and who is avery advanced reformer "How have they treated y ou gentlemen m the Speech, I asked , and he replied, ' v cry badly indeed , they hav e shunted us into a siduig ' (Laughter ) But, ho added, " We shan t stand it, and there will be a row ' ""Y\ hat do you mean by a row' ' I inquired, and he replied, " Go dowoi at 5 o clock, and just see how themembcrforBirminghamwillexplode ' (Laughter ) Mell, Sir, I came down to hear the member for Birmingham explode, and there was a great ruBh of new members to witness the ex- plosion , but the member for Birmingham had not the least ide i of exploding He sat here for two whole nights mute and melancholy, the "observed of all observers, and even when the right lion baronet the member for Droitwich, with the most benevolent m tcntion of enabling the large and comprehensive reformers to relieve their feeluigs-even then, when the right hon member for Birmingham at lost got on his legs, he w as ready to explode upon Jamaica, he was great on thf> cattle iplaguc, and he went off at half cock upon Ireland (laughter), but on the great question of Reform, which had been trtttecd ^ ith such contempt m the Queen s Speech, although the hon member s blood w as np to boilmg pitch on othei questions, his temperature w as so frigid that no sti mulant which could be applied had the efiect of raising him to blood heat (Loud laughter ) As to the other large and and comprehensive reformers ir_ v'ic House, thev were either afraid or ashamed to touch the question I do not doubt that the lion member for Birmirghom has his own reasons for avoiding the question, but Sir, there are other members of this Hoose who are reformers- large and comprehensive îeformers who profess, at least, to act upon principle altogether apart from party tatties "When last y ear we gamed an easy victorv over the lion member for Leeds we were told ns a icason that during the last Parliament the advanced Liberals, under the guidance of the lion member for Brighton, were politically deserted "But, they said, ' sec what will happen now See what the elections have done in \\\ estnunster, in Brighton, and in Lambeth (Laughtei ) See what young blood they have sent into the House-re formers uneontammated, undcmoTalised by past Par- liamentary milucnce, see how they will come out on Reform and redeem the character of Parliament and the country ' "Wow ere glad to hear of these valuable accessions and of the reputation of these gentlemen , we welcomed them with pride and with pleasure, we knew them to be men of great ability, and believed what we were told of their yal and sincerity , but still we watch and wait for them to redeem the character of the great Reform party, and others have wait-d and watched, and"willi what result' I can very well imagine these gentlemen congregated at the Reform Club around the hon member for Birmingham, when one of their admirers comes up and says, "We hear wonderfully little about Reform m this new Parlia- ment, when are you coming out en Reform5 Or what are you doing about Reform ' ' " Oh,' says the lion member for Birmingham, drawing himself up, "I am waiting for statistics (laughter) Then the admiring inquirer tunis to the lion member for "W estnunster, and he says, " "\\\ hat are you doing upon Reform ' " Oh, he replies, " I m helping the bon member for Birmingham" (Laughter; Then the inquirer goes to the lion member for Brigh- ton and asks, " W hat are y ou doing about Reform ' and he answers, ' lam helping the hon member for "Westmuister (Renewed laughter) Then the inquirer goes to the bon member for Lambeth, and, Íiresuming his attitude, savs, "I suppose vou are ike tile rC3t of them, and that you are helping the member for Brighton " Ihe hon member for Lambeth replies, " Probably I am ' Then gonig tlirough the club, the inquirer tunis j to a more canda íeformer, perhaps the senior | member for Bnghton, and asks lum the same ques- tion-" M hut are y ou legislators doing ibout Reform » ' " Oh, he says, " I wdl tell you what w e ure dong , w e arc helping the helpmates of the member foi Birmui^ham to smother Reform undei a fictitious pde of imaginary statistics ' (Laughter ) That is the aiibwer of one of the philosophical reformers of the House, who with philosophy have horne delay, against winch others have protested, profcs6nig no very high estimate of the sincerity of the patience exhibited Ol course, those gentlemen w ho w ould base the franchise on intelligence do not get much assistance fiora the lion member for Birmingham and those who agree with lum (Laughter ) Hie latter w ant to go a great deal faster than the formel "W e know that intelligence is fatal to agitation, that as the schoolmaster advances tile agitator iccedes, mid th it an educated multitude no more behoves ni demagogues than in ghosts But we do expect from men whose high reputation has given them influence and posi- tion m this House that thty should follow Reform with a pure spint, and, politically speaking, with a lugher morality than has distinguished tins agi- tation duruig the last few y ears, and when men of their high order lend themselves, as they appear to be doing now, by the indifference they are showing, to elie degradation of the Parliament they were intended to adorn, that, indeed, is nothing short of a public calamity (Cheers ) Hie Chancellor of the 3 xchequer Hie hope of my right lion friend who has just sat dow n that he would hear a few words from the lrcasury Bench will be ful- filled, but the w ords w ill be v ery few My principal duty is to render a just tnbute to the preceding speech of the lion member for the eountv of Gilw ay, which was chaiacterised by great forte, ability, cleai ness of statement, ingenuity in handling n difficult subject, and, above all, by an evident earnestness and sincerity I thank my lion friend on all these grounds, and especially for tdl that relates to the moral character of the piqposal he makes My ri^ht bon iriene1 (Mr Hors- man) leaves me little to do beyond this duty by the contrast he lias been benevolently pleased to imagine betw con the position of the hon meinbei foi Hull, who has fulfilled all his pledges, and the Government, who, he seems to think, before they have spoken, have contnved to break theus I cannot admit any ofthat mortification which he supposes we may suffer in con templating the triumphant honesty aud integrity of the non member for Hull We hav e the satisfaction of the good man-a conscience free from repioach with regard to what as yet we have done or not done on this subject In the Queen's Speech it was stated that the Government were engaged in gathering in- formation ¡Our responsibility may be tested by two considerations-first, the time at which the Cubnict was formed and was able to deliberate on public business after the death of Lord Palmerston and, second, the important question whether, after the tenor of the debates which took place in 1SG0, it was or was not material and im- portant that an cffoit should ut made to place Parliament and the country in possession of the best and most accurate information We came to the conclusion that such an effort w as desirable, and if my right lion friend thinks fit to challenge our judg- ment, or to say that this w is meant for evasion and delay, he is quite competent to do so But, if our views were just, our duty has been a perfectly dis- interested one We hav e prosecuted inquiries " nivohing the management and manipulation of a number of particulars with reference to con- stituencies , and if a measure is to be len- dered worthv of this House by such helps to accuracy and precision as the subject matter wall permit, the work is not to be done in a little tune Not a moment has been lost, and the time when it will be our duty to submit a proposal to the House depends upon the time at which we shall be able to put it m possession of the statistics In a very few days I hope I shall be able to state the day when that information will be supplied, but w ith respect to the modest invitation of the hon.
