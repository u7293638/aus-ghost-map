Oh but for living lips of fire To utter out my heart, And flash the tones from my spirit lyre In the voioe with which they start I Oh but for language that, should scorch , The innermost heart of hell, And gleam and glare like a flaming totoh, . Through the deeps where devils dwsll Oh for an utterance that should swatp] Like the rod-hot-lipped simoom. And wither the damning things that ke*p This beautiful world In gloom!

Then, Jeeu 1 the lofty hymn sublime I'd fling on life's panting sea Should ring on the farthest shore of time, - And grapple eternity.
