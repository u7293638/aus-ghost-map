Political Pars. POWERS has apparently got over his con tempt for Parliament and salary, and is more than likely to offer himself for hia old constituency; but ho is in a terrible tangle as to where <*.' are. He detests Dickson, abhors Ghissey, und does not think Drake <i duck by a jugful. About t he only person Ohnrles seems to have unlimited confidence in is Powers-sound as an individual mem ber, but fatal as a leader. MB. GROOM, in an article, or a par, or whatever newspaper men like to call it, says that the brand (not, I may point out, registered) which distinguishes the Rem nant, is brains. If any of the above Rem nant ever got lost, the brand will be a very poor means of identity. A poorer crowd never led a forlorn hope. ODice is their goal; and wlien they get it, they would remind anybody of the old liymn: " We are but strangers hore, Heaven is our home." MR. KUTLEDQE bos definitely arranged to contest the Marauoa. The local paper says:-It is not improbable the Premier will offer a sent to Mr. Rutledge in the Cabinet, so that ho will be inclose relation ship with the able men who are associated with the Premier in the administration of public affairs. TUB Roma Star discussing the political situation, remarks that beyond the reduc tion of salaries of the more highly paid civil servants and granting increases to the pay of subordinates Mr. Glassey has no policy, and if he had it would not be .1 policy that would bo acceptable or would be of benefit to the country. No confidence can be placed iti Glassey. Even his blatant advocacy of increasing the pay of sub ordinate civil servatiis is only made to catch votes. If his party were placed in power to-morrow that policy would not bo carried out, because the country is burdened heavily enough already with a costly civil list, MB.

Mr. Leahy is very popular in the south-western corner of the colony. Moreover, his electoiato is vast in area and costly to contest. MR. C. L. McDonald, the member for Flinders, says the Hughcnden Observer, was in town this week. No doubt the good advico imparted by the Premier and Mr. Philp as to the district being represented by a local man caused him to feel a little uneasy. Talk about absenteeism! What is Mr. McDonald but an absentee as regards this electorate ? Perhaps " our member" iB a believer in the old saw, " Absence makes the heart grow.fonder." THE solidarity which one time character ised Labor in Politics, says the Hughendeu Ohwreer, is becoming more conspicuous by its absence every day, and the Labor Party is not now the happy family it was in days gone by. Listen to how the plebiscite Labor candidato for the Cook talks to the local Labor organ :-" To him I say, take my advice, you hocus-pocus nincompoop, and sling the gum-pot and scissors. Don't bo trying to pass yourself o(f as the editor of the Ecut on, because you haven't brains enough to sell mousetraps to Chinkies. Bah ; the man who would bo afraid of your opposition would die at the sight of a de serted ghost in a graveyard, and would never bo elected to even an honorary position in a Joss-house."
