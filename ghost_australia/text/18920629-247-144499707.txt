Kenny's baths .will be glad to learn that slncc the recent -dredging operations at the.-ClSsplnnade they can plunge into twenty -seven feetof water. ' A typical caise of distress ' o four-robmed boose occupied by three -families and a lady lodger out of work. .Liegions ot teuei are wanted for a case like tbe followingâ€” a woman nine weeks in arrears in a 9s. house was offered by her landlord a 4s. hoase, but flatly declined to make the change on the ground that she was rather particular where she lived. The atmoBphere is thick with '? snow balls.'* St. Kilda ladies enrolling themselves in the legion of relief.
