VANISHED HOURS. Where are they gone, those dear dead days, Those sweet past days of long ago, % hose ghosts go floating to and fro When evening leads as throngh her maze ? Where are they gone ? Ah ! who can tell ? Who weave once' more that long- passed spelL They did exist when we were young. We met our life with strength and trust. We deemed all things were pure and just, Hot knÂ«w life had a double tongue, We lightly sang a happy song. Nor dreamed our way could e're be wrong. And then all changed ; as life went by. The friend deceived, or bitter death ?Smiled as she drank onr dear one's breath, And would not let u_s also die . Day followed day ; as on they went ,? Bach took some gift that life had sent. Yet it was ours, that cerfect past ! We did have days that knew not pain, We once had friends death had not ta'en, And flowers and songs tint could not last Were ours in that most blessed time. When earth seemed Heaven's enchanted clime. And fo I think, when lights burn low, And all the house is fast asleep, From out a silence vast and deep Those dear dead days we worshipped so, Breathe 'on cs frnni their hidden store Their long-lost pence, their faith once more. God keep those good old times ; ah me ' Beyond our vision they may rest Till on some perfect day and blest Once more those dear dead dayswill be, For dtatb. who toot all, may restore The past we loved, to us once more.
