Thomas.-That the Seasetary write to the Heidelberg Council and inform them, re vouchers ohjected to, that the Whittlesea Council is quite willing for the Heidelberg Council to expend an amount in works on their end of Haley's road equal to the amount as shown on the vouchers, but this Council wishing to deal honorably took out an item or two being for day labor-that they con sidered was not in the agreement. Cr. Bassett said the difficulty had partly been got over. Since last meeting representatives of each Council hed met on the ground, and the Heidelherg councillors had found that their share of the road was larger than they thought. So far as the Greens. borough road was concerned they had agreed, and the work wis done. As to Haley's road they had inspected it, and had parted agreeably wirh the understanding that it would be done. But as to the voucher business, he agreed. with Cr. Thomas' mnition, and would second it. He really bhought that there was not another Council in the colony that would have placed such ansit indignity on them. The President explained that at the b.iq Utx? m e t osn O or a tort. night on the Greensborough road, each Council to pay half-costj; the other road to stand over. Or. Thomas' motion was carried unanimously. ENROLLaiENT. From B. M'Sweeney, applying for his son's name (Michael) to be placed on the roll jointly with himself. To be considered at Revision Court. Secretary to inform Mr. M'Sweeney and other applicants as to mode of procedut e. A BAD ROAD. From P. Gilliano, bringing under notice the disgraceful state of road leading fromn Bridge Inn road to South Tan Yean railway station, and adding : It is really pitiable to see ladies having to wade through slush several inches deep on their way to and from the station. It is also very dangerous for foot traffic on dark nights, owing to there being no footpath people found it very difficult to avoid being run over by the well-fed high-spirited horses of onr milk farmers. My object in writing to you is that you as a body may move the Railway Department to put this much neglected road in decent state of repair and safe for public traffic. Or. Thomas said that really and truly there was not walking space to the station, and if matters were not remedied possibly it might come to pass that through the state of the road they mtight lose their illustrious Presi dent, or some bright councillor like himiself -(Cr. Draper.-" Oh l")-and even Cr Draper himself might probably get "stack in the mud." He would move that the Railway authorities be \----written to to effect repairs and erect railing to protect foot passengers., Mr. Gillian suggested that the foot path be made farther out so as not to encroach on present road. Cr. Thomas agreed with this. Cr. Bassett seconded the motion, which was carried unanimously. CAN'T GET TaIBER. Contractor J. E. Hall wrote, re his contract fer bridge, Gleovale, that he could not get timber of the dimensions specified by the Engineer, and asking that the siGe be altered.

From Ptblle Health Department, 12th May, as follows :-I have the honor to inform your Council that in view of the fact that coses of typhoid ferver have been reported to the Board as hlaving occurred i, the Shire, the Board have deemed it advisable that the provisions of section 125 ofthe Health Act 1890, rendering notification of infectioub diseases obligatory, be put in force in the Shire, and that in asenro dance with that decision arrived at at their meeting on thi 3rd inst., a notice declaring the Shire of Whittlesoa affected with typhoid fever was pubh lished in the Governmnf Garette of 5th inet I may explain that in taking this action the Board have had regard to tlhe importance of having tlhe first cases of infections disease reported at the earliest moment in order that tthe Counoil and the Board may have the fullest possible information as to the exiatence of sush diseases in the di, trict, and that the Council may be able to take effective measures for the pire vention of their spread, and that ex perience has shown that the only effectual way of securing early and proper notification of cases is by the application to a district of the pro visions of the section quoted.--J. W. COLVILLE, Secretary. CLAIM FOR DAMAGES. Mr. John Andrew wrote, stating that through the bad state of repair of the Barber's Creek bridge, he had sus tained damages to his dray that had cost .Â£1 5s to repair, and as he had told the Surveyor a month previous that the bridge was in had repair, he con sidered the Council should pay the amount named. Cr Thomas moved that the matter he referred to the Engineer for report. Seconded by' Or Bassett and carried unanrimously. Or Draper drew attention to the fact that some three months ago he had moved that several bridges should be repaired, and he noticed they had not been. le now moved that they be at once attended to.
