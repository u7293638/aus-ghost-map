One of the old chroniclers des cribes an apparition seen in the thirteenth year of King Edward IV.'s reign. There was a voice heard, he says, in the air between Leicester and Banbury, and 'in dyverse other places, crying for a long time 'Bowes! Bowes!' which was herde of forty menne; and some taenne said that he that cryed soo was a h'edless manne.' But what this remarkable cry meant we are not told, al though it is included with sundry other tokens that were 'shown that year in England 'for amen dynge of mennys lyvynge.' St. Denis, when his head was cut off, is said to have waited away quite cheerfully, carrying it under his arm; and strange stories of headlessness have been told quite seriously in much more modern times. For instance, Hawthorne relates that a sea cap tain once told him a strange story of an incident which was said to have occurred during the action -between 'the Constitution and the Macedonia, which was fought during the war of 1812 be tween this country and the United States. The captain was at the time powder-monkey aboard the Constitution, and saw a cannon shot come through the ship's side. A seaman's head was struck off, probably by a splinter, for it was done, he said, without bruising the head or body as clean as by a razor. The unfortunate man at the time of the occurrence was walking pretty, briskly, and . the captain seriously affirmed that he kept walk ing onward at the same pace, with two jets of blood gushing from his headless trunk, till, after going about twenty feet without a head, he sank down at once, with his legs under him. Headless folk figure somewhat extensively in local legendary lor-e; which is hardly surprising, perhaps, for among the strange shapes of bogey- ' land, few are more calculated to impress the rus tic imagination than the horses and men without heads, of whom so many terrifying stories are told. Some years ago a lady was teaching a Sun day- school class in Sussex, and asked for an ex planation of the phrase their 'ghostly enemy.' The children unanimously replied .that . it meant 'a spirit that comes back from the grave,' and they then proceeded to pour out a stream of ghost stories which fairly astonished their teacher. Headless folk, of course, figured freely. Spirits walking without any heads^at all, others carry ing them tucked under their arms, and one, given to the bad habit of haunting a dark lane, rejoicing, in a ball of fire on its shoulders instead of s. head — all these were found to be still real and terrjfy-' ing to' Sussex children. Mr. Baring Gould, hasire corded a Yorkshire instance of this kiM of super stition. . ' He was told -6t an old barn near Thirsk' which was said to be .haunted by a headless woman; A tramp- went into 'it rone night 'to sleep;' but -^iat midnight he was awakened by a light, and, fitting up, he saw,. a woman -coming towards him from the end of .the barn, holding her. head .'in- her hands like a lantern, Jwith light. 'streaming. out of :'£he: eyes, nostrils, and mouth. He sprang out of the barn in a fright, breaking a hole in the wall to' escape. This hole I was shown six years ago. Whether the barn still stands I cannot say,'— 'Globe.'
