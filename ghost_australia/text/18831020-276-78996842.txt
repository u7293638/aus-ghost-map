" Mayhap if you'd toll ma the story, 'Twould oasa up your mind a bit, 'Twas just suoh a night as this one 'Taint likely I'll over forgit That our blosping oamo, and soraohow When tho wind and storm are abroad, Thoro's a queer kind o' foolin' in here, A sort o' thanksgiving to God. "What's that you are sayin'? Oh, surely I couldn't ha' heard you right. Did you say that your wife wont somewhere, And you dropped in that night? Thataho wont homo kind o, oarly i But thoy urged you to stay a spoil, . And told her you'd bring tho baby, And see 'twas bundled up woll?
