. ' PARKES! HIS DIARY. Under the above, which sounds some what .familiar, the Sydney Bulletin write's:^-' When the Sydney. Morning Herald wishes to publish to the world Parkes' genuine diary let it print — if it dare — the entry he made when Went worth lashed him from' the hustings in 1848 ; of the morning in '56 when i nil Rvdnfiv rune1 with Homeric Inuffhtnr at the instalment of his autobiography which he published in that day's Empire ; of that evening when tho hunger stricken wife of his employee, who had worked for him without wage, was turned away from his door penniless ; of the afternoon of that day when Sir Alfred Stephen addressed to him the one phrase which, of the thousands that have fallen from the Judge's lips, will survive his death. Let the journal do this, and let it quote — if it dare — Parkes' own account of tho evolution of the Kiama Ghost, and of tho infamous Treason Felony Act ; let it publish his reflections the night when Edward Butler died, robbed, not of money this time, but of that position of dignity and honor which was the due reward of liis labors ? .ind let it, five to tho world that transcript of tho broken-hearted gover ness's letter which was addressed to him on the collapse of the Australian Mutual Prudential Assurance Society. When it does this and these, then we can be lieve that the Herald is deriving from the only authentic source, Parlces' nininr Till if rlnna wo mnsf*. nY'nnso XSIMJ. ? ? ? it of being tho instrument ot an imposition, or — we will not deny it the saving qualification — the ridi culous tool of a shallow impostor. We can only acquit the S.M.ff. of originat ing a fraud at the expense of arraigning its intelligence. Perhaps, after all, the possibilities of the one case are as likely as the other. The great law of con tinuity in life demands that as in life so in death shall the man be. Parkes in political death eoukl not help but be as ho was in political existence, a superla tive fraud.
