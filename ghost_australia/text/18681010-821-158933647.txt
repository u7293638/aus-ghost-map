MR. REYNOLDS AND THE VICTORIAN LAND ACT. fFroii M onday's Register, i Here is a woful effect of the adjournment. Mr. Reynolds, in default of anything better to do, has resumed his pen as a newspaper cor respondent. We welcome Mm back to our columns in remembrance of the invigorating tartness with which he enlivened them in old times. It is a pleasure to see that his style has lost none of its early charms—that he still calls a spade a spade, and considers the whole human race to be out of temper but himself. We had forgotten about an article of ours on the Victorian Land Act, published a few days ago, and doubtless our readers had seen it well ad vanced on its road to oblivion when Mr. Reynolds rushed in, insisting that it should be recalled—he had a few words to say to it. The new leader of the Opposition will be recognised in every line of the annexed epistle; if not, there is his signature to it:— TO THE EDITOR. Sir—I have to request that you will allow me space in your columns to correct some statements of yours relating to myself which appeared in your leader 011 Monday Jasfc, when, referring to a few remarks made by me in my finance statement and in the debate on ilie ]pnd resolutions, you charge me nith reciting "newspaper extracts by the yard." As f did not quote even a line from a newspaper the charge is simply untrue. You ?av " the slightest investigation will show that the comparison given is very imperfect; that the figures are in many cases incorrect; and that the inferences both expressed and suggested are unfair. Glaring contradictions can be detected on the face of the Ministerial arithmetic " You appear in that article to question my "motives," and vou charge me with holding up the Sallarat Star as statistical authority — a paper I never lecollect having seen, and certainly never held up to you or auy other person as an authority or otherwise. "No one eught to question your right to point out and animadvert upon any mistakes or errors of public men, and if I had confounded the year 1867 with the year 1868 when referring to Victorian statistics, t admit the propriety of .your pointing it out. But I do not know that that simple error, if made, would justify so carping an article as that of Monday, or justify the charges mtde against me. Allow me to quote what I appear to have said:— "The acreage under cultivation for wheat in Victoria in 1812 was 162,008, in 1867 was 208.586, making only 46.000 acres increased; in 1868 there were 12,146 acres only more than 1867, the total being 220,731 acres." "The land under cultivation in Victoria in 1S62 was 439,895 acres; in South Australia it was 494,511; in 1868 in Victoria, according to the last return, the land under culti vation was 592,915 acres as against 8'.0,734 acres in South Australia." I certainly thought and pointed out that the comparison of acreage was important, as showing that whilst land was cheap in Victoria and the authorities there were trying to make it stall cheaper, the Victorians were not keeping pace with us in extent of cutivation. Hot having the Victorian statistics at hand 1 sought the information from a usually very tru-t worthy source 1 find, however, on now being able to test the figures from the Victorian published statistics, that iny information was slightly at fault, and to the following extent. That the land under wheat in Victoria for the year 1861-2 was 196.'22, and not 162 008, which properly belong to years 1862-3. And I assume that the entire amount of land under cultivation for the year 1867-8, taking your own authority, was 631,270 acres, and not 592,915, which properly belongs to the year 1866-7. Admitting these corrections it may fairly and tru'y be contended that my inferences, "expressed or suggested,'' were fair, as may be deduced from the following analysis of the respective five years' operations: — find under wheat— Acres.

Ton state that £ gave "one-sided opinions;" ' " paraded a one-sided view of facts;" made no i analysis whatever," &c; ; that "as a simple matter of figures my comparison wasoverstraioed." Well, suppose we look at some of yours, and let any rea sonable man say after examining the following whether you may be considered a competent1 authority on such matters. You say that in ** 1866 the acreage under wheat in Victoria was 178,000; 1867,208,000; 1868.220.000 —an increase of 80 per cent, in three years." That is to say. that the difference between 178,000 and 220,000 is 80 per cent. "Glaring contradictions may be detected on the face of Ministerial arith metic;" but I di nut think that any arithmetii can match the editorial arithmetic n the above may be considered a fair specimen. If one may presume to express an opinion, it does appear that the percentage will not reach 25. Again, you assure us that during the same period South Australian acreage had increased from 4 0,Olio acres in 1866to559.000in 1868, being, you sax, 169,000 acres increase; whereas it is only 140,000 acres, and about 35 per cent, increase, and not, as you fnrther state, 40 per cent. After this wonderful arithmetical effort, you ask "what is our vaunted South Australian progress?" I answer it by saying that Victoria with its " vaunted" Grant's Act, with a protective duty on its wheat, with a population four times that of Sonth Australia, has not been able during the most favourable of periods to teep pace with South Australian cultivation. During the last three years Victoria had only increased her wheat area by 42,000 acres, wliile South Australia had increased iters by 140.009 acres. During that same period Victoria had increased her entire cultivation by 104,074 acres, while South Australia had increased ' hers by 150,165 acres. i am bir, &c.9; T. BEYNOLDS. That is the sort of thing a man -would "write with an internal chuckle at the end of every sentence, and an inclination to attempt an Indian warwhoop when he had finished the address on the envelope. It is demolish ing—unmerciful—annihilating—terrific. The enemy is blown into space as clean as you would, blow the ink out of your pen. Mr. Reynolds has knocked us out of time—no doubtaboutit, and no concealing of it either— but we may have breath enough yet to make a dying confession. If, however, we were prematurely to give up the ghost it might make us laugh irreverently in our graves to remember the delightful egotism of Mr. Reynolds' opening paragraph. He has ap propriated our criticism all to himself— statistics, newspaper extracts, inferences, and alL Like Swift's Presbyterian Jack he so courts persecution that be has swallowed a dose of it which was intended for five men, most of whom have stronger stomachs than his own. Our article was directed against the Ayers Ministiy, and their unfair treat ment of the Victorian Land Act. It speci fied more than one offender, and if Mr. Reynolds were to take the trouble to count he might find that Mr. Glyde's name occurs in it more frequently than his own. The passage which he has singled out as a gross misrepresentation of what he said—a ■" carping" calumny, forsooth—was not di rected at Mr. Reynolds in propria persona; and Mr. Reynolds cannot have so misun derstood it, for it explicitly refers to " two ex-Ministers." The "newspaper extracts" may have been monopolized by Mr. Glyde; but hia financial colleague did not at the time manifest any of the repudiating ten dency he has since developed. And if Mr. Reynolds will have verbal criticism he may be reminded that the blunder which these "newspaper extracts" were called in to illustrate was distinctly and separately com mitted by botb Ministers. Mr. Reynolds' confession in tbe above letter that his "in formation was slightly at fault," and his extenuating plea that it was second-hand, are more than we ever expected from him. He is not ashamed to admit that he uninten tionally misled the House, but he cannot brook the idea of having employed so vile a means of deception as "newspaper extracts." He had his information "from a usually very trustworthy source," in whose company we suppose he would rather be wrong than share the right with a hireling press. Moved by profound consideration for Mr. Reynolds's antipathy to editors, we hereby declare that he is not the " ex-Minister" who " recited newspaper extracts by the yard." It was Mr. Glyde alone who condescended to that low form of hoodwinking. Mr. Reynolds is not one of those common-place men who can be judged by plain prose. He needs the inspiration of figures to raise him to the height of his genius. Though they confessedly got the better of him in their second-hand state, he has since, by dint of original enquiry, reduced them to order. The result is a fulfilment of our friendly prediction that he might have made a stronger case out of them had he been more careful. The repetition of his " few remarks" is, however, no answer to our comments on them, if it were, a repetition of the comments would be the only rejoinder it deserved, and in that we j mean to gratify Mr. Reynolds to a limited extent. In his last paragraph he professes to have turned the tables upon us, and to | have detected "glaring contradictions on the face of the editorial arithmetic," which make the vagaries of the Ministerial Cocker look like spots upon the sun. The exposures which follow are so astounding that the public will wish to see the infatuated figures in their original connec tion. Here is the paragraph which Air. Reynolds has so triumphantly picked to pieces:—" In the season 1862-3 there were, as Mr. Reynolds says, 162,000 acres under wheat, but in the season 18J4-5 the area had diminished to 125,000 acres. This was the point at which- Mr. Granls Bill came into operation, and- what has been the tendency since? The area under wheat in 1866 was 178,000 acres ; in 1867, 208,000 acres; and in 1868, 220,000 acres—an increase of SO per cent, in three years. And what is our vaunted South Australian progress during the same period? In 1864-5 we had under wheat 390,000acres; in 1868, 410,000 acres; in 1867, 457,000 acres; and in 1868, 550,000 acres—increase during the three seasons, 160,000 acres, or 40 per cent." The italicised words indicate in each case the intended starting-point of the compari son, namely, the season 1864-5, and not as Mr. Reynolds assuines, with the charitable object of representing us as idiots, 1S65-6. By the way, how does Mr. Reynolds contrive to screw out three years between 1866 and 1868? It could not have been more dis tinctly indicated in our article that we •wished to show what Grant's Act had done for wheat cultivation in Victoria. Mr. Rey nolds did not need to be told that that Act came into operation in 1865; or if he had required the information, he could hardly have missed it in the foregoing paragraph. He might have ascertained also, without any abstruse calculation, that the last harvest was the third under Grant's Act. In setting 1867-8 against 1S64-5, we obtained the result of three years' increase; but had we, as the wilful obliquity of Mr. Reynolds would fain make us do, set 1866 against 186S, the result would have been but two years' increase. Patience to read three consecutive sentences together may be too much to ask of an ex-Treasurer during his first week out of office, but the capacity of subtracting six from eight is not an extravagant expectation to entertain even in the cold shades of opposition. After quoting the paragraph, it may seem superfluous to explain how we arrived at the 80 per cent, in the one case with 40 per cent, in the other. Perhaps Mr. Reynolds has a weakness for getting entangled in prose, and prefers statistics "neat." He has taken some trouble in tabulating his own for our benefit, and we can hardly grudge to do as much for him. Annexed, therefore, is a table of the figures and percentages com piled from the above paragraph on the reading-made-easy principle:— Victoria. South Australia. *835. 1868. 1865. 1868. Acreage 1-25,000 220,000 390,000 550,000 Increase in three years.. 95,000 160,000 Net percentage 76 41 In the article which lias so galled and mystified our great financier it was said, among other unpleasant things, that the Ayers Ministry had been " hardly more successful as critics than as constructors." Their Treasurer has given us posthumous evidence that the remark was far more true than we could have ventured to suspect. In future we shall be able to understand aud sympathize with Mr. Reynolds's morbid antipathy to "newspauer extracts." I From Thursday's Register. | TO THE EDITOR. Sir—Those gentlemen who have read your leader of yesterday, and with whom I have had any con versation respecting it, believe that 1 have had the misfortune to cause you to exhibit an infirmity which you have generally very freely attributed to me. To he candid, 1 have taken your leader as abounding in lively "chaff." But knowing how readily an editor of the Register can confound "chaff" with petulance iu others, it is quite pos sible that I may have committed an error, and mis taken what my friends term " petulance" and " spite" for cool-humoured banter. I write under great di advantages, principally because you can and will have the last word. But really £ am desirous of not misunderstanding you, and I ought perhaps to thank you for your kind ness in putting your arithmetical puzz'e into a '"ieaiing-made-easy principle," for without it few persons except yourself would be able to com prehend it. Let me restate the case. The italicized words are mine. After you had stated the acreages under wheat in the year 1832-3 and 1861-5, yon say, "This was the point at which Mr. Grant's Bid came into operation, and what has been the tendency since? The area under wheat in 1866 was 178.000 acres; in 1867, 208.000 acres; and in 1868, 220,000 acres—an increase of 80 per cent, in three years." What struck me, and has struck every one else whose opinions I value to whom I have referred it, that this percentage was intended to apply to the three seasons or years 1836-7-8, as you made no reference to any other year by way ef comparison. The following was evidently in tended to illustrate the foregoing, which makes it three seasonsAnd what is our vaunted South Australian progress daring the same period? In 1861-5 we had under wheat 390,000 acres; in 1866, 410,000 acres: in 1867, 457,0U0 acres; and in 1868, 550,001—increase during the three seasons, 163,000 acres, or 40 per cent." An increase " during the tiiree seasons" limits it to 186G-7-8. Like a farmer saying, in 1866 I cropped 100 acres with wheat, in lS(i7 I cropped 150 acres with wheat, in 1863 I cropped 200 acres with wheat—the increase during the three years, or the season, was 100 acres, or 100 per cent, increase. An ordinary reader must naturally ask if the state ment was not intended to be limited to the terms " three seasons" or " three years." What others state is proposed by way of comparison. Your leader of yesterday professes to supply the required infor mation ; and you ask your readers to compare the year 1865 with the years 1864-5, as a kind of sub stitute for your .increase during three seasons. Now, while it may be admitted that your " reading-made-easy principle" in yesterday's issue may help to clear up, to say the least, an obscure arithmetical statement, it does not so clearly justily your parade of "fairness." The whole of your article of 28th September was calculated (f do not say intended, because it is well known that you desire to please and encourage the farming interest) to depreciate South Australian agricultural enterprise; and very few disinterested persons can commend or justify you in your com parison of two periods so unjust and unfair to South Australia. If you had been desirous of doing justice to your own calony, why take the year l OP I r A «miiH ?»■» Viotnrion onrinultll rn fhnf nrnn AO 1834-5—a year in Victorian agriculture that was ex ceptional—when the acreage had never been so small since the year 1839 60, and comnave that exceptional year with the year 1867-8? I do not pretend to understand your "motives" when you call upon vour readers to look and admire what Grant's Bill had done in three seasons, or in 1SGS as compared with 1864 5. You say that the year 1862 was the "first year of Gavin Duffy's Act;" then why not take that year and compare it wiih the year 1867-8, and state the result' The period between those dates would give us a time when Duffy's ami Grant's Acts were in full operation, and would be both fair and just as a comparison, because we there give Victoria all the advantages of its boasted laud law6 and fairly test them with our own much-abused land system. Let me furnish the comparison— VICTORIA. Acres. Land under cultivation for wheat, 1851-62 195.922 Do. do. do, 1867-68 220.734 Increase under Duffy's and Grant's Acts in 1861-62 211,812 Not "80 per cent.." but a trifle over 12 per cent, od the yean 1861-62. 80UTH AUSTRALIA.

I should not have troubled you again on this matter had you not made a great parade ot your figures, "as exhibiting a more correct analysis of agricultural progress," and because your state ments were calculated to mislead the public on a j riuestion at the preseut moment of great public importance. i am, bir, etc., T. EEYWOLDS. October 6.18(58. [We have not followed Mr. Reynolds' example in consulting our friends on the relative propor tions of petulance and chaff, either in his style or our own. In consideration of the injustice fre quently done to the honourable gentleman's temper, we hereby declare that in the present instance we have not had the slightest occasion or wish to complain of it. But *e do complain of the manner in which Mr. Reynolds attempted to distort the statistics quoted by us for the purpose of correcting his own. He has made a feint of repeating the experiment in the above letter; but the point in dispute is already too well understood for mystification. Mr. Reynolds is perfectly well aware that we were discussing the effects of Grant's Act on the agricultural progress of Victoria He does not find it expedient to come to close quarters himself, so he generalizes, splits hairs, and drags in all manner of irrelevant matter to cover the too sweeping inferences with which he and Mr. Clyde amused the House a fortnight ago. But all his cavilling can not overturn a single fact or calcula tion published by us. Grant's Act came into operation during 1865, and the third harvest under it was reaped iu ISfJ -tj". The point from which the progress of these three years Bhould be mea sured is surely the last harvest under the old system, namely, 1S61-65. Prom 1864 65 to 1665-66 I represents one year, to 1866 67 another, and to 1S67-6S a third. Can we make it plainer? If Mr. Reynolds is not prepared to teach us a new method of statistical calculation we must assume that the results produced by our own are correct; and that Mr. Reynolds discovered a mare's nest when he dented our estimate of the progress of Victorian and South Australian wheatgrowing during the past three years as 7(1 per cent, and 41 per cent, respectively.—Ed.]
