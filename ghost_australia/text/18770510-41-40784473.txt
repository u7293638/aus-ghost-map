OTTR DEFENCES. 1 TO THK EDITOR. , Sir — I have noticed that the Government have called for volunteers for the defence of the colony; and while having faith in the patriotism of mv fellow- colonists. I would ask what dob sible use the enrolment of a lot of cavalry,iof an try, kc, can be when the only enemy at all likely to appear is a well-armed privateer. With very great diffidence I would suggest that if an English man-of-war of ' decent armament were stationed-somewhere in Gulf St. Vincent, we could buy and sell -and get gain in'perfect secuity. ' ' '. I should like also ask whether the South Aus tralian Government has communicated with the Imperial Government asking for protection, anil in the words of the immortal Strangways, ?' If not why not ?' ' j If the services of an ironclad, were asked for and the expenses of her maintenance, weie guaranteed by South Australia, I presume there . is little question but that one could be obtained. I also note the Amoor wire in interrupted ; how long will our connecting cable be likely to be of any use to us ? 'A word to the wise,'*&jc.;, I do most sincerely trust that instead of, or »t least as well as, the usual amount ' of 'rot arid bunkum on these occasions- something really practical may be done, and done quickly, too. I ? I am anxious to be a member, of -an artillery corps for the defence of the colony, but hesitate to send in my name, being tolerably well satis fied that my services in loading * gun will never be called into requisition, as, though j I am only 45, my allotted space will have expired long before there is a ghost of a gun to experi ment upon, or at any rate that the conflict now looming in the distance will before then be a thing of the past. _ ' I am, Sir, &c;, GRANITE [ISLAND.: [If our correspondent is sincere in deprecating what he is pleased to call ' rot and bunkunV' why did he write this letter ?— Ed.]
