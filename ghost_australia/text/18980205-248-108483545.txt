I tHK BIGHT THAT CAST NO SHADOW. Curious series are told about tho powers I Posseted by certain natives of India, wlio live "P among the Himalaya mountains. These "Id men, it'is said, have devoted scores of years to the study of natural laws and forces, which the rest ot the world knows nothing about. Lately a German j)rofessor visited the " adept?," as these queer Hindus are called, fw the purpose of finding out tho secret of llioir roinarkable performances. They treated him lather scurvily, but interested him all the sair.c. One day the professor wanted to ex amine some ancient Sanskrit manuscripts. An adept went with him to a cave wherein the honks wprfi kbpfc. The place was dark as the bottom of a voll* "J eau'i sje to mad here,'' said the visitor. "Then wc will have some light, " wa» the rejjly, and immediately (the professor says) a soft, pearly light. brightened the cave. He mild not tell whence it came, but he noticed 'hat ir. had mjn strange quality-it cast not the zliyktcst shadow* This is a story hard to believe, yet its truth >s affirmed liy a man of vast learningand high character, and you who now read it haw no reason for doubt except that all the light?, you nave seen have cast shadows. Belief or utilie lief conimonly runs parallel with one's own experience. "L»r.

[Since my recovery, for which e thank Mother} Seigel's Curative Syrup, I havo been in the best of health and spirits. In tha interests of suffering humanity I deem it . duty to send you this testimony. (Signed' D. Griffiths, tailor and outfitter, 151, Hockley Hill. Birmingham, June Sth, 1893." There is a deal of difference between Mr. Griffith's candid letter and the story about the ?light that cast no shadow. The latter may be true erioujrh.but if cannot be verified without more, trouble than its worth. On the other hand wehatfea trustworthy , witness, who will answer letters of inquiry, and can be found at his address. ;l Finally, there is nothing mystic or magical about Mother Seigel's Curative Syrup. It i acls on the theory that most ailments are but 'symptoms, forms, or phases of that univer sal disease-indigestion and dyspepsia; it cures that, and throws the light of health and happiness over hearths and homes where illnes and paiu had cast such dark and terrifying shadows. And that, is why pejple believe all that is told of its success by eager witnesses.
