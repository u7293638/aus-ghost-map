A STOnY or Font FLEs.-In the fol lowing neat and pregnant little fable some of the ecoentricities of modern adultera tion are delicately disclosed to the com monwealth of consumers by a contom porary German satirist-" There was once four flies, and, as it happened, they were hungry one morning. The first settled upon a sausage of singularly appetising appearance, and made a hearty meal. But he spoodly died of intestinal inflam mation, for the sausage was adulterated with aniline. The second fly breakfasted upon flour, and forthwith succumbed to contraction of the stomach, owing to the inordinate quantity of alum with which the flour had been adulterated. The third fly was slaking his thirst with the contents of the milk jug, when violent cramps convulsed his frame, and he soon gave up the ghost, a victim to chalk adul teration. Soeeing this, the fourth fly, muttering to himself, ' the sooner its over the sooner to sloop,' alighted upon a moistened sheet of paper exhibiting the counterfeit presentment of a death's head, and the inscription 'Fly-poison.' Fear lossly applying the tip of lus proboscis to this device, the fourth fly drank to his heart's contoet, growing more vigorous and cheerful at every mouthful, although expectant of his end. lut he did not die. On the contrary lie throve and waxed fat. You soo, even the fly-poison was adulterated.
