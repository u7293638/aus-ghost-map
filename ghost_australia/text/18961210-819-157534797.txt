The Volunteer Band initiated a pleasant and wo hope profitable in novation ye- terday evening when they gave an open air concert on the Bunbury Recreation Ground. The movement was well patronised by the general public and there was a large attendance although the weather was rather too cool for entire enjoyment.

Professor Davis announces through our advertising columns a series of entertainments in this district next week. He proposes being in Bunbury I on the IGth and 17th inst when a| wonderful performance is promised. Says the Albury Daily News of a reGent date:â€”"Those who witnessed the entertainment on Saturday night (and there was a large attendance) were apparently of the almost unanimous opinion that Professor Davis ib the cleverest all-round per former in his respective lines ever seen on the local boards. All his sleight of hand tricks are clever to a degree, his ventriloquist-entertain ment is remarkably well done, and the " spirit" producing seaDce is simply astounding. Under the supervision of a committee from the audience Pro fessor Davis has his hands firmly tied together and is placed in a bag drawn round the neck with a string and sewn up in the presence of the audience by the committee. All the sewing and knots are sealed with wax. He is then placed in a chair in the cabinet aud held tightly with a rope, fastened to his body and passed through the cabinet, by one of the committee men. The cabinet (which is only a frame curtained off) is then closed and immediately bells, &c..; commenced to sound within and shortly afterwards the white robed spirits of " Cissie," if Geordie" and " Josephine" (the famous friends of poor MrB. Mellon) appeared iu suc cession. Then Mr. Davis, to show he had escaped from the cabinet, walked out and addressed the audience. During this time the lights were turned low, but they are up again as Mr. Davis concludes his remarks and on the cabinet being opened he is still found sitting there in the tied and sealed condition in which he was placed at the outset. Committee and audience were alike completely mystified, as the test was a severer one than that gone through by Mrs. Mellon, the alleged spirit raiser, and which deceived Mr. Justice Windeyer and others so thoroughly. Mr. Davis, of course, admits that his ghosts are produced bj trickery,"
