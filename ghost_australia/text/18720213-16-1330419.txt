THE VALUE OF OYSTER BEDS. On the shores of Botany Bay an experiment is being conducted by Mr Holt, to which it is worth while to direct public attention, not as a new industry, but as on old industry in a new and improved phoBO Oyster fishing has been common in the colony from its earliest found a tion, because the bounty of nature provided the dab in abundance But oyster culture is a novelty here, as hitherto no pains have been taken to secure the growth and development of this fish under the most favorable conditions. A few years ago, on complaints being made that some of the most productive oyster beds in the colony had been exhausted by reckless dredging, the Government ob- owned authority to close several rivers and more recently some sections of water frontage have been leased by Govern in it for lisbon purposes These were inoioiiiontsin the light direction ; but the plan now introduced into the colony by Mr Holt dispenses with the necessity of all troublesome applications to Government, and establishes the fished) on private property On his last visit to Europe has observed at the He de Rho that oysters while bred in the open bay, where the tide rose and fell were fattened ia ditches or trenches (locally called claires), the ingress and egress of the water being artificially regulated A similar plan has been for many years in use on the coast of Denmark It is obvious that this method is admirably adapted for the reclamation of salt marshes On the coast of this colony, and on the causes of the principal races, are many thousand acres of cult swamp cheap in h of which may in this way be utilised the soil thrown out of the trenches will form intermediate banks, which will produce for iss for cattle, 01 vegetables, and in this we ly every part of what is now waste land may be utilised, and fish, (1 ah, and fowl I may all pasture within the seine nug fences I In Europe there are two different systems of oyster oulture-uunely, that of the He do life in France, and that of Lake Fusnio in Italy. Knoll has some local advantages, and each some local disadvantages At Xn' o Fusiiro the brooding operations are very successful, as the spit is collected in any desired quantity on the licks 01 posts which are provided for the purpose At the He do Rho timber is Dupre em able at unreasonable expense, and stones, likes, and bits of pottery), cove) ed sometimes with artificial cement, are made use of, but the fish are not so easily detached from those substances as from wood, not only as additional labor involved, but many are destroyed At Lake inside the top of the ground will not allow of the formation of shale',, and oysters have to be dredged instead of being picked up by hand On the eve swamps of the do do fills, the chair by stein is well developed, and thoodiuntago of hand picking is obvious AH dredging in more or less blind 1911, must unavoidably involves a waste of labor and a waste of a room But when the fish ciHicroi has not more than six inches of water to deal with he can see what he is about, and inn tin in every inch of ground to account, he can plant and calling his rows of oysters as normally as a gardener can plant and gather his rows of potatoes Now it should be specially noted that in this colony we can combine, all the uihiuitugcH of both systems, and get rid of them disadvantages We have plenty of timber and plenty of low lying land will suit willow frontages. The climate, too is all that can be desired. Grout cold destroys the young fish, and in some parts of England the universe has in this way nearly all disappeared It is this destruction of the young brood which has so increased the price there us to make the oyster only a luxury In the rich In ItiiLluud and in some of the chief Continental cities the price ranges from £7 to £12 in bushel Two vary in portant advantages attach to the system of oyster cultivation in claims. The first is that it provides the conditions most favorable to growth and cultivation. him a thorn les who are learned in this sub post state that oysters resting on a muddy bottom, where the molluscs crustacea and infusoria are found that no the ducat flavor, with from two to six inches of water kept uniformly over churn, with a change of salt water ever side, and a little fresh water ( constant ly piisaiiiL, into the reservoir, and with. rich bah Bcpuruti 1) detached and with room to Low, have the best possible chance Dioso mo precisely the conditions which are obtain- able without difficulty in the trenches constructed by draining of seaside swamp the second advantage is, Mint, there is a minimum of cost and a maximum of result. The (she when young mo deposited from three to four inches apart, and left to grow It is impossible! to l odds of the expenditure of labor below that of simply putting them down and taking them up in America there is not only an immense local consumption of oysters, but there is a large export trade in preserved oysters The establishments now multiplying in this country for preserving meat could without difficulty use then appliances for the preservation of oysters, and us we can produce them cheaply we may got into an export trade as soon as the production h fib got well be y and the local consumption But that local i consumption is at present only in its infancy, and us our railways hung the interior into easy communication with, the seaboard, the inland demand will steadily increase the magnitude of the trade in America is astounding In New York alone it is stated, in " Chambers) TCnojolopaîdiu," to amount to not less than £1,250,000 annually, and in Baltimore the wholesale value of the annual catch is officially stated to have been £1,000 000 in 1871 an amount that bears no insignificant compari- son with the annual value of our wool. The American coast has no advantages of climate over the eastern coast of Australia, though the producers there have doubtless the advantage of an i among local men diet The value of thopiodttct, as compared with. the area required for its cultivation, is very large Giving each oyster six square inches, and making ample allowance for waste room, an acre of trenches will accommodate more than a million the oyster is said to take four years to mature for the table, and to be reproductive in the fifth year and this period will probably be expedited under cultivation Allowing the longest time, there is a production of 200 000 or store per acre per annum, which, at the customary calculation of 1500 oysters to the bushel, gives 13 bushels to the acre Four shillings a bushel is at present obtainable as the wholesale price, which would give a gross return of £20 per acre It should also be borne in mind that by cultivating oysters every opportunity is afforded of selecting the finest stock for reproduction, and that a horse is probably as much scope for improving the breed of fish as there is of improving that of animals, uri the by providing speak l>"-°<"flB <?'«'«* us if Btru turn of the young and if) we again presented, and allowed of working out a bed "'ï"obkcdVafm Una fight, with the prospect of a rapidly growing less' consumption, and an indefinite market for the preserved fish, this in dustry, which has long been neglected, is capable of growing into one of very great importance Those landowners who own salt water swamps, and those free selectors who know of spots suitable for the business, should study the of rota and figures now laid before them, and consider what her there is not a potential source of wealth lying road to their hands, and whether Australia is not capable of emulating America in the profit to be drawn from its foreshore and its low lying coast lines Sydney Morning Herald A Victorian country paper relates a ghost story On the night of the 8th January, " about 9 o'clock, on the Rev Mr Bailey, accompanied by two of Mr Hughes' daughters, was driving towards the haven, when opposite Mr Wuinhold's paddock, near the Lake Hotel, Mr Bayley saw a gaunt female figure, dressed in flowing white robes, use out of the ground and extend her arms right in front of the horse. The animal became frightened, and bolted right through the figure Miss Hughes exclaimed, ' Bear me, what was that?' Mr. Bayley endeavored to pull the horse up ; but on he dashed, I nor could he be induced to stop till be reached ' the gate at Millhaven "
