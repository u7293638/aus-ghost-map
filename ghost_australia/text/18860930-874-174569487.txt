DRAMATIS PKUKON'.^..—Two gentlemen connected with tlie " perfesh," one having rece?itly returned from a theatrical tour % PROPERTIES.—A walking-stick, four bunches of fives, twohats, and brains—well, they were no on the property list, no brains; in fact, it was Parliamentary all through as regards the use of language and, the scarcity of cranium furnishings—a waggonette and horse in the background. BURLY TBAGEDIAN.—" Sir, a word with you—you have not paid xnv better-half, the fair Ophelia, her last week's spondulicks." THIN TRAGEDIAN.— 1 "Liar and slave." B. T.—" You're a rainbow-tinted scoundrel." (BUSINESS.—Both commence trying to hand-paint cadi, other's peepers. Then the stick is dropped.) T.T.—" Give me mv stick, sir." B. T.—" I, will." (And he did, and dusted his jaclcet like our good wife operates on the carpets at home, while we are walking up and down tlie passage nursing the family—twins. General rally and Maypole dance around the waggonette, a case of hide and seek, more "hiding" than seeking, though. Enter, cautiously, to slow music, two gloved, lielmetted and buttoned guardians of the law.) First Officer.—'" Now, luk yiz here, move on out of this, with yez, for a man never sawsich a thing in the whole course of his natural life. If yez don't move on, I'll put yez where the ghost won't walk for some time to come." (General scatter, and exit everybody through invisible blue fire. Curtain .')
