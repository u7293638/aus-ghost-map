There is a sadjr true story connected with that old stone house close by. For the ghostly part of it I'll vouch nothing. ' Many years ago this place belonged to a wealthy ola villain named Sludge. He was one of a sort very common in the early days of the colony1. Men who made money by all sorts of shady practices. I He had one child, a daughter, on whom he spent large sums of money, and through whom he ex: peoted to be recognised by people who would not otherwise notice him. His one ambition was a grand marriage for her ; and to this end he was always publishing the immense fortune he was prepared to give her. She was nicely educated; a pretty ladylike girl ; and bis ambition was at last gratified by an offer from a middle-aged gentleman who held a high position in Sydney, and who was willing to overlook the father-in-law he was getting for the sake of the girl and the money. ' She was very very adverse to the proposed mâtohy but her father did not then know why i ' Poor thing ; she was young and motherless, and the greater part of her time secluded hérè. It appears that in her lonely rides and rambles among these mountains she met her fate. How much she knew about him, no one can say. Young, handsome, and mysterious, he had influence enough over her to make their meetings frequent, and she loved him 'with the! love that was her doom.' He was passion ately attached to her, and gave her a ring -said to have been an heirloom-about which he. WO-B superstitious, and exacted from her an oath that1 Bhe would never part with it, telling her that while she wore it and was faithful, no matter what parted them, they would meet again. Un fortunately for both, their meetings hada witness -a creature of old Sludge's, who suspected and watched the girl, and more than suspected who her companion was. Old Sludge was returning from'a long absence, and the spy met him a few miles from home, and told him all he knew. The old'fellow reached home like a devil. Meeting the girl'outside; he toro the ring from off her finger; and ground it into the earth with his boot.;; She was made a prisoner in her own room. The.same week a great muster of station hands 1;oók place ; and a body of troopers was sent for 'to make'a raid on a gang of bushrangers who had ïong been outlawed in yonder mountains. Poor wretches, they were escaped convicts. ' Their Wder.waa ia young desperado of good family, who had'g^t into somo trouble at home, for which, he ha'd ,been 'sent out hore. His. .spirit rebelled against the devilish cruelty practised on convicts in tbbse days. He not only made his escape, but assisted two'others to escape, after killing two of the'guardsl Well, old Sludge's spy had often supplied the gangHpth provisions from the station, for which man and master were well paid. This fellow now led'tho whole party on one of their camps. Two of them wore shot down before thoy knew whore the shots were coming from. The leader Btood alone and fought liko a young lion, leaving men dead land dying around him, till he was re duced' tb his last shot. He sent that crash ing through the brain of the man who betrayed them;; Ho was shot down at last, and his body^ riddled with bullets, was brought to a hut on.tho station. Old Sludge brought his daughter suddenly into tho prosence of the dead; and his suspicions wore confirmed. The Bight of tho mangled body of tho man she loved so madly destroyed ker reason, She was a maniac from that';hpm','. harmlessly but hopelessly insane, foréyér 'jfltoaling away with any sharp tool abe tould.get, and¡digging into the earth for her lost j ring,;^i,th so'me dim notion that if she could find -, it'".

' There, numbed with the cold, she had lain "down and died-her broken heart and wandering mind at rèst above the broken pledge of her. unhappy love. Her death and ' the f ailure of all" his plans made old Sludge drink deeply. He was found one morning half-roasted in his own fire, into which he had fallen while drunk. , He died next day, and the place passed through many hands before father bought it, fifteen years , ago.
