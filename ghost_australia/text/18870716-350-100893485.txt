The Spirits of the Dead. ' Sitting lonely in the silence, camio the phantoms of the past, And o'er my heated fancy their shadows thickly cast, Till the ghosts of buried memories o'er the chamber silent tread, And I seem to hold communion with the spirits,of the dead. While chill amid the ether that round mo whirls in space, The flutter of their pinions seems to cool my tired face ; And the odour of their presence as a subtle incense strong, , Floats before my jaded senses like a dream of mel low song. I feel sweet spirit fingers lightly press upon my hair, Till' the weary brain responsivo seems to cast away all care, E'en as tho'their unseen presence boro with it a , healing balm, • As that voice of old, on ocenn, cast a deep,'and , sudden calm. Stay awhile, ah, well-loved spirit, if thou really standest by, Let mo feast my eyes a moment whero my thoughts forever lie ; Or if thou art but a vision, borne of dreaming long and deep, But a mirage of the senses, but a picture drawn by sleep.. Then oh slumber, lock thy chambers, that no other cuter in, Let mo stay awile with fancy, pure from earth and earthly sin Let me meet my long lost idol freed for aye from death and pain, Let mo see, she but remembers—tlion I have not dreamed in vain. '■•/ Nearing now, till I can almost, feel hor breath upon my cheek, , : ' Though tho faco sooms brighter, fairer, comes, tho1 vision that 1 seek'j : ' ' And 1 gladly spring to clasp it, this my love of days now old, ; ■ But alos, as cold as marblo, is tho form my arms • • enfold.'■■■■" ■ - While a voice which seems to echo somewhat of a distant day, Qontly whispers, I may never, givo you back a love of clay— • • ?. That amid tho dust lies burled, with tho form you loved so well, : ; Novcr more to hold dominion where a purer Ihomo may dwell.v ' - Yet oast thou aside tho idols which besot an earthly life, So that whon the fight is over—and thou loav'sttho weary strife, , I may meet thee at the portals, with a hope that lasts alway— Then thy dream will bo etornal—for our love will bo for aye. .
