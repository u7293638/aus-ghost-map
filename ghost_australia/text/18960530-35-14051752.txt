to-day." And wo may bo protty suro that bis Ornoo of Buckingham lind tho cold look roflootod in a dozen difforont ways before the sunshino of lho regal sniilo was roslorod to lum. In tlio days of tho famous Cabal tho daily levóos at Whitehall gnvo as inuoh nn index of men's 'minds as a division in tho Houso of Commons to-day. Tho_ crowd of adventurers, politicians, Papists, and broken couutry gentle- men might knoir from the gossip of tho levúo whethor thoir for- tunes woro on the wnno or in tho ascondnnt ; and porhaps whon ono's mind easts back from a modorn Iovéo, this period of English history is ns typical aud in- structivo as any to turn to. Not, of cûui'so, that tho lovóo is nu English institution, or that it dates from tho Stuart dynasty. Louis XTY., lho " Grand Monarch," was famous for his levóos, It was at those gorgoous assemblages that courtiers might hopo to and actually did riso iuto sudden faino and power by somo fresh iniquity devised to wring funds from tho impoverished poasantry ; and was it not hoio that Coi.iii.ut, at ono timo tho financial master of Franco, and perhaps of Louis himself, overthrow tho daring Eououcr ? lloro, too, the peace of Europo was gambled for by unsfrupulous courtiers, tho prize being tho King's favour and all that at- tached to it. In Italy MACiiiAVi.r.r.t had long beforo formulated Court intrigue into a science, and it was at tho lovóo princi- pally that the intriguer studied, so to speak, tho points of tho gamo. Tho origin of tho levúo is probably ns old as lifo itself. In difforont shapes and under widely differing conditions it sooms to havo existed always. -lu tho oarliost times wo road how tho primitivo pooplcs paid homage to thoir rulers-and tho inolhod and manner of thoir hotnogo woro really at tho much-translated, much transuiogrifiod, levco of to-day. In tho Scriptures tho Mosaic law is oxpress on tho point of how tho ruled aro to nssomblo and pay dofor oneo to tho rulers, and in tho most nnciont book known to literature, onl)' recently translated from tho papyrus, " Tho Book of tho Dead," is to bo found tho incessant lccurronco of tho lovóo of that timo. If a prominont foaturo in tho lovées of theso primal ages was tho gifts of tho suppliants, it is ODly n characteristic of fondai rulo in all timo. To-day n couplo of visiting cards and a dross suit aro sufficient equipment for tho freo citúon who wishes to mark his rospoct to tho ropresontativo of the supremo power ; but, thou, customs always survive thoir immodiato uso. To-day it is a moro voluntary tendering of rospect to tho Sovoroigu, who only re- tains somo outward symbols of autho- rity, tho substanco having long sinco passed out of hor grasp. That was not so whon St. Simo.v wroto his famous "Momoirs pour Servir," whon not to stand well with the all-poworful Ministor was to put onosolf outsido tho favour of tho King. Nor wasit so whon tho blind reverence attaching to tho moro sight of royalty was so pro- found that hundreds daily prosontod thom solvcs at Court to bo " touchod " for smallpox and othor deadly diseases-as late as Cluoen Anne's time Johnson was so takon ' lo bo curod of tho scrofula-whon a pool's famo or a soldior's reputation was to bo mado or marred in tho lovóo room at Court. If it did nothing olso a flyiug retro- spect of tho lovóo reminds us, at auy rato in England, how far behind aro tho times when the divino right of kings was unquestioned. At tho samo timo wo shall not forgot that measured by j'enr3 tho spaco is not great. Mr. Lecky may be pessimistic of domocracy, and it may ho that a domocracy is going ultimately to fulfil tho vory worst fears of a certain class of prophets ; but nt the long last wo shall hardly ro- tura to tho stnto whon tho Kiug'a levóo was one of tho chiof factors to bo reckoned willi in politics. Politics have "been banished from tho Court, or if a traco still romains it is only that mild sort which concorns itsolf with fashions And tho nice conduct of a clouded cano, or tho bestowal of a titlo. But it by no moans follows that so long as Courts romain, and iudood whother Courts remain or not, wo shall havo wholly parted from ceremonial in our public life, or oven from tliis particular ceromonial of lho lovóo. (Joromonial will find a way of adjusting itsolf to public institutions, whatever form thoy may assumo. Tho lovóo, under the name and slightly altered form of a Presi- dential recoption, is an indispensable cere- monial at tho "Whito House at Washing- ton. Indeed, tho lovóo or tho recoption is a necessary function on the part of tho hoad of the Stato, ns supplying the moans of formal social contact with the gouoral community of citizens. If the head of tho Exocutivo is not to exist ns au iuvisiblo abstraction, thore must bo theso opportunities of coming into visiblo ro- tation with the pooplo. And this brings us to the function of tho lovóo in such a community ns ours. It brings tho Governor into contact with tho public in these, so to speak, official relations, ho standing as representativo head of tho State, thoy as its citizens. The symbolic value of the ceremony has not diminished by transplantation to tho anti- podes or to thoconditionsof democracy. The levée allows the oitizon at once to pay his tributo of recognition to tim unity of tho Empire, and to the position of tho Gover- nor as roprosontulivo of the Sovoroign and as constitutional hoad of our system of govornmont and of social lifo. And whilo tho lovóo remains tho best way of coremonially oxprossing theso relations and recognitions wo may dopend upon it that, howovor political conditions may change, patriotic citizens will be led on tho duo occasions to don tho dusky garments of night in tlio light of day, and to walk uncomfortably in tho glaring sun-1 ehino to pay thoir formal respects to his Excelloncy the Governor. Tho oigamsing habit seems to have dovolopod so much 111,010 largely 111 America than any \>, hore oleo that it is no mattet foi surpiiso to find a dologato of tho World's Student Chnstian Tedeiation from that county coming boro on a mis sion to invito the co opcintion of oui own University undergnduatos The critic of the movoment may suggest that it lies outsido the scopo of our Univorsitj and ita work-that, inasmuch as oui oduca tional system irom baso couiso to finial ii constructed on puiolv soculai punciplos, any innovation of this sort «ould bo 111010 01 loss m tho natuio of nn mtorforonct with that system Oi it may bo urged that we havo oui denominational colleges within the Umvorsit3 oxpiessly ostab liBhod to do the vtork this oigani6ation aims at doing , oi, again, that wo havo no University liio boro in the w oil undoi stood acceptation of that toi in, and hence that tho organisation is not noedod by oin studonls ns it is m tho Unn efitie^of Eng land, Amenca, Gormanj, nnd olso^hoio, whei 0 it has ah cady established iloui ishiiig bianchos It may bo adnnttod that theso objections cortainl} do apply in vanous degioos of appropriateness , but no ono of thom seems senous enough to affect the essentials of Mr Mon.'s proposal Wo can quite agroowith thatgentloman in what ho has to say about the poasiblo mfluonco of the Unn ersity, though so far M e havo had Ino local ¿lustration, of its working. It ie' only by tho uso of a highly courageous figure of spoech, for instance, that the most sanguino obsorvor would speak of tlio Sydnoy Univorsity ns a " centro of iníluonco in tho strategic points of our civilisation," or say Wiat ns that institu- tion goos 'so does tho body of public opinion round it. Wo must walle boforo I wo can run in thoso matters, and so far our University is nn institution for loc tures and examinations, ntlondod by day and ovoningSstudonts for tho most part, and having littlo moro in common with | that University lifo of residonco, associa- tion, and traditional onviromuoiit which is essential to the higher idçal of an Eng- lish University. Bat so far from this being a roason against tho practicability of Sir. Mott's proposal, it rallier seems to work in favour of it. Thom is a good donl in what ho had to say about tho growing impression that, though Christian failli and practice may bo making ground among tho gonoral forces of society, this is not tlio enso whoro tho Univorsities and tho thinking poitiou of tho public aro cou cornod. Tho average undergraduate is moro likoly to bo infected with this beliof tlian most othor peoplo, bocauso ho finds himsolf just in tho circumstancos and at tho ago whon ho imites n budding poreop tion of his own montai powers to a beau- tiful "cocksuronoss" about everything out sitlo tho raiigo of his examination papors, and particularly in tho domains of philosophy and roligion. Ho has formed, as a rulo, moro conclusive judgments than ho will bo ablo to rockon to his intolloc tunl crodit nt a malurer ago, and ho has not yot arrived at a perception of tlio face exprossod so torsoly by ono who know tho spocios well, that oven the youugest of us may occasionally bo mistaken. But ho is peculiarly opon to tho influonco of his surroundings, and ¡tho ¡impression ,16ft by a cortain lino of desultory reading outsido his acadomic course, t!io indirect iníluonco of a popular professor whoso sceptical viows may loud au irregular intorest lo tho mattor of his lectures, or tho daily contact; with undergraduato fooling as it oxprcsso" ilsolf in his companionship and associations, aro all at work to móVld bia character and tastes and produce results that novor apponr in tho answors ho givos to tho questions sot him at oxaminaiion. At tho oidor Univoraitios it has always boon tho custom for young mon to form " sots " for study, amusomont, or tlio cultivation of somo congenial pursuit. Somotimos thoso movements have boon in ono direction and sometimes in anotlior. Wo havo hoard of Diunitor and Voltahie finding disciplos, occultism in all its forms dovoloping enthusiastic dovotoos, and soorot socioties of various kinds establish- ing thomsolvos among tlio undergraduates o£ difforout Univorsities. Now opinions find a ready soil among 3-oung, recoptive, and rostloss intellects, and this is ono of the reasons why Nihilism discovers its most promising matoral in the collogos and Uuivorsitios, nnd why thoso institu- tions, from Salerno to Paris aud from Bologna to Oxford, havo always boen tho soothing hotbeds of novol political and social speculation. Tliero is a good deal of immaturo " young-mannishncss " about all this, of course, and in most cases tho offervosconco passos off like tlio bubbles of aorated waters as soon as thoso young mon aro turned loose to find a Horions foothold in tho world. It is only hero and thoro that tho lledgling singes his wings beyond recovery, or that a Shelley beats his littlo lifo out against tlio bars. It would be, iudoed, a etrnngo thing if in the whirl of all this rostiossnoss tho fascination of religion failed to make itsolf felt on. the undergraduate mind. As a mattor of fact, wo know that it has pro- duced some oC ils most far-roaching olfocts from within Univorsities. A rocent writor on these institutions has boon tell- ing us, for instanco, that tho Beforuntion was born in a University. In England ilsolf tho great Wosloyan movomeut drew its lifo and being from the influence oxortod upon a circlo of associates by two young students of Lincoln aud Christ Church, Oxford. Evangolionlism in tho Church of England probably owes moro to Cambridgo than lo any othor source. Tho revival in tho Church of England known as tho Oxford movement took its riso within that brilliant circlo of young men who surrounded Newmast at Iho height of his fame, and which includod such well-known figures as thoso of Puii or.vAi, nuniiELL EnouDi;, AVajid, Pusey, and others whoso namos are part of tho intellectual history of tho period. If tlio object of tho World's Studont Christian Federation, which has now been intro- duced to the notice of the undergraduntos of our own Univorsity, is lo provide en- couragement and an outlet for this side of their intellectual activities it can hardly fail to bo a good tiling, for tho stoadying influonco of roligion itsolf will bo a gain, and tho oncouragomont of a co-oporativo spirit in such mattors eau hardly fail to suggost confidenoo aud mutual aid to thoso who may fool in need of it. Wo aro not awnro that our Univorsities in this part of tlio world aro threatened by a sirocco of intellectual scoptioism or any- thing Uko thatfovor of rostlossness which now and then has boon known, to swoop, over such centres olsowhoro, b,ut it can do no harm to mako it plain to the under- graduato minti that tho study of the humanities is not necessarily a thing inimical to tho ovidoncos and practice of ovoryday Christianity. And if such a movement is to be onlorod on, it would be as well if it woro to be mado a broadly in- telligent and real movomont-not a moro pyrotechnie display of revivalism and iutormittont .onthusinsm, but a movomont for the cultivation of an interost in tho philosophic sido of tho .Christian systom, so that tho intellectual curiosity of studious young men may havo somotiiing upon which to oxoreisoaud gratify itsolf. Some coriüspondonoo which was pub hshed latolj in tho Jfeiald directed attention to tho grov.Hi of that luvon llo class which is mado dopon dont upon tho Stalo Sohcitudo in tins lospoct is much to bo com monled, for not only is tho Stato, moaning the community injuiod whon pnionts nie oasilj poimittod to íoliovo thcmsolvos of (ho obligi tion to train and maintain thou offspnug, but the lattoi aio often tho sufieieis by coming undor a legnno which dopnvLS thom of tho disciplino and tho stimulus of familj lifo Incidont to this question is nnotlior which is laisod by oui conespoudont ' Pntnot " Tho writor is stiurlc, ns so iiiinj othoi obsonors 010, bj tho amount ot fiuancviioin school tho loosenoss of coutiol ovei children, and othei unpleasant foaturos of social ordei A constant ctiiso of troublo and complaint is found m tlio diffoionco between tho enrolment and tho attendance of pupils m the pumary schools No doubt na long as human natuio lomains as it is llioro «ill bo a disiuüluintion in tho average boy to his tasks ho will cioop liko a snail uu w illmgly to school as ho did in tho dajs lihou biiAKLsi 1.A1 L took him foi a ¡lattoin o£ ono of tho sovon rges Hie leisuro got by tiuancy m laigotoiwisia notcommonh spout in wajs and with associates that tend to piont ihoro is a piogiessno detcnoiation of chniactoi nnd a growing unfltnoss for tho boiious woik of lifo At this stago, uuleij thoio is on tho part of tho paronts a know ledge of the souro6 of iniechiof and a determination to avoid it, the drift begins, and tho boy ontors n path that onds in tho punishments or the salutary restraints of tho law. Prosontly tho youngster becomes uncontrollablo, and he is disposed of by boing sent on board tlio training-ship, or to a refor- matory if an offendor. If such bo his fato, so muoh tho more fortunato ho; otherwise in most cases ho is dostined to the ranks of tho " pushes," lo loafing, vagrancy, crime, and waslo of life. This is sometimes tho caso of wolbcondi tioncd boys ; it is very ofton tho only caroor of tho neglected and tho poor. Tho lattor aro the class to bo considorod. Tho clovor and ambitious in all ranks can bo left to thomsolves ; tho ordinary childron of well-ordorod homes aro equally boyond (ho caro of tho Siato, but not so the waifs and strays. Figures show how nuinorous theso aro. Last year tho Stato Children's Roliof Board had 599 boys apprenticed, but still undor ils control. At tho samo timo thoi'o wero upwards of 350 boys abonrd tho Sobraon. There wore 25 boys in the Carpenterian Reformatory at East- wood. In other words, nearly a thousand lads woro moro or loss completely wards of tho Slato. And thoir numbors grow steadily. Tho recommendation of our corre- spondent, not with regard to such boys as aro proper subjects for reformatory treatment, but for poor boys whoso parents dosiro to traiu thom up to a country life, is to establish a national farm. Thoro is a good doal to bo said for this proposal. It would bo a moans of restoring tho balanco of popula- tion, by returning a number of town youth to tho country, whilo tho country youth show a marked toudonoy to rcsoit lo towns. If such a schomo woro startod no one can doubt that with good nianago mont it would bo useful by saviug many from wastod livos. Indocd, tho plan has much in its favour, but for tlio initial difficulty of how to solcct thoso who should bo tho subjects of the oxperimont. Wo cannot ask tho Govornmonl to summarily draft off to a country farm evory youugstor whose attendance nt tho noarest Public school is no1 exemplary, and whoso parents would liko him to bo trainod (at tho Stato charges) to n country lifo. Tho most paternal Govornmonl would hositatoat thal. It would be too wholosalea transfer of obligations. And yot, on tho othor hand, it is a grievous thing to wit- ness tho spoiling of usoful mon for want of somo little supervision and help. Un- questionably tho rural lifo has advantages for health and usefulness which could bo desirod for the thousands of city childron who, as things are, soom predostinod to ovil. This has boon recognised and proved in such philanthropic works ns tho sondiug of tho noglected children of London to Canada, or, in Victoria, by tho system of apprenticing children to farms. In this colony, tho same lesson has boon taken to hoart. Of lho 599 boy apprentices under control of the Eolief Board soven- oighths aro with farmers. Tho far greater number of discharges from tho Sobraon tako place to onablo boys to accept service in country places. ^Indood, this tondoney of tho lads from the training ship to go inland for their livelihood has led to consuro ironi persons interested in tho growth of nn Australian marino class. It was oarly hoped that, tho Yornon would send lads to the forocastlo and lho dook, but it soon oppeared that, whothor thoir dosii o was or was not towards lho sea, tho land claimod thom and kept thom. It thus appears that tho Stato doos in earnest for its charges what " Patriot " asks on behalf of tho boys who, without coming Into that category, aro in danger through neglect of ultimately drifting into tho reformatory agencios. ' Probali»3r, however, thero is room for a considorablo extension of tho idea. "Whilo it has to bo romombered that in every rural neighbourhood thoro aro growing lads who havo to bo providod with employment, and whilo , tho average country rosidont has a cer- tain dislike to town lads as boing moro artful, less docilo, and loss capable of hard work than country lads, it is the caso that for youngsters of a good stamp thoro is always a doniaud inland. They aro not wan tod exclusively for farming, but as useful, all-round hands. Rand- wick Asj'lum has sout out hundreds and lho Vernon many moro. Tlio terms would not tompt. ambitious parents, but thoy would satisfy peoplo who chiolly desire to remove thoir sons from bad asso- ciations and place thom in hoalthy and honest surroundings. It seems (hat in arranging this transfer thoro is room for somo voluntary agency which could do for youngsters not yet out of control what tlio Stato has to do for its wards. Next it may bo thought that sooner or later juvenile offenders will bo troatod separately, not by tho inhuman cell, tho plank bod, and the broad-nnd-wator diet, but by hard work on somo isolated Crown lands. There, removed from the infamy of thoir surroundings in gaols and tho despair breeding rigourB of their disciplino, thoy may bo truly reclaimed. For thoro only is any application of tho bar raok system tolerable. Boys and lads that aro not real criminals, But only viotimB of thoir temporamouts and of noglect, oan novor bo bonofited by treat- ment in the mass. Tho mothod by which individuals are selected by ago and health and othor circumstances for places in country homos, is plainly lho natural and tho kindly method.
