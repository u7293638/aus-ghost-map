LIABILITY OF SHIPOWNERS FOR IMhJS OF LADING GIVEN FOR WOOL PRIOR TO SHIPMENT. j -* 1 - TO THE EDITOR OF THE HERALD. Sir-Your correspondent, '. Colonial Experience,' in to-day's paper, makes use of illustrative arguments in support of his case, which seem' rather to prove an opposite conclusion to that he has arrived at as to the liability of shipowners. , Delays, with reference to the recent fire, that " the store is a place of convenience for the ship and shipowner " she might have added also the shipper") " the same as on a shed on the quay or dock, where goods are lying awaiting shipment," and he instances a case of the A. S. N. Co., in which goods having been lost or mislaid on their wharf, the company held themselves responsible. It needs no ghost come from the grave to tell us this that a dock company, wharfinger, warehouse keeper, or even the- A. S. N. Co., are liable for their own negligence ; but in the case of a fire being the ascertained cause of loss, their liability is not so clearly established. It is not an unusual practice in London for shippers to keep open a policy on goods at the wharfs, in I the " docks, or in transit, foe," such policy being in" tended to cover the risk of fire while in course of a Shipment, for which risk the Dock Company is not liable, 08 neither would be, effect under special' contract, the A. S. N. Co., in event of a fire on their wharf. - , , 1 To render the owners or even the e iptain liable, the case must be made out in a duToren shape, than that of the responsibility attaching to a fire receipt given by the captain or his agents for ,., mills to be shipped on board.
