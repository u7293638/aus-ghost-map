A CHILD'S BODY FOUND. The city coroner (Dr. Whittell) held an in- quest at the Elephant and Castle Hotel on Tuesday on the body of a male child which was found by two lads on Sunday afternoon in the South Park Lands. Maurice Chenoweth, an intelligent-looking lad of 13 years, gave evidence that while cross- ing the park lands from Park-terrace in com- pany with his younger brother, on his way to Sunday-school, he saw a parcel lying in some grass. It was a brown paper parcel tied up with string and tape. Picked it up, pulled some of the paper off, and saw what he thought to be an old dress. Oh opening the dress material saw the ear of a baby. Put the parcel down and his brother ran away think- ing it was a ghost. They ran to South-ter- race, where they met a gentleman who told them they had better tell the police. Then went back with the gentleman, and showed him the body, and the gentleman went up Hutt-street to see if he could find a policeman. Witness then left the body and went to Sunday-school. Was there advised to tell the police. In com- pany with another lad went back to where the body was, wrapped it in a handkerchief, and went towards the police-station, but on their way they met a constable, who took charge of the body. Dr. Poulton examined the body and stated that the child had been recently born and was fully developed, but had not received the necessary attention at birth. Believed it died partly from haemorrhage and exposure. The jury without retiring found that the child was found dead on the South Park Lands on August 25 and that its death was due to the want of proper attention at the time of birth.
