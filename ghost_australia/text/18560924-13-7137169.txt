CHEAP JUSTICE. To the Editor of the Argus. bir, A correspondent in your impression of Monday, hailing from Fiery Creek a tributary, I presume, of the River Styx has ventured to insult the august shades of my self and my venerable friend Richard ROJ. " He has aired his vocabulary at our expense, ' calling us. "musty old myths," &c.; He has, morever.iventured to puff up the pretension of a crossbred usurper, called Common-sense placing an Imperial crown upon his head, and making the vile plebeian clap hands, like a giant refreshed with wine, over the mighty and mysterious tomb in which our immortal bones repose. This is in the last degree un- grateful and disgusting. Under the auspices of myself and my venerable colleague, British law became the eighth wonder of the world. What is it now? Why, even the grinning ghosts in Charon's ferry-boat at Fiery Creek can af \-- ford to laugh at it. What (say they) is law and order, (meaning thereby myself and my venerable friend and mystic latin, and rules of evidence, compared with the Algerine luxury of "changing" a dishonest loafer on the gold fields? They may be very fine things at Westminster Hall ; but " cock- up " diggers with such musty old refinements. They are unworthy of the enlightened reign of our magnificent young giant-the aforesaid Com- mon-sense. Moreover, says " our correspondent " from Fiery Creek, magistrates can commit all sorts of Algerine extravagances at. present, Why then feel so sensitive at increasing their powers? When you have already sharpened their teeth, why hesitate 1 sharpen their talons? A Daniel come to judgment, yea a Daniel." I am. Sir. ftn.. L:, " JOHN DOE. tartarus, September, 1856.
