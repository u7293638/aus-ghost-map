Spiritualistic Frauds. Mr Maskelync, in an interview which appears in the English Illustrated Magazine,” gives the following account o£ liow ho Orst began to suspect the bona ihlesof spiritualism :—“ The tirst awaken ing of my interest in the exposure of spiritualistic frauds arose in this way. It was during my apprenticeship. Adja cent to our place of businoss there resided a man and woman who professed to effect cures by mesmerism. About that time table - turning became a fashionable amusement, and the Fox family had startled America by a second edition of the • Cock-lane Ghost.’ Well, these mesmerists commenced to hold spiritual istic seances, and one day the woman brought to our shop what she called a surgical appliance to be repaired. It con sisted of two levers, a long one and a short one, each mounted upon a pivot attached to a strap, and connected by a piece of catgut. As you may suppose,’ I en tirely failed to seewhatkind of surgicalap pliance this thing could bo, and wascurious to discover its real use. Having re paired it, I devoted a few minutes to experimenting with it, and found that by buckling the strap of the short lever round the left ankle, and that of the long lever round.the leg just below the knee, by pressing the right heel upon a projec tion at the side of the short lever the long one could bo jerked up and made to strike the under-side of the table. .Accord ingly, I booked it as a table-rapping apparatus, and tile bill was sent in: ‘ Re pairs to table-rapping apparatus, Is. fid.' This I considered very sharp on my part at the lime ; but it was about the worst thing I could have done, as it pre vented a complete exposure of these im postors being made. Although several persons, at my suggestion, attended the seances afterwards, ■ with the object of catching the lady red- handed, no table rapping was ever attainpted. This was a lesson by which I profited, greatly in my subsequent investigations.”
