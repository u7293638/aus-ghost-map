The darkness stirred-new. thoughts within-me. Hitherto-1 had not,troubled about Granfer Fraddams ghost haunting the' cave.' The :wihdj which wailed its, way up through thecave till it round; vent in the.copse above, explained the sounds which , had been -heard; - But how-all1 the stories which I had heard cam© hack > to me. Did Granfer Fraddam die theve - and did his ghost haunt this dreary cavern ? Even : then I might be sitting on the vpr.y.rippt where he had died. . - - ■ +- • A? , ' I started up and lit another candle.

"Then I heard a Irushing^ npise^hirr past Mie, and 'it seemed as though' aCgliO'stly hand had struck my face; J Directlyafterwards X heard .a cry. which made the.blood ruiicolcl in my veiris. Most likely it was only a seagull which I had frightened from its resting-place among the rocks, but to. me it was-the snriek of a lost soul. - -A ' "' ' ' ' ' - . Trembling, I-fonnd my way back to the cave again, where the candle still burnt and cast its flickering light around; . I.was afraid.to stay there any longer arid'determined to get out by way* Of the copse.-. I had gone but a .few steps in this direction when ! saw what .had.hithertp escaped"iny notice'. It was a hole in the side of the cave, large enough for anybody to pass ehsily.' . lEor ',a moment curiosity' overcame my fears' arid I -riiadeP'my'-way- towards, it. Holding'.' iny'.'candle'' close to the hole, -1 found that: I-Was out of-, the currerit of air, 'and T 'saw- that this was; the; entrance -to another.cave'.," But it wasdifferent from :the, one iri which Iliad been hidirig;' It looked-as though it'had beeU.hollowed. drit by.thOTiarids of man rather than by nature. Thm -fact lessened my ghostly Tears and I entered ft and iri doing'so thought I detected, a strarige Siriell. A miriute later and iny astonishment knew no bounds. - Lying at iny feet in this dinner'cave were casks of *-spirits and: wiries, v. There were, j rafterwards'; discovered, many'other Things thrirei too. : > There- were great packages -. of tobacco and bales of-stuff which.at thatyime.-i did not ■ understand;It was . evident:; that Granfer Fraddam's trade was; not abandoned, 'although it-was thought that.smuggling^was riot carried on-to any extent -in: the .rieighhor ! hood of St. Eve. It is true that many, things were obtained in the neighborhood; which the Preventive officers could nob .account: for,.-but that was understood to be owing to , Jack Truscott's gang, who defied, -.the law- and - did iriany wild deeds: down by the Lizard, and at Kynance. At Polventor the Preventive-men wero very keen,- so keen were they,, .that .th e dozen or two fishermen who lived there were riot, as far as I knew, in any. way suspected ox unlawful deeds. Arid Polventor was .the., only fishing village within three miles of our parish Where it seemed possible for smuggling to ba carried on. * ■ ' :" '-' |:* it, ■- Hot 'that wo thought . hardly ., of, the smugglers,:- even of ..Hack; Truscott, and. his men. We all regarded the law as very unjust, arid owing to the fact that: many;things were obtained in the parish very olieaply by them,, we winked at their doings and_ looked.sourly on the Preventive men and their doings... A® 'the'same time, -as far asH -.- knew, :no- one' dreamed of 'smuggling being darned on near, the' coast of 'St.: Eve.- - Thus it was _ That Granfer Fraddam's~erive' Was.a mere tradition,; arid many people thought the King's officers ought to be rem'oved'.fo some other part of. the coast where there would be some necessity, .for; their:existence. U ' ] i'l thought long .of these things, and pre-; aently came to-- the conclusion that - this cave was-used: as a kind of storage place by some smuggler's? gang.- ,aPrpbablya.this3yas.pne. cn Jack Truscott's many hiding-places and. would: be used' by him when, .the Government spies; were brisy watching elsewhere; esc i ' Afiyhow, iny discovery' made " me think; of the cave more as the-home of;;the living.„tbaii -the dead and-thus fears were,dispelled. ^rJtrls "tfu'e riiy solitude might at any time be broken :bv.a gang of desperate men,; but that -did not ■trouble me. ; So l fetched the blanket which, old Betsey : had- lent me., and ;took it into this inner cave and after a while went, to slgOD.". ■ 5.
