— u— a— n— b— — — i M— it POETRY. For Those Who Fail. All honour to him who shall win the prise,' The world has cried for a thousand years ; But to him who tries, and who fails, and dies, I give great honour, and glory, and tears. Give glory, and honour, and pitiful tears To all who fail in their deeds sublime ; Their ghosts are many in the van of years, They were born with Time in the advance Ol Timd. Oh, great is the hero who wins a name, But greater, many and many a time, Some pale-faced fellow who dies in shamef And lets God finish the thought sublime. And great is the man with a sword undrawn, And good is the man who refrains from wine ; But the man who fails and yet fights on, Lo, he is the twin-born brother of mine. Joa%uin Miller,
