THE SYDNEY HERESY CASE. [By Telegaplu] Sydneyj July 20. xne special general district meeting of the Weslejan Church, convened for the purpose of considering the heresy case preferred against the Rev. John Osborne, of the York street Church, agreed to the following find ing -.—First—After hearing air. Osborne's frank declaration of his belief in the Deity of the Lord Jesus Christ and His atonement for sin by His* death; in the deity of the Holy Ghost ; in the plenary inspiration • of the Holy Scriptures, and in the efficacy of prayer, and having heard also of his sincere attach ment to the Methodist doctrines generally embodied in our acknowledged standards, we cordially accept his statements as full and, satisfactory. At the same time we regret that bis method of presenting these truths is at times so inapt as to produce the im pression on the minds of some -that he is erroneous in doctrine. Second—In reference to the sermon delivered in the York-street Church oh Sunday evening, April 22, on Roman Catholicism, we are con vinced that Mr. Osborne is sound in the doctrines of Protestantism as held by-the Methodist Church, yet from the evidence we are satisfied that in the-former part of his discourse he was so unguarded in his statements as to appear to advance doctrines cot in harmony with our standards. Third, That the president communicate theforegoing resolutions to Mr. Osborne.
