TURF GOSSIP. Br UlBBLEDE.V. The weather at Williamstown was un seasonably hot, and the strong wind blowing from the north was by no means to the popular taste; but although several regular racegoers were away in Sydney, assisting at the A.J.C. Spring Meeting, there was a capital attendance at the bay view course. The sport, too, was interesting. The IIero, ridden with something like judgment, won the Hurdle Race withont an effort, his victory making the race at Caulfield look queerer than ever. Kangardo II. c.n pretty well, but lost ground at nearly every obstacle, and llipple, who is Busceptible to weight, tlso jumped badly. The Welter Handicap pro duced a very fine race. Up to within a few strides of the post it was impossible to say how it would turn out, first one horse and then another favouring the spectator; but Lord Richmond, coming with a fast run, got up just in time to wrest the prize from Per turbation and Defence, heads only separating the dieputtnts. Excepting the momentary exciteinput aroused by the spectacle, there was nothing remarkable in Lord Richmond's performance, and -even admitting that his form at Sandown-park was inexplicably wrong, he will have to improve a lot ere his claims to Cup honours can be seriously con sidered. Placida never had a fair chance, as she got badly placed on the rails, where ehe perforce had to remain. The Steeplechase was reckoned a good thing for Mon Ami, and it was nothing but | sheer bad lack that prevented the general anticipation bting verified. Jiram the fall! of the flag Mon Ami ".had tl}e_iield{at his j mercy, as he was nev|r {JiJtrof~a'"cafiter, ' but j approaching the ItfstTlfttce too slowly 'he j turned a somereapi^, /j was awarded to Warrio^, t£" it'~wa& bad luck /or Mr. Glaeseoek, nobof^-'lxjgrudged llr.

Only; (ibajid Brig and j Twiat had the temerity to oppose Wilton in the Ozone Handicap, yet at one time even money was obtainable about Mr. Miller's giant! The issue was hardly ever in doubt, Wilton carrying his heavy burden as if it j were a feather; and, judiciously ridden, his stable companion Ripple would just about have won the Hurdleracers and Steeple chasers' Fit! Race. The Messrs. Miller are 1 fond ol Beeing their colours in front, and there can be no doubt that the public does; but it frequently happens that the colours are in front at the wrong part of the race. It is all the same whether the race is three ] furlongs or three miles-every post must be a ' winning post It is a very successful stable ; its representatives win more races than any other stable'in, Australia, but it would be even more suoce&fu; 1, I venture to believe, if the jockeys associated with it wouid not be in soch haste toieach the winning-post.

J&, libe Itruiivkoomlnj? on rapidly, and may have in - the 'Osalfield Cod, iwQlj if jie is as good a hone M take it that Onward'a proximity detracts a good deal from the performance, inasmuch as Onward was beaten quite recently by Hughie, who would hardly be selected by an ex perienced trainer as a trial horse lor ft Derby candidate. Admitting that Bob Kay is on the small side, there can be no doubt of his gallopine ability; but takinp one, consideration with another, I think he will meet more than his match in, the - Victoria Derby, where he will j )iavf to meet new material in Challenger, ^Wallace. Kallara, and Auraria. Certainly fiiolt Ray beat Challenger and Wallace in the autumn, but I am not inclined to place too much reliance upon that form. While Bob Ray was atrunp up to concert pitch, his op ponents were decidedly off colour, and as the Beason advances this view of the case will probably receive ample verification. BoJ> Ray is by Traducer's son Welcome Jack I from Gage D'Amour, by Grandmaster from | Keepsake, and was bred by Mr. H. C. Dangar. Keepsake was the dam of Somerset, a colt that waB expected to turn out well, but didn't. In Darebin's year as short a price as 5 to 4 was taken about Somerset for the Victoria Derby, but he cut a most inglorious figure in the race, finishing absolately last. Bob Ray cost Mr. O'Brien 35 guineas only as a yearling. Mr. W. A. Long, a member of the Aus tralian Jockey Club committee, was it) Juek's ] way onSaturday,winningthree races withlfow scoich, Quiver, and Witchery at Rand wick. Hopscotch, who won the Epsom Il^^ieap after a severe $nd Dal meny, has alwayg^b^St^&gairdea; good horse. Mr. Long 6fidently regarded him as such. At the ?WncljjdojSj £di A.J.C. Autumn Meeuffig^Ir. Loqg made up his mind-or perhap^'^-dkjprt-tQ.^elljllop scotch, but when&R;'ofr^dfj3S<6had J been squeezed out of a'lifcdj^'tmrchaser. the auctioneer, Mr. Clibborn, announced that the horse could not be obtained for less than 1,200 guineas. Mr. Long evidently knew what he was about. Whether Hopscotch will win the Caulfield I Cup or the Melbourne Cup remains to be | seen, but the Caulfield handicapper, Mr. Barnard, can thank his lucky stars that the | horse has incurred the maximum penalty in V.A.T.C. event. With but 7st. 101b. on his J back Hopscotch might have spoiled the race, but a Btone extra weight may make all the ] difference between wining and losing. Hop scotch is by Grand Flaneur from the im- j ported mare Terara (dam of Patrol), by Hermit Dalmeny, who finished close behind j Couraliie, is an English-bred colt of Mrs. J.' White's, by the American horse Foxhall from J Bagdad, by Cameliard (son of Cremorne) from | Louise (half-sister to Hermit and Steppe). Dalmeny, who was bred by Lord Rosebery.} cost 90 guineas only as a yearling in Eng-1 land. Quiver, after her victory in the A.J.C. [ Spring Stakes, seemed to have an undeniably good chance of appropriating the Metro politan, and she started favourite; but, as. often happens on the turf, there is many a slip between the cup and the lip, and a§ a matter of fact she failed to secure a place. [ As far as Quiver is concerned, the result was quite consistent with her career, which j throughout has been a series of misfortunes, the mare having been beaten repeatedly when success seemed most certain. The winner, Nobleman, has hitherto been looked upon in the light of a brilliant miler rather than as a stayer, but he evidently possesses both stamina and speed. Nobleman is by The Australian Peer from Parados, by Henchman, and was bred by the late Hon. John Eales, vrho sold him a& a year ling to Dr. Anderson for 150 guineas. As a two - year - old, although he only once gained a winning bracket, Nobleman showed real good form, and in consequence he started first favourite for the A J.C. Derby won by Bonnie Scotland. A few days afterwards Nobleman had his revenge in the Biennial Stakes, beatinp Cobbity, Chesterman, Bonnie Scotland, &c.;, but curiously enough that was the only race he won last season. Nobleman is engaged in the Caulfield Cup, and, if the extra weight incurred iB not deemed prohibitive, he will probably pay Victoria a visit. Sir Visto's success in the Doncaster St. Leger is proof tluit his victory in the Derby waa not a fluke, as was at the time imagined, as he not only beat the horses he met at JSpsoin, but several fresh opponents in ^.Whittier, Utica, Matchmaker, Butterfly, and Teie8TOpeT~^r-¥9rk8hire crowd is not only enthusiastic, but unpr^jHdififi^Bnd I am sure the success of Lord RoseBefcT SI* tKB* famous Town Moor would be very popular, notwithstanding that he has lost caste as a i Parliamentarian.

Harrison, whom I can not identify, won the Horn Club Cup, the Empress Stakes, the Havelock Course Stakes, and the Serpentine Stakes, but the best horse at the meeting was Norbert, who carried off the Governor's Cup, the Turf Club Plate, and the Fort Plate Handicap. Norbert, who is by Golds brough irom Lady Laura, won the' Geelong Cap for the Messrs. Miller in 1892, beating such horses as La Tosca, Taurus, Annesley, and Tantaljon. The best pony 4a that part of the world appears to be Cowewel!, and Leah won several races. Among the other Australians that took part in the meeting were Boomerang, Lady Flo, Erebus II. (well known about Ballarat), Court Ball, Blackboy, Boyar, Flora, Bohemian, Cressy, Master Walter, Martindale, Repudiation (who won several races in Mr. W. R. Wilson's colours), Orlando, Whirlwind, and Ena. The English horse Fenloe was suc cessful in the Lawyers' Cup. The Duke of Beaufort, who has held the Whip since 1892 (says the Sporlinu Times), has surrendered it to the custody of the Jockey Club, as both Prince Soltykoff and Lord Ellesmere have challenged for it and he is unable to take up the challenge. Prince Soltykoff has named Lorikeet and Lord Ellesmere Glengall. There was a time when the Whip was he'd year by year by the champion of the turf, and there is a splendid array of names in its history. .It is the fact, however, that it has not been neid by a Derby winner since Thormanby, who was worthy of it, won in 1861. With sportsmen of the old school it was a cevcted trophy, and with Saunterer, Special Lie ?nse, and Thormanby, Mr. Merry held it for many years. It was wrested from him by Asteroid, who belonged to Sir Joseph Hawley. No man has hi Id it, however, so often as the Duke of Beaufort, who was always ready to challenge for it. He secured it for the first time in 1SS1, and with Petronel, Faugh-a-Ballagh, Eastern Emperor, The Cob, and Benburb, held it over a long term of years. The intrinsic valne of the trophy is about 5s., which is about what the two horses are worth who will compete tor it. Much indignation has been produced in English racing circles from the fact that Mr. Dwyer, on being interviewed on his return to America, declared he could get no fair play in England either as to handicapping or in hia jockey getting a fair start. As to the jocteey Simms not getting fair play at the post, the following statement made by Mr. Coventry, the starter, to the wellrknown turf writer "Vigilant," sp^kaidr-ltselfi .i Mr. Dwyer said :-" E vjpfJCxfeviCfe" was'empltfyedto de feat me. I . r. jWhgnsjre po have won, Harry Re&l; (o^e SIC iortef, Sipnis np) was left ai, l^f.post, the flag falling when the horse's li%a&.^"M,tnwied^h« ttroflg way." It is on this last^Meiberit Coventry comments as follows : "I always did all I possibly could to be fair with Simms," he added, "and whenever I learned after a race that lie had not (rot away as well as he might I felt sorry. It was only natural that I should wiehto let our visitors know that I wanted Uietn to hare fair play, and I invariably endeavoured to give the stranfier'a good chance, seeing that he might. first go off be at some slight disadvantage in not heinff so well np in the English style as our own Jockeys. Neither did Simms ever complain to me of un&ir; treatment. Frequently when tie seemed unwilling to join his hones have I told him what tcdo. When he walked up three lengths in front, he had no trouble in Retting his horse straight, but more freqneuUy, when he had no advantage, be would turn round And va.it. 'You cannot start, you know,'I oneo said, ' unless you are facing the riiiht way/ and It & a fact that be frequently appeared determined not to turn round when be could nave done so on equal terms with his opponents. ~Tfte suggestion, if Mr. Dwyer made it, is incomprehensible, and for my own eharein his indiciment i need liai-dl v »ay a contradictory word." " . - The writer of -the above points out that Mr. Dwyer stultifies himself, because after Baying tlie handicapper nftver gave him a chance, be says that in the race in question, which was a fotndj$ag, " he considered Harry Reed a certatH^'v^How coald the horse be a.cer tainty if quite oVPj^^&bted; 1 With all due respect to Yanfceeland, K^gIand"S?V^f0rd \- T7r-who have no sense of hjamoar^feaw*'©^onet," "have taken quite ^rioasl^^eatory aboirt theShahzadah expressing bkastonishment to the* Princeof Wales ^athejailowed his subjects to beat j|^>wo&j; ^ey;i)oint to the fiasco in < ' withthe Goodwood Cup^and they influence®! the - it» r *^ frhen the Prinw'd%or89 owed ^hrsilly^t ofi feigbtb^ve' nieWbpJbll success, and now that the luck has turned it fs lamentable to think that there are people who envy the Royal sportman the triumph he has waited for so long and patiently. Fancy the Shahzaiah giving the Prince of Wales racing wrinkles!" The postponed Moonee Valley meeting was not a great success. The weather waa showery, the attendance anything but good, the fields Small, and, with one exception, the finishes uninteresting. More interest was probably j taken in the Trial Stakes than in any other j fvent on the card, for Bruiu and Wilton met here at what was practically level weights. Wilton has shown Buch brilliancy ovvr short courses that many good judges were prepared to see him put down the CauifieM Cup can didate, but those who kid odd* on liruin had, as it tamed out, no cause for anxiety. After Wilton and Grand Brig had raced each other to a standstill, Bruin came along and, smothering Wilton in two or three strides, won with ridiculous ease. Vagrant had an easy task in the Welter Handicap; and Pyramid won the Steeplechase with any number of lengths to spare, Floater, the favourite, who shows unaccountably bad form on this course, getting no nearer than third. Perturbation, better ridden than at Williamstown, had no difficulty in account ing for the Northcote Handicap; and War Dance beat his only opponent, Em.\un-na Enuck, in the Preston Handicap. This was the best race of the day, War Dance winning by a short half-head only, and the verdict would no doubt have been reversed but for Emaun-na-Knuck's jockey losing a stirrup iron a short distance from the winning-post. Backers brought a good day to a close by laying odds on Granger, Jun., who won the Trot anyhow.
