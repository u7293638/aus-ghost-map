MEMORIAL-STONE LAYING AT MALLALA. A novel ceremony in connection with the laying of tho memorial-stone of a sacred edifice was performed on Tuesday, November 18, at Mallala. At 3 o'clock traps might be seen appoaching from the whole of the eight roads which join together in the centre of the town ship with numerous occupants of both sexes dressed in holiday attire. The land on which the chapel is to be erected is a very nice level site fronting two of the main roads. The building is to face the road leading through Dublin Area to Port Wakefield. The site has a frontage of 259 links to this road and 220 links to the one leading to Port Dublin or Dublin Bay. It was presented by Mr. J. Jeffries. A little delay being caused by having to prepare the four corners of the building, it was nearly 4 o'clock when the Rev. J. S. Wayland announced that all was ready, and that the trustees had followed a practice very prevalent in the mother-country of inviting four persons to lay memorial stones— one at each corner. It was the first time it had been carried out in this colony, but doubtless if it answered well it would not be the last. He then gave out the 609th hymn, the Rev. A. W. Wellington read a portion of Scripture, and Rev. S. Gray engaged in prayer. The first stone was then laid by Miss Jeffries, daughter of the donor of the land, the other stone being laid by the Misses Moody, Secomb, and Temby. The Rev. J. S. Wayland briefly explained the doctrines held by Primitive Methodists, and which would be faithfully ex pounded within the chapel about to be erected. Subscriptions were received amounting to £17 4s. 6p. The Rev. J. S. Wayland, on behalf of the trustees, presented each of the young ladies with a handsomely-bound Bible and Hymn book. Bottles were placed in cavities under the stones containing the Register and Advertiser of that day's issue, the last publication of the Privimive Mcthodist News, a few other papers, and a document, of which the following is a copy: — 'To whomsoever it may interest.
