WHO STOLE THE MURDER P . J. K M-AClNTYBE. I airi not Aware that auy author baa ever uudertakou to write a history of journalistic squabbles., Such a work; if not wost "edifying, woujd at lea*t provo very amusing, atid perhaps instructive. À large proportion of the tierce 'quarrels waged bditw'ceii newspaper scribds o'we their origin to the charge of plagiarism . and sometimes this charge ' extends, from wholesale robbery bf au article ^tp jho petty pilfering bf a sent-enc*. and'eyéu - to the ghost of another's liue of thought. It is probtble that th? readers, bf the Pèoplfg Weakly will hire iutr<>daced. to thom from time to time enrt aiu phases'nf plagiarist' and its attendant expVsurei. Ip ' the ' meantime, as a upo.sim.ou. or Ups* tration of this evil, Lventure to revivé au bid nibmpry of a nowspapur sijiiabjile which, probably, old Giftsg »,wites " uoW ¡in Melbourne and Sydney will remamber, I who will doubtless corroborai J "my story. ' Between ¡ thirty, and forty ; years agi£ 1 was a printer's " dëil " in' the om<re of the m North British Daily Mail, Glasgow. Siaarcely^had I hoon initiated into ¿the mysteries of printing-pyo- clearing add falley-pulling in particular,'and message« oy to roaster aud men in general-when the chief of our reporting s'aff (who was also one of bur sub-editors)' distinguished himself.

Carlyle,,in his speech to the Edinburgh students, said--" silence is tho ' eternal duty of all men."

But 0^- despised such commen-platee expedients,' He5 Vas aware that great thoughts were not born in a minute. He felt convinced that' an extraordinary thought was aboutto .be born out bf his own noddle. It was true tn the 'first flush of indignation the thought of secreting a rat trap among the HS to catch the hand of -the plagiarist naturally presented itself, but augry men think aud say very foolish things. Ha roust do something worthy of his reputed stirewdness~-souiething that would as* touish the world in general, and Glasgow in particular. Then the great thought was boru, and G- clapped hid hands, sud laughed loud and long. Drawing the chair towards his writing desk, he seized a peu, aud wrote an ac- count of a fictitious murder. The shepherd-tartanned scribe was qnite an adept at sensational writing when it suited him. The ghastly details of the horrific tragedy were " executed in a .masterly style, the perusal of which was calculated, as 'Dickens would say, to ** make the flesh creep." t&eadiug; over what he had written, he laid it in a conspicuous place on ids desk, when S- could not fail seeing it at a glance ; and laughing at the inviting bait with which he was going to catch hts fish, he purposely left his oditorimn to allow S- one grand and last pilfering visit. In due course S- came. The room was vacant. His eyes caught tho report of the awful murder. In a fow minutes his stenographic expertness transferred all the details. He lost no time in getting I to hjs own office, where he transcribed Jits I short-haud notes into loug hand. The aseount of the terrible murder was at ' once put into.the hands of the composi- tors ; and in the next issue of tho Glas- gow Citizen appeared a report of one of , itue most diabolical tragedies that ever set a newspaper public agape. Glasgow was horrified. The good people of auld St. Mungo shook their heads, and came to tho conclusion that such an " unco deed " clearly demonstrated that " tiie diel was in mair^laees than Dublin city." Meanwhile, the detectives and police ^ rushed to( the scene of alleged murder. ' Sp did other peeble. But the astonished -{elks of the libelled locality', were in 'blessed ignorance of anything occurring \- in their midst to upset their equanimity. !:*The police authorities then rushed to tho 'Citizen office f ir an explanation. Poor S- wished them to Jericho, He had been, cruelly hoaxed. No journal had contaioed a hint of the foul deed but his own; aud the foul deed.had turned ont to be a foul farco. - Then "Wea Cocky" flapped his wings and crowed . lustily. His crowing took the shape of a vigoróos article in the next issue x)f the Daily Mail, eutitled « Who Stole the Murder P" S-. jn the | ¿usumg, impression of the "Citizen," fotbrted in "au article headed " The Dnily : Jfaii Conspiracy.'' A lougaud releut ? less warfare <was then waved by - these two knights of the quill. <T- had an ab's op'ronent in S~r; but the jaunty .ling nf Woe Öoßty's" , articles amused the Glasgow ..public. At length *' Wee Geeky " had his revenge, aud. the matter was allowed to drop ont of print. There wer« however, certain Paisley weavers who looked across, their looms at each other, and whispered :-" That .noise amang fhe^Glesca scribblers"is' a doon rieht fraud, and wis got up tao bamboozle , V the 'public, ,-aod tusk baitU papers pay !"

What changes have taken jilace in th" . » literary and typographical departments i iof these two journals since their fainou i ' J squabble, I do not know, having been . ""' more than a quarter of a century in I ihese'colonies. ^ Scribes and printers must girow old and die like other .people; and durin^M^he whirl of thirty-six or thirty eight years many old faces must have ' dteap^ppared f rom bath ofiices, and few, if i'imy, of the old indentities occupy their (%^ieht positions. : ' : '^-Curley, th« printer's deiV' in writing [pois sketch, naturally fepls interested in ||the fajie of the old familiar «nés by, whom .wA surrounded m ^ the '?WêM-,J&tf;!fffî- Daily jtofit, in auld laug ; ayàë"i"attdtt»rthô hope that some' one pf (<j&»l#may i Jato.' .this, and. ans wer his. 2ttéríes¡~hé venture's to ask a's to Ibo wei-* ire or fate of Mr. Gunn, the then, proprietor ; Mt, Rummers, <the -. thea editor ; big Oraw^»dif>lf#( lfkcJ* Wffei Cocky," was partial Jo Bhpgerdf arian ; Thos.

Alas ! ye days o' auld lang syne, I'm ance mair wi' ye! The Hight of moró than three doeaies cannot prevent your having a resurrection in my memory. The vast expanse of water which separates Melbourne from St. Mungo, is no bar to me visiting my natal toon in imaginatioa. I long to be present with you in the body, even though I should be "a stranger in my native land." Since tho "Stolen Murder" attracted attention to the North British Daily Mail and the Glasgow Citizen, both papers hare steadily grown in influence sud in circulation ; aud tho Weekly Mail, I am told is one of the most widely-circu* lated journals in the' Britise Empire. Whenever a copy of it comes to hand, I think of " Wee Cocky" and his opponent S-, and wonder if they are still to the fore, or have passed over that river <<n the happy side of whioli journalists have uo squabbles, and scribes never manu- facture uoperpetrated murders.
