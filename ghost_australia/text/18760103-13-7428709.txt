QOLD.MININ.G.^JN. 1875. THE MINES OF BENDIGO. (FROM THE BENDIGO ADVERTISER, JAN, 15.) The operations in connexion with our mines during the past year have been everything taken into consideration, of a very satisfactory nature, notwithstanding the gloomy desponding view taken by some of the mining interest That a cloud has been, and still is to an extent, hanging over the district partly caused by the excesses of the mad period of 1871 and partly by the abuses and injurious systems which followed in the wake of the excitement that marked the times of the first " great rush in red letters cannot be denied , but it is pleasing to be able to state that this cloud is fast disappearing and that there are most re sonable grounds for entertaining a more hopeful view of the coming year an increase of pros penny and general success a taste of which would bring back the activity and increased gold returns from our mines experienced by them to so large an extent some few years back. Though there has been a considerable falling off in the total of dividends obtained by public companies, yet, a glance at the comparative statements made will illustrate that on the whole the difference between the operations of 1874 and 1875 is not so wide or so unsatisfactory as to cause any uneasiness in the public mind on the score of the decay of the quartz reef resources of this district, but, on the contrary, discoveries and explorations have been made during the latter period of the most assuring character, and demonstrating that quartz reefing has yet many a long bright day before it in Quartzopolis. If the returns below do show a falling off in the number of dividend paying companies, in opposition to this it must be stated that there are now a lesser number of coll making claims fewer of the " bubble' class which imposed so heavy, exhausting a tax upon the mining industry a few years ago. Operations have during the year been pretty much confined to old and proven payable reefs, on which deep sinking has made great advances, with encouraging and, in several instances,moBtsatiefactoryresults While the deep ground is being tested, it is important too that the shallower workings should not be neglected for it is the opinion of many com-. recent miners that there remains abundance of quartz it comparatively shallow levels only tested in part, and that with improved appliances for saving fine gold immense blocks of stone could be worked with payable results to the speculators Many a long mile of reefing country stands yet with scarcely a pick having been driven into it, but this will be an extended field for future years, at present sufficient scope is offered to the available capital on the well known lines which have for years given immense yields of gold. These old fields have not been half tested in fact, they are now only beginning to show some stability and permanency, which was accredited to them before Our oldest and most extensively worked mines are now more than ever the most prosperous and remunerative in the district, it will only require amalgamation to ensure the carrying on of continuous prospecting operations, the result of which need not be feared, judging from past efforts But without this desideratum, and if small proprietaries continue to conduct expensive, independent operations of the energies of the district and capital are to be frittered away in useless and unprofitable expenditure on work that would be avoided by amalgamation-the thoroughly testing and profitable working of our mines will be delayed until a wiser generation springs up, who will see the benefits of acting together in their mutual interests Economy of labour and resources are great features in mining, and, we are glad to say, have received some attention recently at the hands of those who are most immediately concerned If economy in mines were more studied, an appreciable difference would soon be experienced by shareholders in their actual profits ; but while no doubt great changes will yet be worked in this direction, there can be no favourable comparison made between the cost of working a mine of to day and one of three, five, and eight years ago when it took as many ounces per ton to make a reef pay as it now takes penny weights The list of dividends shows that £282 805 has been declared for 1875, against £410,01513? 6d for 1874, showing a considerable falling off during the year from which we have jUBtemerged.if no account is taken of the unpublished dividends declared by pit vate companies, and also of the profits or percentage obtained by a large number of small tribute parties However, even making allowance for this, it must be admitted that there is still a marked falling off ; but on couragement can be taken, and it is upon this fact that we found our favourable view of the past year's operation and of the prospects looming in the distance, from the statement that of the total of dividends for the year only £106,708 6s 4d were contributed towards it during the first half of 1875, as against £170 156 6s 5d. for the last half of the year ; thus showing that there has been a very great increase lately in the productiveness of our mines and had, he read Cuv>T£rCCi. SS .SVCUrsbly as it has ended, but very little difference would have existed be tween it and 1871 As it is, this difference is not so great, for if the approximate returns of dividends from private claims are taken into consideration, and there is added £20,000 to the list on behalf of the Johnson's Reef Gold Mines Company, a sum which they paid away for the purchase of Walker and Co 's claim and £30 000 which the Garden Gully United have had to lay aside, because of a lawsuit the year's total of dividends will be brought up to about £400 000 as against £500,000 for 1874 a result not so unsatisfactory, considering that only 58 companies contributed for 1875, against 73 for 1874 In calls there is a great decrease in favour of 1875 of £77 525 8s. 7d against the previous year, while the total of dividends over calls for 1874 compared with 1875 is only £80,225 12s. 11d , showing that to the speculator or investor there has only been an actual decrease of this sum for 1875 on the net profits resulting to him from gold mining Upon instituting a comparison, however, of the yield of gold, a most satisfactory result is obtained, In round numbers the value of gold obtained during 1875 was £1,107,000, against £1 255 000 for 1874, or only a decrease of £88,000 Altogether, the results of the years operations in our mines are satisfactory beyond even the anticipa- tions of many, and show a state of prosperity which will, we anticipate, be exceeded at the conclusion of the new year which has shown its first light to day The following comparative statement Speaks as forcibly and explicitly of the actual prosperity of the mines, and the success which has attended the past year's opera- tions in them, as could be wished for - COMPARATIVE STATEMENT.

These figures point to one of two conclusions as being correct-1st, that either the quartz crushed during 1875 was of a richer quality than that of preceding years, or 2nd, that a larger number of tons were crushed, but the facts are altogether in favour of the first conclusion An average in dividends per company has- been obtained of say 150 for 1873 of 5,24 for 1874, and of £4 870 for 1875 This decrease in the average per company leads to the conclusion that a larger proportion of the gold obtained from mines has been again sunk in them in carrying on permanent works or prospecting operations and also accounts for the decrease in the general total of calls. And this fact should also be mentioned, that generally mining companies have larger reserve funds now than they ever had before Of course it need not be pointed out that this wise provision for a rainy day is only made out of the actual products from the mine, viz., the yields of gold THE BALLARAT MINES (FROM THE BALLARAT STAR, JAN 1 ) The great facts of the year just past are, so far as the Ballarat district is concerned the development of the rich "alluvial grounds in the Creswick division and the increasing confidence felt in the permanence of the quartz resources of this gold held generally. Early last year the new Creswick grounds were opening out their wealth and since then heavy yields have marked the weekly and monthly returns As we write the grounds in question form the richest alluvial held in Victoria And there is little doubt if any, in the minds of those most familiar with the locality, that a wide and paying extent of country lies beyond as the continuation of the present opened up ground. The alluvial fields of Haddon Smythesdale, Scarsdale Springdallah Le have maintained their yields very well though there have been some names as the Golden Lake, Golden Stream Le falling out of the list of regular yields there, as in the central division. Iheeo changes are also a necessary element in alluvial mining for it is easier to com- pute the duration of an alluvial than of a quartz venture, and there must be constantly Some one or other alluvial company giving up the ghost But in the Grand Trunk Company's mine Springdallah, a gold bearing lode of quartz has been found which promises well for future prospecting At Staffordshire Reef and other places in the same direction, too, there has been a revival in quartz, mining while at Blackwood the old and new new lodes in the Sultan mine and the yields in Mounter Brothers and some other mines there is to show that quartz mining is grow- ing in importance all round us So we see that as was predicted years ago the great alluvial returns that in the past used to over- shadow the quartz yields have gradually fallen off in the older portions of the district, whilst the quartz returns have been steadily and dancing 1 his must be regarded as a most hopeful outlook for the future The yield of gold for the past year in this district cannot be yet ascertained with accuracy, even after the fashion of the usual approximate returns of the mining authorities for the returns for the last quarter are not yet available But there is little doubt that the returns when complete, will be equal to those of 1874 and probably superior. In connexion with this question, it may be stated that while the average quartz yield for the district was less in the last reported quarter-that ending 30th Sep- tember than in either of the previous quarters the average for Ballarat proper was higher in September than in June, and higher in June than in March The average for the March quarter was Sdwt, 12 19gr for June Bdwt 20 41(,r for September, Cdwt 20 70 gr and we learn from good authority that the latter average has been maintained and probably exceeded during the last quarter of the year from the returns for the three quarters already issued, we find that the quartz gold won amounted to 94 713 oz and if a third of that total be added we get a total of 126 28oz for the year 1875 as Ofeainst the official total of 105 8880. for the year 1874 We think this is a probable calculation as to the quartz gold for 1875 and when we consider the rich yields from the Creswick division we conclude that the alluvial deficits in the central division or elsewhere will be more than counterbalanced. The weekly reports of managers of companies published in our columns enable us to set down the winnings of all the public com- diaries or nearly all and those returns furnish a total of 146 33oz. for the year 1875. But to them have to be added the winnings of many co-operative companies who make no return at all or only to the mining registrars so that taking into account all the facts and probabilities we conclude that the gold obtained in this district during the past year may be estimated in round figures at about 100 OOOoz [According to a return forwarded to the Ballarat Courier the gross quantity of gold purchased by the Ballarat banks in 1875 was 175 000oz ]
