Mill'a strained, every nervo to keep the scoring: down, and after M'Ki's- wicket fell to a iigular crusliing liall, with lig lireak of Rico's. Sale's fate was iow left in theo hlands of'M'Millan and' Ovorend;- but 'iniattempting to make a rufntheliatter 'was cleverly run'out, the innings closing for 45, leaving Maffra victors by 4 runs. , Maffra.: ther .wornt to tle wiclkotetj commencing their.secorid iiniiigs with :Rico .arid -M'Lean ; tlhe' former " was. ibowled.7,, aind Wallenýijoined tlie cap tain; andibotween' theme gave the field, lots ofexercise, in the shlap'of leather liunting,' N.

Thei captains had arranged to cease play at a quarter to six, but the umpires most unaccountably let the game-proceed till long: past six o'ciock..

M'Lean, 8 runs no wickets ;:Rice, 4 runs four wickets.. The result of the match shows' that Maffra can hold their own in th. cricket. field against any teams they'are likely to meet this season, and though. Sale hadlost two good.men, so had Maffra. . After spending a pleasant hour or so in Sale, the victors left for home with the. 'Ashes: We would like to see' aLthirdt 'match played by these two clubs this season, and hope it may be arranged for -the first Saturday after' Easter available. Some annoyance was caused:: by the crowd of lads who : frequent the ' pavilion, and who, by thoir noisy cries, interfered with the players, and scorers as well. A gentleman present, a pro. minent resident of Sale, was so dias pleased that he administered a gentle castigation to one of the tormentors; but still, the proper persons to notice of these lads in the pavilion (we wouldl think) should be the committee of the S.C.C;, and they might also pay- some ittention to the cleanliness of the 'place, which could be purified at a: slight expense weekly ; and the person: who performs the work could also lay matting and assist the clubi in keeping .its agreed timne with visitors, without losing two hours as was the caseýinithler present match. By the -way,'vwhon is the Bairnsdale going to playtlie- return smatch ;I Mnfrav. went" theire and:got beaten, surely they:are entitled to their revenge. , " " ; ,, : SThle following are the scores of Satur-.
