It traverses .'.the; patriotic -purposes of M. Thiers—mingles. with the war talk of Yon Moltke—and levers the brain of Prince Bismarck on his'sleep-, less pillow. If, we may' calculate , by ; jtp vigour and vitality in the past, we have the most solid reasons ^to expect that thfe Papal • Supremacy ,will go on assorting its divine mission in all' the plenitude of its 'divine prerogatives, until High Mass shall be siing in every city and town and village of every country—in the centre of Africa as in the centre of China—and the grand cathedral of Pekin eclipse in size the . cathedral of St. Paul's, and .rival even the grandeur of St. Peter's. The command has been given,— "Go ye' into all the world—and jpreach the Gospel to every creature." This is the appointed task of the Church, and the omnipotence of God is the guarantee of its accomplishment. "Lo, I am with you all days, even unto the end of ttye world.", [Matthew xjcviii., .20.] And: humanly speaking, the very life of Christianity has depended on the Papal Supremacy.- The existence of pure and - iindefiled religion, as jevealed".by ..God, .seems, bound up in the existence of that Supremacy. It is the combining,-' vitalising' principle which secures the unity Of the' Church, and her unity is her life. .Peter was appointed by Christ to l)e head of the whole .Christian, body. This,headship binds alithemembers in one visible, ocmzuanipn, separate from all. To sever the head : ftbm thti. body would M certain death to .T^oith. The; whole,i|ijliclel world as well as ^'e , whole'Prbi^stant world, perceives, with a diabolical distinctness, that, tomehow\ or other y the Papal Supremacy is the grand secret of the Church's'strength, her^deciw ettulamcn—her glory and defence, and that all their.violence, oi all their craft, prevail not, against her, while the Papa! Supremacy opposes and defies them in thenaine of the Lord of Hosts. Hence the whole Protestant and infidel world—the powers • of heresy and hell conjoined,—are now daBhiri^themselves [against that •" Rock" on which the Church'B unity is built, vehemently, but Tainly desiring to sweep the Supremacy;' and with it . the Faith of Christ, His worship, and His name, away from the earth. To prevent' this atheistic catastrophe, is now, as ever, {and perhaps .now more than •ver r the work of;the Churohmiiitant—of all true-hearted Catholics. The battle, howevbr, is not'so much for the political power of the Pope, incl through him, of the Church, & B for his and her. spiritual liberties and privileges.
