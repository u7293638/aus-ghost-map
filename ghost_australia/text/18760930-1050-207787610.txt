THE : CHILDREN. 7 ; : 'And now the winter was passing awayahd? the -first day of Lent this year fell on Lilly 'z birth-day. ' Mrs. Schuyler had intended ? to ' rieleb'rate the day by some pleasant festival,; but Lilly utterly refused this, her mind in ; fact' being in a fearful excitement about being :con- firni'ed in the cathedral just after Easter,- (in? direct opposition to her mother's commands— a' step which she knew would make that dear: patient mother entirely wretched,: yet-whichv Father Murphy and the nuns assured- her she must at orice take, after too long delay, v Facto month was dividing farther and farther: asunder this mother and her only chfid; ? 'and ; piitting Lilly stilL more and more - under ; priestly domination. But a Higher Power- had' ordered the events of that birthday. Lilly- came lionie from the service at the Cathedral of ' St;;; Joseph the Just to find her father at the ' point!; of death, stricken by another fit of ; liist.disease.i Before night Judge Schuyler was dead;; Fathers Murphy and Douay had stood over his insensible form as the spirit was departing; administering extreme unction and repeating the ..'J. offices'" aud prayers of the Church for the . dying. When the scene was over, and only' dead clay remained of the husband and parent,- Annette conveyed, the almost distracted Lilly tor her apartment. Mrs. Schuyler being,; as- we' 'have frequently stated, a weak woman, > her. distress overpowered her, and as fainting succeeded fainting, Hannah and the' physician! -watched- anxiously at-her bedside until daybreak, <& Meanwhile, priests and ; nuns, -with -Mrs; Kemp, presided in the chamber of /death; iy'Tlie body of Judge Schuyler was Buitaly laid oiitp a crucifix upon his breast, holy water at his-liead a prayer-book laid open at: his feet, ; wax tapers burning about him ; with a sickly radiance-in the growing light of dawn. 1 ' ' i : Poor Lilly, taken to lier room, ; flung herself sobbing 'on the' floor,' refusing to be comforted; Tlie'invaluable Annette stood over: her,- .'-wring ing her hands and crying, "Oh; miss ; oh, my sweet miss jr. your father is dead; on your birth-day; too ! ;> Oh;? my, -dear miss; why did you - not get confirmed, as, they : bid you ?

Vow1 a gift to. the convent. : Vow -a gift to the altar- at St. j Joseph's. ! ' : Oh, my dear miss, much I! fear, if : you do not, the angels will take, away that blessed lady . : your mother," i whom Sister' Clement, 'alias -Annette, cordially hated. : ? Need. we doubt that Lilly made, in full faith and earnestness, any number of vows ? A little, composed . by these, she desired to .go to her, mother. All her grief and. remorse were- re-: awakened at seeing her . mother's . pale face, swollen eyelids . and . dislie veled li air. ? She flung herself on the bed beside her, clasped her arms about her neck, andcovering her mother's face with kisses, sobbed, out, "Mother, oh,- mother, j it is my fruit, I know it is ; it ;is a judgment on; your wicked Lilly .that ; lias. .brought, so much' trouble to you.- Darling. .mother, .forgive me !"| " Forgive you,. Lilly !" cried. Mrs. Schuyler ; ' my precious child, you are the only comfort I have." " - ; Unhappy mother ! unhappy child ! born to be that mother's bitterest woe !, The judge was buried with all magnificence. He had ; not - openly united -with the True Church, but Father Murphy said he had; done so privately ; at all events, he had given to, that Church's aid, upheld her institutions, placed liis child in her hands, and- plainly . expressed his faith in her unity,: purity and iufallibihty. His body was laid in consecrated ground ; masses were said and suhg for his soul ; he was . blessed and lauded and held up . as an example, and Michael Shinn at that grand funeral reaped heavy profits from being a. son of the True Church and obedient to the' reverend Fathers, j And now we could have wished that, in the privacy of , their grief, left to each other's love for .solace,; Lilly, and .her mother could have grown more closely together, and the child could have fgiven -her; parent /her. entire . confidence. But no ; this the holy Mothers Borne and Ro- bart. could not.permit. . To, the weeping widow could, not be left the comfort of lier child. Lilly was reminded of her vows — was told that she i must go to the convent, and there remain for pro- : per rifligious exercises and instructions until she had taken lier communion and received confir mation at the hands of the Archbishop.-. Now, Mothers ; Borne . and . Robart could not : have . forced Lilly from her -home and mother, against - the will;- of oyery,; one ;. but, cruelest sting of all, . the child was brought to insist upon thus doing, it. was set before her as a religious duty to leave her, only parent :alnne, in agony of - spirit ; and she was persuaded, to demand it as her right and, privilege thus ;to. leave lier mother in her grief — ; herself to go, elsewhere for the. good of her soul,- and to. prepare to disobey that mother's express . commands. Qh. cruel blow upon a .heart already so sorely .wounded ! . To -..the. convent went.

' Thus ended Estelle's tale— all marriage, and: money. , Annette's eyes were fixed, her hands clasped. " ' ' ' "Wake up, Annette," whispered Lucy j "are you asleep?" . : '.'Nearly," said Annette, aptly. But her mind was in a whirl of triumphant scheming. : The day for Lilly's confirmation had come. She was allowed to dress at home , for the occa sion. - Annette, the admirable, was a skilful dressing-maid. Saint Cecelia was in attendance .to sommd Lilly of her duties. The girl was dressed in white silk, and crowned with a wreath of lilies-of-thc-valley of tlie' choicest workmanship— spotless white in all lier attire; flier -golden lhair falling like ' a halo about her face and shoulders. . Poor Lilly ! she was too fair for scenes like these. ' ' : . '.' I must see mamma," said Lilly; breaking away from nun and maid.' ! She found her mother reclining in' a large chain in her 'dressing- room, while Hannah, seated at her feet, "read to her from the Psalms. ,' ' Oh, mamma, do speak to me," said Lilly. Mrs. Schuyler took her .in -her arms ' tears rained on the little devotee's upturned face; "My poor, lost, misguided, deluded child !" sobbed Mrs. Schuyler. . . « - : " .. Lilly, with many more, was kneeling in the grand Cathedral of Saint Joseph the Just. Trembling, she listened to the music, the Bishop's prayer, the monitions given/ and then the Bishop made upon her forehead with chrism the sign of the cross, saying/ I. sign thee with the sign of the cross, and ,1 confirm thee then with the chrism of salvation, in ''the - name of the Father, and of the Son,' and of the Holy Ghost." He then gave her a little blow on the cheek, saying, " Peace be with, you !" This she had been taught was to -put her in mind " that in. confirmation she was. strength ened to suffer with patience, and even. to die- with 'Christ." ' . ' . Lilly had- received the " Holy Eucharist."' She -had been taught, and, fully believed, that under every fragment, of bread and every sip of; wine (which element, however, was strictly for ,priests)was the flesh, blood, soul and divinity of : the Lord J esus, wholly there. " Whole" under each part." "In each morsel, wholly in visible in each form and under each'part of ' the form." She accepted it as, true , that lie, "by the ulmighty power of God, did not leave heaven to come into the host, but was in 'heaven and in" every ouq of the consecrated hosts in , the world' at, the same time." Slieundcrstood that Jesus became " really lier nourishment.", Poor, igno rant, earnest, . illogical,', deceived Lilly ! she ; . could- not perceive tlie monstrous absurdity, of ' five hundred Christs in the' Church at ' once, - feacly for, the mastication; /of !.the faithful.
