-iy-: VICTORIA JOCKEY CLUB RACES. AUTUMN MEETING.— THE FIRST: DAY. ? «?'???' 'Under the most auspicious circumstances, as' regards weather, and on other less acci ' dental accounts, the autumn meeting of the ? 'Victoria Jockey Club was commenced on Thursday ? The programme was a reasonably attractive one, and the events, either in themselves or in the circumstances attending them, were Rr- full r»f in terest, tn£rt we willingly spare our readers the ?t'- usual descriptive infliction without .which a „ newspaper report of a race meeting has come to . be looked upon as incomplete. We must, how ? ? ever, make one slight digression, if only to follow . -' the remarkable example set us by the railway ? 'vLtrain of the Melbourne and Essendon Company. / The adventures of the ' road' were considerably heightened and diversified by one collision, and one prolonged stoppage to prevent *a- repetition of *'?'' the same, together with a series of jumpings on ',; the part of the engine, which, on the whole, was ? v the most capricious locomotive we' have ever had the nervous pleasure of being bumped -along by. Foxtunately, however, the collision ended in no-? thing worse than in bringing the passengers up-/ ' standing on their feet, and inducing the engineer ?and stoker , to precipitate themselves from their posts, lest a worse thing ' night befall them. Nor was the homeward jaunt : a whit less venturous than the outward orje, one ? screeching kept up by the 'whhtle' by way of ' keeping the passengers alive to the .probability of ,'?'?? falling; across at any1 ungiven moment a new edi ? tiori of the forenoon mishap. So very present ??'?'? was this fear that not a man of us (including that ',; interjectional, parturient hom — woman— as 8yd '??'? ney Smith calls her) did not feel grateful for being , landed on the home station whole-bodied. We were agreeably surprised to find that, not 'withstanding the very unfavorable aspect pre sented on the course last week from the large volume of water gathered upon it, the ground ; was in excellent order. In fact, we may venture ', to assert that the late floods have had a beneficial 'effect by leading the sediment on the surface of the sward, thereby protecting the soil from ', any danger of becoming brittle and. parched. .We may mention, however, on the other hand, that, considering the amount of money spent J ' upon drainage, we little anticipated that a btill . further outlay would be required for completing ... the objeet, for which the first estimate— -a toler V ably large one— ought to have been sufficient. But we hove at least reason to expect that the ?worst is now past, and that the recent operations . . for effectually draining the course will render un necessary any more vexatious postponements of racing . events, on account of accidents of the I weather. The attendance upon the course yester '_ day was not numerous. This, we presume, ''.'.' arose in a great measure from the exorbitant ?..?, charges at the gate. We think it a mistaken policy to fix the rates of admittance at bo high a figure, inasmuch as, at a lower figure, the .club I ~t -would derive a larger revenue, through the sheer number of visitors, than it will do at this meeting 1 under the present fiscal arrangements. But a truce to this kind of criticism. We are happy to bestow unqualified praise upon the able manage ment of that popular and indefatigable sportsman, . Mr Richard Goldsbrough, to whom the sporting . -world has from time to time been indebted for the t -very excellent sport provided by the Jockey .' . . . Club ; and in no one instance has he deserved u. the thanks oi the public more heartily than now. Ihs time and trouble he bestowed during the last fortnight in reducing the course to its best avail able condition, have not. been without fruit. We! can also : congratulate' the Club; upon- their judicious, choice, in., again appointing Mr George YP'atson as s'tarferV^a'' post1 .which *he; has 'fr'orri time to time filled with unvarying success. The honorary, officials who rendered good service in keeping the course, also deserve mention. Punctually to the minutei' the bell rang for sad dling for the first race of' the day, ? - - ; : '' .

The speculation upon this event had assumed, during the last few days, a somewhat weathercock char acter. 'The odds, short .indeed, hadplaced three: orit °f the four competitors successively in the position of favorites. On the day priBvious'tothe race, Presto occupied the-i premier .place in the money market, and, justly so, if we ,may judge by; results. : Moscow, -vhose dam (Ulrica, by Laner cost) was stinted in Englarid to Muscovite, one of: the fastest horses of his day,1 must have sorely dis appointed his owner (Mr. John Orr) who enter tained a very sanguine' bpinioii as to winning this great three-year old stake. ' Moscow's style of; going will have greatly to improve. before he can have a ghost of a chance for the 2000 guineas, for to say. the least, his first . appearance yesterday' upon the turf was a most moderate performance. but little quality as a .race horse; in fact, she was thoroughly' 'out-Tiaced from the very commencement,' 'arid we have no1 doubt a portion of so, miserable' a performance was owing to the very indifferent condition in which she was brought 'to the po3t. Joe Carter, looked arid, unquestionably^ felt disgusted with his mount. Donation has so frequently appeared to disadvantage upon various courses, /that, no worse thing need be said of him on this occasion. At the fall of the flag, the lot got away upon capital terms,; Moscow in the van for, the first quarter of a mile. Li rounding therails, into the old straight running, he showed ternper, and ran wide of his horses by a considerable distance, thus leaving -the front position to Presto, who, mauiiainea u to me ena. JJonation came in an indifFererit second, ' with Moscow scarcely within' cooey, while Castanet's whereabouts' could, onjy .-.be; discovered by a powerful glass. Looking upon . this race, as a whole, we must say that an equally indifferent lot of Leger animals might be more easily dreamed of than found; ' The race of the day was' ?

Why this' .should have been thecaije, considering the' very inferior quality of the field he defeated; is ?:??& problem only -to, bk solvedjby the talent. Black Doctor is a fine grown and symmetrical * colt^ . arid will j in,', tiirie, fully justify the confidence of his friends;1 ' Inscannirig over his muscular propellers, a connoisseur would discover a jvant of ppdy; : and fulness, which time and good feeding would, alone furnish. If'we might offer an opinion, upon this' animal's condi tion, we should say he was rather' too' finedrawn. Prattler, by Premier, made his .debut in. thik race, and if we may judge, from the very raeired state in which he caine. to the post,, contrasted with the indbrriitable gam'eriess he showed in the struggle home, it seems certain that he will do honor, to his sire at no distant; period, He is a neat, fashionable, racing- looking horse, and evidently follows the example, set by others of. hit kin, in inheriting the' virtues of his' strain of racing blood. Swiss Boy, thewinner, out of Mr T. Bavin's stable,;. broke the spell for which he had received, so much, severe prepara tion in times past, arid he has. at last succeeded in placing to hiB owner's credit a goodly stake. He' found, it is true, little work fbr.the metallics,. there being scarcely a bet booked for or against' him. His., condition was all that could be, asked, and with the assistance of tne tu-tistic Johny Perkms'i he was with speak difficulty landed the winner. Thereat of the : competitors scarcely deserve mention: The race is easily, de scribed. The lead was jumped off with by Stock man, an outsider, whose' performances have been recently distinguished in coach .harness rather than upon the turf; closely following him came Black Doctor, Presto, and Prattler. In rounding, the turn from the straight funning. Presto chal-. lenge'dthe frbrit'horse, and atone time, looked as if he meant to essay a. second edition of his Leger performance. This order, of things, with trifling alterations, was maintained up to the abattoirs, when Prattler deprived Stockman of his ' po'sitiori, ana lor a snort tune nem tne reins on nis own ac count. Half a mile from home. Swiss Bo.yj who had been lying well forward in ithe ruck,; drew up to hi$ horses, and remained in the foremost divi-'; sion up to the turn leading into the straight run ning. At'this point, :thertug' of war commericed. The set-to by the 'respective riders., was r fine piece of jockeyship, the -like of which is seldom witnessed' in the southern hemisphere. .
