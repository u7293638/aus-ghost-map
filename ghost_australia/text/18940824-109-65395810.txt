THE SN)W. Lo ! what wonders the day hath wrought Born of the soft and slumbrous snow ; Gradually silent, slowly wrought; Even as an artist thought by thought Writee expression on lip and brow. Hanging garlands the leaves o'erbrim, Deep drifts smother the paths below; The elms are shrouded, trunk and limb, And all the air is dizzy and dim With a whirl of dancing, dazzling snow. Dirmly cut of the baied sight Houses and church-hpires stretch away; The trees, all spectral and still and white, Stand up like ghosts in the failing light, And fade and fain with the blinded day. Down from the roofs in gusts are hurled The eddying drifts to the waste below ; And still is the banner of storm unfurled, Till all the drowned and desolate world Lies dumb and white in a trance of snow. Slowly the shadows gather and fall, Still the whispering enuwflikea beat; Night and darkness are over all; lest, pale city, beneath their pail I Sleep, white world, m.thy winding-sheet. Clouds may thicken and storm winds breathe; On my wall is a glimpse of Rome Land of my longing !-and underneath Swings and trembles my olive wreath; Peace and I are at home ! FLORENCE Placr.
