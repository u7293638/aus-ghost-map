So Lay the Shoet, You e&y; you've a ghoat that haunta you, The gboafc of a vaiu fegret, Tha thought of the yoara you have wasted, And would, if you could, forget. Youv heart overflows with Borrow Aa you thiak of the misspent Fast, Opportunities lost for eve? Crowd memory thick and last. Buti all yonr vaia regrottioge Will never lay the ghoat Whioh matca aa, eaoli one, at some time, Ilia most uuwilHiig hoat. For fcho only way to do it la to siao to a batter life, To build up the old waste places. To start on a holy stfife, To conquer your lower nature, To crucify Self, and to live, Houoofortli, to a nobler purpoao, Yens time aud you? strength to give. Oh, live as a man and a Obrfatian, And you ehâ‰ª have peooo at the last, Aad your deathbed shall not be hanated By the ghoat of a misepeut Fast,
