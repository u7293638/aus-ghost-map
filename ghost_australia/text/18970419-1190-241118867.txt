To tho Editor of "Tho Herald." Sir,— In your ibbuo of the 14th inot. your cor- rcipoudent, Mr C. Hutchinson, boldly declares that ho does not believe, a whale swallowed Jonah, because the Bible says, "God prepared a great fteli." ' Well, whales are not generally considered Email fish. Apparently,' Mr If. thinks he knows more about that fl«hy legend than Christ did, but If ho was better acquaint ed with tho book ho quotes from he would ilnd that Christ was evidently under the Impres sion that something very like a whale did the swallowing, when ho said "For as Jonah was thrco days nnd threo nights In tho wlinlu's belly, etc"— Matthew, 12th chap,, 40 v. Thcit, &s; regards tho euq standing still, Mr H. says, "If Ond made the sun, surely ho could mako It stand still." Certainly lie could, and as every one, except thu very Ignorant. Is sutlsOcnl It docs (nnd always did) etand still, unless Mr H. can prove that tho sun was movln- at tbo time td tbo event in question It'a not easy to see where the miracle comes In, There Is a simi lar difficulty respecting the snake being con demned to crawl on its belly over after after committing its little b& of devilment As we don't know how It previously walked, perhaps a tho tip of Its tail, for ancient tails weru (snd aro Mill) very usorul. /Mr 1L accuses the Christian eburchea of having fallen Into error. They have adopted various umcrlptural no tions, and all (except, of course, bla owiiliuio ghost of the true church) are off the right track? Now, It after nineteen hundred years nf gospel' grinding, and so much Icoudabcd Christianity Is reduced to tho mtsvrahlo pro- portions ot the little sect modestly styled "Tbg Church of Christ," ItVralher difficult to dis cern .what divine power bus (lone for tho gou- ANTl FUDGE.
