THE NOVEMBER MAGAZINES. People who pick up what they believe to be great bargains in the way of pictures by the old masters, antique bronzes, rare porcelain, and so forth, will be greatly enlightened by reading Sir Charles Robinson's paper in the Nineteenth Century, in which he explains how spurious works of art are produced and foisted upon the public as genuine. He mentions one case in which the authorities at the Louvre were imposed upon by a portrait-bust purporting to be a Donatello, but which was in reality the production of a young and unknown sculptor living in Florcnce. Mr. H. B. Wheatley gives us some un- published pages of Pepys's Diary, of which, it appears, about one fifth remains unprinted, and will be included in a new edition shortly to be issued. An investigation of the natural history of the Christian hell, by Mr. James Mew, is full of curious information with respect to the genesis of the idea, and its development in the dark corners of the human mind. Some theologians, it seems, have taken a census of the place ; and one authority fixes the number of devils at 44,435,556. Dr. du Moulin, a professor of history at Oxford in 1680, calculated that the number of human beings who had escaped damnation from the time of Adam downwards, was certainly not one in a hundred thousand, and probably not one in a million ; while another divine declares that "hell is paved with skulls of infants not a span long Mr lames Sill I) discussing the reasoning pow er of annuals seems to be m a fog on the subject und leav es the minds of his readers in a fogg) condition also An uiial)Bia of the "Mimes ot Hcrodus, recently dis coveied m the British Museum, goes to prove that although the) are 2,000 ) cara old the) ure us young as )esterda), and that the realism of ono of them is only to be matched in the most modern French literature In the opinion of the writer of the article Herodas is worth a hunched Anstotles I Mrs Boss contributes a shoit paper on Bv ron s residence at Pisa, during vv Inch he seems to have been subjected toa vigilant espiónate by Austrian spies the authorities considering that 'if he were not held to be a madman, he ought to be watched h) the police of the whole world ' It was eventually resolved that Tuscan) Bhould lie rid of that "revolutionär) fellow Discuss mg the Psychical Societ) s ghosts, Mr A J limes airivcs at the conclusion that there is no unpossibiht) in phantasms of the living otof the dead, as 'it is all a question ol evidence Lord Stanle), of Alderley, offers | some practical suggestions, m an article on the Church of Lngland, for improving the stipends of the poorer cleig) by future legis lation, and enumerates upw ardB of timty bendices in Wales, in winch the income of the incumbent only equals, upon an average, that of a stonemason in this colony Mr I Delille writes an amusing paper on the opinions entertained by lrcnch vvuters of themselves and of each other based upon M Tules Hütet s 'Inquiry into the Literary Ivolution ' One thing to be learned from it is that the reign of the "Reclists or "Naturalists, in fiction is drawing to a close, and that all the other schools, how muchsoever they may differ among them selves are united in their hostility to Zolaism. M Renan compares symbolists, naturalists, and psychologists to ' so many nasty little children sitting sucking then thumbs" To the question "Is our Yeomanry (cavalry) 'Worth Preserving'' Major the Earl of Airlie returns an affirmative answer, and points out how it should be organised and drilled so as to make it a valu able auxiliary to the regular army A sketch of life m a Jesuit College m France is fur nished by M Dzieurcki, whose minuteness of detailed description is unaccompanied by any expression of praise or blame as regards the system of instruction and discipline pursued In an article entitled " Darwinism in the Nursery, Dr L Robinson reminds us of what a valuable field for study is opened up by the observation of the actions, move ments and dawning intelligence of typically healthy infants, and that thus we might obtain the material for filling up the gap which at present exists between embryology and anthropology A very young child's strength of grip is traced back to a habit acquired by our forefathers tin arboreal quadrumana, and the attitude voluntarily adopted by SO per cent of infants m then sleep is shown to be that of all the anthropoid apes and of no other animals Mr I Dice) s îeply to tile critics of his article on the new Paihament, reiterates his previous!) expressed convictions that the nixt general election will not place the uonllbi wieckers of the 1 mpire m power nnd adduces some additional reasons for this belief In the Contempoiat!/ Review, Mr JiiBtin M Curth), M P , giv es us his critical estimate of the late leader of the Home Rulepait) m Ireland whom he does not consider to have been at nil times 'responsible lor the vvoids he utteied He speaks of lum as a mun of commanding intellect, lint sa)s he was not nn intellectual man Ile caied nothing about literature or music, and ver) little foi painting oi sculpture He had no feeling for poctiy or for the beaut) of naturi and did not take trio si it litest in terest in the pioblems of life He was enil nentl) practical and possessed gicut foice of character, which was mteinnttent in its manifestations, on account of his liability to nervous prostration One of the most note wot thy in tides in the presentnumbei is lrom the pen of Mme Blaze de Bury It dealt, with the spintunlisation of thought in 1 runts», which has boen going on foi the last 20 years, and is as remarkable in its wii) as the militar) lennsccnce of the nation Hie animating spirit ol the movement is saul to find its highest expies sion in the writings of Paul Desjaidins , m culcating, as the) do, perlect disinterested ness nnd absolute detachment from self Hie bestand most thoughtful minds m 1 ranee weare told, regard this revival of Idealism us a proof that the tide has turned, und that there is a general and unmistakable desire to cast aside all that has been so unworthy in the past Dr Freeman leturns to the contro v t rted question of Greek in the Universities, and argues tlmt it should bo taught philo logically, so as to exhibit its lelntion to all other languages Wiitiniîoii the applications of hypnotism) or mtsmpnsm, Di G I tuckey îelatcs some of his own experiences m connection w ith it and explains how, by means ot suggestion while patients weie ma mesmeriu condition, he has cured peoploof diunkeniipss, of excessive indulgence m smoking and of ti craving loi morphia, chloral and other nnrcotics, while, at the same time, he contends, hypnotism does not impair the physical powers nor weaken the moral sense of the patient "In the hands of a conscientious and experienced phvsieian Dr luckoy behivcs the ubt of hypnotism to be " absolutely devoid of dancer and Dr Liebcuult of Niinoy who bus practised it foi ovei JO years among the pool of that city, states that be has never seen any serious accident result fiom the employment of it Mi I \ Organ Bets foitli the giicvnnccs of Behool tendiera m theinothercounti) and suggests a scheine for their nundy Investigating the causes of the glacial epoch Professor I G Uonney examines the teolo^ical changes b) winch it was piee(del and arrives at the conclusion that the) w ere inadequate to pro duce such an accumulation of ice and snow as char ictcriBpJ that period Hence oui) two explanations ot the phenomena nrpuir to he available namely nn alteration in the eui th s axis of lotution or changes tu the form ol its orbit and of its position ni legare!

The Johannine authorship of the Fourth Gospel continues to be a favourite subject of controversy among theological disputants, and the Rev W W Peyton contributes his quota to it by submitting his reasons for the belief that John inspired it, and therefore for all practical purposes is the author of it The three notes of these "Memorabilia of Jesus he defines to be idealism, mysticism, and symbolism, which give to the composition the character of a work of art while their form is that of a drama, the action of which moves by dialogue, and all those who play a part in the tragedy are
