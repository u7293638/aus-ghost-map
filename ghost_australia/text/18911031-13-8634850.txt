THE NATIONAL ART GALLERY OF NEW SOUTH WALES. BY TOM ROBERTS. Spring in Sydney, clear sky and hot sun, a park with soft springy grass, a long line—an avenue—of Moreton Bay figs, clumps of firs and bunya-bunyas, whose shade is cool with the soft ocean air. A glimpse of sea of a colour that cannot be told, the bills be- bond glowing ruddily in the brilliant light ; and just opposite is a wall of brick, blank but for two doors through which we enter, the treasure-house of works of art, images carved and graven and moulded in marble, ivory, and bronze, and canvases and panels on which are represented and brought visibly before us scenes of a hundred different characters and times and countries. '1 he first oblong hall is a kind of vestibule, from each side of which stretch three laiger and smaller gallones This central room, the tempoiarj state ot which is marked b« the curious wool show 100m lighting, is hung w ith pictures, and between the spaces art busts mil statues, in marble undbrou/e, some anginal,others lephcas and copies '1 wo central columns have giouped round and upon them
