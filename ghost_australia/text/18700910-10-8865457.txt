I POLITICAL PHOTOGRAPHY. I TO THE EDITOR OF THE MERCURY. Sir, Upon two important subjects occupying public attention, I venture to submit a point of view altogether clear from the mist surrounding the mental vision of your correspondent "Ruth," as well as many other writers and speakers. 1st, In justification of the Government introducing into the colony a number of immigrants a " return" has only to be laid before Parliament showing the number of Tasmanians who have left the colony during the last 12 months to earn bread in a strange land. 2nd. In justification of the statement the Attorney-General is reported to have made in Parliament, " he could not discover the truth of the assertion that the colony was in a state of decadence," let a return be moved for to show the extent of business involving summonses, distress warrants, and endless legal proceedings, compared with the present ghost-like appearance of commercial enterprise.
