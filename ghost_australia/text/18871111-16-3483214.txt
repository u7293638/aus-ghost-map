The custom had to be proved, and the Judge was of opinion that he and not proved it Mr KiTts Look at the evidence Sir S W Goman said that would be sitting in review of the action of the Supreme Court If the committee found that the action of the Supreme Court was wrong, what right had they to go my further, and if they found it was right, what good would it do ? It was not a question w whether there we us any custom such as he had stated, but simply that he had failed to prove his case Sir S W Griffith then quoted a case which had come before the House of Commons to show that the House had no power to interfere with the petition the Supreme Court, except in certain cases where they could deal with the Judge himself Mr RuiiiDtiL, thought that the idea of making the House a Court of Appeal from the Supreme Court was embodied in the terms of the motion, which were very unfortunate He did not think it possible to inquire into the alleged miscarriage of justice unless the committee were to go into the whole question If it implied that there was any misconduct on the part of the Judge or jury it would be the hon members duty) to proceed in the ordinary way and have that inquired into but he did not see there was an) round for saying that there had been a miscarriage of justice He did not think it was possible for the committee to find out whether Mr Ransome had suffered an injury 01 not unless the) iii tended to summon the witnesses who were examined at the trial and also the Judge to give evidence An attempt to summon the Judge would be a totally abortive one A committee of the House of Commons summoned Lord Chief Justice Hope before it to answer for something that he had done, and the Judge refused point blank to give my reasons for what he had done Mr Morliilad What about the committee on Judge Cooper Mr RurrtDQi. pointed out that that was simply) to deal lth Judge Cooper's expenses, and the Judge would not have acted judicially) in giving any of formation upon that subject If the motion was carried the House would be placed in the ridiculous position of asking the committee to do what it could not possibly do no had no doubt as in the case of Lord Chief Justice Hope, the whole thing would end in smoke Mr Barr said that although he was pre pared to support this motion when it was pro viously before the House, he did not see the fun of having it brought forward time after time. He saw nothe is to alter the opinion which the House had expressed on the previous occasion, and he thought the hon number ought to rest content with that opinion Mr Morgan thought that an in justice had been done to Mr Ransome It was the universal custom to buy cedar timber as in in thickness whether it was under it or not, and the custom was even followed by Government officials That was what the Toow oomba party gave its decision upon, and the Judge ought not to have upset the verdict of that jury, without having heard the evidence on which the verdict was based Mt Roome was ruined by the result of the decision of the court, and the House ought to grant a committee to inquire into the circumstances Mr AVitiii. sympathised with the consignee, and said the discussion would have a good result if it made Brydon, Jones, and Co since for their share in the transaction Mr Bulcock said that Mr Bryden was in England and Mr Jones was ill in bed when the transaction was effected by persons in their employment Mr To houses said the custom of the trade was that planks must be of standard measure ment inch timber must be fully an inch thick In this case there was no injustice, but only a difference of opinion Mr TitASER defended Brydon, Jones, and Co from the reflections cast upon them by Mr White Mr Evatt is, in reply, said he did not regret having brought the matter forward again, supported as he was by the petition of SOO poisons, and all he wanted was to have the law altered Next session he hoped to bring the matter forward again (2 Oh," and ironical laughter ) The motion was then withdrawn REDISTRIBUTION BILL A message was received from the Legislative Council, intimating that it had agreed to the Redistribution Bill with amendments, which, on the motion of Sir S W Gain an, were ordered to be taken into consideration next day MR HUTTON'S STONEWALLING Mr Morehead asked the Chief Secretary, in the absence of Mr Jordan when the papers referring to the late Premier, Sir Trios M Ilwraith, and the late Minister for Lands, Mr Perkins, would be laid on the table Sir S W GKirnTii I believe they will be ready by Tuesday There me a good many to be copied Mr Morehead Are the missing papers found Sir S W Griffith I don't know , but I have seen enough to lay on the table URANGAN RAILWAY The debate on the second reading of the Maryborough and Urangan Railway Bill was resumed by Mr W Brookes, who opposed the bill at some length on the ground that the syndicate was practically the same as that which proposed to construct a transcontinental railway for the colony on the land grant principle On that account he distrusted the whole affair the colony had been delivered from one morass, and he did not want to see it drifting into another If he had his way he would have nothing to do with this railway Mr 4nxear urged that the stringent conditions contained in the bill and the large deposit exacted from the company should be sufficient recommendation to the House If the Government could not construct the late the company should be allowed to do it Mr Macrossan said that if All Annear. had been defending the proposals of the Tianscouti nental Railway syndicate, he would have used the same arguments as he now did Renient - being the bitter arguments used against the TranseontinentalRailway scheme by supporters of the present Government, he (Mr Macrossan) would rather have looked upon the bill before the House in the same light as Mr Brookes did This was the second time the motion had come before the House. The first time it came with a great flourish of trumpets, sounding the benefits which the B) Indicate were going to do not only to the Maryborough of feet, but to the whole colony not by the development of the coalfield, but by treatment of a tractor) ores He then supported the motion, but he had now come to look upon the thing as a mere speculation of individuals to extort the resources of the country, by getting certain party lieges which would be sold afterwards to other people at an enormous profit Three years had elapsed since the original bill had been passed, and in that time the railway was to be built Yet not one inch of the line had been made yet The syndicate had been going about looking for people to build the line, until they had persuaded another syndicate in London to do it He was surprised at the Premier giving himself away to the project The Premier could take the mantle of prophecy because he had predicted what was now actually taking place with regard to this syndicate t alway Air Macrossan then quoted from the speech made by) Sir S W Griffith on the Warrego Railway Bill in 1882 in which he had said that these railway companies are always wantingsometlnng-(laughtei)-ondinstanoing a case of a railway that had to be completed in two years Sub- AV Griffith had gone on to state that pressure in that case would be brought to bear, undwhotwas known in the United States as "lobbying" would be introduced and acclimatised here (Laughter ) Instead of the "lobbying" having taken place in their lobby, it had taken place in St Stephen's Club, London and the hon gentleman was there lobbied himself (Laughter and Sir S W Griffith I was a good prophet ") Yes, and in future they would have to call him the prophet Samuel " He did not object to the old 8) indicate mdiv iduall), but the now syndic i it would send out some small man to effect the bargain He objected to our resources being given away to meet ad venturers (hear, sources such men had proved themselves to be so far It would be better for the House and the country for the people of the Maryborough district to wait a little longer until the Government would be able to make the railways) and develop the resources of the district themselves In that case they would be developed more in the interests of the people than if the line was built by a company) (Hear, hear.) Mr. VnNDsaid he agreed with what All Macrossan had said, but objected to a measure of a contentious nature being discussed in the present circumstances of Parliament How 01 ei, it was time that of should be a finality to concessions granted by the Government An agreement with the Government should be treated in the s into light as any other binding transaction Mr Dutton said it would be hard indeed for all people to be tied down to this time of contact with the Government. The matter was first introduced at the instigation of Mr Rawlins, who went into the undertaking and the sum of £2000 was deposited as a guarantee for the construction of the line For some reason, other gentlemen who were to join Mr Rawlins did not do so, and he was left alone to carry out the contract with the object of getting someone to take the matter up he went to England, where he met with the ghost of that monster the Duke of At inchoate, whom they had been so afraid of He was surprised to hear the speech made by Mr. Macrossan, who had originally supported the syndicate The main object of the mile it was to develop the coalfields of the Bar rum The Government gained no land, but the company were to pay 30s per acre for an area to be worked, which was a hard) high live If the line was not car and out the Government wouldbenefitto the extent of £5000 lot nothing, and there was no probability of the Government going on with the line during the next eighteen months. He could see no objection to the motion, unless it was on the principle that all lines should be oonah acted by the State He would be glad to see the bill become law, as its object was to develop the resources of the Burrum district without i out to the State Mr His land he v law in the matter in the some light as the Tiiinseoiitinontiil R ulna) proposal to, and that it was in attempt to obtain concessions from the Government to be disposed of after aids to other individuals Mr M AT is i In Build the original syndicate had note lined out the line, owing to reasons over which they had no control, and he thought they were going in a little) good direction in absenting to the motion It was desirable to encourage these private people when the Government were not prepared to step in and con struck the railway Mr Dickson said that owns strongly river e to land grant tells us, but he would support the present hue for the reason that a coin casion had cloudy been granted and the Government had received a deposit, and it would be acting in an union heart to refuse to give united tional year, as asked for in the bill If the proposal was a new one, the name- otthosvn dilute would be sufficient to warn them agu nat granting this concession, but as they had allowed) Diauted one concession, the country would suffer no injury from the additional concession asked for Mr Chinn said that he would support the second leading of this bill, as the House had already granted a concession, and it was not unreasonable to grant the further concession asked for He pointed out there was no provision in the bill for the Government taking over the line if it was left unfinished by the company) The 81st section of the principal Act would have to be repealed, as it did not agree with the 4th section of this bill Mr Nohtov stated that he intended to oppose the second loading of this bill, is he thought if the syndicate intended to do the work they could do it very well in three years. The land they were about to acquire it had been stated, would be not very much below its value Mr Mellor said that the land the syndicate was about to acquire had been upon many years for selection at a low price the land was no good at all except for coal mining The proper development of the Bunnin coalfields depended upon this line being constructed, and if it was not made by this syndicate the Government would be unable to make it for a considerable time. The House divided on the second reading of the bill Ails, 29-Sir S W Griffith andAIeasis Tordun, Rutledge, Dutton, Moleton, Shcndan, Dickson, Kellett, Poore, Mellor, Iaambeit, Back, Jessop, Scott, Foxton, Buckland, Palmer, Wakefield, Kates, M'Mastei, Nelson, Hamilton, Chubb Ferguson, Annear, Lalor, S A's Brooks, Morgan, and Macfarlane Nors, 11 -Messrs Morehead, Norton, Macrossan, W Brookes, Hill, White, Bulcock, Grimes, Campbell, Aland, and Fraser The bill was then read a second time The time allowed for the discussion of private members' business now expired SUPPLY On the motion of Sir S W GnirriTit, the House went into committee to further consider the estimates of expenditure for the year 1887 8 On item- '£4300, salaries, Secretary Public Instruction," Mr Moreton stated that the vote had not been increased In reply to Mr Norton, he said that, although tenders had been called for the election of new Normal School build longs, none had been accepted, because it was not now contemplated that the present schools would be interfered with by the extension of the railway line into the city. Mr. Noptov drew attention to the danger to children attending the Normal School from the blasting operations, as carried out by the railway contractors He instanced the case reported in the Press of a boy having been neatly killed by a stone thrown up from a blast, and urged that more precautions should be taken Mr Macrossan said that it would be difficult to carry on excavations without blasting, and the contractors had a difficulty in conti oiling the men who had the use of the powder or dynamite Means could be found to protect the public aganist the shower of stones that by a blast However, perhaps the contract did not provide for the expense of those means Mr Ditton thought that a screen of wire netting would effect the purpose, and promised to see into the matter Mr Citumisaid that the matter was a serious one, and he hoped something would be done His own son, who had been in the company of the boy referred to by Mr Norton, had told him that they were fully 100 yards from the blast when it occurred Stones were sometimes thrown as far as the houses on Wickham-terrace The corporation should regulate the time of blasting to convenient periods in the day A short discussion and was to the rent paid for the building used f j the Education office owned by Mr. Wal field Messrs Norton and Black thought the rent, £400 per annum, excessive Mr Moreton explained that the rent had been £300 until the accommodation was increased by an additional story Sir S W GRIFFITH added that the building had been first taken by Sir Arthur P rumor at the time when he was Colonial Secretary Pro vision, he thought, had been made for the Education Department in the now public offices Messrs Pujft.ii and Nil on drew attention to the way the education vote was exceeded each year, asking if the practice was to be continued during the present ) i if Mr Moi mov replied that the elasticity of the Education Act rendered an absolute free list of expenditure impossible Applications were continually being made for the promo tion of provisional schools, and the establishment of new schools Croydon, for instance, was now asking for a school and the Goverment were taking steps in the matter The item was agreed to On item " Inspection, soon " Mr Mom Fox explained that there was an increase in regard to the selling allow cases of C100 Mr Groom pointed out that the travelling allowance of £1 per day to the inspectors was quite assortment, ii s they had to pay coach steamer, and railway Iiucb In the Central district for instance, the inspector had for quently to have a horse and buggy in a very high pi no, and very of tin the inspectors had to pay their expenses out of their salaries He did not see why the railways) should not be at their disposal Mr Moi MON' said he was under the impression that the inspectors travelled live upon the railway's and steam in the case of extraordinary expenses, now over, the inspectors generally sent in claims, which were considered and p m The other matter should now receive consideration Mr MontitLVD assumed that those claims were paid out of the contingency vote, and took occasion to make some strictures upon amounts being paid for which there was no play sion upon the Estnniti s He did not see why the ordinary impetus should not be placed upon the same feeling as the liquor m persons, who had then expenses mud The Education Department we us on that he also is a looked upon with Mispmoii Aim after year the vote was increasing, and ultimately), he thought, it would have to be made a charge upon those who derived the benefit from it The money seemed to be all spent in the last of conti is of p mutation, whilst the taxation necessary to support the system spread over the whole of the inhabitants He hoped the system of school boards, as in England, would be established here, by) which those who denied the benefit horn education would be the ours who paid for it The amount now paid for education was more than li per head upon the whole adult population of the colony) Mr Whitney said that she 000 of the amount was too explaining s which could not be regarded altogether as an uhiiutionalo\pcndi late Mr AVimit thought that as attendance was not compulsory, the pi ii ss all the (children who did attend was intended He pointed out that the school board b)skm in 1 England was very expensive even upon those who had no child to send to school Mr Nmsov said that the question was not so much as to the amount spent, but whether that amount was fairly) common amongst the i ordinaries), and w Either the benefits supposed to be derived who laid) divided He did not think that education with a remission) million of the State, as the State was no more bones (to advance children than it was steadied clothe them.

The compulsory clauses should be enforced, and if the parents had to pay a small sum for the education of their children, and if they did so, they would value the privilege much more highly Mr Norton said that the enforcement of the compulsory clauses of the Education Act was open to many objections no did not see what use read for the Bible in State schools could be unless religious instruction accom priced wethers, hear-and if religious instruction were given by along) man it should be given within the school bombs, or no control would be obtained on the children on He en denied the desirableness of imparting technical education to the children of parents who could not afford to send them to the high schools, and spoke in complimentary terms of the 0111 rendering class for and in connection with the Brisbane School of Arts He suggested that more should be done in the same direction among country schools of arts Mr IsAiMLi i complained that their system of education did not contain the elements of progress Tenohois complained of the different 8) stems which inspectors employ) ed in arriving at the value of results, and he suggested that a training class should be established for pupil teachers They would then be able to provide their ou n teachers, to whom technical education could be imparted A uniform character of military drill should also be insisted on throughout all the schools in the colony Mr Cituiiii said he believed in imparting the three R b to children lee-shore, hear-and if he was in the position of the Colonial Secretary he would certainly endeavour to give effect moderately to the compulsory clauses of the Education Act It would be far better to have children at school than brought up at the Police Court as neglected children and then sent to the befor mately There vi ere many difficulties in the way of imparting religious instruction If the horns were increased children would be robbed of their play), and it would affect those living at a distance, while the various denominations would be apt to give rise to confusion He believed that in the higher schools the Gi mi- himself boys ph) bacilli) able should be room polled to learn military duty Mr S W Brooks agreed that it was not the duty of the State to educate the children any more than to clothe or tend them Then present system had killed any chance of efficient pi iv to schools, but as they had it they would line tomato the best of it.
