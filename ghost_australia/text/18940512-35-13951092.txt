GHOSTS AND GHOST SEERS. Exhaustive treatment of modern spiritualism would require both a personal examination into its processes and a study of its teeming literature as comprehensive and complete as Moore gave to the preparation for "Lalla Rookh," when he retired to Sloportou Cottage to read himself into Orientalism In his case, concentration on the point in view resulted in a work redolent throughout, not, perhaps, of the real East, but certainly of the received conception of the East, in outs, would probably end in the seeing of ghosts for ourselves Without going so deeply into the matter, it will be admitted that spiritualism, or, to use the more elastic term, occultism, may have its disouvsiblo aspects for the outsider as well us for the adopt, and the first that arrests attention is the fact pure and simple of its existence That in an age eminently prosaic and priding itself on having cast off superstition like a worn-out glove, an age when our very children are learning to disbelieve in Santa Claus, and primed to tell that the mystic brown rings on the gross are curious and not fairy, there should still be such a hankering after the ultramontane, such an career swallowing of the marvellous, shows how easily practicality and speculation, scepticism and credulity, may spring up and flourish side by side Crodnhty ' Is the nap too rashly fitted The belief, common to all nations, in an environment of supernatural agencies would almost indicate " the fragments of an earlier world of cognizance , nor has it been a merely barren fancy, for to folklore we owe the delicate, imagery of "A Mid- summer Night's Dream," the spiriting of " bonny Kilmeny " to fairyland, and a thousand exquisite fantasies besides But genie, after, pen, green clover, gnome, trolld, shelled, off, brownie, pixie, kelpie, and their congeners, have long been frighted " from their hallowed haunts," and we have neither talisman nor spoil wherewith to woo them broke Acram we pause Have they indeed vanished beyond ken, or are they but reappearing in another shape, and is the present epidemic of occultism little more than an adaptation to advanced knowledge and scientific progress P If so, there are great and marked differences between the two systems The believer in the olden was content to stand aloof and w under the Jin de scene occultist holds receptions for the spirits he delights to cultivate, and invests them with the attributes, not of another order of created beings, but of fellow mortals passed before him into the unknown , summons to his present to the most illustrious of shades, or less ambitious and demanding only the society of his own departed friends, assumes that The beloved the true-hearted came to visiting once more, licenses a professional, a go-between him and these impalpable admirers, and organises a society to search into the why and the wherefore of it all To that other system also substantial benefits belonged A treasure was conferred on poverty-stricken virtue, a witching voice or peerless beauty on the modest maid, and the handsome young prince that was promised carne ridinar duly by No like gifts or graces go begging now, but the pursuit of communion with souls remove on to a higher plane undoubtedly seems a great stride from ancient earldom, though surely its adjuncts and the means employed to compass scarce equal the dignity of the subject The spectral appearance the rappings, spelled out as a child would be taught to read the solemn importance attached to a table as an instrument in the function, are not calculated to commend it to a sober judgment And win a table more than any other piece of furniture The ghost that appeared to Lady Betty Cobb " demonstrated " on a bedstead From a genera- tion audibly panting-if five interpret its tones aright-for a under For elation, we naturally look for something more exalted than the appliances and side shows of the scenes What, too, becomes of the rest, the blissful repose we have fondly trusted m as following after death, if spirits are at the beck and call of curiosity and caprice, and can be so lightly bidden back to their former habitat What are we to think when we find that their testimony is not invariably reliable, and that they have spoken of a person is dead who is as known to be alive, and announced the speedy advent of a fortune that never came to land? Can the tension of nerve, inseparable from the expectation of ghostly visitants, conduce to the sound mind in the sound body so indispensable for the everyday work of life To what plain or profitable purpose have the abnormal powers | ascribed to the leaders of the mission been hitherto directed t Invitations, elonga- tions, spectral phenomena, magnetism, by notism, psychometry, thoiight-roadiug, palmistry, astrals, clairvoyance are but various (and sometimes closely allied) developments of the many phases movement, and their combination might well be imagined to portend some amazing change in the " affairs of men," were we to forgot that not a few of them have been familiar in the past "It Andrew Lang's thoughtful and candid paper, "CompaiativePayohnal Research," sufficiently shows that rappings and invitations have taken the field before, the wonders such as dazed Alcipluon-wrought by Egyptian priests, the feats of Simon Magus and (to this hour of Indian jugglers, are matters of history and am mon evidence Michael Scott may possibly have been an accomplished mesmerist Him listed like magic wand to wave The bells would ring in Notre Dame, Palmistry has been the immemorial prerogative of the gipsy, the astral is own cousin to the Scotch wraith and the German doppelganger, as is clairvoyance to the second sight, said to be possessed in a peculiar degree by the seers of the Scottish Highlands, and of which so many examples have been recorded It must be borne in mind, however, that with some of the foregoing the interests or science are intimately interwoven , that-to quote the recent words of a Sydney preachers bald materialism makes a " bed too narrow for a man to stretch himself upon, that there is, as Soft says, " a vulgar more duty as well as a vulgar credulity," and it is often difficult to draw the line betwixt them Some ghosts have been resolved, we know, like Barlow's, into " an undigested bit of beef, a blot of mustard, a crumb of cheese, a fragment of an underdone potato " Or traceable to other causes The ruins of Glastonbury Abbey had been long declared to be haunted by the spectre of a headless man, which scared the gaping rustic from the spot, when a subsequent displace- ment of masonry actually revealed a skull built into the TÜ Here the inferen(i7T7~" Tradition of the true circumstances was it took shape and walked But the stars fell score resembling it, cannot be classed miles stock episode of " Jeffrey's " rancour.
