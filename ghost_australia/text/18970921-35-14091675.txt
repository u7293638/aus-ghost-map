FEDERATION. at? THE CONVENTION. THIS DEADLOCK DIFFICULTY. FURTHER PROPOSALS FOR SOLUTION. INTERESTING DEBATE. AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED. VOTING OF THE DELEGATES. TmBTESKTO DAY, Seit_!_hb_ 20. The President took the chair at half-past 12 o'clock The PRESIDENT announced that he had received a letter from the Acting Premier of Queensland, in precisely. the same terms as the telegram already dealt with. The letter was received PROVISIONS FOR DEADLOCKS The Convention then resolved itself into Committee of the Whole to further consider the Commonwealth, Bill in detail The CHAIRMAN said the question before the committee was the proposed new clause o7A, " Pro visions for Deadlocks " In that clause Mr Lyne had moved to insert certain words, and on that amendment Sir George Turner had moved to strike out the word " if " The question before the committee was that the word " if " which was proposed to be struck out stand part of the proposed amendment Mr BARTON said he would suggest that the power given by the Convention on Friday should be taken advantage of and that the whole ground should be cleared by rescinding the proposals earned in the clause Everything would then be open for discussion Mr REID said he did not at all object to the power in the Governor General in Connell to dissolve both or either of the Houses are strongly objected to the successive dissolution He believed it would be wise to adopt Mr Barton's suggestion Mr M MILLAN said he had a great objection to simultaneous dissolution of the two Houses, as it would ignore all knowledge of the facts and conditions of the case It might be inconvenient at certain times to have a simultaneous dissolution One House might just have come back from the country, and it might not be necessary to send that house back again He would like to see some concrete scheme by which there should be an alternative given to the I recieve to dissolve either the Senate or the House of Representatives according to the position of the case Mr HIGGINS (Vic) The result would be that they would always dissolve the Senate Mr M'MILLAN said they might regulate the mode under which this plan should be adopted He had certainly an objection to a simultaneous dissolution Sir JOHN FORREST. Oh, you are against el anything Mr McMILLAN said he had a strong desire to maintain the bicameral system of government He thought it would have been better had equal representation been discussed in conjunction with the scheme for the prevention of deadlocks A great deal of the trouble had arisen out of the modus operandi of the resolution adopted by Mr Symon, by which, under all circumstances, the House of Representatives must have a penal dissolution Members said, " Why should one House be penalised against the other r It seemed to him that by penalising the House of Representatives they cast a slur 011 it, and gave to the Senate the superior position A deadlock in itself was not necessarily 1 disadvantage, but a permanent deadlock would be a calamity They must either have a safety valve to the constitution, or else as an alternative 1 revolution in the country in nine cases out of ten deadlocks arose bec raise the second Chamber said to the first one We don't believe you represent the opinions of the people ' That occurred probably in the third year, or when the House of Representatives was practically moribund It would be an absurdity, with a House within three or four months of its natural expiry, to send both that House and the other House to the country He did not believe in the cry of those people who in order to coerce the Convention into reversing its previous decision, said that if that decision were not altered federation was dead (Hear, hear) He trusted the r deliberations would not be swayed by the statement of political wire-pullers and agitators who did not represent the feelings of the country He believed the couple had instructed them to make a constitution not based merely upon every wave and wind of opinion, but one based on their own constitutions and in such a manner that it would stand the shock of time. He would be willing to support a scheme by which, supposing the House of Representatives had been not more than two years in existence, the Senate should be the first to go to the country Sir GEORGE TURNER I am willing to accept a scheme that if the House of Representatives has been 1. months in existence when the trouble arises both Houses should be dissolved simultaneously Mr M'MILLAN said he was opposed to both Houses going to the country at the same name, because they could not, under that arrangement get at the true opinion of the people Iherowasuo finality with the dual referendum, and there was no finality without destroying federation (Hear, hear.) He had spoken warmly because he felt they should be very careful before doing anything that would affect the dignity and revisers character of the Senate, and render is absolutely ineffectual A VICTORIAN VIEW Mr DEAKIN (Vic ) said that the attention of the members was too much concentrated upon dispute] and difficulties which even the most pessimistic of them did not expect to arise very frequently The constant contemplation of such imaginative picture! was not likely to inspire that normal view of the situation k Inch must never be lost sight of The bl camera system was created to provoke differences of opinion so as to ensure the full discussion of every question, and he could see no time at which that system could safely be departed from these grave and special difficulties would be rare and might fairly be met by exceptional means He failed to grasp the argument that the simultaneous dissolution of the two Houses would be antagonistic to the bi-cameral system There might he admitted, be occasions on which the double dissolution would be too great an enigma to employ, but he totally differed from the view that under no circumstances was the double dissolution defensible Where a question of State rights arose and both Chambers claimed to represent the opinion of the majority of the people, what argument could there be against sending both Chambers to the constituencies ? But he thought that questions of State rights would seldom arise and that the real question at issue would be the policy of one section of the community against the policy of the other It appeared to him that dead looks were less likely to occur in the constitution than under any federal constitution which the world had ever seen and that the struggle would never be the smaller States against the larger , but the ordinary constitutional struggle which obtained at present in every Chamber in Australia Surely, if li was sufficient in ordinary circumstances to bear half the Senate and the whole of the House of Represen- latives to the country over three years, Special emergencies could be met by sending the whole of both Chambers to the country at the same time the simultaneous dissolution-not the Symon, various dissolution-(laughter)-was not likely to be adopted by the House of Representatives except under extreme pressure The word " penalisation " could not be cut 1 to apply when both parties were sent to their constituencies at the same time. The existence of such a power as a simultaneous dissolu- tion would be a greater incentive to moderation on the part of either House than a single dissolution could possibly be The proposal made by Mr Symon marked a great concession on the part of some of the delegates, but he did not think the public mind was prepared to stop at it While admitting that absolute finality was not possible 1 dual referendum, which some desired to add to the double dissolution, would give a clear decision and would prove a valuable instrument in instructing politicians A dissolution of the Senate was some thing which delegates did not understand, and which they would not accept without a wry face As for a referendum they would not have it at any price it their local politics Some members of the Conven- bon, however, were willing to make sacrifices for the sake of federation, and he hoped that (some reasonable means of preventing deadlocks would be arrived at 2 THE DAUGHTER OF THE HORSE LEECH ' Mr SYMON said that such a means as Mr Deakin required of preventing deadlocks was embodied 111 his amendment passed the other day ( Oh, oh," and laughter ) There had been mag- unanimity on both sides on the part of the represen- natives of the larger States as well as on the part of those representing the smaller States He thanked Mr M Millan for his courageous speech of that morning If the Senate had had some control over money matters had had some control over the Exocuhio and forms control over appointments and administrations thor would have been a good deal of force 111 Mr M'Millan's arguments But the question now was, Were they to hand over the Senate bodily to the greater powers? He considered that the Mueller States had already made great concessions. Lion if they gave in non it would only pave the way for fresh demands Was the Premier of Victoria, or was the Premier New South Wales, prepared to accept a concurrent dissolution as final ' or would he in addition, demand a dual referendum It would never do to send both Houses to the country at the same time, because the senator would be angry at the thought that they were being put to needless expense and trouble owing to the overbearing conduct of the House of Kopreeen Mr i It? N WITH The Senate cannot be over bcanng-nlwa}s the House of Representatives Mr SYMON said he thought it would be possible for the Senate to be overbearing, because he did not suppose the senators would be more angelic than the members of the House of representatives It was no argument, as urged by Mr. Deakin, that there would be little or no probability of the simultaneous dissolution being used. than was rather an argument that it should not be in City «uinhtuUon, treasure the most drastic the peiuvltiM exposed in the constitution the more IiUIn won. thor to (jot n Inst mg and prudent governing maintain Mn did not agree, with Mr Deakin sent the double uitwrtutlou would be less likely to lw usiM it was in Austria front of or hold over the Smntc Mr DEAKIN And the other Clmintoi also Mr SYMON No, because the Allied Cliniiibor would be liable under fire iireutmtaiiMn to taunt to the country in order to hand it to harmony with the people. It would be a blot upon the constitution to insert it in the hill Mrs. KEIU ADM lib "THE POSITION IS CRITICAL Mr REID said he was pleased to listen to the speech of the lion inventor, because he seemed prepared to Vow to a more liberal solution of the matter so far as he ("Mr Hold) was concerned he had made it obvious that the only point on which he became obstinate was when he believed the Convention was getting on a track that would lead to disaster. He was prepared to the list the Federation in the largest sense, but he could not go beyond what he believed were the true limits of moderation, or beyond the limits which would be supported by the people of New South Wales The representatives of the smaller States who had show ii i be wrong determination to safeguard their poor crs in the constitution should not be surprised at the representatives of the larger States desiring that the balance of the constitution was fair so far as they were concerned The discrepancies between them were so serious that they must hit on some golden menu (Hear, hear ) the representative of the smaller States said they could not discover any, solution which, would be satisfactory if they were exposed to the danger of being on incomes theuuiuencil majority in the larger States , but it the large States took up a similar position and said they would not be satisfied with a. constitution which did not safeguard the lights of the majority of people in the Common- wealth to rule, they would be us much censurable as the smaller States for taking up such a position If the smaller States had their w as in this constitution, no matter how overwhelming the national vote, it would be in the powerful small minority to set aside for over the voice of that Miss majority Suppose a mass vote, representing over two millions, affirming one principle, a majority representing only 600,000 could not only block that must vote for over, but produce such a state of de idlock that the voice of the vast majority would have to be set aside That sort of federation New South Wales would not accept (Hear, hear.) It was infinitely better that criticism of this kind should be heard in the Convention before the work was done than afterwards, when the work had been done the present solution adopted by the Convention which provided that when the repre featurettes of the people as a Commonwealth wished to pass certain legislation which was not agreeable to the gentlemen who would compose the Senate (under a widely different franchise) then the first thing to follow should be a dissolution was 110 solution of the difficulty Mr DOUGLAS (las) Where is the difference in the franchise Mr REID said the difference was the sort of arrangement in the constitution under which the gentlemen representing 150,000 people would have as much power in dealing with the money and legislation of the Commonwealth as those gentlemen who represented 1,¿00,000 souls Such a provision would not recommend itself to the common sense of this country " JOHN DRIVER MUST CONTROL THE BRAKE" It was like during the State coach when a passenger insult had power to apply the brake We had been given an apparently democratic Chamber on the broadest possible lacrosse grand State coach with "democracy ' minted all over it but the givers were determined that the man on the box and the man at the brake should both be safe Conservatives. He (Mr Reid) was not prepared to accept the sort of democracy, where the brake was so strong that it could always stop the State coach without enabling those who were responsible for its progress to adjust it so that the carriage could ad vance the Convention had determined that some provision for de- idlocks must be made THERE MUST BE SOME FINALITY When they saw the ferocity or, rather, when they saw with cairn cold, dispassionate men as Mr I Fraser and Mr by monstrous laughter) lighting so desperately hard ng must any, concession to what was called the will of the um j ont j, the people of New South Wales were determined that the opposite view should be equally safeguarded there must be a proposal which provided that however, wrong the people, or the Senate or the House of Representatives might be, there should be some finality The fatal detect of the propositions of Sir George Turner and Mr Symon was that there was no finality about them. The only proposition about which there was any finality was that of Mr Lyne Mr Symon had made a remark in which he referred to the dissolution of the House of Representatives in order to bring it into conformity with the will of the people, Out that expression only threw a vivid light on the position they would be thrown into by the proposition before the Convention What was the use of ascertaining the will of the people unless that will was to have some tiled J Under the proposition before them they would have two at pressions of the will of the people the will of the people of the Commonwealth and the will of the people as states and the result might be that both the Senate and the House of Representatives would be upheld by their constituents and the difficulty would be accentuated seen the two Houses being brought into the position of uncompromising hostility they were to have a dual referendum, and the national referendum could again get a majority for The House of Representatives and the Stucs referendum might give a majority for the Senate What was the list of exposing the people and public business to this incessant turmoil, taken at the end of it they were left in a worse position than before 9 It would be better to give up the idea of solving deadlocks than to do this Very Wisely there was a provision that the constitution could not be amended without a majority of the States as well as a majority of the people can cured But by other provisions of the constitution every concern able proposition that might be submitted to the national Parliament was to undergo the same test Could any constitution work it it wisneccs«ary that in every subject of legislation there must be a containing majority under two different sets of circumstances It was pointed out by Mr Bur ton that in all the subjects to be dealt with by the Federal Parliament State interests were involved Every individual in the state was in the electorate of the Commonwealth He was not two individuals so while every State had an interest in these matters every State had not an interest as apart from the interest of the people of the State It there was to be a solution of deadlocks it must have some finality. MR REID SUGGESTS THE NORWEGIAN SYSTEM The position they were in was a choice of unsatisfactory. courses The proposition he would put forward would be an improvement because it would be final, though he did not mean to say it would be satisfactory He did not object to the dissolution, and preferred that power should be given to the executive for a simultaneous or a single dissolution A method that would give them finality was that both Houses should sit and vote together He found that this practice was by no means so uncommon as it was supposed to be He found that this point had been adopted in Austria Hungary, Norway, Belgium, and Switzerland He looked upon the double referendum as the greatest monstrosity and the biggest absurdity that had ever been heard of in this world If two millions out of three millions of people said '' jest' and there were 000 thousand " notes,' the balance of 600 thousand races would be just as effective. He did not advance the sitting together of both Houses as perfect but if there was a dissolution of the two Houses at once or eventually, and they did not agree, were they to stop there He said no they had to provide something to follow , but it should not be a double referendum SIR J DOWNER STICKS TO HIS GUNS Sir J DOWNER said that he had no fear of dead- locks Until a difficulty between the Houses approached a calamity, there was no deadlock Nothing short of a civil war ought to deprive them of the proper and constitutional way of placing a check upon hasty legislation The double dissolution was a of free (hear, hear-and the double referendum was as great a farce (Hear, hear ) no would stand by his previous v are in favour of Mr. Symon's, scheme, because he was not satisfied that those who wore advocating that the scheme should be amended as Sir George Turner issues, would not ask for more in the future This was not a time for compromise It was a time for getting fresh offers, which they did not bind themselves to accept Mr LYNE Do you think it is a wise thing to go onuliouttis quite possible that Queensland will shortly come to the Convention ? Sir JOHN DOWNER said it would be a regret labor circumstance it they did not finish this business before the adjourned (Hear, hear) He supposed it was a question of postponement or breaking up the movement for some time to come, and in these circumstances he would stand to Mr Symon's scheme, and was only sorry that the representatives of the smaller colonies do not accept his (the speaker's) advice to resist all proposals for settling deadlocks (Hear, hear.) Mr. FRASER (Vic) said he would rather see no federation at all than jeopardise the liberties and freedom of the people they had stripped the Senate of all powers that might endanger the liberties of the people hence it would not be fair now to make the Senate amenable to the dictation of any unscrupulous Government A designing Govern shout would select its own time for an appeal to popular clamour His only objection to a double dissolution was that through it the deliberate judgment might not be given The Upper House only existed as a steadying machine If State rights were done away with, then the Darling, the Murrumbidgee, and the E. In and might be controlled by the Federal Parliament He had gone as far as his conscience permitted in trying to settle deadlocks but if such a matter were to be referred to a popular vote, then he thought the members of the Convention might (just as well go home AN OPPONENT OF DEADLOCK PROVISIONS Sir JOHN FORREST said that it seemed to him a very unusual course to again discuss a matter which had been settled already It was a very bad precedent Practically members of the Convention were asked to reverse their decision, and to show themselves weak, vacillating and undignified He for one was not inclined to take up that position It had been asked over and over again why, in the case of a deadlock, the House of Representatives should go first to the country. The answer was that the one House had the control of the executive and the other had not He was altogether opposed to any provision for deadlocks, and he trusted that as in the past so in the future the goodwill and sense of justice characteristic of the British people would prevent any undue amount of friction between the two Houses Against his will it had been decided that there should be a provision for deadlocks, and the question now arose as to what provision that should be Surely the provision that if alter the House of Representatives had been sent to the country the Senate still persisted in its opposition, it also should be sent to the country, would be quite sufficient Mr Reid feated the smaller States combining against the larger ones, but under that gentleman's proposal if the larger States combined against the smaller ones they would have V) votes to la If they voted together the larger States would be able to coerce the smaller ones Those who i represented the larger colonies could not forget that they had for many years been opposed to their Upper Houses, and they seemed to think that the Senate would be a similar body Probably that would not be the case. He was in favour of the proposal they had already carried He was anxious to work amicably with hon members, and in the past he had accepted decisions with w here he did not agree but the time was coming when that inclination on his part would come to an end If they made the Senate weak he did not think he would be able to recommend the acceptance of the constitution to the people of Western Australia that that might be a small matter, but it was the position which he was forced to take up He hoped the members of the Convention would deal with this matter as quickly as they could. A CHAMPION OF THE RIGHT OF THE MATURITY Mr CARRUTHERS said it would be a calamity if the Convention were to adjourn without coming to a decision on this point. He gathered that the suggestion of the Premier New South Wales was one that was growing in favour in the Convention He regretted that in the debate The question had been dwelt upon almost entirely fi< in the State point of view He had never placed the Starts right question as the predominant one He had always recognised the right of the majority, under my constitution, to rule and that did not resolve the question of State rights He believed that the parties under the Commonwealth would be divided, not on geographical lines, but on the party lines to which they had been accustomed, such as democrats and conservatives What he feared was that by any possibility there might be a refusal from time to time the part of the Parliament to give effect to the wishes of the majority of the people If that did occur it would he a national calamity, unless the constitution provided some elastic machinery that would allow evolution to take effect rather than let For solution take effect under a rigid constitution late respected the views of those who refused to allow a safety valve to go into the constitution but he would sooner see the Convention decided by a clear test of some distinct line of cleavage than see them agree to a compromise that was a sacrifice of principle on all sides and was satisfactory to no one There seemed to be an objection to allowing the people to express their opinions in their own way It seemed to be thought that their opinion ought to take the form of the opinion of their representative He saw very little chance of this Convention earning the vote in favour of the mass referendum or of the dual referendum The latter would only offer to the people something which they did not want He would rather see no referendum at all than a reference Aura of that kind Now they must take into their consideration the fact that it might be possible for either House to be so obstructive as to cause a deadlock His own opinion was that the Senate would ultimately become the more radio in Chamber of the two Any proposal must therefore be of a mutual character, and not be aimed at one Chamber only Supposing a State question was involved, a dissolution of the Senate would not affect it, as those who had stood up for the States involved would be returned figure, and there would be no finality After there had had been a dissolution of both Houses, if the proposed law was again refused he proposed there should be a lull conference of both Houses of Parliament to consider the matter M hy should they not give the | orliameiitnr} System fair play-' -as he was only prepared to accept this on the understanding that the majority of the Com entrant was against the mass referendum He was also listed mind! to carry the mass referendum to a vote if he failed to get that he would take the next best scheme which he considered to be the one he proposed to the full conference of both Houses a two thirds majority of these present and voting would be necessary to pass the proposed law and any amendments therein, and it would then be pre sented to the Governor-General for the Queen's assent He also proposed that the referendum should be used to say that a law should not pass, and that it should be lawful for a theory of the conference, being not less than one fourth of the total number of those present, to petition to refer the proposed law to a general vote of the electors of the Commonwealth, and until such vote was taken the proposed law was not to receive the Queen's assent THE NORWEGIAN' SYSTEM CONDEMNED Mr ISAACS said the debate on the Norwegian proposal for the two Houses sitting together was, in his opinion, so much time wasted (Hear, hear.) It was not a provision for settling deadlocks unless the two Houses chose to sit together the proposal amounted to a suggestion which wiped out the small States, in many instances absolutely, and also wiped out many of the provisions they had been endeavour- ing to put into the constitution-most notably in regard to money bills If the proposal was that a majority of the two Houses sitting together was to prevail he would like to soothe representatives of the smaller States agree to it, whilst if the majority was to be anything more than a property of the members of the two Houses he would like to know how it would enable a majority of the people to enforce its will As a matter of fact, it would leave deadlocks just as possible as under any other system Mr REID No Mr ISAACS said that neither New South Wales nor Victoria would over form a constitution with the Senate having a fixed ratio of membership to the House of Representatives and the small States would not agree to the proposal unless the ratio was conceded, as it would lead to them being swamped The dual referendum was the fairest proposal that could be conceded to the smaller States PRAISE FOR MR CARRUTHERS' SCHEME Mr GORDON (S.A.) said it was plain that the dual referendum would not be accepted by the large States, and that the national referendum would not be accepted by the small States Mr Carruthers's proposition had the advantage also of cheapness of practicability, of being via media between the opposing sections, and of being fair to both Houses When Mr Carruthers s motion was moved in detail he would support it, with the proviso that the words " and the Senate " in sub section 1 should be struck out, leaving the executive to dissolve only the House of Representatives Mr REID said Sir George Turner was reported to have said that he could not sue his wavtcasktho Convention to support the suggestion that in the first instance the House of Representatives, which might be right should be penalised without at the same time penalising the other House Mr ISAACS It is quite consistent MR KINGSrOVSSCHLME Mr KINGSTON said he hoped Sir George Turner would stick to his opinion, because the opposite view would relieve the to Bute of the responsibility which attached to the House of Representatives With the object of allaying the fears of the smaller States that they would not be represented he (Mr Kingston) had agreed to the creation of a Senate but he was not prepared to go further and 11 place the Senate in a position to put obstacles with impunity in the way of the accomplishment of the public will Considering the greater frequency with which the House of Representatives went to the country, the presumption on the whole was in favour of its more correctly representing the feeling of the constituencies than the Senate Still if the two bodies could not agree it was far fairer that both should he sent to the country to face the same music He would not press for an abandonment of the amendment which had been earned, but he would press for an addition in the way of conferring on the Executive the power to send the two Chambers to the constituencies, subject to 8 die-hards preventing this power being exercised without due consideration It might be provided that the subject of the deadlock should be in fell in both Houses in two consecutive sessions, and then if no agreement were arrived at both Houses should be sent to the constituencies As regarded simultaneous dissolutions by the will of the Executive, he would say that that power would not be exercised lightly, because by it punishment would be extended to both parties alike Supposing they had l dissolution of both Houses and the position remained the same, what was to be done so Some said a national referendum, and some send a dual referendum He had previously said he would be delighted if they could separate matters of State interest from matters of national interest, and he thought they could do so it they seriously made the attempt. The great majority of cases would not alone State interests, and it would be well generally to provide for the solution of those de idlocks after the double dissolution in a national referendum in would suggest that while they provided a national referendum generally they should give power to a certain section of the House of Representatives to acquire the double referendum for the protection of State rights The power of demanding the dual referendum he would give to one-third of the members of the House of Representatives, or to half of the members of the smaller States in the House of Re- presentatives A dual referendum would he demanded by those sections by their affirm- ing that the matter affected the interests of certain State or States He was prepared to provide for the overruling of the minority by the majority on national questions but the federal idea was that in State matters State interests should be duly conserved the scheme would work out thus They would start with 76 representatives Twenty six of these could demand the protection of the dual referendum, or four South Australians, three last matinees, and three Western Australians could do so This power would not be used lightly, and he felt that some such middle course should be adopted WHAT MR WISE PROPOSES Mr WISE said that the only way to reconcile responsible government with the federal system was to place full powers in the hands of the Executive Unless the Executive had power to dissolve the Senate vetoes might be given from personal ill-will or from a desire to obtain personal popularity in a constituency Every senator should give his vote knowing that he would he liable to answer for it before his constituents Therefore the Executive must have full power to control the Parliamentary machine After a dissolution of the Senate had taken place he was prepared to accept and proposal that might be made for coming to a final decision, whether it was by means of the two Houses sitting together or by means of a dual referendum He was prepared to accept any proposal in this matter which might' be acceptable to the majority, believing that the danger was not a real one, but that at the same time it was necessary to provide some means of meeting any difficulty that might arise if the went " if " were struck out of the amendment, he would. I I propose an alternative scheme that both Houses of Parliament might be dissolved simultaneously provide that a dissolution did not take effect within six months of the period of the time at which the first Chamber would expire in the ordinary course of tune Una would guard against the power of dissolution being recklessly used, or used when the House of Representatives was about to go to the country for the purpose of punishing the Senate, when a dissolution would be no punishment for the House of Representatives THE VICTORIAN PREMIERS SOLUTION" Sir GEORGE TURNER said that he ought to explain that the Victorian delegates were not anxious to obtain the double dissolution, but they would The cept that solution providing there was a double referendum afterwards He did not favour both Houses sitting together, as advocated by Mr Carruthers, although he was prepared to accept that gentleman's proposals as far as the referendum was concerned the provision in Mr Carruthers' a scheme for a two thirds majority neutralized the whole of his proposal is Why not have a bare majority 9 A two thirds majority) would simply hand the large Estates over to the smaller ones He was inclined to think that Mr Kingston had hit the true and proper solution of the difficulty, and the Convention would remember that he had himself in a form for speech stated that certain questions should be settled by a national referendum, and that others should be settled by a dual referendum Mr Reid had also seen the defect, and he had suggested to the smaller States that they should prepare a list of things which they desired to have settled by a dual referendum, but he did not think that this could be done He thought the larger States could accept the scheme, and felt that the smaller ones were empty protected under it (Hear hear ) NATIONAL Ran RUNDUM FOR FINANCIAL DIMICUL1IIS Mr R T O'CONNOR said that is the finances the appropriation for the 01 Immy annual services of the Federal Government, concerned the daily life of the Government, and were the matters on which a deadlock might arise, he would be prepared, as one House alone must rule in regard to those questions, to support the mass referendum That would he carrying out the analogy that the Senate should have no power to amend financial measures or the bill appropriating the supplies for the ordinary services of the Government, He was driven to the conclusion that so far as the mass referendum was concerned, although he would vote for it in the Convention it was a forlorn hope A dissolution had been suggested as a way out of the difficulty He hatchways opposed a dissolution of the Senate except under pressure of absolute necessity, because it appealed to him to he one of the merits of the Senate under the bill that it was not liable to sudden dissolution at hands of the majority of the other House, and that it would pass goes that stability of policy and conduct which con- tinuity of Gilston co product d It would not be altogether removed from the people, for it would be brought into touch with them every three years Much as he disliked the referendum, a referendum to the people would be the only way to solve a difficulty, but a referendum without previous discussion and in previous dissolution would be dangerous to our representative institutions if he saw no other way out of the difficulty he would favour a dissolution with the view of ensuring that the referendum would intelligent!) obtain the views of the people If they had a dissolution it must be a concert rout one A dual life circum would not ensure finals) Rather than have a dull referendum he would have no referendum at all Mr lwngsf oil's suggestion in] beard to be a way out of the difficulty, but the objection to that proposal was that if all the representatives of the smaller States combined they would make the required third, and would on all important matters he able to demand a dual referendum Mr Reid's proposal it appeared to be even a bf tier one, because it ensured finaht), lessened the expense and entailed less disturbance He would be inclined to make it operate until the Federal Parliament otherwise provided. The ol section to the proposal was that it would place the power entirely in the hands of the smaller States, but that might be met by altering the majority from a two thirds to a three fifths majority He was inclined to support Mr Reid's proposal!, because it ensured sunlit) It would be better to arrive at a decision not based upon their own opinions but which would offer some way out of the difficulty Mr HIGGINS (Vic ) said that if 10 representatives from Queensland were introduced at the termination of the present sitting the whole matter might have to be discussed over again He thought that before the Convention parted it ought to consent to a double dissolution There was no difference in pi maple-it was a mere difference in expediency if the Senate were not to be dissolve 1 at the same time as the House of Representatives he did not think there was the slightest chance of the hill passing He regarded Mr Symon s amendment as he perfect in that it penalised the House of Representatives in the last resort he advocated a national referendum He felt deeply disappointed by the action of Sir George Turner in regard to the national referendum, because when there was a prospect of it being carried-(laughter)-all hope was shattered by the speech of the Victorian Premier Sir GEORGE TURNER It never had a shadow of a ghost of a show (61 cers } Mr HIGGINS said that if the bill did not contain that principle he was certain that it would never have a shadow of a ghost of a show of being accepted in the larger colonies (2 No, no ") Sir John Downer said he would vote for the dual referendum because it was a farce He (Mr Higgins would vote for it because it would not be a farce Mr Kingston's proposal that a third or fourth of the members of the House of Representatives should declare what was a State matter, and must there fore be referred to a vote of the States and not to a mass referendum would not secure finality, and therefore was not acceptable Ihn poposalofMr Carruthers that both Houses in cases of di lb all by should sit together and try to solve it was also unacceptable, because, in the first place, it would not be fair to allow members of the Senate elected by a restricted number of electors, to he of the same voting power as those elected for the House of Representatives by a larger number of electors and in the second place, it would enable the Senate to to interfere with a money bill over which a deadlock had occurred He also could not approve of Mr Carruthers'' proposal that in the joint sitting a two thirds majority should decide a matter A simple majority should be sufficient He felt bitterly about a proposal for a dual referendum coming from his own colony. He hoped they would adopt the proposal of Mr Carruthers, which would give some kind of a solution Mr N J BROWN (Tas ) said he would appeal to the Convention to have some finality in the debate upon the subject before them. It was about time they came to a decision one way or the other. He thought most of them had made up their minds how they would vote on the question before the committee Mr HOLDER (S A ) find they seemed to be making very little progress To listen to the debate one would think that they were not contemplating a union among friends, but among people who vi ere waiting for a chance to fly at each other s throat the difference of opinion in the Convention was not one between States, but between those who wished to give the fullest possible expression to the public will and those who desired to put on the break Some hon. members seemed to desire to provide cheeks and delays so is to stop movements of reform till those who advocated them became tired and, lost hope He wanted a Senate to protect State interests, not to interpose cheeks and dear) s I those who voted for Mr. fa}mon s amendment were, with one exception, Conservatives, and those who vo ful agAinst it were all in favour of progress and obedience to the public till the proposition of Mr Symon was absolutely pro noBtcrous he believed in reflection but it must be Reflection after both sides of the case had been heard, and not after merely hearing one side of the case He was sure that Mr bvuiou'tj } proposal would not be accepted at the dual meeting of the Convention the dual referendum settled nothing If any thing, it left the mat but in a worse position than before He suggested that the question of deadlocks, like that of finance should be set aside for future discussion, and that something should be adopted that evening which was purely tentative so that it might be debated on the platform and in the press Mr BARTON said that it would be unwise to adopt the proposal of Mr Holder He did not think that any proposal should be adopted on the mere ground that it was tentative The Convention must do in the limited time available to it all that it You Id do and show the public that it was correct in its work, and was not doing anything which was merely pro forma The question has now been debated for four days, and it was time that a division was aim ed at He believed that the proposal of Sir George I umer was superior to that of Mr L>ne But having decided to Mick to responsible government they were not consistent or hue to their arguments when they turned to an expedient which would 1 sap and under one responsible government that was the referendum (Hear, hear) At the same time he did not consider a member was true to federation who withstood any demand for a concession unless he received this or that in return (Hear, hear ) Much as he was against the referendum he would submit to it under the limitation that the responsibility of Ministers and me a horse must be first * lOgmsed (Hear, hear ) The difficulty with regard to the dual referendum won that it would be most difficult to discriminate between what were 8th to and what were national questions [To whs at first perfectly prepared to adopt the double dissolution but not the consecutive dissolution but after considering the various schemes he had been unable to find a combination of justice and effectiveness in the mass of the dual referendum for where one preponderated in favour of justice it was ineffective, and where the other preponderated in favour of effectiveness it was unjust If they could find a solution which avoided the referendum he was prepared to welcome it so long as it was fur He consider ed that the constitution as it stoudwüsßufhcicut, without making any exact merits but if public opinion demanded some experiment let them try and arrive at one that combined effectiveness and justice He was not pinned down absolutely to any proposal, but he could not help thinking that there was a great deal of good sense in the proposal ina do by Mr Hmd He would prefer that the sitting of the two Houses together should follow a dissolution of both Houses Every one knew that Mr Reid and he did not camp in the same place politically, but they were at one in think- ing that if there was some reasonable method of getting out of the difficulty they should leave off than splitting and take what was common BBuaepnd 'UL3011 He would vote for Sir George rumors amendment as against Mr Lj nos, but Mr Reid's proposal ii received consideration Mr ISAAC JS That will mean that the ratio be two cou the two Houses must be preserved. Mr. BARTON said it did, but he had not been able to come to the conclusion that Victoria more than any other colony would suffer from the ratio proposed, or that there was any injustice in that ratio The CHAIRMAN said that after he put the first question the general discussion must cease, and he would continue the debate to the particular question before the chair Mr GLYNN said that if no provision was made for deadlocks very little harm would result With the exception of the solution offered by Mr Car fathers none of the suggested remedies here final Mr ISAACS And that is not final Mr GLYNN said that there were two methods which heart is prepared to adopt that of Mr Cm authors and that of Sir George Turner As a matter of fairness to the large States he could not see how the smaller States could adopt the proposition of Mr Simon, how wise it would absolutely impose a penalty upon the introduction of radical measures in the Lower House Mr LYNE said he was determined if he could to have straight-out tote on the question of amass referendum, because he intended to use that vote hereafter He desired, if he possibly could, to take a test vote on the word " is " The Chairman put the question that the word " if " he left out in Mr Lyne a proposal The in ord ii as struck out on the voices The CHAIRMAN said that Sir George Turner proposed to fill up the blank with certain other words, and Mr "Wise proposed an amendment on Sir George 1 Turner's amendment He would put the amendment proposed by Mr. Wise upon Sir George Turner's amendment Mr WISE said his amendment meant that before all question arose as to the application of the referendum, whether dual or nation al, or la fore any question arose as to the two Houses sitting together, there should be a simultaneous dissolution, and that there could be no dissolution of the Senate during the last six months of the life of the House of Represent leaves Uni amendment was agreed to on division by 25 votes to 20 The division was as follows - Toit THE AMENDMENT New South Wales -Sir I P Abbott, Barton, Brunker, Carruthers, Lyne, O'Connor Held, Walker, Was Victoria Sir Graham Berry, Deakin, Higgins, Jmuics, Peacock, Quick, Sir George Turner South Australia Dr. Cockburn, Gordon, Holder, Kingston, Solomon "Vi Western Australia -Hackett Tasmania -Clarke, Sir P.
