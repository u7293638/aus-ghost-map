A BALLAD BY MS. HALL . CAINE, In the first number of London Some, a new magazine edited by Mr. Ealph Caine, appears a Manx ballad, by Mr. Hall Caine, entitled Grain my Chree, or Love of my Heart. It recounts the story of a sea rover, named Juan, be trothed to a rich man's daughter, and driven from her father's door because he is poor. Juan is shipwrecked, and hia love contracts a wealthy marriage ; bnt in the midst of a wild storm his ghost returns and carries off his bride to the depths of the sea. Tho ballad is full of stirring .lines, . written with no little dramatic power and intensity, graphically illustrated by Mr. Arthur Hughes. Here is the stanza which tells of the first engagement : â€” He broke a ring and gave her the half, And she buried it close at her heart. ' I must leave thee, love of my goal,' he said, 'r ' But I vow by our troth that, living oi dead, , I will come back rich to thine arms an-S thy bed, And fetch thee as sure a6 we part.' And this is the final doom : '- O, then as she sank in the water's womb, In the churn of the choking sea, :, She knew that his arms were about her breast, ' ' ' Ab close as his arms might be. And he cried o'er the tramp of the chomping tide ' On the banks of Italy. ~ ' By the plight of troth, by the power of our bond, If not in this world, in ihe world beyond, Thou art mine, O Graih my Ghree.'
