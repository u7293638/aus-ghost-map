YE GEELONG SPORT. Hooray, hooray, For Geelong's ''fast" day! Fancy—that is if you can—Geelong For once in its life beset by a throng; Moorabool-street, By way of a treat, Finding itself in a perfect heat With a crowd, Rapid and loud, Passing a place mostly still as a shroud; Its wonted quiet Turned into riot; Shouts and uproar Where rarely before Had aught louder been heard than the ghost of a snore. Geelong, of all places under the sun, The scene where a champion race is being run! Its a fact, as I know, For I've seen the nags go, And, strange to remark, they did not gallop slow. After this, who can doubt There might be a rout In a chapel, a grave yard, Sleepy Hollow, or out In the midst of Sturt's Desert, where Howitt declares There's nought to be seen but stones, stillness, and stars.
