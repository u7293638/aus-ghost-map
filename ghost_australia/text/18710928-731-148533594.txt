THE SPIRITS IN LONDON. I MelboueKk, — according to the Har » binger of Light, the orgau of the Vic torian spiritists has its ' mediums, itjS «« circles,' its wonder-working ' in ^mib^es but the ' Bpirits' of this side tbe globe have evidently something to learn from their English confreres. .The following is from the London Daily Ttlegi aph of July 5 : — - If the new feats of the metropolitan spirits become common, the difficulties j oi London locomotion will be quickly j Bolved. We need liave no disputes about ' bad' cabs, narrow omnibuses, (Underground rails^ vergrouud tramways . or even travelling balloons, if it be true that Mrs. Guppy, described by her friends as bne of the biggest women In London j11, jcan he carried through the air from Highbury to Lamb's Con duit-street in the course of a m minutes. This, remarkable, event took place on. the 8ird of June, i871 : eight witnesses, voot counting the transported lady and the two mediums, testify to it, and tlioBe eight- include Mr. Henry 1 Mortis*} Gde^cribed as a ' Man Chester merchant of high standing,' Mr. Ed wards, a B.A.^of Cambridge, and other ladies and gentiemen who sign their %)iam%s and 'addresses to the statement. The story, is,, 'pimple. A dark seance took place at the lodgings, of the two * A spirit voice jexclaimed Jlis.

If, when a man comes down to supper, he finds his wife gone off with the spirits, leaving only a pair of slippers on his deserted hearth, his tem per may not stand it. Nor can he like, when be comes home for a quiet even ing, to find a male medium ou the floor of his library, and to be told that he had just dropped in through the ceiling and wanted something to drink. It is curious enough that exactly at the time when this strange tale of the female Guppy, to use the coarse but exact language of naturalists — is pub lished, there should appear a scientific man on the odd and curious phenomena associated with the presence of Mr. Home, the well-known medium. Mr. William Crookes, the editor of the Quarterly Journal of Science, a physicist of high repute, has carefully investigated Mr. Home's manifestations. The point to which he directed his attention were (1) the alteration in the weight of bodies, and (2) the playing of tunes on musical instruments with human agency. Mr. Crookes constructed an apparatus by which he could test, in pounds, exactly the amount of pressure exer cised on a mahogany board. One end of the board was on a table, and, when Mr. Home's fingers rested on it, the other end descended to the same extent at oiie time as; if there had been a ' pull' of six pounds. Mr. Crookes tried what he could do, by resting the whole weight of his own body on the end barely touched by Mr. Home s fingers, and he found that even by ' jerking' he could only affect it to tbe extent of a two-pounds ' pull.' He next placed an accordion in a wire cage open at the .top. Mr. Home, in the presence of four witnesses, in a room fully lighted by gas, touched the end farthest from the keys, and the accor dion played a tune-,- the cage so sur rounding the instrument that nobody could touch the keys, which were visible all the time. Mr. -Crdokes says that these experiments indicate -a -new force which he calls ' Psychic' — a force ra diating from some men and at uncertain time's — so that the absence of the force in other men or at other times will not disprove its existence. His witnesses in this experiment, who endorse his account, are'DrT Huggins, the, astron- omer, and Mr. Sergeant Cox — the .one bringing scientific, the other legal knowledge. The Sergeant, with great courage, states the theory of the new force as a ' force proceeding from the nerve system capable of imparting motion and weight to solid bodies within the sphere of its influence' — for instance tables and chairs. He also considers it purely ' human.' We say nothing as to the ^discovery ; we respectfully wait for further facte, but if this new light be true, it more entirely upsets ' spirit' rapping than anything else yet an-, nonnced. When raps come announcing that our deceased grandmother wishes us to marry Mary Ann Jones, we shall know in future that the message comes from the human nerves of Mary Ann's sister sitting at the other side of. the table. All of us are willing enough to believe anything that would dispel the monotony of usual life, with its births, deaths, and marriages, breakfasts, din ners. and suppers, men, women, and children and nothing else. If there were spirits with new forces, and new locomotions, and flying women and garrulous grandmothers long deceased, we should- all rejoice. And in that hope who. has not sat round tables mute as a mouse, patient as a nun, listening to raps which, being interpreted were no better than the every day talk of the 'present company,' only stammered out through noisy wood? Who has not sat beside pretty women, believers or dupes, and felt that in the cause of science one conld look at such hand some priestesses of th.e new religion for several successive hours ? Yet, as ' little Peterkin' observed, with a wis dom beyond his age, ' what good came of it at the last '? Not a word was said that the medium could not have said in her waking hours. This was the perpetual miracle — that ghosts should walk, and spirits come from regions the most remote, merely to prattle prose not half so good as that uttered in the lucid intervals of the evening when the circle was ''broken up/' aqd some lady being asked to play something, conversation set in with its accustomed vivacity. Now all this strangeness is dispelled, if Mr. Crookes and Serjeant Cox are right in their sup position, that the movements and the raps come invisibly from the ' nerves' of somebody present* who is neither wiser nor better than the company around, and who plays upon us through the agency of his abnormal gift. But still the new ' nerve force' does not explain Mrs. Guppy's flight, nor Mr. Hearne's playful prank of. entering breakfast-rooms on all fours, unheralded, unexpected, and unannounced.
