SOME QUAINT ANALOGIES. | We are told that this is the age of record breaking and of interviews , it is also the age of comparisons (observes the London Evening star- dard) Yet in constantly drawing comparisons we are but emulating unconsciously the example set by several great writers of a past era, and by many literary celebrities of the last three centuries Even in the days of Aristotle the trick of drawing quaint comparisons was not entirely unknown and 300 years ago Shakespeare himself was greatly addicted to it Solomon of old likened a man's name to a precious ointment, while Transats Petrarch, as is well known, compared la faiblesse queen appeal favour with, a disease that oftentimes afflicts men of genius Thackeray, in his admirable description of old Mr Osborne's whirnsicnlitios, explains how that inimitable plebeian was wont to " fall prostrate and bask " in the smile of a lord, " as a Neapolitan beggar basks in the sun " How truly the same might be said of many modern Radicals who profess to hate the sight of " the bloated aristocracy " Dryden, Samuel Johnson, Milton, Bacon, Lamb, George Eliot, in short, almost every writer of high standing, has touched up his canvas either with metaphorical tints or with brilliant analogies Johnson's "Rasselas" fairly teems with comparisons that help more firmly to impress upon the reader's mind that interesting narrative and though in most of their analogies both Johnson and Bacon are less happy than Lamb, Sir Francis made a clever hit in likening money to much " (manure), which, he says, is no good unless it be spread Clover, also, is his fanciful analogy, which declares that a man courteous to strangers proves himself to be a citizen of the world, whose heart is no island cut off from other lands, but a continent that joins to them " Lord Lytton's comparisons are for the most part very brilliant Apparently, the author who made eccentric Mr Caxton, of " My Novel " notoriety, declare that novels had become " a necessity of the age," himself believed the art of drawing sharp and witty comparisons to have become a necessary adjunct to the novelist's stock-in-trade What dosonphon could better picture to us that all stirring scene in " A Strange Story," where the Brute Hurricane having for over shattered Margrave's hope of discovering the Elixir of Life, and then swept over the vast expanse of charred and and praise, than the description contained in the single, impressive line- ..." and there the plains stretched black and desert as Phlog roan Field of the Poet's Hall When a genius, such as the late Lord Lytton, enforces his words with the aid of comparisons, the result is singularly striking But this, unfortunately, is not the case with regard to many of our fin de suite and less gifted story- tellers Three out of six heroes of modern fiction, so unfortunate as to be born in a cottage, will be found contrasted with Robert Bloomfield If they chance to have a charming manner, they will be found likened to Anstippus, even though half the readers may never before have heard of Aristippus In eight novels out of ten penned by sentimental maidens fresh from school the ideal man has either the " urbanity of a Caesar," of the " grace of a licence" or the " eloquence of a Pinto," or the " stoicism of an Epictetus ," not to mention such minor attractions as the speculative blue eye of the Saxon," the passionate high nose of the Norman," the " head of a Medusa," the "figure of an Achilles, and, perhaps, the "voice of an Apollo " The leading lady is, of course, fully upon a par with this Adonis, especially when 01 ented by a very young man If not blessed with the wisdom and the chastity of of Minerva" which might make her seem prudish-at least, Bhe " sleeps like Epimomdes " and " weeps like Desdemona " Naturally "the sight of her tears would unman n Herod " It is almost needless to add that her voice, like Cordoba's, is ever low, and we may depend upon her mother having " the ample symmetry of a Venus of Milo," if, indeed, her father's features were not " worthy of Myron, the Greek sculptor " In political novels of this class the chief characters rhetoric " would cause Quintilian to turn in his grave," or " De mastheads to blush crimson " Sometimes not often he is " a legislator great as Lycurgus," or " might well rival the Athenian Solon," but he invariably is as just a man as Aristados," as remarkable a philosopher "as Seneca," or as Newton," or as Kant," as the case may be, while, as practical politicians, Pitt, Parr, and Person dwindle into intellectual pigmies when compared with him Perhaps, while addressing his constituents, he feels " restless as TJlyBses," but, upon the Speaker rising to order he and his supporters instantly pause, " as the fates paused from their web at the sound of the lyre of Orpheus " Never by any chance do they " wait for an answer " If they fail to pause as the fates paused, then, " like Brutus," they "pause for a reply" On the other hand, the bad man is usually afflicted with the beard of a Jewish Rabbi," and " a voice grant! as that of Grant Blunder here He may be "glum as Pharaoh's ghost," or, among facetious writers, " melancholy as a missionary," or even "dull as a beetle," but these are in extreme cases only A very frothy scribe, one ranking among " the new humourist," as they are called, might possibly give him an alcoholic grin" and a "gin and water stutter," but few would thus defy conventional customs Fully half the abnormalities we meet with in these stories appear " unseemly as it Wellington nose on the face of a new-born babe," while every chess-player referred to is either a Zukertort or a Blackburne, and two thirds of the conquests achieved through the hero's " sheer prowess " are " tasks of a Sisyphus " Almost needless it is to add that a tall, ferocious man becomes " as big as the late Ben Caunt," of " great as the immortal Heenan " It would, indeed take long to enumerate the multis anons comparisons now a-days employed by certain incipient novelists and journalists Many of these anomalies are introduced appropriately, but many more are totally unsuitable, drugged in, as it were, in order to denote the writers knowledge Sot, among all classes, the " comparison " habit seems to be spreading Only last week an army bus-driver, speaking of his horses, observed to us, "e'B as stiff as a prayer book, that near 'loss is," and singularly apt the analogy was Subsequently he volunteered the information that he felt " as dry as that Old Man s humour," thereby alluding, we presume, to the statesman who, according to Lord Randolph Churchill, takes so extravagant survey of human affairs in general " Any large vessel is by the critics "compared, either with the Campania or with Brunel a Great Eastern But the most far-fetched companion on record is that of Archbishop Tillotson, who called a rifle wound " the kindly kiss of a bullet " During a fairly recent discussion as to whether "invisible grey " would make a suitable colour for soldiers' uniforms, Plato's helmet was frequently referred to H an epidemic among savages secures many victims, wo road that the natives are dying like flies in a winter blast " Every strange animal seems bound to resemble the Beast in the Apocalypse while the mention of machines to cause perpetual motion will necessitate a comparison being drawn between the latest device of the sort and the famous one made by Offyrews about the beginning of the last century The number of times that ecclesiastics have been contrasted with the person in the " Northern render," the number of times disastrous investments have been likened to Mr. Percy Fitzgerald's " Fatal Zero," and the number of times tops or dandies have been compared with Aristotle, with Horace, with Socrates, with Pythagoras, even with Buffon, is incredible. Most people look to ancient history for their subjects To say that Mr So-and-so speaks like Mr Gladstone, though, no doubt, a very great compliment, does not impress us nearly so much as a statement to the effect that Mr. So-and-so possesses a gift of oratory equal to that of Demosthenes himself Still, considered in the abstract, the trick of repeatedly comparing is far less odious than many at present rampant amongst us, and, if only on the gioHuel that the successful drawing of comparisons necessitates wide research, it may be pardoned
