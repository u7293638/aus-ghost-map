THE Morning Bulletin will bo issued as usual to morrow, but, in order that our employees may aa far as possible eDjoy the holiday, the Bulletin Office will be closed from ten till seven o'clock. IN accordance with the new regulations the public offices n this town will close at four in the afternoon instead of five after to- morrow. ON Friday there was a break on the western telegrim line between Springsare and Tambo, and on Saturday direct communica- tion with the south was interrupted. AT the Bijou Theatre, Cremorne, on Satur day evening, there was' a. change o{-pro gramme. " Maria Martin, or tri». Múrder in the Bed Barn," the plot of which ia taken from actual life, was played instead of " Ned Kelly." Mies Kate Douglass as Maria Martin played her arduous part with dramatic effect. ^ Miss Gertrade Duke and Mr. Balfe aa the sister and father respectively ' of the murdered girl acted well ; and Mr. I Griffiths as William Corder, thc murderer, creditably performed his part, especially in the ghost scenes, when the spirit j of Maria Martin appears to bim, and feeds the j murderer's remorse. The last scene, in which the ghost appears in the prison, was very good, and the arrangement ot the blue light waa j much better than on the first appearance of the ghost, when it turned too irregularly. A concert and screaming farce concluded the programme. A new drop scene, painted by Tom Bevis, a local artist, is well executed, and is a decided improvement. AT the Police Court on Saturday, John Jonea was brought before the Police Magis- trate under a warrant on a charge of assault- ing his wife Mary Jones, and to rind sureties to keep the peace. Mr. Butter, of Messrs.. Jones and Brown, appeared for the com- plainant, who deposed that defendant beld a shingle hammer over her head, and threatened to kill ber with it, The evidence of the last witness waa corroborated by ber daughter, and the prisoner waa ordered to find two sureties ia £20 each, to keep the peaoe for three calendar months ; and himself to bo bound under a like sum. A woman, who was charged with being drunk and disorderly, was discharged with a caution. Benjamin Saunders, who had been arrested on the information rif L, P. Anderson for larceny of some silk thread valuod at ia. Gd., was discharged, after the prosecutor's evidence had been taken, as he could not swear the prisoner, who was employed in the shop, could not have saved the thread in his work, which he would be entitled to as a perquisite according to tbs custom of the trade. BKFOBE leaving the office on Saturday last, the employees of the Morning Bulletin invited Mr. William Burton, the business manager, to the composing room, where be was pro seated with an address consequent on bis early resignation of his appointment in the offioe, for the purpose of starting business on bis own account. Mr. John Bird, in making the presentation on behalf of the "com- panionship," expressed the general feeling of regret felt in the office at Mr. Burton's in- tended departure, but trusted the change would be tor that gentleman's benefit and advancement. In reply, Mr, Burton stated I ms inability to make an adequate response for the honour done him. He should ever cherish feelings of the utmost attachment and interest in the Bulletin and to his many friends in thc office. The greatest unanimity and good feeling had always existed between them and he trusted would continue. Ho thanked them very heartily for the honour conferred on bim. The address, which was Quite a work of art, wasbeantifullyand skilfully etched with pen and ink by Mr. Diehard Schmidt, of th« Harbours and Hivers Depart- ment, and read as follows :-" Presented to William Burton by the employees of thej Morning Bulletin.-Dear Sir,-We, onih^Js* eve of your departure from Q^Ê^^^^M Bulletin Office, take this modejf^^^^^^H f'ou our keen appreciation qualities during the been business manager^f^^^^^^^^^^^H For the years ja^^^^^^^^^^^^H you omc^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^H you a friend ABg^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^H ever obli^^^^^^^^^^^^^^H way ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^H Whilst rer/rettins: S^B^B^B^B^B^B^B your wii^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^H the change ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^H that ty^^^^^^^^^^^^^^H veranee *P^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^| The teal^^^^^^^^^^^^^H by a jeweV^^^^^^^^^^^^H made was s^^^^^^^^^^^^fl AN oocurred S^^^^^^^^^^^^H some n^^^^^^^^^^H though not to^^^^^^^^^^H Eight yoo^^^^^^^^^H them no unused to^^^^^^^^^^H ospeoiall/a sterj^^^^^^^^^^H tho i^^^^^^^^^H to one the numerous isléá^^^^^^^^^^H poon, and many were enl^^^^^^^^^^H towards them as they proceedeo^^^^^^^^H wind being in their favour and thot^^^^^^H the waves, which by the bye, wereQ^^^H rough, splendidly. .Further and further^^^| tliey sailed until about two miles had bè^H traversed, when some oí the running gear got~^ jammrjil aloft, and a young man ll st. weight essayed to " ¿ut things right."

" WE learn with much pleasure there is a I probability of sugar cane crashing being com , ipenced at Pandora Plantation this week. Thc machinery has all been got into admirable ' order, and «pona trial beiag made of it on Saturday last it was found to work splendidly. A few stalks of cane were put through the mill, and yielded a fair supply of juioe of about IO" density. It is probable the formal f opening will take place bo Thursday neit, and wo have no doubt the Directors will mark an event of so muoh importance in f connection with the interests of the district i a proper manner. A LATE visitor to Emu Park informs ns that I ' the number of townspeople that arrived there I on Saturday last was very large, being con B »idorably in excess of the visitors daring the I Christmas holidays. They were attracted 1^ thjtber, perhaps, by reason of the announoe ?f,.-v.iit in the local papera that races would bs B£_*V|)d there to-morrow (New Year's Day). t¿'e,isr^_Er»li and Williams arc-fully alive to B^Mtaeceseiiy oTprovidiri^amnssmeDt for their Ms^Emerous oostoiriére, and to them the t '^^s'New Year " travellers will be indebted for j IL «ports which will relieve the monotony of K> residence at the sea-side. The " Invincible " Bi And Mr, Williams' coach left ton n on Saturday L, Afternoon with a good number of passengers, f bot up to the time of our informant's departure [ bad not arrived at the journey's end. As soon as the. drapery and grocery shops were dosed '., on Saturday evening a great many young men ' loft for the sea-side on horseback, and those who desire to witness the first sports held at i Emu Park in 1884 bave one more opportunity ; : of reaching that resort,' as Mr. Pratt's " lu ? vincible" leaves town this evening at eight j f o'clock. IT will be within the recollection of many of oar reader! that some little time back a Ímao named George Rollston 'dUai Cockney escaped from a police officer, who was escort- ing him from Mackay to Rookhamnton, where he was to undergo a term of six months' im- prisonment far larceny at the former place. He jumped from the vessel he came down the >' coast in jost as she cast alongside the wharf, <uid, it being dark at the time, he made good ! bis. escape. The police were soon on bis ^-»cks.'and it wu found he bad wandered in the direotion of the Pandara Sugar Plantation, rhere be' was discovered t>y Mounted, unstable Fahey concealed ia a box. While he -«« "serving bis time " here from information received it turned oat that be was " wanted " ' in the south for larceny, and on his rel« ue from Mr. Sheeny's quarters he was re-arres ed, this time on a charge of having stolen a puree , containing 15s. Od. from a yoong woman j¿ named Ellen Davis, at Sandy Gallop, on the ft £9th May last. He was brought before the LÄ- i teach here, and remanded to Ipswich, and W by the columns of the Queensland Tima |. of the 22nd December we observe that at \- the Ipswich Police Court he was committed to take his trial st the next sittings of tbs e District Court, to be held there on the 26th r February. The evidence of Miss Davis was t- to the effect that she was at an exhibition at I Sandy Gallop on the 29th May, and while I looking; at some pianos, feeling some one at I her dress pocket, turned round and saw B Rollston with his left hand in her pooket ; Ht she tared him with taking her purse, to which ? be replied, "BlesB your heart, I have not Í taken it," and ran away. She also stated she <£ gave information to a mounted constable and if 't>young man named Willum Gee, who do- I k< posed that hu chased prisoner, who, after r denying having taken the purse, put his hand [;. in his pocket and gave him 10s. io silver, L' which hs handed to the lady named.
