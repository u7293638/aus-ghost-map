JACK THE RIPPER DEAD. Jack the Ripper is dead. He died (says Figaro) in a private lunatic asy- lum in England, unknown to the ma- jority of the public, but his identity was fully established some time before his death. He was a medical student of good family and considerable means, and there is no reason to suppose that when his family first put him under forcible restraint, they had any idea that he was the author of the White- chapel horrors. Two prominent jour- nalists, G. R. Sims and T. P. O'Connor, M.P., are among the few who know the facts of the case. The whole matter has been kept very dark as it was felt that no good would be done by re- opening the case. The police authori- ties however, were aware of the cir- cumstances, and undoubtedly felt relieved, when the human fiend gave up the ghost.
