THE GOLD DISCOVERY NEAR ROCKHAMPTON. (from the Rockhampton Bulletin, September 22) Within the past fortnight vague surmises have been floating about Rockhampton relative to the discovery of a rich auriferous deposit in the vicinity, and public curiosity has been greatly ex- cited by the announcement, on apparently credible authority, that a party of men had applied to the water police magistrate with the view of obtaining a reward to which they believed they were entitled by the result of their prospecting. It was, in fact, stated that four men had procured in seven weeks some hundred ounces of gold within two days' journey of Rockhampton, and, though consentaneous with the publication of the report we said that there was no reliable information as to the details, and cau- tioned our readers against extravagant anticipations, the commu- nity manifested decidedly feverish symptoms, which, per tele- graph, extended themselves to Brisbane and Sydney.

Mr Keene, mintroiogist to the Government of \cw South Wales, hos courttouslv furnished us with the undermentioned opinions as to the gold ducovery near Ro«s' station -"The geological formation of the locality where the men aro at work is too recent to be very aurifetou», being similar in character to that of the Canoona di(.glnFs, extending apparently from the Serpentine Kacges in tho vicinitv of Apis Creek, to the Bcreakcr Ringo Bcvond Ap's Creek, and com- prising the Peok Downs, the formation of tho country, giologlcnllv spcul ing, is of an older upheaval, and of an age and characttr known to contain rich deposits-such, for instance, as the Lachlan gold-fields in New South Wales. The recent geology is distinguished by '¿omparativcly birren quartz reef«, and Mr, Keene kDOws of no payable gold field on it in New South Woles. W uh record to thu locality of Ross' diggings, Mr, Keene thinks it probable that the upheaval like that of Peak Downs moy be found nearer the coast. Mr Keene has, wc Lciiove, supplied a moro detailed report of Roes' diggings to tbe Police Magistrnto, but, la accordance with official cliquette, it will be transmuted to tho Lxccutive prior to being modo public, ,
