AMUSEMENTS. THE GARRICK THEATRE. MISS ACHURCH'S FAREWELL. It was well that they played "Auld Lang Syne " as the curtain M ont don upon the death scene which brings the drama of Adrienne Lecouvreur to an end It was well, because it set one thinking, brought before one forcibly the fact that this was probably the last occasion on which Miss Janet Achurch would appear in Sydney. The audience. crowded and enthusiastic, had been applauding at Linton also through the whole piece, but it reserved its ho truest marks of appreciation until the finish, when Miss Achurch and Mr Charrington stood bowing their appreciation of the compliment paid diem, and the orchestra thundered out the fine old pastime tune This was the end of the farewell benefit tendered to Miss Achurch and Mr Charrington last night, and the ending showed that the two talented players have won the hearts of at least a section of the Sydney play-going public It is not for us to explain why Ibsen, to use a vulgar phrase, does not " catch on, nor why such high-class dramas as "The New Magdalen " and " Masks and Faces " are not generally so popular as sensational melodramas The reason is not far to seek It is only when really refined artists take hold of pieces such as we have mentioned that success is achieved, and the Charnngton season, just brought to a close, affords a striking proof of this fact For the past sol on weeks Miss Achurch and Mr Ch Errington have appeared nightly at the Garrick, and we have seen Miss Achurch as btopknuio in "Forget Me Not," as Camille in Dumas' well-known play, as the light and furious M licent in Pinero's "Money Spinner," as the sad heroine of the " >ow Magdalen Morey Murnck, as Peg Woffington m Charles Leads s " Masks and races, and last, but not least, as Norah Helmer in Ibsen's great drama It was in this character that she first impressed her personality on a SA duty audience, and it was entirely owing to the sensation created by her representation of the wilful, headstrong Norah that the season at the Criterion Theatre in July last proved such a success The discussion which followed is too recent to need roviMil The Ibsen mains set Sydney, as it his done London and Paris, by the ears, and the embers of the conflict still smoulder The old argument as to the morality of Norah's conduct were revue ed the other day when the Char autons put on Norah in aid of a goodly object, the Women's College and it may be expected that each production of this drama will arouse a fresh host of critics Indeed, looking at the matter from a purely outside point of view, it is to be regretted that the Charringtons could not have given us more of the great Norwegian author's plays the vast majority of Sydney playgoers only know of Ibsen as the writer of the Doll's House " The awful drama of " Ghosts," the cynical piece of social analysis, "The Enemy of the People," the satirical "Pillars of Society," or the latest sensation, "Hedda Gabler" are quite unknown here, and the daring of the players who would interpret these expressions of the "new spirit " would surely merit public recognition However, Djsen apart, Miss Achurch and Mr. Charrington have done much to elevate and refine our dramatic tastes We need it, yes even the most sanguine upholder of the modern theatre will admit there is a certain air of refinement, a total absence of vulgarity, and an innate suggestion of good taste which is noticeable in all they touch the influence extends through all their characters, showing itself prominently in some, and being hardly marked in others Still this indefinable sensation is always present, and it is for this reason, perhaps, that Miss Achurch succeeds least well when posing is a silent mondame As a woman of stern austere virtue, full of unflinching determination to do what she believes to be right, Miss Achurch triumphs Witness Norah and Mercy Merrick As the loving, tender, trustful girl-actress, the Adnenno Lecouvrour, of fact and of fiction, she was even greater laurels, for feminine softness is in this character wedded to genius, and the result is an ideal woman This is the character, after Norah, in which she will best be remembered by Sydney people, if only because she chose it for her fare- well performance And Mr Durrington, though he has appeared in many roles, has never got on IIB any - thing better than his faithful, over a areas in Michon not We can well afford to wish the two players every success in the country tours which they are about to commence under the most ad verse climatic conditions The showers of floral tokens thrown on the stage last night showed that the wish was echoed by the audience, whose demonstrations of sympathy and approval were greater than even the emotional nature of the drama warranted there was a personal element noticeable, a feeling that it was not Adrienne but Janet Achurch who was leaving Hence, when Adricnuc, after all simulation wits ever, come to life again as Miss Achurch, the demonstration was quite o\ embalming, and a heartier " good-bye " has probably never been given by a Sydney audience A number of handsome bouquets were presented to Miss Achurch during the performance, one of the most striking being from Messrs Pearce Bros.
