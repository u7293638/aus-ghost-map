Little Pearl, 20 to 1 v. The Bit Lady. To the wonder of everyone, Mr. Tait's two year-old pony cut out the running at a marvellous pace for five furlongs, when her. strength failed her. The favorite came at this stage, and, cutting down The Bit Lady in the straight, won by two lengths from Little Pearl ; the pony, a similar distance off, was third. The running of The Bit Lady will undoubtedly be the feature of the meeting. Time,-1 minute 2l£¡8econds. FIRST HURDLE RACE, of 50 sovs.--About 2i mites.:- . . ;-'??.>, Mr. E. N.

Swithin was at first in command, but Warrego assumed the lead passing the stand, with Little Pearl in third position. Warrego, going strongly, drew out for a three lengths' lead at the six furlongs post. Here Mercer commenced to ride the favorite, but he gained very little. Half, a mile from home Swithin was under the whip, and Taloula emerged slowly from the fear. Tho chestnut ran very gamely. Mercer's finish was a splendid piece of horsemanship, and the electric rush he made in the straight demoralised War- rego, who gave in at the distance. Swithin won with a bit in hand by a length ; Taloula was a bad third, and the rest were nowhere. Time, 2 minutes 45 second?. ... ;.
