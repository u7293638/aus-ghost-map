ThebarquentineMayflower,CaptainLouden, which arrived here from Mackay late on Saturday night, says the Wide Bay and Burnett Neirs oí Tuesday, brought a Bplendid spécimen of on alligator, which has been stuffed and mounted by the crew,_ and looks better even than when alive. It is a decent lisna saurian for a baby, being 14ft. 2in., and quite 2 ft across the back. While the ship was lying fifteen miles north of Mackay, the ?kipper and crew went on a Sunday shooting excursion, and stalked the now defunct alli- gator. G. W. Thom, son of Mr. Geo. Thom, of the Moryborough Customs, offered to lasso the baby, which offer was finally accepted after some hesitation as to its danger. The lasso was got ready, so were the rifles, and young Thom set off with the noose, and a piece of hardwood 4 in. by 4 in. Hisalli gatorshlp was lying with his noso in the sand, and tho lasso could not bo applied, but he got up and WAS making for Thom, when the Utter threw the piece of hardwood at Min, which was crunched up ns easily in his formidable jaws as if it were Elijah Wiatson's Çiecrust After this, the aligator made for 'horn, who dcxtoromly jumped over the reptile's back, and fixed the noose over the head, the rope then being hauled tight by tho men, at the olher end. One shot was firod at the animal, which glaoed harmlessly over the scales, and that waa all that could be fired without risking Thorn's life. The alligator was safely secured, and towed dow» to the ship, and it was intended to bring him home aUvc, but he got so knocked about in a cale that ho gave up the ghost. It is intended to exhibit the alligator hore, at a charge of Is., the proceeds, after oxpenses are paid, to go to the Hospital. Both us an anodyne and expectorant, Ayer's Cherry Porterai is piompt in its action. It checks the advance of disease, allays all tendency to inflammation and consumption, and speedily restores health.-AIIVT.
