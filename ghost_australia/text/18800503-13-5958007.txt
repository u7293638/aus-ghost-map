Sufficient attention, perhaps, has not been paid to the taxation of the year 1879 and its results. A more significant lesson was never read to a colony, and it would be folly not to derive profit from the teaching. Tho taxation was ignorant, and the result was a disaster, and if we are to lose, and lose heavily, in money, at least we may gain in enlight- enment. In July, 1879, the Treasurer, it will be remembered, submitted esti- mates for new taxes to the amount of £250,000, and the whole of this sum he proposed to raise at the Customs by duties which should " extend protec " tion and raise revenue." There was a further proposition to increase the land tax by ¿£70,000, but as the land tax was not touched, this suggestion does not require consideration. The Oppo- sition at once pointed out the danger Mr. BERRY was running of over-taxing at the Customs-of endeavouring to draw too much from the one source and their persistence and logic so far won the day that customs dues to the amount of £70,000 per annum were withdrawn, and stamp taxes imposed instead. This change has been the salvation of the Treasurer. Whether or not it was necessary to impose the stamp tax is one question ; its success as an instrument of finance is another. The Opposition contended -and v>'9 'believe with truth-that if we had had careful instead of reck- less financial management, the stamp tax need never havo been proposed ; but if there was to be now taxation, then the Opposition leaders pointed out that tho stamp-tax would do its work, while, in all probability, the customs dues would not. And the event has shown who were the wise financiers. Tho stamp-tax has yielded at the rate of £140,000 per annum, and even if allow- ance is made for tho first laying in of stock, it maybe assumed that £120,000 to £130,000 can bo depended upon. But the customs dues were a miserable break down. They should yield £180,000 per annum. The returns for eight months of the year have been £20,248, that being the sum which has been received in excess of the amount obtained in the corresponding period of the previous year under the old tariff. The discrepancy is too enormous to bo accounted for by any one cause. No doubt some of it is to be attributed to hard times, which may havo caused a larger falling off at the Customs under the ordinary duties than was allowed for. A shrinkage in the value of goods will also directly affect tho ad vahrcm receipts. Inquirers anxious to arrive at the truth, and not seeking to servo any party, will by no means neglect these considerations; but still everyone must admit that there must havo been other and moro pewerful agencies at work, and these wo shall venture to indicate. What the fiasco appears to show with unmistakable clearness is, that we have arrived at the stage- when, according to Dean SWIFT, " two and two do not always make " four at the Customs, but sometimes " one." In other words, the taxes have be- come a check upon consumption. And, in the second place, ever gnawing at the vitals of the Treasury is the escape under the protective system of the tax- able articles which are made in the colony. It ia impossible to account for the difference between the estimate of £180,000 per annum and the receipts at the rate of £30,000 per annum, unless we presume both these "agencies to have been in active operation. And the curse of an excess of customs duties, or a bad policy there, is that the people suffer the evils of the taxation, though the Treasury remains empty. This was the circumstance which puzzled tho Collingwood and North Mel- bourne orators during tho recent electoral campaign, when thoy had the temerity to assoit that as tho receipts were small tho taxation could not bo regarded as oppressive. Yet it is the A B C of iinanco that there is often no surer sign of oppression than small receipts from heavy duties. For instance, the citizen pays 20s. for a given quantity of a certain article, 15s. being for tho goods and 5s. for duty. A new tariff raises the price from 20s. to 22s. Gd., and the Trea- surer's assumption is that the house- holder will buy the old quantity and pay the larger sum. If tho man is pros- perous, if taxation generally is fight, possibly Le will; but if lie is over- taxed, or if the article is taxed too highly, the householder is apt to con- fine his expenditure to the former 20s. He sends his pound-note to the store and buys as much as he can with the money. The Treasury will not gain anything like so much as it expected in that case; but it is idle to say that the man is not a sufferer because he has evaded the duty. His family run short of food or clothing, and to that extent they are clearly oppressed and ground down by the new taxation. So with the protec- tive principle. The new duty on the 15s. article previously sold duty paid for £1 may encourage a local maker to produce a rival article, which ho will sell for 22s. as against the new 22s. Gd. The householder buys the cheaper goods, and instead of 7s. Gd. going into the Treasury, nothing goes in, though it must be obvious to all that a tax of 7s. has been paid. If we admit for the sake of the argument (which we do not admit) that the local maker is benefited by the operation, still it must be confessed that there has been heavy new taxation without the Treasury having anything to show for it. Here, again, heavy taxation may go hand in hand with small receipts. The plain deduction from these facts and figures is that no further increase of customs duties is practicable. Mr. BERRY Hmsclf, though he might impose higher dues as a sacrifice to protection, would hesitate, we imagine, before en- deavouring again to raise any large revenue from this source. Our financiers, if they endeavour to raise more revenue, will apparently have little choice, but must turn to the excise and to direct taxation. And, more than that, we may reasonably infer that the tax- payers of Victoria can be materially relieved by lightening many customs dues, and substituting imposts in the other direction. The protective duties might be let alone. Attention might be given to the burdens which restrict consumption-which occasion hardship and do not produce revenue-and, with that understanding, protectionists might join with freetraders in the good work of promoting prosperity by re-adjusting the incidence of taxation. The report furnished to the Chief Secretary by the health officer at Queenscliff, with regard to the circum- stances attending the arrival of the Kent with passengers recently con- valescent after measles, goe3 some way to relieve Captain EIDGERS from the charge of having been guilty of whole- sale deception. Dr. WILLIAMS appears to have been informed of the fact that measles had existed on board throughout the voyage, the first case having pre- sented itself on the third day after starting, and the last being out of the doctor's hands only two days before the vessel entered the Heads. But while Captain EIDGERS must be acquitted of any attempt to deceive the authorities absolutely, further investiga- tions alone can show whether the repre- sentations made to them were not cal- culated to mislead. We are told that the ship's surgeon informed the health-officer that "the " eruption was of a very mild type," and that the " sick had been isolated as " far as possiblo on the main deck." The latter statement is a matter of fact which could easily be established or dis- proved by ordinary evidence. As to the former, we can only say that, looking at the subsequent consequences of con- tact with passengers or their belong- ings, there seems to have been veiy little "mildness" of any sort connected with the outbreak. Wo should not attach much importance to the nature of tho representations made by Captain I?IDG_:RS> and the surgeon to the health officer were it not that such pains were evidently taken to keep tho press in ignorance of what had really taken place. In a recent issue we gave our report of the information vouchsafed to us. Our reporter was told that "About " mid-voyago a stowaway and a steer " ago passenger had an attack of " measles. . . . Apart from this, " the general health of the passengers " was good." In order to make sure that there had been no mistake on the part of our representative, we have referred to the accounts given by our two morning contemporaries. One of these makes no mention of measles at all, while the other expressly declares that " good " health was enjoyed throughout, but " there were two deaths from consump " tion." When such au evident desire was exhibited to keep the pres3 in the dark, it is not unreasonable to suppose that the communications made to the autho- rities were not characterised by an excess of candour. It appears to us that Captain EIDGERS' failure to make known to the reporters the true state of affairs was an offence against the community. He is no stranger to this port, and must know that the public here has become accustomed to receive particulars of the voyages made to Hobson's Bay. Thoy naturally assume that masters who con- form to the custom of the place will supply full and correct information, and that when nothing is said about disease pr death in tho accounts given to the press, thoso misfortunes have been un- known. Our experience is that cap- tains aro ready enough to give par- ticulars * of even the most trivial inci- dents that redound to their own or their ships' credit, and it should not be too much to expect that they will not con- ceal tho truth even when the truth is un- pleasant. Had tho news been published abroad throughout Victoria that the measles had existed throughout, that a great many cases had occurred, that the last cases were only just convalescent on arriva), and that the ship had not been put into quarantine for the purpose of thorough disinfection, people would have been upon then guard, and m a position to decline communication with the new arrivals until they had undergone ê complete punfication Iho oppoitunity of exercising such caution, however, MIS denied them, owing to Giptun lilDcnts leticence, and wlnlo it is pos bible that he ivas tolerably open with the health ofheer, it is cortan that ho ivas culpably reseivcd towards tho public There is another point which re quires elucidation Captain IIIDGI RS and the ship s surgeon aro said to hive informed Dr WILLIVMS that "all " clothes and beddmg " belonging to patients "had either been thrown " overboard or disinfected " Now it appears to us that either the disinfecting operation as rogards pro perty retained was partially carried out, or else so negligently performed as to bo practically of no avail Take a case 'Iho health officer at Kyneton has re ported that after arrival a passenger named LATHLRA went with his family to visit his brother in law, who is teacher of the state school at Boggy Craik About ten days after their arrival at tho schoolhouse three of the teachers clnl dren were taken ill with measles Sub sequently the disease spread throughout the neighbourhood, and a lad who wis sent on a visit to his grandfather to be out of the way of infection carried the germs of it to Kyneton, where hesickened and communicated it to others Seeing, then, that Mr and Mrs LATHLRA bid no attack either before or after landing, that their children suffered no relapse it Boggy Creek, and that, according to Dr WILLI ISIS, the disease " had absolutely " expended itself," wo are led to inquire how the infection was carried to the state school alluded to Is there-can there be, any reasonable doubt, that it was com eyed in the clothes or other property transported thither 1 Such being the case it is evident that a very heavy responsibility rests on the ship b officers if it can be shown that the reported destruction and disia fection of clothes and bedding were not as complete and thorough as they myht have been We trust that when Captain EIDGEPS again makes his appoaranco in this port some sort of in\03ti cation will bo made, in order that MO may know whom to blame foi M hat is now a disastrous, and may yet prove a fatal, visitation But while we hold judgment in sus pense so far as Captain HIDGLRS LS con cerned, except as regards the impropei reticence shown towards the pre->s, wo regret to say that the proof of Dr WILLIAMS' want of discretion is too plain to justify hesitation in passing sen tence In Satuiday's paper an announce ment appears that in accordance M ítli instructions from the Chief Secietary all \essels that have had measles on board during the vojago will hereaftot " be detained at the Heads, until " the clothes and bedding " have been thoroughly disinfected in the " drjing house at the Sanitary Station, " and the vessel fumigated " That this is the common sense method of procedure in such cases is so apparent that Me cannot understand why it did not commend itself to Dr WILLIAMS We are as UHXIUUB U3 any one can bo that vessels visiting this port should be free from all unnecessary inconveniences, but a short detention m quarantine while the precautionary measures spoken of were taken could not bo objected to by any reasonable being TM o daj s, at the outside, would be sufficient, and what is two daj s to any ship compared with the Ines or health of the entue com munity? A vessel that had been the home for weeks of a succession of patients afflicted with measles, tlio last of whom was barely convalescent, must have been permeated m every direction by the germs of the disease The mere destruction or disinfection of articles belonging to those attacked e\ en if carried out most thoroughly and conscientiously-could not free it, and what it contained, from infection The clothes of all on board, together with every article of bedding and furniture on the poop and 'tween decies, were ex posed to the floating atoms thrown off by the patients, and consequently needed a thorough purification and cleansing We cannot avoid the con elusion that through a sad and un accountable error of judgment the Kail was allowed to proceed to Hobson s Bay in a state which rendered her a souice of danger to the public m a twofold way She was dangerous both as îe gaidswhat she took in and what sho put out Visitors w el o liable to catch the disease by ineiely breathing the au of the cabins, while the passengers and bargogo landed were simply materials for tho piopagation of disease Wo ti ust that the new regulation will eilte tually prevent the exhibition of auch mistaken leniency in dealing with in footed vessels in the future Wo haï o by no means hoard tho last, it seems, of tho scandal with regard to tlio O Loghlen Judicature Bill A lotuin ob taiiicd by tlio Legislative Councd in ISo \ ember last dra0t,ed into lij,ht tho fact that Mr M A M DONNELL was being heatily and constantly foo d by tlio then Attorney General to adapt tho British Judicature Act to colonial uso, although the act had boen ah cady adapted by the judges Naturally, tho transaction was a great deal commented on, because tal mg the opinion of tho profession is a whole-as tho piescnt Government havo dono by means of a Roj al Commission is ono thing, and requesting a single bamstci-by no moans a loadoi of tho bal-to roMow tho work of tho judges is nnothci But though members were irritated by what they learned at tint timo, the most extraordinary paifc of the affair had still to bo disclobed Iho £11)3 has been paid to Mr M A BI'Down. without doubt-tho receipts foi £20, £30, £40, and so on, aro in tho hw oihees , but thoro is no Judicature Bill Wo can imagino tho eagerness with which tho members of tho Judicature Commis sion would seek for a copy of tho measure, winch tho ex Attorney Gon / told the Assembly was ready for mtroduo tion, and which was to throw the judges bill entirely into tho shade, and wo can imagino also their natonishmont on learning that no trace of any aucli measure w as to bo found Thoro aro tradi tions m the offices, it sooms, of mysterious interview s between Sir BRYAN O LOOHIEV and his protégé, followod always by another cheque for Mr M'DONNELI, but noJudicatureBdlhasovorbeenseouthore There is a narrativo that a part of a bul a measure in an embryo shape-was sent to tho printers m 1878, but tho typo ot that bul was broken up, and usod tor tho judges' bdl passed by tho Legislativo Council in tho early part of tho session ot 1879, and tho typo was never wanted ana never asked for, though Sir BitviK O LOGHLEN was m oflico for sevon or cightmonths aftorwards Tho O'Loghlon M'Donnoll bill, in fact, has tauishod into thin air as completely is tho ha0*s in ' Macbeth,' and prolubly it is no groit loss Nevertheless, tlioro is no other in- stance on record of tho country piymg £403 for tho drafting of a bill, and being left without so much as a scrap of papnr -excopt tho MDonnoll autographs to show for tho oxpondituio And tho mj story thickeiiB when wo romombor that Su BiiYAr.

of the Geelong Teachers Union, was elected to the congress as representative of that body It was pointed ont that owing to the continued absence of the Bishop of Melbourne from the city the section was virtually unrepresented on the council of the congress, and it waa decided to request that body to add one of the vice- presidents to their number, in order to ensure the representation accorded

Saturday. The build- ing was opened at an early hour of the morning, but only a very few carts were to be seen in it. The Victoria Market has be- come the recognised market for the market- gardeners, and they evidently prefer it to the new market. The latter was occupied on Saturday as on previous Saturdays, by the retail vendors who have taken shops and stalls there, but few of the market gardeners made use of it The ballot for the election of the directors of the Australian Mutual Provident Society was held in Sydney last week.

The third of a series of lectures on minera- logy waa delivered on Saturday morning at the Technological Museum by Mr Cosmo Ncwberj, assisted by Mr. Rule, the attend- ance being exceedingly satisfactory. The lecture waB a highly interesting one.
