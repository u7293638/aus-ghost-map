It is five years and more since I saw him, and in the interval he has aged with more than ordinary capacity He is but 66 years of age yet is more wintry in appearance than many a man ten years in advance of him on the great journey. Always in stature and frame much under the average measurement, he now, grey, withered, and stooping, seems quite frail, as if a puff of wind would wait him away The noise, too has lost its history. Though never strong or resonant, it used to be in and melodious it is now made bank) by increasing infirmities A great hush comes over the congregation as he gives out the best there is something in the small figure, crowned with the black skull cap, and the classic feature, sash, yet placed with the content of a well spent The flux! fancy owes his leaders, and adds solemnity to -the opening words. Bending over the cushion and smoothing out his injured MR., teas it casually, remarks that he preached the same sermon from the same pulpit ten years ago, and would like to preach it " once more " I believe the thought crosses the minds of any who are thinking about the matter at all not excluding the venerable Dean himself, that ' once more' might probable be prophetic Ihostriion is not brilliant, in the general acceptation of the term it is not adorned with 'lovely OL rhetoric, or ill lined i by even a ol oratory but it is in its sir p'o goodness j ind fithnly pur nastiness, better than rhetoric and more effective than oratory.

'The text to-day is the historical last words of the founder of Christianity,-" Into Thy hands I commend my Spirit." The sermon does not breathe a breath of doctrine, but we have interspersed with the rest room warp and west, references to Polycarp, Augustine, Bernard, Columbus (who in his dying moments repeated the same words), Xavier, Melancthon, Luther, Bouvet, and glimpses of that modern progress and method which illustrate the onward tramp of science. We have in a brief sermon or not more than twenty minutes the glories of the world of to day brought by A graphic touches before us, and are sent away with the ka on that if in the triumph of intellect and the flush of prosperity we can simply finish our course with the humble petition used in his extremity by a Greater than we we shall have lived, and laboured, and learned not in I vain For a man who has written and published so much, who is a scholar amongst scholars, it's in truth a very simple discourse, but singularly simple sue. The congre . g tion is mostly composed of strangers. Doubtless. it includes believers and unbelievers of every grade, but so long as the preacher preaches, not a sound but his vo co is ha d. The Dean wears the scarlet collar and gold pendant of the order given him by the Queen. It reminds me of the charge often brought against him that he is a courtier-->f that the charge, that he is a popularity hunter I know not, not care, how far the charges are founded on fact li it well known that the Queen over admired the man, and that Lady Augusta Stanley, the wife whose loss basso rapidly brought the signs of age upon him-was one of the favourite ladies of the royal household It may, be that her Majesty his sought the Dean, and not the Dean her Majesty In which tate the change does not attend It must here Herbert!, moreover, that the charges are brought by men u to write d to see in the Dean s loiiludinnrianism the plague-spot of what they call here y. In their mine" the Church dignitary who attends Non conforms to college native's, who allows Hit Mullet to leave in the Abbey, who goes down to Bedford and dear r3 a speech at the unveiling of John Bunyan's face, is a dangerous traitor to their institution Hence, while Arthur Penrhyn Stanley is a hero to Low Church and Broad. and to those vast denominations that manage to get saved outside the pale of an Established Church, he is a rock of offence to ultra Chun hmen. And be it dauntless amidst an. In convocation ho sofa poor old Archdeacon Dennison's light on end, and is sometimes to the traditions he m heard from his father, and the Arnold school, Standing alone faithful amongst the faithless. And he has been consistent in his efforts to popularise the services of the, Abbey. Out of this comes that s come accusation of popularity hunting. His book on Westminster Abbey (like the kindred work on Canterbury shows what love and veneration To nourishes for the ancient edifice, whose every stone he has studied and ii i" e dearly this feeling which tempts 'us to fill it with memorials of the illustrious dead At the conclusion of to-day's service, the greater part of the congregation distribute about the Abbey to read the 'n scriptions casing of the resting place of famous men who have passed 100 within our own remembrance. In the case of the) Prince Imperial, it is not to be denied that the Dean made the mistake of running counter to the general wishes of the public, but it is scarcely a secret that, in that business, Court pressure of a heavy character was brought to bear upon him. the best of men are liable to err, and this was an error. At the time of Carlyle's death, it was stated, and repeated by unfriendly tongues with much glee, that the Chelsea philosopher on his dying bed growled, " For Heaven's sake, save me from the body snatcher, Dean Stanley." It is not probable that there would be a large amount of sympathy between the two men, and the story on the face of it is characteristic But I am assured, on what should be good authority, that it is one of those amusing fictions invented to raise a passing laugh, and circulated until it acquires the stamp of respectable veracity. Not that it matters Dean Stanley, I venture to believe having recognised his course of action to his conscience, would be little moved by the sneers and attacks of men from whom in the very nature of things he could not expect sympathy. And, as a Christian unattached, I, like thousands of others, would not object if we had a few more body-snatchers of the same description. _ ' * BETA. I
