The Quamby Stakes brought: jont some good puppies, and introduced ; us .to the firat of iFraser's stock, and judg ing from the specimens the Auatralian ; Cup winner promises to have a good stud career; One of- his. -.representa- tives, Magpie, however, unfortunately met with a severe acoident' -.thrpngli staking herself in the. neck, which was annoying, as she shaped . in good style. Dacoma, ;another new sire, : had Play ful to represent him, and though ahe was beaten in the firat ties, it was mainly owing to :an accident. Ben, a son of. Sedan, ; was represented by a couple, but one was beaten in the first found, and the other in the firat ties. All-aged Stakes. — Picanini in the open ing course of the day had all the best of. Swiveller after a very short trial and^a weak hare; Fairy and Reata ran an un7: decided,1 and; the former- killed, but in the1 final trial, Fairy,' after leading to- the. fence, refused to jump, and allowed her opponent to score the victory. Sheelah got the lead .up through -the hare favour ing' heri' when, several exchanges- ensued, and &? capital course ended in favour of Sea Wave by just a trifle only. Lady, in' no condition', was not the slightest -use to Princess Royal in a lengthy course, asshe got possession onceohly by favour, whilethe other put in some good 'work; and killed. Q.iilp.had the foot of Banner to the hare, and shaping ' ' iin; ' good' style, wound up' a satisfactory course by a kill, a handsome' winner. Lena had all the best1 of1 the trial with her sister. Amethystin the early part of the course,, but going a purler ;nearing the fence, her antagonist; served' by the catastrophe, -set merrily to work-in the other paddock, and riibbed'ithei' points- out.' Nydie was several lengths 'faster for. the turn than GrandiDuches'sj-who seemed slow in goinij out; o£- the' 'slips,' arid the former scored several more points before Grand Dnchess wasi placed; ' The latter, however, ;came gamely, towards the- finish; and put in some good work ; but her: opponent had too much. to;.the)'good wben the hare was lost. Hilda in a1 .very short race to- the hare ;had' a slight, advantage of Blink Bonny, - who . was ' momentarily placed ?; but Hilda quickly wrenched, and finished a brief andi rather unsatisfactory trial by a kill, the hare having 'injured himseif after Hilda made the first turn: ?n', First Ties.— ;Picanini led up and turned, when, Reata afterwards had all the;best of -tKe course— a Bhort one—and ended' a ; winner. tri 'another' short course Princess 'Royal scored first turn, buti'her'ppppnent, Sea Wave, ;gave' her little chance 'henceforth,' and wh'en she tilled'.there' was no doubt of ? 'tne reault'. After an undecided Quilp raced in rare style from : the slips, but' turning wide let ^.methyst . in.' The veteran, however, came a»ain3 and, though his opponent scored , in' creditable style, Quilp, who jumped grandly, gave her . little chance afterwards, , as when Amethyst raced away; in possession the course had ter minated. . r \ After an undecided, Hilda', going in much better style than she did in' her ., opening course, led Nydie to the hare and won nearly' all the way, hee opponent only, scoring a couple of points. Quamby Pu#ppy Stakes. — Playful never gave Fancy Girl the slightest chance, arid terminated a lengthy and satisfactory trial with a 'kill.. .Frenchman .in. .the next course had'' much the' best of the 'trial, when lie' ref uaed' to fence,', and Riverina shortly afterwards,' brought the course to a cpnclnsioni by a kill. Fancy Lady raced some' se veii; or : eight lengths in \ front of Bonnie, Blink, and'scored a couple of turns before 'the' pother got possession. The latter'^ h'6wever,'set to work-in, a merry manner, and, shaping Jin c'apitarstylei and hardly; giving her opponent a chance, she ' must , have all : but equalised matters,1, when the flag went up for Fanoy Lady. Bertha; was quicker' away than Alva Belle, and always going the smarter ?yv'ould have, won a good trial .all ;the ; way, butfprthe'lat'ter'making the kill. , .'.After a no go SeaShipre led yaga'bon'd for, the turn, when 'the' other got placed, ;but the brue'.came' again and, finished a short course by a kill. Magpie 'was length's faster than Mizpah, who was amiss ',[ and rie'ver had the ghost of a, chance with; the winner, who travelled in' rare .style, ;'brut ^ unfortunately .staked herself. Owing to '.

'The opening meet . of the ; season was ibrought'to a conclusion on Wednesday at Quamby, wheri there ,. was, :'a' fair atten dance, and'the. weather even warmer than I the previous day. Thesportwas not'iip to Tuesday'si standard, [[ but- this was !mainly owing 'to the fact of two hours :having boon wasted in 'Sariis's paddock. This spot has invariably been productive of poor sportj and Wednesday was no ex ception to the' rule.-. As1 a result it was' : half -past one- before the six courses requi site to finish the stake were decided, and after all four had to be run off on Quamby proper. The AH- Aged ?' Stake was won by Sea Wave, wlib defeated the celebrated 'Hilda in the final. The .winner is a good dog, even though she had a bit of luck in haying such a short course with Reata f while her owner deserves a turn, a.s he has been a good supporter of coursing; but has met with little success 'up to ' the ? present. Sea shore 'was bred by Mvi Charles Field, and this is her first appearance. '' She is by Jack, a son of Wellington, while her dam. Myrtle, 'comes direct' from im ported stock 'selected in England for Mr. Thos. Barrett,' her 'breeder;'' Hilda for the fourth time only in her career had to own her defeat, ; and the slut is such a popular favourite that her downfall created regret.1 -While admitting that she has lost some of her brilliancy, her opponent mether. atari'advantage yester day, and the question 6f superiority can' be hardly !'be considered' settled. In the Puppy Stakes the stock of Fraser swept the- board, as -both' the- first and second dogs were sons of his. This is an excellent advertisement for the dog, and a capital-corhmehcemerit of 'his: stud career. With the Cacique— Cashier'and th'efamous Bab at the Bo water blood, Fraser' s breed ing is riot to be surpassed'.' Macgregor, the winner, is a fourteen ! months puppy, and was, bred ty Mr.1 James Gibson, jun. As said before, ' he is -a son1 of Fraser, while his mother ? is by '' Speed out of Musidora by Celerity, Mr. G. Hope, how ever, canclaim some'of ;the'h'onours, as in addition to '? being 'part owner of Fraser, he bred the mother pf -the wirinerl'Macgregor ran a real game'andgood'dog throughout, arid thiswell shaped ' son ' of Fraser pro mises to 'see even' a better1 day. He is the property of a gentleman a recent addition- to ' pur--1.1*'1 'coursing ranks. His victory3 was J- inorepver acceptable from the fact of a promising representa tive, Magpie having staked; herself the previous day. Both M'Gregor and Magpie were trained by Mr. Alex; iVI'Bain, jun., of the College Farm, Bishopsboiirne, and he is to be congratulated ? 'upon 'his success. The runner-up,' ?Frenchman, is own brother to the winner,'and is another good sort. Mr. Ernest Gatenby, the judge, got through his work in his usual satisfactory style, and once more we have to repeat the Club is fortunate indeed in securing the honorary services of a gentleman so thoroughly: competent' as Mr. Gatenby. William Dadson was -at his old post, and slipped ???well throughout the meeting. Mr: Falkiner. at -the ter mination of the proceedings, on behalf of the Club, in a neat speech, referred' to Mr. - Sadlier's kindness in ' furthering the ? in terests of the Club, and called11 for three cheers for ? that geritlerrian, which were heartily given. Mr. Sadlier in'acknow ledging the, compliment, said hewould do ; all he could to preserve'thio hares for thej Club;' He never shot any himsplf, but he had great trouble : in preventing 'others^ while he was bothered with' ' applications to course. In order to -better preserve the game, he suggested that- the Club should appoint a day for people , to try; their dogs;; Mr. Sadleir's suggestion was universally' approved of -as a step in 'the- right direction. ' Cheers were then called for the judge and the 'slipper, and thus germinated the iriost: successful coursing meetings ever h' eld in ; Tasmania. '; ?''' ? ; All Aged .

The latter soon set to work in a meritorious manner, and when the flag went up for Frenchman there was not a great deal to choO3e between them. In a splendid trial Fancy Lady led M'Gregor at the start, but the latter, going with great determination, raced past her, and was all there for a lot of good work, and won a long and gruelling course all the way, defeating his adversary pointless, a3 though the loser eventually finished up with a kill, the course was over. Final. — M'Gregor, notwithstanding his previous grueller, led Frenchman to the haro, and though the latter camo at the end, M'Gregor finished up a winner with something to spare. Coursing Club. — A meeting of the members of the Northern Tasmnnian Coursing Club will be held at the Criterion Hotel on Saturday, at 3 '30 p.m. , when the stakes will be paid over to the owners of successful dogs at the late meet at Quamby.
