PRAYER FOR RAIN. TO THE EDITOR OF THE ARGUS. Sir-When out Lord declared that till heaven and earth pass away, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise PUBS away from the law till all things be accomplished (Matt v , 18), he meant the law generally, and not specifically as the law of Moses This must be true from our Lord 's own words in Matt xi 13, 'For all the prophets and the law' prophesied until John" This is still more clear from the parallel passage in St Luke xvi 19), "The law and the prophets were until John. From that time the gospel of the kingdom of God is preached, and every man entereth violently into it. But it is easier for heaven and earth to pass away than for one tittle of the law to fall ' Now, what law must this be which cannot fall' The law of Moses, which he had come not to destroy but to perfect, had given way to the gospel of the kindest, and had been abrogated by being perfected and fulfilled Hence the promise could not apply to it, and therefore we pass from the generic use of the word law to the specific law of Christ, which had superseded the law of Moses, and which was never to fail If his lordship will read a Rapide further down, in loco estate, he will see this, and he will bud the learned exegetical quoting another strom; text in couDrination, " Heaven and earth shall pass away, but my words shall not pass away " (Matt was 35 ) And in this interpretation a Rapide IS followed by Maldonatus, Menochui, and the Catholic commentators generally, all of whom followed St Thomas who, in his turn, quotes Ireneus, Chrysostom, AUgustus, Athanasius, c (ace Maldon item on the text) May I remind the bishop. that I did not quote, but replied to the instance of the 1 lunatic of Hanover square, and in this reply I did not give my own judgment, but the sacred Scripture to justify prayer for rain That scientific men cannot understand how God can overrule the order of nature, I can not help, but that they know more truth than God himself, who has created nature, or than the Holy Ghost who inspired St. Paul, seems to me a very hazardous speculation When his lordship told me what he meant when he praised, I took exception to his narrow conception of power, that it was only eucharistic or ifaunlcstmn-, and not in tfitise area by me from Matt / "How much more shall your Heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to them that ask Him " (Luke xi 13 ) There fore then, we shall obtain even the Holy Spirit by asking Him And if we shall not ask we may not receive , "Hitherto have ye asked nothing in My name , ask:, and ye shall receive that your joy may be fulfilled ' (John xvi, 2-1) It is quite true that the Holy Spirit IS promised to those who ask Him ; but surely there is not in the text an authoritative interpretation of what the good things mean, and much less is there a limitation of them to " spiritual things to the Holy Spirit with all His blessed fruits of love, joy, peace etc The very form of the phrase contradicts this " How much more " implies only greater willingness on the part of God to grant this gift than any other It is quite true that the Holy Spirit contains all gifts and graces, virtually and eminently, as theologians speak, but not materially and quantitatively If every gift of God is only spiritual, what becomes of " the daily bread ' And if the Holy Spirit by HIS presence in parts everything else, why then pray for any thing else' in that men may think or say about the end ency of prayer certainly does not invalidate the words of Scripture or destroy its effect If people will not have patience with God when He withholds HIS favours, they remind one of Xerxes lashing the Hellespont to allay the storm That people would have understood i his lordship to expect God to grant an ' out of the order of nature is assuming the principal point of the whole case Most people, nearly everybody, would have believed it to be the merciful exercise of a beneficent power, which is BO regulated and so ordained as to include all such contingencies in its apparent variations Doctor Moorhouse would exclude " such passages as belong to the miraculous cycle of the New Testament " Now, what authority has he for doing this' There is no warrant for it in the inspired book itself If the cycle has a limited circumference, where or when is the limit! Are we not told in the sacred volume that even at the end of time, when Antichrist shall come, he shall perform such signs and wonders as to deceive, if possible, even the elect Shall not the false prophets plead at the last day that they have cast out devils, and prophesied and done many mighty works in God's name. And if they, being evil, know how to give good gifts, how much more shall our Father who is in heaven " give good things to those who ask him (Matt vi , 11 ). If his lord ship " believes in the possibility of variation from the natural order, I presume Almighty God knows best when and how these variations may properly occur. I regret that the good bishop thought it necessary to complain-very gently indeed of abusive insinuations. They were intended not as abusive, but suggestive, not as de- clamatory, but deprecatory. As to my motives, I must leave these to each one's individual judgment, mindful of the truism will excuse, s accuse Yours, sec, P. J. SLATTERY St. Mary's, Geelong, April 3, 1882
