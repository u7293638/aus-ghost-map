There was nor a word in the Vice Regal speech at the opening of Parlia ment, about the desirability of modi jjh fying the existing law of libel, although there aie few if any legislative griev ances which have a stronger claim to early consideration Moderate and intelligent men, the world over, are igreed that this law as it exists in most of the older countries, and many of the new, is in need of ladical amendment, not only on behalf of those who incur its penalties, but also in the mtei est of the public at large There is a common idea that the law of libel reaches only those who knowingly and delibeiately utter or publish falsehood and slander to the mjuiy of otheis, that for speech or writing to be libellous it must bo both untrue and malicious The prevalence of this idea is not particulaily remark able, even among those who should be better informed There is in every community’- a percentage of people who, for reasons of then own, aie av eise to any modification of the pre sent baibarous law Such people would fostei rather than remove a be lief in justice and equity Then the proceedings in libel cases pleadings, summing up, judgment and all, are usually' so obscuied by technical phraseology that ordinary people are not encouiaged to tiy to understand them Legislative assemblies do not bcstn themselves to improve the law, and will never do so unless at a direct mandate from the public The object of the promoters of amendment in the libel acts is roughly conceived to be the attainment of a concession in the in terest of uewspapei propuetors This is pai tly true, but not all the truth, noi the most important part of it The public aie far more interested in ob taming a tevision of the libel laws, because the newspaper piopnetor should, and genet ally does, keep out of its clutches But this circumspection is the means of keeping the public in ignorance of many things which they ought to know The libel law of Great Britain and of the United States is less oppiessive and unjust than oui ow u, but the statutes which exist in those counti les are so mani festly unjust in their operation that lenewed effoits are being made to pass an amending bill. In the British Par liament Sir Algernon Borthwick is endeavoring, w ith the aid of his fellow membeis, Mr Jno Morley, Di Came hon, Mi Jennings, Mr Lawson, and Sir Albert Rollit to secute the passing of a short act to remove some of the more guevous inequities of the existing law. But, in Britain at least, no action for libel will he against the proprietor of a newspaper foi the publication of a fan and full repoit of a public meet ing, even though some of the utter ances may come within the penal pro visions of the libel act®, unless there is evidence of malicious intent. It is by no means to the credit of out legis lators that, in this presumably fiee colony, a report of a meeting, accuiately taken and published in perfect good faith, may be made the basis of a libel action in which the innocent publisher may become mulcted in a heavy fine, and be sent to gaol in the bargain The aggrieved pirty may, at his option, sue eithei the original author of the libel lous matter oi the propnetoi of the newspiper which innocently published it in the discharge of his ordinary obligation to his readers But it hap pens pi etty fi equently that the first v en dor of the libel is not worth powder and shot, and the newspiper propnetor is, and uiih tppily there are black sheep m the shape of attorneys who will eageily grasp at a peifectly innocent bieich of the libel law, and instigate a prosecution for the sake of the fees which they may exact fiom one party 01 fiom both Theie aie some alleged defects in our libel acts which Sir Algernon Borthwick does not pio pose to deal with For example, a man may hold a position, as to which purity of personal character, and integrity of puipose aie necessaiy conditions, but the man may at the same time be well known to be a secret drunkard, a debauchee, and, in the broad" sense of the term a scoundrel. It is manifestly to the interest of society that be should he unmasked, hut in effect he is absolutely protected by statutes which were devised to prevent the dissemination of malicious false hood and slander There are very seuous contingencies which, in the interest of decent members of society, have to he carefully weighed in connection with any proposal to re lax the libel lan in this direc tion What Sir Algernon Bortu wick’s bill proposes to do is this Fust, to provide that any news paper owner, publishing fair and honest reports of public meetings shall be liable to fine only, instead of fine and imprisonment, if they afterwards are indicted as libellous Secondly, that where the authoi of a libel is known, say in the case of a speaker at a public meeting, he shall be held to answer foi his libel instead of an innocent publisher Thiidly, that where, as may easily happen, the alleged libellous matter is repeated in a dozen diffeient newspapers, the proprietors of all these may join common issue in their own defence, and fourthly that where damages have once been reco vered in respect to any alleged libel lous matter, the fact may be pleaded in mitigation of damages claimed in any subsequent action. Says Sir Alger non Borthwick —“ B} a mistake of a subordinate every now and then a libel is bound to creep into a paper We are sorry for it, and decent people will accept an apology made in the proper spirit But theie are otheis, small_ attorneys'and scheming individuals, who victimise the news papers, and merely look upon a libel as a good chance for them to make money > It is against these unscrupu lous people that we are bound to de fend ourselves.” How long, we wonder, shall we have to wait befoie similar legislation is introduced into Victoria 1 This is a matter wherein newspapeis aie entitled to a share of the natuial policy of protection, not in the form of bonuses 01 import duties, but against inequitable and often malicious legal pei secu tion The proceedings at the meeting of the “country party” on Thursday scarcely prove the right of those gentlemen to the title they have assumed. They would have done better to have dubbed themselves the Stock tax party, inasmuch as they represent the believers in this obnoxious; tax, but most certainly they do not repre sent the countiy at large. If these members had contehted themsehes with a general allegation that the farmer does not get his share of the benefits of a protective policy, and chat some means should be devised of putting him on an equal footing with those who engage in protected in dustries, their claims would, no doubt, receive full and favorable considera tion Instead, however, of a general demand for iclief, the so called countiy paity insist on this relief taking one specified form, a form, be it remem bered, to which there are the grav est political objections, and which a large majority of the constituencies most de cidedly condemned at tiie late elec tions It is alleged that the 23 gentlemen who were present at the meeting were, each and several, pledged to their constituents to, agi tate foi an increased Stock tax We did not undei stand that Messrs Trenwitii and Carter were so pledged, and we hardly see how either of these cm faulv be included in a “countiy” party. It was further stated that 38 members of the Assembly aie in favor of the projected increase, but this re quires further confitmation. In any case the Stock tax party cannot deny that the country was asked for an explicit vote on the question, and chat the -vote was almost over whelmingly against the increase It is now suggested that the issue was not fanly placed before the constituencies, which means, we sup pose, that the voteis at large re fused to view the arguments in favor of a tariff war in the same light as the leading spirits of the Stock tax party legarded them. We may point out that if this doctrine he accepted, there will be no finality in an appeal to the people, and hon. members will be jus tified in combining to foim a nohey which may be not only unauthorised by the constituencies, but also ex ceedingly mischievous All that would be wanted would be a combiua tion of a small party foimally resolv ing that the verdict of the elec tions must be set aside as the case was imperfectly laid before them In othei words, hon. members, having seemed theii election on certain ex pressed or understood principles, may foithwith constitute themselv ea a court of appeal for any clamorous political faction, and, if they choose, disallow all Hie principles which they are sup posed to represent and uphold. The country will not submit to such action no matter how cleverly it may bo ex cused Advantage was taken tif the presence in Ballarat jeatenUy of Mr Rennick, an engineer of the Railway Department, to bring umlcr his notice two public require ments Messrs Smith and Russell, M’s L A , urged upon him the necessity of providing for the continuation of Grenville street uoi thvvards by tunnelling thmugli th" rail way embankment Mr Rcnmck promised to recommend that an officer be sent up to report upon what relief would be afforded to tiaffic by the tunnel. From there Mr Ren nick wait to the Peelstieet bridge, where it was urged th it the width of the bridge could be enlarged with advantage. Tn e original plan provided for a width ot 40 feet, but revised plans have been prepared allow ing a width of 50 feet Mr Russell, how ever, strongly urged that it should he made the full vv idth of the road— ibout CO feet— and that nothing less would satisfy the icsideiits Mr Remnok promised that the revised plans should be sent to the lowu Council by tne beginning of next week. An extraordinary meeting of shareholders of the Ballarat Woollen Comp my was held yesterday afternoon at the Alfred Hall, for the purpose of receiving a report regarding the floating of the new issue of shares, with the object of wiping off the liabilities of the company. Mr 'lhomas, on behalf of the committee of shareholders appointed, re p irted that of the 68 000 shares required to be got off onlj 29,000 hud been taken up It was nec sh ires off, or the company woull be in as bid a position as previously. A proposal was submitted to the shareholders to make the new issue preferential, so that nuy divi dends declared would be payable to the amount of tile first 5s only on the new shares, and after that on the whole of the shaies in thy company; and also that in the event of the company being wound up any money left as a surplus should be distributed firit to the holders of the new shares The ptoposal was informally discussed by the meeting, and a motion in favor of it was earned It will be necessary, however, that a special meeting be held shortly to specially consider the matter. A report of yesterday's meeting appears in another column. * Many in Bsllarat and district will regiet to learn of the death of Mr David Christy, the genial mining registrar.
