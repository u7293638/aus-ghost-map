? THEIV.R.C. WINTER STEEPLECHASE MEETING. Melbourne, Saturday, July 23. [By Telegraph.] The first Grand National Steeplechase meeting of the V.R.O. to-day was a most pronounced success, over 12,000 being present on Flemington Course. The racing was. good, and the day beautifully fine, His Excellency the Marquis of Normanby and Lord Charles Scott being among the visitors, of whom a large proportion were ladies. The Stand was quite full, and Mr. Byron Moore, Honorary Secretary, was warmly congratulated on the success of his first meeting. All through the sport was of a very highclass character, the finish in nearly all the events being close and exciting. The bookmakers lost very heavily, as the favourites won in almost all the races, and a large number of double and treble events were pulled off by the public. One feature of the day was the great success of Corrigan, who won the first three events and was second for the fourth. Panic, as the sire of four of the winners, fully maintained the high character which he has so long borne. Everything passed off most satisfactorily, tbe only casualty being that of Barlow, who was thrown in the Selling Hurdle while riding Monitor. A dog rushed out, which caused Monitor to swerve off, and Btrlow fell, sustaining a compound fracture of the leg. After tbat race the winner—President —was sold for £310, out of which the Club received £280.
