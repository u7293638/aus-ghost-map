LAST MOMENTS OF CAPTAIN GIFFARD. THE Keutz Zeitung gives the following des- cription of the last moments and burial of poor Captain Giffard, under the head of Lower Danube, June 12 "How Russia honours her enemies.- We have received (that is, the person who wrote the day before yesterday from the Lower Danube) interesting dates from Odessa, of the 2nd June. On that day, at 3 p.m., the interment of Captain Gifford, of the Tiger, took place. By order of General Osten- Sacken, the whole crew, prisoners of war, as well as the Governor-General Annemkoff, with the other military authorities, attended the funeral. A Russian battalion in parade order formed an escort to the coffin, and fired the usual volleys over the grave. Nearly the whole population was afoot, and followed the procession. The sturdy General Osten-Sacken took the deepest interest in the fate of the captain during his illness. A little before his death, Giffard called the crew around his bed, and said, ' Lads, you owe your lives to my being wounded; this hindered me from blowing up the ship. Farewell! Greet our dear England for me when you see it.' After these words he asked for a glass of lemonade, turned his face from his sailors to the other side, and gave up the ghost. Thus Russia knows how to esteem merit, even in its .enemies."
