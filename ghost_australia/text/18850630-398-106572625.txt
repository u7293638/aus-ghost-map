Said he : " As soon as I feel weak and exhausted from long night sessions and meals at irregular hours, I resort to my Hop Bitters instead of stimulants. They regulate my bowels^ and keep my appetite good, my brain clear, and my strength and health are preserved." See* There is a new game in Paris. Tired of all old and threadbare aniusemeuts an actress inaugurated a "Polymorphous fete." The ballroom was turned into a funeral chamber, and people all came dressed as ghosts, hob goblins, or phantoms. Coffins were placed about the room, around which these cheerful individuals played hide-and-seek, puss in the corner, and similar games. A supper was afterwards served on a table composed of coffins piled one on the other. There is something awfully cheerful about this kind of eport.
