WILLIAMSTOWN RACES. TIIE Easter Meeting of the \Williamstown Racing Club took place on Easter Monday, and proved very successful. The weather was delightful, and the racing up to the averags in point of interest-a combination of circumstances that satisfied both the club and its patrons. In the Hurdle Race Mool. gal repeated his Elsternwick Park perform. ance of Saturday, by lying in a good position all the way, cutting down the leaders at the home turn, and winning in a canter from Plaudit and Rocket, the other placed horses. The Forsaken, who was backed down to 7 to 4, beat a field of nine in the Maiden Race, though the verdict might have been reversed had the boy on Kitty Fisher not been blocked in attempting to get up on the inside. Chro. nograph was second, and Kitty Fisher third. Julian Grey, on his Moonee Valley running of a fortnight ago, was made the favorite for the Altona Handicap, but Achmet coming with a well-timed sun at the end of the lawn beat both St. Michael and Juliau Grey, who occupied the other places. Stafford won the Selling Race, from Sorcerer and Bar One, and his owner had to pay £195 to keep him, all of which goes to the club's exchequer. Four started for the Steeplechase. Sham rock fell, and after the semblance of a race at the last fence between Marquis of Water ford and Tandaticker, the favorite, the for. mer won in a canter. Holman received a severe shaking, hut was able with assistance to walk to the jtckeya' room. The last race of the day hal a tiell of 11, for which Wil. liam Tell was installed the public choice. \Vhen they were fairly going Kitty Fisher rushed to the front, and remained there to the end of the j turney. SJrcerer made a great attempt to get up, and just reached the mare's neck as they paossed the post. Wil* liam Tell, the favorite, was third. HIURDLE RACE, Of 70 sova., 8eceod 10 sors.
