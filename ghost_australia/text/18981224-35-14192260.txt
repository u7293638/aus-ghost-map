THE BISHOP OF li ATTI RMS T AND THE CHURCH OF XNQZAXV. TO THE EDITOR OF THE HERALD. SIR-In common with a large number of your readers I have been looking for Borne episcopal reply to the asper- sions cast on the Anglican Church by Cardinal Moran as recorded in your issue of Monday last Up to the time of writing this letter I have not discovered any, and therefore am for the third time taking up the defence of the Church, for to one who loves and revered his Church silence in such a case appears to be almost criminal Had any other person than the Cardinal made such charges they might have been left un- noticed, but when promulgated by the bend of the Roman Church they assume an official character I notice at once that the Cardinal's special friend, Henry VUI, takes his usual prominent position It would appear as if his ghost haunted the Cardinal whenever he made any reference to the Anglican Church, and caused him on the occasion to put a question which he acknowledges to he " absurd," and to which he gives a still more remarkable reply when he says that the Church of England " derived its authority from Henry VIII, who licensed the bishops to teach, the real fact being that the Church of England remained the same Church, minus Ulfa Pope and certain doctrines and practices of Home. Elie reformed herself through her w n Com vocation and as Fuller, the well known historian, remarks, " Nothing was done in the reformation of religion save what was acted by the clergy in their convocations, or, grounded' upon some act of theirs precedent to it, with the advice counsel, and consent of these bishops and most eminent churchmen, continued on the post fact, and not other wise, by the civil sanction according to the usage of the best and happiest times of Christianity ' so much for the Cardinal a new history about the bishops and his friend King Henry VIII, which must be relegated to the region of fable and romance The next part of his attack begins with an assertion that there are persons in high positions in the Church of England who are unsound in the faith, and hence that the Anglican Church had departed from Holy Church, and hall an apostolic authority " I am not concerned to deal with the answers tion at present, but in his haste to arrive at a conclusion injurious to the Church of England he has, unfortunately for him, got hold of a most dangerous two edged weapon, for surely he must know something of the history of his own Church, and if so cannot be unaware of what is. Hippolytus, who, according to Dr Newman, was eminent as a theologian, said about Pojm Callistus, calling him a distrust co of Church discipline and " hercal arch ex cathedral" The same writer had a good deal to SMJ about Zepb) nnua also Butevenif we allow that to pass and accept a modern explanation of it, there can be no question about the fall or Pope 1 bends and his yielding to the Amana, treating the questions about our bay hour's person as matters regarding which opinions might be held without necessitating any breach of communion. Then there is Pope Zosimus, who only escaped the stigma of heresy on the Pelagian question through the firmness of the African bishops Pope Honorius, too, condemned not merely by the Council, hut by Pope Leo li, who thus writes -" Hononus, who did not illuminate this ApotM tolic Seo with the doctrine of apostolic tradition, but permitted her who was unsettled to be polluted by profane teaching '' 'These are all historical facts regarding the Popes. Rome ; if, therefore, the Church of England is to be cast out from her true position as a branch of Christ's Holy Church because there are we have only the Cardinal's word for it-certain persons in high positions untrue to the Catholic faith what shall we say for the Church of Rome, which, if the Cardinal's argument is valid, must long ago have lost its apostolic authority from having such un- orthodox popes as those named 1 Regarding the Cardinals sneer at the Lambeth Conference, 1 can nowhere find the expression he makes use of in its authoritative documents, but, even if this were so, it was as one of those present said, " distinctly a conference for the free interchange of thought and opinion It was in the region of moral and spiritual influence that its great strength lay, and none but those who had taken part in these meetings, could tell how helpful that influence was At the conclusion of his address the Cardinal his accidentally stumbled upon a, great truth regarding which I am in full agreement with him when he says " The Anglican Church from its very origin rejected the authority of St Peter " By the authority of St Peter 'A I presume he means the authority of the Pope, although what the Pope has really to do with St Peter more than other portions! of the Catholic Church have I am at a loss, to discover, seeing that it is exceedingly difficult to prove that at Peter ever was at Rome, and still more so that he has ever Bishop of Rome As a well-known writer remarks "It is towards the end of the second century when the time of Roman Bishop, comes into clearer historical light that we begin to discern dimly the first beginnings of the claim to be successors of S Peter." AVIulst a bishop of the Anglican Church, well known for his " rich learning," which I am glad the Cardinal recognises, saT, " The Inter Roman theory supposes that the Church of Rome derives its authority from the Bishop of Rome as the successor of S Peter. History inverts this relation and shorn that the power of the Bishop of Rome was built upon the power the Church of Home ' 'taking, however, the Cardinal's expression the " authority of S Peter " to mean the authority of the Pope of Rome, we have only to look into the history of the Church of England through long centuries the Cardinal and I together carefully examined that some years ago and see how, in spite of ot most strenuous efforts made by the Popes of Rome constantly, to bring England fully under the power of Rome, kings, archbishops and bishops, priests, and Parliament as constantly resisted this until at last, under God's good providence, this resistance culminated in the Reformation, the final act of a long struggle, and the Church of England emerged from the conflict purified, strengthened, and invigorated for her work in the ages to come, holding as firmly as ever she did to the Catholic truth as expounded in the three great creeds, having " reformed herself because she loved what was old, and did not loco what was new ' I am sorry that the Cardinal has chosen this particular season of the year, when peace and goodwill should prevail, for his attack upon the Church of England, so utterly uncalled for and an entirely unprovoked, but of this I am confident, that if he would only act upon the advice I gave him at the conclusion of our last controversy, It would be the better for both him and his Church " There is something infinitely higher than the rival claims of Churches, viz , the promotion of a common Christianity and the well-being of a country in which, by God's good providence, each Church has its place and work " I am, c" CHARLES E.
