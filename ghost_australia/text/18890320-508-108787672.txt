Political. SENDING THE MONEY OUT OP THE. . COUNTRY. One of the jeatch-cries of the protectionist party to n«*-»nlring people is ' Let us bare protection and stop the money from going out of the country/' In future the advocates of monopoly will be obliged to leave this delusion alone. The public have now the recently-published returns of trade from two protected countries — the United States and Victoria. The American Treasury returns show that with all her greatness as a manufacturing nation under protection she last year imported -£100,000,000 worth more than she ' exported . That is, according to the protectionists, a hundred millions sterling was sent out of the conntiy. Coming nearer home, the Victorian trade returns just issued show that for every £1 worth exported Victoria paid £2 away |or imports. Here is a horrible protectionist ghost badly broken up. Why should not the Protection Union in Sydney agitate to arouse their protec tionist colony to ' stop the money going out of the country.'
