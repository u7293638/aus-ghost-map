; DIOCESE OF SANDHURST. [From our own Corespondent.) ' The many, well-wishers of tie Very Rev. Fr. Nicholas Crane, O.M.I., brother of our venerated Bishop, will be glad to learn that he celebrated his silver jubilee on Wednesday, 15th inst, at St. Augustine's Priory, Echuca. Fr! Crane was ordained priest jost twenty! five years ago, on the 15th January, 1865. It is the earnest prayer of his numerous friends that he may long be spared to advance devotion to Mary Immaculate of whose order he is so distinguished a member. Apropos of the above, the following, from the gifted pen of Catherine Tynan,' in the " Ave Maria," in re the Church of the English Martyrs, Tower Hill, London, will be read with interest. It was Fr. Crane who collected large sums in the colonies for the erection o£ this church in the East End of London:— "The shrine itself is framed of pure alabaster, with the snowy marble figure of Our Lady in the midst, illuminated for ever with a steady glow from some hidden light, which, pouring on the delicate, pure head and shoulders, makes the figure look, from a distance, like a pale flame. Around and about is a ring of angels, like the angels in Murillo's 'Assumption,' tending up. ward, and with eyes toward their queen. Silver and white the shrine is, with no more garish .hue than these—the tabernacle doors, the candlesticks, and the vases being all of virgin silver. It is a little place of moonlight in this world of vast shadows. The hanging altar-lamp is a silver ship with a blue light—perhaps for a symbol of the Star of the Sea—perhaps as a symbol of her who shall be the ship and the ark into which many souls are gathered and saved. In this church there is an altar (the only one I know) dedicated to thd* Holy Ghost, the Spirit, the Dove, which descended on Mary Immaculate to give life to the world."
