IfrrtOM OUR OOKBISPOKDENT.) , . September 30. Is my last I spoke of the demise of the Cargo Com pany, bat if they are dead thoir ghoatstitls Walks the earth, and entered an appearance ia the flesh at Too- gong tho other d*y before the court of petty sessions, with a view of obtaining a magistrate's order for the delivery of a portion of their machinery from Mr. Bayliss, of the Post-office Store, Cargo, who, although he has not the sign of the triplicate sphere outside his establishment, still, to a certain extent, has been neting the paternal towards the bullock-driven, who deposited it with him when they found the company could or perhaps would not pay the carriage. It appears that some members of the company, with their usucd astuteness, thought by paying Mr. Baylis» for the storeage he would surrender possession, nnd in digging- parlance, let the bullockies rip. But Mr. !Bayliss did not exactly aee this, having an eye both to tho present as woll ri« the future. He at fie first was glad to, and did receivo some ISO from the company, and ia the second, knowing there was no possibility of making mora from them, and that there might be some ohance of profit from bullookey who lives on the apot, advised them (that is tho company) to apply to the magistrates. Thia waa done, but it waa not in tho worshipful J.J?.'a power to ' grant them rolief. Why does not the I unfortunate company die out respectably ? Surely, what little there may be left in the cash line, from tho I sale of their machines, could be better employed than j in endless litigation. \ Wo havo lately had some pretty heavy showers, I which have supplied us with water for washing pur I posoB, and that makes the place look up. Messrs. Wall and Church's maohine is nearly completed. The Pros- I peotors. Lucknow Beef, have resumed operations, and will shortly be followed by the Rise and Shine, &o.; I Our school ia oponed, and at present the number of j scholars is over fifty. Thia ia a good beginning.
