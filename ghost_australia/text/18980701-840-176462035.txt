Thero !' . - ' That is better; ii I like letty, from— from friends.' "/" Sheput her band in his. How soft and tinyiit'felt in his big brown paw. He detained it just a moment. ; ' "Was ho goit'ig to" kiss goodbye ?' -she wondered. But he didn't. ' No, don't conic to the door. You'll catch cold, -letty,1 he said. Then he sprang off. She watched him driving down the park, till the great wood swallowed-him; up, ;then- heaved a little sign "and sat down. / . ' /; ! Never- miiurjj be had kissed her once. Yes, and tliat night, before - she -fell asleep, she rehearsed the necktie scene, half a dozen times at least. !'-./' Barton told> his mother all about what he had '.done when he '/returned- that , evening from Laird Tompkins's, and though she laughed a little she was evidently pleased. ' Now Letty Johnson, like a gi'eat hi'auy American' young ladies, and Eng lish, 'too; for the matter of that, thought she knew all about the game of love, or pay;; rather, the science. AVcll, Letty' .was a fisherman, if that is not an Irish hull/ and she knew well enough that ; getting.a salmon to bite and be hooked required' considerable skill, but' she krievrako that gaffing and' landing was' oftentimes far.more difficult. , . /.''/.Moreover she did, not forget that - to ;i-'rexcite.:d little jealousy in a lover's ';f hrenit had a good effect. /In- such cases \- k.theTt'er" feels inclined to kick the other : fellow, upbraid the loved one, then after . a time forgive her, and once more swear ' unalterable adoration. But even American girls may make mistakes at times, and at the dance that evening, though Letty gave Barton a valse or two, she. rapidly filled up her j tablets, and the name of Sir Robert Clay came in very often indeed. That . ancient baronet could not of course go '. in for them all, but what mattered it? — ho had the privilege of sitting those out, his feebleness forbade dancing. . He was a light-hearted, gay, old gal lant now,' and Letty seemed to be listen-; ing with delight to the soft nothings ho was whispering in her ear, so that he had never felt so happy inhis long life Before. Yet though; Letty, sat s trilling she was thinking, and hor heart was-far away, and often too her eyes wandered to certain corners of tho room where Barton was. The young fellow could hot. make it out. Letty's conduct puzzled him. ' During their first dance "it had been all but arranged that, he should take her down to supper. He even went almost i. 1 the length of churning -her company; She was . so sorry, so sorry, hut there . was Robbie yonder. . . She could not dis appoint so dear ana so old a friend. Robbie would break his heart. . . . . 'Hang Robbie!' said Barton, beneath . his. breath, but he bo wed arid went off for someone elso. , ( Later on lie was; strolling by liimself and smoking somewhat languidly on tho fairy-lighted' lawn, when Hudson sauntered up with h' cigar in his hand. ; 'A light' Hudson, certainly? - 'But . here, try one of mine.
