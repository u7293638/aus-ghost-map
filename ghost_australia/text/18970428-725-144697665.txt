Thus he .was constantly , before the;gov«mor, and the punishment for the offence -was meted out to him. After he had undergone eeytral doses of .punishment he .began, to, think' that:all thejpmoids weie idowmon him- This he shortly became convinced of, and he, got an idea into his head that everyone, ^rom thenewest guard np to the governor, -was in league against him, and. was, being bribed to , kill him.

Strangely enough, however, .fee wpuH eat the ordinary prison fare.with great gusto, but whenever anything better was; brought to him his suspicions, were aroused, and be refused (he nourishing food. Even after he finished his time and w«s let out on ' ticket of -leave ' he kept to the same, story, and to many people he averred that the prison officials tried to pniaon him on many oocaBions. Another prisoner, a big. burly fellow, struck quite another ]i?e of oooduct. He was very fleshy when he entered the prison, but being able-bodied bfivroB .pat..apon hard labour.

So he cooijiliuned.tiiat His rimT^rir was BKBAKntoi-owH, and was, of course, examined by the -prison doctors. They could find nothing wrong with him, and an a matter of faot, thought his condition had improved during the time he had been in the prison. The convict,, how evBr, was not1 malingering; ? He really thought he wasrapidlyJwindUng away, and nothing could convince him to the contrary. He diu his wort weili but invariably made his complaint, which eventually became a standing joke in the prison.' Eventually, as hewis well behaved, he was token off his u eual tasks and given one of the much, coveted positions in .-the oakery. Here he oould oc oaaionally sneak an extra uipprr of bread,' managing to satisfy, his ?hunger'. He was watched tot some time by one of the warders,' and it was found- that on days when he had l¥«L55ableto get any extra food he'made his oompfalnl, but' b'n^be oaer uays' le np pearedto be satisfied with tin lot. It is in teresting to know-that rwhen this man fin ished his term, on' of three years; 4» setttea' down to work athis. trade at a puos where he mi . unknown, -and' eventually ? became » reopectable member of the oommnnitv. ' His experienoein penal eerritude had taught him anever.torbe- forgottsn lesson, and iip to the present he -has -steered clear -of both the police and the gang of lawbreakers with whom he had .-assosiated. A prison', .' one would think would be quite free from jokes, and opntiota. would not be suspeoteH of play ing them. Yet they often do, and although in any other place the jokes would not raise the ghost of a emile, in: gaol they sene to break .the eternal monotony, if 'only for a very short time.
