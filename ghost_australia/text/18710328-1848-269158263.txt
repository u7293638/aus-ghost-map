A GHOST STORY. Mrs Brook related to me the following particolfe^inpresenceofherdiaiighter: _—She and her family were Jiving at Southampton, in a small honse, somewhat ont of town. Her establishment consisted of a butler and two maid seryants. Whenever she spent the evening out. she took the house key with her, and desired the butler- to place on a table in the hall a candle and some matches, and having' seen %er safe inside, took leave, and left her* The moon VEBS Shining, and it was fine night. While Mrs Brook ivas liolding the matches in her hand, and in the act of lighting the candle, she saw a man. cam@ down the staircase into the hall, opposite to where she stood, .still busy iightmgjthe candle. Thinking it was the butler who ^ad awaited her return, she said, " Oh i howcan you be so foolish c.as4j&i3ifc; up, when you know I have ordereSlpra to goTto bed, and do not wish it ?„ ^'Why did you do so ? As she spoke thetigure slowlymoved along the hfell, and began to de-v scend tiie Mtchen stairs. Not receiving any answer, and the candle now being well alight r she looked tip more attentively, and Tendered to herself vphy^fhe^ butler did not speak, and. why he ^rore a- cut- away, coat andl)rass buttons from of uncertain moonlight, slie notteed-noihiBg otherwise singular in his appearance. As it was late, she-went up at once to bed. leaving her door open in order to hear the butler return "upstairs to his room, who was awake. *' I cannot^ conceive,", she said to her, why .Tames should have sat --np for me to-night* against imy press orders, ^oid now lie is staying the most Tuaaecountable time^in the Mtchen., J[ mnst^go and wake JaheJ 1 (the maid) " and make her go and see what lie is about..
