Victoiia Amateur Turf Club. The presence of a number of sportsmen from the other colonies, and the approach of the Autumn meeting at Flemington, caused more than the ordinary amount oE interest to attach to the proceedings at Caulfteld on Saturday last, and as the attendance was a large one, and the racing most enjoyable, the result proved highly gratifying to the executive of the Victoria Amateur Turf Club, The weather was thoroughly genial, and the course was in excellent order. inconvenience was experienced at the railway statiam and the numerous visitors who sought I the rail as a means of transit wewH landed on the racecourse platform with creda! able despatch, he programme copaprra half a dozen items, and a good start was punctually to the appointed hour with the ! Hurdle Race, which attracted the large fieldof sixteen runners. Qf this number, the locally (trained horse Yanderbilt, which, i the property of the 11 w r««H j-»ufcy, VI. O'Hneo, was made A strong Uvuunte. The rue-, was run at a strong pace turough- mi' and all iha horses negotiated the hurdles in ca.iral s:ylo without.,, a single mistake. Deringa and Sinking Fund occupied citi-picu-'Us p -itious 10 iiiu van for the grr.ir.er part 01 the did ;» oe, bat Royal Maid r<v--s up toe running ab.-ui. I. -.If a ui lie t ruin home, ana as the .-iti d-'.gitt, .. ..o r-'HC jtd looked all over a wiauri.

The Nun achieved a somewhat unexpected vic .ory, rather easily, over Mistral and Muu- | wye tio a Che Oakh-igh Handicap next came on for . decision, and 1 hr» eagerness that mauy dis played e vidence that mnch interest was contievi '.a the event. A strong demonstration made in favour ni the Israelite soon caused the S uith Au-stialiau horse to be a very decided tavoui i-.e. Of the others Breeze was most fancied, but Silver Mine, Fair Ellen, and Xantippe also came in for a large amount of support. The race was a desperate struggle unt'l almost a hundred yards from home, where William Tell shot to the front, and won very easily from The Israelite and Sifv ermine. The winner is engaged in the Newmarket Handicap at8st. 61b., and, as may be supposed, he is now first favourite tor that event. Ten horses tried conclusions for the Steeplechase, which was full of incident. At the first of the treble, in front of the stand, Morven came down. Later on, Lady Asbton fell, buc got up quickly, and continued riderless in the race for some distance. At the fence at the back, Hard Times came to grief, aud at the sod wall the field was further reduced by Pride, Progress, and Patchwork falling. Studley, the favourite, managed to steer a i safe course, and, having some advantage over I Euchre at the last fence, won easily. Sailor injured one of his legs during the race, and pulled up very lame. Gold Top appropriated the Selling Race rather easily, and on being submitted to auction was sold to Mr. E. Weeks for L150, all of which went to the club. Jocular, who was second, was also claimed, and purchased at the upset price by Mr. B. Gray, who subsequently allowed the colt to go back to his old quarters I on receiving an advance of L10 on his bargain. j Another large field went to the post for the I Hawksburn Handicap, which was productive of an excellent finish between the three placed horses, Ringmaster, Gipsy's Warning, and 1 Lesbia.

The lot were despatched to a capital start, but before they had gone far Sinking Fund and Deringa signalised themselves by going to the front and leading over the first hurdle, just clear of Royal Maid and Koolyte. Pass ing the Btand, Deringa and Sinking Fnnd were almost side by side about a couple of lengths in advance of Koolyte and Fusilier. Then came Equity, Royal Maid, Vanderbilt, Mirtb, and Chatsworth, with Cervantes and Bon Bon bringing up the rear. Ascending the hill, Deringa held a slight lead of Sink ing Fund, while Magnolia momen arily took third plaoe, the other lot being led by Fusilier, while Bon Bon was out-paced, last. Along the back Sinking Fund was eased, and Fusilier joined Deringa in the van, the pair holding some advantage of Royal Maid, Chatsworth, and Vanderbilt, who were attended by Mistake and Insolvent. Ap proaching the sod wall Royal Maid ran through her horses, and, quickly assuming command, rounded the turn into the straight with a strong lead. Approaching the last | hurdle. Royal Maid appeared to have tbe race won ; but, after negotiating the jump, she was challenged by Vanderbilt, who came from tbe body of the ruck, and a desperate and exciting finish ensued, which resulted in a victory for the favourite amid great cheering, by half a head, Chatsworth was a close third, Mistake next, and Bon Bon last.
