SOUTH AUSTRALIAN JOCKEY CLUB AUTUMN MEETING. [By Telegraph.] Melbourne, May 5, Morning. {From our own Keporter.l A nice fresh morning at Flemington, and nearly all the Cup horses were given serviceable work. Anglesey began by striding over the distance at a sound pace. This horse is well, and will take Bome beating' if he happens to. be in the humour to try. Lantern, ridden by Nicholson, and Sardius, with Wyman in the saddle, then cantered .round to the fivefurlong post, and jumped away in company with Ruby. The mare was soon beaten, and the other two went on together until a f urloug from home, when Sardius drew away ana finished in front. Lantern was not ridden oat, however, and the gallop can hardly be a trial test of the merits of the pair, as it took them 3min. 2 sec. to run the distance. Sardius, who looks in perfect condition, carried his full weight, and his backers seemed thoroughly satisfied with the performance. Coriolanus alone did a useful" gallop. Anchorite ran once round in 2 min. 32 sec., but finished in a rather slovenly fashion. Plausible did failwork alone. Ringwood ridden by Robertson, and Britisher with a light boy up, then ran once round in 2 mm. 32 sec., both going in very taking style. The big horse may have had a little the better of the spin, but Britisher was cot ridden out, and he palled up in splendid form. Lord Wilton, with Sanders up, beat Country Boy easily over a mile and a naif. The time was slow, but Lord Wilton could have made it faster, and seemed to finish very strong. Conjecture, who has been heavily backed in the right quarter, galloped yesterday. The stable think they have a great chance of winning the Cup with Guesswork's sister. & Melbourne, Tuesday Afternoon. The betting on the Adelaide Cup to-day is confined to three horses, Lantern having been driven back to 10 to 1 in consequence of his defeat by Sardius. Britisher, Sardius, and Conjecture are all hardening, while there seems to be very little : demand for either PrometLens or Wilton. 1 he prices are 4 to 1 agst. Britisher taken, 5 to 1 agst. Sardius (offered, and 6 wanted), 7 to 1 Conjecture (offered, S to 1 taken freely), 10 to 1 Lantern (taken and offered), 100 to 8 Prometheus (offered), 100 to S Wilton (oftered), 100 to 6 Madcap (tkn.), and 100 to 5 Camerine (taken and offered). Melbourne, May 5,10.14 p.m. Beyond a strong run on Conjecture there was not much betting on the Adelaide Cup to-night. The sister to Guesswork was backed down to 6 to X, and for.money she left off a better favourite than Sardius, against whom 6 to 1 was freely offered. Britisher is firm at 100 to 30, but there are no signs of a revival in the case of Lantern, and Prometheus and Lord Wilton are both easy at 100 to 8. Very long prices were offered against a number of outsiders, several layers offering to bet 100 to 1 against each of the fifteen. The following weights have been declared :— \- FLYING HANDICAP.
