THE OLD CATHEDRAL ORGANIST. [From Oiambcrs's Journal.] Tis forty years ago since first 1 climbed these dusty,' winding stairs To play the Dean in: Imw 1 s.jurned Beneath my feet all meaner cares. When first I leant my cheek on fire, And looked down blushing at the choir. Handel and Haydn and Mozart— I thought they watched me as I played; While Palestrina's stern, sad face Seemed in the twilight to upbraid ; Pale fingers moved upon the keys— The ghost-hands of past centuries. Behind my oaken battlement Above the door I used to lean, And watch, in puffing crimson hood, Come stately sailing in the Dean ; On this the organ breathing low, Began to murmur soft and slow. I used to shut my eyes, and hear The solemn prophecy and pBalm Rise up like incense ; and I loved Before the prayer the lull and calm, Till, like a stream that bursts itB banks, Broke forth brave Purcell's 'O give Thanks.' I know those thirteen hundred pipes And thirty stops, is blind men do The voices of the friends they love, The birds' song, and the thunder too; And the fierce diapason's roar, Like storms upon a rocky shore. And now to day I yield me up The dusky seat, my loved throne, Unto anothei ; and no more Shall come here in the dusk alone, Or in an early matin hour, To hear my old friend's voice of power. And yet, methinks, that centuries hence, Lying beneath the chancel fl -or, In that dark nook I shall delight To hear the antheiif swell once more. And to myself shall 'quietly smile, When music floods the vaulted aisle.
