I regret the loes of the matter the-mote because I had grat dae prominence to the iuterustiiig col. lectioa of mineral exhibits nnder Mr.Jack's «are. Fortunately I have preserved mynotea,-1 and can give some aecon nt of tiie specimens. He erptiuhfid in k most courteous manner the whole .collection. It was not very large, bat it was representative of the whole Northern mineral prodnciions, and win chieffij valuable as sti0win£ the different groups into which ttie minerals (divided themselves, and in which they are generally fonnd associated. Acard marked the central mineral, and around it the several subdivisions of the fsmily. The speci mens, as a Me, were email, with the excep tion of » large block of silver ore from Sing and C#V thine, Ravens wood. The specimens were fKii JM&Krootn; on the gAmid-lnr, ntid "fit*: - Tbey were inglasa casss aq^ roond the room, and we need, not «syti»tihe_tnimer8 flocked there the first . Hung. Tin was well represented, ~ Herberton I the lead; copper, several splendid ' specimens, green and bine and pnrple carbo-1 dates ; therewBS only a small specimen of j malachite j arsenic, sulphur, iron, sil\er, sine, j manganese, nickel, antimony, bismuth, argen- j tiferons" galena, gold, on^ *maH gpfedinens. The Brian OTiynn, St.1 Patrick, and North Augtralianjyere represented. Mr. Jack showed me two' epwmenn 4/t' coal,'irate - from Bowen, and the other from Cooktown; the latter was much the heavier of the two. Lying beside thoee specimens was a fossil glvssopterit (tongue- leaved), which Mr. Jack, informed me, is ali^^ .Srand associated withcoal. In answer t» my'ingniry whether it was probable that coalwould te. Eponi, in the Charters Toweis district be Baid he did not think it pro bable. I was in£otmed some months ago that coal was famd rat for from Charters . Towers. The discovery of coal in the district wonld sead it ahead ten years. I would advise the Secrefauy of the School of Arts to write to j Mr. Jack for a specimen of the glossopterit; being a sare Jnditaition of coal, it would be OB^d that oar prospectors should become fa miliar with it. This could be done if a speci men were placed in the .gjass Case mthe library,' !31r. ?ia£fciB abont to start for. the Clonenrry to join ?teneral Fielding; thence they proceed to Paint Parker, and Mr* Jack works his way back by Normanton tp George town and TownsviDe. The object of sending Mr." Jack on tfaiB expedition we cannot entirely approve, - while more important and immediate work lies ready to his hand. We should much prefer seeing Mr. Jade spend ing amonth or two in the Kennedy district, and making a thorongh and exhaustive survey of all , its mineral resonrces. If he fonnd coal in this distrirt he woold deserve a first class prize at once. In the lower floor of the baOding was a fine coUectdon -oS. saddlei y by lb; Chandler, and a q>lendid exhibition of cured meat, beaf, mutton and bacon fan the establishment of Castling and Johnston.

There is quite an exodus from the $eidi on, Saturday half the\ houses which I Jaw ihe preceding ^Saturday j bad disappeared. On arriving at Cunningham's JWaterholes a new township appeared to.be springing op. It iB said Hie line will open there next month, but as tin isaaid by McSharry and O'Bourke it must be taken with a laxgegtain of salt. A station building is being erected Htos, and probably a permanent jtownsbip will rise at this point a ait will be the depot for Ravenswood. The mail coach has to make a detour of two miles to go to the Hanghton for iio reason that I eonld see1 except that the poet office was thereand the J Ravenswood coach came in there. That coach most come to the pew station directly the line opens there. Bashfbrd and Co. are going ahead splendidly, Itissaid thatthey will ^ r---r - McSbariy and OTEtourke have finished the coa-] nesting section, and then Hashford can insist on receiving isfls from tfa«»iistriiciiQn engine.

At the Burde kin Bridge they have commenced two heavy vottings, tfre approach on each side. It iscalcu latedthat the cutting right in front of Graham's | verandah will be 30 feet deep before Ins i tap. Whettur be will stand lire cemaics to be j seen, he will probably be blasted oat of that. However, the lord of the manor, Mr. F. Hamilton, is quite resigned to seeing his pro perty and even bis tenants blasted to the . moon, provided he sees his way to Government compensation.' After Ins experience in travel- i ling fences and " tabernacles " on the Towers he hopes that there Is money .to be made at that side of Burdekin Bridge. Macroeaan will still remember Doubs the man who did. his work so well at the Bardekia at the last elec tion. The permanent way at the side of the Burdekin is being rtpidly built. There will be aboit 300 men employed at the Bardekia,: that represents about £1000 a week paid in wages. Many of the Rod people have moved up there jni a regular township will be formsd there before the end of the month. . A post office! is to be opened; and Miss Oonin j who taught the State School at BeidsvOle is moving up. to the Burdekin with her father, and-here is anotner straight tip, William, a daily coach should be put on.. The intercourse between the Burdekin and the Towersmeans money. And the people here ? should at onoe petition the Postmaster! General for a daily coach. When the line ] opens to fcjmmingham's there will be a daily train. .
