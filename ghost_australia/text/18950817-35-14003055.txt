WOMAN'S COLUMN. | I A PLEA FOR THE COTTAGE. I Not one of those decrepit cottages on which the antiquarian " M " loves to expatiate, nor a cottage hospital, nor a cottage and', nor a cottage of any kind whatever to live in, but the old cot- tage bonnet -worn by our mothers and grand- mothers-it is for the resumption of-this we are at present concerned to plead "What, Hat hideous thing'" " That monstrosity '" "What rights we should look to be sure '" " Return- ing to the dark ages with a vengeance '" When the hail of these and the thousand similar expressions of feminine disapproval evoked by the statement slackens sufficiently to parent us to proceed, we would say brat (lost any should doom our subject frivolous), that at least one great name can be found to bolster it, for Carlyle, gruff corner of the graces though he was, did not think it beneath him to buy bonnets for his mother and carefully to choose such as " looked like her head," ay, and to notice their trimming and material, too and in the next place, frankly admit that although, in the course of discussion, other advantages arising from its use may possibly crop up, our chief motive in championing the discarded article is, that it was so generally becoming " Becoming " " Becoming " " " Becoming indeed '"" Ladies, ladies we crave the favour of ATCO speech ' You will have opportunity to reply We repeat, because it was so generally becoming Tor let it be clearly understood that we don't mean the coal scuttle, nor the beaver, nor the spoon, nor the heavy straw with the clumsy " curtain," and a ribbon severely strapped straight across like the young lady's in the story who adopted that mortified mode on quitting the gay world, and going out to become wife- to a missionary in the South Sea Mantis, but the cottage at its best considered in its day as perfect a triumph of millinery as any of its successors can be now-the charming confection of velvet, silk, lace, crepe, delicate chip, or fancy straw, swept maybe 1 yan ostrich plume or decked with French flowers, i simpler and prettier still, cut off by dainty ribbons, strings tied in an artless how close underneath the chin, and with the modest inside bordering of quilted tulle that formed so sweet a setting to the youthful face, so softening n surrounding to the old one-the bonnet, in short, suited to every style of feature the bonnet lor we are already stumbling on its secondary ments which protected the head, screened the eyes, and preserved the complexion A heroine of Miss London's is described as having her hair dressed in a style which none but the most class cal face could have borne " Without making a classic question of the iTodern bonnet-for would not the shadow of Phidias and Praxiteles, roaming through the Elysian fields, shudder at the merest hint of such associations without doing this we oak dispassionate critics if the top-knot now doing duty for it is not extremely trying to all save those possessed of a certain contour of check and brow, or who have, at least, youth upon their side, and the freshness and softness that go with it Youth, indeed, to a certain extent, looks well in anything Nevertheless-ignoring the butterfly with strings as being a practical avowal the part of the wearer to dispense altogether with a head-covering for the street does not the ordinary bonnet hung out, in full relief, each faulty line, make the thin face look thinner, the broad face branded- while it exposes, with pitiless fidelity, the sharpen- ing profile the wrinkle the hollow, and the fading hues To propitiate vanity, however, or-pray, where is the harm of confession p-let us say that diluted form of it shown in the laud- able desire to look as pleasing as she can, which no true woman is without-to minister to this feeling is not the sole raison diet or a bonnet It is supposed to act as a protection against the weather No argument is required to prove that it does not at present Bert of this purpose Neither, we think, can it be denied that neuralgia, toothache, and imperfect eyesight are incalculably more prevalent than they formerly were It was said by an eminent physician that soon after the old "cottage" went out and its diminutive successor came in, the faculty observed an immense increase of facial neuralgia in a cure, and to attribute this increase, as well as that of toothache and weakened sight to the want of a proper head covering is, assuredly, just as plausible a theory as many of those adduced on the popular subject of exciting causes Be it remembered, also, that in our climate the variable winds, hot one day and cold the next, and the blinding sun- light glare, render some efficient defence against them an absolute necessity "Why then," say come, " if all these admirable reasons can be urged against it, why wear the thing, why he s Has to a senseless custom Because, we answer we are slaves, and you know it Once a model has been vetoed, its manufacture dies, and the stock in hand vanishes within the cauldron of the arch milner Medea, thence to emerge remodelled, at her flat How else account for the marvellous rapidity with which it disappears from warehouse and from shop ? Make for yourselves then Straw is not the only material requisite , not to sell, or lace, or velvet you have spoken of, and Colin your own ideal " No, that would not meet the case either The art of millinery is not natural to all women, and many never succeed in acquiring it, specialists were hold a necessity even in Plato's republic And where is the professor 1 artiste who could be tempted to execute an order for a bonnet not to be found in the fashion plate ' 1 rule, there is the Salvationist poke or the near approach to the cottage, worn by some orders of nurses, but these are uniforms, and we may not be attached to either corps Besides we should be called eccentric, and eccentricity in dress is to be avoided often has to be avoided Let some strong-minded woman un- earth from some ancestral ghost the fossil that we advocate, and, thus equipped, apply personally for a situation as governess, shopwoman, of photographers assistant-with what result * She would be disqualified at first sight Even the uninitiated male interviewer would discover "something queer about her somehow "None, save those to whom belong a certain prestige and position, can afford to be unlike every body else, and to w ere what nobody else wears Miss Strickland declares that Catherine of Braganza failed to bring in the short skirts that would have become her own small feet and ankles, because " it is beauty and not rank that leads the fashion," and the poor neglected Portuguese Princess was not beautiful Assuming our view of the question proved, and an alteration every way advisable, where then is the reigning belle who will take up a cause quite as reasonable as many that are daily age tated and inaugurate the movement by appearing (say at some great public function), in a bonnet that shall be at once sensible and pretty ? Could Australian; women do anything in the matter ' Alas, it is a far cry to Paris, and they supinely accept whatever comes flora that quar- or, whether adapted to their climate or not We have heard of a Dress Reform League in England succeeding in effecting some salutary changes, but they seem to have stopped short at bonnets Would it be beyond the province of the Sydney Ladies' Sanitary Association ? Could the doctors-, but no, they are powerless against the tyranny of fashion In a magazine-plate entitled " Curiosities of a Century," exhibiting every variety of headgear, from the enormous hat of 1 SOO to the slight superstructure of the '90's, the mode hod cottage is the least grotesque, and we return to our first position-the most becoming of them all But it might be improved upon We are not obstinately wedded to this particular pattern, but are ready to throw over it or any other pet fetish that stands in the way of needed change And surely on ago distinguished for devotion to art, fertility of invention, and enthusiasm for the laws of hygiene, might furnish genius sufficient to originate a bonnet combining the threefold qualities of grace, comfort, and utility.
