PORT ADELAIDE MECHANICS IN- ' STITDTE. TO THE EDITOR OF THE REGISTER. Sir — since my last communication to you on the ab'»ve subject I have patiently awaited for some demonstration from tho late Secre tary, and was somewhat surprised that he did not conctive it wottfi nis wuiie to stir in tue mat'.ttsr ; but having had it binte-l to me two ur rhree da\s since that he considered it (tho step I proposed, was the convening ths late Trustees and Commit tee- man, or such of them as may. bs comeatable) as rather beyond his latitude, as the servant of the late Institution, to take such a step without some authority — allow me, through the medium of your frieiidly columns, to suggest to him the possibility of ac complish ng the desired end without incurring this droaded responsibility; which, I im«gine, j may be attained by getting the sanction of tho lat i President, oi one of tbe VicePresi dents, to convene the meeting by an advertise ment bearing the signature of one or mora of them. Trusting that be will not permit this fearful responsibility to stare him in the face, and to haunt him like a troubled ghost, but determine to act vigorously, and s-hdw himself tiie real tVL-ud he maintains lie is fr- the Port aud its inhabitants, I am, £5r, &c;, THE PORTOXIAN. 17th July, 1854. ?
