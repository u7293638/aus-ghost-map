Messrs. Nicholson & Co.'s Music. Among the new music to be found in the firm's stock, the '(Enono Waltz,' composed by Amy Parker, deserves especial notice. The waltz is written in the key of ' D ' fiat, modulating; for tho second movement into 'A' flat. The melody is pleasing, and the indispensable swing, that marks the strain that may bo danced to, is well sustained throughout. The harmonies are particularly full and rich. Either as a piece to be played at any time with brilliant effect or for tho uses of tho ballroom, the waltz must prove an acquisition. ' Every Life Has Its Story ' is a bari tone song sung by Mr. j. Aldrich Libbey in 'A Trip to Chinatown.' The words are humorous, and the air remarkably pretty. A singer of moderate powers will have in this a song suitable to himself and acceptable to his hearers. The ' Third Album of Pianoforte Pieces ' contains 17 selections of the hi ghost merit. Tho great composers are fully and judi ciously represented — Handel, Mendelssohn, Weber, Schumann, EaJl', Rubinstein, and several others. Hero is a veritable musical treasury, and dull must bo tho taste that does not find something in the col lection to charm it. Various degrees of instrumental ability are also provided for. The finished performer may find matter to test his skill ; the performer of powers less developed will find his requirements suited. Every piece, at the same time, is deserving of the attention of the most accomplished musician. The price — one shilling — is almost nominal.
