MISCELLANEOUS. A DREAM OF THE SOUTH WIND. ' O fresh, how fresh and fair, Through the crystal gulfs of air, The fairy South Wind floateth on her Bubtle wings of balm! . And tho green earth lapped in bliss To the magio of her kiss, * Seems yearning upward fondly through tho golden crested calm ! From the distant Tropic strand, Where the billows bright and bland, Go oreeping, curling round the palms with swoet, faint, . undertone. From its fields of purpling flowers, Still wet with fragrant showers, ! The happy South Wind lingering sweeps the royal blooms of June. All heavenly fancies rise On tho perfume of her sighs, Which steep tho inmost'spirit in a language rare and fine, And a Peace more pure than Sleep's j Into dim, half conscious deeps, Transports me, lulled and dreaming, on ito twilight tides divine. Those dreams ! ah, me ! the splendour, So mystic-clear and tender, Wherewith like soft heat-lightnings tiley gird thoir meaning round. And those waters calling, calling With a nameless charm enthralling, Like tho ghost of music melting on a rainbow spray of sound ! Touch, touch me not, nor wake me, Let grosser thoughts o'crtako me, From earth receding faintly with her dreary dins and jars, What viewless arms caress me t What whispered voices bless mn, With welcomes dropping dew-like from the weird and wondrous stars ? Alas! dim, dim, and dimmer Grows the preternatural RÃ¼mmer Of that tranco the South Wind brought me on ber subtle wings of balm ! ' For behold ! its spirit flic th, . And its fairy murmur dieth, And the silence closing round mo is a dull and soulless calm! PAUL H. MAYNE.
