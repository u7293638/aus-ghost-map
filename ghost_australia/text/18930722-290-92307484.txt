MR. JOUST X. BIRKS REPLIES. TO THE EDITOR. Sir— lam not eurpriatdatyour correspondent, ' Huxley V Ghost 2Vo. 2,' adopting the lawyers' motto ' No case, abnae the other side.' Abuse of mvself I do not trouble about, nor cue to reply to, bub whoever it comes from I simply do aa the man did to his donkey when it kicked him— attribute it to his ignorance. To the charges he and many others make against me, I can only answer aa Paul to his judge, ' Neither can they prove the things whereof they accuse me,' When any definite obarce is made, then I may attempt to disprove it, Irat itisimposribletoatteinpttnatwithttieindennite charge* hitherto made. Yoor correspondent reiterates bis fahw accusations against the labor leader*, and adds other random charges absolutely destitute of truth, and I now ohal fengo him to name (even behind his shield of anonymity) a single labor leader in Sooth Australia to whom nis accusations will in tbe ?lightest degree apply. I almost fe*l aa though X ought to apologise to yoor readers for taking any notice of snob a letter, and in any further communication from the emae source there must be at any rate seme email modicum of truth and courtesy or I ahall do clme to notice it. — I am, &a.; JOHN N. BIRKS.
