LONDON TOWN CAME. FROM our OWN eonBKS-UNDENT.) LONDON, JAN. 20. There is no one to whom I yield in admira- tion for Mrs Oliphant She is the writer, above all others, who disproves the popular but foolish notion that an author who is prolific cannot be also good The tree that bears most fruit as a rule bears the best fruit Dickens, Thackeray, Trollope all used to write much and very well Mrs Oliphant s genius, though inferior in some respects to that of those great novelists, is more various She is not only a novelist, whatever literary work she puts her hand to in this world she does well Even outside the world, from the unBecnBhecandrawBomo interesting pictures Her Beleaguered City is an example of it, her charming ghost stories are another w here she fails is where she essays to pour tray the next world Misled by some enthu BiaBtic reviews, and the admiration which I have for her talents, J took up the other day with great expectations Ila. Lillie Pilyum, which purports to take a modest peep behind the veil of mortality In my humble opinion it is very milk and water stuff, some thing between a tract and a fairy story She has also, to my mind not altogether escaped (what it is very easy to fall into when dealing with such a subject) Borne touch of irrever ease the heroine to too much at ease in Zion Divinity demands some respect beyond spelling its personal pronoun with a capital letter Ofcourse.such a topic requires avery strong as well as an angelic wing A novel once came out called After li ill r s D Uh (1 for get the author's name), and I thought the title immensely attractive But it was not, I was told, any revelation of a future state, not being angry and disappointed, I never read it Alta Death, by Louis Figures, is also an illusion-in my opinion a mere catchpenny production And lately there was a melancholy little volume attempting the same theme, called Post Mortem very poor Bluff indeed Yet what a subject for fiction if only the master mind were found to deal with it Though no one has written satisfactorily about the next world, ghosts have had no reason to complain of their treatment, especially by lady authors Mrs Oliphant, as I have said, has described them well, with a sort of respectful enenesB, Mrs Gaskell still better Of all the famous " Round of Stories by the Christmas Tiro (a Christmas number of Household sent), her For Tyndale legend was the best Miss Mulock, too, has told at least one very good ghost story, where the ghost is visible to everyone except the person it effects Who, again has not felt the vivid power of Lord Lytton's " The Hunter, and the Haunted fifty times better told than that " Strange Story of which it was the original sketch But the story that thrilled us most of all on its first appearance was "Mr His Own Narrative,' in All the year 7 otmd this has just been re published by Mr H a widow, in a little book all by itself, and I am sorry to say it is very disappointing Perhaps the circumstances of its first publication mi. prtsBed one, and gave the experience a " creepineBS not its own It appeared twice in Dickens's journal The first time it did so Mr Heaphy (Mr H ) wrote to say that the experience had actually happened to him, but was not properly narrated, so Dickens allowed him to tell his own version of it As it can be bought for a shilling it would be unfair to epitomise it here But I repeat the effect is now very disappointing What is by far the most curious part of it is the correspondence between Dickens and the narrator The latter states, among other reasons for identifying the story as his own, that the date is the very date on which it occurred to him to which Dickens replies, "1 everything associated with your strange experience would seem to be extraordinary for in the version I received and published tinted as no date All that was set down as to time was, " late in the autumn When I came to revise the story in the proof for the press, the need of some precise date was so clear to me that I myself inserted on the margin of the proof the date you find in the published narrative Why that date (September 4"!) should have come into my head rather than any other I am profoundly unable to say." We all know Dickens's lean ing towards the supernatural (in story) but for my part, since reading The Narrative in its present state, I am inclined to believe that Mr H. 's date was a moveable one A great deal of nonsense is written about the moral evil wrought by " cheap novels and " railway novels." I know some at 31s 6d which are as bad as the cheapest As a matter of fact however, except a few, written I am sorry to say, by women, there are no immoral English novels. The quantity of fiction is also greatly exaggerated. According to the Publishers' Circular, the number of religious works which saw the light last year was 700, while the number of novels was only a little more than half as many. If there is an organ of the publicans corre sponding to our 'Tiser in Copenhagen, it must just now be very angry, and be well convinced that "there is something rotten in the state of Denmark" indeed. A law has been passed forbidding barmaids, or, at all events, fascinatingly dressed barmaids,' from dispensing liquors to customers, and also cutting off all customers under 18 years of age Moreover all drunken persons are to be conveyed to their own houses in a cab, or covered carriage, at the expense of the landlord in whose house he took his last glass." Conceive the alarm in the publican camp—there are no less than 11,000 publicans in London— if these Danish regulations should be adopted here. I wish no respectable (and powerful) interest any harm, but I should rather enjoy seeing youthful applicants for liquor handing their certificates of birth across the counter (" I'm just 18, I'm quite a man; I'm no 'young person' now"), and then the long procession of cabs, or perhaps a few private omnibuses stream- ing from The Toper's Arms to " deliver " intoxicated customers, like pots of porter " at their own doors !" Nice as a fashionable locality, but also a health resort, and it is no wonder that among a society of invalids " some commotion " has ensued upon the capture of a band of " stranglers," who, it seems, have fixed upon that spot for introducing "Thuggee" among the inhabitants. In thus imitating a time honoured Eastern custom they were, however, by no means service, their intention being " to use the lasso in the same manner as the buffalo hunters in South America.' About forty of these gentry have been arrested, but by no means all. For my part, rather than run the risk of being lassoed even among vines and olives and in a climate ever so celestial, I would try Rams- gate, or even Gravesend, for my little com- plaints Imagine an "invalid,' with a hot sun and a cloudless sky above him, pursued by even less than forty mounted "strangers ' with lassoes ! Good gracious ' There is to be no more exercise, and I am truly thankful for it, Science has at last discovered a substitute for all those dreary "constitutionals" which the medical authorities have so long maintained to be necessary to life. I don't believe it, because I am " alive myself (though it must be confessed, I can scarcely add " and kicking" ), and never took them. Pedestrianism, besides putting me out of temper (it does that with every body), has always given me a pain at the back of my neck" the weakest part of the body, as physiologists told me (but that's an error, in my case it a the legs), while horse exercise, though it was short (I was generally thrown off early), has been always hateful to me. When man is mounted conversation ceases-and, like the great Johnson, "I love good talk"—or he makes its topic the animal he bestrides. In these latter days folks have taken to tricycles and things, but the fact is that all locomotion which one has to do oneself is tedious and fatiguing. Thank Heaven, there is to be no more of it. The Zander Medico Gymnastic Company (I am sorry to say, Limited) has come to the rescue of the human race Visitors to their establishment in Soho square can, as I gather by their prospectus, got as much exercise in 10 minutes from a combination of machinery and galvanism as will last them for the do) One machine " works the humors and exteriors of the legs and thighs, the body being alternately raised and depressed at different distances from the treadles," another is used for exercising the promoters and supporters of the arms , a third brings into play all the respiratory muscles, so that (which must be very satisfactory) even the scales and the plasma can be felt contracting under their use "There is a substitute for horse over case to which the company have given a picture in their prospectus, I think some what indiscreetly, because, except the saddle, there is very lonely nothing to hold on to, which is just my objection to what is called a hog maned cob, I like a curl in a horse's mane However, you cant fall far from the under Medico Gymnastic seat, which is fortunate, since it has not only a forward and backward, " but a lateral motion " which would seem to combine the delight of nautical travel with the sensation of going across country " Some of the ap paradise for rubbing,' says the prospectus, " are very complete,' but let us hope that does not refer to the "side saddle I know nothing about the merits of this inst tution, but the notion of having all one a exercise compressed into 10 minutes, is, I confess exceedingly attractive to me Methratton, the great seer of England, Eliza Anna Rosa, the secrets of New York (so that the individual in question would appear to be of both sexes, and to reside in two hemispheres), has been remanded by the magistrates of Birmingham for knowing too much or, rather, for selling his information There could be no complaint of his charges being excessive, Since he offered " news of the invisible world' for 20 stamps, and even " talismans for victories over enemies for from 10s upwards Such a talisman, if it worked, would pay for itself ten times over in a single afternoon at whist) a whole " seven years future' could be purchased of this wizard, like a leasE, only on much more moderate terms, namely, for 7d and even his Elixir of Life' only run to £10 Una gentlemans communications to his fellow creatures were, in short, Buflicieutly amazing, yet not one half so curious as their communications to him for the present, I am sorry to say that, in the interests of public justice, they are suppressed, but hundreds of letters have been found in his possession the existence of which would suggest not only, as " the Bench" observed, that the number of fools in the world was much greater than we have any idea of, but the number of knaves also WiveS confide to Methratton that if he can foretell the early death of their husbands it would be a great consolation to them, one country gentleman of distinction ' remarks theatre of his mother, from whom it is needless to say he had expectations. Young women request that time and space may be annihilated in order to make one lover happy, and receive in reply a prophetic emblem' made of brown paper, guaranteed to effect their object The wickedness of some of these applicants is appalling, but their folly (in a country which believes for one thing-in an hereditary aristocracy) does not astonish me in the least It was once made clear by Mr Sala, in one of his charming essays in Household Words, how curiously Demand and Supply miss one another how the advertisement in The Times requiring the very commodity offered in the next column goes unanswered, otherwise, it would seem surprising indeed that the great Mathratton was never applied to in the case of the missing heiress" we hear so much about, deserted by her patents 20 years ago," for whom ten thousand a year " and accumulations are now in store If -as in the words case-box were no obstacle, and also if the dates could be made a little more convenient, I should at once join that increasing band of young people who suddenly remember being left on a door step in the neighbourhood of Kingstown when they were a month old. My conviction is that I should make an exceedingly good hnrPBS and be a comfort to my friends. To my mind the correspondence between Mr. Gladstone and the young lady in consumption at Wigan is very illustrative of his character, and also most creditable to him She sent him a bookmaker on his birthday, with "The Bible Our Guide" worked in silk upon it, accompanied by a few words of farewell. He returns her flowers and grapes, and an autograph letter, with this sentence in it -"May the guidance you are good enough to desire on my behalf avail you fully on every step of that journey in which, if I do not precede, I cannot but shortly follow you It is not only the good feeling but the courage of the man which one admires piece (poor human nature being what it is) I Bul pose he knows that half his own admirers will laugh at his sentimental folly" and nine tenths of its opponents will give it a harsher name 11 it is true that General Booth is inviting people with money, who have need to live on the interest," to lend it him at five percent, my valuable support in henceforth withdrawn from that spiritual warrior. " Friends can thus give their capital to the Lord, " he is reported to say, while securing for their own use the interest upon their money," and a little higher interest (he omits to Bay than by investing it elsewhere No, General, I have a few hundreds myself, but before I lend them to you on such an audacious representation, I will see you very much further than you are at present, and in such changed condition of climate that I hardly like to be more pre In Thomas Noel's Patqtcr's Drive (so often attributed to Hood the deceased congratulates himself that he is for once (though it is for the first and last time) conveyed in a carriage. At Gainsborough I suspect paupers have walking funerals. At all events, the economy with which the other arrangements for their interment are conducted seem to be excessive. It was stated before the board of guardians that the contractor for the coffins made them so small " that they had to kneel on the lids and squeeze the noses (of the departed) flat on to the face," This is a lioiDg a "contractor" with a vengeance,
