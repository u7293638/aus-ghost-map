FREAKS OF A LUNATIC. A man whose name is unknown, and who it is believed is a lunatic, escaped from the Yarra Bend Asylum, has been frightening women and children at Hawthorn, and the neighbourhood by going about enveloped in a sheet and personating a ghost. One young girl (says the Telegraph) named Brook- field, a servant, was so frightened by his antics and appearance that she had a succession of fits and had to be sent home. The man has since then, it is said, been found drowned in a waterhole at Boroondara.
