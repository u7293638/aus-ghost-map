If you go to a dance, dt-aw a pair of old eilk ones over your good ones to protect them from injury. The language of the' fashion plate and the woman's paper is sufficiently appalling to the uninitiated even iu_thesy days of emancipated, and, .presumably, wore gram matical womanhood; but, according to an extract from a fashion journal of 1787,"the jargon of a, century ago was even more as tounding. This is how the paper described the dress of a certain Mdlle. D at the opera:-"She appeared in a dress of 'stifled sighs,' ornamented, ?with 'superilous re grets,' the bodice cut in a 'perfect candour' po-int, and trimmed with 'indiscreet com plaints.- Her hair was dressed in 'eus .tained sentimentÂ®,' -with a headdress of 'as sured conquest,' ftmamented with several' 'flyaways' and 'downcast eye' ribbons, and her collar was 'beggar-on- horseback,' co lour."

' It has been considered unlucky to be mar ried iu May ever since the days of Ovid: In ancient Rome there was held in May a festival called the Lemuria, or feast of the Leimires, which was a, ceremony in honour of the Speeches of Departed Souls; It be came with the llomaus what we should'call.' "bad" form" to have matrimonial feasts at the season of a solemn ritual, being no ? doubt thought to be an insult to the dead to marry at such a time. From this a. number of stories grew of the revenge made; by the outraged ghosts upon, those who dared to disregard theni, and if anything" unfortunate happened to a couple wlio had been married in May it would, of course, have been put down to retribution.

One quality should never be overlooked, and 'that is the suitability of the costume chosen to the weaver's posi tion, her type of face and figure, and its appropriateness to the occasion on which it is worn. Other qualities highly to be de: sired are simplicity of design, neatness and perfection as to cut- and iinish. But there is also an art of wearing clothes which' should not be overlooked, an art by the aid of which many a woman on an income' alto gether inconsiderable manages to give an impression of grace and elegance quite out' of the reacli of many of her more wealthy sisters.
