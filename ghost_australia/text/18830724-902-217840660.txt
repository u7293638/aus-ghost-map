;DGYN IN THE DAuK. Down in the lower levels of our mines, hundreds of feet below the surface of the earth, in the great dominions of Erebus., where darkness ever holds its reign unbroken by the light of day, are .'found very curious .growths. The "Grass Valley Tidings" makes the following comment on n specimen of this subterranean vege tation : — " On. Saturday some. miners.fonnd a very queer specimen in the 760 level in the Idaho mine, The specimen which was found among -the .tiip her is a sort of fungus (punk, we believe the miners call it), and is just the shape of a human hand. The hand has .five fingers and a thumb, aDd seems to be in a sort of cramped positiou. Il is a most singular-looking specimen, and may be seen at the Wisconsin hotel." In the lower levels of the Coipstock mines— par ticularly those long abandoned or up used — are seep many wonderful growths of different kinds qf fungi. Some of these are of great size,' almost .filling up .drifts aud seen by the dim light of a caudle look like sheeted ghosts. Do.>vn below ip the dark these growths seem to strive to imitate the .forms of things .seen, op the surface. In one of our mines was once found an imitation of a fancifully- caryed meerschaum pipe, stem anfl all, so perfect .that it >vuld easily be mistaken for the genuine article if not taken in the hand and closely examined. Some of -the fuugi resetphle the horns of animals, and are from 2ft. Jo a yard ip leugtb, while others might pass for petrified devil/ fish..-- American Paper.
