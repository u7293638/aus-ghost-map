INTEMPERATE ADVOCATES of" ' TEMPERANCE. TO THE EDITOR OF THE HERALD. SIR-The licensing question, with the restriction or abolition of public- houses, is not merely a burning question " to be dealt with by the ordinary platform orator, but appears to be coming within the range of practical politics, therefore it merits the attention of thoughtful men, it should be dealt with in a reasonable manner, and not left in the bonds of our sonable fad dista however well meaning At the outset one may admit the general facts on which those gentlemen found their case-that drink is the greatest curse of the Engluh-tpoakiugrnco whether at home or abroad that it degrades and rural life and character indi- vidual) andeSUeetivoly, that, in short, no terms of abhorrence are too strong to apply to it, and trust ey orr reasonable means should be taken to curtail its sum and even if possible to abolish it entirely) But while most of us have for she recognized these were lost, and many of us have acted on them in our respective local spheres of influence, we are not prepared to go along with the more violent advocates of abHtimnce in to a) inga and proposals by) which they seek to attain their purpose is to object to their treaton not of the publican as a parish on whom we are to have no mercy, with whom we are to have neither 21 cents nor dealing, and whose property may be taken without scruple In the words of Sir Chamberlain the publican is a man who has entered on a legal business with legal sanction, he may have any asked the way part of years in this legal business, and all days carried it on in a perfectly respectable minister , therefore. It would be absolutely monstrous to reduce this man to poverty and throw him and W f milly upon the streets, simply because there has been a change in public opinion since he invests! his money) The intemperate utterances of these i artisans in years gone by disgusted many reasonable men had prevented them publicly joining the movement' and now, as in the past, their violence prevents practical legislation to deal with the evil in England Their association has for years been carry Eng on a vast and noisy agitation, with enormous funds at their disposal and not have accomplished nothing in the way of legal! action against drink It has been vox repeaters mill with them. On the contrary, they have absolutely obstructed such legislation. borne years ago they prevented the passing of Mr Bruce's bill, which, it calculated, would by this time have extinguished from one half to two-thirds of the public housed the ghost the kingdom, and their only reason was their sentimental doctrine of no compensation to the) publican in any form As the movement here is on all fours with that in England, the leaders being pp. parently in close correspondence, it may be profitable to look at the condition of the question in the old country. The Government recently) brought in a bill, whose provisions may be arranged under three heads 1 I be magistrates shall issue no more licenses unless in certain exceptional cases I An additional duty has been placed on intoxicating drinks to the extent of £1 300,000 per annum of Of the sum £10,00 is to be placed in the hands of the newly formed county councils, for the purpose of buying up and extinguishing licenses, out cannot be applied to the compensation for licensed whose renewal the magistrates have declined to mention One would have thought that these provisions would have been hailed with delight by temperance reformers, as lending to rapidly reduce the number of public houses and settling the vexed question of compensation on an equitable I used to the public the trade itself residing the funds for its own extinction-and it has been so hurled by reasonable reformers, petitions signed by thousands having been presented in its behalf, and the Church of England Temperance Society, one of the largest and, perhaps, the most influential in the kingdom, having resolved unanimously in in favour Nevertheless, the intemperate party have opposed it solely the ground of their objecting to any form of compensation. I hey den; that the publican boa any claim to compensation for being ruined, or that he has any vested interest in his business, but this denial contract be sustained So long as he conducts his business properly, the magistrates cannot refuse the annual renewal of his licence, which therefore becomes a vested interest and is so recognised by the State itself. When the publican dies, his estate is charged for probate duty by the State, and this vested interest a valued and charged for at two years' rental of the premises in which the business has been carried on low, then can statesmen who have for j ears recognised this interest and profited by it, now at this eleventh hour deny its existence it It is true that the vested interest of the publican has not been be absolutely recognised here as at home, but it has been acknowledged to some extent practically-, The magistrates do not re- fuse the renewal of a license so long as the home is properly conducted if the holder becomes bankrupt the official assignee obtains power to carry on the business for the benefit of the estate till the license is sold, and the every day) occurrence of sales shows that this is bona-fide" ] report in which the holder possesses a vested interest this intemperate party are comparatively few in number and insignificant, and although supported by the radical and li ish obstructionists, would have been unable to defeat the measure its second read ing having been carried by a majority of bl) but an Irish ally managed to discover a technical obje Son which prevented the first and third of the proposals being included in the present measure, and therefore they have been postponed till next session, the funds in the meantime accumulating in the hands of the "National Debt Commisioners I see the party before misrepresenting these proceedings Mr Clarke Supt T O G i in your columns this morning intimates that it is j roused to give compensation in cases where the r newal of license is refused , but this is absolutely contrary to the fact, as such cases are expressly declared to be debarred from any claim to compensation Again, the Local Option League at their meeting on End i>, passed a resolution to send their hearty congratulations to the United Kingdom Alliance for their triumphant opposition to the omronBatioa clauses of the Government bill " but, so far from their opposition being triumphant it was defeated by the large majority of 60, when direct issue was taken and it was only on a mere technical objection ruled by the Speaker on a point of form, that the Government had to withdraw their clauses, and that only till next session the open position took the form of political faction Of course it received the note support of the Irish party, with other Violent obstructionists like Sir W. Harcourt and Mr. Labouchere, and the more weak kneed sheep Uko followers represented by Sir George Trevelyan and Mr Chichester Fortescue but what shall we say if Mr Gladstone, who adn n joined the obstructionists, though in past years committed to the 1 Final In of comp nation r" In conclusion I would ask do not the English pro 1 again offer a basis of settlement well worth coa federation here? To the immediate adoption of the first there can be no reasonable objection A limit ad rate or otherwise, should be placed on the power of magistrates to grant licenses At present those gentlemen in many perhaps in most districts, issue them in unwarranted profusion, and there can be little doubt that the more licenced houses therefore, the more does drinking prevail there would be more difficulty about the other two provisions, especially with regard to the authority to be entrusted with the power of purchase, but it istkefunc lion of statesmen to devise means for overcoming such difficulties
