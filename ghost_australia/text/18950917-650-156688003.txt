NOTES OF A MIUTARf TWANG. O- ? ? Saturday last was a bu3y, afternoon ai far as tho military were concerned. U, two infantry companies paraded at 3.35 at their headquarters, and wore marcht} off to Denison Flat. I was tniict pleased at the steady marching of both companies as they went down William, street, the step and time being both ex. cellont, and this was all tho more cre'dit. able as the band, for reasons I could not find out, was absent. Steady marching, without ' tap of of drum,' is always a liatj matter for any but regular troops. Tin muster of B Oomnanv was vi\rv n«,i and shows that Captain Hudson sparei!! no pains to keep his men .up to the matt H but I was disappointed with the master' ii of- L Company, and would impress on |§ the cadets this fact : That one hour ol il daylight drill is worth hours of night S drill, and they should take every chance fli of attending on Saturday afternoons, anill thus improve themselves and bring credit 1 on . their officers. p I noticed that a new staff-sergeant H was with, the infantry. This js the i third change I have noticed in about the fe; same number of weoks, which must bi U very annoying to the officers command, f. ing the companies, and certainly not ^ beneficial to the men ; as I know from past experience that it takes some time for men to get used to, tho instructor'! & voice and manner. 'This was verj K noticeable in the early part of Saturdaj'i j? drill ; and the marked improvement to- £ wards tho latter part of the exorcises, | when the men were being drilled by their | own officers, with whose delivery they are p familiar, was very great. These remarks of mine are in no way fault-finding as K regards the staff-sergeant, who seems in |j every way a smart, soldierly, young | fellow, and one who knows his work, | Physical drill, manual and firing exer' 1 cise (under Lieutenants Allman and i Pringle), and batallion drill (under | Lieutenant Cheffins), finishing up | with an excellent 'general salute' under 1 Captain Hudson, and the march home, I this constituted a good afternoon's drill, \ A goodly number of people were on the | flat, and I thouerht to rnvsolf'; ' T'n» 1 Bathurst people are at last taking some || interest in their citizen soldiers,' when the cry of ' Here they come,' and the sound of clattering hoofs1 showed me | why the crowd were gathered together— | it was to see the Mounted Rifles at drill, | No doubt there is something interesting | in watching mounted troops at drill | but the way the crowd rushed off from watching the Infantry and tore down to the other end of the flat to where the Mounted Rifles were, was rather funny, How anything new catches on with tbe people of this world 1 and how long will this love of the mounted men laBtl were . the two thoughts that rushed through my brain. I should like to sea as much interest taken in one force as the other — honors to be equally divided —and I feel sure that military matters in Bathurst would boom for some time to come. Staff- Sergeant Wasson gave | his men a real good afternoon's work, and if the G.O.C. is not pleased with them next Saturday, it won't be tbe Sergeant's fault, I notice the Surgeon Lieutenant 'has been drilling with tbe Mounted Rifles. I was under the im passion he belonged to the M.S. Corps and was attached to the 3rd Regiment, Has he resigned his commission and joined the ranks of the mounted menl Go on Mounted Rifles aB you have com menced, and ere long you will be able to hold your own with the best of the otber companies of your Regiment 1 I bear L. Company had a great mus ter on Thursday night last. They paraded in review order and looked quite smart | in the new addition of scarlet shoulder | knots and aiguillettes. They wero | marched out to Kelso and resting there | a ghost time were marched back as an 1 advanced guard, and I hear satisfied 1 their O.C. very much. I hope, however, | they will take notice of my remark rt | Daylight Drill above, and I then think | that they will not be far behind their | elder brothers in arms of B. Company. | The current week is to be a busy one | for our soldiers. Thursday night the § cadets are to have a special parade fo | prepare for the G. O. C.'s inspeetion, |j Friday night the privates of both Infan- K try Companies hold a dance in the | Masonic Hall. Saturday both branches | of the service are to be inspected at I | p.m. on tbe racecourse by the Major- | General, and on Sunday I believe there | is to bo a Drum Head Church Parade, | but where and at what time I cannot | find out, but have no doubt Captain - Hudson will soon make the matter pub- jjj lie through your columns. As it is in [a his hands 1 know that everything will g be arranged as it should be. | A little bird has whispered to me that | the closing remark in my 4 Notes' ol || Monday last does not seem in a fair way | to be carried into effect, and that tha | relationship between the two arms here | in Bathurst is anything but friendly. | One officer openly complains of tbe re. | mark being made by a newly joined® 'brother officor', that the mounted i| men are such a very different class, you |j know. I'm not going any further into|| details on tho matter just now, hoping | that some mistake may havo occurred | | but if I hear more of this I shall not $ scruple to show the whole matter up, | When a man once dons her Majesty's | uniform, which I bold it is an honor to | wear in whatever grade of the service | you are, such humbug as ' class distinc- | tion' falls to the ground. Tho rich man | in the ranks becomes at once the in* | ferior (in a military senBe) of the poorer | man who carries ' tho stripes,' and the | officers, when once they receive tboit ! commissions, become on the. same level p as ' officers and gentlemeD.' Whatever j their so-called social rank may be, if j military matters aro to go ahead in this,! city, all such feeling must be at onco ^ sunk, and all officors must meet 88 I equals, having regard only to their seni ority of appointment, and work toget- | her for the host interests of tlie honor* | nble service in which thoy havo enrolled | themselves.
