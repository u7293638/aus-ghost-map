8ELEOTED POETRY. Late Verse. THE ISOLATION OF ESQLAND. At tho present time, when tho English \- papers are admitting tho unpleasant fact that > the Old Country is eadly isolated and haB so many onomios and so few friends, wo are tempted to reprint somo voryflno nnd stirring linos, onuttou xno i6oiuhuu w uuiuuu, whioh appeared In the Fall Mall Gazette early in tho month of Novcmbor last. They will, wo arc sure, be appreciated by all of our readers who sympathise with the dear old Motherland aoross the sea in this hour of trouble. Tho verses aro anonymous and run as follow:— The wind Is hushed tho darkness grows Tho fainting moon is lost in flight j — Death lifts a sorobro hand, and throws His olouds noross tho faco of night. With parted lips and haggard stare, That strives and straius to pierce tho gloom, Eaoh nation orouohes in its lair, And, breathless, waits tho ooming doom. Dim ehapolcss shadows pass Hko ghosts; . Along tho trembling earth thoy feel Tho distant tramp of marching hosts, And hoar tho smothered olash of steel ; Till, reaching out for frlondly hands To guide them through tho gloom, they press - ' To whore one silent figuro stands Serene in lofty loneliness. Thoy hurl their taunts, their oaths, their prayers,— The snarl of greed,— the growl of natoj— They spit upon the cloak she wears, Or grasp us hem to supplicate. But still, as thongh she board thorn not, Her anxious eyes aro flxed afar Amongst tho clouds, on one pale spot, Whero faintly gleams a single star. By that samo star sbe ohoso her path For ovory night in vanished years \ Though sorconod by mists of doubt and wrath, She sees it still) as If through tears. Then, glancing at the fretful hordo Who call her now to bond the knee, £ho fays her band upon hor sword, And turns hor, eyes towards the sea.
