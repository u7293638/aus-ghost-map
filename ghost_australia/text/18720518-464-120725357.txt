THE COMMUNISTS. Three nameless Communists were shot last week at Sartory for participation in the mur ders of Generals Thomas and Lecomte ; and five others have been sentenced to death for the same crime with regard to the hostages at La Roquette. The trials of the late insur gents are nearly over. The last statistics published give, as the result, 4,526 recorded ?judgments, and 20,754 liberations without trial; malting in all zo.aau prisoners dis posed, of. But the Commune still lives in secret ; for what were the Communists but the bolder and more sanguinary disciples of these revolutionary and irreligious principles which still leave France oscillating in perpe tual danger, and unable to come to the de termination to break for ever with the Revo lution, whether it be openly proclaimed by the Communists, or substantially defended by such politicians as M. Thiers. ' THE WHITE PLAG.' The 'White Flag presented to the Comte de Chambord is said to have cost upwards of Â£2,000, and is contained in a red morocco case about 4ft. long. The dra/peau consists of an immense sheet of heavy white satin, on which are embroidered the Bourbon arms, the em blems of the Holy Ghost, and the principal historical events of the House of Bourbon, the whole surrounded by the ribbon of the Order du Saint Esprit. The TJnivirs announces that Mgr. Chigi, the Papal Nuncio at Paris, has just left for Rome. The cause of the journey is a serious illness under which the brother of His Emi nence is suffering. The Nuncio paid a visit on Sunday to M. Thiers, to inform him of the reasonkof this departure.
