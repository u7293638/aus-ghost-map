Death of Mr. Bind. AN OLD IDENTITY. A PIONEEE THEATRE MANAGES. The death, in Mb eighty-second year, of Mr. William Dind, has removed from oar midst the oldest Australian theatrical manager, and one who will be remembered by the oldest of oar playgoers as a genial honorable man. Mr. Dind passed away at his residence, Cowle's-road, Mossman's Bay, yesterday, after a long, busy, and eventful life. He first entered upon theatrical manage ment at the old Prince of Wales Theatre (which stood on the Bite of the present Theatre Eoyal) over forty years ago, and for twenty-two years was almost continuously associated with its management. A partner at one time with Mr. Dind in the old Prince of Wales was the veteran George Coppin (now of the Melbourne Theatre Eoyal), and the actor longest associated with him is genial ex'-Alderman Eainford, who played under ids management for eighteen years. The pantomime 'The House That Jack Built' was the last production Mr. Dind was responsible for, and it was during its financially disastrous ran that the Old Prince of Wales Theatre was burned. After this event Mr. Dind retired from theatrical management and settled at North Shore, of which municipality he was for several years the highly respected Mayor. In spite of the ups and downs of the profession, 'the Ghost' never failed to walk on Tuesday morning under Mr. Dind's management, and many an old Australian actor, dead and gone, has had cause to remember him. as a good and true friend.
