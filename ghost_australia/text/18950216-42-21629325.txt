Selected Poetry. Forty Years. NORMAN GALE in St. James's Budget. Sit yon down, Old Friend, and talk Books as sweethearts, books as wives, Others frolic; we have turned Golden corners of our lives. Forty years of love and loss, Forty years of smooth and rough! All of those diviner days Gone with Youth's electric stuff I What a sunshine ! Such as lit Love at twentyâ€”sweetest dawn ! Hear those youngster* romping thore, On the green unshadowed lawn t Every buxh for them's a rose, Every bird a nightingale; Long ago our slower hearts Boat as beautiful a tale t Each of us has married work, Each has kept lite ski?lo bed; "Whore a golden Love should sleep Lies tbe ghost of love instead. Bit you down, Old Friend, and talk Books as B\veetheavt?, books as wives. Love is romping; we have turned Golden corners of our lives.
