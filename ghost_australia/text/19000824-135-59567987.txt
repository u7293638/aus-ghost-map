CARE AND WORRY. \-- â‚¬ You have heard of care and worry-darkl v.sitors, they say, Who stalk about ramiliar as llamlet's ghost at play. They come and tarry with you, unbidden and unasked, And flaunt their gaunt arms o'er you add weight to every task. They watch the rays of sunshine, and guard your open door, Lest light and hope may enter iand sing the songs of yore. Close friends are care and worry, they laugh and dance with glee, And pile the laggots higher at each . white lock they see. They glory in the shadows their black robes flinhg about, And while the cloud is o'er you they laugh and dance and shout, They ever walk before you, for should they fall behind, Their forms would vanish from you like mist before the wind. But over on the other side wait love and hope and joy, Mother and wife and sister, and little Bob, your boy. The robin sings m the willow and the skylark chants his lay, And flowers blossom about you from the morn till close of day. Fling back at care and worry their black robes of despair, And know as the years pass swiftly God's hand hath rested there. Smooth out the great deep furrows out wide on brow and cheek, For trouble lies in the valley--you are nearing the mountain peak.
