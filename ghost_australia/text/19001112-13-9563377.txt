THE NEW DIOCESE. A PASTORAL LETTER. Archdeacon Armstrong preached at St Pauls Cathedral yesterday morning, and read the following pastoral letter, addressed by the Bishop of Melbourne to the members of the church in his diocese I address you with all earnestness touch- ing the most important subject which has called for the attention of churchmen in Victoria since the formation of the diocese of Ballarat 25 years ago "Let me first remind you of the sentiments expressed by Bishop Perry and Archdeacon Stretch when the diocese of Ballarat was about to be formed At an in fluently council, held at Ballarat, Archdeacon Stretch (and -I do not hesitate to say that the true and permanent interests of the church in our and are bound up in the extension of the episcopate and I am confident that the appointment of a Bishop of Ballarat will do more for the general efficiency and prosperity of the church in this district than any other steps which can be taken On another occasion Bishop Perry said -'I hear lil) join with you in the desire that I may live to see in extension of the episcopate in the colony It is an) earnest visits that I may see founded not only a bishopric of BUlai it but one of Sandhurst also, and both held by men of God, full of the Holy Ghost and of power It is well known that Bishop Moorhouse earnestly advocated the formation of a fair diocese It is now nearly nine years since Bishop Perry was gathered to his fathers How would he have rejoiced to learn that the Church Assembly of which he was the founder had passed an act to create a new diocese in the colony of Victoria, and to provide for the appointment of the first bishop thereof, and the maintenance of the sect And not only so but the bill was agreed to by a large majority of the representatives (clerical and lay) of the two northern archdeaconries I desire to commend this project to your sympathy, and prayers, and your co- operation The addresses delivered during the Church Assembly in 1897 and in the present year might have satisfied every true churchman that the archdeaconries of Sandhurst and Beechworth need more constant episcopal oversight than they receive at present Confirmations ought to be more frequent and confirmees more mine rous the church in Bendigo, with its large population would be greatly strengthened if there were a bishop in residence there A comparatively young and energetic bishop, such as 1 a list you will obtain, would gather round him a band of zealous workers, both clergy and laymen, new life would be infused into even department of church activity and spread throughout the new diocese On the other hand the Bishop of Melbourne, relieved of so large a portion of his present diocese, would be enabled to devote far more time to the iireliilciconij of Melbourne and Geelong, and that of Gippsland Such being in views I appeal! for your generous aid in raising the needed funds for the endowment of the new sec All of you can do something especially if the spirit of self denial be exercised Speak of it to your friends and neighbours as a work for God and for The extension of His kingdom in this colony Where circumstances allowed devotional meetings might be held at convenient centres from time to time under the direction of the minister to intercede with God for His blessing upon the effort now to he put forth Let every member of the church in his or her own secret pray crs bring this urgent matter before the throne of the heavenly grace the hearts of all men are under God s rule and governance He can incline the hearts of those to whom He has entrusted the silver and the gold to devise liberal things for the extension of His church " A on nie doubtless aware that the ap I ointment of the future bishop of the new diocese will rest with a board of electors What love with it zeal, which devotion what wisdom will be needed by him who shall he chosen to the office of bishop' Let me therefore entreat your prayers in behalf of the heard that they may be guided to the choice of one who shall prove a faithful and true pastor of the flock of Christ One word in conclusion, is to myself As bishop of the undivided diocese I have for the last 14 years gone in and out among the residents of the two not then night deaconess confirming their children, opening their churches, speaking at their public meetings and pet forming such other acts as were suitable for the Bishop to execute On these occasions Mrs Gee and myself li ive always received unbounded kindness and hospitality We have made many friends among both clergy and laity The thought of being no longer officially connected with so warmhearted a people is painful But I am fully persuaded that the best in terms of the church require that this severance should he made and I trust that my kind friends in the north will regard it in the same light ARCHDEACON ARMSTRONG SERMON Archdeacon Armstrong, in supporting the Bishop s appeal for the creation of the new diocese said that the proposed step was in line with the great forward move mont in church matters which had distinguished the present century Leaving the grace of the episcopate out of the question, as a mere matter of church organisation the superiority of episcopal government especially when, as out here, its exert lse was limited li) constitutional safeguards was beyond all question Hut to us the episcopate was surely more than this It was the unbroken chain, the links of which bound as to the church of the disc divan The Bishop of Melbourne was the direct spiritual descendant of St Paul and St John, and if St Peter even were Bishop of Rome (which was in the last degree improbable), then of St Peter also And in that was one of the strongest testimonies to the great truth of the continuity of the church to fulfil the ideal of a bishop, he must be constantly in touch with his work a living visit to administer confirmation at nut interval was not Milheicnt Indeed, the need of more episcopal supervision had been and still was being felt the present bishop felt it deeply, and all that was needed now was for churchmen to show a practical ap gradation of episcopacy by a substantial contribution towards endowment of the see, but we should deprecate sending home to the mother country to beg for month buttons The vigorous growth and development of other dioceses after subdivision might reasonably lead nil to expect similar developments here There was even reason to believe that RUC li expectation would not be disappointed
