The BioerdilltU-foutsec Joltt. ENoh weary guest is worn to a ghost; Oh, list to our tale of woe I How we long for a rest from our landlady's roast, But how she makes it go. Oh, sing me a hymn of the luscious ham, That never our table sees I But only the limb of the ancient lamb Whose sequences are thse : One day hot, and the next day cold, And the third day "stew" is its name; And the fourth day hash, but the same old joint It gates there, just the same. The markets groan with the fatted grouse The stalls o'erflom with fowl; I sometimes moan for a Chinese mouse, Or a slice of toasted owl. But ever the shape of the aged sheep On the table lies alone, And like funeral crape despair doth oreep As the same old rule goas on: One day hot, and the next day cold, And the third to "stew" we stoop; And the fourth day hash, and the fi'th sad day The bone is in the soup. If only the lambl were bred for the loom, And his flesh was for food too coarse, I'd care not a darnfor the lambkin's doom; No more than thehorso.car horse. If the tariff tax would complete its tricks, And the price to heaven should soar, Suoh a state of fasts would our landlady fix, And we never would grumble more: One day hot, and the next day cold, And the third day greasily stowed; And the fourth day hash-Will it ever reach Innocuous desuetudoe?
