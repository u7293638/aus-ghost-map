THE FAITH-HEALING SEN SATION AT OLDBURY. I uk excitement occasioned by the visit of the Rev. B. Dinnock to Langley appears, sayB the Hiuminoiiaji Gazette, to be growing every day, and it iB feared - there will be a serious Bplit among the- members of tho Primitive Methodist body and other denominations of the place. The section of the community who have been onorated unon bv the rev. rrentleman are now naturally firm believers in tho new methods which are resorted to for divino healing. On the other hand there is a respectable portion of the religious community who repudiate tho claims that are made, and consider that the people are being deceived. These two sections of tho church at Langley are now at work in opposition to each other, and . very lively meetings are being held. Re cently a scries of united religions service? was commenced, the first taking place in the Bc-thcl Chapel, conducted by Mr. Silas Round. The following night the second meeting was held in the Primitive Methodist Chapel, Mr. W. H. Phillips having to deliver the address. After singing and prayer Mr. Phillips said that God did not pour out His spirit in the 8am e way as ho did on the Day of Penti- coat, for when God poured out the Holy Ghost it shook the building. Since then God bad not produced tho same effects. "A man then jumped up in the audience, and, seeticulatins in an excited manner, denied the statement, and said that God had given him the power, had filled his whole body, and he exhorted the people to believe and give their hearts to Christ. An indescribable scene followed. Some called out, " Hear, hear," and shouted with religious fervor, while others hung their heads in silencu. After a time Mr. Phillips made an effort to proceed with bis sermon, hut the parties on tho opposite side proventcd him by singing a hymn, which a part of tho peoplo joined in. Mr. Phillips and his friendB saw that it was impossible to go on further, apd the meet ing came to an abrupt conelusi. /.
