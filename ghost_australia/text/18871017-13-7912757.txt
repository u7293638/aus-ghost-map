MR. LOCKE RICHARDSON'S RECITALS. Another large audience gave Mr Richard Son a warm greeting as he stepped on the platform in the Presbyterian Assembly hall, on Saturday evening, and invited his hearers to spend an hour in the society of the Squeers' family at Dotheboys hall, in York shire, commencing the episode with the schoolmaster a breakfast at the Saracen's Head, Snow fell, and concluding it with Nicholas Nickleby and Smile 8 escape from the scholastic establishment which the genius of the novelist lins "damned to everlasting fame ' 1 he mingled humour and pathos of the narrative were heightened by the voice of the reader, and, excepting in the case of the sordid and ignorant pedagogue, each of the characters was sharply individualised, the best, perhaps, being the schoolmasters husky helpmate But Squeers was made to speak in very much the same tone as old Scrooge did on the previous evening, whereas the creator of the character leaves upon the mind of the reader the impression that the proprietor of Dollie boy's hall snarled and growled like a dog, but could be exceedingly Bott spoken and propitiatory when he had the parents or guardians of a prospective pupil to con debate. Mr Richardson brought the first half of the entertainment to an effective climax by his dramatic presentation of the severe thrashing which the usher inflicted upon the brutal school master, round after round of boisterous up plause attending the gratification of the audience both with the incident itself and with the admirable manner in which it was related, no less than with the reading of the letter from Fanny Squeers to Mr Ralph Nickleby in which she informed him of his nephew a violent conduct, and conveyed the distressing intelligence that her father was " one mask of brooses, both blue and green, and that two of the school forms had been "steeped in his gear The second part of the entertainment commenced with on Enoch Arden like story in the Lancashire dialect, written by Mrs. Burnett, full of pathos from beginning to end, and so uniform in its sadness that, if recited by an unskilful reader, it would have become wearisome , but Mr Richardson secured the mute attention of his hearers from the first, and retained it to the last, when the prolonged silence was broken by a burst of hearty applause Then came the finest achievement of the evening the recital of I hollins Hood a ' Dream of Eugene Aram" 1 Ina has been often delivered in Melbourne, and it was one of the late Walter Montgomery's best pieces of declamation But Mr Richardson has distanced all competitors in this particular instance. Whether by the force of imagination or by dramatic insight, he brings the whole scene of the murder as vividly before the audience as it was present to the mental vision of the conscience stricken criminal The horror of the act, and the agony of the remorse inspired by the haunting recollection of it, go on gathering force and intensity as the wretched man recapitulates the story of his crime, and when Mr Richardson reaches the verse " And still no peace for the meatless clay Will wave or mould allow The horrid thing pursued my soul It stands before me now 1 -ho starts back, utter a cry of anguish and terror, and looks SO appalled by the phantom thus conjured up that the audience, after the first thrill of sympathetic emotion, find relief for their strained feelings in a shout of applause The beat criticism on Mr Richardson's acting and delivery at this point would be that of Partridge on Garrick's Hamlet in his interview with his fathers apiarists the best player ! I am sure if I had seen a ghost I should have looked in the very same manner, and done just as he did.
