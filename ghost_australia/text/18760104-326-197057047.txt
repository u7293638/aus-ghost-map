HICKORY DIOKOBY DOCK. A. tiny quadruped oaBayed 1 A dizzy height to climb, Whore mystio symbols, oiroling round, Marked out the oourse of time. The height is gained, tho goal attained, When, mark his trembling fears 1 A loud report — a horrid din Assails his shuddering ears ! ; At once he deems his honr has oome ; He seas in vision rise Each stolen cako, each purloined cramb, , Like ghosts before his eyes. With guilty speed, with beating heart, Down from that height he tore, Sought out the earth's remotest depths, And ne'er was heard of more. ' A.P. Boston Advertiser. , Cmtious Discovery. — An interesting dis covery has been made at Greenwich. Owing lo some excavations which have been made for building purposes in the grounds of tho Royal Naval School, it became necessary to remove several coffins which had been committed to the earth for upwards of 30 years. In one part of the grounds several coffins were found intact, the brass nails and the coffins themselves looking as bright and fresli as on the day they were made. On opening these coffins, the bodies were found to be in an equally good state of preservation. The embroidery (observes the British Medical Journal') on one of the dresses was ns unruffled and complete as if it had only just left tho hinds of the dressmaker ; even in the minutest pnniculnrs, the bodies and their surroundings were ns perfect and undisturbed as they had ever been. To use . the words of an eye-witness, the infants were as perfect as it they had just been horn. The reasons for this antiseptic action of the earth are worthy of investigation by Mr Seymour Hadcn.
