'To My Trusty nud Wcll-Itclovcd Coulin, These : — It is anile true, iny deal-! Willie, that my letters to yon have been very short lately; but you havo no idoa how I have beon bothered and worried in coming to terms about) that other tour iu tho south, and then I bare (had to try and p:icify papa. Ho has taken it into his head that No mifrlif t/* Irnnw mnrfl nlwwt vnni nml nilr ' nrn-t. poets.' Isn't that a horrid word? It is like ' matrimony,' or 'nnptial settlements,' or some thing in a lawyer's office I tell him that we aro' not going to do anything rash ; tliat I for one am 'quite content to be as I am ; and when lie writes Jloiig letters about the importance :oi being settled ?in life and the possibility of his not being long in the world, v.'hat can I do bnt gcrtlly remind him that I have earned my own living for a good many years, and have no great fear of ' being unable to do so ? Poor dear papa, ho U very kind, but lie, worries dreadfully. And really I don't know what to say to him. If you were still the sub editor of that puor defunct magarine, that would be something -definite Shall I till him you arc ? private' secretary to a great lady ? Of course, I, too, wish you had something more sottlcd ; but 'do-BOb iintigino, dear Willie, that lam grumbling ; t'foi\:Bfter.all -are we not just as i+cll off in every ? roBpudtas-we-wero boforo wo ever baw each other, ?andlwUjp-Blionld we not bs quite content with 'tbingd'asitfiejrtwe?

He sots mo the most terrible tasks: and as it' is all scienco and no sound it is not very lively. But really when you look at some ofl'tbo Bongs that are moBt popular now in drawingi-rooms — tho air somo common phrase, or perhaps1 borrowed, and of course changing to minor in tlio second part, and the accompaniment a few simple chords, only lit for children s practising — it scorns possible for ono to do something a little better. And then shouldn't I liko to be able to set one of your Eongs lo music— I moan something like proper music ; I (hink I should not grumble over studying tho counterpoint of that accompaniment. Do you think I would charge my Conlin a heavy royalty for singing tlial song ? There, now ; why don't you gentlemen of the press sot to work nnd crush that royalty ays torn? It is most mischievous; ?aiiil tho very best singera are giviiigiii'to it nbw, 1 and of course tho greater stupid' the cdriiposs'r is the niora cagerisne to iri.ikc tlie royh'ity on the sales iiig.

Situated as wo are, sometimes' 'I 'think 'it 'was scarcely wise to bind ourselves like that— and then ngailv I say 'Dfllhor tlie30; doubts 'and troubles ; it's all becanso Profossor — 's conun drums are too dillloult.' And I am not goiiiR to bother you with'them,.dbar Willio ;'for you must have enough to think : of ; and I meant this to ibo the longest 'and 'kindest lottor ever written, af tor ? what you. &iid; about -ray not caring. I do -care. You have no right to say that I don't— aiui if you were here 1 would prove ii, even to your autwfncthn. There, now. So don't say another word about not caring; but writo mo a long, nico, pleasant Icttor, professing yourself quite contented with everything that Providonco and I have dono for you, and tolling mo of nil tlio news of what you aro doing, and how yon occupy your time, and whether yoir over ? think of' poor banished me. You are very un grateful ; you bare not tho 'slightest notion of ?how good lam toyou—^to ho sitting up writing to you liko this, whon- every sensible crcaturo in Uelfost ib in bod.

This is all at present from, ' Your lovingKinr. 'P.S. Miss Pat'tonco is vory kind to mo -just now. 'Slio'wroto a lutter, which she showed me, to the XoHlicrn II-'ijj horo the other day, about tho number of beggars in tho streets; and a3 sure as over was,- the very next Homing thoro was an article in tho newspaper beginning 'Prom iho number of letters which wo receive complain . iug oi mu munuiuity in tins town, ».vc. un, my! : At first she wasso lofty sho would scarcely s-jioak '.' to me, for sho considers liio a frivolous kind of | crcaturo, but aftcf wards sho grew more gracious, and has boen quito compassionately kind' to mo over since. Last night she made lub wear her gloves on the way homo, for I had frfrgoUcu \ lnino, and it iraj cold. Sho even'Bnid that your vcrsesin Cliambcrs's Journal, which I showed her, wore written with much taste, though sho added that sho thought this was scarcely a time for writing poetry, considering tho sorioiis stato of public affairs. Never mind, Willie ;'th'c°rb is one person nt loast who knows bettor than tliat ; and you need not bo afraid that she docs' -not ap. lirecialo your poetry, as'llie ivorld 'will sdmo'day. ! ' Good-night, good-night ! — K.' Many and many a time did Master Willie rtad over this loiter, wondering to which to .tHncli tho more importartoe— the obvious outward cheerful ness, or thecurioiiB half-'suygcstcu littlo'admis Bionsof trouhloarid doubt.
