FARNELL ON THE SHELF Oh, the sun it shone brightly, Kiama was gay ; All the bands in the district Were called on to play. And sweet strains of melody Bose on the air, While pranced and curveted The brave and the fair. There were races for flyers And solemn parades ; There were prizes for gallants And prizes for maids ; There was feasting in bower And dancing in hall, And the whole was wound up With a feed and a ball. All the youth and the beauty For twenty miles round, On the spree in Kiama Were certainly found. And the only sad face — So the newspapers tell Us — was that of our excellent Friend, J. Farnell. At the banquet the tapers Burnt bright in the room ; But Farnell sat at table The image of gloom. Alas! for the James We remember of yore ; Alas ! for the James We shall see never more. The clanging of glasses, The rattle of delf, They stir not his bosom — He's laid on the shelf. The toast of the " 'Ouse " Had been drunk to the dregs, And Farnell to respond to it Bose on his legs. But his voice it was hollow, His smile was a sham, And he didn't seem worth — The conventional d n. He briefly and sternly Beplied to the toast, Said he didn't come down there To call on the Ghost. That his strength it was failing, His energy spent, To be laid on the shelf He was almost content. Then he heaved a deep sigh, And sank into his seat Collapsed and dejected, Worn out, and dead beat. Oh ! gone is his ardour, And gone is his zest ; Once he'd talk for a week Without stopping to rest. Now set is the'sun Which so lately hath shone ; Alas ! for his glory, Departed and gone.
