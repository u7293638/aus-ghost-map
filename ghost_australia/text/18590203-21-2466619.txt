MYSTERIOUS ADVENT AND WARM RECEP- TION AT FRANKLIN OF A SOI DISANT TRAGEDIAN FROM DRURY LANE. (From a Correspondent.) SOME days ago, on the arrival of the Culloden at Franklin, a very mysterious and seedy-looking per- sonage, who had been unseen during the passage, at its termination emanated from the steerage, claiming sundry large chests and varions great coats, &c.;, as his baggage, and when asked his name by the mate, objected to give it. In a day or two afterwards, how- ever, he blazed up in a new phase, with all the politeness of a 'gent' of the first water, the pushing self-introduction of a thorough-bred showman, and the tact of an experienced traveller for penetrating into the most remote recess of the Bush where a sawyer's hut could be found, equipped in a dress suit of black, with hat to match, and decked out with a profusion of apparently gold chains, seals, and glittenng rings, the whole surmounted by a large white umbrella; it was amusing to behold with what adroitness he pre- sented, from a richly-embossed silver case, his cards of address, followed up by the exhibition of his pocket- book for autographs of patronage, and then, last not least, his single and double tickets of admis- sion to a solo performance, shown by his handbills to be selections from the choicest tragedies. The primary object of our hero visiting us was, as he stated, to make himself acquainted with places, persons, and manners, in order to furnish himself with matter for the last volume of an extensive work, 'A Panoramic Sketch of the Colonies,' from which he expected to realize Â£10,000--his theatrical undertaking was merely of a minor consideration, to instruct youth through the morals of the drama, and provide means of travelling. Before the people had time to exchange opinions as to the who and what of this living curiosity, he had, by persevering industry and persuasion, sold more tickets than any other visiting performer, of whatever grade, who had preceded him, and persons began to think they had been duped, especially when they heard that, without distinction of seats, Mr. Kemble, as he styled himself, had disposed of his tickets for whatever he could get--from five shillings downwards--consequently, when the anxi- ous time arrived for the exhibition of parts of Othello, Lear, Timon, Shylock, Hamlet, Richard III, &c.;, the seats in Brown's Assembly Room were occupied, front and back, indiscriminately by ladies, gentlemen, splitters, sawyers and tinkers, in a state of 'how come you so?' The ladies, seeing the state of affairs, soon made their exit, and so all the gentlemen except those who waited in expectation of witnessing some fun. If even 'Mr. Kemble from Drury Lane,' as he announced himself to be, could have proved his his- trionic talent to be what he boasted of, his mixed audience, by their stamping and unequivocal signs of impatience, would not allow him to pourtray the beauties of his varied and fleeting characters; the dresses were appreciated, but some were disappointed at his not giving a little tumbling in Hamlet or con- juring in Shylock, while others could not possibly see any difference, except in the dresses, between Timon and Richard III., nor did they even give him credit for his energetic aspirations when addressing the 'helements' in Lear. One old invalid lady in the Bush, whom our hero importuned to take tickets, pleaded ill-health as an excuse for not being able to attend, but being told by him it would do her good, thought he must be a quack doctor, and meant possi- bly to electrify her, as the only time her husband ever went over to witness an exhibition at Franklin was at the performance of a travelling chemist, who, with a galvanic battery, cured him of rheumatism, and so the old lady in vain applied for the return of her money, because the nasty impostor did not electrify her as she expected. Despite of the repeated music of the audience and various interludes performed by a drunken tinker, who was occasionally thrust upon the stage during Kemble's characters, he dragged through Othello with a white face and Hamlet with a rosy one, and got as far as Richard, when the audience could no longer restrain themselves, and the poor monarch was assailed with a shower of Huon eggs, fresh and stale, accompanied by a storm of 'rough white and tartans.' Richard began evidently to speculate on the damage that might likely accrue to his ermine by eggs, lighted candles, and other unplea- sant missiles, and rapidly divesting himself of his diadem, sceptre and robe, made one bound from Bosworth Field to the benches in the pit, 'from the sublime to the ridiculous,' with only his under and inexpensive habiliments in jeopardy, and, turning up his shirt sleeves, challenged any 'blackguard' out to fight. As often as he mounted and remounted the forms, he was so often floored by the boys tripping them up. After a little of this bye-play, accompanied by the shouts of the throng, and the invasion by the tinker of the sanctum sanctorum of Messrs. Lear, Shylock, Macbeth, Timon, Othello, Hamlet, Richard, and Co., the evening's amusement ended rather abruptly, and the attraction of the evening retreated into the back parlour of the Franklin Hotel to shake off his royalty and quench his thirst; however, the entertainment was not to end with that act, for having re-assumed once more the guise of plain Mr. Kemble, of Drury Lane Theatre, and lately of the Franklin boards, he assumed a pugilistic attitude of self- defence, and anathematised some of his hearers present as vagabonds, cowards, blackguards, &c.; A set-to was the result, but Mr. K.'s antagonist being the more active of the two stopped his mouth and eye simultaneously; in other words, he appeared next day with little to say, and under a bandage was a portion of face much more befitting Othello than on his pre- vious night's representation when he appeared as pale as Hamlet's Ghost.
