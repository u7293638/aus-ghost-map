I Oh, you good God in Heaven, will you not judge this man ?" Frere trembled. He had often witnessed this creature's whirlwinds of passion, but never had he seen her so violent as this. Her frenzy frightened him. " For Heaven's sake, Sarah, be quiet. What is it you want ? What would you do?" " I'll go to this girl you want to marry, and tell her all I know of you. I have seen her in the streets have seen her look the other way when I passed her-have seen her gather up her muslin skirts when my silks touched her-I, that nursed her, that heard her say her baby prayers (0 Jesus pity me Island I know what she thinks of women like me. She is good and virtuous and cold. She would shudder at you if she knew what I know. Shudder I She would hate you ! And I will tell her ! Ay, I will You will be respectable, will you ? A model husband I Wait till I tell her my story, -till I send some of these poor women to tell theirs. You kill my love I I'll blight and ruin yours I" Fiore caught her by both wrists, and with all his strength forced her to her knees. " Don't speak her name," he said, in a hoarse voice, for I'll do you a mischief. I know all you mean to do. I'm not such a fool as not to see that. Be quiet! Men have murdered women like you, and now I know how they came to do it." For a few minutes a silence fell upon the pair, and at last Frero, releasing her hands, fell back from her, " I'll do what you want, on one condition." " What ?" " That you leave this place." " Where for ?" " Anywhere the farther the better. I'll pay your passage to Sydney, and you go or stay there as you please." She had grown calmer, hearing him thus relenting. " But this house, Maurice !" " You are not in doubt ?" "No." "Well, leave it. It's your own affair, not mine. If I help, you must go." " May I see him !" "No." "Ali Maurice 1" " You can see him in the dock if you like," says Frere, with a laugh, cut short by a flash of eyes. " There, I didn't mean to offend you."' " Offond me I Go on." "Luton here," said he doggedly. "If you will go away, and promise never- to interfere with me or mine by word or deed, I'll do what you want." "What will you do?" she asked, unable to suppress a smile at the victory she had won, "I will not say all I know about -this man. I will say he befriended me. I will do my best to save his life" " You can save it if you like." " Well, I will try. On my honor, I will try "I must believe you, I suppose ?" said she, doubtfully and then with sudden pitiful plead- ing in strange contrast to her former violence, "You are not deceiving me, Maurice Ã" No. Why should I? You keep your premises, and I'll keep mine. Is it a bargain ?" " Yes." He eyed her steadfastly for some seconds, and then turned on his hotel. As he reached the door she called him back. Knowing him as also did, also felt that he would keep his word, and her feminine nature could not resist a parting Biicer. " There is nothing in the bargain to prevent me helping him to escape I" she said, with a smile. " Escape He won't escape again, I'll go bail. Once get him in double irons at Port At Muir, and he's safe enough." The smile on her face seemed infectious, for his own sullen feature) relaxed, " Good-night, Sarah !" he said. She put out her hand, as if nothing had happened. " Good-night, Captain From. It's a bargain then." "A bargain." " You have a long walk home. Will you have some brandy ?" "I don't care if I do," he said, advancing to the table and filling his glass. " Here's a good voyage to you 1" Sarah Purfoy, standing watching him, burst into a single. " Human beings are queer creatures," she said, "Who would have thought that we had been calling each other games just now ; I say, I'm a vixen when I'm roused, ain't I, Maurice ?" " Romonibei' what you've promised," said he, with a hint of a threat in his voice, as he moved to the door, " You must be out of this by the next ship that leaves." "Never fear, I'll go," Getting into the cool street directly, and seeing the calm stars shining and the placid water sleeping with a peace in which he had no blind, he strove to cast off the nervous fear that was on him. The interview had frightened him, for it had made him think. It was hard that, just as he had turned over a new leaf, this foul blot should seem to stain the page. It was cruel that, having comfortably forgotten the past, he should be thus rudely reminded of it. from e-oKriNuno.J A large number of infants in this country Buys the Vail Mall, Gazette of July a new annually muddled out of the world by being what is termed "overlaid," or, in plain English, suffocated by their mothers in their beds. Very little sympathy is" bestowed on those hapless babes and although at the inquests held on their remains coroners occasionally express regret that accidents of this nature are of such frequent occurrence, no blame is, as a rule, attached to mothers for Ilma destroying their offspring. Yet there can be little doubt that these countries are easily preventable, and, moreover, that many of the suffocated babes owe their death to the drunken habits of their mothers. A remarkable instance of the tenderness displayed towards one of these erring mothers is afforded by the case of a little child aged five months, named Bunting, upon whose body an inquest was held at Holloway Head, Birmingham, on Saturday, The child was found dead in the bed with its parents one day this week, having being, according to the medical evidence, " overlaid " by its mother. The jury returned a verdict of "accidental death," but as this was the second child that Mrs. Bunting had lost in the same manner, and as that lady had been seen in the course of the day before the Bud overturn a state of inebriation, they suggested that she should receive "an ad- monition " from the coroner, who accordingly admonished her in the following feeling terms : "Mrs. Bunting," he remarked, " the jury have found a verdict of ' accidental death,' but they expressed a wish that you should hear from me the feeling they have with regard to the state you were in that night, which probably in some measure Incapacitated you in the course of the night from paying such attention to the poor child when it was overlaid as would have averted the loss you have sustained In the death of the child. However that may be, I think you would feel in the loss of this child quite infliction enough without my adding one word more, excepting to express a hope that, if you can avoid intemperance, this would be an event which would cause you to come to the conclusion what manifold and sad results may ensue from such habits. Personally I desire to say nothing by way of reproach to you, because I sympathise so much with you in your grief." Thus the matter ended comfortable for all concerned except the suffocated baby. As a stranger was yesterday knocking at the door of a house on Second-street, a boy came round the corner and enquired ; " Got anything to sell ?" " Yes, I want to sell your mother's box of toothpaste. "Might as well get off the steps," continued the boy, as a smile broke out around his mouth j "she's got store teeth, and she deans 'em with a woollen rag." EFFECTUAL Re didn't tell the young man not to come any more ; he didn't tell his daughter to discountenance her lover ; he didn't sit up nights with a shot gun, or let the fire go out in the sitting room. No, no, he knew a much better plan ; he hung out a smallpox flag every evening at dusk, and that did the business very effectual.
