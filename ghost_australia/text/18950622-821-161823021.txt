NEMESIS. [By P.] "Let them stew in their own gravy." Thus spoke Mr. Playford of the Cockburn Ministry some years ago, and it seems that the same remark would be applicable to-day. There is an inevitable day of reckoning rapidly approaching, when the funny little ways of certain politicians will require explana- tion, and apparently their enemies are content to allow the punishment so justly merited to come in the form of " consequences," as the Yankees would say. In short, the following verses probably contain the sentiment, or at least the earnest wish, of the majority of South Australians :— Let them remain, not to remove them seek, Their own misdeeds will vengeance on them wreak, And Nemesis through "consequences" speak, And so condemn. Leave them their own undoing to achieve, Their practice 'tis to shuffle and deceive, And soon or late the lash which now they weave Will fall on them. When Parliamentary day is done, and night Of dark election comes, when members' sight Sees but by dim conjecture's flickering light, Ghosts will arise— The ghosts of promises made but to break, Of a meanness which would servants' earnings take, The thirst of surplus ; featuring to slake, That they might show A semblance of that statemanship, which we In any of their actions fail to see, And hide again their own deficiency, That men may know Only the good—if any good there be— In muddling, shuffling, and autocracy, And prejudicial reciprocity. Such good, I fear, Serves but bad purposes, and does not tend Our present time of stagnant trade to mend, And should but serve to hasten on their end, Which must be near.
