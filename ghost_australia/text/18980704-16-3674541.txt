MINING. GYMPIE FIELD. THE HALF-YEARLY STATISTICS. During the half-year just closed the field passed through a period of flood, with the concomitant of dull times, due to the re- sultant stoppage of both development and reproductive work (says Saturday's Gympie .' Times"). Its natural recuperative powers, however, brought about a revival so soon as the cause of the evil was removed, and a gradual return to prosperity commenced. This, In the latter part of the half-year, developed into a boom, which, In the anxiety displayed for the acquisition of mining leases, may be characterised as phenomenal. Never before in the history of the field have the officials at the warden's office been so busy, receiving lease applications, as within the last few weeks. During June no less than twenty-four leases were applied for, with a total area of 556 acres, the rent on which amounted to £277 10s., and the survey fees to £191. For the half year 1931 acres were applied for for mining purposes, the rents for same totalling £714 16s. 8d., and the survey fees £415 10s. Ground has now been taken up to the extreme limit of the southern boundary of the goldfield, and, in addition to those already mentioned, no fewer than nine leases, of 25 acres each, or a total of 223 acres, were applied for yesterday. The " ground hunger," therefore, still continues, and a large crop of new companies have sprung up with the object of development. Of these, twenty two have been registered since the beginning of the year, with a nominal capital of £262,800, divided into 2,273,000 shares. Practically, all the ground annexed has been taken up in the south-eastern portion of the field, and the majority of the new ventures have big missions before them ere they can even expect to reach the gold-bearing country. The financing of the properties should be the chief difficulty in the future, as at the present rate It will probably take something like a quarter of a million sterling to develop them. Even, however, if an odd one here and there manages to survive the storm of financial ineptitude, should it overtake them, the result would be the permanent extension of the auriferous area of the goldfield and the opening up of gold-bearing strata at depths so far as prospected. A pleasant feature in connection with the present boom is the substantial assistance being received in the shape of foreign capital, Sydney, Brisbane, Charters Towers, and other speculators showing considerable anxiety to participate in the advantages which the field holds out in the way of investment. Other figures besides those quoted reflect the progress the goldfield has made during the half-year. For the first six months of 1898, 117 goldfields homestead leases were taken up, against 39 for the corresponding period of last year. Stamp revenue collected at the warden's office also increased from £150 10s. 3d. for the first half of 1897 to £212 15s. 6d. for the first half of 1808. Outside of this, the warden's office revenue grew from £1528 16s. 8d. In 1897 to £2310 is. 2d. In 1898, every month excepting March showing substantial increases. Last month's return alone totted up to £681 15s. 3d., against £285 5s. for June, 1897. The mills last month produced 19,29 oz. 7dwt. 20gr. gold from 11,290 tons 12cwt. of stone, against 58 oz. 2dwt. 12gr. from 4378 tons 2cwt. for the corresponding month of last year. Dividends showed at £11,777 13s. 3d., and calls at £11,002 10s., compared with £9580 15s. in dividends and £5287 Is. 8d. in calls for the previous June. For the six months ended last Thursday, compared with the corresponding period of last year, the following is cases were recorded : 20,759 tons lieu , 16,2oz. 12dwt.; calls, £13,670 18s. 10d.; dividends, £21,399 9s. 10d, Compared with the preceding six months, the first half of 1898 showed a decrease of 85350Z. 13dwt. in the production of gold, and also a falling off of £33,234 4s. 10d. in the dividend list ; but an increase of 853? tons 17cwt. in the amount of quartz crushed, besides a surplus of £10,021 3s. 10d, in the capital called up. Eighteen mines produced over 300oz. for the half-year, of which the output of no less than fourteen reached four figures. The North Smithfield was the heaviest producer, with the Columbia Smithfield, Phoenix Golden Pile, No. 4 north Phoenix, No. 1 south Great Eastern, and No. 2 Great Eastern next in order. The North Smith- field also takes precedence in the dividend list, contributing £13,723 16s. 3d. out of the total of £78,212 4s. 10d. for the half-year. The Phoenix Golden Pile occupies second place with £10,800 ; then come the Columbia Smithfield, £9590 4s.; No. 2 Great Eastern, £8950 5s.; No. 4 north Phoenix, £8500 ; No. 1 south Great Eastern, £8362 4s.; No. 5 north Phoenix, £6000, and others not quite so prominent. In field operations, the half-year has been by no means bare of important developments, the chief of which was in the No. 1 north Oriental and Glanmire, which has given the principal incentive to the present boom. This property has gone up in value from 4s. 7d, per share at the beginning of the year to 26s. 9d. last night. Lately attention has been pretty well concentrated on the Oriental group of mines, and properties, gilded with the promise of golden favours, which the name portended, sprang into existence and were eagerly snapped up by the public. Outside the boom area, also, development and reproductive work have gone on most satisfactorily during the half year, and with excellent results, which are likely to continue on during the remainder of the year. The No. 2 south Great Eastern, Columbia Smithfield, No. 2 Great Eastern, South Glanmire and Monkland, Phoenix Golden Pile, Oriental and Glanmire, and No. 4 north Phoenix have all made substantial progress, while other and smaller improvements, noted as they occurred, have helped to keep alive the spirit of speculation and rekindle hope for the future. Following are the statistics of the field for the half year The June dividends were No 2 south Great Eastern, Is., £2400 ; Phoenix Golden Pile, is., £2400 ; North Smithfield, 9d., £1790 Is. 3d.; No. 2 Great Eastern, le., £1790 is.; Columbia Smithfield, le., £2397 11s.; No. 4 north Phoenix, 6d., £1000 ; total, £11,777 13s. 3d.

MINING MANAGERS' REPORTS. Raff's Great Western, No Liability, June 13\. On lease No. 126 there is, so far as I have yet found, no indication of the existence of any other mode than that on which the present workings are being carried on. There is, however, still a probability of other lodes running through the area which do not crop out on the surface. These remain to be discovered in the future by j crosscutting from the main shaft at a ! depth. The lode at present being operated | on has been proved to continue for a con i siderable distance, both by the outcrop and so arts sunk east and west of your leasehold. It has been proved in your mind to a depth of 127ft., where the footwall reef is about I 7ft. 6in. in width, and the hanging-wall reef 1 is about 20in., making about 9ft. I of crushing stuff, the average width from the surface to the bottom level being about 7ft of quartz, which from the nature of the reef will easily and cheaply be worked. There exist good Doors from 2ft. to 3ft. apart, so that when once stoping is started very little blasting will be required, the stone being easily loosened with crowbars-, In fact, six men ought to keep ten head of stampers supplied. The gold in the stone is of a fine nature, but free milling, and as it is found in connec- thou with iron and pyrites the payable stone I can be easily separated from the poorer portions of the reef, which consist of a milky white quartz almost free from metal or oxide stains, and occur in bundles between the floors. The quality of the stone improves at the deeper levels, the stone at 127ft. level showing more mineral than that near the surface. There is at present sufficient stone in sight to keep twenty head of stampers going for a considerable time with out any further sinking, but it will be necessary to sink a main shaft further south to work the mine below our present bottom level. As I have great faith in the prospects of the deeper levels I would recommend that as soon as possible after the crushing machinery is fairly at work this be proceeded with. The ground being good for sinking It should not be an expensive undertaking, SS with good men accustomed to single-hand work the progress should not be less than 60ft. per month. In connection with the reef at the 127ft. level I may add that in the gangue between the hanging-wall and football reefs there is a quantity of quartz leaders, from which in later tests I have got fair prospects, although first samples only gave fine traces of gold. With regard to lease No. 160, which lies to the south of and adjoins lease No. 129, very little work has been done. Two trenches have been cut, and disclose a reef running parallel with that in lease No. 120. A shaft has been sunk 30ft. in depth on the south of the reef, but is not deep enough to cut the formation. I fail to find any gold in the stone taken out of the trenches, and from a shaft some distance further east on an abandoned lease I met with no better success. In conclusion, I believe that, although there has been no very rich stone met with, yet from the even distribution of the gold through the ore and the large body of easily worked stone to be operated on, your mine will prove capable of keeping a large number of stampers profitably engaged, and that the richest portion of your property lies below any yet opened up, as so far no prospecting has been done below the water level, either in your shaft or any of the neighbouring leases Menzies Lady Sherry G.M. Company, June 16\. All operations have been confined to working from what is known as A shaft. Stoping has been continued from 115ft. level and taken out 60ft. in length by 14ft. in height. Quartz so far maintains a fair average width of about 16in., in which a little gold is seen at every breaking down. A good deal of shilling timber has been put in also, and rails laid down in level so that a trolley for the buckets can be used. At B shaft we have put ladders in from top to bottom for the purpose of a travelling way. This was necessary through A shaft, the former travelling road, being now skidded. There has been broken and raised 30 tons of quartz, making 50 tons in paddock. Start, crushing to-morrow. At main shaft very good headway has been made with the woodwork necessary for brace, &c.; The poppet- legs are ready for hauling into place which, weather being favourable, will most likely be done on Sunday next. Nearly all the rest of timber has been cut and got ready to put in place, so that during the incoming fortnight most of the principal work will be done, enabling us to get into the shaft and resume sinking at no distant date. Black's New Zealand G.M. Company, July 1\. Since last resort crosscut over break above the 150ft. level has been driven 25ft. total, 43ft Country Is good black slate. Quartz on the break is small, and has taken a sharp rise to the east, with good heads taking the proper course of a reef. Have also driven south along the break where we got the gold first ; there is 8in. to 10in. of crushing stuff with a little gold In It. Have lowered the water in the shaft 22ft. total from surface, 270ft. Have made very slow progress with the water this fortnight, as we had a lot of trouble with the shaft. If everything goes on all right we should have the water out this fortnight and get ready to rise for the state that the South O'Donohue are working on. Dunn Kelland G.M. Company, July 4. Since last report have been raising crush- ing stuff from the eastern reef, and also from winze north and south. Eastern reef still keeps about same size, and carries a little gold. The drive north from the winze has been put in 8ft., and the last shots disclosed about 2ft. of crushing stuff in good country ; the quartz carries good gold. South drive has also been put in 5ft. Reef is small in this drive, but it appears to make bigger higher up. I have culled some very good stones from both drives. During last fortnight I have raised about 30 tons, and there is about 60 tons in paddock. I intend putting on all hands | to raise quartz from the winze, and will be ready to crush during the ensuing fortnight. The ghost of Wagner will hover over the Paris Exhibition of 1900, says an English contemporary, and grin horribly a Jealous grin. One of the novelties is to be a gigantic trumpet. This will measure 300ft. in length. The blowing of the instrument will be done by machinery, and a pair of lips modelled after those of a man will control the volume of air that will sweep tornado-like through them into the great horn. Gigantic bellows operated by electric engine will furnish the stream of wind. Japan ranks sixth in population, being surpassed only by China, India. Russia, the United. States, and Germany,
