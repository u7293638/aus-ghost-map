She shielded him from every possible annoyance, and omitted" nothing that might; save him trouble. or prevent him from being overtired, or that might alleviate the many discomforts of his ill-health. I hesitate to speak thus freely of a thine eo, saored as the life-long devotion wham prompted all this constant and tender care. Bnt it iay I repea^ a prindpil feature of his life that for nearly forte years he never knew one day of the health of ordinuy men, and that thus his life; was one long struggle ag&inBt; the weariness and strain' of ; Mdcnees. And this cannot be told without speaking of the one condition which enabled him to bear the strain and fight out the struggle to the end." . . . The work which Charles Darwin gave to the world was done chiefly In the healthful open air. No book of MB but' represents,. as well aa the time spent in the writing and revision, always more or lees of task work, many more hours face to face with nature. Always trying experiments, anfl especially fond of difficult ones, when the chances were a ffioosand to one against euccesa ; always observing the plants and Him*!*, and especially the humbler and more minute species; it is to Mb Regular walks, taken in all weathers, and fptll oT intellectual interest that he owed the measure of health be itiatntalned.! With regard tozeadingsand writing,'lbs.-' Darwin aoted as his amenueraiji f or moet of his oerrespondence, and the newspaper and books of pure aoenoe were all that he read for himself. HXstozy, travels, biography, and novels were always read aloud to him during Ids rest time. He ww extremely fond of novels. Hes .took a vivid Interest in plot and character, and would on no acccmnt know beforehand how a etory < finished. - Look* ing at the end he considered a feminine vice. Yet he enjoyed those of' which he knew the end in a legitimate way, for tie never tired of his . old favourites. jOTalter. Scott, Miss Austen, and- Mrs. Gaakell were read and re-read till they co a Id be read no more. His love of all living creatures made the question of vivisection a hard one for him, but he believed that ao nmch benefit, for man lower animal t^at he could not join Miss Cbbbe's paity. TJcder limitations, and , With the employment of arjaesthetics, wherever t^.e nature of the experiment allowed it, he sanctioned the practice.
