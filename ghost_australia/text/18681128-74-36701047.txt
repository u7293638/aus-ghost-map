TI{E POPE'S APOSTOLIC LETTER. RoME, Sept. 30. The following is the text of the apostolic latter addressed by the Pope to all Protestant and non-Catholic bodies: Pies, Sovereign Pontiff, Ninth of the Name, to all Protestants and other non-Catholics. Yo' must already all know that we, who I despite our unworthiness, have been raised to the throne of Peter, and therefore have been advanced to the supreme government of the 4 whole Catholic Church and to its adminis tration, which has been entrusted to us in 1 Divine fashion by Christ Himself, our Lord we have judged it fitting to summon before as all our venerable brethren, the bishops ofI all the world, and to convene them in an I mncumenical council, which is to be celebrated t next year in such a manner that, with those same venerable brethren who have been sum moned to take part in this the subject of our solicitude, we may be able to adopt all theo most opportuna and necessary resolutions to dissipate tile shadows of so largo a number of pestilential errors which daily are extending their power and license to the great prejudice of souls, and daily more and more to catab lish and strengthen among the Christian peoples committed to our watchful care tire reign of the true faith, of justice, and of the true peace of God. Relying, then, with a firm confidence upon tire close and affection ate bond of union which unites those our same venerable brothers to cur person and to tihe apostolic see, and who have never ceased at any period of our pontificate to give to os and to the apostolic see the most striking evidences of tfith, of love, and of respect, we truly hope that, as it has been in times past with other general councils, so it may be in tile present, and that this cocumon-I ical council convoked by us may bring forth, with tie help of tile Divine grace, the most rich and most fertile fruits, to the great glory of God and the eternal welfare of man. Therefore, in that hope, and inetiated and encouraged by the charity of our Lord Jesus i Christ, who laid down his life for the salva- t tion of tire world, we cannot forbear, on the I occasion of the meeting of the next council, addressing our apostolic and paternal word to a all those who, while recognising that sames Jesus Christ as our Saviour, and rejoicing in the name of Christians, yet still do not profess I the veritable faith of Christ, or follow the communion of the Catholic Clurch. And if we do no, it is bolbre all, to warn, exhort, and supplicate them with all our zeal and all our charity to consider and seriously examine if I they in truth follow the path prescribed by our Lord Jesus Christ, and which leads to I eternal happiness. In fact, no one can deny or doubt that Jesus Christ himself, in order that all future human generations should enjoy c the fruit of his redemption built up hero below his church in the person of Peter, that is to say, the church, one, holy, catholic and t apostolio-and that He granted to him all the v necessary power in order that the faith should c be preserved intact and entire, and that the same faith should be transmitted to all peoples, to all races, and to all nations in such a man- I nor that all men should be able to be united in his mystical body in baptism, and always to I preserve in themselves until the entire development that now lilo of grace without which no one can ever merit or obtain life of grace without which no one can ever merit or obtain life eternal, so that the same church which constitutes the mystical body shall re main, until the. end of time, firm and in destructible in its own constitution, developed in vigour, and furnishing to its children all that is necessary for life eternal. Now, whoever wishes well to consider and examine with attention the different religions societies divided among themselves, and sepa rated from the Catholic Church, which, since the time of the Lord Jesus Christ and His c apostles, has always uninterruptedly exercised, t and still exercises, by means of its legitimate a pastors, the power entrusted to her by our t Lord himself-whoever, we say, shall thus c examine, will easily convince himself that not t one of those religious societies, nor all thereli- t gions societies together, constitutes, or in any r way can be considered as the one and only I Catholic Church which our Lord Jesus Christ founded, constituted, and desired-should see that they cannot in any way be regarded as a member or as a part of that same church, be asnso they are visibly separated from all Catholio unity. As, in oact, those societies are deprived of that living authority established by God, who pointed out to maukind, before all things, the matter of faith and the rule of morality, who directed and presided over them in all things affecting their eternal wel fare, therofore those societios themselves con stantly varied in their doctrine, and thus this instability is unceasing. Every one can easily comprehend that this state of things is altogether opposed to the Church 'established by Christ our Lord-a Church in which the 'truth must always rest unaltered,, without being the suhject of any change,.as oi charge entrusted to that same church in order that silo may preserve it in all its integrity, a charge, for' the care of which the presence of the Holy Ghost and itsaid has been granted for over to this Church. No ono can Ignore'the fact that these differ ences of dootrine and'opinion'give rise to the social soahisms, and that therefrom spring those innumerable sects and communions which are daily increasing to the detriment of Chris tian and civil society. Whoever, in faot, recognises religion as tihe foundation of human society cannot roluseo to nltmit and avow the inflluence exercised over Civilised society by those divisions and dil agreements of prinolples of that nature, and of' religious Eoolties strugigling onl with tile other; and also with what power the deninl of authority established by God to regulnto theo covioLions of the human intelligenoce, and to direct the actionis of' men both in their social and privato life, has excited, hbe developed, and lihas fomented thos most unfortunito troubles, those events, and thoseo disturbances wvhich ogitato and effect altnost all notions ii a most doplorable man nor. Therefore, in order that all thoso who are not instilled with the principleo of the unity and truth of the Catholic Church should Osizu tihe occasion offered to themn by this council, in which the Catholic Church, to which their ancestors belonged, shows a proof of its complete unity, of its vigor, and of its unoxtinguishablo vitality ; that they bhould obey the necessities of their hearts ; that they should strive to bear themselves away from that otato in which they cannot be assured of their salvation ; That they should address without coeasing thi most fervent prayers to God that lie should dlissipato the cloud of error, and that IHe should bring them back into the bosom of the Church, our Iholy mother, whore their ancestors received the eslutary nourishment of life, and alone preserves in its integrity the doctrine of Jesus Christ, handing it down and dispeonsing the mysteries of celestial grace ; Wo, therefore, who ought most zealously to fulfil all thile duties of a good pastor, in accord ance with the chargo of our apostolic ministry, entrusted to us by Christ our Lord Himseolf, and who ought to embrace all men in the world in our paternal charity, we address this letter to all Christians separated from us-a letter in which we exhort and suppli anto them to hasten to return to the fold of Christ. It is because wo heartily desiro their salva tion in Jesus Christ, and fear one day to have to render an account of their soul to that sameo Jesus Christ, our Judge, if weo do rot point out to them and open to theor as much as is in as the way which they must follow if they would gain their salvation. Also, in all our prayers and supplications, and while performing nacts of grace, we never cease humbly to ask for them, both by night and day, the celestial light and the abundance of grace from the eternal Pastor of souls. And whereaos, despite our unworthiness, we fulfil upon earth the functions of the vicar of Christ, we await with open arms the return of those wandering sons to the Catholic Church, in order that we may ha able to receive them with all affection into the dwelling of the celestial Father, and make them participitors in Ills everlasting treasure. It is that much-wished for return to the troth and communion of the Catholic Church upon which depends not only the salvation of each one in particular, but of the whole: Chrilstian society ; and the world will never enjoy true peace until It forms one flock under one pastor. Given at Home, at St. Peters, Sept. 13, 1869, in thwenty-third year of our pontificate.
