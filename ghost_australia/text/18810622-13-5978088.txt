PARLIAMENT. LEGISLATIVE COUNCIL, Tuesday, June 21. The President took the chair. shortly after half-past 4 o'clock THE REFORM BILL A message was received from the Lipari tive Assembly, stating that the Governor had recommended alterations in the Reform Bill (in reference to the holding of elections, so ), which alterations had been aged to by the Assembly On the motion of Mr Reid, the House concurred with the Assembly in the amendment Mr REID said that the Attorney-General would bring in a bill on the first day of next session for the preparation of the rolls which would be required under this act In reply to Mr MacBain, Mr REID said that they would have to work under the old rolls until the new rolls were ready Sir CHARLES SLADEN was informed by the Attorney-General that the bill for preparing the rolls for the elections of September, 1882 was prepared, but time did not permit of its being dealt with this session, as it my oh ed some nice points which would require consideration He was quite satisfied with the assurance of the Attorney-General that the bus would be proceeded with at the beginning of next session He knew that special legislation would be required to bring on the elections in September, 1882, and it was better that the subject should be dealt with deliberately next session than in a hurried manner at the close of this session LAND TAX AMENDMENT BILL The debate on the second reading of this bill was resumed. Mr. CAMPBELL thought it was the duty of every member to express his opinion on the impolicy of the existing land say About the impolicy of the present bill they were al- agreed It had been pretty clearly shown that the bill dealt with a matter of public policy, and was not a mere revenue bill The House, therefore, had full power to express an open ton upon it. He would not hesitate to vote against a money bill if he considered it a bad hiM, and likely to be injurious to the country In this case, however, they were entitled to consider the question on its merits as one of public policy They had been told that it they had rejected the original Land Tax Bill, there would have been a revolution He denied that there was any ground for the statement Public opinion went no further than to declare that had ought to be taxed He for one was quite agreeable that it should be taxed But he had a better opinion of the intelligence of the people of this country than to suppose that they Every expected that the iniquitous tax proposed by the Government of the day would become law It amounted to a confiscation of one fourth of the property of most of the landon ners The majority of the men subjected to the tax acquired their land in a fair and legitimate way For his own part, any property he acquired had been previously put up to auction, and nine tenths of it were passed in without a bid The Government of the day could not sell it at first, and were glad to find purchasers afterwards They were told that the poor men were run out of the auction rooms by the leviathan squatters As a matter of fact, almost the only persons who bought the land on its being put up to auction were those who wanted 20 and 60 acre allotments and 99 lOOths of the lots were passed in without an offer He could not understand on what principle confiscation could be defended in this country, in his own country, in 1745 many confiscations took place, but the owners of the forfeited estates were engaged in rebellion Here a man was punished for having been successful in life The tax was directed at men who had been upwards of 23 years in the country, and had had more to do with its development than any other class These were the men held up to scorn by demagogues who had no interest whatever in the country He hoped to see the tax amended If all lands were fairly taxed the amount of the tax, as far as individual owners were con crned, would be insignificant No one would feel it, not even the small holders If we had a statesman at the head of public affairs the tax would be altered, but the government was in the hands of men who pondered to the passions of public meetings which were generally led by some leather lunged demagogue The reform question was settled, and peace was supposed to have been secured, but there had been no recovery in the value of property A rivers in the press had much to do with the state of opinion here, and he believed they were to blame, in some respects, for the existing land tax Some hon. members of the s House were very much led by articles in the newspapers Perhaps they ought to be, in a measure but many writers had but a temporary interest in the country, and they did not see further than other people A land tax like that in force in England where all head was taxed, would not be objection- able But the Government had applied the principles of the income tax to the land tax, paid there was no analogy between the two A man might own a large property, and yet that property might be burdened with a mortgage By the time he had paid the amount due to the mortgagee and the land tax, he might be left no better off than a beggar On the other hand there were large capitalists who owned very little land, end were exempted altogether from taxation In some of the new American States, there was a tax that applied to all sorts of property, land and houses stock, mills, &c; It amounted to about a half per cent and no one felt it Confidence prevailed, and that country progressed rapidly An initiators tax had been in operation here for the last four years, and we had depression landowners had lost heart, and would not go on with improvements, and the consequence was that working men were thrown out of employment In this way our loss of population was partly accounted for The land tax indirectly had been a great blow to the interests of the working classes as well as to the small holder Only 800 individuals out of over c'f0 COO paid the tax-not one in 1000 There was supported by men of so called liberal views, but their only liberality consisted in paying money out of other peoples pockets into their own If the members who voted for the tax had foreseen its effects he believed they would have opposed it Very few of them were subject to the tax themselves This amending bill would aggravate the effects of the original tax Mr CUMMING believed that the system of classification contained in the 7th and 8th clauses of the bill would break down the measure Very much would depend on the period of the year the classifier paid his visit H a property happened to have been for some time understocked and the classifier found it well grassed he would be led to place it in too high a loss Provision was made for assessing the capacity of the land according to the number of ewes and lambs found upon it, but apparently cows and calves or horses and foals, were not to be similarly counted The amended tax would fall heavily on estates now in the fourth class, to be here after placed in the sixth, seventh, or eighth classes There was on estate of 7,000 acres, on which the present tax came to £53 5s The area exempted was 200 acres Under the bill, 1 200 acres only would be exempt, and the tax would be £113 153 , an increase of 133 per cent. He knew of a property of 1,000 acres in the Western district. It was leased at £1,000, or 5s an acre It supported a widow and family of five children The present tax was £13 equal to 13 per cent on the rental Under the bill the amount would be £223 loa , which would swallow up a very large proportion of the in come The bill would effect a large increase in the amount of the taxes paid on small estates now in the fourth class but to up pear in classes 0, 7 or 8 under the bill A few cases would show how largely the bill would enhance the amount of the tax On one estate, the sum now paid was £3 Gs and the amount under the bill, J the estate was put in class 7, would be 217 6s 4d and £37 17s if put in class 0 On another estate 6s 10d was paid at present, under the bill the rate would be £10 17s 4d for class 7 or £31 18s 6d for class G On a third estate of 2 511 acres the present tax was 2s 10d , under the bl" it would be £10 12s for class 7, and £31 10s 6d for class G If the 17 small estates, of which these were examples, were placed in class 7 under the hill, the tax would be increased by CO? per cent , of in class 0, it would be in creased by 1 003? per cent. The whole of them wore Iobbthan 3,000 acres in extent, and no one would pretend to say that they were unreasonably large His own view of the matter was that if the tax were amended as proposed by the bill it would produce a re tongue not of £200,000, but of £300 000 a year As the Government only professed to desire to raise £200,000 by the tax, he should like to know whether they would remit the extra £100 000 if the act brought in £300,000 This House was supposed to be a check upon hasty legislation, but from the confession of some members, that they were sorry they voted for the original land tax, he was afraid that the Council was not so effective a check upon ill-considered legislation as it had been supposed to be Mr BELCHER explained that he voted for the first bill thinking that it would be the thin end of the wedge for the imposition of an all round land tax. Since then, however, he had found that he had been woefully mia taken, and he now regretted the vote which he gave The tax was admittedly for the purpose of bursting up large estates, and was unjust in principle The amending bill only aggravated the evil, and he therefore could not vote for the measure Mr SUMNER said he also voted for the original bill under the impression that it would be followed by an equitable distribu- tion of the incidence of taxation on all kinds of realised property. As to the Amending Bill he could not see how the House could entertain such a monstrous proposal for one moment Mr BUCHANAN said the bringing for ward of such an amending bill as the one before them was like the pouring of water on a drowned rat The present tax was ruinous enough, but if it were altered as proposed, it would then fall on men who were not intended to be taxed when the original act was passed He would just mention a few cases to illustrate what the effects of the bill would be One poor estate in his own district would be confiscated altogether The owner of another farm-a man who had purchased between 300 and 400 acres, had lived on it for 30 years, had reared a large family, and had recently purchased two additional paddocks which brought his property under the bill', yet if he died to morrow he would not leave £300 to his children Why should men like these be held up to opprobrium as over Teachers of their fellow men by being compelled to pay a penal tax Another estate of 7,000 acres in his (Mr Buchanan's) district was put up for sale 25 years ago, and there being no purchaser, it was taken up at £1 per acre Owing to the poor quality of the land, the estate had changed hands several times The rent was only £130 per annum, and under the amend- ing bill the 7,000 acres would have to bear a ter of at least £114 11s In his (Mr Buchanan s opinion such a measure would never have seen the light of day had all the country constituencies returned representatives to another place who were interested in paid conversant with country fairs, instead, as was the case in a number of instances of electing city men who cared for nothing but position and emoluments Sir CHARLES SLADEN said he felt that it was very little use prolonging this discus J stop He might rather call it a conversation, because it could scarcely be termed a discussion, when there was nobody to argue against In one respect it was the most remarkable debate that had ever occurred in that House for even the hon. member who was responsible for the introduction of the bill was unwilling to say one word in its favour, and all the speakers had condemned the measure Very little was now left to be said The subject had been debated with considerable ability, and criticised with a great deal of practical knowledge The facts which had been adduced tended to show how very much adrift the person or persons who framed the bill must have been no (Sir Charles Sladen) had never seen such a jumbled up affair, or a display of so much thorough ignorance of the subject dealt with It also appeared to him that those who framed the bill must have been as indifferent as they were ignorant But he would I decline to go into what was called the amending bill To call it an amending bill was a perversion of the term, for it was a measure that aggravated the evils which underlay the first act That original act was the most vicious piece of legislation ever put on the statute book of any country in the world. If the tax had been purely for revenue purposes it would have been based on wrong principles altogether It, for instance, violated this first principle that taxation should be imposed upon everybody in exact proportion to the amount of property and income they enjoyed under the protection of the Government in proof of this it was only necessary to say that instead of 2,000 persons being taxed as was originally intended, experience had proved that the tax had to be borne by only 800 Even if it had fallen on the 2,000, that would have been bad enough, but as it had turned out about 800 individuals were selected out of 48 000 owners of property to bear the ruin ously heavy tax '1 bia was a system that was altogether contrary to the principles laid down by all political economists Now, how ever hon. members were told that the tax was not for revenue purposes, but that it was imposed as a matter of public policy in order to prevent the aggregation of large estates But, be it how small, if it was not for revenue purposes it must be considered in the light of a penal tax and what could be more unjust than to say that men must suffer a penalty which was not in the statute book when they committed the alleged offence " Had this question been dealt with in any other country, due notice would have been given that after a stated period any person acquiring more than a certain number of acres would be liable to a certain tax or penalty If that course had been adopted in this colony, no one could have complained Not only, however, was it not followed here, but numbers were offered special induce- ments to acquire land, and now that they had done so, they were oppressed without cause or reason This was legislation of a most unwise kind, for it was directed altogether against the advancement of the colony. The principal act was so unjust that it could not be amended It was not only radically wrong, but also wicked in principle, and ought to be got rid of Head been a citizen of this country for 40 years, and like others of his class was getting into the vale of years Having endeavoured to be good and true citizens in their time were they now to find that all their toil had simply placed them in the position of a butt for the discontented and disaffected of those who had nothing, or not much to lose, and whose object was to array class against class, and to secure for themselves power and influence by appealing to the passions of the people (Hear, hear.) He was reading the other day what he had said on this same question in 1877, and was surprised to find how prophetic he had been His words on that occasion were - "There is no doubt that the imposition of a tin of this kind will result in a central or at least a partial, depreciation of property What edict is that depreciation have upon the country commercially, or, if you prefer the word pecuniarily? The only difference I can draw is that capital will be deterred from investment in the colony Why? Because people who invest capital prefer to do so where there is adequate security for property, and where consequently they have full confidence that their interests will meet with consideration and justice, instead of injustice and arbitrary taxation I say that the tax will deter 1 cope with capital from coming here to invest It, whether it will frighten the present holders of property here is another thing Doubtless the effect of the tax will be to depreciate property to such an extent as to make its owners find that to dispose of it will in also a larger sacrifice than they are prepared to make They will remain in the country but will have no confidence in It A stop will be put to all on torpriBc, energy), and Industry These remarks had turned out to be only too true, and he had taken the liberty of reading them again to hon. members in justification of the course he was about to ask the House to adopt It was impossible to draw too much attention to the principle which under lay the species of legislation under notice, for it was a species that ought to be discouraged as warmly as possible. The people ought to be able to see the difference between what was honest and what was dishonest One of the worst effects of the land tax was the demoralisation which it caused throughout the country, and that was a very serious thing in a young country like this, as it entailed the necessity of the rising genera- tion being brought up in the worst of atmospheres Young people should not be allowed to see wrong-doing without efforts being made to overcome them The land tax was not only inequitable in its incidence, but even supposing an owner of an estate was anxious to carry out its avowed object, viz , * to cut up his estate, he could not do so be cause his property was depreciated, not only by the amount of the tax it had to bear, but also in consequence of the extreme distress which existed in the minds of those who might buy as to what changes might here- after take place Again, supposing the tax was just and fair in its operation, sufficient stress had not been laid on the fact that it is far too high It amounted to from 11 per cent to 22 per cent upon the net income arising from the land, and there were not many landed estates in this colony that paid more than 6 per cent on the capital invested The landholders here were already heavily enough handicapped by the competition of New South W ales and South Australia, where the land was cheaper without any penal tax. Moreover, it had been shown that the tax would yield nearly double what was 636 mated, and this was another proof that those who framed the measure could not have had any knowledge of the subject. He (Sir Charles was glad to find that hon members who voted for the first bill had soon reason to regret their action, and he hoped that, although their penitence had come very late, it sprang from a sincere conviction, and that such errors would not occur in the future He would now read a few reasons which he conceived were quite sufficient for objecting to the land tax " 1 Because, under the pretence of raising revenue, the taxIs in violation of the first of the four maxims or principles laid by Adam Smith, and universally" accepted by political economists, viz - ' The subjects of every state ought to contribute to the support of the government r_ nearly as possible in proportion to their respective abilities, that is, in proportion to the revenue which they respectively enjoy under the protection of the state In the observation or neglect of this maxim emulate what is called the equality "t inequality of taxation ' "2 Because the tax is really not imposed for revenue purposes (as publicly declared by the Chief Secretary and the Attorney-General and no tax for other than revenue purposes should be imposed with out due notice being first given of such Invention "3 Bccat so the tar, contrary to all principles of justice, In imposed upon the land of only 828 out of over 48 000 owners of freehold property, whilst the great bulk of other kinds of realised property is free from taxation "4 Because in the words of J S Mill)'futuro buyers would acquire land at a reduction of price equivalent to the peculiar tax, which tax they won 'd therefore escape from paying, while the original possessors would remain burthened with it, even after parting with the property since they would have sold their land at ales of value equivalent to the fee simple of the tax Its imposition would thus be tantamount to the confiscation for public uses of a percentage of their property equal to the percentage laid on their income by the tax " 5 Because It tends to lower the moral of the colony generally "0 Because it has sown the seeds of distrust as to the future and has destroyed that copIJciico in the abiding assembly of property which, especially in a new car ntry, ought rather to have been encouraged, and the effect hPS boon to put a stop to Implements, and throw thousands out of employment. And, more over, It has rendered country lands i marketable so that an owner Mialling to break up his property can only do so at a ruinous sacrifice ' 7 Because its Injustice has deterred, and will continue to deter, capitalists from any stand the r money here and therefore the tax is opposed to Vie progress in wealth and importance of this colony and every one in it.' Hon members should never allow themselves to be placed again in the position they occupied in 1877 It was a very great misfortune that a majority of them on that occasion committed themselves to the vote which placed the land tax on the statute book for the effect of the tax had been most disastrous and it would continue to be so for years to come He moved that all the words after "That' in the original motion be omitted, with the view of inserting the following - "That this Council, whilst recognising the" justice and policy of imposing a tax upon land if of other realised property be taxed at the same time, regret! that It is i unable to concur in the principles and pro v Unions of this bill, and that this bill be read a road time this day six months The amendment was carried without further discussion and without a division, the result being the virtual rejection of the bill NEGLECTED CRIMINAL CHILDREN'S ACT AMENDMENT BILL Dr HEARN moved the second reading of this measure, and briefly explained its object Sir CHARLES SLADEN pointed out that as the bill repealed the latter part of the 10th section of the original act under which the schools for neglected criminal children were established, these institutions would cease to exist legally unless special provisions to prevent that result were inserted in the measure Mr FITZGERALD thought the house was indebted to Sir Charles Sladen for drawing attention to the oversight which appeared to have been made If on inquiry the bill was found to require amendment, it could be altered in committee The bill was read a second time, and committed pro forma ADJOURNMENT The House adjourned at 20 minutes to 7 o'clock until the following (this) day LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY. Tuesday, June 21 The SPEAKER took the chair at half-past 1 o'clock THE REFORM BILL A message was received from the Legislative Council stating that they did not now insist on retaining the words " and fifty in the qualification clause of members of the Council in the Reform Bill, and that they also did not insist on retaining clause in, referring to having two Ministers in the Council A message was also received from His Excellency the Governor recommending certain amendments in the Reform Bill that were considered necessary to carry out the alterations made in the bill, with the view of holding all the Council elections on one day Mr VALE moved that the amendments be agreed to The motion was carried HISTORY OF THE CRISIS Mr DOW said he had on important matter to bring before the House, and in order to enable him to do so, would conclude his remarks with a motion It would be admitted by hon. members that the history which was manufactured there should be correctly manufactured, but on so simple a matter as to how the reform question came to be settled he found that parties could not agree There was a difference as to who were the victors in the contest, Some very important matters had been ignored by a section of the press, and 63 these matters had brought about a settlement of reform, he wanted to know why they should be ignored His attention had been drawn to a paragraph in the leading journal of that day, in which some hon. members were referred to as Enchanter, and he wanted to know who they were Mr Bl N Mell, I am one Mr DOW said he was not one of them Mr M'lJy 11s You are a bull finch (Laughter ) Mr L L SMITH'S think we are all dynamiters Mr DOW continued -A caucus of Ministerial supporters was held on the previous Tuesday, and at it 27 members voted for the discharge of the Reform Bl" and 8 for a conference, but those eight were now made by a certain journal of this colony to have increased so much between the Tuesday and the following night that they settled the question, [and the men who had voted for the discharge of the bill were now said to be traitors who had changed front Sir BRYAN O'LOGHLEN Hear hear Mr DOW said those who voted for the discharge of the bill were said to have all followed Fincham, and R Fincham was the great man of the day, and his followers were called 1 inchamites (" Hear, hear," laughter, and 'So you are ) Well, they were not be, and that was the point he wanted to clear up (An Hon Member- "Take a vote on it ) The hon. member for West Bourke (Sir Bryan O O'Loghlen) brought on a vote for a conference, and the 27 members he had referred to said they would not further degrade the Assembly Unless the Canned gave some indication that they were going to meet the views of the Assembly Mr MIRAMS-And how far did the Council come towards your views? Mr DOW-When Fincham and others went for a conference it was intended to drag the Government and their supporters on their knees Mr riNCnMAN-lhat is not true you were brought to your knees afterwards by sheer force (near, hear ) Mr DOW said it was no use interrupting him. He had something to say, and it was going to be said exactly as he intended to say it Mr L L SMITH -It is all written down for him (Laughter ) Mr. DOW stated that when the motion of the hon member for West Bourke was on, they had gone as as far as they were justified in going (An Hon Member " Who do you mean ) He meant the liberal party, that went to the country on liberal principles, and we a now in the House to carry them out Mr MIRAMS - You have swallowed them Mr DOW denied that they had swallowed them, and then said that on the morning of the day when the hon member for West Bourke was asking them to go on their knees, the inspired organ of the conservative party had stud the Council would not come down any lower He had stated in his speech on the previous Wednesday night that unless the hon. member for West Bourke could show some reasonable idea of their getting the Council to consider the matter again he would suspect that his motion for a conference was not a bona-fide one, but a want of confidence motion in disguise Rumours had been made on the same Wednesday night that Mr Fincham was empowered to make a proposal to the House if they would accept a conference, but they would not have taken a proposal from Mr Fincham as Mr LONGMORE -You did take it Mr DOM said they did not take it They were told on the Wednesday night that there was a rumour that immediately the House met Fincham was to use and announce that the Council would give them certain concessions Did he rise' Mr FINCHAM. By desire of the Chief Secretary, I did not Mr. DOW continued, saying that when he spoke on the previous Wednesday night he said that if the Council would give some concessions he would be prepared to go to the conference, and Mr Ramsay, the hon. member for East Bourke, then got up and stated what concessions the Council would make. He then considered Mr. Ramsay had given a substantial guarantee for the Council, and therefore he agreed to the conference, but he found that the writer in the conservative journal that day now called him and others 1 inchamites for so doing Mr, riNCHAM-And does not the Age put you down on the salvation of the world? Mr DOW did not want to be called the salvation of the world, Mr FINCHAM -Were you the author of the article in the Agent Mr DOW continued After Mr Ramsay's speech Mr Hall, the member for Moira, went round to hon. members on the Government. Mr W M CLARK -No (Laughter, and cries of " Withdraw ) Mr DOW said the paragraph he had referred said 20members turnedrinoharaites, and yet on the previous Wednesday night it was declared as the result of Mr Hall a whip that 20 members on the Government side were in favour of a conference Now, Mr Hall went round after Mr Ramsay's speech Mr FINCHAM -No You shall have the whole of it now Mr DOW contended that it was Mr Ramsay b speech which caused hon. members to go for the conference, and then added that if some substantial guarantee had not been given that the Council would make coweS Bions hon members would have stood by the Government proposal, and would have advised them to keep to it In conclusion, he asked if it was not too bad to falsify history in the way he had pointed out (Ironical cries of Oh, and laughter ) The hon. member then sat crown The SPEAKER said he understood the hon. member said he would conclude with a motion for the adjournment of the House. He certainly never knew of the House being adjourned for any such matter as the hon member had referred to and he regretted the hon. member had taken advantage of the form for the purpose Mr DOW moved the adjournment of the House. Mr. M INTYRE could not understand what the hon member had spoken for unless it was to glorify himself in the eye on the next morning and surely the hon member ought to be satisfied with the glorifying ho cot in the Agc daily, without troubling the House as he had just done The hon mem- ber seemed to object to rinchamites but he had no objection to Dow rates or Doo ites as they would be cases in Scotland He (Mr Dow) was reported in a paragraph of last Thursday a Age as follows - Mr Do in a circumstantial an L trench it pencil run 1 that before the A embly d ceded to us 0 l road opiI to go into the conference they should be Inform ed w o wore rest ought to for making the Aesci bly re-offered to meet in conference The hon member however knew that the suggestion for a conference were made by Mr Fincham and that to Mr Fincham and him alone was due the credit or bran ing, on the arrangement for the conference Then the hon. member again in last Thursday s Age was reported as having made the telling, point of the most effective speech delivered during the debate and he (Mr McIntyre) could declare he never heard a worse speech than that of the hon member Mr Doo There were only about 17 or 18 members in the House while it was delivered and no atten- tion was paid to the speech The fact was Doo a little finger was to be seen in what appeared in the day? That journal of last 1 hureday also said Mr Dow s inquiry as to whether the cry for a conference was not a share was electrical in its effect (Laughter) We", it was like the speech so electrical that it sent the greater part of the members out of the House The Chief Secretary deserved credit for the variety of sentiments he was able to express in one evening and for asserting his son sistency at last but it was unfair for the ' Dooitea to claim the victory We had sent home champions of various kinds but he (Mr M Intyre) thought we should send the Chief Secretary home as the champion ship ter of opinions because in a few hours he could express 500 different sentiments in as many different ways The hon. member for East Bourke (Mr Ramsay) had protested against six or seven members of the Ape Staff being in the House and he (Mr M Intyre) agreed with him that the time had come for putting a stop to that sort of thine, Four years ago the Age claimed to have a circulation of 43,000 but now that number had increased by KO The public however were not told what became of those 1 a] ers He knew that large numbers were seen t into the adjoining colonies for free circulation a hen in Tasmania a short time ago he found hundreds of copies sent which were not ordered and not needed At Maldon during the election he was told of a person" he received 50 copies of that a paper for circulation in this way but instead of being, circulated they were stuck down a convenient place and left there The Age was full of leading articles all in praise of the (rent Mr Dow Mr 1 FINCHAM said that he would not have obtruded himself upon the House if an unwarrantable attack had not been made upon him by the hon. member for Kara Kara in self defence he was bound to state what actually took place in the caucus and after wards in the Ministerial room He did not intend to go to the caucus but he was told that he would be a coward if he stayed away He went and stated he was assured that a majority of the members of the Council were d stn ctly aid emphatically in favour of India upon certain i points Mr DOW -> ota bit of it Mr llNCnAM-Well the hon. member must have been deaf Mr DOW -Not a word of that was said Mr I AURF NS -Not a single word Mr llNCHaM-The result would prove which was correct He distinctly stated that he had an assurance that the Council was prepared to meet a concessions Mr LALIFNS-Not a syllabic Mr FINCHAM -It was all very well for hon. members to try and back out of it in that way but the statement was made in substance if not in the words he had just used ( No no and Yes ) Hon. members might say No but the Chief Secretary the Attorney-General, and the Ministers of Lands Education, and Railways had afterwards the same proposal in writing, They then said What authority is this' It is merely the handwriting of an individual the leader of the Opposition and what assurance have we that he has ory authority for making the state must' his (Mr Fincham's) answer was that it was impossible to get any assurance or authority beyond a private understanding, and that it was known that a majority of the Council was prepared to make the alterations which had since been conceded The following day he had several conversations with persons opposed to him in politics and was again assured that the concessions would be made Before the House met he went to the Chief Secretary, imploring him to reconsider the course he was taking in error owing to abandon the measure and urging him to retrace his steps before it was too late. The Chief Secretary replied that he could not take such a humiliating step unless at the manifest wish of his followers It was then arranged that he (Mr Fincham) should make a direct appeal to the Chief Secretary and to the leader of the Opposition when the House met and this would allow of an expression of opinion from the Ministerial for lowers The hon. member for West Bourke (Mr Deal m) would corroborate this Knowing that the hon. member for Kara Kara was going to speak early in the evening he (Mr I Fincham) asked him to give way until the question had been asked and pointed out that his remarks would be much more forcible after something definite was for mally known than before The Chief Secretary was not, however in the House when it met and he (Mr Fincham) then went and showed the Attorney-General a written authority from the leader of the Opposition that certain concessions would be made by the Council The Attorney General' looked at the terms and immediately pooh poohed them, saying-' Whatisthat? I cannot accept that I would rather serve in at once than accept it Shortly afterwards the hon. member for West Bourke (Mr Deakin) and himself (Mr Trachom* saw the Chief Secretary and retired with him into the Ministerial room and conferred there with him nearly the whole evening During this time the speech of the hon member for East Bourke (Mr Ramsay) was trade, and he repeated the 1 ointB which the Council would concede, and rJiich points had prev loudly been placed before the Chief Secretary That hon gentlemen then said he considered the hon members re Pryke a guarantee or authority that the concessions could be obtained, and he would accept the offer of a conference This was substantially what had taken place and it was the truth. The one great object which he (Mr Fincham) had throughout was to bring this miserable matter of reform to a satisfactory settlement When his name was proposed as a member of the conference, he did not wish to be an obstacle to its success, and he at once requested that it should be struck out He felt that this explanation -"as necessary, both in self defence and out of respect to his constituents and to his position as a member of the Assembly (Hear, hear ) Sir BRYAN O'LOGHLEN remarked that he much history was being written and spoken backwards, he also wished to set him self right with his constituents The hon member for Kara Kara had referred to him as having submitted the motion for a conference without being in a position to tell the House that the Council was prepared to make concessions On the contrary, he (Sir Bryan O'Loghlen) stated that the reason why he urged the _.ODeinbly to adopt the course which he proposed was because there was every probability of concessions being obtained from the Council He also indicated two of the concessions which had since been obtained, and a third which had not At the same time he wished to pay a tribute to the earliness and firmness of the hon member for Ballarat West-(cheerB)-and to support the view that he was one of the main agents in bringing about such a successful result The hon member for Moira (Mr Bolton) and the hon. member his colleague (Mr Deakin) also spoke their convictions manfully, and had their effect upon the policy afterwards adopted by the Government. Mr BERRY said it was unfortunate that the hon. member for Kara Kara had thought it necessary to bring this matter before the House he (Mr Berry) had no intention of speaking at first but the hon. member for Ballarat West had made a statement to which he felt bound to refer The hon member stated that at the caucus he made Bubatau Holly the same offer that was after wards accepted by the Government. He (Mr Berry) wished to give that a positive aerial At that caucus not a scintilla of guarantee was given that the conference then proposed would have any more value or result than previous conferences (Hear hear ) If there had been anything like a guarantee or a reasonable expectation that the bill would be passed as it had been the motion to discharge that order of the day would never have been assented to by the caucus or by the Government (Hear hear) The hon member for Ballarat West did afterwards in the House show him a paper containing substantially the amendments which the Council was said to be willing to assent to but he replied that he did not consider that a guarantee The hon. member then went to the Opposition to see what they could do Mr FINCHAM. that is not true Mr BERRY said that he did not wish to c led into a conference without a guarantee that he could secure those concessions and it was not unt I the hon member for East Bourke rose and said what he did and which was confirmed by the leader of the Opposition that he agreed to the conference The hon. member for East Bourke stated that if the concessions were not made he and a number of other members would assist the Government to discharge the bill that was the guarantee he (Mr Berry) wanted It was not what the Council would do, but what hon. members in the Assembly would do (Ministerial cheers ) Mr. MURRAY SMITH said that after the remarks of the Chief Secretary he was bound to give the House his version of the trams action Before the caucus was held he (Mr Murray Smith placed before a member of the Government two propositions which he believed the Council would agree to One was the reduction of the qualification of members from £10 to £100 and the other the with drawal of the clause with respect to the two M matter Mr BERRY -You are not speaking of me? Mr M RRAY SMITH-No but it could not be said that the Government were ignorant of the proposals to be submitted to a conference (Hear hear ) The hon. member for Ballarat West very honourably spoke to him (Mr Murray Smith) stating that he did not wish to place the Opposition or the Government in a false position and asking whether the Council would assent to the concessions to be asked for He (Mr. Murray Smith replied that he believed they would and the hon. member for West Bourke (Mr Deakin) then went and told the Chief Secretary what had taken place The Chief Secretary knew all the time that these negotiations were going on Mr BERRY -Didn 11 Bay that Mr MURRAY SMITH-The hon. gentleman said that he had no guarantee, but he had a paper in his (Mr Murray Smith s) handwriting setting forth the concessions which the Council would make Mr BERRY But suppose they had not agreed to them Mr MURK VY SMITH gave the hon. mem- bers who spoke to him his assurance that the eyes could be agreed to and they were satis fed It was not a nameless propose tion which was submitted to the Chief Secretary It was in his (Mr Murray Smith s) handwriting He was the guarantee for it and his reasons for making the pro royal were known The hon. member for East Bourke (Mr Ramsay) spoke with the best n tentions but it was not constitutional for hon members to stand up and make guarantees on behalf of the other House He (Mr Murray Smith) however was justified in pointing out privately what he believed would be done and he placed the members of the Government in possession of that information With regard to two of the proposals he told a member of the Government a week before the caucus was held that the Council would agree to them And further on the morning of the division he told the hon. member for Ballarat West and the 1 on and learned member for W seat Bourke both of whom communicated the fact and t! e authority to hon. members on the Government side It was not so much the guarantee of the hon member for East Bourke as the open and no ily opposition which those three gentlemen in the Corner made that induced the Chief Secretary to accept the proposition Mr BOLTON as one of the so called mechanised wished to say a word in the caucus Mr Tinchamdid not define the nature of the concessions to be made by the Council but he distinctly stated La had it on the best authority that the Council would give way and therefore in the interests of the country he advocated that the Government should act for another conference The hon. members for Gipps Land and Emerald bill Mr Deakin Mr Fincham and himself and in all eight voted for the conference It was a strange thing that the Chief Secretary should cbastiBO those hon. members as he did for supporting the course they advocated at the conference and it was a most extraordinary thing, that the Chief Secretary should threaten him with political extinction for adopting a course he thought to be in the interests of the House and the country He (Mr Bolton) certainly thought the country ought to be considered before party interests What position would he have seen in if he had acted against the wish of his constituents and against the course he supported at the caucus ' He would have been in the position of the man in the Biglow papers, who said In short I firmly do holley o In I umber? generally For It a a tin Ing that I holley of To have a solid vally TI Is hath my faithful Bhepl ord boon In pastures say let has! led me For li Is will keep the people (green To feed as they hay c fed me Mr MASON said that had he had an opportunity of speaking he intended to say that he was favourable to another conference He was disappointed in Mr Fincham He was at the caucus before he spoke and after he spoke Mr Fincham said just about- what he (Mr Mason) said but he gave no authoritative statement with respect to concessions from the Council At the caucus, 28 members voted for striking out the order of the day eight for the conference six for sending the bill back in its original state, and the Chief Secretary did not vote berne, chairman Mr LAURENS remarked that if Mr Fincham had stated to the caucus half as authoritatively as the hon member for East Bourke stated to the House that the Council were prepared to make concessions he would have considered it a sin not to vote for a conference Mr BARR thought it was always unwise on such an occasion to debate on which side the victory lay Individual members of the Upper House told him before the caucus that they were disposed to deal more liberally with the bill but he did not feel warranted in stating that to the Chief Secretary Mr BENT was surprised at hon members opposite professing much ignorance in this matter He had before stated in the House and it was the truth that until the Government knew they were beaten by one vote they did not consent to the conference He challenged any member on the opposite side to contradict that It was only when it was ascertained that there were 42 men prepared to to into a conference to settle this important question that the Chief Secretary thought fit to do it An Hon Member -Humbug Mr L L SMITH -It is a fact Mr BENT Was not Mr Pearson Saying one thing in the House while Mr Berry was settling it the other way behind the Speaker's chair ? (Laughter.) It was proposed by Mr Brophy that the debate be adjourned, to allow Mr L L Smith an opportunity of speaking and Mr Dow, instead of allowing Mr L L Smith to speak got up himself A great deal of the credit for the settlement of the question, if not the whole of it was due to Mr H I Smith As soon as the doctor's vote was got, up went the donkey Did not the Chief Secretary say the first night he would have it settled then ? Instead of saying what he did say afterwards would it not have been better for him to have got up and said, ' I was mistaken ? Mr BERRY -It would not be true-that is the only objection Mr BENT Mr Toohey know, for one, on that night that the Upper House was prepared to make certain concessions Mr BERRY We could not got a guarantee Mr BENT -The guarantee was known to a Minister and the leader of the Opposition Mr BERRY -It was not given Mr BENT -I will stake my seat on the truth of my statement. Mr MURRAY SMITH So will I. Mr TUCKER-Which Minister? Mr BENT would not divulge a private conversation. To the hon. member for East Bourke all credit was due for the trouble he took. (Ministerial cheers ) As to the Chief Secretary, he had voted against his own motion the other night the motion being that the bill be discharged Mr FINCHAM -It was a very manly thing to do under the circumstances Mr BENT had said that the Chief Secretary would Jump Jim Crow before 11 o'clock on the last night provided the hon. member for St. Kilda (Mr Carter) and the hon. and learned member for Normanby (Mr Shiels) could be kept in the House and so he did As to the guarantee, the hon. member for Richmond (Mr L L Smith) could have made the same statement that was made by the hon. member for East Bourke Mr FINCHAM They discussed it in the Cabinet Mr L L SMITH -Yet the Chief Secretary Said he knew nothing about it. Mr. BLNT-The Cabinet was divided He did not say the bill was worth claiming (A few cheers from both sides ). But still ' > whatever credit was due on account of the settlement of the question on be to be given to the right gentleman The bill was carried because the two sick members he had mentioned stopped in the House and because of the speech made by the hon. member for Richmond (Mr L L Smith) Richmond did not know half of what its representative (Mr. L L Smith) had done for the settlement of the question That hon. member had been guided solely by patriotism (V south from the Ministerial Be aches ) Mr L L SMITH -Can you deny it Tucker' Mr BENT-The hon. member for Moira (Mr Hall) when he was put on the right track worked hard to settle the q session The Chief Secretary admitted on Tuesday night that he intended to throw out the bill. Mr. BERRY Hear hear I admit that Mr BINT. Then how can you take credit for passing the measure ' Sir JOHN O'SHANASSY said he thought that the debate on reform had closed for the present and that the hon. member for Kara Kara would not have challenged facts which could be proved by the evidence of members and If users He (Sir John O Shanassy ) had watched the proceeding with regard to the amendment of the constitution since the time when the Chief Secretary began the agitation on the subject and had done his best to oppose the passage of any mea- sures y whomsoever it was introduced that no ated the intention of the framers of the original constitution or was outside of the lines of the British constitution If not thoroughly satisfied with the bill passed, he was pleased that other me sures had been rejected The question had been settled in such a manner as to break up party ties so far as reform was concerned Had the query be in been conducted to the bitter end as the Ministry had intended on party lines it could not have been settled (Cheers ) Hew gentlemen had renounced party ties in con now on with this question The first who spoke in favour of a compromise was the hon. member for Delatite The next gentleman who temperately urged a compromise was the hon member for Ballarat West (Mr Fincham) He rose above party in order to serve his country but was assailed by his party for so doing Yet he stood now higher in the eat nation of the country than the party which tried to coerce him The next Gentleman entitled to great praise was the hon. and learned member for West Bourke (Mr Deakin) It was most honourable for a young man in his post town to show he would not be coerced into doing what he did not believe to be rich (Opposition cheers) Those were three gentlemen who dissociated themselves from party Then there was the hon. member for Moira (Mr Bolton) with whose politics he did not "see but who of his own motion determined to go no further in the direction his party were going After supporting, the Ministry consistently for a long time they denounced him for doing what they were prepared to do five minutes afterwards The last and most important fact r in the settlement of the question was the hon. member for Richmond (Mr L L Smith) If that hon member had not at the last moment got up and declared that he intended to vote for a conference the Reform] It would have been lost that might (Or i option cheers ). That hon. member was one of the five on the Ministerial side whose defection placed the Government in a minority About the time that fact became known one of the Ministry (Mr Pearson) was addressing the House on a different line from that which his colleagues soon afterwards announced they would take As to the hon. member for Kara Kara he was doing his best to prevent a settlement unless the Council gave him a guarantee personally (Laughter ) W as anything more absurd ' Could there be a greater piece of impudence ' Mr DOW -A guarantee was given Sir JOHN O SIIANASSY -No Of course every one gave credit to the hon. member for East Bourke for his good intentions but if Kehoe member had not said a word the conference would have been held ( No ) The hon. member offered something like a guarantee but the Council repudiated having given him any authority Mr R VMSAY - Only one member said so Sir JOHN OSHANASSY Afr Cuthbert took particular care at the conference to point out that the Council had made no such promise Propositions were agreed to at the con- ference which the hon memberforBoroonlora Reid had been submitted by him some days before As soon as the fact of the 12 votes became known no speeches could be of any use Had the Ministry not given way the conference would have been carried the amendments would have been agreed to and the Ministry would now be out of office Sa the effect of the statement of the hon. member for East Bourke had probably not be what he intended As to plural voting it was the hon member for Collingwood (Mr Mirams) who first drew attention to that point, long after the Chief Secretary had said was willing to settle the question if the Council gave way on three other points In conclusion he was glad that the settlement had not been the result of party action, and that in future party ties would not be likely to interfere with the question of reform If further amendments of the constitution were desired, they would probably be ob- tained by the exercise of a better and more judicial spirit than had hitherto been evinced Mr HALL remarked that he had not gone round amongst the Ministerial supporter until he was thoroughly assured that the Council would positively make some concessions He did not hear a word from the hon. member for Ballarat West with regard to any concessions at the caucus meeting Mr UN CHAM Did not the Chief Secretary say at the caucus he would not accept any concessions unless that of plural voting was one Mr hALL knew nothing of the remark of the hon. member with regard to concessions made by the Council until that day When he saw a chance of a successful conference he did his best to bring it about He did n't want to detract from anyone's credit There had been a glorious victory and they all ought to shake hands upon it instead of be grudging one another any little credit that might be due Mr MACGREGOR denied that at the caucus the concession made known through the hon member for East Bourke were spoken about in his opinion the Chief Secretary the Opposition and those who voted with the Ministry all deserved credit for the result obtained Mr LONGMORE did not intend to take advantage of the present motion to continue the debate about the action on the Reform Bill but he desired to draw the attention 1 the Chief Secretary to certain oxpresaioitj-in a leading article in the Age on Monday last, to which he (the Chief Secretary) seemed to be committed The expression were as follow - ... TI of 61 Icf Secretary, of of i probably did not forgot the suspicious ally notion of the city lands on the Yarra bank which took place in der like (Mr Long more 8) administration refused to take him back into 1 Is Cabinet because as he has sir ce publicly declared he was perfectly useless and In 1 Is way Now, he asked the Chief Secretary whether the Government did not agree with him in the alienation of that land Mr BERRY -So far as I remember, the Government were at one with the hon member in regard to the alienation of that Mr LONGMORE was glad the Chief Secretary remembered the matter so far as to do him justice Now, be also desired to ask the Chief Secretary if he had informed the writer, of that article that he (Mr Longmore) was perfectly useless in the Cabinet, and in his way. Mr BERRY was understood to say that whatever he had said about the hon member had been in his (Mr Longmore s) presence Mr MIRAMS He said you were a silent member of the Cabinet Mr LONGMORE Well, I might agree with him about that. (Laughter ) AnHdN Member.- You are not silent in the House at all events Mr LONGMORE said he would take it for granted the Chief Secretary had said nothing of the sort about him as was written in the leading article, and that he was perfectly justified in concluding the writer had no foundation for his statement. The Age was to a certain extent printed for a party in that House, but to a greater extent it was printed for profit He had nothing to say to the Age or The Argus, but they should not have men who would put down barefaced lies without putting their names to them. The writer in the Age had referred to him as Iiav ng a scrofulous tongue but he could say the writer was not the man who should charge any one with evil practices Mr M COLL said he was told last week, before the debate on the conference took place that Mr Bent Mr Cooper, and an other hon. member had gone round to the members of the other House to see if they could get them to consent to any concessions, and at the caucus they were told that not the b' ghtcBt encouragement in that direction had been obtained from the other House He changed his views about the conference be cause he believed what Mr Ramsay had said Mr. TUCKER It remarked that the other evening he assumed the role of a prophet He proposed that the Council a bill would be passed, and that had taken place, and He also said the Land Tax Bill would H rejected elsewhere, and that had i rred He would now ask what were p Sembly going to do after this last reo q1 Were they now gone to say as Mr Toots did when ladies constantly rejected him Oh its not of the slightest consequence The Council had now again thrown the old bone of warfare about financial control before them and what were they going to do? He had voted several times against things in the Reform Bill because it divided the people into two classes, but he advised the Chief Secretary to assent to the confer- ence after Mr Ramsay a speech By so doing he showed he was willing to make a certain concession but the difference between a £10 onda£2o franchise was something enormous, and one could not call 12s a concession In his constituency of Fitzroy 2 450 ratepayers were disqualified for the next 10 years, and then they could not be qualified until another agitation had taken place in Collingwood 2 550 men were also disqualified Mr MIRAMS 22 cwt (Laughter ) Mr TUCKER- That made "j 000 ratepayers in the two places who would not have one solitary political fight in future because of the passing of this bill He was convinced a grand mistake had been made by passing the bill Both sides claimed a victory for it but his private opinion was that both sides were thoroughly disgusted with it and publicly claimed the victory for political reasons He was happy to say his car league ( Mr \p'e) in the Cabinet ty as one of the strongest opponents of the bill and the difference between him and his colleague was that he worked against the bill and his colleague voted against it in the Cabinet though at the same time he had to go with his colleagues in the Cabinet An Hon MiMULit - What more Cabinet Secrets Mr TUCKER was not going to say that public reasons did not induce his colleague to go with his colleagues in the Ministry, but at the same time he was happy to say he and his colleagues were as one on the question of the ratepayers' roll He had another thing to say It appeared there was one member of the Ministry who had been negotiating with the other side all through (Cries of " Name ). He could not find out the name and that was what made the thing all the more suspicious Major SMI 1H -It was not I Mr TUCKER said he had his information from the hon member for Brighton but when be asked that hon member who the Minister was he said he was not got " to Bay It appeared however that one of the Ministers had been negotiating with the Opposition all the south Mr BERRY-It was very wrong of that one man if he exists but I think it is all a myth Mr TUcKER continued -A taxation bill had been thrown contemptuously back in their faces and he wanted now to know what the Assembly were going to do when the old bone of contention was thrown at them there would be an election for the Council in Ij months and not one solitary liberal would then be returned Mr HALL said it was somewhat pleasant even- for the sake of variety to find that whilst a" round the house there had been a son, of controversy is to who were the victors about the Reform Bill there were at least two hon. members who were disposed to put on immortelles about it if he had watched events properly for the last 12 or 15 weeks he had but one true conviction and that was that if there was a gentleman in the House who had desired that the Reform Bill should pass in any shape whatever it was his caucus to Mr Tucker (I am hter ) If there was one gen the man who had said he would vote for any thing and if he could not get anything he wanted he would try for something and if he could not get something he would go for nothing so that the question were settled and out of the way it was the senior member for Fitzroy (Mr locker) He (Mr Vale) had always preferred the rate payers roll to the new bill but the object was to secure an effectual representation of the people in the Legislative Council If this be" failed to accomplish that there would then be a fair ground to recommence the agitation Mr T BUCKLE In ten years Mr Vi LI The hon. member might commence it in 15 months In that time 18 seats would be open and by the issue of that election they would have to judge the result of this measure It was impossible to prophesy the result and if the hon member (Mr Tucker) had been on the Treasury bench he would have been as medical u sucking dove Mr BENT-Ian t that slang' Mr VALE- "who it was a most poetical expression His colleague had told the House with a remarkable graphic power for him to laugh) what took place in the Minister's room He (Mr. Vale) did not know whether he was there to hear for himself if he was he ought not to need remind it g that even among schoolboys there was nothing condemned like eavesdropping If he was not there the graphic power might have been the result of the growth of mci dents in the course of transmission hon members would do well to remember that if they were seeking with all the earnestness of a sort of go as you lease race to get on the Treasury benches at any price, they might, at least show before they got there, some of the decent reticence which belonged to those who had the run of the Ministerial room as Ministerial supporters He could say dis strictly on behalf of the Government that at the consideration of this question on the afternoon of the day on which the hon. member for East Bourke (Mr Ramsay) made his statement they had not theslightestunderatandingthat any authentic proposal of that sort was possible (Hear hear ) A week had not elapsed since the Council had so to speak put their find jun and straightened up their backs and refused to concede anything farther The hon. member (Mr Ramsay) said he know the Council would take a certain course and if they did not he would vote with the Government The hon. member for Maldon (Mr M Intyre) endorsed that Bente ment There was a current run of sympathy with those expressions and the Government then changed their front They took a course in the ever ing with later information before them different from that which they proposed to take in the afternoon That was not a new or novel course It was one which they considered it their bounden duty to take so as to meet the wishes of the public Mr R CLARK said that anyone who had read the Age during, the last few days must have been considerably amused by seeing the Chief Secretary credited with all the praise for the settlement of this question But what did that hon. gentleman start his reform campaign with In 1877 his two main pain all les were finality in legislation and supremacy in a parcel matters for the Assembly In t e first session of the next Parliament he is produced a bill with the sixth clause and the plebiscite, but with nothing about the extension of the franchise or the liberal wing of the Upper House In 1879 he brought in a bill which gave the Assembly uncontrolled and unchecked power over money matters, but with not a single word in it of reform, is understood in the bill which had now passed In February, 1880, he had another bill with the " nominee 1 case It was well known that the first Government which promulgated the principles of the new bill was the Service Government They proposed a £10 and £20 franchise, and in addition they gave votes to owners of miners rights That would have placed 130,000 persons on the roll for the Council They also proposed to have 12 provinces now there were 14, and 42 members with a shorter tenure of office With this before the country he (Mr Clark) could not understand how the liberal organ could congratulate the Chief Secretary and his Government on having brought about a settlement of the question, because the present Government had done nothing to secure the bill of reform which had now passed Last Tuesday evening the hon. gentleman was anxious to have a division, and if that division had been taken the end would have been thrown out. Parliament would have gone anto recess, and the country I would have been agitated with another reform bill Mr WRIXON was pleased at the House not having to discuss the merits of any particular reform, but to whom the credit was due for having carried a reform measure Without wishing to detract from the merits of the different persons alluded to, he thought one element in the settlement had not received sufficient weight or consideration, and that was the weight due to the immense outside pressure of common sense (Hear, hear ). The public, who had waited and suffered for years, had urged for a settlement on the basis which the Legislature had agreed to, and he believed the step which had been taken was a thoroughly wise and just one It had exterminated the existence of a class chamber, and its place had created a chamber based on the ratepayers roll, and representing the large majority of the people He quite agreed that if politicians of standing raised the standard of conflict by calling the Upper Chamber a class house before it was known what would be the outcome, it would be possible to renew the agitation But if the new constitution were allowed full play, there was every likelihood of its meeting the wants of the country If anyone had turned round, he was inclined to say with King Lear " I could not wish the fault undone, The lEbue of it being so profitable Mr MIRAMS said anyone was welcome to the credit of having passed this bill as far as he was concerned The hon. member for Portland maintained that the Upper Chamber established under this new bill would not be a class house (Hear, hear) He thought the hon gentleman had failed to read the proceedings of the first conference on the bill. If one thing came out more strongly than another in that conference, it was, that it was the set purpose and determination of the gentlemen who represented the Upper Chamber to secure a measure of reform which would make a clasS house No one acknowledged that more clearly than the Attorney-General Sir Charles Sladen proposed n £10 rating for freeholders and £25 for occupiers together with plural' voting clauses, giving unlimited powers to put on other votes to swamp the 23,000 occupiers The new act of Parliament would give 51 M3 additional votes to freeholders, and 20 283 additional votes to occupiers 'I hoto £5.28 properties occupied by non owners, and rated to the occupiers, had got owners, who by paying 18 could be put on the general roll in addition to having the vote on the ratepayers roll which the bill gave them Making an allowance for those whose additional properties were in the same district and those already on the ratepayers roll out of the 25 283 places rated to occupiers there would be at least 15,000 owners able to get on the general roll by paying Ib AH that those interested had to do was to put as many more of those owners on to the general roll before the next election and the occupiers interest would be swamped Mr 1R ASER -That would only be po3 Bible in large towns Mr VALE At e not half the owners or occupiers' Mr MIRAMS -I am dealing with those who occupy as tenants Mr VALE It applies the other way Mr MIRAMS -It did not apply the other way The new act gave a vote to 50.00 owrerBonthe ratepayers re" and 25 500 cc couples on the ratepayers' roll Were those 2000 hold inga owned by anybody or not' They were not owned by the people in them, and they must be owned by others Those who owned the property could pay 15 and got on the general rolls, which the plural voting clauses gave the Upper House the power to manufacture Some 15 000 free holders would thus get upon the roll The act provided a vote for occupiers only down to the £25 rating, and there were 31 007 occupiers of properties between a £25 and £10 rating The owners of those properties, for which the tenants could not Litany votes, could test vote by paying Is , and be placed on the general roll, so that there would be not only 50 000 freeholders on the ratepayers roll as against 2000 but the possibility of 40,000 owners of property getting; on to the fear etal roll by payment of Is for properties for which the tenants would be rated, some of whom would vote as tenants down to £25. and some of whom would not The plural voting clauses were put in purposely by fair Charles Sladen to secure this object and he said so at the conference It was only on condition that these clauses were inserted that he consented to come down to £10 at all Mr Berry said he would not undertake to propose so monstrous a think to the Assembly, but he had not only proposed it, but forced his party to accept it A" the points necessary to make the Council a class house had been conceded These were the proposals for more votes on the freehold list power to add additional freeholders by means of the plural voting clauses, and in addition the unlimited power to manufacture faggot votes Given the power of manufacturing their votes, and the necessity to have them for party purposes did the Chief Secretary or any man in his senses suppose for a moment that it would not be so arranged that the people who had these votes should be near enough to the various polling booths through out the colony to record their votes on one day ' Vi 1 on the Chief Secretary said at Pres ton that be intended to throw out the bill as long as it contained the plural voting clauses he told the meeting that under those clauses 3,000 men could have 12 000 votes, and that the elections occupying five days the 3,000 could travel about the colony and record all those vote. But if a political organisation wanted 42,000 votes they would not proceed in that expensive way, they would give half the votes to men near the places where they could vote just as well on one day as infivednye At Preston, the Chief Secretary said that no liberal worthy of the name would vote for a measure containing the plural voting clauses He said the same at the caucus and in the Assembly afterwards, and the very next night he voted for it all the new act provided for two kinds of plural voting The legitimate kind he had already indicated, which allowed a man who had two properties in different districts, being rated in one as the owner, and voting as on the ratepayers roll, whether the property was voted for by occupiers or not So in addition to the 50 000 freeholders GRain at 25 000 occupiers, which the ratepaying portion of the act gave tie, it also provided for the manufacture of 40,000 or 50,000 legitimate votes by freeholders on jay ment of la If we were to have 60,000 freeholders in addition to those already on the roll against the 25 000 occupiers the new bill gave us, was it not an absurdity to say that this new House would be anything but a class house, representing the freehold interest alone ? Another point Sir Charles Sladen secured to make a class house was that no man should be eligible to be a mere her unless he was a freeholder with a certain amount of property clear of all incumbrance He objected to the members qualification being confined to real property, and, in conclusion, said he desired to take no credit for the bill He only regretted it had been passed, and was quite sure the country would, before long, wake up to the fact that it had been miserably sold Mr KERFERD said the debate was a most unprofitable one, and he could not under stand why the Government should have put up the hon. member for Kara Kara to originate it As to the remarks of the hon and learned member for Portland, this bl" was infinitely worse than the Service bl" had been said to be for it would create a second Chamber, which would be a dominant power in the country, and really irresponsible The hon. member said the present bill would not create a class House If not, he (Mr Kerferd) did not know what a class House was in the Service bill there was a power, wanting in the bill just passed, whereby the Council could be controlled In fact, the bill just passed provided no means whereby the Council could be controlled The truth was that the Government had educated the country up to a point when the public said, " Thank God, we have a second and conservative Chamber to check the Assembly That was the result of the proceedings of the Government and Assembly during the past four years Was there any thing that to glory over' Why hon members should be be anxious to get the credit of passing this bill he did not know, Mr. Vi OODS -You voted for it and did not believe in it. Mr. KLRrERD-The hon member for Stawell had told the House exactly the same thing of himself (Laughter) Had he been a Government supporter, he would never have consented to the bill passing without a clause providing for a dissolution of the Council as well as of the Assembly in the event of irreconcilable differences between the two Houses Mr M'KEAN -We will bring in a bill for that next session Mr KERFERD -Many practical questions demanded prompt treatment, and the country would not want another agitation next year There was, as he had said, no power in the bill for controlling the Council Mr. M'COLL -We are no worse off than we were Mr KERFERD -Yes, because until now the Council had only represented a very small section of the community, but under the bill it would represent a very large proportion of the people. Mr PATTERSON observed that it was distressing to think that the House should waste so much time in discussing a question that had already been settled Surely, now, they ought to try to do what the country required in the direction of practical legisla- tion Was it not a fact that the country was satisfied with this settlement? But if anything would allay that satisfaction, it would be such a speech as that of the Son and learned member for the Ovens, who had denounced the bill as imperfect Who could tell what the outcome of the bill would be until it had been in operation It might turn out that the opinions of the con- stituencies of the Council would be a id r reflection of the opinions of the whole country With respect to the credit of seat' ng the question, he was disposed to divide it by 75, and let each man take his share (Laughter ) The hon. member had delivered his speech a little too late It was a speech that might have been made against the passing of the bill, but it was not right for an hon. member to make such a speech after doing all he could to assist in the passage of the men who Opposition had helped very materially in the settlement of the question, and had frequently expressed their desire to have settled ItBcemed to him that if any members should now be seeking to put themselves right with the country it was the Corner party, which had opposed the bill The two sides of the House had been perfectly consistent in their attempts to settle the question The leader of the Opposition went a little too far when he said that a member of the Government knew, prior to the caucus, that such terms as those announced by the hon member for East Bourke could have been obtained Mr MURRAY SMITH. Two Ministers knew Mr PATTERSON had had a conversation with the hon. member before the 8th June, when the hon member was most hopeful that the he" would be met by the Council in a favourable spirit, and sent back in an acceptable form The hon. member for Boroondara took too sanguine a view as to the effect of the con- versation between them. The utmost he (Mr Patterson) undertook to say was that the Chief Secretary would not give way on the question of the plural vote except to the extent that the elections should be all held on one day, which would minimise the effect of the vote He hoped that the time of the House would not be further token up with needless discussion The finances looked 1 Pretty well, everybody seemed to have plenty of work and all classes were satisfied with the settlement arrived at Mr BERRY -The House appears to be the only dissatisfied portion of the community Mr GAUNSON thought that the reason given by the hon. and learned member for the Ovens for arriving at a settlement was most unsatisfactory The hon and learned member told them that the people were worn out and not in their right senses to come to a proper decision, therefore their representatives in Parliament came to a wrong decision on their behalf If there was anything calculated to bring a deliberative Assembly into contempt it was the way in which the Reform Bill had become law In the opinion of the hon and learned member the bicameral system must fail, if the two bodies were not dissimilar in constitution If they were elected by the same constituents there must, he thought, be c 'deadlock. Both Houses in Cape Colony were elected by the same con- Stituency, and to all intents and purposes by manhood suffrage There was something like a dissolution of the Council provided for One half the members were sent to their constituents at the end of five years, and the other half at the end of ten 'They were not liable to an immediate dissolu- tion, however, as this House was the Assembly could be sent to the right about at any mother' in fact it was always under the fear of a dissolution With regard to the various reform schemes the two Berry bills proposed to make the Assembly absolutely despotic in matters of finance, and the Service bill proposed to make the Ministry of the day absolute despots over both Council and Assembly, because it gave them power to dissolve both Houses Mr 1RASPR- It would have made the people the judges Mr GAUNSON-That would only have been the plebiscite in a worse form The electors were not always the best judges they could not bear all the arguments pro and co?! and they did not feel the same sense of responsibility as the men who had to stand up in their places in Parliament and justify the vote they gave The measure at last adopted would, be feared prove a, vicious fruid Unless hon members worked the constitution in a reasonable spirit they would have deadlocks of a more dangerous and evil character than before Mr MUNRO thought that the hon member for Kara Kara by whom the debate was begun must admit that the whole evening had been v. listed He was reminded of the story about a young couple who went to the backwoods of America In the nighttime a bear entered their hut The husband climbed up to the rafters and the wife killed the bear When the struggle was over, the husband came down from his place of safety and exclaimed, "Well did not we manage to be" the bear ? Every hon. member seemed to be anxious to say, ' Didn't we pass the bl" ' but it now began to dawn on the House that the bear was not killed, but as lively as ever He felt that politics in that House were degraded to the position that the ' outs wanted to put out the "ins, and the "ins wanted to keep in as long as they could and anything like defending the rights of the constitution for the people had been forgotten long ago He had lost pH interest in politics Mr C IO UN G-M hat are you here for, then' Mr MUNRO supposed the recent action of the Council would be forgotten in the fight that was about to take place for the Treasury benches The constitutional rights of the House did not matter at all as long as seven or eight gentlemen wanted to get on those benches It should be remembered, however, that every time the other House rejected a financial measure they gave the Assembly to understand it had no special financial rights or position If such things were to be allowed to go on the other House would dictate what the taxation of the country should be, and the Assembly would not be able to claim the power of the purse He had said he had not taken much interest in politics recently, but if there was any party in the Assembly determined to maintain its rights and privileges now, he was prepared to stand by that party Mr FRASER agreed to a considerable extent with what the hon. member for North Melbourne had just said but at the same time it would have been monstrous thing if the other House had passed the Land Tax Bill He had always been in favour of an in come tax, and he was sure, until there was such a tax, or one that would touch silk aids of wealth, the colony would be subjected to the evils arising from class taxation The property holders in the country ought not to be taxed whilst those in the towns were un taxed The hon member then condemned the style of articles which appeared in the leading Radical' organ, and said workingmen ought to read the papers on both sides, and then form their opinions Mr DUFFY considered the debate a great waste of time Every one was congratulating himself upon the Reform Bill being out of the way, and yet they came to the House to Ond its ghost in possession He hoped they had now heard the last of it, and that it would remain buried during the lifetime of most hon. members 'The confession made by several hon. members showed that if the Service bill had been discussed i free from party prejudice it would have been carried into low, to the satisfaction of both the Legislature and the country. He looked forward confidently to this measure proving a substantial benefit to the country, and as an end to the reform turmoil of the past four years He was willing to have the credit of passing this bill divided amongst the 75 who voted for it, but he claimed for the Opposition the credit of having saved the country from the madness of the plebiscite, the 6th clause, and the proposal for a nominee Upper Chamber This was something to be proud of, and to which the Opposition could look back with satisfaction. The House then divided on the question that the House do now adjourn, with the following result - Ayes 44 Noes 23 Majority for the adjournment 20 The following is the division list - AYES Mr Anderson Mr Hunt Mr O'Dea, I Roll - James - Patterson \- Berry - Johnstone - Roos \- Eovvrmn - Landridge - Richardson \- Cameron - Longmore Major Smith \- Cook Sir C MacMahon Mr Toohey \- Davies Mr Madden, W - Tucker \- Dow - Mason - Vale \- Flsher - M'Coll - Wallace \- Francs - M Kean - Williams \- Gibb - Mirams - Woods \- Grant - Munro - Young, A \- nail - Nimmo - Zox \- Harris Officer NOES Mr Bent Mr Graves Sir J O'Shanassy \- Burrowes - Langdon Mr Ramsay \- Clark, U Dr Madden - Shiels A Cooper Mr McIntyre - Smith, R H. \- Duffy - M'Lean - Whoolor \- France Sir B O Loghlon - Young, 0 \- Gillies Mr Orkney - Zlnoko ADJOURNMENT. The House then, at a quarter to 9 o'clock, adjourned to the following day. After the mace had been removed from the table and the Speaker had risen from his seat, Mr. Bent rose to address the House. The SPEAKER, leaving the dais, said it was quite out of order for an hon. member to address the House after the race had been removed. (Laughter.)
