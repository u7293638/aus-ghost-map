A Chinese Ghost Story. OursnIDE Of the ChllingWen Gate in Peking there has been for a long time an empty house, which has had the name of being haunted. Nobody has dared to live in it for a great while. A man named Yang, knowing nothing about the ghost, recently moved his residence into that house. During the first two weeks a ghost terrible in appearance made himself visible in the night. Yang, being a young manl of bravery, and having learned the professional ways of taming devils, did not care for it. One night, when he saw the spirit unusually rampant, and he undertook to drive it out, the devil suddenly became a ray of red lighr, and entered into the ground. Yang was greatly surprised at this, and digging into the ground, found more than 10,000 taels of silver in the place where the spirit had entered. It is said that Yanng is a virtuous man; ]he has given money for charity many times, so that the large sum of money he obtained was.the reward of Heaven.
