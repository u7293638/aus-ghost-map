Talea aatf Sketclioo ROBBING THE MAJOR. BsrM. M. Ryan. _. ; One could live in Bareilly ; there wore plenty of ohummable Europeans around,. ?? old civil servants rolling in gold moliun ^ and with marriageable daughters, indigo . . planters lavishly free with. thoii- cham- pagne, and game in abundance. So the feelings of myself and brother officers, a . society-loving lot all, may be imagined ' when our regiment received sudden orders to proceed from Baroilly to ? PeBhawur, the plague apot of 'India. There was something approaching mutiny \ among us, but we had to tramp it, and, what made it worse, old Major S — — , ?.?' alias ' Ooppornose,' alias ' Stingy Steenie,* ' the mattinet and miser of the regiment, ; was accompanying us. Wo had thought lie was about retiring, but our ill-luok would have it otherwise. Hardly a day pasied that he did not get one or other of ub a wigging from the colonel, wno, how ever, was an easy-going, kindly-disptwed ' man, and generally managed, to. let us. know afterwards that it went against his grain to punfch us. We surnu£ed that jhe ? vraB a liUle afraid of the. major. No. 'two men could be more dissimilar in every ?way. The colonel, was generosity itself,' the major waB Btinginesa personified, and ' no love was lost between the two. The , colonel's genial manner and openhanded^ nesB oaBt a tierce white light on the other's' grumpiness and meanness.- Mitjor ? waa tho heta noire, of theiegiment; no one liked him j-even the private soldiers 'copper-nosed' him behind his backhand; the native servants, who generally manage; to conceal -their dislikes, both feared 'and hated him.' And hekriew all this, and, wbatis more, knew he had earned it. He was no AdoniB ; a red pimply face of vast expanse — a .perfect continent of face surmounted --.', ciipapibuaj barrel- shaped body, the^whple supported by two thiok, Btumpy legs': that. was. the major. In features some would consider him posi tively uglyi ani* his overweening vanity was in proportion to his uglinesB. He was' fastidiously particular as to dress, ? ? ,&] Tegular fop, and believed that, in the eyes of the fair ssx, he waB perfeotly ,irre-; aistible. Now when I look back and take an impartial, conscientious view of the man's character, I do not see a single lovable trait in it. A martinet and a 'miBer.Httlo wonder ho was disliked in the hospitable and aristocratic— th. '....'.. After .a little while we settled '3own to. ,the dull round, of station duty, its early, morning drills and late afternoon parades, varied only too, often by, a.vexatiouB ,«« field day' across the swampy country. Between the winter drills, occasional; re primands from the- oolonel for some pecoadillo reported by tho major, and frequent daring robberies by adventurous Afghan gentry from the neighbouring. ' hillsi we-; were' kept pretty busy. The Afghans are the moBt daring and adroit thieves in existence, 'and would put to shame the oleverest cracksman within sound of Bow Bells. .Wo had thought the pinnacle of audiioity waa reached when they appropriated the colonel's horse, stealing, it out of the stablo wherein the syce slept ; . .but this feat was completely eclipsed when, they stole the rifles' from a tent occupied by some half-dozen soldiers, who to make; the matter woree, were every one in the. tent at the. time.

'.„.,' ,.„ , Miss Bralligan, otherwise ? Silverbill, was the only daughter of the brigade 'major, 'tall, angular, Bkinny, and \ marriageable any time during the past twenty yearB. ' Silverbill' and the garri son hack', were, the rather unflattering titles bestowed on her, in private, by the . ungallant youngsters, who resolutely re fused to be smitten by her charms. She was. a most accomplished and voluble conversationalist, her talk a quick per petual dribble of silvery nothings— hence the not inappropriate title, ' Silverbill.' Charlie Carter, irrepreBsible Charlie, boasted that he deserved a tablet in Poets' Corner, Westminster Abbey, when he ahuffied off this mortal coil; fer giving birth to the poetic cognomen. On her -?sallow, pale face there generally sat that languid, tride, pleaBe-make-love-to-me expression often observable on the time pencilled features of the ladies verging on old maHhood. She paid assiduous court to the major— literally haunted him, but. *' for all that she could not bring him-up to the Boratch. He ehied at matrimony, and Charlie Carter's wish that be, would marry Silverbill and take: an indefinite period of leave was not ??likely! to -be ful filled. '?-'?; ','?' ,' ; ??; ', !i .i One morning the \colonel entered the orderly room with a cloiid on his/brow, all the more noticeable becauBe sunshine' generally dwelt'-there. He had 'an open letter from General Payne in his hand: The following was- the! pith* of its con tents, quite enough to account^ for the^ «loud :— ? '?-?-. :?? ,.?.'-.?.:,?-?,.?

There appears to be gross negligence somewhere.' This threw a temporary gloom over us. The colonel had no excuse worth a button to offer ; the riflea were stolen from under Ihe very noses of the eoldiers, and that was an end of it. To urge the skill and genius of the thieves as a palliation would ?v aimply be childish, so the colonel wisely .????? Jeffc things as they were. ,:-..-.

The truth of the affair did- not ooze out for a long time ; the major never knew it, for Borne few months after, to the Bur-, prise of the whole station, he married.

(Sir Alex ander William George Duff, K.T.), ?Viscount- Macduff, is (says an ex change), a somewhat. remarkable coinci dence, from the fact that this is the second Princess Louise who has been betrothed to a/peer of the realm. It will be remem bered that Princess .Louise, the third daughter of her Majesty Queen Victoria, in 1871, married the ? Marquis of Lome, who is heir to the dukedom of Argyll. Another coincidence is that both the peers aro de scendants of illustrious ancient Scotch f amilieB, arid ancestors of. both have madij themselveE famous in history. The Ea,rl of Fife, who ' is descended from the Macduff, Thane of Fife, with whom the genius of Shakespeaie has made the world familiar; is very wealthy, and has vast, estates in Scotland. ? Marr Forest, which belongs to him, is famous as the hest deer forest in. Scotland, and on it the heaviest stags avo killed every year. Tho Prince of /Wales very often goes to Marr Forest deerstalking. The forest adjoins to a great extent Braemar, one of |the estates of the Queen, and the Earl lives 'only 12 miles from Balmoral Castle, and, 16 mileB from the Prince 'of Wales' reBidonce in Scotland. In sooioty Earl Fife is im .menBely popular. Marr Lodge 5s always full of visitors. When in London the Earl drives one of the finest teams of horses. The Earl of ,-Kintore, the present Governor of South' Australia, was a great friend of the Earl of Fife, both noblemen holding acres in the same county in Scotland.
