Much of the success of the party depends on tho story-toller of tho ereuing. Be 'must be a young person witb the ability to tell legends regarding ghosts calculated to make tbe blood run cold, tbe heart palpitate, aud tba hair stand straight ou end. Tbo guests and hostess wheel away to some secluded graveyard just about tbe time twilight is darkening into night, slid here, amid the tombs of unknown folk, the tales will be told in voices fitted to tbe occasion.
