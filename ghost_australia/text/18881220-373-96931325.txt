THE NORTH GARRET. BY lt BACHELOR. ' I am an old bachelor. If thrfe is a- human being whose nerves are made of steel, I am that individual. I have never once, .lost my presence of mind. I don't believe in ghosts* of course I'n- not a sensational person. I have never been in love- Once, when I was five-, and-twenty — no matter how many years ago— I thought that I wap? A pur of brown eyes, and a head o? golden hair, long, dark lBBb.es- put the notion into my head. I lost my usual good sense for a while, and proposed to MUly Bash wood, and went through the usual experiences that follow an accep tance. But I grew tired of my pretty toy in a few months, and began to see that * a young man married would be a young man marred 7 The girls Jiad lost alt their interest in me, and the married ladies took tb snubbing me, I had not half the nice invitations I used (o have, and, beside, old Mr. Bashwood failed, and Milly'a fifty thousand vanished into the air. She would have nothing on marriage, instead of being an heiress ; and so, one day, I fold her vre had both made a mistake, and she said probably [ was the best judge, and gave me back my ring. It bad a nice diamond in it, and I had it set for a shirt stud »t once. And of course I sent her bacx her letters, nnd she returned mine, and after that we never met again. I got out of the sffiir more easily than most fellow's do, fnd I've never jot into sneh n one again. Perhaps when I'm old and begin to break down a little, I shall marry some nice young girl and settle down comfortably. It's a pretty, good thing to do then, but not before one is past fifty. ' Well, as I said, I saw no more bf Mtily, aud I forgot all about her in a few years. I stand before you a practical man, untramelled by tnytot of superstition, with a good income, gcod health, snd a habit of enjoying my life — »n example to all sentimental, emotional people, if I say it myself ; nnd just in this condition I walked in at h » door of Mrp. Regan's ' confounded - 11 house, on tbe twenty sixth of JuW, 1832 j We had started for the Muuritri i House, I and 'Barnard, and his trap bad. broken ' down, and here we were on a rough roiid with our journey not l*'f ? over : Ostikitl as far behind us as ih i Mountain House was before ns ; bo h dead tired.. . i ?

What wpnld I have 'done to a waiter who prospji'ed me with such a supi « ? at the club 1 . But jstvryathra does not discriminate ; I ate heartily. And afterward, being aiked to choose between the kitchen and the north gar ret, I said the garret by *Il meanfl. I had a vague idea that it woul-l be farthest removed from the rest of the establishment. ' :.-???-?-? : It was a queer looking jil*cef with ? a chimney in the ccnt-e, the roof running from a peak in tnidd'e lo the floor on either sida ; one square window, and one sloping one ',; and boxes, iafjs. hams, ropes of onions, and suspended dresses, adorned it in every 'direction. The bed was apparently Bluffed with Corncobs. The pil'ow was of hay^ arid the sheets sinelled of camphor, and t had a kerosine lamp by way --of illu lninnrinn. Remembering my spiing mattress, and silk quilts lined with down at home, my velvet carpel, tbe pink and white shades for my gas, I wondered how I could endure it »H bo calmly. But what should I have gained by making iifusB? Nothing, surely. Never Iroii ble|yourael»us about the inevitable ; simply shut your eyes to it. I shut mine, bavins puffed the kerosine htnp out. £fter a blue explosion of some kind Which made me wonder if I were to be Kubjpct of a paragraph 'Awful Accident ' in ? the next morning's, papers. 1 ad justed myself as well as possjb'e between the softest corn cobs. - * When oiie bleeps one forgets oneVbed,' eaidl. ? Let me sleep.' And totally' refusing to notice the droning of a 1ii4ebos inject with a broivn back, who could walk, fly, climb, leap, wiggle, craw 1 — in short, who possessed every means of 1-jcomoiion Vno.vn to animated naJtire— I went to a ceo. . : The moon arose that night about one o'clock ; therefore it must have been about one o'clock that I awoke, for the moon was rising. You may expect' me to be romantic about her ; but I shall not oblige you* She was as round and yellow as poBsib'e, and came, up over the mountains with her usual indepen dence. Her light fell through' the one straight window of my room, made a white square on' the brown-painted floor, and lit up a queer l'tte ereeu rocking-chair with a rush bottom. For oue moment I saw the chair standing empty ; tbe next a figure occupied it — the figure of a young j.irl. Iln hair, -which seemed to le golden, Ml over her shoulders. Her back was toward me, but 1 saw that her figure was slight and preMy. Tao little white hands were clapped together, and she was rocking to and fro, and moaning in a strnnjre* desolate Bort of a way. * This is odd,' said I. * Some ' one has come into the room by mistake, doubtless, not knowing I was here, t coughed, The young person did not bear ine. J spoke . . : ' Madame, ' said I, * I presume you are not aware that— in fact that I am here.* Then the figure arose. It turned toward me, but again I coutd not sec its face. It's back was to the moon. The outline — stranpely . familiar — was nil I could discern The white robe that looked like' a shroud, trailed after it. The long hair floated over it. I said to myself very calmly, * Were T a super stitions person, I should consider this a ghost.' And still it came nearer, nearer, nearer. It was very embarras iug. ' Madame, ' I said again more loudly ' I prennne you are not aware that I aml.e*eV' Aud a voice answered me— a voice I seemed to have beard bcfore,r ' Yen, I am aware of it. I came be cause I knew it. I came because I knew it. Then she began to moan again. She, Etcod beside the Le 1 now, only a few inches from me. She stretched out her co!dhind*. It was time to do some thing. Whoever she was I saw that Hhe was dangerous— a maniec perhapF. I put my hund under my pi low, where my uiatol lay-: I seized it, . , ' Whoever you are,' said I,, * I pre-, sume you are a thief, playing at ghost. Leave tbe room. I give you three seconds to do it in. I count them. At the third count I fire. One — two— - three-;— ' As I said one she retreated, pointing at me. As I counted two she drew stiiil farther off. As I cried three she was gone. I lit that kerosine lamp aud ex amined tho room. The door was sbu1 and locked inside ; the windows fastened down. with nails, as all windows are in rural, houses. I looked behind the boxes, barrels, and gowns, I felt the floor. There was iio trau door. Yet she was gone 1 If I had been a superstitious idiot, 1 should have aaid that 1 had seen k Bpirit. As it was, being a practical man, I at once argued with myselfr— Touch fried ham, and something called Injuu puddin', whatever it inav have been, has givea me a nightmare — n night mare in an unusual form, dwubt }ess — a fair young girl in white,. instead of Olhe.Uo or a black dog, Tjiere arc exceptiqns tc every, rule. .1 have.. had n whiieiuaro instead of a black one, that is all. Again I .put out my kerosine lamp nguin I fitted myself between the corn cubs ; again 1 woke, lo fiud a figure — the same fi^nrc-ssipndinjfwver. me.. li'J was inbani%iitiiVbtf P lliiiatirtief-'1tv yfa* i doin| i!lb'rijyfwb1iand^«B .'tsbitJ .as t*^| were^.qjbpjit ijivy .fhWatj11 prelsjn^.^ard j f What, ar4,73ffio;abouj(?ilf:.^»'»ei X.] catching at my ? pielol «gain.

Whe.n I came down, the good woman of the bouse, already ihvitjble at the end of a eunbpnnet, was talking, to Barnard, who is — did I tell you? — an author, a writer of frightful Jong stories in nevvspapers. - She had found hini out ~ ; ?'? : '?? ?? - 'r '.To ihink it Bhodld be you!' febe sMJ ;* You ^lo-y look a bit like. I thought, I'gaessed you had big blace eves and elegant figger, ?- but, ? lor. I you can't help that — and how 1 did look out for the next number, while' Elgira, or Fortunt's Victim,' was being pub lished ! I read it every word, and When she died of lovf^ J cried. 1 didn,'t use to believe folks died of love .once — -bu| — lemmee seer— I guess it was fifteen years ago, I 'knew a case in actual life. Yes, sir. ; You could have made a story of it, no doubt. She died in this bouse, in the north garget— as pretty .a'creattire as you ever isaw^ Her eyes w^ere, «h. how brown, and such .lovely., golden hair. Her father brought her out here one summer?'' ..?———-.- ?Mrs. Regan,' says^hf. 'I'm afraid my girl is in a decline, but we hope soinethir.g from country air.' ' We'ii do what we can, and moun tain air is the best, of any sir,' 6aid ' But pretty Boon I saw tLat there was more than sick-ness -to deal with. The night she died fihe loJd me. Yes, sir, it was a love affair. He had jilted eer because her father had lost his money. He'd failed, the old gentleman had. . ' I loved him so much I' said she. * I thunght him. 60 brave aud .true, and so fond of me. And it was alia mockery — every look a lie, every. kiss an insuit since it did not come from bis heart.' * But you should forget Buch a rascal. You shoul.l not go -on loving a fellow like that,' s?.-d I. * Then Bhe sat up in bed. I never shall forget if. Oh, Mn-. liegaa, ' she said, ' it is just that 1 It is that I have grown to hate him so that 1 lie all night wishing that I cou d kill him — hating him as I never hated anything before ! Sometimes I think 1 *liall come back from tho other world to do it. Ghosts are permitted to k*U their murderers they say, and he has murdered me. Yes, he has killed mr, not only mv body, but, all the sweet, beautiful feel ings I once had. They -all died Ions ago. Hate, hate, hate— that is tilling me. Hale of the man I once loved ! ' ' Oh, let me send for a minister, my dear! I said. * But Bhe made no answer. She never spoke again. She died that night. Poor child she was very young. Milly Bashwood. Aged eighteen.'. That in on her headstone id the burv ing ground, if you'd like to look at it. I don't know whether she said any thing more* Barnard says I fainted. I don't admit it, but if I did I vow it was that abominable supper. A ghopt — bah ! but I wouldn't sleep iu that north great again for xny fortune, piactical man as I am.
