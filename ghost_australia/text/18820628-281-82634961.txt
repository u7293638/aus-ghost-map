There were afewTtho had money/and kCU fewer who bad credit, who lxail not dabbled in scrip; consequently Trhen that security 'became 'worthiest!, and calls heavy, insolvencies followed in qnick sneccoion. Men's hearts died within them: They discovered that their roUI had become like that in the fable which turned to aslics of dried leaves, their valnable claims to i Worthle? plots of grotmd, ever so many yards away from the line of reef, and, agricultnrally-sfc.-.kirig, not fit to grow a head of cabbage. The yielit of gold from Grit decreased with extraordinary snd lieiiness, and oa every sule there were prophet-ins that the precious metal would soon fail altogether. This set all the political economists going, and one after another, they found oat tliat gold mining was : carried ou at loss, and that if nutters did not change, general insolvency would result, and Grit become a wilderness of. trees, and Melbourne a mined Tillage. But the large number of thinking ?TMm nerer wavered in their opinion that gold mining was in its infancy, and that ere lone tba cloud would be lifted, and Grit proved to be neher than ever. And, although beggared,andknowinff not where to net another; mead, Jack was one of these. Bβ had studied tha part of Grit, ana was 'firmly emnineed thatin its bosom there was con tained a treasure a thousand fold greater than had erer been extracted...

Can there be imagined a;ryth!ng more terrible than a sodden lall from wealth and happiness, to pertrty and misery? It is like toppling from the summit of a high mountain, up which we have climbed by weary and tedious steps, into the slimy ditch at its foot. Wo view tho terrible distance,' and sigh that we have to labor up to tho ilar.iling eminence anew. Tho f.-iblo of Sisyphus, ordered to everlastingly roll up the mountain a stone which tumbled to the foot, tho moment it neared the top,- must have been susffcsted to the poet by such a fate. And when Jack, soberly and calmly looked: into tho future, it reamed impossible for him to ci cr regain what he had lost, lie had no money, no friends, and he knew only one way of getting a living, by returning to his old occupation as s miner, to do which, hnwas somewhat incapacitated by tho luxurious and irregular life he had led. But there was a deeper sorrow than this.' How could he rctriere what he had lost—the love of that pare and beautiful girl, who was to hnn more than life itself? She had faded from .his virion for btct.

Her lover, who had written, to her that he was wealthy, met her when the great crisis had mado hnn s poor man.
