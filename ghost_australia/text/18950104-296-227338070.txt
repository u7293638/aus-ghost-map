Christmas Voices. So Christmas û here again : — While the house sleeps quiet as death, 'Neath the bright m cyan comes the waits' shrill tune, And we listen and hold our breath. The Christmas that never was— On this foggy wintry air, With clear pale gleam, like the ghost of a dream, It is painted everywhere. The Christmas that might have bean- It is borna in the far-off sound. Sown the empty street with the tread of feet That lie silent under ground. The Christmas that yet may be. Like the Bethlehem star, leads kind : Yet our life Blips past, hour by hour, fast, fast, Few before and many behind. ^ The Christmas we have and hold, With a tremulous, tender strain, Half joy, half fear—be the psalm of the year, " tjrrief passes, blessings remain !" The Christmas that sure will come, Let tis think of at fireside fair— When church bells sound o'er one small green raonnd, Which the neighbors pass to prayer. The Christmas that God will give- Long after all these are o'er, When1B day nor night, for the Laînb is our Light, .. And we live for evermore. The Author t)f "John Halifax." A young lady, while crossing the street in London, had a violincéUo box, which she was carrying, Bmashed by a cab. The box, on yielding np its contents, was, it is B&id;, found to possess, not a 'cells, but what appeared to be the f wnHy wash.
