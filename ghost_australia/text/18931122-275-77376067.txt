SUPERNATURAL VISITATION ON THE MURCHISON. A GHOSTLY APPEARANCE. The following, from the pen of Mr. R. C. Cox, who recently visited the Murchison district, in th;s colony, appears in an Ade laide exchange : â€” ' Tho overseer of an out-station on the Murchison and I have just come into camp, after being out tracking horses. Three or four nigger* belonging to the station were camped a mUe down Coonarbie Creek. We had finished supper and were sitting alongside tho camp fire about 8 o'clock, the moon just set, calmness reigning sublime, broken only by the tinkle, tinkle, of a horse or sheep bell, and the chrip from a cricket, when wo were startled by shrieks from tho niffirors. who eame flying into camp and dropped down, on all fours behind us and the breakwind fire place.

Another time a lubra came in frwn the bush with her picianinnie and wonga, and stated that she had seen the mundong running that same day along the creek.
