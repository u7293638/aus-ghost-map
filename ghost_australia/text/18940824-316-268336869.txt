THE SN3W. Lo ! what wonders the^day hath wrought fiorn of the soft and slumbrotis snow t Q-raduaUy.-Bilent, Blowly wrought,; , , Evan as an artist thought by thought Writes expression on lip and brow- Hanging garlands the leaves o'erbrim, . Deep drifts smother the pathe below : The elms are shrouded, trunk and limb, And all the air ia dizzy and dim . a With a wliirl of dancing, dazzling snow. Dimly out of the baffled sight Houses and Chutch-spireB stretch away; The trees, all spectral and still and white, Stand up lite ghostB In the failing light, And fode and fain with the blinded day. Down from the roofs in gusts are hurled The eddying drifts to the waste below; And'StilL is the banner of storm unfurled, Till all the drowned and desolate world Lies dumb and white in a trance of enow. Slowly tha shadows ^gatlier aud fall, Still the whispering snow Hikes bgat j Night and darkness are over all; ' Uest, pale cityj buneath their pall 1 Sleep, white world, in thy winding-sheet; Olonds may thicken and storm winds breathe; Oa .zay wall is a glimpse of Borneo- • band o£ my lo&ging;'.!—^nd'snderneath Swings and trembles my olive wreath; Peacs and I are at home!
