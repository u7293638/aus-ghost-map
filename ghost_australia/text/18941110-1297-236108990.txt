PRACTICAL SPIRITUALISM. Widow: "Can you ring up the ghost of my poor dead husband— Theophilus Phyle? There's his photo. Perhaps that'll help you to resur rect him." Medium: "Yes, madam. It will probably take some time for his spirit to arrive. Be seated." Medium (five minutes later): "There, Jim my, you ain't a bad likeness of Phyle— heaven help you. Put on the other 'mutton chop/ an' we'll let her go." Widow (as ghost appears): "That's him, tho old skin-flint! Whoop-la!" "You vinegar-faced old rascal, tell me why you left all your money to that orphan asy lum!" "There! I guess this'll teach you better next time."
