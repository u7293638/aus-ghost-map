.. PORT PHILLIP. WE:have received a copy of The Port Phillip Gazette of the 18th ultimo, it is very barren of news:- THE MAIL.-No overland: mail has arrived in Melbourne from Sydney this week.: -Whether this delay is caused by the marauding bushran- gers who seem to have it all their own, way in the interior of the country, or whether: it is the re suit of some untoward accident by flood-or field " we know not; but considering the time that is occupied in its': transit,;o'ur desires cannot be characterized as unreasonable, if we insist that instant measures may be adopted to' iinsure its safe transmission, at thie periods fixed for. its ar rival.-Port Phillip Gazette, January 18. ACCIDENT.--While a party consisting of Mrs. Lonsdale, Mrs. Wills, Mrs. Langhorne, Mrs. Harrison, and. Captain Fyans, were returning in a carriage on the night of Monday last from the ball given by the Bachelors of this place, and while crossing Swanston Street from Bourke Street, the wheels of the carriage sunk deep into one of those unsightly inequalities which so dis- grace the thoroughfares of the town. So sudden and unexpected was the jerk, that the coachman was unseated, and the horses taking fright started off with fearful rapidity into the bush. The frightened horses dashing through the forest brought the wheels of the carriage at full speed against the trunk of a gum.tree; the body was severed by the shock from the pole, and the vehicle itself overturned and crushed. Captain Fyans was thrown out with great violence, frac- turing three of his ribs by the fall, while Mrs. Lonsdale being flung by the concussion against the splashboard, received a cut in her face that has the appearance of having been gashed with a knife or other sharp instrument. We have not been able to learn whether Mrs. -Harrison re- ceived any personal injury, but we understand the nervous system, has been affectied to a degree that may prove dangerous in her present deli- cate state. Captain Fyans, it is to be feared, may have sustained some serious internal hurt. -Port Phillip Gazette, January 18. iPORT.

M1AirTLAD, JANUARY 30.-TheT face of it I country in this district'presents an alarming asp from the late heavy and incessant rains. Tk Hunter has overflowed its banks; the waters i rapidly'rising,' and the bridge leadiig from E: to West Maitland is at the present momen within a few: inches of being covered; greatfean are entertainled for'its safety; drays were pr hibited by magisterial authority from passings: two o'clock this afternoon. Parts of the mat street in West Maitland are covered to the dep, of three and'four feet, and parties in all direction have been busy throughout the day in movingt places of security. One, of Mr. Turner's me was drowned two days since in attempting t swim the creek, the body has not yet been found The consequences to.the settlers in this neigi1 bourhood, and indeed to those situated upon t~ banks of the Hunter generally, are disastrousi the extreme. The late luxuriant crops of maii are covered to the.extent,.of many hundred acre by a " weary waste- of waters," desolating an destroying ,in a day the fruits- of human laboc and industry for months past. In the immedia, vicinity of Maitland the destruction of gmr must be great; by many of the settlers it la been most imprudently stacked in low situatiou land the ricks are already more than half cover, by the floods. The river must have risen to th! height .of between forty and fitty feet, and a fear tilhe worsi has not yet reachied us; thle c munication to the upper district is of coursew tirely obstrtiucted. Furtlfer particulars connectd with the catastrophe shall be forwarded for you next number.-Correspondent. \---Bis'RN~EilRS --We catnnot blame yOUR men who go out into the bush with a determa tion to:risk even their dwn liviis, if necessary,t captuire or destroy: those cuerses of our land, ad whenever they have a safe opportunity of din patching a known character, we advise them t ddsod;but where there is mtich danger, and i adequate resisting force,'we think" prudence l better part of valour."

Some- bushrangers, amngst whom were Thompson,commonly called Scotchie who has since been shot, - and Russell, who was captured, attacked 'Captain Papp's store at Coulook, on the Murrumbidgee. They helped themselves to gin and various other refreshments and remained the night.' The next morning a gentleman-came-to the station, on his road to Sydney; the robbers desired him to dismount which he fully intended to do, inasmuch as he was inclined for breakfast. The bushrangers however, wanted all-he had, and he thought it best t.take it " easy" so-he gave them his money amounting to'some twenty pounds. He then took the fellow by the arm' and partook of a glass of grog with him. After some time he said," Well my good fellow, you don't intend to keep all, do you ? . I've nothing else. in the world to get to Sydidey with ,an I'm going there to get a berth, give me half at least." ",W'ell, here 'tis." After some further'chat and conviviality he per suaded him to hand over thewhole. Our friend wasabout to mount his horse when'.the fellow said', " No, no, that's too much, leave us the horse." "Ahl I nonsense man," said the the other "' What's the use of that horse to you, I could afford a better one, but he'll only get you into a scrape if you attempt to ride him; he's regularly shook..Go over to Mr.-___'s he's a rich man and has got lots of fine horses." The fellow leapt on our friend's horse, who thought he had lost him, but he returned in a short time leading another gelding in prime condition.
