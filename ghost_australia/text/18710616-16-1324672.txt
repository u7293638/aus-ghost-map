THE CIVIL WAR IN FRANCE. NEUILLY. The Pans correspondent of tho Times, wilting under date April 10, says - A heavy fusillade was audible from the side of Colombes and Asnieres, and, supposing Neuilly to be in consequence, tolerably quiet, I resolved to attempt a visit as far as I could penetrate through the Bois de Boulogne. My ambulance uniform served to pass me through the Dauphine gate, and, mindful of the rumor that the Bois was occupied by the Versailles party, I skirted along its edge, keeping as much as possible in the dyke which bounds it, until I reached the spot from which the ambulance waggons were forced to fly some four days ago Everything seemed tranquil, and so I tied on my brassard and put a bold face on the matter, determined to plead hospital business, should I find myself in a dilemma. Neuilly is, without motnphoi, a city of the dead. As far as the principal avonue is concerned there is nothing romarkablo to bo seen Brown red spots upon tho pavement mark the passago of death, while holes ploughed m the ground and trees torn up and scattered Bhoft that tho struggle was a desperato one. 'lho Bido streets present a hcai trend mg spectacle, und give us a foretaeto of what wo are to expoct should tho Versailles 01 my force au ontiunoo îuto Paris Piles of bodies, Versaillais and Federals, httorod tho doofsteps, and loy m heaps bovond the stnn cases, while long, thin linos of blood maikcd tbo progress of some victims, wounded unto death, who had oiawled into a cupboard or bo ncath lho ehudow of a firoplaco, und lay there still, with culm, white faces, fixed m ghustly relief in tho light that penetrated down tho chimnoy. Ia some instances thore had ou dontly boen a severn contest, hand to hand Mon lay in twos ana throes, ono upon another, and I felt like a ghost in some Icelandic tale of horror, the only living créature among so many dead. The distant fusillade and crash of sholls servod but to increase tho stillncssand impress mo with the gouoral hush. I was astonished to ro maik that sc\ ern! women hud fallen, in ono in- stance pierced by many balls All of them wore in tho canliiuère uniform, somo with a gaily-paiuted httlo cask strapped round tho waist, others with pistols undischarged still in thoir bolts Thoro was one lying alono within a courtyard, a handaomo young woman, with blnok hair braided about hci tomplcs, a suulo iipou her lips, and tho fragment of a eabro in her hand. She belonged to the 68th battalion, and had boen struck down by tho explosion of a shell. Further on, half buried undor a heavy door whioh had fallen from its hinges, woie two mon, one a sailor and the other a Boldior of the lino, killed by fragmonts of tho samo projectile, and half across tho door and over the courlyurd stoneB wero trails of somo long creopor, just bursting into leaf Many houses aro unroofed and open to tho sky, while shattered blookB of stono and hoops of bricks and sluto render some of tho uurrow lanes almost impasBablo I find upon inquiry that a vory largo proportion of tho viotims of the last few days aro women, counting togothor thoso who have boon killed by accident and thoso who hovo perished sword in hand. One lady, in- deed, bids fair to rival Theroigne de Mericourt -" Citoyenne Eudes," as she is called, wife of the General of the same name, who now com- mands at Issy, and who is a member of the Com- mune. It is said that she has been under fire several times, and has picked off her men with soldierly sangfroid. I wandered from street to street and about the charming villas that nestle among trees along the Neuilly-road, and a melancholy sight they are. Everywhere choice shrubs lying prone upon the ground, and fragments of china vases and splinters of green shutters-statues without heads, fountain-tazzas overturned, balconies torn down, and verandahs bent and broken. In those cases where doors remain intact the win- dows are all shattered, and rooms and garden walks are strewn with broken glass. Fortu nately, almost all furniture has been removed, and even in such houses as still boast of cur tains and household stuff but little appears to have been taken by the plunderer Meanwhile, I became awaro that tho battle on my left was increasing in inteusity The long Avenue of Neuilly became perforce a kind of neutral ground, being swept by both parties, from the ramparts as well as from the batteries of Courbovoie A division was therefore made of the Versailles Corps d'Armee, one portion retiring upon Boulogne and the racing ground of Longchamps, the other occupying Sablon villo These two divisions poured a joint fire on the Porte Maillot, aided in their efforts by shells and boites à mitraille from Mont Valerien. The trees that still remain in the Bois appeared on fire, half enveloped as they were in a dense white smoke. A violent fusillade continued, lasting until sunset, while shells were incessantly hurled on Maillot, the Ternes, and the Arch of Triumph Five projectiles fell within the American ambulance, which is empty and left to its fate, twenty more exploded at the top of the Champs Elysees within half-an- hour. Foot passengers fled scared, or shrunk under the shadows of the houses, and the National Guurds remained hidden behind corners, shaking their fists and vowing vongoance on the canaille "We have had enough of this," they said "We have been too long suffering with those brutes Out with the feu Grégeois, the picrate do potass, and the dynamite We will sweep them from the face of the earth'" And they waved their arms and uttered imprecations, and then re sumed their pipes and retired still further under shelter, quite satisfled with their own conduct. PARIS. The Pans correspondent of the Daily Tele graph, uudei dato Api il 19, savs -The day has passed off with alternations of rain, squalls, aud cannonade. Fighting is going on as usual, und it Beams likely to go on indefi- nitely, if no arrangement can bo made. The Commune,however,is slowly getting the worst of it The fact is proved by cortoin signs supplied by the Journal OJiciel itself, v.nich u full of oil kinds of threats against the men who " refuse to march"- thus indicating that meu aro run- ning short-but which contains no sort of allusion to the battles of the last two doys about Asniores, thereby showing that even Communal mvention cannot screw a success out of thoso engagements. My doctor told mo this morning that lho number of Federals wounded Bince Monday is very large Most of them, as I said in a recent letter, aro carried to their own lodgings, so as to bo out of sight when the Versaillais como in The conse- quence is, that, irrespective of the ambulance surgeons, every ordinary doctor has a lot of them on his hands Mine had eight cases from yesterday's combats alone, most of which he thinks will end in amputation-that is to say, in death, for throughout tbeuai scarcely any amputated men have recovered After wander ing about for two hours to day I met one ac- quaintance. The emptiness, the dulness of the place are beyond description Even Theophile Gautier, who is indisputably the greatest master of adjectives now alive, would fail to find a sufficient epithet for tho present condition of the streets of Paris " Communal sadness" will henceforth feebly express it to those who have seen it, but to tho absent—and the absent are nearly all the world—that phrase can have no meaning. Excepting that we have gas, Paris is now infinitely more miserable than when I came m, just after the siege, on tho 2nd February Save at the food shops and tho ohemtsts, shut tors oro up everywhere, and evon tho butchers aro closing their doors, having no meat to soil The sun is going down in a bank of black clouds, against which httlo columns of white smoko aro rising I cannot seo tim fight, for tho houses hido it, but tlut smoko sho« s ino where it is, and tho incessant roll of explosions con- firms tho indication A woman was carried past on a door an hour ago , abo was covorod with a bluo blanket, und I could not moko out what had happened to hoi , but as sho was borno by Federates I supposed Bhohad boon hit by a shell Directly oftorwardB two omnibuBos full of dead men nero drivou post my door, oonnng from tho Porto d'Asuieres I did not seo the eight, for I had just left tho window , but my com icrge tolls mo tbo bodies woro piled up like luggago in a railway van As I write (7 30 p m ) the firing has Buddenh bocouio most violent all rouud Nomby , MontVulcuonis fun ously tin owing sholls, which aro bursting in fiont of mo like lockets ni the bouquet of a firework Yet people aro dandling along in tho street na if nothing wero tho niattei.
