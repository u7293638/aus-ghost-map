CORRESPONDENCE. Election Excitement. (To the Editor of the Herald and Advocate.) SIR,-It is understood conventional propriety among all civilised electlve bodies that when the tumult of elec tion has subsided, there should be an amnesty proclaimed to all past hostile feelings, and an abstinence observed on the one side from all hostile lan guage, and on the other side from any ungentlemanlike expressions of dis sent. But as far as Newcastle is con cerned this rule has been entirely ig nored, seeing that now the election of members for the city is over. We now find men whose expectations have been damped not only villifying but actually insulting in every manner the supporters of the successful candi dates. This they do not do in a manly and straightforward manner. No, they prefer using the newspaper as a screen to protect them from the return fire, creeping-cringing, as it were--under a norn de plume Let me ask, Is this what's termed British pluck and fairplay ? If the answer be yes, then all I have to say is, no better leadership could they procure than that of the Kiama Ghost.--I am, yours, &?., FRED. A. ZISDKA. Newcastle,'Feb 10.
