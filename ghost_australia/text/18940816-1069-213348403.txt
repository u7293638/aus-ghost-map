An Awful Tragedy. Augustus Montmorency was a bank clerk. He had recently been married to his " ownest ewn"; but alas, ho was poor, because his salary of Â£76 a year would not allow him to contract debts in the city. On a certain occasion, he dreamed a dream. "Listen," said a sepulchral voice, " at the bottom of the Cremorne Gardens, to the left of the Rotunda, there is a treasure hidden. Look ! dig, and be rich for always." The ghost went before him to show the place. He dug and found what appeared to be a brick, but on closer examination he found it to be solid gold that bad been proviously stolen from Mount Morgan. " Heavens ! " he said, " gold ! Now will I be no longer a bank masher, but I D'Arsay I will mix with princes and all the other big lawyers." But horror! he saw Vincent Dowling, the chairman of the company, and Holvoake Woodd looking over his shoulder, while the ominous words resounded in his ears 'No you don't!" Everybody witnessed his disgrace, and even Tom the bellman, kind- hearted as he is, was shocked. Agony! he heard the dread sentence from the lips of the Police Magistrate, "Transportation for life!" and he was so transported, for he awoke and found himself in the arms of his ownest own, who said, " You dined out last night and came home a little heavy you know. Sit quite still while I run away to HARBOTTLE's and get yon a lovely titbit breakfast. A nice cup of Harbottlk's 2s tea, with fresh butter, and a rasher of his lovely bacon will set you up like 1 o'olook."
