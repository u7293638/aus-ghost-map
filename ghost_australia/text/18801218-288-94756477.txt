YODNG IRELAND: FRAGMENT OF IRISH HISTORY. BY m& CHARLES GAVAK DUFFY, K.-MLG.

Six counties in UUter were confiscated, and not merely the chiefs, but Uie entire population dispossessed. The fruitful plains of Armagh, the rich pastoral glens that he between the shelter^ hills of Antrim, the undulating meadow lands stretching by the noble lakes and rivers of Fermanagh, passed from the race which had possessed them since before the redemption of mankind. It is not dim Si t0 ?* . *' inu4nnation the old race, broken by battle and suffering, and da* prived by a trick of state of their heredi tary chiefs, retiring slowly and with bitter hearts before the stranger. The alluvial lands were given to English courtiers whom the Scotch king found it necessary -o placate, and to Scotch partisans whom he dared not reward in England. The peasants driven out of the tribal lands to burrow in the hills or bogs were not treated according to any law known among civilised men. Under Celtic tenure the treason of the cbif, if he committed treason, affected them no more than the offences of a tenant for life affect a remainder man in our modem practice. Under the feudal system they were innocent feudatories, who would pass with the forfeited land to the Crown, with all their personal rights undisturbed. It was in this manner that the famous Plantation of Ulster was founded. The method of settlement is stated with commendable simplicity by the latoat historian. The 'plantators 'got aU the land woith their having; what was not worth their having — the barren mountains and trackless morass, which after two centuries in many cases still yield no human foo.1 — were left to those who in the language of an Act of Parliament of the period were ' natives of the relm of Irish blood, being desended from those who did inherit and possess the land.' The con fiscated territory amounted to two millions of acres. ?? Of these a million and a half,' says Air. Froude, ' bog, forest, and muuiiiain were restored to the Irish. The half million acres of fertile land were settled with families of Scottish and English Protestants.' The natives were not altogether content with this arrangement, and tbeir perversity has been visited with eloquent censure by indignant critics down to our own day. There is reason to believe, however, that if a settlement of Irish Catholics had been made in England by Mary or James II., on whom the best lands of Norfolk and Suffolk, Essex and Sussex, Kent and Surrey, were bestowed, while the English were left only the forest, mountain, and morass, that that just and temperate people would not entirely approve of the transaction, and might even be tempted to call it in question when an opportunity offered. The new comers have been painted in unfavorable colors by critics not unfriendly to the plantation. In many cases they were good soldiers or skilful husbandmen, who under more favorable conditions would have been an element of strength to the country. But the settlement had the fever of usurpation upon it. The rightful owners . were banished, and the planters held by no higher title than naked force ; good as long as force was on their side, but no longer. Fences were erected, fruit-trees planted, rimple churches built, and after a time white-walled bawns rose in the midst of waving cornfields and rosy orchards. It was a pleasant sight to see ; but within a punshot of the gay harvest and garden the remnant of the native race, to whom the land bad descended since the redemption, were pining in misery and bitter discon tent. The barren hills or frozen bogs to which they were banished yielded little food except the milk of their kine. 'The mountainy men,' so the new settlers con temptuously named them, would have beg^ more magnanimous than any race who have lived on this globe if the/ acquiesced pa tien'lv in the transfer, They could not forget, anv more than their kinsmen in the Scottish flighlands, that ' The fertile plain, the sof teeed vale, Were onoe the birthright of (he Gael.' t If their efforts to ?' spoil the spoiler,*** and ' from the robber rend his prey,*1* do not thrill sympathetic boudoirs, and if the scenes of their exploits are not the annual haunts of sentimental tourists)- it is not be cause the exploits were different from those ao favored, nut because an adequate poet has not vet arisen to interpret them to man kind.t The abolition of the loose method of inheritance (by which Irish lands used to paes to the right owners) was 'followed by another amelioration without which it would have been incomplete. When a ^Catholic proprietor died having children under age the king like a true father of his people undertook the charge of the orphans. A Court of Wards was estab lished for the purpose, and as James could not get a wife out of Spain for his son, on * In hi* 'Flight of ihe ftfcriB' the Rer.O.P Heehan has painted with singular power and feeling the advenfcont of CNettl and his saw ciaftes at foreign ©oorta,ba»aeohing help in vain, till at length wearj of the hopeless *a«k oh alter another laid down WfJMWfJ^fJ** foi«ig» gmve.

This device proved a most successful stroke of State policy, and with the favors and blandishmenta of the Court judiciously distributed did more than the laws of Henry and Elizabeth to win over the old families. Education is stronger than natural instincts or inherited opinions. The Jannisaaries were Christian orphans trained to be Mussulmen by the tiultan, and the most remorseless Aiwmi^ of the Celt in the next generation were O'Briens and Butlers, Fitz^eralds and Burkes, who became more English than the English themselves. The experiment in Ulster naturally pro roked imitation. Charles I. wasasea^er to plant as his father. He was represented in Ireland by a trenchant Lord Deputy, remembered in that country as 'Black Tom,' and memorable in Knglfafr history as Thomas Wentworth, Earl of Strafford. Wentworth resolved to make a settlement in Connaught to rival the settlement in Ulster. The first business wa« to clear out the owners in possession. The wildest in ventions in Candide, intended to illustrate human absurdity and wickedness, will not match the pretences on which the for feiture of these estates was founded. In the previous reign when the king substi uted ' an orderly succession' for the Celtic method, the Connaught proprietors had duly submitted and paid him a heavy fine to have their new patents enrolled in Chancery. The officers of the Court, wil fully or ignorantly, omitted to make the proper entries in their books ; and this mis feasance was declared by Court lawyers to have forfeited the lands of the province to the king. It is a maxim that no man can profit bv his own fraud ; but maxims are not made to bind sovereign princes. As the blessing of English law was now extended to the whole nation, it was necessary that this opinion should be confirmed by the judgment of a Court and the verdict of a jury. If a dozen of bis fellow countrymen found a Con naught proprietor's title bad, calumny itself must be mute. Wentworth marched to the west at the head of a formidable military force, as 'good lookers-on,' he said, and accompanied by the necessary retinue of judges and lawyers to perform the judicial ceremony. Some of the juries were frightened into verdicts ; some were wheedled into them, for to sharpen the persuasive power of the judges Wentworth secretly gave the learned personages a per centage on the forfeitures. But fn Galway the juries were of opinion that notwith standing the blunder of the officers of Chancery the land did not belong to the king, but to the owners, and found accord ingly. Wentworth's method of encounter ing this difficulty may help to mitigate our surprise that the Irish people did not cordially love the system of jurisprudence which has undoubtedly secured equal justice to many generations of Englishmen. The jurors who found a verdict according to their conscience, and not according to the wishes of the Lord Deputy, were immediately brought before the Castle Chamber in Dublin, and fined £4.009 each and their estates seized till it was paid ; a penalty the equivalent of which would impoverish many a noble of the present day.* The sheriff who summoned the jurors was dealt with in a more decisive fashion ; he was first fined and then flung into prison, where he was kept till he died of the process ; an example to future officials to array their panels more discreetly .f Nearly a generation had elapsed since the Plantation of Ulster, when the troubles between Charles and his Parliament approached a crisis. The Scots rose against the king and invaded England in the interest of the Opposition, and Charles summoned to his aid the army which Wentworth main tained in Ireland ; an army recruited in part from Irish Catholics. In the House of Commons this project evoked a storm of resistance. It was permissible to call a Scottish army into England, and it was a natural right, which nft one would be mad enough to dispute, to send an ^-gllsu army into Ireland ; bat if an Irieh army were brought into England, on any pretence whatever, that was an outrage sufficient to. release subjects Jroni their, allegiance. The Irish, who did not quite see the force of this distinction, began to bestir themselves. They heard of threats in the Commons that Popery must.be extir pated ; Pym, the leader of the JPvitans. in the House of Commons, boasted, it was ?aid, that Parliament would not leave a Papist in Ireland ; they noted the successful rebellion of the Scots ; they saw their old enemies in conflict, and toe time seemed propitious to regain their ancient lands, and to save those which remained from obse quious judges and panic-stricken juries. * Though Charles's character as a compound of egrtiem and faithleneneM is one of the most familiar studies in Boglisb history, it may borrow a characteristic touch from Irish reco da. Before these transactions he appealed in sore etreps to his Irish subjects for a grant of money ; the Catholics took bis wants into con sideration and offered the sum of £120,009, pro vided that no proprietor six:y years in uaiis tnxbed possession should be troubled respecting his title ; and that Catholics should be allowed to practise a* barristers without taking the oath of supremacy. Charles took the money, and promised the graces (as they were named) which they desired. The Puritans, however, grew daily stranger, and to keep the promise of tolerating Popery, even in so small a matter as not cheating them eut of their estates, soon became inconvenient. Some of the bishops of the Irish Establishment transmitted a fiewe remonstrance to England against any concession to Oatbolies, and as Charles was a good church man and loved his bishops, ha was sorely per plexed ; but above all there was the giory and profit of making a plantation of Connaoght no longer possible if he kept his word. Weat watjth saw an easy way out cf the difficulty ; let him simply not keep his word ; and be for his part was willing to assist so worthy a purpjse by bearing ali the blame. Charles'* whole character is painted in the two facts—that he Uprose tbe promise without scruple after he had speat the money, and thankfully aooepted Btrafford's offer to stand between him and who infamy he had incurred. t This was not Stafford's only experiment in manipolatiBgjviea. The H«ose of Commons, «o the occasion of nis impeachmeniLcitod among tbe eatalogne~of his offences in Inland -'That ierors who gave their verdict according to their enoseieoes*. wete canrarad in the O»tl» Ch»*bexlngreatloes;sosaet»snespilleried, with loss bfears, and bored through tao tougae, and aesnttisaet marked in tbe forehead with other iufacious punishments.' 8ttafforft, who was a wise! tyrant, did other wait* in Iceland however. He «ot nax-aeed from Holland, aad workmen Irani Belgium, and festtrede Uaan trade among tbellttUtow. which is prospsrons toowday. ibrtvaately for Ulster it was not a staple of *Sja«f_._ ? ,.--^-^r.«- * Roger Moon, a man greatly gifted both U project and to persuade, and whom con temporaries of all parties pronounce of unblemished honor, brought leading men together, kindled them with his own con victions, and in fine there was now ? genuine conspiracy on foot to seize the ? seat of government and summon the , Irish race to arms. The servant of I one of the conspirators betrayed his j master, several of the leaden were asixed, ( and the government in Dublin put effectually ; on their guard. But the North was beyond j their control. There the clans wh? were j pillaged by James, or their immediate descendants, rose on an autumn night forty thousand strong, led by Sir Phelim O'Ne.U and other chiefs of their own blood, drove out the English and Scotch settlers, and re possessed themselves of their ancient tribal lands. This is the transaction known to English writers as the 'Great Popish Re bellion,' and the ** Popish Massacre.' By whatever contumelious nickname it may be branded, what happened in Ireland is what would have happened in any branch of the human family. When a favorable oppor tunity offered they ' spoiled the spoiler.' So the Saxons dealt with their Norman conquerors, as far as their power and op. portunity permitted, and the Dutch with their Spanish conquerors, and the Sicilians with their French conquerors. Though there were dreadful excesses committed by both parties in the end, it is certain beyond all controversy, that the first aim of the Iru-h was to regain their own without anv sacrifice of life. When blood is shed it is like kindling the prairie, no one can any longer pretend to limit the devastation. But there were some signal instances of moderation; certain priests, it is recorded, concealed fugitives under their altars;* ar.d a bishop of the Protestant Establish ment, who had distinguished himself by humane conduct in his day of power, was permitted in the very focus of the insurrec tion, to fill his house with English settlers, and shelter them from all molestation. The contemporary accounts of the transaction are quite as untrustworthy as the narra tives of Titus Gates and his confederates. The tettlera depended absolutely on the support of England for maintaining their position. Many of them had suffered grievously, and the remainder were in danger of losing the fruit of all their toil and enterprise. What sort of stories they sent to Westminster under such circumstances to inflame the zeal of their partisans may be conceived. All Puritan England was ready to believe, and eager to hear, new marvels of Irish iniquity. Pious tears and rage were excited by a description of the ghoats of murdered Protestants appearing in broad daylight, day after day, on the bridge of 1'ortadown, wringing their hands and ut tering piercing shrieks for an avenger. One peculiarly stubborn ghost held his ground for more than a month. A bishop was among the witnesses of these impressive facts ; which exhibited, as one can conceive, heaven itself among the allies of the planta tors. The theory finally adopted by English and Anglo-Irish writers generally with respect to this transaction, when the clouds of prejudice and misrepresentation were blown away, is perplexing to human reason, 'lo seize the hereditary landa of the Irish race, and drive out the in habitants from the pastoral valleys and rich alluvial plains which they and theirs had enjoyed since the dawn of history, wasa wise stroke of statemanship it seems; but to seize the same lands occupied for a single generation by English settlers, and drive out the inhabitants, in order to replace the original population in their own posses sions, was a crime of incredible greed and cruelty. Fairly judged at this day, it must be admitted that the transfer of the land back to its original owners was made with as little premeditated violence as in any agrarian revolution with which it can be fairlv brought into comparison. Bloody reprisals were the custom of the age. In the Netherlands, in Italy, and in France the faction of the Catholics and the faction of the Reformers killed and ravaged with out remorse. That a race whose chiefs had been trapped like wild blasts, or assassi nated in the very oflices of hospitality, among whom the tragedy of the PaGctta Hibernia, and the kindred tragedy of the Plantation were performed, should have been stung into no 4sa^'JY; a humor will be for ever a marvel ta m«n who have studied iiZT hbiUav «4 Jjuman nature. The outrages shamefully exaggera'**** *.?£ no part of the original design. The risi^e/ when it fell under the guidance of Roger O'More, finally swelled into a revolution, had its Parliament at Kilkenny, to which Charles sent ambassadors, and its armies iu the field, to which in the end he would gladly have committed his cause, and con ducted its measures with notable clemency and modei ation.f In the Irish Parliament, known as the Confederation of Kilkenny, the Catholics of both races were fully represented. Owen O'Neil, known in Irish annals as Owen Roe, a soldier who had acquired skill and ex perience in the armies of Spain, c*me to the aid of his countrymen. Throughout the war he exhibited sagacHf , soldiership, and patriotism, but he was constantly thwarted by the Anglo-Irish, who were more solicitous for the security of Oharles than for the rights of the nation. It is the glory of Hampden and Falkland to have loved England better than they loved the king; ana Owen Roe certainly* loved '* Leland's History of IrtUmd.

They did not succeed in escaping from bondage, but the wrath of their keepers at the attempt deserves the sympathy of mankiod in ta* same measure as the rage of a slave-drivar whose tranquUity has been disturbed by unexpected resistance to the lash. When Charles was deposed and executed, Cromwell carried his victorious army acroas the Channel to conquer Ireland for the Commonwealth. His campaign was as coldly merciless as was Alva's in the Netherlands, or CareVs in Desmond. We are assured on high authority that he was in truth a humane and beneficent ruler, who only struck hard because it was neces sary to execute divine justice on the authors of the Ulster rising. In pursuance of this meritorious policy he besieged Drogheda, which waa held for the king, and put to the sword the entire garrison and the popula tion of all ages and both sexes, nobody being spared. The massacre continued for two days, and a score or two inhabitants -who alone escaped were sent as slaves to the tobacco plantations. Among the gar rison was an English regiment, commanded by an English cavalier* and as Drogheda always lay within the English pale, where the native Irish were long forbidden to in habit a walled town, the traders and citizens were almost without exception Catholic of English blood. He repeated this lesson of divine justice at Wexford. There the garrison and population were Irish, but Irish of the south ; there is no reason to believe that it contained one soldier or citizen who had ever crossed the Bovne, or been any more associated with Sir* Phelim O Neill than with Praise God Barebones. The modern justification for these massacres is, therefore, somewhat de fective in its f acts.f Cromwell was now undisputed master, and a period followed which we are ex horted to recognise as the sole era when an authentic God-given ruler made divine justice prevail in the land. Of his divine government of Ireland the naked facts are these : — Two years after the war was at an end, and when the fighting men of Ireland to the number of 40,000 had been en couraged to take service with Spain, he drove out by beat of drum the entire Catholic population of three provinces, excepting only hinds useful to hold the plough or herd the docks of the conqueror. Aged men and women, feeble and sickly persons, many who were protected by general treaties, others who were protected by special terms of submission, some who had received personal guarantees for per sonal services, were driven across the iSha&non; to nnd a shelter if they could a aiong the bogs of Connaught, and their lan-is divided among his soldiery. Peers aud knights who had fought for the king, to whom they had sworn allegiance, were held by the representative of divine justice to -have incurred this penalty. If they re turned they became liable to capital punish ment. Of the children of the poorer people, seized in a rope like Herod's, he caused 1,000 boys to be kidnapped and sold as slaves in the West Indies, and 1,000 innocent Irish girls to be sent to Jamaica to a fate which would scarcely be adequately avenged if the authentic ruler spent an eter nity in the region to which the cavilier toasts consigned him. The admitted aim of the Lord Protector was to extirpate the Irish race, and his policy is still known among them as the ' Curse of Cromwell.' If this be indeed the art of divine government it was afterwards practised more suooeasf uliy in the fusillades and noyades o£ the French Jacobins, and in the fiul^&rian; atrocities painted by a modern orator ; and it reaches its perfection in the management of a prize by pirates, when, the crew are made to walk the plan^y »nd the booty distributed among the ^ietom, Cromwell s conduct is still defended en, the same fanatical pre tences employed to justify the expulsion of the Huguenots from France, the Moors from Spain, the Jews from England, and the Christians from Japan, and the grounds are good for all of them, or, as I believe, for none Of them J Before Cromwell's policy was carried to ?'^uplete success the Be£tOlft*l0tt Jjrought hu»\r th * '^u&rts.; Charles IT. having com ejected from their estates ln -k^ turned his attention to Irelanu. The enemies of his house wen in possession of the lands confiscated under Cromwell; and the friends of his house, .the original pro prietors, who were the last to lay down arms for his father, some of whom had snarea ms own exue, were in penury ana destitution. It was a case needing prompt hmidling, and Charles handled it with un usual promptitude. To pacify the Irish Puritans he confirmed the settlement of property under the Commonwealth. That is to say, Cromwell had given to his soldiers the estates of all tbe Catholic gentlemen who had fought for the house of Stuart, and the restored house of Stuart preciously confirmed the arrangement. Charles would probably have preferred doing justice if justice could be done without much personal inconvenience. But he loved bis harlots and jesters too well to run risks, and to do justice in this matter was made difficult by a sentiment always powerful in England: a sentiment whkh has created a perpetual barrier between the two nations, aaof which while it exists will never suffer them to smite. His English Parlia xneat, crowded with Cavaliers and rettrnsd exiles, would -not have belsed him to displace Englishmen, though they were) Oiww^wfftnw, ? to male puce for Irishmen, though they won Rotahsts.

This was tha reign of the 'Merri. Monarch, a time of national enjoyment and revelry in England, interrupted only by an English Popish plot and maasanro am deliberate and bloody than the plot ami massacre in Ulster, over whkh history is m clamorous. The plot was the famous uvaja* tion of Titus Gates ; the mawaciri. the trial, conviction and murder of his victims far eighteen months, whose execution wanton merrily lone; after judges and juriaa bad ceased to believe a syllable of tbeovideaoa.

When James II. embroiled l--t¥*tftt with his English subjects by attempting to mfV^ changes by royal prerogativ*, wnich could only be legitimately made by Act of Par liament, he sought support in Inland. The Iribh never loved James, but bis piisjwit offences were not such as could nasonabtr be expected to move their indignation. But was a Catholic, and he sought to extend relipieus liberty to Catholios and Dia senttrs. If his method waa harsh and arbitrary, the boundaries of royal prerog* tive were ill-defined, and nations have never been alow to condone offences com mitted in their own interest. A. litUe laUr the strictest Scottish Whigs forgave W0 linm for suspending laws by nis rojal autho rity in Scotland; though suspending laws by royal authority was the offence for which his predecessor had been driven from the throne. James seleoted as Lord Lieutenant in Ireland Bachard Talbot, the head of an Anglo- Norman house which still remained Catholic, created him Doke of Tyrconnel, and gave him his 4M»njHflffnO» . in a degree unusual to his frigid nature. Talbot is credited with a plentiful cata logue of vices by .tingliah writes*. It I* probable that he was boastful and profli gate, and perhaps unvexadoas, but he was certainly bold, resolute, and devoted to hta master and to the nation he was sent to- rule. We must judge him by hit age and? hit contemporaries. H* was far from bains; so unscrupulous a partisan as Shaf iesbury. tbe spokesmaa of resistance in England, and he: was a generous and chivalrous gentle man compared to the hero of 31enh*imand Mslplaquet. When a consniaBf to brinf in the Prine* of Orange began to be talked of, Talbot disarmed a large number of Pro testant gentlemen, whom to suspected of sympathy with William, and armed and regimented the native, population whom h* kn ;w to be friendly to James.
