Battlers. 'Ti6 a class of men belonging to these soul-forsaken years : Third-rate canvassers, collectors, journalists—and auctioneers. They arc never very shabby, they are never very spruce. Going cheerfully and carelessly and smoothly to the deuce. Some are wanderers by profession, " turning up " and gone as soon, Trav'ling second-class or steerage (when it's cheap they go saloon); Free from "ists" and "isms," troubled little by belief or doubt— Lazy, purposeless, and useless—knocking round and hanging out. They take what they can get, and they give what they can give, God alone knows how they manage—God alone knowR how they live! They are nearly always hard-up, but are cheerful all the while— Men whose energy and trousers wear out sooner than their smile !
