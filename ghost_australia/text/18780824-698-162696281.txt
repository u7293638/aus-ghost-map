[?] Love is an intoxication. ' Yes,' says a sour bachelor, ' but a year of matrimony will sober you up.' The man who ' couldn't trust his feelings ' is supposed to dp business strictly on the cash principle. An old bachelor is a man who, tiirough selfish motives, has refrained from making some woman wretched. An English aurist was bo remarkably clever that, having exercised his skill on a very deaf lady, who had been hitherto insensible to the nearest and loudest noises, she had tho happiness next day of hearing from her husband in Aus tralia. ' There's our Jeremiah,' said Mr. Shelton, ' ho went off to make his own living by his wits.' 'Well, did he succeed ?' inquired a friend. 'No,' said the old man, with a sigh, and significantly tapping his head, ' he failed for want of capital.' we are uuormcu uiui mo pneu oi uiuiiiuuub wan ubvÂ« bo low at present, and now is a favourable time to purchase them.'

The phonograph may bottle up the voice and pass it down to future ages ; but the smile that twists the face of a man as he seeks solitude and gazes upon his name in print for the first time, will always nave to be e^ucssed at.
