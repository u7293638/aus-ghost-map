West Melbourne Election Once More. REMEMBER the dodges of Bryan the brave, When the tricks of that hero are o'er, When lost to West Melbourne, and sold as a slave, He sits in the Supreme Court once more. The ghosts of the dead, which twice over have poured Their bones to the ballot, have fled ; But the voice of each ghoul remains on record, To bewig his dignified head. West Melbourne, when Jerry established the price Of thy votes and thy voters unfair, Did he not then intend that a Justice should rise On the ruins of honesty there ? Go Francis, whose cause we shall never resign, Go tell our corrupter the Graeme, That 'tis better to fight once again and oft lime Than to keep such a relic of shame. Forget not the venal electors who came On the day of dispute to your side ; When the tool at the Railway cried out a false name, They shamed not, but voted and lied. That seat, which won shadows though bench near at hand, Shall be changed for the ermine and red, Oh, Bryan, blush not when you leave your fal?e band To find that their false one had fled.
