UPPER YARRA SHIRE ELECTION. TO THE" EDITOR OF THE LILYDALE EXPHESS SIB—Will you permit me through your paper to comment upon your Upper Y T arra correspondent's report in last Saturday's issue referring to the election and why I was not returned. He states if I had not allowed myself to be persuaded to leave the Council table the result would have, no doubt, been different. I wish to inform your correspondent that I have got a will of my own, and "never allow any one to persuade or influence me in any way. It is quite evident to me whoever your correspondent may be, from the general reports ui the paper, he is of that flimsey nature himself. If he was to report the proceedings of the Council on that particular day, and give both sides of the question, the public could judge for themselves if the councillors who left the table were in the right or wrong. I should certainly do so again under similar circumstances, even if it were the cause of losing my election. I, for one out of a majority ot seven, would not attend another meeting to be sat upon by one dissenting councillor even if he were President. Before finishiug a word to the "Ghost." Iam pleased to see the election has satisfied some people conspicuously " Mr John Ewart," though i think he should be one of the last to comment upou the conduct of the councillors in the past, considering it is to their generosity he owes since leaving " The Howe" his present shelter.—I am, &c.;, JOHN C. WILDMATF Warburton, August 2Sth, 1S90.
