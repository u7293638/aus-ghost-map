For a month past, crowds have assembled in the square in front of the Cathedral of Eazan, attracted by the report that the ghost of the late Czar had been seen to enter and to leave the Cathedral, with an aide-de-camp, disappearing in the crypt of the sacred building. The news of the marvel uaving ueen sent to U-atschma, where the Eussian Court is residing, the Czar o-ave orders that the two spectres should be' ar rested. This being done, it was found that the supposed ghosts were two men skilfully, dressed up to represent the personages that wished to passed themselves off as such.' The strangest part of the story, however, is the probability that the pretended gho'sts were part of a new plot against the life of the Cisar. Belying on the superstition in the character of tho present Czar, the conspira tors reckoned on his imitating Hamlet, and resolving to question his father's ghost. While ho conversed with the supposed spirit' the bolt of a trap-door was to be drawn, when the Emperor would fall into the vaults, where his assassins awaited him. The local journals have been instructed to say nothing of these discoveries.
