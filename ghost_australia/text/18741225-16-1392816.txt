The Gold King. A NEW YEAR'S TALE. By Dii.vMiSGO. Must ache mr was anything but a likely township , like the dog in had had its day, and now that its day was done, the night seemed to have descended doubly dark upon the wretched spot. Some years before, a wandering prospector ' dropped upon a small patch of gold , much, as usual, magnified the amount of the find, and a rush set in upon the doomed place in less than a month it had returned almost to its primitive state of solitude The hastily run up stores and public houses had been taken down, the less pretentious habitations of bark and saplings had been left to fall to pieces at leisure by their original cost actor », and but one place which combined within itself the attractions both of store and public house, remained to supply the wants of the few fossickers who still struggled for a living and the chance of hull It will therefore be seen that Mulluckvdie was scarcely a township in her em any man whose unhappy) lot did not for doom it, would choose of his own accord d to spend the festive season which is supposed to usher in a new year Home Duval was perhaps the most wretched specimen of humanity to be found in Mullock ville on the particular New Year s Eve I am writing of He had come with the rush and had remained there ever since his periodical evil but, scanty as they were, were all sacrificed at the altar of Bacchus The time had been when Tom was a compn inv el) respectable member of society , but sobs duty and he had long since cut out another, and now-well, he was call ed j a desirable acquaintance The clock struck 11 John looked out of the door of the public house, and into the cool for esh night His own funds were exhausted , few of the residents of Nlulluckville were in a condition to shout, and he had not yet reached the condition in which he delighted to go to bed He smiled the night in for a few moments, then turned his head and looked back into the bar longings) he looked at the bottles, beseechingly at the proprietor, contemptuously at the only other customer, who had money) and would not spend it, then "like a blast au ii) he passed out into the night Adow in the rambling apology for a street, haunted on either hand by the skeletons of houses, or the most substantial d looking sheets of bark humpies, but they were but dear ghosts, elie "beds that had inhabited them had passed away, and were making men j elsewhere No publican in snow) shut tame and asked him to step in is he passed no songs echoed from the the interior. Here and there flickering camp fires shone out, but the owners were courting sleep, and dreaming of the fortunes then picks were jet to pay for them Tom sauntered on until the du k mounds of earth around told of the seat for gold He reached the old chum of the luck) prospector, and in a fit of spleen cursed his luck for not having been the man to strike it Musing on his bad fortune, he ascended the rugged pile of dirt, and throwing himself down on the top, gazed into the black mouth of the shaft ' I've a good mind to taken header into it, he thought, but like a good many men before him, he had a better mind not to do so, so i em wood where he was "How light it seems down then it was the next thought that crossed his mind, and then the unmistakeable sound of human voices str neck upon his ear He lifted his head and listened silence all al found Ag un he stooped his head into the shaft, and heard the murmur of many voices "there must be a lot of fellows up the drive He listened intently) , a burst of laughter, a short silence, and then a wonderfully clear and powerful voice began singing Cotuiali it mildly tliuiM0u Of ii 1 nig i st at I n a (U ¡h t with money into] 1 No I liar if on can Since tilt) will be in V knit with such power as you 1 Theiuxiio tiofco the I una ot in No No healer I can t fills 911 ss for beauty and mirth Fille v I i Allworth They are all of them st ives to gold At the end of each verse a chorus of many voices took up the last line, and repeated it as a refrain , then again the singer went on I humble the in our Vu 1 can laugh aloud M tim till! till tales that are told Of honor labourer for to the Tis but a.] lot To beat down honor with colds I have great and breath At ni} t neck and cuff Men she lies at his will 1 more 1 Look look at the world is in I "Veil may ever be found 1 To barter their teams for gold The song ended, and a short silence succeeded , the glare of light suddenly shone in the bottom of the shaft, as though a door in the side had been opened A dark figure crossed this pith of light, a strange scrambling noise followed, and before Tom could recover from his son prise, or attempt Dight, the figure was beside him. "Come,' said a deep voice, and a hand was laid on his Boulder such a hand the fingers, hind is steel, seemed to bury themselves into his flesh, and he felt there was no escape The engine caught him up in its strong arms, and the next moment they stood at the bottom of the old shaft He followed his guide on hands and knees along the drive at the bottom too astonished for would of Resistance, the) posted through a door at the end, and worn was a scene such is mortal never saw before A mass golden man apparently sit in regal state at the head of a long table Opposed to him, at the foot, wall being of silver and ringed down both sides were forms and figures of such dazzling lustre that horn s bloodshot eyes winked again. It was not then dresses that caused the splendid reflect, the light and brilliance seemed to radiate from the faces, their eyes emitted flashes like lightening and glancing down the bond, ever) color and shade of color sparkled in rays of fire from the e strange creatures Tom's guide left hand standing a few paces from the entrance, and took 1 vacant seat on the king s right-hand Tom saw that he was gigantic being his features were noble and stem looking, though his color was jet black-not a dull black, but bright and sparkling, at intervals, his face seemed to glow like heated metal On the left hand of the king was a precisely) similar figure Of the king s face, Tom could make nothing , it seemed ever changing from a m m s to a woman, from a soldier to a priests, but through them all, the lips wore a sheer Although the) all seemed carousing, and the table was covered with eatables and flasks of having, then faces bore no trace of mirth, but one and all looked hard and stem They all turned then blazing eyes upon Tom as he stood there a picture of human degrada- tion and the lang, after an earnest gaze at him, as he stood bewildered where his guide had left him, with a grim snide said, What's yours I ' Never before had Tom been at a loss for an answer to such a question Now his tongue failed, and conscious that the whole of that brilliant company were looking mockingly) at him, he could only at last feebly stammer, " W hats as you like. ' At a sign from the king, the drink right hand man arose, and filling a glass a 4th some colorless liquid, approached him and offered it to him Net veil by the thought that nothing could make his situation much better, form, shorn no liquor ever daunted before, seized the glass and swallowed the contents Instantly) his finale grow light and buoyant, n sum glow can see through every vein , he was a new man " Shako j yourself, said the king He did so, and is he said afterwards, shook his body of Acs, surely) that was duty, drunken Tom Duval lying in a heap on the ground Then what was he He could not tell, he only knew that he looked with its utterable nothing on his late boil), now lying motionless and hello s at his feet " His body was found huddled up in a heap at the bottom of a deserted shaft, and he was supposed to have fallen down during one of his drunken fits A verdict of accidental death was returned, said the king, in a sing song voice, as though leading from a newspaper lout shuddered the lights e on the floor looked horribly) like course The king nose, and looking at a clock, said, "Al) friends her as to our next meeting-this day twelve months The glasses were filled and emptied "five minutes to 12 Good night, ill, and the silver man, and vanished "Good-night he echoed through the cavern, and the golden king and from iv ei e alone " Come with me the king » ud, beckoning to him, and opening a door at one end of the cavern born advanced, and followed him through Instantly) he found him self flying through space and utter darkness with frightful i Specht) A sudden shock brought him to a halt, and he was conscious that the King was beside him, opening a door, through which a stream of light gushed out "We are now in the centre of the nth, said the king, pulsing with the half opened door in his hand. Somch jw from felt no « hit astonished at the information He) entered by a vast hall, like the interior of some might) cathedral, a venerable old man was seated in an easy chair, before a brightly) burning file, his long white bead lying down upon the ground and he sat and gazed into the fire in a drowsy, abstracted milliner, with half shuttles short distance from him, a very dirty man was waiting with great haste on the left page of a thick v same Neither of them took the slightest notice of the king or his com pmion as the) advanced to miss the fine Gold stationed himself in front of the the place, his back to the warmth, and nodded to come to take possession of in unoccupied child standing near He did so, and his attention was soon t taken up watching the strange freaks the burning embers seemed to be playing Like living things, the glowing coals climbed up over each other, changed, and allowed their positions until they had formed what appeared to come to be the model of a fine town As he looked, the likeness grew more and more distinct stately) buildings, beautiful churches, and wide streets shone out in limestone Al! appealed perfect, when the old man in the clean slightly way ed his hands, with a low laugh, and they all cr tumbled into ishes V noise at the far end of the hill div el ted his gaze for in these strange pi proceedings I He looked and saw a number of men i fish in, laden with large sticks, the contents of which the) emptied on to the floor These contents appeared to be thousands of pieces of white paper, and the help thus formed soon begun to assume astonishing dimensions " A hat can they be thought torn " Good resolutions, bind the king, answering his unspoken thought " But the) 11 come to nothing, heaps of them every) year His successor, and he nodded tow at ds the silent figure still waiting as though for life, " will put them through a letter) "Phi) no said the ancient regime in the ohm, appaientlystiirtmgup out of deep musings '' The naughty) little (luck I îeiiieiiibei^hei well, but she hadn't half the figure Cleopatra had, and he chuckled feebly) "Pshaw ' said Gold " I know as much about them as You do, and he glanced contemptuously at the other But the old man went on mumbling out aloud, " Yes, yes ' She stood out a long time , but I was too much for her Could it beat Old time" The door through which Tom and the king had entered here opened, and a we asked m, be like the man writing at the table that John started In all respects save one, they were exactly similar, and that one was, that whilst one was outrageously dirt) (in fact, seemed rapid!) growing wot se), the new comer wits painfully) clean and neat The new ii in an walked up to the silent figure still writing haul, and stood waiting beside him, glancing once up to a clock over the fireplace Tom looked up too, the hands were nearly on the stroke of 12 Every body was silent, save the bus) figures at the for end of the hall The seconds crept on, and suddenly a height) boom burst forth rev ember it ing through the loft) hall like thunder mother and mother Time started from his chin "in, which he said "Bonaparte at it again' " Sit down, ' said Gold "It's only the New A cn At the sixth stroke, the dirt) figure sprang from his dear, and before the seventh could sound, the clean man had seized his leliuqiiiEked place and pen, and was hard at work on the first page of a new volume The relieved scribe came towards the fire, ) awning w eat fly, and nodded carelessly to Gold " 1 fired I said the latter "Rather, returned the other "You've got to tell him ill about it,' and Gold nodded towards Time " Yes , and he is getting deaf ' "He's a poor creature !
