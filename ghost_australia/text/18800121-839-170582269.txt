THE F.IMINIMN IltKLVNU. ' At tho piiblio mooting hold in Sydnoy on. Jan uuiy 12to initiuto a movement for tho roliof of the -distroHHed. ..Irish... peasantry, .' Archbishop Vuughun wiis ono of tho. principal spoakorH.

I will seloet throo of thorn. -I rumumborod, thon, iu study- ? ,ittg the Poet Sponcor, ono passago in his prose works whioh'.I have ' iiim* forgotten. Ho had' bqon prosontod with 3001) acros of land, part of tho Desmond property which had boon confis tuitod. This was in tho sixteenth century. Sponcor, who himsolf, if we.^niay boliovo Boa Jonson, died from ' laok^l bread,' visited his ontiito and dpsoribos tho wiasuhts thus : Out of every corner of the woMs and glynnia they »- cuiae orooniug forth upon thoir bunds, for their lugs could not boor thorn. . Thov looked like uuatomios of de^th^-thoy spake liko ghosts .cry ing out of thoir gfnvos — they uto the dead car rion, happy- whon thoy could fiiid them; yea, ? 'nnd one another soon after ; i'usomuoh thut tho very ourcussos thov spurod not to ficrapo out of their gmvo*.' What could possibly bo more jt . ? ' frightful tliuu thnt piutiirn P I turned from it. &L;^ttte?tK ?I remomWrod ihe'fiimino of 1739^.1740, and ^IRifr'ft 1741, of . which history snya little. In 1741, f1-'- ^ 400,000 Irishmoh are said to have perished from' want. Ono small ^village buried 500. For a timo thoy subsisted on gross, docks, and nettles. 'I havo soon' says an eyo' witness, 'the labourer endeavouring to work at his spvdo, but fainting for want of food, uml forced to quit it. I havo seon the aged fathor eating gross liko a*-~^ v bonst,_ and in tho nngnish of his soul wishing $?&, -^ for his dissolution. I' havo soon tho helpless '^* ' ''!' orplian oxpoHod.on tho dunghill, and none to *' take him in for four of infection ; and I havo ? soon tho hungary infant sucking at tho. breast & of tho ulrotuly expired piirout. Tho famine of '. , 1847 afforded mo similar pictures of hoartrond iiig distress. .. (Hoar, hear.) I rocullod the efforts .of the pcoplo in 1846 to mako good : tho lossos . of . tho previous year. I roinombor the fierce ouorgy with which they worked. .(Ohoora.)' I' recollpct the blasting of thoir hopes whon in ono single night tho groan orop ovor hill and in '., the fertile vulloy was shrivelled and blackened . . by the uuivorsnl blight. Tlio population wore '. ' litorully drivon into their graves. Thoir former '! . . . energy hud turned to a stolid, silont despair. ... ^ It wus a common sight to see tho cotter ana hia wj family sitting on the foueo of their littlo hold- v iug, looking silently und with, a vacant sta,re ., :,i upon the blank crop of blighted promise, which ;. ''. thoy hud worked hard to plant, out which .ifrds ''.'. rotten in tho'«iirth. You might address them, und thoy would not speak to you; You might try to choor them, but it was too lato. They '. felt their hour had como, nnd that thoy had to follow others to tho gravo. Ouo might crawl away,- at night, and rost in som'o doorway,, put of the -iiicionlight : on ojioniug tho door in ? tho morning, tho master of the houso found' a '' ?';??. corpso. ?-Tho sjiirifc lia'l depiirtoil to its dybi1- .' .' . Iitstins: rost;. Others would lie down to dream of feasting enl fullness; hnd wako up to starve , urid to die. It soeuied as if the peasant .world ,of Irolaud, thairnnblu'raeo', was ab-iolutoly com- ..., ing_ to an end.' Th'se wore some of the thoughts ... wliieh passed through my mind, some pj. tho . pioturos that presented tb*oui8olvos. But what .. huvqthey to do with tho pi-esont distress?' 'I found that thoy had much to do with it,' For -..'. I romomborod, first, that all famines are' .much' , tho samo in thoir aspouts of distress, utict'that, whon 1 thought how much tho Irish popple had. suffered in tho past, I folt all tho mevb moved to assist them in thoir prosont necessity. . (Choors.) Secondly, I could m soino y ay moa- - sure' the nrbsont exigency by tho exigencies. ;bf former times; und I eamo to tho conclusion' ???.'.'.?'?? that tho prosonfc position of the Irish poople ut ' home culls moro loudly than over for our prompt assistance. (Cheers.) Thank God, we do' not kuow what lamino is hero ; but we do know . '. what flood is. Add your own floods to an Irish . famine — mid .starvation from hunger, 'to' starva- ; tiqn from colil, wet, aud uxposuve, and you have , a, picture of tho prosont distress. Add what j you . ( know yoursolvos to whut I have doscribedj .and yon will thon bo able, in part at loast, to grasp. ^ \ tho nooetttities, tlio crying wants oi ; the Vp'rosont ? ?oaso. (Choers.) I nan see now. in imagination, a peasant family in- Ireland. Tho old, mari|and,- -A. ,'J- ' his wifo, and his son and his wifo', and tho.littlo children. : Tho early promise of ..a: .crop' haa ended in blight and rottenness ';' She' littlo fiold , of . com is under water ;'*tlvo'. cot. iu whioh they '.'. livo is BOttked/with thewinfor's ruin; and shrielu|iwi£k'tho winter wind. Thoro is no smoke 'from tho big chimney— for there is no ' firo— the turf is soiikod, uud is molting into a blaok slimo. They are all shivering in damp rags, huddlod. together — you can scarcoly .say '? thoy have uny olotlujs. Look at tho old ninn. Ho wears tho Victoria Cross. Ho batfclod.in tho ? tronehos iu tlio Crimeti, and his brothors, and those before him — thoy wero always to tho front whore tho British 'flag .was — (loud cheers) —always roudy for tho forlorn hopo, to spill _ ^ their livos for. tho glory of the Empire - (Choors.) . * y. Look at the youngor woman. Sho cannot last .?.'??,:'' long. All her children aro not with hor. Ono , ' fell in South Africa, und sho' wopt as bitter : . tours us any Empross over wopt over the corpse of hor only son. (Choors.) Another is in Aus tralia freo-selofcting, active, eribrgotie, and well to do ; the rest are rouud her knob b'ogging for food, which she oannot givo them. I sooni. to . .' sop three hands stretched out towards Australia; '.-;.- a chUd's.'a woman's, and a man's. ?
