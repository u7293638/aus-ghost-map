THE EUROPEAN MAIL BY the P and O. Company's steamer Carthage there are mails to the 23rd May eli from Europe - OLD COUNTRY NOTES [FROM OUR LONDON CORRESPONDENT] Good Friday, 1883 Lady Florence Dixie, I think, is entitled to monopolise my first paragraph to day Whether, however, to invite you to offer her the tribute of j our admiration of pity I cannot for the life of me determine I wonder how the wires represented to the Courier the alleged outrage at Windsor a Often, when something sensational occurs here, I speculate as to the v ei sion that the electric telegraph will be ish to my Australian friends You got a last imp ex sion. I expect, and the pi o orb tully enough says that first impressions are lasting On Monday, therefore, you may have been horrified at the account of an attack upon Lady Flour fine Dixie by two his, men dressed in women's clothes We had the news in London on Sunday, and on Monday the papers were as full as they could make themselves of the story The Queen had sent condolence, the Prince of Wales had little sympathy, there had been called by hundreds, and, most important of all, the Morning Post related how John Brown, the Queen's footman, had walked over the scene of the attack, had pronounced it very good, and had offered to have Lady Florence Dixie's dog photographed, at my own expense, if nobody else 'll pay for it " But when on Monday afternoon a question was asked about the matter in the House, and again on Tuesday, there sclerosis of laughter Pool Lady Florence Dixie There are actually very large numbers of her fellow count i men and women who do not believe a word of her story The police authorities do not. The Home Office declines to offer a reward, much to Lady Florence disgust Half the news papers say that she was under a delusion Some hint that she invented the story, others content themselves by pointing out that the cuts in the dress, and the appearance of the ground after the sun gale, do not in any way corroborate the narrative. Some pretend to pity Lady Hoicnce, expressing sarcastic surprise that an adventurous woman, who c books represent her as so brave, should faint and lose her head in an emergency I assume that you know the details of the story What I wish to add is that it is very little believed in, and that the daily statements made by Lady Florence to her inter viewers shows that she has an ov ern ceiling opinion of his importance in Irish affairs The reason for this in gallant treatment of a lady is threefold the story is unlikely and uncorroborated , she is a Queensbury and wildness of word and deed is not an uncommon peculiarity of his The sensation had a very fair chance of a good run, coming as it did so soon after the attempted blowing up of a Government budd mg Of this, up to the present time, we know absolutely nothing but the hire facts of the occurrence The police have no clue, and will probables in other affairs of the kind, wait for one until some informs- grounds upon his friends But for the simultaneous attempt to blow uptheiij/iÂ«9ofhcc, as to which their minite mixture found in the Chingtu was sits an the questioned belief, it would be open to us to suppose that the explosion in Charles street might be accounted for both ways Nothing, of course, under the circumstances will prevent the wide spread belief that the wicked attempt was the work of 1 ennuis, 01 Land Leaguers The flight of Egan Byrne, and the rest to America, and the speeches they and Russia have made there in response to interviewers, far on the supposition 1 he gets all result is that 300 additional police have been engaged, double watches placed everywhere, mm real alarm, and a sort of "Down with the lush feeling amongst 1 nghshnicii A Lu spool employs write to the Press to say he will discharge every business in his suite, and, I am son to say, there are some newspapers that applaud this intention, and hint at i c in miss if the no time more acts of violence The fact is vic- the in our present mood, lately to assume any thing against Ireland and the bush We want no prompting to jump at conclusions Just is the ii, And lo confessions of Carey were at once accepted as an oven truth, so the explosion in Pin is unent street and the alleged attack on Lady 1 for the Dixie, ate in some quarters accepted out of hand is the deeds of Irishmen Of course the feeling is a naturalness and they have only themself este blame but if the feeling be enemy aged, and in any lush spurt fostered amongst the ignorant and pi convinced of this country, we have much misery reforms in the mc in tune vic are not exactly happy Wnttcn tin cats have been four aided anon) mously to the cate that Parliament is to be blown up, and that public buildings and ships are to be weekdays warning to the country it huge This is not pleasant I have to attend the enthronement of the Archbishop of Canterbury next Thursday, and I know that letters have been received warning all and sundry j that Canterbury Cathedral has to be blown upon that day for all this confusion and panic there is but one thing, and that is patience The enthronement of an Archbishop is not to die out to other subjects-a particularly imposing ceremony, though it is highly in teresting and important Until the time of Archbishop Sumner the enthronement was done by pi ox A canon or a dean took the primate's place the ceremony really consists of two formal inductions First the Archbishop is inducted as Bishop of the diocese, and then as Primate The latter involves the setting up of the famous marble churn, in which it is said the Saxon kings of Kent used to be crowned At the most sceptical computation this chair cannot be of more i recent date than the thirteenth century It takes to pieces and is only used for these enthronements The Archbishop sits in it while the Archdeacon, who is the acting manager, as it were, of the affair, inducts, masters, and enthrones him in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost Other wise the ceremony is confined to a huge procession of clergy in surplice and hood, and to ordinary morning service It is a great day of course in Canterbury, and the mayor, and corporation take part in the proceedings X hire are generally one or two representatives in the procession of a French Protestant Church This arises from a curious custom Queen Elizabeth received certain French and Flemish refugees with kindness, and gave them the S ni liege of worshipping in the crypt of Canterbury Cathedral The descendants of the exiles enjoy the privilege to this day, and their re- presentatives naturally take a place in this cnthromsation procession Compared with ceremonies in the Roman and Greek Churches with their banners, canopies, incense, and gorgeous vestments our very highest cathedral spectacles are severely simple, as they are intended to be The popularity of the Most Reverend Father in God, Edward White Benson. D D, will ensure a large attendance of both bishops, clergy, and lay men next week. The death of Sir George Jessel, Master of the Rolls, on Tuesday morning, has been for lowed by elaborate obituaries in the papers, and from them the ordinary public probably team for the first time how great a lawyer he was in the legal profession he has for many years been recognised as one of the most earned, perhaps the most learned and clear headed of our Judges Yet even ball i ists s were unaware of the depth of his knowledge and bril hancy of intellect until he went upon the bench When, however, he succeeded Lord Romilly in uncomf or table, dingy court in Chancery-lane and when, later, he became president of the Court of Appeal, the fact forced itself upon bench and bar alike A unions proof of his popularity for dispatch amongst solicitors was the immense increase of business in his court after he had got there a few months. He was not quite 60 years of age He was the first Jew, as Mr Justice Shea was the first Catholic, who sat upon the English bench Barristers did not care much about appealing before Sir George Jessel, for he had a somewhat brusque way of putting them down, and dealing with long w inded speeches Anything in the shape of gush he abhorred But he battled through his cases at grand speed seldom bothered with written judgments, and was generally upheld in his decisions I remember once sitting through a patent case that lasted five days The complication of fairs and the labyrinths of legal points made every body's head ache, I believe e The last in argument was finished about 2 o'clock on the fifth day, and we w 2 of busily packing up our papers, expecting of course that the court would take at least as cook to prepare judgment Sir George Jessel, how- over at once, with scarcely a shoot of notes to aid him, commenced his decision, and in the course of two hours made the case clear to the meanest comprehension It was a masterly reduction of order out of chaos Yet he was not a success as a member of Parliament, nor as Solicitor-General, He was not absurd as a politician, however, as Sir John Holker was But he was heavy and fearfully legal in his House of Commons' speeches Sir George was one of those well educated men (he took high mathematical honours at London University) who could never circumvent the letter "If He sometimes omitted the letter altogether in speaking, saying 'ouse for house, or else he tspn acted so forcibly that you fancied another effort would have heaved his heart out. On the day of his death all the Judges spoke of him in terms of extraordinary eulogy Mr Justice Chitty, for instance, referred to him as one of the most illustrious Judges that over sat on the English bench The return of the Hon Allan Egerton for Mid Cheshire does not alter the portion of parties in the House The seat was stoutly ought, however, by a Liberal, but it has been long a stronghold of the Egerton of Triton family The Liberal local papers took their fun out of Mr. Egerton, as the 01 shoremen did last year out of Mr Dawn ly-simply punted his speeches real balm Nothing more was necessary to show up the intellectual in competence of the candidate But he got the votes The farmers knew that he was then landlord's son, that he was a Tr no Blue, and would vote straight. Perhaps all they cared to know was that he was the new lord's nominee Anyhow, they ran him in Mr Will ham Egerton, who has succeeded to the peerage was a very good member of Parliament, and one of the type of Conservatives for whom Lord Beaconsfield had an immense respect All the Excitons are model landlords We have probably-at least for some time heard the last of the Messrs Chamberlain and their grievance against the Reform Club The case came before the Judges on appeal and the Judges have put a dead stopper on the case Mr Justice Field had over sued the demurrer of the defendant, Mr Lennox Boyd, and he now appealed against Justice Field's judgment, The defendant had stated in the Reform Club that the conduct of the brothers Chamberlain was so bad at a club in Melbourne that a round robin was signed urging the committee to expel them " Adelaide was afterwards sub stituted for Melbourne. The blackballing of Mr. Chamberlain's brothers created much feeling in the Reform Club, and everybody was anxious to hear the libel case out Amusement was anticipated, and perhaps spicy revelations In the Appeal Court the other day we had none of the facts as to the plaintiff s "con duct," but the Judges unanimously upheld Mr Justice Field's judgment, and so put in end to the long talked of action " Chamberlain v Boyd " The Oxford and Cambridge boat race at tracted fewer spectators than has been the case for many years It is true the east wind was on its most villainous behaviour and the snow was cruel But on the other hand the ice was rowedmtheaftei noon, andnotatcail} morn in" as heretofore The public, nevertheless, did not take the trouble to go out and see it there were plenty of betting men and book makers about, but the family parties and respectable people in can ladies and boats that used to make up so fine a sight was not to be seen The fact must at last be faced that this boat race is taking its place upon the shady side of sport, and the unexpected change in the betting a few days before the race, coupled with the unexpected result, has revived in many quarters the advice to row the race on one of the Welsh lakes, or at Henley Of course there is not an atom of suspicion to be permitted with regard to either of the crew a but some very unpleasant things have been said by the irate losers of money The race was a good one apart from betting This decrease of interest is but the natural consequence of former extravagance in the opposite direction. The prominence given to the movements of these young men for a fortnight before the ice in the Press, and the muscular austerity craze which was at its zenith about twelve years ago, have slowly disgusted people, and the crews have ceased to be hot oes Poor Ashton Dilke will live pleasantly in the memories of all wickets him 'there issuing thing very touching in the young man of three and thirty years of age going with his wife and family to Algiers, conscious that he was there to die, and very pathetic was one of his latest letters of which, in a grand spurt of resignation he said that the length of a man s life. was not to be measured by years, and that he had been very happy in such a space as was vouchsafed to him But young Dilke MP is strong as a philosopher and the time all too swiftly came when his philosophy was to be put to the by no test of the dark v they It is not possible to foictcllvvhat he might have become, because it an age when most men are showing what they are usually made of the seeds of consumption were beginning to bear fruit He was in cxci Hont linguist, and known in most foreign cities Some years ago on visiting Russia, I took a number of letters of introduction Two were from Ashton Dilke to Russian politicians, and I well remember that if those letters had been written by the Czar himself they would not have brought me more attention and respect The Easter recess marks the first stage of the session Mr. Gladstone has declined the invitation of Mr Parnell to reopen the subject of the Land Act, and the House of Commons has reported Mr. Parnell's Land Law Bill by 210 to sixty three votes Mr Forster has advocated a policy in the Transvaal which would mean another South African war, and thcPiimo Minister has had the novel oppor trinity of twisting a Quaker with a desire to plunge the country into war The conduct of the Boers towards the native races is of course, a handle which the fingers do not of iii to use, and the general opinion is that mischief in South Africa must be appeal before long However, at present Mr Gladstone's attitude is a fine one of resistance to the city for inter- vention Mr Chamberlain has earned the second reading of the Bankruptcy Bill If the Bill becomes law, there will be a new Gov- eminent functionary called the "official re receiver,' who will examine closely into the air was of every bankrupt, and conduct the in quay before the court Mr Gorst has been defying Sir Stafford Northcote as leader of the Opposition, and introducing a motion against his will. The leaders of the Opposition accordingly have gone against him It is asserted that a number of the Consols vat five members have banded themselves together to meet the Government business after Easter by steady and orderly obstruction, with the object of preventing legislation. In this way it is hoped to damage the Government in the estimation of the country The plan has leaked out however, and it is further stated that Sir Stafford Northcote, Mr. W. H. Smith, and Sir R. Cross have strongly pro- nounced against the proposal of the Opposition colts Of course if a score of members resolve to obstruct they can do so without bringing themselves under the new procedure rules, and an additional temptation is the hope of showing that the closure may be successfully set at nought Mr Bright is at Glasgow, where yestcrday he was installed as Lord Rector At the same time Mr Henry Dunckley, writer of a series of political papers by "Verax," was made an LL D It is a splendid day for the holiday, as many unregenerate people will, spite of church teaching, consider Good Friday. The cast wind cuts like a razor, but the sun is bright About 15,000 Volunteers are on the march to day towards Brighton, where the Easter Monday review is to be held. Mr, Browning has published another volume of poems, and calls them " Jocoseria " It is Browning all over-part good, part indifferent, heart mistic affectation and bombastic shara We (Port Douglas Times) are informed that by the steamer Victoria, Mr Young, Railway Surveyor, arrived at Cairns, and is going to start with his preliminary surveys of the different routes. He will first commence with the Cairns one. Tin pi aspects of the sugar planters on the Don are at present bright and encouraging (says the Port Denison Times), for the cane looks beautiful and has in its growth exceeded the most sanguine expectations entertained of it Mr Martin has twelve acres of cane, which is, not even excepting that of Messrs Hildebrand, the finest yet grown on the river Mr. Martin intends to plant thirty more acres when the proper time for doing so annes Mr Gustavson's cane is also in fine condition, he has only five acres under cultivation, but will soon add to this thirty seven mechanics all planted with sugar cane Mr Robert Gusk) has ten acres planted, the cane is in first-class order and bears every promise of tin came out well like his neighbours'. Mr Ousley is now busily engaged in preparing more ground (for) two acres) for the reception of sugar cane. The Messrs Hildebrand expect to have then mill here by the next boat from the South, and Mr Fred Hildebrand informs us that, bar accidents, he will be able to com- mence crushing the latter end of July We should also mention that Mr. A H Nicol has a few acres of cane on his selection higher up the liver This, we are informed, is thriving very well indeed. and Mr Nicol is at present engaged in clearing and preparing more of his land with the intention of planting it with cane,
