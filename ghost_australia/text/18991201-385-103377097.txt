CHILD WITNESSES.. His Honor Mr. Justice Hood pointed out recently at the criminal sittings of the Supreme Court the very unsatis factory state of the law as regarded child witnesses. He said what everyone who attends either the police courts or higher tribunals knows to be true that tile usual way of ascertaining whether a child's evidence is likely to be worthy of credence on oath, is tonsk it "where it will go to" if it tells lies. The youngster that blurts out in full, good old Anglo-Saxon, "hell," is at once re garded as a regular George Washington for veracity and his evidence taken without Ieositatioun, and- the jury are entitled to accept it without corrobora tion. On the other hand, the child who has not been taught to rattle off, parrot like, his belief in a future state of physical torment for those who tell untruths, and who confesses his ignorance of "the lake that burneth with fire and brimstone" is not regarded as competent to be sworn, and is told he can "make a statement," which, however, will have to be corroborated by some sworn evi dence from another quarter. Judge Hood's contention seems to be' that the mere affirmation of a belief in hell -a belief which is dying daily, even among the churches-is no guarantee that a child is trnthful; nor is his failure to gabble off his dread of a fiery judgment to come any just ground for refusing to swear him. The fear" of punishment beyond the grave has as little of a deterrent influence on modern children as the fear of ghosts and bo gies, and it would be far better for parents and guardians, 'when their chil dren are to be summoned as witnesses in the courts, to impress on them the fact that there is such a crime as per jury and such a place as prison, rather than stuff them with medieval theology, which,in nine cases out of ten, the parents or guardians do not believe in themselves. As regards the courts, it would be highly desirable that the bench, officers and counsel should cease questioning-often with an ill concealed sceptical smile on their own faces- joven iles: ars--to- their post mortem destination should they tell lies in- the box, and simply inter rogate them with a view of ascertain ing their standard of intelligence, and whether they are alive to the fact that punishment awaits the false witness on conviction.
