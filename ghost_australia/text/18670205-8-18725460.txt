EMU CREEK DIGGINGS. (From the Herald's Special üeporter.) Emu Creek, 2Gth January. 1 ree selection and gold mining have at last been brought into antagonism The case is 6lmply this -The Got ernment did not proclaim the I mu Creek to be a gold field before the beginning ol the present 5 ear l'rior to the proclamation Mr William Redman an attorney ol the Supreme Court aud formerly a member of the I egislatUo Assembly free selected a hundred acres of land within the boundaries ol the gold field The spot he pitched upon was one known to be auriferous for two of the reefs on it had been opened and worked and several holes had been sunk on the alluvial land which formed a por tion of what is known as the One mile Kuall and liad bottomed on gold Resides this other reefs have since been traced on the land Mr Redman having made his conditional purchase paid his deposit and I presume got his permission to occupy carne down and told the diggers what he had done laid claim to the reefs and alluvial sinking and Informed the miners that the land was now bia and that he intended to treat them as tenants and demanded a share of the gold raised by them Of course this caused a ferment throughout the whole diggings for Mr li edman had opened upa subject that not only interested the fifty or sixty men whoBe claims were on the selected land but in its future application was of the highest importance to the mining community To allay this Mr Redman called a public meeting of miners for the purpose of discussing Hie whole question His speech had really very little to do with the sub Jeot tliey had met to discuss Ile did however quote the 13th section of tue I anda Alienation Act aud argue in favour of ills right to select land which at the time of selection was not in a proclaimed gold field though it might be in a ric facto and dis oovered gold field I took no notice of all th» because I had reason to believe that Mr Redman waa not really honest iu the purpose that he ?ut forward I was deceive I however thus far that whereas thought it was all a piece of bounce on his part and that he had taken this course only to odd to the notoriety he has already obtained I find that lie really intends to stick to hi« selection and to bring to bear all the engines of law in order to attain his end Mr Redman has had his hundred acres surveyed enclosing in the area a number of claims on the One mile Ru«h two quart? reefs already worked and several others not yet opened He has shut in many resident allotments occupied by miners under the Gold fields Regulation has commenced building his house in close proximity to a rich reef lias set fire to some of the rough outbuildings erected by the miners and has given them notice of his intention to make them pay for the use of his land Luckily he has to do with au orderly lot of men who instead of taking the law into their own limul« have np pealed to the resident magistrate and a summons under the Gold fields Act has been issued against Mr Redman for the trespass be has committed upon the occupation lot of one of the miners lhis case will be heard at the police oflice to morro» and 1 shall watch it with some interest as the question in volved is one of considerable importance to the mining Interest At the same time I moy say that even if the law were as much with Mr Redman as I believe it to be against him I can not for an instant fancy that the Minister for Landa will approve of the conditional 1 urdíase and thi» I honestly fancy is Mr Kedmaa. s own idea Were it to be allowed we should have persons as unscrupulous as this gentleman coming in the moment a gold field «as discovered and before it could be proclaimed nnd selecting all that w as likely to prove the most highly auriferous I wo of the four men forming the band of incipent bush rangers mentioned in one of my former letters have been apprehended by the Cootomunbry police with sufficient stoleu property on them to ensure their conviction for highway rob bery One of them proves to be a man named Johnson who was committed for trial here for au attempt to stab but who escaped off the chain L erj thing continuesverj quiethcre I\ocrime nobusines" \ery little work doing and not much gold washing going on The huts &c; are beginning to tluu out very considerably au I long gaps occur where receutly there were continuous rows of residences huts &c; The weather has been fearfully hot with not the slightest indication that would give even the ghost of a hope that so much 11s a thunder shower was impending The rmpire s correspondent writes on the -Dib. ultimo - The pro pects of the gold field remain the Bame as ever 1 very thing is at a standstill lor the want of water 1 he old lead is still being traced down the Hat but the ground is only poor just such as will (¡Ive fair wages Many men aro washing at Daley s dam sl\ miles awa> at a cost oi 1 « Od per load and some of the claims at the One mile are turning out very good whileothersnretcrypoor Another reel lins been foun 1 prOBi ects very good and I heir on r,ood authority that a crushing machine is on the road to tills llel i Great numbeis of men have left but all almost to 11 mnn that I have spoken with intend to return when water comes L\cr>bo ly com plains of the fall off in business but then most strange to those not thoroughly up in new rushes eierybody piietly bides hi» time and predicts that this will yet be u large and productive gold field I own I also incline to that opinion Nothing authentio as to the alleged discovery of gold at Dacey s station Weather boro intensely not and no sign of rain
