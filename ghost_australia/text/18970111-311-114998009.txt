Exorcism of Ghosts. A recent issue of the "Australian Medical Gazette"' contains a brief but instructive report of the cure of a case of hallucinatory disorder. The patient, a man aged sixty years, had suffered for two years from sub- jective visual sensations. Not a day passed that he did not see a large number of spectral human figures, and believing himself to be haunted by ghosts he had become very despondent and melancholy. On seeking medical advice it was found that he had senile cataract. When this was removed by opera- tion the ghosts fled and the man recovered his usual health. In this connection we may cite the case of a tradesman in Berlin whose shop was haunted by apparitions resembling in appearance some of his deceased customers. He was an intelligent man, aware that he suffered from sensory hallucination, and made of his subjective impressions. In due time he submitted his eyes to examina- tion and operation, with the result of a re- storation of normal vision and the immediate and final disappearance of his intangible visitors. The obvious teaching of the fore- going and similar cases is that in these modern days the person to be reported to for the exorcism of spirits and demons is the ophthalmic surgeon. It may be suggested to those " spiritualists" who are open to convic- tion that curable aberrations of vision, plus unconscious cerebration, would account for a large proportion of the apparitions described in the periodicals devoted to the spread of spiritualism. We believe that certain phenol- mena which cannot be explained in this manner are generally due to imposture. Without doubt a large number of spiritual- lists honestly believe in the truth of what we cannot but regard as a monstrous delusion, but it is not easy to restrain a suspicion that others, and particularly "mediums," like the Haruspices of the Rome of Lucian's day, find it difficult to meet without exchanging a wink and a smile.
