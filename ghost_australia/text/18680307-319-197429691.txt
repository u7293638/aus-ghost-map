No w-a-days these things are all written in novels,! and X should think the blbOmpf a girl's deli cacy must be long gone before she hears such words said tO herself . Then it was different., I had never dreamed pf anything so beautiful. But before this adark time was to come. . ? We must have been a good while going home, for when/we'.'oameinsightof-t'i.e/house' there; ?was my mother standing in the door, shading; her eyes ? with her hand, and ' watching i f or us, j aud all ?'.. at onoe I rembriibered ;; '-tlia't; she : must- 'have1 been anxious; there' were, ?bears in-those woods, and the next .winter brie : was killed in the very path where we walked.. When mother saw us coming, she smiled, 'and! came down to the road to meet us, .and shook; : hands with Ephrahri insuch a friendly way; that my heart dantied; Xhad .been A^thinkirig what if father and. mother should not approve j of him,.

Ephrnim hail '? a much'greater,flbw of spirits than 'I had; ,Ii was'grave beyorid my. years. But I caught i the love of fun from hica, arid mother arid father wondered at the change in me.

And so, autumn came, and winter, and, with j the winter the frolios whiph Ephraim was s'o ; fond of , and which ho pbrsistdd stoutly were -. as innocent B9 ohurch-going.

So at 'first Epbraim stayed contentedly with 'ine, but' by-and-by the old ' Jove stiwed.

And so there gradually, grew up a coldness between us.; aud: yet the coldness was all on my side. Ephmim; rwaa'.'ai ways gentle, even when Iwas pettish' arid ; cross. For so I was. It was partly: piiy's'ica'l. 'I/was riot' well that; winter.. I did not'sleep,;or when I did, by fits . and starts, I; woke frightened and crying.

A ^vny, brazen belt' Of light lying along tho' west,1 whero the sun hai gbrie down, illuminated the enow, nnd gave a woird; character to the whole scenb. , There was a high wind swajiug the tops.of th'a tall trees before thb house; arid once in a while you would' see a fragment - of clou3 ' caught from the great grey curtain and- torn; into shreds, or ravelled into & thin web, which seemed for a moment to ? settle' close down upon us. It was a strange ; night, a strange sky. I felt a vague alarm. Bnt I tried to speak cheerfully. ,' It is too cold to snow,'mother!' . ,.'.:' She pointed to the window. Even as I spoke the air was suddenly darkened by a multitude of fine flakes, that crowded faster and faster, and were swirled about by the wind, and quickly built up a wall around the door. As it grew dark the storm increased. ? The wind, ' which had been blowing steadily all day, rose ; to a gale. It tugged at the doors and win- ! ? flows; it thundered down the chimney; it: -/»on/rlif flio liffln Tinnao ' nnrt «ih/\n1r lfc till flift' timbers, creaked ; the noise was truly ' awful. i We got the boys intothe trundle-bed as soon; :as we could, and then mother brought out her' wheel, and! took my knitting.

But as she turned around toward mo with her hand, she looked so strange that I cried out .'to know what was the matter. 'Itis.no- ; thing,' she whispered ; but I took hold of her, .and steadied her down into the arm-chair, and then ran for thecamphor. That brought her round ; but now she looked feverish, and was , 'shaking all over, and I knew that she was ; geing to have one of her ill turns — possibly ? -lung fever— for her lungs were but weak, and; vshe rarely got over the winter without a fever. : The thought made me half wild, but I dared \- shot wait te cry or fret. I knew there was. no (time to be lost, and I hurried around, .and gave her a warm foot-bath, and ; kept hot flannels on her chest, and made her .drink a 'Dice bowl of herb tea as soon: i as. she was in bed ; for I thought when the per ,' spiration started she would be relieved.

That was the worst side; lof the trouble. It, was a settled fever by this , time, I was sure. We both knew it, we both '/knew that no help was to bo had, and that she .might die for want of it. We were both silent,* ; neither daring to speak, not knowing how to ??'.,. encourage and strengthen the other. Mother ]grew worse all day, in spite of all that I could do for her. The. darkness in the house was ; , most depressing, and: made the situation, ten-! ? fold more painful ; though I kept a fire and a light burning as at evening, I had to be economical of both, for there was enly a small / stock of fuel and a handful of. pine knots in , the house.. It was painful to hear the poor , cows at the, barn Ip wing for food, and to know. Vthat it was impossible to reach them. I ''might, perhaps, have gone out on snow-shoe3 ? and managed to get into the barn,, by ? the window in the loft; but father's shoes /were ,,. loaned to a neighbor, ..and, even if they had been at. band, I should , hardly dare to risk my strength, not yet reno-, vated after my sickness, and, which was so . essential to mother's safety, in an effort that might fail. So the hours went on, and the day that was like night wore to a close. In. the- evening ? .moiner Brigmjeneu up u liiiuo. cmo naa »imu now, and for the time free from pain. There . was an unearthly beauty in the large, bright hollow eyes, and the thin cheeks, where the; rose of fever burned. The disease had worked .'swiftly. Even this revival might be only , a 'forerunner of death. ' I want to. tell you, dear,' she said, 'what to do in case I sheuld ' not get well.' I bid my face in the quilt, and; tried not to sob, while she went on, in a sweety .'calm, thoughtful way, to. tell me, of! ,4he -things that, in my inexporienoe ;I j might forget. I must not be wasteful 'of food or fuel ; if the snow — whiph , was still; falling-— should cover the chimney so that I; 'conld not make a fire, I must wrap myself and. . the children in all the warm things I cpuld.iind; , —?there were some_new blankets in the chest,' in the chamber, she said, that uhe had meant; ' for me. ' I must get those if I needed them. '*? And if I am not here to encourage you, ; my! .child,' she said; .tenderly, 'don't give up! hoping. Help cannot be very far off. , Some! ' of the neighbors will, cojne to us, or father will '. work his way through the sno-7. and get homo. And, Mercy, dbn!t be afraid of the poor body that I shall leave behind me. \ Think Cf .it ? «s the empty, house that I have used for a h'iJJ8 while, and be sure it can do you no harm.' .' ,! I promised all she asked, and hid my tears as well as I could. While ehe slept, and I could do nothing for her, I kept the children , qaiet with playthings and stones. I cooked bread and meat, and made a great kettle of pomdgo sgaiast tlio time whou wo might noji be able to have a fire ; I hunted in the garrets for old boards and broken furniture that might serve for fueL For two days the wind held, and then there fell an awful silence as of the grave. Sometimes I read from the Psalms, or from the* Gospel of John, which mother dearly loved ; and though she did not take much notice, but lay in a stupor most cf the time, tho holy words were comfort and company to. me. At other times I sat in mute grief watching her painful breathing, and the gradual pinching and sharpening of her features 'as the relent less disease worked upon them. O, it was hard ! I don't think many lives know so much and such utter misery. In my anxiety and grief , and the mental bewilderment resulting from loss of sleep, I forgot to reckon the days as they, passed. But one day, as I sat by my mother's pillow, my ;inind full of the ! , dread that seemed now as if it might any moment be realised— of..', the awfuhiess of being, left Jalone in that living tomb . with the marble image of what was and, yet was not my. mother, the clock struck nine in the morning. Somewhere the sun was shining, I thought. Somewhere there were happy lovers, merry makings in divers places, wedding-bells ringing. .',,,'A faint sound disturbed my revery. I started up and lstened intently; but the noise did' not recur, and I dropped my head again, thinking my fancy had cheated me. I don't know why .it was. that what failed. to reach my strained ear found its way to . mother's ; but all at once, from having, been in a stnpid state from which I could hardly rouse her, she opened her eyes, and said, 'What isi that?' V Do you hear anything?' I asked, trembling. But before she could answer,I too heard a shout. -; . , , 'Help was at hand 1 And mother might yet be saved ! I burst into tears, and Jem and David set , up a loud -sry for company. Those ' outside heard it, for the next instant there was . a great' halloo. They, were cutting their way through the drift— they came every minute nearer, and nearer. Pretty soon I heard a voice that set my heart beating and made me sob again. It was Ephraim's. ' Are you all alive ?' he cried. ' We are all alive, but .mother, is very sick.' I don't know how , long it teok to tunnel that hugh snow drift.

Yet he had come as fast as the roads would let him, travelling night and day in his eagerness to reach us. He told us of houses' , snowed up, and people and animals perishing; miserably.
