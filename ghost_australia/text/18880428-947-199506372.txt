'THEY SAY' 'Tou have too m-uch respect upon the world. They lo;e it that do buy it with much care,' They say. Let them say. What Jdoes it matter after all?

Ergo, would there be any question about the matter? Mrs. Shoddy goes. And again, Mrs. Shoddy doesn't at. all object to be very gracious to the good old' ?nurse, ' who f has nursed her; together with a 'flock of equally troublesome'^ brothers and sisters, through their infantile ^ ail ments : Mrs. Shoddy even condescends to shake hands with her when nobody is looking; but before ' our Bet ?'. — Oh, no, it would never do. ' They ' might think, you know, that she was intimate' with such people! ; And yet again, Mr. and Mr3. So-and-So, who have as many thousands as Mr. and Mrs. Shoddy have hundreds, give a grand party, and: a most expensive party— as they can well afford to do. The Sheddys, who strive to move in the same set, are not tb.be, put-done. They give one, too — equally expensive. But the confectioner's bill,, the; cream bill, the dress-maker's bill, arid a multitude of other bills, remain unpaid, and go on increasing in the most unsatisfactory manner to the tradesmen. Then' finally the said* tradesmen, waxing wroth ; and inipatierit, send in their bills altogether,1 and the Shoddys, unatfle to meet :this united and peremptory demand on their pur'sei wind rip where mariy a Shoddyite'has wound up before — namely, iri the Court of Bankruptcy.
