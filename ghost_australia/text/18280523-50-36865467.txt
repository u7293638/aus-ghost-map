CORONER'S INQUEST. Dr. Halloran was called upon to exercise his functions of Coroner for Sydney and the County, for the first time since his appointment to that post, on Wednesday. In the after- noon of that day a jury of householders was called together in a public-house, not far from King's Wharf, in an apartment of which there lay the body of a New Zealand- man named Mytie, one of the crew of the ship John Bull. The deceased lad, it appeared, no sooner got ashore from the John Bull on the day previously, than he made for a public-house near the wharf, where he was plied with strong drink to such an excess - nineteen half pints, they say, in one hour, that he dropped down and gave up the ghost. The verdict was, died from suffocation, whilst in a state of extreme intoxication.
