It is devoutly to= be hoped that our civic rulers will pay some more attention to the general good of the town;- and-oease making streets to nowhere —cease wasting our money on gardens of mo earthly use to over three-fourths of the ratepayers, and-, "instead, devote our money to the purpose here indicated, which would be available and largely taken advantage of by our youth's, from every corner of our, largearea. If something of this sort be not. done, these lamentable drowning accidents will go on increasing year by year, as the. population increases.—Yours, etc., Moonee Ponds, 10th July, 93. A FATHER.
