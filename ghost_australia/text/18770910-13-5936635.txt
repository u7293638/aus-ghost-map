CLAIMS OF THE PASTORAL AID SOCIETY. An appeal was made yesterday by the Bishop of Melbourne at Holy Trinity Church, Kew, on behalf of the Church of England and Presbyterian Pastoral Aid Society. The Bishop delivered a discourse which was founded on the words "It islander for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God," II no nell man could obtain admittance into the kingdom of Heaven, then those who were pursuing worldly SUCCesS were really striving with all their might to accumulate hindrances to their salvation, In every congregation, and particularly the congrega- tion of a suburban church like this, they would find a large number of persons-pro bably the majority- who were seeking by all honest means to attain as much wealth as they could get. As far as we knew, they were countenanced in this endeavour by the ministers of the gospel We all thought they were doing right, and as far as we could see their efforts did not end badly For if we wanted orderly citizens, good husbands and fathers, yea, pious Christian men, frequenting the house of God and establishing the altar of prayer in the family, where should we find them amongst the less or amongst the more prosperous members of the church '' He was afraid that that stated the case of the rich rather too favourably, but no one could shut his eyes to the solid basis of fact on which the explanation was founded, that there were many amongst the rich who were ornaments of the faith, and that there were many amongst the poor who owed their poverty to their idleness their improvidence and their vice What then, did we make of the words of the text ? How did it come to pass that in spite of the Lord s declaration that it was so difficult for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God, we all strove to be rich, and apparently not with unhappy re Bible'' He believed that a great deal of people's inability to understand his text arose from ignorance of the circumstances of our Lord s time, and from carelessness about His usage of language Now, for instance what was the meaning hero of the words ' kingdom of God ' Many people took it at once to mean heaven. It was absolutely certain that from our Lords lips it meant nothing of the kind. What was meant was this-not that no rich men would get to heaven, or that all rich men would find it difficult to get to heaven, but that the rich men of His own day would find it extremely difficult to enter the church or the spiritual kingdom He was come to found upon earth If any one would take the trouble to begin at the third chapter of Matthew, and carefully and thoughtfully read through the account which the apostle gave of our MoBter s ministry, he would see that Christ meant by the words kingdom of God" that which all his parabolic teaching meant the spiritual kingdom He was to set upon earth, in which the good would be found with the bad, the wheat with the tares He could not have meant heaven the place of felicity into which nothing evil could come, but a kingdom in which good and bad were mingled together in the third chapter of Matthew John the Baptist declared that the kingdom of heaven was at hand, and he called on the people to change their hearts J because of that fact. If we asked what the nature of that kingdom was, should find it described in the early verses of the Sermon on the Mount It should consist of the meek, the mournful, the merciful, the pure in heart and they that hungered and thirsted after righteousness If we asked what was the condition upon which a man could enter into that kingdom we should hear the Saviour reply- ' Except yonrrighteoueneBB shall exceed thoughtless ness of the Scribes and Pharisees you cannot enter into the Kingdom of Heaven." In what respect must it exceed the righteous ness of the scribes and Pharisees'' It must be of a more inward and more spiritual character, so that if we would avoid murder we must avoid hate, and if we would avoid adultery we must avoid last that if we wished to give alms after a fashion pleasing to God, we must not let the right hand know what the left did. Above all we must avoid caring for the things of this world more than the things of God Like the flowers of the field we must be clad, and like the birds of the air we must be fed , but then, said the Redeemer, "Trust Him that feareth the ravens and clothes the lily of the field for all things that belong to the body, and seek first not wealth pleasure or honour, or anything the world can give, but the kingdom of God and His righteousness ' But perhaps he would be met by this objection Surely, if it was difficult or if it was impossible for rich men in our Lord B time to enter into the earthly and visible kingdom, it must have been equally difficult for them to pass into the ia visible kingdom at a subsequent period, for the one was the vestibule of the other Now we must take heed not to be foolish and presumptuous in arguing from the present to the future Though the number of those who found their way into our Lord a kingdom in His lifetime was so few that not more than 120 disciples assembled on the Day of Pentecost to wait for the coming of the Holy Ghost yet on that one day 1 000 were added to the church The future was in the hand of God What we had to do was to seek out the principle which lay at the basis of the Saviours statement, and apply it as well as we could to the circumstances of our own day The principle was plain. There were hindrances in our Saviour's time which made it excessively, difficult for the rich people within the boundaries of Israel to pass into God's spiritual kingdom, and it was not difficult to point out what they were First of all, our Lord loved poverty and obscurity there were things which the rich man did not like, or if the rich man found it possible to accept a poor and humble master, he could receive the statement that the greatest in His kingdom must be the lowliest. When the Jews asked who would be the greatest in the kingdom of God they did not like to be told "a little child They could not receive the statement that unless they cared more for the latter's love than the Father a gifts, they could notenterintotbekingdomofGod That was the difficulty and the Jews oil felt it The Jews expected the Messiah to set up a kingdom in which all the riches honours and glories of the Gentiles would abound But the kingdom of God was not meat and drink, nor the love of honour and pleasure nor onytbingoutword, but somethingspintnol and inward-a state of righteousness and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost. That was what the Saviour taught-that was what He told the young man who came and asked what good thing he should do to inherit eternal life The same answer he (the bishop) believed would be given to any one who came now and asked by what supernatural exertion of goodness he should deserve happiness Happiness was the second thing goodness was the first. It was not necessary that a man should be happy, it was sometimes necessary he should be sorrowful, but it was necessary, and the one thing need ful, that by the grace of God he should enter upon the following of that mind of Jesus which would lead him to what was supremely sweet and graceful and noble-the imitation of God Goodness was the end, happiness but the means. We put gold as the end, and He told us to sell what we had, and give to the poor. We had to get rid of an illusion, and in order to show is now little gold Bigm bed, we were told to put it away, and aim at what was worthy of endeavour-likeness unto God. We were not told that we ought not to have wealth, nor that we ought not to seek it, but that we ought not to make it the great end of life. If a man would put the righteousness of God first, and the means of forwarding it in the second place, then the impossible would be achieved, and the camel would go through the eye of the needle. Now he durst not Boy to the members of this congregation, ' Sell all that thou hast and give to the poor because he did not know to what extent it was a question between gold and Christ with them. But he had a right to say to them, that if the kingdom of God and His righteousness held the first place in their hearts, and gold the second, then if the kingdom of God needed to be furthered by efforts requiring the sacrifice of gold, they ought to be ready to make it. He could lay before them a clear case to test their prin- ciples. There were large areas of this country inhabited by fellow countrymen and fellow Christians whose spiritual needs were imperfectly supplied by ministerial services There were too many churches and too few ministers. The object was to multiply the services of the minister. A society had been established to promote the greater use of the churches. The Church of England and the Presbyterians had agreed that their buildings should be exchanged Neither denomination was responsible for the details of the other's teaching, bat was satisfied that substantially that teaching was good. To further the kingdom of God and His righteousness it was necessary that the people should give Borne solid proportion of their means to further the work of the Pastoral Aid Society If they cared more for the redeeming work of Christ than for anything else under the sun and they were not Christians if they did not then they would prove-not to him, or to their neighbours, but to their own consciences, for their own satisfaction and self assurance that they were not self deceiving hypocrites, by supporting a movement the sole object of which was the glory of God and the salvation of man.
