" FUGITIVE NOTES. Last week, in my blundering way, I tried to describe the effect of the first premature strains of jammer, but since then I have been placed in possession of the real reason of these unreasonable visiting And it is one which I venture to say Mr Russell, with all his scientific instruments, has passed a patent [factor in natural science which the savants who delight in puzzling over curios of nature have all missed The summery weather has been simply forced upon us by a power behind the throne that few are ever aware of in this connection And the power is simply the retail drapers jw have been selling; off lately, and with a sudden discharge of light prints, white grosses, straw hats, and so on, have set a large part of the fair population vigorously making bargains Under such circumstances what can poor Nature do ? It is all very well for her to affect to think it winter or autumn, but when every second woman walks abroad arrayed in something wonderful in brown holland or is preparing to sport the most vapoury of light blouses, what can I the golD of the almanac do P 'In point of fact, as we have seen, they are helpless, and between them the drapers and the ladies have Forced the slow hand of hesitating Time and by sheer weight of numbers thrown Winter behind Which recalls Calverloy's remark Wonderful as Nature, but how much more wonderful is Art? a . Possibly the greatest legal genius who ever coined a punishment to fit the crime " was he who invented " insulting behaviour " Looking through Australian police records, the antiquarian of the future will not fail to be struck by the constant repetition of this ominous phrase I'm our crime annals, and he will probably write I largo books dealing learnedly (and altogether in- accurately) with the subject These remarks occur to me through the misfortunes of a gentleman in Victoria, the other day. He was discovered standing in a creek of the cold water, and though several passers-by advised him to come out and change his things, he resolutely declined He explained that he had an active come inside him, and that this was his only chance of putting out the blazing visitor Then the local constable came upon the scene, and lent his voice to the general supplications but it was no use, and at last the policeman bethought him of his law, and ran over several sections of the Crimes Act under his helmet He was on the verge of giving it up when a flash of inspiration throw the whole position into vivid relief " Insulting behaviour," he murmured doubtfully " insulting behaviour, he repeated in tones of deeper conviction, insulting behaviour," he roared in tones of command to the gentleman with the comet As Hans Brcit mann says, "Dot fetched him," and out he came, and mildly consented to be run in Whether he will be charged with being in possession of a portion of the firmament well knowing it to have been stolen, or whether he will be merely dealt with for having obstructed a public thoroughfare, remains to be seen But we may safely trust to insulting behaviour " to vindicate the law . a * . . I have observed with pleasure how vigorously one of our native industries has progressed of late for want of a better term it may be described as " Standing about the streets " When Miss Shaw was here for the London Times she described the customary attitude of Young Australia as " chiefly leaning against a post " This dozen fire epigram was almost as libellous is could reasonably be expected after a few minutes' survey in fact, few globe-trotters could have done much better But, paecTSisa Shaw, there really in a considerable class that appears to derive its whole comfort, sustenance, and recreation from lounging about particular streets It may be easily recognised, too. It is not a depressed poverty-stricken class, as might be supposed, but well clothed, well tied, with jewellery of Sudden patterns, with cigars, with both hands in its pockets How does it exist P No doubt a section of it is a sport- ing section-that can be realised by its intense gloom and illustrated language, and others there are who, the detectives tell you, know something of the midnight jemmy of the blithe burglar, and the watches and chains of those who go down to public places in crowds But even so, how comes it that a perpetual lounge in the public thoroughfares is sufficient for their welfare The fact of the matter appears to be that there are many people who appear to have mastered the problem of how to live on nothing a year and choose this method of illustrating their success If the example of Mr Gray, MP, of Victoria, spreads, it now horror threatens to be added to political life This gentleman has been vigorously inveighing against the private lives of some of his fellow members, about whose morals he has the most excruciating doubts Some of them, he asserts, are polygitnists in the suburbs, and, pertinently continues this sensitively virtuous legislator, " how can you expect bad men to make good laws " How, indeed, unless on the principle the father of a family who used to get regularly overcome for the only purpose of showing his children the ter able curse of drink And on second thoughts, too, a monster of wickedness in his private life may be a shining example of pub) to morality Walpole, Chatham, Fox, not to mention a host of other distinguished names, were more than suspected of being no- better than the lost b the suburbs, whilst they certainly rendered great and lasting services to the public In point of fact, what really scorns a glaring anomaly has to be endured Law-making is mostly a very abstract affair, whose intelligence and knowledge of the world count for much Hence the vile personal predilections of misdoers scarcely weigh at all, and the very incarnation of wrkcdDCSs is able to place sensible laws on the statute book if he has the requisite mental outfit On the other hand, the most blameless tradesman may be out of place in Parliament, notwithstanding that he is conscious of a moral character whiter than snow, and a hatred of vice stronger even than the love of publicity It is one of those awful cases where the wicked seem to flourish as the green bay tree, and the righteous can only look on and wring their hands ..... A telegram from Auckland gives us the information that the man who some months back made a voluntary confession of having murdered a young woman 18 years ago, now asserts that there is no truth in his statements Those interested in this strange case will remember with what minutes of time, place, and persons this confession was made And now, if we are to believe the man's present declaration, all this was but badinage flight Jos riotous imagination Apparently men of this vivid imagination are not care, for in Melbourne last week a case was brought to light over the suburban ghost boom that our neighbours have been enjoying A householder was roused in the early hours of the morning by burglarious sounds, and on entering the room whence the sounds came he went to the window and raised the blind, at the same time that a pistol-shot shattered the glass The startled paterfamilias, running out into the street, thought he saw the form of a man dressed in black running off in haste A skilled detective work the matter in hand and quickly unravelled the mystery The noise had been made by the wind rattling the venetians, no shot had been fired, for the hole in the glass was of a different character, The pieces of broken glass were on the outside in Head of the inside, and the break was almost certainly caused by the burglar hunter in his scared away forcing the end of the blind through the loss No one but himself had seen the supposed runaway, and in a word the whole affair was the fault of overwrought nerves and the talk of recent ghost appearances These cases of hallucination rosso us wonder how much of this thing goes on we sometimes think from the amount of conscience money that the Railway Department and the Postmaster-General receive that there are a sad number of delinquents of this character But did they over commit these little breaches of rectitude? . . . . . One could not ask for a finer example of homely heroism than that displayed by some of the imprisoned miners in the Eldorado disaster Shut in in their dark prisons, with the bubbling 'slum" cutting off every ray of light, and the hand of death imminent with every croak of the City timbers around them, it is hard to imagine a position more trying to the natives, was far greater fortitude of heart. yet the t peril was looked very steadily in the face, and one ; or two of the men bore themselves with splendid courage right up to the bright face of death. With rusty nails and on battered " billys " they scrawled at once their wills and epitaphs, and whatever memorials may be raised to their remains one may be sure that nothing more last year or eloquent than those dinted tin cans will be erected.
