There may, perhaps, bs a sentimental schoolboy or two wbo will hear with regrot tbat the housEB in Wyoh street, whioh are traditionally ssBoolsted with Jaok Sheppard, \- have been swept away by tbe modern spirit of improvement, to whioh ovon the homo of a highwayman Is not soared. The carpenter's shop, tamillnr to the readers of Mr Aius- worth's novel, In wbloh tbe hero was said to havo been apprenticed, and on a beam in which he carved hla immortal name, is gone, and with it the Old Lion Inn, where Jack sod his footpad friends were wont to hold high revel, and whero tbe walls olten echoed to the pleasing eonnds of Blueskln's voloe. Within its walls noeoho of Jolly Nose may linger now, no ahorne of Nix my Dolly Pair, will seem to borg abont ths plnoe ; for thers aro now no walls to afford an eoho, and, in deed, no plaoe In whioh the ghost of a song would oare to linger.
