ORIGINAL POETRY. NIGHTMARE 'XTRAORDINARY. (BY WILL CARTER.) Friends, it was night--a gloomy, shadowy night, The moon half spherical, seemed all at ease, And wont at intervals, to hide her head— Or face—or half face—which you will— Within a cloud—(for clouds there were, and ominous) As if in gazing on the distant earth she did behold Some grizzly horrors wrought, Which shocked her vision, till she sped the blue And plunged into oblivion's fleecy veil. A night it was for ghosts (if such there are) To flit about—for goblins to appear, Alone I was, and in my heart lurked fear, Of some impending danger. While without, Strange stilness reigned—for all the air lay dead, And every leaf hung mute, and motionless. An hour I tossed, ere fell I into sleep— Or into dreams, of death beds and despair; For never yet within my scanty span, Has night assumed such horrid phantasies, Such scenes I saw, my blood refused to course, Or, so it seemed, and all my limbs grew stiff And would not yield a movement, and mine eyes Close fixed upon each ghastly deed, Beheld new horrors rise— I saw aged sires hacked, and sons and wives, Tear limb from limb, as if in sportive glee, But worse than all—aye! worse a thousand times Was one grim demon with an evil eye, Who read aloud some Welsh appareled theme, I heard him rave of "Calcite crystals—ledges," Of "tints ferruginous and canopies." Of "ruby stained stalactites" and "The Grotto" Then "chaos" came--no wonder that I swooned? But soon, alas! I found my sense awakened By "Cleopatra's needle" in mine ear, —Still on he cursed—methought the air grew dreadful, Yet ceased he not to pour his venom forth "Stalagmites—pillars—uniform directions Dome, cloisters, columns, terraces and aisle; Calcareous substance, and translucent pencils And supersaturated carbonate of lime," And then I woke, and right beneath my pillow I found—Ye Gods! The Tumut Times concealed, And in two columns very fairly written, Appeared my "nightmare"—graphically revealed.
