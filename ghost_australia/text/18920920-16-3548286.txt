THE MARIONETTES. At the Gaiety Theatre last night the management presented another programme for the entertainment of their patrons, which proved very acceptable to all present. Considering the attractions elsewhere there was a good attendance, and judging by the applause which followed the various places the audience were well pleased with the efforts made to amuse them. The festooning, including the aquarium with its marine wonders, and the Court Minstrels were again the subject of much applause, the latter especially provoking great merriment. " Blue Board was replaced by the pantomime of " Beauty and the Beast" and the movements of the puppets were so natural and lifelike that they at times almost deserved the spectators. The beautiful scenery and the rapidity with which it was changed also came in for their share of admiration. During the course of this piece a parody on the popular Song " Ta-ra-ra-hoom- do-ny" was introduced, and was accorded a hearty round of applause. In the harlequinade division, the comicalities and absurdities of the clown Joe and his mate Cauliflower caused intense amusement. The ghost scene especially was very much enjoyed. The whole entertainment was much appreciated, and the audience called for encores in several instances, and in each case the request was responded to. The transformation scenes were as lovely as before, and the effects produced may safely challenge comparison with anything ordinarily soon on the stage. The performance will be repeated to-night, and to-morrow afternoon there will be a matinee as well as the usual evening entertainment.
