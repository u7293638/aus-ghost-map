At least as many selected words are to be used as one-half of the number of linos in the verses in which they are embodied. The selected wards were Xact, Xalt, Xample, Xcess, Xpose, and Xtremo. We publish the following this week Men in these dayB should be Xact ; Xam2>le set, mark well each fact. Be careful to avoid Xtreme. The men who England's Queen Xalt, Are few, indeed, withont a fault, For things are seldom what they seem. When men their want of sense disclose, Their foolish acts we should Xpose, Yet wisely so; avoid Xcess Like soldiers brave prepaied for fight, Do all we can for truth and right, And try to make our evils less. B. S. S. He an Xample set Whom at the Club I met. Xact and right Detei mined to Xpose Xcess In gormandising drink and dress, With all bis might.

"Dinner's ready." cried my wife.
