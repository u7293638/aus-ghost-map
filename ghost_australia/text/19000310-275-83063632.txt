SUMMONING THE DEAD, A strange custom, described by early Spanish and Portuguese explorers still lingers in the region of the head waters of the Amazon. It is the custom for certain sorcerers, who profess to foresee the future by the aid of ghosts, to invoke the ghosts by swallowing toxic herb de- coctions, which throw them into a state of temporary madness. In this condi- tion, the spirits of the departed come to guide them in their decisions by su- perhuman wisdom. Tribal feuds, suits at law, the treatment of disease, migra- tions, the treatment of crops, and other questions, are submitted to the spirits of departed sages, warriors, and medi- cine men. It is a weird scene. By night, in the gloom of the deepest forest, the rites begin, lighted by the fitful glare of open fires. The sorcerers drink the nauseous steepings of the poison plants, amid a silence broken only by the beat of the drum. The drugs take immedi- ate effect. Their eyes open wide and their pupils dilate. They utter unin- telligible cries which are taken to be words of deepest meaning, Finally, the sorcerers fall down in utter exhaus- tion to sleep off the effects of their medicine.
