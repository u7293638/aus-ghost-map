CHAPTER. II. The. time came swifty arouud. The weather was intensely cold as we drove to i King's Cross i n the early morning of the ! 20th of December. The streets were dumb with snow. The fall, however, did not extend far north of London, though threat ëniug to be soon general. When theday fully disclosed itself it was glorious ; a sun of splendid brilliance, though robbed of all warmth in the bitter polar air, a sky wi til magnificent niasses of cumuli, amber lined with silver edges, floating lazily through the vast space of profound blue ; while in the cast lay piled up with a grandeur indiscribable enormous mountable of snow cloud strong ] .and portentous^ a mighty Álphine range, with gorges in it tremendous and terrible, < catching the changes of the san as ? the Alps themselves, full of warm and rnddy tints in the early day, refulgent to splendour as the sun was sinking, and when he sank, and the moon cruel in* her cold clearness rose, grey and hard, and piililess as death. A collision near York had injured the permanent way, and it was midnjgh before we reached our station, where we found Jonas Morlak waiting for us with a closed carriage, ensconced in which we crept along with difficulty over the frozen road -a road never at the best of times a good one. At length, after a wearisome but exci- ting journey, Fèrrar and I found ourselves in our cavernous arin chairs before ft splendid fire in the library, the night too far spent, and we too comfortable to make it worth our while to stir, for the few hours wo could enjoy in bed, so .piling up the logs, we addressed ourselves to sleep with swift and completo success. We slept far oa into the morning, and awoke to find that the.weather signs of the days before wore fully verified. Quantities of snow bad fallon aud the storm still cou timied, so dense as to hide utterly all objects, even at a short distance from tho house. No day this for ghost-hunting through the freezing corridors and tenantloss chambers of the Friary. So, having lazily enjoyed our breakfast, we lounged about the library, which contained many enrions works, a largo number of which belonged to the school of the mystical and supernatural, books on witchcraft and demonology, volumes of witch trails, black letter treatises ou devil1 possession ou vampires and familiar spirits, a rare collection of the literature of devildom. After looking over these for some time, wo made our way to the servants* hall with the design of picking np'.what infor- mation wc could respecting the matter we had in hand. Wo could get nothing ? out ot old Mallory or his wife.. They I seemed afraid to talk on thc subject. '-' Jouas Morlak was the man to go to," thoy said, " Jonas was a strange follo w j no one knew who he was. Mr. Carstaíra' ¡ father, old R-anulph Carstairs, had brought j him', when a boy, to thc Friary, no one H knew from where, lu the old niau** time j ho had the rim of the house, aud used to fiore over those queer old books in ,the I [beary, lío is a very learned mau is Jonas.

Mr. John Carstairs never liked-, him, and snubbed him. rudely, but Jonas was gentleness itself, and accepted with- out a murmur the very humbie office in the household that Mr. Carstairs, with no 'good grace.: either, offered him. Olí ! 'Jonas is the man to go to. He can'' speak if he likes; but be sure to lot him speak ori;' don't question him." We went back to the library and sent for Jouas. . I asked him to sit down which hé did.with a curious ease, despite, his uncouth.'appearance. .There was; no' trace bf vulgarity in his mapper or in- his ".voice,'. ¿ I told' ;biui jin somewhat '. general /terins 'what j liad' eepa-rtrntu to say, I asfiained io ïeii i\im aU-^-and '^ske4 ¡liiui as an .old resident in the Friary , what he thougiit of-it.

The damned spirits' that onr Saviour cast out of mea are there, the dogs of Hell with their slavering jaws, the veiled figures that mop and mow aud make children scream in their sleep, the ghastly horror that doctors call night- mares, and say is but the natural results of lobster suppers. "Oh!*Lord, Lord! what rubbish. 'Through the veil, that is to say, his flesh.' You fight with all your strength against the nightmare ; if you did not you would die. Sjuie do die; some get a last, nightmare aud' wake,-in 1 their own place. Coroner's verdict-- I Sudden death. What a valuable institu- j tion that Coroner is ! But I crave your pardon, masters ; with your leave, I will : go." "Before yon go, Jonas, let me ask j you can you throw any light upon the matter I have told yon of." " ' The light ; shineth in the darkness, and the darkness ¡ comprehended it not," he murmured with a queer smile, and was gone. " I bad as soon meet your slim ghost as sit for five minutes with that fellow!" said Ferrar. " Ho is uncanny. I am glad he is gone." The snow storm lasted for several days, no break appearing in the leaden sky. ¡ Ferrar and I slept in the same room, and slept the quiet sleep of the jost. On the morning of Christmas Eve the sun awoke us with rays strong enough to melt the frost tracings from the window panes, through which we looked upon a superb winter landscape. The snow lay at our feet deep in glittering purity, here is un- broken stretches . of. dazzling whiteness, there is vast drifts sculptured by the storm into shapes weird and fantastic. Deep was the blue above, in which a phantom moon was sailing. The first day after the snowstorm is strangely exhilarating to the healthy. The fresh vigour of the child revels in I the novel aspect of nature. Wo caught 1 the glad contagion, aud laughed aud saug as wa were dressing. <Afc breakfast we laid our plans; That- day should ba devoted to exploring the long walled-up part of ' the Friaryv 1 sought Jonas Moriah and told him of my intention. A. painted look carno over his face, and, look, ing straight into ray eye, ha said-^ " ' There is a way that seeniith wise unto a map, but the cud of that way is death ;' " thou, drooping his glance, he wont on, iu his strange fashion, as to himself, rubbing gently his bauds. " Why not P why nob ? As good be dead as alive, as some uieu Ure. The thin mau will pe bail-follow well-met with us then-in the grave, where all things are forgotten. That is the reason why the dead seem sucta fools. They nra searching, groping, like- one trying to remember a dream, -like old mea liiuttering tho same thing over aud over again. You never meet a ghost that has his. wits about ' him. He /is asleep; but the dreams of good înen au4 bad men are very difforjent. , God^help thji .niau that breaks in du a. bad ghost's, dream!" And haviug so said ta calmly, walked away.. , .. :, ; " , Ferrar aud I after a .< short colloquy resolved to investigate ati once the closed apartments. -.-Wo, went-to the walled-up door at the head of tho small stairs lead- ing to the mysterious chambers. Ou sounding the work with a mallet we learned at once that the partition was but a Jthiu one. A few strong blows soon made afr aperture, and'the rest of the wall was speedily done by taking down brick toy brick.

I slept J know uot how, long, aud woke with a sudden frightened «tarts f Farrar in his chair opposite nie waSslfdpiugprofoúadly. I- thought: it Would be sélfisli'ito awaken him. The flré had bnrnt lbw, and the ^candle wick stood au- inch high, * with .gleaming tops. Hark ! Stealthily steps upon the stairs,-^ gentle opening of the ¿door, 'a soft rustle passed my chair, aud then the . "Shee:e/> I had heard before. My eyes followed tue! sound, and there by the wall before rae I say the back of the 'thin grey-clad. form. Ho seemed to be tapping at a certaiu spot ou the waistcoat with an air of anxiety. / At length, aa satisfied, he was about to turn round as though about to leave the room. I put my hand before "my eyes lest I should again see his face, and for a long time forbore to look up. When I summoned courage to do sb he was gone. - He had given mo a distinct idea. I woke Ferrar, told him what had hap- pened, and my thought. We rang for fresh candles, and, going to that part of the wall which my grim visitor had tapped at, I followed his example and tapped it too. Clearly it was., another built-up door. Roused up now to an intense pitch. ,of excitement, we -showered onr mallet blows upon the wall, and soon a mass of brickwork tumbled to the ground, We stood iu another room, a bed-chamber. The bed, a counterpart of that iu my own room, was closely curtained. A strange, close, somewhat aromatic smell pervaded the room.. I seized khe bed-curtain to withdraw it, Ferrar standing Joy me with the candle. The curtain crumbled to dust in my grasp.the bed and its occupant were disclosed ; at least there was no difficulty iu guessing what the occupant was-the sharp rigid outline nuder the sheet that mouldered into a sort of fungus as I touched it: It was the skeleton of one who had died in agony. No friendly hand had stretched its limbs or rendered it the melancholy service of preparing it for burial. The bony fingers grasped the 1 sheet, and the long woman's hair atill clinging to the skull Was scattered and dishevelled. It was some time before We were able fully to recover our rolf-possession in the presonce of this spectacle. But soon the same idea struck us both, " Get Jonas Morlak here!" We resol- ved to look for him, and to do so together, for our nerves were shaken. Before long we brought him to earth ia. his lonely room in what was known as the Hawk's Tower. He was sitting before the fire, his head resting iu bis hands. Though I called his name lound ly, he seemed at first uucouscious of our presouce, but iu a« moment orsohe bej[|n to away backwards and forwards, aûlT, speaking as HTo'liitti self, said :-rr" This, in a matter to bs hid- den rather than disclosed. Families have lived-and died, and yet; that sweet sleep went on unbroken in a bed that never was made for a hundred years.
