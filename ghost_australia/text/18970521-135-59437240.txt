"Well, I don't know that it is any of your business," replied Lucy Ann, " bat if it will give you any esatisfsotion to know the facts, I don't miad telling you that I shall be a married woman again in about two weeks." "But Tom has been dead lees than three months," protested another. " Well, I suappose he's as dead as he ever will be, isn't he?' "But," said the third, "yon ought in common decency to wait until he is cold." " Wait until he is cold '" ropeated the widow with fire in her eyes.

Then the objecting relatives filed out, and Mrs Teeter resumed the work of pre paring her trousseau.
