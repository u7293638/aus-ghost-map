THEATRE ROYAL Did the great bard of Avon of humanity design the Prince of Denmark as part embodiment of magnificent and princely revenge, part actor ! We imagine not there is no stage-struck confusion of character intended, and for this reason we have to repeat, and with emphasis, our unfavourable judgment of Herr Bandmann pourtrayal of Hamlet given at its previous representation on the boards of the Theatre Royal. Last night Herr Bandmann presented the Prince with his own characteristic merits and demerits. Graceful and noble in portray. ing the gentler and more generous virtues ; brilliant and scathing in irony and sarcasm, rich in histrionic grace and fancy, princely in men and voice, proud in triumph, even thoroughly original in treatment, this powerful actor cannot give an adequate and faithful expression to revengeful hate and intolerable despair. He fails to "hold the mirror up to nature in those grand, awful passions. The course of revenge is not loud-voiced and strutting, any more than its climax is mu-r-r-r-der ; nor is despair a gasp, a facial contortion, and a stagger. Herr Bandmann, great actor as he is, has evidently never known the realities of revenge and despair. From this criticism we gladly turn to a more welcome duty that of commending the artistic and magnificently sabtleactingof Miss LouiseBsaudet as them starred unhappy Ophelia. The mad scene was a grand performance. Mr. J. F. Cathcart, who took the two parts of Ghost and Laertes, acted ably as ever and Mr. Musgrave interpreted with marked success the role of pretentiously philosophical, pedantic old Polonius. The play, in which there were some noticeable innovations, calls for no further remark. Save in the pit, which was fairly well filled, the attendance was not large.
