A MODEL OYSTER FARM. (FROM THE MORNING ADVERTISER) Protected from storms, yet having free access to the sea, shallow, yet not liable to become too hot in summer or too cold in winter, open to currents which bring news ment, and yet not likely to be silted up by mud such, as lately laid down by Professor Huxley, are the essentials of the localities wherein may be carried on successfully the culture of that "delicious bivalve be aptly compares to a gastronomic flush of lightning In addition he Rounds a warning note as to the incessant labour and watchfulness needed to keep the beds clean and free from enemies A visit to an oyster breeding establishment, the owners of which secured, as one result of their endeavours to profit to the utmost by the latest lights shed upon the science of ' ostreiculture the award of three gold medals, two silver, and one bronte at the recent fisheries Exhibition, has served to emphasise most strongly the professors views The oyster beds in question are situate at a corner of that detached frag- ment of Hampshire known us Hay Ung Island and within sound of the evening gun from Marryat's favourite seaport Our route lies along lanes bordered, by bare hedge rows, with a few flickering leaves and by trees with ivy encircled trunks and with branches showing by their inclination the force and constancy of the south westerly gales prevailing in this region , pasts church not devoid of interest to the archaeologist, and a vicarage which is architecturally a somewhat startling replica on a small scale of the White Tower , past a now abandoned " saltern, of salt pit, with its reminiscences of the old smuggling days, when tankers of moonshine ' were cunningly intermingled with honest tubs of chloride of sodium and so transported inland, to the confusion of King George's custom officers and the deep ment of his revenue Hard by Rows a once haunted stream, along the banks of which the ghost of a drowned girl was wont to Hit nightly with outstretched arms and flowing robes of white, as many a belated way farmer was prepared to swear The ghost however, is seen to walk no more, either because the stream has been turned intoaculvert through which she presumably found passage awkward, or because there are no longer any smugglers to perpetuate the long successful acure I hence we strike across a stretch of farm dotted common mind and a stun or stubble field towards a species of skeleton windmill, outlined against the autumn sky, and serving, together with the music of a couple of craft, us our beacon, and so gain our destination This is the wind swept bank of a long shallow creek-or " leat," UB it is locally styled running up from the broad expanse of open water known as Chichester Harbour Although a busy spot there is something of an unfinished, further end of the world aspect about it when con- trasted with the arable and, pasture, dotted with wood and copse, extending seaward there is a small house, with sheds and other appurtenances, and a patch of garden ground All mound are stacked or scattered baskets, wire bottomed trays, flat oblong hampers sicks, rakes, brooms, and other accessories to ostreiculture In front of the house, which serves as offices and headquarters, extends a series of nine parallel beds resembling deep trenches, each measuring lhO yards in length and about 40 in breadth A tenth bed of somewhat larger dimensions, running at right angles to the others, bound them on one side, and a narrow trench with a sluice opening from the heat on the other 'The bottoms of the beds are formed of shell and shingle, and they are separated by broad banks of earth and stones faced with over hurdles, and wide enough to admit of a small tramway being laid along their summits 1 lollies are fitted to roll along these tram ways, and shallow punts or scows float on the surface of the water, filling the beds from the depth of from two to four feet or SO It is neap tide and the

several boats are lying off the pier, a cart is being laden with hampers of oysters from one of them and hard by is a mound of empty shells technically styled cultch and used in the formation of the beds Under the guidance of a representative of the firm of Seesalter and Ham a tour of inspection commences My prior conception of the normal existence of the oyster soon receives a severe shock I

usually spawned in summer and the following summer is about as big as a sixpence or perhaps a little larger Aiming hereof this size has put into wooden trays measuring about 3ft by 4ft i an 1 bottomed

that they have room to grow Thus literally rocked in the cradle of the deep they are overhauled every few weeks and resorted out in sizes-for oysters even of the same breed and batch are found to increase in bulk at varying rates into trays of coarser mesh the same precaution being observed against overcrowding so that each can increase without encroaching on] on or becoming adherent to his neighbour line spacing out so that each may have a fair chance is one of the fundamental principles of the modern system of culture another feature of which is that the oyster does not touch the bottom till he is two years c Id and was generally attained the age of a shilling then after wintering here he perhaps gets a trip to Wlntatable where the firm have other beds and open Is the summer
