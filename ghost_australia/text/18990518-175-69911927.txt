WESTERN AUSTRALIA AND FEDERA TION. TO THE BDITOB. ] SIB,-It is regrettable that when treating opon tbe very material and momentous question of Federation, most of the Federalist speak» rs at public meetings, correspondents to the newspapers, and also a section of the press itself, seem far more desirous to estab lish reparations as soothsayers and sentimen talists than to nive any real enligbtment on the questions at issue. Surely- a measure which purposes to make new governmental machinery of the magnitude indicated should be examined more from the taxpayers1 standpoint than from the regions of fancy. The evil affecting West Australians at the present time are too much Government and over taxation, according to the Hon. A. Matheson we were taxed last year through the Customs alone at £6 5s 91 per head, as against £1 3s per head in N.S. Wales through the same source Taking one quarter of these sn ms respectively as the contribution per head to the Federal Government, it is pla)a that while the West Australian will pay £1 ls for his patriotism, the N S. Welsh man will get his for 6s. We ate further told that our taxes last year from all sources worked out £43.000 short ot the total re quired for local snd federal purposes, so if we'federate the addition of this sum will further increase the disparity. Customs and Excise being the sources of federal revenue, it-follows that what falbj short in Customs must be made up by Excise, The terms are synonymous as affecting the workers1 pockets It may be interesting to state that our total taxation per head, by ail source«, is £8 I ls 9d. and in New Sooth Wales it is £1 16s ll. Eliminating from oar capitation most women and children, a) I paupers and prisoners, poor paterfamilias' burden is a heavy one, yet j these "one flag one destiny" patriots (Í) shoat more for government and consequently m -re taxes, thorne of these power-worship pers tel) us that we must have a big and strong central Government staffed with men with high ideals and large benevolence to wards us, who. if we call upon them, will speedily drive out the Forrest crowd and their meat rings, farmers' riags, and millers1 ; combims, but alas for those believers in adventitious aid, it is not permitted under the consti ution that even those eastern demigods shall interfere in our intern»! i affairs. Ourselves alone have the power and ! can do it if we will. This erv for outside aid reminds one of the " groans of the Britons," and is unworthy of a people possessing free institution?, and at the end of the 19ih century. , We are t. o few in number, too distant from the proposed Federal centre »nd already too much impoverished hy taxes to federate, rather let us insist on free trade, f it is good under Federation it is good nov and always ; it will enable the workers to keep some of their earnings in their p0esäjfj;^|§ to minister to (heir otra and their f*saDkKj|||f comfort and happiness, which are snaeajry^ the ends for which governments -sM^ primarily instituted, hat BS s 1 nun¡slmi3^§|i| they are huge squeezing machines, in the sB^j|j|| te rest of a governing class, the exploiter, »asV|||l the sweater and to extract the ctmost trroin* jg th? people.
