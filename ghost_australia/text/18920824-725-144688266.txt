MELBOURNE GOSSIP. (fbom: odb owh ooebebpoNdekt.) Sir Henry Wrizon daring Ms ijloqnent speech on the Budget, told Proteotipnists some facts, whioh they have been slow to learn, but whioh are oertainly. true all the Same. Commenting on the new and in | creased duties he remarked that Victoria. uau ubu to yoHH ui yivwuuuu, ituu . vue , results proyed.'jt WflB an.all . round failure, - as things' were' never in euoh a de . ploreble etate as at present, : While Vic toria bad several Freetraae colonies to use her surplus there was. some i sense in the fisosl policy, but now that all the ..other colonies were, adopting protection; Victoria had and must continue to suffer; _Protection to.be of any vjilbe muat have an enormous population' to depend upon; 'In this way the United States with over' seventy miiliops'of people Tv-i thin its bor ders 'were justified in relying upon tha| policy, butif^be' 62'sdpsrate states were . to adopt different systems, the whole thing would collapse it unce. TheBe sentences give the gist.bf' the hon. gentleman's re- 1 mflrka, and were listened to with atten tion, interrupted only by some insane reniarks from MrTrenwithj who is making himself notorious in the House, and al though supposed. to be leider of , the so called Labor party is generally disbredited . even by the Trades Hall members. The outspoken remarks of Sir Henry Wrixon caoBed eome commotion .amongst Protec tionists, and although -he was followed by eome nltra-prntectiopists, not one attemp ted. to contradict the ex Attorney -General. Even the ' Age' keeps a discreet silence.' ] The fact is that there is no denying the j force, of Sir Henry's statements. \- If .additional evidence were .needed in I support of the views of the member for Portland, it would be found in a careful study of the newly issued work ' In dustrial'Freedom : A Study in Politics '! by the Hon. B. B. Wise formerly Attorney-General of New South Walee. Thjs volumn'e is an enlargement of Mr Wise's pamphlet Freetrade and Wages ' which he published in Sydney some seven ; years ago. I regret that the spaoe at my j disposal iB too limitod to quotd from'this book. :. I am not going to the length 'of some enthusiastic Freetraders and assert that the book is perfeot,' because jt ; is not so. .Some bf:the arguments- ate rather weak And the figures quoted in some places j are wrong, or rather out of date. Mr i Wise goes to the length of prediotihg lhat ! in the near future, New Sputh .Wales.will j return to Freetrade. The wish is, If ear ^ i fatlier to ttie thought, and the writer n-uBt be remarkably ' sanguine ~U lid imagines that Protection is to be so eaeily got rid of , No, douht he' is correot when he says that *' the suooeBB of the Protec tionist at the last eleotiou was an acciden ? tal victory,' but while yop have manhood suffrage and a large proportion of ignorant electors who are swayed by the harangues of interested polititians you need,! not at present expDot a change for the better.' .Mr^ 'Wise is properly ' severe on your Jjegialative Council, which although com- .- posed of a majority of Freetraders passed the Bill, rather than submit to ; direct laxaUon which wpnld have touched their own pockota Tiiia seT^iahnrsa wflB the ybiy reason why our rai' Upper House consented to Protection,' This inconsis tency is much to be regretted, because it form's a source of strength to 'the other Bide. If our wealthy Freetraders in Vic toria had Recently etuck out for au income and property tax, and other sources of direct taxation, a great blow would have been given to. Protection. ' Instead of this they selfishly 'refuse to pay a penny out of ' tbeir.great wealth, and Jet the burden of : . the peff taxes fall upon . tbe BhouIdera of -the poorer olessss . while they escape alto-' : getherl : We are told that these new sad , iucraased Uxes wilV enconrase local indue try, and revive .languisbiiig factories: Why it will be 12 br'18 :mbnths before any ejects are noticed, and in the meantime hundreds of thousands of pounds will havb , to. be 'paid in I axes, without' the taxpayer deriving .a jred bent from them. I com mend tp the notiop of intelligent Protec: tionists Mr Wiae'e very valuable ibpok, be csuae with all its defects it' ia ' sit - un^ answerable defenoeof poreFreetrade. \- ' I don't often refer totheologioal matters but' e'paragrapli occasionally may not be out of place.' In last week's ' Obristian Pioneer ' issued by the body of people' calling themselves ' DiscipleB of Christ ' there are one or two glaring - mistakes which I feel inclined to reotify. ' On page 274 a writer asserts. ' No houost scholar . believes that sprinkling is baptism— Bap- tizo means immersion, and means nothing else.' This statement is deoidedly in correct. I do not claim to be a Greek : soholar, but I am at least familiar with the language. There are hnndrods of echolara of all denominations, and of no denomina tion at. all ,who agree that the'word, Bapl tizo, has various meanings Thus the Jewish ceremony of sprinkling furniture ?&A.; referred to in Numbeia XIXi is in two or three plaoes in the New Testament termed baptism. The baptism' of the Holy Ghost is called pouring. In other places the word means washing, wetting *nd staining. In the clasaias we fiud 'it just the same. - Pindar, uses b^ptizo to expreBB 'floatiug -as a oork,' Siooulus oalls the sailing ol1 his ship pn'the water by the same word,; and in another pUpe! he OBes it id refer to the uolleotion of taxes, Po1ybius and ; Stabo 'says the I soldiers were baptised who merely had to. walk through some water.- Plato ; aiid 'Aristophanes calls drunkenneis a bfiptism .of. .wine. : Homer, .
