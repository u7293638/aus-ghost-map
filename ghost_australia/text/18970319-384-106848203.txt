CHAPTEH XXXIII. 5311 raoM GrosGs. As the dinner hour drew n~e. Miss Carleton returned to the house and went np to Isola's room. She found her sitting up inbe-., while she read George Berkele's letter. There rwas a glow upon her lately colonrless face, and her eyes sparkled with her nsual animation_ Miss Carieton iad recovered outward composure, and with her usual afectionate kindnes she said: ' I -ee that vou are agreealy- emplo?red, soI will leave you to the enloyUment of George's letter.

This as?ounrance satiefed her friend, and remtoved the fears she felt in spite of the solicitude of the Italian for Is.-la's re cocers_ She lingered long enough to ar range her dress, and then left the girl to read anain ths letter which contained so mnrch that was precious to her. During the months that had elslsea since the r-arture of George Berkely. Isola had learei to look on him as her future companion for life. All1 his true Oelities arc:e before her in vivid c'nira,-t of l'ilip. and the -earm frienindshiJ she head chlththed for George assumed the hue of lovre. She felt that she could inml,licrit truIts: that honest nature, and give him that entire respect without which afectirn can have no firm hasi. His let.ter ran thus " St. Peterabnrg, " ovember,. 15, 18 "My Beloyed Ioola:-Your precious letterhas jest reached me.

"I ha ve now been in St. Petersburg aEL-.erl weeks. and 'we have weather to swhih our keenest mountain breeze is com parate.e -.sunler. " Oar ambascador has been received by the Emperor. and his vul-orli.oates have, with hin.a -tended a court ball. There I had the honoor of an introduction to the the grandest looking man I have ever seen. "'iche0as is a mannicenot man, and as courteous as he is h-.dsomne. He woas sur rounded. by ' :ri:inl grooup o ofZeers who had dis:inguished themselves in his ser rice. "Onong them was a satelE-loorking man, who attracted me from the first mo ment my eyes fell on him. I -annrst tell why thiis was, for he was no: more striking in his appearance than many others near him. He ws a omiddle-aged man, withl hair sprinkled with grey. and the eapressicn of one 'who has suffered wrong. hardship, and dis-apointmen:t; all of which hi:ad been merged in the phiiloophic determination to make the most of what Heaven spared from the wreeked hopes he had left scattered upon his life-path. "I inquired who he war, and learned that he is an Italian of the name of Fon tani. who for many years has been in the employment of the Emperor es an engineer, His services have been rewarÂ·ded with the title of Iaron and a large estate near Mos cow; and the decorations he wore bore seit ness to tne triumphs he has gained. ]ut he soon retirea from the gay scene, in which he only appeared at the command of his master. "It would fill up my letter to describe to you the magnificence of the scene on this occasion. ImagineAladdin's palace illumi nated with radiance, and filled with a crowd of iovely and richly dressed women, at tended by cavaliers in brilliant court cos tnme. "It was late when we made our congi; in my sleigh was Charles Brinsley, my fel low attachi, and n msvif ; the night was en choat?ting; the moon was shining with a lIstre that rendered every object risible, and we sped over the snow-clad earth with the velocity of the wind. At a sudden turning, our sleigh came in contact with another approacsing from the opposite di rection. The collision was so riolent that one of our horses fell in the traces; but the fiery steeds of the other sleigh swerved to one side, dashed ferward, evidently unman ageable by the driver, who had been par toltng too freely of the strong waters t which his countrymen are much ad dirted. "A gentleman attempted to spring out, but caught his foot in the leopard skin xwith which the sleigh -.?s lined, and fell in such a position as so b in dunger of having his brains dashed ount by the horses. I sprang to his assistance, seized the reins, and suc eeded in holding them in till Brinsle. end ithe driver coeid come to my assistance. "Thme check enabled the prostrate man to recover his footing and extricate himc_.lf from his perilous posi'ion. He spoke tc the horses, and they stood docile and obe dient to his voice. He thanked us for out e.rirts to serve him, and insisted that we siuld eaccept seats in his rehicle since ours was disabled. He said: "'I am idaron Fontani, and I am on my way to the palace to lay before the En?m eror someuesapatches shich have inst ar rirved; bnt 1 pledge myself not to detain you many moments, and I will then set jon down at your own hoteL* " Of course we accepted his offer; and taking the reins in his own hands, the Baron bade his driver remain with ours and aid him in every p..seible manner. "Alfterrabrief interiew w-ith the Czar he returned to us, and soon set us down at our own door. On parting from -ue he gave me his card, and requested me to call on him on the following day, I. of course, availed myself of his invitation to visit hinl. " At asa early an hour as I hoped to find him free to receive friendly calls, I went to his palace. He met me with his kindins-s:; was pleased to exaggerate t:he service I had rendered him, and shooed as much interest in my afiirs as if he had been a friend of long standing. -The Baron informed me that in his youth he had travelled in the United States. -MIany portions of the counsrv in tem ested him deeply, especially the moun tan scenery of my native state, with which he -esmued familiar. He showed me ' Jeff-_ ersjons Fotes on tirginia' in his library; ani I discrered that he understands Eng lish, though at first he spoke to me in Ersucho "He showed me several sketches, which he said he had purchased from a wandering artist; and among them I found a picture of the T'ele, and another of La Fontaine. He pointed to the aIntter, and void: "'I was induced to take that because the name is so nearly my own. Do you know of such a place in your native State?' "I told him all about the p!ace and the connection between its owner and my Ismill. I cannot describe to you the in sorest with which he listened. He inquired about Mr. Fontaine-his hatlits, his peculi arities; end when I had finished my de scription, he said: "' From your account of him, one would think this man a king among his peers. How is it that he has never married ?" "I could not explain that, but I referred to constitutional melancholy as the pro bable scause. He seemed struck with that, and quickly asked: " Is there no other cause for that sad ness? It seems to aoe that the owner of this beautiful rlace, situated in a brascing mountain atmnosphere, and surrounded, as you say he is, by kind and steadfast friends, should be able to rid himself of the morbid taint in his blood to vwhich you refer.? '" H haid muoch to sadden his yoolh,' I told him; but the Baron was not satisfied till he drew from me the shole of that sad story absot Henry Fontaine. When I had ~fuiushed, he said: If your friend was guiltless in that alair. s wh should he cherish the feelings you have described? I an: afraid there is a dark stain en the ermine of his robe, sapotl!ess as you would have me believe it.' "'urgive me, isola, for repeating hlis words to you, for we klnow; how pure, how noble Mr. Fontaine is-how far above eny temptstion to crhue, and ?sach crime as this ! "I s?eedil; disabused my new friend of this idea; but he has shoan the intlrest he takes in the subject by frequen:ly referring: to it ihen -e meet, and the mtsterr o1 Henr. Fontaine's fate seems to posre.s as utrong an attraction for him as it could for the nearest friend of ~cur father. " I have not s et told him of yon. I do not 'ro ?lt: feeh:.g sithlserd me; l.ut I am a isealous tisier. who hboards his happi nes0 in his own least as too sacred to he shared by others; for in this I am not ex pansive enough to make the idol whose shrine is in my iniost :ear' visible to tbho-e around me. To the vo:' ins-day world I g:ve m:; energies; to you. the consecrated dreams of love and hope. "I hare a :ni:na ure of you which I pilfered from Fanny. and in mn sol:tary hours it is my constant cumpani .?np i yearn to return to you. to clainl ra i n l own for ever, but my friends wouhl :.: : prove of it just now; so I must e " impatience, and prove moself r .:', the happiness that awaits me.
