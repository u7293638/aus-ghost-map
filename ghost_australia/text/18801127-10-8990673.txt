THE GHOST. TO THE EDITOR OF THE MERCURY, Sir,-It has been supposed that his ghostship is a creation of apparatus, electric light, etc. If this is so, it would be well for persons surprised, to look in the direction whence the "reflection" comes, and thus the "cover" of the-heartless manipulator might be discovered. Trusting it may, and that his ghostship will get his deserts,-Yours, a c., NOT PEPPER'S GHOST. Hobart Town, November 24, 1880.
