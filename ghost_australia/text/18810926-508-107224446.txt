Amusements. There is little that is fresh to note with regard to saausemonts this week. ' Madame Favart ' still attracts good houses at the Royal, and is evidently better appreciated than ' Olivette.' At the Queen's Mr. Dewhurst appeared en Saturday as Kiehard- the Third, and to-night he will play Claude Melnotte. During tbe week he will repro duce several of his most successful im personsationB. ' Fatuutxa ' waa produced at tbe Upera House on Saturday evening with success eqmal to thai of former eveninos, and it is announced that to-meht will Bee it for tbe last time. Tbe School of Arts was crowded to the doors to sec Mr. Maeoabs's impersonations en Saturday, and the atyaterionB ghosts at Tiotori* Hall, who oome when Mr. D'Arcv Bead does call them, also attracted a capital house. We Bheil not much longer have to . omit the Gaiety from cur notioes, Already tbe alterations and improvements aro in a forward state. A new inclined floor is being put down, and other improvements effected, the lessees expanding about .Â£500 on the wort. Itifl thought that ail will be ready -by this day week, and then Air. Dampier will appear in a picoe entitled, ' My Motbcr-in-Law.'
