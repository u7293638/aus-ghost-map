TO THE EDITOR OF THE HERALD. S r,- On Saturday, the 4th instant, the annual demonstration of the Hospital Saturday Fund will, as usual, take the form of an outdoor collection, when something tiles loOO collectors will appeal both to the travelling public and to those who stay at home for contributions in aid of all public medical charities of Sidney and suburbs The ladies who unselfishly devote their whole day to the work are volunteers without exception. and of the wage earners who are not yet regular contributors to the fund would remind the collectors' n Holt's by giving a day's pay it would be a full recognition of the star vice the ladies pel for in, and no more than a fair discharge of the obligation which every citizen in under to the hospitals for the benefit they directly or indirectly confer upon them There are thousands of workers who generously do their duty to the hospitals by contributing regu- lars every pay day to the weekly or monthly collections made on behalf of this fund in the various places of bu<,iiii>sii where they are employed, but there are many thousands of workers the have not as yet seen the necessity of performing their part, nor realised the facilities which the association offers them for doing it To such the appeal next Saturday is especially directed There are also large numbers of well-to-do and even wealthy people who are unknown as direct supporters of any charity people who deny themselves the greatest luxury that money can procure, the consciousness of being useful and of actively bene filing others they are the lineal descendants of "Scrooge" who have not as yet received a visit from " Marley's Ghost " to point out to them that the shortest and easiest road to happiness is to be found in contributing to the happiness of others Our collector as will give to the " stooges " of our time an opportunity of experiencing a new sensation of an agreeable kind which will lighten their pockets and their hearts at the same time THE every to the ladies collect there will ten human life saved by a premature death, of the pangs of disease and death-rate relieved to some pier fellow creature who 13 past the aid of Ulan Tile need for special effort and the claim for a liberal response sale never more pressing I can at the present time Owing to various causes the income of the principal hospitals for the past ) iii has not sufficed to meet their necessary expenditure Si. duly Hospital requires about iJUOO to make up the shortage, the case Of Prince Alfred Hospital 15 nearly is bid, then deficiency being over 6000 and even the Children's Hospital, that institution which, it seems to me, should appeal most strongly to the sympathies of e\ eryone, 1 requires the sum or £600 In order to balance accounts The Hospital Saturday Fund is now in the seventh year of its existence During the first six years, culminating May, 1890, the total amount collected was over £20,000, and in the same period £18.010 was distributed amongst the various medical charities in such a manner that not one word of complaint has been heard This amount, which has been obtained from new sources, has sufficed to provide the best of medical attendance, nursing, and maintenance in hospital for nearly 2000 men, women, and children stimulus to provide for themselves, and this constitutes the claim of the association for further support the only reward that the managers of the Hospital Saturday I used desire for the work already done is largely increased public support to enable the association to do still butter work So far the work of the association has been confined to propagandist work and 11 helping the hospitals by direct grants of money, but if this fund had increase I support It could give relief to the hospitals, and at the same time benefit the community to a far greater extent, on the principle that " prevention is better than cure," by establishing a home or homes in some salubrious situation on the highlands as the Birmingham fund has done where the invalided bread- winner, or overwrought mother or ailing child, could be sent before they are completely disabled by disease that follows neglect of proper tory symptoms With increased means the fund could carry on an active crusade against disease by means of framed lecturers and suitable literature J Our hospitals are crowded with people who, " if they had " known something of the laws of health, would not have had occasion to he there In our cities are thousands of people unconsciously distribut- ing germs of disease Our cemeteries am crowded with the prematurely dead, the victim of ignorance in themselves or their parents, or both. And the sum of all this means an awful amount of individual suffering, national loss of wealth, national deteriora- tion I am, Sec., FRANK GRIMLEY, Hon. Treasurer Hospital Saturday F una. May "at?
