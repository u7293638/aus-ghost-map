HOW TO PREVENT TYPHOID. TYsnoeD is a disease of bacilli, typhoid bacilli; and the bacilli we find in human ~excrement, and in drinking water fouled by such excrement. It is probable that noman or woman ever takes typhoid except by swallowing some typhoid bacilli. They may be swallowed, as we have said, in drinking water, or they may be flying about the air in the neighbourhood of typhoid excrement, and may be swallowed with mouthfuls of air. What then is the first and last com mandment of typhoid prevention ? "Clean-, lines; personal and public cleanliness." It is all there. If we keep ourselves clean; if we keep our drinking water clean; if we keep our closet and our drains, and kitchen, sculleries, gardens, streets, and towns en tirely clean, typhoid will be pratically as great a stranger to most of us as is the ghost of King Solomon or the shade of the extinct Deinotherium.-HosepitaJ.
