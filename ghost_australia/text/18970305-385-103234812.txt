An. drew Bruce made his way to that part. of "thie deck 'where the dead man'had lain await 'ine litrial;"" 'r' The bo.ly lay there still, sewn up in the hamnmock,anl thrown into a sheltered cor ner. where it escaped the full' force of wind nnd water. While seires of living men had bhe.en swallowed pn by'the sea this deadtman was spared.. â€¢. Andrew Bruce saw the shrouded figure, by the flash of the lightning, and put forth.his foot and touchedeitt. Ilisiface, as he stool I there in.the stormy darkness, wore a strange lek-the look of, a man beset by some strong, temptations, to which he was not wholly willing to seonmb. - For five minutes, perhaps,ho hesitated, his face ashen white, his breath coming in labored gasps, then suddenly ihe fell on his knees beside the corpse of the man who had been his friend. "I may as well take them," hne muttered. , Where's the harm 1 And there's no telling what they are."' He drew a small knife from his pocket, and opere I tihe keen, slim' blade. Then, with a few rapids strokes, though hlie worked in utter darkness, he cuit on opening in the hanmmok much larger than was necessary for the purpose, for be rent it more than half its length. .. . With .eager hanids he groped for a few moments around the dead mani'sbosom. He fotind the miniature and the package of letters.,and drew them forth. The paekage was warm, so was the Ivory ease of the miniature. So also wson the bosom from which he had taken them, drenched as -it-was- by the-e _st-hi.he-tereor andi-brry, 5ndrew Bruce took no siote of"these strange factsi tie had the miniature and the letters in his own breast, looked about him with atartled glances, to he certain this robbery of the deal had not been witnessed, and then fled away to make an'effort to save his own life. : -The dead man lay where be left him ; the hammock cut away, his chest and his face both exposed. An awfully ghlnst ly face it was, as a sudden lightninig flame illuminated the deck for an instant,' a face very like unto death..' .Yet on' the right cheek there was a long gash, made by Bruce's careless and cruel knife, and from this wound a slender stream Sofred blood trickled.. ' " ' . Andrew BriOee,' hiing secured the papers -heocoveted, hurried forward just. as the 'nautilis parted amidships with a thundering noise. 'He haid seeired .a lifoepreserver, and then made his waay to that part of the wreck whichiwas;nearest thecoast. The'blaek waves were strewn with bits of timber, and floating chests, and boxes and to these dozens of eOorsolls'elung, striggling ,for life, be 'ling beatendown'evedy'mlonte bythe restless waves. ,'''. : . There.was small chance of escape; little hope of life, but Andrew Bruce was resolute to risk his; fate.'' He was a daring man, oid ui eixpert swimmer. ' Whilean effdrt re. mained to him he would not stand and wait \- for-death.--- -, . He.was on the.point of leaping off the wreck,'which was momentarily going to pieces, when a sht ill ery arrested his attention -on child's cry. He looked down, and the moon, wading through drifts of black, and throwing a fitful light upon the scene of horror, showed him a child just below him, clinging with both frail arms to the vessel's side, his poor, imploring little face looking up but a hand's breadth above the seething sea. The child was the son of the dead man lying on the deck beyond. Andrew Bruce recognised the boy at a glance, and with a thrill of surprise. He thought he had- gone to his doom long ago. Seeing him thus, however, his first impulse was to save him. lie could save him, and give him a chance for life. Sle actually made a movement toward the child, as another entreating cry reached his ears; but a sudden thought struck him, and he stood irresolute. "I I save him, he may come between me, and-and-what I hope for," he slowly mut tered. While he hesitated thus, a great wave dashed over the wreck and the child was swept away. With a frantic leap, Bruce gained the open sea beyond the wreck, and began to battle for his life. But his very face, as the pale moon-rays revealed it, was changed; for in that swift moment Andrew Bruce, hitherto a comparatively moral man, became a murderer". The rubicon of crime was passed; and henceforthl his course would lead dlownward. 'fThe opportunity had been given him to make his choice betIween right and wrong, and he had cosen the latter. A ceol'ess vorning followed that night of death and hqrror, and golden sunshine leamed i we l e pon the sullen sea and the drenche l shores strewn sith debris of the wreck an1 the ghastly fnee' of the drowneol. Searms of people flockel to the so -e from all qearters, some eager for plunder. others mere'y curious to see, and a few in telt on good ieorhoses. Among the utter were two or three peasant women from the pieighorhood of St. Hale. " Look, Clotilde I look l" cried one of thean a florid dame, speaking in her native tongue, " theres a little la, no bigter than your Aedre, all dead and drowned, poor little i'elonw." . . . . Lots of them went dlon last night, poor fellows. Here, mate, lene a hand here, will you? Let us take this chap over to the guard-housee; he has got a qdecr look some how for a deed man. I can tell a corpse by the look, and the feel, too. There's a se?rk o' lifesomewhere here, if I'm not much emi' taken." The men carried the body off toward the geeard- housee; weeile the women weeping and -chattering by turne,-tenderly-lifted-- tlhe boy andhurried away in the direction of St. Male. It is a month later, and Clotilde has re turned to her own cottage in the valley of ghe Loire.

Accordingly, she has cut short heo visit to her eister, oear St. ,falo, arid has re. turned home to make ready for her husband's coming. She sits in the cottage pore .neos oaeany afternoon, watching her two children as they play beneath the limes. fhe p.l4ts them hoth her own, and loves them almost with an equal fondness-her son Andre, and the little storm-waif, the boy found on the coast on the morning after the wreck. They restored him to life, she and Rachel, and Clotilde has brought him home with Andre to her own cottage. "The dear little fellow," she thinkswatch. ing the two tihldren as they follow their hoops. lOh, I.do.hopo that Andrew won't mind my keeping him when he comes. I should so hate to part with himl" Even'w?h ilethise thomrughts fill her mind the vine-leaves rustle behind her. She looks up and utters a cry of joy.

But his father threw him off, without grieeting or caress, and stood st.aring' at the other child with'distendling eyes and gasping lips. ' - .

"Course you I" he hissed between his set teeth. "'You shall die I" The lad shivered with terror, as the man's iron grip clutched him,,but he looked up with clear, brave eyes. " Whydo you want to murder me,Andrew Bruce?" he asked, simply. Yeou promised my father to take care of me, and take me to England." This si?ple question went to the guilty man's heart like a knife, and for one minute he felt a pang of genuine remorse. " Yes, I promised him," he gasped, in hoarse accents. 'and called. God as my wit. ness." '. . tie staggered braek a paceor two-and-he k into a seat, covering his face with his hands, . "'Tis not too late now." he muttered.

"He shall not live to thwart my plans,"he yelled. "lHe shall die i" He struck the ehildi a brutal blow full on the temple, a s'ngan eglywouind,and felling him to the floor, where hie lays bleeding and insensible, while Clotilde and Andre shrieked with terror. But Bruce soon silenced both with threats and oaths. Take him uip and carry him into the kit. chen," he commandted. " When it grows dark P'll throw him into the Loire." Clotilde obeyed without a word, shivering in every limb with mortal terror. She laid the child down on the lounge, covered his ghastly blood-stained face,and then crouched down herself with her son at her knees, watching her maniac husbandasshe deemed him, with affrighted eyes. Bruce looked at her, and broke forth into amused laughter. " You think me mad I" he oskel,divining ther thoughts. Well, I am mad-drunk with my owe good luck, Clotilte I There's nc need to tremble so; the fit is off now; it was the sight of that boy therethat brought it on ; but re lies quiet enough. lIe won't arise between me and my good fortunc arain I Sit still, Clotilite ;" I have my senses back now; I won't hurt you, my girl; I? awfully glad to see you; and I hase a w ndrous story to tell you.

The night had fallen dark and rainy, there was no help within hearing of the lonely cottl.e. She looked up at her husband's face which mocked her with fiend. ish cruelty. "One I two-" " Oh, Heaven pity me.? Yes, I will swear." The pistol was lowered from her head., "That's a sensible girl now," commented her husband. "I'll take you along, and you shall share my good fortune ;and you'll lead a jolly life Clotilde.
