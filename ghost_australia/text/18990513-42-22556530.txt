Keep Out of the Past. ELLA WHEELER WILCOX. Keep out of the Past, for the highways Are dark with malarial gloom; Its gardens are sore and its forests are drear, And everywhere moulders a tomb. Wbo seeks to regain its lost pleasures Finds only a rose turnod to dust; And its storehouse of wonderful treasures' ■ Is covered and coated with rust. Keep out ol the Pait. It is haunted t He, who in its avenues gropes," Shall nnd there the ghost af a Joy prised the Ynost, A skeleton throng of dead-hopes. In place of its beautiful rivers Are pools that are stagnant with slime; And graves gleaming bright in phosphoric light Hide dreams that were slam In their prime. Keep out of the Past. It is lonely, And barren and black to the view; Its Ares have grown cold and its stones are old- Turn, tarn to the Present—(he New. To-day leads you up to the hill tops . - That are kissed by the radiant son; To-day shows no tomb, life's hopes are in bloom, And to-day holds a prise to be won.
