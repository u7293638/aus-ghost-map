POETRY, j : Once iUo.ro, ^ ; ' IXTERMISA mi 7 BELLA.' 1 1 had not thought again to ba A dreamer of such dreams as there. The springtime is no more for me ; My summer died bcyoiid the ecas, iTrom what untimely source begin These stirrmgj of the Jife within ? 1 had uot thought ngain to taste The bitter sweet, tho joyous-pain. I deemed th;it I bad trodden waste, Beyond the power of sun or rain, The Soil, that,gfew the passion' frujt ; — Then, 'whence this blossom under fool ? 1 had thought again to be , Beyond t'je homely path of truth j The lights and shapes of witchery, That glorify (be skies of youth , I oniy knew as perished things ; Whence, then, this fl-ish of angel wings ; How spend the day, yet save the hours 7 j I had my day ; the hours are fled. How eat the fruit, yet hold the flowers f I aft tbe fruit j the, flowers -ro dead. ' Oh, what divine or fiendish art Hath twined trcsh tendrils round my heart ? ' I said, is good to be alone, ? No alien hand io urge or check, ? I said, my spirit is my own, . ... . . ? \- To loose br'bind, to save or, wreck/' I trod on Love, called Reason lord Li, whencc this subtle silken cord 1 .Oh, who shall tell if tbis be strength Re-ris'eb, or ghost of old dcfcct ? The truth of manhood come nt length,. Or weakness born of purpose ivrockod ? I only knowTt is t'ie whole Arch'craving of a hungry soul, 1 only know that all the hordes Of buried hopes and jealousies Arc risen .again and crossing swords, 1 And thai 'twas but an armistice, A breathing time 'Lwixt strifc and strife, Which I had a pence of life. Oh, who shall tell where duty lies— To urge, repress, advance, or stay 1 To grasp at Good in Beauty's guise,. Or brush the pretty lure away, Ere doubtful war of hopes ..and fears Consume the hoarded stength of years ? J. Bbunton Stephens'
