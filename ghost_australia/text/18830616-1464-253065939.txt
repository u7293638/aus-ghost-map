Gaudeamus Igitur. I surd rumour — absurdly said to have originated in the seething J|\ brain of Mr. David Buchanan, M. P., is in circulation along the Mf heights of Woolloomooloo and Darlinghurst. and may have reached St. Leonards and Balmain already — l'or all we know. "V It is to the effect that J. McElhone, Esquire, M. P., who may be a J. P. some day, has taken the pledge against all profanity of language, including domestic objurgations and senatorial dithyrambics. This wonderful change of tone and temper in a man of such fiery soul has been, it is further alleged, brought about by a sudden apocalypse of all that is " hawful " in the character of A. G. Taylor, Esquire, also M.P., but without the ghost of a chance of ever being a J.P. Mr. McElhone knows right well that two cock-eagles cannot live at peace in the same mountain region, or two male lions in the same wilderness ; and, acting on the conviction that springs from this knowledge, he is determined to leave defamations, philippics, and crimson idiomatic mosaics to the Pride of Mudgee, Mr. Taylor, or to the practical joker of that famous place, the original Buchanan him self. We rejoice greatly over Mr McElhone's conversion, and trust he will obtain through his friend, Archbishop Vaughan, a plenary in dulgence from the Vatican for past transgressions, and the grace to prevent future backslidings. If that were done, he might proudly and confidently use the cabalistic letters, R. I. P., as the motto to his coat of arms.
