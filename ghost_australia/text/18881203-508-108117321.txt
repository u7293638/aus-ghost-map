THB-COHEESSTOir TO A BAETOXHHr ABMY CAPTAIN. : The following account of what then occurred was given in evidence before the magistrate by Mr. Walter Stanley CotfereU, captain of the Salvation Army at Tuubridge Wells, who deposed that he lived at Ety lane. He knew the prisoners, who had been in the habit of attending the meetings daring the hitter portion of the time he had been in the town — six or. eeven weeks. There was a service held at the barracks on Thursday evening, October 11 In the course of that meeting he was exhorting people to '. give themselves fully to God and conquer sin. The subject of his address was ' 'Victories won, \- and what they cost' In the prayer meeting which followed he invited those who were in earnest to come forward and volunteer to start a new life by giving themselves fully to God. The two prisoners came up ;\ to the table, and, according to the usual practice, prayers were offered for them. There was an exhortation especially to them if there was anything on their mind to make it known and confess their sin. He did not suspect anything of the crime when he was stooping down whispering in the ears of the prisoners. He did not mean them to make a public confession, but a con fession to God. There seemed to be SOiEBTHTNG VKBX HEAVY ON GOWEb's KEJD, and the following morning, between half-past 8 and ^o'clock, Gower came to his house. He let him in, spd took him into the front room, no one else being gjV present. When he first opened the door he Bhook hands, pl§4nd said to him, *? Good morning ; did you get victory ^pap night?'

He received a telegram, and in consequence he went to the police. 'The same afternoon be accompanied Superintendent Embery to the Baltic Saw Mills. He waited outside, and' in a short time the superintendent came out with Gower, who shook hands with him, aniL&aid;, 'Well, captain, I thought jou would have wattef till to-night' That' meant that be should have waited till he had called back again with his friend, Gower added, 'I have been thinking all the morning of coming round and seeing you to-night with my mate.' Witness replied, 'I have to act under orders from my superior officer.' The telegram he received TOLD HIS TO GO AT OSCE TO TEE TQI3SE, and he showed Gower ihe telegram he had had, With that they walked together to the police-station. He said, 'What would yon do, captain?' and he re plied, ' Out with the lot It will be - better for you.' That was the last statement before they got to the sta tion. The above evidence was corrected by Dobell on Monday, who declared that there had been no tossing or drawing of lots — that was a mistake. When the matter was put into the hands of the police authorities, Superintendent Emberry proceeded to the Baw- miUfl and saw Gower, stating that he should charge him with being concerned, with another man, in murdering Lawrence, detailing also what the Salva tion Army captain had told him. Gower -replied, ' Yes, that is right Dobell is a mate of mine, and as true as steeL' The superintendent, oa searching him, found a key, and this, the prisoner said, belonged to an outhouse, where he kept rabbits, and where the pistol would be found in a box on the top oi a rabbit hitch. The BUDerintendent found these thincs as described, the revolver being loaded in all six chambers. D0BEH HAD BEEN A32BESTED IN THE MEAKTOtE by Police-constable Bennett at his house.

The detective said,' Who do yon mean ?' and the prisoner replied, * William Gower,' At flie poliee-station DobeU volunteered the statement : v There is one only thing I know of the murder. At the inquest Mrs. Lawrence said a man came to the door and called her husband out That is wrong ; Lawrence was already outside the door when I got there. XT? rNTKNHON WAS TO HAVE S&OT; tttut ON TBB SPOT but I heard someone in the passage' Subsequently Dobell added: 'A good many people have wondered howit was that Lawrence was on the timber side of the yard. I coaxed him across, telling him we should be able the better to see Mr. Better coming down the road. The only persons to speak the truth were the two lads in the yard, and everything they eaid was correct' This statement was not made in answer to questions, but of the prisoner's own free wilL The superintendent of police charged him with the murder, and informed Dobell that Gower had declared that he, (Dobell) had fired the shot Prisoner said, in reply '?You are right; you have ^ot the murderer.' When searched, A. EETTEB WAS FOUND OS HHI 7BOU G0WBB, commencing 'My dear Mat& — I believe the Holy Ghost entered your heart last night ; God only knows I wish it had mine. There seems to be something I cannot give up, but I am still believing.

PoEce-coastable Bennett said Mr. Cripps .was pasaiTtg Dobell's cell when he put his head through the door and ?yn'Tfc-»fl, 'It is a wonder you did not hear of another murder.' Upon the constable replying '?What do you mean?' Dobell answered that on the previous Wednesday week, September 26, he and Gower had Bent a letter to a man named Langridge, who worked at the saw'mills, telling- him to meet them in Ghasence-zoad, where they were going to bring a girl for Mnu **I and Gower,' he continued, 'went, to Clarence-road and saw Langridge, . and we were going to pop him off, only a policeman was there. We thought to finish one more o&, and that was Edwards, and then we should have stopped.' The latter, Mr. Cripps explained, gave evidence at the police-court on September 14 to the effect that one day a short time previously he met a man named Man-ti^ who said he had broken into the Baltic Saw Mills some years ago. Edwards informed the police and Martin was consequently .taken into cus today, and committed for trial on a charge of breaking into tits mills. These facts having been given at Monday's proceedings, which lasted nearly six hours, both prisoners were committed for trial. The young fallows appeared very cool and self possessed. They are respectably connected, and the case has created a painful sensation in the town.
