Oonsidering Up large number of lawyers In; the Bouse, it is a rather etnSoae tiling that ±be legal blunder was not discovered before.

A sjetetn df horse-tramways' would do no havni to prxrperty-rowners, and at the satire tinie accomplish a. serviee to tib« pablic not only equal *p, bHtfar superior to the^aboraination wnieb now exists, -and which -the judgas have de clared to fee illegal, a oonunon nuiaance, and an unwarranted intertf ereECO v-tth the justrighfcs and privileges of tihe public. To show how absurd the statement of our morning contemporary is, when it asserts that the present tramway wort wtthin the -ity oould not be aooainpiished by horses, we may point to i3x errxji-ienoe of London. Paris. ifesr Tork, and oiiier large European and Ameri can towns^ vhere .much larger populations have to be, and ace, provided for, .end more passengers carried daily, as affording a suf3eient answer. It may be further noted that on tbe occasion of the opening -of the Centermial Exhibition at J?tiiladelphia, the attendance was oonsiderably ov«r 300^00, and tbe whole of 1Mb traffic was speedily, safely, and successfully conveyed solely by means of horse tramways. This is a fact than; oon be easily -and inoontestably proved. In London more passengecs ere carried, daily by means of hoeee txamways than are oarried inv a week in Sydney^and yet there is no block in the streets caused by a continuous stream of tram cars — though there is a continuous stream. It is this latter foot that senders -the horse system] of tramways so extremely' valuable, andi so muoh superior -to the absurd monstrosities whioh an intense igroorftnoe first foisted upon this: oomnmnitj', and.the consumed eaSstenoeot which the most reckless disregard of life and property, together with great obstinacy can alone esplain. As w« have already eoia, the position is serious, .and the Government, realising the gravity of the situation, have resolved. upon~fehe extraordinary course ot' calling the Parfiatuent -together oh Tuesday, tha S9th testonfr-* fortnight Booner than the date to which tbe Houses were originally: prorogued, — in order *o obtain legal snihorlty' tor tbe employment of the fiteom motors. The legalily of this .stop nt- oae — £he *t3Sera3d'' ex-. cepted — will question ; -bat st .tos sanie Sme no oa-s srfll deny that the proprieto of itfe open to; the gravest objection; and ,we fancy that mem bers of Hue Lregialature generally, but especially^ those who -live in ^fehe interior, will strongly objecib to their Padiamentary holidays being thus smn-^ madly interfered wifch. ib & rule members of the Legislature require adl ihetfLme of the Par-; liamentary recesses to attend to tltelr private1 business, and it is quite likely that many &f; them will be positively unable to spare the time ho. attend uns special session of Parliament which: the -JovBrnment bsve thought ft necessary to: have convened. Thus there is danger that the' souse of tbe country lnsy not be fairly elicited upon the question .fct issue. JEt teems to tie that' the -mset course for fixe Government ip have adopted was toaoeerA the Inevitable, and -while upholding tbe dignity of fos judicial bench, set an example of obeervQnoe of the law by discontinuing the present system wftfo as little inconvenience to |bo public as possible, and the adoption of one not only legal, but also better, cheaper, seder, and more oowfenient. It -would he possibie to orgasfee 9, system of light horse cars to run through tbe crowded eteeats of the city .within a very abort time — ft few veeke at most. For aU suburban Jjrafflo — &ox; instance, from Moors ^ark to fiandwidk end Ooog-ee j from Cieveland- street Jk- i3atany ( from ths Uni versity to iorest 3jodg-6, -3rlei3&, Sewtown, and Marrickvilfo, tbe ebaitm motors oould still be advantageously and properly employed; provided, of ooaree, that Legislative eanotioti can be obta*n«KL vnoer spc?i «-a-utaons it lie not pro bivble that, eo long &a; they ere not Introduced.

It ts supposed that £31 salt* way carriages am tvaggons bis fnrnlshed -with two couplings and two Side fog.fr™, . it has seemed good to somebody J» itnthorliy (hat bnly one of the former should be used,- though the reason does not appear very clearly to the unofiicialinind. At «tny rate &n; order to £ha£ eSect has been issued, and in consegnenoe wehave had thds acci dent, resulting in tSe loss of a life which might have bees saved $ it bad not been for tba officious meddling nt some person who oould not have known very well what he was doing. There CQold be no economy either of time at money involved. The double ooupllngs irore 6ien in t3ieir plaoes. To use both ?wonidBot require more than a minute of the shunter's time with each train, and it -would pot mate . a difference of ^1 per week on all our lines. The loss by wear and tear and breakages is positively greater where only one coupling ia used than where both are employed, since iheetrate being divided, neither is nor can be overtasked. The obvious answer to this is that either coupling is calculated to bear the utmost strain that can be put upon it. Per ifips .that is the -*.se when ths coupling is new, though It is qcjis easy fcp see that it may be worn thin, ©r stretched so much, that its tensile strength becomeB. in tame greatly impaired ; and Since po ene can tell bv mere inspection ? how much it has been iniurea, it follows that ootnmon sense would dictate that abundant margin of strength should be allowed in order to provide against the effept of injuries which cannot ba dictated by i&e; eye alone. Sow great a strain was pat on the coupling which broke at Esbank is shown by the fact that after the waggons had broken away from the engine, they descended the incline by their own weight, and soon, according to one of the witnesses, who ought to have been a good judge of pace, ao I quired a velocity of tO miles an hour, and the force -which actuated them had been acting on the coupling, while the train was ascending the incline. That one fact is enough to show that ?whatever may be. thought of the order with re spect to the coupling of trains running on the I level, nothing but the most outrageous folly and I ignorance could dictate its application to the steep inclines and .sharp curves on tbe mountains. Perhaps the Protean act-ingf-MiniEter for Works can, during the recess, find time to bring tbe offender to book. Zt has been said of the Count de Cnam bord that lie should have lived in the middle ages. The heir of St. Louis, with his' notions of Divine right, and strict devotion to the tradi tions of Hoyalty, has certainly been an anomolous personage, in this restless and sceptical apa. His exit from the stage on which he Has played so shadowy a part seems likely to take place under ciroumstances -which havmonfee -with his antecedents. The fierce light which in those days not only beats upon a throne, but jon every pro bable and possible occupant of one^has fallen at all times -with somewhat dimmed rays on him.. He has been a ghost-like figure in the world and yet out of it. This fact is attested by the contra dictory accounts which have, within tbe last week, been received with reference to the Oomte de Chambord. It was stated he we£ dyingj it was positively announced that he was dead 1 but now we learn that nothing is definitely known eus to whether he has succumbed to his illness or not. IE ft were not that miracles, at least of that Startling Irind whieh this information suggests, so longer find believers, one might imagine, from the mystery which at present would seem to .surround * Henri V.' was a pre iude to the announcement that he had, body and soul, vanished to that heaven for which even some pious Legitimists have confessed that Be was better fitted than for earth.
