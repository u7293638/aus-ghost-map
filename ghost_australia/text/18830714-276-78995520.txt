Tin; daughter of tho Lesbian king Within hor bower she watohed tho war, : Far off she heard tho arrows ring, ' The smitten harness ring afar; And, lighting from tho foromost oar, Saw one that smota where all must flee; More fair thiin tho Immortals tiro Ho seemed to fair Pialdic6! She saw, sha loved him, and her heart Before Aohilles, Peleus' son, Throw all its guavdod gates apart, A maiden fortress lightly won I And, oro that day of fight was done, No more of land or faith reeked sho, But joyed in hor now lifo begun, Her life of love, Pisidiefl; She took a gift into her hand, As one that had a boon to oravo; She stolo aorosa the ruined land Where lay tho doad without a grave, And to Achillas' hand she gavo Her gift, tho secrot postern's key. " To-morrow let me be thy slavo!" Moaned to her lovo Pisidicfi., Ere dawn tho Argives' olarion call Rang down Mothymna's burning street; They slow the sleeping warriors all, They drove the women to tho fleet, Save one, that to Aohilles' feet Clung, but, in sudden wrath, cried he: " For her no doom but doath is meet." Aud, there men stoned lJisidic6, In havens of that haunted ooast, Amid the myrtlos of the shore, Tho moon sees many a maiden ghost Love's outoast now and evermore, The silence hears tho shades dqploro Thoir hour of dear-bought lovo \ but tliee The waves lull, 'neath thino olives hoar, To dreamless rest, Pisidicfi I -Andrew Lang in the Century.
