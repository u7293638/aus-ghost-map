HOME TOPICS AND EVENTS. (FTiosi ought coRRESPONDENT.) LONDON, April 21. The Government may now be said to have completed the exposition of their Parliamentary) programme, at all events for the present session They promised at the general election to do something for the Church for the farmers, and for the Irish tenant We have had the education Bill and the Irish Land Bill, and now we have the Agricultural Rating Bill, which is the Ministerial contribution to a "'rise in there It proposes to give two millions a year in relief of local taxation, which is roughly equal lent to reducing the rates of agricultural land by one-half This sounds rather liberal, and as a matter of fact the proposal will not be t irria! though without fighting, for the Opposition are very hostile to the idea of giving preference to a single industry in matters of this land. The rates are heavy md in many respects inequitable in the country, but they are still worse in both respects in the towns, and it is naturally argued that if a change is to made at all the whole system in town and 'country alike should be overhauled But the only point of real interest is how far the Government proposal it will really meet the wants of the distressed agriculturists As a matter of fact, it will be a mere bagatelle A man who farms, say, a hundred acres will be the better off by about i Cr note supposing he really gets the money, and it does not go as some people think it will in the pockets of the landlord-but that will not say e him from bankruptcy with the seasons and the prices against him It is a mere mockery of his woes The plain fact is that in voting for the present Government there is no doubt that the bulk of them did the farmers genuinely believed that they were voting for a return to some by, stem of protection, and they are not quite disillusionised even jet But they hill born time, and thou their disappointment will be severe and then angel against the irresponsible politicians who misled them probably intense The death of Baron Hirsch has let loose a flood of gossip in regard to the famous Tow millionaire Many things have been raked up not altogether to his credit, while on the other hand there is abundant testimony to the fact that he possessed many good qualities Probably he was not much better or worse than the majority of men, though his dealings for good or evil naturally) attracted a vast amount of attention When a m in las 20 millions of money and spends his wealth as freely as Hirsch did it is very difficult to get at a true estimate of his character He has no really private life in which he call it in the friends snail ciently intimate to recognise any sterling qualities, and the people who surround him are almost inevitably either sycophants 01 detractors A contributor to one of the d all) newspapers records that he once heard a certain peer abuse Hirsch w after enjoying his hospitality and the best shooting that Europe could produce for a month " I daresay this was no uncommon incident I was once talking at a certain club in a group of members which included a person we oil known both in the political and social world, who shall be nameless Some reference was made to Hirsch " Hirsch is a dirty Jew," said the " celebrity " in question as he turned to go it And yet," observed a member of the group after he had gone, more in sorrow than in angel, " he has had a good many thousands out of him " If over a list should appear of the celebrated people who have had many thousands, and for that matter tens of thousands, out of the Barr n it would I fancy create a sensation There are certain leading figures in English society as an evil as Trench who would stand very near the top of it. As to the great schemes of shares) upon which Hirsch entered after the death of his only boy Lucien, in whom all his hopes were centred, there is no doubt that he threw himself heart and sold into them Plenty of correspondence exists to show how hard he w ordered to give effect to his great plans of Jewish colonisation, and how disappointed he was at his comparative failures His Now market reputation and the reputation he had among the friends, for instance, of the poor Bus Binn Jews, were two very different things In appearance the Baron had more the look of a smart military officer than of a Jew financier, and his ordinary habits Weare ascetic and a or regular For some time before his death he appears to have been not over happy) in his mind, and when he was last in London people spoke freely about his looking sick and worked A fortune like his is not altogether a Godsend The rush of new periodicals still continues, and the newspapers are now having an innings A new London morning newspaper has been established this week. It is a formidable enterprise, and one which has not been attempted for some years past, for the good reason that the earlier experiments showed that to attempt to enter into rivalry with the rise of six great penny) dailies which at present hold the held was sure to end in disaster But Sir George Newnes is a bold man as well as sell one, and his experiment is entirely on new lines, being really an attempt to popularise the gossip) evening journ it in the shape of a morning paper with the news boiled down into tit-bits " The late Mr I demand is as tired some thing of the kind in the Circle some years ago, but it did not succeed in a week or so Mr Harmsworth, of Answers and Arctic exploration fame, is to bring out a halfpenny dad) on original lines The two little morning halfpenny dailies which were far ted a year or two b took seem to be prospering fairly As to the monthlies and weeklies which have come into existence of 1 to their name is legion, and yet the majority of them live on There is every indication that of late years the reading public that is the public which reads the of fugitive a later stage of the book- stalls in this country, and especially in London has largely increased. The great improvement which has taken place in this class of literature both in letterpress and illustrations is no doubt partly the cause of this, while at the same time it is partly the effect It is evident that, for good or cv in people will decide that according to their own feelings the old spirit of Sabbath trains in this country is rapidly on the wane There was striking evidence of this in the overwhelming majority with which the House of Commons (a Conse- native of House of Commons, be it remembered) recently passed a resolution in favour of the Sunday opening of museums and picture galleries But there are many other sins of the times to which the least observant onlooker cannot shut his e) The new amusements which have come so greatly into vogue of late have had marked results in this respect " "Where is the harm in having a breath of fresh air on Sunday s'" argues the ardent golfers, quite careless the fact that golf is in its origin a Scotch game and one by one the golfing clubs have been opening their grounds for Sunday play " I go to church in the morning and take around in the afternoon," you will sometimes hear a player so) apologetically Then the bicycle has proved a disastrous invention as regards the strict observance of the Sabbath To begin with, it was the young men who had been shut up in offices all the week long who thought it a splendid thing to jump on their machines when the office closed on the Saturday afternoon, take a run down into the country or to the sea- side, spend a part of the Sunday there, and then ride or train it back again But society has always followed the example of the democracy in this bicycling craze, and fashionable people who have been playing hard all the week also find it necessary to get a few hours of air and exercise under similar conditions At one or two seaside w along places small scandals have arisen through the appearance in church of ladies and gentlemen in full bicycling costumes in one or two cases ladies have even been bold enough to show tlicmscliesinrition&ls; to the bewildered congie gition The latest development of auti-Sabba tarianism is a movement on the part of some of the members of a staid and formal West End club to get the billiard-room opened on a Sunday There are a good many clubs of good enough position in London, of course, in which you can play billiards on Sunday already, but they are all more or less tarred with the Bohemian brush, and in most cases they make this curious concession to old-fashioned ideas, that during the greater part of the day, at all events, the players must mark for themselves, so as not to involve the marker in their irregularities But perhaps most significant of all as to the range which is coming over us is the fact that a terrible storm is being raised in the Scotch press through the Sunday opening not only of golfing grounds but of bowling gi eyes In some places north of the Tweed Anyone who has ever experienced a true Scotch Sunday of the old-fashioned type will realise to the full what a revolution this implies A pleasantly scene turn has been given to club talk this week by an elaborate letter which has appeared in one of the morning newspapers from an Anglo Indian officer, giving in account of his experiences in a haunted house It differs entirely from ordinary communications of the kind in the fact that the writer does not want to dwell on the supernatural aspect of the matter, but is concerned with its practical and real bearings Hois desperately indigo it because he can get no redress from his landlord who let him a house w Inch he (the landlord) known to both stunted- is he had himself been di is an out of it by super- natural visitations in spite of dogs and loaded lovohers-svithout informing the would be tenant of the circumstances Consequently), the officer finds himself saddled with a house which cost him 200 a year on a five sets' case, but which he cannot live in because he can keep no servant and get no peace in the bosom of his family Die only offer he can get for his two and a quarter years' remaining lease is £100, and that mainly on account of the pasture land let he has no le dress, for the English lass takes no cognisance of ghosts I have been thinking that even at the end of this so called sceptical and business-like nineteenth century the haunted house must really have a serious commercial betting I think I could so without difficulty provide a list of 20 sued unclean able residences 1) mp merely t m different parts of the country and that must be a drop in the bucket of the total number which a comprehensive list would present Of course, it does not follow that all these houses, or as on the majority of them, are empty because they are haunted Probably, indeed, in most cases they have simply got the reputation of being haunted, began o they have been long in tenanted and are dark and windowless and woe begone The original cause of their becoming empty may have been bad drains, damp) walls, of sinking foundations But sooner or later is a house fails to get a tenant somebody is suretobogin to peir strange lights in the ss windows and heir an earthly) cares echoing through the rooms, and an) house rig-out will tell on that when one a house does get this reputation, it is despite all our supposed common sense- a desperately hard thing to not, even if it is done up as new" him thinking noss principally of country districts, but we are not altogether free from these superstitions in London There are some quarter s of the metropolis where the struggle for house room is so intense that a tenant could be found for a house event twice thronged from basement to attic with the most mischievous ghosts m creation But the haunted house is by no means unknown in the suburbs There is, or used to be, a large house which long had an evil reputation within a pistol shot of the Crystal Palace and I am not sure that there are not others mound which, through their being empty, sheep) legends are growing up I fancy when really put to it we are all a bit superstitious at bottom Let any man to) the experiment of sitting up alone in a so called haunted room some of us has of tried it from more bravado in our youths-and then say honestly whether he really liked it A friend of mine for practical reasons once did boldly keep vigil all night in a house belonging to himself which had been brought under suspicion through the gossip of the s ants of an outgoing tenant He had a loaded gun, a dog, and a bottle of whisky I asked him which he found the most useful " Oh, the whisky)," was the frank reply). It speaks well for Mr Henry Arthur Jones's capacity that people should be talking a good deal about his new play), "The Kogue's Coined) " at the Garrick There's not much of that originality about it which we ordinarily expect in Mr Jones's wife Mr Bailey) Prothero, the rogue, is not a villain of shooting) melodramatic type, but a charlatan of a sort which has become pretty familiar to readers of latter day novels He might be a sketch from life of the only scamp who played such pranks with the credulity of Mrs Brosyuing, and who was the object of Mich hearty detestation on the part of Robert Brown ing himself As I have said above, we are all of us a bit superstitious, but it is a peculiarity of these spiritualistic impostors when on meet them in real life that there is nothing even distantly us can) about them and that the only impression they create in a well-balanced mind is that a hot soils hip and the too of a stout boot sale at least among the things that ought to be constantly) di emit of in their philosophy) Mr Prothero us he appears upon the stage is it not) fair type of his class in his unotuouhuess, his self possession, and his readiness to turn every incident tonceount, though be has intellectual ills higher gifts than one generally associates with persons of his class His wife as he passes herself, oft is a spinster, lines attached herself to the amiable old Lid) Dosei green who might be almost t per train from life of a certain weak minded Lady Something 3 Lee, who is as at one time a wellknown society) patio ness of mediums and then associates-and worms out family secrets which Mr Bailey Prothero is afterwards able by his mystical power to reveal to the circle of astonished dupes around him But there is one person with whom he is brought in contact whom he cannot take in, and this is Mr George Lambert, a young and using barrister, who is determined to unmask the swindler He knows all about Prothero except one small detail, and that is that the impostor is his own father Lambert has been brought up from childhood by an aunt, and has never been allowed to know in) thing of his parentage The inevitable moment arrives when the swindlers career is at an end and then comes the question as to how he will treat the s m who his done so much to bring about the crash Let him declare his real ition ship and the boy's prospects of a brilliant career and a happy marriage me it an end But calling together all that is best in him he banishes the idea of revenge, and goes away into obscurity) with his secret unrove lied It is Mr Jones's object in this play, as in me in) others to the li is written, to show that there may be good in things as it and this is a lesson which the average theatrical audience is in ver tired of seeing enforced So that, in spite of a certain want of freshness, rather unusual in the author s work, the price has been very us all licenses so far
