OUR ORBOST LETTER. (FIROM OUR OWN CORRESrPOsNDENT.) Il onday, April 5. For some time past we have been ex pecting a visit from Messrs Robertson and Stephens, missionaries in connection with the Victorian Evangelisatioan Society, and yesterday Ir lRobertson preached in the Church of England. The lessons and prayers of the church were read by the Rev. Thos. liaglin, Mr Robertson's text ans Acts 19, v. 2-" Have ye received the Holy Ghost since ye believed." It was a powerful address, and was listened to with great attention. In1 tile afternoon MIr Robertson addressed the children of the Sunday schools, and matde his dis course very instructive. Ini the eveningl a united service was held in the mechanics' institute. ilr Stephens, who had been suffering from a cold, managed to assist his colleague at the evening service, IMr Stephens, who possesses a fine tenor voice, carried the large audience with him. There is nothilng new to report in con nection with the alleged find of gold at Mount Ellery. The maize crops here are ripening fast, the weather being deliglitful for somle time past, and within a fortnight picking will be in full swing. Lots of Nmaie pickers are already coming. I hear the farmers will offer 4d to 4jd per bag. The crops in some places are not so good as was ex pected. Some will yield over 80 bushels to the acre, which is considered very fair.
