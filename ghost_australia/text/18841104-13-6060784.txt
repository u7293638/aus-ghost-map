THE VICTORIA RIFLE ASSOCIA- TIONS PROGRAMME. TO THE EDITOR OF THE ARGUS. Sir-Allow Victorian little Association have just issued their sheet programme for the annual meeting in December next, and I venture to assert that they have never offered the riflemen of Victoria a more lin satisfactory bill of fare The encouragement shown to rifle clubs w practically and in a list of 20 matches there are only three open to members of rifle clubs It was I supposed, in view of the letters which have from time to time appeared in your columns, and the enthusiasm displayed in the remote parts of t lit colony with regard to the rifle club movement, that the V ¿H.A would do all that in them lay to encourage such a patriotic and useful adjunct to the local forces With the exception of the "Open Club,' "All Comers," and "Queen s Prue" matches, the list is a weary reiteration of open to elective e members of the | naval and military forces of Victoria." I can not believe that the Government, in granting a the liberal subsidy of £1,000 to the association, had any idea that it would be distri- outen in tins one such an inner one result of this will advised action will probably be the formation of a Civilian Rifle Club Association which will claim next year an equal share of the Government grant, and make the encouragement of rifle shooting its especial care it is admitted on all sides that the clubs far outnumber the militia and they certainly show a larger percentage of active Shooting, men Under these urcumattincca is it fair they should be treated in this manner I The men have shown their friends beyond cavil by purchasing their own rifles and erection" butts in all j arts of the colony more especially in the district surrounding Ham in ton and they are all but excluded from the great test matches of the year in both the militia and rifle clubs agree in denouncing, the sudden and unexpected action of the VRA council in making forward position compulsory in nearly all the matches Leaving, the merits and demerits of the rival positions altogether on one side it seems grossly unfair on the part of the council to alter the conditions which have obtained for Bomanyytara at a short month b notice the Queen a prize and all the principal events on the hat appear to me to be at the mercy of the few forward position allots who rule the roast. At all events it is generally admitted that the unfortunate ' back position shots (who by-the-bye are in a majority of three to one at least) have not the ghost of a show If the council had Ewen one years notice of this radical change or had they been elected by the members of the association on this special point no exception could be taken to their action As it is the disease is fervent and widespread. -I am, c, WALTER, G.
