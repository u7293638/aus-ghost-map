A faint smile' playetl over the features of thevdying man. 'You -were always generous,' he mur mured. ' Time has not changed you. But you shall not lose for, your mercy. Here,' said he, ixhrus'ting his 'band into a pocket in his .shirfcj.and drawing therefrom a Bmall copper box. Here is a recompense for. your kindness. Ii wiH. reward .yon. for all the grief you have sustained on my acconnt. 'What is it, Crpzet ?' I asked, wondering what so sn^»ll,^nd:£i-- com.moji looking a box couldjcontain^ .'A chart,' was the answer. * A chart of what?' 'PI -an island ion which* treasure is con-, cealed, ail of which may be yours for the goii^ tbiifcer.' ' .What islaaid ?M Asked. ' Christmas,' was the response. This was the last word he uttered. As he spoke a, sea broke over ihe raft and nearly drowned him. As it subsided he came to a little, -bui his vojce bad gjone. He tried to epeajc, but in vain ; a rambling sound was all he could, articulate. Death, too, iad got a fefmer grasp upon him. The last struggle rapidly approached ; his end could not long be delayed. I had nott n'ng more to do on the raft, so hailing the boat to draw nearer, swam to her and got on. board. I satisfied the in quiiiespf the men by paying that of three , unfortunates on the mft, two were already dead .when I 'reached fit, and 'the third died before I came away. xAsfor.the nameof the thifd, I deemed it prudent to keep that secret; so cjn thjs and on the -!box Crozet gave me I presented a steadfast f silence. Qur master was iiadeed sorry when be learned the fate of the .three persons, for ne hoped fx- save one at least, but as Providence wiljed otherwise, he had but to submit, and stand again upon his appointed conrse. After thisVWe; met with nothing but the usual adventures of an ordinary passage, and came to anchor, without mishap, in the har bors. ^jf- iGaseenock. ' In the meantime I «amined the contents of the box. The -)ox itself was of copper, about the size of a tobacco: box, opening with a spring. It held nothing but a piece of parchment, on ?which was a drawing in ink of the place where the treasure was buried. Ii.was a small bay, or bight, on the north west coast of Christmas Island,' very care fully &i;& down, tjbte bearings 4aken by compass, and still farther, assured -by copi ous: sailing ' directions, Christmas Island, as you. are aware, is al lonely island ?Sn the North. Pacific,, lying , just above the Equator, and almost equi-distant be tween the one htaidred and fiftieth and! one hundred and sixtieth parallels of latitude. On this island a treasure, as I learned from abrief notice on the chart, had been buried by a- gang of mutineers, who bad ran oft with a Portuguese merchantman on .her voyage from Acapnlco to Canton ; but chased by an: English man-of-war, bad to scad for their lives, and at last stranded on Christmas Island, where they buried the treasure. After tltey had placed the treasure, which amounted to a ' HUMJRtfD AND SIXTY thousand pound^. in a pit which they dug in the middle of a savanna, they went away 4fe the ship's boats, intending to fetch . Honobila; but their voyage was oth£r4nfie Ordamfcd. A gale sprang up, the longboat swampejd, and all in her perished; the, launch fared i little bette^j she outlived the tempest, but the winds proving contrary shct was Jtept so long at eea that most of her men died from hftnger^ nay, all would bave perished, had they not chanced to fall in with, an American whaler on'he^ course to the South-: Seas. On this ship, five, all that remained alive, were taken. Of these, three died afterward ; thus, the secret of the trea sure was-confined to, two men. One of these mea'J cnanced to meet With an accident^ which laid him up, and in the end proved fatal. \Before he dfed he told Crozet, who had been! kind to' 'him, and Was a mate on the jship, jbbe-Whole story, and to confirm it, showed him the chart, which he said he had secretly taken from the- mutinous captain as he lay dying ixt- ^hVlarmefcr He, trioreover, presented' Cjsjjset with the chart a& a return for Bis attentions, and after some further conversation on* the subject, drew himself together- a»d. yaeldfed up £h- ghost.

I tooki≫&^j at the Isthmus House, andtherefell inKpith a Dutchman who had just aKtived irom the mines. His name, was Decker. ^He was a very civil man, alii adventurer, and a sailor by occupation. pDffwas formerly mpLster i-f a galliot, running. from Holland to England, and was accounted - -an able. joavigator.: With this^man I formed la, friendship ;'we exchanged histories,- spntt'yarns, and made ourselves otherwise soisiable. One night, under the stimulating effects of whisky, of. which we had drank more than ^ordinary, I. told him the story pi the tzeas'one on {JmtisiMis isCAift) He heard me witfi rapt attention, and when I -concluded, said, in -his broken En glish: - : ' - ' Veil, by dunder, dat ish ^, strange story. But I say, mine- friend,- -have you .got a., chart? Mitout dat, one can do noting.1 ' I have,' I answered. 'Und vere ish it.?' he asked 5 'I vould Kke to see it if you hare-So-efe^jeetioH. - May be we might arrange some biziness.' '.It is up stairSfin lay'trunkj come along/ and I'll show it to you/ ? ; ' All right,' he replied, and we went up to my room. . : ? I there showed him the chart; he ex amined it attentively. After he had satisfied himself that it was.eorrecc, he said — 'Tell, Mishter, I wffl-seeyouiiO- TnoiTdw-' about -dish ', may -be, -if you -like, we -can arrange some biznees.' - * I wisb. wo ceuld, Decker,' I replied, ' I would make the conditions-easy.' 'I vill see/ he answered, and with a friendly ' good iiight,' went -away. The next morning we met. *Yell,- Mishter,' he said, 'I have been dinMng over dat matter, and all vat I nave to say is dish, I am in for it.' : 'Ha!' 'Yes; but I believe you .got very leetle money.' ' Very little. If ships were selling at sir pence apiece 1 couldn't buy a gang- plank.' He smiled. - ' Veil, I have got more, and I vill tell you vat I propose; ve vill go shares. If I find de means to fit a ship to go after de treasure, I am to have one half; and you, in consider ation of your chart, shall have de oder half ; now, liow does dat suit you ?' ' Nothing could be better.' 'Very vel; den ve fix de papers right avay. Ve moost have everyting square; for bizness is bizness.' I concurred^n the wisdom' of the obser vation. He immediately went to an attor ney and had him draw n.p an agreement, to which we affixed our signatures and then set about our venturej being resolved tb push it forward with all the energy we could command. It would be tedious to describe all the details of our fitting out. We, however, found a foretopsail schooner of a hundred tons convenient for our purpose. We char tered her for a year, put two guns and a dozen small arms aboard, find afterward took in a crew of five men, mostly Dutch men, and acquaintances of Decker s. It was no easy matter to get the right set of men for a venture of this kind, but, as it proved, we were well favored, for a better set of fellows never went a troving for trea sure. To be brief, we got under way, and about dusk left the Heads down on the borizon. We had a fair run jnost of tthe passage, though the trades were greatly in our disfavor! Mo mishap, however, oc curred, and at length, getting into the longitude of 203deg 15min east, we began to look about for the appearance of land. Soon after daybreak we saw a low coast under our bows, and the chart being consulted, made it Christmas Island, the goal of our -expectations. We at once stood toward itr and following tne directions in Grozet V chart, sailed into a little bend or harbor, wilts© we anchored in still water. We lost no time, as yon may suppose, in getting a ix-at out and proceeding ashore, taking each implements as we needed. . jThis island, lies flat, is about twenty leagues in circumference, 'and, though originally barren, is- now ^covered with a multitude of cocoanut trees,, .sprung from' seeds planted by Captain Cook, its dis coverer. On tne shore we found large quantities of turtle, very welcome to us after so much salt provision. But .we -had other things than turtle *o think bf.j We were more intent on finding'the treas Sure which had caused us to come hither. According to the -chart'it lay in*, savanna, surrounded by hills, andabottt*iHH'th--eastof the wreck, which wassteHided en theieach. We found the . WT«ei^ *r. iai^er what re mained of it ; -.for U, 'Mp^*^jj v^eft jbeaten to pieces, oi^y^aiewribiinow remaining to show its situation.- Tbese, however, were sufficient for onr purpose. ^Te. iBtnick & line from them, andfollowingthe^ejarings of theclikrt, after nineh difeulty fixed upon the spot loarked ^^e burial place^of%he treasure.

Thesei nowever,' were small losses, richly repaid by the treasure we had securedi llair wi»ds bore us rapidly to our destination. W£ made the ?Heads at noon, and late in the evening came to anchor, having been three: months and twenty-two days absent, carry ing out in as full manner as we could wish the intention of onr voyage. , . Tie jest of? iny story ; is soon told. The .money wjasj equally divided between Decker and myself, after which weiallowed -the jnen-wbo/went. with us one nundred pounds a piece, in' addition to their wages, for which they were both surprised ? and grateful. After the division of property, Decker left for Holland, married ft -domestic woman, and is -now -a wealthy and flourishing farmer. My bistory you know. ' Sure as shooting. Ids ten, ; I'll tell you a queer story. Black Jack— Migdol's Ghostit Stobt. * Queer yarn, boatswain.' 'Yes, Ned had a strange experience.' ' What became of his money f * Hom^piped away, sailor- like. He was a good man, something like Buckra.' 'The cook?' 'Yes.' 'He saved our lives.' ' He did ; I know Buckra, in the Binnacle. He was related to Blacs: Jack.' 'Who was he?' ' A negro, wbose ghost haunts the Island of Desolation.' 'Belay!' 'Onr brig Was beating against a 'snorting ndr'wester that belelus off the isle of . Deso lation, when an event happened that exT erted an extraordinary influence upon our voyage, and in which I could only see the workings of a mysterious Providence. We had a black man from the coast of Guinea J a verv increnions fellow, inn. hnh sir sullen «s a bull-dog, and continually in hot water with the men. This negro cnanced to have an altercation with the carpenter a few days before we made the island, in which, after a dozen blows, the colored man, 'Black Jack ' as we called him, so completely worried his antagonist that he was fain tb cry for quarter. The carpenter, Tcta Spokes, was a lusty fellow; in the habit of boasting of his ppwess,' there fore tbe defeat be suffered eut frim to the quick, and being of a vindictive nature, he resolved to 'get even ' with his duBky opponent. He, bowever, had sense enough to keep silent, and -whatever bis -thoughts were they found no vent, for he appeared unconcerned, and performed his duties with his usual activity. The second day after the affray between the negro and carpenter, and when, the gloomy shores of the Isle -of Desolation were looming on the horizon,, a storm sprang up which compelled us to shorten sail With the utmost expedition. All hands obeyed the summons of. the master, among whom of of course Were tbe negro and^iarpenter, who hurrying aloft laid but on the lee arm of the foretopsail yard. It was a singular fate that brought those two men in so perilous a situation, and so close together on that stormy * night. Hate rankled in their bosoms. The negro, confident of his power, despised as much as lie disliked the carpen ter, wbile the latter, thirsting for Teiigeance, only awaited a favorable opportunity for its consummation. In thiBconditujn these two men found themselves, on a sMvermgyaird, with a tempest beating round thenv amid a darkness almost thick enough tb bile the flashes from their eyeballs; The confusion on deck Was at its height, Wnen a stifled cry came from the foreyard-arm, at the same moment a discbarge of lightning issued from a cloud overhead. Tie -cry was sir singular, and as it sounded to me, so un earthly. I involuntarily looked np, and saw the Tiegro and carpenterengaged In * strug- : gle. 1 bad bat time to see this ere the flash vanished, iand all was again veiled in dark^ nesa.
