Leprosy. — — — — - . In the Norern Territory. Fully a Hundred Cases. The opinion jyhich we have so frequently expressed as fo the existence of leprqey among tbe blacks of tlip Alligator. River district, 6ys tbe Northern Territory Times of December 31, has at last been verified beyond the ghost of a doubt. An ahoriginal native of t hat dis trict who came into Palmerston on Safur. day qst at the suggestion of Mr P. Qahill (who was bvjffalo hunting for a couple of years at the Alligators) has beeu ex. amined by Dr. O'Flaherty and found to be suffering from true leprosy. Mr Cahjll bad a shrewd suspicion that the man waa a leper, and by judicious dooait managed to entice him to come here to be "cured" by the doctor. After the medical officer had satisfied himself as to the nature of the disease the native was conveyed across to the leper camp to break the monotony and lonesomeness of the solitary China man's existence there. It is par; poramoh gossip that when the Government Resi- dent's party ' was at the Alligator River recently Mr Cahill pointed out several natives who bore oht-ward and visible signs of leprosy more or less advanced in itB terrible progress, and it id expeot'ed that the' Resident'e' next report -will contain references to tbe Matter. It i's the belief Of !Mr Ctihiir and others welf acquainted with the blacks of the Alligator District that' a 'hundred at jeaSt eohld be' fotind suffering ffom leprosy' developed 'fo siih an"ext'ent that there cfiqUfco no mistaking it— Iu sbme 'cases' more' prbnon'cc'ed 'than ihe "'poor ! wretch "vrli'o has just" bee'i. tfansportfe to the'le|ler oamp.
