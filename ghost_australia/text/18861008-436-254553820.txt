A FANATICAL SECT. In Cincinnati there is a party of thirty or forty people, most of them prominent in society and above the average in intelligence, who believe that a Mrs. John B. Martin, of Walnut Hills, is Christ manifest in the flesh, and her sister, Mrs. John F. Brooks, is the Holy Ghost. The followers of these two women meet in a house and worship them both. Mrs. Martin has exerted some influence that has put them completely in her power, and they are fanatic on the subject. One of the woman's followers is named Jerome. He was a bookkeeper. He gave up his position to serve her. To a reporter who saw Jerome he said: " I have seen God face to face in the last half-hour." A young man named Cook, who works in Â° the Auditor's Office, resigned his position, and has attached himself to the new sect. This movement has been going on quietly for a year without becoming generally known. The women seclude themselves, and will not be seen by anyone who is not a worshipper or vouched for by one of them. Many persons have sold their homes and taken houses near where the women live on the hill. Those who have given up their positions say they do not need work or money; all they need is, spiritual food, and this will be furnished as to the Israelites in the wilderness. A Miss Andrews is almost insane from excitement, and passes her whole time in weeping, singing, and praying. Among the other worshippers of these new gods are some of the best people in Cincinnati. Exposure to public ridicule, it is thought, will bring them to their senses.
