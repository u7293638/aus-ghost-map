FUROR POETICUS. To Julia. Ah, J alia ! sad my thoughts of thee— JNTot now, but as thou used to be, When youth had blush'd upon thy cheek, And love from eyes to eyes did speak— That love still slumbers now in mine, But does it so still dream in thine ? Ah, Julia ! Grief is mine to-night— The grief that trembles on a sorrow's height, Where brooding anguish hatches hate, Whose first hiss is—" Too late ! too late!" Too sad is love for mocking life— 'Tis but the dead who 'scape the knife Of fate—of circumstance and fate— That carves upon the heart " Too late." Ah, gods of gloom ! if love should die, E'en hell itself would sobbing sigh " Too late! too late." High heaven stern Would tremble 5 white-clad ghosts would learn To drape in black ; the birds all hush'd, And blanch'd the roses that had blush'd. But love still lives—in Julia's eyes It lights and sparkles like sunrise. WURLIE. Adelaide, May 16, ISiH.
