I TUE SHIFTING SCENE. I AN IMPOSSIBLE IDYLL. (By WAMIIA.) It had been a blazing hot day, and it was a warm, still night at Sunken Point The water heaved lazily against the return rafters of the halves lb it seemed to fall sheer from the dingy) streets into the diet waters of the harbour, and a worm haze hung about the unpidiirisqin collection of m into stores and small shops that stood in the foreground At a point from fur down the harbour the flashlight light from the Light- house sprung up even now and then, and the red eye of a steamer stared out from the end of a neighbouring pier, conveying a certain steadfastness to the general silence which the qu door of the home surroundings would not have suggested The air about Crime street was full of half sound the drowsy murmur of the sea against the realises the jetties, the distant moan of a haw sor straining against a buoy, the regular blasphemy of a knot of sailors and long shoremen standing about the miners from the interior of the Spirited Star, wineshop came the sounds of

take up its heroine at blushing 17 and leave her a beaming bride, in the last chapter, at 21, and perhaps this is why Kate Connell), under the most unlikely conditions, got her small gleam of romance How she had originally drifted there no one knew why who stayed there seemed perfectly plain to the regular and casual frequenters of the Spangled Star At any rate, no one had ever questioned her on the subject, nor suggested that the surroundings were unsuitable On the com for), the) looked upon her as an indispensable fixture of the place Sailors and men from the wharfs, and the rough miscellaneous patrons of the shop, greeted her familial) as Kate, and for each one she had his Christian name and a kind) answer for his heavy gallantry and coarse jest And then when who passed into the inner room, with her tray full of (hoses of butter, stopping at the smudgy little tables to give the drinkers their orders, ^ she was as free and bold as the boldest of China The Dutch skipper,

to be the experience of Kate Connell) On the night of which I speak when the wititbnckto her station behind the counter in the front shop there was no stereotyped lately in her fire Her heavy eyes

Kate first of all regarded Olaf Olufson as " a good mark " Perhaps I heard this from Maggie, the girl that it does not matter It seems that this young Swede lurched into the Spangled Star one night,
