A TALE OF THE GREAT FAMINE. By Henry Fielding. For six months there has been no rain. For six months, day after day and day after day, the sun has risen and run his course and set, with never cloud to hinder him. The sky used to be blue, but it Is so no longer ; as the air grew more and more dry, tfM blue faded from out the heavens and they have turned into a dull gray. Long after It rises, and long before it sets, the tun became* a great crimson eye glaring angrily at ■the earth that is wrapped in base. All the distance is hidden in this gray haw, m that you cannot see for more than half-a mile. The earth i* bare and brown, not a blade of grass upon the ground, not a leaf upon the trees. What the cattle grase on no one can imagine, probably not even the cattle themselves, for they are become piti fully thin. When they come home in the evening* they raise along the road a cloud W dust that does not fall for hours, but hangs in the hot, dusty air like a pall. The earth aches for rain. -Tfee villages are half-deserted. There vesaain in them but a few, who take care of the children and very old folk, tend the cattle, and tap the toddy-palm, which yields •onto small return of Juice even in this drought. The rest of the people are gone elsewhere seeking work. Some are in bower Burma, where the rich harvest has given them employment; many are in the famine-camps, working all day to earn a famine- wage—anything to tide them along till the rain comes.  For this is the year of the Great Famine. Never before bad Upper Burma known such trouble *b tots ; never to tbe history of tbe country baa it been distressed as it is »ow. Whole village* are depopulated, and Uttee Who have h»t their all in the drought m*y be counted by many thousands. So Create is One dhrtio—, so widespread tiie ofttamtty. that its extent holds ua>. The broad faota, tbe number, the figures appeal to us ; we lose, our sense of detail, and view only the <uas*. Our feeling of todividusi sytn iMfliy become* blunted. If « calamity befall one or two, or a dosen, we like to examlno into the case, to learn the particulars, to uatteiwDand the detail* ; when whole district* are suffering we very quickly forget die ia dtitthial in tibe community. Our power of osnipfSMßion, of understanding, is Mmlted, and we soon become weary. Moreover, It seems to us that there is a great wmenee* about tftie individual case*. ittter we have leanrt a few, and find the story much the *ain*,—•eaaty rains year after year, tIU the famlHy has lost all super fluities and retain* Just enough to get on w?Jh : on the top of these year* the great famine, all crops dead, heavy det* to money lenders, ptou«fc-<wtitfle sold for haiK their wortth ; in Che end destitution and misery— the dale becomes monotonous. It is rarely dramaotc, only miserable, sordid, pitiful ; and so we love our interest, and the famine becomes to us a mere question of economic*. But every now and then, breaking through fhe sameness of the misery, there comes a trfcgedy wfekn 1b apart, a tragedy which is of the famine, and yet not of It ; a story subose cause is tbe same as that of the others, but which is very different from Miem Such Is this story which lam about to tell. It happened but recently, the end ■ran but a few days ago. The two men who were tbe actors In this tragedy lived in a vfHage far inland from ' she great river, lying in a small valley. It was but a small village, of people, Mving niton the fruit ot their fields round afcouft: doing but moderately, even In gool seasons. There were stretches of rice floftds behind the village, and When the mOhb were good Obese ooirid all be cultivated and gave good returns. But in ordinary years there was not euough water for them, and the cultivators were dependant upon millet and cotton crops grown on the trigger ground. Thes* staples require but little rwin, and a crop can usually be obtained from them. ' The two young men wer« cousins. They were much -of an age, and they had lived together in. the village all their live*. Th*y were 00-heUrs, indeed, in the some piece of land, and they worked it. together, sharing the expense and tho work of dividing the crop* ttoerefrora. It ted been the property of their common grandfather. He had pos sessed a good deal of land in the village, and many palms ; bt»t he ted many descend ants, and oa his death the property was 'broken up and divided among the heirs. A council was. held,.and it was agreed that one should take this field, and one that, men usually obtaining arable land, and women the palm trees. Thus, included in this property was one of the bern fields in the village. Tfee coil wa« red and rich, and tt lay in a hollow, so that the waifltittge from the nrtghfcouring fields enriched it year by year. The crops of millot thai tt could produce were famous. Notwithstanding this, when the property came to^ be divided, there was a reluctance on the part of any of the "heirs to -take this field as his share. Although of all the pro perty It was the *e#t, yet whea it Was sug gMtedtotfcls os» or to that to take 4fee field, he altars rsfosed. flor-ia fact X had a bajl reprtjstte*. KriMlW It was htumiea «r not no one «e<6d say. put H was unlucky ; it had a bad iaiueoce, .not only liporilU pqtrsesaors, tmt uaoa any man win* crpsaed, it. 'As you sell foot upon it, said the villagers, your mind became crooked ; you began to think wicked thoughts, to imagine crimes ; it was as if something evil whispered in your ear as you went. Terrible tales were told of how those who often oi»?fted it, more espe cially thoseWrho worked It. became depraved, subject to sudden impulses to crjme, lost to alj sense of, right. .., For years before the death of the ojd nkn it had not been culti vated at all. . .(No one would set foot on, it, even for the sake o^. the certain profit, and it lay fallow. Thus, at. the council of dccl: slon the land went » Jbegg4ug. No. one would take it ; men shook heads when it wai mentioned, sad women' shrieked. At last It wm suggested that the /two young men should take it. A* everyone else had re fused ft, either they must iake it or. fertile a* it w*», R mtuit be left to, lap**' into •Draft. 'AM «o the young mea. after oon sujiatioa, agreed te take it, Tke.y were young, and were not afraid. They laughed ■ml the tales, and the land wag ia value far fceyend what they cpuVd hare expected for tbeir share ; 4fe*)r W^sl^Jbf; set up for lite. 80 they laughed and accepted. The VHlage shook its head when It heard, toft the young men only laughed. They were not to be frightened *y a superstition, «hey said ; »t was good land, and. they would work H. And so they did, not dividing,it, as I have said, but working It in common. And for two or three years' tiher did well. Then they both Yell in k»ve wrth the same girl. Ljove-aaktng here in a Burmese village is not very different from What it is anywhere else, I think. Only perhaps their loves are a Kttle hotter, the hearts of the young fojk more impatient. They wooed, these two men, ttoey wooed as other men woo. ' They went at night to can upon tbe parents and to see the girl, and they brought her pre sents, and they talked to her as young men do. They sang songs, too, little love-song*, hiding under a tree near, that sbe might hear and understand. And tbe tirl lis tened. She was a girl like other village girts, round-faced and quiet, with tptt brown eyes, ant) generally very busy over household affairs. She liked to be wooed, as girls do, and she seemed in no hurry to end the pleas ant days of courtship. For over '• year it went on, the two lads coming sometime* alone, sometimes together, to make lore to tbe girl, and yet she/gave no sign which of tbe two she would take. And the villagers shook their heads. "It is the land," they sard. "You see that land, how unlucky k is. This is tie htgliurink of H ; the two owners fall in love with one »irl: more trouble will come." (And th« boys were troubled, sure enough. It is wearing on your temper and forbear ance w*hen you are striving for the love of a girl, and your friend strives too, and the gtrl will not decide. The lads did not quar rel, but H was easy to see thai tbe strain was becoming toe hard tor them. And" then they did ttee wisest thing they could do. They felt that the state of affair* was becoming unbearable, and Obey deter mined to end It. They went to the girl's parents, and told them. " Both of us," they aaM, " love your daughter ; but whether she loves either of us, or which of us, we cmn not tell. When we try to ask her, she ia silent, or gire* a reply that is no reply* And* so we are getting to hat* each other, and we are very unhappy. W« wish you to teal us wbleh of us you win take for a son-in-law ; that will end it." Then was there great discussion In the house of the girls parent*. She was called in, and asked Which of tbe two she liked best ; and stoe said that atoe did not know. She liked them both. She did not want to marry yet. And she was alraM of the Held, she ssad ;it was very unlucky. How could sbe marry a husband who owned such a pleoe off. land ? Why did her parenti trouble her to answer ? But her parent* would not listen to her evasions. The boys had wooed her for a year, and slie must make of her mind. Her tehfavlour was not Chat of a good girl. As to tbe land, tbe tales aJbout H were rubbish. It was a rich pteoe of land. In these bad years, that was a serious constdemtton. To deprive yourself of a good husband and a good in heritance because of a sttty story would be absurd. Thus the girl was told to make up her mind ; and sbe dtd as afhe was bid, and chose the elder of the two cousins. So he was «enft for by tbe girl's mother, and told of his good luck, and he was happy. But tbe other went away. He did not feel any ttl-will, he said, but he was sick at heart. He could ndt bear to see toe girl marry anyone but him. He would go and ttve at bis uncle's house In a Aetgbbouring tHtege. And he did «% All this happened Just at the commeuoe merit of ithe rains, Trtun everyone is hard at work. Therefore it "vras arranged that the marriage should not take place yet. There was much work to do ; it was -not a time for honeymooning; after the crops were gathered In and sold, and money was plentiful, would be a better time. So the lover worked at his field. We worked it all alone this year, his cousin having gone away. It was agreed that he was to pay a certain proportion of the crop as rent for bis cousin's share. The early rains were not good, but still the seed was sown and sprouted.and if later rain came the prospects would not be so bad. But it was the year of the Great Famine. The later rain never came. The sun shone and shone and shone, all through the rain-months of July and August and September. Never a shower came, and the villagers watched in despair while.their crops died around them. The village was ruined. By October all hope of rain had gone, and with it all hopes or being able to marry and settle down for the young couple. The crops had failed ; food was short in the Village, and would grow shorter yet : no one coutd tell how they would be able to live till next crop. This was no time for marriage. And then one day the young map,came to a resolve. On an evening when the sun had set at last and the opt dark night had come, when toe cattle had wearily moved homeward from the brown fields, and the choking smoke hung over the village, he came to see \be dfl. She was in the veranda of Jter.-hemae as, he .came in. **d there-to-is* ttark he told her of what fee had resolved. • ■ ■ . • - - . - . ■ <, . J' The -crop .ha* foiled," ** saW : " the oroo has all failed, , ( I.have been in thej^jd to-day .an* tkene, wiU -**» aotWng>£oo[y. f little food lor cattle will I get oft &}>s&& And I have no money now, all is £o%^"Thcr9 are-my plough-cattle, but if J -»«U <^em what shall I do-next year ?., l.^Ao'frfo /* have made up my mind. rVMf 1 n *&' stay hem- but will go away to'-ilfe&wcr; country, and reap the crops therertfttMHut tend wfeere rain n«ver falls, I BW%jrV; good wages ; thus I shall save my clWij*^ and next year there will be rain again, aod we ahaM do. well." The. girl listened in silence. She listened to what he.r lover said, and the tears easne into her ryos, and she cried, " You -srill go," she said Lhfougli her tears, "you will go far away to that country that I do not know ; and who can say if yon will ever come back agatn V And,- al ihoujgh the young man tried to comfort her, yef tha «irl would not toe eomtortel. "We wef« to (be married," she said, "«** now you will go away, acid I sfcidl. never -see rou acain." " I wiH come back," sa4« Mm !a4;^'l will surely- came "back. B«r a* many Aw go. aiw*- retarn every rear ? There is *» fear. And when I return we wraly fie marrtett." ' ' ' w But the1 girl would not be comforted. "•^No, no J" she said; "it is tbart field. You «<?« now that they were rigfet when they saM it was "bad luck to take it. It has separated your cousin and you, and now. because it will not give any crap, it M separating you and me. And you will never return again, never." 80 at last, t>csu«e the giri would not let htm go. he said that ho would ma;ry kor first. Th*y should toe married at onoe, he said, to-morrow, and then after that he must «© away. " For I must go," lie said. "or what are we to cat ? I have nothing, and my people have nothing either; nowhere in the village is there any food. I murt 10 ; "but we will be mar. rled. and .then, when I am away, I will eend to my wife my earnings from below to help her father «od her mocher, and all will so well. If I stay here, we shall starve." \- And so, as bo better aright be. the girl consented. They w«re married very luietly, m is the Burmese custom, m quietly tfeat hardly anyone knew, and for one short w«ek they lived their marrlod IM* together. It was as a dream rhat week, a dream that was hardly a reality ; a we k of love and tenderness, of wonder and de light, and over it all hung the dread of a great tsar, Ityie the gray base that hung orer the earth. Then the young husband wept away, . ..Were, are no posts in these little vil lage* far away in the interior ; there are so postameo. to bring letters, and news comes but rarely. Once, three mon*h3 after be had left, the wife received news of her husband; another villager had met him down in the lower country, and brought her a message from him, and some thing more than a message. Ht had done well there ;he bad made money, doing down Vefore the rush from the famine districts occurred, he had secured work at onoe ; and. as pay was good, he had se cured much money, which be now sent to his wife. "(Here are fifty rupees," said the messenger, putting the money on tAe mat; " and (here is a IHtle line from him which he wrote." It was but a lftt!e line, for though indeed the lad could write, H waf not very well. And this was it : " From the husbawd io the wife. I have done well. I'send you money. In three month* more 2 "win return." It was scrawled on a little piece of white paper, and -the girl put it in her bosom and kept it there. Aad so the thne Treat on, an* the country grew more and more ■dry, %nd the famine •ettled upon the land. Those -who were poor before wcfre now starring ; those who had beett rich were now poor. Only by the care of Government, and the marvellous cbarlty of tbe people to each other, was it that the country was not sown with corpses. Plough-cattle were sold to any who would buy. What if there be no cattle to work with next year ? One must live now, they said. So three months more passed away. And then there came to the young wife more news of her husband. He was returning ; a man had met him and had brought from him a message to say that he would return soon. Ills money, for he had more money, he would bring with him. The girl was to expect him in a week, such was the mes sage. "But the young wife's heart was full of dread. She could not shake off the be lief, the certainty that trouble was about to befall. Was not the land still there ? Could there be luck with that ? And so she went about still with sad face and her eyes full of tears ; and the people wandered. It was just after sunset, but not .dark yet, for a dull gray light «till hung orer the earth. There were no clouds, but the sky could hardly be seen except Just over head. The distanoe was all hidden in dust and gloom that pressed upon the earth tik« the shadow of a great despair. The Holds were brown and bare and the trees lifeless, lifting dead arm* to a dead slur. In th« weßj,- the evening star was become a dim crimson point. A feverish wind blew in termittently across the wasted land, bringing with it pillars of revolving dust and, dead leaves. The wind was hot to the tone**, and made one shiver ; but when it stopped all was so still that one gasped for vary breathlessness. Two men were walking along the road towards the village. It was still some way off, but the night is pleasanter than the day to travel in, aud they went on. One laughed and sang a mtle as he went. "It is all very weir for you to laugh," said the other crossly. " You have got a wife waiting you, and you have money 4a your bag. I have nothing," and he opened his hands with an angry, gesture.. " Oh," answered the other, " what does it matter, brother ? I have some money, and I will give you some ; you can repay me out of your share of the land. And for wives, there are plenty of them.'* The other grunted.- "I do not want a wife," he sold. • , "Well, well," said tho first speaker soothingly, '•' you have been unlucky. You came.down too late, when it was hard to gut work." • • . . " How was I to know," said 'the ether angrily, " hew- waa I to know thai there would be —ph. a lot of men tor work ?" - He eeeoied to take the remark* as a releott— wpoa him. ■ - .■■ ■ .. ■ ■ >. ■ iTMre was no reply, and they went oa fcaifk together. It got gradually darker.

I never saw it like that before." -It is like a blotch of blood," said the youuger. ■ The elder shivered. "Do net say that,** he said ; " It Is bad luck to talk like that.** The dust roae behind then as they went, and hung upon the road like a ghaetiy veil. Far away a jackal cried, and his call was answered here and there, till the sight «w full of ghostly cries. Ah ha! Ahhai A* ha! They howled ia rising oa4—cs Hfce the laitghter of a.aaniac. . • " JOom your-wift kw»w ihat you are own ing ?" a*ked the yowmsjer suddenly. "I s«nt her word,'' anwrered the eider.

"go on.*" They turned off into the flehs, and pie* sen'tly found a little footpath leatfafc tft* way they wadt«d to go. It was » shot* cut urfed In the dry weather to «at to«heTinag»; during the rest of the year, wfoen crbp» wera on the ground, the fences were cloaed, aa4 it could not be used. As the path was nar row and the fields on either side very rough, they went in single file. First went th* elder man, and behind him followed th» younger. There was jus* enouga light Mt be able to keep to the path. The young wife and a girl-companion were coming out of the village gate. They had water-Jars on their heads, and were on their way to the well. So great was the drought that the water had sunk to the bottom, and It was hard to get enough. During the day it was almost dry, the water oozing in very slowly, so that it did not yield more than two or three bucketfuls every half hour ; but after sunset the Inflow was more oepious, and at intervals all night long the girls were at the well drawing water, going to and fro. The two girls went down the village street to the gate ; it was open, but the watchmen were upon the alert. They went through the gate and 'down the path to where the well lay, between two great tamarind trees in a little hollow. It had a brick curb and a platform round it, with a little flight of steps. The girls let down their dippers into the well and drew up the water. There was just enough, they found, to fill their jars, and they drew slowly, fearful of spilling it as they drew. Toe well was deep, and their arms ached a little with dragging at the cord. "When the jars were full they sat down upon the curb to rest a while ; it wa3 cooler here than in the crowded village, and It was quiet. They sat silently looking over the parched field*. Suddenly there came to their ears a cj^ It was very feeble, and seemed to come out of tha illimitable distance. The girls peered into the night fearfully. The cry came again, a cry not sharp but hoarse, and seeming to end in a moan that crept along the ground. The glrte leapt to their feet in terror, their hearts •boating ; then they crouched behind the well-curb and stared across the fields, their bands clasped. The moan came nearer ; It was coming between them and the village. The girls dared not move ; the path was open and the dreadful thing, whatever it was that was crying, would'see them if they went. They pressed still closer to the well. The cry ceased ; but presently the' girls -became aware of another sound, as of a man gasping, of a man in great agony. It came nearer, and then was heard the cry again, " Come, Come !" The girls got up from behind the well again and looked out. It was a man, then, after all, not a devil of a ghost ; it was a 'man in trouble ; and they could see a figure that staggered across the dim-lit field. As they watched, It swayed to and fro and the man fell. "Come," he cried again as he fell. " Run," eai* the young wife, " run, shout, call the guard •!"• And the girl ran. When she' came near -the gate' she - screamed to the guard, and they rushed out, with half the ■tfUttge floMowlng. They found them down by the well, the young wife holding her husband's head upon (her knees, while sue tried to pour a little water into Ms parefhing lips. All his breast was a mass of blood, and the woman's hands and drees were dabbled with M. Down tter tec© ran great tears of agony, and she |>ent to kiss him again and again. She ■wottld not let anyone touch him or move him. " Let him be," she said. "He will dte tfirectly ; let him die here." So the people' stood round in a ring, and watched. "Mis cousin Killed jilm," she, said to the people. " He- .stabbed' him ;' aiid' my hus band snatched the"* knife from him, and attftfted1 him back." The dying' man had wttispered. in Her ear, and She badundor »tt>bd. ' " It' was on his own land," she added; "in his own field that he did it—in the ovil field." 'And tflrere they found the murderer, dead. Sta&tyed; with his own knife, he lay dead, on the field that they had owned together, and bM about were scattered the silver coins.— "MbdMflttan'g Magazine.'; ' ' :
