MUSICAL AND DRAMATIC NOTES. The intimation in the London papers that Cinder Ellen Up 'Too Late" will be withdrawn from the Gaiety theatre at the close of the London season with a view to the total provincial tour, has a certain interest for Australian pi ty goers The piece was produced in Melbourne for the first time upon any stage" just a year ago, and some six weeks later Mr Fred Leslie oppressed the opinion in our Music li and Dramatic sorts that "the favourable verdict of Sydney and Melbourne audiences would be ratified in London " Mr. Leslie's instinct was right, and I as a matter of fact " Cinder Ellen " has had a six months' run at the Gaiety Theatre, in spite of the absence from the cast of Miss Nellie Farren, the further draw back of the w ord theatre-going Reason that has been known for years, and the preliminary handicap of the most damning notices I the London critics could write Now we have no with to defend "Cinder Ellen," who was certainly " up too late " at the Sydney Theatre Royal on the opening night last L ght-houi Day The piece is nonsense in the same way that Ray Blas or the Blase Roui," its London predecessor is nonsense, and neither of these pantomime elf usions is as well written as " Miss Esmeralda " the best burlesque the Loslio-Parre»i combination over staged But without done using " Cinder Ellen," it may be claimed as a fair specimen of gaiety burlesque, and in point of fact it was so treated by Australian critics and Austr than audiences As staged here it was found too long, and, doubtless, many minor alterations and " new features " as a variety showman would say, have been introduced into the burlesque in London But even after its six months' run, we learn from a recent review of it in a London journal, that Cinder Ellen " will go to the provinces in a state not materially different from that in which it left Australia. The six months' run of the burlesque without the original Cinder- Ellou-"Ilaiulet," so to speak, without the Prince of Denmark shows that the piece had considerable staying power No doubt it was seriously lowered in the estimation of the London critics by having been produced first in such hole- and-corner cities as Melbourne and Sydney, but the mass of London playgoers has not troubled itself upon this point, I and so it comes to pass that the verdict of our audiences has been ratified exactly as Mr Leslie ' predicted I Miss Nellie Stewart has retired from the London | stage after a season w back has disappointed both when off and her friends Miss Stewart I began by refusing the name part in the Nautch Girl " at the Savoy Theatre This was unwise, since appear- anooBttt that house in a leading part places certain cachet of distinction upon the performer winch I cannot be gained in comic opera elsewhere. The J acceptances the role of " Blue Eyed Susan" was i I a more serious mistake Douglas Jerrold's drama J has been " burlesqued to death," and the entertainment in which Miss Stewart appealed depended for success upon the "variety" interludes of that clever comedian, Mr Arthur Roberts Miss Stewart, who has made her name in Australia in genuine coin is operas, would have given a good account of herself in a suitable rule, but the very name on Blue-eyed Susan" suggested wearisome repetition to the seasoned London playgoer In illustration of the conti- n tion that the subject had been travestied writing I and again, it may be added that Mr Arthur 1 Roberts has resumed his part of Captain Cro»»tToo in another burlesque of the same description On I 21st July he was to revive Messrs Lennard and a Borrott's nautical extravaganza " Too Lovely I Black-eyed Susan," at the Theatre Royal, Birmingham, with Miss Phyllis Broughton in the name part Had Miss Stewart conciliated Mr D'Oyley Carte instead of quarreling with him for London record would have been very deficient from the mediocre success which resulted from the Herculean task she set herself of raising into prominence the colourless character of Susan We in Australia know how cleverly Miss Stewart can play a good part like " Iolanthe," but in London no opportunity has been afforded the actress of exploiting her talents in the direction her Australian admirers would desire After Miss Myra Kemble's short revival of " Dr BUI," which will be played at the Imperial Opera House to-night and during next week, the actress will give fresh interest and a new impetus to her Benson by producing Broughton's serious drama "The Peer of the Realm, and Arthur Law's farcical comedy " The Judge," for the first time in Sydney. It is probable that Mr A R Lawrence will join her company for the production both of "The Peer," which will be anovontof next month, and of " The Judge," which is to be staged on Saturday next Mr W J Hollo- way purchased the Australian rights of this piece, and they now fall to Miss Kemble by arrangement with Mr W J Gates of this city "The Judge" was originally produced at Terry's Theatre two years ago with Mr Pooley in the name part The character is that of a nervous valetudinarian addicted to globules, aconite, hot blankets, and warming pans, who is terrorised by Matilda Dowker, a prisoner (and former sweetheart) who takes refuge in his house Mr Edwin Kelly will play the part of the Judge, Miss Annie Taylor will be the escaped bigamist, and there will be other characters which, as cast by Miss Kemble, should prove provocative of laughter Miss Kemble's plans also include a revival of " The Now Matrdolon " In such case she will resume the character she played with so much success at the Gaiety Theatre some years ago, when Mr. Dampier appeared as the Rev. Julian Gray Miss Rosa Deering's seven months' engagement to Mr George Musgrove terminated on 9th August, and during the week the actress sailed for England Miss Dearing has been engaged for a new piece especially written for her, under the ambiguous title of "The Left Twin," by Mr Sutton Vane.
