Mall Annour. With Hicks Pasha in the Soddak, dy the bon. j; colboenk. It was in the Soudan that X first saw the mail armour of the middle ages : actually in use. Whether an original, or a copy, the dress of a chief (who. joined us) was undoubtedly the self same pattern as that-worn by Richard Creur de Liou and the Crusaders. The hauberk of mail was fastened round the body by the baltan, and formed a complete covering from head to foot. The long two-handed, double-edged, , sword was worn between the leg and the saddle. lh;s appears to be ad ditional proof that this chain-armour came to the Arabs from tbe Saracens, who stripped it' from the bodies of slain or captured knights. I asked the sheikh — the wearer of this garb — where he had got his armour. He said that it bad been in his family 310 years. I may add that his horse's head was encased in steel, and its body j covered with a quilt ; thick enough to turn a spear; and shaped like the armour one reads of in Froissart. Altogether the sheikh, being above 6ft. high, rode fully seventeen stone. Tbe first time I saw the man was in our first night alarm. It was moonlight ; and, at the first bugle-sound, I rushed out of iny tent. I was as much sur prised as if I had met the ghost of my own grandfather. In front of me stood the apparition of a knight el ad in full armour, lance in hand, and sword on thigh. I rubbed my eyes, and thought that I was dreaming ; but the apparition vanished not ; and, since t hat day, I have encountered many as complete specimens.
