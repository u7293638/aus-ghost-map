Ihe Flight of the Years. When one by one the silent stately years Glide like pale ghosts beyond our yearning sight, Vainly we stretch onr arms to stay their flight, So soon, so swift, they pass to e=d!e«* night! We hardly learn to name them, To praise them or to blame them, To know their shadowy faces, Ere we see their empty places ! Only once the glad spring greets them, Only once fair summer meets them. Only once the autumn glory * Tells for them its mystic story. Only Dnce the winter hoary Wears for them its robes of light' Years leave their work half done; like men, alas! With sheaves ungathereu to their gravee they pass. And are forgotten. What they strive tc da Lives for a while in memory of a few, Then over all Oblivion's waters flow— The years are buried in the long ago.
