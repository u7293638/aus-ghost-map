Within a radius df ten miles of Salisbury sufficient matter m the shape of tradition and snperstitionicould be collected to fill. ■ a respectable book. There is a certain desolate sp6t wherg the hard, white, dusty -: road, little beiter^xtralT a CaUTl^rackV winds like a serpent across a portion of the famous plain and passes between two dis " nsed pifs. The sides are not guarded in any way, and to w/tlk over the raised turf on either side of the road means falling a considerable depth: - At a certain season of the year—abd of coarse after midnight, . when the moon is up—the weaiy traveller passing this uncanny spot is startled to descry a hare, which rises apparently froin the earth -omone side of the the road, and limps slowly and painfully-.across'to.*the other : side. Even a weary pedestrian, joyfally anticipating a savoury meal, may be tempted toi ollow puss; but woe betide him in such event. Rarely eluding its ■ pursuer's.■grasp, the little .animal climbs laboriously over the slight embankment. followed by the eager stranger, whose r mangled remains ate found at the bottom of the quarry on tbefollowing day.. At; another place, not many miles distant, 'the midnight 'way farer has peen staggered by tbe eighttif a black, misty ball rolling " down a steep hill, threatening to crush him. If ah active man, he escapes to the ; road Bide or through the hedge ; if not, he passes through it, or rather it envelops him for a moment, like the dnst cloud of the desert, and passes on. Hereabouts, too, may be met in the small hours the noiseless coach and pair dashing along the "down at breakneck speed, with not the faintest Bonnd save the sharp crack of the spectral postilion's whip, which is de clared to be -distinctly audible.
