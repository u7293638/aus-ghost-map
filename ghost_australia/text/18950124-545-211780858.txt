Hey, Diddle, Diddle. Hey, diddle, diddle ! The cat and the fiddle, Are getting old-fai-hioued, I trow, More novel '(would be for a great wallaby The orgau to play with one toe. For the moon to give chase to the man. on ber face, And the comet to join iu the fun. For the evergreen rabbit'to weep at the habit Of squatters infesting its run. For the novelist pale to yield up his tale To the sheep of Bo peep's woeful verse. For the ghost of the comer to sit on Jack Horuer Whit Coroner Cats seek a hearse. For small digs to giggle when cows give & wriggle. That lauas them away past the moon, Ig ronlly quite stale, as is also the tale Of tbd dish making off with that Epoon. Now, not to make off with a spoon when there's moou, Is a far uiore astouishing thing. And to see tbe moon wriggle— oh, hey diddle, diddle, In that case vou reallr might sing. — K.T.
