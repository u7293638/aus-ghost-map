Sir — I was very much grieved and at the same time somewhat amused at the letter of ' Hamlet's Ghost' in your issue of the 25th inst., in which the writer refers to Mr. Catt's visit-to Crystal Brook, and in which he pre sumes that the reason why he did not visit the working men and the small blockers is because he supposes they are regarded by him as the slime of the earth, As a working man, and one who has been acquainted with Mr. Catt for the last nine or ten years, I feel compelled in justice to enter my protest against such a vicious, unmanly, slan derous statement as the latter. Mr. Catt is as much a friend to the working classes as to any other class. He makes no distinction between rich or poor, bond or free ; they are all the same to him. I am quite sure if 'Hamlet's Ghost' will take the trouble to look up 'Han- sard' he will find that Mr. Catt has proved himself to be a friend of the workinsr classes by supporting all measures brought forward in . the House for their benefit. I am quite sure if 'Hamlet's Ghost' would only inform Mr. Catt of his whereabouts and express a wish for an interview, he would be as much pleased to have a chat with him as with any storekeeper or apent. However, should Mr. Catt not have this pleasure I have no doubt 'Hamlet's Ghost' will have the privi lege of meeting Mr. Catt when on the hust ings, and will then have the chance of dis tinguishing himself, at which time I have no doubt Mr. Catt will be able to give an intelli gent and satisfactory account of his steward ship. — I am, &e.;, WORKING MAN.
