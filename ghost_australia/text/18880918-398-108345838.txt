There is 1*0 more reprehensible fault than that of keeping up deceptive appear ances, especially among young men who are commencing to battle with the world. That is just the time of life when, if they are dependent upon their own exertions, they will either make or mar their future. We have iu view several cases that may serve as a warning to others, in whose interests we refer to them, assuring our readers that the personages have an actual existence and that the eveuts re lated have actually transpired. o >:> The first was a case of a youth who had been petted and pampered by an over- indulgent mother. He received the too common college education which re sulted iu his having acquired 110 know ledge of any kind, save 011 the subject of ! \ dress. I11 this respect he thought he was j an adept. Without any knowlede of busi . nesslie made liis start in life with a good I firm. Here he had every chance to make 1 a man of himself, to acquire useful and 1 valuable business habits and knowledge, I a:«l to work his way up in the world. The j drawback to his success consisted in lii^ j j <rreat admiration for himself and for the : 1 one or more girls whomhe eoiidcsc-iided to j patronise. Part of his office hours woula : lie occupied 111 corresponding with them, J and another part in obtaining the much j needed rest of which lie deprived himself j at niglit, for this youth was a man about ' town" a habitue of leading hotels and a [ lounger at the bars. Of- course such j habits could not conform to those re 1 quired bva boy i 11 business. H.e lived iu \ 1; fashionable boarding house at the e» | j;e;jse of i;is parents, so his little i-al.i'y j was his pocket money. But it e:m be j readilv imagined that this did not sullies ! for SUeii a spark, and he was soon in Ihe ' habit of borrowing from his fellow clerk*, j His want of sleep by night made him ; =tupid bv dav. and of course he, officially. I proved a* failure. His memory was like ; a sieve and he was practically useless. ? finally lie associated with sports, and then the downfall was more rapid. He > : remained away from his ofliee for a week ; J or two without permission, and as a j | uurur.il sequence he remained away for- j i ever. ?so v what will become of this ? votuh ' lu his case a good adminisiration . at die birch would be advantageous. His i :-a rents are also to blame for permitting \ him to 'jrrew up in such n fasliion that <111 5 impecunious youth will start out in life by { iilieing a man ;ui>l a millionaire. His enu. ?? ] is not"difficult to foretell-dissipation, de j bauchery and dentil. j j lu the second case we refer to, the | being has passed boyhood and should have i j acquired sense. If anything his ca»e is j the more hopeless of the two. Imagine a j 1 man <>11 a f:ur salary, living alone and i with no family ties. Yet he can hardly I be called a man as men are considered, i He is imbued with more of the elements , ' of womanhood, iiuickv, nambj -pamb\, ** ] sort of dancing pekas*-this at least is I how he is regarded by men who aiv men. I His sole aim in life is to be a leader 111 I ««»cietv, the <-l' f among the boil-ton. He ! lias no male friends, but is always to be ? found iu the boudoir or iu the drawing 1 room. He is a ihst-niglit< r at the ! theatres, a leader in the genua 1, an usne?. i at fashionable wedc i lgs, in fact a dude j among dudes. Now can any man with j sparkof manly feeling pass such an e>> ! isteuce > >"0 association worthy of the I name wttli his fellows. who raihei s-huii \- and sneer at 3iis ways, he maps himseh ; up 111 his self-conceit and I he e \ er-exist \ iii£ consciousness a intense *iduni«i I tion 011 the part of the fair sex for his | beauteous figure and shape.his moustache, \ the touch of his hand, and his elegance in dance. Oh, horrors ! How such an ex istence is to be shunned. We can im a-jin- this being as the recipient of choice buuquels and scented notes,a spotless 11101 tal too good torthi^ sphere and who should soar to hiviher realms seated near the throne of (jod. hat iiis business habit. { and recommendations can be. it is d'liv I cult to imagine. The wear and tear o: i lute hours and dissipation must tell m i time. The necessary expenses in connec 5 tion with intim itea-socintionamong lyad ' in<r soci'-ty must amount to a laige shai' \- of a moderate income, and leave but kttlo \ for the necessaries of life. A careful e.i: I ployer would do well to keep a wathn: | eve upon such a one, and examine hi> i counts with pertinacious ivgulaiit\\. Fe | ourselves we would not keep him live ? miuutos. for tli<2 association of swoil uoi^ 1 must needs be costly, and 110 man O; | moderate means has the right to lniugi-.: ! with the rich. He cannot afford to do j they do. and is but a base imitation of til* f richer metal, and a veritable «snob. jj f X &i;:.iRcur.R afiifi liciu; wauia to know *' why ."t . is, with so many negroes dying, nobody ever sees t a black ghostV 1 ?
