ON THE GREAT MOUNTAINS. BY TELEMACHUS. And we rode away on a ridge which divided boldly the eastern and the western waters, the Snowy and the Murray rivers. High aloft still amongst the snow and the snow flowers, and in utter solitude, save for the birds. The eagles never left their craggy heights or ceased their magnificent flights. Farther and farther away, till they appeared but as specks or motes above the mighty forms which suffered no perceptible diminishment by distance. Large brown swifts were now about us, and down above the timber we could see flocks of the Bogong crows rollicking through the air, tumbling about in their flight like English rooks at play. But no other living thing was visible on all the face of the earth. Tracks there were of the dingo and the wild cat, and wild eyes were doubtless peering out at us from some dark crannies in the rocks. These wild creatures inhabit here, secure from all disturbance, and snakes come nearly if not quite up to the snow line, adapting their vile selves in strange fashion to every Aus- tralian circumstance. None crossed our track, however, for many and many a mile. We rode on and on, keeping to the main ridge ; no road of any sort, no path even. As far as practicable Jim Findlay pro- posed to make a bee-line to the shoulder of the New South Wales Bogong, which now became the most conspicuous object a weary way ahead. Snow about us all that afternoon. Sometimes in flakes and patches, not unfrequently in broad sheets, about which we had to ride carefully, for the melting snow is treacherous. Flowers with us also, though in less than 10 miles we rode out of the true mountain daisy land. They seem to have been planted only on the sacred heights. It is a very strange country through which we ride. Great grey rocks jut out through the high, uncropped grass ; innumerable creeks, crystal-clear, trickle down the slopes, or steal noiselessly through deep channels in the frequent morasses. It is the land where the rivers are created, where the water spirits should dwell. It is 4 o'clock in the afternoon when we come to the snow timber line, the uncouth, gnarled, knotted fringe which makes a band not by any means unlike a crown of thorns about all the mountain brows. We found a way through weak places, and came out again on the plains. We paused for a while by a little mound of rocks, which surely, one might say, had been prepared by Nature for some high purpose. They were piled on a broad, green, gently-sloping hill breast. They rose cairn-like to a height of not less than 50 feet, and in every hollow was a nest of grass and flowers, and in every cranny a braid of delicate fern, and within——! If one could muse here for a while, something should surely be discovered to a lively imagination, not all unworthy of association with the beautiful myths of the elder world. But Jim said, " Ride on, ride on." And in another hour we descended to a broad valley, down which flowed a bright, glad creek. A valley a half-mile in breadth and winding miles and miles through the hills ; a valley now all tall grass and bright flowers; a valley which would satisfy and delight any pastoral pioneer, which should feed and fatten, so it seemed, tens of thousands of sheep and cattle, but in which we now stood absolutely alone, still a no-man's land, still closed against any continuous occupation by the bar of the winter snow. Now we were willing enough to make a camp by that creek. I at least was not after a quarter of an hour's spell anxious for the saddle again, for of riding as of every other carnal pleasure there cometh satiety with continuance. " It is five o'clock anyhow, and what is the hurry!" Jim answered ; " there are clouds about, and the sooner we get out of this snow country the better." Clouds ! The uninstructed eye looked aloft, and saw but a few baseless, isolated masses rolling about, giving variety of glory to the blue. What had one to fear from clouds such as those. The answer is, " They grow up here, they come up or down, and they stay sometimes. Say any one of those fellows should take a notion to camp down on top of us, and stay for a day or two, where should we be?" " In the cloud, of course " "Exactly ! bushed in the cloud, if you like —locked up, blocked. We couldn't ride another yard, and clouds are always cold, and sometimes they change to rain or to snow , and how would you pick your way across or through the bogs if there were only an inch or two of snow on the top of them?" The clouds did not appear half so glorious after those few remarks, and none of us were eager for an Ixion embrace. Strange how good the horses were. I rode old Henderson Africanus, born and named in the old Berry-blight time ; for I thought, said Mr. Findlay, he was likely to turn out a useful sort of creature. Full fifteen years old therefore, and yet sound as a bell and hard as iron, breasting a lull o\er which the low sun was streaming now, and stretching out m a canter when the summit was reached, free as if fresh from acorn manger, and at the begin nmg of a day's journey But for all that I begun to despair of making the shoulder of the Bogong that night Wrapping the even mg mist like a cloak about his rugged bulk, he seemed actually to recede from our approach Ile vi as euht, ten, twelve miles away "Nonsense, not more than five ' And still we rode on A good five miles, and down wLilt the sun, anil still the Bogong v\ as far aw ay "Me hav c as good a chance of getting to heaven as of making that mountain to night ' A look at the clouds, and "Well then, wellcamp" 'J hit was good news We turned off a hundred yards to the left, and halted on sound, diy giound, just biloiv a timber belt 1 litre vías not much time to look about just then, although the mystery of the twilight was near its perfection It takes a little time, e\en foi quick and experienced hands, to pitch a tent, and make a sleeping door, and gather up a nights firewood I must confess also to a feeling of desperate wean ness that evening We had been near twelve hours in the saddle or on our feet, and had covered full fifty miles of the roughestcountry in Australia, and had nuved it up with as much vi all ing and climbing as would make upa fair day s v. ork without the riding But my young friends viere strong nnd enduring, as if made all of spring steel, and badome stretch myself on the rugs and rest while they would get everything ¡ti trim And so I lay at ease and watched the (ire 1 indie and brighten, and the twilight close to din kness and the mist steal about the Hats, and the great mountain become hut a ghost, xamslung utterly as at length the soveteign darkness clipped us round with a very narrow horizon But far more vwld and weird were all things when the moonlight filled the xalloy, when near on midnight I enme out to build up the fire, and saw the strange, silent, solitary country all around most curiously revealed Was it silent, was it solitary* Hie crackle of the flames was clear enough, the occasional tinkle of the horse bell also, and sonorous and deep came occasional slumbrous sounds from the in terlor of the tent.

The hunters came on with a well timed rush pell-mell across the hilltop, gathering and gathering till they were in a semicircle close behind the flying squadron. Tearing along the plateau with whoop and shout and bang of whips and thunder of hoofs, and then over the crest ot the hill like a waterfall over a precipice, a wild burst through the jaws, and the whole mob secure in the trap. A big haul was made on that occasion, and there was wild work of roping and riding for many days after. Wild work for wild men I doubt much if any of the Texan cowboys would hold their own with our Monaro men in a burst across those mountains, or even in handling their prey when trapped. But wilder work even than the mounted hunting was once done hoie 'J he mountain men turned out orte winter in snow shoes, and surrounded and trapped SOO horses The poor brutes were utterl) powerless

made no acquaintance with razors fora week past, and of linen we are destitute utterly, - and our clothes are sadly travel-stained, and our horses are weary and girth-galled with the rough mountain work, the old packer jogging along in a specially dejected fashion. The first man we encounter is an ancient Chinaman with two buckets on his shoulder pole. Ile stops to look at us and passes along again, and we jog along to the hotel. "It's tlie divil of aplace," said the cabman to G. A. Sala "when in the winter time he drove him out to see Niagara ; "a divil of a place, sir, entirely." I decline, however, to believe that it was nsbad ns Kiandra was, or scorned to be, that evening. Con you imagine two- score houses grouped in a treeless val- ley, the bed of the creek worked till ulong, no tree, no gurdon plot, no flower or plant anywhere visible, nine out of ten of the houses utterly destitute of pnint, and about half of them falling, down. A pig or two, a goat or two, a woman, a couple of children, and a mau visible. No church building of any sort, but ii something that looks like a schoolhouse on the hill, mid a couple of publichotises with open doors and empty bins. That is Kiandra. Very soon, however, we found the ¡o'Mtt to be better than their surroundings. The good ,vomon of the house, being properly approached, promised us in a little while as good ii dinner as could be desired. An ancient ostler, strangely suggestive of tlie Tentiysonian Vision of Sin, took charge of al! the horses. The postmaster carne across and invited us to drink, then took us nil over to his own establishment and barbered us effectively, but without much mercy. And when evening came the dinner was good and our appetites keen. We had not much time to look about that night-not much inclina- tion cither- and it was strange when the sunset caine, to lind creeping about us that old familiar mountain sunset chill. We were indoors, it was the hottest month of the year. Such things ought not to be, tlie folks of the house understood it, and lit up a blazing fire in the parlour. And the reason of it is this. Kiandra is C.OOOft. above sea level, ond at every sunset becomes cold as Switzer- land. Never a hot wind blows here, never a mosquito pings or stings, never a sweltering night renders it necessary to pitch away I blankets and coverlids. It is such a climate as is found at Wakatipu or Invercargill, New Zealand, uracing, invigorating, affording just as perfect a change as the fugged man of Melbourne or Sydney could desire. The wearied men and women, however, the careworn toilers in the dusty ways of Sydney and Melbourne, have neveryet reached Kiandra, never will, perhaps - never, at least, till there is'made for them a way. Speculators have been here-they will he first to exploit the ice lands nbout the pole if there is any reasonable prospect of gold-and miners in the old days by the thousand. Only a year or two ngo also there was pros- pect of great development about the old town, for enterprising men of Sydney intro- duced the American system of water-mining, the Monitor water-gun, with which whole mountain heads are washed down nnd the golden grains collected from thousands of tons. It did not quite succeed, but the townsfolk who j'oiu us nbout the lire at night affirm that there are still hopes of a great development. It may come; but I, listening to the fireside stories on that wintry summer's night, have hopes of de- velopment of another sort. For they tell us stories hereof strange new life-of aclosed-in land in thcwinter, with the mail runonsnow shoes ; of a tunnel cut beneath the snowfronr the door of this hotel to the post-office oppo- site ; of wild Biiow-shoe races down the steep hillsides onBoxing or New Year's Day. Of,, divers experiences, indeed, unfamiliar to the ordinary Australian as the ring of the ice skate ¡rons, or the tinkle of the sleigh bells. And yet we shall hardly expect to send winter visitors to Kiandra, or any true moun- tain sanatorium, for many years to come. It is this perfect summer' change which will first be sought after and appreciated, this perfect escape from. all the worst of summer's trouliles. , " Suppose, now, a really good house were built and kept here, is there any resource apart from the climate?" Any resource ! AVhut a chorus . .of reply followed ! Any resource ! Are there not the Yarran-go-Billy eaves, the beautiful river, the hot spring? Is not Lob's Hole near? Are there not mountain valleys, down which in- numerable streamlets Hash and gutter. Go out and see, said they all, go out and see ; and we answered, " A'es, we will wait for the morrow, and then certainly we will go out and see." And then the fire burned low, and the stars came out frosty and clear, and it was real luxury in mid-February to roll a half dozen blankets down over a bed of feathers, and to turn in with a very perceptiWe shiver, _ and to acknowledge that, toleralMo as a camp bed might be made, it was after all a wretched ' apology for linen and feathers, and soon then to sleep the sleep of the weary, and to dream', of Yarran-go-Billy.
