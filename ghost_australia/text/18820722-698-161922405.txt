Spring Dirge. A child came singing, through the dusty town, A song so sweet that all men stayed to hear ; Forgetting, for a space, their ancient fear Of evil days and death and fortune's frown. ?She sang of Winter dead and Spring new-born ? In the green fields beyond the far hills hound ; And how this fair Spring, coming blossom-crowned, Would cross the city's threshold on the morn. And each caged bird in ev'ry close anigh, Ev'n as she sang, caught up the glad refrain Of Hope and Love and fair days come again, A1LL all. nuu u^n&vt; *w*Â£w iuvj uuu ku uiv( And all the ghosts of buried woes were laid That heard the song of this sweet sorceress ; The Fast grew to a dream of old distress, . And merry were the hearts of man and maid. :So, at the first faint flush of tender dawn, Sprine stole with noiseless steps through the gray gloom, And men knew only by a strange perfume ''Which filled the air that she had come and gone. ?-But, ah, the lustre of her violet eyes \- Was dimmed with tears for her sweet-singirg maid, Whose voice would round no more in shine or shade To charm men's souls at set of sun or rise. ?For there, with dews of dawn upon her hair, Like a fair flower plucked and flung away, Dead in the street the little maiden lay 'Who gave new life to hearts nigh dead of care. Alas, must this be still the bitter doom Awaiting those, the finer souled of earth, JJ'ho make for men a morning song of mirth '\J bile yet the birds are dumb amid the gloom ? They walk on thorny ways with feet unshod; Bihg one last song, and die as that song dies. There is no human hand to close their eyes, And very heavy is the hand of God. Victor J. Daley
