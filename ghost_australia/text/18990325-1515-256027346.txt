Those Little Pigs that Died. 'Tis nauseating, certainly, And exceedingly unpleasant To even hint at rotten lint, Or poultices putrescent; But 'tis sadly necessary, Though hardly dignified, To tell the tale of refuse stale, And those little piga that died. These pigs were born into the world Aa porkers mostly are; And for a space they thrived apace, Then grew quite angular. Each day they seemed to sicken, With something wrong inside; Then this porcine host gave up the ghost, In other words, they died. And when these pigs had ceased to be, And drew their final breath; Then men enquired why they expired, To find the cause of death. At this wholesale mortality They grew quite mystified, For they meant to slay another way Those little pigs that died. Then came ^he painful tidings Of the grueBome compound hellish, These porkers gone had fed upon With much apparent relish. At the Hospital at Guildford Much waste was cast aside, To be gathered up for bite and sup , Of those little pigs that died. I know it is disgusting. So now, no more I'll talk On this subject sore, for Â£ want no more Prime Hospital-fed pork. For the Hebrew and Moslem May, with pardonable pride, Thank thBir lucky stars for a faith that bars Such little pigs that died.
