! Religibus'Swvices:* ' f! LAITNOESTON TABERNACLE.'' ; : The second, of the series of special' Sun day evening services was held last 'Sunday at the Lauuoesfcou Tabernacle, when there was a very large congregation. The sing ing of pieces from ' The' Christian ' Choir,' and : songs and solos were rendered with much spirit and good effect. The subject chosen by Pastor Clarke was entitled ' A ghost story,' or 'The witch of Endor,' the preacher baling his remarks on 'the words in Samuel i., xxviii. chap.; xy. verse,; 'And Saul answered lam sore distressed, etc.' . Pastor Clarke referred to the fact ? that very often the Bible spoke of people' having familiar spirits; but it denied that anyone had power to link themselves on to' spirits from, the other world. : The pastor spoke at length on the subject, ia which he said, that a guilty conscience' makes cowards of us all, and instanced the rases of Bellshazzar, Herod, and Judas. He re ferred to the hardening effect of sin on the conscience. He reminded his hearers that it is not always to be silenced, but that in some quiet hour— at death's' hour, if not before— it would make itself heard With startling distinctness. He warned hia hearers not to sin away their day of grace ere God said 'Let him alone,' and ithey were lost; but urged them- to accept Jesus Christ ,now,: while- the door of mercy' was still; open,: and Christ willing and anxious to aare.
