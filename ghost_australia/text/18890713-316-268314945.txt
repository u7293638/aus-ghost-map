THE SIN OF OMISSION. . IT isn't.tbe thing you do, dear, ;: : ,;,It's:the thing von leave undone Which gives you a bit of a heartache • At the setting of the sun. The tender word forgotten, The letter you did not write, She floweryou might have sent, dear, Arc your haunting ghosts to night. The stone you might have lifted Out of a brother's way, The.bit of heartsome counsel Tou -wero burned too much to say. . The loving touch of the land, dear, Tho gentle and winsome tone .That -you had ao time nor thought for. With troubles enough of yorn own. -These little acts of kindness, So easily out of mind, These chances TObo angels Which even mortals find— They come in night and silence, Each chill, reproachful wraith, jWbenihope iis faint and fflaggmg, And a bbght has dropped on faith. Jor-life is all too short, dear, And sorrow is all too great, To suffer our .slow compassion *_ Tbat tarries Jintll too late. And it's not the- thing -you do, dear, Ifs the thing you leave undone, Which gives you the bitter heartache. At tbe setting of tbe sun.
