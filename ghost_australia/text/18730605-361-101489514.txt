MODERN GHOSTS. Ghosts seem to have transferred their favours from the suburbs and police courts of London to a still more credulous coun- try than our own. In America they are becoming a daily nuisance, and the col- umns of loading journals or continually devotod to chronicting their movements. Tluo latest aocounts speok of six nosorious anees, all contomoporory snd in full fieroe up to date. Ono is the ghost of a little boy with golden air, and dreso?d in brown, who is always oiking through the window of a sehool at Nowburyport, kept by a certain Miss Perkins, and frighteniog btr and her pupils out of suoh wits as they may happen to heo amonea them. A so. onnd is the ease of a Mliss O1emestine JoooA, of J.,nsingbhr., who is viotialseod by the yslling of unacoountablo voices, the sound of footsteps, and, in general, by ohe " shadow of mystery," whateier liat cnay mean. A third ghoist is a youtsg man who haunts tihc driser of the eneima Von Motlko, on the Syraouso and Bing,. hIampltm railway.

NARROW ESCAPE--About half past 7 on Sunday morning (says the Newcastle Pilot) the steam tug Bengaree while cruising outside the harbour, discovered a small dingy under canvas about two milea to the eastward. Upon steaming within hail the boat was found to be occupied by a man, who made signals for the tug to steam towards him; this having been done, he was taken on board, and on the roturn of the tug boat was towed into the harbour, It seems that the occupant of the dingy was a seaman on board the ship Moonta, trading to Wallaroo, but now lying in the harbour. On Saturday night, after having sacrificed too often at the shrine of Bacchus, he left the warf in the boat for his ship but his ideas of the whereabouts of his vessal becoming vague he rowed in the wrong direction, and losing one paddle was unable to manage the dingy, and drifted out to sea, where he managed to beat about till picked up bty tge Bangaree. Providen- tially for him the wind was partly in his favour all night, or he would have been miles away at sea long before the tug dis- covered him. It was at first thought ine was attempting to escape from his vessel, but the facts of the case being ascertained he was permitted to rejoin his ship.
