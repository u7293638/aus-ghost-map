Fire and Snakes. An incident of the recent forest fires in the Fine creek region is related by Sam Campbell, "who works in the woods near Blackwell's. Sam was one of the crew of men sent out to * back fire' (fight fire with fire), and he de clares that their experience was most thrilling. While setting fire to a thicket that crowned a rocky ridge, he and his crew were startled to find themselves suddenly in the midst of a lot of rattlesnakes. The forest fire was advancing up the side of the hill at a rapid rate. It whistling, whirring sound as it devoured the hemlock tops was terrific, and the men were bent on building a line of fire to start toward it, hoping that when the two lines met the fury of the flames would be sub dued for lack of material on which to feed. It was while thus employed that they encountered the snakes. The ground seemed to be literally alive with rattlers, the reptiles crawl ing in the direction of a rocky bluff not more than one hundred yards dis tant. The men were all equipped with high-topped leather boots and paid little heed to the snakes, stepping on them as though they were but harm less old sticks. Campbell says that the rattling made by the reptiles could be heard above the roar of the distant flames. The 1 backfire' made by the men caught dozens of crawlers and they were burned to death. Campbell said he watched several of the rattlers ' give up the ghost.' When the flames advanced so close that the snakes saw further escape was impossible they would coil up in a heap, darting their heads angrily at the tongues of flame, then suddenly relapse, when the heat overcame them a moment later to be devoured.
