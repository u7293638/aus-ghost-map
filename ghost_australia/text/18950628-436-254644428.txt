THE CHOST VANISHED. The recent teachings of leaders of the theoaophlc cult or their natural superstitions seem to have aroused In the minds of some of the residents ot Glenelg the old-fashioned belief in the existence ot ghosts (writes the Adelaide Advertiser.) While some nervous individuals have been sadly terrified by a mysterious light appearing through a window in an empty house not far from Jetty-road, the " manifestation" has provided a big 11 draw" from a spectacular point of view. Every evening for the past fortnight fifty or more persons have assembled in the hope or dread of seeing " spirits." In fact no concert or church gathering had a chance against tbe " supernatural show." There eeetn, however, to be some unbelievers at the B»y.

A well known Hindly-atreet clothier placed an overcoat over a gas lamp which shed it rays for a distance of about 200 yards, and—exebat ghost. Tbis gentleman has discovered a simple but effective method of raising ghosts."
