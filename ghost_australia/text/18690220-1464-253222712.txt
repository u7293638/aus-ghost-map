WELCOME ! Hurrah ! through the wires swiftly flying, Comes news that will make each heart bound — The news that the Royal sea captain Once more treads Australian ground. The past, with its hideous chapter, Is nought to the brave British youth, He comes to receive our assurance 1 Of loyalty firm, and our truth. But a year since a colony's gladness — When cheering the son of our Queen — Was checked by the act of a madman, And sorrow o'erspread the whole scene. In the pain-throbs his faith never faltered — He heard our deep wailing and woe, And heeded the prayer of a people — "Not unto us reckon this blow ! " What a tale to recount of his absence ! The fabric built up from our shame ! Convulsing our land to its centre, 1 And setting each sect in a flame ! ! Will he scorn them — those who en- I deavoured (To aid their political creed) The country to charge with connivance, And brand a whole land with the deed ? Will he hear what exposure has met them? That "plots" are all scattered to winds ? That stories of "ghosts" and of " murders " Were used as political blinds ? | Once more, from this incubus lightened, j We stand free and bold as of yore, On their shoulders the false accusations Recoil, with the tales that they swore. Be ready with welcome to greet him, And prove that our hearts, as of old, Are filled with a loyal devotion, In spite of what schemers have told. Let those take the wall who maligned us, Or, crestfallen, sneak from the scene, As — with creeds and opinions united — We welcome the son of our Queen !
