Notes by 'Martindale.' A day's racing is to bs held at Greenwell Point, under the auspices of the local race clnb on Decem ber 26. ? According to the latest advices from Melbourne, the Victorian Trotting Club have purchased OakJeigh Park, and will in future hold its race meetings there. This has been brought about through the refusal to the club of a licence to run at Elaternwick Park. For some year-3 the clnb has held most successful meet ings at the Utter place, which it has much improved. However, its new quarters are in every way suit able. The Balranald Eacing Club has a balance of .£134 19s 9d to its credit according to the balance sheet read at the late annual general meeting held on August 26. The Plattsburg and Wallsend Amateur Turf Club has issued a programme of race events, to be run off at the Wallsend course on September 19. A little over 100 sovs is to be given away by the Silyerton Jockey Club to its Spring Race Meeting, which has been fixed to take place on September 23. The leading event is the Silverton Cup, of 45 sovs, l^mile. ' . \ . At a meeting of the committee of the Murrombidgee Turf Club the following motion was carried : 'That all horses which have been trained since August 24 besot charged for; that i0a''6d be charged for each horse trained from July lto December 31, 1891, and the same amount be required for training fees for each horse for every six months trained, commencing on January 1 and July 1 in each year, and that no charge be made for horses trained on three days pre ceding race meetings.' A race meeting is announced to take place at Acacia Dam on September 30. The programme in which is included a Hurdle Eace, is made up of six races, the total amount of added money being 100 sovs. From the Richmond cornea the news that Mr. J. Wightman has purchased from Mr. Edwards, Eomola, the winner of the-Corinthian race at Casino. She is a fine roomy mare by Eastley (imp.) oat of Beisling, and a full sister to Hock. Eace meetings to take place at Yass and Collector have been registered by the A. J.C. According to late advices from Melbourne, Wy combe broke down bo badly while racing last Satur day at Elsterowick Park that he will not be able to race again for some time to come. It is pleasing to hear that the spring meeting of the Murrumbideee Turf Club, whioh was brought to a conclusion on Taesdaylast, was in every way a suc cess. On the second day Piety won the Grandstand Handicap, beating Mayday. Latina had no difficulty' in securing the Foal Stakes, while the favorite. Two Up, who went out at 6 to 4, won the TownPlate easily. After Ellery had won the Disposal Stakes, Transit got home in the Steeplechase, the ' favorite, The Ghost, falling. In the hist event, the Ladies9 Brace let, Associate went out favorite, but was beaten by The Bobs Tailor. Though many think differently, and that a dinner at a guinea a piece would have been the most appro priate way of opening TattersaU'E new rooms, I must say that the committee chose the better plan in my opinion. It was a most representative assemblage of sportsmen, and must have caused some curious thougnta to flit iihroagh the minds of those present who have been associated in th the chib since its first start. When I first entered the room, with its neatly set-out tables for the guests,' the memory of 'Now, gentlemen, will you please leave the room; I want to set the tables for dinner,' uttered some years ago, came back to me. That was when the members need to congregate . in what was then termed the long, room at Tattersall's Hotel. The committees deserve every oredit for the prosperity of the* club, ^and here I must say that not^a little of their standing of to-day is due to the efforts, of; their present secre tary, Mr.. JameS Perry. c N° ' 0n^ could work harder auk look after the. interests of his employers with greater zeaL If I remember right Mr. Perry was elected to the position about 12 years ago, so that the length of service tells pretty plainly that he is the right man in ihe right place. . . There were not a few people present at the opening of Tattersaire Club who thpught that, the ' books ' showed a somewhat undue laaste to begin business in it. Hardly had the chairman sat down, after reply-, ing to a toast, before '1*11 lay 6 to 1 EpBpm Handi cap' could be heard. Others ^qnickly joined in, as; if there was a wager as to who would book the first bet No doubt -file metalfieianB when they glanced round thought it ^a good opportunity, seeing such an assemblage or w'eifltihy people. There is an old eaying of- 'strike while ^e iron'Bhot,' but I very -much doubt if one jnwi *c^me to that gathering, with'the least 4de^ of backing a horse, and it would have been mcch better teete if the betting books had bees left behind, and the gathering allowed to pass off without ' the effort being made to literally drag a. lew pounds out Qf~au unsuspecting assemblage's pocket ' ?' ?.?'??!, '^s:. ? -? r-^ . ?'
