THE GIFT OF THE HOLY GHOST. How may we obtain this wonderful gift ? lit is absolutely necessary that there be first ? a complete consecratjpn to God, since he will not come to a soul which is not wholly f.the Lord's. This consecration involves -every power, every talent and all our sub stance, and must be made in conscious .self- abandonment to God. Then the prayer -for this gift will be the prayer of faith and Vhin rtrtmincr Twill nnnpfÂ»?nrialT7 raalicrod tthat ail doubt will be gone, and we can -confidently affirm that we are in possession -of His wonderful gift. Immediately on His ? ooming the cleansing by the blood of Jesus ?will be realized and the consciousness that ?we are every whit made whole will be .sweetly realized. And ' whom the Son doth set free shall be free indeed.' All doubt and care and fear will depart and we .shall feel prepared to 'do exploits' for -God. All work will then be done in Him -and for Him, and every obstacle to success -will be removed. Our preaching will be with unction, and, aside from its quality .being much better, will be more appreciated by the hungry people, whom we have been -.feeding on husks. Revivals will become .common and life in the Church will displace v -deadness and formality which , now so : abound. Surely the chief want of the Church .now is the gift of the Ho!y Ghost.
