ISfEW YIEWS OF GHOSTS. fy&JLY; SEWS.) , There'is a split in the Psychical Society. One of the secretaries, Mr. Myers,holds one theory of our ghostly friends, another is put forward in the ^Proceedings of the Society by the other secretary,-; Mr.Podmore. We think that Mr. position that the people who do see the ghosts are " awfuUeers. " -: Mr. Myers thinks that the ghosts are J ' dea.d men's dreams," which .they' impress oh the minds of the living,- somewhat as ideas are impressed by lrring hypotasers.on the mindsof hypnotic patients,.; This, at least, is the "way: in which we try to understand/Mr. " " Ghosts walk, • indsod, but in their -TfiiB accounts for the fact, admitted by spntaHis, that, in the best authenticated stories, the ghoBts;; are ,-wandering, .-aimless,- objectless, inconsequent souls. Their appearances . axe like -the • visions -of a 'feverish dream.. Of conrpe, the theory.is not comfort- able. Better haTe no future at all, we.maysay, thana fature Gf vague delirium. But, as Mr. Myen3_ veiy iraseiy. remarks,: we-, know rlittle • about it.; Ghosts may not .alway s be'dreaming bad dreams; it maybe only those dreams that manage to reach such of us have' " the sinell; : for a ghost," which .is not a sense common to the majority'Pf mankind..: It would be a great deal to prove; that something, goes -on em:d.in rr after death; to prove it scieiitifically, for.faith is.a different matter, and rests 011 another hasis. But Mr.^Podmore is, more sceptical.: He does not think that. ghosts are; dead men walking ia their sleep, hut that they. are. hsllncina- . tipns, impressed -by one "living mind on another.'" Both scholars agree that one living mind can thus ; affect.anpther; they thin> their evidence And. experiments have demonstrated that. It is admitting a- good deal'; - and Miss .E.; believing she has seen a, ho usefolof ghosts; can. • by this beEef, make. Mr. :B.' see them ioo, ana that, though she never .eaw Mr.; B. ,- and is at. a distance ..from 2uzh, why, "anythingmay. happen.. We do not know how' to advise a lady to act who sees a .£ood many ghosts, like a -ladyfcaowntothe society. -Thereis difficulty on all sides. As an example, wie now tell briefly the stoiies,:first of Miss Morris, and- next of "the calm but emotional butler.": •. Mis^ Morris took a small house, we know-not where, m October, 18S2. On the first night of her tenancy : a heavy-footed ghost stumped up and - down tho drawingroom, .and was -inviabie. 'In three weeks - a pale • womani in black made her appearance. The door bell rang incessantly, and knocks were heard, hut nobody could be found at the door. Miss -Morris left the place; and Mrs. G. took it in 1SS7. Mrs. G. heard a sweet voice thrice remark, "Oh, do forgive me.'?'The children saw- a dreadful "white face peep through the door. \ Mrs. G. • explained this.to the infant mind a.3 a trick :pfeved by a.magic lantern. But the little girl again saw " a little old woman," and " often heard pitter- patter. Of course, magic lanterns could inot^^ do that," said the 3-oung philosopher. Mrs. G. should have advanced a theory of rats, but the " heavy thumps" in the house seemed beyond tlmt agency, v They learned that somebody had committed suicide in the houBe, but as a, policeman reminded them, -uncomfortable things have occurred- in-'most houses. : -Lights and-white skirts, where no eki'rts should be, .and a" man with" freeklesi, :ind some one who cried, and a figure in' black, and a, white figure were-frequent visitors.- -.People offered savage, bull 1 dogs as. good for ghosts,: but. Mrs; G.. preferred the disease td; the remedy. Finally, the. house be-' came untenable, and Mrs. G." departed. Two human faces at her elbow TOre more than she could endure. Then some inquirers-tried the hoiise, and a clergyman exorcised the ghoBts, which seems to have " put -them down" a,good 'deaL. Now, is it not . just . as-likely that these apparitions " were ..dead -.people's ."dreams - (Mr." Myers's notion).- as that the' ghosts .seen by Mrs. G. were.startedhy the thoughts, of Miss Morris, ivhich is an- hypothesis of Mr. Podmore's? . Mr.Myers juEtIy;ob5erves that if we are to be driven out of house, and' hoineby the reflections.of somebody at a distance, "the peace of all of us rests on a sadly uncertain tenure," But we are not much better. off, really, if ourpeace rests on the nightmares of Now for: Mr. Z.?s butler. "He came tb -Mr. Z. on21stOctober, IS85,: He had not been'in t}:<: house for three diiyt; -before'he .heard?' a .row on the premises.".; ail King Valoroso remarked. The row waii in 'thecellar,;also -:in the pantry, th'e hauntedpantry.': Pruifles would have.suggested "robbers," bnt he was the hutleiofa'^^tificgenHemaji, 'ThenMr;Z.'s butler saw'a .figore "in a.hrown .garment withtwo t^els.h&CTg; on the leftside; her. igure vras^^'peiiect with the exfception Pf a head which: .1 could" not see, as it. ajipeared to me like a black mist:.
