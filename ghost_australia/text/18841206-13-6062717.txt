It was, in the words of ono of the critics, a " magnetic" performance, full of vehe- mence, impulse, and impetuosity. It was ' " rapid, emotional, hysterical, *' passionate, and restless " to excess, wo should imagine. Its vigour was almost melodramatic ; and in the artist's determination to avoid the funereal 'solemnity, the pompous de- clamation, and extremo staginess of some favourite "Hamlets" in tho past, to give adequate effect to the Prince's " wild and whirling words," and to justify his boast that ho can " rant " as well as Laertks, Mr. Baruktt seems to have been almost boisterous in his portrayal of violent and "splonetive" emotion. The more material " business " of tho tragedy was entirely new. The play scene is enacted upon an ojien platform in tho gardens of the castle, illuminated by torches, and with the light of the full moon shimmering on the summer sea in the distance ; and on his way to the place selectetl for the entertainment, Hami.kt delivers his admonition to the actors. While " Tho Mouse " trap " is in progress, tho Prince does not throw himself upon the ground, in full view of the Kino and Qui kn, where his antic conduct and vigilant scrutiny of their countenances could not fail to attract their attention, but with- draws to " a moro removed ground," and, seated by the side of Orín I ia, quietly watches the eflect of the pet formance upon the susnected murdeier of his father. And when the abrupt dispersion of the royal jiarty and their attendants takes place, Hamut leaps upon the deserted stage-erected on the very spot whore the Ghost alleges the assassination to havo taken place-and gives vent to his pent up excitement in thosewild, disjointed exclamations which the dramatist makes him utter to his old fellow-student and ti usted friend In the second scene of tho third act, where the two characters professionally known as "the Knife and Fork," from their always coming in together, "go " about to recover the wind" of Hamm i, nnd he takes from one of tho pla) ers a lecoider to illustrate and emphasise his detection of the puiposo foi which BoshNORANr/ and Gun dknsti'rn have sought an interview with lum, ho cour- teously returns the instalment to Hokatio, instead of snapping it across his knee, after tho manner of some muscular Hamlets So, too, in the closet scene Mr. Barm- ti dispenses alike with the figures on the tapestiy and with the two lockets He himself wears " the counterfeit presentment " of his dead father, and caresses it continually during the play, as if it served to whet tho edge of his determination to avenge that father's death ; but the Prince acci- dentally catches sight of tho present «overeign's portrait on the Queen's prie-ilieu, and this suggests the com- parison between tho two brothers, which Hamlet draws with so much scorn and vituperation ; and when he arrives at the climax of his passionate objurgation and reproach, the Prince dashes the obnoxious picture to the ground, and grinds it to pieces boneath his heel. Again, in an earlier scene, a burst of merriment in an adjoining room precedes and justifies the exclama- tion, " That it should come to this ! " But two months dead ; nay, not so " much ;" while throughout the play, it would appear there was a commend- able avoidance of point-making, and of those tricks that are ofton resorted to for the purpose of eliciting a burst of applause when the curtain falls.
