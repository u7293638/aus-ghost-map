KEV. MR. IIA WEIS. TOB Kev. Mr. HAWBIS filled the hall of the School of Arts every evening he lectured, and 'generally speaking, he produced a pretty favourable impression upon his audiences. I heard him, and was somewhat disappoin- ted. Knowing that be was a popular preacher in London, that he attracted large congrega- tions every Sunday in that city, I expected to find that he was either an orator or a thinker. But bo is neither. He speaks at railway speed, and the consequence is that manyofhiswordsare imperfectly pronounced. Nor does he pay much attention to the recog- nised rules of rhetoric There is no continuity in his discourses ; he jumps about sometimes in the most extraordinary manner. As for the matter, it is superfluous. Mr. Haweis doea not go in for deep sulking. His dis I course on spiritualism and ghosts, for example (Sir William Windeyer heard it), was merely mainly a resume of opinions expressed by writers on the subject ; it con- tained the skimmings of Andrew Lang's book. The lecturer's remarks on these opinions were exceedingly common place. There are scores of people in New South Wales who could deliver more entertaining and instruc-. tive lectures than Mr. Haweis. Physically, the reverend gentleman is not much to look at. He is about oft. 4in. in height, and is so lame that when he walks it is necessary for bim to use a stick. There is nothing of the parson in his appearance ; certainly, there is not in his clothes, for he lectures in a con- ventional dress suit. The single stud in his shirt is a prodigious affair. In theology Mr. Haweis belongs to the Broad Church school.
