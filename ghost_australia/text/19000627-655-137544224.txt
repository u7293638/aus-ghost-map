INDIAN SUPERSTITIONS. The Bhattia women are vfiry superstitious. They believe in ghoata, demons, and other supernatural beings ; and to drive all theso out of the house in Â£he evening (for it is just before the lamps are lighted that all these evil spirits come into the houBe) a woman strikes a light and goes into each room and shows it in every dark eorner.and the spirits, who are supposed to have a greut dislike to any kind of light, go quietly out of the house. Another custom ia that they will not eat until a portion of their food ia set apart for the cow, whom they all worship. They believe that their food will turn into poiaon if this is not dono ; and one of the women or a servant takes it out and gives it to a cow if one is in sight, or leaves it on one aide of the road. But the moat unnatural custom that they have is that they nsver use the name ' mother ' when speaking of or to their own mother, but they call her Bhabhi, which means sister-in-law. Littlo children, as well as grown up sons and daughters, call her ao ; and the sweet name of ' mother ' ia never heard in thoir homes. Again, a woman will never say ' my son,' but in speaking of him will say ?' tho husband, or brother, or nephew of So-and-So.' The first time a Bhattia woman saya ' my son ' is after that son iB dead. She believes that if she calls him so while he liveB a certain goddess will get so jealous of her that she will strike him dead at once.
