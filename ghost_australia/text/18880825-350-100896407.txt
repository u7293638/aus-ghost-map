lakes' Column. Outside the Party, Thick throng the snow flakes, the evening is dren ry, S'Jl Glad ring's the music in yonder gay ball ; On her- who listens here, friendless nnd weary, Heavier chill than the wintciVdoth fall. At yon elcar window, light-opened before me, 0 lances the ftite I have worÂ»hipped so well j There's tliu line gentleman, -grand in bis glory ; ( Ihere the fair smile by whose sweetness i fell. This is akin to him, shunned and forsaken, I That at my besom sobs low, without breail j Had not such,pleudiug. my marble heart shaken, 1 had been ^uict, long since, with the dead, Oh ! eouH I enter there, ghastly nnd squalid, Stand in men's eyes with my spirit o'er borne, Show them where roses bloomed, crushed now nnd pallid, What be found innocent, leaving forlorn How the fair ladies would fail'from their dances, j Trembling, aghast at my horrible talc I Jlow would he shrink fro in my words and my glances ! How would they shrink from him, swooning and pule ! This is the hair that was soft to enchain him ; Snakelike, it snarls on my beautiless brow ; These are the hands that were fond to de tain him With it sense-magic then, powerless now J No j could I come, like a ghost, to affright him, ' : s How should that heal my wound, silence my pain! Had I the wrath of God's lightning to smite him, That could not bring me my lost peace again. Ne'er lat him grieve while good fortune be tide him, Ne'er count again the poor game lost of old ; When he comes forth, with his young bride beside him, Here snail they find tis both, dead' iri the eold.
