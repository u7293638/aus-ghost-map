'One Who Likes Justice to All.'— We cannot publish your letter nnless you send your name. 'Frances S. Wright' writes :— 'I thank Canon Green for his invitation, but before I accept it I should like to know what he teaches as ' the things which a Christian ought to know and believe for his soul's health.' Are these things the blessing of candlesticks, how to bold a cros3 in processions, when to bow, and other snch nonsense? If the3e be the things essential to the soul's health I prefer to remain ignorant of them as things which tend rather to the destruction of spiritual woiship. If he means the worship of saints and angels 1 may tell the Canon (I am a Protestant, as he pr- fesses to be) that I worship only the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost, but not the host of Heaven. Canon Green refers to Colossians ii. 18 as furnishing authority for the worshipping of angels. I am amazed at Mr. Green. Is it possible he does not know the passage condemns the worship which the Canon countenances? I recommend to him the perusal of 2 Peter iii. 16, and advise him for the future not to wrest the Scriptures. I would also refer him to the following passages, and ask him how he reconciles these with the adoration of angels :— Revelation xix. 10 and xxii., and Romans i. 25. It grieves me to see a Pro testant minister copying the fashions of the Romi-h Chnich. I can respect the Church of Rome because of its open avowals, but that a professedly Pro testant Church should harbour in its bosom those who seem to direct their efforts to Romanize the Church stirs my soul with loathing.' 'A. B. C.'— The fly leaf you have sent has reached our hands. We regret we have not space to put it in full. ' A Subscriber' re forest trees has not sent bis name. VEnfleld' writes in reference to a paiagraph which appeared in this paper headed 'Constant Cropping' as follows:— 'This paragraph appearing in your paper is very misleading. Does your re porter suppose that the crop of wheat be mentions as being 6 feet high is a specimen of growth from land that has been constantly cropped without manure for forty years ? It would have been wiser for your reporter to have made enquiries from the proprietor, when he would have ascertained that the wheat-crop mentioned is upon land that has betn resting for years ; in fact the village cricket ground and the barley crop is a very good illustra tion of the beneficial effecte of rotation of crops with manure. With the exception of these small patches the farm shows unmistakable evidence of having been cropped for forty years without manure.' ^Wonna.'— The only division was on the ques tion that £14,000 should be struck out and £10,000 be inserted, in which Dr. Cockburn voted for re taining the full amount, and Mr. Rounseiell for firing itat £10,000. ?
