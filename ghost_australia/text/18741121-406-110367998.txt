LETTERS TO THE EDITOR. IT IS NOT A FACT. SiB)—In your issue of 18th,\N«yember, ap pears a lelter signed "Justice," pretending to. put " Walking Gbost " on tbe right track. I never saw a greater piece of injustice pub lished under the signature of "Justice " than when he pretends to enlighten the Burgesses of Jvadina and Moonta as lo tbe amount of salary each Town Clerk has received since 1872\. If " Justice " will reverse the amounts, he will find £139 or within a few shillings, is just the amount the Town Clerk of Moonta has received. "Justice" having made a statement con* trary to truth against one, if not two public servants, I trust he will at once retract or substantiate what he has written, and under his proper signature, and give the amounts which the Kudiua Corporation has paid for assessments, independent of salary and office accon modation, then, I will give tbe total amount' Daid to the Town Clerk of Moonta : lint will answer no anonymous writer. —I am, ' G. T. CEUTCHETT, Town Clerk of Moonta.
