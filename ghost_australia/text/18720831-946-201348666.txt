A slight glance at his wretched garb and haggard appeararico was f-.ufficient to determine his quality, and the stranger raised his 'cane again. ? ; ;': '.Another of the gang,' he said. ' ' How dare you molest a gentleman in this manner, you rascal '? Follow your friend there, directly, or' I'll ' ? ' Toit'd better -not strike me, Mr. Roebiick,' interrupted Tliornway. 'It might be worse fo-r yon, perhaps.' ? ' What do you nsean bytafeingtomo like that, fellow ?' cried the stranger, ? drawing' -himself up stiffly. ' *Mr. Roe- i buck, indeed ! Can't you see you are speaking to anoffieer and a gentle man ?'' ' , ' '; ' ' .V' No, I-ean't,' said Thornway, more | than ever convinced that he was right ;.\ ' and it won't do to ride the high' horse ? with me,Ican tell'you. What's become of the money you bolted with ?'' ; ' Really, the insolence «f these vulgar people1 is getting past endurance,' soliloquised the officer. 'I won't demean myself by laying hands on you, you scoundrel ; but you may think yourself well off that there's not a police man in sight.' ' ' '?'.'' , 'Don't you scoundrel me,' cried ,:Thbrnway- growing excited, and, pre disposed ' to be over-amiable' in his mood ;' ' and as for a.poUcemarii if you goon like this, I shall just walk by 'your side till one comes . up, and then give you in charge, that's all. \ I can .swear; to you, for all your fine coat and 'flash airs.' . .... . '! ' , . Several persons passing'. during this conversation, looked: - round ' at the parties. More than one i* stopped . to ? ? ??-.-.? ??..-! '? ...'?' : listen, but proceeded when the officer looked up with a defiant glance., That gentleman, however, began to find his situation unpleasant ; the crowd was beginning to increase, and ho knew it would continue to swell., Fortunately, no one had yet passed to, whom he was known; but he was not safe .for ah in-' stant, and to bo seen, even by strangers, in conversation with a person of Thorn way's appearance; must, be avoided at all hazards. ? Moreover, Thornway talked loudly, as people who are irri tated are apt to do. . Ho was,' besides, not particularly select in his choice of enithets, and it was rather too. much to hope that every person who passed them would bo deaf. His . annbyer was evi dently not to be blustered down, nor got rid of. .The officer^paused an ij stant, and then decided. 1-T .'.''''!'. 'My good man,', he. said 'in a mild tone; f you are ? evidently , laboring under some' strange mistake. If you will follow mo to my ofSce, which is not far off, I have no doubt wb shall soon set it 'right.' ,' '';.'; ' : ' With all my heart,' replied' Thorn- way, who looked. upon the proposal as the first step towards a compromise; '.anywhere you like.!. You be reason able, and you'll find me so. 'I : want nothing but what's right, I don't.' . '.' This way, then,' said the stranger ; ' and perhaps— you'll excuse me— you .would not mind keeping a litto behind as we walk. I don't wish to hurt your feelings; but there is a little difference in our dress, you see.' 'Yes, yes, I know I'm pretty seedy,' replied Thornway rather sulkily. 'Very well, you go a-head. .Only, don't you try to dodge mo, you know ; or I'll run after you, and ' cry ' stop thief.' . You may look, but I will ; sec if I don't.' ' The officer did not condescend to make , any reply to this . menace, but sauntered away with a disengaged air, tapping his boot with his cane as ho went'along, and occasionally raising his glass as a carriage of more than ordi nary pretention rolled by. When they had quitted tho park, however, he as sumed a more business pace ; and after a variety of short cuts and' turnings, during which he looked back more tbari; once, and a slight expression of. disap pointment seemed. to rest on bis features as he observed his companion steadily, following his track' a few feet in the rear, he at last came to a pause. On the door at which he halted was a large brass plate, whereon was engraved in conspicuous characters, ' GreatTran satlantic New Water-land Emigration Company, . Major ' Chevreuil, agent.' The officer admitted himself with a key and left' the door open for Thornway to follow.1 ' Losing no time' in doing so, the latter roand himself in a. smell room, neatly fitted up as an office, having a library table in the centre, covered with a pro fusion of papers. An easy chair was placed near it, and half-a-dozen others, arranged round the room. ? A large map of New Waterland covered the principal wall ; and a board, with notices of the departure of various vessels, stood over the fire-place. The owner threw himself into the easy chair, and turning to reqnest Thornway to take a seat likewise, per ceived that ho had alrencly done so. He paused a moment, and then with a short prefatory cough, observed — ' Now there's no' fear of eaves-droppers, and we may say what wo please. You arc a sharp follow, Thornway ; a man won't throw dust into your eyes very easily— I don't wish to, in fact ; and though if yon, cutting the fingor you do, were to try your hand at establishing an identity between Major Chevreuil and a certain scrubby fellow in the provinces, com monly called or known by the name of ' Roebuck,' whom no decent person ever heard of, I should get the case laughed out of court in ten minutes ; yet I don't mind giving a cognovit, as wo used to say— -admitting the fact, I mean. You don't understand law. And now friend Thornway, what is it you want, that made you pitch into me in that remark ably, gentlemanly way in the park.' ; Tliornway, who had not expected Biich 'a' sudden change of tactics, felt, as nau tical men say, 'rather taken aback.' After a moment's pause, ho observed, ' As I said before, I wants nothing- bnt what's fair.' 'That is an exceedingly indefinite term, my' good fellow,1' replied tbeninjor; ' a very comprehensive phrase, like our legal one of' hereditaments.' A trades man thinks it fair to sell currant leaves fo: tea, aii'l logwood juice for port wine; a soldier thinks it fair to shoot a man in the back whom he never saw before, because his officer tells him he is an enemy ; and people think it fair to call this a piece of bravery, and hang another man the next day for doing the same thing at home. A doctor thinks it fair to .roll up the tenth part of a farthing's worth of tread into pills, and charge his patient a guinea for them ; a barrister thinks it fair to assure a jury that his client is the innocent victim of a vile con spiracy, though he has just had his confession that he is guilty of ihe crime' he is charged with. What is fair, indeed? Tlroro is but one rule, Tliornway, by which sensible men judge of what is fair, and that is, everything is fair which helps you to what you want, and every thing is unfair which deprives yon of it. Now, to come back to business, what is it that you want ?' ' Why, I want the means to get a livelihood,' replied Thornway ; ' that's the long and tho short of it. But, what's more to the point with you, I suppose, I want victuals to eat, and I want. beer and tobacco. I havn't broken my fast these three blessed days ; I bavn't had a pipe in my mouth I don't know when, and it would be more than victuals to me; and as for drink, I havn't been able to get a single drop all the week, exc.ept one pint as I got for holding a gent's horse while he went into Doctor's Commons : and I'm half dead for the want of it. Now, you'know you walked' off the money from our Union-box ? -'' : 'A very pretty leading question that/* interrupted the major, with an easy laugb ;.' an Old Bailey lawyer could not have put it better. Bnt just let me dis abuse your mind of that idea, friend Thornway, before we go any farther. My private affairs called me rather sud denly from Stamford while I was secre tary to. the strike — somo very pressing business, in fact, which we need not go into now— and I had not time to go through the accounts with the committee of. management. They were very com plicated, indeed ; and as I said, I conld not spare the time. But I had made heavy advances out of my own pocket — the poor men were starving, and I had my feelings ; and if I were to look up my vouchers, I think — indeed I have no hesitation in saying, I aui sure — I should bring the society into iny debt. But the thing is all over now, and I don't want to bo hard upon them, so I have made up my mind to let the matter drop.' « But ? -' began Thornway: ' Don't interrupt mo for a moment,'^ pursued the major. '1 was only going to say that, in tho first place you were not one of the committeo, and have therefore no right to ask mo for any account at all ; and then, waiving that, point, I wonld call your attention to tho^ fact that you have no list of either bit receipts or expenses — that you could) neither read nor understand them if yon had — that you cannot prove that I owe the committeo a shilling, and that not. ? .:. being a niember/ypu/i* wonldiyimTO no .....right to receive! it,j;uf I did-^-th'at, in point of fact, you knp/w nothing ., at /all about the mattei^thatsomebbdy lias' put some idle stiiiTinto ''your lfe'ad, which you have not I ho least shadow of 1 . ?evidence to sustain, and that the sooner yon sponge ib out the? better .XHa'ririg.j said this much; — and, injustice Ito |my! own character, I could not say less — I ;.'!swill:-,now:add ;:. that thongfcl-dcny.ryour ?claim:,\ip.on(..mp,)??j.;ioio £ am willing to do a litcle'to help a townsman in distress. ~THer?:i3%'alf-d- biwh'-'fdr''tIie:-pfesBrit.'' i.!rThat,willfbny;you,,a rsupper, .an^ -allow. ^j.i'ior,a pipe and :a.gJass,.of grog. at tho..Nend | _t.jqF it. .,; Asjfor.thc-. future, I if,, ypu/.dpn'it; rTimind .doing at-^wliich ,,I jsuppospj/you jjv,don't— r;I-want a,porter,.just to;sit;in 'the, ??f/ientily,.and.;takQ.niessagoswlien,1I happen ;,,-.to be ,ou t. ., i , It, will bd'something:,to,keep '. ;?; 7y0Hr'l1ead.:abqy'o nwater,.. at..- alLjCvents, f -till a,;«bottpr. th'ing^.turns.VjnpI' '/iSindj T*-letrmo see- Tryo'u would, (rather, astpnislr 1} my. clients, if they.sa'wj.you in.thatjtriin j' c- but/we^aro.something, of -a jsize, '/and f, -?sjdare; say J.could find ,a fe'iw.f old, ./clothes' .u^that wonld.makeyonjook.a;littWdec,ent.' .^'??Whafcr.dpiypa say,;?',,; -,,!/(.? : -/l a (;/?,/? \'i ?.,, ? ,.-Thjs .turn.of^affairs.w.as.s.o^snperipr to, ? h7 what fThprnway rhad,, calculated / upoh-j-j'j T.;..,ihis..most. sanguine {iibpes ihaxing-^been ; ^?confined :t0r,the ; extraction .rp'fr, some, inir, ,;; - mediate..,rolief -f rpin^either, Richard. ; lloe jr,-.*.bnck!s .fears pr)..|cornpassiou.,tbat,. there f.T;,was-positive\ thankfulness, , in., iis.j'.tone,^ ^?..-.'as lie;.i;eplied :-rj- ?.; i:'.:i-'r'.-;r;:t:\\-toi\'V I ?!, ..;; -. ;,'-I'm;isure ,I',m-,muqh.j)bliged to,,, you;;1 -Master, ,Epebuck.f'T ,.,?,,..,..'.;!,.,.,,' ^.[..
