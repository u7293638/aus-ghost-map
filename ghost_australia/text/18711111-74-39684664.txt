BA.NKRUPTCY CourT.-The only business at this Court yesterday was that of R. Chaf foy, of Noew Ground, Port Soroll, contractor. The bankrupt was not present. There had boon several adjournmente, and, on the appli cation of Mr Powell, who appeared for the banltrupt, the Commissioner dismissed the petition of the creditor, at whose instance Chaflby was declared bankrupt, thus teormina ting the bankruptcy. RATE DEFAULTERS.-At the Mayor's Court yesterday, about fifty cases were investigated and dealt with. It was intimated that unless all outstanding amounts were immediately paid, executions would be at once issued. HANDICAP SHOOTING MATCH.-We learn that it is in contemplation to hold a Grand Intercolonial Handicap Pigeon Match on the Monday of the race week, next February. Some of our crack shots are moving in the matter, and doubtless more will shortly be heard respecting it. IECHANICS' INSTITUTE. - On Monday aevening the pupils attending MIr Abrahbam e .Barrott's Collegiate Institute will give an en. Stortainment in the large hall of the Meohe e nice' Institute, for the purpose of assisting Mr and Mrs T. N. Ford-to whoso clver acnoting Sthe public of Launcston have been indebted for several evenings' amusementt-to leave for SMelbourne. The entertainment will consist of recitations, songs, and duets, and the.farces " Robin Rouanhbend, and (by desire) ", "Tweedloton's Tail Coat." The young gentle men have been in active rehearsal for some Stime, and a pleasant evening's amuosemont a may be anticipated. 'RACE MEETING AT LONGFORD. -- We learn that there is every prospect of the Longford Annual Race Meeting being revived in all its pristine glory. Of late years this meeting has fallen off to a mere farce; but, stimulated by the example of the Tasmanian Turf Club, the sporting men of Longford and the vicinity are determined to make an effort this season. A considerable sum in subscriptions has already been promised. No time has yet been definitely fixed, but the Longford men know what they are about, and if they really want a good day's sport they will fix upon a day within a week after the T. T. C. Autumn Meeting, and before all the horses attracted to Tasmania by that event have taken their flight. SUNDAY S 00noo Ls AND TUN RAILWAY.-FOr two or threeoyeara past most of the Laonueston 1 Suntday schoola have looked 'forwiard to th, opening of the railway, as affoIding a itnmple( and screoablo solution to the annual dillloulty -mwhat to dbfo~ theo childron'd?'trpat. It was ( tlhought that at a small cost an excursion into the country by rail might be secured for a large number of children who would other. wise be deprived of the luxury. Those expootations, however, are not likely to be realised just yet, unless the Directors of the Company are willine to modify their terms considorably. In response to enquiries made on behalf of somen of the schools, a rednuced tariff has boon pro posed, but one that is not sufficiently low to render it available. The funds of a Suuday school, almost exclusively dependent on its annual collections, are necessarily limited, and would never permit ofat from one to two shillings a head being paid for a irailway ex carsion. AS, the ordinary trains would be emnployed, with perhaps an extra second- class carriange, it is thought a very sanill clharge might be made, and whatever it, yielded would be so much gain to the Company. There are ten or a dozen schools in Laun ceston, comprising some two thousand children, which would probably avail themseolves of the railway for their annual treat if the -cost was such as they could afford; and there are many similar schools in the various districts traversed by the line that would be equally glad to employ it in this way. It has been suggested that a 'doputation of superintendents and other oflicers of the Launceston Sunday Schools should wait on the Directors to give expression to their views, and we have no doubt there would be every disposition on the part of the Company to meet what may fairly be des cribed as the public wish in this matter. THE BIuTISi FLAO Res'ECTEr. - The Scotsman tells a story which might have been of some value to Lord Granvillo when repudiating the idea of " the efficement of England." It seems that a Scotch resident in Paris, who had very reluctantly to desert his shop when the siege commenced, happily bIethought himself that in a country where no spurious flags or ensigns are allowed the "Union Jack" would be respected. Accord ingly, alter locking up, and with a heavy heart taking leavp of his property, he hoilted the British standard over the house. Whoen the gates of the beleagured city were par tially opened after the capitulation hu returned to the scene of his operations, and was delighted to find that his whole property "goods and gear," remained untouched, while other houses and shops in the locality had been thoroughly ransacked, even the floors being torn up in the search tor hidden treasure. An American who had neglected to float the stripes and stars had upwards of Â£240 worth of silver plate and other valuables carried off. AN EXTaAORDINARY AnvaRTISeoERNT. "HELP FOR TIE HO.LY SouLs.-All who compassionate the sufferings of the souls in purgatory will assist the Rev. Fr.

Francis J. Kirk, 6, Upper Leeson-streeto, Dublin." i reemtan's Jotrnal, Aug. 3. STANLEY.-On the 3rd inst., Miss Lambert, oldest daughter of lMr C.D. Constable Lambert, who is about to leave Circular Head with her parents, was presented by the Rev. Charles Sanders, on behalf of the Wesleyan congregation here, with a very a handsome case made by Mr Thomas Fleet King of the various woods grown at Circular Ioead, and an album as a memento of affectionate regard and pome slight recogni tion of her valuable services cheerfully ren dared in playing the harmonium in the church for a considerable period. TRINITY CHURCH.-We remind our readers that the parishioners of St. Paul's Church are invited to attend Trinity Church to- morrow, as St. Paul's will be closed in consequence of the alterations being made there, and the Ss morning offertory will be appropriated to the St. Paul's Church Building Fund. There will be full choral servico both morning and evening by tile united choirs of both clhro;yes. WOOL IN CALtFORNNA.-A conSidslojable a trade in wool between the Eastern Coast of a Australia and California "looms in the 0 future." The Cit of Adelaide, on her last trip to San Francisco, took 250 bales, and it was then generally supposed that the fac t tories in the enterprising state of California 1 were supplied with wool fronm the London market. Being under this impression, we Y pointed out the possibility of our wool being shipped direct across the Pacific, and as the a railroad ran from the port of arrival to New I York, the saving to the American mnnufac a turer would be suficient to induce him to lpurchaso in the Australian colonies rather a than send to England for hIis supplies. a From the San Francisco Bulletin we learn tilat a larger amount of wool is produced in California than is generally asup. posed, but the quality of Australian wool will create for it a large demand. The Bulletin says :-" Most, if not all, of the wool con sumed by our factories is grown in California. The wool clip of tlis State is this year not less than 12,000,000 to 14r,000,000 lbs., and we shall send a largo proportion of it to tihe Atlantic States, whither tile Australian slhit. ments, which we lhople may increase, will also be forwarded. It is true, however, that n Scertain amount of Ausctralian wool is in di mand hero, on acc:ount of its long staple. Tse t friendly expression of the Sdney .dlorning HIerald, in respect to reciprocity, will be cor dially responded to by the people of California." S-Sydeey .lorning iferald. s Dn LVINerSTONs.-? e seo by an English Spaper thlat Sir Itlo'orick Murchison has received a i letter from Dr Kirk, at Zanzibar, dated July 19, 1871, l,' which hlie stlates:-" I casd, I regret to say, ' ire no farther accounts of Livingstone. What Slast I wrote about his visit to that ltillo*kowa pIlace aaest of .Tageanyika is confirmed, and the Arabs froms that quarter seem to count him quite one of the residents of those places. There is certainly no ill-feeling on the part of tile Arabs to himt. The little jealousy they seeu to have shoen at first lhas passed off, and I sent a letter a few days ago by the firslt caravan of the season to Ujiji. Do. not despair.

ExpLosIvE CoMrorrrNDs?-A correspondoat of Nature, in endeavoring to explain the hitherto unoxplained traginal explosion of gun. cotton at Stowmarlcet, asuggests that possibly it wnoa ooasioned by the fall of a meteoloric steno.
