State of Italy. (LONDON Universe.) The Holy Father is frequently blamed by those who are ignorant of the true state of affairs in Italy for not making some effort to arrive at an understanding with the Italian Government. Mr. Wilfrid Ward, in an article he has just published in the Fortnightly, does good service by exposing the nature of the religious and educational policy of the Government with which the Pope is invited to form a working alliance. Here are some extracts from the official text book of a girl's training college: " Speech is a great means of education. Christ, Mahomet, and Luther used no other to awake the conscience of the people. Christ, Mahomet, and Luther were great artists—as Galileo, Descartes and Darwin were great in science. People begin by frightening children, threatening that they should be eaten by hobgoblins if they are not good, or carried off by witches; they speak to them of good or bad spirits, of guardian angels who watch by their beds, of the dead who return from the other world, and they imagine thus to correct their defects and make them better—they wish to make them reasonable by taking them along the road of folly. If you wish that a child should be convinced that he was born under a head of cabbage, that Punch had seven-leagued boots, that there is one God in three Persons, that Heaven is inhabited by angels, hell by demons and the damned, the ceilings, stairs, and chimneys peopled by ghosts, you will not find it hard to persuade him if you seem to believe it yourself." Even the British Nonconformist would object to religious instruction of this type.
