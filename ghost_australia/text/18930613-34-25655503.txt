Trumble In the last match tha men who stood oat were Walter Giffen, Turner, and Jarvis. Bannerman won the toss and elected to bat upon a good wicket, the pioneers as usual being Lyons and Bannerman. The South Australians at once began to score rapidly, while the captain played the cautious game for which he is so famous. Just after 30 had been posted, however, Bannerman tipped a ball which was smartly taken behind the wickets, I and he retired with 11 to his credit. ! Giffen came next but did not stay long,' as in trying to steal sn impossible run he | was promptly dismissed before he had scored, the score standing at 31 runs for two wickets. Trott and Lyons did their best to re trieve the disaster, and both batsmen putj on runs very rapidly. Lyons in particular showed dashing cricket, while at the same time his hits were very safe. Kortright was very fast in the field, while O'Brien on two different occasions made brilliant attempts to get at some of the hard strokes by which Lyons sent the ball flying to the boundary. At last, however, when the giant had compiled 83 runs, O'Brien had his reward, and a, great innings came to an end. Throughout bis stay at the wickets Lyons manifested no change in the con fident manner in which he faced the bowling, and until the hit that proved fatal he made no mistakes, while he did not give the ghost of a chance.
