It is a limited day—a ?rv/ . t3bv, bar only a day. How very limited life is in many instances! How many are born '?•; but never reach complete manhood! The V/;"V". thought of death has often hronght men to /" / ' •decision.

" 7' A word, however, of eucouragement before r.V . - we leare this point; it is a time of promise, 77\. -lor when God saith to o man, " Come to3Ie v7 V at a by that very word th**™ r/1' — - nn engagement to meet him.

Place the emphasis yi/.f'-' up011 word His. Eemembcr that the ^ . ^Troice of God is the voice of authority. God ^y'ybaa aririit tospeakto you; shall the creature xefnse to hear the Creator ?.

Tf the Queen were to command you into i# :,&er; presence at each an hour, I warrant • that you would be there before the time . rather than after it. It is an insult to superiors when we lake no notice of their appointed "tiznes, batkeepthemvraitingonr will andplmure. -The Lord has a right to fix His \- • own lime for doing His deeds of Grace. Be c J, not so daring, so profane, so crnel, ns to talk " -of delay when the Divine message lays euch stress on your immediate attention, saying, "To-day, if ye will hear His voice." Jf this strain should not affect the conscience, let me try another. The voice here spoken of is the voice of love. How wooing are its tones! The Lord in Holy Scripture speaks of mercy and of pardon bought with blood, the blood of His dear Son. Q'.mnn, He calls you to Him, not that He may day you, but that He may save you. He does not summon you to a prison, but be invites you to a banquet. God speaks not as judge, but as Father; not as from Sinai, but from Calvary: "Come, now, and 1st us reason together, saith the Lord; though your sins be as scarlet -they shall be as white as snow." "Comounto Me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest." Do not be cruel to almighty love! Be not ungenerous to eternal pity! Eemember, too, that this is the voice of power. This is a sweet thought fcr those of yon who arc without strength. You.will perhaps say, "J cannot turn unto God;" hut He can turn you. Ton lament that you cannot f-rcl as you would wish; He can give, you every gracious feeling. ' God's voice - alone created the world; He spake the uni verse out of nothing; dad when darkness enwrapped it He said,' 'f Light be," and light was; -He who spake thus in nature can thus speak in,grace, and work salvation in you. The text warns you against hardening your heart, and if you will listen to the voice of God it will soften your heart. "His voice brcoketh the cedars of Lebanon ; His voice maketh the hinds to calve"; so can His voice break yonr bard heart and causa your hesitating spirit to decide. Only, yield to ft; - yield to it now; the day may come when you will never hear it again.
