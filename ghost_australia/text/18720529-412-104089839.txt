NICHOLS. ["THE prisoner Nichols, on being asked if he had anything to say why sentence of death should not be passed upon him, said (almost inaudibly):--May-- may-- may it please your--. The remainder of the words was lost, for at that moment when he appeared to be about to pronounce the word 'Honor,' an involuntary but loud and deep-drawn sigh escaped him, and letting go his hold of the iron bars he fell heavily on the floor of the dock."--Empire's Report.] Pale as the ghosts of his slain, Wan as the faces he knew, Washed by the cold morning's rain, Dank with the death-struggle's dew; Clutching the bars as he stands, Terror and shame to his race, Then, loosed his murderous hands, Prone in the dock on his face. Well may he falter and fall, Monster with heart of a stone; Devil! full well may he call Hell to receive back its own. Man! all the faces around Glaring but horror and hate; Coward! afraid of the sound Knelling the murderer's fate. Or, is it worse than all these? Is it that there neither crowd, Jury nor Judge the wretch sees, But, in their watery shroud, Two swollen faces and forms, Two battered victims he thought Tossed by the wild winter's storms, Fronting him now in the Court-- Telling him soon they must meet, Pointing with shadowy beck, One to the stone at his feet, One to the noose at his neck! Or--but what matters the why-- Whether that river of gloom, The cold, cruel crime the death-cry, The dread of his deed or his doom? Hurry the ruffian from sight, Sunk beyond pity or hope, Deep in oblivion's night, Hanged with his own "robber's rope." F. H.
