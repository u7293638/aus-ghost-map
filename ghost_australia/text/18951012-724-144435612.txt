A SILLY PARAGRAPH. I A silly paragraph, or paragraphs appeared in the Telegraph on Monday last. Iiaving refer ence to the visit of the Premier to Parramatta on Saturday. It was stated that Mr. H. Taylor met tbe Hon. O. H. Held in the street and told him of the arrest of Crick aud Meafher. where* rx-n the Premier turned as white as a ghost, and dashed into the local telegraph office, and telephoned for particulani, and then darted citywards. As a matter of fact Mr. Beid knew before he got anywhere near Mr. Taylor, the facts. He had been into the telegraph office to send away a private wire, when Mr. Taylor spotted him as he hailed a cab. The ex-member for Parrarantta rushed I over, and effusively greeted Mr. RÂ»id, who to I one of onr reporters (standing a few feet away) ' seemed strangely cold and diplomatic. Mr. Taylor made some remark like 'I thought I something like this would happen,' a.'.d the | Premier then got into the cab and said to the driver ' Station.' This was pretty early in the afternoon. Tbe only wonder is that the usually careful Telegraph should have allowed anyone known to be incapable of giving a yarn straight, to ' pull tbeir leg ' (as Sir Julian mightaay). Needless to say, the Premier never turned white ; and the only episode worth mentioning was the not very wonderful haste, of an alderman to bask for a second or two in the warmth of what appeared to be a little reflected Prime-Ministerial glory.
