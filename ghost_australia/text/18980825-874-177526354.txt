THE £>HAKESP£ARE BALL. Tin: most, brilliant pageant ever seen in Melbourne was assuredly the Shakespeare Ball given in tin; Town Hall on Tuesday evening. Careful management and a theatrical consideration for display took tbe function far away from the ordinary fancy dress ball, and tbe result was a magnificent spectacle that would have reflected credit upon the most elaborately-prepared dramatic performance. This was especially appropriate, as the ball was given in aid of tbe dramatic charities. Although the fancy dresses of any and every period were permitted, most of the guests adopted the attire of the characters of the Master. Majestic Cleopatras sailed through the hall with queen-like grace looking for Antonies who were dancing with girls of other times and other manners. Katharine of Arragon seemed none the worse for her divorce, and thad apparently .seized the crown jewels by way of alimony. The ghost of Bamjuo had revisited the glances of the moon and fraternised with Macbeth over the banquet that was laid in the Victoria Coffee Palace, where Sir Walter Raleigh with Marie Antoinette, who had mounted her head for the occasion, a Melbourne City Councillor with Juliet, Othello with one of the witches in " Macbeth," and Romeo with Anna Bullen took ices and champagne cup with most up- to-date anachronism. Punctually at nine o'clock His Excellency the Administrator of the Government arrived with Lady Madden, the Misses Daisie, Ruby and Leslie Madden and Colonel Campbell, and were escorted to the balcony to view the preliminary pageants, which were at once commenced. Amid a blare of trumpets Queen Elizabeth, majestically represented by Miss Linda Raymond, took her seat under a canopy, and therefrom reviewed the materialised brain- creations of her trusty and wellloved subject, William Shakespeare. After this splendid spectacle a rustic dance was given, and was followed by a Shakespearian Minuet, both calling forth loud applause. These special revels beiug ended, the Vice-regal party came down to earth, and the regular programme of dances was begun. During the evening a special set of lancers was danced, the characters of each set being selected from the following plays : — "Love's Labours Lost—Mrs. D. V. Hennessy, Mrs. T. F. Hogan, Miss Deegan, Aliss Langford, Mrs. J. Levien, Mrs. T. F. Bride, Miss Hall, Miss Billings, and Messrs. A. E. Langford, Claude Hall, Dr. G. A. Symc, W. T. Brunton, L Deegan, T. F.

The platform had been prettily arranged as a stage, and here with much effect were displayed tahteaux vivanU from "As You Like It," "Macbeth," " Much Ado About Nothing " and "Antony and Cleopatra." The music for the dances,as well as the specially appropriate music for tbe tableaux, was supplied by Oyston's excellent band. The whole of the arrangements were perfect, and Mr. J. F. Deegan and his committee are to be congratulated for the admirable manner in which the whole display was carried out, nor should a word of praise be forgotten for Mr. Walter Raynham, whose long stage experience proved very valuable in the organisation of the procession and general spectacle, nd Mr. Kennedy, the business manager.
