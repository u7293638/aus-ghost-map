IBSEN AND HIS INTER- PRETERS. BY EDWARD J. HART. When a mortal well endowed with in- tellect, and with a sufficient measure of in- spiration to entitle him to be called a genius, rears his head among men, not alone his own birlhplice-be it town or hamlet-or Ins own uiiuonalit) feels the influence of Ins work ami thought Genius needs no pass port, but ranges the whole world free as air, here und there making captives and converts in IAIIIIS and among peoples well nigh undreamt of by the unnd whose enchantment hollis them last m thrall No most insiginhcent uniteioliing his little tram ot original i ele ia, no humblest student or rusty bookworm working in the obscnrili of laboratory or closet, but adels Ins tribute, however unconscioushy, and how ever small, to the intellectnal treisunes of minkind, thereafter to be sought and stlfted but when the genius product the birth of the travailing years steps into the arena, and disdaining the slower methods of the humbler toilers, speaks out with no uncertain voice that which in him is, the cultured of all lands pause to listen, and even Australia, lying somewhat on the track of the treasure fleets of thought, catches some echoes of the far off sound For twenty years and upwards the name of Henrik Ibsen has been familiar throughout the Scandinavian group of countries and the intellectual centres of Germany. 'The Nor wegians, the Swedes, and the Dines have instmctiiely recognised in him their greatest national poet and dramatist, ay and some thing more—one of their true national voices 'Hte dermans have not hesitated to draw comparisons between Ibsen and Goethe, and admit that since the passing of the author of Faust, the Norwegian's is the greatest figure that has occupied the stage of the Teutonic world of art When this re flection is compared with the fact that it is only within the last three or four years that London has awakened to the fact of Ibsen's existence one feels inclined to agree with Carlyle, when he said the English were frequently so far behind other nations as to imagine themselves in front But as it to atone tor this tardy recognition, the capital of the English speaking world is now showing the keenest interest in all that pertauns to Ibsen's life and writings Article follows article m the leading reviews and the battle nates loud and long between the Ibsenites ane the anti Ibsenites, recalling to mind the fierce controversy that arose many years ago between the admirers of Wagner and his detractors, before the great I'ltreutli com poser (to whom, m the world ot letters, Ibsen might well be li-»ni el) non Ins high sent in the Valhalla of musicians The student of Ibsen's dramas knows not whether to be most astounded al their loree and power then scathing satire, the e uiieatm ss and nobdil) oi purpose that underlies them, or tile sturtltiu originality ol ins toueep'ons. As Teutelsdrockh strips all creatures of their clothes, viewing humanity in its nakedness, so Ibsen strips society of its environment of hypocrisy, and charges with lance in rest against the social lies that masquerade as truth Holding with Goethe that 'no real circumstance is unpoetic so long as the poet knows how to use it, he seizes on subjects one would think the least amenable to dramatic treatment, and they are but is plastic in the hands of the master 'Thus in " An Enemy of Society" the whole action of the piece turns upon the fact that the hygienic baths of a town are built upon a sod teeming with pestilence Dow in ni) are there who would dare to attempt to v: ruc, or inning attempted tvotil 1 be ItWel) to carry to a successlnl issue a drama founded on batt oraiiiiie.e* iel the sc-ne m the tourtli act, wherein Dr Siockmiiui, the Iteroot the pim, cells n public meeting to announce his discover) of the iiisitutir) cou elmon ot tlie bitiis, lias b»en pronounced by one of the ab'cst of 1 uglish critics ti bo "one ol the most pou en ii I mid gciiuiuel) dramatic ti) it Ibsen lins ever written " Of "Ghosts, ' which has been aptly termed "the tragedy of heredity, there may be two opinions as to whether it is meit injnubm /utii len ible loree und usawiul palio» lu Helen Mung we lind a specimen ot womanhood the | nob luv ol whose ehuraetei, Hie hapless misery ot ulinse lut, goes nr to overcome the ieeleiie;eit repulsion unit some might enter tain, in spue ot its truth-or perhaps becmae eil it-toivniels the subject nt the phi) In "The Pillars of Society, which, in addition to being delightful reading, should prove an ex eellent acting drama, the plot partly turns upon ti rai Uval spéculai ion, uni one ot us i mel incidents is lint seueling ot a ship out of porr in an unseaworthi condition, mying to tile moral cowardice mu!
