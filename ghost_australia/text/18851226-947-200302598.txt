[For tho next six; months at; all ev.onts phe wicked 'stoneivallers'' have , ceased from troubling, and the weary reporter's in (the gallery of the Assembly are at ' rest. iThe titrie, honoured ceremonial which ^re Ireases the people's representative from their / arduous labours has been observed in accord f niton with dnniorifc' usimtg. and Mr. Stieaker I has Bmilingly shaken hands with a -number I of honourable members, -vishing no 'doubt I the wliile'in: his hea'rtof hearts that never I again may his eye be ' caught', by theirs,.

At beBt-.the measure' was'a mere i'stoj^gap,1 andj if u'paaaedi into lawi.; would 'certainly have, Kad. the effect ofidelaying .the. much needed, redisfecibution of the ! .electorates. Tie jbill was, moreover, , open -, to: ?; the i. grave objection that in an .underhand, sort of way it altered the existing constitution of ; Vic toria by altering ,the balance : of . . power between the two .Legislative' Chambers by increasing'' the number;' of representatives in1'- the Assembly.' And ''even had the measure be'enrplaced on the, statute book it would have required a' validating' act to make it legal/ for there, can be no denying1' that ? .imposing as it ; did ' ' a tax upon the people1', in- the shape of the £3000 per annum! required : to .pay' the salaries : of ' ten additional .members, the bill . should have been ^initiated/ by a message from; the Governor,;, ami; as! this indisp itisable. for mality, owing doubtless tosomeollijiialblun deririg, was omitted, the measure .was never legally before Parliament. JCTo one, perhaps,, excepting the few aspiring candidates who announced their intention (of ..offering their services to the electors, ; will5 much regret the loss of a measure which, while doing justice to :two or three electorates, wronged the rest of the colony. The Upper House has assuredlv afforded the thoubIv inclined an ; opportunity to repeat their thanks to Providence that we possess a second legislative, chamber.! : ? ' The .recent ,crusade. undertaken by the police in the ostensible interests! of virtue and morality may well cause Victorians to 'ask themselves whether the ; vaunted liberty of the subject of which Britons are. so justly proud 'is- hot a fiction in the colony, and whether the time-honoured adage that 'An Englishman's house is his castle' is not in this colony at1 least a mereempty boast. . ; ' ; . . ; Assuredly must we be a inost law-abiding people, for in 'no other community under the sun. would such vagaries as our police officers at times indulge in -be permitted. A 'day or- two since, at half:past eleven at,night, a respectable ? ?. hotel in1 the metropolis was visited by ah inspector and a posse of constables, and' the . various couples occupying the sleeping apartments compelled to 'produce ? their marriage certificates !

The attempt.toput do^yn Mr. S.yi'no arid his. freothoiight Sunday lectureii: has ended in failure, after costing the couutry J385 15s. Tho attempt in the case of Mrs. Ehoda; Newton to 'put down' baby-farming has - likewise turned out abortive. The bill introduced into the Assembly, for the protection of females figures among ?' the slaughtered innocents' of the session. The ; efforts of the police to ;deal with ?'.' the! curse of great cities' have proved resultless, and the difference of opinion in regard, to, what kind of ro ligipus instruction should be imparted to the, State school children of Victoria has resulted in causing none at all being tole rated.
