DRIFTING AWAY. They drift away. Ah, God ! they drift for ever. I watch the stream sweep onward to the sea, Like some old battered buoy upon a roaring river, Round whom the tide-waifs hang-then drift to sea. I watch them drift- the old familiar faces Who fished and rode with me, by stream and wold, Till ghosts, ioet men, fill old beloved places, And, ah ! the land is rank with church yard mould. I watch tlhem drift-thed youthful aspira tions Shores, landmarks, beacons, drift alike. I watch them drift-the poets and the states. men. The very streams run upward from the sea. Yet overched the boundless arch of heaven Still fades to-night, still blazes into day. Ah, God ! my God ! Thou wilt not! drift away.
