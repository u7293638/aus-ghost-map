WHITE'S ROOMS. D'Arcy Reid's spectral illusions were repeated on Monday night in White's Kooms to a rather limited attendance of ghost seers. The enter tainment, clever in parts, is not of a nature cal cciaiea co create a sensation oi awe, as we spec tral visitations partake more of the ridiculous than the sublime, somewhat after the fashion «f so-called spiritual manifestations. As many of tbe jokes are entitled to the toleration and re spect usually accorded to extreme and helpless, old age, it would be as well to inU°duft» ? *ew with more spirit and 'sxa-ing' in them, and then the intervals between the visions would perhaps prove les« irksome. The scece of 'The Knight 'Watching his Armour' has the elements of romance about it and might be made very effective, as the scenery is credit able and the general idea good ; but the gallant knight himself, who by-the-way sits on a plain fcoctst modern kitchen chair, is not eooaj $q dumb-thow acting, and thereby rather' spoils wlftt XBtcht be made a really neat little scene. In th6 plate of the Phantom Christys ghastly Chinese dancing fignrts were introduced, and went: through a serif* of clever transforma tions, which took the spectators by sur piise: and elicited applause. The whole closed with a very amuiing spectral mono logue entitled ' The Haunted House,' in which some engenions optical illusions were carried out with a great degree of success, the final scene being especially laughable and having the effect of sending the people sway in a merry humour. The main fault about the whole per formance ig the t&mowa; of the moaologue, the mechanical contrivances being far from bid. The performance will be repeated to-night.
