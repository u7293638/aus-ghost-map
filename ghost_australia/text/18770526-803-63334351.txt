A FASHIONABLE WOMAN'S PRAYER. Si'RE Â¡sro tn UN my husband and may his faith and his money hold out to the last. Draw the lamb's wool of unsuspicious twilight over his eyes, that my flirtations may look to him like victories, and that my bilis may strengthen his pride in me. Bless, O Fortune, my crimps, rats, and frizzles, and let thy glory shine on my paint and powder. Enable the poor to shift for themselves, and save me from missonary letters. Shed the light of thy countenance on my camel's hair shawl, and my lavender silk, my point lace, and my neck-lace of diamonds, and keep the moth out of my sable, I beseech the, O Fortune ! When I walk out before the gaze of vulgar men, regulate my wriggle and give me new grace to my gait. Wheu I. bow myself to worship, grant that I may do it with ravishing elegance, and preserve unto the last the lily white of my flesh and the taper of my fingers. Destroy mine enemies with the gall of jealousy, and eat up with the teeth of envy all those who gaze upon my style. Save me from wrinkles and foster my plumpness. Fill both mine eyes, O Fortuue, with the plaintive poison of infatuation, that I may lay out my victims-the men-as numb as images graven. Let the lily and the rose strive together in my cheek, and maj'' my neck swim like a goose on the bo3om of crystal water. Enable me, O Fortune, to wear shoes a little smaller, and save me from all corns and bunions. Bless Fanny, my lapdog, and rain hailstones of destruction upon those whe shall hurt a hair of Hector, my kitten... Smile, 0 Fortune, most upon Dick, my canary, and watch over with the fondness of a ghost my two lily-white mice with red eyes.
