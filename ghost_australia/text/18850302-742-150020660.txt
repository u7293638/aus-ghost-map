SPORTING. THE V.R.C. AUTUMN MEETING. [By Submarine Cable.] (from our own correspondent.) Melbourne, February 28. The Autumn Meeting of the Victoria I Racing Club began to-day at Flemington. The attendance was small, considering the fine weather which prevailed, and the fact of three such races as the St. Leger, Ascot Vale Stakes, and Newmarket Han- . dicap being on the programme. The Essendon Stakes as usual brought out the great cracks of the season, Commotion and Malua, but on this occasion the Melbourne Cup winner had to play second fiddle to that grand old son of Panic and Evening Star, who added one more great victory to the credit of his owner, and the cheers which greeted the old horse when he returned to scale might have been heard in Melbourne. The Hopeful Stakes were appropriated by a daughter of Gang Forward. The Ascot Vale Stakes went to the Hon. James White by the aid of Uralla, the 71b penalty which Monte Christo had to carry having the effect of keeping him back, albeit he ran a great horse, and the filly only beat him by a head. It would also appear that the riding of Hales on Monte Christo did not give satisfaction, as our telegrams state that he was mobbed when he returned to scale. Four horses came to the post for the St. Leger, and of these Silver King j proved the winner, with David second. and Mozart third. The Newmarket Handicap saw all the acceptors face the starter, and the St. Albans horse Coronet got away from the field at the distance post and won easily, the other Tasmanian bred horse, Sheet Anchor, being third. The victory for the Kingston stable was a good one from a monetary point of view, as it is stated that the Messrs. Robertson, who own the horse, have netted a large sum of money by it, set down as between £20,000 and £40,000. The concluding event on the programme was The Bruns wick Stakes, won by Grace Darling. The following is a short account of the racing : — Essendon Stakes — A sweepstakes of 5 sovb each, h ft, with 250 added. 200 sovs and all the sweepstakes for tbe first horse, 30 for tbe second, and 20 for tbe third.

At the carriage paddock Robertson brought Malua with a great rush, but he had waited a little too long, and could not get any nearer than half a length off Commotion at the winning post, Reginald a good third.
