PRISON ESCAPES. I WITH A FEW REMARKABLE EXAMPLES. There is no department of literature man.

He had made a ladder of ropes, too, out of small bits of nuts ml used in the manufacture of bags and mats, which be carried off to his cell as a bird builds her nest His cell had been duly examined at ory day, but the hole which he had contrived to make was not discovered until he had flown, for he had papered it over, w hitening the pages with lime, using, it is presumed, skilly for paste How much ingenuity is w pasted upon these schemes, which generally prove so short a ' What tenacity ' What courage, moral and physical ' Take the case of Almond, who escaped from Carlisle Gaol only a few days ago with a 2in silo ho cut through a thick bar of iron in two places, and dropped from his cell window to the ground By a marvellous arrangement of ladders which he found in an outhouse he o\ eventually succeeded in getting clear at the risk of his life. He robbed a scarecrow of its clothes, baffled the police, jumped on to a moving train, and was eventually, after counties and endures and sufferings, run down at his sweetheart's At Nottingham it is recorded that a man squeezed himself through his cell window on the fourth floor and climbed by the lightning conductor to the roof The police station stood adjoining the prison, but at a distance of 11ft, and the prisoner boldly leapt across this gulf, beneath iT which the ground yawned 60ft below Not many, like Jackson, the Strangeways convict, commit murder first though, but society was too strong for him also, and he was hanged Dr Campbell, in his book on Dartmoor, records an escape with peculiar features He was a noted burglar who cut a hole through the roof of his prison, and lowered himself thence to the boundary wall From the wall he dropped to the far side then broke into one of the quarters, that of a superior officer, where he stole a good suit of clothes and a saddle and bridle After eating an ample supper he made for the stables, but could not effect an entrance, however, he found a horse grazing near To o Bridges, which he caught saddled, mounted, and rode for Exeter Unfortunately, he met the owner of the horse face to face just as he was driving home from a fan He was at once challenged as to the stolen horse, but only turned tail and galloped away the farmer in hot pursuit, and was presently overtaken and secured His first act was to offer a handful of silver spoons as a bribe for release, which was not accepted But his coolness did not desert him he told the officer whose coat he had " borrowed " that he had found it an excellent " fit " But if any one wants a thrilling hour, let him turn to the chapter on " Escapes " in another of Major Gnllithss prison booKs the well-known history of millbank The most marvellous of many escapes from that famous prison was Punch Howard's, who had also broken out of Newgate and Horsemonger-lane gaol In those days the prisoners used regular steel knives, which were given in for meal times, and then immediately removed Howard, at dinner time, converted his knife into a rough saw by hammering the edge of the blade on the corner of his iron bedstead, and with this sawed through one river, leaving the window " in state quo " The whole thing was effected within the dinner hour saw made, bat out, and knife returned Then Howard set to work His cell was situated at the top of the infirmary, being lighted by a window whose extreme length was about 15ft and its width (rain The window itself revoked in a central bar, which was riveted into the stone at each end Hoisting himself again to the window, by hanging his blanket in a hammock hook in the wall just beneath, be removed the window bodily one met having been sawn through, the other soon gave way The way of egress such as it was was now open-a narrow slit, 3ft by Can. Howard was a stoutly built man, with a by no means small head, yet he managed to get his head through the opening Having accomplished this no doubt if her tremendous pressure and his h paid to him self, he hunted so as to be on his back and worked his shoulders and arms out. He had previously put the window with its central iron bar halt in and half out of the orifice, meaning to use it as a platform to stand on, the weight of his body pressing down one end, whilst the other night against the roof of the opening, and so gin of him his foothold He had also torn up his blankets and sheets in strips, and tied them together so as to form a long rope, one end of which was fastened to his legs He was now half way out of the window, I lying in a horizontal position, with his arms i free, his body nipped about the centre by the narrow opening, his legs still inside his cell. It was not difficult for him now to draw out the rest of his body, and as soon as he had length enough he throw himself up and caught the coping stone of the roof above. All this took place on the top story, at a height of some 36ft. from the ground. He was now outside the wall, and standing on the outer end of the window bar. To draw out the whole lengths of blanket and sheeting rope, throw them on to the roof, and clamber after, were his next exploits. His next job was to descend into the garden below, which encircles the whole of the buildings, and is itself surrounded by a low boundary wall. This garden was patrolled by six sentries. He could see them. He took the descent by degrees, lowering himself from the roof to the third-floor window, and from third floor to second, from second to first, and from first to the ground itself. The back of the nearest patrol just there was turned, and Howard was unobserved. Next moment he was seen standing in his white shirt, but otherwise naked, in among the tombstones of the penitentiary graveyard. Concluding that he was a ghost, the sentry, as he afterwards admitted, turned tail and ran, and Howard was soon over the wall. Within a minute he was in his mother's house in Pye street, close by, got food and clothing, and was off to the country. And the story of his capture reads like a romance. But he was captured within 48 hours. The safe custody of prisoners is now reduced to a science, though they seem held but by a thread. They work " on plein air " in the open, miles beyond the prison gates or boundary walls. The staff of officers in charge is less than 10 per cent. ; no ostensible means of coercion are used ; the prisoners, except in the case of half a dozen of the most turbulent, wear no chains. The whole system depends on the 060 observance of certain principles which have come to be regarded as axioms almost by the officials. No prisoner is allowed to be for one moment out of the officer's sight that officer starts in the morning with a ' certain number of convicts in charge ; he must bring in the same number on his return to the prison. Beyond the vigilant eye of these officers in charge of small parties ranges a wide cordon of warder sentries, who are raised on high platforms and have an uninterrupted view around. A carefully prepared code of signals serves to give immediate notice of escape. " A shrill note on the whistle, a single shot from a sentry's breechloader sound; the alarm A man gone " Next second, the whistles re-echo, shot answers shot ; the parties are assembled in the twinkling of an eye, and a force of spare officers hasten at once to the point from whence comes the first note of distress. It is next to impossible- fora fugitive to got away ; if he runs for it, he is chased ; if he goes to ground, they dig him out ; if he takes to the water, he is soon over used. Such is the graphic picture of convict life drawn for us by the only literary Governor of Prisons (Major Griffiths) we have ever had. These prisons keep their secrets only too well.
