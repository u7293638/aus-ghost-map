THE RATHSCAE EQAD, To the Editor of the Avoca Mail. Sir — I am a very old ratepayer auj natqrally interested in the welfare of Avoca, and having read your report of the Homebush meeting in your paper of Tnes, day, cannot but feel amnsed at the theatri. calyiose of Cr Stockman. He would get this load of gravel spread or die in the atlemnt t Such extreme langqage as this deprives a speech or assertion of all gravity, or belief. As to Cr Stockman craze of giory — boast ing of having reduced the Engineer and Secretary's salary from £350 to £250— and thereby saving £100! that statement as regards saving, is in my opinion as much, to be relied on as Cr Stockman's real in. tention of giving up the ghost, if he is in. terested in the matter of the Rathscar road. An old Councillor, such as he is, ouht to know, when servauts or officers feel themselves badly treated, they do not feel it a matter of honor to be over-zealous, and in the case of a " Shire Secretary and Engineer," a very small share of careless- ness — or waut of zeal, costs the Shire £100 —even in the case of a single large contract. This might occur, and the councillors be perfectly helpless to prevent. Certainly the fiuaucial position of the shire must be considered, but while it is a shire a good officer is of more financial value than a good councillor, bqt a good officer must be enabled to live decently, and have fair means or salary to enable him to do his duty tolly, and £250 does not admit of these two very important conditions! I venture to say that Cr. Stockman does, not save for the shire the £ LOO. he boasts of economising. Yoar's very truly, A VERY OLD, RATEPAYER.
