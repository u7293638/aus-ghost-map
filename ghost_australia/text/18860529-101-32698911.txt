Odds and Ends. The use of Opium in San Francisco. The police estimate that in San Francisco, with its population of about 300,0000, there are not less than 3,000 habitual opium smok- ers. From a rather extended study of the class, in and out of Chinatown, I should say that this estimate is not exaggerated. There are certain corners in the city which are the favorite haunts of the opium smokers. Here on any pleasant afternoon one may see the victims of the vice in all its stages. Most of them are young men, decently dressed, but giving unmistakable signs of their vicious life by their pallid faces, ghastly look and emaci- ated forms. Their skin is like that of con- victs long shut out from sun and air ; their cheek-bones protrude above deep hollows, while the skin is drawn about the mouth in a way which is disagreeably suggestive of a grinning skeleton. All smoke cigarettes and all drink, for that the big vice crushes out the little one is a paradox which cannot be proved by experience. Most of these young men have been brought to this condition in- side of three years. The living skeletons among them, who who are so weak and nerve- less that they brace themselves for support against a cellar railing or the side of a house, have been smoking for years. In eight or ten years at the outside, they will give up the ghost, dying a death by inches, like the con- sumptive, ever deluded by false hopes, of re- covery, and suffering the torments of the damned for the violation of nature's laws.
