jTew Tear's Day Services in Camden. ST. JOHN'S CAMDEN. A Watchnight service was beld m St. John's Camden on New Year's Eve and was very well attended. ^ Jackson s To Doutn was sung just as the hour of 12 was struck. On Sunday, large congregations were present at all the services in the various churches of England. Special mention might be made of the singing in St. John's at the 11 o'clock service. We have noticed how hearty and congregational the singing bas been on many occasions lately. The choir evidently take an interest in their work and their efforts are certainly appreciated by the public. ST. PAUL'S, COBBITTY.
