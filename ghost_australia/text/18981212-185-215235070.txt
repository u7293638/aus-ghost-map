AN INTERESTING CONTROVERSY. MELBOURNE, Saturday. (FROM OUR CORRESPONDENT) A controversy has Arisen with respect to the alleged discovery of Australia in the year 1609 by Pedro Fernando de Que[?]ros, more generally known as Quiros, a Portuguese navigator, in the service of Spain, who rose from the position ot a seaman before the meet to that of commander of a fl Uillu fitted out by the Spanish Government for the purposes of geo graphical dlßCorery and oolonisatlon. Th - claim was reoently advanced by Cardinal Moran, of Sydney, and it is somewhat surprising to find an eduoated dignitary of the oburcb, so Jmperfeolly acquainted with tbs life voyages of a zealous Oathollo like Queiroa, as to put forth any Buoh pretension on his parr. In the 0l)th chapter ot the Viajss of that adventurous voyager Quelros describes his discovery ot wbat- ho supposed to be a great Southern Continent, and of whiob he took possession In the name of his church, of the Trinity, of dt. Francis, and tit. John, 'of the Order of the Holy Ghost, and of tbs King of 3paln: and he oalled the country not Australia, but AustrUlii del itßperitu Saoto, in honor of the Royal house of Aus tria to whioh he dedicated his discoveries. He further tel a ub that he marked out the Bite ot a oby which was to be named the New Jerusalem; and that he organised an administration consisting of twenty-three ptrsonß, who were duly sworn in, aa it was his purpose to return to Spain and induce the Government to oolonlse Australia. Unfortunately for his visions of a great dominion In the Paolflo, and fortunately for mankind, it turned out that his imaginary continent was outy an island, and not a very large large one cither, ft atilt beam the name he gave it of EBpiritu Santo, and it Is the most westerly of the New Hebrides group, so Queros was never within 18 or 20 degrees oi the lßland continent oi Australia, the aboriginal inhabitants ol whioh thus essaped slavery or extermination, the usual Spanish methode of •' civilising native raoes in those days.
