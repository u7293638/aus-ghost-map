A tender from Mr. Matthews.- for ' painting one of the wards in the l^spital was accepted; On the motion, pf Mr. Small it was resolved to, obtain a fender for. each of the Hospital Wards.

The meeting then adjourned.. , .pBOFBSSOB PePJPBb's EOTBaTAJO?MErNT.— Professor Pepperrhad axrowdc^l bonsc^st his opening entertai nment on Wednesday evening.

BQ mucli admired would naturally, l^ad;to,-4;lu?, as; th?y- a|B-prde4: 'a suffipient gpa^ant^B tTiat whatever the Professor undertook ;would be well- done^ ,-even .thopgh, as on;thi8 occasion, the entertaiment was of a different^character, it.ljeing jnuunly.directed to the exhibitioo^in different modes of Professor jPepper'a ghost. The Professor eays. Jhis.cam was different from thatjof the. dog^hidi grasped at the shadow and^lost the substance, for when he first dis covered this way of raising the ghost, which was .ebme 'seventeen years ago, he cleared ibo less than £12,000 in a short time in little Tillage of London with its four millions of^inhabitants, besides what jbe made by its §xhibiiioijL.i6n ,ihe. Continent.., He showed it not^as. preternatural or as supernatural, but ficmesliy as an illusion. The Professor showed,^ eoene .entiaed ^' Cupid and the. loYe letter," in which a lady with more on her mind than on. he.rrsho^ld^rs was. Been L reading the love-letter when to her arose Cupid, whom she tried to grasp, butrhe proved ja-yeritable shadow without substance, although he man aged to do much mischief. The -next service into ,-wtdch the ghpst was .pressed -was to represent the white lady so familiar to the readers of Jjie " Mysteries of Udolpho/'/ Jfext we had the cruel J^rcle of..the,bei»eS;injie wood doing his amjnal penance of; standing up in-Jus bones in his coffin; and-a.comic scene ..'' llmbrelto, oo\p1»hip/' in whi^.

As the Professor put it, whenever you greatly magnified man's work; it lost by the test, but tbe-more highly the &reat; Creator's works.were, magtiified the .more- beautifuldid they appear,' as was evidenced by those views wliioh showed a sefetao'tf/of ivy, butterflies' wings, &c.; Some of ;the <jbjects wersjehown under a magnifying power ©f -.^QOO times, and their magnitude Was -: astonishing; A fine needle took some seconds -traverse the screen, ' and whilst it; looked anything but fine its eye alone was some feet in extent. Then the Professor showed the ancient classical incident of Pyg malion and Galatea, in which at the prayer of the former the statue of the latter was endowed with vitality, and gave the audience a surprising illustration -of the faet. that there's nothing newunder the fcun—inasmuch as she sang in tolerable English two operatic songs, | the authorship of jrhicli has erroneously ,been. ■ ascribed to 'a much "niore tnodfern period— "When other lips," and "Scenes that are brightest." The composer of Maritana must have discovered an original copy of this opera in some classical view, and so .correctly tran-„ scribed And translated it as to retain a per ceptible resemblance between some of the < principal airs as rendered in the time of Gala- _ tpa andnow-fl.-day&. .
