A Night Thought Planets perpetuate tho gods of Grooco, And iu tho dark sorono of midnight glide, Liko ghosts of the dead puwora, o'er path* ways wido ; Such sx'oll is thcro in names ! whioh shall not cease, But rathor, as thn ngos roll, morenso. What mysteries to x'osies allied Still in the old mythology abide — And stars scouro their momory's lusting leaso ! Whilo that each plnuot boars its pagnn namo Tho gods are uuforgot. And glowing bright Tho constellations' clust'ring jewels claim To write, in lottors of unchanging light, Tho history of horoes, Other famo Is dulled beside tho blazonry ot night ! — The Cornhill Mayazine.
