QUEEN VIOTORIA PERSONATED It.- is indiscreet to relate that Miss Ellis Jeffreys— in private life the Hon. Mrs. Curzon-— once for half a minute impersonated the Queen. It was at the famous bazaar at the Albert-hall, for the benefit of the Charing Cross Hos pital, where most of the Duchesses and th,e .prettiest of the actresses of England acted as saleswomen. Mis3 Jeffreys, who is a most accomplished beggar, worked like a. Trojan for two days, and 'peddled' a lot of trifling fancy articles for a goodly sum. On the second day people grew bold, and as Miss- Jeffreys is distinguee and always beautifully gowned,., they kept asking her who she was, in the hope that it v ght turn out that .they had bought something of a Duchess, or perhaps even one of the Princesses. When she said 'Miss Jef freys' the women would sniff, and move away disappointed. 'Do they do that to you?' she asked Miss Hanbury. 'Yes,' replied Miss Hanbury, 'and I've had so much of it that it's beginning to get qn my nerves.' 'I'll telf you what we should do,' exclaimed Miss Jeffreys j 'let us give them what they want ! Tell the next ope that asks you that you're the Duchess of Sutherland, and I'll say I'm the Princess Heniyof Pless !' 'Oh ! I would not dream of doing such a thing, and heitW would you!' returned Miss Hnnbury. 'Watch me !' war the reply. Just then a most vulgar and impertin ent woman, the worst type of nouvelle riche, came up and bought something of Miss Jeffreys, eyeing her ail over, and finished with: 'Tell me which one you are!' Drawing herself to her full height, and, putting on' her most im perious expression, Miss Jeffreys said, in a particularly firm voice. 'Madame, I am the Queen!' The woman made off is if she had seen a ghost, evidently thinking she had to do with a lunatic, ?and Miss Jeffreys, who considered that anything more would be anti-climax, promptly went home.
