CORNISH CAROLS. The Cornish Association Musical Society repeated the collection of Cornish carols, sung in Adelaide at Christmas time, at the Port Town Hall on Mondav evening. Mr. J. Cleave presided over a good attendance. The carols were sung with very great taste, and evinced careful training on the part of the members of the Society. The time was very good, and the various parts blended excel- lently. During the evening Mr. Harvey sang 'True to the Last' and 'Simon, the Cel- larer,' and Mr. Thomas contributed two recita- tions. Miss Matthews was encored for her rendition of the song 'It reached my Heart,' and the Rev. G. E. Rowe entertained the audience with a reading entitled 'A Cornish Ghost Story.' Applause was frequent, and the concert passed off very successfully. Mr. Poulton conducted, and the singers were as- sisted by an orchestra.
