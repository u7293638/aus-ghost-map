TOElOiS. C haubeb of OosntBBCB —H aving had enquiries bb to the labor m arket in Japan the Secretary wrote to th e Japanese Consul in Melbonrne, and received th e following reply “ 98 Queen street, M elbourne, May 22, 1897. E . Hawson, H obart, T asm ania. Doar Sir,—In reply to yout le tte r in connection w ith tb e labor m arket in Japan, I beg to say there would be no possible chance w hatever ef European artisans obtaining employment in tb a t country. The m arket is fully supplied w ith Japanese artisans, who are experts in all branches of tbeir various trades. The w ages average 2s per day for first- class Japanese artisans, who work nine hours per day. So, therefore, I would not advise any European going to Japan in search of employm ent.—Youre, e tc , A. M ir e s , H .I.J.M .'s Consul.” T ub L a bbiein P zst.—Thia nuisance, alw ays existent in N orth H obart, has lately assumed much increased proportions, and residents of Lower Warwick street, and those whose business takes them into its vicinity a fte r nightfall, have anything b u t a good tim e. Such jocular practices as stretching string across the footpaths to trip unw ary pedestrians are quite common, whilst th e language of the hoodlums who compose the gangs is horrible to hear. So bad is tb e ir conduct th a t worshippers a t Holy T rinity Church evening services have to go o u t of their way to avoid thorn, and many persons, ladies and children especially, are afraid to venture o u t a t night. Surely it is tim e th a t tbo police took some proceedings to p u t a stop to this by punishing a few of th e worst, who coaid be easily secured by tw o or three plaln-olotbes constables any evening in th e week, Sunday not excepted. *'W in d so r Maqazike. ” — T be April num ber of this welcome m onthly, ju st to band through the local agents (Messrs J.

A woman named Lydia KiJdea was once again before th e Bench th is rnori ing charged with disturbing th e peace, and her wretched debauched appearance * as truly pitiful to see. About 14 weeks back she reoeirod a sentence of three m onths for being idle and disorderly in th e hopes th a t th a t period in gaol wotild eerve to%ive her tim e to pull herself together.

This m orning, a t 2 o'clock, she was c re atin g a row in H arrington street, and although I he constable on duty gave her a chance to get away she refused to avail herself of it, and tb e policeman had no option b u t to a rrest her. A t tbe Police Court, tbe Poliro M agistrate said he hardly knew w hat to do w ith th e woman as she seemed incorrigible.

A H ypnotic D anger —T he fears which have been expressed th a t hypnotic suggestion m ight be used for crim inal ends, have generally boen treated as unfounded, or, a t least, greatly exaggerated. A Berlin correspondent of the British Medical Journal, however, relates an incident which gives th e color of actuality to w hat were regarded as merely nervous apprehensions, o r inventions of the sensational novelist. A H am burg practitioner was consulted by a y o ung m arried lady, who complained of te rrib le hallucinations, driving h e r to suicide. Beyond the haUucinaliose complained of, there seemed nothing to indic ate m ental disease; but a sudden light daw ned on Dr. D., when, in the courfe of further conversation, his patient to ld h im two facte—one th a t h er husband h a d lately insured her life for a large 6um, an d th e second tb a t be was fond of making hypnotic experiments. Dr. D. found it easy to hypnotise bis patient, bu t m et witb obstinate resistance when he commanded b e t to divulge w hat hsd been euggested to h e r to do. He a t last overcame the resistance of his patient, who acknowledged th a t her husband had commanded her to com m it suicide a fte r two months, and to keep his command secret from everyone. T h e insurance company is one tb a t pays even in cases of suioide if th e 6uicide bo com m itted more than two months a fte r in- BDfance.

B ut will they be able to Anglify th e ir stom achs ae easily as their institutions ? C ertain G erm an professors have been cogitating on th e reason why Borne races seem to th riv e to woll on a vegetable, w hile others seem to require a certain am ount of anim al diet. Suspecting some difference of inte rn a l anatomy, they examined tbe bodies of a number of deceased Jape, and are reported to hare found th a t th e intestinal organ of these vegetarians was actually half as long again as th a t of flesh-eating Europeans, and much more suitable fo rth e digestion ef vegetables, which is mainly intestinal, W ill the animal diet shorten th e intestine, or will th e long intestine render the new diet harm ful instead of helpful ? This is a problem with which tbe paternal Japanese G overnment will, perhaps, he obliged to grapple. L et us draw your attention to our Macintoshes a t One Guinea—a marvel of cheapness.
