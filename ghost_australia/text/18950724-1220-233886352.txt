He Wanted Wariqth. / 3 The colonial youth may be trusted to take care of himself. He is made that .way, self- helping, though not perhaps invulnerable — as Emerson pic tures young America after being dipped in the Styx of human experience. The latest illustration of young Australia's calmness comes from Braid- wood, in New South Wales. It is perfectly delightful. The Braid wood " Despatch " says that a gentleman was driving at night to the town along one of the main roads, when he saw approaching a tremendous fire fly—or was it a ghost? At any rate some illumination seemed to be travelling along the centre of the road, and on coming nearer it suddenly burst into "a large sheet of. revolving flame." For a mo ment the marvel made him giddy, and then , the solemn truth" was revealed . Read, on . The ' Despatch ' says : — " Judge of his astonishment when he saw a lad driving a cart and lying full length in front of a blazing fire, which he had built upon stones in the- middle of his dray. Long pieces of wood were laid on the stones,, and as these burnt down the coals fell through the holes in the bottom of the: cart on to the road. The sheets of revolving flame he had seen Mr. Allen discovered was caused by a ; newspaper which had caught ' round the wheel of the cart. Ths lad was con tentedly smoking his pipe as though he were, ;Comfortably ensconced in an armchair in front of a fire in his home. When, asked if he was not afraid of the cart catching fire he replied with the utmost com posure that he ' didn't Care if both the cart and horses caught fire so long as he could keep himself warm.' And lie really looked as if such a contingency didn't trouble him in the slightest." .
