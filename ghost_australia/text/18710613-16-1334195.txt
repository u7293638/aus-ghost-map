Turf Gossip?. By Yakb/ahan. Tile racing season of this colony may now be considered to be at its full height, for notwithstanding the fact that the two principal programmes have been discussed, there are a number of country fixtures, oil following be closely upon one another as to give horses plenty to do for the next three months Last week was a busy one at Ipswich, the programme was in all respects a liberal one but the sport would have been far better had the handicap races been more judiciously arranged I think the result of the principal handicap has pretty fully borne out my remarks respecting it and that my friend ' Nimrod ' must confess that I was right, when I said that Mr Tait was not too well in at Brisbane, while he was quite out of it at Athens I have been informed that Mr. Tait himself ad mitted that he did not consider he was unfairly treated by the handicappers So he might, but what of that? Good general as he undoubtedly is in fact, far and away, the best in the colonies- he sometimes makes mistakes and he undoubtedly did so on the present occasion, or he would have come a little earlier than he did. It was Mr Tait him self and not his horses that was generally be moved m, for the public here could know very little about the latter except b" report That florence is a grand filly no one in his senses will deny, but where she can have a distance and carry weight has yet to be ascertained Somehow these Victorian bred ones as a general rule, never tram on no matter how superior they show themselves to be as youngsters, and I take it Miss Florence will not prove an exception to the rule The trip to Queensland may possible, improve the mare considerably, as far as health is concerned, and I hope it may, for it will be a sad pity if she leaves the turf before her real goodness has been ascertained The Count is as handsome and well bred a little gentleman as one would wish to see, whilst he was likewise travel a docker, and no mistake, for a short distance, but a mile is about all he can got, if asked to gallop all the way The stable depended upon his being able to pull off the list cod Handicap in Ipswich, and many now believe that he would have done so had he not bolted I don't however, but think, on the contrary that the pace would have been too hot all the way to enable him to finish in front I hardly think Mr Tait is at all likely to pay Queensland a visit are in a hurry , but, should he do 60, depend upon it he will take away a little more money than he has done on the present occasion there was not a genuine sportsman at Ipswich, but was glad to see him pull off the two handicaps on the third day, in aid of the black horse Cassilis, and wondered how his late owner liked it, and whether he did not feel pretty full about having parted with his guest so soon If over there was a in was out of the fire, it was the Ipswich Handicap, for when the weights came out it was "a guinea to a gooseberry" upon the grey mare which would assuredly have proved correct had the latter not gone up a tree at the last moment from a failing common to her sex I don't think there were many present as much eurpnseduttho result as Mr Tait himself, more especially after the run G rcj claim made at the back of the course A very great deal of dissatisfaction was expressed at the adjustment of these weights, and With good reason too us there were but a couple left in Grojskim and Cassilis, whilst on paper it looked a certainty for the mare But ' you never can tell the pot boiled over, and with a vengeance too, the odds being 2 to 1 on the mare before starting With reference to this handicap, I should like to ask how it came about that the weights were so well known in some quarters a good hour and a half before the declaration was made? this certainly was most irregular, to use the mildest term, and there were several present who did not hesitate to speak their sandspits freely on the subject Dub week the Toowoomba races (take place, and promise to be well attended not only by residents of the district, but like so by many visitors from other parts, amongst whom the metropolis will be well represented The Han shops have already been made, but the weights for the Cup have only reached here as yet Grejskim, who was adjudged to carry 9 st 7 lbs , declared non acceptance at once, and quite right too 09 She is certainly going on, and it was a thousand to one that she could not be brought round again in time She arrived in town yesterday afternoon, by the road, and may be considered to have completed her lucnij,season, and well indeed hnsBbo stuck to her owners winning three handicaps out of four straight offers per form once not to be met with every day Cnssihs, with 9st d. lbs on his back, will have to travel to win the Toowoomba Cup The horse has passed into Mr Tait's hands, who leaves far behind him to finish his season templar, 8 st 7 lbs, if as good as he has been represented to be, should find no child colt in winning this event, and depend upon it he will carry a good deal of Downs money for it Grafton, at 6 st 9 lbs, I can't see at any price fooling persuaded as I do that with a stone between them the black horse is his master Challenger, 8 st, will, I fear, prove a dour purchase for Huddle and I am sorry for it, as his horses invariably run for the money when he thinks he possesses a ghost of a chance I am rather full about Mr Billy however, telling them in Athens that 1 abused the Ipswich programme after assisting to draw it out I did nothing of the sort, what I did abuse was the handicap, and have not my words come true ? Counterfeit 7 st 12 lbs , is not out of the Cup if as good as he is represented to be they say he is Zenobia s master, and if that is true he is a dangerous horse anywhere if not overburthened Eucalyptus, 7 st 12 lbs , is amongst a different class of company to what he is used to, and his owner will act wife by by " s nding that 'ere horse back to the stable " The Baron has not been severely dealt with when asked to carry 7 st 4lb but he is a good weight carrier when nothing like it was clearly shown in the Corinthian race in Brisbane, but what he can do in good company with a light weight to carry we have yet to learn Dundv 7st 7 lbs is reported not to be going at all, but surely His Honor could not expect to get in much lighter after the easy way in which the good Little's won the Consolation Handicap in Ipswich The two principal handicaps at Gympie have filled well, and if the weights are full adjusted some excellent sport may be looked for at the golden city Mr Tait, Jemmy Ashworth, and the two Sydney cracks Florence and the Count-left here by the Lady Bowen yesterday afternoon, on their way home, amidst- the best wishes of several sporting men who at ended to witness the last of them Should Mr Tait re visits us again be will meet with a hearty welcome from at least half a dozen of the right sort QriE'sst.A'vD Back Meetings Toowoomba (D D Jockey Club) June 15 and 16 Taroom June 15 and 16 Condamine June 20 and 21 Warwick June 22 and 23 Blackall June 28 and 29 Dalby , June 29 and 30 Gayndah (Queensland Jockey Club) July 5 and 6 Springsure July 6,7, and 8 Baveuswood July 13 and 14 Maryborough (W B Jockey Club) July 17 and 18 Gympie Gympie Turf Club) July 20 and 27 Cunnamulla (Warrego Jockey Club) July 26 and 27 Gladstone (Port Curtis Jockey Club) August 24 The Dalby Herald of Saturday last says " Upwards of 800 acres of land have been purchased during the present week, the price paid being 15s per acre This gives Â£600 to the Treasury, or should do so , but as the land was all paid for in non transferable land orders, the receipts in. cash are absolutely nil The land is situate on and near Oakey Creek, and was offered for auction on May 4, but not bid for The purchaser is understood to be Mr. Davenport Several selections by conditional purchase have also been made in the same locality during the present week."
