tmim mm. d l f Although little more than a century has elapsed since Dr Johnson" died, tliii astoundine strides made in the sciences o£ enlightening the ignorant and refining the unrefined during that period do not seem to have nullified to an appreciable degree the best part of his dictum to the effect that "All argument Is against the appearance to the living of the- spirits of the dead; all belief is for it." No duub: during these hundred and odd yaars a great many time-honored ghosts have been hunted from their haunts by tlie prosaic influences of modern life arid the unsparing broom of practical common sense; no doubt there are fewer educated people who believe in ghosts than when London crowded to. Cook Lane one hundred and thirty years ago; no doubt the village Hamp den is prompter nowadays to tackle mysterious ,nocturnal visitors than of yore. Yet he who wanders through rural England—preferably on foot, fpr he is then enabled to penetrate Ijye-^ays and sequestered nooks and corners not attainable on wheels—cannot fail to be impressed by the sturdy vitality of so many old ghosts. - : As a rule he does not rfieet men who havfe actually seen ghosts",' fpr a sneaking sort of self-respect- seems to stop Hodge's admission of the fact; but he meets iwmy men who know men who i have se*n ghosts, and multitudes who have heard that ghost is to be seen at such and such a place, and who will not commit thejftsel-yes ^ denial of ks existence.

Ghosthuating may be accounted an idle and unworthy pursuit, yet it is not altogether unprofitable, as ghost legends are not infrequently tne channels through which .historical facts have been passed, down to us which would otherwise have been lost, and, moreover; aVe integrative' of the fact that the auri sacra fames has not quite knocked all sentiment and' imagination out of the English people. Well, there is at any raie one ghost b d H s in London, for the first Lord Holiand is said to walk the Sir Joshua Room in Holland House with his head in his hand—a very "fashionable ghostly proceeding—on certain nights of the year; and it is a known fact that there are, many houses which have never been let, never are let, arid never will be let, f«r any length of time- on account k of uncanny traditions associated, jwlth them.The people who taike thess houses are ready enough "to stay, but no servants will stay, and so they are driven-, elsewhere.

"Shuck" said to mean the devil—who at Coltishall Bridge is headless, and at Salhouse has a blazing eye in the centre of his forehead, and who has a brother at Peel Castle in the Isle of Mkn, the spirit of ia murdered prisoner, kiiown as the Mauthe Dog. But the historical ghosts are more interesting objects of study. -anSthe same county of Norfolk, says Mr Rye, young Lord Dacre, who gvas murdered in 1565 by his guardian. Sir Richard Fulmerston, who arranged that a rocking-horse on which the (boy sat should fall, still prances about on a <headless, of course) rocking-horse. Anne Boleyn still rides down the avenue of Blickling Park, once a year, in a hearse-like coach, drawn by four headless horses, and driven by -a 'head* less driver, with her head in her lap and her father, . Sir Thomas, does the same -thing-. . At Caistor Castle there fs another coach and headless, team, and yet another; near Great Melton. This last rises from a pool every mid-day" and midnight, and with' its load of four headless, dripping-;" •whitlfr-robed ladies, passes slowly round the field and sinks again; and tradition says that at this spot, long ago, a bridal party were upset into this pool, and never seen again. Then there 'is the Gray Lady of Rainham—not to b.e confounded with the Brown Ladyipf Rainham in Durham— who represents Lady Dorothy Walpole, forced, if fe said, to marry Lord Towns end. ip 1713; and the ghost *>f one Lush, who committed suicide ana was juried near Redenhall; • and many others. A firmly believed in coach-ghost is that of Lady Howard, daughter and heiress of Sir John Fitz of Fitzford, in Devonshire, about 1600, who, Mr Baring- <*ou!d says, travels nightly from Okehampton Castle to Fitzford Gate.

The Devonshire "folk baiieve this to be the subject of the quaint, - weird ballad of "My Ladye's Cnacli."' which opens : My Ladye hath a sable coach, • And horses two and four; , My Ladye-hath a gaunt bloodhound, That runneth on before. My Ladye's coach hath nodding plumes, The driver hath no head; Mv Lady is as ashen white- As one; that long: is . dead.. But, as Mr Baring-Gould says in his Introduction to the "Songs of the West," the Lady of the ballad, no doubt, personifies Death. Gabriel Craddock is a well known Essex ghost. He was famous in the middle of the last century as Jerry Lynch, the highwayman, who with the proceeds of ins exploits built Lapwater Hall, near Leigh, so called because, upon the application of the workmen for drink, he bid them "lap water." He was rqn to earth in his new -house, wounded, and drowned in the pond -to which he had directed the thirsty workmen's attention, and he is still believed to be seen on wild nights, bandy-legged, and mounted on an earless mare, fleeing from his pursuers as they came from Sheffield. Ingrave, Horndon, Laindon, and Pitsea. Mannington Hall, the residence of the Walpoles, Earls of Orford, has its ghostly associations. Horatio, second earl removed all the tombstones of the Scalmers, the former possessors of the Hall, from Wickmere Church and one of the buried ladies is still believed to walk round the churchyard.. To atone for the sacrilege, every Karl of Orford at his -burial was driven in his hearse three times round ruined Wickmere Church before being finally laid to rest. Very well known is the stile at Lit'lecote near Jlarlborough. on the old Bath road whoreat Wild Darrell. the principal in the terribly weird tragedy at Littlecote Hall, is still believed to followed by his howling hour a , ns on the day whf-n Vio met h: = 15 eath here—riding madly along, reckess in his conscious torture, and conronted by the apparition of a babe urning in a flame. \11 the unhappy ladies of history walk :" Ann of Cleves paces up and own the gallery bearing her name m ever Castle; Fair Rosamond walks on the river-bank at Godstow; Amy Robart on the side of Cumnor; Mary,Queen of Scots, at Fotheringhay.

' AVhat Canon Jessopp says atoout bis - own Country Of 'KoWolk ls> ti?ieuetee-' 'where: "If itife' Norfolk peasant's nund be nevr so dull, the old traditions, hand-, ed down from ages past. come in to help him. He thinks it would" be impious to doubt that disembodied spirits ' still hover about the scenes of r their earthly pilgrimage." So the Lincolnshire folk say that=not only does .Hereward tlie Wake still, on wild nights, ride furiously along- the . road, from Bourne to Peterborough, but that he haunts the site of his old home close to the Well Head in tlie town of Bourne. "Bo they believe that Thorpe Hall, near Louth., the. ghost. of, the Spanish tody who fellfii^dv^iihtSii: J<3m Bolles, .as' "commemorated m the old ballad, which, commences: . f Will you hear a Spanish lady; How shee wooed an English man?

Decked* with jewels shee had on (known from her dress as tlie Green Lady) still haunts the particular tree near the mansion. i Now and then—not often—ghostly appearances or sounds are explained to the peasant's satisfaction. Thus, in the county-of Durham, "Gabriel's Hbunds* were for long, long years believed to shriek and howl through the air on dark nights, and to forebode death to him who heard and saw them. But 1 prosaic modern research ha« proved them, to be nothing biit flocks Of wild geese migrating,southward on the approach of winter," and choosing dark'nightis for their 'journeys. Similarly, the ghost pf Irbydale, in the Lincolnshire Wolds, a goblin wi 1 0 terrified travellers at night with its heartrending cries, and who is said to be a witch who had been worried to death by dogs in a long past age, has been shown to be nothing but an^]M. On the other hand, no sirue Cornis&Ta;||i will evel* Be induced torrelinquish the belief that the spirit of King Arthur sjtill haunts the ruins of Tlntagrel in the shape of a white chough ; aJid assuredly the many English families who possess a -white bird of omen, such as that wkich Mr John Oxenham saw in Wjestward Ho*, cling firmly to the traditiou, if not to the belief in it. And so, ghosts or no ghosts, the position is just the same at the end of the nineteenth century as at the end of he eighteenth — all argument is against, them, and if all belief is not for them, a very great deal more is than people like to acknowledge. . .
