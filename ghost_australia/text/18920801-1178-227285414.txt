AT THE WATER. That Hat. That Hat Elizabeth's Gorgeous Head Cover. In response to tho sergeant's call of " Eliza beth Palmer," there stepped out of the ladies' compartment a haughty yonng person of 19 with a gorgeous hat on. At sight ot tho headpiece everybody in court laughed immensely, tor it was a most wonderful affair â€” a peacock's tail being n mere circumstance to it. It consisted chiefly of flowing pink feathers, some of which were nearly a yard long, and they Bproutcd out in all directions in wild luxu riance. Elizabeth, who was charged with having been drunk and disorderly in Barcom- Btreet, and who admitted it without tho. ghost; of a blush, seomed very proud of what she carried and held herself straight up for admiration. Mr. Beujainin Lee, S.M., who sat on tho bench, remarked, as he ordered the frail creature to pay a fine of 20s., or go to gaol for u week, that a girl with such a hat ought to have no difficulty in meeting Buch a' oomparativelysmaliamount. Tholady however had not the wherewithal, and re tired picturesquely to tho cells. Georgo Nowlan, 50, a clerk, charged with breakiug and entering into the dwcliing- bouso of James Alexander Robinson, of Netia, Waverley-street, Wavcrley, and stealing therein a lady's handbag, a towel, a silk sash, a billy-can. and a quantity of tea, was remanded till Thursday.
