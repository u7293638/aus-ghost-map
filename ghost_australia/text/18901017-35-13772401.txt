A report has been furnished to the Mines! er for Min s by Mr. Geological Surveyor David upon the Silver King and Sunny Corner mines. It states that the deposits of ore worked at both these mines belong to the main one and the name shoot or launch. This itnnien'S Ghost is the most remarkable instance hitherto discovered in New South Wales of a contact deposit , as it persistently Mullewa the Ima of contact between s ma intrusive dykes of relations and the only one, which is the dominant, tuck of the district. This ore shoot, as well as most of the others in the same district occurs at a point where one ck the felstone dykes takes a sharp turn. At the elbow so formed an irregular cavity has been produced, partly by a mechanical displacement of the clashing with regard to the underlying surface of the lentEn dyke, and partly by the local subsidence of the surface of' the upper side of the dyke from below the claymore, consequent on the schedule age of the felstone while solidifying, as already pointed out by Mr. Anderson. Metallic solutions derived front the feature dykes, which latter are highly metalliferous, five tilUiiel out of the dykes into these cavities, and have co produced the shoots of ore ; of which the one formerly worked at the Silver King, and still worked at the Sunny Corner mine, is so remarkable an example. The top of the shout out crops in the form of an immense mass of gases in the south-west corner of the Silver lung property. This, dipped in a westerly direction, pitching southerly. At about (20ft. from the surface it made into solid sulphide ores, such as arsenical and iron and copper p\ rites, June blende, and galena containing a small percentage of silver and gold. The shoot then extended horizontally in a westerly direction up to the west boundary of the Silver King, its undulations exactly conforming to those of the surface of the underlying feature. At this point team shoot passed! completely out of the area of the last mentioned same into cost of the Sunny Corner mi 2. At the mouth of the Sunny Corner No. 3 tunnel the shoot outcrops again, partly owing to its rising slightly in this direction, and partly owing to the banging way, of Gladstone having been removed by denudation. A short distance to the west of the. curve) the shoot, at her having followed a nearly horizontal course for about '200yds., rolls over and dips westerly at an angle of GO-, still in the Sunny Corner property. Mr. lliouard», the late manager of the Silver King, estimates that there are still from üuOO ta 10,000 tons of gossan ore at, the i> mine for treatment, but no sulphide ore can be found to smelt with it, all that contained in the great cry shoot in the properly having been exhausted. Cents a localities are suggested in the report as being deaf able sites to be prospected for more sulphide ore, Very little hope is entertained of any other extensive 'shoots being idle covered in this property. At the 'Sunny Corner mine lbs great ore shoot, after rolling 'Town to the west near the mouth of the Nos. 3 and a tunnel, has been followed to a further depth, of 380ft.) and at the face of the No. 1 Ithuriel is in a length of 140ft. already at this level, And for a length of stilts at the No. 2 tunnel, 100's. above No. where the shoot has a maximum width of 16ft. This shoot shows signs of being permanent As , considerable depth. Mr. Trewenack, the manager, estimates the value of the argentiferous. and auriferous, sulphide ore to average about £2 f» per ton, where the total cost of raining, colonies;, smelting, accrediting the ore amounts U a trial over £1 12s per ton. Five new wafcrJJ$ak»t furnaces, each of victory capacity, are being noted on this property, besides 32 new stalls for calcining the ore, and a new club 7ft. high and 6ft. wide, which will conduct all of man in the side of a hill a quarter of a mile distant, where they will be discharged in air from the top of a tall stack.
