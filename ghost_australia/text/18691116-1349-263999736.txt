IN TENEBRIS LUX. I/Ct there he light." 0 my brother, do you murmur nt your labour, That your burden is more than you can bear? Doth it seem as though the rest ivhicli you so 71r.1v for "Wero nua'cr tt) be obtained by prayer? Is thy Past so foully stained a idsion ? Do the ghosts of long, long departed years Wierdly haunt thee in keen mockery of derision As tuoy jest at thy procrastinated tears ? Mocking grimly as if tears could cleanse thee, — Could release thee from the bondage of thy debt ; Mocking most that ivild, \\-aiu hope of frenzy, The hope of ivinning comfort from regret. Is thy Present so o'cr-ivhchned ivitli desolation That nothingness seems lmroly so unblest? Would you seek in the grave for consolation And trust to the ivorms' charity for rest ? Is tho darkness of tho Future so Egyptian That your soul, in blind agonies oi'drend, Without clue ol the slenderest description, Would seek light from out the chambers of tho dead ? O my brother, thero is Light and there is Healing Though thy all seems made desolate by sin: Out of Life shines a living Light revealing Where is Rest, and tho Way to enter in. Lo ! a Cross ! Lo ! a crucified Redeemer ! Does the Future loo., '''oak and gloomy lion- ? And the Present, is its misery c.xtreinor Than His ivith thoso thorns about his broiv ? "But my Past?" O my brother, hear and ivonder ; Fall and worship, hero is mercy strangely vast, — As the Sun's daivn from its setting is asunder Christ has freed thee from the burden of thy Past. S.
