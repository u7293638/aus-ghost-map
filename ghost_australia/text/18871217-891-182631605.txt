Ballade of Christmas Ghosts. BETWEEN* the moonlight and the fire In -winter evening long ago, What gliosts I raised at your desiro To make your leaping blood ran slow! How old. how grave, how wise we grow! What Christian ghost can make us chill, Save these that troop in mournful row, The ghosts we all can raise at will! The boast con talk in barn and byre On Christmas Eve, old legends know, As ono by one the years retire. Wo men fall silent then, I trow. Such sights has memory to show. Such voices from the distance thrill. Ali, me' they come with Christmiis snow, The ghosts we all can raise at will. Oh! children of the village choir! Your carols on the midnight, throw! Oh. bright across tlie'mist and mire. Ye ruddy hearths of Christmas glow! Seat back the shades, beat down the woe. Renew the strength of moral will; Bs.we-lcome all to come or go, The ghosts we all can raise at will. Friend, wsum confa, soon or slow We part like guests who've 'joyed their fill. Forgot them not, nor mourn them so, The ghosts wo all can raise at will. -.4iufrvtv Lang.
