A HAUNTED HOUSE. A remarkable case was recently heard in Dublin. Mr. Waldron, a solicitor's clerk, sued his next door neigbour, who is a mats in the merchant service, named Kiernsn, to recover Â£500 damages for injuries done to his house by, as he alleged, the defendant and his family. Kiernan denied the charges, and asserted that Waldron's house was haunted, and that the acts complained of were done by spirits or some person in plaintiff's place. Evidence for the plaintiff was to the effect that every night from August, 1884, to January, 1885, his hall door was continually being knocked at and his windows broken by stones which came from the direction of the defendant's yard. Mrs. Waldron swore that one night die saw one of the panes of glass in the window cut through with a diamond ; a white hand was inserted through the hole so made in the glass. She caught up a billhook and aimed a blow at the hand, cutting one of the fingers completely oft The hand was then withdrawn ; but, on examining the place, she could find neither the finger nor any traces of blood. On another occasion the servant, hearing mysterious knock in ge, fell dovn with fnght, upsetting a pail of water oyer herself. Mr. Waldron anned himself wit" .a rifle and revolver, and brought a detective into the house, while several policemen watched outside. They, however, could find nothing. Kientan's family, on being taxed with causing the noises, denied such was the case, and suggested it was the W0I ~ of ghosts, and advised the Waldron's to send for a Roman Catholic clergyman to rid tue house of its uncanny occupants. A policeconstable swore that one evening he saw Waldron's servant kick the door with her heels about the time the rapping usually commenced. Chief Justice Morris said the affair suggested the performance of the Davenport Brothers or Maskelyne and Cook- It was quite inexplicable from the absence of motive, and remained shrouded u> mysterious uncertainty. The juiy found for the defendant.
