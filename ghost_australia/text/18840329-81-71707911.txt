? ACTING IN EARNEST. : lt. ia weil known that during those. hourB . whichjthe'lato Mr. CharleB Dickens devoted toir literary labour, so thoroughly did he 'throw: himself into the different characters jof,his, worka,' ,that for tho time being he ..thought,, plotted, spoke, and acted only in _ their respective persons, forgetting altogether ' !(.that. he waa either ? a novelist or' Charles .Diokens, or indeed any other than that par-; .ticular individual whose portrait had so long; , by mental, intercourse become indelibly; im-? planted on his mind.

Descending at once to the timo of Shak espeare, and continuing our survey through the whole history of the modern drama, we discover tho samo earnestness that charac terised tho acting of the ancients. Ot Bet terton, tho contemporary of the Immortal Bard, it has been recorded, that none was ever more qualified by nature and by geniuB to act what Shakspeare wrote ; and that he never for a single moment, while on the stage, conducted himself as an actor, but aa the character he represented. We are told also that whenever ho played Hamlet be was actually seen to turn pale as the, ghost'ap] pcared, so thoroughly did be enter into the feelings of tho title role, so deeply could ho allow his imagination to drink in the horrors of such a situation. -'.
