THE SIN OF OMISSION. It isn't the thing you do, dear, It's the tiling you leave undone Which gives you a bit of a heartache At tbe setting of the sun. The tender word forgotten, The letter you did not write, The flower you might have sent, dear, Are your haunting ghosts to-night. The stone you might have lifted Out of a brother's way, The bit of heartsome counsel You were hurried too much to say. The loving touch of the hand, dear, The gentle and winsome tone That you had uo time nor thought for, With troubles enough of your own. These lit.tle acts of kindness, So CM ily out of mind, The - uhaiict-s to be ;i • ^el- Yi iiic.i even mortal find— Tl.oy come in night a id silence, ivich chill, reproachful wraith. Whm hope is faint :n:d flagging, A; d u b>ight hat. <11 tipped un faith. For life is all too short, de ir„ And sorrow is all too great, To suffer our slow conipassiou That tarries until too late. And it's not the thing you do, dear, It's the thing you leave undone, Which gives you the bitter heartache, At the setting of the sun.
