Then, for a second time, he rebuked their wickedness in a parable, so that all men were moved to exclaim, " Behold these are the unjust stewards who have withheld from Pastora the betrothed of Presbuteros, the younglings of her flocks and herds, aud tbe fleeces which are her due." 0\. Aud the two unjust stewards were exceeding wroth with Presbuteros, and they coramuued with each other saying, " Are we poor nieu aud the despised ones of the earth, that these parables should be uttered against us 1 Did we not give many talents of silver towards tbe building of this synagogue? Are we not reckoned amoug the chief Pharisees of Sidou 1 Let us take counsel together how we may be avenged of this preacher who refused to speak pleasant thiugs to us. 10. So they gathered together many of the meaner sort of people, and secretly defamed the character of Presbuteros, saying that lie was an extortioner, aud prevailing upon " those who heard them to join in casting him out of the synagogue. 11\.
