SOLEMN VOICES. J HEARD from out the dreary realms of Sorrow The variou3 tongues of \Voe : ; One said," Is there a hope in the to-morrow t" And many answered, "No !" And they arose and mingled their loud voices, And cried in bitter bro ith " In all our joys the P.tbt alone rejoices There is no joy but Death. "Oh! dreadful Past, beyond thy midnight portal Thou hast usurped our peace, And if the augel Mjinory be immortal, When shall this anguish cease V And suddenly within the darkened distance The solemn Past replied : " In my domains your joys have no existence ; Your hopes, they have not died ! Nought com33 to me except those ghosts detested, Phantoms of Wrong and Pain ; But whatso'er Affection hatii invested, The eternal years retain. ''Then stand no more with look and souls dejected, To woo and win despair ; Tbe joy ye mourn the future hath collected, Your hopes are gathered there. '' And, as the dew which leaves the morning flowers Augments the after rain, And as the blooms which fall from summer bowers Are multiplied again " So shall the joys the Fut-ire holds in keeping Augment your after pence ; So shall your hopes, which now aro only sleeping, Return with large increase."
