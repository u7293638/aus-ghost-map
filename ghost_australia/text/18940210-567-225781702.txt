THE SECRET OF A HAUNTED HOUSE. A rather carious lawsuit is reported from Paris. A gentleman living in the Avenue de Neui'ly was terribly annoyed with rats in his house. They were large, ravenous, numerous and hard to catch. Finally he managed to trap one of the pests, ond, equipping him with a tiny bell, fastened to his neck with a bit of wire, set bim again at liberty. Tbe rat, of course, ran to find bis companions, and they all ran as eagerly to avoid him, aod in a little time there was not a rat left on the premises. Near by there lived a nervons gentleman, and one night be was awakened by a curious tinkling sound, which came on fitfully, aod seemed to proceed from every corner of the room. He lit a candle, and timorously proceeded to search. There was nothiDg visible, and yet the mysteri ous sound was distinctly audible. He tried to think it was imagination, bnt, failing, decided it mnat be ghosts. It was clear his house was haunted â€” and haunted, too, by day as well as by night. For weeks be couid not sleep, and the anxiety told on bis health. At last, a gossiping servant learned the troth, and tbe victim, instead of laughing at his own credulity, has begua an action agaiust tbe man who belled tbe rat.
