AGNOSTICISM. The devil's dust of Agnosticism fills our lungs. The air is choked with it, and the sky blackens with it as in a London fog. Rivalling the conjuror's sleight of hand, easy eloquence, and belief in the good nature of the crowd he is addressing, this and the other scientific personage comes forward to manipulate his atoms and his molecules, to blow his glittering soap-bubbles over the heads of a distinguished but untrained audience, and to conclude with a burst of rhetoric that we need only change our defini- tion of matter and the hypothesis called Theism will be relegated to the shades where entities and quiddities, the ghosts of un- known bodies lie. There is a mysterious Something, no doubt, and religion so far was justified as a piece of rude, unscientific guess- work, on a level with the primitive imagina- tion which invented it. But whatever that Something may be, we can always, the new teachers say, discount it for an equal quan- tity of matter, and that should be our chief concern. With energies not of a spiritual kind, and with some genius for mechanical arrangement, we may reason backwards and forwards, they tell us, to the hydrogen cloud out of which we came, and into whose fiery depths we and our Cosmos shall one day vanish. â€”William Barry, D.D.. in the Nine- teenth Century.
