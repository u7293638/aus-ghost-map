JOURNALISM IN THE 11 ' SIXTIES. 11 Id an article on ' Londou Pen and Gown |§§| in the Sixties and since, ' contributed to the m! ' Fortnightly Review,' Mr. T. H. S. Ml Escott refers to the 'Tomahawk.' 'Mr, Arthur a Beckett's inventive mind/' he H| says, *' found fresb scope for employment in w launching an entirely new literary enter- |H| prise, the ' Tomahawk.' Just now this B| journal deserves special mention, because. H| in a uegree not second to me u*i, it ek foreshadowed a species of newspaper which ffiR: of late years has been cultivated with ||||| marked success among us. Eliminate ths purely aesthetic elemeut, then a thing un- Wm, dreamed of,, from Mr. Harry Furniss's (SSm newest venture, and a fair idea may be |w formed to-day of what the ' Toma- il|| hawk ' was. The sensation pro- gf|§ duced by it during' it«' brief career |||| was due mainly or exclusively to pll tbe continued labours of Mr. a Beckett with , ||||| his pen, and of the late marvellously clever |p|| draughtsman, Matt Morgan, with his km ; penciL Tbe initial issue took place shortly ijfirl after the miscarriage of the Mexican ex- Wm pedition, dealing, as it did, a fatal blow to sB the prestige of the second French Empire. pSgl; ' Thou canst not say 1 did it/ -was the feS legend under the cartoon in the first WM number — the picture representing tbe ghost of the murdered Maximilian ; the words proceedihg from Wie lips of the horror stricken Napoleon the Little. Nor was th& leading illustration in the second instal ment of this print less powerful, the BE subject being the return from the Derby ||||| in a coach which was driven by Mb| Apollyon. - Tbe premature end of the MB Marquis of Hastings lent just then a special B fiignihcance to the artist's work, and the few 9B pungent linos of Arthur k Beck«t's ||H letterpress accoknpanying it. Asso- «B ciated with Arthur, a Beckett in the m ' Tomahawk ' -vas the late Frank Mar- ||B shall, who seeined to have educated himself on the dramatiets of the Restoration, with literary results sometimes impressive, at others purely droll. Thestafi also included |j|9| the present member for King's Lynn. Mr. &B; T. G. Bowles, who subsequently in his own ' Vanity Fair ' developed some of the |t||| ideas tn which the 'Tomahawk' abounded ; Captain 'Alfred Thompson, ex-dragoon and BB artist, who toeme: yefers afterwards in the jffp ' Mask ' anticipated unconsciously much |H of the peculiar kind of literary or artisiio HB wit 'and humour presented to the public ,«oWi ? Thifc literary child of 'the ** Toma- {|H| hayk/'astbe?' MaBk ': was, signalised for BH 'the first time the |-ervading populaiitj' of |H| ^etiieiUtre, and, outside the journals ot the B| * -was the earliest print that EH rn^de it i pbint to ^courage and to supply H| the histrionic appetite of the general pub- flB lie.7 '- What were then tbe 'distinctive features of Alfred Thompson's journal are JjH 'fcOiday rect^jnised as inaipehsable in »U ^B neirijp^er cutdidatee for popular favour.
