ADDRESS BY MR. W. M'MILLAN, M.L.A. THE WORK OF THE CONVENTION. . UNQUALIFIED SUPPORT OF THE BILL. Mr W McMillan, M L A , delivered an address in the Burwood School of Arts last night upon the work of the Convention The chair was taken by the Mayor (Alderman J H Cardew) Mr J T Walker, one of the federal delegates, was on the platform There was a large attendance, the hill being crowded There were also many ladies pro sent Mr M'Millan pass along and vigorous address He traced the question of federation from the beginning, and then pointed out its national character and insisted that at was a work which must be taken up in earnest, both by the Government and the electors and the country generally He answered a number of the objections which had been raised against the Commonwealth Bill and declared himself to be an unqualified supporter of the proposed constitution The meeting was orderly throughout and Mr M'Millan was loudly cheered at intervals The tone of the meeting was altogether in favour of federation The chairman briefly introduced Mr McMillan, and stated that he was sure they would give him a fair and patient hearing MR M'MILLAN'S ADDRESS Mr McMillan, who on rising was greeted with applause, said that he had to speak to them in a dual capacity in the last place he appeared before them as a citizen like themselves of this country By a mass vote of the people he had the honour of being elected to the Federal Convention, and he could assure them that whatever might be the result of the great work they had undertaken-undertaken and done honestly, and, he believed, v. either should always feel it a very high honour to think that by such an enormous number of votes he was elected OF It representative (Applause ). It seemed to him that there were two men occupying essentially official positions in the Convention-at any rate in the delegation of New South Wales who should be first heard by the people of this country before any private member attempted to voice his opinion He referred, in the first place, to the chosen and elected leader of the Convention, Mr Edmund Barton (Applause ) He considered, and he was sure they would consider, that it was a great honour to the mother colony not merely to have one of the members of its delegation chosen as chief, but to know by the absolute verdict of every man in that Conv oration when the work was closed that that position was nobly sustained (Applause ). The other member to whom he referred was the Right Hon the Premier of this country (Applause ) He was present that night in another capacity. He was there as member of the great and important district, and he would be obliged to tell them that he would have to go away, tom points at any rate, from HUB country on account of his health It was possible, he said possible, that when he came back he might not be the member for Burwood . but, at any rate, according to his medical advisors, it was very probable that if he remained and became their member they would be represented by a ghost, and he did not think, elastic as the constitution was, that even with all their love for him they would care to be represented by him when he got into the better land He now came to deal with this great question of federation, and to say something of the work that they had done in Adelaide, Sydney, and Melbourne Now whatever they might believe, whether they were federationists or aiiti-folerationists, they would all allow that this was a great and noble subject They would all allow that they were rising in this into the highest national endeavour which the politicians had vot attempted-an endeavour which would require and had required all the statesmanship, experience, and ability of the ablest men in Any DISHONEST CONTROVERSY. He wanted to not fairly before them what he believed to be the honest position of this federation question, because he believed that at the present time a great deal of dishonest controversy had taken place, and an attempt was being made to blind the people with regard to the real results of their work There were four kinds of people they had to deal with in this question throughout the length and breadth of the country. In the first place, at one end they had the hardened and practically convinced federationists Those they could understand, and their vote they could count upon At the other end they had the hardened and convinced and, he was quite willing to admit honest anti- federation lets Those they could understand too But lying between these were two sections which demanded their very careful attention In the first place they had a large mass of the people of this country who had studied very little this question of federation They composed the bulk of that honest, sober, quick-thinking class of population on whose verdict this question would depend The people were anxious to learn They wanted to know what to do and to know how to do the right thing, and there was a great danger that if this federation question was not put before the mass of quiet, sober-minded people so that they could thoroughly grasp it, many would fail to go to the poll at all Now he came to the fourth class There is here a number of people at the present time who were auti-federationi9t8 of a peculiar type Some of those people and he would go as for as to say some journals too-were willing to say, and said in the most pronounced terms within the last two years, that sooner than not have Fedora tion they would take the bill of 1891 No matter how determined a fee of the present movement was, no man with tense and with honesty would deny for one moment that as an instrument of democracy, as an instrument of government, and as a liberal measure, the measure that they had completed in Melbourne far exceeded in liberal tendencies the mil of 1891 (Applause ) Now, why had this somersault taken place ? It seemed to him absolutely inexplicable A great many people who were ardent federationists, oven for the bill of 1891, now took up the cry that freetrade would be endangered and that it was impossible for them to federate unless they had some kind of assurance that freetrade would be continued in this country On the other hand, the very people who said that free trade was threatened, said that this constitution was so subversive of the principle of majority rule that when they met in the Federal Parliament the minority would rule Let them take freetrade He had always been of opinion that if they were going to put this constitution before the people of this country the first necessity of every delegate was to be honest with the people (Applause ) Were they going to trust themselves to a Parliament in which the House of Representatives, which n onld shape the fiscal policy of the country more or less, was practically representing the mass of the people ? Nobody would deny for a moment that that House of Representatives represented the mass of the people Did they not know that there were four colonies outside New South Wales in which there was a distinct tendency to protective principles, and that there had been no diminution of that feeling during the last few years ? Was it likely that the policy of those colonies was going to change all in a moment and that the people of this colony were going to retain absolute freetrade as they had it now, when they were joining hand in hand, their 1,260,000 of people, more or less, in a mass community score toning 3,500,000 ? Those men who now denounced federation on the freetrade basis, and who at the same game said that this constitution denied the rights of the majority, were talking the sheerest and the most absolute nonsense When the Enabling Bill was passed by the New South Wales Parliament empowering the colony to elect 10 delegates to the Federal Convention, Parliament at that moment gave its adhesion to federa- tion, yet that Parliament had been the most bitter opponents of the tt York of the Federation Convention That was not a fair way of treating the delegates to the Convention (Hear, hear ) And when 140,000 of the people of New South Wales voted for the election of those delegates it meant that the people concluded the time was ripe for federation (Hear, hear.) He believed that taking all the constitutions of the world at work at the present time the Commonwealth constitution join soon as the names instrument of government on democratic principles that the world had over seen (Hear, hear ) Would anybody doubt that they were not ripe for federa- tion ? With questions of war almost at our doors surely it was time we should rise to the full dignity of a nation and defend ourselves, and not depend upon other people for our defence (Hear, hear ) THE CONSTITUTIONAL MACHINERY The machinery of the Federal Government must be so regulated that whilst they gave the voice of the people full sway they must also give full sway to the voice of the separate communities, and that was what they had done Many of those who had cut cised the bill, instead of doing so in a broad and liberal way, in view of the difficulties that had to be surmounted, had narrowed their criticism down to petty points of detail, and asserted that the system would become chaotic There were two main objections raised by the opponents of the Constitution against its working-bee first was that it was unfair to the larger states and the second that it was too conservative So far as its unfairness to the larger States was concerned, it would be clear to them that no matter how liberal they made the Constitution they must have it so that they did not destroy the federal idea They could not have a federal form of Government without two Houses , yet underlying a great deal of the objection to the hill and the dishonest criticism upon it was a desire by many people to have only one chamber but if they could not have that they desired to so emasculate the Senate as to make it absolutely impotent in the work of government. If they did not give the Senate sufficient power and rights, it would be better to sweep it away out of axis once in every system of government of two chambers one must preponderate, and that must be the one representing the voice of the people 1 bB Convention had trio J to frame two chambers, one of which would represent the federal idea in the Senate so as to safeguard the rights of the States, and the other of which the representation would be practically on the lines of the Legislative Assembly [o would not say the Commonwealth Constitution was the most democratic that could be drawn up, but if it erred in anything it went beyond the present conditions of known constitutional expedients. If in dealing with this question they made a cast iron constitution, incapable of amendment the people might have said that, whilst it was applicable to existing conditions, it would be out of touch with the condition of life in a few years hence He maintained that the Constitution was ten times more liberal and flexible than that of the United States, and should, therefore, be more acceptable to the people of New South Wales (Hear, hear.) It was better that the process of altering the constitution should be slow than that we should alter the constitution in a moment of passion Public opinion would act on the House of Representatives and on the Senate, both being elective bodies, and afterwards the proposed amendments would be submitted to the people by way of referendum In America the constitution was a casbron one, was difficult of alteration and during the whole course of the career of that great people it had been almost impossible to alter the constitu- tion THE SENATE Mr McMillan proceeded to compare the proposed House of Representatives and the Senate with the Houses under the constitution of the United States With all its faults the American Constitution had been a great instrument of Government He gave a description of the manner in which the Senate in America was elected The mode of election was by the Parlia- ments of the States log-rolling there was a blot on the politics of the country. It was worse than the log rolling which took place in New South Wales with regard to the election of the Public Works Committee (Laughter and cheers ) Our Senate was to be elected by a mass vote of the different States This was far more honest and it was as democratic a mode of proceeding as it was possible to conceive (Hear, hear.) The vote for both Houses was one man one vote In one colony over female suffrage would be recognised The Senate of Amen a was decidedly the more powerful of the two Houses It was not merely a legislature, but an executive Here our Senate would not have the right to amend money hills, and matters had been so arranged that in the last resource the Senate must meet the other House and decide any difference which could not be decided any other way But certain objectors had said that the Convention had framed a bill in which they had given away the liberties of the people They said that the House of Representatives was shorn of its rights and that the Senate was made powerful instead of the people's voice being heard and that on great national questions a vate would be carried by a minority of the people But this was not so No money bill could be introduced into the Parliament excepting through the House of Representatives They would know what an enormous power that was The Senate could not alter money bills except- ing with the consent of the House of Representatives The Senate could only make suggestions There was a great deal of difference between suggestion and amendment A suggestion, if adopted, would become the amendment of the Lower House Would any one told him that the House which had full possession of the purse and could not be attacked by the other House was not the preponderant House in any system of government 3 The House of Representatives had also control over the annual Appropriation Bill. But it might be said that the Senate had a right to veto it. Of course the Senate had a right to veto it but supposing the Senate did so what would be the result the result would be that the whole of the machinery of government should stop throughout the length and breadth the country, and it would be practically the same as a revolutionary act Would anyone tell him that any number of men in the Senate elected by the same class of voters as those who sent men to the House of Representatives would be so mad or so suicidal as to stop the bill, which would practically wreck the institutions of the country ? If they did there would be something so radically wrong, in that House that it would require to be sent to the people again Too much stress had been laid upon the character of the Senate as the States HOUSe That House was a part of the system of bicameral government, and he would like to ask the people of this country whether they wanted either in their local Government or under the Commonwealth to give up their rights liberties, and everything dear to their national life to the un- controlled power of one House i Then they were told that the constitution was not sufficiently democratic because they had not introduced into it the referendum It would be absolutely absurd for them to go back upon the representative system of government The referendum was a thing which might do in a country like Switzerland, but it would be absolutely fatal in a country like this Instead of being an appeal to common sense wisdom, and sobriety, it would be an appeal to the class feelings of the country What ever might be the evolution of the future they had nothing to do with it. They had put into the Constitution an elastic clause by which in years to come their children, if so determined, could have this national referendum by a very simple process with out any very great expense or delay, incorporated in the constitution THE FINANCIAL CLAUSES He would now refer to the financial clauses He found thatamongallthottoudcrful financiers scarcely two agreed, and he held that there was UD solution to the financial problem until they met the new conditions in the Federal Parliament. 'Hear, hear ) They know that the first principle after defence as that Federal Bill was the principle of intercolonial free trade It is could be absolutely absurd to talk of federation, of a commonwealth of the people, if every man in that community, as far as commerce was concerned could not go north, south, east, and west through the length and breadth of this country, without any fiscal barrier whatever (Applause ) That being so, at was necessary that the different States should give up their customs duties It was impossible to live intercolonial freetrade without a uniform tariff and as they had a uniform tariff that tariff must be constructed by the Federal Parliament, because in the Federal Parliament they brought together all the interests of Australia, whereas if they attempted to form a uniform tariff in the different states it would have to go through five or six different Parliaments and it it would be utterly impossible to make it um form then Therefore everyone agreed that the fundamental basis of this union was intercolonial freetrade, a uniform tariff, and a surrender of customs to the centre of administration (Applause ) the gate over the whole of their customs let them say, roughly, ii OOO.OOO or £6,01)0,000-and also gave over certain other things, such as post office quarantine, defence, and so on All things were it on voter in this bill which were essentially federal, that which everybody agreed could be better administered by the Federal Govern intent that by the local Government When the new tariff came into existence all the expenditure on these services would be first covered, so that if the federal tariff realised £6,000,000, and the expenditure of the Federal Government was £1,500,00, a sum of £4,500,000 would be available for distribution amongst the States But they could not distribute the £1,500,000 on a per capita basis, because if that were done New South Wales under her freetrade policy would lose considerably, whilst Victoria under her protectionist policy would gain considerably This was one of the things on which they must trust the Federal P irliamont to arrange a satisfactory settlement, and if they could not trust the fe eral Parliament to whom they gave over Their customs revenue then they had better not federate at all He was sorry n provision had been included in the light at the instigation of Sir Edward Braddon that it area quarters of the federal revenue collected must be returned to the States That was a blot on the bill because no OLD could f cresco the financial necessities of Um Federal Government, and by this piece of machinery they rendered it absolute nonsense It also involved the danger that the Federal Treasurer might resort to improper means for raising federal revenue In this matter they should trust the federal Parliament-ourseh es and surely tt o could trust yourself ea FEDERATING THE RAILWAYS Certain people said that the real days should be federated, but he held that the time was not ripe for that He believed the time would come when they must be consolidated and ruled by one head, but as They were necessary for the development of the rch Sand resources of the colour their control should be retained by the State Had they bands I the rail M says over to the Federal Parliament it it could have given an enormous impetus to the anti-federal more meat, because it would be said they at ere giving over some of the best machinery of their national life It was absolutely untrue, and a false fication of the work of the Convention, for some people to say that the delegates had given away the rights of the people New South Wales (Cheers ) It was said that the merchants of New South Wales Were opposed to federation owing to the colony having become prosperous dinner her freetrade policy, but if they were prosperous now, would they will become truce is prosperous when the fiscal barriers which now separated the colonies were broken down i (Hear, hear ) Prot vision had been made in the bill against deadlock Deadlocks simply showed that bulb horses were desperately an earnest in the interests of the people who were not dangerous things the majority of deadlocks would not occur on finance Sides would not be taken by the States but the dead- locks would be very much like the lights he had had between freetrade and protection in our own colony than anything else Was it not better to bat of dead looks under some circumstances than to have the country pledged to a legislature which it might in a little time be ashamed of the real remedy for deadlocks to as the common sense of the people. The post er of public opinion would be felt within a reasonable period and one at the hearnes would have to give way But had been decided by their democratic enemies that they must have some safety-valve, and the safety valve was the simultaneous dissolution of both Houses If the Houses did not then Seeland that was a far- fetched idea they met together and a certain majority decided the issue That was as reasonable and as radical a method as any man could hope for In fact this was as democratic a proposal as the world had ever seen (Applause ) THE OPPONENTS OF THE BILL They had then facts before them, and he was Slot attempting to draw upon his original lion and he assisted, therefore, that the onus of proving that this constitution would be a failure must be left to the opponents of the bill dear. I , inmate of the people had declared that they coroner for federation the great majority wanted national union they wanted a bill of some kind Even if the constitution were less liberal, the character, heritage, and experience of British people and British descendants could mould it into strips If they desired a constitution to give them national life, to give them a position amongst the civilised nations of the world, and to make them one of the strongest factors in the British Empire because they a are all agreed that this was to he a Constitution under the Crown -(applause they wanted any or all of these things Were they going to reject this Constitution {- (enes ex" No, no "this Constitution which had been framed by 10 of their own men with 10 representatives from each of the other colonies Any opposition of this kind would not he an honest opposition It was not an opposition which bore in mind all the difficulties and dangers which had to be surmounted by British people under constitutions which did not contain half of the Liberal loss which existed in this one It was idle to say that this little thing was wrong and that that small thing was wrong They could amend the constitution afterwards if necessary The opponents of federation either ignored the framework of the constitution, or they did not an ant federation at all THE POSITION OF THE GOVERNMENT After speaking in favour of the judiciary clauses of the hill, Mr M'Millan expressed gratification that the Prime Minister had said that he would vote for the bill (Cheers ) At any rate Mr Reid had said that he would not actively oppose it. He did not want to say one word to irritate Mr Reid or anyone else During this campaign they ought to insist upon a friendly feeling between all the delegates, and they should all speak as one man in this great national cause This was a great national movement, and he did not see how the Government could stand still (Cheers) The Government must take sides It was not simply a question for the delegates It was a matter which must over- shadow everything else The Premier had said that, with all its faults, he would vote in favour of the measure, and it was within the power of the Ministers of the Crown to carry it triumphantly through (Applause ) Let them throw aside cow from that day all this dishonesty, which was going like a cancer over the country on this question, let them say whether they were federationists or not let them say whether this bill was so bad and so corrupt that it could not be amended in the time to come, and that sooner than subject New South Wales to its operation they would wreck the movement altogether Out were they going to get a bill that would do some particular favour to New South Wales as against all the other self-governing colonies of Australia ? Was that what the manhood and the fairness of New South Wales demanded He said no A DEMOCRATIC CONVENTION. They sent there 10 men from each community Who were they? Were they Conservatives, Tories, plutocrats i No If over there was a democratic Com cation in this world that one which met in Adelaide, Sydney, and Melbourne was free and liberal, representing the latest evolution of political ideas throughout this country (Applause ) There was not a single man, except one perhaps in the delegation of South Australia, that could not be called an advanced Radical With the exception of two in Victoria they were all the most adv ahead Radicals of the country, supported by the most Radical paper in Australia Take them from New South Wales Well, they might say that they were half and half (Laughter ) But he said most distinctly that the preponderating power in that Convention was radical And he said also that thousands and thousands of men who, a short time ago accepted the bill of 1891 because at any rate it was something, and the necessity for fedederubou was paramount, wore injecting wilfully and dis- honestly a constitution which was 10 times more liberal (Applause ) Ihorefoi o let them face the issue Let the Government face the HIBUO, whether the question be made one of local politics or not under the shadow of this great cause, with all the circumstances surrounding them at this moment, he said that federation, and federation only, was the great question of the day Let them educate the men throughout the length and breadth of this country Let them show them that they were not mere experimentalists, and while their enemies called the bill conservative, it was only conservative to the oxbul that was necessary Why should it not be conservative I ' Did they want a constitution that could be played with every hour so that no man would know where he stood in his rights and in his liberties ( Did they want a country tubes for p, parish of for an empire V They had never known what it was to take up their national privileges and national responsibilities, nor did they Jiuovy that in 12 that they would not be launched in a war which would devastate the world ? Did they want a constitution that a few members of Parliament could blown to atoms man outbreak of passion, foolish, absurd, and criminal i They wanted a constitution conservative certain limits, based upon a solid foundation based upon the foundations of their British instincts and bontago-and at the same time pa Double that at could he modified to meet new watliUons, so that they pages flying pp pi AIMS tralia a race of men instinct with British habits and Brush freedom, and determined that their constitu ton a would not be a mere paper constitution of theorists and madcaps, but it could be based upon the common sense of the people, and would last for all time (Applause ) MR M MILLAN AND HIS CONSTITUENTS He now wished to speak to them as voters in the Burwood electorate He found it would be impossible owing to the necessity for recruiting his health in another crime to be here at the next general election, and if was necessary for him to look to those who desired to support him to do their best in his absence When he found he would have to be absent he made up his mind to resign his seat, but as it was unanimously decided at a meeting of a large number of his supporters that he should allow himself to be again nominated he decided to do so, though he knew it HOB putting a great strain on the constituency to be away from the goueralelections a second time He also felt strongly the fact that He would also be away from the federal campaign, but he had been compelled to resort to the imperator of orders of his medical adviser (Hear hear) Out a motion of Alderman Simeon a hearty vote of thanks was accorded to Mr M Millan, and the meeting closed with a vote of thanks to the chairman _
