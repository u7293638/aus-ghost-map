But to again in all forms of self must be given up, and from the moment a man gave himself thus wholly to God the Holy Ghost would come and dwell in his heart To succeed in their (york men must be in earnest, and to be in earnest they must have this Pentecostal blessing and speak. from hearts filled with the Spirit They would then have such a revival of the old-time religion in their churches as would turn Sydney and Melbourne upside down and shake the world as had been done on the day of Pentecost the Rev W M Dill Macky also delivered an address upon the same lines, pleading for more recognition of Pentecostal Christianity in the churches A tea was provided at of 30, followed by a de- votional meeting preparatory to the evening gather- ing The evening meeting was well attended, the body of the hall being, played, necessitating the lust gallery being thrown open A trained choir under Mr Gilbert assisted with the singing, the hymns being from a hymn-book specially issued for the occasion by the convention committee There were also present on the platform and in the meeting the Revs E Masterman, B Danks, John Dixon and Archdeacon Langley (Church of England) W G Taylor, b C Kent, John Watsford, B Dey, L Fox, S Wilkinson, A W Wood (Geelong), and others.

They would be Chest like because Christ possessed and would transform Sydney and bring glory to God on earth and in heaven, and would be used in a way they had no conception of at present Christ would Shine on their faces and walk with them, and dwell in their boats The Rev A. W Webb spoke from the words " That Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith " This, he said, was just another way of putting the old Pentecostal blessing It presented a lofty ideal of God dwelling in His temple with the Christian If the Church ever became what God desired, it would be through having the indwelling Christ in their hearts It was not metaphorical language as some held, but represented a fact and an experience The heart represented the throne and the centre of their being, and here it was Christ was to dwell, supreme and absolute in His control. When Christ tuns regulated their lives He would bring order from disorder, would expel all that was evil, and would promote the growth of every virtue by the Holy Spirit Then when once they had surrendered their hearts to the Holy Spirit they must keep surrendered Then would they comprehend with all sames the knowledge and love of Christ but not till then, because nothing but love could comprehend and understand love An after meeting was held, closing with prayer. i It is estimated that about 250,000,000 bricks are used mostly in the United Nations,
