TIHE lt oMANISINcI PARTY IN TIIE ENGLISH CHURCII. To the Editor of the Examiner. Stl,-Iln a recent work by , clergryman of the English Church there occurs it pasago which ought to he pollered by members of that church in this islarl. The paslsag is as fol lows:--" Mcrk it, Nearly 20,000t men of in telligenco nol learning have, before God and man, aolomly odeclared that they helieveol themselves moved by the Holy Ghost to take uToi them theo inistry of Goo'a wod, a lnd to be truly called according to the will of our Lord Jeuos Christ and thie ote or ofr c of rhi, rnealn to the olltco uf; orring ino the church of thisr lnd. Of thee Imeo, duly ordained upon faith of their pleldge, ,no fewer than 2t20 now stoand be forothe world eoltmitted to i act of traitortiun which nothting i these hist ldas murnof its kind, oparallledl. T'heno 2-1201 clergy haye publicly accepted andotl dorsl ?a work by all enlinlt dignitary in the church, a work which oexidaino away all that is distrinctively Protestant in tie Thlrty.nne o rtilel of Religion, and to thle plat Ilio o lmeaning of which every minister of the Eltablished Church is swornr; which asserts that there is nmo vital ilffercc between the dlctrines of Itomoe's Anti-Scripturul Council of Trent amul tile dotriner of our Scripturol Churchl ; lwhich teaches the dlogmc: tlht there it o loR tuOymS?o o ou r cm C mOlide.tit' protoU thefle .ord Jesus Chli?et in tie Euclhrist (that it, in tlh breiad and inoe ater clcsccratilou); which advtcotes tlhe anointing of the ick ; lwhich sug geots that, after all, tournohstantittioon is pro boldy it question of words ; which rlpeaks Iof thle holuy separtion iof the BIritilsh Churclh froai Antichrirt at tlu lthforlnatio as t mlioerbldo q uarrel; whllolh exalts priestly aoIhelu tiuon of sinnoers; which ap)proves of tle work of thr original Traotaritrns to, Cthlolicic England ; which dart to go the lperilous length of teach igi that if any slouldttiea the feet of a ncrulo.r it would ho reverelce to the Crucitiel; andl which concludes with tlhe asuortion that the uothonr woull gladly dieo to unite tl C(:hurch of IEnglandl withl tlhe fllen Church of Itome and the corruptt (tr eck Churhl.
