Friendship's Ideal Shattered. THE stately lady, the grave, calm man, Stood on the terrace together ; 'Mid the bright rose thickets the revellers strayed, From lawn to fountain the children played, And hidden music sweet melodies made, At the fete in thc summer weather. With careless, languid courtesy, She bent to hear him speak Of tlie newest book and thc latest play, Of the keenest move in tho statesman's fray, Of the freshest topic of tho day, Or tho marvel of tho week. ' Lightly with his practised tongue He touched on all and each, With here a sneer and there a jest, And now a grave word as to attest " I give you tho foam on tho top-the rest No passing hand can reach. " Yet once-ah me, how long ago \ Each ono believed in the other ; When every uttered word of his Seemed as true to ber as love's first kiss. Will the ghost of friendship's heart-felt blina Any more his sad faults cover? The measure of the music changed. On the summer breeze there stole A low, sweet, simple, homely ah1, Such as ono listens to everywhere ; To tho two who lounged on the terrace there, , It spoke as to heart and soul. A vivid flush on tho false bronzed fade, A tear in the hazel eyes, Then back to tho world and its talk again Enlightenment closed tho wound ; such pain Repeated, would make another insano In the path where duty cries.
