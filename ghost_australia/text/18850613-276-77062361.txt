A. Hon on Iiov Eggs. AH I tvh I this Urns I've got, I think, just five, White as the moon upon an August night. I long to see the oontenta well alive, lor those ohioks, still unborn, are my delight. My eldest ogg-now let me pause and;see: He'll bo a valiant rooster-bird, of courso, Having the graae of the ailantus tree, A linnet's voioe, the brute strength of a horse, My seoond, I must vory fondly dream, Will be B.poula de lettrea, and very wise; She in linguistics will be held supreme, And she will learn the idiom of tne flies, That third, delioioua, spookled egg of mine Will bring me forth the handsomest of males, With military genius, I opine A fowl the foe of garden slugs and snails, That other there-that dotted little dear Will oause my poor maternal mind regret j For she will be, I positively fear, The wayward Cleopatra of my Bet, But, nh I the one that has a beauty mark Right on the top, from Duty ne'er will quail; She, Christian-like, will suffer in the dark And be the ohiokena' Florence Nightingale. So saying, the hen oluoked loudly in her joy. And waved her wings upon the unhatonea eggs; But then appeared a stalwart poultry-boy, With squinting eyes and odious crooked legs t Ho Bei7.ed her offspring right before her eyes, Took tho three best, the ones she prized the moat. And, to the mother's infinite surprise, Vanished around the oorner like a ghost 1 And, while she hurried after him to say, " Spare, spare my children, and be ever blest I" A weasel, who had seen no food that day. Happened to tramp along, and sack the rest. -Gupli, Jones,
