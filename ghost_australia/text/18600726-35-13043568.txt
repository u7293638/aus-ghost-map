I MARGARET-STREET. To the Editor of the Herald. I -.-Suc,-Time'wtis when I held the keys of all the gold and silver-the " milk and honey of the Australian "land of Canaan," and under another designation Hthe Old Treasury). I was courted by the most exalted and the most humble in those days, and from my heart I believe I was the most interesting person age at the Antipodes ; my old iron gate being guarded and military honours paid me diumally. Now how changed my position ! intellect and her dearest offspring Improvement are said to have advanced everywhere, but, indeed, and alas, one unforgotten speck on this great globe and that is-but I must forget myself, and the fair face that Nature gave me ! Daguerreotype, Sir, my old and furrowed cheeks after every ruthless storm, and let your Murphy, Mayor, wipe away a tear at his remissness! Ghost of Macadam, stoney and lion-hearted as you used to was to become, oh come to me ! \- MARGARET-STREET.
