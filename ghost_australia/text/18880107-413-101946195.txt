A CHBISTMAS GHOST STORY. Tiirc Manning River Time* is responsible for fchc following gruesome gbo.it Btory:-" TV* apparation which caused a good deal of excitement a few months ago at Bungay hn again made its appearancc-so we learn from a credible source. A12 old and much rcspecto resident at Bungay (Mr. li, Cameron) was riding home from Wingham a few evening* ago, when a man dressed in black, wearing a high hat, and riding a black horse, rode up to him and gave a groan. Mr Cameronwasa bit unnerved, and asked : "Who is getting murdered." The horseman is said to have given a heavy moan, and disappeared over a precipice of about loft. Mr. Cameron's horse was frightened, and bolted through the bush. ; Three nights later Mr. J. Cameron (son of the fcrmer) was riding homo by the sumc route, and met with a like experience, when his horse also bolted. The horses con not now be got to pass the haunted spot. Mr Cnmeron inspected the place where the strange being disappeared over the precipice the next day, hut uo traces of a horse's hoofs were visible. This intelligence has been re eeived with amnzement by many on the Upper Maunihg, as Mr. Cameron is too well known to be suspected of concocting a story like the above, and too sensible to be fright* cued by a willÂ«o'-thc*whip."
