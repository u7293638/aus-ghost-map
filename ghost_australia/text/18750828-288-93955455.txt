TO THE BDITOB. Sir — I hope yon will allow me to say a word in reply to *' J. A. H.'.' In his letters be classes f reeeducation with pauperism, and says we are, going to make paupers of our children by giving them free education. I ask 'J. A.H.' if the ' working men objected, to the Go '-eminent grant I to the Unlvers&yv; Ko ; they, considered one I was wanted in the colony, and they won't I call those children paupers who go there, , feat they claim the same privilege for their children they so willingly concede to their , wealthy fellow-colonists. Then' J. A. H.' asks, what is to become «f all -our private schools. First he says that all the teachers will be -thrown out ' of employment ; then he says people 'will send their children to private schools in preference to free sohook if the pri vate one is best, ' ' J, A. H.' reminds me of the time when' railways were first; opened in England. People ^aid if these railways go on what ia to become- of our coaobmen and post boySi ko say nothing of the poor coachmakers and horses? Well, railways did go onv and so will free education until every child in Her Majesty's dominions shall be able to lead and write. But "J. A. H." says we want to tax the whole community ?^ to educate childrfenr afslxpence a' week. I can inform 'J. A.H.' that the land we live in belongs to those oTuldren who bave been born and who have yet to be born in the colony, and all they ask is that a portion of that land be kept back from sale, and that it be let on lease. The rent will then pay all that will ever be required for education, for as the inhabitants increase so will the price of the land, and 'J. A. H.' will, find the education tax gatherer oDly a ghost. . ?-?- ! ? .::... a, .: . ' ' ? ;J, E. *Ii ' Mount Gambler, August 16.
