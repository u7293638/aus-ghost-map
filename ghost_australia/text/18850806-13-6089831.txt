THE BISHOP OF MELBOURNE'S LECTURES. THE GALATIAN LAPSE. The Town-hall was filled in every part yesterday afternoon on the occasion of the delivery by the Bishop of Melbourne of the second of his series of lectures on the " Cula- tura Lapse." The Bishop said We have to ask to day the question, what was the influence under the impulse of which the Galatians fell ' And that brings us into the very heart of a controversy, now, indeed, in its unmediated antagonism a lump; of the past, but Bull living on, and received this very year by Professor Pfleiderer, not in Berlin, where he is Professor of Theology, but in London, The theory of the earlier Tubingen school, that there was a bitter feud between the apostles of the circumcision and of the uncircumcision, and an irreconcilable opposition between their doctrines, may now be regarded to use the words of Archdeacon Farrar, as a religious romance, " founded on the words of our epistle, " before that certain came from James " I am, far, however, from thinking that the controversy aroused by the publication of that romance was useless It brought out a great deal! that was interesting about the currents of opinion in the primitive church. It shows 1 us that the church of the first century, instead of enjoying that purity and peace which we fondly attribute to it, was even more distracted by disputes and slanders than that of our own time, thatthegoldenage is quite as much a dream in the history of the Christian Church as in the traditions of das Bic ii poetry that human nature has never for long been less intractable than we find it, and that, especially, the Apostle Paul was pursued and persecuted by a Christian sect with an unscrupulous and malignant hatred which might even have excited surprise amongst ourselves I see that Professor 1 lederer still believes, not only that the Gospel according to St Luke was an tremors between the Pauline Gospel according to St Mark and the anti Pauline Gospel according to St Matthew, but also that when St James wrote " Ye see that by works a man is justified and not by faith only, he made a direct polemical reference, not to those who had abused St Paul's doctrine, but to that apostle himself I cniiseenosuflicient justification for such conclusions They appear to me to be the last survivals of a theory being rapidly driven out of the field of thought, and only now interesting as forcing us to contemplate steadily initial differences in Christian doctrine which we might otherwise overlook or treat too lightly That there was a difference of mental attitude and disposition between St. Paul and St. James and that this difference in the nature of the two men expressed itself in the form of their teaching, and carried them not seldom into sympathy with opposite sides, is, I believe, all but demonstrated That there is not, for instance, in the whole epistle of St James a single direct reference either to the incarnation, the atonement, justification by faith, or the conflict between the flesh and the spirit, is a fact which speaks volumes To review the controversy left us by the Tubingen school would be, shower or, an endless and unprofit- able task. Instead, therefore, of wasting your time in such an effort, I will endeavour to lay before you as concisely as I can the true history of the rise and progress of the Jewish Christian opposition to St Paul It will be necessary to begin with the apostle's own proof of the independence of that preaching which he calls " his gospel " It is certainly startling, when we come to think of the matter closely, to be told by one who never knew the Lord in the flesh that he neither received the truth which he preached from ian neither was he taught it, but by the revelation of Jesus Christ What can the apostle mean' we are disposed to ask Does he mean that he knew nothing whatever of what the Lord said and did while he was upon earth' If so, how can he be a Christian, where can he have learned the spiritual principles of his Masters teaching? Surely in that case, he ought to lay claim to be an original founder, and not a mere disciple of Jesus Christ So far however, is the apostle from making any such claim, that there is not one of the twelve of whom we could say as unreservedly as of St Paul, that he entirely lost himself in the Saviour He not only calls himself the slave of his heavenly Master, declaring that he is determined to know nothing among men but " Jesus Christ and Him crucified, but he looks upon all his work as the mere outflow of Christs energy, and upon his own spiritual existence even, as nothing but an indwelling of Christ within his soul If, then, he owes every thing to Christ, and jet gained nothing from men, can he mean to say that he was made to live over again in vision the whole earthly career of his Master, and so, as it were to see and hear for Frasier, and so, as n. were, in nee mm near ear himself at first hand ? No shadow of such a claim 18 anywhere made What, then, does St. Paul mean by claiming independence for his gospel' I think we are compelled to conclude that when he spoke of his gospel as distinct from that of others, he was referring to that special form of truth into which the great spiritual principles and doctrines connected with his Masters life and death had been cast in the course of his own meditation and teaching IJiur himself observes that St. Paul must have been well acquainted with the outward facts of his Masters earthly career 'these he might easily have learnt, if indeed he needed then to learn them, while staying with Ananias at Damascus after his conversion but every ordinary Christian knew those facts And to know them was to be a long way still from St Paul s conception of his Master's eternal relation to mankind Many vital questions would remain still to be asked How had Christ's death and resurrection affected the application of the principles of his teaching ' show had his relation to the church been changed by the outpouring of Pentecost' Above all, how was a Christian's relation to the law altered by the death of Ulm who bore its curse' Upon this last question especially the Lord had left no ex Elicit instructions He had said indeed that Us kingdom v. as to he as wide as the world But then, as every Jew hoped that obedience to the law would be equally universal, there was nothing in mere universality to limit legal obligation No doubt Jesus had carried his spiritualism of the law so far as to imply in effect its abolition 1 or what would become for instance, of all that mass of legal precepts which implied service at the temple, if in the new era men were to worship the Father neither at Samaria nor at Jerusalem ? Or how would a law command universal and perpetual respect of any portion of which it could be truthfully said that it was not good in itself, but only added because of the hardness of men's hearts ? ' Still all this was so far mere matter of inference and before men will surrender the habits, and especially the privileges of age and generations, they demand an authority more explicit than mere inference loa thought the man, taking this into account, the mine date outlook of Christianity) at the period of St. Paul 's conversion was very grave indeed So doubt it had made many converts among the chosen people but then all these were zealots for the law They frequented the temple services and sacrifices, kept the Sale baths and ordinances, observed all the national laws and customs, and, in a word, ? First news lil over their neighbours to appeared most likely to their neighbours to have become the better Jews for having turned Christians lins appears all the more likely from the fact that after the short, sharp spasm of persecution, of which the chief victims were first Stephen, and then after an interval James the Church of Jerusalem had peace for 30 years Christians, indeed, in Jerusalem would appear to their neighbours, and probably to themselves, to that portion of Israel who believed that the long expected Messiah had come in Jesus of laborers, had sanctified their hearts by His spirit, and would soon come again to restore the kingdom to Israel There was nothing in such a position as this, either on the one side to excite bitter animosity) or on the other to impel Christians to separate themselves from the law, and it refill) seemed for a moment as if the might) entire mass of Pentecost might sink into respectable legalism, as it Christianity might be strangled in its cradle by the iron band of the law as it it might sink into an obscure JcvvibIi Beet, and disappear in the national ruin, instead of breaking its teeth rs, spread >ng its mighty spiritual pinions and chum ing the universal heaven in its home but then just at the crisis, the Invite Lord of the Kingdom fulfilled his eternal counsel by LEAVEY C° w i Pauline < s, "lî'iS0T"* A»0"10 of the Gentiles was If 15 4 From that hour- Jews Christ ^"¿iLVY5 n!«e;e«ish master who had on "Galtee but the line away from Al i,,, r¡ri,,r,,,,,Lror' was '""' arrested man in his, career of persecution, and sent him to" labour at the ends of the earth Not then to those lady teachers (did he go, who were apparently settling down into a received position among the Jews, but away into the far Arabian wilderness-a wa), I believe, like 1 high to the terrible rocks of desert burnt itself There he would be still away from the noise and babble of the world. There alone with God he would commune with his own heart on the meaning of the awful blessed lamps which had happened to him there, in those stern desolations, which spoke so solemnly of the laws iron demand Is, he would ponder the relations of God's ancient word to the soul shaking thoughts which under Divine inspiration were shaping them selves within him He had a present to realise, a past to understand, and in the light of both a great vague, heart troubling future to anticipate 'where he lived, thought, and prayed, how long we know not, but long enough at least to enable him to gain a firm spiritual hold of the truth he was seeking -the relation, viz., of his risen and glorified Lord to his own heart, to the word of God, to the Christian Church, and to the miserable dying heathen world Then, after three years, he went to Jerusalem to see Peter, and abode with him 15 days. A blessed season of refreshing we cannot doubt, for the solitary and thought vexed man 1 or not less by his sunny Christian sympathy than by his affectionate memories of their common master SS Peter must have comforted the heart and enlarged the knowledge of the mighty convert. His visit would seem to have been for the Apostle Paul an almost private one, for other of the Apostles, he tells us, he saw none in the course of it save James the Lords brJlher Now the Apostle skips a long and, for him, some very stormy period, that of his first call to miss Hionnry work, and that of his first Gentile mission in company with Barnabas On their return to Antioch the Apostles are first confronted by that Jewish Christian opposition which was henceforth to be the worst earthly cross which St Paul was called upon to bear Certain men came down from Judea, who began to teach the Gentile brethren at Antioch that it was necessary for them to be circumcised Paul and Bar rains resisted this claim with all their might From what we know of the former, woman be sure that he would have resisted it to the end had he stood alone in the church and in the world But in that event the Christian church must have been divided into two camps, which, instead of joining their forces to assail Bin and ignorance, would have exhausted each other in mutual conflicts 'This must be avoided at all hazards It was resolved, therefore to refer the whole question in dispute to the Apostles and elders in Jerusalem there for the first and only time in his life, St Paul met the three great pillars of the Christian church Peter and John, and James, the Lord s brother, two of these four at least being the greatest prophets and thinkers of their time Never, in all her stormy history, has a greater crisis overtaken the church for the issue to be decided was not less than this-Whether the church of Christ should remain a Jewish sect or become a world wide kingdom, The action of the Apostle Paul was as wise as it was self effacing lie went at once to the leaders of the Christian church, and communicated to them clearly what that Gospel was which he had been preaching among the Gentiles At once they accepted it as the truth, and gave to him and Barnabas the right hand of fellowship At the council which hand of fellowship At the council which was assembled to consider the matter, Paul and Barnabas, with admirable wisdom, said nothing about principles, but confined themselves to giving a faithful account of the manner in which God the Holy Ghost had blessed their preaching With good and pious men this is always a power ful argument It was the fait accompli which silenced those who objected that Peter had eaten with men uncircumcised in the house of Cornelius. "'the Holy Ghost fell on them, cried the Apostle, and who was that I could resist God I It was substantially the same argument which was advanced now by Paul and Barnabas and to it, we may suppose, even more than to the Pauline address of St Peter was it true that opposition faded away 'I be matter seemed to be decided by Apostolic authority and the act of God But then arose James, and though he has nothing to urge either against the principles of Peter or the acts of Paul, he is obviously not prepared to advance as far as either in practice he proposes accordingly a compromise, which, while affirming the liberty of the Gentiles, shall leave Jewish converts to live as they have lived hitherto , providing, moreover, that for charity's sake, to avoid giving offence to Jewish brethren, the Gentiles shall observe certain restrictions in eating; Substantially this was a victory for St Paul On the main point of the obligation of circumcision, it affirmed the freedom of the Gentiles And at first, perhaps, this might have seemed all which was necessary Time, however soon revealed the essential weakness of this compromise. In such a church, for instance, as that at Antioch, where Jewish and Gentile Christians mixed at meals, and specially at the Again, dissension might at any time be introduced by Jewish brethren They might urge that to a proper keeping of the law, separation from the meals of the uncircumcised, even when those under conversed were Christian brethren, was an absolute necessity relaxations might be permitted no doubt to the weakness of the poor Gentiles, but still, you know, if they were asked privately their own opinion of such Christianity, they must say that the less they had to do with it the better At Jerusalem, under the presidency of the Lord's own brother, they felt themselves in the Kingdom of God, but it Antioch, orEphesus, or any of those objectionable places in the Gentile outlands, while they would not positively say that they preferred synagogues church, still it well nigh came to that they might, indeed, worship with such disciples, but as for eating with them, that they would never do, and they looked anxiously for the time when the leaders of the church, discovering the mistake would revert to the holy strictness of the jet uncorrupted Church of Jerusalem Meanwhile, how was St Paul treating this question of allowed Jewish conformity ' More and more he spoke of the law as a mere national code, good perhaps for the Jews so long as their national polity subsisted, but binding on no man whether born a Jew or a Gentile Degeneration of heart could never be obtained along the line of obedience to law in the battle against sin, law was nothing, and circumcision was nothing but only faith, which worketh by love A Gentile Christian was bound to avoid circumcision and holiday keeping in order to show that he trusted only in the grace of Christ What bitter exasperation such teaching would produce among Christian Pharisees we can easily conceive That the Gentile Christians in the name of Paul should brush aside their scruples and laugh at their airs of superiority, would be far worse than if some irreverent nonconformist or low churchman should rudely tell a ritualist nowadays that his religion was not one of clothes and postures, but of heart and life Worse, I say, because the ritualism to which these Christian Pharisees clung so tenaciously was that of an alien faith they could not call themselves Royalists, and yet they wanted to live as Moaaiats and to impose a Mosaic manner of life upon all others-an inconsistency of which they must have been intently conscious, and which must have made them all the more ready to take offence, because it exposed them to a crushing an ewer At length the position became so intolerable that they resolved to endure it no longer , but to make an end of it at once by crushing Paul, its chief defender, before his admirers at Antioch their plot was astutely conceived Not a word would they say against the decree of the council The Gentiles should attend their unclean ban quels without a word of protest from them But then they would claim and publicly exercise those rights of which thank God, the decree had not deprived them By carefully abstaining from attendance at all Gentile meals they would mortify the pride of these upstarts, and teach them their natural inferiority The time for this demonstration will craftily chosen Peter, and Paul, and Barnabas were all at Antioch and what they openly) did in the presence of these great leaders could never afterwards be called in question Day by day, then, the Jewish plotters passed the public boards of the Gentiles with cold and reserved demeanour carefully separating themselves and doubtless making as much stir as they could about their ostentatious ccromonitthsms Can you not easily realise the immense effect of such conduct upon the Gentile brethren? Do as they would they could not help respecting a Tew Was not the Lord Jesus a Jew' \\\ttsnnt Paul their great teacher, a Jews Was not the mother church of the whole Christian world still Jewish?

You are a Jew, he cries, it then in times past ) you have eaten freely with the Gentiles, seeing no harm in it, how is it now that by your example you are teach- ing these Gentiles that they ought to live as Jews' Do you think that it Jou create a higher sacerdotal caste in the church all these ignorant people will not be anxious to press into it' Besides, the evil is not only a practical, it is much more a doctrinal one If you observe these prosaic restrictions you acknowledge the binding obligation of the ceremonial law. Now, I appeal to you is an honest man do you believe that Nay, do we not both know that it is your faith, as it is mine, that "a man is not justified by works of law, but by the faith of Jesus Christ'' how, then, can you be so unfaithful to your trustees to put it in peril by your equivocal conduct ' It may seem little to us, perhaps, after all these years, when the fierce passions of the primitive age have burnt themselves out, that St Paul had the courage to stand forth. and in the presence of the arrogant Pharisees, to rebuke their greatest leader to his face But not the less was it a grand and heroic deeds and not the less did it carry with it far reaching and momentous consequences The whole Jerusalem plot was blown to pieces. These men could never afterwards creep into Gentile churches and allege that the great Peter had refused to eat with the uncircumcised, while their audacious champion Paul had held his peace. No, the result was of the very opposite kind Peter was too honest a man to carry deception or unreality one step further, when once its inception had been faithfully pointed out to him. And there fore, Horn that time onward, the gratified Gentiles could report that the attempt to create a Jewish caste in the church had indeed once been made at Antioch with the tacit support of Peter and Barnabas, but that as soon as Paul had lifted up his thunder voice of truth all had submitted to it, and once more the Agence were eaten in common. With the heart of a woman, when his dear children forget him or treated him unkindly, Paul had the courage of an archangel when the truth of God was endangered. Mobs were nothing to him, and very little more were kings and procurators, but to have stood forth thus alone, not only against Peter, but also his own true yoke- fellow, Barnabas-to have thrown not only all tear but all friendship to the winds, when loyalty to the Lord Jesus demanded it when loyalty to the corn jesus demanded in proves the apostle to have been one of those great and linely-tcmpcred souls, very rarely fashioned in our human clay by which God executes the purposes of eternity Many were the lands and fortunes through which the glorious apostle was to pass before his next and his bitterest trial from the Christian Pharisees party was to come upon him. At first that party seems to have been paralysed by the terrible blow which St. Paul had dealt it. For of their movements during the three years of the apostle's Ephesian ministry we know little or nothing At Ephesus, in the school of Tyraunus, St Paul had time not only to preach to men from all parts of Greece and Asia, but also gradually and insensibly to beat out into perfect form and clear expression those views of human regeneration through Christ which He afterwards poured forth with such perfect mastery in the epistles to Galata and Rome His own thoughts, I cannot but believe, were gradually dealing themselves of every confusing association Their change in a positive direction may not have been marked, but as his greater epistles show, they were becoming negatively sharper and less tolerant of uncomfortable elements They were falling, too, into his temple shape, finding their logical relation to each other and the great thoughts of the earlier dispensation should any new need arise, the apostle would be found ready to strike harder and straighter than ever before. And soon a very terrible need approached The Pharisees Christian party were changing their tactics St Paul in person they dared not meet His word was a thunderbolt which shattered their flimsy sophisms to pieces in a moment but none the less they hated him, and were resolved upon destroying his influence. He might be great, but he was not ubiquitous, and the plan they now resolved on was characteristic of the slow, persistent, deadly hate of baffled fanatics. While he was making his line orations in the school of Tyrannus, and shining like a star before the motley crowds of Ephesus, they would quietly creep into the churches which he had left undefended in Greece and Galatea. No doubt it seemed to them that he had broken the terms of the Jerusalem compromise, for what else than that was it to deprive them practically of that Jewish privilege of exclusiveness which the compromise had left untouched? They would, therefore, on their side, pay as little heed to its concessions. They would insist everywhere that the Gentiles must be circum- cased and keep the whole law. But how were they, to gain a hearing among St. Paul's own I A,w,"\"°1 'ri,»um"0r"nrlnnvnnrtafliiPrprllt disciples They must endeavour to discredit his person and undermine his apostolic authority The Second 1 epistle to the Corinthians and that to the Galatians exhibit fully their modus open an It but land they alleged was no apostle at all He had never been the Lord except in some vision which he was fond of talking about So far indeed was he from being an apostle that he got his mission only from the subordinate church at Antioch Let him show letters testimonial it he had any like those they could themselves produce from the mother church of Jerusalem and James the Lord s own brothel What was the worth of all Pauls arrogant boasting in the face of such proved defects as these ' Again he was teaching heresy He told men that they need not keep the law But who was it who had said that i of one jot or tittle should by any me ma pass away from the law till all were fulfilled Naj his own practice condemned him Who had circumcised Timothy who had become as a Jew to Jews that he might win Jews He was a slippery and deceitful man and as contemptible in speech and presence rib he was heretical and untruthful in teaching Nay worse did they not observe how readily he disposed of the aims which he professed to father for the poor saints at Jerusalem It was all very well for him to work ostentatiously for his own bread but let them inquire what became of the money which he professed to forward by Iitus to Jerusalem Were they going, to he the bond slaves of such a charlatan as this Were they going to allow themselves to be appointed by him from the holy severity of the glorious church at Jerusalem ' Let them turn while yet there was time repudiate this sham apostle a authority and rest once more in the unity of Zion How vile a tissue of false insinuations this was we know full well But we can never know the anguish of heart with which the a] native first be used. after his flight from 1 plies us. that such things as these had been believed of him by his own children in the faith The mischief was bad enough at Corinth But in Gillana everything for the moment seemed to be lost Nothing had been a wiser than to play upon the fickleness and credulity of these ignorant Gauls The new still which the Ju Kuvera brought pleased them as a new toy pleases a child and it promised them beside a new religion of forms far more easy to observe than the severe and lofty principles of spiritual Christianity What was the apostle to do' He was in Mace come when all this disastrous intelligence i poured in upon him in his indignation then and anguish he sat down and wrote first the 2nd Epistle to the Corinthians, then that to the Galatians, and then at no great distance of time, in a quieter tone, that systematic expansion of the Epistle to the Galatians which he sent to Home, by, the church won some of her greatest tre issues out of the envenomed hate of these despicable Christian Pharisees St Paul at once throws all compromise to the winds He will keep no terms with such men They have accused him of vaccinating statements. He will put it out of their power, at any rate, to make that statement again His words shall be such as no human being can mistake Indeed the crisis was of such a kind as to make the very plainest speech a simple necessity. The issue raised was one of life or death, of gospel or no gospel, of freedom or bondage, of salvation or destruction Not only those poor wavering Gauls, but the whole churches, the whole human race was interested in the result. It seemed as though the cause of humanity had been committed by the fiat of Providence to the Apostle's single arm, and by God's help he would not be wanting Drawing then the sword, and throwing away the scabbard, he rushes to the front of battle, determined that he will not spare ' I marvel," he cries to the foolish Gauls, that you are so soon moved away from him that called you to another gospel " Uh, stupid Galatians," Biavesor your senses, who can believe nothing you do not see, did not paint up Jesus crucified before your eyes, in lineaments be large, in colours be vivid, that you could make no mistake' Who, then, both bewitched you with his evil eye' How is it that you are turning from the spirit to the flesh, from freedom to bondage, from Sarah to Hagar' How, having once known God, and ye turning again to the beggarly elements to which you desire to become bond slaves' Law and circumcision, weeks and months and years, lasts, sacrifices, festivals, and Sabbaths tell you they are all nought.

Will you tell me that surely) you are no worse for circumcision, even if you be no better I deny) it I will not suffer you to be circumcised " If you be circumcised, you are debtors to do the whole law' "If you are circumcised, Christ shall profit you nothing " Is that clear enough for you ' Or do you wish me to be still more ex- plicit' Well, then, I tell you that your fine, new gospel is no gospel at all.
