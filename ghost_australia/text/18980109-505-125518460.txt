CITY 'AND COUNTRY GIRLS. Deae ' Viviekne/'— ' Gold Dust ' has, ib appears, brought the proverbial '.hornets'' nest' abont his ears by publishing his wife's measurements. Although his taste in so doing, might have been questionable, he. after ail, only showed a pride and fond ness^ for his wife, for which all honor to him, whiio his.letter -va.s undoubtedly more respectful and manly than that of ' A Working Young Man,' published in the Sttnday Times December 26. Ho refers to girls stricken with illness, and therefore deserving of sympathy and pity only, as ' dying churchyard ghosts,' and tq'the riot untnaidenly occupation of tending to useful domestic animals as ' cow- walloping' and 'pig-driving.' , The coarseness of 'A Working Young Man's' letter would give one the idea that in the controversy ' Cifcy v. Couutry Girls ' the cause of the former is languishing when sueli champions as he are in evidence — not that I believe for a moment that any city girl above the larrikiness type would feel otherwise than disgusted when having perused Jii3 letter. In both city and country there are girls who uphold the noblest} traits of a woman's character, arid in each sphere girls who do the opposite ; but there is- no. disgrace to any woman who strives to cafry 6)it the duties allotted by the every-day circumstances that sur round her in a womanly and wifely manner. — I am, &c;, Habd Case.,' Mouaro, January 3.
