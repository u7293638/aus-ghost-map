A Malign Influence. As crystalliuely foreshadowed in oar lust, tbe labour man, through the other interest being split by too many candidates, has scooped tho three hundred — beg pardon, one hundred aud fifty. Had the reduced attraction been presented in time, them would have been a. different tale, to tell, as Curtis— always sup posing he was not a tool of the labour party, but simply too infatuated with the contem plated reward to surrender bis ghost of a chance for anybody or any principle — would probably have retired in disgnst, and the stuffing would be knocked closn out of the enthusiasm of the Qlasseyite party. As it was, all four went to the poll, the latter wen by 98 votes after just about twice that number had been idly thrown away upon the pigheaded candidates who professed to uphold the policy of the Conservatives. Mr. Curtis now declares that he was misled, and it is our opinion he was encouraged in his candidature by |large numbers of Glnsseyites in order to split the Government vote. Is it otherwise possible a man of ordinary sense could have so mistaken his chances of success, or that a business man would run tho risk of enraging the better classes of the town by causing them to be disfranchised ? The affair was worked up very cleverly but the result will not bo very permanent. Bundaberg will not be caught again by such a scaly dodge, and the general election is not far distant. Meanwhile it is no small consolation to reflect that tho successful candidate will only enjoy half tho anticipated screw even for that brief period.
