lPjoeti\\\ BERTIE. BY EJDIA ALICE BBOWNE. Drop the blind, and draw the curtain Close about the lattice sill; How the Norther wails and clamors, And the night is black and shrill! . There are ghosts abroad-the spectres Of the happy long ago : Wraiths that rise to haunt me ever f ? When the dreary north winds blow, As in winters long ago. Hark ! was that the wild rain falling In the dark, deserted street ? Of the fitful pit-a-patter Of a baby's restless feet ? Was that cry a gusty murmur Of the wind without the door ? Or a childish voice that calls me' 1 From the distance evermore When the rain is at the door ? Ffom the hollow darkness reaching, Tender amis my neck entwine, Baby ringlets brush my worn check, Baby lips are pressed to mine! Nay, 'tis but a haunting memory ' Cheats my hungry heart's despair! Yonderstands his shrouded cradle, And his little empty chair' . Mocks my hungry heart's despair! ' ' Yet he cometh to me ever ' When the night and darkness fall; . When the wild winds shrill and clamor, And the rain is over all! While I count my hoarded treasures Precious trifles deaf to me !-. Sunny curl, or half-worn gannent! Bich with cunning broidery- , All of him that's left to me! - Battered toys and baby's picture, With " Our darling" scrawled beneath. And his rosy coral, dotted s. With the prints of little teeth. Oh, the dainty, scarlet stocking! Oh, the tiny silken shoe- . Worn threadbare, where I soT often ,, / , Kissed the pink toes .peeping, thro'-. Baby's first, enchanting shoe 1 ; So with loving hands I take them ' From their secret hiding-place: Turn them o'er with lingering touches- ' Kiss the chubby pictured face;' 1; 1 ! 1 " While the salt tears, slow arid bitter, Wrung from motherhood's despair. Fall upon his shrouded cradle1 And hiB little empty chair Mocks my hungry heart's despair!
