NEW SOUTH WALES. SCOTT TUB Uusiuaaosa -Our readers will remember that the remains of a man, with. his skull fractured, were found In the bush in the Braidwood district, some weeks since, and that it was supposed they were the remains of the bush ranger known as Bill Scott, who formed part of Clarke's gang. The remain, have since been Identified on oath as those of Scott; and we may add, that as the Clarkes and he were found to be quarrelling on the last occasion they were seen together, not very far from where the body was found, it is not difle:ult to conjecture how he came by his death. Oua 1EXT Goveanso.-It is mentioned in a late private letter that it is not improbable the successor of Sir John Young will be the Marquis of Normanby, who is the only son of the late Marquis of that name, and was born in 1819.

WIT AND HustouR.- When Curran was asked by a brother lawyer, "Do you see anything ridiculoes in this wig I ' and he replied ", Nothing but the head I " that was wit. And when Scott describes the inmates o1 C!eikum Inn, in "St. Romau's Well," who thought they: had seen the ghost of a murdered man, we get- ha mour, the root of which lies far deeper in human nature. He says the two maidens took refuge in their bedroom, whilst the humpbacked postilion fled like wind into the stable, and with professional instinct began in his terror to saddle a horse. This was his most natural refuge from the super natural; a touch of humour at which we smile eravely, if at all. When Hood describes a fool whosa height of folly constitutes his own monu ment, he calls him A column of fop, A lighthouse without any light a-top. This is wit. But when Chaucer describes the fox as desirons of capturing the cock, and trying to fatter him into singing by telling him how his respected father used to sing, and put his heart so much into the song, that Ire was obliged to shut his eyes, and .by this mesas gets door ch mticleer to Imilate his father and sirg ind shut his eyes [also, where upuu the fox pounces upon him and bears him off -that is humour t a sort of short-eyed hunour that is quite irresistible. Again we have wit when Jerrold defines dogmatism as "puppyism come to matur'y." But we get at humour when Panurge, in his mortal fear of shipwreck, cries, " Woold to heaven I were safe on dry land with (we presume to make quite sure of his footing) somebody kicking mel"-Quarterly Review (neow number).
