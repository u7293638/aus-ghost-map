ANSELM OF CANTERBURY (ST. ANSELM). B. Dit. W. Stacey Chapman. To say that Anselm of Canterbury was born at Aosta, in northern Italy, in the year 10-3, is to say that he came into the world at one of the most important periods of medieval history 1 he y ears of his birth was that in which a boy of only twelve years of age was made Vicar of Christ, under the title of Pope Benedict the Ninth He was yet a child when the world important conflict between the Imperial power and the Papal power was either dead preparing or being daily carried on and usually with prospect of most questionable issues It was the time in which three rival points divided the revenues and authority of the Church and fulminated anathemas against each other the whole of Europe was in a highly disturbed and some what anarchical condition its rulers and peoples finding apology for themselves in the behaviour of their nests 'The cry for church reform was, at least, as general then as afterwards, but had a different meaning We must also remember Anselm stage as the one which witnessed that extraordinary phenomenon, the irruption of the Norman into European politics and history It was an age crowded with great men and with great events It saw the conversion of the Norsemen from piracy and paganism to civilise ation and Christianity It saw the English Conquest the more formal commencement of the scholastic philosophy, the war of ecclesiastical investitures and the splendid dreams of Hildebrand all but realised in a European theocracy, with himself for chief It listened to Bernard of Cluny with us marked results as to Peter the Hermit It saw Godfrey de Bouillon at Jerusalem, as well as Gretoty the ben 9th at Home A more careful sketch of the time would be sufficiently interesting were it in place, but that being out of question I offer this brief note simply to provide for our being in intelli cent relation with the world into which the subject of this paper was bom M c shall not do injustice to Anselm's p treats in supposing them to have belonged to the lower rank of the aristocratic classes. His father, Gundulf was one of those men, not so rarely to be met with in our own n day, whounite seventy of disposition and narrow ness of thought with strong domestic affections and the sort of extravagance that is taken for generosity It is mother, Lrmen bergo, was pious and gentle in an eminent degree, and early indoctrinated her son with thoughts of God and holiness and heaven the boy himself was deeply and simply religious and very impressionable withal He had been told that God was in heaven, and was not heaven right before him and above him there resting on the tops of those grand and ever glorious mountains round his home No doubt it was then, of course, the way to get to God would be to climb one of the mountains' Nothing could be clearer be at least, thought the boy, and thought it often And, by and by the waiting thought came again and with not a little vividness m dream And as he dreamed it was impressed upon him that he must try and ascend one of those mountain pinks, and hasten to the court of the Great Kuy still dreaming he set out at once As he journeyed across the plain that lay stretched between his home and the mountains foot he saw a number of women employed by the King to reap and harvest his crops idling over their task with wasteful and culpable remissness The boy immediately approached them He grieved aloud over their idleness, and his rebukes being unsuitably received, he took his departure with the assurance that he would unfailingly report them to the King He. reached and climbed the mountain, crossed its summit, and found himself in the palace he had sought 'There sat the King the Lord of Heaven, in company with the chief officer of his household alone, for the rest were gone out reaping the King looks kindly on the boy and calls him He | may sita the Kings feet Who is he, and from what place, and on what errands And the King oaks all this and more with such a marvellously winning and benignant grace that the boy answers frankly and without fear. But he was hungry, perhaps Indeed I so, and in a moment the chief officer of the household has disappeared, and returns with the whitest and most delicious looking bread that ever could be seen Anselm eats and is refreshed, and while he is still sitting at the feet of the King the delightful vision fades Not so the impression on the mind of the bo), for when the morning came, and the house I was astir, he told freely) and with evident conviction that he had spent the night in heaven and been refreshed with the bread of God it will not surprise us that a childhood which was marked by so exquisite and power ful a sense of the spiritual as is shown by this dream should have been followed by a youth to which the professed and complete devotional monastery appeared by far the worthiest object of life But Anselm s father was unwilling Indeed, Gundulf had other views Then the youth fell ill as he had very earnestly prayed he might. His father remained immovable Gradually recovering, and not without suggestion of such things from others he began to think that a secular life, with nobility and we health and feudal power in his possession, might be very endurable after all His studies came to be pursued with less and less devotion according) he practised himself in the sports and exercises suitable to his age and condition, and in the free engagement and conscious energies of his new found life, he came upon the discovery that his fathers boy city was no check on him, and that it was only an intense and reverent affection for his mother that kept him under desirable re- street But she died, and he found her self, as he afterwards tells, forthwith like an anchor less ship, abandoned to the winds and waves, drifting manifests) towards wreck But he came to himself. He was apprehended of God He resolutely refused He endeavoured by every means of assiduous patience and attention to soften his fathers hardness, to conciliate his affection and regard The more he tried the less he succeeded, for Gun dull was unforgiving unappreciative, in variably morose Anel Anselm, now arrived at manhood, could endure no longer He perceived that if he remained at home his only resource would be in thorough worldliness and selfishness I? rom these he shrank as from infamy , so, gathering to gether a few necessaries for the journey, he set out for Burgundy across Mont Cenis The labour and fatigue were overmuch He grew faint and tried to revive himself by eating snow-the only thing he had the chance to cat A single companion was with him, half servant half chaplain What could be done' Might there chance to be anything in one of the saddle bags of the ass that carried their luggage' They had put no food there, to be sure, but the clerk began t empty ing them simply m despair, and all in one of them was a piece of the most beautiful white bread that could be imagined (pattern may dissimilar) and Anselm ate and was saved the dream of his childhood was fulfilled and his flight for the safety of his soul appeared to be sealed with the approbation of Hear an He traversed Burgundy, passed three more years in various parts of France, entered iSormanb) and made his way to the late) founded monastery of Bec During all this time he had persevered in a strenuous dev o tion to the studies which had at once been resumed on leaving Aosta and after another long period of the most devout and careful deliberation upon all that would be involved in his profession, he became a monk in the 27th year of his age At Bec Anselm had the privilege of listen- ing to Lauf nine, afterwards his predecessor in the see of Canterbury The story of Lan Franc s connection with this monastery is one which unites the soberness of history with the charms of romance I shall not trust myself to digress into its narration, but will only say that when Anselm became his disciple Lanfranc s learning and eloquence, united as they were with brilliance and force of m tellect general!), and with great prudence had extended his fame in every direction and find drawn to these pious but active solitudes whole crowds of young men who listened and obeyed with enthusiasm and delight There were students from almost every country in Europe, and of every condition of life and decree of ability, that the monastery was in effect perhaps the most desirable and distinguished or the universities of the time, though it had not the name 4 To both the religious and the intellectual discipline there prescribed for him Anselm addressed himself with unfaltering vigour and zeal and when a few years later had Been Lanfranc removed to Caen he was, with great cordiality and unanimity, chosen prior in his room Already had his fasting, and austerities been carried to a degree that deprive 1 him of all pleasure at table-had almost deprived him even of taste-and now that he had become prior the rigour of his self discipline was in no wise relaxed According to 1 miner he was a faultless model of the whole circle of the monastic virtues, the most winning suavity and a ceaseless industry included the fame of his holiness and learning, and yet more of his knowledge of the scriptures and of the divine life, spread in ever) direction.

He found Canterbury in utter woe and desolation and a Kin- who berne, destitute of all v artist himself was unable to credit anyone else with any other motives than those of ambition and I self seeking interest and cunning Meanwhile Rufus had been spoken to more than once on the truly miserable condition of the church and kind, "The only linlyersltlM then founded as far as I know were Hole of a Uvford Paris Lyons Cordova and perhaps I de la but most of them had reached I In luscious a very rutlimciitaiygrowth The report tion of the University of Paris did not take place till I near half a century later from generally, and especially on his conduct with regard to Canterbury He swore by the holy Face of Lucca that none but himself should be archbishop, and as soon as he had done so became seriously ill He begun to think it might be a very dangerous e experiment to die with such enormities of unrepented guilt upon his soul, and his spiritual admirers w ere not slow to second his opinion Bishops abbots nobles, all hastened to the palace at Gloucester where the King lay ill, an 1 awaited his immediate death He was strongly urged to take thought for his will vation, to open his dungeons to tree his captives, to do justice and show mercy, and, above all, to restore its rights and liberties to the church which he had as far as possible degraded and enslaved Anselm being in England, and of pre eminent reputation in respect of all spiritual functions was sent for to receive the Kings confession, and received both his confession and the promise of an amended life should God see fit to spare him William Rufus had for once been frightened, not more by his clergy than by his conscience, into real earnestness He sent a messenger to the church nearest to the palace to swear in his own name and with the most solemn formalities the reform and repentance he had vowed A proclama- tion signed with the King's seal was immediately published releasing the captives absolving his real or pretended debtors pro raising good laws and the execution of justice Great was the joy Men every where gave thanks to Almighty God for having heard their prayers and changed Williams heart A little while since they had desired nothing so much as deliverance from his detested yoke but they now prayed afresh for the continued life of so good and great a Kingsvale are tant tests) so cheap is loyalty when a king is the bidder, and so short bred is resentment when it is a nation that has suffered Anselm was quickly nominated to the vacant archbishopric by the repentant King, but he answered with a respectful though decided refusal, a refusal not more decided than sincere The church was scarcely less grieved at the new complexion thus given to its perplexities than William was surprised Every thing that could be thought of was said and done without avail, to change Anselm s mind His election was ultimately effected only through a tumult Nobles clergy, people crowded round him one day, while the Court was still at Gloucester, and had what proved to be a very painful interview they entreated him to yield, and he would not He was taken aside for more private and urgent remonstrance 1 very Rufus condescended to become a petitioner, and, under standing neither what he feared nor what he desired he entreated Anselm to save him from hell by y fielding to his wish Ilemon strance grew into reproach, and there was a long time of excuses and reasons, tears and protests on the one side, and of demands and pray era and cries on the other, till at length Anselm was carried by mum force, and more dead than alive into the neighbouring church, and, amid bouts. and by inns and prayers was made Archbishop of Canterbury, Primate of England Scotland Ireland and the islands off their coasts His election took place in April 1943, and his consecration in the following December The few months interval had amply sufficed for Rufus to show once more the worst sides of his character, but Anselm nevertheless proceeded to pay him a Christmas visit in honour of the new and important relations and engagements with each other into which they had entered three days passed very agreeably and then there took place a transaction of which it is not very easy to gather a clear and sufficient account. I from a careful consideration of the several narratives everyone of them come here alone I have concluded that the following is either the simple truth of the matter or the nearest approach to it which obtain able information enables us to make Anselm was given to understand that he did not please Rufus and that it was desirable he should make some effort to conciliate the King's more lasting and friendly regard now should he do it' Well, the Knit was busy with the expedition against Nor mandy-let Anselm give turn home money Anselm cast about accordingly and not together, apparently with difficulty, five hundred pounds He offered this sum, and his offer was refused with disdain He was informed that a thousand pounds was the very smallest sum that bore any proportion to the favours and preferments he had received It did not need a spirit and conscience as sensitive as Anselm s to perceive that this answer placed the whole affair in a different light. To say nothing of the large ness of the sum, it was clear that what was expected was a pecuniary acknowledgement in return for being made archbishop He revolted at once The hi each between him self and the King quickly became irreparable and when William was ready some time afterwards to accept the five hundred he had previously refused Anselm could only say it was out of his power to repeat to the King his already rejected offer, for that a large part of the money had been spent upon the poor Rufus had disliked and feared him previously From this time he simply hated Anselm and never changed It was impossible that a monarch so brutal should under stand a churchman so saintly By the time that Henry I (Henry Beau clere) ascended the throne Anselm himself had changed the greater part of the interval he had spent in exile much of it at Rome He was less an J englishman than ever, and no wonder His dominant idea was the idea of the church and the church as understood at Home Hence not a few of the embarrassments he encountered after Henry s accession Leaving these and all things belonging to them entirely on one side, ' Anselm was always a student wasalwnysin pursuit of saintliness of life and was a mere physician by nature not less than by tram me When after some years, his reconciliation with Henry Beauclerc had taken place Anselm returned to 1 island in abundant honour He presided our a very important council in London diminished the almost in numerable disorders of his see, sank by degrees into an extreme w darkness not accom- Earned with pain and on the fourth day eton Easter in 1100 in the seventy sixth year of his age, he passed away as the morning broke His various tractates were undoubtedly the most influential contributions towards a scientific theology that had been made since the days of Augustine, though they were very far from possessing those claims to originality which modern vv liners have frequently assured It may he granted without hesitation that the ages intervening between Augustine und Anselm were many of them dark, out their darkness was occasionally illumined by stars of no inconsiderable brilliance, and it is no disparagement of Anselm to say that the conspicuous and welcome light he poured forth was not all self evolved And Anselm believed in this light of his It was altogether too early a period in the development of thought for him to suspect the possibility of the unproductiveness of metaphysical research Anselm s faith in his subject never varied, was never troubled by a doubt It need not be added, perhaps that it follows as a matter of course that he was great in deduction, or that his deductions were sometimes very curious That very often there was absolutely no progress in them but only rotation on a pivot-the conclusion being not even a manifestation of what was implied in the premisses but only a verbal alteration in the proposition that should have been proved would seem never to have disturbed the s satisfaction he derived from his pursuit Metaphysics was his ruling passion all through life, strong even in death He completed his last work a treatise on The Harmony of Prescience for h Piedestination, only as his last illness became hopeless On the Palm Sunday preceding his death he was too ill to be moved from his bed, and one said to him 1 other, my lord as far as one can see you will he leaving this world in time to celebrate Easter with the Divine Master Anselm answered, If that be His will I shall chi erfully obey but if He would choose to leave me among you

dear and saintly Archbishop to be excited to ' or nobody has resolved that question even yet neither the physicists nor the physiologists nor the metaphysicians The work by which Anselm is best known in our day and which indeed is the work by which his fame as a theologian was first established is his treatise on the Incur nation entitled Cis Dem Homo He wrote it he tells us at the request of many
