GKANNY'S GHOST. | It was in Milltown, this haunted houso of which 1 write, and, as is usual in such oasts, the occupauts wero ill at ease. It was annoying, to say the least, to hear that ghostly rooking, rocking to and fro in midnight hours, when the slightest sound ntsumcd startling proportions. Squire Elkins had bought tho place at a bargain— or to it seemed ; but if he bad known it was haunted he would not havo taken it at any pries. Not that ho was nervous or belioved in ghosts; but it was 'deucodly uncomfort able,' ho said, to bo roused from slumbfr half, a dozen tim'es in a night with the information that somebody was rocking tho big armchair. 44 Well, let 'em rock,' he growled. ' 1 don't want to,' 14 Yes ; but Harvey, what is it P ' 41 1 don't know and dou't caro. Go to sleep, Sarah,' And Sarah tried — perhaps she succeeded ; but wheu that mysterious rocking began again the scene wis repeated, until in desperation tho squire would go to the large apartment which answered for kitchen and dining-room. It was very comfortable thero. A big rocking-chair occupied the cozy coiner between the hearth and the pantry door. Upon a small stand wero tho evening papers and a lamp. Just opposite was Sarah's low chair, iu which sbe whs wout to rock and knit. But why tbe rockiug should continue after the occupants of the chairs wore in bed was a matter that puzzled and alarmed her. Only lately had she heard tho sound, but she was suro her ears did not deceive ber. Tho squire did uot tell ber upon his return from the investigating tours wbich she forced him to make that tho big chair was swaying back and forth as if recently vacated. 44 Somo natoral cause for it ; but I'll be confounded if I soe just what.' be muttered, then unblusbingJy declared to his wifo that not a thing was stirring, not even a mouse. ' ' When she began to talk of gbosts he ridi culed tbe idea, yet wondered the whilo why the placo was sold so cheaply. To be suro tbe house was somewhat out of repair but paint and plaster would soou remedy that ; the laud was good and well located ; if thero should be sach a thing as a house being haunted, that would account. 44 But, pshaw ! there aro uo ghosts,' he mentnlly exclaimed; and be dis knUscd the matter from his mind and slept the sleep of tbe just. Not so poor Sarah. When the idea had once possessed her mind she could not got rid of it. Sbe began to mnke cautious inquiries of tbe neighbours concerning the former owner und hts family. She learned that Mr. Harris had been a widower with several childreu. A servant girl aud his helpless old mother completed the family. ' When she died he sold out and moved away. The bouse doesn't look tbe samu with out tbe old lady She always sat in that corner aud rocked. I can just shut my eyes and sco her now.' Thus the voluble neighbour chatted on, uu mindful of the horrible certainty that took pos stssiou of Mrs. Elkins. 44 1 just know it, Harvey. 44 The house is actually haunted,' she said to her husband that night, in a terrified whisper. 44 It's old Granny Harris's ghost rocking in yoar big chair. What ever shall we do ?' 14 Do nothing,' snapped tbe Sqnire, to whom the subject bad become an exasneratinir onp. 44 The old woman is welcome to rock all night, just so she don't dispute my claim to tbe cbuir before bedtime.' ' Oh, Harvey, bow can you talk so ? I would not sit in that chair for the world.' 44 The old woman, Harvey ! She's rocking ! I can't stand it.' 44 Confound the old woman— and you, too I I ever heard of a more peaceable ghost. What would yoa do with one that wandered around in a winding sheet, with fiery eyes and sulphurous breath ? ' Poor Sarah cowered beneath the bedclothes while her husband resumed his snoring — a sound much more formidable than the mysterious rocking. Squire Elkins was not a cruel man, but be knew little about aerves, and had not the least sympathy for his timid wife. Nothing but bodily danger could alarm bim. * .' Harvey, can't I send for Cynthia P I'm really ill,' !-aid Sarah one morning after a night of almost incessant rocking. *' Why, of course, if you want to ; but not a word about ghosts to her.' Cynthia was ber maiden sister, who lived with their brother John, in Newton. She came at once. 44 Well, Sarah, yon do look bad, for a fact,' was the sympathetic spinster's greeting. 44 But I'll cbirk you up a bit. I brought some sassafras and camomile and lady's slipper with me.' The day passed nleasantly enough, and at nine o'clock all was as quiet as usual. Cynthia slept just across the ball from ber brother and bis wife. There was only a partition between the bedrooms and the kitchen, though both doors opened into the hall. 'Sarab,' called Cynthia, an hour later, 4 'are you ill ? ' 44 No,' was tbe mufHed response from tbe covert of the bedclothes. 44 Is Harvey ?' ' No,' again. 44 What's ho hitting up for P* 44 It ain't him, Cynthia.' 14 Well, who is it ?' 44 1 don't know.' 44 Don't know ? Well, I'm going to know I' The bedroom door opened and an energetic step was beard in tbe hall. 44 Don't don't, Cynthia ! Listen to me !'* came in terrified accents from the opposite room. , Cynthia opened the door ss Sarah whispered faintly— 44 It's— it's a ghost, Cynthia; but don't let Harvey know 1 told.' V*Harvey, Harvey !' cried Cynthia, 14 Get up and see who's in th*t rocking-chair.' 44 Lord preserve us ! Wbat'H I do with two of 'em ?' groaned the poor squire, as Cynthia retreated to bed aud stuffed the clothes i-i her cars to shut out the mysterious rocking that catne and ceased, and came aud ceased, aud came again, all night long. In tbe morning sho beard the story, and understood that no herb, however potent, would ' chirk up ' her sister-in law. Another night, a repetition of tbo first, Cynthia returnod to John's house, taking Sarah with her. Squire Elkins felt greatly relieved at first ; but wbeu a wtek had passed he began to long for company, and hailed with pleasuro tbe night's sojourn of a passing p- ddler. To his annoyance tbe transient guest iuquired in tbe morning the meaning of the rocking he had heard. Tbe squire explained and the news tliat the Harris houfo was haunted flew ou willing wings. Then the real trouble began. He was 1 deluged with inquiries and confronted by the { most senseless und bloodcurdling tales imagin able. He denied aud exaggerated by turns, and tbo ball kept rolling. The bouse was I avoided as if a pestilence lurked there ; team- 1 sters whipped up their horses and hurried by. Some even viewed tbe Squire askance, until in his righteous indiguation bo grew so fierce that it was said he was going crazy, and that (in addition to the ghost) was why his wife had left him.
