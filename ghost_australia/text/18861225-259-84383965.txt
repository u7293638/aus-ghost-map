All English Gliost Story. ' Lady Hoby is again said to be haunting Bisham Abbey, and is caus ing no little sensation. She was the wife of the English ambassador to the Oourt of France in 1566. The abbey is the most historic religious liouse in Berkshire, and in One of the apartments is a peculiar painting representing the lady with a very white face and hands, dressed in the coif, weeds, and wimple then allowed to a baronet's lady. In this- identi cal dress, it is most strongly averred, she has frequently been seen in one of the bedrooms of the Abbey, with a self-supporting basin moving before her, in which elie is perpetually try ing to wash her hands, but the most remarkable part of the story is thai the so-called apparition always ap pears in the negative, viz., the'black part white, and tlie white part black. The story, as now told by the do mestics and villagers, is that she beat her sonWilliam to death becauge he could not write without making blots, and a-singular part of the story is that a short time ago, in altering the shutters of the dining-room, a great number of children's copy books of the time of Queen Elizabeth were discovered pushed between the joists of the floor, some of which answered exactly to the tale as if the child could not write a line with out making a blot. Neither the'do mestics at the Abbey nor the adja cent villagers will hear one word against the narrative. -London letter id the Philadelphia Tchgfaph.
