WHO WOULD BE AN EDITOR? TRYING TO PLEASE EVERYBODY. HINT TO EDITORS. One reader cries, your strain's too grave, Too much morality you have, Too much about religion; Give me some witch and wizard tales Of slip-shod ghosts with fins and scales, And feathered like a pigeon. The man of dull scholastic lore Would like to see a little more Of first-rate scraps of Latin; The grocer fain would learn the price Of tea and sugar, fruit and rice; The draper, silk and satin. Another cries, I want more fun, A witty anecdote or pun, A rebus or a riddle: Some wish for all the Council news, And some, perhaps, of wiser views, Would rather have a fiddle. The critic, too, of classic skill, Must dip in gall his gander quill, And scrawl against the paper; Of all the literary fools, Bred in our colleges and schools, He cuts the greatest caper. Another cries, I want to see A jumble-up variety-- Variety of matter; A miscellaneous hodge-podge print, Composed (I only give the hint) Of multifarious chatter. I want some marriage news, says Miss-- It constitutes my highest bliss To hear of weddings plenty; For in a time of general rain None suffer from a drought, 'tis plain-- At least not one in twenty. No, no, cries one, we've had enough Of such confounded love-sick stuff, To craze , the fair creation; Give us some late New Zealand news, Of Johnny Heki and his crews; Or Queen Pomare's nation. I want to hear of deaths, says one-- Of people totally undone By losses, fire, or fever; Another answers, full as wise, I'd rather have the fall or rise Of possum skins or beaver. Some signify a secret wish For now and then a favourite dish Of politics to suit them; But here we rest at perfect ease, For should they swear the moon was cheese, We never should confute them. Or grave or humourous, wild or tame, Lofty or low--'tis all the same, Too haughty or too humble; So brother editors, pursue The path that seems the best to you, And let the grumblers grumble.
