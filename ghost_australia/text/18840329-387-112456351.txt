jlclcci fjaetrj). YE YEARS 'Tin but the ghost of a feeling, 'Tiij but the ghost of a sinila ; Goui?. is the true light revealing, : This but a shadow tho while. Tluw.shall each ro$e4iu tod vision Fade 'tis the leaves iu the Fall, , Loaviug it may be derision Casting a gleam o'er tho pall. Years glide along without number, Swift as a wiutl-driven wave, Hiding away in its slumber Much we would struggle to save. . Taking tho bloom from the roses, Taking the down from the peach ; Leaving tho thorn from tho posies, Leaving the ashes of each. Bringing the end of our dreaming, Hounding the sphere of pur life, Tinting with shades of new meaning, Harshness ot pain or of strife. Waking our souls from dolus ion. Chasing tho shadows that throng ; Piercing the veil of illusion, Righting full many a wrong. Scattering the falso that would oluster Only when fortune is fair; Shrining with ever more lustre Love that all danger would dare. Testing the true from the faithless. Tearing the mask from deceit; Leaving but few that are scathless, Few—but how preciously sweot I Thanks then, each year that unveileth Tenderness, courage, and truth ; And for the rest—what availeth ? Tako them, ye years, with our youth !
