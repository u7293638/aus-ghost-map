Indeed ln-j Lovd shiw has for a length of timo occupied the posi tion of President of the Board of Agriculture. He 1ms also been President of the Sii.:sex County Cricket Club, tho patrous ol which are tne Duke of Norfolk, the Dulro of Richmond and Gordon, tho Duko of Devonshire, the Duke of Cleveland, :v:d Karl of Chichester, while the list o( vLeo-yrcJideutsnud members of committee include a numtor of influcntu;l names, besides t'uoae of some sterling cricketers. 1I!U0 was wlion Sussex possessed a team capable or content. ing, unaided, against all tho l.»est t-ilcnt of Eu;.jla. l 'combined. Tho mnies of the Lillywhitej arc insepar able frori th<* history of Sussex Connty cricket, but hut season, for the first time, tho comity record Clnea not contain one occurrence of tbs tiino-honored nnnie. Tho Su«oOX team gradually became weikoned, until some six or se7sn ywvrs tv<o it was at itn lowest oob.

At Shetliehl Pwic his Lordship had a rorr pretty ground formed. Tho turf is capiUtl, and 'tho burroundiii^s in orery way plea-nut, and although the Au-itraliiins may have a ditUcult tits< uefore thoiu in !tho field, their risit to Sheilield Park is likely to be iu overy way oajoyablo.
