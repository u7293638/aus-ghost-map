THE MAYOR v. THE EDITOR. Sra,-With much pleasure and great interest I read your first leader on " Distraint for Rates." Every ri^ht-thinking person will a^reo with your views and applaud your action. What dq we ex pect from the press but fearless exposure of wrong ? You, Sir, attacked no person, but a system. If his Worship chooses to put up his bristles, let him. . It is enough for present purposes to know that a great danger has i.oen pointed out, and the matter will be sitted. Anyone attending the two sales must have been struck forcibly with the difference of prices realised through publicity. No one can aori .ously think you were prompted by any such motives as were insinuated by the Mayor. Your character as a iournalist nlaces vou far anil uwuv from the ghost of a suspicion iu that direction. ?-Yours, &o.;, FNKE SPEBCH.
