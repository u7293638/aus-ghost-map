SUNDAY SKETCHES. BY A STRANGER. I . A SERMON IN A WOOLSHED. Sermons are preached in woolsheds still, though churches and chapels, and meeting houses, and Salvation Army barracks are found in almost every township of the bush When spring rains the brown points to the oak and the pink tops to the gums on our southern areas, and the floods to the Murray Hats, and the flowers to the Murrumbidgee meadows, some 20 000 men go out from the settlements and must r in the wilderness, and fill the woolsheds for the performance of the great work of the pastoral year And then, us in proper, some few ministers of religion go out also, and arrange for a Sunday service, and the ' Smoke, oh ' bell hangs out on un familiar ni_8su_,e, and the men gather in clean shirts and trousers, and listen gone fully with respect. Priests of nil orders travel round in this way, and in the great sheds of the Murrumbidgee a bishop in lawn sleeves not infrequently mounts a pulpit of wool bales Imagine, if you have never seen, a, broad Australian plain in the light of a fair spring afternoon The surface is clothed as with an underskirt of vivid green, above which is a gold and silver brocade of daisy blooms, daisies yellow and white growing in millions, with occasional patches and BY Pipes of violet and purple and pink from the wild pea, which by and by will clothe square miles of the plain with its own rich tints Eastward is a sandhill and pine ridge, all the lower sa its boughs hung with wreaths and festoons of clematis, and the truss covered with the flowers of the delicate and fragrant wild alpine Westward a timber belt, a blurred and indistinct line of black foliage, separated by ft blue mirage from the earth 'The wool shed IS central on the plain A half-dozen huts are Been slightly removed from the shed A dozen bullocks are I; am full and comfortable on the edge of the pines, and a flock of sheep are moving in the distance. The air is very still, the sunshine delightfully warm All surrounding influences and Sentiments seem of rest and peace and devotion It is a proper time for worship, and within the woolshed church the act of worship pro cells 'The interior is not ill suited for a church there is a large open space about the wool tables and press for pulpit and reading desk, chancel and choir And on the day previous, when work had ended, a company of the men had gone into the pine ridge with the treat bullock dray, and brought home a loud of fragrant boughs, long branches of pines, and drooping tendrils of myall, garlands of clematis and trophies of the golden wattle All these had been spread and (garlanded round about, and brightened with touches of colour by graceful hands from the home station A little organ had been brought up also, and a halt dozen voices, strong or sweet, were ready to lead the way in the psalms or hymns Down on the shearing board proper-smooth, polished, and well swept-wool bales had been rolled and upon them sat the main congregation- a hundred and fifty men, and about a score of women A singularly mixed assemblage borne three or four old grey heads, the last relics of an expiring older, who seemed troubled with memories as they watched the ceremony, at least a hundred men on the south side of middle age (the great majority of the shearers are young men now who are in the habit of attending church occasionally in their own home villages, twenty of the ordinary station hands cleanly and well dressed and a dozen or Sydney or Melbourne larrikins, who rolled up because the rest did, but would lend nothing to the service beyond an occasional beer, and take nothing from it whatever, lacking altogether that receptive capacity which is requisite to the taking of good impressions of any sort. All the women of the station it in the pine littered "chancel," and the preacher stands in the pulpit or woolpress, and looks right down the nish, or board There is nothing remarkable in the pr years of hymns The order of evening prayer is shortened so that the service may not be tedious The hymns are simple, and sung with vigour and spirit The service, Indeed is suitably foreshortened, for the body and the head of it all must be the sermon There is no opportunity for church ordinances or ceremonies to have much evil cat, but what the pardon has to say will be remembered and talked about for many days to come 'The text occurs to suit the time and place " '1 therefore, O j e shepherds, hear the word of the Lord ' It seems to me that the Word of the Lord here is full of plenty, and beauty, and glad news, and joy It has come to you in the the ruin and the sunshine, in the full river rolling down through its forested banks It comes now in the tall grass of the plains and the flowers that stand above the glass, in the pleasant shade, and shelter, and fragrant beauty of the pine ridge It is a word which calls for thankfulness, for joy, and how is it answered, O ye shepherds' Are you in accord with the spirit of the times Are your lives full of happiness and contentment' Are you in good will one with another, and at peace with all men' Have you as men drunk deeper than any other living creatures of the chalice which this rich j ear pours form'' journeying over the plains and nature seems radiant und exultant.
