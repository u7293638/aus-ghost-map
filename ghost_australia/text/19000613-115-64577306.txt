At the first visit remark will be made that she is very nlov-r, at the second that she is wonderful, and at tho next tb'a' ahe. is marvellous. Last night, when a change of bill was presented j rsoveral noveMrs ?were introduced by ^Professor G. W. Holler. Tho cornucopia made out of a piece of paper before the people, and then emptying from it; showers of flowers mystified and surprised those present. Tho watch feat, too, causeS the owner a great .- deal of anxiety for its safety, whilo the magnetic money caused considerable amusement. The Bpirit smnke test, wherein a gentle man could smoke out of an empty pipe, amazed the audionce, and tho sackful of ghosts fairly paralysed tho gentleman that entered into tho world of spirifs. New biogrnph mcturos were presented. The notable subjects were ' Tho water chute,' ' High diving,' ' Firo call in London,' ' Charge of the Scots Greys,' ' Melbourne Cup,' ' Gardener and prac tical joker,' and ' Arrival of a train in Japan,' all being loudly applauded.
