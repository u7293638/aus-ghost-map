ST. PETER'S CHURCH, BOX HILL. The foundation stone of a new brick church was laid yesterday afternoon by the Lord Bishop of Melbourne. There was a very large attendance considering that the weather was very bleak and cold in the open air. The Rev. W. Green, the vicar of the parish, delivered an interesting address in which he related all the circumstances which had induced the Board of Guardians to remove the old church from Blackburn Creek and re-erect it in Box Hill. The ceremony was opened by the congregation singing the 500th hymn, after which the usual church dedica- tion service was solemnly read by Revs. Green, Perks, and Cresswell. His Lordship then advanced and laid the stone in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost. When this was done the Bishop delivered an earnest address in which he exhorted his hearers, and especially those who were members of the church, to love their pastor, to pray for him and to love each other. He was certain if they acted in that manner they would ex- perience no difficulty in supporting their minister. He hoped that St. Peter's Church at Box Hill would be the birth-place of many souls, and that the church would prove a great blessing to them and the commnunity at large.
