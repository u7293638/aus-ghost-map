Gome and ' sit at the fe3t of Wisdom,' ' she said, with a hard little laugh. 'At the feet of beauty, rather,' said Ivan, feeling an intense dislike for her seize him. Nevertheless, he was anxious to know her better, to discover all he could about her, and hiding his feelLgs, he obeyed. 'Now, what are you goiiur to teach me?' he asked, demarely Maroitt was delight d with the situation. Oh, her mother and Madge could but see her now in this beautiful room, in this exquisite gown, with this aristocratic man looking up at her just as if he were her slave and she his queeu— how delig! t f ul it would be 1 ' Oh, I'm not going to teach you anything. How could I ? 1 am only a girl of eighteen, and I've seen nothing of the world. But you, can answer my questions and help me to learn a great deal.' ' Very, well,' said Ivan, calmly, ' commence.' ' Are we to be neighbors ?' she asked, leaning towards him, a coquettish light in her eyes. ' I think so ; Murvfield is not far away.' ' Maryfield is your home ?T- ' res.' *- ' What do you do with your life ? Tell me something about yourself. You see how interested I am, Mr. Trent. I feel sure we're going to be awfully good friends.' ' Oh, thank you, I am sure. It's very good of yon to be interested in me, Miss Farneleigh. But, really, there's very little to tell. I'm the only son of my father, and he is a widower— to paraphrase an old saying. I live at Maryfield, manage the estate, and that keeps me pretty busy. That's all.' ' Are you fond of society ?' asked Mareia. ' Reasonably so ' ' Are there many pretty girls about here ?' ' Oh, a great many,' he said, pulling at his moustache, ami watching her with an inward amusement. Maroia looked down, furled her fan. 'Any,' she asked, with a flashing glanoe, ' that yon are particularly interested in ?' 'No. I am quite heart-whole, Miss Farne leigh.' She laughed and shook her finger at him. ' I hope you're not a woman hater.' ' Only— sometimes,' he said, wish a great deal of truth, for Miss Madge Fameleigh was becoming a great bore. ?? I hope I'll help yon to get over that,' she said, nueily. ? ' What are you going to do to amuse me ?' ' What can I do ?' he asked, with composure. ' I am at your service and Miss Abby's.' ' Oh, couldn't you give a dance at Maryfield ?' ' Not very well. I'm sorry, but my father objects to fuss. He is not very strong.' ' But he need not appear,' said Marciu, with a suggestion of a pout. ' Ah, but I should not be happy if he didn't. Ton Bee, I'm very fond of my father,' said Ivan, clearly. ' But you'll give ball's, won't you, when you're master tnere? You will be master some day, won't you f' ' I never like to think of that time,' he said ; and even Mareia felt herself Teproved. As be bade Miu Abby good night he eaw the old lady's dark eyes .fastened on his face, They were alone, Mareia having made an exouse to go {uto the ball to have a more effective fare well with Ivan than she oould bavs in Miss Abby's presence. » Well,' Raid Miss Abby, softly,' fneedn* ask vou how you like my new charga I can read you, Ivanv' ? , . ? ?- What do you mean ?' he asked, with a took of. some embamssmeut.' ' You don't like her.' ' . ? : He was sileut, then added, as he held oat {his hand* ' It'l nther Boon. I wouldn't pnesunu' ? ' Nonsense. Don't talk that way to me. We ars always frank with each other, my dear boy. You don't like my new niece, and, to tell you the rruth^I dou't love her as I thought I would. But I must make the mast other.' ' She doesn't look a bit like her father, does sire?' ' Nota bit.' ' You're sure there's no possible mistake ?' ' Oh, not the slightest. The woman who adopted her told a straightforward story, with convincing proof, and was only too glad to jret nd of the girl to me. There's no doubt. She's Dick's daughter. ' In the hall outside Mareia was apparently look ing out at the starlight. She turned with a languid movement as Ivan came towards her to say good night. ' Come to-morrow, if you con, won't you ?' 'I will if I can,' he Haid, and departed. That night as «he undressed, Mareia questioned her maid with eood results. She heard all f about Ivan Trent's beautiful home, hfa wealth, his popularity, aud her brain teemed with schemes as she laid her head on the pillow. 'It won't b* my f-iult if 1 don't catch him,' sbe thought. During the week following Maroia was intro duced to the sooiety of Malbrook, and revelled in the sensation she created. Ivan called frequently, and did his best to accept the idea that she was Miss Abby's niece— even tried to conquer any shade of prejudice and try Jto like her for his old friend's sake. But one night at Farneleieb, as he stood in the library smoking a oigar, he eame to a conclusion ' I fairly detest the girl,' he said in a whisper. Astheworda passed his lips he saw on the Chippeudale desk the miniature of Madge Farue Ieiarh'a mother. He remembered the dmr Mi« Abby had shown it to him, and impulsively lifted it. As he looked into the eyes so appealing and soft, he thought again with a new force of the girl whose life he had saved, and who had eluded hitu in the crowded streets. ' I'll do it,' he said at last. ?? It's true that the Farneleigh heiress has been found— but this girl— who is she ? I'll not rest until I know. I'll leave for New York to-morrow.' .chapter vnr. Ivan Discovers a Cure. One week later. It w*» raining hard. In the bare school-room, far down town, Madge was standing at the window. She was.tired after a long, bard day. Now rhe children had gone, and she was alone. In tbe \- worn, grey cashmere gown, with white ruffles at throat and wrists, ehe looked very pretty and simple. Severe fatigue had not been able to steal the youthful radiance from her eyes. « Ram and mud everywhere,' she murmured, watching the drops forming in streams on the panes v ' aud I eame away this morning without umbrella or over shoes, Fll wait until it moder ates a little.' fSbe turned from the window, went to her desk and sat down. With a gesture of real fatigue, she laid her clasped arms upon its top aud rested her head upon them. In fancy she saw Mareia spending the days in gaiety, the nights in dancing and romance, and a sigh left her lips. ' Yes. I would like to be in her place, off for a visit. I would love to laugh, and danee, and drive, and flirt a tiny bit, too. Oh. I'd love any thing to vary the monotony of this life. Is it ever going to come? Sometime I utmost wish same thing dirt even would happen to rou-se my ex istence ^ut of this torpor. But what's tbe use of repining ? It docs no good and only makes one more discontented;' ' Tne Rchool room was very quiet, and the eouud* from the street only reached Madge faintly in a toothing murmur. Her eyes dosed.

But to her dismay boa now realised that high poiuted railings were round the area, aud she would be obliged to jump aoroa those to reach the side walk. ' I'd forgotten them, I'll not be able to do it»'» she murmured. 'I couldn't jump down tbe araaw It's too far. I must go backhand yet— oh, I muak get out !' The words were arrested on her lips at sight of % man coming down the street towards her. ' I wonder would he help me P' she thought, ' I wonder if I dare ask him ?'
