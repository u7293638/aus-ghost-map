Several years ago one of these individuals used to make occasional visits about tho bridge across the railway, loading to the ohurchos, generally appearing when children and Indies were passing, thuR avoiding detec tion or capture, During tho past three months his ghostship has again inado his npponrance, and a few Saturday nights bnclc, gave a fright to two young men while going towards tho railway bridge. This success evidently made his ghostship very bold, ns ho suddenly appeared, the other evening at ono of the windows, at tho dwelling of tho Into Samuel Benjamin, and Inckijy tho occupant of tho room was a stalwart young man, who was not to bo Intimidated by tho appear ance of the white vision ontsido tho window, qulolly armed himself with a palling, and suddenly opening tho window, sprang through, seizing his ghostship with one hand, and made froo'uso of the pniling with the other across his ghost ship’s back, which quickly brought forth the ejaculation—“ d—n it I nip pot a ghost, knock off, it is only a lark."
