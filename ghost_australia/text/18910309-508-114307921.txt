A Ghost in the Suburbs, A POLICEMAN BOLTS AT THE SIGHT. One of those mysterious visitors known as a ghost appeared some short time ago in one of our suburban streets, completely demoralising the local police force, who made himself scarce in a manner never previously eclipsed in this country. It appears that a visitor from a southern district who was staying »vifch some friends in the suburb referred to. imbibed so heavily, or in other words, got on the spree so desperately, that he began ' to see snaiks,' as they say in the country press. This attack of delirium tremens became so severe one night tha,t he forced his way out of the house, despite his i'riend's attempt to keep him in, and wrapped only in a sheet he made for the street. Th.*? man was an educated sort of fellow, and inucn given to amateur Shaksperian recitals, and now in his temporary insanity he had reason enough left to feel that, ?wrapped, in a white sheet, he made a good repre sentation of the Ghost in ' Hamlet.' The friend, utterly powerless to interfere, followed the ?unfor- tunate maii oa to the street, in the hope of being able to get the assistance of a policeman to bring Ivlm home. It was about 3 o'clock in the morning, and still dark, when a policeman did appear, and right ahtisd in a most lonely part of the street. It inust nave been a superstitious ' bobby/' for at the sight of the unearthly rover he turned on ids heel and fled for his life. The ghost in- ! stantiy behaved in a most unghostly manner, for j it pursued Eobert with a desperate endeav«r to take him into custody. A public-house lamp post saved the constable, for it pulled the ghost up with a short round turn, and he knoeksd for nearly haif-an-hour to get in. It was just on daybreak before the spiritual man was got back to his home. Whether the 'bobby' is running j yet is not known ; but the poor ghost is dead, and a well-known town has lost a well-known man.
