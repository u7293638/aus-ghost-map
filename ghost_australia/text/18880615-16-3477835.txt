She alleges that the female assistants dressed themselves up as ghosts to frighten her, locked her up in a padded room, informing her that they were going for an undertaker to order her coffin, and subsequently one of the attendants, in the dress of a sister of charity, urged her to make a confession before the coffin cargo. She also states that she was dragged by the hair of the head to the bathroom, and, on refusing to enter was slapped on the face. The complaint has been forwarded to the Government.
