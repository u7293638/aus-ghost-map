SHAKESPEARIAN CONUNDRUMS. THE following questions are proposed for Shakespearian scholars to answer: Did " the books in the running brooks" contain flowing sentences? If the "three thousand ducats well" of Shylock was an artesian, one ? If when Richard saw the " sun of York" there was any heir apparent? If the " sermons in stones" weren't hard reading? If those "who stood upon the order of their going" at Macbeth's supper did not have to set out without further orders ? What Banquo "called on Macbeth for," if there " was no speculation in those eyes ?" If Richard refused to " let the coffin pass," did he order it up? If the tale that the ghost of Hamlet's father "coull unfold" was equal to that of a rattlesnake ? Was Bottom on the school committee when he said, " Masters, spread yourselves ?" Was it waist time when Puck " put a girdle round the earth in forty minutes ?" Was Ariel in the newspaper line when be said, " I will be correspondent to command." If "Care keeps his watch in every old man's eye," where does he keep his clock ?
