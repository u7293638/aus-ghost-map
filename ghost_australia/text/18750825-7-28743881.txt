FREE EDUCATION. TO THE EDITOR. I am, Sir, &c.;, J.E.T. Mount Gambier, August 16. Sirâ€”I hope you-will allow are to say word to reply to "J. A. H." In his letters he classes free education with pauperism and says we are going to make paupers of our children by giving them free education. I ask J. A.H." if the working men objected to the Government grant to the University. No; they considered one was wanted in the colony, and they won't call those children paupers who go there, but they claim the same privilege for their children they so willingly concede to their wealthy fellow colonists. Then "J. A. H." asks what is to become of all our private schools. First he says that all the teachers will be thrown out of employment; then he says people will send their children to private schools in preference to free schools if the pri vate one is beat. "J. A. H." reminds me of the time when railways were first opened in England. People said if these railways go on what is to beoome of our coachmen and post boys, to say nothing of the poor coaohmakera and horses? Well, railways did go on, and so will free education until every child in Her Majesty's dominion! shall be able to read and write. But "J. A.H.* says we want to tax the whole oommunlty to educate children at sixpence a week. I can inform "J. A.H." that the land we live In belonsg to those children who have been born and who have yet to be born in the colony, and all they ask is that a portion of that land be kept back from sale, and that it be let on lease. The rent will then pay all that will ever be required for education, for as the Inhabitants Increase so will the price of the land, and "J. A. H." will find the education tax gatherer only a ghost.
