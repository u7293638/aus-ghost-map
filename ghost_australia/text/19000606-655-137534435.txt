Yes, Burgess. (Enter Huigess w.ith tele gram.) A telegram ! Dcitstuble ! I might have known that something would ? . That will do; Burgess. (Exit Burgess.) I hate telegrams !

Dinner at tlie Savoy, and the Lyceum afterwards. Glorious ! ?Dear boy ! But how funnily it's worded. ' Dinner Savoy, seven sharp. Lyceum afterwards. Bring Patty.' What ,in the world does lie mean ? It is Patty ! Why, it's not from Charlie after all. It's from that gold bag (tied in the middle, the man Turnbull. And, of course, it's meant /f'-v Charlie. Patty, indeed ! Insufferable impu dence !

Mrs. Furnival : This evening ! Rather crude, isn't it ? I was under the im-; pression that I had a way of looking1 decent. I try to, for the credit of the. family— and for— my lord's .pleasure. ?Mr.' Furnival : And there isn't such another woman in the world, and you; kiu-v it, you sweet witch. (She curt seys.) Well, is that all I'm to have for my pretty speech ? Mrs. Furnlval : Oh, no ! You shall have a— cup of my particular tea. Char lie ! — Burgess ! Mr. Furnival: Hang Burgess!

I won't say a word, and, perhaps, you'd feel better if you told me everything. ? Mr. Furnlval : Oh, it's nothing. At least, if you don't know what's tlie mat ter, I don't, i Mrs. Furnival : Why, the dear boy is a positive enigma. But I think I rather like a mysterious grief. (Mr. Furnival moodily stirs his tea.) You poor, wor rled old man.. Drink your tea, and let ' me play to you. Mr. Furnival : No, thanks. My — my head adhes. Mrs. Furnival : Oli,' Charlie, I am sor ry. Let me ring for some Eau de Cologne.

I hope you are not going to be ill, for then I sliould.be. sorry. Is. the light too strong for your eyes? Let me turn it down. Mr. Furnival : Very well,. Madge. If you are determined to have it so, so It must be. Only it's the first time we've ! —I mean it's the first time you've ever; ' 'been like tills, and I can't make it out, that's all.

Then, if you .have no objection I'll— I'll look in at the club for an hour or two, Mrs. Furnlval: By ail means ; but you won't find Mr. Turnbull there. Mr. Furnlval: Oh, Turnbull be ? (starts to his feet). What has he to do with it, anyhow 7 And what do you know of ills goings and comings. (Takes her hand and draws lier to her feet.) No, Madge, that won't do. Look at me I Look ine in tho face ! You have -said too much— or not enough. What lias Turnbull been saying to you ?
