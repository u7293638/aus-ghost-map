IIHOST lH TIE SOUSE OF CMMOll Yes, and a most peculiar ghost, too • not an ordinary, ancestral spectre, but the mystic double: of a lady who is both aJive and well, ani can in no way account fcr the mysterious apparition. Amom; the officials who have suites of rooms allotted to them within the precints of the Houses of Pailiament, is Mr. Archibald J. C. Milman, Cleik Assistant of the Honse. With his wife and family, he has charming rooms just off the Speaker's Court. The dining-room in particular is a very beautiful chamber, panelled nearly to the ceiling, and decorated with some very exquisite blue and white china, and a good many valuable old prints. This room, together with others of suite, opens out of a kind of transverse corridor. Not once or twice, but several times, and in broad (daylight too, the. exact counterpart of Mrs. Milman has been seen to pass up and down the corridor, in and out of the rooms—and a! ways in the absence of the lady herself. Servants have seen it several times and so have other people. Here is a queer thing that occurred quite recenty. On returning from a drive one afternoon, Mrs. Milman saw a friend in front of her, in jhe passage or hallway. The friend, who was proceeding in the same direction as herself, passed into one of the rooms opening on to the corridor, and was heard to say, apparently to someone in front of him, "Good afternoon, Mi's. Milman 1" at the same time closing the door behind him. Mrs. Milman opened it and went in— only to find her friend utterly bewildered. He declared he had seen her go into the room in front of hi ji, acd now she had opened the door and came in behind him. It was incomprehensible. *' My experience as a CFARITY Charity Carnival Or- Caenival. ganiser, 51 an interesting 16 page illustrated pamphlet, published by A. S. Gordon, free on application.
