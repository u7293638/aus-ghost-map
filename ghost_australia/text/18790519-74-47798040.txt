Thoutgh speciatlly intended for 0 the medical professien, it may be usefnl to know what Dr. M'Urea says about dis- i ifecitants, for typhoid fever is contagious: i-" The best disinfectants are carbolic Sacid, chlorinm, Condy's fluid, and sulphur Sfteacs. One part of carbolic acid snhohil be added to thirty parts of the fluid iun it which clothes and bedclothes are im tnersed, and one part to twenty of the Sstools of tile patient. Chlorine may be Iused il the musae proportions, and it is probabliy the most powerful disinfectant. y Condy's fluid is also a powerful disin fectant, but the rapid matnner in which it is deconmposed whenl brought into contact or with fiscal or putrefying matter renders a larger iamount of it necessary. For puri fication of the air there is nothing like tlhe fumes of burning sulllphur, but they require W to be very donse.
