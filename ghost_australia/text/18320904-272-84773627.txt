MIDSHIPMAN'S VICISSITUDES. I now beg leave, to introduce myself to my ' readers no longer as a goodrlookiug, curly-headed ' midshipman— u pride in my looks, defiance in my eye,' strutting the quarter-deck with tbe proper step, and repeating the constant' Ay, ay, sir!'* as ' the officer of the watch gave, his loud commands, ' but as a midshipman's boy, the servant of the ? mess, the drudge of all drudges. It became ne- * cessary that some one should do the work : and the lot nrst fell upon the captain's son, who,* although a very nice boy, was not likely to com« into our views when his father was within hajl. We next pitched upon the captain's nephew, but , . he declared he had been told to mess jjn the cabin, which certainly we did not envy him, and , quietly consigned him to his burgoo and his pride, ', whilst I was installed in air the honors of the situation. I am quite of Byrorfs opinion in Don Juan, that those who have been servants have the t opportunity of becoming better masters, although true it ib beyond contradiction that there is no , tyrant like the emancipated slave. I jru&t; that 1 the numerous- kicks, aud cuffs, and curses so fire* quently and«o roughly bestowed upon me, have / made me cautious, from the experience of my own t feelings' in' those days, of bestowing them upon another. My first essay at cooking (for any' body: can make tea who can boil a kettle,)- was a beef steak pie; for, while we remained near the island, we were supplied with small quantities of fresh provisions. A jumbje of pepper and salt junk made the dish palatable enough, of whi^h 1 had the strongest evidence, as my masters did hot leave one bit for their cook, and seetn$g deposed to rob me .of a small portion of thei'skin of salt pork, with as many bristles thereon as 'are fpu^qnl . in a scrubbing-brush, and which did not belong to them, for I stole It from the bbatswaio. In vain they asked for water— ire had little enough of that; for when the ship struck, almost one of the first things done, when the leak was discovered^ was to 'start it.' What was left was used spar ingly : and we had not many spare hands to be v employed-for.Jhe purpose of getting more. My1 .next specimen asa cook v» as a splendid one, and was in^the shape of a mouse-pie— the fails of the little animals -were collected like pigecVn*' feet, and made a most inviting dish. I got preciously cuffed for this exhibition ; but 1 vi-rily believe that no man living, if hungry, would k»ow a mouse from a sparrow-pie;— tlivy are very delicate eating, and became a fashionable dish with UB When curtailed. My occupations in the be1*' were no excuse for not keeping ray watch; and I safely aver that no dog which draws a baker's barrow had more to do and lees toeHt than I had. Jr the heat of the bun was uncomfortable in one respect, it was beneficial in another, inasmuch as it almost entirely deprived as of appetite, and we were on short allowance enough. In a week the squadron arrived, consisting of the Meteor, the liger, and a schooner .; under their wcort we weighed our anchor and put to sea, intending ta shape a course for Sierra Leone. A detail of the sufferings of the crew of the launch, wftch had been sent for the squadron, would make' a man's hair stand on end for a fortnight r the v re turned to us walking spectres-mere ghosts of living men— a resurrection. * * * A ? * .» * I hacl been relieved from my dignified situation « of «n.dsh.pman'* boy, a«d «V Met* .
