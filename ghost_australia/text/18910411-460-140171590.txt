NATURAL HKTORY NOTES. WHITE WALLABY. " N.S.W. Native," writing from Wagga j Wagga, says" In your issue of tbe 14th inst., folio 603, ' J. J. M.' inquires if any of your readers can. give an instance of a white wallaby having been seen alive. In reply, I may state that I cannot; but it is more than likely that individual white Wal labies (albinos) should exist, as albinos are to be met with in every variety of bird or beast living. I have seen a snow-white kangaroo â€”one that was captured years ago where the town of Temora how stands. A large white kangaroo did duty as a very erratic ghost for a long time at Coree, on the Billooong, on several occasions on dark nights giving the' mail-driver and belated travellers a start. One of the prettiest animals I have seen was a snow-white kangaroo-rat, with pink eyes.. I have also seen white opossums and other albinos. A farmer's wife, a friend of mine, j near Albury, saw a lot of crows on a fiehoe near her house, a pure white one being among them. She was so struck by the ap pearance of the bird that, in the absence'of any person of the male persuasion, she plucktly loaded a gun and shot it The fact of two white wallabies being found together is curious, but may be aooountod for by their ; being twins, or the issue of A female pre disposed to throw albinos, wbioh, being white, would attract the nofice of a bud pi prey, to which' they would "fall easy victims.
