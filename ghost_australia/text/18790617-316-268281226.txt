Siakr,—ify Dear Friend: Few event8--m life oould'huvoigiven me more pain than the deplorable-miBtnke which has placed my son and your daughter in such a false position towards each.other iand'towarda the world. It is a misfortune at a kind that mnst always ^fall mnch more heavily tipon the woman than npon the-man. ana ao snoh l ieplote. it eYen more npon'your daughter s aoeonnt than upon my eon's. I had been led to suppose—as, no doubt, you yourself had also been—that Adrian was paving ins addresses to Miss Deloftrae, of , Beloraine 'Park ;vandil amtefl with yourself \- in a warn approbation of his ehoics; iut, believe me, if I had learned that we were both austaken, and that my son's choice had 'fallen on yonr daughter, Z should have been equally well isatlsfied And . now my own opinion ib that this marriage, contracted-«B it 'has SjBen -ntfder ta huge misapprehension,:*honia -nevertheless stand good. The young Couple do not -dislike each o&er;, and one them, at lehBt, the most amportantone also—tlx woman—has no-prior attachment g I have had a long conversation withtay son on the .subject. He -admits that .his-own condact and conversation with yonr danghter might have easily ledi her inezpeuencea mind to expect a -proposal of jnarna^e irom him, and so rendered her the easy and nnfnnpicious victim of his own lamentable blunder.

Among these were Sir Adrian Fleming, Mr. Coyle and Mr. Brandon Coyle, Dr Bennet, flev./Mr. Oomstock, and, of oonrse, Mr. James Flint Some of these friends, hearing that there was a will, wondered why on earth the restor had ever thought it necessary io ttuke one, seeing that he had little ot nothing to leave. The will was read by Lawyer Flint, in the dming-room of the rectory, and in; the presence of ! the family, friends,: and servants; It needs but a. passing notaoei In it the, i testator, first of all, constituted hiB ward and step daughter of full legal age, and left to hei hiB whole properly in trust for the use. of his own children, appointing her the sole guardian of his ohildren and the sole exeoutrix of his will This caused a gieat deal of. critioism among the hearers.
