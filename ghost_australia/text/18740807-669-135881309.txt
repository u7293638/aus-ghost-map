Death ofMnlier, the Buckley Estate Claimant. TbomasMaher, the claimant of the Bnckl»y estates, died in the Melbourne gaol on Monday night. It will ba remembered tbat Mr P. C. Buckley died two years ago, leaving property to ibe value of some £60,000 or £70,000- . So- far as could be atoerthtned, be died intestate,' and without any next of kin. Administration to bis estate was granted to two creditors. A few months afterwards Minor, who was an old friend of Buckley's, produced a will said to hava been made in bis favour some 30 year3 before. Maher alleged that when Buckley came to Gipps Land (rom the Manaro district, he was apprehensive ? bat biB life would be in danger from the blacks, who were at tbat time troublesome;- He there fore rode across one day ~ from his station io Manaro to Maher's, and' dictated a- will, 'which was d-avn up by a person* called Hennessey, a sort of bush, lawyer,- and was witnessed by two men named Farrell and1 Keighroll. ' This docu ment Maher some years after left in tbe custody of a friend of his, but after that no trace of it was obtained till Mter' Buckley's death. At that time Mahefr wus in tbe Wagga Wagga. Hospital, suffering from paralysis; and he received one day a letter from a postmaster of a township in New Somh Waies, enclosing the will in question. This document puroorted to be sent to the po»l tnaster.fcy ona 'Peter Cnrly,' who said he did not know where Miher lived, but he thought it might be useful to him. . Maher /ound people who believed in tbe genuineness of bis story i and they assisted him \n prosecutn bis claim. His applica tion for probate was, however, resisted by tbe Attorney-General, on bobalf of tbe Croirn, and by the administrators of the eata'e, who alleged that the whole will was a forgery, that it was not in Hennessey's 'writing, that Buckley; never signed it, and that reithar Farrell or- Keiahrdll (who died before Buckley} had witnessed it; on tno contrary, they called a Eiass 'of evidence to-'show that the, wh5Je.document^was.,.w.ritten. by. Maher, tbe spelling' p'ar'icalarly bearing a stron',' resem biance to that in letters admittedly Maber's ( Mr Justice Mciksworth.rin a very exhauative judg ment, anuounced Siis: opinion that the' will was a forpery of Maher's, and refused to 'give :him probate of it. The Crown then undertook to !prosecute Maher lor forgery and perjury, and he jwas committed for trial some -months ago. ' He has sjneo romained io gaol, but. was to have been iried'next month/' He bad'suffered from paralysis ]of the lower part, of the body for along time pa9t, !and during bis examination in court, he had to ibe carried io and !out of the bailding. Since bis oommiital for trial be has- remained in the gaol 'hospital,' bojt for some weelts. past be bas.;been gradoally sinking, and, as we have' said, he expired on -Monday night. '' Maber ,was 60 years oi age, !and a native of New Sooth. ? His wife, »ho is mentioned in the will as' being entitled to Buckley's property* equally with 'her husband, died come years ago. Maher made no statement before his death as to the will. ; As inr the case of all piisoneri who die. in'.'fjjol, an inquest' will be beld.- — drgus, ?.-.'_ ' A-.
