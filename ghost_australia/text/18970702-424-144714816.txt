IliniÂ»\r\s Kut'k*. [Fitosi -n:n own Coiiuksiuxiiknt.] I I Mi sr congratulate yon 011 your issue of the 18th, and must s.iy it d ies you credit, it far surpassing any local paper I havo seen on this occasion. May yonrshnde never grow le;;. 1 have very little to relate in the news line or should have Wi-itlen be fore. Wi' bud some nice sN- i-ly r.i in. II ll- I Llll' Wf\LU!L'l IS Mill (.1 J-l 1\\. I Tlie Ol.l L'jndim is li'i^y crushing j and expect to li'iisli ni-m irrow. It looks well and ongliL to go up to Hozs per ton. I'll send thu result of tbe yield '.vhDU they cle j.:i up. Ttie f.mn:rs about here .ire wiring in to a finish. We have our ' S ici.il ' ovary night. Our programme is Butler first, then ghost stories, then a game o' ' crib.,' after which we wind up with the chorus ' Clementina.' Wo don't troublo about voices chording, everyone has a free hand, and if wo don't have harmony wo have noise, and that ingntens tne spirits wo raise by tbe ghost stories and gives the outsiders courage to go homo. Glorious life for some people, but rather monoton ous for a person who has seen any other life. But man's a queer animal, always grumbling. I expect you are taken that way occasionally. I no ticed one or two of yours, and I think you stood it very mild, but it seems an individual signing himself ' Far mer ' means to give a strong lecture on tbe subject, nnd I don't think it will do the other side any good with the intelligent portion of the public. Good bye. All well. Girls at a premium, and young men round here are willing to serenade a broomstick with a petticoat on.
