ghost stories; Talking about ghosts, it may not be out of place to implore those who intend to write Christmas ghost stories to spare .us the familiar line : " Ho could not tell how long he had been asleep when he awoke with the feeling that some one was m the room." It is to behoped that all right-minded papers and magazines will join us in sup pressing this well worn sentence. It may be permissible to hesitate about sending the guest to tho only vacant room in the house, and then to frankly aknowledge that it has the reputation of being haunted. We will be de lighted over the courage of the guest who laughs at the absurd story, and who takes his candle and goes up the creaking old stair, and finds a cheerful fire burning in tho grate. We are also prepared for tho certain com ing of the ghost and the terror of the sceptical guest, but we must insist that he can tell accurately how long he has been asleep, even if he wakes with a chill and a strange feeling all over him, for there really ought to be some original feature introduced into these old and well- beloved ghost stories. â€” Detroit Free Press.
