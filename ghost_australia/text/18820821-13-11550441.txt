ABOVE THE SPEAKER. BY TIMOOTEUS. .? Timotheus placed on high." KailWAlB and still railways remain the diet of the Assembly By way of a change the consideration of lines to be constructed out of the new loan is relieved by dealing with estimates of expenditure under the old loan If lines are set aside for an evening it is to make way for the burning question as to the country towns at which repairing sheds are to be erected Ministers allow the House to take its own time over these non "party itcmB There can be no serious quarrelling about them, and in the mean while the Government exists It is an augury of a continuance of of this Agreeable state of things that Mr Berry can leave the House to visit banquets and can announce a trip to Sydney He has accustomed the party to his absence by attending very little of late and leaving the lead to Major Smith a hat hon gentleman has at all events exhibited one great quality for political com maud the quality which some people call inconsistency and others versa Hilly The early part of Thursdays Sitting, Major Smith informed the country that he sees perfectly through Mr Bent's little game which is to stonewall his own measure to dawdle with it and make it occupy as much of the session as possible so that debateable issues will have to be postponed Later on the city member objected to deal with the central railway station off hand and the major was with them tendering an emphatic protest against the Government generously rushing important business In all lands and in all times the professional politician does these things without an effort is as unconscious of the change as the chameleon i of a transition from blue to black Materials for an essay on the point are abundant to whoever choose to undertake the task D s rarely supported the first reading of Lord Palmerston e and conspiracy bill on the ground that it is right to protect our allies and (a dose tion of Radicals having occurred) to upset the Government on the second reading declaring that England. a hospitality to refugees must be maintained inviolate at all hazards The OpiOBition of 1730 submitted a motion cor dennant, Vi alpolo because his arrangement with the Bank of England favoured the South Sea Company in which he held shares When we alpolo explained that his shares were bank shares the first motion was withdrawn and another substituted protesting that the agreement robbed the South Sea Company and subsidised the bank. It costs Major Smith nothing to acclimatise these traditions Ministers declared cc ohv so that they were astonished by his change on Thursday Mr Bent-who can execute a slip Hap with any of them avowed that he was shocked and surprised Let us carry the local workshops he pleaded And the members whose little claims had been mates ned joined in the supplication No gloomily replied the major I li eat my boots first Remembering the vast stores of nature ment thus placed at the enemy's command Ministers gave way 1 state members had to give up the evening to the Hargreaves claim I here never was a time in the history of Parliament in which a Hargreaves claim was not before the House Like the ghost in the i lay the claim is first knocking under one part of the stage and then muttering under another part tempting the histrionic ejaculation Wclleald old mole Canst lorie 1 the ground By Mr A North v pioneer But somehow Mr Hargreaves never gets his case in the right hands About 1863 he made a terrible mess of the business Under cross examination at the bar he was forced to admit that members took up as he phrased it the members declared that Mr Hargreaves told lies and a discriminating pub! c be loved both parties One of the elected members is a convict others are ruined meat are dead but the claim lives with an unhappy vitality It has not been taken up by the right men yet Sand 1 unit en braced it on this occasion with sends us asm If only Ballarat had done so oil would have been well for when The wary veterans of the Ph nix tribe take the war path no one dreams of opposing them As Mr Bent said with a p 1 \ ben submitting his last railway estt mules' I defy you to help Ballarat getting the line a share of the pickings But Ballarat was cold and Mr Hargreaves ob ta i B nothing The only man who does no get the reward promised by the original select comittee is the man whom the select committee raid was the man most entitled to reward Given a bad claim well engineered in the Victorian Parliament and a good claim indifferently engineered and a speculator may unhesitatingly back the chances of the first Mr 1 Feher daily grows into more disfavour with the Opposition leaders This gentleman says he most active and hard working of the oil cells of the Reform and Protection League 3 that body has not half the life in it BE ice his resignation which it had before Anditwouli seem that he really believed all the sentiments he used to utter about the evil designs of the Service members and the monopoly of truth and justice by the Radical cause Every now and then therefore he has to lecture his old assoc area I do not approve of coquetting with the Constitutionalists said Mr Fisher on one occasion when his rolling orb of vision detected what was going on between Mr Berry and the Corner I don t approve of bringing charges against the Minister of Lands whenyouknowthattheyoraof the cock and bull order says Mr I isher-and Mr Berry sees no harm in such batting When therefore Mr 1 Fisher was nominated for the vacancy in the Conference caused by the departure of Mr Berry that hon gentleman took the extreme course of disavowing the member who won Mandurang back for him. It is ridiculous be said to think that such a selection would please me There was a good deal of curiosity as to whom Mr Berry would choose vice Mr Fisher thus cold shouldered out of the ranks And when the name of Mr Deakin was announced there was a good deal of reading and a good deal of such remarks- Oh I it the newspaper quarter he desires to keep in with in it? Possibly it was this selection which tempted Mr Deakin to essay an ambitious flight Mr Berry has led and leads by his power of debate of making the most of a case in the house and it was for his protégé to indicate that the Party has a second orator The Baldwin case was at hand No one can say that Mr Deakin did not make the most of it An hour was occupied by a speech of the class which wins the advocate applause in court and after the warming up of the lodge insures the convic- son of the prisoner Baldwin was dismissed -He was bound to come out by the late Hon R Ramsay and by Dr Watkins but "I i8e.una,íríB would not do to conjure with 7 the, area was occupied with stone about Flynn and mason and ran in and Flynn two hateful warders with suggestive and tempting patronymics Reaching up that Irish raw is how one opposition member describes this treatment the case One of the men is townsman Tyrel rates as other it is said by r elechonna7h0xíU,!ht to know votes at the m T /°Ttbo Premier 19 " credible he be 500 and F1<«UKaa would not we read And " turned-out 'at Flynn T.

Mr. Dow has discoursed upon the iniquity of the Minister of Lands in not confiscating a squatter s reserve-and an article has been written about it Professor Pearson has arraigned certain idiotic publicans who object to taking Federal Bank notes and an article has been written about it. This is too much for the most patient member The whisper now gone round, " Another put up thing The case against Sir Bryan was based by Mr Deakin on the boasts made by Flanagan after his railway ride " I spoke to the Premier, the man is said to have declared "He was as affable as you please He told me I was a brother of a boy' and that I should have the head warder ship whenever I liked After which Flanagan nourished his stick and executed a break down round the warders hall, emitting Tipperary wells at intervals There is yet another Flanagan story The scene is at the Battle of the Nile A lull occurred in the conflict The guns ceased to roar Nelson, stepping to the rail of the quarter deck, anxiously inquired ' Is Tim Flannigan on board the ship "Aye aye, your honour, came cheerily from the fo'castle "Then, said Nelson "let the battle proceed It was the Tim Flannigan of the day who told that story
