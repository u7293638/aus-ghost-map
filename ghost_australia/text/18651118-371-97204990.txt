I* is not so eas* to disturb our elaborate svstera and time-honoured customs aait is to swi-ep out a mill; and. I shall certainly set my face against any rash reforms or innovations. P.-~Oli, ah ! We knows what a obstructive warmint you are— 'beggin' your pardiag. But I say, look here— jest let's have a quiet argy ment, in the abstract, doa't yer call it?r-for X don't like to be personal nohows ; leastways, not without it can't be avoided ; aud then, o1 course, I goes in ladle aad spout, and no gauunen. . tfut about yourseirfn1*— let's jt?8t consider the morality of it, don't yer know. Here's a hinstitooshuu, we'll say is roost 'ily respectable (th--' it aint, not altogether). Now, I've got au unbounded admiration for the service j aud if I was a mortal 1 wouldn't mind bem' aaythink myself, dow« from a messenger to a governor, or perhaps even a prime minister, if it \l only bring me in JE8OO' a-year and uothink to do ; tho' I consider, under present circumstances, all government sei-vants ought to work hard every day from nine to six, and a great deal harder too, mort parUcxkler after the 'ansorae rise-as you glve.'em Jsjtely. Thgy re ' a getting', quite l^t.qn, that five i-er wht, bonus. But that aint what T ^ was ag6in* tti 'talk about. What I meahter say ie as this ^ — Here's a hlhshti tooshun — its your noble self as is -the present. questioa --which perteuds, aud ortex tie, most 'ily respectable. As a branch of the avii service, it orter be as honorable a perfessi»u as the army and the navy— ^l was gbin* to say the' volnntwri tan. nntv thpv'rft imTtv vrelt aimet to. smash how) — and so it might be* if it wasn't for two or three things as spiles it. Now, I don't meanter say but what there aint a niauy honor able gfents on your staff ; % but you've got a system as works to make 'em quite totherways; and I must say- it's 'been the means, o* cultiwatin some o* the meanest stieakinest characters as t ever was «eet»t .What I alludes to now is the' way your compartment riggleates the seizin part' o* the bizness. Now. I'll jest iinagin a caso somethink tike this 'ere — 1 11 'suppose a chap comes here a passenger in a we&sei;} and has got a box o* trinkets, hut is short o' ready cash; so ?es he.to theskip}-er, '1 11 jest leave this' here bos, as ij worth a fifty-pun-notp, tor adny or two, as security for niy passage monty till 1 can; raisefhe wind a bit.' Well, the' skipper take*, it; and, as he** a-goin* to the play, or what no^ and dun't like to risk its layiu about iii his cabin, he waiks over to his agent, atwl, ses he, ** Jest- take care «' this 'ere box for me till you get the ten.ptrand* on it.': *' AU right,'* ses the, totlier, it '11 be safe here,*' stickin ^t up in a coruer and shying some old papers on it. Soon ? arterwards they drops in with a iaspector tf police, and,- ses he,. ' There's : been: a lot a jewlry prigged about Gawler. Have any cave., left sieh a thing with you ?' ' O no,' sed they, ; 'but we've got a box o* knieknacks as we're' a holdin' for ten poand.' AW theto they up*' and tells him all the history about it.' Next day we'll spose a peeler walks in and ses- in a most; bumptious and imperent manner, he's come to , take possession of a box o' stuien goods. Mister Agent, wlKVwe U suppose, is a constant suffenn wictiin to frailttes in his temj-eraiuent. hearin' this, goes off into a pelterand tells the peeler to go and warm hisself soraewheres. Whereupon mister peeler, like the evil sperrit as w-?pt in Scripture and.fetcVd seven devils more wicked^ than hisself,gf-e«~and brings a Custom House officer. But .Mistvr Agent has-been rileA-'intdi ses he, ??* 1 went tet that peeler, see fcbe box, but I'll show it to you if you'll send hint -away.' So ; Jerry (we'll suppose that's the officer) sends the. lobster away, and then ttie box is guv up, and* off he stalks with it, as |-ompus as a blow d out bull-frog, a crohm' along -with his seizure under his arm. And now, what would be likely to? happen in sich st. case as this? *vhy, yer see, your system of sharing out this sort of plunder might act as thus; — Jerry ini&ht; go to Jirriiuy (we'll suppose bitn to be another officer, don't yer-know), and though perhaps they'd cut «ach other's throats if they had the ghost of a chance, yet you may believe they'd go in as thick «s thieves, to plunder a third party, and then th.-y might consolidate their heads together and pi--k out all their clauses in their Act o' Parfiameai, ?o as to try fust to. get . the goods forfeited as bein' smuggled; second, to inflict a pecunary penalty on the owner of 'enf ♦ third, to fine the skipper for unlegally laadin' 'em ; then to nutlet the agent for concealin' ?eoi, and the Lor^ knows what besieges ; and v^iy likely they'd try.every dodge they could think on, so as to get all they could out of all the unfort'nate innocent indi Yidjuali. 'Cos why? Why, 'cos their honor (mind their hekor} would be at stake to g?t; a conwiction, the same as » common poliee^kait, hnt HMMt.lv twos the hiffo-pst mart a' th*» finpa and forfeitures is to go into their pockets. Nyw, what I mean to say is this, that your plan of rewarding gentlemen for this sort ©' work goes to make 'em the despicablest shabby informers as I ever heerd on — it seems to me to go on de gradin' 'em to sich a pitch till, like Judas Hiscarrots, they'd sell their Saviour for a mess of porridge, and persecute him with sich vindic tive malignity as crucifixion would be a pleasure to it; and I say that sich a system, in a hiusti tooshun where men is xlready better than well paid tot their work (I don't say all on 'em is), is a disgrace, and orter be done away with. Now, I don't pertend t© say as a mftu shouldn't be punished for sniuggtin*. If he goes*into that ?on o* thing he knows the risk he's got to run; and if h«*s cotched, o* course he putsr up with the penalty ; bat when, it's as plain as a pike Staff tint these could be no intention to smuggle —the siaaple reason for a few powKfewoxth q* things bein'- put in a certain piace beln' «o clear— -and the amount o* dooty beia' s« r.dic|ous paltry as not to bear the least comparison with ,the. risk, then- I say a set. o* .too--ds_u(eker« ♦hojirfiQ'tjhejftllciwed,*© 6^a*d cireum*eut a Wi*|io©^i#^-r-byv^5«^%'^.Ei4 t^V&iafc; jg& ' iaWv*nd^petftapa;inweB^^n^.swearji«' to all aorta oMfes «o*a« to get money, o^tth'? jw» bevgar'spocJeet into their'n.

'a fly and it comes down, they ca»*t make head nor tail of it; so ses they f We'll give the parties the benefit of the doubt,' and so they dismisses -the case.
