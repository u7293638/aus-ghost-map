%*U$ mi J lufrfcrs. A WIFE HUNT. We came slowly down the steps of George Brook's house. Bna late. r vt'lisfrifad~ym t^'Mih *rf tbemf'Sam* I, 48 we walked toward Broadway. 'HowdBbe era get her' exclaimed my friend, by way of answer. ? I wffl teU yon all about it, if yon will eome around here to Chess Tunnel, and take same Budwras wn* me.' So we Halted around to tie International Chess Tunnel, dived into the callaT, passed the groups around the billiard and chess rfrimpinnw, and the players at derflamong liie-taflars, and took onr seats in a separate compartment under tile side-walk. Die alcove made a dose enough jmi***^ fa, a real wine cellar. A foaming tankard of Liebot sehaner was placed before my Mend, and a. elans of Budweis before me. A fine ronod fromage de Brie— tram New Jersey— graced the centre of the table. We sit a while in silence, thi-Aing of the eoaple we bad just left— of George, big,grnfl, lank, ^wiAJMmJt fnfl «ff nn^jf^ trniwwt* \- and of Jennie his wife, blonde, natty, quickas a flash, whom George was always regarding witii a gaze partly amused, pkrdy frightened. Their house was not large, bat crammed iriji furniture and knickkaacks of the most incongruous kind — so crammed tliat George never knew quite what to do with bis legs, and was CQoscioas that toe eagle eyes of Jennie knew just how near they were to upsetting something. There was not place even far his baulk of law papers ; so when ever he brought any of those articles home he took them to tie room upstairs, which Jennie called the nursery. Bat there was no child in the nursery, aorwas tfwre &e; prospect «a* any. ' By Jove !' said ray friend, bringing his hand down onthe table with, a smack. 'What a pretty Etffe thing she is, and what » little devil! Did yon see how perfectly she sat, tfee ruddy hair jost showing over the back of tint deep sofa, or chair or whatever it was? And the dress just swept right — ' ?Bestram yourself, my dear feuow.'said I, in a lordly way. 'Perhaps yon wouldn't have noticed those particulars with w keen a. zest if you did sot happen to be pretty good-looting, and Jennie had not been firing all her small batteries at yon for the last half hoot ?Oh,psh*wr satf he, reddening* Bttfe awl braying his nose in the Uebotachauer. ? Wd], yOB inos-.' said J, in a patronising fame, * I hxve been there. In fact, there was a time when I thought her the loveliest woman in die ndd, and— would yon believe ft*— it ms just the very tune tint George captured her, took her right away from under mynnee!' ?Beueveit?* said my friend, ma SHU, small ?raice-'^iyjaotr *™^ '*^ ?Comenow, thai? s too bad V said I, snlkfly. and applied myself to the Bodwen. He burst into a very shrill laugh. 'Go on with your rat-SdHing.' he Bain, and laughed: again, thb time so bud that the bfllW players looked aroend, Una was bis idea of wit. ? Wen, tten,' said T, after an uncomfortable passe, 'ft happened after this wise. Butt want you first to understand that I tolerate no interruption:. Let me teU the story straight through, and then you can make what comments you please.' My .friend settled himself so that the fight was not on his eyes, and prepared to listen. 'Jamie Graham belongs to respectable rich people here, who, by giving a certain number of etttexfeBnmentB, can pat their sons, ^*'^M*rh, and nieces into vast b called good society. They are accepted people. I began to pay attention to her at little parties, chiefly by .trading near her, or over her, twirfing say moustache. X sac you emue : but there is a tQditionamoogVfajyoong men of Sew York Out a steady pursuit of that system wffl in the end bring down the meet stubborn heiress. I did not go in for heiresses ; Jennie was by no meant of thai variety ; but t fell insensibly to admiring and then to loving her. No one told me that die way to win a girl waste stand over her twirling my moustache; I merely foDowEd the example of some older fellows I used to see. Don't yon know the kind of man who comes into a room in a mousy way ; not timidly mousy — yon know what X mean — bat witii a kind of tremendous quiet consternation, as if to tread hard or speak aland would scare something? . Girls like that kind of thing, especially the young ones ; they think ^snen a man must have seen a great deal of the world. So he has—of Sev Tort They think that when he does speak a win be something very fine— and so it is. Women's imagination win do anything. ' Wen, I practised the moasyway of entering a room, the mysterious manner that waits for iite-a-tat before saying anything, die moustache-twirling business whkh means that no other woman has any charms for tike devotee to that Brahmmical occupation. X soon knew all the patterns of dress that Jennie affected, the different kinds oftrimming, arrangements of her hair, and so on. After a while she began to consult me on such important subjects, and ire became better acquainted. Ton have no idea bow interesting such tilings can become tmder certain circumstances. Soon I was asked to her house, and afterwards a regular visitor. One day when I came in with my monaaat and most coneentzated *w— ~— ? X found George in thff dnwtng-Tcom. ' How are your1 said he, gripping ray hand with * fane that almost made TmTtamt. 'I declare, you eome in so quiet you'd think it was a ghost ! Pact !* ? Poor dear George ! he win say 'air,' do -what Jennie win, bat he is otherwise more changed than yon en think. H there ever was a roagh diamond of a man, it was George Brook, when he ant came to see his little cousin. He was flamed daring that first visit. They are cottsn^ bos so remotely ii''*'—1'*1' that Jennie vowed that she thought it absurd ofliernarenatoxeaamisexms. &e; Grahams lived in a luge bread house in Bond Street, with a. bit of hard furniture put against each wan of the rooms, and certain fearful old portraits hanging abort. There was a piano, on which Jennie played a, little, and a. wide chimBey-place in which they tamed wood. With all its grimneB and bareness, I Eked it better than I do Jennie's little Mc-o-onu shop. In winter it was cold in the front parlour— I shouldn't have called it a drawing room— hut tien that only made you draw up closer to the wood-fire; in tic*, when Jennie was at home, (Jut wag one of its great advantages. 'Well, of course, I saw at ones that tin big immath country lawyer was dreadfully in love with. Bttie Jennie. Ton know what a sweet strauAifurward soul nets — vtia onaht to if you can read faces. Weu, he came to me pretty soon sod asked me plnmply if I was in lave irith Jennie, if sne were sttU free —'Because,' said he, 'I am so in love with her myself that I shall either have to go away or by to win her. A»e you in my way? ' My dear fellow,' eaid I, in pursuance of my role, * we men of the world, yon know, don't fall easily in love. We see so many giris ! IGss Jennie *ttd I are the greatest of friends, bnt nothing more, I assure yon, nothing more. It isn't at all the thing for young men to get engaged nowadays.' George looked at me for* moment, with his month open ; then a flood of delight made ins ugly face handsome for a moment, and he threw his arms about me with a hug that almost broke my ribs. Seeing my disgusted look, he apologised vary humbly, and said— ' Fact is, I didn't suppose it possible anyone could know Cousin Jen a day without bane dead in love irith her.' IGbs Jennie had posnxvdy forbidden him to caD her ?Cousin Jen,' bnt the poor boy always Now, it was a cowardly lie in me to make him such answer— in one sense tt was. Jennie and t were not engaged, bnt we ought to have been. Bat the difficulty was that I felt in do hurry to announce nX whue Jennie posiiivaly refused to consider A an engagement at alL The plain truth is that Jennie at that lime had no more bearttfian a broomstick. There wa& not the faintest snspieion of «~-l-~— or romance or even CTtimrntality about her. She knew a good deal of the ordinary stack of quotable poetry by heart; and occmswraBy made a happy sppnrrlinn of a fine, bother tendency was more to the comic mm the amtiiiHmral. Of coarse I did not think all this at the lame; although ldid euuietuma fed a. sense of RomrtWng lacking in her character. Perhaps I m tn tiLTsame case '^That &e; sport, for I did not dream that Geoige wndb succeed, and I had a rather maficnia enjoymtirf, of Jennie's troubles. She was not goddess, for it had amused her at times to practise the arts of vhkh she was master on Oie quivering nerves of George. Hewassnch abeJpkss victim ; phasare and distress punted themselves so nnmistatably on his face that Jennie eonld not forego the — —nmt of alternately encouraging and repnisme him. ButJem&baa;&Tnmre; anwffioust&mghts; than anyone knew. Tsere were a few men whom she met who wools, have aerrad her purpose, couU she hare held them apinst the tint there were other chances besides those, which might turn up any day. ^Mte were men from other cities, and there warn foreigners ; she was in no hmry to marry, and had a calculating mind, inherited TOBtfuIly from ancestal Grahasss. While stiff youn/ she had heard, ti* dnnk of grid in the talkS her elders as they bat op douaragainst dollar. fiwawatfsns of Grahams ted died in the intensity of rnmnrtahJBy and the firm belief that they wwM he aiisineamnaradkiea pew in the front rank. Jennie dii not think of pews, but she did intend to makes brilliant match. ?Consider, then, the hopelessness of George's suit It was simply lndicroos. Many is the time I have laughed with and laughed at Jennie while canvassing poor George's infatuation, and that is why a slight constraint you have noticed always conies over Jennie in my presence. She is afraid I wfll remind her of lose tames. Gearge was studying law in anomcedown town, and living a life that it is nuldtoeau heroic He acted as office-boy and sweep, besides studying law and doing the minor business of the firm. This was to make more money. Heafao slept in the office in order to escape board bab, and had some arrangement with the janitor's wife to fnmistibim wlti the cheapest kinds of meals. lie knew no one, and passed nnnotirwi into histhreadbare coat At day-break he was up, taking a breather around the squares between Trinity CJjurct ?ad the Post- office, took a glass of milk at a pie-stand, read law till breakfast-time, 'nmaHimg in the way of literature a&erward;, and then began bis day's work. In the evening, as the dock strack eight, he put on an old dress suit he had bought for the graduation exercises at bis up-country college ; by half-pazt eight he was ringing Jennie's beH in Bond-Street, and as nine sounded over the city he closed her door and walked down Broadway to his law-books. That was bis day, with the regularity of clock-work. Eain or shine, Jennie at home or not, the Graham's sunling or frowning, warm or indifferent, it seemed to make no if— -~y» on George. After a few weeks they gave up grumbling over him, and grew secretly to respect and likehnn. OW Graham assisted on askmg bam to the Snndsy dmner.

' Of course George was not able to follow her to Bus wateriug-plaeeE. She felt, in mere anticination, like a bird released, and became so insufferably ntnmmff to me, in con. sequence of her Joy, that I began to think 1 had made a mistake. She was a terribly worldly little thing. I could not hel contrasting tie perfect selfishness of heressv life with the etcssgbs of George. I bad w fear of him as a aval, and adanr£d him as a man. It happened inst then that the chief of the htmse in winch I am stD] a clerk asked my advice abort some nutter tiut involved law business. It was — — -M-i-g cut of OK usual run, which cotdd be managed by other lawyers besides our regular legal advisers, and so I put in a spoke for George.

That'e a rather bitter remark to make aboat Jennie, bnt yoo will see my provocation. To this scene enters George, arrayed— I dont care to tell you how he looked, because Ibke him so thoroughly. Some clothier in Chatham Street had taken the poor soul in ; it wonld have been more charitable rf he had taken in some of the extra cloth of hi gmneute at the same time.
