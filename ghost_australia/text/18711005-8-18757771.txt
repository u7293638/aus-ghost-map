QUILTY - In alluding to the above case, the particulars of which have already been published, the Tumut cor- respondent of the Gundagat Times relates -When the dastardly attempt was made to assassinate Mr Michael Quilty, by firing at him as he stood behind his bar, on the night of the 19th August, it may be remembered that the shot took effect on the left side of his head, a little above the temple The medical attendante called ra (Dis. Lynch and Hector) were afterwards divided ra opinion as to whether the bul- let had lodged in Mr Qmlty's bead or had rebounded, and at that time efforts to find the bullet either ra the patient's head or elsewhere, were unavailing Some few days ago, however, Mr Quilty felt a soreness and pain on the top of his head, which examination proved was most probably caused by the missile that had been fired at him having passed between the scalp and the skull until it lodged there This proved to be the case, for on Monday last Dr. Lynch performed the necessary surgical operation, and with some difficulty extracted a flattened leaden bullet about half-an-rach ra diame- ter, which had been coucal ra shape, weighed 2 dwta. 16 gra, and had apparently been fired from a pistol or email sued revolver Mr Quilty, I understand, suffered no inconvenience from the operation, and may be congratulated on being finally out of danger from the ruffianly attempt on his life to which I have adverted. Solong as the bullet was not found he and his friends must have suffered from an uneasy apprehension that it might have lodged ra some dangerous place, add that raflammation or other serions disorder might resort, but these fears are now set at rest A Mr A.
