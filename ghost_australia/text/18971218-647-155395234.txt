©oofcpibuired SLrMele. BLIND-STEEET CHEISTIANS. By a City Parson. Every one who has pone much through cities knows what a ' blind street' is — one open at one end and closed at the other. If you don't know the locality well, and get into one of these you will have need of patience, as well as some spare time and strength you can afford to waste. You can get in all right, and it may seem to lead in the right direc tion, but it is a complete fraud, to you worse than useless. It reoeives you, appears to serve you, but when you think you were a fortunate man to get j : into it, suddenly surprise, annoyance, ('' and disappointment meet you, in the shape of a big wall, which at once ' -, blights your hopes and stops your progress. As you go back how you wish you had never seen it, and long for some municipal law that would do away with all 'blind streets,' by making every street open at both ends. That would be splendid, good for both body and soul ; a real public benefit. There is no complaint about the appearance of the street or its position, but you don't like it because its all take and no give. )' Its about as selfish as matter can be. /.' It helps none but its own. Of public Iv spirit it has none. Those who know it 'l i shun it, those who trust it repent. K j Some people who call themselves f ! Christians, are. -like that' street; , They ( I ^it^^iot^Mci^jus^&flf;^hafc^God neverr-li&\- - — - such a selfish thing, but they have built ,^ a wall with their own hands, to their own shame and injury, and the annoyance \ and loss of their neighbours. They ap pear to be useful, but when you test them you find that the end of their appear ance is ' the bridge agin their own door.' Wherever there is anything ta be gained in Church or social gathering , they are there. I heir motto is: ''Where i ,' \ can I get most?'' Such a thought never ' ! troubles them as that the blessings of ' the Gospel are intended to help others . , . \j through them. A body 'fitly joined ] together and compacted by that which ii every joint supplieth, according to the '); effectual working in the measure of \ every part,' is an idea of Church life. j j they gave up long ago. It was just I about the time they built the wall across , \ the street to stop the outflow of gifts of I ,' the Holy Ghost through their labours. |j of love. They go now where they 'can/ , J get most good,' not where they can | receive the most assistance to help il, others. Psalm 100 is their favorite now. j k To browse in the good pastures is about- I (, all they are good for, and yet, spiritually,. \ they are like Pharaoh's lean kine. As. . \l a barren fig tree in the garden of the' i j. Lord, so live they in the Church. Q' . ,'? that our Church members would get 'i' away from the idea that the ultima thvle - | of God's grace to them is m themselves. ' }) Let them break down the wall that ,h' would stop the grace of God flowing on to others ; and learn the lesson — though f in some cases it may be late — that it is ,«' !i more blessed, more Christian, more \\\x Christlike to give than to receive ; that j . we are nob the owners, but 'stewards \ ;J of the manifold grace of God.' Then, \ I'-i instead of disappointing hopes and be- H|j lieing appearances, we shall be a Lu strength in the Church, helpers in the [| community, and a praise in the earth. |, From being 'Blind-street Christians' s£, good Lord deliver us I - \ J
