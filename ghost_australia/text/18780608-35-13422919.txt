Ely to come to them by a vessel called the Oceanus supposed to have left lBkao at the end 04 June that they had received no particulars from the air now and that they did not know if the cargo was insured in fact no 61 not, but they tv Shed to be covered in rise the cargo was not insured , I thought it was unfair to refuse to ox end the policy which had been sent up to cover a spp ills cargo of sugar-, and to refuse to accept declarations simply because they t ere unable through the absence of advice to make their declaration under the policy, though the cargo might be shipped prior to that date he (Park) refused to extend the policy, no reason was then given except that he was " full of Cowlishaw's," he did not mention anything about the time the vessel was out he simply said the policy had lapsed, and he would not take it up again, I then consulted Captain Fox is to what his company would do under similar circumstances I put a supposed case to him without using; names, the amount of the premium would not be altered by putting in a longer period for making declarations, Captain Fox said that he did not remember ever having such a case, but if everything; was bona-fide, in Captain Fox's opinion, he would extend the policy, I then saw Captain Pockley, and he, after hearing the circumstances, thought Mr Park ought today e-steaa-Jithj*pojjey a itiftV»e*iueatly **.-epeta«J_ that he did not understand the circumstances, I again went to Mr. Bath's office, I told him that Captain Fox and Captain Pockley thought that, under the" circumstances, the policy ought to be extended ; Captain Pockley then came in some queer non arose, and he said that he did not in let stand that the declaration was to be in time on the 31st July, for if so Park was not bound to accept a declaration, nothing more aims said, I had not up to that time accepted may ask, ho (Park) did not say any thing about the vessel being only three days out, I had consulted Captain PccUex , had I in was that of a x vessel was out a net) -three days I \ (raid not have at copied the risk, Mr Park did not at either of those sensations mention Fifty-three I was, or say that shows an overdue ship, if Mr Park had known, or I husband, that the vesSel was out ninety- two days, Cowlishaw, Brothers, must have known it to agents of the vessel and if they knew that she Jims ninety-three days out, I would have refused the risk, I have another Ka son arising out of a subsequent conversation with Mr Park, he and that "the Kellys had been to him to get all the information they could from him, that they (the Rojioxs) had not a ghost of a chance to win this case, but mark you' if they had re fined to accept the declaration, he did not think I could compel them to pay and his (PnrS's) reason for refusing: to attend the policy, was that he had heard that there had been a. typhoon about that time but I did not tell you that " J Cross-examined That last conversation was since this action was commenced , Mr Fariid d not dot down on his blotting and the number of days the vessel was out, I had dealings with both Cowlishaw's I never had the bills dray n h the Cowlishaw against the cargo, X

all I inn certain of is, that he said he was able to declare, I understood the tinionBinkxvns named as the one through which the in we cs, Ac , had come, I do not know that a subpoena has been issued for the production of these hills , I cannot tell when the alteration was made in the margin of the policy chancing 3ft July to 31st December, it was Bindo by Nil Webb, he has initialled it, during August and September I frequently saw the Cowl shows, and often asked them if there was any news of the Oceanus, I can not that I never asked them in those months, I thought that I was linked about the silos quiet months, in September was the first time I had any counter action about the Oceanus, they paid the supposed she had sailed in the end of June, I did not mix self make any lnqtiulcsns to when she smiled, I think it was Mr Fletcher, chief clerk of Messrs Cowlishaw who was sent to the bank to inquire under what policy the cargo per Oceanus was married, I was not told by 'the Cowlishaw's that on the 10th Jill) that they had accepted bills on the EULO , I saw C IP inlet about the 11th September, I did not know then about the bills, At I did not tell Mr Park in St plomber that the

and saw his clerk,., Mr Thompson, who took down what I told him, and said lov- odd confer with Mr Park, I told him what Mr Smith had said to me (a Unless again detailed the conversation, I did not go back, I believe Mr bnnthdtd then went to 'Wilshire's once, I saw Mr Wilshire, I told him that Mr Smith had said to me, and order to what I told Mr Thompson, Wilshire accepted the risk, thence I went to Mr. Levien's, and saw Mr Malcolm the chief clerk, I and that we wanted the policy extended to cover sb parents to 31st December, stating who believed a shipment would come by a vessel called the

instructed to go round and get the re insurances, I went to all that day I know then that the probability was that the vessel would be the Oceanus, supposed to have sailed in the end of June, I was from fifteen minutes to half an-hour in Robey's office I then know that Mr Park had refused to extend his policy, I carried out the reinsurances with Mr Lovick and Mr Wilshire, and entirely with the Robes, the original policy had lapsed I had returned the re- insurance policies in consequent of of Mr AY shire asking me if then of w will be a declaration, I said, "no," and I returned the police on or after the first July on the 20th June 1877, I wrote, "Nonsk will attach under this cover," that is what we referred to in Mr Smith's letter; I saw Mr Charles Robey and discussed the matter with him, only Horace Robey was present when he signed, I left the declaration on the 22nd October with one of the Robes, I am positive as to the day, and believe I delivered it to Charles Robey, and", equally positive that I tonic the, declaration to Mr. Wilshire and to Mr. Lovick, all on the same day, I can't say where or when Mr. Lovick signed the cover -slip I can't say whether or not Lovick had signed when I took the slip to the Robes, I have no notion how or when Mr. Loxicl.'s signature got to the cover-slip, I believe that Rev etc came into his office just as I was leaving, I believoLoxtcVs name was there when I went to the office of Messrs Robey Re-opened The Maid of Judah arrived without a cargo for the Cowlishaw's, and it was thought that no declaration would be made on the policy as it had been taken out to co of the cargo by the Maid of Judah , I wrote fully about my knowledge of the matter to Mr. Smith, from Nelson, on the 21st and 15th December, the matter was then quite fresh in my memory [The letters were leaders 1, and being objected to were not admitted ] R F' Pockley, marine surveyor for innnyinsurmcocom pianos I remember Mr Smith asking about the probable length of voyage from Takao, before that I saw Mr. Smith at Mr 1 ark's ofDco, I came in during the conversation Sir Park asked me if I had advised Mr Smith that I he (Mr Park) was bound to accept a declaration under a policy, I send you Pmh said notwithstanding that the jolley expressly sail the declaration had to be made on or before a pair i dear date, I do not recollect the date, I

be over due till she was one hundred days out, it would depend on the season of the year, and other matters the average of those persons with chave come is about eighty-five days John Malcolm, chief clerk in Mr. Jack's office I act for him in his absence , I know Mr Webb, and remember him coming to the office in September last, he asked if Mr Bench would have any objection to take out another

I don't knawxvhen, Mr Lovick did not come in while Mr Webb x is there , I mentioned the Helena, and used it the policy would attach to her, if so, we would have nothing to do with it, as she was an overdue ship, he said it would not be the Iteltna, but it most probably would be a vessel named the Oceanus, I did not know what incribmJiäO it was that were insuring, the Helena, through considered in of erdue ship, afterwards turned up Cross-e-uicmicd I do not remember that he mentioned The number of dresser had been out, my recollection is that he said that they had services, and that the
