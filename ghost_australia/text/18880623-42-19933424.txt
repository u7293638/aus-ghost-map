CHILDREN'S CORNER The Lifeboat of Dieppe. [WRITTEN FOR THE QUEENSLANDER.] MARY HANNAY FOOTT. "Peace hath her victories, no less than war." A foggy day in the Dover Strait, Two ships on the misty main; A crash—then a pitiful pitiful cry From the shattered sinking twain. One boat alone—from the davits cut By a fair haired boy—swung free Of the whirlpool that sucked the swimmers down, And awhile she stood to sea. Then swift, ere the surge had ceased to swell O'er the good ships gulfed below, She sped to the help of the perishing As fast as the boy could row. Ebb-tide at morn on the coast of France; Like a mill-race the Channel ran; And there gazed to seaward from gay Dieppe A gray-haired fisherman. "A boat!" he shouted; "an English boat ! Look, look ! She is swept to sea- Loaded down to the water's edge- Haste, haste to her help with me!" They rallied round him, a gallant crew, And the ready lifeboat bore; But the good old mayor stayed their march— '"Twere vain on yon sea-less shore. " One way I wot of: The docks are full Though the harbour rocks lie bare; I will open the floodgates for her, men— Will you launch the lifeboat there ? " I give no order. You know the risk, But the boat may live." And then He gazed on their faces and they on his While one might, perhaps, count ten. Then, with never a word, they ran the boat To the great dock's tideless brim, And they sprang to their places and grasped their oars, And the shore and the sky grew dim. For the sweep of a torrent bore them now With a force that none might stay, Away from the watchers that lined the pier— From the harbour-bounds away; Out, out to the Channel. And there, afar, Were those they had vowed to save— Oarless and spent, on the racing tide That sped to the Western wave. Soon, soon—the ghost of an English cheer— Embrace as of brothors born! 'Twas told in Paris that selfsame night, In London at early morn.
