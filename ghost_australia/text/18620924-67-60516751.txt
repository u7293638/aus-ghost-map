THE GIRL I LEFT BEHIND ME. [NEW WORDS TO AN OLD AIR.] With sweet regret the dearest ghost that yesterday has left us, We often turn our homeless eyes to scenes whence fate has reft us. Here sitting by a fading flame, wild waifs of song remind me Of Annie with her gentle ways, the Girl I left behind me. I stood beside the surging sea, with lips of silent passion, I faced you by the surging sea, O brows of mild repression! I never said--"my darling, stay!" the moments seemed to bind me To something stifling all my words for the Girl I left behind me. The pathos worn by common things--by every wayside flower, Or autumn leaf on lonely winds revives the parting hour. Ye swooning thoughts that had no voice, ye tears which rose to blind me, Why did she fade into the dark, the Girl I left behind me? At night they always come to me, the tender and truehearted; And in my dreams we join again the hands which now are parted; And, looking through the gates of Sleep, the pleasant Moon doth find me For ever wandering with my Love, tho Girl I left behind me. You know my life is incomplete, O far-off faint Ideal! When shall I reach you from a depth of darkness which is real! So I may mingle, soul in soul, with her that heaven asigned me; So she may lean upon my love, the Girl I left behind me. HENRY KENDALL.
