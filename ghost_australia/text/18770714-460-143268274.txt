ORIGINAL POETRY. UNTIL DEATH. By F. A. Westbubt. Make me no vows of constancy, dear friend To love me though I die, thy whole lite long, And love: no other till tby days Shall end ;— Nay—it were rash and wrong. If thou canBt love another, be it so; I would not reach out ot my quiet grave To bind thy heart, if it should choose to go. Love shall not be a slave. My placid ghost, I trust, will walk serene In clearer light than gilds these earthly morns, Above the jealousies and envies keen Which bow this life with thorns. Thou wouldet not feel my shadowy caress, If, alter death, my soul should linger here; Men's hearts crave tangible, close tenderness, Love's presence warm and near. It would not make me sleep more peacefully That thou wert waiting all thy life in woe For my poor sake ; what love thou hast for me Bestow it ere I go. Carve not upon a stone when I am dead The praises which remorseful mourners give To women's grace—a tardy recompense— But speak them while I live. Heap not the heavy marble on my head, To snut away the Bunshine and the dew; Let small blooms grow there, and the grasses wave, And raindrops filter through. Thou wilt meet many fairer and more gay Tban I, hut trust me, thou canst never find One who will love and serve thee, night and day, With a more single mind. Forget me when I die; the violets above my rest will blossom Just as b'ue, Nor misB thy tears; ev'n Nature's se.t fosgets ; But while X live be true. Melbourne, June 1.
