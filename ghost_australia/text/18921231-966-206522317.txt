"HOW SHALL WE DECIDE THIS QUESTION ?' Jfotr, which is the worse—io have no appetilefor yovr dinner, or to have no dinner for your appetite i There are lots of people on the one side or the other of this question. When "good digestion waits on appetite and health on both," that is the ideal attitude of a person towards his meals. But moat of us are not blessed in that way; we either have too much 'ood without an appetite, or a vigorous appetite without enough to satisfy it. Different folk will answer this question differently, yet the common sense of it is that, within reasonable limits, it is better to have an appetite without a dinner, because, short of the starvation line, a hungry man is a healthy man; whereas a man who ought to eat and doesn't feel like eating, stands in need of "alterations and repairs." To illustrate. We recently received a communication in which the writer says, "I was afraid to eat." Did bo fancy his food was poisoned, or did bis nature rebel against the nourishment lived on? If the latter, why*; Let him clear the mystery himself. He says, " In the year 1889 I changed my work from railway porter to signalman. I had been signalman twelve months, and then all at once, so to speak, I did not feel mysel c . My mouth tasted bad, so that ordinary articles of diet seemed to lose their flavour; the palate to put it in that way, appeared to have nothing to say to them. One thing was like another, and none was good. My tongue was coated and furred, with a dark line down the middle and yellow fur round it. My breath was offensive and my appetite poor, with pains through tbe chest and shoulders, which were always right before I had eaten anything. Then I ,wss greatly troubled with wind. It would gather so it felt like a ball in my throat, and act as if it would choke me." We cannot wonder that under those circumstances our friend failed to do justice to his meals. He adds that there was what he call* " a pricking sensation" at his heart, as though it were touched with some sharp instrument Then, again, at times he wa9 attacked with spasms, the agony of which was so severe that the sweat rolled off him. "I dreaded," he sayp, "the thought of eating, and many a scanty meal have I made, for I was ajraid to cat. " After a time I got into a low, weak, nervous condition, and felt miserable, as if something was going to happen, and this caused mo to ose a good deal of sleep." What he means by the fear of " something going to happen" is, of course, the fear of seme calamity, such as the loss of his position, his own death, or the death of Bomebody dear to him. This was due, as ho intimates, to the impoverished state of his blood (the life bearer), his unstrung nerves, and to the brain enfeebled by lack of nourishment. Tbe night to thia form of illness is always full of ghosts and goblins, the creatures of a restless and ungoverned imagination. "»With great difficulty," he says, " I stuck to my work, for I had a wife and family depending on me. So I struggled on, but what I suffered for over two years is past my powers of description. I am sure no one has suffered so much as I have done." Tn the latter statement he is undoubtedly wrong. One's own pain is one's own, and is always harder to bear than is one's notion of his neighbour's pain. There is a countless multitude who are all the while going through the same wretched experience, only we don't happen to come in touch with th6m. Well, the writer finally mentions that after all medical treatment had left him where it 'ound him he chanced to read in a book of a case exactly like his oini having been cured by Mother Seigel's Syrup. " My wife," he says, -< got me a bottle at Mr. LangBtaff's, in Woodlesford, and after using itB contents the ailmenleft me and has never returned sinoe that fortunate day. I should like the whole world to know what it did for me. I have been employed by the Midland Railway Company for eleven years. (Signed) " GEOBCE Hciir, " Car Bottom-road.
