GENERAL NEWS. SHOCK OF AN EARTHQUAKE -On the 7th of this month there waa a great shock of an earthquake felt between the Little River and Narrengullen at about 10 o'clock in the day. It was heard by nearly one hundred people who reside within a distance of 20 miles. There were two persons erecting a log fence near the Little River, and while in the act of drawing a log, they heard a great rumbling noise, during which the log appeared to rebound from the earth. Tho men could scarcely keep on their feet, and the hills appeared to shake. This sensation lasted for fully one minute, when there was a great report as if several cannons were discnarged at the one time. In the houses in the locality where this shock was felt, the furniture and orockeryware shook in their places. This report can be borne out by numbers of persons about Narrengullen and the Little River - Yass Courier, May 24.

The poor confiding bird fancier was caug it, and was actually on board the boat «lth his two stranger friends, when a lad ap peared, and said " Mr --, the captain says that I may go with you " The snb officer had of eour£0, no objection, hut the p*rty who had arranged the little excursion did not seem to care about taking the boy up with them, and sud denly recollcoted that as he river ohannel was long and winding, it might perhaps be safer for them all to go up by da} light {je would come for the bird fancier, accordingly, early on the fol- lowing morning Strange to say the ,r friend" and his

rollers, aud completely out oS just below the elbow, by the rapidly revolving knives It appears that Mr Walsh had turned to speak to an assistant, and did not notice how near bis hand was to the rollers The driver, peroeiving the aooident, stopped the machine as soon as practicable, and the sufferer (who nad not uitered a word) was extricated Mr Walsh placed his hand over the stump of the mutilated limb to stop the bleeding, requested that a sur- geon be sent for, and walked into the store Drs Beosop and Byrne were soon in attendance An examination of the portion of the limb cot off

that the driving belt had worn slack, and thus slipped round on the pulley, when the increased strain was felt, nothing oiuld have saved his ai m Immediately the accident happened the engineer Btopped

It «as evident from the appearance of the wounds that he had been dragged some distance by the horse after he had been thrown The man's name is unknown, but he is apparently a bush- man, and he bought the horse, which is a youDg animal, a few days ago at Kent's Bazaar. Queenslander, Mag 25. CHABQE OF RIGGING THE SHARE MARKET. -Tho investigation of the oharge of conspiraoy preferred by J" W Dunkley against Henry Read, Hugh A Egerton, and Lcms Barnard, was eoncluded in the Melbourne Criminal Court yesterday The information filed against the defendants was for conspiring by fictitious sales of stock in the Golden Sovereign Extended Company to raise the prioe of that stock, with intent to defraud Dunkley alleged that ficti tious sales of large quantities of the stock had been made in his presence that the defendants were jointly concerned in the sales, and that be- lieving the sales to be genuine, he bought 10,000 shares at a price largely in exoe*s of their actual worth in a fair market The de- fence was a denial of any concert between the parties, and an assertion that defendants had only done what was a matter of daily practice under the Verandah If the defendants had represented that the mine was paying several ounces to the ton when it was not crushing a pennyweight to the ton, of course they would be guilty of false pretenoes, but it was con- tended that these sales did not make them amenable to the criminal law The jury, after deliberating an hour and a half, acquitted all the defendants -Argus, Hag 22
