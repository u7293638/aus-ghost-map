Hence it was considered 7 'greater crime at Athens tp leave a parent unhurried than to allow him to starve .to. death. Andthat beautiful play ^of Sophocles, in which Antigone suffers death rather than leuve. .her brother's ^"corpse unfcrarriod, had*a far greater charm iii Pagan >Athen's than it can-'have lin g Christian England. But we are digressing. Here is:the promised story; from the .:itwenty-sevjenth .epistle of .the'seventh book of plioy the. younger7 : r ! (There.wa8 at Athens, a house, largeand spacious, but with a bad name. In thb > jj fUence of the night, there wa^lwpnt'to bjB heard in it the .rattling of iron, an3, if ii;-ypu listened more attentively,; the: plash _,of chains, first at a distance then hard-by. Presently there appeared a ghost-an old man, lean and squalid, with long heard and rough hair. He- carried fetters on his legs arid gj ves on his wrists, .shaking them as he walk'e'd. Hence'every night was iperit in wakeful terror by the inha bitants. Sickness* followed vigils, and death sickness. For even "during the day fcimev though . the phantom had de parted, 'the recollection of it clung to them, and tlie? terror lasted, longer than 'that? which,caused it. ..Accordingly, the :t house: was .deserted, condemned to soli tudej.andi.entirely.given .up to Jthe spectre. It'was ^a^yertiscd, nevertheless, to be let . ~or-soldy in-case any one, not knowing the .. .circumstances, should be - wining to, pur ^:chas6. "V.'"1 ; " Ath(Bnod6rus,' the philosopher," came to, Athens, read the notice, asked the terms, and, having his suspicions roused by the low price, made enquiries, and heard the .whole story. So far from shrinking, he took the house'all'the.more eagerly.T When evening drew near, Ee:orders his couch to be placed in the front room, call's awwritingrtablet, af style, and a light* dismisses All his attendants,.and devotes: his attentions-eyes, head, and hands-to ?writing, 'lest his'mind, being ^unemployed, should conjure: up : fancied sights and sounds. ?? - I; At first- there was the silence of night, deep as elsewhere; then the clash of iron and the rattling of chains.: He neither raised his eyes nor relaxed his style, but fixed his attention. upon:-his, work. The clink grew louder, , came ?; nearer^ Land sounded now; at the door now within the room. He looks up, sees and recognised the spectre- .described..,, It .,' stood and beckoued; with-its' hand, «is? rf calling him. He made a sign-with .his . finger , ;for it to wait a little, and again settled'down to his tablets and style. It rattledvits chains at his head as be wrote. He looked up again making the,same sign as before, and with out further delay took the candle and followed, fit walked with slow step, as if weighted-with:the chains.: After turning into the courtyard of the house, it suddenly slipped into - the. earthi arid, disappeared. :He; piled;sorae weeds and leaves to .mark the spot, and, the next day,; going to the Magistrates; advised them to order! the place to. be ;excavated. ; A skeleton' was found, the flesh all .wasted away by. putre faction, and.the bare bones bound in.fetters and chain. It was taken lip and 'publicly buried, a -.d after "that the' bouse" was no more troubled. * . ^ - , :
