THE AGRICULTURAL SOCIETY. We copy the following from this morn ing's Gazette. We consider that the Se cretaries of the Agricultural Society or the Stewards of. the intended dinner, were bound, if it were only outof respect to their intended distinguished guest, to have sent the intelligence to every Journal in the Colony But so long as a political faction, and private pique, govern the proceedings of this Society and the Chamber of Com merce, they cannot be. popular, nor can their prosperity be more than comparative. Both of them nearly gave up the ghost the other day ; and now that the presence of a new Governor and a new order of things has re-animated the Agricultural Society, its officers still indulge in that littleness of mind which induced Messrs. Berry & Wolstonecraft, and the echoesand sponges of Mr. M'Leay, to blackball Mr. Wentworth, who, whether he be consi dered as a landholder, a patriot, or a man of. talent, forms in his character a perfect contrast to the dullness and vulgarity of birth and breeding of those who black balled him. Many persons of respectabi lity were, deterred from . strengthen ing and supporting the Agricultural So ciety when on its last legs, because they knew that it contained within it an Im perium Imiperio faction, who would take delight in insilting them in the ballot.
