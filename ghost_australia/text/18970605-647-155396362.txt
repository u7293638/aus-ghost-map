GETTING POWER. Dr. J. Wilbur Chapman tells how he had in his parish a young Irishman ; all would declare him to be ignorant, and he was; but God marvellously used him. This was the secret, in the evangelist's words : — With a heart burdened for the men of the city, I called together a few of the men of the church, and laving before them the plan I had in mind, told them first of all that we could do nothing without the ' infilling of the Holy Ghost.' When this had been explained, I noticed this man leave tho room. He did not return while the meeting was in session. When I sought him I found him in one of the lower rooms of the church, literally on his face beiore God. He was in prayer. I shall never forget his petition: '0, God, I plead with thee for this blessing ;' then, as if God were showing him what was in the way, he said : ' My Father, I will give up every known sin, only I plead with thee for power ;' and then, as if his individual sins were passing before him, he said again and again, 'I will give them up.' Then, without any emotion, he rose from his knees, turned his face heavenward, and simply said : ' And now I claim the blessing.' For the first time he became sensible of my presence, and with a shining counten ance he reached out his hands to clasp mine. You could feel the very presence of the Spirit as he said, ' I have received Him ; I have received Him.' And I be lieve he had, for in the next few months he had led more than sixty men into the king dom of God. His whole life had been transformed. He is just now being set apart to preach the Gospel; — Golden Rule.
