He had accepted that, had gone away sick and came baek well. He was better physically and in other ways for their generous treatment of him. Looking back to liis work during the three years, there wore some things to regret, but none to apologise for. He may have committed errors of judgment, his zeal may have flagged a little ; he may have been sometimes misunderstood, but though his method may have been faulty his inten- tions had always been good, and now he could feel that in going away it was not because they had been tired of one another, or were dissatisfied with one another but because the law of the church was inevitable, and he believed uual terable. During the three years he had done 30mo things. It had been pointed out that the building presented a different appearance than it did three years ago, and he had been paid the enormous com- pliment of being likened to Nehomiali, which he did not deserve ¡ but he did thank them for work- ing with him in renovating that church. He might even use a stronger word, as the secretary of the Sustentation Society had saidbefore Conference thal it had been regenerated. The lighting had not been improved, but that was not their fault but rather that of the Municipal Council for the delay iu es- tablishing gas works. The necessary means for introducing the gas wore he believed ready, and it would be one of the first places to introduce it, when obtainable. Spiritual results ii was impossible to tabulate-they could not all be reckoned up, but he had before his mental vision a list of about 100 names who had been spiritually improved. Some had been enrolled in that church and some in country places. Some were excellent young men who would bo pillars in the church when the old ones were gone to their rest. Some were young women whs would adorn their Christian profession 1} then Godly living mil Chi ist i m life Sum lud gone to otho places, and a good mail} had not le ni mied faithful to then vow of
