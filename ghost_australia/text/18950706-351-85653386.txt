DRESS-REFORM.. . ' The Prussian Government is seriously con sidering tho advisability of issuing a decree forbidding women to wear trains on the public proinonades. It is claimed that those street-sweeping appendages stir np tho dust and scatter far and wide the i gornis of disease, with whioh it is alleged to be filled.''; -The police of Moran, tho fashionable watering plaoe in the Tyrol, recently made such an order, with the result that the bacteria cranks and dress-reform faddists in several localities are calling for its imitation. The Prussian jHouse of Deputies enjoys the distinction of boing tho only legislative body to drop minor : subjects, suoh as tho budget, agricultural depression , otc. , and to take up Hub momontous \ ono of tho wearmg of trains by womon. From boginning to end, the Teutonic states- ; men treated the subjeot .with great Borious- . ness, and not bo much as the ghost of a; joko, marred the debato. Soon wo expect to hear ! from somo learned crank that baotoria: lodgo in the hair, and that both males and: fomales should be compelled by law to keop their heads shaved. . '
