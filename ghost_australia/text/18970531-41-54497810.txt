A few of the laifer came from ii.elbau.rna by the express ?-raish left on Friday afternoon, bat through a. dcliy they did not arrive in Adelaide until -Iirte hours late, with ths result that they did not reach the course in time for the Srst event. Ihi racing on. Saturday was perhaps the iaa=: interesting of the three days, the fields 'ciL-iag- e^cjptionally good. It was not, how ever, devoid of accident In the Hurdle S.vjo CZ, Nita, and -Facie Sprat all came to cri'ii half a milo from home, and Hovrie, who was on 'UZ, fell with such force that he rujeived a severe coacu=sion, and was still Tmc-unacious ou Suiiday night.

Mr. H. W. V;:rie-', ic presenting tiie Cup, said that the c^t v.-:is only one instance of many of the £':iitrroi« nature of Aldenaaa Ivitfaer, a citizen of whom they bad tvery reason to be prond. Mr. Kither vni away on a trin to England, hut it would Sj«s gratifying to bin to iind that his Cup had ooen won by a gentleman who euioyed th-r reputation ot bei&g; u true sports man in evt-ry oonsst of the word. They were p!eas'_*d to welcome Mr. ijairmel from Viccaria, and cougratuI&Led; him on having arhis'-tJ success, kvhu chough is came on the :;i=t, day of the meeting, lie hoped thac he v.'.:;;id visit £o-uU Australia again.
