The Beltaka has not changed her rig, and is quite as smart-looking as ever she -was, notwithstanding her passage was very much lengthened by a collision in tie Channel. She left London oa 'April 1. and a ?westerly wind obliged her to beat down till she got to the southward of the Eddystene. where she fell foul of a barque and knocked away her fore and main masts, at the same time carrying away her own jib boom, bowsprit, and head sear.' The figurehead and cutwater were gone, and the Beltana had sustained such damage that she was obliced to put into Ply mouth for repair. Portion of' the cargo was dis charged, and after a thorough reut she made sail again on 3Iay 1(5. After clearing the land fine weather was experienced ; indeed t'ue whole distance to the line was very nne. She crossed on June 15, in 27*15', and then had a breeze from the south ward, which gave place to trades, but they proved of very little use, though southward also, and thus the vessel was driven well over to the coast cf America. After passing the Cape in 43=, strong winds prevailed during the whole distance froui St. Paul's to Cape Leu win, [but on working up for Cape Borcla the wind came ahead and continned so until sighting the light on the 5th. Tiie JBeltana has,a lot of gunpowder as part of her cargo, and in consequence will be detained at the Xorth Arm for its disefcarge. The.: IsvjEri-auxd showed from the . stations at *ariy dawn ch Thursday, and was shortly afterwards boarded. Captain Phillips reports leaving London at 3 a.m. on May 1& The vessel had a couple of tugs in attendance, and was taken to the powder ground at Gravesend, where she received 25 tons of it on board. Next day the services of one tug were dis pensed with, and at Deal the pilot was discharged. The wind being strong from the westward the master engaged to be towed as far as Dungeness, where the steamer was cast off, and all sail made on the ship. During the night the wind hauled to the northward, and at noon on the 20th the Channel pilot was dis charged off the Start, whence final departure was taken with the wind light at north-east, and it con tinued so till May 26. During this time the vessel averaged about 120 miles a day. Afterwards the wind shifted to W.S.W. and S.W., but continued very light till sighting the Isle of Palma on June 4. The light wind prevailed most vexatiously during the north east trades, and in consequence the prospect of a rapid passage was entirely dispelled, although there was a chance on June 17, when there came away a brisk breeze which took the vessel through the variables and across the Line in 20° W. On June 26 the trades were lost, after blowing so briskly for a time that the vessel was dragging a press of sail with but whole topsails set in order to claw off the land. On July 4 she sighted and passed to leeward of Tristan d'Acunha; so close was the vessel that objects on shore were distinctly visible, but no boat appeared, so the vessel kept on her track, and on July 7 crossed the prime meridian, having a north-east wind and smooth sea which rendered progress both speedy and pleasant. On the 10th she overhauled and passed the ship Macduff, bound to Melbourne, all well. Both vessels had t&ken; in powder at the same time, but the Macduff had made a reach ahead by taking the passage inside the Cape de Verde Islands. On July 11 she was on the meridian of the Cape in iO?/ S. but from then until the 23rd extremely slow progress was made, and during eight days the vessel made but 840 miles. This was a very astonishing circumstance taking the season of the year into consideration ; but when the weather changed and a breeze set in the vessel made a day or two's good work, and on July 27 was off St. Paul's. On August 3, in 40 ° S. she passed CapeLeuwin. but had very iight winds thence to Cape Borda, which was passed on the Sth, and on the morning of the 9th the ship was boarded at the Sema phore. She was towed to the North Arm for discharge of her powder, and on Friday will be moored in harbour. &The; Greyhound, brig, was towed out on Thurs day and at once made sail, but the wind was so very light that she made but little progress.

The E.M.S. China had rather a rough passage from Melbourne, which port she left on Tuesday, August. 7, at 2.30 p.m., arriving at Glenelg at 9.30 p.m. on the 9th. Until she neared Cape Willoughby she had moderate weather, but the wind gradually increased, and soon blew a gale from the N.W., with a heavy sea, the vessel going almost bow3 under at times. A dense fog was then fallen in with, which obscured the land. She passed Cape Jervis at 4.15 and her signal was answered by the station. The Fairy had rather a long cruise to reach her as she came to an anchor fully a mile and a half outside the hulk. The mailbags were put on board and the Eleanor went alongside with cargo. There was little wind and less sea. The China brought only two passengers for Glenelg. Among her passengers are 21 Affghans, who had come round in the Flinders from Port Augusta, having been on the Hon. T. Elder's Beltana Station. They are bound for India. The China left early this morning. The South Australian was boarded by the Fairy at 8.45 on Thursday morning, and the mails and pas sengers were landed in time for the 9.30 train. There was a heavy sea fog and it was impossible to see the length of the jetty. She had scarcely discharged her passengers to the deck of the Fairy, and the parting cheers of the football team been answered by her steam whistle, when land and ocean were alikp enveloped in a fog which for density and duration has not often been equalled at G^--*S- A chilly north-easterly wind drove the h«iof vapour before it like a wall, completely »aveloping the Melbourne steamer, the sound of ~er f°g signals alone indicating her whereabout' -j she headed away over the fishing grounds to :Jake an offing on her course to the Sema phore -During the entire morning the jetty was ohioored, the boats close inshore looming like ghosts through the mist, and it was not until past 1 p.m. that the gauzy veii was withdrawn as quickly as it fell, disclosing the steamer Flinders close to Glenelg. She had come down quite unperceived to place some Affghan passengers on board the hulk, there to await the arrival of the China. The remainder of the after noon and evening was perfectly fine, but long after the Bay rejoiced in brilliant sunshine the bank could be seen drifting away to the southward until it disap peared altogether on the horizon.
