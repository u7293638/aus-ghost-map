THE LATE MRS. JAMES SHILLING. On Sunday, September 13, a memorial service was conducted in the Lewishacn Wesleyan Church, to improve the death of Mary Louisa Shilling, who died on September 5, aged 79 years. Mrs. Shilling was the oldest member of the church at Lewisham. Her name stood No. 3 on the church-roll; and it was in her house that the first class meeting was held in the neighbourhood. With her husband she was for a long time honourably connected with our church in. the Chippendale circuit prior to their removal to Lewisham;. and for the long period of 35 years she walked daily in the fear of God and in the comfort of the Holy Ghost. She was a kind, generous, self-sacrificing woman ; a fond mother, a faithful wife, and a cheerful and consistent Christian. Her end was peace : 'A glow in the western sky, And glad at last, That day is past, In light God's children die. J.E.C.
