The Foreman's Ghost. :?:: AN alarming development of ghostly enterprise is reported from the Ana conda Copper Mine. A spectre has appeared in the lower levels of the mine, where his presence is proving as great an obstruction to business as a visitation of fire damp. The miners declare that it is the spirit of their late foreman, basing their conjecture upon the ghost's familiarity with his new quarters. However this may be, the works are virtually at a standstill, owing to the alarm oreated by his pre sence; and the position is becoming so oritical that the company may find it necessary, as a last resource, to offer a large reward to anybody who will rid their property of the ghostly tres passer.
