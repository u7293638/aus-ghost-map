The Melbourne Hunt Club, after a pleasant and prosperous season, hold their annual race meeting at Flemington to-day. The weather was fine, and consequently there was a large attendance.

In the first instance it was won by Nimbook, with Syphon second, and Actress third ; the betting being 6 to 4 agst Syphon, and 3 to 1 agst Nimbook. The race between these two horses was a good one, and at its conclusion a protest was lodged, on the ground that both horses missed the last fence.
