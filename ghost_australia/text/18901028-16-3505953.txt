AT OLD COUNTRY NOTES. (FROM OUR OWN CORRESPONDENT.) Lonpok, September 19. Since my last letter we have had the moral lessons of three conferences to discuss Of the British Association no more need be said Not much at all of the Vegetarian Congress which sat in London By the aid of the eloquence of some American visitors the latter got through their sittings without dulness to themselves, but none of the members pretend to believe that many converts have been made Indeed the vegetarians have a very uphill fight, and we no longer have any Crystal Palace demon stations, such as that which led Punch many years ago to present the cartoon of a couple of gentlemen, one of whom, holding on to a lamp post, says, " I say, old flor I'll stand another lettuce " The three or four vegetarian les currants that are kept going in London pay, I believe but the Britisher will, as a rule, have his meat when he can get it I have tried them all, and during teeth troubles would have welcomed any sort of food that would not won by the pool grinders Perhaps in this, as in other matters, I am in the gall of bitterness, for my conclusion was that more nasty messes than most of the vegetarian dishes could not be served up Rice in any form is respectable, but cabbage scuffles and broad bean fatters were not The latest idea is that we ought to live on nuts, and never took any fruit, but eat it fresh to the tune of three pounds avoirdupois per diem, besides other things, including from a quarter to half a pound of nuts or almonds It is even proposed to cut us off from bread This last pro- position has fetched the lady manager of a bread reform association, who winds up a touching appeal with the words " The real staff of life, whose claim to honour is founded on the experience of ages, and confirmed by science, whose use is sanctified by the prayers of millions, and consecrated as the highest symbol of religion " I thank the vegetarians, however, for one winkle, and advise my Queensland friends to try it-namely Dates cut in two parts and stones taken out, the fruit to be soaked in boiling milk, with just a shred or two of lemon peel to give it a flavour There is a scheme afoot to send a couple of teams of young women cricketers to Australia next year, and at the Military Exhibition on Saturday we had an opportunity of seeing, under the best conditions, what they are like when pitted against one another The ground is quite large enough for such a sport, and there is a grand stand in which a thousand people can be comfortably seated The weather was delightful, and in the absence of any entertainment more pressing, many who had only read about these damsels who during the season had been playing matches, went to see them. On the whole, the spectacle of these girls using the willow instead of wearing it was pleasing There was at least nothing to offend the most fastidious taste The costumes line on one side and red on the other, were sensible and becoming, being uniformly loose tunics of a Garibaldi character, short skirts about 3in off the ground, and altogether conveying a general impression that the workers do not make personal vanity the first article of their creed A crowd of probably 10 000 persons all told watched the players, who did their work very well, even horn an export cricketer s point of view 'they are now making a business (and a very well paid one too of their engagements A week that began at the Crystal Palace and ended at the Military Exhibition, shows that they are now regularly established in public favour Those lady sportsmen are young of course good looking and take tea and ginger- beer at luncheon time Many of them were members of the evening gymnastic school at the People's Palace in the East End A good deal too much has been made of the so called disturbances which occurred during the meeting of the Trades Union Congress at Liverpool A number of working men when they meet together to discuss matters in which all feel an interest, and as to which there is necessarily some diversity of opinion, is pretty much like a meeting of any other body of men But by some of our newspapers every little noise that disturbed the meeting of the son grass was magnified into rowdyism of a reprehensible kind Of course at the British Association meetings things As deadly dull, and rows seldom occur But at ordinary assemblies not even excluding the House of Commons of Church Congresses snell demonstrations as happened at Liverpool are not of uncommon occurrence Considering the heated character of the questions to be discussed, the favour exhibited was a very natural thing amongst persons who do not pretend to have the repose which marks the caste of Vere de >. era Since the congress the unionists at head-quarters have been discussing the losses and gains of the week, and I fancy that the old stagers of unionism are serious m then hears of a divided house when, some dev, the eight hours' question comes to a practical ci ism The non election of Mr John Burns on thoPaihaniontary Committee, upon a vote of full congress, has been a blow to the new school, though the i of user of one of the elect to serve after the adoption of the eight hours' resolution secures him a seat in this connection it may also be remarked that the subset ip tion for a Wago I and to keep him in his seat in the County Council has made deplorably little progress just after the congress came the strike at Southampton This is an old story now but the men were beaten very badly It seems that the local unionists precipitated the strike without the orders or consent of the people in London and they went at their demonstrate tions without their heads In a short time they had the town in an uproar talked very big about during the past, adopted a high and mighty tone about then picketing, and so brought their own humiliation Troops were sent down, gunboats lay off the docks and the Riot Act was read by the mayor 1 ultimately no shots were filed but the strikers were played upon by the engines and scatter ed in a sorry manner Ihowoist was that they had to give in, when they found, at the London headquarters were against them, and in a somewhat sulky fashion retired from the contest without any str ii of money, but declaring that they would someday have a "bitter revenge" The letter published in the Anna some days since from an Australian correspondent who informed us that the money sent so liberally from the antipodes for the (lookers last year was" merely but for poor men in distress and not proof of sympathy with trades unionism generally, has been often quoted and made much of by the papers and public speakers who are trying to in go the masters to form a strong union to give battle to the men on their own principles 'The unionists would gain immensely if their leaders did not bestow so much Citizens do not care to be threatened with darkness cold, and raining by aiH combinations of poisons, and the cause in whose name such Threats are uttered loses that public sympathy without which they can do nothing The Southampton strike is "an tu idly over the one point of danger left being the attitude of the Union Steamship Company who, having conceded to the men the wages they) have asked decline peremptorily to discharge an old and faithful still and who is a non unionist at the du tation of Mr Walsh secretary of the Seamen and 1 seamen s boon They say they will not perpetrate such a rank injustice ' Ireland is tranquil The league r knocked to pice s 'Iho plan of camped!

Yet, how much they have changed in character since they were started The expectation at first was that they would be like the Alhambra in its olden days without the smoking and drinking, and would be a kind of promenade for men and women about town for a year or two they were of that complexion Then arose conductors who introduced the highest class of music, until now we have our classical nights when the works of the masters may be heard from scientific orchestras At present the farewell appearances of the veteran Sims Reeves are the principal items of the week, and although it is not correct to describe the tenor as being as good as ever, he is really in marvellous voice, and can, as the saying goes, " sing the head off of many a young tenor His engagement, I hope, will do some good, if it only serves to make people tired of the modern song This may be achieved by comparing the pretentious staff of the "Then of my thou" school, with the simple but sweet melodies with which the name of Sims Reeves was associated when he was in his prime, and there often appeared with him on the same platform, Weiss, Miss Palmer, and Miss Banks At Covent Garden, a rustle of delight runs through the house when the preliminary touches of the accompanist herald " My Pretty Jane" " Come into the garden, Maud, of "The Jolly Young Waterman The provinces last, and then the metropolis are now to see for themselves a young actress who, in the belief of her master, Mr Hermann Vezin, is to be a coming Rachel In theatrical circles it is well known that this accomplished teacher of stage elocution is enthusiastic in his predictions of her career as a frat/eeiumic I have heard Miss Laura Johnson recite, and can well believe in such possibilities A more weird looking damsel in her teens I never saw At times you fancy that the pallid face peeping out from furze bush hair, and the aesthetically draped figure belonged to a precocious child of fourteen, then, by and by you deem it not improbable that she may be four or five and twenty It is a gain to have an eccentric up pearance, it looks like genius In this case, the elocution was undoubtedly striking, in passages very powerful and, with due stage practice, I shall expect Miss Laura Johnson to take the very first position in real tragedy About two years ago as noticed by us at this time, Messrs Marshall and Slade, of Glengallan, shipped to the order of Messrs George Blaine and bon, at the Cape of Good Hope some rams and ewes, which were so highly esteemed that a second shipment of ewes for lowed some months subsequently One of the rams shipped was a first prize sheep at Brisbane and Toowoomba, and according to Messrs Blame's interesting letters, which we have been permitted to peruse, this race created quite a sensation among the sheep breeders of the Cape The Glengallan sheep have been found to be so admirably suited to the climate of the Cape that Messrs Marshall and Slade has just fulfilled another order to the same breeders, the sheep having left Glengallan few days ago by way of Sydney It appears from 'Messrs Blnmos letters that they have a pure flock of Ercildoun blood out that type of sheep, as is the case here, is unsuitable to the climate Several of their neighbours have been resorting to me Tasmanian sheep as a means of improvement Mr James Gibson's stock having been drawn upon for that purpose but the progeny of the Glengallan sheep have more than held their own at the Cape, both in density, fineness and weight of (fleece In a letter recently received Messrs Blaine give the weights of fleece or Cape Town wool of some of the Glengalla" sheep 'The rams- gave ThiS 8oz and low respectively, and three ones 143 18s 10d and 10s 12oz respectively In that letter nor state 'hat the nun, 210, above referred to considered the best sheep ever introduced into that colony, his stock being universal) a' mu ed there Pans landlords have recently furnished sub jet for a good deal of criticism (the cÂ°i'tÂ»PÂ°n dent of the Stands in that capital sa The other day one of them expelled a torian. because he had become the fÂ»Â»Â«Â«0'Â»'^"" child His lease stipulated that he had to leave if he had a family of more than three children.
