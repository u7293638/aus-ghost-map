The Glen Osmond, from London, reached the anchorage on Saturday morning, having made the land to the southward of Kangaroo Island three days previously, !-,ut the light winds prevented her progress to her destination. The vessel looks as well as on previous voyages, and as each wool ship turns up the immense improvements of modern craft are more and more apparent. That the traffic is also wonderfully increasing is proved by the fact that Captain Angel is now on his last voyage in the " Glen," and nest year pur poses bringing out a still liner vessel to keep pace with the age. The Glen Osmond will also continue in the trade under another com mander, so that the Elder line will possess some very fine ships, of the present voyage Captain Angel reports leaving London on August 29, but in consequence of light westerly winds, she was not off the Lizard until September 4, when she lay becalmed for two days—a most unusual occurrence in that latitude, rendered more surprising by numbers of tropical fish (albacore, sharks, and swordfish) being in the vicinity. However, on the 8th she made a fair start with a favouring breeze, and in 30' N. fell into brisk trades, which ceased in 12°, and for 10 days only 403 miles were accounted for. On October L in 3° N., the South-East trades commenced, and on the 3rd crossed the Equinox, when tlie vessel made several days' good running at from 230 to 240 miles per diem. The meridian of the Cape was passed on 29th October, and in 4V south a succession of gales was experienced till reaching the line of Cape Lenwin on lStli November, when the wind \eered to about north, and remained in that quarter till the Glen had beaten up for the land. After sighting Cape Willoughby, the first slant of fair breezes was felt, and the Gulf was entered by way of Backstairs Passage. She was seen from the stations early on Saturday morning; lier general appearance soon establishing her identity. When anchored there were friends from the shore ready to welcome back some old colonists who returned by her. The Royal Sin I'HEHD is again in commission, and when Captain Ward returned from Port Augusta on Suuday he at once made fast to the Orient-Liner Darra, into which a lot of copper is to be forthwith transhipped. The Ettie was wool-laden at Port Augusta when the Shepherd left, and had been there 14 days ready for sea, but had not a ghost of a fair wind during that period. The barque Kohinoor had managed to drop down somehow, and was passed on Friday when 25 miles N. W. of Port Wallaroo, at which place she was to take in copper. The Ror.EiiT Hene, with the Cape Jaffa Light house on board, arrived at Lacepede Bay on the 22nd, and got aground there until the following tide, when Captain Mortess rendered what assis tance was needed, and she was lioated into deep water. The St. Vincent, from London and Plymouth, returned to port on Tuesday morning at'an early hour, and Captain Louttit's preconcerted signal of arrival was seen from the stations, but not in sufficient time to forward report. It was the grey of the morning when the boats boarded, and there was scarcely a perceptible change in the line ship, save and except a little less draught of water. This will enable her to be towed into harbour on this morning's tide—an advantage she generally enjoys from adaptability to the Port. She is in splendid trim for making a voyage, and has completed the run from Plymouth in 79 days, with rather a pre dominance of calms on the Line. If a fair run in had offered the anchorage would have been reached on Saturday, but on making northing from about 44° S. light N.E. winds came off the land and detained her. On leaving Plymouth the log book records twelve days in succession on a wind, and it was only in 28' N. a lead was made on the N.E. trades, which were as brisk as could be desired, though of short duration; consequently it was October 14 before the Line was crossed, in IS" 10' west longitude. On October 31 passed the prime meridian, up to which point there was no violent weather of any character reported, but on reaching 43' S., 19 E., the meteoro logical instruments gave notice of an approaching storin. Having a fine ship under him, with ample sea-room, the captain merely considered it an opportunity of testing his knowledge of the laws relating to cyclones, this branch of his profession having been made a particular study. With the wind at the north, tlie vessel steered a course S.E. until by computation of the approaching gale it was found advisable to alter to E.N.E. Scarcely was this change put into practice when the hurri cane came down with full fury, sweeping along the ocean at an incredible rate. But the vortex was distant almost 40 miles to the southward, so, by canying a press of sail, the ship escaped ils extreme violence, and steered away from the centre of the cyclone, finally taking advantage of its ex ternal radius to make a couple of good days' run. After passing Cape Leuwin on November 23, in 41" S., the" wind drew ahead, and induced a beat up to Kangaroo Island, which was made on Sunday, aud on Tuesday morning she anchored at the ! Lightship. I The schooner Bella Rose has chartered for Port Natal, and last night received her mall on board prter La making sail for that colony. POST AUGUSTA SHIPPING. Sailed.
