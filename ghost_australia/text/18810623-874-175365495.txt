THE HAUNTED HOUSE. THE Haunted House is all wrecked and bare, With its windows smashed and its doors all gone, And the nightwinds murmur and moan in there In a ghostly tone, and the moonlight wan Looks doubly wan on each mouldering floor; And the walls are clammy, as if grim Death Had breathed upon all, and sheeted them o'er With the churchyard dew of his icy breath. And the ceaseless fingers of cold decay Are busy at labour, and, bit by bit, They crumble its walls and its roof away, And the rank weeds spring where the fires were lit; And a ceaseless murmur is sounding there— A ceaseless murmur that never dies— And it swells and fallB on the burthened air, Like'a dying sinner's despairing cries. Oh 1 a dismal place is the Haunted House, Where webbing spiders alone will stay ; For the conscious rat and the conscious mouse Have fled from that blighted home away. And night and day, aye, in light and gloom, A step is heard on the creaking floor, And something wanders from room to room, And it moans forever and evermore. Yet that house was the dwelling of hearts once light; That's But the liberalism, father sickened, ajid G. Berry-blight, of what we are sick, And the sensible fellow made off—cut his stick. So he's one of i;he seventy thousand gone Beyond the border or over the ferry, And the ghost that haunteth that dwelling wan Is the blessing he left for our friend, G. Berry.
