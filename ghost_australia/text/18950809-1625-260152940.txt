POETRYi The Sin ©/ Ominsiom It Isn't the thing you do, dear, It's the thing you leaves urujono, Which gives you a bit of a heartache At the Belting of the sun. Tho tender word forgotten, The letter you did not writo, The rfowor you might have sent, dear, Are your haunting ghosts to-night. The atone you might have lifted Out of.a brother's way, The bit of heartsoinc counsel You wore hurried too much to any The loving touch of the lmnd, dear, The gentle and winsome to., e That you had no time nor thought for, With troubles enough of your own. These little acts of kindness, S:> easily out of mind, These chanccs to bo angels Which even mortals find— Thoy come in night and s'lencB, Kaoh chill reproachful wraith, When hope is iaint and flagging, And a blight has dropped on faith. For lire is all too short, dear, And sorrow is all too gr>'at, To suffer onr alow compassion That tarries until too Into. And it's not the thing you do, dear, It's the thing you leave undone, Which gives vou the bitter heartache At the setting of the sun. —MARGARET E. SAXGSTEB.
