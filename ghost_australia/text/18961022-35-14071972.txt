The proposal of the Premier differs, indeed, from some which have formerly been mooted, inasmuch as it limits the use of the Referendum to cases where the two Houses have failed to agree upon a bill passed twice by the Legislative Assembly. The scheme admittedly has its fascinations for many minds. It is understood to be advanced, and democratic, and by some it is not regarded as a serious drawback that it undermines the authority of the most feared and most valued political institutions of our country and our race. Nothing' less than this can be involved in the proposal to take away from Parliament the decision of the most important political questions, leaving only to the legislature the task of putting into legal form the determination arrived at, Tloavon only knows how, by those of the electors who take the trouble to record a vote on the subject. A little consideration will show that so far from legislation by plebiscite being the most advanced and scientific development of Parliamentary and representative government it is the supersession and abrogation of that system. "We may go further and cite the experience of those countries where the system has been tried, as proving that it has never been adopted save where the people have little confidence in their legislators, or where their legislators have by their enactments shown their belief that they did not possess the confidence of the people. Let us try to work out what the effect of this method of plebiscites legislation would be on our system of Parliamentary representation and responsible government. What would be the practical effect had the often suggested proposal been carried to refer the fiscal question to the vote of the electorates ? "We will assume that the result yielded a majority of votes for protection. This would have to be taken as a direction to Parliament to introduce and carry a protective tariff into law. "What would be its practical working ? We are sometimes told that the intention of the plebiscite is to free great questions from the embarrassing influence of party and personal associations, which it would not at all dis- turb. But does this imply that the present freetrade Government and freetrade party would forthwith proceed to join hands with the Opposition in carrying a protectionist policy into law ? Surely so demoralising and degrading an expectation could not be seriously entertained. Freetrade members, or, in the opposite event, protectionist members, would feel that they were still bound by their pledges to the constituencies by whose votes they were returned to Parliament. If the popular vote wore an overwhelming one they might resign as a whole, and so bring about a dissolution of Parliament one of the issues the method is intended to super soda. Or if the numbers were nothing from equality, they might treat the vote as indecisive, and proceed to continue the contest in Parliament on the same footing as before. This would be the other issue the plebiscite is meant to obviate, The one result would lead to the whole matter being fought out in Parliament as though no plebiscite had been taken. The other would lead to the battle being transferred to the country in the form of a general election, A similar dilemma is presented to one House or the other, or to one party or the other, by Mr. BWs proposal for the reference of questions at issue between the two Chambers to a vote of the electors. In any case, until Parliament had been reduced to the character of a more machine for the registration of popular votes in other words, destroyed as an independent tribunal-thoplobisoitary vote would either be more surplusage, or would produce those party transfers of power it is held to render unnecessary. What it certainly could not do, until all honour and self respect had been stamped out of Parliamentary life, and until members had exchanged their position of Represents. tives for that of mere delegates, is to cause them to cast aside all their avowed principles, all their pledges to their constituents, and to vote against both principles and pledges in obedience to the peremptory orders of a popular majority. It is not sense to present such a comfort to us as an improved development of Parliamentary institutions. Obviously it could be nothing but their debasement and their ultimate destruction. It is to no purpose to tell us that this method is in various forms in operation in Switzerland and in some of the States of the American Union, and that some political thinkers have expressed themselves favourably to its introduction into Great Britain.. Before giving any weight to this argument we have to look a little more closely into the circumstances of each case. In America, where certain subjects are dealt with in some of the States by direct vote of the people, in the shape of constitutional amendments, the system is avowedly based on the distrust of the people in the legislatures. Mr. Barton, in his work on America, mentions that among the causes tending to this super session of the legislature " there had been a decline in the quality of the State legislatures and of the legislation they turned out. They were regarded with loss respect, they inspired less confidence Tence the people had the further excuse for superseding the legislature, that they might reasonably fear it would neglect or spoil the work they desired to see done." The same distinguished authority , adds :-" Instead of being stimulated by this distrust to mend their ways and recover their former powers, the State legislatures fell in with the tendency and promoted their own super session." It is odd to find Mr. BRYCE'S authority sometimes quoted for viewing the system of direct legislation of the people as a more highly-developed form of Parliamentary government, of which it is apparent that it is the decision and the condemnation. After this reference to the American example, that of Switzerland is hardly worth dealing with. The Referendum comes when the work of the legislature is done, and is merely a submission of the completed work to the vote of the people, a vote which is frequently exercised. Sir F. 0. ADAMS, in his valuable work, "The Swiss Confederation," tells us that when the Referendum was first introduced it was violently opposed by the Conservatives, who, however, " became very earnest supporters of it when they found that it undoubtedly acted as a drag upon hasty and radical law-making." This point is one worth the consideration of our ultra-modern- crate. As for the " initiative," the other form which the popular vote assumes in Switzerland, the experience of its working is too short to afford much opportunity of judging of its objects. The point to keep in view with respect to all those systems is that they spring from a deeply-rooted distrust of the legislatures of the countries in which they exist, a dis- trust acquiesced in by the legislatures themselves. Their operation must tend to keep more of independent character from entering a Parliamentary system in which they are the subjects of popular distrust and severe limitation. In restricting and lowering Parliament they must lower the character of the men who take part in it, and by stripping the Parliamentary system of its influence and its power they would at last leave it little but facetiousness, servility, jobbery, and corruption. _____________ Though the deadlock over the Parba mentary Refreshment room and the steward thereof is a very pretty quarrel as it stands, it is only important in a domestic sense It touches no vital public interest, and though it presents a bosom branch to a Parliamentary deadlock, it is tuning Mr President and Mr Speaker claim on constitutional ground and the colony the appointment of officers of 1 a lament, but the Refreshment Committee of both Houses claims the appointment of a steward who does not happen to be favoured by the Chairs That is all Yet here is matter for a constitutional quart c1, for resignations in a body, for heated correspondence, acrimonious debate in Parliament and statements by Mr Speaker, and for an interregnum during which the sympathetic outsider wonders how his not particularly) grave SORROWS procure those creature comforts which their labours in the public interest so well fit them to enjoy) i here is but one party in the state that will draw comfort from this incident, the one which believes that from the refreshment-room flows all the scandal of Parliament to other people the quarrel TOOUH pal by enough, and since it obviously has taken its rise from an invasion of custom one way or the other it ought to have been quietly solved by a little over case of that moderation and common sense which ordinary people bring to those difficulties Here is a piece of internal and immigration by Parliament of a business arrangement made for the convenience of its own members and of them only , you Parliament falls to quarreling over it, flies to lOLrninnations, and ends in sinking At this very morn- out, as the irony of chance will have it, one branch of Parliament is invited to consider, and the other soon will be engaged in considering, a bill for solving the de Hooks which sometimes occur in the constitutional relations of the two Houses of Legislature 'there is, something of irony in the fact that while Parliament makes such a sorry exhibition of its tact, temper, and judgment in con boiling one of its own domestic depart month, it should be devising measures for minimising the form double qmi less that nine out of the fierce clash of political changes and convictions If the oligarchy, that is the President and the Speaker, cannot agree with the democracy), nan eh the members of the Refreshment Committee, about the appointment of a servant to manage their morals, is it very likely that any machines) which legislation can set up will remove the friction between the two Houses over matters of much greater pith and moment The spirit which will not make a single concession in the choice of a steward for the refreshment booth cannot be quite disposed to sweet reasonableness when the point in dispute is who shall bury the power of the Government The holding of an encampment for the military forces is again pressed upon the Government, and though Mr Buiwitnt would give no definite assurance to the deputation of yesterday, the project seems to be in a more favourable way The Colonial Secretary was disposed to regard the application as rather late, not, of course, in view of the holding of an encampment next Easter, but owing to the Estimates having been passed Then there was a, difference of opinion about the amount to be provided Mr Bm-NKrn feared £30,000 would be neces dary That is not a sum to be lightly spot, but after all, the real con election is whether our military forces are not, owing to the Act and of periodical training and opportunity for officers and men to take part in manoeuvres on a large scale, losing their efficiency Parliament, oven while reducing as far as possible the costs of the robbery establishment, admits by the expenditure sanctioned that the maintenance of a defence force is unavoidable. There is the small nucleus of the force, consisting of permanent artillery and infantry, the military train- ing of which need not be questioned. Beyond the regulars are the much larger number or of partially-paid volunteers, the rifle reserves, the Naval Brigade and Naval Artillery Volunteers, the Mounted Infantry, and the now national corps of rifles. What is the state of this arm of the service ? From the representations of the deputation, and the statements of high officers, including the ex-New mandant, it is to be gathered that the want of this force is systematic and continuous training. Several years have elapsed since a general encampment was held, and, though by the zeal of officers and men, certain regimental camps of instruction have taken place, the fact is,' as stated, that a considerable number of the men now enrolled, especially those living in the country, have never taken part in large field movements, We may well ask whether it is economy to spend money year by year in uniforms, capitation allowances, weapons, and ammunition, besides drill instructors and inspection by staff officers, for numbers of men who could not be put in the ii old with reliance upon their military knowledge and their capacity for acting together in complicated movements. No one doubts the courage and the good will of the volunteers, but these fine attributes are nullified by ignorance, for which the men themselves are not responsible but their Government is It might be supposed that the British navy or the German army is at all times in a state of preparedness, but every year these and other services of the great Powers are called out and subjected to lengthened manoeuvres under conditions of actual warfare In the other colonies, especially Victoria, depression has not been allowed to cause the abandonment of continuous training. The holding of an encampment next year would be popular with the forces and the citizens ; it will have the approval of competent judges, and it would be well for the Government to consider speedily whether with reason able economy the continuous training could not be restored.
