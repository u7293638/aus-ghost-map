PORTFOLIO. Every seventh day, if not oftener, the greater number of well- meaning persons in England thankfully receive from their teachers a benediction couched in these terms :-"The Grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, and the Lore of God, and the Fellowship of the Holy Ghost, be with you." Now, I do not know precisely what sense is attached in the English public mind to these expressions. But what I have to tell you positirely is that the three things do actually exist, and can to known if , care to know them, and jpossew if you care to possess them; and that another thing exists be side these, of which we already know too much. First, by simply obeying the orders of the Founder of your religion, all trace, graciousness or beauty and favour of gentle life, will be given to you in mind and body, in work and in rest. Seeondly, as you know more and more of created world, you will find that the true will of iut Maker is that its crea tore- shtold be happy; that He has made everything beautiful in its time ani its ples, and that it is chiefly by the fault of men, ahen you are allowed the liberty of thwarting Ili laws, that Creatin groans or travails in pain. The love of iGo exists, and you may see it, and live in it if you will. Lastly, a Spirit dtes actually exist Who teaches the ant her path, the bird her building, and men, in an instinctive and marvel lous way, whatever lovely sets and noble deeds are possible to them. Without lim you could do no good thing. To the grief of Him yon can do many bad ones. In the rwoess;ion of Ilim i; your itaee ard your p~wer. .r i uzk: .
