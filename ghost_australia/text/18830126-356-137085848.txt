One of the'distPuces for the great 'inter national event have bean 'urn, and Myers 'von with the greatest ease imaginabld, 'Georgo never having a ghost of a chance to win at any piftiofof 'the rime. A"' s stated -laste week, the weather was very cotd,'and a suddenozi change from souiewihat "ixce s'sive heat rendercd the dold 'more apparent. T''his lasted until Saturday afternoon, and juist about an.hour before the time set for 'the race the sun broke through the grey rlouds, and somewhat warmed up the atmosphero 'wherever it reaohed. ''The wind also dropped, and altogether ib was' a very favourable afternoon, considering all things, and much more so than had been looked foi in the morning. The patli at the Polo Grounds was notin good condition, the 'deluges"of- rain we. had aboiit two months-ago having cut it up, and not'being attended to at the time the top. dressing, n~wly laid-in the "wash outs," was ~obse,. anid gave way Under the; spikes. 'QldWack Gotilding did the best he could, but still' it was not ' a good ;track 'all the : way;; :'As George had,to ,make the running to.win, and Mlyors's best .cardwiis,to, waiti:the in-. siide position was' off~irod to and taken by the visitor, whowias in'blialek shirbt'add I~ni? trunks; While Myers was arriayed il whit? eas usual-a most unfortunate ?seolection eon sideeing his'darkcomplexion, : Timeokeepers ' ero stationedat various fractional distances to0get the rate of goingall through. The lap, is a third 'of a mile, so of course it' was necessary to run' a lap and a half. George came away.from his mark at a strong pace, and Myers just lay clear of him all the way round to the stand, vwhere he drew up a little closer as the 2500 spectators cheered them on. Once the semi.cirole of stands was ,passed Myers dropped back a yard behind George, and kept there till 000 yards had boon covered. The Noew Yorker then gradually olosed up, maklung no eff'ort in doing so, and was level or nearly so, at 700 yards. A little farther on he was in front, and he remainod ootent uwith a three yards' lend at the utmost, winning in the easiest manner imnaginablo by a trifle loss than three yards, ?i 1 min.'50 3.5 sou; .Georgo's time was taklen as 1 min. 57 seo.

Myersa' performance is a second slo vor than he has previously beencredited with, but GCoosge's 1 min. 5' see. is faster than any English amateur has oveiÂ· run the distance in, colipsing what at theutimo was tle sensation half in 1 min. 57.i:seo., by Fred.
