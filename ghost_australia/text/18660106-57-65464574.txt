COMPLIMENTS OF THE SEASON. SONGS. Written expressly for the Sydney Punch. AIR: "Break, break, break." MAKE, make, make, Sixpennorth of malice, O P----! And I would that thy bread and butter Came an honester way to thee. O well for the newspaper boy That he puffs thy mild daub by the way! O well for the barrister cad That he grins at and pockets his pay. And the sulky Edgar goes back To the pitiful pence in his till; But O for the glimpse of a genuine joke, And the ghost of a laugh that is still! Take, take, take This box for thy Christmas, O P----! But the tender grace of a day without "shams" Will never come back to me.
