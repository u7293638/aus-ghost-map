FROM SONGS OF THE WIRES. By Will Carleton. Hear them sing of trade and battle ; hear the gold- coin chink and rattle 1 Hear the feverish stammering ticker : stocks are up 1 and stocks are down ! There's rejoicing, there is wailing, there is ruin in the town. lie who was a prince at morning is a beggar oi the night; She who held the world in scorning now may wither in its sight. Ah ;l: a battle now is on! tell the news and who has won 1 Hear the bullets ringing, stinging — Through/the wires' spasmodic singing ; ' Chanting throughout the Wood-dimmed day ; And.this is what they say : — Hot cannon heard upon the hills And rifles in the glen ; Oh, all the world will' listen, now : ' ,'? For men are murdering men I , . . Not hunting God's four-footed beasta Or feathered clans, they came : ' ' : ?; -A nation is their hunting-ground, And other men their game. He was a glittering general With thousands at his nod : He is a fragment of the turf : A clod beneath a clod. ????'?; He was a sunny-hearted boy — ; A hope, but even now : ......... ..He i s. a spectre in his home, With blood upon his brow. She was a proud and winsome wife The world could not assail ; She walks the street a ghost in black ...Beneath the widow's veil ; , - . : She was a mother, fond and proud, . ? ?; .; .When morning's gems .were strown : ..... She is, a wrecked old woman now, '..''.'' And writhes and sobs alone.
