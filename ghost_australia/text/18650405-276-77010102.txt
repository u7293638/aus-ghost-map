After much research Ww' nra a'nio to tell her. All .who wear rii^.ex officio, wear,tji$p» on.that finger. Cardinals, bishops, doctors, abbot*, etc., each wear their ring on the third froger. The reason is that it is the first vacant finger. Tbe thumb and the first two fingers have always been reserved as 'symbols of the three persona ofthe blessed Trinity. When a bishop give# bis bless ing he blesses with the thumb and first two fingers, Our brassed and sepulchral slabs witness to this fact. At the marri age ceremony the ring is'put on by the thum and the first two fingers, whilst the names:of "the Father, the Son, and the Hply Ghost'! are pronounced. Thus, the third is the first vacant finger, and the ring-finger. The wedding-ring is worn on the left band to signify the sub jection of the wife to her husband. The right hand signifies power, independence^ authority. The left band signifies de pendence or subjection,. Married women then, wear the wedding-ring on t.He third finger of the left baud/ because they are subject to their husbands. Bishops, be cause they have ecclesiastical authority ; ? and doctors, because they have authority to tcach, wear the ring on the ring-: finger of the right hand. S.-Respectfully declined.
