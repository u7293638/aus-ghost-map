Considerable delay took place in making up the final re turne, owing to a miatake mado by ono of deputy returning officerB at tho Dana street Behool, and tho fact that Messrs.

Wil- liams. The eleclion to-day passed off in a very quiet manner, bo far aa the "centra" waa concerned. Timuka to the foresight of the returning officer, Mr. If. Kirkwood, an addi- tional pollirg booth had been obtained for the Eaglebawk division, viz., at California Gully, and the consequence was that the laboura of the deputies at the town-hall were lightened to a considerable extent. There waa only an average amount of excitement during tbo day up till about half-past 3 o'clock, whoa the voters began to come ¡u large numbers, keeping tho deputies busy from that hour till the time of olosiog, 5 o'clock. A few versified squibs were cir- culated, and the triumvirate, Mesara. Hall and Yeo, and T. Moore bad cuba running freely. Beyond theso, there was nothing to indicate a warmly-conteated election in the largeet electorate in Victoria. Polling Plans. Axcdalo _ Orossy - Hal Btldgowal'r Derby _ Leichhardt.
