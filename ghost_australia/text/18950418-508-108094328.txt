The Rev. H. R. Haweis.* The last of the series of lectures by Rev. H. B. Haweis had for its subject, 'Modern Ghosts and Spiritualism,' and naturally enough this attracted a large audience to the School of Arts last night. The lecturer announced that tfe he took an attitude of strict impartiality towards modern ghosts and spiritualism, and he then proceeded to deal at length with various phases of the subject. While not an ardent disciple of the occult, and never having seen a ghost or heard spirit voices, still he said there is a great deal in occultism, even if that great deal has nothing more for a basis than the belief of thousands of sen sible, Highly-educated, and acute people. Of course, ne said, there is humbug and fraud connected with spiritualism. But then there is humbug and fraud connected with everything1.* What was wanted was an 'open mind,' and a discriminating mind. If 'nothing in the shape of a spiritual visitation occurred to a man in his life that man would be justified in believing-, on his own account, that the theory of occultism . required a great deal of proving; but no sensible man could reject the many instances that seemed to show that in certain minds the spiritual side was receptive beyond ordinary belief . The lecturer then quoted some remarkable cases of manifestation, and exhibited some photographs said to have been taken directly under the agency of mediums gifted' with spiritualistic power. Mr. HaweiB told the stories or these pictures as they were told to Mm, neither embel lishing ' nor commenting, but simply stating his authorities. He urged inquiry as against wide-mouthed credulity or ignorant scepticism regarding spiritual ism, and lie was listened to throughout with the keenest attention by his audi ence. ?
