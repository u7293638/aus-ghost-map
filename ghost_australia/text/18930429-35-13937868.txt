i FUGITIVE NOTES. -* I Everybody know that adulteration of food and liquor was a frequent offence and that of all the of "airs of the human body there is none other against which so systematic wrong is done by the competition of trade and commerce as the stomach But no man in his wildest delirium over dreamt of such adulteration as that which was lately brought to light in a prosecution at the Water Police Court, or imagined that event it would have come to this that man should be called to partake of dimctbylamidoa bcn/oaulphonic anchor And yet all that was proved by analytical chemistry to have been actually court used as an ingredient in the drink sent out from France to tickle the palates of Australia This directly lamidoabou/ostilphonic was only one item in the composition and in the others had anything like the same nomenclature, it was enough to have prostrated the community with cholera morbus How any man could have the conscience to put directly loinidoabenrosulphouio in anybody's tipple, and expect to die in his bed, surpasses belief and the man that walked down Pitt-street with a gill of directly larnidonbou"osulpboaic under his waist- band might fairly be expected to close for reconstruction " It was a French brandy, it appears, made in Antwerp for foreign consumption , but surely there is scientific ingenuity enough in the colony for manufacturing something with a less repulsive name that would be capable of equally deadly effect, A man swallowing a thing with a name as long as a crocodile might be expected to see -snakes and when Dr Manning is making up his next statistics of mi dress, it might be worth his while to discover how much of the abnormal increase of insanity may be attributable to swallowing the new importation of dimothylamidoaben-osulphonic There was a romance of sympathy around the story of the Quai Island floods which will be dissipated by such prosaic thing as a begging appeal to England in behalf of the Church Ino cables tell us that a reverend prelate has sent home an appeal for assistance on behalf of the Church 111 Queensland in consequence of the loss and suffering occasioned by the late floods " There was sometmugnoblo in the indignation with which our northern neighbours repudiated the action of the municipal authorities of their metropolis when a similar appeal was made They were too proud to ask for help from England, where destitution and suffering worse than theirs are chrome And it is a pitiful thing that where mere worldly honour proudly disdains to be a mendicant, religion is seen to creep in, and say that it, at least, is not too proud to take a dose Surely the churches and parsonages have not suffered greater disaster than the homes of private citizens, and if Queensland stations are too high-spirited to ask for alms in England, it should not be the part of the Church to set an example of lack of spirit These appeals of religion from Australia, where comfort and wealth are greater and more equally distributed than in any other part of the world, to England, where poverty is chronic, for eleemosynary aid constitutes one of the blues on Australian character and incidents like these do not tend to elevate the dignity of religion in the c} os of colonists, whatever they may do in the eyes of the people or England It is an old time idea that I overty parties or the co tractor of holiness, and that there is a nobility 111 mendicancy 113 a religious virtue But it grates harshly on the high spirit d sentiments of modern times which make it honour- able for manor in" tower for what they want, instead of waiting for help from others. It is noticeable that it is only 111 connect on with religion and religious org indications that we see the proud spent 01 Australian independence dragging itself in this way in the dust and one sometimes thin' s that the cause of Christianity must sometimespra},' save me from my friends ' What a ghastly glimpse of Russian life we have in the story of the peasants and the Czar's train. there have been many ways of preventing people's plaint to their rulers, but we may search in vain for a parallel to three thousand people throwing themselves on the rails, prepared to be run over by' a is - mg tram, sooner than forego the desire to represent their case to then monarch, had must be the case that impels to suchare_iedv,andgloomyt-oisolationofthe ruler so guarded found that his subjects can had access to his ear in no better way The crushing of the peasants beneath the wheels of the train may have been more stable, but the daughter of others by the imperil escort throws a fund light over the whole occurrence, and give or in the aspect of a massacre. No doubt the perils by which the Czar is continually beset, and the frequent attempts made on his life, gave to this method of arresting the Imperial tram the appearance of another _s throat plot, and the " rage and terror " of the Czar, which seem at first to stand out so hideously before the self-slaughter of the wretched peasants, were only the outcome of a belief that his life - as in immediate danger To minds that have been accustomed as ours are to look on govern -leaf of any kind is having its t nison drive only in the interests of the governed, it seems a mystery that gov eminent resting on such relations between the governed and the governing can exist. We ask ourselves for we have stood it exists a To the Czar it brings neither good nor happiness, and no doubt he many a time must wish that he could lay aside the dignity vv th all its glory for the calm of private life, but that he feels bound to his lot by the iron hand of destiny While to the people, in proportion as they arise out of the dead sea of ignorance and misery, the unendurable nature of the tyranny under which they lies, appears to become more maddening A peaceful evolution out of such intolerable relations, seems impossible, and this is exactly one of those historical situations for which fate appears to have no solution but the whirlwind 01 war and revolution. says.. The persistent hut ineffective efforts of the Railway Commissioners in Victoria to stop the missing habits of their railway men are becoming patience, and the department is at its a its' end as to what it ought to do. The appointment of a staff of detectives ba- table-, the patrol or in of or s s men over thousands of miles of railway being unable to cope with the difficulty. Hitherto the Government has had to square its losses with its customers to the amount of three thousand a year, but three thousand pounds are three thousand pounds in these days of retrenchment, and the pinch of advice sity has forced the attempt to make its servants honest. But the question has seriously arisen whether, as a matter of economy, it will not better to let the steerage go on, from the apparent fact that it will cost more than three thousand a year to stop the stealing. The latest proposal is to erect watchtower in the railway sheds so that the eagle-eyed the watchman may survey the whole held. Cut as the sheds are half a mile in length, and the goods are piled up to great heights, with passages and hiding- places innumerable, the prospect of watching the thieves appears to be hopeless. It is one of the most curious phases yet presented by official life, and raises a lion in the path of that socialistic development which is set before us as the ideal of happiness in the coming tune. When Mr. Bellamy's vision comes to be realised, and everything is owned and managed by the State, unless human nature has undergone a phenomenal change, the difficulty of the Melbourne goods sheds will be intensified. This leakage in stores is not characteristic of private employment, but the Shire service appears to have developed a freedom of thought sometimes that is, to say the least, inconvenient. Under the regime so picturesquely trained by Mr. Bellamy, the State stores will be on a prodigious scale, and the play of hide and seek of the rats and mice among the Government stores in those days will throw utterly into the shade any memory of the modest achievements of our " incendiary rat " in the nineteenth century. . . It is rather late in the day to have the question of the lady doctor raised, and considerable surprise will be felt at hearing that the subject is said to be again to the front in an attempt to exclude a lady medical practitioner from professional appointment. And this is in Sydney, the city in which we take pride to ourselves for leading the way in removing the educational disabilities of the sex ' No one will contend that there is a fitness in a lady medical practitioner being charged with the conduct of every kind of medical or surgical treatment. But this makes the argument all the stronger way should not he excluded from any position for which by her sex She may be specially fitted. for the ailments of women and children her claims to recognition are unexceptionable, and it shows how hard old prejudices or- in dying when amid the light and intelligence of life in Australia the ghost of buried traditions should arise out of the grave of the past, and try to frighten her back from the position she has so honourably won The record of the struggle which woman has had in achieving the right to professional healing is not one that reflects favourably on the chivalry of the profession, but to the honour of existing practitioners it can he said that there is hardly one, unless those of the most antiquated school of thought, who does not welcome the advent of woman into the field of medical service. That a difficulty on the subject should have arisen in Sydney will whet the public curiosity, and it may be hoped that the whole affair, with all the circumstances attending it, may come forth into the light of day, so that we may all have a glance at the last stand taken on the question of the lady doctor.
