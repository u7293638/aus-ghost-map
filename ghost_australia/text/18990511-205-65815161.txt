"After the Ball." Prankston win. They beat Cheltenham. Only 15 played on each side. Ted McComb captained Frankatn. Jim O'Meara the "daddy" of the lot. Bert Shannon was first-class at high marking. Chrltenham never had a ghost of a chance from the bounce. Prankston want a lot more practice before they are perfect. Neither side had a full team-about 15 each. Some people say Cheltenham had a weak team, but they must re member that Frankston had a weak team also. Eleven goals 7 behinds to 3 6 goals behinds is not bad going, Only 49 points ahead ! Going home in the train the 'Chelts' were singing "There'll Come a Time Some Day," so Frankston had better prepare for a hard battle when they go to Cheltenham. Several of Frankston's " old timers " were on the ground, but could not be induced to strip. Perhaps Saturday's win will encourage them to have another go at the good old game. I hear Mornington have got a strong team together this season. A report of their meeting appears this week. Vick. Fitzpatrick played well--more espedlly wbhe li ing in front o4F th'e ladies' pavilion; and his white knickers looked so pretty. Tim O'Meara played real football, and is a splendid example for the young players to follow.
