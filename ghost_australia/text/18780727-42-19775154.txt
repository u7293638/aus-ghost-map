LITERATURE Selected Poetry. The Closing Scene. [The following is pronounced by the Westminster Review to be unquestionably the finest American poem ever written. The author's name as far as we know has never been made public.] Within tbe *ob*r lealm of leaflets treat, The ruatet year inhaled the dreamy air, Like bo me tanned reaper in hi* hour of ease, ' When all the field* are lying brown and bam. The gray barns, looking from the hazy hills O'er the dim waters widening in the vales, '■ > Sent down the air a greeting to the mills On the dull thunder of alternate flails. ! All right* were mellowed and all sounds subdued, The bills seemed further and the streams sang low; As in a dream, the distant woodman hewed His winter log with many a muffled blow. The embattled forest*, erewhile armed in gold Their banner* bright with every martial hue, Now stood, like some sad beaten host of old, ' Withdrawn afar in Tune's remotest blue. > . On slumberous wings the vulture tried his flight,'' •' ■ ' Th* dove scare* heard his sighing mate's complaint, And, like a star alow drowning in the light, The village churoh-vane seemed to pale and faint She asntinel cock upon the hillside crew- Crew thrice, and all was stiller than before- Silent till some replying wanderer blew His alien horn, and then was heard no more.

Alone, from out tho stubble, piped the quaJL ' And etoaked the crow through all the dreary gloom; Alone tho pheasant, drumming in the vale, Made echo to the distant oottage loom.
