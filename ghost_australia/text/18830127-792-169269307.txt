And those tumultuous assaults h»ve always arisen from some trivial, ^ijj^ent^ or innoceiit event, at which every onp wondered ft? pogn as the frenzy has Bpent itself. Thus, in the United States in 1834-6, the publication of TUB AMEVP STP*T OF MA&ju.; Monje, l>y an infamous Protestant girl, and her «till . more infamous Protestant paramour, a Protestant preraaber, led io'the burning of Oatho- Iw churohes and dwelling-houses in Philadelphia and Baltimore fey Protestant mobs. Then, in 1850, in England, the restoration of the Oatholio hierarchy in that country by the Pope' Occasioned a popular fury, which vented itself in the Backlog of Catholio <fturohes and other riotous demonstrations. The so- called Lord Geo. Gordon emeute in honion, 85 years ago, originated in the report that the Catholics were to he re-admitted'to their political rights. Of a similar, but more eanjjtoinary, kind was the panic frigfht, with its'judioial barbarities and mad excesses, in {he Mign of King JameflII.,wbioh oulmitiated in thp niurder of ArchbiBhop Plupket at Tyburn. All these, however, were of brief duration and oiroumsoribed range of operatibia. But at no 'time sihoe the desoenc of thp said Dr. Martin Lather to the usnal residence of his father has there beeta eo universal ana so acrimonious a no- Popery feeling animating the whole Protestant 'World simultaneously as in the present day, shared in T>y ^U, inflaming all, tod avowed by ill through their chosen Organs ana ohftnnels of publio opinion. As far as we can judge, this actively hostile feeling is based on Jear, vague, fanoifnl, and Unappeasable. Of nothing just now is the Protestant World, taken as 'a Whole, in fiuoh fear of as of " Popery,though the Protectant world tak^spaitisto persuade itself that the Pope is 1 dead, though never before, alnoe the termination of the Thirty Tear* 1 War, have Oathblio states&en; eo fearlessly jtl^yed the Oatholio game into the' haiids of anti-Oatholio politioal gamblere, heedless Of Catholic ; remonstrance 6r Oatholio interests, and as if they Were in alliappe with Protestantism for the 'tain of Oatholio influence. <Nev«r before has'Catholieientii inent 'or Oatholio principle held so cheap by Icings, counsellors, ahd advisers,Trotestant Or Catholic, whether in 5 Italy, or Austria, 6r tfranoe, or Spain ; and Protestantism, linked arm- in-arm with 'Its" first cousin, Free Thought, see: ' Iffljr oil, aS if Protestahts Snd utheists were become gaardiftu ati^Is, so mnch sS that Protestants might WeH" imagine that all Oatholio faalimy -had WT& 1 in" and oollapsed under superior Protestant pressure, ©hly see bow things are going in Gatjpflio France.

Afefcraotedly we shouid offer no objection to the bible as a reading book in schpol, provided it w«ire read with reverence, and .not knocked .about by the pupils. As a role we do not m^ike a sohool book of the bible ; we use Scripture Histories, ft interpretation to \vhich we look. ijij. Bradlaugh and Professor Huxley strenppusly advocated the retention of the [Protestant] bible in the London schools when iord (I forget his' titlej proposed to dispense .with it. These advocates 1 of the bible knew vreU what the/ wpre doing. Thfiy knew that the Protestant use cif .jthe bible had /only too often led the reader ulti» mate^y to disbelieve the important'faofcs and doptrinps it contained. Ifp obijd at sphppl ever yet learned its religion from the reading of the bible. Protestant children learn their religion at their mother's knpe, and from her living, speakipg lips. Children having got a knowledge of God t}nd of Christ ana ijhe ocpoifizion, and other things, by oral instruction and by learning their Catbckibm, may afterwards, at riper years, read the bible ; but their reading of it will always be tinged more or less by the earlier vivavoee instruction reoeived from parents or ministers. The Church of Christ' follows this rule. But, a? the bible can bear but one true interpretation, and as she alone is the "'keejicrpf Holy Writ," and its sole trrie expositor, fhe Catholic Churdh repudiates aha fdrbids all teaching of Scripture fezc^pt by herself and her own duly appointed interpreters: The SP®?,® 1 jlf pi? j its 'meaning one. " As a part of the gospel system the writings of the apostles haye but oh'e applicatioh. If there •06 tyo', one of them is a lie, ando fortiori in 20 contradiotory teachings or interpretations of the bible are all that more false by the Veijf nature of the case.' Thfe Charch of Gpd. His one true Oatholio'Chtirch, has one, And onlv one, interpretation for the Scriptures, and tb^t she gives in'her Catechism. In ber Cateohism she teadhes all the saving and essential doctrines of Qod referred to in Holy Soriptnre. She does not prove her mission or ^her doctrine by'Soripturfe. Stie proves these by her own living testimony, and, if we torn to' Scripture, 'wS there find that as she gpeaks now, so she spoke by the month and pen of St. John, or St; Paul, or St'.
