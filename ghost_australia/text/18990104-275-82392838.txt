. fHE PRIDE OF THE V POMMETS. ' CHAPTER IIâ€” (Continued.) ' ul daresay it's proper and' quite the thing that the Pomfretg should hare a ghost, or whatever you call her, but I would rather not see her again for my part,' said Olive, with a litile shudder. 'What a very cruel man her husband Was!' said Ainv. 'She deserved what she got. Sh'e was not fit to lie trusted wifch, liberty. He saved her from herself,' said. Guy sternly. 'He ought to have forgiven her and trusted her again,' said Amy, decidedly. 'She had shown herself unworthy of trust. I would have done the same in his place,' replied Guy. ? 'What a mercy you live in the nine teenth century, though I don't think a Pomfret, whenever he lived, could- lie for giving!' said Olive. 'But now to busi ness. What do you thank this wicked young woman looked so pleased about?' 'How should I know?' replied Guy, half-laughing. 'And, let me tell you, Olive, that your manner ia scarcely re spectftd to the family .ghost.' Then, as . Mrs. Denham entered the room, he left it, and proceeded to the library, where he found his father looking troubled and perplexed. 'This apparition has annoyed you, father,' said Guy, as he seated himself. 'It has. In my younger days I was in clined to laugh at the tradition, but I ihave seen the wraith, and each time trouble has followed ; and, to tell the truth, what has particularly annoyed me is that the wraith should appear the very night your Cousin Amy came here. It almost seems as though she would bring trouble.' 'Oh, no, father, she is too young and lovely to bring trouble.' 'Her mother was the same, yet, Heaven knows, she gave her father and me many a heartache. I hope my fears are groundless ; in fact, I believe they are. Still, the appearance of the wraith ihas upset me. Perhaps you will excuse me to the ladies, and tell them not to think about what they have seen.' 'Very well, father ; ' and Guy returned jfot-the drawing-room.
