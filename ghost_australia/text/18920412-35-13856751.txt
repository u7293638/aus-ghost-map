It is not truo that " lhere is always room at tho top," but it is to onsuro that tho road to tho top shall bo opon to all « ho ha\ o strength and skill to follow it that wo aro banded together as an association But, however wo moy strive, it is not within tho powor of us all to loa-h tho top, nor on reaching it is thore room for all who havo pro\ od thorasolv es worth} to stand Although it is true tint allait is us a delicate plant, which can thrive only m tho fostonug raj s ot peacof ul and prosperous timos, I am convinced the adverse poriod tho profession is experiencing is not onlj the result of commercial depression, hut is lnrgefv duo to the distrust of architecte shown by a largo number of the Fubho who should make uso of their services lins, tlnuk, is provod bj tho fact that between the 20lh February and the 2Uth March thoro were commenced in and around Sj dncy as many as 201 buildings of vanous kinda 1 or l61 of tlieso no architect was engaged, but tho plans » oro prepared either by tho builder or tho ow nor 1 ho remaining 10 plans w era prepared by others than tho builder or owuor, but ot thoso certainly not more than a do/on can justlj lay claim to the title of architect J_von assuming that thov could, wo still havo tho lamontablo fact that in slujhtlj o\ cr a month 201 buildings wore cimmenccd, of which 80 percout aro being cioctod without con tributiug in uuy w ay to tho adv ancomont of At t In prosperous timos tho uuuiher create 1 would, of courso, bo much lal ger, and piobably theproportion of archi- tects far higher but, granting this, I think w o may safolj assuma that under any conditions tho build- ings eulrustcd to builders alone w ould far outnumber tlioso placed uuder tho care of architcets Certainly, so\orul of tho works aro 8iiull, but ni o\erv caso tho client would havo gainod con sidornblj by tho employment of a trained orchitect Ono factor to bo considered is the disinclination of pooplo to build at all, from tho four (aitón, I regret to say, only too w eil grounded) that it is impossible for thom to know where thoir oxpo »es will ond lhoy wish for aplaco of thou own, so prefer to buy, and tho architect thus loses a client, and tho jorr j builder gains a customer TJnfoituuntclj, these instances are common enough and tend to prove that the architoet is not oniployod oxcopt in those cases w hore it is impossible to do without linn rho active forces operating against tho proiession may be biiotly suniiunriBod and placel under tho follow nig diusions -1st those which result from fiults within tho profession, and which thcrofoio lie within its power to remove 2nd 1 lioso w Inch result from tho prosont sjstem of work and winch architects, if thej will maj help to alter ord rhoaoresultingsolely from want or knowlodgo and mistaken mow s hold by tho public Of tho first diviaion-tlioso which result from faults w ithiu tho profossion-I need sa) but little for it is oulj needful to demand that all who claim the titlo of architect should possess the necos sary qualifications AS ithout doubt tho greatest hindrance to the profession is to bo found m the fact that the public have no me ins of judging who aro, and w ho aro not, trained architects During tho last eight jcais tho RIBA hu\e ondcavouied to remedy this by compelling all who w ishod to join ita rnnl s as associates to pass a \ cn exhaustivo o\omi nation , but the anomalj existed that tho rank of fellow remained us tho rank of associate had boen up till 1SS1-simply an houorar) title, and thcrotoie no indication of the skill possessed by tho holder Nor does the possession of the degreo bv those w ho had to win it through examination indicate m any w ay their relation to their lellows, for there nro as largo a uurabei of highly trained and talented aichitccts outbido the instituto as there aro within it It has been to mo lor many j cars a som co of w ondor that a law has not beeu passed compel- ling all w ho w ished to practise as architects to «how their fitness for the position A city is made or marred bj those who rructise the art ot aichitocturo v ltlnn it and although bad architecture is not, per- . haps, so harmful to the community as ruinous udv ico from unqualified law vers, or deathful treatment by unskilled doctors, vet w ithout question untrained architects do indict a very eonsiderable amount of injury upon the commui lty in which thoy livo not only by eovermg the land with ugly and inconvenient buildings, irom whieh no one eau possibly derivo pleasure, aud wlueh to many aro a source of pam, but also by creating distrust against all others who aro w oriung under tho same title I look forward therefore, to the tuno when architects, as w oil us doctors aud lawyers, shall bo compelled to show that thoy possess at least the minimum skill re- quired to cnablo thom to property pructiso their art A stop in this direction is boing made in Vietona, and I trust it will lead to success The practico of aiclnteeturo, lil o all othor positions of trust, is too often abused bj unscrupulous practi- tioners, and the know led¡,e of this often leads to a want of confioeuce in the w bolo profossion Tho high trust reposed in architects may bo abused by w mull j making tho work moro o_peiif.no than necessary in order to increase the commission by specif j ing the goods of manufacturéis w illing to allow him a poreout-go on thoir value rather th in specify ing those that are the best and by allowing the builder, foi a consideration, to execute tho work in a lesj efficient manner than was intended Although, as au association, w o can take no activ o part m oiadicutm^ thoso oula, it is no use shutting our eyes to tho fact that thoy exist All w o can do u to ensure that our youuger members aro inculcated w ith a truo knowledge ot tho otlues of professional hfo, aud to nibist that overyouo, while remain- ing a member, shall act up to that knowlodge Mr Seager next dealt with the professional rule that pajraoiit should bo by peicontago on the cost of work This rule, ho thought, acted most pre- judicial!} against tho profession In dealing with tho question of competition, Mr Scagor said Statements havo often boon mado by sonior mern bora of our piolcfsiou to tho oileot tnat the system of competition is a bad ono and should on no account be encouraged Against this v low I must, on behalf of tho j ouater members of tho profession, ontor my most earnest protest The only modo ot ensuring that mont shall bo recognised is by uniting all to contend for the pnze that is offered Competitions in the past ha\o been, in many cases, I admit, most lamentable but tho fuduro is not in the system, but in tho way it has boen carried out So long as tho plauo were submitted to building committeos and totally unqualified persons, justiee could not bo ex Sected nor success assured Iho only thing to omand is that thoy should not, undor any circum- stances bo presented to incompetent porsons but that thoso appointed to judgo thom should be thoroughly trained, impartial critics, having full knowledge of the requirements ol the caso, and tho wayinw Inch those requirements may bebest fulfilled Iho second division of causes-"thoso winch result from tho present mothod of w ork, and w hich archi- tects if thoy will, may help to altor"-ínvolvos questions upon which there may bo very considorablo difference of opinion The presont mothod in its simplest fora is, that the client tells the architect, who tolls tho builder, who tells tho workmon what is required From thiB it passes through vanous stages until in its commonest and most complicated form it Btands that the client instructs tho arohltect, tho architect his " ghost," Iiib ghost the elerk of works, tho clerk of works the builder, the buddor tho genoral foreman, tho genural foreman the fore men of tho different trudos w ho direct tho w orkmcii ns to what is required lo bo done-a mothod truly which cannot appeal to anyone as boingtho wisest that can be followed and one w Inch has boen held up to ndieulo by many ablo authorities and critics, wlio, while donounciug it, do not appear to havo suggested an alternativo which has mot with suffi- cient approval to w arrant its adoption It is beyond question of dispute that there aro too many porsons intervening botweon the inn d that conceives and tho hand that exooutos, an I tho numerous suggestions « Inch have beon mado mm at rcduomg the numbor m ono way or another lima _ orgussoii, aud I boliovo Ruskin also suggested doing away with the archi- tect as being a usoIosb individual who interfered with the art instincts of tho workmon io this naturally, tho arehiteots raised a strong protest and poiuted with reason (as w o aro able to do in Now .south Wales) te tho total absence of in lutoctuial art in any of thoeroitions of tho workmen Ho doing away with tho architoet is not tho remadj I would suggest Othors havo advised omitting tho builder from tho hat and tina has boon dono m 1 raneo where tho work has been earned out by sepal ate tradesmen acting uudor the direct control of the aichitoct In America the list is reduced by omission of the clerk of works, the arohltect himaolf directing operations through tho medium oi tho builder lu all thoso changos thero is an effort to return as fur us possible to the modii-val mothod oi working To day, when buildiuga of overy phaso of o\ orj Btylo of Art aro baing creeled coutom poraneouslv, the uoccs«itv for accurate and complete din wings exists m a still higher dogreo so that a return to the nicdmiv al manner is impossible, but I um tinnl) oonv mcod that the hope of lirclutoctttro lies in tlio diroetipu of as close a union as possible botweon the dceiguers and the vv orkors I folt this when 1 said last j ear that "the hand workers must do moro thinking, and tho brain woikera gain more practical knowledge, bo that there may bo a bread platform of common ground on which thov can moot while diligent!) cultivating thou special functions," and with the expononco which anothor v oar lins giv on me, I repeat it with grcator emphasis, tor I believe that in it líos tho gorm w Indi ma) do v olop into a sehoino capable of bo mug good fruit Iho devolojimont would make no provision for tho capitalist contractor as such, nor do 1 think a general contractor, ov cn if lie be a practical builder, a uoees sitv The lot of a contractor ia not such a happy ouo that any vv ould, I think, w ish te rotaiu it, pro \ idmg thoir sorvicos vv ero inado ubo of and properly remunerated in a less hazardous manner Is it not bitter irony to speak of a contractor as " successful " when nftor weeks, ofton months, of woausomo tendering he at last gains a work involving him in pecuniar) losses and ofton in rum ? 1 here aro m this lottei) prizes it is truo, but aro they not far out- numbered by tho blanks? Hie valuable services of the experienced and practical builder wo cannot alford to dispenso with, all that ia needful is that ho should add to his fund of technical know ledgo and pineticul oxpci|cnce, such knowledge in Art as may tit lum to become, in nomo and in fact vv hat in ti utli ho often is now m practice-tho architect's assistant Given, thou, tho architect thoroughly trained in art and with a good know- ledge of all technical details, and tho architect's assistant with a complete techni- cal training, practical expenonco, and a fair know- ledge of art, all that is required foi tho successful development of tho scheino I propose is, that overy workman-or preferably artisan-employed upou the building should bo thoroughly trained in his craft, aud hold a certificate to that effoct To this end tho valuable classes bold at tho Sydno) loclinic.il Col- lege aro leading, and vv ill, without a doubt, have a most beneficial lufiuenco upon ull building operations of tho future Undor tho excellent rulos of tho Metropolitan Board of iY ater bujipl) and Sow orage, tho plumbers and drainers havo already to giv o ev i donco of suflloiont skill before being allowed to oxocuto any works, and I trust tho timo is not far distaut when all workers m overy other craft will bo compellod to follow this example By ridding our cclvcs of incompetence from the highest te tho lowest grade of w orkors m the arts and crafts connected vv ith architecture, vv o shall hav o cloared away the greatest hindrance to successful progress In place of the contract system, I proposo that tho client himself should in all cases, as ho does now at times, becomo directly responsible for all expenditure, tho architect being solely responsible for the design and proper oxocution of the work throughout If the woik is small ho would instruct tho work mon directly, and dev ote such personal attention to tho work as it may require In largor vv orks ho w ould hav o tho help of his assistant architect, vv ho would perhaps devoto himself outiroly to one work, vi hilo in the largest buildings, where many workers of each craft are ouiplo) od, foremen of such crafts w ould bo necossnry But vv hutevor dotail arrange- ments may be found necessary, the main point is that everyone engaged upon tho work shall bo directly in the sorvico of the client, aud undor the direct, or as nearly as possiblo direct, control of tho architect The duties of tho different workerB undor tho proposed schemo would bo as follows -The architect vv ould rccoiv o instructions from his chont, preparo full and completo drawings for tho work and nn accurate estimate of cost If this ia ap- proved and the work proceeds ho would appoint lus assistant mid all other w orkers, mid jiorsonally direct their labours Ho or his assistant vv ould havo to prepare the ordors for all materials and check tho accounts, nnd render to the client ua account of all labour No payments would be inado through tho urchitect or an) ono having to ordor or use tho material but all should, if not made directly through the client, bo mado through a skilled accountant Whether the workmon should bo pnid by tho day or by tho piece depouds upon tho circum- stances aud nature of the work Wliorov or possiblo 1 should prefer payment b) the pieee, for then the client is assured of tho actual expenditure, and oach workman is paid equitably m aecordnnco with his skill and industry Such a schorao as this does not, perhaps, öfter such good opportunities for tho accumulation af wealth on the part of fortune s favourites, but what is ot infinitely greater importance is that it would ensure a more even distribution among actual nit workers that architectural operations vv ould ceaso to bo looked upon merel) as good commercial speculations, and that all engiged upon tho work would rocoivo a fair and honent return for their labours Under such coudit mis art eau flourish, and if it is too much to hope that they can bo fulfilled in tho near future, vv o can at least look forward to their fulfilment as a goal wo should stnvo to roach The third division of causea in operation-that embracing " Want of know- ledge and mist.il cn views held bv the pubbc," isa far reaching one, and one it is impossible to more than planee nt to-night Nothing can bo moro pre- judicial to ort than want of intelligent appreciation on tho part of thoso for whom tho w ork is pr ducod Not only should our chants bo able to nppi eciate nn artistic work, but they should havo knovvledgosuib ciont to enable thom to toll why thev do so How different it would betf a general knowledgo of archi- tecture w as included m the curriculum of tho High Schools and Universities With an educated pubfio a process of natural selection would at once com- mence the untrained practitioner would havo to stand aside, and those only who had proved thein solves host fitted to hold tho titlo of arclutect suivivo This disrcgaid for all but the art of literature vv hich ia foatoiod at our universities follows the largo majority of its giaduatos through lue, notvvith Btanding that with the parent art of architecture ovcryouo is biought into some degrco of relationship Our univoisities should not onl) próvido a course of lectures upon architecture for those who iutond to make practical use of it, but should also provide a course taking a wide viow of tho Ano arts as a wholo-Ihoir lustoiy, evolution, and fundamental principles, full) illustrated by v lows diagrams and models This com so all those working for a dogreo should bo compellod to attend And tho primary and eecoudary schools might also contribute by tho teaching of art m conjunction with drawing, which is now a compulsory subject In place of tho meaningless and often ugly formB that children aro now required to represent, each lesson in drawing should com oy some definite idea in art which should be elucidated by tho teacher m a manner suitable to the intelligence of the scholar I endeavoured to ombodv tina schomo in a senos of drawing booka prepared tor the use of Government schools in Now yeoland Ihcso havo mot with tho approval of Mr F W AVoodhouae, the Superintendent of Dravvmg for tho Government of Now South AVales, m whoso ab o hands w b ean safely leave this branch of the question in tho knowledge that bia interest and skill in aiehitectuml and other branches of art will lead to mi) dev elopmeut which may bo possiblo Tho address was listened to with nttentiv o interest, and was frequontlv cheered Discussion followed, and on tho motion of Dr Garran, seconded bv Mr Arernon, the president was accorded a hearty v oto of thanks _^^
