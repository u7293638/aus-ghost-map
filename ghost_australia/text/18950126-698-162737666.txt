Kosciusko by Moonlight. From Walleragang, Upper Murray (The view from Walleragang homestead, the residence of Thos. Paton, Esq., is probably unique of its kind in the colonies.) The vale is gladdened from above, whence floods of - glory fall; Where none but major stars resist the mistress light of all. Up the long glen of Cudgewa the brightness bursts as fast. As though the murky Styx had pierced a paradise at last. A triple thousand miles await the new-born Mur ray's tide ; ? r ' Which prattles here, o'er pebbled shoals, its deeper 1 strength will-hide. I It springs from yon resourceful snows, that yield their copious boon Where Kosciusko's creamy crest repels the pouring moon. ! i How the grey monarch fills the eye ! How looms his monster form ! | His great stone ribs could pen the power of a plutonic ! storm. Slope after slope and cliff on cliff succeed, until they rise To where the mammoth brow appears to bear the brooding skies. Up from the gloom of gullies gaunt I Up from the dark below ! Up from the shadows round his feet! \Up to the glist'ning snow ! So, many souls with baser parts to blackest horror given Have yet white heights that risB through all, to meet the kiss of heaveo. The land is .full of mystic life acrossthe Alpine chain, Great shapes are creeping, like the ghosts of aspira tions slain. '? r J- -From hidden homes, sweet magic lures a lustrous, fairy throng, '? : And weaves a thousand witcheriesâ€” intangible, yet' strong. But soon the tyrant, staring sun willscan his subject sphere, ' - And all the noble genii of night will disappear. So, too, the Titan, thoughts that come to fule and raise my heart J ; Before temptation's torrid glance will dwindle and depart. Caen. Poole, Tumberumba, December 11, 189i.
