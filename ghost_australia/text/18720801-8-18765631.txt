THE IMERNATK» \L BOAT-R \CC The Iong-looked-for event esme off on June 10 amidst an iranienne number of spectator*. The in- terest created b} the contest has scared} been ex- ceeded b} the matches of the Univer it} crow* tis even available «pot on the mer where a Bight co aid be obtained was occupied from an earl} hour of the da} The Londoners got afloat in their Clamper at ten minutes past six, the Atalantas following suit some ten or twlvo minutes later and both crews paddled at once down to their stations, amid a burst of cheenng from the steamboats nnd the bank" The London men, having won the toss for choice of stations, selected the Middlesex berth, which under ordinary circumstances is deci ledlv the moro favour- able of the tw o, the inside boat having the benefit of the bend nil the wa} down to the rajlway budge but on Jionda} this advantage was in some degree counterbalanced bv the wind, which

failed to elicit a single response In accordance with prev íous arrangemente the crews were started hy report of pistol, instead of word of mouth, and direct I > the competitors bad taken up their respective positions, Mr Lesle}, the referee bating put the customary 'previous question," without receiving an} answer, gate the signal to go at twent} uçjit minutes past BIT Both crews caught the wattr at tlio samo moment, but at the second stroke the Londoners, settling down to their work with a rapidit} th it seemed literall} to electrif} the spectators, shot at once to the fore, and coming right awaj, as though the others were standing still drew theraseh es clear in les than a dozen strokes Just below the Slap the leaders began to edge out into mid stream, and took their opponents* water, both crews making a considerable detour in the direction of the Surrey shore hut off the Brewer} the Londoners, whom we timed at this point to be rowing fort} strokes a minute to their opponents' fort} four, straightened their boat and returned to their proper course with a lead of a clear length At Barnes Rail wa\ -bridge, which was reached in 3 minutes l8 seconds from the start Landon had increased their advantage to nearl} three length«, and settling down into a long stead} drag of between thirt} cix and thirtv «even to the minute, continued to leave the Amencans hand- over-hand in unmibtakeable st}le Off the Bulls Head a bit of erratic steering on the pait of the leaders enihlcd the others to hold their own for the next hundred }ar crew, notwithstanding the dispartt\ of stroke, \\\ero asain perceptibly drawing awn}, and off the Bathing place in the Dukes Meadows led b} at least half a-dozen lengths Here the seventy of the pace began to tell the intutible t?le upon the Atilinta crew, one or two of whom at this earl} stage of the struggle-if, indeed, it descne the name-began to evince umnistakeable s}mptoms of distress and their rowing lost all trace of the michine-hke pre- cision and régulant} which had charactered it during the earl} part of the mee, in fnct, there is little doubt that the men were complete!} taken aback und demorilised b} the astounding rapiditv with which the Londoners had left them at the start The\, nevertheless, struggled on in the gnme=t poasiblemnnnei, and, though palpabl} beaten and falling all to pieces ever} moment, maintained their fort} to the minute with unflinching determi- nation but it was all in vam, as the Londoners, i who were now rowing ei^ilv within themselves, | continued steidil} to improve lliur portion as the} progressed, nnd at the upper end ot Chiswick E}ot the} were full} ten lengths to the good Rounding the bend they continued to draw still further in I front with ever} stroke, dilston taking them a . capital coût se-indeed, thev could not have been better steered if the} hid cirned a coxswain in their stern sheets, nnd at Hammersmith Bridge led, as nenrl} as we could judge, b} a dozen length«" the difference between the two boats as the} shot the centre span being exactl} 30 seconda, and the time of the lenders from the stnrt 12 minutes 28 second« All now was clearl} over, bar accident but as bad luck would have it, at this stage of the race a mishap did actual!} occur, which of itself was suffi- cient!} aggravating, though hnppil} it did not in an} wa} affect the result Midwa} between the bridge and the soapworks a heav} watermans skiff, with a cargo of duffers on board, drov e broadside on against the bow oars of the american boat, completel} stop- ping them for a second or two, and losing them at least a couple of length" It was a most provoking conti Uemp of tho race would have been e\ceflsi\ely anno}ing, but, as it happened, the Americans vveie nt the ime such a hopeless distance astern that the most bigoted partisan could not possibl} regard the mishap as having interfered even in the remotest degree with their chance of winning On getting clear the} went in pursuit of the Londoner», but the lat- ter were now some fourteen or fifteen lengths m front, and ultimatel} passed the winning post, which was situated midway between the steamboat pier and the Aqueduct, some two hundred and fifty }ards-or exactly fort} four seconds-in advance of the \talantas-the time from start to finish being 21 minutes 2G seconds The record of the race finishes its own commen- tary-and further remarks are needles The Amè- ne ins were palpabl} outclassed and outpaced, and from start to finish never stood the ghost of a chance, notwithstanding that the} rowed a consider- aba quicker stroke throughout In such companv, however, defeat entails no disgrace, for it wns their ill luck to have to encounter one of the best and fastest fours ov er seen on the Thames, and one which we funcv will give a good account oí the smartest profesional crew of modern time« The chief interest of the above race has little con- cern with the result B} rowing men of an} know- ledge or experience that was known long ago N.ever before m the annals of boating has a crew gone to the starting post with stronger assurâmes of succecs than belonged to the London lour In their st}le and power of endurance, the art and s}stem of row ing found almost faultle s expre«non Their oppo- nents were in an earlier stage of development lliey lacked bound know ledge of the art, nnd had not made it sufiictentl} matter of stud} to know thorough]} all its resources This is the simple and onl} possible explanation of their failure There is no need to seek a «olution of a reisonable result in vague talk about differences of national character But there ia one point connected with the race, indi eating a previous difference of method between tho rowing men of the two countries which is well worth attention Tin» contest in «oma ^en^o opens a new era in English rowing Hitherto it h is been held that the additional weight of a coxswain was full} counterbalanced b} his usefulness in the boat The amencans lnv e held a different uew, and the introduction of the American s}stein is hkel} to strongl} modif} our previous notion Besides the cred/t of having rowed a gallant race, the Atalanta crew deserve the thanks of English rowing men for hav mg taught them the advantage of a new s} stem Whether on narrow nvers rowing without cox»wains will become universal, is a doubtful question, hut improved contrivances ma} do much towards utili- sing still further the Amencan idea. So far as the race had any national significance, it is another vic- tor} for England, but the patnotic feeling wns not aroused untü quite late, and the Atalanta crew need not feel any very heav} responsihdit} in thus having allowed their nation to he defeated.
