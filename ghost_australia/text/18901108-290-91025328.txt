[?] CN GLOAMING GBASBE8. The light is kvtipon tbe land, The «iog« of dock are nigh. Upon the gloamiojr grasses stand, Together, you and t. Why do we wait together so ? I weald we were apart, For yon may give me more of woe And break again my heart. Yc t, low as ennset in the hill*. So law my pake for tbee, Tby glance no vein with rapture fills, Kn rauion ecata*V. Teup'rate as ebadows ooally Iain Aboat tbe cartb'd dark breait, . Sn Ho I meet Ihy gaze again, Untroubled and at rest. Why afconld I Bee reproaching ejea ? Ko Pi asoix heart ia mine. From dead white asbea up to rue KespoDaively to Ihioe. ?? Wbj thoela X tnonm to eight for thes? I wetn nc pity lay Within yonr faithless breast for me Tbe night yon went away. Level I bave preyed for us to stand Jabt as we stand to night. And yearnicg bo, yonr touching hand Bad filled my soul with light. But praying dayB bave passed for me And weeping nights grown still. Till freely now is given thee Forgiveness and goodwill. Kay, breathe no lie upon my faitb, Tbe heart yon beld was true ; Who bears tbe blame, that passion'* wraith With wan eyes look st yon? Who bears the blame that I do hold Spent fires where flames did start? For yon did torn the embers cold When yon did break my heart, So in the sundown shadows take My answer to yonr claim— Sweet love in ashes will not wake . Howe'er yon call her name. Wbcn gloauurg grasses gather dew In eome far evening's light — Remember then tbe ghost yon slew ^ Teat walked the earth tonight. f ^^ .^ S— — i— B— B»
