Colonel Hamlet had been affianced for some time to Miss Ophelia Poloniaa, daughter of Judge Polonius, of the Supreme Court of Denmark. Colonel Hamlet imagined he had heard a mouse behind a screen, and, seizing a carv ing-knife from the dinner-table, plunged jt into the screen, behind which Judge Polonius waa concealed, to keep Colonel Hamlet from mischief. Judge Polonius was killed by the knife. An evening or so afterward, at some private theatricals, Colonel Hamlet behaved so rudely that hia mother, unole, and Miss Ophelia Polonius were compelled to leave the room. Colonel Hamlet's conduct so preyed upon Miss Ophelia that she drowned herself. At her burial Colonel Hamlet jumped into the grave, and her brother following him, a most unseemly fight took place, resulting in the two drawing knives and stabbing each other, and, just before dropping. Colonel Hamlet stabbing his uncle, James 6. Hamlet. All threo died.— Puck. I
