A ITiVEf,07 C(OR P . ?'HERE is no telling wh a n party it -Labsolutely dead in the Unilod States. A few years ago it was implicitly belioved by some people that the I)elocracy was dead. Just now the same plediction is being made in regard to Ithe Republican party. Whenever we read in a Republican paper that the D)omocracy is dead, or vice versa, 'we are very much reminded of that yarn about Shockors. A man named William I). Shuockers died in Wilmnington.
