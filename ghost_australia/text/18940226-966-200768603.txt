THE CYCLORA.MA. The Cyclorama of Waterloo has thoroughly established itself as a favourite resort for Adelaide people as will as visiters from the oountry and the other oolonies. Mr. Lockley's graphic lectures, his intelligent and enthu siastic description of the thrilling events, never fail to interest his auditors. The beau-' tiful foreground under bis oare is being constantly improved and matched to the beautiful picture. The management has good reason to congratulate itself on the sucjeas of its introduction of Napoleon's ghost and the fairy fountain, which evoke nig-htly expressions of the warmest approbation.
