POLITICS IN AMERICA. THE GOLD STANDARD. BRYANITES IN A PITIABLE CON- DITION. (FROM OUR CORRESPONDENT.) NEW YORK, Dec. 22. Both Houses of the new Congress, in session for the past two weeks, are in har- mony with the President with respect to his policy concerning Cuba and our new insular possessions, and also with regard to other important questions. The first part of this harmonious agreement is seen in the prompt passage in the House of a bill clearly declaring gold (the dollar of the present weight and fineness) to be the standard of our currency. It has been the standard since 1873 at least, but an em- phatic affirmation of this fact was much to be desired, owing to the attempts in re- cent years to undermine the standard by dangerous silver legislation, and because some Americans were in doubt about it. liesides, it vi is desu iblc that thtie should be ntw hw s to embie Hie Cov eminent to maintain the stand nil in Innes of slitss Jins House lull continua ptovisiotv- lol thnt pulposo I he lcdcmplion leseive is to bo gil udec!, the lie lsuiv is empoweicel to le plcnihh it mid ii cuniiot be eli lined out mel exhausted b) Wini lins been ctiled the tndltss ih mi oi itptatul itdeuip lions of United Sti tes notts I icy omi some 1 lov isions vv Indi will tend to lnticise slightly the volume of n itton ti li ink notes m cirtuhtion, the lull docs not attempt to lefoun oui pattlivunl tun cut v 01 give it distict.) to meet Hie val vine deni mels of bit sines« nnil tin se ison» 1 ot this Hitit is leqimod a thoiouji ltoigmis itton upon the basis of lcgisl ition permitting bulks to issue nolts on the euuilv of conimcicial as els Suth legtsl ition could not be pas-ed now I his Doust Gold St ind ud Bill with some modtficalioiis not afltttuig ita clutt lim pose will bo pissed in the Señale be ioic Much 1 lu tint body Hitic is no longei i silvei inijoutv In the House ill the J.tpubltt ins and 11 Dtmotnts voted lot tht bill and it wnti i unions conici dence that immediately altei Hie decision loi m il aiinotmccnitnl was in ide ot the de iib of Htpiesent ittvt Kichird P Bl mel, who beg in the fight toi Hu lite tom igt of silvti 2! veins igo, and was tho most conspicuous (iginc on Hie silvu stile until Hu in cup.ivu.tcd a nation il convention m 1-ÜÜ by his clociuctut HI uni is dead and Hit silvoi st munni is buiicd with linn \ good ami saint uy tlnnge ni the atti tuile of the Ktpiibliiui ;iiu tv tow trds tins fines-ion is to bt noted live vi us ago Hie pirti leaders witt nfi ml to uttei Hit wold t.ohl riley weie tuend, ot sil vci stuvuig nftei linnetillism md intet n iiioiml tom igt ii reuiitnt«, ind itidy to toauliatt the silvu nun by ill suits c1 enmpioiinses \li M Ivtnlcv himself oui) u lew jems ago denounced Pitsidtiil Gltve lind lietniise Ins at!limit low irel the epics lion of Hie st indaiel vt is whit Ins own is it the picstnl time Hut the lit publie nu pitty is on finn ground now J he silvei ghost will walk no more 'Hie open lev oit of 11 Ocinoti ils ni the House would have uivolvid t hugel mun bei if the lime» question ot the flee coinage of «llvu al the mt ion of Ki to 1 (still the chief tenet ot Hie Iir).unte Democintic p.utv) could baie been submitted to a vote 'J bat p.ntv is now in a pituliiu ton ditton A majoiilv would like to get nil ot the old hilvei dodiine, but seo no wav e.isilv tolloso Besides, thov have nothing to put in its pluie Attempts to substitute opposition to "tilist nimbin,ilion«, and the Republican, colonial, 01 expansion police, li iv e tims f.u cunio to nothing Both pal ties onjio-e ti lists, and neithei suggestb ant reisonable lenicdv foi them A huge tuujoiit) of Hie» people .ippiove the .icquisi tion of Poilo Pico, and Hie Philippine«!, and Congie»s will piob.ib!) in the neal iittuie nunnie foi taking one of the Galla pucos ful mil« (oft the co ist ot Ocu.idoi ), and, possiblt, loi the pinchase ol the Dam di West indies, as will as foi the at tentante of tile S uno m island of Intiiili I ho Piesident's nie»««,ige, in Hie puits îe latiiig to Hie tolonial policv, contmnod nolliuig novel oi stnking, bevoiid eel Unit i ti omiuend liions adoiil laud He tunis Hie «tidjitt otei lu Congitss, but he will be pu nutted to piocced upon his picsuit lints 'lb.it is to «,iv, he will suppiess the J il i pino iiisuiiK lion und ist idhsh munni pill cnviinmiuts whuetci this is pine Heal le Hit isl nuls aie ouïs In savs lind we ought to lttep them Congiess lgiees willi lum lliout this We must lcccp oin !
