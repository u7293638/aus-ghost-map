ORIGINAL POETRY. MEDITATIONS. In my solitary cabin, Par up in .ho lonely hills, Thoughts will rise of boyhood pleasures, And my heart with sorrow mis. . Thoro I mink at times of people— Men and women, young and old— Who have grasped my hand in friendship— Now they’re lying still and cold. And in dreams I’ve often mot them;' Yet I never thought it strange, Seeing them as last I saw them— Seeing them without a change. ’Tis but a trick of human brain, ’Twill but a moment last, Yet makes us see at present Things we have seen in the past. And plainly, clearly, we behold The people long since dead, And talk to them—not think of ghosts, Nor stand aloof in- dread. But, let us meet them when awake— Will any be so brave As take the hand we know for years Lay mouldering in the grave ? Alas! we all recoil from death ; Yet nothing is 60 sure— Whate’er may be our rank on earth, We know wo must endure That last great pang, the fate of all, From which no man can flee, For man must dio ; lot all bo brave, And bow to that decree. But some have lived for many years— Had time to think it o’er— Yet very few have welcomed death When knocking at their door. For nature is the stronger power, And, reason how we will, We stand appalled to contemplate What we must all fulfil! Cr. Swstu, xjBKtiaie. . i
