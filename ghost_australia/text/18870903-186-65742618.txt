6Iulta'si Column. PERLEY'S SPECULATIONS. [By Mary Dessel.] Past L [From Harper'* YouiiQ People] The beginning of it all was when Fanner Giddings gave L'erley Paine a rooster, a ben, and their youthful daughter, a lank, long legged, half-grown chicken. ' Being as it's the twenty -second of Feb ruary, yon might call 'em George and Martha \\\ asbington and tbe Hatchet, sug gested Mr. Giddings. Perley accepted the gift with mingled gratitude and disapproval. He sit eyeing tbe Bcrawny group gloomily, until the . lutcbct lurched suddenly forward to catch a belaU-d winter fly ; upon which George gave vent to a melancholy crow, and Martha cackled hoarsely. Percy's face brightened. ** I'U make something out of yon yet, you wretched skeletons,' said he, with energy. And indeed, in less than a month, plenty of corn and grain and Indian meal Ha^ wrought a miracle. George became pi amp and shining ; his wattles waxed fierce and red. The Hatchet grew fat and spry. As for Martha, she began to lay eggs at a famous rate. ' One — two —six — ten ; I declare there are a dozen eggs,' counted Perley. 'Now we'll begin business. ' So early next morning he appeared at Squire Allen's door. 'I thought, Mrs. Allen,' began Perley, when {that rosy, happy -faced lady came to greet him — 'I thought maybe you'd bay eggs of me this spring. Eggs are twenty-five cents a dozen at the stores ; bat I Uke to go 00 another — haul*. Suppose I bring you at least a dozen eggs every other Sitarday. If 1 bring them promptly, you give me thirty why, you only give me twenty cents a dozen Maybe Til make five cents and you'll loee ; maybe you'll make and I'll lose. Speculation, you *-ee. Can't we trade ?' Mrs. Alien, being very obliging, and also fond of her lively young neighbour, ' traded.' For two months she bought Perley's eggs, and the balance was nearly even. Martha was diligent and attentive to her business ; sc- if she fell sbort one fortnight, sbe amply made up in the next. If Perley cami; crestfallen with only six eggs on one Saturday, he was sure to appear with a dozen and a half before long. Trade flourished and decreased, and Perley was either jubilant or in trouble. Still, it was exciting. More so, he was sure st the regular market valae, and rtja no risks. 'Begin with eggs, end with railroads and Bank stock,' mused Perley. ' Speculation's the business for me.' But suddenlv a dire calamity befell. Night after nigbt there was confusion in the hen house ; a hubbub; evidently a battle; for more than once Perley found broken eggs and scattered feather*. \Vbo or what was the enemy ? In vain Perley tried to discover. The affair became very serions. Trade languished voially by reason of those broken ejrga. At last, one moonlight evening, when Perley was on watch, a pretty black and white creature was seen creeping hlvly along. At first Perley thought tt a kitten, but a strong odour came, wafted on the breeze. ' If it were only a fox or a weazel,' groaned Perley ; ' but to be robbed by a Perley set a trap. The shrewdest sinner of the genus mephitis walked round it and over it, but never into it. Perley tried poison. The wily thief sniffed at it, and broke two extra eggs to pay for the insult, whOe— oh, misery !— George was found next morning stiff and stark, having pecked at the Btrych nine and given up the ghost. In rage and despair Perley caught the afflicted Martha under one arm, tacked : Hatchet under the other, and marched to Mrs. Mien. 'It's no use,' said he, bitterly. 'You must raise your own eggs, ma'am. If you'll : give me a dollar and a half you can have J both these fowls.' [ Mrs. Allen had the softest heart in tbe world, so the money was placed in Perley's hand. He was walking slowly home there with, and thinking how he shoald miss the ' fun of ''trade,' especially now when his gains were growing faster than his losses when he met Billy O'Grafferty coming round a corner nibbling a pea not. Now Perley had a speaking acquaintance with Master O'Grafferty, as opposing Generals may recognise and respect one another for mntual courage and prowess. Billy was the leader of the Irish gentry of O'Grafferty Court, between whom and the High-School boys was a good-natured bat perpetual war fare. Perley was the uptown Captain, and | many were the hand-to-hand tussels he bad had with the hard-fisted Billy. But as they were equal in point of bruises and valour, Perley could afford a gracious ' How are you ?' and Billy was prompt with bis equally condescending ' Hollo ! have a pay-uat?' ' Where did you get them ?' asked Perley, seeing that Billy's pockeks were full to over ' Captain Byles's ship's in. Down to Emery's Wharf. He's got a bag o' nuts. Giving of 'em away, he is.' Parley's mind gave a quick jump this way and that way, and he was rushing towards Emery's Wharf. What could be the secret which Perley was pouring into Captain Byles's ear, and which made the jolly captain throw back his head and roar with merriment? Then Perley would catch the captain's vest button and eagerly whisper something more, and again the wharf would fairly ring with peals of laughter. ' I shall double my capital in do time,' ended Perley. 'Come now, captain.' ' Bless my soul !' shouted the captain. ''Doable my capital!' Well, you be a sharp youngster. Not another nut shall yon boys have. Off with you. Trade's the word ; speculation's the ideas. Ha 1 ha ! ha- a-a !' There was more mystery yet ; there was a canvas bag ; there was a rattling of nuts ; there was a slipping of three fifty-cent pieces into Ciptain Byles's pocket ! there was a hurried ' Good lack to you !' and Perley was running off as fast as he had come, leaving the captain to rub his hands and chuckle. 11 Sharp little chap ! Ha ! ha ! ha-a-a !' The very next day, as dnsk came on, Mis. Paine was coming home laden with bundles from a shopping expedition, when the flare of an oil-torch met her eyes. ' Pea-nuts 1 fresh, hot pea-nuts t' The voice sounded familiar, and what should meet her bewildered gaze bat the face and form of her own eon behind a shabby deal table at the corner of the street ! There he stood, in shrill accents exhorting the passers to ** Buy my pea-nnts — ten cents a qu-a-art !' ** Perley Paine, what are you doing ?' Perley started, blushed, hesitated. ' Why, selling pea-nuts, mother. I bought them cheap. (EicuBe me. Pea-nuts did you say, sonny ? One pint ? Five cents ? Call again. J Captain Byies sold me fifty quarts for one dollar I sell them at — (Oh, Judge Western! Two quarts? Yes, sir; thank yoa. Trade is brisk)— at ten cents a quart, mother. I'd gain three dollars and a half if I didn't have to pay Billy O'Grafferty fifty tending shop. Dsuaily I don't sell ; I only keep the books. To-night Billy has the toothache, so I take ten cents off hiq regular pay for a* sence. He says it's mean ; I say it's business. Tbe whole affair's a speculation, mother ; for if the regular pea nut man on Congress -street finds me oat, he'll lower his price, and that's the end of me.' Mrs. Paine walked slowly home, shaking her head. Should she stop Perley's wild scheme * But she was a wise woman. 'The boy must learn by experience ; and he's bis father's ton. Til trust him.' So she only kept her eyes wide open, but said no word, even when, at the end of a week, Perley came home with a severe cold and aching throat. ' But its worth it, mother,' he cried, triumphantly. ' I've cleared two dollars and ninety cents. That's nearly as much as I doped. The regular pea-nut man got wind of it, aud the hoys cuine to jter over me, but I snapped tny fingers at them and showed them my empty bag.' He bore the discomfort of his sore throat bravely, and said not a word of complaint when a whole nigbt he lay awake feverish and ill. But a hotter fever than any mere cold could bring was in Perley's veins — the fever which has consumed many an older and wiser person. His mother was somewhat amazed when, a few da} s Inter, as the ladies of the Chnrch ' guild' were planning for a little sale, Pei ley drew her one bide and whispered, ' Persuade them to have it in Fluent Hall, ' Bat' why in Fluent Hali?' ' It's z—xpteidalion,' answered Perley. '* I knew people would be having fairs and sociables, so Mr. Fluent and I are in jtarttur *hip, mother. I'll let that hull to you for ten dollars, mother ! Ah, now, ilo say 'yes.' ' Mrs. Paine looked troubled, but her boy's face was so eager that she only said, aloud this time, ' You are your father's son Perley ; remember that I shall trnst you.' Perley had gone to Mr. Fluent with a small green bank-book in bis hand. Said he — *' My uncle John put one hundred dollars in the Bank for me. He told me the day might come when a hundred dollar* would do me a deal of good. The day has come. Wfll you rent your ball to me for that snm, if I take it for four months ? You can hold the book, Mr. Fluent.' But Mr. Fluent conld drive a bargain as well ae his questioner. ' Call it a hundred and twenty, and give me twenty dollars down in cash, and you shall have the hall,' said he. Twenty dollars down ? Where could Perley raise twenty dollars ♦ But the very idea of/— - dealing no longer in pennies, nor even ia five- J^f d*Uar schemes, but actually in the twenties, ~^& even in a hundred dollars, fired Perley'* ^H' imagination. So he made a certain journey ^p to 'Fore-street, but never a word did he ^ breathe at home in regard to his pretty silver watch, which he had left in the dirty hands of Isaac Schryver, tbe pawnbroker. But toon another worry swallowed up the fear that his mother should notice the watch's absence, aod inquire its whereabouts. Fluent Hall must be rented at least twelve times to give him back his money. It would be a sorry day if ever he had to draw his hundred dollars out of the Bank. One would think that be would have accepted bis uncle John's offer of twenty dollars for taking -barge at his furnace this coming winter ; but Perley had loftier schemes than mere drud gery. In the first place he was full of a plan for two ' exhibitions.' Not that he himself meant to take part, but if he conld persuade bis classmates to act a couple of playa and raise money for a new piano, what place bo well adapted for the performance as Fluent Hall ? He could be his own door-keeper, and so, first and foremost, secure each night his Dwn ten dollars. One morning in November Mrs. Paine wondered at Beeing a bevy of boys perching on her fence and clustering round her door Bteps. She recognised Master O'Grafferty and several of his cronies among the number. ' Fifteen cents apiece, and mind you're on band bright and early,' she heard Perley say. All the lads sang oat 'Ay ! ay !' while Billy added, ' We'll have the fightin' for a more convaynient s'ason, Perley. Can't be a-hittin* of the boss, ye know.' Mrs. Paine raised her eyebrowa inquiringly as Perley came into the room, and that worthy replied with a nod — ' Specnlaticu, mother. Eight gentlemen have promised me the shovelling of the snow from their sidewalks for the season. Six dollars apiece.' ** But you can't shovel eight sidewalks ia the season after every storm. ** Of course I can't, sweet 'ip*'''*. That* s the very point. Didn't you hear Billy call me the boss? Those eight chaps are ray— menials. I pay them fifteen cents apiece for every job. If its an open winter, I make money. If the snow comes often, so wiih»1i the worse for me.' 'Oh, Perley ! Perley 1' eried his mother. 'The risk ? ' ' It't the risk that's the very marrow of it all !' cried Perley, and off he went to argue with Harvey Danforth, and persuade him to take part in the exhibition which the school boys and girls had consented to give. It would be most trying if Harvey refused to act, for tbe Danfords were leading mem bers of the Unitarian Society, who were to give a series of coffee parties. If Harvey consented to s-pcak ** Sp&rbtcns; to the Roman Envoys,' Harvey's grown- up sister would come to rehearsal. She would thus see what a capital place Fluent Hall would be for — coffee parties. You perceive that there were wheels within wheels in the machinery which Perley was trying to manage. Abu ! these same wheels refused to work smoothly. When Perley came home that evening his face was as black as a thunder* cloud. Most unfortunate his plans regarding the coffee parties had leaked oat, and Harvey Danforth bad turned upon him like a fift»h *' So that's the reason you've been wheedling me to do ' Spartacus,' and mnIHng believe I was a second Booth. I'd be ashamed to pull wires in that fashion. They're going to have their coffee parties in parlours, so yoa needn't hang round me with yoar soft speeches.' Every one knew that Harvey Danforth was an ill-natured boy ; but none the less Perley was nearly beside himself at the insult, and his temper was perhaps hardly soothed by finding, when be awoke the next morning, that the air was thick with snow- flakes. (To be Continued.) Alderman John Ross has met with a shock ing death from drowning at Wiif-annfa He was returning home about midnight, the night being dark and windy, and it is con jectured that he wished to call and see the captain of the steamer I'dwards, and that his cap blew off, and in following it he fell over tbe embankment into the river. His cap was found next morning some little distance away which gave rise to tlic suspicion of bis having been drowned. The police at once dragged « the river and found the body after about an hoar's search in (ift, of water, and close to tbe bank. Deceased was the oldest resident in Wilcannia, and has always taken a pro minent part iu local and municipal affairs. A correspondent of the Enjtiah Magazine says : — ' Let all of ' ours ' know the following : My wife has suffered occasionally with acute rheumatism in her feet, with painful swelling, completely taking her off tier feet for many days at a time. The following remedy was recommended recently and tritd, and took away the agonising pain in less than fifteen minutes, and she can now walk very fairly, and in a couple of days she will be able to - button her boots and walk without a stick or * crutch. One quart of milk, quite hot, into I which stir loz. of alum. This makes curds I and whey. Bathe the part affected with the ^ whey until too cold* \n. the meantime keep the curds hot, and after bathing put them on as a poultice, wrap in flannel, and — go to sleep (you can). Three applications should be a perfect core, even in aggravated cases.'
