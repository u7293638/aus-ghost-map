, LAVENDER. | The waving oorn .was green and gold, j The damask roses blown, I The. bees and busy spinning-wheel, I Kept np a drowsy drone— ' When Mistress Standish, folding down Botween it laid the lavendor, One snmmer long ago. The slender spikes of greyish-green, Stili moist with morning dew, Recalled .a garden sweet with bo . Boyond the oooan's blue. An English gardon, quaint and old, She nevermore might know ; And so she droppod a homesick tesr That mmmor long ago. The yellow sheets grew worn and thin, And) fell' in many a shred ; Bome'wont to bind a soldier's wounds, And some to shroud tho dead. And Mistress Standish rests tier soul Where graves their shadows throw And violots blossom, planted there In summers long ago, Bnt Btill botweon tho royal ross ' And lady-lily tall 1 Springs np the modest lavender Beside tbscottage wail. The spider spreads her gossamer Across it to and fro— .The ghost of linen laid to bleach One summer long' ago.
