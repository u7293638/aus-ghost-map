THE STAWELL GHOST. A peculiar case of supposed ghoBtly visitation has just been cleared up at Stawell. Mr?. Williams, residiug in Ligar-street, has for some weeks been very much alarmed by peculiar noises and voices proceeding apparently from various parts of the house both during night and day. At night also the furniture has been displaced. List Friday night the voice become very offensive in its remarks, and some neighbors were sent for, who in turn sent for the police. When Constable Fitzmaurice arrived, a voice, seemingly from the chimney asked him what be wanted. The chimney was searched, but no clue to the mystery was obtained, and the voice next came from under the floor. The boards were pulled up ; but nothing was found. The place was kept under surveillance on Saturday, and at night a large crowd, composed of business men and others, assembled at the place without, however, being able to elucidate the mystery. Sunday, ateo, was uneventful, though the sounds were still heard, and the town was in quite a state of excitement. Last Monday night, however, the mystery was cleared up. Mrs. Williams has a granddaughter living with her, a child between 11 and 12 years, and this precocious juvenile has confessed that she is a ventriloquist, and was the cause of the trouble, and so ends the mystery of the Stawell ghost. Despatches from Rome, dated November 9, represent Pope Leo 13th as looking feeble and worn. Access to him has been forbidden by the physician.
