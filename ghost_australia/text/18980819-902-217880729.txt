Oban Electors. Sir,— ;T notice in your, issue of tlie 12th iust a letter from Mr. Wetherspoon, iu which he refers to Obau in a mauuer whieh would lead the outside world to believe that there was uooue here., I confess wo are a slow-going people, although had he notifiod us of his coming out on such an important occasiou as the election, I have no doubt we would have all rolled up to meet liirn and hear his views. As to the otlier two candidates he should confine himself to the truth, for, slow as we are, I am positive Mr. Wright met eight electors, and Mr. Ghkudler a similar number, although the latter arrived here in a snowstorm, when it would not be expected of any sensible man to turn out. The population of Oban is small, aud, scattered as they are over an area of 10 miles square, it is very diffi cult to get the. people together for snch occasions. Mr.' Wetherspoon refers to the ghosts ofJacky Nelsou aud Mnudy. Iain at a loss to see where the ghosts come iu, as Nelson is still living, aud Mundy died some distance from hbre. Perhaps Mr. Wetherspoon iuteuded this for a joke ! if so, he might as well favor the electors of Obau with a kev to its elucidatiou. — Yours, See., ' A LIVE ELECTOR. -Oban, August 15, 1898.
