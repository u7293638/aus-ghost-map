A Hopeless Leader. Bill Lyxe, the restored makeshift who again leads New South Wales Opposition, is un derstood to bo planning another censure motion. But Makeshift Bill has already had moro chances than any other loader in Australasia and made a wreck of them an, anu no win proDaoiy wrccic tma ono aiso. Tho point whoro Premier Reid is mainly open to attack is his uttor neglect to pass tho demo cratic legislation ho has been promising for tho last tivo years. A man who would rise up and hoot at (jhoiwh on account of his failuro to re form the Upper House, to provido his promised State Bank, his Stato note-issue, his Local Government schetnu, his promised system of resuming land for closer settlement, and who would promiso to do all these things, also to graduate the land and income- tax, to establish an absentee-tax, a minimum-wage law, a really large and [[serviceable Stato Land Bank; to pay for all unroproductive public works out of revenue, and to establish Old Age Pensions, could sweep Geouok Reid away liko » chip on a tidal-wave. For Reid is ;\ weak man ; only he keops in power because Lv:\te is much weaker. And whon Parliament has t-j choose between following tho short, broad man, who promises reform and doesn't givo it, or following the long, spectral man, who won't even promise it — well, why should it trouble, about a chango ? If a really strong democratic leader would rise on the Opposition side he could leave Geougb Reid with about two followers in a House of 120\. But Muke-shifc Bill isn't even tho ghost of that kind of leader. — Bulletin,
