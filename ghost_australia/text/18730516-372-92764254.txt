POPULAR EDUCATION. ["To- the- Editor of tLe Northern ArqvsIX Sir—The letter signed " A Page of His tory," which appeared in jour last issue, is certainly behind the age,, the style of address being vulgar in the extreme—a proof that the ■writer's philological knowledge i» very limited. I would, therefore, advise- him to study history and human nature for some time longer, and from a different stand point, before he again attempts to enlighten I the " leading men" of Clare, Having re ceived* one- lesson on analytical chemistry] ' he roughly applies the principles to mind, instead of matter, and, finding the elements will not unite according- to his theory, Clare is unceremoniously put down as 20 years behind the age because he is incompetent to bring out the " latent talent." I think Clare will bear favorable comparison with any town outside the capital for business tact, general' intelligence, or- sobriety,, and that the- ghosts he sees stalking at every corner of Main street must be only ima ginary, and may form past of the dissolving views over which he sighs so heavily, I would like to know what he has- said or done to encourage popular education. The hurling" of " thunderbolts?' at the commit tee of the Institute will not effect much good, and his doing so shows bad: taste. That body have been doing their best to make the Institute attractive and beneficial to all classes, but time will* be required, to perfect their plans, and such writers as the one referred to are doing more to retard, the spread of knowledge than anything else. I trust the next " Page" will be -more free from blotches, and that he will attempt to write courteous and intelligible.. I am, Sir, &c.;, Educate.
