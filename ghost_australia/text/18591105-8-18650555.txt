At the battle of I Austcrlltz, when the great Napoleon was on tho point of making ii movement that must have mined his army, a stout, podgy man came careering up, mounted on a tvv enty-four jiounder gun, drawn hy sjx splendid cream-colored horses. This was Belt. Ho lind captured the gun from the AuBtrlan«, having slain all tho artillerymen, besides several squadrons or dragoons who oaroe to their rescue, and he nowcuinc to enlighten tho Em- peror-or, ns ho said, " to put him up to a movo-which in lact settled tho fate of the day. When Napoleon escaped from Elba, Holt commanded the corps of secret auxiliaries engaged in facilitating that adreuturc. He was chief of the staff of i'rlnce Uluclier at the battle of Waterloo, but, serving under an as- sumed name, he lins'not been generally recognised. When Charles the Tenth left 1'nrli for England. Belt drove him to the port, being then dlsgulücd ii» an English hackney coachman -, and when Louis I'hllippo was under ii similar necessity, the in- domitable Belt, at considerable personal inconvenience, carried his Majesty und lils umbrella fifteen miles on his shoulders, nnd only gave in at last lu conscquenco of the old king using his huir to hold on by whilo lie had a sleep. During the lifotimo of tho lato C/.ar Nicholas, Beit was deep in lils confidence, and he is said to have dictated the mission of Mcnschikotl to Constanti- nople, which led to the last Husslan war. Wo aro compelled to draw a veil for the present over Beit's negotiations between her Majesty the Queen and tho Kmperor Napoleon the Third, as this great diplomatist is looking forward with much Interest to the 'arrival of (he European mall, whon ho has promised to favor ns with the latest confidential despatches from St. .1 ames's and tho Tuileries. Our present business is with his attack upon Forster, who, however he may miraculously escape other dangers. Is threatened with shipwreck upon the JJeit rock-or, as it may lie moro properly cal led. Bel t root. As soon as Forster took hold of the political rudder Belt marked him for his own, and set oh" for tho Colonial Secretary's' ofilco with his carpet-bag und night-cap, and has bean thora ever »luce, with tho excep- tion oi a few hasty minutes devoted to hurried runs up the street, in tho course of one of which he dropped n noto at Wlndeycr's lodgings, as a sort of feeler, knowing tho soil side of that young gentleman. Heit sleeps al tlio Colonial Secretary's ofllce, und nothing short of polka interference can remove him ; but oven tho police are afraid oi bim, and Captain M'l.erlc, who wus sent lor early yesterday morning, in order to have a peep at the intruder whilo ho was asleep, was so startled at au abrupt snore on the part of the slumbering Belt, that he made but two steps from tho top to the bottom of the stairs, and has not been seen in public since. "Forster is in a strange state of mind, as may well be supposed, and reports says that ho is anxious to effect an exrhango with any rcapootablo tenant of the Tarban Creek Limalla Asylum who may be disposed to swop -, but un- fortunately ho has no ohnnce of communicating lils wishes. The grcntckt und most sciious Ministerial crisis that has yet occurred is now present, and well will it be if it pass over with- out the intervention of the Coroner.
