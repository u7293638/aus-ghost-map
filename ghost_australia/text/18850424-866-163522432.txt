T h e above figures arc based upon a w ork published quite re c e n tly ou th e R u ssian arm y , which en ab les u s to form au accurate estim ate of th e land forees a t tlie dis posal of R ussia. T he figures given show t h a t th a t country possesses a field a rm v of 1,038,000 com batants, w ith o v c r‘3,600 guns. As, however, acco rd in g to tb e same source, hi case o f m obilisation, an infantry reserve of 400.000 m en w ould a t once be available, th e g ran d total of a possible R u ssia n field arm y could he raised to 1.438.000 m en. B u t th is docs not by any m eans represent th e real fightin g stre n g th of R ussia, for th ere is available a second reserve, th e first class of which would su p p ly nearly 2,000,000 men, w h ilst no estim ate h as y e t been form ed of th e num ber com prised in tlio second class. I t h a s been observed b y a recent w rite r tb iit R u ssia is p ractically u n ­ assailable in E urope by E ngland. To som e e x te n t th e ju stn ess of his conclusions m u st be a d m itte d ; b u t surely he c annot overlook th e fact th a t in case o f hostilities th e R ussian navy could n o t hope to successfully cope w ith th a t of G reat B ritain . A larm ists in th is conntry notw ithstanding, o u r n avy is still a w eapon not to h e despised, and th e R ussian G overnm ent know s very well th a t g reat in ju ry could ho iuflictcd hv our ships. A t th e sam e tim e, it w ould be follv if w e om itted to take into acc o u n t th e defensive pow er, such as it is, w h ich R ussia possesses in her n avy. I t is tru e th a t th e navy w ithin 2-ocent years receded from th e th ird position, w hich it form erly occupied, to th e seventh place am ong naval P o w e rs ; y e t i t is still form idable e n o u g h to be respected, as th e followin g sta te m e n t w ill show. T he R ussia n n avy i6 divided in to fo u r divisions, th e B altic Fleet, th e B lack Sea F le e t, th e Siberian Fleet, and th e C aspian Fleet, of which, however, o n ly tb e first tw o need he tak en seriously into account. T he B altic 1* lcet com prises 32 ironclads, viz., 5 tu rre t fric-ates. 8 arm ored cruisers (3 of th e m building), 1 easem ent slup. and five b u ttery ships of the old type, all classed as' battle ships, besides 13 m onitors for coast defence, and all launched before 1S67; 114 torpedo vessels and boats. 24 cruisers, viz,. 2 to rp edo ram cruisers (1 building), 12 c lip p e r ships of th e new and 3 of th e o ld typo, 1 fj'igatc, an d 6 flush-decked corv ettes, 12 gunboats of th e new and b of th e old type, 30 yachts, viz., 0 steam yachts, 4 cutters, find 17 sailing y a c h ts ; and 79 tran sp o rt, harbor, etc., ships (2 buildju g ), of w hich only 2 ore sailing ships (1 building). T otal strength of th e B altic F le e t: 246 vessels of all classes fo f which fire arcu n d ci'co n stru d io n ). T hu B lack Sea F leet com prises 7 iron- (•lads—viz., 3 tu rre t ships (all b u ild ­ in g ). 2 Popoflkas, and 2 arm ored gunboats. 14 torpedo vessels and boats. 7 cruisers of th e volunteer fleet. 3 auxiliary cruisers, SG oth er unarm oured vessels—viz.. 2 yachts, 2 flushdeck corvettes, 1 scrcw - sieuuier, 2 paddle-slcam crs, 14 Hcrew-.schooners, 14 vessels classed as steam ers, 45 sm all steam ers, 1 m ine ship, and 5 iirc-ships. T otal stre n g th of B lack Sea F leet : 117 vessels of all descriptions, some of them , how ever, very old. T he th re e m ost pow erful Bhips of th a t division of th e R ussian fleet arc still under construction. A s w as stated above, th e Siberian a n d C aspian F leets do n o t count for m uch, and th e h itte r w ould only come into requisition in case of an A fghan o r R ussian w ar, fo r th e transp o rt of troops ; b u t to m ake th e re tu rn com plete th ey should be included. T h e Siberian fleet com ­ prises C torpedo boats. 1 clipper, 3 tra n sp o rt vessels, 4 gunboats. 14 ste a ­ m ers of various sizes, and 18 sailing vessels; lotal, 46 vessels. The flotilla of th e Caspian consists of 3 screw gunboats, 1 screw steam er, 7 paddle steam ers, 8 sm all steam vessels, S sailing transports, 3 o th er sailin g vessels, aud 3 fire-ships— total, 33 vessels. As th e C aspian would, in case of a w ar w ith A fghanistan, b e ­ come an im portant route of com m unication, the deficiency of steam tra n s ­ p o rts ought to be noted. R ussia also possesses some naval m aterial on th e sea of A ral, consisting of 6 steam ers and ab o u t 20 sailing vessels; b ut, leaving those, as im m aterial, o u t of th e reckoning, th e sura total of th e R u ssian N avy am ounts to 442 vessels of all descriptions. Of th is num ber, how ever, a g re a t m any arc alm ost UBelessj and, confining ourselves to really efficient ships, we find th a t R ussia has only 185 of them available for service, 25 being ironclads (10 hattlc-ships, 13 coast defence vessels of th e m onitor class, anil 2 arm ored gunboats), 1 torpedo ram cruiser, 114 torpedo boats, ‘29 unarm ored cruisers, und 16 gunboats, besides a large num ber of transp o rts, etc. We have not included in th is estim ate 1 casem ate ship und 5 b a t­ tery ships of an old type, nor th e 2 Popoflkas; nor, finally, gunboats and cruisers of antiquated pattern , w hich w ould not stund th e ghost of a chance in a naval encounter. In a possible collision in A fghanista n between th is country and R ussia, on ly n sm all proportion of th e im ­ m ense m ilita ry forces a t th e disposal of th e la tte r could bo utilised a t p resen t. I f a stru g g le w ore to ta k e place now, R u ssia would have to d ra w , in th e first place, upon th e troops located in T urkestan. T here nre a t p re se n t of reg u lar troops, ten b attalio n s o f rifles recru ited and stationed in tb e T ranscaspian provinces, say about 10,000 m en. T h ere a rc no d a ta available as to th e n u m b er of cavalry and a rtiU a iy ^ a iriso n o d thorn n o r of th o irre g u la r forces th a t could bo raised o n th e spot. In th e n e x t place, th e R u ssian G overnm ent lias a large fo rce in reserve in Transcaucasia, w hich i t is a t lib erty to em ploy c ith er th e directio n of T urkey, P ersia, o r A fg h an istan . R ussia h a s a t prcscut. perm a n e n tly stationed in th e T ra n s­ caucasian provinces an arm y, w hich, on a peace footing, nuinhcra about 128,000 m en, b u t w hich w ill, no doubt,.b e larg ely augm ented by th e in troduction of com pulsory m ilitary service in th a t portion of tho E m pire. In case of w ar, a considerable portion of th e arm y would probably be sh ip p ed across th e C aspian b y wny of B aku and M ick n ilo v sk ; b u t th e chief su p p ly of com batants w ould be draw n from E uro p ean R ussia, over O dessa to P oti, a n d th en ce by ra il to B aku, and across th e C aspian. T h e m ost serious obstacle to th e em ploym ent of n largo force is th e difficulty of tran sp o rt.
