THE COMPOSITION OF WOOL. Br PnorEssoK Voelckiu. r Tom a recout lecture un uio coinpoaiuun oi wuui, uy irru fossor Voolckor, wo extract tho following .— ?

Yolk of wool (fatty aoidB combined with potash, and soluble in wator and partly also in acohol). ? 9. jrartiwusi-uucu. ? .,..?-.. 6\. Dirt. The rolatlvo proportions of these constituents vary greatly in different species of wool. According to Marker ana E. Scliulz's analyses, raw wool yields from 42 to 60 por cent pure wool- flbro (dried at 212 dog Fabs), 10 to IB per cent ot moisture. 7 to 10 per cent ol tatty matter, 20 to 2a por cont oj yolk (soluble In wator), and vari flblo proportions of dirt. . . - Tho portion solui loin water (yolk) amounting to 20 to .22 per cent contains fatty acids— oleio and similar fatty ncids— combined chiefly with potash' and it small proportion of nitrogenous organic matter^Tho watory solution, or tho wnahings of wool with wator evaporated to drynoss. yields an extract which consiits of:— ? 1 Organic matter; chiefly fatty compounds,; coiitniuiug'liitrogen (1-J2) ! , U™' I ?' 63'92 , ?

In soon places the potash is recovered technically from these Wtfol washings. - ? In nn nir-dry stnto raw wool contains about 8J per cent of mineral matter (ash), which Is removed by washing. Washed wool (wool deprived of tho yolk by washing in water) sel dom contains more than 1 percent of mineral matter (aBh).

A great many of your readers (says the correspon dent of a Victorian paper) no doubt, always pleased to: hear news of a former Speakar of our Assembly, namely, Sir Charlss Gavati Duffy, -who haai for j some time been located in England.' Sir Charlesj it will be remembered, married a young cousin of his; soon after Mr reaching th«!old countryi and snma admira-' tion was expressed as to his couinga, Sir Charles baing well advanced in yaars — at the present time he is 75 years old. Wall,' the latest intelligence is/thatLady Duffy ! has sprasented her lord and master with a seiond-- pledga ;of his sacond venture- in' th'a!jnatri- monial market. - ? ? ? -: ? ?

It is a strange thing that an ezpor- « ioncod clorgj'man of sorenty-fivo years of age is not }M to bo allowed to do as ho pleases. [Wo understand ' M the clei-gyman referred to was the Her Dr Brombjr.l ,. ?».*€ The lato Mr Nicholas Anchorona, who died lately BlU at Buenos Ayres, was probably tho richest farmer in H I tho world. His oxecutors report hts rural ostatos as I I follows: — Land, 1710 square miles; cows, 152,000; ; II shoop, 410,000. Ho also owned much houso property: H J, in Buenos Ayres, and'his assets have boon valued at V fSV i'2,400,000. Ho inherited £200,000 from his father' M, ,.g ' 30 years ago. , ^yi-'(-X As enterprising Amorican has initiated a now sys- : f tern of what is called by the cognoscenti 'sobering I up.' This ingenious person is tha proprietor of a J Turkish bath which ho keeps opon all night. When. jjj gentlemen drink' a little too much at night, he ax- . a plains, they come to him, and are put through a pro- B cess which enables them to recover in timo for their B business engagement noxt day. ' I have known man fl to be brought horo who conld not walk, and in a fan I] hours wo would t-ond them away able to fBsuma tli.WV U most trying business responsibilities, and they woul ^p / jj walk as woll as Wostou.' It is not surprising to heiS^^ I tho houso is crowded evory night. Tho guosts aro H afterwards conducted to tha sleeping chamber, -which B contuins 30 or 40 cots. In the morning they are 1 called, and, after a cold-showar bath, thoy aro turned B out ' right as a trivtt.' The owner of the ostab- 8 liahment. then told the following story : — ??'Lut fl spring a you'ig man who was about to bo married to a i rich young woman living in the suburbs came into | tho city one morning to got his certificate. Ho vas a 13 timid sort of a person, and before going to tha couuty 0 clerk to cull for what ha wanted he took several drinks. n Ho met a friend in a saloon and got very full, Somo- B how between him and the friend tho certificate Tfaa ; M procured. Ho was to have been married at 6 o'clock, n and ho was brought here in acarriage about 2 o'clock H so drunk ho could not stand. His friend, who iras H also pretty woll soaked, piteously bomoaned the fact H .that the wedding would have to be poKtponed and ? both parties disgracod. But, sir, wo put tham both ? through the process, and started them away to thoir ? train a little after 5 o'clock as sober and dignifiad as H judgos of the Supramo Bench.' '' B The great society sensation eclipses all political H ones (says tho correspondent of tha Ararat Advertuer.) , g Tha long-talked-of marriiga betwaon the distin- — *^\ fi guished crickotor and the wealthy and titled squatter's I ^ £p daughter is oft. The cricketer has had tha pen run ' p through his name and will not start tor the Ladies' 'i ' Purse. The costly presents in anticipation of the (j nuptials, including a magnificent bracelet sant by f Lord Rosoberry, have been returned, and tha ], bridegroom expectant is disconsolate indeed. Tha i ongunomout originated under the softening influence ' ! of moonlight, the p-imp, and the blua saa, and was t confirmed under the gas lit glare of many a Victorian ball room. But tha bridegroom intended forgot that with the sex ' safe bind safe find' is a never to be for gotten motto. Ho travelled away and his -'ace and voice became a dream departed memory. When ha I [ returned to claim his bride he found he was a ' f memory also. What tha lady's reasons ware, sava [ the inconstancy of the sex, will probably nerar be . j known beyond her own family circla,.but it is to be | understood tha act of dismissal was hers, and iras 5 accounted for on that principle of tha old rhyme : si ?' I do not love, thoaDr. FelL V Tha reason why I cannot tell ; (. But this I know, and that full well, f Idonotlovetheo, Dr Fell .' j. And now nothing is left but a brokon-heartad * cricketer, who has lost his wicket and missed the '- crown of life ha did most aspire to, snd a wealthy . r heart whole lady upon whose brow a coronet may yet | ] be set. *? In writing of a theosophical meeting in London n f correspondent says : — Lady Colin Campball was the ¥ queen of the evening, and her appaarance attracted . \ all tba moro attention inasmuch as har name viad '?. ?with ' The Demonstration' itself on the poster* of all the evening papers. In the Court of Appeal that ' ' morning Lord Justice Baggallay had finally confirmed r the decision by which Sir James Hannen and a ipacial ' jury grantfd her, a few ireaks ago, a judicial separv ' tion from her lord. In witness of that triumph she \ wore and carried branches of white flowers which friends brought to her in takan of their cohgratnla- '. tions. A sorry subject for joy, to be riddad of a hus- |. band! So ono might suppose at first sight, but to *.' any one who is familiar with this especial suit, the . }; roasons for jubilation over a legal separation aro not f.j far to find. The day before his marriage Lord Colin fi told hit bride that ha had an illness, which hs attri- l; buted to a fever ha had caught tho the year before, p and which, ho ..said, might necessitate, ..h»r living A' rather as a nurse than a wifa (luring tha first few /-* ireaks of their marriad life. Little did the lady ius-i , ? ^P--' ? pect the true signiflance of those words, buf. whan h'C,) later she laft him, and charged him with - crualty,' ^Vtfe: and the medical evidence sustained her charge, ha rL suffered the '? indelible disgrace' of suggesting that m hehad warned her of his state, and that she married !-'. him -with open eyas. Not n. ghost of a Campbell was , p in the court to hear the final decision — parhaps for - }. || tunately, for the' voice of Justice Baggalliy quavarad \ % as he spoka of the indignity which had bean affarad to 1 K a young and beautiful woman, and through her to all i ['; her sex. Lady Colin's father was in court, and ha I; wept whan he hoard tha irrevocable and happy closa . j; of the case. As for Lady Colin horself, sha was . t. among her beloved poor at Nine Elms at the time, | and had the intalligonco of har triumph borne to har . 1 —no astral body being at hand— in a telegram which j consisted of the singla word ' Hurrah.' It was , tho ?- . third anniversary of har wadding day, and parhaps th* ?' naxt happiest of har life to that. : Josh Biliinos says— ' The infed'V in hiz im- { j; pudence, will ask yo to prova that the Flood did oc- : ': cur, when tha poor idiot himself kant even prova, to :? save hiz life, what makes one apple sweat and on* \ sour, or tell whi a han'a egg is whita and a duck's egg ,; blue.' , ,?-'.
