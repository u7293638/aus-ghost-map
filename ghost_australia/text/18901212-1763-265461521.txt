LOVE OF LIFE. Phrenologists have assigned to protuberance under the ear the faculty of " vitativeness," or love of life, and some of them assume that in proportion to the size of the bump is the strength of the vital element in the individual. However this may be, tbat the love of life is extense in some minds, and scarcely exists at all in others, no one of course will deny; and it is no less true that persons who ear- nestly desire to live can keep a mortal disease at bay much longer than those who are comparatively iudifferent to their fate. The tenacity with which some men cling to life is marvellous. We had an instance of this in the case of a noted pugilist several years ago, who was shot in the breast during a bar-room scuffle, and his condition tvas pronounced hopeless by the surgeons. But he scofled at their opinions, and actually lived several days with a ball in his heart; keeping his held upon life, so it seemed, by sheer force of will. A resolute determination not to succumb is, as every army surgeon knows, the salvation of many a wounded soldier, who without it would assuredly die. In the Crimean war the mortality among the wounded Turks was much greater than amongst the wounded French and English. The latter wrestled stoutly with Death and often baffled hiui when their doom seemed inevitable; but the predestinariau Mussulman, when dangerously injured, said gloomily, " It is my kismet " (fate), turned his face towards Mecca, and gave up the ghost. There can be no doubt tbat love of life and vigor and will have beeu the ni>-ans of restoring to health thousands of patients who but for these mental characteristics must ha perished.
