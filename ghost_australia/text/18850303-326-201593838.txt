So many absolute urn e hava been contributed, that the (edition is likely to partake more of chfnae-vc-r of a picnic than anything s. Nvv, a young barrister, rich in , on', in nothing else, has offered his xiritic mite. He has expressed him- E wiili eg to furnish each member of contingent with a legal opinion on i war, tree of cost. Snch a mass of ' law should be enough fo crush the ihdi, without rendering necessary a oorse to the ugly Martini-Henry focct. with its saw-like back. It is nvnally gaid that the quickest y o get a nasty crab-liole filled up is a ebire coancillor to fall into it and ft his best clothes or bark his shins. OetniEg of the same kind of thing has io one oi our coroners bsbisc- Is, that may lead to some necessary orations to the morgue. It seems , it he went there to examine a recently Covered body, and by some means got bed in the enclosure.

' B re:!ly the result of the Beach and 1 match was known on Saturday, be,-in2 began over th6 Beach Uai.Uu contest, £500 level being m one hand. I mention this, not tnuch as an item of sporting gossip, to form a peg to hang a remark or ji>, with rvgardto national palriotism. -v Ilanlan and Beach affair it may iiieu for granted that with our Ame- sa citizens "Ned" will be the favorite; 'e with the colonials Beach' will be op man.' Ariong Australians them- fVts '3 feeling is also very marked. cn?ember 0De intercolonial boat-race, hich the Sydney folk backed their men for a lut of money, though they were assured by excellent authorities thai the craw hadn't a "ghost of a show." But they were Sydney men, and that was quite enough, as contra distinguished to the others hailing from Melbourne. By-the-bye, writing of Americans re- miuds me that a couple of San Francisco gentlemeu have started a novelty in the way of amusement in Melbourne. This is nothing lass than au aerial tramway. A long seat is placed on wheels, so fitted as to run lengthwise on the track, in stead of in the ordinary way. The track is so arranged that in one place a gra- | dicut is obtained sufficiently steep to force the seat, with its load of passen gers, up tbo other 6idi'. The whole thing is pretiy much on the priucipla c£ the centr.fug<l railway that some of your rtniJers may have seen working in Liverpool. The " RdlTr Coaster, ' as the present one is-t Trued, is said to he a favorite amusement in California. The feoliDg imparted as you wlvzz down the incline is pr.tty much that given by riding the swing-boats at the county fairs.
