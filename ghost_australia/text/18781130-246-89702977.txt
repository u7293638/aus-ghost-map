* ? ";: i CARlVING: THE ,TURKEY. A n: ancienc Turkey, weak and gray, "In'faulsbuesmrtis" helpless lay :.. By the banks of the dark Bosphorus, And gaIed with feeble fading eyes At the fitful light of the Western skies " That gleamed like gleaming phosphorus. A Bull iand a Bear sat close by his side, And watched his life's blood ebbing tide With faces sad and pathetic. .The Bull administered lotion loans, To brace his nerves and strengthen his bones; * The Bear gave him Tartar emetic. He had been in his time a game old cock, And stood 'gainst his foes like a granite rock, As true as the truest Roman; And nomw. though his life was ebbing fast, He raised himself and he died at last With his face to his cruel foemen. "Our brother has gone, I do declare,"' Said brother Bull to brother Bear; "I almost feel like crying. Our friend was so valiant, good, and meek, With only one failing, so to speakl He was rather too long in dying. "And now, brother Bear, we'll cut him in two And divide his flesh like Christians true, One haIlf for me, one half for you, Carving him neatly and prettily Joint, y joint, and piece by piece, Leaving the tail for sister Greece, And the Pope's nose for brother Italy." .So they ran the knife in up to the heft, They carved him right and they carved him left And carved him.down the middle: But they could not find a single piece Of meit or flesh, or fator grease :': Suficient to grease the griddle." It was a Turkey only in name, With no true inwardness, only a frame, : Like the 5th of July rocket; .It w:ls thin as a wafer, thin as a ghost, Thin as a diet of water and toast, Thin as a speech of a Congressman when He talks about honour and honest men, Sâ€¢ With both hands in his Uncle's pocket. -Nes?
