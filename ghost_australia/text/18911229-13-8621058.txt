IMAGINATION IN STUDY AND IN LIFE. ! (Fitojt THE DAILY TELEGRAPH, NOV. 20.) In choosing for the subject of his address as Lord Rector of 1 Edinburgh University the uses to which ima mutton may be put in study and in life, Mr Goschen has made a pleasant little digression from the beaten track which will be grateful to ears accustomed to the commonplaces of political talk The cynic will of course say that nowhere are the imaginative powers given wider scope than in politics, and the accusation may to a certain extent be true, but the use to which the ordinary public speaker puts those powers is merely to exaggerate the virtues of his own party's policy and the de- fects of that of his adversaries It is a rare event when a platform address succeeds in throwing over the dull details of some party controversy the rainbow hues of fancy, and when a statesman knows how to treat a sub ject of the day in such away as to make it glow with life and novelty Yet there probably never has existed a generation which would be more grateful than the present one for on artistic and fascinating manner of saving things Mr Goschen told the Edinburgh students that imagination should start from facts, but that it should supple- ment them, and not contradict them It certainly is of considerable minor tance that a gifted orator or preacher, or writer should build upon it foundation of reality, otherwise his powers of imagina- tion would probably do more harm than good Nobody ought to expect the man of great imaginative genius to be always strictly and painfully accurate Sir Walter Scott is one of the immortals of literature and Mr Goschen yesterday referred to him as having given people more real insight into the past life of Scotland than all the historians who ever existed. Yet Scott is blamed for inaccuracies in his his- torical portraiture, and of these he can hardly be acquitted His imagination rushed forward at so great a speed through the events of the past that he had not time to make a minute and prolonged search after details His mistakes are those of a great poetical fancy scorning to be bound down in the chains of pedantic accuracy He was a believer in the divine right of kings and consequently his picture of Cromwell is neither true nor flattering, and there is no denying that he has played strange tricks with dates and personages in Ivan hoe. Exactly the same charge may be brought against Shakspeare. Nobody think much the worse of Julius Caesar because Shakspeare has chosen to introduce into it a modern clock. As Mr Goschen very truly said the imagination is a faculty which probably presents truer pictures than those afforded by knowledge of facts alone. He prefers to blunder with Scott rather than be accurate with the average humdrum historian. In effect this is a plea for the better writing of history, or for more historical romances. And few who have ever waded through the forest of unilluminated facts which his- torians call a review of past times would deny the pressing need for another Macaulay to arise. Superior persons are apt to scoff at Macaulay because he contrived to make his- tory as interesting as a novel The fault is not a very heinous one, and it is not common enough to be of much danger to society It is not in literature alone that Mr Goschen sees the need of greater play to the imaginative faculty. In the realm of science he showed how some of our greatest discoveries have been due to the sympathetic and imaginative method applied to materials accumulated by analysis and observation The field of economics is not one in which the fancy is usually in clined to run riot ; yet here the Lord Rector declared that the want of imaginative in- sight into the subjects with which the political economist deals has often led to profound misunderstandings. Unfortunately for the "dismal science," its first apostles were possessed of little of the vision and the faculty divine. Hence it has happened that the present genera- tion has been obliged to entirely reconstruct the science, infusing into Adam Smith and Mill some of those moral considerations which they always kept studiously in the back ground. Had the imaginative and sympa thetic side of human nature been allowed its full influence in determining the axioms of the science, we should have been spared many of the economic evils which have sprung from the acceptance, for a time, of the hard hearted "devil-take-the- hindmost" theory of human life. The prophets have never ceased inveighing against the cold-blooded political economists, and the prophets have conquered. Carlyle and Ruskin have made modern political economy a better and nobler science than it seemed when first started ; and modern legislation has banished the earlier maxims of the science to Saturn and even further off. The mistake made consisted in building up a science in which human beings were con cerned on a purely selfish basis. Man was regarded as simply an acquisitive animal, and allowance was not made for the occasional play of the higher instincts. While, however, advocating the intrusion of the imagination into the realms- haunted by the ghosts of Adam Smith and Ricardo, Mr Goschen is far from desiring that the student of the present day should take his political economy from the pages of what he styled "prophetic romances." He does not believe that either Mr. William Morris or Mr Edward Bellamy are absolutely safe guides in reconstructing the ideal society of the future. Their powers of imagination and undoubted, but the imagination applied to the future may after all be only guesswork And there is a distinct disadvantage attach- ing to the perusal of books which paint a coming time when human infirmities shall have vanished, and when, as Mr Goschen remarked, every man and woman would be sub limely happy, incomparably beautiful and imperturbably virtuous The effect of such reading is naturally to make people utterly dissatisfied with their present surroundings and to cause them to waste on impossible hopes and longings the energy which, if rightly applied would do something to make the existing world a little better than it is at present. In the study of economics and social questions Mr Goschen laid stress on the need of a disciplined imagination, of Living to the imagination full activity, but, at the same time, not allowing it to overcome the critical faculty For the demolition of tastes in the air a little criticism and a gift of humour are highly efficacious yet it is no doubt better to build a few such insub stantial fabrics than to allow the fancy to rust from disuse Mr Gladstone once remarked of an opponent in the House of Commons that he was indebted to his imagination for his facts, and to his memory for his wit. The scathing sarcasm was we belive a quotation from another and more juvenile orator, but as a polite way of insinuating that a hostile speaker is both untruthful and a plagiarist it has probably never been surpassed "I to be entirely indebted to imagination for facts is a grievous limit and Mr Goschen with his favourite love of statistics would not be the man to praise the complete substitution of fancy for fact M hut he tried to impress on his youthful auditors was the necessity of looking on life from a somewhat higher stand point than the materialistic and prosaic As citizens of a great Empire he reminded them that the power of realising the point of view of those opposed to this was hardly less important than the faculty of for man L, cor reet convictions, and firmly adhering to them in all the great problems which press for solution in the political and social spheres the power of imaginative fore sight is likely to be as useful to its possessors as Mr Goschen chums that it is to be wrapped up in the dull round of daily duties and not to understand their significance and usefulness is also a fate which Mr Goschen deprecates He could not, he remarked, conceive the vocation, however simple and humdrum which did not afford ample scope for the exercise of the bright faculty of imagination The lesson is one which certainly ought to be more frequently inculcated It is often desperately hard to see anything in the slightest di (tree ideal or enrol ling in the occupations in which men find themselves immersed unfortunately, as a nation we have a habit of deprecate ing ourselves, and the fault extends to our occupations A class of inspiring lay preachers is wanted, who would come round occasionally and keep us up to the other view of life If they could put the ideal and imaginative side of prosaic callings before us vividly every now and then they would raise our spirits and do an incalculable sir vice There is no denying that routine makes everybody stale Me should not even culdee in fee to these peripatetic missionaries it the j did their business of encouragement sufficiently well Their duty would be to show thoinirchnnt the stock broker thrower of the Chris ian tin realising the meaning and social usefulness of what each of the in does In this way a stool at a disk might be rendered and at sublime it would be the amplification of Herberts poetical suggestion that sweeping out a room may be done in a spirit that gloiifics even so commonplace in duty When Swift invented the Laputa "flappers" whose business it was to touch up and recall to reality the too philosophic inhabitants, he was talking in an allegory The modern world needs "flappers" to stimulate its imaginative powers in every branch of human activityâ€”in literature, politics, and above all in the burdensome duties of every day life
