Of all'the writers of Christmas JJoo"k.s, living or dead, Charles Dickens . is un doubtedly the greatest. So far i« he indeed from having a rival, that there is iyaj!y.no one lo approach him in this poenliar depart ment of h:s art. As a novelist, he Uau pro bably had an equal, perhaps a ^superior. Indeed, there ave many-though wo are not of::thi^-wh& phicc "Vanity Fair" above ,<;Mnrtin Chuzzlewit" and " David C pper field.** But, a£ A writer of Christinas Books, even Thackeray must .assign the palm 'of excellence to Dickons.

First among these holiday wtorio3 we must rank the "(jhristnijig Carol/' for it is in our opinion the best of that noble series. First published in the last weeks of 1S14, it at onee attained a popularity which has stood the test 6f time.

NTo less gonetous and graceful was the npiri'cd rebuke he gave to those small critics who went about from pothouse to pothouse, de crying the "Chrsitmas Cu-ol" as bei»-.r written in op?n defimoe of all the laws of criticism. 41 Who can listen," ho s;vid, "to objections regarding such a bookP ilt "seems to me a national benefit, and io " every mau and woman who reads it a "personal kindness." ' It needs hut a glimpse of the book's contents to find the secret of its giv.it popularity, and to discover the excellence which pleased nt once tho discerning judge and the multi tude.' It can be seen at a glince that the author owed his success to none of the transparent devices ordinarily employed by novelists to enptivate their read- Ts. The story can hardly be said to have a plot. There is neither a hero nor a heroine, neither marrying nor giring in marrhge. There are neither secret panels nor ghostly corridors, neither intrigues nor surprise, neither uiid* night int 'rviews u^r Btoleu favor.;. In the absence of sneh accessories, it is the wit, the humor, tho unbounded goo luatuiv, the clear insight into human character, the exquisite j"i;Uo.u;on ^ci'mnuu manners, the hatred of tymnny and the sympathy with human tuf forim* exhibited in every tine of the little bt>t>k that coillllhuliotiit* chuvm.
