SEIiXSCTSD POETRY. JIM BLUDSO. Where have you been the last three years, That you haven't heard folks tell How Jimmy Bludso passed in bis checks, The night of the " Prairie Belle ?" He warn t no saint—them engineers Is all pretty much alike— One wife at Natches- under-the-bill, And another one kere, in Pike. A keerless man in his talk, was Jim, And an awk'ard man in a row; But he never lied, and he never funked— 1 reckon he never knowed how. And this was all the religion he had— To treat his engines well, Never be passed on the river, To mind the pilot's bell. And, if ever the " Prairie Belle" took fire, A thousand times he swore He would hold her nose agin the bank Till the last soul got ashore. AH boats has their day on the Mississip, And the Belle's day came at last ; The " Movastar" was a better boat, But the " Belle," she wouldn't be passed. And so she came tearin' along that night, The oldest craft on the line, With a nigger squat on her safety valve, And her furnace crammed, rosin and pine. The fire burst out as she cleared the bar, And burnt a hole in the night. But quick as a flash, she turned And made for that wilier bank on the right. There was screeching and howling, but Jim yelled out Above all the infernal roar, " I'll hold her nozzle agin the bank Till the last galoot's ashore." e Through the thick, black smoke of the burning boat Jim Bludso's voice was beard, And they all had faith in his cussedness— They knowed he would keep his word I And, sore's you're born, they all got off Afore the smoke-stacks fell, And Bludso's ghost went up alone That night, from the " Prairie Bell." He warn't no saint—but at Jedgment, I'd run my chance on Jim Longgide of some pious gentleman That wouldn't shook hands with him. He seen his duty—as a dead-sure thiDg, And he went for it, thar and then, And Christ ain't going to be too hard
