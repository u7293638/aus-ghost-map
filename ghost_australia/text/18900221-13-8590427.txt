I FRIDAY, FEBRUARY 21, 1890. The present phase of our railway finances was fully and clearly described in The Argus of yesterday, and neces- sarily the facts there given, pointing to a heavy deficit for the year, will bo the subject of general comment Perhaps the most important losson to be mi pressed upon the public mind is that the present situation is one which, must regularly occur under the existing con- ditions of our system. The result of the popular pressure for reductions of charges and for increase of wages is that the managers have to cut things too fine. In all railway enterprises there will be good years and bad years, and with sound financing something is always carried forward in the good years to equalise dull seasons. But nothing of the sort is possible here If the commissioners can squeeze out a small sut plus, not only is the money absorbed by the general re venue, but demands aie made all round for concessions which would destroy the balance tes. times over Ihus a " dm "dend equalisation fund ' or what is the same thing " an interest equalisation " fund," or a reserve in any form, can never be built up Hie commissioners are not allowed to have the bondit of fat yeais, and consequi- ntly they have all the worst of lean penodi 'lho gi oat i of omi wo havo to make is to separato tho railway rovenuo from the general revenuo, in order that tho latter may bo dealt with on its own merits Tho Railway department is a trading concern, and should bo so con sidered, but so long as its earnings are thrown into tho general revenup con siderations of profit and loss aro apt to bo lost sight of Special interests do not hesitate to autate for benofits on the plea that any loss will bo horne by the community That is to say, special sei vices aro to bo rendered thom, and other people ate to pay for tho samo But if tho railway accounts and the íecoipts from taxes wore separately kept and separately stated, the commercial charaetei of the undertaking could not but bo moro generally recognised , the duty of the managers to tut their coat according to then cloth would bo admitted, and they would bo neunitted to keep small reserves in hand More over, when Paihament wished to acquire populanty by concessions it would have to put the necessary vote on its own Estimates, so that the ta\ pajera would undeistand that the money carno from them, and theio would bo an pud to tho presont pleasant practice of hon gentlemen ordering this concession and that, and leaving the tominissionei'" to face the odium of refusing tho boons 01 running into debt lo a eel tam extent tho deficiency will be duo, it simms, to the largo amount of non levenue oat nmg capital on which inteiest has to be paid this year Unopened lines have absorbed a latgur amount of capital than usual, and bo with rolling stock Hie cominis sioners seem to think that they should be relieved fiom this buidt n Hie idea that inteiest on borrowed money during its non revenue earning stago should be charged to capital account, is ano, how ever, not to be adapted without great 'caution 'iho syBtom is fast cousin to tbat of paying interest ont of capital, and that is at once the most dangerous and fascinating form of finance, and remembering the peculiar conditions of the colonies-we may weft dread the first downward step. Another arrangement may, however, bo com- mended to the notice of the com- missioners, and that is that rail- way and rolling-stock contractors should be charged 4 per cent, for the advances they receive during the currency of their work, and before handing over the same to the department. It may be said that this is the same plan as the commissioners sug- gest, but in a more roundabout form, as the contractors would add the amount of the interest to their tenders. But there are important distinctions. This latter schome does not adopt wholesale that plan of capitalising interest which the irrigation trusts have taken to so kindly, and which Parliament unfortunately seems more than a little disposed to favour. The precedent of charging interest on temporary advances which must soon run out is one that would be strictly limited, and could not be pushed to apply to capitalising interest for five, seven, and ten years, wholly irrespective of advances. Moreover, tho practice would be a check upon an admitted evil. A contractor with 50 per cent, of his outlay advanced by the Government has in effect an overdraft without interest. But in- terest is due on that overdraft, and it is paid by tho department. The contractor, with no interest to pay, dawdles at pleasure, not curing a straw for the consideration that the longer he delays the heavier the charge on the stato. If, however, the contractor had to pay the interest that someone has to pay, it is reasonable to expect that he would brighton up considerably. The arrangement jvould mean an auto- matic fine for delay in the completion of works. The more the contractor dawdled the less money would he have to receive at the settling up. There would be no evading this self-imposed pecuniary punishment. The circumstance that most of the new country lines are unremunerative up to date is one that need not be enlarged upon. The moral must be obvious to all. It is that it may be necessary to proceed with caution in railway construction in the immediate future. And if the necessity does arise, that caution, no doubt, will be dis- played. A railway that will double the value of all real estate in its area is sure always to be strongly urged. But new considerations will be opened up if such railways are to be a charge upon tho community for a term of years. It might be a sufficient check if the stato shared the annual loss with the land proprietors, upon whose natural and inevitable zeal thors is at present no check at all. In a recent article we called atten- tion to the enormous amount of work thrown upon the commissioners. In particular wo alluded to the ab surdity of requiring these gentlemen to adjudicate in every case in which a man appeals from a fine of 5s. The sugges- tion that ono commissioner should hear minor appeals, that two should deal with more serious cases, and only the gravest issues should be brought before the full board, is one which will no doubt commend itself to the Legislature. We want the chairman to bo a general superintendent, to be free to exercise vigilance all round, and not to be crushed beneath a mass of details and of routine duty. ïhe question as to what extent British investors have over committed themselves is an interesting one at a juncture when many Molbourno insti tutions aro looking -wistfully for help Londonward Butish investors are possessed of undaunted courage, and of the gift of forcetfulness of previous troubles The surplus earnings of tho United Kingdom are generally large, and in some years exceedingly so, and for this excess outlets have to db found And they aie easily found, for the applications foi money aro usually only limited by the desires of the borrowers themselves When an appetite for new \ entures becomes stimulated promoters find little difhculty in leading in- vestors into full and sometimes over commitments The capital asked for has not to bo found all at once, and the inducement which offers itself is that,the first instalment having been paid, shares can bo profitably disposed of in the market before any further payment becomes due But, as has been expert enced in Melbourne as well as in London, the machinery of the share market is apt to get clogged, especially if money becomes dear, and investors ultimately find that tbey have assumed larger responsi bihties than they can very well dis chargo lhe hope of reselling at a profit 13 frustrated , borrowing bocomos difli cult, and ultimately îoalisation, partial or total, bungs down the market, and losses aro entailed which, it may be, everyone cannot very well carry The liquidation of tho cubis is slow, and until it is completed people owning money allow it to remain securely, albeit ignobly, at intorest on fixed deposit In duo course tho process is re commenced, to find the samo unfail 1DR ending The hconomist of a recent date deals, with the question with which this articlo commences, and shows by the help of its compilation of capital applications to British uivestois for sumo years past, that such apph cations reach their maximum amount about overy eight j ears lhe mau mum years aie designated mania years by our contemporary The periodicity is almost period, but cannot bo very well understood by tho light of events in Melbourne, where manias aro irregulai, although acute enough to cause much mischief Iho maniacal period in tho Unitfcd Kingdom generally embraces two years 'lhe j ear of greatest ro action lollows quickly, but the recovery takes a considetable time Mama j Dura weiol8G4and ISC), 1872 and 187 3, 1881 and 1882, and 188S and 1889 "\ ears of greatest reaction were 1SG7, 187G, and lSSr> Whether tho current year will witness the commencement of u reaction re mains to be soon, but the probability that the money market will bo un settled leaves little doubt upon tho point _ach maniacal period has had its special featui es Thus the } ears 1861 and 1865 wore distinguished by the creation of numerous finance companios, und the projecting of new railways to compete profitlessly with older lines 1 hat poriod had its counterpart in one respect in Melbourne in 1888, when finance companies rapidly developed au unwholesome growth, Melbourne in 1888 wag twenty-three years behind London in. vainly imagining thnt the theatrical posturing of finance companies could evolve wealth. In 1866 the' great crash came, the failure of Ovehend, Gotney, and Co. Limited taking place in May of that year, and the Utopian idea that -wealth could b'e manufactured by supporting artificial values by financing was exploded in a ' few days. It is interesting in looking back to recall that the | directors of the institution we have named-men who had been held in high respect in the eily of London had to stand their trial in a criminal court for alleged offences much less heinous in their character than some of the transactions of 1888. One of the people who had bene- fited by the financing of Overend, Guiiney, and Co. Limited, an Anglo Greek named Xknos, wrote a book playfully showing how the money of the company had been obtained by a reckless sot of debtors, nnd im- pudently promulgated the unpleasant dogma, " Great is Swindle, and Swag is " his profit." The mania of the years 1872 and 1873 was excited partly by issues of foreign loans at heavy but inviting discounts, which offered a chance of large profits if they should riso to par, and by the mining ventures which resulted from the great advance in the market values of coal and iron. Most of the foreign powers which borrowed at that time were soon unable to pay interest, and when the bondholders aro likely to get their principal no one can yet tell. As to the new mines, even when they contained coal or iron, which was not always the case from a .commercial point of view, they had to remain unworked for years. Perhaps the rise in prices of 1880 has made it possible to work them. American projects, railways, land, &c;, came to tho front in the years 1881 and 18S2, but again an enormous shrinkage in values followed. The last two years, 1SSS and 1S89, have wit- nessed a combination of crazes, South American investments, conversions of breweries in England, America, and Ger- many by the aid of British capital, South African developments, trust com- panies, etc. And what is tho up- shot of it all? Directly the Bank of England raised its discount rate to 6 per cent, it became 'obvious that the heavy commitments of the British public could not receive the financial support which was requisite. We announce this morning the reduc- tion of the rate to 5 per cent., but the unexpected persistence in the high rate-which lasted longer than at any time since 187*1-has, if we can rely upon the London Standard, brought about a partial crisis, which can hardly mean anything but reaction so far as the investment of British capital in any but the soundest ventures is concorned. It is the old story. Companies may bo multiplied ad libitum, capital or the promise of capital may be obtained on almost any scale, values may be rushed up to high premiums, the stock exchanges may get into a fever of excitement, but if the investments re- quire the existing supplies of money and credit to be suddenly supplemented by an enormous fresh supply, and if at tho samo timo tho inconio derivable from them does not answer to expectations, or is likely to fail altogether, a ro nction cannot be stayed. Over-com- mitments in new enterprises under tho most favourablo circumstances consti- tute a serious disturbance of tho mone- tary current, and until this disturbance has gradually disappeared or the banking and financial institutions have had time to accommodate themselves to it, an abnormal condition of affairs must exist. Although tho partial crisis which lias occurred in England is not at all likely to seriously militate against securities so irreproachable in their character as colonial Government bonds, or against colonial corporate securities, or against the custom of lodging deposits with Aus- tralian banks, yet it is calculated to make British investors shy to part with thoir money to help the miscellaneous financial institutions and companies without receiving absolute security of some kind. It would therefore ap- pear that tho less local institutions depend upon receiving assistance from tho United Kingdom for the present the better it will be. Tho British investor, although easily accessible, and not too inquisitive when he is flush of money, is apt to button np his breeches pocket very tightly when he is alarmed. And it is probable that he will bo in this humour during the year 1890, to become confident and optimistic again in due course. The verdict of the jury in the case of Moss v. Somner will, we think, come upon most people who have taken any interest in the proceedings as a great surprise. After the addresses of the leading counsel on both sides had been delivered, and the presiding judge had summed up, the opinion of nine persons out of ten must, we imagine, have been that the will of the late Mr. Moss would be upheld. So little evidence, indeed, had been forthcoming during the trial of anything like coercion or undue influence having been exercised upon the testator, that few people would, we think, have been surprised if it had been decided that there was nothing even to go to the jury. The remarks of the Chief Justice in his summing up may certainly be considered to have lent colour to such an idea. More than once his Honour stated that, with the sole exception of the testator's treatment of his grand-daughter, Sophia Moss, he had been unable to find anything in the evidence to indicate that the testator had been subject to coercion or fraudulent representation. In spite of this the jury, as we know, have found that undue influence was brought to bear upon the late Mr. Moss, and that Mrs. Somner is therefore not entitled to derive any benefits under the impugned will and codicils. We may say at once that it is impos- sible to feel the least sympathy with any of the parties to the action, unless, indeed, the testator's granddaughter may be made an exception. A more unsavoury tale than the history of the affairs which led up to the present case has rarely been unfolded in a court of justice. It is hard to say which are the more unattractive characters in the piece; whether the woman, whose deplorable career was laid bare by the cross- examining counsel ; or the complainant husband who was not particular how money came to his wife so long as it came somehow; or the unfilial and quarrelsome relatives of the testator. The wretched quarrels of the Moss family among themselves, and the whole miserable struggle with the intruder, complete a picture which it is not pleasant to contemplate even at a dis- tance. A disagreeable light is thrown by such events upon the society in which we all live, and upon the sort of exist- ence that goes on even amongst the well to-do members of the community This, we take it, will be the sort of feeling with which most people will regard the end of this remarkable case. If sentimental considerations were alone to prevail, it is probable that there would be a general wish that the fortune left behind by Mr Moss should not go either to the plaintiffs or to the defendants, but should be administered by hands that would know better than either of them how to make good use of it. Putting, aside, however, all purely sentimental considerations, it is diffi- cult to regard the verdict as at all satisfactory. The jury, who it must be presumed were at least up to the average of their fellows in intelligence and common sense, and had exceptional facilities for understanding the case, must have had some good reasons for coming to the decision at which they arrived. But their reasons are certainly not obvious to the outside world. There was everything to show that the defendant had in some way got complete possession of what, for want of a better name, may be called the affections of the testator. There was nothing to show - so far at least as the evidence went - that she had acquired coercive control of him, or that she had obtained the influence she possessed in an illegal way. There can be no reason to doubt that, by every means in her power, Mrs Somner kept alive the irritation which Mr Moss had not unreasonably begun to cherish against his relatives. But the evidence, in our view, quite failed to show that the representations made by the de- fendant ever came within the limits of the false and fraudulent. In these cir- cumstances what does the recent ver- dict mean? It means that provided the party benefiting by a will can be shown to be a designing and objectionable character, no testator can be sure of being able to dispose of his property as he pleases. It is impossible to reject the belief that, had the defendant been a less unpleasant character than she was shown to be, the jury would not have decided as they did, and that their verdict was the outcome of the disapprobation and disgust in- spired by her conduct and career This, as we have said, is natural, but it is hardly satisfactory. The object of a court of law is to enun- ciate principles of justice that may be applicable to all cases, not to reflect the prevailing sentiment called forth at any particular time or by any particular case. By this verdict a very substantial right is attacked, namely, the right of every man to dispose of his property as he pleases. In the present case there was every motive for the testator making the disposition which he did make. Yet the wishes of the testator are overruled when he is no longer able to see them enforced, and his property is dis- posed of in a way that he never intended. Whether the particular plaintiffs or defendants in the present case get the property or not is probably a matter of perfect indifference to the community. But they can hardly remain equally indifferent to the fact that, if the present verdict is allowed to stand, the power of testamentary disposition is seriously threatened. The report made by the Public Service Boird on tho escapo of the prisoner Pu ruf Dot-Ait. is a document that will bo read with much interest In so many words, tho secret of the escape 13 stiel to be carelessness within tho walls of the buildings Douau is described A3 mi exceptionally clover criminal, nnd the authorities, it is alleged, allowed him exceptional facilities foi escipn He worked bv lunisolf, as a niechuno, with a largo number of tools, and ho was not regularly sonrched at tho dinner hour its othor prisoners vera Ihus he hid opportunities for mnkim» the took ho required and for hiding them also Anl of theso opportunities he took full ad vantago It is alleged also that recently ono wardor has boen appointed to watch two yards at night, mstend of each yard having its own wardor, so that Dona had only to wait until tho wardor lind Rono to the othor yard, and if ho could opon hiä door tho coast sais cora paratively clear for lum Had n proper night watch boon maintained, the escapo ofDoTJAn, notwithstanding all his closer neus, would have boon, liumanlv spesk ing, impossible.

Sea wstor i be taken from the neighbourhood « Williamstown, and is to be conven'» mains through various suburbs to the city. In this way the districts of Foots- cray, North Melbourne, Carlton, Fitroy, Collingwood, and eventually perhaps South Yarra and Richmond as well, would share the benefits of the scheme, and would contribute pecuniarily to its success. There seoms no reason why such a scheme, if properly carried out, should not, besides conferring a great boon upon the inhabitants of Melbourne, prove at any rate self-supporting into the bargain. The general tendency, how- ever, is always to expect the Government to do everything, and in this case it was unanimously resolved that a depu- tation should wait upon the Government to request its assistance. Even Mr. Zox, from whom the idea first emanated, seems to think that private enterprise would be incapable of carrying out his scheme But, as Mr MACKENZIE pointed out, unless private enterprise takes the matter in hand, its realisation is likely to be indefinitely delayed It is to be hoped, therefore, that those who, like Mr Zox, are interested in the success of the movement, will set to work themselves to make it a success, and will not be led away by the expectation of grants from the Treasury, or by any hopes based upon that most insubstantial simulaerum, the proposed Metropolitan Board of Works. We hope that this fresh attempt upon the public purse will be unsuccessful. The escape of the convict Pierre Douar tom Pentridee forms the subject of a report »bidb has been sent by the Public Service Boord to the Chief Secretary 'Hie board Hates that the prisoner was under the charge of Warder Cosgrove, who supervised thestone cutters and general labourers He is described as a clever mechanic, and was employed in bone work and in effecting minor repairs in metal to machinery Ile was allowed to work in a small covered workshop where he au 1 the use of sets ot tools 1 he board has arnvedat the conclusion that the escape was due first to the tact that by working alone, and in the absence of any prison Bearch dunn« the dinner hour, Douar was enabled to obtain and secrete tools with which he opened the door ot his cell-an operation which was lacilttated by the lnct that neither the prisoners nor the articles of furniture were changed from time to time in the cells-and that his subsequent escape from the premises was rendered possible by the arrangement under which one warder sentry wua left m charge ol two yards nt night, separated from each other by a row of bigb buríüings, which prevented what ia known as Number 3 jurd from being under constant supervision \\\ hen Douar came out ot his cell, the board states, it was a matter of comparative ease to him to clamber from the balcony on to the north boundary wall of the yard close by, and to descend to the lane on the other side, separating the 12ft wall of the yard from the 20lt wall adjacent On gaining access to this lane the prisoner was beyond observation, as there were no ?entries on the outer walls 'Uns high wall and another of the same height connected with it, crossing the lane at the western end, are pierced by gateways of vron work, one with open railings, and the other with Bli open railing above the gate, about 7ft from the ground, winch, the board Bilja, would menti) nsaiat an active man in scaling the wall 1 inally, the board is ot opinion that the prisoner is an, exceptionally clever criminal, and disarmed suspicion by his general good conduct and quiet de- meanour, and that any defect which his escape might have disclosed in the manage ment of the penal establishment was not due to the operation of the Public Service Act the statements made by Mr W G Brett, the inspector general of penal establishments, In reference to the escape from Pentridge of Pierre.Douar, have been replied to by the Public Service Board in a report to the Chief Secretary Mr Brett complained that many of the most experienced and reliable warders had been transferred to other branches of the Public Service, that olltcera were promoted to positions of trust and responsibility in the prison against his advice that there was un necessary delay in filling up vacancies, aud ¿hat mere boys of lu sear« of age were qua- lified for nomination as warders 'Hie board states in answer to these charges that the anclencal officers m gaols number 220 that the promotions and transfers referred to average less than six per annum, that they always h ve due weight to the recommenda- tions of Mr Brett, that there ia no unne- cessary delay in filling up vacancies , that no applicants for employment as warders are ever registered for the non clerical examina tion until they have furnished a certificate of fitness for the ofhee trom Mr Brett, and that the three youngest wardens at present in the gaol appear to be one of 19 and two of 22 years of age 'J he board appnnted in August last to inquire into nnd report upon the various safet) appliances tor mining cages in use m the colon), and also as to a uniform system of mining signals, has nearly completed its labours, and its report will be in the hands of the Minuter of.
