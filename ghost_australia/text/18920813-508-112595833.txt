His proposal is the outcome of a very, curious experience on the part of the spifJitifio men. in charge, of the great. Lick telescope, and whiph, aTtjhough. well known to a great many scientific gentlemen in various parts of the world, has not up to the present been made formally public in the press. Now, however*, that Professor Galton has come forward with his proposal, the occasion is opportune to draw, attention to the; occurrence which evidently gave birth to the idea. In March last Mr. A. M. G. Mannering, the astronomer in charge of the great Lick telescope, noticed a slight but continuous sound,, and for a long time was unable to ascertain its source. He drew the atten tion of Mr. F. M. Hammond — the same gentleman -who has recently made such interesting discoveries in regard to the variations of Algol — to the matter, and the two astronomers at last ascertained that beyond doubt the sounds emanated from the body of the great telescope itself. The significance of such a discovery will be appreciated by those who know what extreme precautions are taken in the construction of observatories so that the instruments shall be shielded from vibrations of any kind. It -was a serious, thing then this vibration, and in vestigations of the most minute character were at once instituted. What -was the surprise of the eminent astronomers when they found themselves utterly unable to find the smallest defect in the construction of the Observatory to account for the usual vibration : Then it suddenly .occurred to Mr, Ham mond to test the matter in another manner. He connected the great tube with a phonograph, and the result was truly startling. After the instrument had re corded for three, and a half minutes, the message was slowly delivered. By this means the continuous humming sound was1 broken up, and differences in. pitch and rapidity became observable. ' It is a language,' cried Mr. Hammond, excitedly- — 'a voice from the moon:' Mr. Mannering -was more cautious. He admitted the possibility. There was the .moon shining, the teleecope vibrating, the phonograph- recording.- But the subject was of such vast importance that he wotdd not lightly pronounce one way or the other. ' If the vibrations are not the sound of a language,' he said, 'they need, explana tion, and to me. it would appear that they will form, a very knotty problem. But if they actually; are sounds of a human lan guage then there is only one man on earth who can read- them. He must be consulted at once.' \- Thus it was that from that wintry mountain height, a message- sped across the American continent, dived under the Atlantic, and finally was delivered into the hands of M. Edouard Pertniaet, Hue Jean. Jacques Rousseau, Paris. Pupil of the famous Bopp, the father- of philology, M. Pertniset worked in conjunction with JtL- Lenormant in. deciphering: the- Akkadian, inscriptions, and afterwards earned his world-wide fame among, philologists by discovering the method of decipher ing the so-called Kotha markB, the primeval language of Egypt, older than the hieroglyphics, older than the Pyra mids, and which was an unkown tongue centuries before Abraham entered the land of the Nile. This was the man who re ceived the summons to go- to- the Lick Observatory to translate a. language no philologist on this earth had ever be ±ore heard. It was: a task peculiarly dear to M. Pertniset's heart. The journey across the Atlantic and across the great- Republic was nothing to him,,for, independently o£ his zeal in the cause of piiilologiciil science, ?which would have caused him to walk to the .North Pole had there been occasion for it, M. Pertniset resembled his brother, the famous traveller, the inventor of explo sive bullets, whose adventures, in South America give vivid proof that trutfa. is stronger than fiction. M. Pertniset was therefore not at all averse to. a long- jour ney in the cause of science. Fast as the Compagnie Transatlantique. and express could take him he epsd, and at length clasped hands r -with Mr. Mannering- and Mr. Hammond. No time was lost. The very: night, 'witn. the moon approaching: toe. lull,, offered.: a not to be neglected opportunity. The. xecords which had been made, -were sub mitted to the philologist, and lie Bpent two hours of the afternoon in deep study making copious notes. Ho at last confided his hopes in his two friends. \--' I have no doubt but that the sounds are a language, but I by no means am con vinced that we have them in proper order. For, granting that, as we know,, sounds can be transmitted along a light -wave, -what guarantee have we that the numberless waves of light coming from the moon or any planet will not so cross and' inter weave as to destroy all semblance of meaning in the -words P' '? T, am of that opinion, also,' said Mr. Hammond,, ' and it ia. also only fair to suppose that the rays from, the moon will not. carry only one sound,. .one sentence, or evien only one language. The rays the earth, refracts into space must,' we know, carry, a chaos of street cries,, locomotive whistling, all. the miscellaneous noises of the cities'1 in f act, ' as well' aa tke whole gamut of languages,' ' fronV- Chinese tp English. ! 1 ! i^Wi'' must mtnimiBij tW -ltgtt;1'' ex-t elsamfenfMr. M&n;nering? **J Wia mustfaivide arid snour^tte, ana then wetihaU^tfeceea.^' » i ^fi^Bn^e-sabii'L'yay fcuopfeoV i&a;^tnte iteliA&::^natv'niglitc''^^*--%vef''--bBi:^a^^uk '?ih'-;itnSBijaInrrai]Bi':oiE 'Bc^n^^-!;tfcB'iflrB-ifci-' oaBJon when intelligible Breech wbS -eard* ^through 'ti: :'tisl|iBo0pe- .?'? : 'PfeparafiBn|i' '-wer^ ixpxi&b;?''aaiSl.11 ifce^greaV ttoleBcbpV ^as* caryi ^uUji.ehielded^oW-$Le kbod^offTa^a, Tlip 'i^eordin^lpbrtiW' bf-'ilife'jphfinQgxagn Tfrtts ?selr'to vrii$&l; aiidf; in:-'J«r'-iie^.1iminiite&i-in-e;: ^sulif^as^eady lo be MnoWti; THb^itb^i;' ^waV'placedJ wi ; poeitionV^nd^M^iaSe^1 ^Hci^^sm-i^gp»%Sa^^i^;iiiiff fj&m;& tiwm-w todrve«a. : Tt»ie*ulVv&s; astounding.

They listened longer, -and- were- rewarded with **Bo,wn Went M'Ginty,' fragments of ' That's When You Feel All Eight,' and the chorus of ' Johnny Get Your Gun.' Could it be possible that the inhabitants of the moon had actually anticipated the discoveries of the terrestrials ? Had they., with telescopes mightier even than the famed Lick, been listening to all the earth had to say and actually pirating the gems of earthly harmony? . If they had not done so what other explanation was possible ? Nobody at the Observatory ksiew the comic songs - of the day, and the as tronomers could not sing- ' Ta-ra-ra ' if the fate of the universe rested on their efforts. So the 'whole, affair was a puzzle. Sud denly M. Pertniset pointed to the sky. There on the blue expanse floated long lines of silvery cirrus clouds, brilliantly illuminated by the moonlight. A 'few words and all was clear. From far- of£ cities in the Union went up songs- and shouts along the rays of light. Striking against the clouds low down on the horizon they sped on and on till at last they came within the field of the Lick telescope and were once again heard as human speech. Though the discovery is- not of such importance as the three savants at first imagined, yet. it is certainly- ona-of the wonders of which the present century of wonders can boast. For fear of ridicule the matter was kept very quiet, but somehow or other the astronomers through out the world got to hear of it, and it is indeed highly probable that Professor Galton's proposal to. communicate with the people of Mars is intended' as a sarcaBtic stroke at the astronomers of* the Lick Ob servatory.
