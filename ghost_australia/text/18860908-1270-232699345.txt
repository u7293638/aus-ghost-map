Cxttaik Allison, late Aide-de-Camp to the Governor, arrived in Albany by the overland mail coach oh Sunday morning, en route for England by the mail steampr Sutlcj.

A Mr. Sh'Mlesins, who. was to have married « ycting lady, daughter of Squirt Aldn inkle, died suddenly the day before the proposed wedding, and teases his p?mperty to 4 cousin who is his alter eqo m appearance. The adventurer of this latter: gentlemaa iu tlu> house of Ills deceased consiw's pro* fitr»ed father-jn-law, where he is takei* for his cousin's ghost, form the subject of man}' ridicnloUssilnations wltich will 110 doubt- he much enjoyed by such of our townsfolk if ho go Hiid see the per* formanivs. Ws are informed by Captain Allison that it. is unlike! v that His Excellency the Gov<»«iof will come to Albany until tlie arrival of the Chief Engineer of the Railway line and other principals connected with the undertaking.' It is there* fore probable that the first sod will not be turned on the I5th as announced, but postponed till after +he 22nd lpst., Vhen Mr. Hoj-dern, Mr. Angoye find Mr.- Roger*, the Chief Engineer of the line, will arrive by the mail jstcamer Carthage, As this means only jiiiotherdclay of about . a week it is a matte? of very little importance, bntltis rather unfortunate that flrifcottiicemcnts should have been mndo that have uaused some misappreltensioss esj)ecially as they apparently r-ame .froin competent authorities. Tlie. date of thq turning of the first sod of the milway ling been discussed recently <ad nati#eetm, and the owners of property on the, beach aro atfll nora at having to turn oiit and givfl - tip their land. The railway therefore is not so popular as it was when first initiated. But- people, Britishers especially, will grumble, indeed itis- one of the rights of our nation to do bo, - Nevertheless we believe that there will ^ not be so much, if any, complaint whep . matters are finally settled, as there is little doubt all parties from whom lajid is taken will'receive adequate compensation. * ^ Br ati advertisement in another column 't will be Keen th&t;? the Athletic Sports which Were to,, have been , held on the occasion of the turning of the first sod of the railway have been postponed till the 8H1 of Iffovemlwr^ ^^rlBniice of Wales' birthday. The difficulty in getting funds is probably the chief reason, and atlothcr is thatthe Recreation Grgmnd is not in a fit condition for holding ^ort c , owing to the lati» floods whifcli feafo washed quantities of sand npon )t nnd formed several miniature lakes, The first reason is certainly a very humiliating one for Albany, as at suchHH important event, with the numhpr of people likely to be in town the opportnhit3 f is too good a one to let- aljp, at any xate wiihout a growl. We do not see why another attempt should not be made to complete the Arrangements. If the Recreation Ground i« unfit for the races, surely imolher place could be had. Mr. Alexander Moir'* allotment at the top of York Street Would be very suitable and could no doubt be obtained. If the Sports Committee are incompetent to carry out their duties, or if they canjnofc find the time, let lhem say so and'make way for others who can or ha vie the time. But to squasli thc whole proposal on such trivial grounds is absurd. We hope * Ihe matter will be taken up again as were is plenty of time. , ' ' .
