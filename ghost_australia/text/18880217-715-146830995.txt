Edison's rights were recogaised by an offer of a quarter of a million of dollars, hut this was refused, and so the pirates Coolly. went ahead without his sanction. Edison has hastily re-arranged his old inyentioiij and the t\yo machines will be put .on the; market, within less tfiaii will enter caveats 'against the other, and there will be ;a;tedioBS struggle^ lasting probably ver the greater, part of the five years during which Edisons original patent yet* holds good: Edison's dominant dream for the moment is a py ro-magne tic machine—designed to get electricity directly from'coal, without the leakage inevitable from the intervention of steam. There would he a saving in this of.four-fifths of the energy of the coal; and a steamer burning 125 tons of coal a day could get the same tfork done with 25 tons. Australians who have seen Edison as he was a few years ago, as thin as a fence rail and pale as a ghost, would now scarcely recognise him, for he weighs 190 pounds and is plump and rosy faced.
