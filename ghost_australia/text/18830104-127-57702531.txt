AN A RIEK .AN GRi)OST STORY. A most circumstantial ghest story, which may interest the Psychical Society, is dis. turhing the mind of New York. The editor of the New York JWorld vouches for the good faith of his informant-a professional man of high repute. The house is a new one. and is let our in flats. The following are a few manifestations as told by an eye witness wrho went sceptical, but soon found that something more than ordinary was up. First of al there was much knocking at the front door. It was watched open and closed, before and behind, but the knocking still came, always in four strokes, sounding like blows struck with. billets of wood. Then -came bell- ringings in all parts of the house. Tappings were heard on the glass of the windows, the costs of the boarders fell down from the hat-rack, each falling a yard apart. The plush cover of a round table standing in the hall gracefully floating on to the floor. A clothes-prop was hurled over the top of a porti6re; the walking-sticks standing in the ball were flung up in different directions, and before the scared residents had re covered a leaf from an oak dining-table was hurled through the hall for 20 feet, striking the wall and coming to the ground with a fearful crash. Lnother table took a series of somersaults. Such violent " goings-eol" had such a bad effect upon some of the family that they began to think of retiring, when a frightfut shriek echoed throughout the whole dwelling, piercing, and evidently coming from no human throat, followed by " soft, insinuating" whistles. In the even ing" ii" tried a few notes in arpeggio, and was successful in keeping time and tune with the piano. The tone or the whistle was sometimes that of a foghorn; at other times sounding like the " blowing in the neck of a bottle." All this is said to be a "plain, truthful statement of facts," substantiated by five witnesses. Bevies of policemen have searched in vain, and a curious English de tective has been baffled.
