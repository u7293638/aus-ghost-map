Compensation. The hope that illumines the way of life Is the will-o'-the-wisp that afar Leadeth through mazes of toil and strife, A ghost in the guise of a star. Then why should I covet a share, sweetheart. Of the laurels with whioh they are crowned, Who vanquish, if no one will care, sweetheart, When I am under theground ? Transient and fleeting the light of love That indifference ehadoweth Boon, Fairest illusion will often prove A blight where we hoped for a boon. Thus memory crushes my soul, sweetheart, With the bondage in which I am bound Till dpßtiny deal out my dole, sweetheart, And I am under the ground ! Fruit is a dreamfield of youth's bright day, With life in ita beauty and bloom, Happv the reapers who bear away Ita fruits at the harvest time home. But bitter the sorrowful thought, sweetheart. Though my name may be widely renowned ; How barren the waste where I wronght, sweetheart, When I am under the ground ! Joyous the day with its toils and tears, And troubled the visions of night, Dreary the gloom of the passing year1, In ttífeir lonely, monotonous flight. ' lis but in remembering thee, sweetheart, That my lif'e'B compensation is found ; Thou'lt cherish my mem'ry and me, sweetheart, When I am under the ground !
