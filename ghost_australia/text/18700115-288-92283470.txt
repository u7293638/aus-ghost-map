Ma- ibeadt, and Phil Stone,' the Pbopebty Man.- —During the last season of Mr. Macready's mana; ement, ' poor Phil Stone had given some offenc i, and was discharged from his 'long held office. Not knowing what to do, he . opened a tripe ihop iij,Drury Lane. It was during some very 1 ot weather in the June following his dis missal that Mr. George Weiland, a great wagin his wj y, informed Hiin, that the eminent lessee, thoug 1 he had discharged him, would like to give;b Lm a turn, and said he was. to have a hot sheep1 s head brought into Mr. Macready's dress ing-ro )m on such an evening, so that after his great iatigue he might enjoy it. Accordingly Phil gjtone brought his delicious morsel (as he thbugit) into the dressing-room, spread the little cloth, put the: plate, knife; and fork, a little salt, and the smoking hot dish in 'the Centre , and, further, in acknowledgment of the honor conferred, ;; presented the- lessee with a cooL pint ' of porter, in a new and highly polisbjed pewter pot.

Phil i tone, who was not quite clear as to the litera' meaning -of .the word obnoxious, thought' ithu|htbe~an expression of delight.. Darting pul»f his corner, and rubbing his hands with j-?y, lie said, ' Ii's the sheep's head you ordered, all hot, air.'— ' HotVysir !*? exclaimed : the lessee, 'sheep's head ! What does it all mean ? Get out of the placet you' little, zawoal, or I'll — — umphy' and the tragedian shewed his teeth. In a twinkling poor Phil Stone bundled, up the whole affaaiv and SMunpered out of the' room in a perfecirfeyir^wHcii was partii&lly; cooled bythe'entire contents of the pint pot being showered over him.
