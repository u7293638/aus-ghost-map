PART XIX. To the EJitor. air— Your injunction to be brief precludes my noticing mure than a few of the niis*t»te ments in the letter of ' Clericus.' As be has coma down so far from the 'spiritual' heights solely to prevent oppression ot tUe poor work ing man who owns'(the fee-simple of) valu»bl« land, perhaps he might be induced to con descend still further and leave behind him tbe clouds of error and prejudice in which be ap pears to be enveloped. 'There aint no sich person' as bis client, tho description of -him being a contradiction in terms. Only for want of any valid argument this palpable sham is so often trotted out like tbe artificial ghost of the 'poor widow' who only possesfes aa acrs in the city. Slander of Henry Georpe can only recoil upon the libeller. George's life and works refute all Mandcreni. 'Clericus'' says— 'Under the Georgian system . . . a man does nut pay ?ccunling to bin means, but in proportion to the amount of laud that he possesses.' Thi» statement is untrue, for it it the value of tho bare land, created— not by anything the landholder has done, but by increase of population, gnneral progress, and public expenditure- that is wholly or partially resumed under a land-values tax. This is as much difference as between chalk and cheese. Again, ho says— 'At present they (the ratepayers) ire rated sccordiug to their improvements,' which is not a fact, as both land values and improvements are rated. 'Clericus' seems to be unaware that land value* taxation aud rating are already the law of tbe land, and that all that is now aeked for it that the power of adopting tho Utter in each municipality shall be made possible by restor ing to the large majority of the ratepayers the franchise of which they have been wrongfully deprived.
