ODD NOTES. BY A BOHEMIAN. THE Education Question " is getting a tolerably complete overhaul by one or other of late You BOO it's a very catching subject to people who have the slightest inclination to write to the papers at all Like the land question, everybody is interested in it, everybody understands it, and has a brand new theory of his own about it, to ventilate which affords exquisite pleasure and satisfaction to the ventilator The only fault I have to find with the newspaper controversy so far is, that it has been confined exclusively to the exposition of the views of adults upon the subject, whereas the opinions of that more numerous half of the I community most directly affected the " rising generation," as the Rev. Jeremiah Choker calls them have been utterly ignored What do you say they don't know anything about it Don't they Make no mistake, my dear Sir Ihoy hold very clear and definite sentiments on the subject, if you will take the trouble to assure him there It is easily done Just catch a young school boy, and request his assistance to put out of sight a bog of Camrn'a ' bost Roffey," a bunch of bananas, a dozen apples, some game starts, cheese cakes, and any other toothsome fruits 01 confections you can collect While your young friend is busy with the provender, lou pretending to help, start a conversation about parsons, schoolmasters, pupil teachers monitors, school lessons, the relative value of different kinds of reasons, the manner in which they 000 imparted, and the spirit in which they are received Don't use hard words, or let it appearthutyou are trying to diBWoutyourguost, otherwise he will curl up and silently concentrate his efforts upon the eatables, or indulge only in comments upon the relative merits as urge holes of food Don't put leading" questions, as the lawyers call them, or you will only get the answers the infant thinks you would like to get -for a schoolboy, under such circumstances, is very accommodating No, all you have to do is to volunteer certain general opinions on the subject of schools, with the air of a man who don't expect an answer, or at least don't care whether he gets one or not-and that boy will give you the result of his experience and more tation on the whole question with the most charming condor It makes no matter whether he attends a National or Denominational school, his reverence for all those in authority over him is about the same, and in terse, idiomatic, and vigorous schoolboy English, you will be informed of several things that even the National School Board would be none the worse for knowing. If the boy belongs to one of the Church of England Schools, you will be astonished among other things, at the small progress he has made towards becoming a proBcljto to that Church, and the very low estimation in which he holds the Bishop and clergy of this diocese He has nicknames for them, speaks disparagingly of their mental powers, and evidently regards them OF fair subjects for any amount of humbug going I am not at all surprised that the Bishop is anxious to secure a more complete control over the schools, for it must be a very clear to him that unless this is done, the chance of recruiting the Churches from the schools is very slight indeed, and the prospect of establishing a dominant Church supported by the State is as good as lost It is very gratifying to learn that the Hospital Committee have averted, for a time at least, the calamity with which they were threatened by the Government, thanks to the exertions of Dr O'Doherty and his friends The committee have managed so well hitherto that it would be a thousand pities to see them displaced by a board appointed by the Government, with no power or patronage in their hands worth speaking of How, under such circumstances, could a committee man serve his friends or punish his enemies , how could he maintain his dignity as a committee man, or, a foot, what would be the use of being other matter at all? Supposing, for instance, a nominee board had been in office the other week, do you think Dr. Mul- len would have been asked to accept a cheque for Â£20 " in recognition of his services as acting house surgeon for three weeks," when the dispenser did most of the work and got nothing extra ? Would it be likely that a nominee board of management could keep the resident house surgeon under proper subjection and control, and see that the dispenser did not lavish away the epsom salts and senna upon convalescents ? Is it at all within the bounds of probability that such a committee or board would trouble themselves about the cockroaches in the cooking kitchen, or the silverfish in the storerooms? Not they They would be so completely under subjection to the Colonial Secretary, that they would be afraid to do anything except direct the management and see that the money was expended in such a manner as would satisfy the Government They would not insist upon it that " pauper" funerals should be conducted " with despatch," and the contracting undertaker would be allowed to go at a walking pace when he was taking paupers to their; last resting place 3 or he might be required even to provide a minister of religion to conduct some burial service at the grave. There is no telling how far the demoralisation might extend And what would be more humiliating than everything else, certain active and zealous men who now always manage to got on the committee, and have things pretty much their own way, would not stand the ghost of a chance of ever getting a pointed then it is not to be supposed for one moment that the outside public would continue to subscribe to the funds of the institution when this was the case, and so at last the hospital would have to be closed or supported entirely by Government money I am glad Bramston took the thing in the right light and left the old committee intact, I don't believe it centralisation, but rather wish to see the principle of local government extended That is why I grew anxious this last week about the Municipal election I thought the ratepayers were going to let another " licensed victualler " m I like licensed victuallers very well indeed, but seeing that one third of the aldermen already belong to this class I think we have enough of that sort for the present as rulers of the city If all our aldermen were publicans the Good Templars might growl. Already there have been symptoms, of dissatisfaction among these people at come of the late proceedings of the Council. Certain cantankerous water drinkers, for instance, complain of one of the "victualler" aldermen for getting a contract increased twenty five per cent without calling for fresh tenders first, and the only excuse they have for complaining is that the contractors are good customers of the alderman in question Some people are so evil minded and suspicious that they discover jobbery and corrup- tion in the most simple and straightforward business transaction, or the purest act of being licence. I have no doubt whatever that the alderman in question proposed the addition to that contract from the highest and purest of motives, and if, from a sense of gratitude the contractors spend the extra money at his house what is that to anybody I should like to know ' Isn't gratitude a commendable and becoming quality in a man ? Would it have been a proper thing for those contractors to go post their benefactors door, and spend the 26 per cent at somebody else's house ? What next, I should like to know
