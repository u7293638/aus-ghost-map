MR. PULSFORD AND MR. BUCHANAN. TO THE EDITOR, OF THE HERALD. Sir,-In my last letter stated that it was a most ruinous policy for this country to send away all our wool only to get it back again in manufactured woollen goods, instead of manufacturing it here and supplying all that a million people want in the shape of blankets, shawls, stockings, and every species of woollen manufacture To do this we would require manufactories in every district of the country employing thousands of the people, and stimulating our progress and wealth in a marvellous degree Mr Puls- ford, in replying this morning, to my letter takes no notice of this, but gives it the go-by, as he invariably does with all ugly facts which expose his erroneous and ruinous the cones The plain proposition that in a locomotive costs £3000, and is manufactured here, both the money and locomotive remain here and constitute national wealth If the Loco motive e is imported, the £3000 goes from us to pay for it This plain proposition, which the intelligence of a baby might understand, Mr Pulsford disputes, and disproves it in a most novel manner by saying that Mr Forsyth dis- sents from it-therefore I am wrong because Mr Forsyth does not agree with me I certainly confess myself unable to understand this Pulsfordoman logic I often think that Mr Forsyth speaks as much nonsense on the subject as Mr Pulsford himself, and I am sure he spoke most I erroneously on this matter of the locomotive According to Mr Pulsford there seems to be no currency at oil Every thing is paid for by something else, and gold is a thing of no use and never heard of Our squatters Bell their wool in London and are paid for it, borne by a ship- load of boots and shoes, and others by furniture, saddlery, and the like Mr Pulsford say e " In the great majority of large bankruptcies the immediate cause of failure has been inability to exchange goods for gold " No ghost noodB come from the grave to tell us this, although another Daniel has come to judgment to inform us of it I apprehend all bankruptcies, great and small, have been brought about by the want of gold No poison accepts payment for services done 01 for goods dell y ei ed unless that payment be made in gold, and an equivalent is only accepted from the knowledge that the equivalent is as good as gold, and can be turned into gold at any moment I mentioned in my last letter a most authentic story told me by my own brother, and because this story tells fatally against Mr Pulsford, he has the bad manners to affect to deny it I was particular to the very names of the parties Mr Tennent, of Leith, in 10 pears realised over £100,000 by manufacturing machinery for Victoria He employed 300 men during those 10 years. The protective policy of I Victoria destroyed this trade completely by keeping it to themselves. The facts of this case I was told by my own clothes, a merchant of Leith, and so staunch a freetrader that he lamented the protection of Victoria as depriving him of this lucrative and splendid trade That bade went on until Victoria awoke to a sense of her own interest and adopted protection to secure it yourself Mr Pulsford affects to deny the truth of this statement I am quite sensible of the insult thus offered to myself, but I attribute it to bad breeding rather than any other cause In conclusion, let us see how Mr. lennon's shipments of machinery were paid for On every shipment arriving in Melbourne a bank draft was transmitted to leith, payable there in gold if demanded, for the cost of the machinery shipped Mr lcmicnt would have opened his eyes if it had beonpioposed to pay him for his various shipments of machinery by periodical inundations of hides, wool, and tallow Plugsun of undershot no doubt is great, and Mr Pulsford of Sydney may be his prophet, but not withstanding this, combined with the years dismal science of political economy, which seems to have so obfuscated and confused Mr Pulsford, common sense tells us that the ultimatum of oil commercial transactions is gold, and no one parts with anything of value he possesses unless he receives gold in return Would Mr Pulsford kindly tell where all the gold that was ever taken from the earth is stored í "You can't eat it, and it does not decoy 1 ell us, Mr Pulsford, if you please, where it is. I am, c, DAVID BUCHANAN. Wentworth-court. March 1.
