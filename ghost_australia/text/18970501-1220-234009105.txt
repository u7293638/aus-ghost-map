POETRY. THE WASHER OP THE FORD. There ia a lonely stream afar in a lone dim land: .It hath white dust for shore it has, white bones bestrew the strand : The only thing that liveth there is a naked leaping sword ; But I, who a seer am, haye seen the whirl ing hand Of the Washer of the Ford. A shadowy shape of oloud and mist, of gloom and dusk, she stands, The Washer of the Ford : She laughs, at times, and strews the dust through the hollow of her hands. She counts the sins of all men there, and Blays the red- stained horde — The ghosts of all the sins of men must know the whirling sword Of the Washer of the Ford. She stoops and laughs when in the dust she sees a writhing limb : 4 Go back into the ford,' she says, 4 and hither and thither swim ; Then I shall wash you white as snow, and shall take you by the hand, And slay you here in the silence with this my whirling brand, . And trample you into the dust of this white windless sand' — This is the laughing word-,.... „ ., ' , _ ....1 Of. the -Washer of ifchet Ford. T"' Along that silent strand. — Fiona McLeod.
