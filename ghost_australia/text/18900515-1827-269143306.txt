THE ConrtiiigofllimliSMd By RTJDYARD KIPLING. {Continued from iVo. BS.) '' Did I ever tell you how Dinah Shadd came to be. ivife av mine ? " I dissembled a burning anxiety that I had felt for some months—over since Dinali Sliadd, the strong, the patient, and the infinitely tender, had of her-own good love and free will washed a shirt for me, moving in a barren'land where wash- -iug was not. " I can't remember," I said casually. " Was it before or after you made love to Annie Bragin and got no satisfaction ?" The story of Annie Bragin is written in another place. It is one of the many episodes in Mulvauey's chequered career. ' 1 Before—before—longbefore, was that business av Annie Bragin an' the corp'ril's ghost. Never woman was the worse for me w.hin I had married Dinah. There's a tune for all things, an' I know how to kape all tilings in place—barring the dhrinlc, that Itapes me in my place wid no hope av cpmiii' to .be anght else." " Begin at the beginning," i insisted. - "Mrs. Mulvaney told me that you married her when you were quartered in Krab Bokliar barracks." __ '.'^Vtl' G\0 IMYlllo il' -[L ' -CCiVi pi^. 1 * ' BliiA" Mulvaney, piously. "She spoke tlu'ue, did Dinah. 'Twas Uiis way. Talkin' av that, have ye iver fallen in love, sorr ?" . I preserved the silence of the damned. Mulvaney continued— " Tliin I will assume that ye have not. I did. In the days av my youth, as I have more than wans't tould you, I"was a man that filled the eye an' delighted the sowl av women. Never man was hated as I have bin. Never man was loved as I— 110, not within half a day's march av ut 1 For the first five years aviny service, whin I was what I ivud give my sowl to be now, I tuk whatever was widin my read; an' digested ut—aii' that's more than most men can say. Dlirink I t-ulc, an 1 ut did me no harm. By the hollow av hiven, I cud play wid four womon at wanst, an' kape them, from findin'out any tliin' about the other three, an' smile like a full-blown marigold through nt all. DickCoullian, av the battery, we'll have down on us tonight, could .drive liis team no better than 1 mine, an' I hild the worser cattle ! . An 1 so I lived, an'so I was happy till afther that business wid Annie Bragin—she that turned me oil'as cool as a meat-safe, an' taught me where J stud in the niind r ay an honest woman. 'Twas no sweet dose to take. " Afther that I sickened awhile an'tuk thought to my reg'niental work'-; copc'eik' ing niesilf I wud study an' be a sargiii't -ail': a inajor-gmeral twenty' minutes afther that. But on top ov av my' ambitioiisness there, was anonipty place ill.my sowl, an' me own opinion av mesilf cud hot fill ut.

Never show a woman that ye care a snap av a finger for lier, an 1 begad she'll come bleatin' to your boot-heels." "I suppose that's why you followed Annie Bragin till everybody in the married quarters laughed at you,", said I, remembering that unhallowed wooing and casting off the disguise of drowsiness. "I'm layin'-down tho gin'ral theory-av the attack," said Mulvaney, driving his foot into the dying fire. " If you read the Soldier's Poclcct Booh, which niver any soldier reads, you'll see that there are exceptions. Whin Dinah was out av the door (an''twas as tho'the sunlight had gone too)—'Mother av hiven' sergint,' says I, but is that your daughter ?' ' Ivp believed that way these eighteen years,' • says ould Shadd, liis eyes twinldin"', ' but Mrs. Shadd has bur own opinion likeiv'ry other woman.' ' 'Tis wid yours this time, for a mericle,' sez Mother Shadd, 1 Tliin why in the name of fortune did I niver see her before 1' sez I. ' Bekase you've been thrapesui' round wid the married womon those three years past. She was a bit av a child till last year, im' she shot up vfid the spring,' sez ould Mother Shadd. 'I'll thrapese no more,' sez I. 'D'yon mane that ?' sez ould Mother Shadd,. loolcin' afr mo side-ways like a lien, looks iit^ilia-u'jc w]]en t]ic c)uckoiis jure i-ujiiiiii':' free. iTry me, an' tell,' sez. I.: Wid. that I pulled on my gloves, dlirank off th^ tea, an'..went out ay-the .house^^ _as:.';stiff as at geivval p'l-ad, for well 1 knew tjiat- Dmah Shadd's eyes were in the small av my back - out' av ; tlve scullery, window, : Faitli ! that was the-ohli T . time I-m6ui;ned- I -was not a cav'l'ry mail" for the sake av the spurs to jingle. _ .... " I wint out to tliink, an' I did a. powei-fullot av tliinkin', but ut all came round to that slilip av a girl in tlie dotted: blue dhress, wid the blue eyes an' tlie syarkil in them. • Thin I kept off canteen, an' I kept to tlie married qiiarthers or near by on the clianst av meGtm' Dinali. 13id I meet her ? Oh, my time past, did- I not, wid a lump in my throat, as big as my valise, an' my heart goin'' lilte a : farrier's forge on. a Saturday morning'1'. 'Twas ' Good day to ye, Miss Dinah,' im' ' Good day t'you, eorp'ril.' for a webk or .two, «sn' div'il a bitfurther could I get; belcaze av tlie. respict I bad to that giil thiit I cud ha' brok-en betune fiiiger ;iii'; thumb." . - Here I giggled as I recalled the gigantic figure of Dinah Sliadd when she handed -me my shirt. , " Yc may laugh," grunted Mulvaney.
