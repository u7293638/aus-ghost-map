A NOTABLE WOMAN. Miss Margaret Harriet Stonart, daughter of Lady Nairne's sister, Mrs. Stenart of Dalguise, has jeust passed away in Edin burgh. Misee tenart, who was born in 1797, had interesting recollections of her famous aunt, who, she has mentioned, wrote under the title of " Mrs. Bopan of Bogan" for the Scottilsh Minstrel in order to hide her identity. 'qually interesting were Miss teuart's recolleotions of the announcements of the victories of Trafalgar and Waterloo, of her entertaining Sir Walter ScBoott with mnuseic, and of how in the daytime Miss Boott and she would shut the shutters that they might tell one another ghost stories in the dark. Mis Stenart did not in old age allow her aecomplishmests to lie dormant, and it appears that even when 97 years of age she painted, played, and embroidered.
