THEATRICALS OF THE PERIOD. WHAT folly disfigures the Stage! To what has the Drama descended! What strange silly trash keeps the boards, Of mountebank fooleries blended. Where SHAKESPERE'S ghost pensively glides, With, may be, BROOKE'S spirit (GUSTAVUS), Buffoonery rampant has raved, From which no good taste served to save us. We have had jugglers, tumblers, and clowns, Rope dancing the catalogue varies, And top-spinning swells from Japan, And horses, dogs, monkeys, canaries! We have had dull burlesques without stint, And, briefly the tale to be summing; All phases of horse-collar grinning, And pitiful masking and mumming. But long has our Theatre Royal Been with sterling true actors ungraced, And long, to the intellects longing, A wearisome, profitless waste. And now comes the blow to our feelings, That raises one's dander in blisters, The fancy-garbed, frolicsome fair ones— The incomprehensible sisters. Tastes change, just like fashions, and may be, Right acting will rise as of yore; But till then—PUNCH'S place in the play-house Is likely to know him no more!
