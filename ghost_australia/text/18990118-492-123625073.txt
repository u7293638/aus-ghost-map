POETRY. ? IVY LEAVES. The ivy leaves are brown, And dead as da;B of dream; The toners of tbe old town Look down and seem to frown On the Btream. 0 dead le&veB; hidden long In stored volume old, ? ' Sing a wild wintry song - Where weary phantoms throng , In tbe cold. , ' Tbe ghosts of long ago Pobb through the empty rooms, Where bleak winds whisper low, And tears of mem'ry flow In the glooms. Dim shadows gather in Tho yellow gr;iin of youth, But leave tbe hours' of sin, Though, 'tis too late ro win Fruits of truth. The silver rain of night FaI Is on tby raven hair, And with tbe mooDbiiama bright 1 wreathe a crown of light ' Pure and fair. Tbe leave? about thy feet Are green as when we met, Anear the moflay seat, Whore Derwpnt waters meet, With regret. ? I wake â€” but thou art fled, ?? ?'? -iA^i-',.. ? ? Or with the dream guests gone; To banqueta of thadead So thro' tbe rooms I tread Yet alone.
