;; ; .. . GHOSTS AND GOBLINS j Ir wov.Mbc envy t-r-fiil page after pag uith :Iie doiiiiU of life various idvas'en- icvL.ined aboni ghosts, gobh.ns, and de mons.' Suc'i ide is i-xieitd not only to lbs . appearance of s: eh Lcings, '.heir apparel, appuitciiiiijccj, s nd so on, but to tne noi-es which the v nuikd either of them selves or hv 'means ot various supernatu ral t-l-jacti' vhici. they acq supposed to currj about with them. Thus : — " The ihec-ted dead Did squeak aud sibber 111 the Roman streets A iitUd etc rite mighti-st Julius fell." And it is to be uo'ed (hat as ghosts com- nionij lihow no face, so few have been known tc speak with full voice. This may bs because" the noises heard at the Lours when ghosts arc seen are hot such as can be by any possibility mis taken for : I10 human voice in its ordinary tones, while, nsvori-Leless, an -excited imagination 'can frame spoken words out of -ihq strange sounds v.hieh . can be heard in limost every house in the still ness of night. This eh- o serves to accouut for the notion that ghoc.t-i can clank chains, or 'inakc c-iro? dismal noises. Sounds heard at night are highly decep tive ; a small voice close by is taken for a loud noise at a distance (not neces- sarib- a very great cli-taace ); and a noise made by objects of one kind will be mis taken or n-ises man 3 by objects ot a difevint > d abogsiLer. A friend of mine tola me he had been disturbed two cig-iS;. raanirg by a sound as of an aimy trsnipiiig c-O' . , i a road which passed some 200 yards fiom his L juse : he found the ihb.i nigiri (I had soggt-sfce-d an experi- mcuiiii ii :-i ss u» tee place whence the sound came) that the noise was produce ! by a -riock ;u ibc ; c-xt house, the clock having beiD. newlv olacid against the partv-wad. Yfc- all know Carlyle's story of tin- ghostly iowc- heard each evening by a low spirited man — a voice as if one, in like dole-: il duiiv.iv, p- ' 1 .iming, "once I was hap-ki'p-happy, but now I am iiiiii'! or; .If,"— and how -bo ghost re- SOiVOO into a rusty ki'.clien-jack.
