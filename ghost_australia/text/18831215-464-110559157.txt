AN APPARITION. The Wicklow People of Saturday, Oct. 13th, has the following :â€” The gentry living about Bray are a won- drous race. We know of old that even before and after the days when William Keogh of glorious, pious, and immortal memory dwelt there, they were potent at conjuring up spirits to any amount, whether long buried or lately on the bier. But on last Monday they exceeded themselves. It is nearly six months since we recorded in these columns the death of a great patriot, lamented as loudly and deeply as the above-named Wil- liam. Sometime in May last or early in June died James Carlisle M'Coan, M.P. Attacked by apoplexy at the sight of a crowd of mur- derers around him at Tinahely, he finally died of nervous shock from the too sudden application of the powerful O'Kelly battery to his already degenerate heart. Will it be be- lieved ? The Bray gentry have actually raised his ghost at noontide. Not by degrees, by head and shoulders, like Samuel at bid- ding of Endor's witch ; but in full figure, that charming face and figure framed so much on the idolized likeness of the dear departed James Sadlier. It was a triumph that licks the tricks of Maskeline and Croke, and leaves completely in shade Mr. Home and every other spiritualist. The Bray people may well wish the ghost were never raised. We, on our own part, freely admit after this that it was the ghost of Wicklow's departed representative that appeared for an hour at Bray and then disappeared.
