? ♦ ? SPORTING NOTES. The committee of the South Australian Coursing Club met last week, and made arrangements for the issue of a programme about a week later, but it was decided to hold the first meeting at the end of March, and the second early in May. In the Melbourne Sjiortsman we observe in the advertising columns the programme of the S.A. Jockey Club's Autumn meeting to be held on the Flemington racecourse on May 2, 7, and 9. On the first day there are five events — Hurdles, St. Leger Stakes, Goodwood Handicap, Sires' Produce Stakes, and Victoria Handicap. On the second day a Maiden Plate, Nursery Handicap, Adelaide Cup (a sweep of 10 sovs. with 500 sovs. added), Selling Hurdle Race, and Flying Handicap. The third day's card includes another Hurdle Race, Ladies' Bracelet, Steeplechase, the Charity Plate, and the S.A.J.C. Handicap. The total of the money added by the club amounts to £2,500. Mr. E. T. Barnard is engaged as han dicapper. Referring- to the Queen's Birthdav meetine of the A.R.C., Mr. E. Ward, M.P., has in formed us that last week, accompanied by Mr. Blackler, he visited some of the leading men usually interested hi sport, and obtained several promises of subscriptions, ranging from three to twenty guineas, to assist in the pro posed race meeting to be held on the Old Course in May. They anticipate that a sufficient sum will be raised to enable a first class meeting to be held, and are hoping and expecting that some liberal sportsman would appropriate to himself the privilege of giving a hundred - guinea cup to be added to the stakes. It axipears as though some disgraceful dis closures are imminent in connection with the performances of the racehorse Tichborne in Tasmania. At Hobart while running in the Bracelet Stakes, which was considered a 'moral' for liirn, Tichborne, who was occupy ing second position, suddenly collapsed, and the matter was considered to be so suspicious that H. 'Vy. Rogers, his reputed owner, was disqualified and warned off the course. The jockey Blair was exonerated from blame, as it was supposed the horse had been drugged. Two days afterwards at the same meeting' Tichborne easily appro priated the Flying Handicap and the All Aged Stakes ; and at Launceston later on, in the hands of a new owner, he won the Visitors' Gift Handicap. A later telegram states that H. W. Rogers and T. Lammerse (a Melbourne man) have been arrested by the police on a charge of conspiracy to defraud, as evidence is forthcoming that they gave the horse a big drink of water at a roadside trough just previous to the race being run. Tichborne was bred at Fulhani Park by Mr. Blackler, being by Countryman out of Bridal Wreath. Mr. Von Doussa is fortunate in obtaining such excellent entries for the Onkaparinga Easter Monday meeting. Last year lie had 133 nominations for the four principal events, and this year they reach the same total all but one. The figures last year were — Hurdles,. 24 ; Cup, 35; Steeple, 40; Railway Stakes, 34. This year there are in the Hurdles 28 ; Cup, ? Sfi ? Rteonlo 39 ? Pivilnraw Sfol-o= Qft «n«k entries in the face of dull times, and the fact of so many horses being in Melbourne, speaks well for the popularity of the Oakbank gather ing, and proves that a ?well-conducted club will pay its way and provide good sport for its patrons. Sporting men will be pleased to know that Tom Hales, the jockey, has so far recovered from his late illness that he is now able to take walking exercise. Ringwood's time for the Hobart Cup, S min. 9i sec, was the fatest on record for that event. Ten minutes after the son of St. Albans passed the post, £1,000 to £100 was laid about bis chance of carrying off the Australian Cup. By the South Australian, which left Adelaide for Melbourne on Tuesday, a number of sport ing men left for Flemington to witness the forthcoming V.R.C. autumn meeting. It appears that Le Grand has broken down on the training track, and that Rufus is also reported to have gone wrong. Betting during the week (remarks tlie Mel bourne tiportsriian) of February 18, has been particularly spirited, the Newmarket Handicap being the event principally operated upon, Sheet Anchoi, Sir Garnet, Coronet, Pro metheus, Battailous, Coningsby, aud Mascotte having each been backed to win £30,000 or £40,000, while Middlemarch, The Ghost, Xantippe, Malua, Meander, Amelia Victoria, and Velocipede have also received considerable attention. On the Australian Cup very little speculation lias taken place. Mr. Pearson has accepted £2,000 to £200 about Commotion from Mr. Morris Jacobs, and Off Color, Acolyte, and Quality have been enquired after, Mr. Pearson having offered to take £15,000 to £1,000 about the last-named mare. £5,000 to £500 being the best response. A dead-set was made attherooms on Tuesday night against Bar go and Le Grand, both of whom are said to have gone crooked. For the Champion 3 to 1 is offered on the field, but no business has been transacted during the week. The following are Messrs.
