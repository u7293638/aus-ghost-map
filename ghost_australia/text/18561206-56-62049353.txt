The several the'o-' ries. of spontaneous combustion have often been revived, and,' in tho opinion of most wise men, have been successively and re peatedly exploded.' But jtist as lute years' jave 'witnessed a revival of ghost stories, spirit conimunioatiohs, and direct de moniacdl, agency, lit seemi- not. a little likely; that the old 'theories of spontaneous combustion are corning in for another 'day; in'tb'eir turn, if we are to judge from ', the extraordinary; revelations, which have- been' nut onlv retailed in gossip, but most gravely 'and fully inquired; into under the coroner's warrant;' and- before thirteen men honest and true, aod, we may add, picked men,- of this, -highly- educated 'borough,' ?A Sketch of-- the i principle facti. will ' ah-' swer the same end as a report of the ;de positions taken before the. coroner, for the result of this last ? cou rse would probably bu only the awkening of .half.incredulous wonder and a wild curiosity;-' ?
