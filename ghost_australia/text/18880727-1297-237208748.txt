SECTARIANISM IN POLITICS. LETTERS FROM MR. DIBBS AND ICR. ABIGAIL. to the editor of tllfi daily telegraph Sir,— Iu your loader of to-day, for reasons known only to yourself, you have most unfairly pot my name prominently forward in connec tion with tbe curse of this country— miserable, wretched, intolerant, sectarian animosity. Per mit me to say for public information that when Prince Alfred was shot by the lunatic O'Farrell, abont the yar 18»>7, and in consequence of a public . statement made by Sir Henry Farkes, than Colonial Secre tary, in his celebrated Kiama ghost speech of a wide-spre.vl Fenian conspiracy, I, in common with hundreds of loyal natives, be came a member of nn Orange lodge. I attended not more than two meetings, because when I found tha Kiama chose conspiracy, which was exposed by Mr. William Afaeleay'fl historical committee, was merely a myth, I with numbers of others who had joiucd the Orangemen re fused to continue a member of that organisa tion. I have from time to time been charged with many things as a public man, but my bitterest enemy h»8 never dared to say that either as a private citizen Or as a public man have I ever permitted au Injustice to be dona to anyone because he happened to differ from m'o in faith. The tone of your article would lead anyone to imagine that for political purposes I had recently became an Orangeinaa, whereas my only con- section with that body was more, than 20 years ago, and then only of a temporary character.— lours, ic., GEORGE A.DIBB3.
