TRIFLES OF WIT AND HUMOR. TIT FOR TAR.—The following is, of come, an American story:—"The Quaker president of a Pennsylvania railroad, daring tine can- <*> fusion. and panic last fall, called upon, bet W Bank, with which the road keptalarg* regular account, and asked for an frrtfruJna of put of its paper falling due im a few day*. The bank president declined **&—■ abruptly. •Mr. X , your paper must be paid at matanty; we cannot renew tL' 'Very weS,* oar Quaker friend repfaed, and left Oe bank. Bat he did not let the matter drop here. Oa leaving the bank he went to the depot, and telegraphed to all the agents and conducton on the road to reject all bills on the W—— Bank. In a few boon the trains befcam to arrive, full of a panic, bringing new* of the W Bank all along the line. Stock holders and depositor* nocked to the bank, ousting with panic, enquiring tons, * Wharfs the matter? Is the bank broker &c.; AUtCto enquiry on the part oT the offian snowed that the trouble originated in the rejection of fte boh-by the railroad agents. The Praaidea* ■ in ilfiis lini nil miilif fin mi In tin u—liili office, and came banting in with thai enquiry. 'Mr. X—. hare you. directed the-refusal <* oar currency bj your ageutsf 'Yes,* was As* quiet reply. 'Why is this ? It trill nan am.' * Well, friend V—, I supposed the bank w*S going to fall, as it could not renew a little panae for as this morning.' It is needless to say tnat Mr. Li— renewed all the qaafcer'a papers, ant enlarged his hue of dUcauct, while the magi* wires carried all along the road to every agent the sedative message, 'The W Bank is all right. Thee may take all its earreney.*" When Cnrran was asked by a brother lawyer* " Do yoo see anything ridiculous in this wig?" and he replied, " Nothing but the head," that was wit. And when Scott describes the in mates of Cleikum Inn, in St. Return's Well, whs thought they had seen the ghost of a murden* man, we get humor, the root of widen Kes Car deeper in human nature. He says the tm"P maiH?n« took refuge in their bedroom, whilst the hump-backed postillion fled like wind into the stable, and with professumal instinct began in his terror to saddle a horse. This was his most «i?tnral refuge from the supernatural; a, touch of tumor a; which we smile gnwely, if at all. When Hood describes a fool whose. height of folly constitutes bis own monument, he calla him A column of fop, A lighthouse -without any light ••-top.*' That is wit. Bat when Chaucer describes the fox as desirous of capturing the cock, and try. ing to flatter him into singing by telling hrsa how hif> respected father used to aang, and not his heart so much into his aong that he was obliged to shut his eyes, and by this nw?i?« geta poor chanticleer to imitate his father, and sins and shut his <eyeg alto; whereupon the fox pounces on him and bears him off—that ia humor; a sort of shut-eyed humor quite irre sistible. Again we have wit when JerroU , defines dogmatism as " pnpiiyism come ta> maturity." But we get at humor whenPannrga, in bis mortal fear of shipwreck, cries, *' Would to heaven that I were safe on dry land with, (we presume to make qmte •ore of his *«*?r} aomebody kicking me V—Qaortertg Benem.
