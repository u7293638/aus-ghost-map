amounting at the end of the first week, according to the Cologne Gazette, to .00 millions of francs (£10 000,000) To be able to conceive the universal disturbance produced by this catastiophe, you must know that nearly the half of the total debt of Au°tn.-2 r0fl millions of fiancs out of 5,100 millions-is held by foreign cre- ditors Holland, winch possesses Austrian stock to au amount of 105 millions, stands foiemost amongst the Austrian cre- ditors, and therefoie the Amsterdam money market has been moie deeply affected than any other Then comes Germany for half a milliard, Belgium 375 millions, Trance 275 millions, England 15 millions, &.C I quote these figures to show you to what a degree the whole of Europe is interested m the maintenance and prospenty of Austria The piesent crash was brought down by a fever of speculation which had made of Vienna, in these latter }ears, a huge gambling house, and it would seem that the fever has spread as far as Berlin, which would tend to make usbehevethat the Germans, however shocked they may seem to be by what they call Tiench immorality, aie themselves nut untainted by the vices they lay at oui door The Times one day took it into

individualism -"Every German, if he could only contine it, would wish to have a king tor himself alone " Amongpf these letteis, ono of the most îemarkablc is that which he wrote to his wife on the 3rd of September, 1870, after the battle of Sedan, a letter which merely narrates facts, and does not m the least smack of brag Bismack himself said at an ev ening party at his own house, that on the

It sounds strangely bke the dreadful tale of Tort Pillow tobe told of negroes being shot down and killed as they ran fiom a burning building m which they were beleaguered Yet this is what happened at Colfax, Grant Parish, La , on Sunday last 'Ihe details of this fiendish deed are simply these Some 400 negroes retreated into the court house, and it was iued as the only means of dislodging them One hundred of their number were shot as the> tied, and after the »ufó. not a negTO was to be seen for miles around About 100 are said to have escaped The fate of the 300 can hardly be considered as anything but a horrible certainty Wo shall probably hear of fmther outrage and bloodshed in that section The integrity of the Union-the v or} unity of the nation is now undergoing a cnieial test It remains to be seen whether Louisiana can be con- vulsed and the Union remain undisturbed or inactive General Grant and lnsimme díate advisers have evidently a hard nut-to crack down South Out West the present aspect of affairs is scarcely more hopeful or encouraging than it is m the extreme South Uncle Sam's irons - to use the homely butsignificantlanguage of the prairies -stand greatly in danger of overheating before he gets them out of the fire No sooner is the ghost of Mormon (which a Down east editor personifies as Brigham Young m a swallow-tail coat and wide awake hat) respectably laid to its rest, than the spectre of the outraged Red man, in the person of the Modoc chief, Captain lack, and his confederate warriors, rises to view. The Indian tribus in the west of the whole Pacific coast, but more particularly of California and Oregon, seem to be thoroughly aroused They are lepoited to be everywhere arming and thieatening to avenge themselves foi their wrongs, whether real or imagined 'Hie treachery of Captain Jack and his band in murdering General Cauby and his co com- missioners, Ins stirred up a profound feeling thioughout the country agauiBt the whole tnbe, and the old cry of "extermination" has been rev iv ed The great difficulty at present seems to be to catch any of the band The "lava beds,' as their chosen rendezvous and camping ground is called, seem to be especially adapted by nature for the scene of a first class Indian massacre The region is little better than the crater of an extinct v oleano with scant or no vegetation and as full of holes as Tingal s Cave or the Mammoth Cave of Kentucky To these holes the Modocs, when pressed, betake themselves, and issuing from the subter ranean passages perhaps miles from the scene of conflict, rendel it next to impossible to capture them The San Trancisco papers of the 22nd publish a list of two killed and six severely wounded amongst the U S troops in the engagement of the 10th The latest intelligence from the West is far from en- couraging to those who hoped or expected that summary vengeance would be taken upon Captain Jack and his little band for their misdeeds Apparently, the furthei the United States troops i o m ]>--__.<> or iiieir persecutors, the worse they fare. Another skirmish, which sensational papers like the 7/eraWmagmfyintoan "engagement," is re ported as having taken place on the20th Oat of a command numbenng 09 men, the troops returned to camp with but 20 Tifteen were killed and 28wounded and missing Arnon,; the former was Major Evan Thomas, who commanded the party Ile was the son of the late Adjutant general Lorenzo Thomas Lieutenants Howe and Knight aie also le ported killed Tins news has caused much feeling against the so called "peare policy of the Government, the press being especially loud in then denunciations of 'the vacilla tion and weakness which has resulted in this waste of life ' The full returns of the ninth United States decennial census, which are now befoie us, reveal some singular and rather startling facts Hie prevalent opinion enteitamed abroad is that every sectioi and every state of the Union has au v anced and is still adv ancmg in population, piodnction, and wealth, and that California takes a front rank, if not precedence, of all save a favouied few, m the vanguaitl of material prospenty, oi, as the Americans delight to put it m " the westward maieh of empne , ' but the Government re poit refened to shows that California -far from being among the foremost states for adv ancement-is actually hindmost In sporting pailanco, the golden st ite is simply " nowhere ' in the race In the value of her industrial productions including those of the mines, California is i etui ned as " the only statem thcUnion which has madenopiogress dunng the last decade " "tt hilst hei growth m population has been undoubtedly large i e , from 323 177 m 18G0 to 109,121 m 1870 equal to 5. per cent, the increase in her pioduction has been absolutely nil While the nuning niteicst and the actual yield of gold have both rapidly declined, the agncul tural and manufacturing industries have not advanced m anything like the same ratio She has engaged m manufaetuies and me chanical and mining industries about the Barrie number of persons as those thus cmplojed m Connecticut, or 81.50S against 86,344 m the latter state Yet the value of the produce of the New England state is more than double that of the Pacific, oi 101 005,471dol against 00 591,55Gdol (gold) A furthei anal}8is of the census îetuins ex lnbits a still more stnkmg proof of the slow giowth of California when contrasted with that of some of the so called Western States, notably with those of the Mississippi valley Missouri, for instance, has some 2,000 fewer persons engaged m industrial pul suits, exclusive of agnculturo, yet the ?value of bei manufactured products in 1870 amounted to threefold that of Calfornia, the increase of the former during the last decade being returned as equal to 100 per cent The most gratifying, 'because the most health} and hopeful, fact for California's future brought to light by these census figures, is hat farming has taken the place once occu pied by mining That glowing wheat, dig gmg potatoes, and planting vineyards, pay better than washing the hill sides and nvei bottoms foi "nuggets" or "dust," that rich alluvium, under the jealous eje and thnfty hand of the husband- man, will produce moie satisfactory re- sults than the long boasted red banks and bottoms when worked only for the chance "find" of the much coveted oie The wheat crop alone this }ear is stated by an Overland Kontldu writer to be worth twenty five millions of dollars, or nearly five millions more than the entire gold }icld for the same period Under the stimulus exerted by such facts and figures as these, no wonder that the aim tacia famts has subsided, and that the ancient and natural predilection for potatoes pulse, peaches, and other products-farm, dany, and orchard should reassert itself The folly ofthe attempt on the part of tho Prussian Government to stem the tide of emigration to the United States by the inter- position of the military code, ard the pas sage of an act prohibiting the railway com- panies from granting i educed fares to emigrants over theirîrcspcctive lines, is now apparent The immigration from all parts of Germany, and indeed from almost every part of Europe, is largely on the increase It has been larger for the first quarter of 1873 than for any concsponding penod for some years past Forlhc week ending 19th, the arnvals at CastleGaiden reached neatly 15 000, an aveiage of

havo again become prevalent 'the old stiuggle between capital and labour is being fought over again One would suppose that m a country vi here skilled labour is lemuneiated at prices ranging from 10s
