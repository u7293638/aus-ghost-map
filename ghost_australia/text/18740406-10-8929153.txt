THE MERCURY. MONDAY MORNING, APRIL 0.1S74. A TFXF.C.RAPHIC message from Sydney informed U3 a few days ago of the arrival at Newcastle of a number of French Communist prisoners, who had succeeded in making good their escapo from the French ponai settlement of New Caledonia. Nearly nil of them occupied moro or less pro- minent positions in the Communist Government of Paris, and during their brief ascendancy, some fearful crimes, too horrible to relate, were perpetrated. Wo do not say that HENRI RIICHEFOKT, or any of his escaped comrades, had any direct part in those crimes, or in the work of desecration and spoliation which suc- ceeded thom. Dut their Government, if such it can be termed, was based on tho support of the rabblo of Paris, who were intoxicated with nu undying hatred for everything which rominded thom of the Imporial regime, and maddened to insanity by tho approaching bombardment of thuir city. The appearance in au English colony of tuon in any way associated with such atroci- ties as wo liavo roforrcd to, cannot be regarded as at all dosirablo ; and though wo are far from anticipating that HENRI RUUHBKORT will | givo us any troublo, oven if ho remained [ among us-which is not vory likely-and i though it is scarcely probable President IMAOMAHON will take any trouble in con- nection with tho escaped prisouors, it is 1 beyond ti doubt that ROUIIEVOHT, wore he ' allowed to again outer Franco, freed of all civil disabilities-would soon be found wielding his mighty pen against MAOMAHON'B Government, I an he did against his surrender on the battle : ffîld of Chalxns. ROCHEFOUT, as a journalist, ctercisod a vast inflnonco on the public mind in Paris ; and in tho present disintegrated state J of France thoro is no doubt that his return to I Paris from exile would throw into a state of confusion a people who, at the best of times, are far too susceptiblo to political excitement. An illustration of tho power of HENRI ROOHEFOIIT'S pen may bo found in tho re- markable article he wrote on the assassination of his fellow journalist, VICTOR, Norn, by Princo PIERRE BUONAPARTE, and which caused no loss than 100,000 people to flock together to I pay tho last tributo of roapect to his friend's memory. For his zeal in NOIR'S defence ROOIIEFIIKT was nrrostod and imprisoned in St. Pélagie ; and had it not buen for the disasters which bofel the Napoleonio dynasty, a disaster. which throughout his remarkable lifo ho had consistently helped to consutn-1 mato, there ia no douht UOCHEFORT would have remained in St. Pélagie to this day. It waa not I by his pon nlone that ROOHEFOKT worked ; it ia matter of history that he fought no lesB than four duels, one with a Spanish officer who undertook to dofend tho chastity of Queen ISADELLA, the aecond with Prince AOHILLF, MURAT, the third with M. PAUL DE CASSAONAO (one of the literary hirelings of the late Emperor), and tho fourth with M. BAROUCUE, for some time Minister for Foreign Affairs. In fact, it mattered little in what light he appeared, ho wa3 always sure to command a certain amount of admirers. ' His two comrades, PASCHAL GnoussET and M. JOURPE, held respectively the officos of Minister of Foreign Affairs and Minister of Finance under the Commune, and they, too, played leading parts in the history of France during the late war. GROUSSET started a newspaper, entitled TAI Nmtvelh République, when tho revolution of the 18th of March hroko out ; and that was suc- ceeded by another L'Affranchi. «IOURDE was a member of tho International Society, which caused so much uneasiness in England and the European Cintinent shortly after the Franco Prussian war began ; and when the Communist Government was formed at the Hotel de Ville, he offered his services and was appointed, as wo have already stated, Minister of Finance. He has the character of being one of the ablest and most upright of-tho members of that destructive administration. In private life, therefore, no doubt these escaped prisoners stood high ; nor can there be a doubt that they owe their trans- portation and political disfranchisement to the possession of talents which, in tho heat of war and civil disorder, they too rashly attempted to put into application. Such men are not desirable citizens in a community of law-abiding English- men. Wo do not want fire-brands in these Colonies ; and the shiploads of incendiaries, who committed or took part in the commission of the petroleum horrors while Paris was in a state of soigo, who murdered the Archbishop of Paris (Monseigneur D'ARBOY), Abbe DEOUBRRB, and other hostages at La Roquette, are certainly quite near enough to these shores when they are in safe custody on the Island of New Caledonia. We know that in British terri- tory political prisoners have always found refuge, and we know UIRO that we have never followed our political pvisonors when once they havo succeeded in landing on othor shores. When SMITH O'BRIEN and his com- panions escaped from this Colony, and took flight to America, England never as much as asked for their surrender. But France has not acted in tho same way. Wo know that when JOSEPH MAZZINI, the Italian patriot, was OT a visit to Mr. STANSFELD in England, some years ago (Mr. STANSFELD being then the Vice Presideut of tho Board of Trade), the French Ministry, acting on au unfounded supposition that MAZZINI was in tho ORSINI pint, made , representations to the English Governmennt | which caused Lord PALMERSTON to reqniro Mr. STANSFELD'S resignation. Again, when the Liberator of Italy, GAitiBAT.ni, paid a visit to the same country, similar influences were brought to bear, and the groat general had to make tracks homeward, without responding to a tithe of the invitations which he had accepted. OLIVIER, the first Minister in NAPOLEON'S Government whon war was declared by France, but who lied to England when the fortunes of his country needed his services most, re. mained undisturbed in England, as did the deceased despot who found his way to the imperial throne by a bloody massacre, only i paralleled by some of the darkest deeds of the Commune. Still we should not, because of our clemuncy, suffer the risk of having the scum of Paris thrown on our hands. On this point the Sydney Morning Herald says :-*' The arrival of these prisonors will also justify the apprehen- sion which has been already expressed, that the Australian Colonies have something to fear from tho establishment of a large penal establishment in such close neighbourhood. Some time since, representations were mado to the French Govern- ment on the subject, and assurances wero given that the survoillance would bo so complete as to | prevent the possibility of escape. New Caledonia is being made a receptacle for the worst kind of French prisoners. It is stated that a transport ship will leave the citadel of St. Martin-de-Re" .¡very three months with fresh batches of prisonors for Noumea. The circumstances in connection with the escape of the Communist prisoners will no doubt load to further corres- pondence upon the subject between England and France." It is evident that the promised mrveillance has hitherto been anything hut com- plete, nnd it will become the Earl of DERRY to bring that fact under the notice of the Due lo BROOME. As the Argus points out, this could be done " without the slightest discourtesy nid without any risk whatover of a present or prospectivo disturbance of tho good feeling subsisting between the two countries, ''e (Lord DEitnv) could point to tho strenuous and suc- cessful resistance offered by those Colonies to any and every propisition for continuing to i maintain a penal settlement in even the remotest I and most isolated member nf the group ; and he would no doubt remind t!i3 Due de BIUHIMB and his colleagues that the establishment by England of a convict dopôt within easy reach of a French settlement-Réunion, for examplo-would be extremely distasteful, nnd possibly disastrous, to the inhabitants of that island. Such repre- sentations and remonstrances, wo may bo perfectly certain, would meet with the same respectful consideration at the hands of tho I French Government which similar expostulations would reçoive from the Cabinet of Mr. Dis KAKIM if these Colonies belonged to France, and England was about to pour the whole of her worst convicts into the Island of New Cale- donia." In any caso, however, UOUIIBFOUT and his comrades, while they remain on theso shores will have to submit to British rule, and find some- thing better to do than excite people to acts of violence and sedition. TUB Editor of tho Queensland Church News has placed himself in a very awkward dilemma. Ho has sot up os a reprover of literary pilfering, and has brought upon himself tho charge, proved from his own publication, of being a most bare faced practisor of tho offence ho so properly, but, considering his cloth, for we presume he is a parson» so very unsparingly condemns. It is astonishing with how bitter a hatred teachers and preachers of tho message of love eau hato one another, and with what gusto thoy scent out, and hold up to opprobrium tho peccadilloes of au erring brother, turning up their oyos tho while to heaven, as if iu unite appeal, to say how much better they are thnn their neighbours. Those in con- nection with the secular prosa sometimes do captious and ill-natured things, but thou they are of the earth aarthly, and politics and the dissensions of a worldly public may sour thoir tempera ; but for puro spite and venom, especially when wliiningly glossed over with an affected latnontation for a backsliding brother, commend ns tn a " religious paper " that has the misfortune to have a clerical editor. There aro exceptions to this sweeping charge, but thoy but provo tho rulo. At auy rato, the Queensland Church l\'mvs and its editor do not como under tho exception ; and we venture to say no lay-Editor would, without some note of dissent or extenuation, have inserted so gravo a charge on BO slight grounds as has the Editor of " the Church JVeira for tho diocese of Tasmania " in pub- lishing iii last number of that periodical the letter of his Queensland compeer, answered by tho Editor of the Christian Witness in anathor column of this morning's Mercury.

It appears that at about 4 o'clock, Chaffey was assisting to moor a boat at the Prince's Steps. While so engaged his hat blew into the water, and drifted outwards. Chaffey then got into into a small punt that was lying near, and paddled out with the intention of recover- ing the hat. When he had proceeded a short distance off the Esplanade, several people there observed that he seemed to have lost all command over the boat, and they urged him to pull in shore. But he gave no heed to their advice, and persisted in his efforts. It was next observed that he had lost one of the paddles, and was sitting at the stern of the boat which was gradually driftings seawards. On observing this two men named respectively George Davis and - Atkins took a fishing boat belonging to the latter, and went in pursuit. They reached the boat containing Chaffey about mid- channel and took it in tow, strongly urging Chaffey to come into their boat. This he obstinately refused to do, saying that he would remain in the punt and steel her. With that they sailed for home, having in tow the boat. On nearing the Iron Works Atkins and Davis saw Chaffey come to the bow of the punt, which action caused her to swamp, and the occupant to fall into the water Atkins immediately took down sail, and George Davis, without divesting himself of his clothing jumped into the water and struck out in the direc- tion of Chaffey, who had been carried some consider- able distance away. The noble act of Davis was unsuccessful, for Chaffey had disappeared for the last time when Davis had got about nine yards from him. It was with great difficulty that Davis got on board Atkins' boat again. Early on Sunday morning two of Weir's boats manned by volunteers, and the Marine Board boat were dragging for the body of the deceased, but without any success. Dragging was resumed in the evening, but no trace of the body was discovered. The deceased was only fifteen years and three months old, and was the son of Mr William G. Chaffey of upper Liver- pool street. He was apprenticed to Mr John McGregor, shipbuilder.

On Thursday last Canon Bromby had the pulpit, the lectern, the reading desk, and other portions of the furniture draped in black for Good Friday. This cane to the knowledge of the church wardens and on Friday morning one of their number went into the Cathedral shortly before the service which began at half past seven, and removed the drapery. He then requested the bell-ringer to inform the Incumbent of the course he had taken, and to state that it was done with the full consent of his brother churchwarden appointed by the parishioners and he believed it would meet with the approval of the other churchwarden. The ser- ices during the day were held without the drapery. Yesterday morning it was found necessary to dis pense with the usual sermon, the fact being that the wind had blown down the material which had been placed in the space awaiting the arrival of a window and the draught was so strong that it was thought advisable to do without the discourse. The evil was remedied before the evening. The organ which has been removed from the old building under the superintendance of Mr Mackenzie of Melbourne, was used for the first time at the Good Friday and Easter services, the effect of the tones of the instrument in the new building being exceeedingly fine.
