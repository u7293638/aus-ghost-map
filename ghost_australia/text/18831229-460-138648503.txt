SPORTING NOTES FROM HOME. BY ROBIN HOOD. LONDON, Nov. 16. I sent an account of the race for the Liver pool Cup in a supplementary letter last week, so have only a few further remarks to make in reference thereto. First, then, I may as well at once say that the victory, of Boswell was anything but a popular om,, for, to quote a well-known writer in Ashore and Afioat, "'Tricky | very, very, very tricky, were the movements in connexion with Boswell." The writer goes on to show how on his form in £b?,Trial Stakes at Newmarket, a fortnight before (tia one solitary appearand^ Ibis yeai jri public), he had not a ghost of a sfepw. ^ Still I expect CharleB 4*pber much for popularity, Vu'is something more substaa^al. got that, ao I presftii^ ^will pot olyecfcto being Jald that " t^p^blic *flj. nnlr 3*? winners when his horses are successful. Hi V* is too " clever," or has that reputation al any rate, and backers of horses are well aware that they are indeed playing with fire if they meddle with his animals before all the " nps and downs" of market finme havp been gone through, and the " pea" at last disclosed; but then probably too late for any one but those directly in the " know" to get on. Thus, on the Saturday before the Liverpool Cup was ran for, I believe as much as 40 to 1 was betted that the horse did not run. yet he started first favourite at 5 to 1, which wonld have been 5 to 2 if the horses had been 10 minutes longer at the post, so strong was the run on him and so eager were the public to get on at any price when it waB Known to be "all right' Poor unlucky Tonans was second again; but Bos well won pretty easily. Tonans ran in Mr. J. W. Smith's colours, dark blue jacket and sky-blue cap, as Mr. Long had, before starting for Australia, made over his interest in the animal to Mr. Smith, the agree ment, I believe, being that if Tonans won a race before Mr. Long's lease of him had expired, the latter gentleman should receive £200 of the stakes. 1 am sorry we are not likely to see Mr. Long back with us next season, and I fear his experiences this season have not been pleasant ones. He was far from satisfied with the running of Tonans in the Cesare witch, and with good reason. 1 believe this and Condor's show at Sandown, when odds were laid on the horse, were the immediate causes of the removal of the horses from Brown's charge. Poor Captain H. Hanbury died on Saturday last from tbe effects of the accident he met with some 10 days before at the Lewes Autumn Meeting. Mr. Hanbury, who was riding his own horse, Benedict, in the South down Club open Plate, struck into a post, and was heavily thrown. Concussion of the brain was the result, and tide poor fellow never afterwards recovered consciousness. The flat race season is "dying hard." I think I have used this very phrase for the last six years during which "Robin Hood's" contributions have been favoured with a place in your columns, so 1 hope the editor will allow it to go for thiB, the seventh time, and then I will promise to find another next year. But, joking apart, the fields hare been really enormously strong the last week, more especially at Derby, which came to a close to-day, and where the liberal amount of added money deserves the patronage it obtains. Sere there are valuable 'stakes to be gained, and horses have been run out honestly now the end is at hand, and the winter's keep staring owners in the face has induced them to run for the "ready dollar" rather than "scheme" with an eye to the future. The two races at Shrewsbury worthy of full details I will at once append without much comment: THE GEEAT SHROPSHIRE HANDICAP, Of 500 so vs., added to a sweepstakes of 20 so vs. each,, 10ft.; winners extra; second saved 6take.

Medicus was the absolute last, and either a terrible mistake was made in his Cambridge shire trials, or he has gone off altogether. The latter is probably the more likely. Thebais won pretty easily, and on her Cambridgeshire form was well backed. I think I said in my last she could have been placed in that race if ridden out. Boswell failed to carry the extra weight, and the money was hardly down like one of Charles'", good things. On Wednesday the Shrewsbury Cup was the attraction ; it resulted as follows: THE SHEEWSBCBY CDF, Handicap, of 300 SOTS., added to a sweepstakes of 20 so vs. each, 10 ft; entrance 3 so vs.; winners ertra ; the second saved stake. About two miles. 19 sabs. Mr. A. Victor's b g Donald, by Albert Victor Flora Macdonald, 5 yre, 6st 131b. (carried 7st) (Rawlinson) 1 Sir F.

The result was a great surprise, as Donald ia only a hunter, and until lately has never attempted handicap performances. Corrie Roy tued at last, and Donald's light weight got him home somewhat easily, although the verdict was but three parts of a length. Poor Tonans nearly slipped up twice, and was thus left hopelessly in the rear; indeed it was with the greatest difficulty Barrett kept his seat The horse ran without plates, and (say the papers) this was absurd, as the' ground was so greasy. For my own part I have little doubt that he would have slipped with plates on as well as off. for it was the result of a scrimmage in the first place which got him out of his stride and fairly put him out ol the race. He is an un lucky noise, truly. , . . I really don't think I need write more on racing matters this week, as although, as I have said, there were enormous fields at Derbyt there was nothing like a classic race or weight forage race of any note; and it would be of little interest to my readers to go into details; further, as I know this letter will arrive when your sporting columns will be oc« cupied . with matters oflocaj ijiierast, J wiU[ cut mybudeet as short as I xacp.-Before jafc next the racing season pf 1883 ww~be .pyjeh and other sporting matters pf inw^ii fp*' claim attention. , ra'ss&fL;'-l Mr. Alcock, secretary of tl}e Sorrey C.^X» has received any number of appJjcfrtipna from counter towns begging him to arrangq matches with the coming Australian Eleven.
