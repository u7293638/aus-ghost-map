With 'each 'dem?ise' ' Mr.e Bixby grew less affectionate.

"Did I frighten you?" said the voice iof'a it fellow-boarder." "I didn't• know you- were f nervous. I am dreadfully, but you are'al- b ways so composed. It-la only to give you c your letters. I brought them from the n osice." ' o " Thank you," said Mrs. Bixby. " I think d I musthave been asleep," and as the other lady a passed on, she turned the missives overin her lap. There were five of them; one; a letter with a black seal, Mrs. Bixby tore it open. \- It- was- as-she had--expected.- Her--Uncle Jededialh, aged ninety, was dead. That was sad. . , Mra. Bixby took out her handkerchief, and I read on. Her uncle had left all his money to, I the Asylum for Attorneys' Orphans. This I was sadder. still. The handkerchief was .wet in an instant, and as her tears fell, Mr.. Bix- a by's voice fell on her ear.:: - " " I've come back, Tilly.. ,Ipromised to wait i for some one who is going to the beach.

P room to weep, with more freedom. She did not even go down to dinner that evening, and ' Mr. Bixby did 'not come up to ask why. 1? About midnight there .was consternation in if the hotel. Mrs. Bixby.was making inquiries 1, about Mr. Bixby; and the last seen of him st was in the water. Various persons knew of his entering it in his handsome bathing dress. s. Nobody had seen him come out. There was it great excitement with the' coming dawn. us Various young ladies reported him as " swim e uming beautifully" at five o'clock. He had r- tried to teach one to swim. so It was evident that he was drowned. Mrs. as Bixby was going from one room into another. at' upstairs, and. calling on her. dear, darling, ap lovely Augustus, to forgive her her:coldness.

However, Mrs. Bixby, having a good deal 'in her power, was not as often snubbed in the future as she had been in the past. Her hus band no longer flirted in her presence, and shle considers herself an exceedingly happy' wo man, and is very fond of repeating the story of Mr. Birby's adventures, which she has no doubt the whole world believes as thoroughly as she does.
