V&e; £2 area Morning j5.er«lö THURSDAY, JULY 18, 1878. PROFESSOR PEARSON made his Parliamentary debut in Victoria by an able, temperate, and evidently carefully prepared speech, when proposing the usual reply to the GOVERNOR'S address. The part of it that most interests us, however, is one in which we are not able to agree with him. In defending the Government proposal for practically annihilating the Upper House, so far as all financial legislation is concerned, he rested his argument on the ground that there ought not to be, and that practically there could not be, two representative Chambers in the same community and that it was a delusion to suppose that because a House was elective, therefore it was representative. Butas a matter of fact duplicate representative Chambers do exist, and have existed for many years. When the United States separated from the mother country they instinctively gave the preference to the bi-cameral system, but it seemed inconsistent under a Republican form of Government to have a nominated Senate, and an elected Senate was therefore substituted. That Senate is certainly representative as well as elected. Though it is chosen in a different way and by different constituencies, it is not the less representative than the Lower House is. Not ' only is the Senate elected and representative, but it has in some important respects greater power than the Lower House has, and can deal with some of the highest questions of State in secret State. Every State in the Union has also its two Houses for its local Parliament. Both Houses are elected, and both Houses are representative. In some of those Australian colonies we have also elected Senates, and it is putting a new meaning upon words to say that they are not representative. In Victoria the mistake has been made of giving the power of choosing the Upper House to too small a constituency. The Legislative Council there undoubtedly wants its basis broadened, and its influence and popularity increased but still, though im- perfectly, it is unquestionably representative. Nor is there, theoretically, any objection to two representative Chambers for the same constituency. The argument of Professor PEARSON rests on his assumption which he states as if it were indisputable-that one Chamber must necessarily represent the whole community, and that therefore anything else must either be superfluous or contradictory. But it is not true at least under any mode of election that we have yet adopted -that the Legislative Assembly is completely and perfectly representative. On the contrary it is a matter of constant lamentation that these popular assemblies do not do full justice to the country they profess to represent, and this is especially the case where the system of single constituencies is adopted, and where no provision exists for the representation of minorities. At the last general election in Victoria several seats were carried by very small majorities, and a calculation of the votes of the whole community showed that there was a very large minority that was very largely unrepresented, and that that minority did not have its proportionate influence in the Assembly. No method that is quite satisfactory has yet been hit upon for rectifying these defects, but the existence of an elective Senate does to some extent tend to correct them and it is a fact that a Parliament with two elective Chambers, if the arrangements for election are judiciously managed, is likely as a whole to give a more complete representa- tion of the community than one Chamber by itself could possibly do. So that not only is it a fact that two such Chambers can co-exist, and do co-exist, but that there is good reason in the nature of things why they should co-exist. There does seem, however, some reason based on experience for asserting that it is inconvenient to have two elective Chambers, unless they have very nearly, if not quite, coequal powers. If we so far depart from the aristocratic model of the mother country as to abandon the system of a nominated Upper House, then it would seem that we should also abandon the mother country's theory about giving to the Lower House the exclusive control over the public purse. That theory grew up out of the strife of the people against monarchical and aristocratic influences and where these influences do not exist to be contended for the theory no longer applies, and the attempt to apply it is misleading and mischievous. The dead-lock in Victoria have arisen, not from the fact that there were two representative Chambers, or that they were both elective, but from the fact that one of them had the power of exceeding its rights, while the other had no proper power of protecting its rights. Every dead-lock in Victoria has been due to an attempt on the part of the Assembly to make a tack. This attempt was a straining of its constitutional rights, and I to that extent was an infringement of the rights of the other House. It was cost under the Constitution to make this attempt, because there was nothing to prevent it - but it was not easy for the Upper House to resist it, and it could only do so by refusing the Appropria- tion Bill. It is obvious that there are two possible remedies against such dead-looks, the first is to prevent the Lower House from ever making a tack, and the second is to give the Upper House the power of detaching the tack. The first, however, would be a very awkward arrangement and it is obvious that the second remedy is much the simpler. If on every occasion the Legislative Council in Victoria had had the power of detaching from the Appropriation Bill the obnoxious portion there would have been no dead-lock at all. The rea- soning, therefore, on which the Ministerial policy in Victoria is based are not strictly in harmony with facts. They do not recognise the facts, and the remedy proposed goes far beyond the necessity which has really arisen. The particular evil is distinctly traceable to a particular cause, and the proper remedy is to deal exactly with that cause, and not to go and search out broad theories which are altogether away from the facts of colonial experience. THE money received into the Treasury of New South Wales during the six months ended 30th June, 1878, including the balance brought forward, amounted to £7,622,740; out of which was paid, during the same period, the sum of £3,833,449, leaving a credit balance of £3,689,201. Of this balance the banks hold £3,108,858, and the Treasury chest 2.80 433. The balance at the credit of the Consoli- dated Revenue Fund is £2,119,856, which, with the £1,825,000 lent to the Loan Fund, becomes £3,944,856.

The items grouped together under the head of excise distillation a, sugar, licenses, harbour dues, fees and fines- Sec, have produced less in both periods. The Post Office, electric telegraphs, and railways have given liberal increase in both periods. Railways especially exhibit an aspect of prosperous activity - their income having risen £21,874 in the quarter, £127,635 in the year. The most striking feature in the tables is that of the land fund, which shows a falling away of nearly half a million in the three months, and of nearly three-quarters of a million in the year. There is, however, a distinction in the official accounts between sales of land and income from lands. The comparison between these two branches stands thus: GrAn.ER _*n~_D ' JOSE. 1877. 1878.

The committee, who will meet a quarter of an hour earlier, are anxious to give all subscribers an opportunity of selecting trustees for the fund. Persons holding collecting cards are requested to send them in to the treasurer by noon to-morrow. Mr. BEAUMONT/ BENEFIT. The reappearance here of Mr. Armes Beaumont, the Australian tenor, and the welcome accorded him, demonstrated in a very flattering 'manner the fact that his absence had not in the slightest manner interfered with his popularity. He took a farewell benefit at the Victoria Theatre last night, when that establishment was attended by an audience that filled it in every part. The piece chosen for presentation was " The Bohemian Girl," in which Mr. Beaumont impersonated Thaddeus, the character we believe he assumed when he first publicly put forth his efforts as an operatic artist. At that time and for a "fair period afterwards his reputation as a tenor singer ranked in the highest degree of excellence. Since then apparently a too generous use of his voice has disarranged some of his vocal charms, but fortunately their replacement evidently depends upon a short interval of rest, and that Mr. Beaumont intends securing by visiting England with his friend Mr. W. S. Lyster one of the most spirited entrepreneurs Australia has ever been favoured with. They will leave Sydney by the City of Sydney this afternoon, and we think all theatrical patrons as well as those engaged in stage operations will unite in wishing both of them a pleasant journey. During his representation of Thaudcus, last night, Mr. Beaumont had frequently to acknowledge the compliments of the audience, and at the conclusion of his exertions he was called before the curtain to receive their final expressions of favour accompanied by a shower of bouquets. THEATRE ROYAL Mrs. Scott Siddons, who has enjoyed a theatrical success achieved by few actresses who have visited the colonies, made her last appearance on the Australian stage at least for a time at the Theatre Royal last night. The house was one worthy of the merits of an actress who has done much to raise the tone of the drama in the principal cities of the continent. Wisely, we think, he chose to appear as Rosalind, in " As You Like It a character which suits her perhaps better than any other in her repertoire. It was also appropriate, inasmuch as it was the first character in which she appeared in Australia. The fact that the representation has not been decreased in public favour is a sufficient proof of its intrinsic excellence. Of the:.' other actors last night it may be said that they did their best to make the performance a success, Mw Chaplin's Jaques being a very creditable render jr ing of the part. At the close of the piece Id ka,, Siddons recited "The Maniac" with good elocutionary effect. It may be stated, that Mrs. Siddons was called before the curtain at the end of each act, and received a perfect a/ newer of bouquets. Before the curtain fell, she addressed a few words of farewell to the audience. AIRMEN pressing her thanks for the kindness that had always been shown her, she apologised for not being g' able to put more Shakespearian plays on the stage. Experience had, however, taught her that pieces reach as "The Colleen Bawn," "UncleTom'» Catiii," &c.;, drew far better houses and although she considered that her playing in such dramas was like putting a thoroughbred to do the work of a cat 4-horse, still, as directress of the theatre, she did (not feel justified in putting Shakespearian plays on the stage. Her thanks were due to each member of the Company for the able assistance rendered by them, and also to the stage-manager and the other officials of the theatre. Her return was, of course, problematical, but if she did come back she hoped to miss no familiar faces. At the conclusion of her address, Mrs. Siddons was warmly applauded. On Tuesday morning last a deputation of ladies, including some of the leading members of Sydney society, waited on Mrs. Scott-Siddons to request her acceptance of a farewell souvenir from some of the many warm friends and admirers whom that accomplished lady will leave behind her in this city. The gift consists of a massive gold chain and locket, bearing a suitable inscription, and with the word "souvenir" set in a spray of diamonds. In a few graceful and appropriate remarks the recipient expressed her gratitude for the presentation, and her sorrow at parting with so many valued friends. " FINK DOMIHOSS." - This popular comedy continues to draw large houses at the Queen's Theatre. It is announced that it will be repeated to-night and until further notice. D'Axcv READ'S GHOST EirnrarAnauNr.-Lait night, Mr. D' ArcyRead'« Ghost entertainment was in aid of the Guild Hall library and the attendance, it is pleasing to record, was exceptionally large. The programme was similar to that given on previous occasions, and appeared to be thoroughly enjoyed by the audience. The optical illusions were excellently' managed, and the incidental music and comicalities, including the " Phantom Christy's," were very well executed. This week is announced as positively the last of the season. SKATING AT TawsRAxca HALL A large and select audience assembled at the Temperance' Hall, yesterday afternoon, at a complimentary benefit. given to Mr. Wyburd. Mr. Wyburd, among other evolutions jumped over three hurdles composed of flags about three feet in height, and one foot apart. After which he jumped backwards on one foot over the same hurdles. The roller-skates used by' Mr. Wyburd were made expressly to his order by Messrs. Lassetter and Co., and are so constructed as to facilitate describing a circle in a very small space of zoom. CIVIL SERVICE MUSICAL SOCIETY. Yesterday evening the members of this society gave their second concert of the present season in the Masonic Hall. There was a very large audience, the floor and gallery being densely crowded. The programme was divided into two parts, of which the first, and principal, was Coleridge's cantata, "The Ancient Mariner." The music of this composition (by J. S". Barnett) is much more difficult of performance than that of some' previous cantatas rendered by the society, and if it was given less successfully, that must be taken into consideration. Some of the best vocalists were unable, through indisposition, to take part in the entertainment. Altogether there were about sixty voices, and from twenty to twenty-five instruments engaged in the concert. Whether the proportion of the latter was too great or not may be a matter of opinion, but the orchestra in parts of the cantata left themselves open to the objection that they overpowered the choir. The parts of the cantata most worthy of notice were the chorus beginning " The upper air burst into life into which the imitation of a storm was appropriately introduced-and the joyous chorus with which the cantata closes, which was also effectively performed, though the imitation of a little vesper bell was decidedly unmusical. Among the solos, the one most deserving of mention for its excellence was that beginning OF sleep it is a gentle thing," and it was very sweetly sung. A duet, "But tell me, tell me, speak again," was also a pleasing feature of the night's performance. The solos generally, without being remarkable, went smoothly ; the parts of the performance in which there was most room for improvement being several of the choruses, in which some want of harmony was discernible. The applause of the audience was less marked than at some previous concerts of the society. The entertainment concluded with some miscellaneous selections of music, beginning with Bishop's jubilant chorus, "Tramp." An instrumental quartette for piano, violin, alto, and violoncello gave a very creditable performance from Beethoven. The song "Softly sighs" was magnificently sung by a good soprano voice, and was deservedly applauded.' This quartettes "Lovely Night" and "Maying" also afforded much pleasure to the audience. The concert at closed about 11 o'clock. Mr. G. D. Callen was As conductor, and Mr. C. B. Foster the accompanist ,'
