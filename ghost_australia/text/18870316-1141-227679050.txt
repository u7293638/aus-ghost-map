Handicapping Grievance. To the Editor of the Sporiman. . Dear Sib, â€” If you will kindlj allow mo epace in your columns for a few linee with reference to the treatment Glowlight baa been receiving from the handicapper, Mr. YowIfb, who in every baodieap puts eucb a weight upon him that he has not a ghost of uuniiuc ui njuuni aurcco uinu nic luuuue above bim be has been conceding lumps of weight to. For instance, in the Kilmore H.A.C.B. Handicap Glowlight heads the list at 8af . 41b., Jurassic, 7st. 101b. ; at Sejmour, on 22nd ult., Jurassic carried 61b. more than Glowlight, and gave him fully half a atone of a beating. Now Glowlight hea to give Jurassic 81bs. at Lsncefield in the Town Plate. Glowlight was giving Hector 111b., who beat bim at Sejmour, carrying lib. more. I could enumerate several other instances, but I think this will be sufficient to show that Glowlight, who is a much overrated horse, has not been receiving fair play from the bsndicappers. He started no less than thirteen time" this year, and only won one small race. Apologising for the epace I have taken ud. voure. etc . Justice.
