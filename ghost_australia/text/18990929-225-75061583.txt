The Flight of the Years. When one by one the silent stately years Glide like pale ghosts beyond our yearn ing sight, Vainly we stretch our arms to stay their flight, So soon, so swift, they pass to endless night l We hardly learn to name them, To praise them or to blame them, To know their shadowy faces, Ere we see their empty places I Only once the glad spring greets them, Only once fair summer meets them, Only once the autumn glory Tells for them its mystic story. Only once the winter hoary Wears for them its robes of light! Years leave their work half done; like men, alas! With sheaves ungathered to. their graves they pass, And are forgotten. What they strive to do Lives for a while in memory of a few, Then.over all Oblivion's waters flow The years are buried in the long ago.
