THURSDAY, OCTOBER 17, 1878. According to arrangement, tho vote for public instruction was moved last night in committee of supply, and the Minister took advantage of the oppor- tunity to explain various matters con- nected with ¿is department. The lion, gentleman necessarily covered a great deal of ground in the course of his remarks, but wo must content ourselves for tho present with some brief allu- sions to the principal topics touched on. Part of his speech was taken up in endeavouring to justify his past action, and part in explaining his proposals with regard to future proceedings. As a matter of course, the gallant major took credit for the admirable condition into which, according to his own state- ment, he has brought the Educational affairs of the colony. For instance, there is no public office, ho says, in which hon. members are received with more courtesy or meet with prompter attention than Lis own. And the staff, while wonderfully efficient, is extraordi- narily cheap as compared with similar bodies in other countries. We are willing to admit that the staff is efficient so far as it goes, but the reports furnished by some of the inspectors lead us to infer that it does not go far enough. Of course, if it can be shown that it is not 1 sufficiently numerous for the work it has to perform, its cheapness ceases to be a merit. Major SMITH alluded to the I changes he had made in the Training Institution, and as far as we can understand him, nothing more than a suitable building on the Uni- versity-reserve is needed to give us everything in this shape we can possibly desire. This opinion, however, does not exactly tally with that expressed by Mr. GLADMAN, tho superintendent of this part of the machinery, who says in his report, " My conviction is that the train "ing is the weakest part of our edu " cational system." The number of truant officers, we are I told, has been considerably increased, and tho sphere of their operations has been enlarged. The result has boen an increase in the attendance, but as this was an almost inevitable consequence, wo refuse to regard it as a positive triumph of administration. The effect of tiio celebrated flogging circular ha3 been most satisfactory-at least so wo are assured. The discipline of the schools is said to be unimpaired. Mr. MACKAY, however, who has some experience in connexion with theso mattera, tolls a very different tale. He declares that the Minister does not hear everything perhaps he does not wish to do so but that if he did, he would know that in some instances disciplino has been utterly destroyed by his ill- advised meddling and maudlin humanitariaiiism. The bon. member for Sandhurst states that so great has been the demorali- sation caused, that some teackers actually allow attempts at personal violence to pass unnoticed, rather than report them to their principals. Punishment is not popular at head quartets. The Great Panjandrum lias said that order can be maintained with- out it, and anyone venturing to prove him wrong must do so at his peril. Tho boards of advice were patted on the back, and asked to exert themselves in a variety of ways. While, however, they remain in their present power- less condition, we do not fancy they will respond very heartily. By way of encouraging them to pcrse veie in their almost degrading tasks, Major SMITH hinted at tho possibility of the truant officers being placed under their control. If ho had tried his hardest he could not have hit upon a moio injudicious proposal. If the boards were active in prosecuting tho parents of absentees, they would create a host of enemies, and soon resign in disgust ; if thoy abstained from taking piocecdings, they would fail in their duty, and defeat one of the main pur- poses of the act. After a great deal of preliminary skirmishing with theso and other matters of a similar nature, the Minister had to grasp his nettle, and endeavour to justify his action in reducing the salaries of the teachers without reference to Parliament. So great, it appears, is " the major's" contempt for legislative control, that ho oould not even comply with the pro- vision of tho Education Act, which requires that all regulations lespecting the salaries of teachers shall be laid before both Houses, if sitting, " within fourteen " days after the making thereof." Surely tho Assembly should have something to say concerning this flagrant disregard of its authority. But leaving hon. members to vindicate their own dignity, we may say that, in our opinion, the explana- tion offered was most unsatisfactory. It appears that last year the estimates for salaries, _cc, showed an advance of £32,000 on those submitted for the pre- vious twelve months. For the current 3'ear an additional sum of .£22,000 was asked in the first instance, but the Cabinet, after consideration, insisted that a similar amount to that granted in 1877-8 must be made to do. The determination of Ministers of course arose from their affectionate regard for the present system. They were horri- bly afraid that if the country kept faith with ' the teachers, and tho esti- mates continued to grow year by year, the grand scheme of national education we at present possess would break down by its own weight, <fcc. T1Ù3 may be interpreted, we suppose, as meaning that with a stationary or falling revenue it was very inconvenient to bring for- ward increased estimates. However this may be, the estimates were taken back and reduced some £20,000 by the very simple process of taking sums varying from £2 15s. to £79 15s. off the in- comes of the teachers. The teachers naturally object to this method of making things pleasant for tho Ministry but uncomfortable for themselves, and we think they are likely to meet with numerous sympathisera. As Mr. MAC- KAY pointed out last night, they suffered pecuniary loss when the new act came into operation, and have not as yet received that which was to gild the pill, viz., admission to the civil service. Is it fair, then, to subject them to another squeeze merely because money is running short, especially when a new and permanent plan of classifica- tion is contemplated. Our readers will find the proposed scheme of classification set forth in de- tail in another column. We refrain from expressing any opinion on it at present, as a matter of such importance requires some consideration. We may call attention, however, to the fact that the scheme submitted last night is not the production of Professor PEAR-ON, but of a number of gentlemen having practical knowledge of the subject. After giving a thousand pounds for a report on tho steps necessary to effect a completo reform in every branch of his department, tho Minister found himself compelled to have recourse to the permanent officers of his department. Surely this is rather a ridiculous climax to the Pear- son job. The plan adopted possesses many good points we are assured to commend it to the teachers. It may reduce some of their salaries, but then it admits thom to all tho privileges of the civil service. What these are (after Black Wednesday) it would bo difficult to say. Major SMITH dwelt with unction on the alleged facts that his proposals would sweep away patron- age and confer certain definite rights on the teachers with regard to promotion, &c.; It is no great merit, however, on his part to surrender patronage in con- nexion with the Educational depart- ment, as appointments which neces- sitate an examination are not greatly in demand ; while, as to tho rights spoken of, they are purely imaginary A reckless Minister with the connivance of a friendly Governor would make short work of such paper defences. _ Some correspondence han been pub- lished by the Government of Queens- land respecting a juncti<_ of the railway systems of that colony and of South Australia. . It arose out of a resolution adopted at the conference held in this city last May, affirming the desirability of an interchange of views on the subject between the Governments of the colonies on the mainland ; and the Chief Secre- tary of Queensland has entered into the project veiy cordially. Li reply to the head of tho Adelaide Ministry, Mr. DOUGLAS re- marks that an intercolonial system of railways connecting Melbourne, Adelaide, Sydney, and Brisbane, with the northorn seaboard of Australia, would not only opon, up tho richest pastoral regions of tho interior, but would also contribute largely to tho bringing about of a. federal union "To build oven 3,000 miles of " railway,"

in the As sembly yesterday, in a Bpeech of mora than two hours duration The address was very important, because in it tha hon gentleman submitted a scheme for the reclassification of teachers In the firat in- stance, however, the Minister ran over tha story of the department for the last 12 months, and bore testimony to the efficiency of the Btaff of the central office, say ing that it does more work and receives less remuneration than the Btaff of any other Government department Major Smitu then defended his action in the singing and drawing question and in issuing the anti flogging circular About the success of the latter document the hon gentleman is enthusiastic, and he announces his deter ruination to adhere to his policy An article in the London Spedator has greatly cheered the Minister in his course With regard to the reduction made in tno teachers salaries this year, Major Smith aaya that his original estimates showed an in crease of £22,000 on last year s vote and the Cabinet was unanimous in deciding ia» he should take them back, and re- duce them to the previous amount.

cflorts of the clergy, but for whom, declared the Minister, "the separata BJ stem would collupae and a more humane and Christian spirit would grow up Major Smith denies that the teaching 111 the state

Parliament prior to their being acted upon Mr Mackay objects altogether to the teachers having their incomes cut down every time the Minister requires to eflcct a saving, and he says that no other

own hands ' This sarcasm 'brought bothMr E Clark andMr MacBainon their legs with a defence of their constituents, «ho, they said, had been led astray by Mr Woods original announcement that the Uno would bo opened without fail on the 31st of January, and who would suffer a grievous loss if tho promise were not kept Mr Woods retorted on Horsham somewhat severely The moving cause of the agita-

opinion that the adoption of this proposal would lead to the breaking up of the present system of free, secular, and compulaory education He therefore urged tho Council to pass a unanimous vote approving of the present system The réso- lution was seconded by the Rov J Walker, of Ballarat, who, however, expressed himself very much dissatisfied with the administra tion of the act, and the rigid spirit of secu- larism in which it was interpreted The next speaker, the Rev A Goaman, although in favour of the main principles of the present act, expressed himself diBappomtcd with the

Under the circumstances it was for the Court to say what should be done. His Honour said that the affidavit did not state what had been done by the officer. Mr Goldsmith admitted that the affidavit was not very explicit but he thought it was sufficient to justify him in asking for an order to dispense with personal service of the notice upon Slack, and to ask that delivery of the notice at Slack's house should be deemed sufficient and that the application for the attachment should be postponed for a week. His Honour said he would postpone the case for a week but he did not consider the affidavit of Mays contained sufficient materials to justify him in making an order to dispense with service of the notice on Slack personally. The case was adjourned for a week. Councillor Story, the mayor elect of Mel bourne, accompanied by Mr Councillor Pit don, tho present mayor, and Mr Fitzgibbon, the town clerk, oppeared before Sir Justice Molesworth in the Supreme Court yesterday, and took tho usual oaths of office The sittings of the Central Criminal Court for October were commenced yesterday before His Honour Mr Justice Barry. A young man named George Thos. Smith pleaded guilty to embezzling moneys belonging to the Trades'-hall Society, and was remanded for sentence. Charles Weston was found guilty of receiving a watch and chain stolen from one Robert Marshall, and was remanded for sentence. Jonathan Saxby was arraigned on a charge of wounding his wife, Mary Saxby, with intent to murder her, or with intent to do her grevious bodily harm. The prisoner had been separated from his wife for some weeks and on the 18th August last he went to the place where she was living, and apparently from jealousy, stabbed her and afterwards attempted to cut his own throat The prisoner's counsel (Dr Madden) con- tended that the evidence at the utmost merely pointed to tho misdemeanour of maliciously wounding; but the jury returned a verdict of guilty with intent to do grievous bodily harm. The prisoner was remanded for sentence. A question respecting the validity of a bill of sale was raised in the interpleader case of Blamires v Evans, heard in the County Court yesterday. Blamires had issued an execu tion against Evans, when a bill of sale was set up on behalf of Mr Martin. Mr Box who appeared for Blamires contended that the bill of sale could not be set up as a valid claim against the execution. He stated that under the 13th section of the new Bills of Sales Act, the holder of any bill of sale was required once every twelve months while he held it to make an affidavit that the money it represented was still due , but in this case, Mr Martin was in England, and the affidavit had only been made by Mr Godfrey, his solicitor, which could not be allowed. Mr Quinlan, on the other hand, contended that the affidavit made by Mr Godfrey was sufficient, as he held a power of attorney from Mr Martin, who could not have made the affidavit, as he was in Eng land. His Honour Judge Cope said he con- sidered the words of the section quoted were explicit, and that the affidavit could only have been made by Mr Martin, the holder of the bill of sale, and not by his at torney. He therefore disallowed the claim set up for the bill of sale, and allowed £2 2s costs to Blamires, the creditor. It is under stood that the case will be carried to the Supreme Court on appeal.
