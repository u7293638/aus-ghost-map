A Glass of €old Water. .The following is the' apostrophe upon " A! Glass of Cold Water," by John B. Gougb: r Where is the liquor, which God theE ternal•' brewed for ..all his children ?> Not in the ^simmering still,over smoky fires choked with poisonous gases, aad surrounded with the. stench of sickening odors and; rank corrup tions, doth your Father in heaven prepare the precious essence; of 'life, the pure, cold water. Bat in the green glade and grassy'j dell where the red-,deer,.wander a,and the child loves, .to glfcys there'God ".brewsit. ..And ' downvlow down in the lowest valleys, where the fountains murmur and the rills ring; and, high upon the; tfeH-moUntain tops, where the naked granite '.glitters like gold in the Bun ; where the storm -cloud broods, and the thunder storms crash; and away far out on the wide wild sea, where the hurricane howle music and the' big .waves roar; the chorus sweeping the march of God; there he brews it—that beverage cf life jand health giving water. And everywhere; it is a :th!hg of beauty, gleaming in the dewdrop; singing in the summer rain ; shining in the ice gem till the leaves- ail seem to-turn to living jewels; spreading a goldeh wall over the setting sun; j j or a white gauze around'the midnight moon, j i Sporting in the■'cataract; .sleeping in ths ■ glacier ; dancingon the hail shower; folding i its bright snow" curtains softly about the j wintry world and weaving the many colored S iris, that seraph's zone of the sky, whose j warp is the raindrop of earth, whose woof is 1 the sunbeam of heaven all checkered over I with celestial fiowers-by the mystic hand of refraction. Still always it is beautiful, that j l life giving -water; mo poison bubbles on its i brink: !"ita foam brings, not madness and; I t , - - i brink;; its roam brings i murder : no blood stains its liquid glass; < | pale widows and starving children weep aa -i | burning tears in f.ts depth; no drunken, 3 shrieking ghost from the grave curses it is the voids of ifenalf<le3pair; ^ptak out, roy; friends, ^roniil iyoayliohiuigft^t for dernon'-e drink, alcohol?
