THE FAMILY G-ECOST. Mr. CHAMBERLAIN : We shall make those amendments in the in terests of the Empire. . . - If any autonomous colony finds the ties of England irlssome, we shall be ready to grant it complete independence. The Family Ghost, which the other day threatened to walk to some purpose, assisted by gentlemen like Mr. Griffith, N.S.W. Labor member, and others, has now to walk in another sense. The statement by Mr. Chamberlain that England will grant any dissatisfied autonomous colony its independence whenever it wishes it has taken all the starch out of its winding 3heet. If there is nothing to frighten, the occupation of the frightener is gone and the ghost becomes merely the ghost of a ghost. Evidently, Britain Is not ' taking any ;' her hair still hangs straight, her lips remain as firm as ever, her hands are extended Â«o that everyone may see that they don't tremble a little * bit. Clause 74 is going to be much more easily settled as a result of Mr. Chamber lain's declaration, which put into brutally plain English amounts to this : We are going to have a voice in a constitution which is a contract to which we are an equal party, and if the voice is objected to, then we shall decline to go on in the present pleasant ralations. In. a word, we, as the party denied the right of considering something which we are asked to create, will declare our independence.
