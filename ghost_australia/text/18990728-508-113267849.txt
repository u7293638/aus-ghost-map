THE LATE MRS. M. HAYDON Our Campbelltown correspondent writes: A very old resident of Campbelltown, Mrs. Mary Haydon, who died last week, was a prominent figure in the history of this district. She was 83 years of age, being born in 1816, four years before the place was marked out as a township. The deceased lady's parents were also natives of Campbelltown. She had resided here the whole of her life, and had a family of fourteen. There were also seventy grandchild- ren and forty great grandchildren. The late Mrs. Haydon was well acquainted with all the historic events of the place, and personally knew many of those who figured in the renowned "Fisher's Ghost" case. She was present at the time Fisher's body was recovered from the creek, and saw his remains,. The creek in question is situated in a portion of the Bradbury Park Es- tate, where the Agricultural Society's first show was recently held.
