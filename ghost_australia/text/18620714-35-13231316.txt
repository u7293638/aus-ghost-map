Earl Granville who and his col- leagues, were grouped immediately in front of the day, and v onced forward and said - " In the name of the Commissioners of the International Exhibition of 1862, I have the honour to present to your Royal Highness, your Lordships and Mr Speaker, our humble address to her Majesty In it we respectfully offer our condolences on the irreparable loss which her Majesty and the notion have sustained, and we express our gratitude to her Majesty for having appointed your Royal Highness and our colleagues as her Majesty's representatives, and we thank the Crown Prince of I russia and Prince Oscar of fowl den for their presence on this occasion In it we describe the rise and progress of the Exhibition and the manner in which we propose to reward merit We express our thanks to the Foreign and British Commissioners who have aided us in the work, and we express a humble hope that this undertaking may not be unworthy to take its place among the periodically recurring exhibitions of the world ' Lord Granville then handed to the Duke of Cambridge the following address, of which his speech was a brief summary - ' May it please your Royal Highness and my Lords Commissioners - ' We the Commissioners for the Exhibition of 1862, humbly beg leave to approach her Majesty through you, her illustrious representatives on this occasion, with the assurance of our devotion to her Majesty's throne and Royal person And first of all it is our melancholy duty to convey to her Majesty the expression of our deep sympathy with her in the grievous affliction with which it has pleased the Almighty to visit her Majesty and the whole people of this realm in the death of her Royal Consort We cannot forget that this is the anniversary of the opening of the first great International Exhibition eleven years ago by her Majesty, when his Royal Highness as President of the Commissioners of that Exhibition, addressed her Majesty in words that will not be forgotten After stating the proceedings of the Commission in the discharge of their duties he concluded with a prayer that on undertaking which had for its end the promotion of all branches of human industry, and the strengthening of the bonds of peace and friendship among all nations of the earth might, be the blessing of Divine Providence, con- duce to the welfare of her Majesty's people, and be long remembered among the brightest circumstances of her Majesty's peaceful and happy reign ' ' When we commenced our duties, and until a recent period we ventured to look forward to the time when it might be our great privilege to address her Majesty in person this day, and to show to her Majesty within these walls the evidence which this Exhibition affords of the soundness of the opinion originally entertained by his Royal Highness evidence furnished alike by the increased extent of the Exh bition, by the eagerness with which all classes of the community have sought to take part in it, and by the large expenditure incurred by individual exhibitors for the better display of their produce and machinery. We can now only repeat the assurance of our sympathy with her Majesty in the bereavement which deprives this inaugural ceremony of her Royal presence and, while bearing mournful testimony to the loss of that invaluable assistance which his Royal Highness was so ready at all times to extend to us, we have to offer to the Queen our dutiful thanks for the interest evinced by her Majesty in this undertaking by commanding our Royal Highness and your Lordships to represent her Majesty on this occasion " Our respectful thanks are also due to their Royal High refuses the Crown Prince of Prussia and Prince Oscar of Sweden, the presidents of the commissions for those countries, for the honour which their Royal Highnesses have done us in coming to England for the purpose of attending this ceremony in the attendance of his Royal Highness the Crown Prince of Prussia we recognise a cordial deference to the wishes of our Sovereign and a tribute of affec- tion to the memory of his illustrious and beloved father in law " It now becomes our duty to submit to her Majesty a short statement of the circumstances connected with the realisation of the scheme for holding a second great International Exhibition in this country, the necessary powers for conducting which were conferred upon us by the Charter of Incorporation graciously granted to us by her Majesty in the month of February, 1861. " In the years 1858 and 1869 the Society of Arts, a body through whose exertions the Exhibition of 1851 in great measure originated, had taken preliminary measures for the purpose of ascertaining whether a sufficiently strong feeling existed in favour of a decennial repetition of that great experiment to justify on active prosecution of the scheme Although the result was stated by the Society of Arts to be satisfactory, The outbreak of hostilities at that moment on the continent necessarily put a stop to further proceedings. " The restoration of peace in the summer of 1859, however, enabled the consideration of the question to be resumed, although at a period so late as to render it necessary traffic exhibition should be deferred till the present year and the Society of Arts obtained a decisive proof of the existence of a general desire for a second great Exhibition in the most satisfactory form, namely, the signatures of un ii inn 6 animals in various sums of from Â£100 to sign new find an,ou-t,nK the whole to no less than Â£480,000 to a guarantee deed for raising the funds needed for the conduct of the Exhibition " the Commissioners for the Exhibition of 1851, raid ful of the source from which their property and their continued existence as a corporate body arose, and of one of their earliest decisions, that any profits that might be derived from that Exhibition should be applied to purposes strictly in connexion with the ends of the Exhibition or for the establishment of similar Exhibitions for the future without hesitation placed at our disposal, free of all carry' a space of nearly) seventeen acres on their Kensington Gora Estate, which was at first considered sufficient for purposes of the Exhibition, but to which at a subsequent period a further area of up wards of eight acres (being all the land which could be made available for those purposes) was added onoumpplioatioj, when the original space proved to be insufficient For this grant of a site we have to express our thanks * " To the Governments of Foreign States and of her Majesty's Colonies our acknowledgments are justly due for the manner in which, with even greater um unity than 1851, they have responded to the appeal a sale to them to assist in this undertaking In this cordial co-operation we find another proof that the time had arrived when a report tion of the Exhibition of 1851 had become desirable in the common interests of all nations " A similar tribute is due from us to those of her Majesty's subjects who appear as exhibitors, or who have placed at our disposal many valuable works to illustrate the various branches of British art, and in this respect our grateful thanks are especially due to her Majesty. About Â£2,000 exhibitors are here represented, of whom about 8000 are subjects of her Majesty, and 14,000 of foreign States The arrangement and design of the building are such that the exhibited articles have been generally orr urged in three great divisions - 1st Fine arts, in the galleries especially provided for the department " 22d Raw materials, manufactures, and agricultural machinery in the main building and the eastern annexe " 3rd Machinery requiring steam or water power for its effectual display), in the western annexe "Within these divisions the classification adopted is in most respects similar to that employed in 1851, the British and colonial articles being kept separate from IUOBO sent by foreign countries, and each country having its own portion of the several departments allott d to it the dialogues now preceded by us for the purpose of submission to his Most Gracious Majesty will be found to contain all the necessary particulars respecting the articles exhibited. ' In the selection and (arrangement of many of the more important branches of the Exhibition we have been miss nally assisted by the cordial co-operation and advice of persons of all ranks in various local, class, trade, and other committees, whose services we gratefully acknowledge ' 1 allowing the principle adopted in the case of the Exhibition of 1851, we have decided that prize-, in the form of medals, shall be given in all the classes of the Exhibition, except those in the fine arts' section, such medals, however being of one kind only-namely, rewards for mont, without an) distinction of degree those medals will be awarded by juries appointed for the several classes, and composed of British and foreign members " We are happy to be able to acquaint her Majesty that foreign nations have selected persons of highdistmcti in in science and in dustry) to act as jurors, and we have to bear testified) to the cordial readiness with which eminent manufacturers of this country and other persons distin- girl held in the State as well SB in the various branches of science and art, have consented to serve us jurors, and accept the responsibilities and labour entailed upon them by so doing. AV of red assured that the eminence of the jurors, both foreign and British the elected, will satisfy exhibitors that the objects display) ed by them will be examined by competent as well as by impartial judges It is certain that the meeting of so many leading men on such a duty, from all parts of the world must exercise a favourable influence on agriculture, manufactures, and commerce, by dissemina- ting valuable and practical information respecting the condition of science and industry in their several countries, as well as by) making known to all that which they need and that which they can supply " The articles now exhibited will show that the period which has elapsed since 1851, although twice interrupted by European wars, has been marked by a progress previously unexampled in science, art, and manufacture " It is our earnest prayer that the International Exhibition of 1862, now about to be inaugurated, and which it is our m allege to conduct, may form no unworthy link in that chair of International Exhibitions with which must ever be connected the honoured name of her Majesty's illustrious CcnMirt " The Duke of Cambridge read the following reply in a loud and clear voice, which was distinctly audible at a considerable distance - ' We cannot perform the duties which the Queen has done us the honour to commit to us as her Majesty a representatives on this occasion without expressing our heart felt regret that this inaugural ceremony is deprived of her Majesty's presence by the sad bereavement which has overwhelmed the nation with universal sorrow We share most sincerely ) our feelings of deep sympathy with her Majesty in the grievous affliction with which the Almighty has seen fit to visit her Majesty and the whole people of this realm It is impossible to contemplate the spectacle this day presented to our view without being painfully reminded how great a loss we have all sustained in the illustrious Prince with whose name the first Great International Exhibition was so intimately connected, and whose enlarged views and enlightened judgment more conspicuous in his appreciation of the benefits which such undertakings are calculated to confer upon the country who are commanded by the Queen to assure you of the warm march which her Majesty cannot fail to take in this Exhibition, and of her Majesty's earnest wishes that its success may amply) fulfil the intentions and expectations with which it was projected and may richly reward the zeal and energy, aided by the cordial co-operation of distinguished men of various countries, by which it has been carried into execution We heartily join in to pay or that the International Exhibition of 1862, beyond largely conducing to present enjoyment and mental ion, will be hereafter recorded as an important link in the chain of International Exhibitions, b) which the nations of the world may be drawn together in the noblest rivalry), and from which they may mutually derive the greatest advantage" " This concluded the portion of the ceremony which was appointed to take place under the castors dome, and the procession slowly unwound itself, and proceeded in mosaic order as before down the nave 'The brilliant column, as it moved along with the sunlight upon it, but its gaudy lines toned down and relieved by the cooler time of the dresses of the ladies who lined the passage on each side, was a magnificent sight from the galleries, but the vista, looking westward, down the nave from the platform, and terminating in the gaily decked porters of the orchestra, was still finer As the procession moved off the bands of the Foot Guards, stationed on the western platform, played Handel's March in Â¿>cij>to Under the eastern dome, where the vast concourse of distinguished visitors not officially engaged in the ceremony had long been congregated, a dais had been erected hard by the Majolica fountain, where the Queen s Commissioners took their seats on the chairs of state provided for them The special musical performances commenced with the magnificent piece under the name of " Ouieriure en for mc (te Ma) eke The execution of the work was happily all that could have been wished The openmgcoiah, " to play a thousand voices full and sweet "In this wide hall with earth's inventions stored, " And praise the way lsible, army crsal Lord, ' -the appropriate thank offering at this important festival, was sung with remarkable precision and a justness of into- nation that never seemed to waver, the effect of the trumpets, giving out the melody of the curate in unison with the upper voices, was extremely solemn and impressive The next movement, in the minor key " Oh silent father of our Kings to be, " Mourned in this golden hour of jubilee, "For this, for all, we weep our thanks to thee !" made its way to the hearts of all the vast assembly. The overture ofM Auber wound up the "special music with extraordinary spirit Mr Costa (who after the Ode resumed his position at the head of the orchestra) directed the performance After the conclusion of the special music the Bishop of London, with much fervency of manner, read the following prayer - , "Almighty God, unto whom all hearts be open, all desires known, and from whom no secrets are hid Cleanse the thoughts of our hearts by the inspiration of Thy Holy Spirit, that we may perfectly love Thee, and worthily magnify Thy holy name through Christ our Lord Amen " O Lord, save the Queen.

" From Victoria Crown Princess of Prussia, "to the Earl Granville "My best wishes for the success of to day's ceremony, and of the whole undertaking, " PRINCESS ROYAL," The Cantata of Sterndale Bennett is inclined to the side of the Poet Laureate, written expressly for the inauguration of the Exhibition, and should not be here omitted - Uplift a thousand voices full and sweet as this wide hall with earth s inventions stored, And praise the' invisible, army cried Lord, Who lets once more in peace the nations meet, Wicrc Science, Art and Libourhuvc out pour'd Their myriad horns of plenty at our feet.

And as an appropriate closing of the ceremonial part of this despatch, I add the following - SOWLT- MAY, 1862 Sweet, and jet said, those thousand voices rang, Winding and travelling through the long denies Of courts and galleries and far reaching aisles And bright the banners from proud riches sprung, But not the less their droop my, folds among Lurked a dim board of grief for over all Chastening, not marring, our high festival, The shadow of an absent Greatness being Absent, but yet in abeyance present more for all wrote to him and might have owed, For the rich gifts, which, missing, we deplore, than if he were rejoicing at this hour - The with him th it the seed his wisdom sowed Had blossomed in this bright consummate flower R.C T. Let me here briefly odd that, with one single contretemps, the whole affair passed e If well Nearly every London turned out to see or be seen business was suspended wholly or in part, and a general holiday was taken At ten o'clock in the morning of the 30th. April, the great "bell of Mr. Benson's great clock began to tell as a sign is to the exhibitors and their workmen to leave work and the building, and the rest of the day was! devoted by the contractors' and executors' stall to the preparation for the opening ceremonial, to effect which upwards of 2000 persons were employed The building had to be cleared and swept, and barricades erected, the three of ceremony, and many other things not necessary to particularise the last act of which was not completed a smile magnate before the hour for opening the doors arrived the exterior of the building is undoubtedly plain-very plain- as, if the truth must be said-downright ugly-but solid and permanent, and as the Commissioners had not an unlimited command of money at their disposal wherewith to beautify, they could not afford to go to unnecessary expense The interior also disappointed many who con- trasted it with the light but elegant appearance of the Crystal Palace Exhibition of 1851 But the Commissioners have here also the like reason, excuse, and apology to off r na in the matter of thocxteiior-the funds at their disposal were limited, and would not allow both solidity and beauty to be combined. This is, however, to he regretted, inasmuch as that as the present building is a permanent one, it would be well if its natural nakedness of appearance could be attired One insensibly felt the want, however, of the many little features presented in the first Exhibition-the cry stat fjun tain, and (he accompanying bit of nut are, the trees. Here the contrast between the two is very striking, the more so as in the present building the nave was eacum bored with some most ugly " trophies " since removed, and placed in a less conspicuous place The contrast was in this respect so great as to magnify the beauty of the former and make one sigh for woodland scenery - I pine for the woods for the grand old woods With their aisles so cool and dim, "Where the wandering Spirit of the Wind Chants her solemn, reverent by mn The say is bright which bends above These pra lies green and fair, And soft as the breath of a sleeping child is the breath of the scented air. But no green woods look up to the sky in strength and grandeur and pride, Breaking the drear monotony of the prairies, stretching wide The summer sun shines clear and bright, But the brilliant golden beams Steal not through the twining branches' screen, In softly waving gleams And there are birds on the billowy plains, But far too sweet in their song Than when it chimes with the woodland hymn, Sweeping in power along 2 The summer winds, as they wander o'er The treeless solitudes, Wake not such an anthem of harmony As rolls through the sounding woods. Then give me the woods-the grand old woods, "W iib their aisles so cool and dim, "Where the wandering Br m of the Wind Chants her solemn, reverent h j mu Exh.bmoÂ«e"1f'iRroWtVerVrau8l; be add 10 tax of (ho exhibition of 1862 over that of 1851, and that so that all t.Â¿T^JÃ®^f0tBklÃ®l.Tl,ll greater here than ever to respond' same "D ÃntÂ«-Di"""-1 " Exhibition.

"Old industries have been stimulated and improved. Now industries have arisen. " In fine art, painting, and sculpture, it is hardly possible, except in very extraordinary periods, that a marked change can be observed in a single ten years, but this country certainly holds its own as compared with the productions of other countries " in the manufacture of iron, improvements have also been made , new bands of ore have been discovered, and day by day we are economising its production, and a metal between iron and steel is now produce i at And process, which heretofore required two or more processes, alike expensive and difficult " In steam power, especially that applies to railroads and to ocean BY cam navigation, economical appliances have advanced rapidly of the use of coal for locomotives in place of coke, and superheating steam and surface condensing in ocean steamers, tend to increase the power and economise the cost of these powerful engines of civilisation " In shipbuilding the past ten years have produced great changes "Our navy and mercantile marine have alike advanced in scientific construction and in mechanical arrangements. The ocean steamers which were then employed in the postal service, included but one of two thousand tons, now there are many of nearly double that tonnage, with corresponding power and speed, increasing the facility and decreasing the Ã® '?k of communication with our colonies and foreign countries " In printing great advances have been made By the perfection of chromatic printing views of distant countries have been brought within reach of almost every clasS, dis- placing works which neither improved the taste nor g wo useful information, and by the application of most expensive and most beautiful machinery to the printing of our daily journals, we have been enabled profitably to meet the increased demand caused by the cheapness of our newspapers Invention and mechanical contrivance have thus kept pace with the requirements of intellect and the daily increasing love of knowledge " Another thing to be on this occasion specially noticed is the fact that, whereas in 1851 the British colonies were comparatively unrepresented, they have on this occasion obtained a space of 12 822 feet, of which the Australian colonies obtain 3500 square feet, and the collection of raw produce exhibited is most rich, interesting, instructive, and suggestive But of the particulars of these productions I must defer a description until the next mail, when I shall specially devote some space to the subject, and, if necessary, continue the subject as its importance I may consider do Eorves.
