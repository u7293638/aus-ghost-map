The Advertiser THURSDAY, DECEMBER 27, 1883. FROM the returns which have come to hand it is clear that the harvest will not only greatly exceed that of last year, but will be considerably in excess of the average for many past seasons. With the exception of the hill districts east of Adelaide reaping operations are now in full awing throughout the colony, and re ports speak very favorably both of the quality and quantity of the grain which is being gathered in. In those portions of the province where the stripper is not yet at work, the waving cornfields are giving abundant promice of very satisfactory returns. It is cause for regret that some of our northern farmers have suffered considerably in the loss of their crops during the recent meteorological dis turbances. In a few cases the storms of wind, tain, and hail which have swept over the growing crops have been moat ruinous, and their owners find them selves suddenly deprived of the expected results of their labor and outlay during the year. In their misfortune they will have the sincere sympathy of all sections of the community, but these calamities are fortunately not wide-spread in any dis trict Ihe hay crop throughout the colony ' has been exceptionally good, and as grass though dry is still plentiful, the prices of hone and cattlfi feed will be considerably below those of the last few- months. The ingathering of a good harvest will be fol lowed by a revival of all branches of trade, and fanners, storekeepers, merchants, and others will Dharo in the general prosperity. In the adjoining colonies of Victoria and New South Wales harvest returns are very gratifying, and the commercial out* look has improved correspondingly. Complete returns have lately come to hand of the harvest which has just been reaped tiiroughout the United Kingdom, and the estimates given l>y us a few weeks ago of the probable yield were, in the main, correct. The yield was a fair aveng?dwae. This is much better than what was expected by many com petent authorities before reaping com menced. The earliest estimate was one formed at j&e; beginning of August by M. Estienno, of Marseilles, a Frenchman who had taken gnat pains to arrive at a sound conclusion. That gentleman placed the wheat yield of England and Wales at 91f percent, of a standard average. About the middle of the same month the Farm--, computed it at 93£ per cent This was, therefore, a rather jnore favorable esti mate than that of M. Estienne; but a week later ihe Mark-Lane Express estimated the crop to be only "89£ per cent, of a normal average." At the end of nonth ?ppearancea were Btill less favorable, ami tUfl Ani-loiUnml GjvlU gave expression to the opinion that the harvest would turn out to be only about 85 per cent, of the standard average. Subsequently when harvest commenced and reports came to hand, a strong opinion was declared in many quarters that the wheat crop would prove U> be "deficient in yield per acre as well a? short in acreage." Later still, however, when reaping operations were over, Sir J. B. Lawes, one of the highest authorities in the United Kingdom, give it as bis opinion that the cru^> wjuld "amount to a full average, if not more." ?Sir J. B. Lawes is a practical and enthu siastic farmer, and interests himself in whatever may be of interest to the farming community in the old country. He owns an extensive farm in the county of Hert fordshire, which has been continuously cultivated for thirty-two years. Here farming is carried on in tbe most scientific and approved fashion, and the results of the use of various manures liave been ascertained with the utmost precision, "presenting," it is said, "an experi mental repetition without parallel in any country of the world." The estimates Ml. Lawes formed of the probable wheat yield of England were based upon a lengthened series of experimental tests and elaborate calculations. It is gene rally conceded, however, that he was a little too sanguine about the late harvest, which was only of an average character. During the year the amount of land de voted to wheat-growicg in the United Kingdom was 2,715,000 acres ; the re turns averaged 26 bushels to the acre, and it is estimated that, after deducting seed, there are available for home con sumption about 8,124,000 quarters. For the past eighteen years the average acreage has been 3,472,000 acres, with a return of 201 bushels to the acre, leaving for home consumption about 10,730,000 quarters. It is worthy cf remark that for the first half of the eighteen years the average return was 28 bushels to the acre, while for the latter half of that period the average was not more than '21$ bushels. This would appear to favor the idea that good and bad seasons come in cycles in the home country as they seem to do here. During this year there has been much lessattention given to wheat-growing iv the United Kingdom than in former seasons. The average breadth under wheat in the nice years ended in 1874 was 3,7&8,000 acres. This year, therefore, shows a fall ing off of more than a million acres. .While home production has diminished, wheat importation into England has of course largely increased. It was neces saiy that this should be so, not only to make up for the lessened cultivated acre age there, but also to meet the ever-grow ing reauirements of a rapidly-increasing population. The imports of wheat and flour, deducting exports, for the year ending in August, 1873, amounted to 11,720,000 quarters, which with the home production made a total of 21,830,000 quarters available for consumption. Ten years later, that is for the year ending in August last, after deduct ing exports, there were imported into the United Kingdom not less than 19,953,000 quarters of wheat and flour. In round numbers close upon twenty millions of quarters of breadstufls were imported into the home market for British consumption during the period just mentioned. It is reported that at the present time the stocks in the hands of English merchants are very large, and that the London granaries are now holding about double the quantity of grain which they had at this time last year. This being the case it is more than probable that the imports for the current 3 ear will not rqual those of last season, and that, in fact, the most that will be required will be about 16,750,000 quarters. Even this estimate is regarded as being rather high ; and taking into account that there ia such a huge surplus on hand, some competent authorities state that the importation of about sixteen million quarters of wheat and flour, with the home produce, will be amply sufficient for all require ments. This is assuming that the con sumption of wheat in Great Britain is about cix bushels per head of the popu lation. There are, however, other markets into which our grain will find its way. Already we have thousands of tons of grain ready for export; and the quality of the wheat reaped in South Australia is such as to command the nicest prices in any market to which it may be sent. The only cause for anxiety is the supposed in sufficiency of our railway arrangements to meet the demands of the farmers during the present rush, when it is of the highest consequence that they should get their stores of grain without delay to the sea board. The edifice of German unity was crowned on September 28 with every demonstra tion of national rejoicing. The figurative completion of the work chiefly ascribed to Prince Bismarck is a memorable event in the history of the Fatherland. The Imperial Chancellor, it is true, has dis claimed the honor assigned him as the creator of German unity, which he transfers to the army, though the peop'e at large may rightfully claim for themselves ? abate in the establishment of the consoli dated Empire, the solidarity of which is no longer matter for disputation. The ideal longing after unity which filled the German people for forty years and mani fested itself in word and writing, in poetry and real life, was gloriously realised thiiteen years ago. Germany had been rescued from disintegration on the part of Austria, and the Rhine from absorp tion by France. The longed-for unity was conquered inch by inch not from the foreigner alone, bat from, as well as for the German people. Prince Bismarck's proudest achievement was the deliverance of his country from discord and humilia tion ; nia firm conviction is that as lie proved himself wiser tlian Parliament and politicians in the past, so may he in the pre sent and the future. He led the Prussian people by his personal force of character to the brink of war. From civil strife he plucked in defiance of themselves the exact elements to cement into a firm basis of German nationality. The nation was plunged into a terrible conflict with an aggressive neighbor, but emerged stronger and greater tlian ever. To Prince Bis marck has been ungrudgingly accorded the credit of moulding the weapon which compassed the results, in the face of protests from the people that were to profit by it, yet he has been reminded that the error he has since committed is in supposing that the nation he has taught its powers is never to be permitted to use them for itself. Bnt peoples are not emancipated simply by armies or by statesmen. The German people is as suredly entitled to participate in the honor of its restoration to national life, as it would bare bad to pay the full penalty of failure. The grand celebration in the Niederwald suggests that the fullness Of tbe time has come for the wider recogni tion of the rights and privileges of a homogeneous people worthy to be con sulted on its national development. Above a'l and every one, however, stands tbe revered Kaiser Wilhelm. To him is offered at all times a homage as spontaneous us it is profound. Hale and hcaxiy as ever, notwithstanding his age, which does not wither his wondrous vitality, the Kruperor was the chief actor in a scene which can never be forgotten in Germany. The ac clamations of a patriotic multitude numbering fifty thousaud greeted tin majestic lord of loyal millions of devo'ed : übjecte, German crowned heads or their representatives, governors of fortress a^ members of Parliament, deputations frnm every army corps in the empire, from choral, gymnastic, and other societies, from every rank, condition, kingd m, principality, and dukedom, assembled to take part in the solemnity and festivity o a truly national commemoration. To the accompaniment of flashing blades and roaring artillery the statue of triumphant Germania was unveiled. Feasting, sing ing, and other jubilation followed the devout song of praise to the Lord tf Hosts that swelled on high in spirit stirring strains from thankful hearts and ringing voices. There was no dis cordant note in this hymn of ti.tini.?l gratitude. Political differences which divide state from slate in minor concerns of government, and split up Jarliaments into parties, were (indiscernible in the harmonious congre gations of Germans of all creeds aa I classes. The presence of men li'ie Ilerr Windthorst and Herr yon Ben nigsen attested Uie common love of the Fatherland which animates even those who cannot be entirely reconciled to the policy that is pursued in certain affairs, and evinced a patriotism wliich no direr gent political elements can eradicate or even obscure. The towering figure of the puissant Chancellor was nowhere visible, bis absence being due to indisposition]; but conspicuous by the side of the Emperor stord Marshal Moltke, sharing with bis august master the cheers that came in thundering volleys from the vast assem blage, and which were echoed by the castled crags and vine-clad bills which overlook the stately river beloved of Geimans. The surroundings are in keeping with the magnificent memorial that will, for ages/reflect the"spirit, valor, and unity of a great people, and are in unison with the traditions of a race whose fame goes back to the twilight of fable. The spot itself is romantic as well as classic ground, where cluster associations that are vividly and vigorously depicted in "DieWacht am Rhein." The splendid transformation it witnessed on the occasion seems almost to recall the enchantmanta of faery. " The Rhine here enters those high and castle-crowned crags which form the most picturesque part of its coarse; and as darkness fell," we are graphically told, "the bleak bill-tops, the rugged peaks, the jutting promontories, and the terraced vineyard slopes begin to flicker and flare with innumerable bonfires and Bengal lights of rainbow hue, and fUming cressets flung their land glow on the emerald wavelets of the Rhine. AHove all rose the deep-toned chorus of tha solemn royaterers who, inspired by love of fatherland and by the juice of the grape, trumpeted forth, frjm every over crowded hostelry and inn garden the stirring and hymn-like strains of "Die Wacht am Rhine."' The monument itself is a striking work, of immense size, and is thus described:— " Gennania, a colossal female figure, stands aloft on a huge pedestal, holding in one hand a laurel-bound sword, and in the other the imperial crown. Emble matic figures of peace and war, of the Bhine and the Moselle, adorn the pedestal; and around it are plaq uea in relief, where the emperor and all his generals, and where the departing and returning of the troops are figured almoafc in life size." Some of these heroes stool around the monument, highest and fore most the octogenarian monarch himself. In unveiling the symbolic representation of German prowess and military supre macy the Emperor declared that the monument would remind them of the year 1870, when Germany arose as one man against the threatening peri], and that since then united Germany has taken its place in the history of the world. His Majesty might well dedicate tbe sculptured memento of imperishable achievements to "the memory of the fallen, in gratitude to the living, and to future generations for emulation." The massive structure has been raised in no spirit, of defiance, yet it should serve as ft beacon to the more restless and vindictive among the French who refuse to abide by the decision of the struggle that deprived France of ElsassLiothringen, for "the Statue does signify that Germany neither trusts France nor fears her." A strong and inexpugnable Germany is acceptable to England, Long before Germany be came a. united and powerful nationality it was the settled policy of English statesmen to desire and promote her unity as a safe guard and bulwark against the aggressive spirit *of her neighbors on either side. Not only had Englishmen an hereditary sympathy "with liberal and national aspi rations, but they saw that Germany in her full strength would be a guarantee for the peace and tranquillity of Europe. France on the one side had repeatedly shown how easily her aggressive spirit could be roused by adventurous rulers; Russia on the other was remarkable not so much for periodic impulses of aggres sion as for a fixed an* settled policy of advance. History repeats itself. To-day something aldn to this disquieting con cern affects European nations, and it is fortunately reassuring to know that Ger many with no further ambition to serve is united, compact, and fearless, as becomes the greatest military power of the age.

Tbe intercolonial cricket match between Kew Sooth Wales and Victoria was com* menoad in Melbourne on Wednesday. The Kew South Wales captain won the toss, and ! elected to bat. When stumps were drairn there wen only four ot the Kew South Welsh men out for a total of 278 runs, of which Murdoch made the magnificent score of 153. Jones played splendidly for 52. The match will be continued to-day. The Governor Musjiare with the members Of the Marine Board started on Wednesday afternoon on the usual visit of inspection to the outports aad lighthouses. The Treasurer and the m????- of Education accompanied the party. The weather had entirely changed from its previous bcis^erous character, and there was every prO'pect ot a pleasant trip. His Excellency the Governor held a Conn* cil on Wednesday, at which three Ministers were present. A working man named John McAllister had his ley; broken at Largs Biy on Boxing Day by a fall while fighting. No dangerous results ace anticipated.

Part 111. of the "Forest Flora of South Australia" is published. It is in every way quite equal to the numbers which have pre. ceded it. The illustrations in this part deal with the broad-leaved wattle, augar gum, scrub sbeaoak, aad tbe head-flowered stringy bark. The leaves, with sections of the wood, ?ecd>, and fruit of each tree are exquisitely lithographed, and the ictterpress explaining csch plate is interesting and instructive.

Fortunately, although bruised about the arms and body, she waa not seriously injured, and proceeded by the same train to the Bay, but feeling too unwell to remain there returned home by the next train. Great credit ia due to Porter Bicbards for his promptitude, which undoubtedly was the means of saving the woman's life, The Btndigo Ad&rtiter; reports that at a recent meeting of the Sandhurst Science Society Mr. B. Brough Smyth read a paper onMr. Elkry'amapof the rainfall of 1882 in Victoria, aad a portion of New South Wales and South Australia. In answer to an en quiry whether steps could be *?*im to have a similar map embracing larger portions of Hew South Wales and South Australia, Mr. Smyth repUed that Mr. EHery waa specially qualified for the performance of such work, aad that tte Government should be requested to negotiate with the New South Wales and Sooth Australian Governments, with the object of having a rainfall map of those colo nies compiled in conjunction wit* that of Victoria. It was resolved that tha president and secretary communicate with kindred ?oci>rif, and agricultural and horticultural sodetk?, drawing attention to the importance of the map, and requesting them to strengthen Mr. £lkry'shands,andassisthiminbringlog cut the map annually, and also in extending the field of his operations. We have received from Mr. A. E, Sawtell, of Port Adelaide, a copy of "Sawtell's Nau tical Almanac, Coasting Directory, &&, for 1884." Like all its predecesaon it contains a large amount of general information relating to thippirrg matters, aa well aa new and spe cial features introduced to keep pace with tbe advancing times. Besides very comprehen sive tailing directions for the coast there are included full particulars of all the Marine Board regulations, Customs tariff and rules, tables of wages, railways, signals,tides, dues, and maDs; copious information as to Port Adelaide, its river, and its institutions, and all .the miscellaneous items so useful to mariners and strangers generally. Amongst the innovations is a "practical compass cor rector," baring for its object the avoidance of lengthy calculations to correct compass errors. It is one of Mr. SawteU'e own ideas, ana-will probably be found of much use to shipmasters. Charts of the Port River and of the lower parts of the two gulfs, with Kangaroo Island, accompany H** alamanac, which is through out very well got up, and should prove of great service to those interested in shipping matter*. We bare received from tha Victorian mining department a copy of the gold mining statistics of that colony for the quarter ended September 30. These reborns show that the total number of persona engaged in gold ?wSptn|f ip the Tt?lpny {?p*^"^*ng Chinese) during the quarter was 33,933. The esti mated value of tiie mining plant employed on the various goldfields waa £1,885,543; the area worked upon covered 1,417£ square allies, and the estimated value of the gold raised waa 193,026 ounces. The district which produced the greatest quantity of gold daring the three months is Sandhurst, which yielded 58.253 ounces; the number of men employed being 6.650. The next highest yield was that of Ballarat, which, with 7,249 men em ployed, raised 63.508 ounces. Neither of the other districts returned as much at 22,000 ounces. The average yield of gold per ton of quartz crushed (so far aa ascertained) throughout the several divisions was9dwta. 11C3 grains. From quartz tailings and mullock treated the yield was 2 data, OSS grains, and the pyrites and blanketings ope rated upon returned, loz. 18 dwts. 19^45 grains per ton. Last year owing to the liberality of the patents aad friends of the children attending the HaOsworth State school, Mr. Peate, tbe head teacher, was enabled to give a very suc cessful picnic to the pupils in the grounds of Mr. J.

Torough tha same liberality **"* children tl*^ a picnic on Friday, December 21, in the aaame paddock* which afforded thorough enjoyment to all the youngsters, aa well as to the friends present. A start was made at 11 a.nu, when over 200 children left the sahool, and marched in capital order to the paddock, where a large tent had been erected, and a good supply of swings provided. Various games, sash as <I' liged?>i till tea was announced, when the children seated tbcwselvea on tbe ground, ia their various danes, and were bountifully supplied with good things.

Concerning Mr. Wilfrid Powell's proposed scientific expedition to New Guinea, under tbe auspices of the Geographical Society, the Sydney Morning BrmU observes:— ** Mr. Powell may possess qualifications (or leading it of which we know nothing, bat a perusal of the little work which he published, in which was contained the pi'.h of the in formation he laid before the learned society under notice, does not lead us to tbe in ference that be is exactly the m?n to select for such an important duty. Mr. Powell served for a limited period in Her Majesty.* navy in the capacity of a junior officer, and possessing the spirit of adventure he |re aigned bis commission, and ? far as his personal narrative leads us to infer, went into the pearl fishery trade. In cruising off the coast of New Guinea he made a rough survey of several small bays and anchorages. H* also passed some time in Ke* Britain and New Ireland. In tbe pages of bis work we do cot either any information as to Mr. Powell's knowledge of tbe interior of New Guinea. In fact he says little or nothing about it. The details, meagre as they are respecting the inhabitants of the other islands, are on some points calculated more to sur prise than instruct, and aa far as can be learned from bis writings bis powers ot observation, bis skill as an explorer, and his capacity to lead an expedition of this kind, have not been at all clearly set forth." The Christmas holidays (writes our corres pondent) passed off very quietly at Gawler. On Christmas Eve there was the usual decora tion of the streets, and a Urge on wd perambu lated to and fro making their purchases for the morrow's festivities. One of the features which attracted a good deal of attention was Bone>'a monster Christmas c ike, tbe catting up of which created some amusement—the purchasers carefully searching for the con cealed treasures, a ring or sundry pieces of coin. Beautiful weather set in on Obristmai morning, and numbers were induced to leave borne; consequently the day was rather dull in town. Many residents] took their departure—some north and some sooth—for their holiday, some straying as Car as the Adelaide **?n*i on pi*wM?fg intent. There were, however, a good many arrivals which, perhaps, equalised matters. The day was spent as a dose holiday in tbe town. A quiet game at cricket was played on the Exhibition Grounds by our local cricketer*. At Ouetree Hfllabazaar and tea meeting were held, which were largely attended, many frcm Gtwler preferring to go the distance, twelve miles, rather than remain at home. A c snsiderable number in traps and on horseback enjoyed tike ride—one party of riders alone consisting of a dozen ladies and gentlemen. The biz ?ar was a success financially. On Boxing Day the town was very quiet, scarcely a soul being visible in tbe streets during the day. The weather was all that could be desired. A pleasant gathering took place at the Prince Alfred Hotel on W?doe*day eveaing, when the employes of Mi sari MsColloeb and Co. presented Mr. George Ferguson, (or Mine jcais manager of the firm's branch business in boutn Australia, with a handsomely iiinmi. nated address on the occasion of his retire aunt from the firm's employ. After a light repast bad been partaken of, the chairman (Mr. W. Foster) called on Mr. GoodaQ (manager of tbe Port busmen) to iwa^r^ the presentation. Tw doing so Mr. Goodall referred to the kindly feeling which existed between the macager and his fellow employe*. So general was this feeling, that on hearing of his intended retirement the whole ot the branches throughout the colony had readily subscribed to the testimonial. In responding Mr. Ferguson said, in con nection with the firm with which he bad been associated (or ao many yean, he was particularly pleased to know that the panels express which had been intndaeed Into the colony at his suggestion had been a success. Atfirsttheyhadbadagooddealto contend against^ and in of the booses of the city aad subarbs not being numbered they had experienced considerable difficulty in delivering parcels quickly. But these difficulties bad at length been overcome, and the panels express had proved a decided success. He thanked them for the address. Mr. Ferguson's health was then drunk with mnsical honors. In re* spending to the toast of bis health, Mr. Brown, the manager elect, referred to his experience in tbe employ of Messrs. McCulloch ft Co. in Kew South Wales, and expressed the hope that all the men would pull together in the interests of the firm. If this were done he was confident the parcels express woLld prove a greater success in the future than it bad teen in tbe past, in spite of the opposition that was shortly to be Ini'itttd. Several other toasts were honored, and tbe proceed ings, which wen enlivened with song< ani recitations, were brought to a close atan early hour. There was only a small attendance at the Gnrler races on Wedoudty, when Cracks man won tte Hurdles, Sandal the December Handicap, All Scaoke tre Selling Race, Dutchman the Christmas Handicap, Tancred the Steeple, and Dutchman tbe Barossa Stakes. A cricket match took place on the Adelaide Oval on Wednesday between an eleven from the North Adelaide Club and fifteen playera repiesenting tte BorthernAreas Association. The North Adelaides went to the wickets first, and scored 243, KnQl making 116, Fin lajson S3, and Handle 32. Their opponents were all dismissed for 97, Bebbeck contri buting 19, Berry 14, Bnckenara 13, and Crump 10.

A soiree' was given on Friday, December SI, by the pupils attending Mrs. Culliford's school at Goodwood. The entertainment was held in St. Ceorge's schoolroom, Goodwood- road, tbe building being crowded. Mr. C. H. Matters occupied tbe chair, and stated that altfaougb Mrs. Culliford had opened the school only eighteen months ago the number on the roll had risen to 110. "This he con- sidered highly satisfactory for a private school, and indicated the excellence of the education imparted. A lengthy progMtmne, comprising songs, duets, pianoforte music, diakguea, and recitations, was then aatiafac tori)/ carried out, many of the performers acquitting themselves remarkably well. Several of tbe pianoforte pieces were oontri* buted by juveniles, who gave evidence ot un doubted ability, and whose skill also testified to the careful training of their teaoTaera. A distribution of prises brought the proceed ings to a dote. 3be aa&oal; neetia* of th?
