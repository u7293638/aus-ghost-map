JOHN O'BRAGGER. A TALE. (Concluded.) BY THE GHOST OF BURNS. By this time he had let them ken Which way he meant the gear to spen'— How Chinese right wad be decided, How squatters lan's wad be divided; How Dr. Milton he would summon To legislate about the women. How—tho' 'twas at his frien's expense J. P.s' should a' be men o' sense. That ministers were upright men An' neither favor'd fae or frien'. Here Adamson jumped on the floor And soon the House was in a splore; Ilk members notes were thrown his hat in, Some fell to laughin'—some to chattin.' John roar'd "our plan, in brief, Sir this is," And loud resounded groans and hisses. * * * * As John glowr'd round wi' risin' wrath, The fun mair unrestrain'd brak' forth— Each member's tongue the faster flew Their laughter loud an' louder grew; They stood—they sat—they wink'd— they jeer'd-- Till Aspinall at last appear'd To gie it up—threw down his queel An' join the fun in right guid will. Now John had they your equal been Turf-cutters frae the Isle ca'd green, Shillelah-wieldin', frisky boys In well worn frieze and corduroy's. This pen o' mine—my virgin queel, In which an unco pride I feel, I would fling frae me wi' delight To see you wi' your comrades fight; But weel-learn'd—weel-dress'd—weel-bred men Treatin' your speech wi' sic disdain— In sic contemptuous fun engagin' I wonder did nae put ye ragin'. But John kenn'd what was what fu' weel, There was a sly sarcastic chiel That night enlisted in the sport, (Weel known in ev'ra legal court; For many a with'rin' speech he made An' puzzl'd many a judge's head, An' gat baith muckle fame an' gear An kept a' blethrin' fools in fear), His ready wit and satire keen Which while a laddie had been seen, In legal talk tho' fair an' lawfu', When flung at John were really awfu'. Your dad nae dreamt when he did march ye First aff to school, his braw wee Archy, That a' the Greek and Latin knowledge Ye'd get there an' at some gran' college, Or in some lawyers office learn Wad e'er harangue an Irish kern. But here my muse maun rest hersel'— Its far ayont her power to tell, How Archey a' his satire lows'd, (A ve'ra de'il he is when rous'd.) How John's black brow wi' anger lour'd As at him his tormentor glowr'd— Not like as he were in a passion, Nae, nae, that ne'er was Archey's fashion But wi' a face as lang's my arm Just same's he meant no mortal harm; Till first ae sarcasm—then anither John lost his temper a' thegither, Growl'd out "Och, murther, tare-an-ages:" An' waur an' waur the frolic rages: And scarcely had he said the word When maist a dizzen tongues were heard, As bousing lads wha're what's ca'd mellow Talk o' some braw, guid jolly fellow; As mobs o' scan'lers clack or pray O' sinfu' folk wha gang astray; As women's tongues o'er tea an' toast Cry shame on her wha's virtue's lost, Sae members talk an' hiss an' cheer him, While Dick laughs out—"Tarnation! hear him:" Ah, John, ah, John, what were ye doin', This night there's unco mischief brewin'; In vain your crony tries to speak They'll hear nae sic unearthly squeak. Now do thy utmost blust'rin' Jack An' get ye'er while syne courage back. But ere John knew weel what to say He cow'd afore his learned fae; For Archey gloryin' in the fun Let lowse at John his venom'd tongue, Sent ev'ra scathing hame Till John forgot baith place an' fame, O'Bragger saw his ain disgrace, An' mutterin' vengeance left the place. Now wha this tale o' truth may read Each upstart minister tak heed, When e'er ye think yoursel's ower grat Or try to bounce thro' a debate, Think ye may dear pay for ye'er whis'lin Remember Archey Michie's list'nin'.
