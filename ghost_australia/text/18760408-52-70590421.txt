TUE BEECHER. SCANDAL. i'heSau francisco Examiner says :-'. iNotluug could bo more wide of the mark than the idea en- tertained in some quarters tba* thc .Plymouth Church scandal is to lie permitted to lie dormant and suffered to die from old ago. As far as the public is concerned, of course, if tho whole hideous thing could be buried in oblivion it were well ; ¡iud Bencher's partisans might' pursue their efforts to cover up thc skeleton and exorcise thu ghost undisturbed. But, unfortunately, die side-issues . of the case have served to keep the body-the essential feature v«y much alive and kicking. Only a small per- centage of the Congregational Churches responded to thc call for an Advisory Council" on thc ques- tion of Mrs. Moulton'* status in Plymouth, evi- dencing that tho movement was generally regarded as of no significance, and merely intended to in ten-ufy the fog in which Plymouth Chtu'eh has «ought to euvel-'pa its affair:.-. Whatever the insult of* the council, it will l¿ meaningless io "ia public. But a mcvemaut, cf which Dr¿. -»uddingrpu aud ¿torrs ave ¿aid io he f-t the bottom, already a.Iout, to ro-iuvei-. t'gato the whole case, as *boLw*ei Beechar and ute Til ton family by a general conclave ol' the Con- fesional Churches, and the anxiety of Plymouth m escape going to the foundation of the matter ^ul avail aothincr. Tiio CaiircL having declined Bowen's offer to submit bis testimony to a Com- mittee of prominent Congregationalists, in order to avoid publicity, Ahe will, no doubt, be prepared j te go beiore the Ecclesiastical Council and tell all he knows; when, it is predicted, the case will have a very different conclusion from that of the trial in court-and, indeed, any conclusion which shall feouro the public against, further annoyance con . corning the ¿caudal must he devoutly wished for.
