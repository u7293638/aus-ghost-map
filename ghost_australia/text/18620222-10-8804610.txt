SERIOUS CULTURE. TO THE EDITOR OF THE MERCURY. SIE, Tasmania is being shaken to its centre by the great controversy now raging between those literary lions, the erudite W. Carr Boyd," and the great '* N," (supposed to be-the ghost of Napoleon Bonyparty.) Every mind is absorbed by the mighty arguments of these two critical galahs. The American war; the All-England Eleven, and the great Cricket Match, even the new Tariff- all sink into insignificance in the growing excitement to learn what we are to say when we feed our silkworms, and how we are to avoid the dreadful suspicion of being advocates of the " propagation of Chinamen." The English mail is disregarded-no letters are asked for but the wonderful letters of " N and W. Carr Boyd." The Tasmanian public have been so buffeted with long words and hard names ; the batteries opened upon them have had so stunning an effect that they are in a great danger of not recovering the use of their son SOB in time to comprehend the collective wisdom in June next, and really if in addition to HeBychius, Smith, Stephens, Dunbar, and Donaldson, we are to be exposed to a broadside from "Scheller's huge and wonderful Lexicon politics Latinitatis," with which we are threatened, what is to become of us The fact is that the popular excitement and terror have reached that point at which it is necessary that some patriot should throw himself into the yawning gulf. I therefore volunteer to step in between these two dread giants, and propose a mode of accommodation ; let each give way a little, and let them agree to permit us for the future, instead of Sericulture Series culture, or Bombyci- culture (which last word has already given some employment to the Dentists), to use a mild word composed of both, are] simply to say, when we wish shortly to express our care of ojlkrworms ยก-SEEIO-COMICO-BOMBASTI CICULTURB. Your humble servant, MYLIUS STOVOLD the Younger.
