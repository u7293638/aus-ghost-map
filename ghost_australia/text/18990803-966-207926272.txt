'There's something unearthly in it that gives me quite a chill." \- "It is rather eerie, as you say," returned Gerald, and without any very distinct relev- . ancy there-rushed into bis mind the remembrance of-fais presentiment of the previous day; which the ^excitement of the ball had. foi the time driven from his memory. Tri- ^al -as the ^ing seemed, Gerald felt an- Hoy«dVby. tbe recollertwe, and he walked oK in^a moody silence till they were'about to Jjurn.vthe conier of the-narrow Rue d'- Aknav jnct-at this momeot a carriage drove dowa "the 'Street," and as..it slackened speed in ordeE_.to .turn thie corner into the Rue do; Faoboorg 'St. Honore, Gerald saw its rnnsateB distinetly for a moment. One was r, i»toBt;" ipiddle-aced woman, rouged " " witiian-amotoit f skill which caused her to appear at the irst glance as though still in her first youth. he had evidently been a lovely woman ome ten or fifteen years earlier, and still etained - sufficient .beauty to. have, turned . be brains of men who bad ssrsn less of tbe orld than the tiro-who now looked upon er. She was in an evening dress of some ostly silk in two shades of blue, and diaomli which' must have cost a fortune if hey were' real, glittered in her dark hair, nd on : her fair, exquisitely modelled arms. he chanced to lean forward as the carriage t pproached the two gentlemen, who were bliged to wait nntil it passed before crossng, and as she leant she caujrht sight of Gerald, glanced sharply at hun and his uncle for- a.moment, then. as.the carriage rove rapidly along the Rue du Faubourg St. Honore towards the heart of the city, he threw, herself back, with a laughing exlamation to her companion, a sinister- looking elderly man. "By. Jove," exclaimed the elder. North, enthusiastically, "that woman has'been a beauty in her day." "Her dav must have ended some time ago then, ~ unfortunately," responded Gerald, and he spoke no further till they had entered tile bouse. "Why, dear me, Gerald, how ghastly you look—as if you'd seen a ghost, upon my word." exclaimed. Mr.. North, as he . turned up his lamp, and gazed with intense astonishment at bis nephew's face. His surprise was not unreasonable. Gelid. looked perfectly "livid, his face was set and haggard, and it'is no exaggeration to fay that he looked ten years older tihan he "had done at the ball' but bal£. an hour earlier. : "I'm done up, that's all," replied Ge- •rild, in low, bem^e tomes. '"The long,' hurried journey,, and then ali the fatigue and excitement of the ball, have been too much forme."' "Why, Gerald, I should never have guessed you, were so delicate. _ I alwavs monght you had an iron constitution. Ah, Wf31,";l3ie";inen..of •toniay are not .tk. strong as those of my generation, though that was not so loi2jg ;ifro," sasd' the ofd - genUcfflan, drawing himself tip ..to tis full height of 4 ft. ll in., and tlurwing a satisfied glance the .neareet mirror. "Hot won't von have some supper before you go to bai?' ' "So, tiiajik you, uncle. 1'wet just recollected'some pressing business which I quite forgtrt;, and I must set off at once." 'o .transact some business at 5 o'clock in tie moming! -Why,-boy, you're mad or dreaming." "Neither, Sir. I ought to have called on ah old friend.'bat I forgot if till now. shall be sure to find him at home, and .it will be almost breakfast time before I reach him, as -he lives. a Jong tray from • here," and he quitted the room to die intense astonishment of-.his uncle, who would have neglected any .business, on earth .rather than roies a night's rest, and eonld never be induced to remain up laite for any other pur- >ose-than that of.dancing. Gerald quickly eft the house, and set off rapidly towards tbe heart of t'he city. ; As he .went he ^aid to himself, "The presentment is indeed fulfiBed.? . . i, , (To be continued to-momnr.)
