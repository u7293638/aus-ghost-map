SPORTING INTELLIGENCE. THE VICTORIAn cLUB MEETING. The race meeting of the Victorian Club, which takes place at Flemington to- day, promises to be one of the most interesting of the person, and should the weather prove fine the V.R. G racecourse will be well worth a visit. The card contains six events, the first of which is the Hurdle Race, for which the powerful Ballarat stable of Mr. Thomas Wilson has furnished the favourite in Game, and if he be ridden by Corrigan probably he will win. The Two-year-old Stakes will be contested by a good field, and Statesman, Tichborne, and Signor form a rather power ful three. For the Victorian Club Cup the field will be strong both in quantity and quality, and if Coriolanus, Odd Trick, and Baron Von Mueller be at their best, one of the three should furnish the winner. The Steeplechasers regarded as a good thing for the Ballarat representative Kanaka, but another from the same district may prove a dangerous foe, and that is Clansman. The Selling Race looks like a match between The Ghost and Soothsayer ; but the Bookmakers' Purse should be the most open race of the day, and as it is over a distance which most horses are partial to, the finish is likely the very exciting. Ericthoneus, BdBBanio, and Wizard are most in favour with the public. The first race starts at 1 o'clock, and the railway arrangements will be the same as usual. His Excellency the Governor and suite will be present, and the Australian Military Band, under the direction of Signor Zelman, will be stationed on the lawn, and will perform at intervals during the afternoon. For the information of visitors, telegrams will be received from the Melbourne cricket-ground, giving the state of the game between the Englishmen and the Australian Eleven, and posted in a conspicuous position in the paddock.
