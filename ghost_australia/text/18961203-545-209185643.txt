SooiVafterwhrds mutilated corpses of unfortunate slaves commenced to draft down the rivers with every fresh et, and inland traders, arriving at the scattered coast' factories, told strange taJes of men buried alive among the foundations of new houses or stockades. At last it was determined that Shaillu should be made an example of. Sllaally file- by file with scarcely the <crackling of a twig or the rustling of a leaf "to mark 'tiieir passage, the Yo- ruVas moved down the steep bank, for flflny had. been trained in forest warfare frem childhood, an'd had their' wild Sand with spear-blade and flintlock gun against the fierpe tribes of the Western Soudan and '-the Arab raiders from the northern desert. 'Captain Cranton watched them flitting like ghosts through the shadows, and abused the clumsiness of his subaltern- who tore Ills way noisily svfth nervous haste through every" obstacle'. until he heard their feet sucking in the soft mire. Pre sently there was a splashing by the edge of the ford; then the sound melted into the gurgle of the river, and the last dim figure disappeared into a drifting cloud or mist-. . . . . 1. "Get on . there, - ibis is no time for rest. said the Captain. as the 'leading flies halted; and he hurried forward only to sink breast deep in a, steep- sided hollow, and to wonder if they had blun dered and .lost the track across the ford. While he hesitated there was another roar of flintlock .guns and a. shower, of jagged potleg sang past overhead and splashed along the surface of the river. A Yoruba dropped his rifle with splash, and clutching at iiis side col lapsed, a limp heafc. into the stream. A comrade dashed forward, but it was too late; there was a choking gasp, and with an oily gurgle the muddy current, closed over a ghastly face, and the Yoruba was gone. The soldiers stared at one another for a moment, and a few of the Snider butts came home to the shoulder with a rattle. bqt. -Captain Cranton said sternly. "The mail' is dead; the first who fires without Jrjj) order dies also. Forward there!" Tlien with jset teeth, the Yorubas .went ahead, floundering and splashing, struggling;, shoulder deep against the power of the stream with uplifted rifles, while the sickly "Doctor gasped for breath as he was hair carried, half draped, 'Wildly through the water.

While j the .eyil-smelling vapor was still eddying and drifting along the face of the stockade, with a yell the Yoru bas rushed forward, stumbling and blundering over . shattered logs and Slowing cinders, half choked by the sickening odors of the explosive, and swept down the main street of the vil lage, driving the tivernnen before them at the bayonet-point like. a flock of frightened sheep.
