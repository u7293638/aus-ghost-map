FiTZSIMMONS M P- Some short time ago we announced through these columns that Mr Fitzsimmons contemplated resigning his seat in the Assembly, either before or lmmediately after the opening of the next session of parliament. Since then, however, the hon gentleman has been in communication with some of the leading members of his constituency and the result is that he will, in all probability retain his seat during the next session of parliament. It seems that several of his constituents are under the impression that he gave a pledge, in the course of the election, binding himself to retain his seat during the ensuing session , and rather than risk a violation of any such pledge he has con- sented to remain in the house tor six months longer, when he will, in all probability, take a trip to England. New Cotton Company -We hear that a movement has been initiated in Brisbane for the establishment of a Cotton Growing Company, the shares in which are to be £200 each. A Provisional Committee, we understand, has already been formed, and the following gentle men are mentioned as having taken up shares - Dr Hobbs, Messrs G and A Raff, Barker, Douglas, McMillan, Fitzsimmons M.L A, and Mr Thorn. One of these gentlemen (Mr Bar- ker.we believe has taken up shines to the ex tent of £1000.
