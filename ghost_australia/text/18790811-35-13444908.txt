PROTESTANT HALL. ; On Sunday of ternoon, Pastor Allen addressed.-,'¿bfigre!» j, gation in the Protestant Hall upon the Great apostacy of the Latest Pastoral,' " and upon the subject of Cardinal Newman's policy "now urged upon us by Dr. Vaughan's, being that which is adopted in Austria, and which " does, not allow a Protestant to say grace, read the Bible, or pray! to his God." The congregation almost oiled the lower part of the hall, and the speaker, using freely the weapon of ridicule, aroused the interest of the audience to a high And merry pitch, and placed Dr. Vaughan, Cardinal Newman, and the Church of Rome in anything but a favourable light. On the question of the " Great Apostacy," has maintained the dispute was not one between Dr. Vaughan and Cardinal Newman on the one hand and Protestants on the other, but between the Roman Catholic hierarchy and the Apostle Paul, who, inspired by the Holy Ghost; described in one of his epistles what, the " Great Apostacy " really was, while Dr. Vaughan and Cardinal Newman endeavoured to make it something else. Pastor Allen's interpretation of the " Great Apostacy," as described by the' Apostle Paul, was that it was the Roman Catholic Church itself. Hymns appropriate to the occasion were sung. "
