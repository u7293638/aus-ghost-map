Mining. The Paringa. I have been asked for my candid opinion of the intrinsic value of the Paringa Consolidated Mine. Well, I think that it cannot really be called a mine at all, but a mere prospect of fair prospective worth which has been tinkered at by a set of incapable directors, and a 'duffing' mine manager for over two years without the ghost of any profit, except that derived from the fluctuating price of the shares by certain people 'in the swim.' The mine is just out of the line of the pay lodes as far as they are known to exist. It may, nevertheless, some day—and by accident, as it were — prove to contain ore bodies, or the extension of ore bodies, hitherto unknown; but the finding of a detached bunch of ore in the property, or in an adjacent property, or the finding of a mineralised stratum of very low-grade value rock, is not a matter of much importance or value, though it may suffice to pay directors' fees and ' perks' and keep up active work on the property. In short, so far as can be seen, there is no great opportunity for the making of a mine, but there is, no doubt — owing to its apparently favorable location \- some chance of making or losing money by gambling in shares so long as they are—doubtless from purely disinterested motives — so industriously 'puffed' by most of the 'financial ' papers. Thus the 'Sunday Times' London mining correspondent.
