;vif:UN,TIL7DEATH!\ Bi' F. A. WlSSTBURY. Mnlco mo no vows of constancy, dear friend, To.lovo me, though I die, thy .wliolo life long, Antl 'lovo no other till thy days shall end — . . Nay, it were rash and wrong. If, 'tliou, canst love another, bo it so, r^woulil not reach out of ray quiet grave To bind thy heart, if it should choose to go, i Love shall not he a slave. My placid ghost' I trust will walk sereno -Ifi, clearer1 light, than gilds these eavtlily morns, ''?Above the jealousies and envies keen '' ' ' ? Which sow this life' with thorns. ThoU Avouldst not feel my shadowy caress, ; t .If, ' after death, my soul should linger here. ' Men's hearts crave tangible, close tenderness, ? 'Love's presence warm and near. If wonld not make me sleep more peacefully ?' ''ihiii'thcm wort waiting all tliy life in woo For 'my poor sake. What love thoij hast ?.'.: ct:.foi- mo . - ? ' Bestow it ore I go. : - Gni'veavot upon a stone, when I am dead, The praises which remorseful mourners give To women's grave — a tardy recompense — , „r,,;fJJ.ut speak them while I live.. Heapiuottlie lioavy marble on my head ?'ft To shut away tho sunshine and the dew ; Let small, blooms grow there, and the grasses wave, And rain-drops 'filter through. Thou wilt meet many fairer and more gay Than I, but, trust me, thou canst ne'er find t One who will- lave and serve thee night and day _ ..j ? '?'?'??'With a more single mind. Forget me when I die.
