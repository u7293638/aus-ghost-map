CORRESPONDENCE. "QUEER'S" QUERIES. (to THE EDITOR OP THE "JEWISH HERALD,") 4 4 QJURELY there must have been a mistake," I thought, after O reading the first few lines of the letter Bigned " Ures Trewly." "The communication was evidently intended for Punch, and some sort of a wag put it into the wrong box." But no, there was the head-line as clear as possible, " To the Editor of the Jewish Herald." This was a new puzzle to me, and the only solution I could find for it was that the editor of Punch had re jected the epistle on account of its stale wit and forced puns. Once, and only once, I could detect a glimpse of argument, and with that alone I shall deal, thougli it is but the ghost of an argument. " Ures Trewly " intimates that in the words WQm UN ntyoij, which I consider nonsense, the letter b first denotes purpose, and then the indirect object. But I ask where in the Scriptures do we find an analogy for such a construction 1 Surely, we cannot make the language, nor give its words an idiomatic use which they never possessed 1 1 find in Psalms xc. ntyob i-jb&h; ; in Psalms cii. 'O 'oyb nban ; in Habakuk pipnnb nbsnj and in no instance has the b the meaning, "A prayer for." Let " Ures Trewly" show me a quotation from the Bible bearing out his contention and I will acknowledge my mistake, otherwise I must look upon the before mentioned words as a case of " murdering " the Hebrew language. Again, how can UN mean, " We come with a blessing I" The only letter that will express the preposition " with" is3 and not b, Compare I Samuel xvii. 45. Let " Ures Trewly " correct me if I am wrong. As to the propriety of identifying the miners of to-day with the pitwi W3N, I challenge " Ures Trewly " to give me another explanation beside the one I have already given of the origin of the prayer, idin rrn niufli W3N Vi. If he cannot do it I will give him the explanation free of charge.â€” -Yours, &c.;, Rosh Chodesh ICislev, 5645. QUEER.
