NEWS BY THE JOHN ELDER. The following are the letters of our London correspondents received by the John Elder : HISTORY OF THE FORTNIGHT. (WHOM otra OWN CORRESPONDENT.) LONDON, JULY 16. SCENES IN THE HOUSE OF COMMONS Parliament seems lapsing into anarchy The present Session has little to show in the way of useful legislation, but will be memorable for scenes of disorder which jeopardise the perfect freedom of our Parliamentary Bye tem. 1 he obstructionists are again in the ascendant, and business degenerates into a chaos of contentious words, in which authority and usage are set at nought, 'the necessity of devising some check is strongly felt, but nothing has yet been done, owing to the constitutional regard for the liberty of individual members which it is the pride of Parliament to have preserved intact for so many generations The present state of things has arisen in connexion with the Army Discipline Bill, which has been delayed in committee, to the great detriment of other important measures The main question of flogging in the army and navy is one which may be advantageously discussed, and it was with general satisfaction that the public heard of the decision to reduce the maximum number of lashes from 50 to 25 There is, indeed, a considerable section in favour of the total abolition of the punishment, and meetings of working men have been held in Hyde park and elsewhere to demand it. It is the unseemly manner in which the controversy has been conducted that strains our Parliamentary institutions the nature of the cat employed has been very warmly discussed Mr Callan, who had constituted himself an authority on the subject described those he had seen at the Admiralty, and one in particular, a " marine cat, of a very objectionable character, whereupon one member moved to report progress until the cat was produced 'line ed to a very animated altercation Mr ODonricll insisted that unless the Bpeci men, or sealed cat, were produced, the bill should not be allowed to proceed one inch The next day four cats of nine tails were brought down and placed in the cloak room for the inspection of members Their formidable nature "excited some surprise The " marine cat, the existence of which was at first denied, attracted most attention From the handle depends a very thick cord, which divides into three separate cords and each of these again into three tails 14in in length, which are knotted each mile times, so that, as the description runs, 81 la rations can be inflicted preach full stroke lina cat, Mr Smith afterwards explained, is identical with the army cat, and only used for marine when on service on shore. The navy cat has nine lashes It is against these instruments that the agitation is directed The following day, which was Saturday, usually a holiday, the House met to expedite business at half past o'clock and did not adjourn till Sunday morning Nearly 11 hours were spent in a continuous wrangle, spite of Mr Cross s attempt to smooth the way with a promise of concessions Perhaps the drollest incident was Mr -iggar'a apology when called to order, one of many times, by the Chairman of Committees with a thumb in the armhole of his waistcoat, and with a deprecatory wave of the other hand, he rose, and said " Of course, I withdraw any expression I may have used, but I really don't remember what 1 are supposed to leave said On the Monday evening, Colonel Stanley stated that after full consideration with his colleagues of the Government, and with the military authorities, he had determined to limit corporal punishment to offences punishable with death But the death penalty in war covers almost every offence An irregular discussion followed Mr Chamberlain, the member for Birmingham, at once protested Lord Hartington, later in the evening, in terposed in favour of the Ministry, objecting that the question of flogging should be discussed at the proper time, when the schedule of offences was before them and that this procedure simply delayed the business Mr Chamberlain retorted warmly, referring to the noble lord as one who was ' lately the leader of the Opposition, but who now appeared to be the leader of only a section of it Mr Fawcett, with the courageous independence that never fails him, opposed himself as an advanced Liberal to the more clamorous members OF Parliamentary government possible," he asked, " if after a fair and legitimate discussion a minority would not yield to a majority ' What would be the result of a continuance of such proceedings ' Why, mica would be proposed to limit and curtail the privileges of Parliament, and who would suffer by those rules Not the Execu live, but independent members holding advanced Liberal opinions The privileges of Parliament would in the end Buffer, and therefore there was far more at stake than the fate of a particular bill or the issue of a particular question. He hoped, nevertheless that the question of flogging would be legitimately fought out It was in this sense that the Marquis of Hartington had spoken of the dignity of Parliament as an even more important matter than the question of flogging When he rose to speak on a subsequent evening the vehement and prolonged cheering of the great mass of the Opposition showed how they esteemed Mr Chamber lain's reference to their late leader The member for Birmingham, insisted on dividing on the question of reporting progress, but obtained only 35 votes against 2 6 He has since explained, in a letter to the Daily News, that he does not renounce Lord Hartington s leadership but that rather the noble lord had pointedly disclaimed his allegiance The week had not passed before an inci- dent much more exciting occurred the House was settling down once again in committee on the unfortunate Army Bill, when Mr Sullivan moved to report progress in order to call attention to the fact that a " stranger was in the members gallery taking notes of the speeches of particular members It had been previously whispered that the object was to obtain data for legal proceedings, and that the Government intended to proceed against certain members on an indictment charging them with " malicious, unparliamentary and unlawful obstruction, and derangement of public business ' Mr Sullivan, who characterised the procedure an espionage, now asked on whose authority the notes were being taken, and for what purpose and whether it was in order Mr Callan also protested against " the sitting of a spy upstairs, and was called to order for denouncing the arrangement as dishonourable The Speaker, who was received with loud cheers, at once explained that the notes were being taken by his order " Honourable members, board are aware that, according to the practice of the House, minutes of our proceedings are taken from day to day these minutes are published in the votes, and members see them every morning Lately it has come to my knowledge that there has been great and unexpected delay in the progress of the Army Discipline Bill through committee, and on my own responsibility, and for my own information, I desired that the minutes should be taken of the proceedings on that bill of a more full character than those which are taken from day to day I may say that these minutes have no reference whatever to par ticuUr members of this House They are fair and impartial reports, read I am surprised that any body of members should suppose that I have had Cis course taken in reference to particular members. I should be exceeding my duty if I were to do HO ' Being further challenged by Mr Parnell, the Speaker repeated that there was no pretence at a resort of what was said, but the notes were full minutes and embraced all members without distinction Mr. O'Connor Power we proceeding to denounce the proceeding as without precedent, when the "Speaker ruled that as the purpose for which progress had been reported had now been fulfilled the House would resume the conversion of the Army Bill in committee It was in vain Mr. O'Connor Power shouted after him as he left the chair, "I protest ' I protest He had to content himself with another motion Mr committee to report progress in order to bring the Speaker back and take the judgment of the House A prolonged and stormy conversation followed. The fresh members, one after another, objected vehemently Then it was agreed to withdraw the motion to report progress, on the understanding that the matter should be brought up as a question of privilege Scarcely had this been agreed to, when the motion was revived on the ground that the reporter remained in the gallery Dr Callan said the notes were a moral caW details, and as the material " cat had been placed under the sergeant-at-arms He did not see why the moral cat should not be placed in the custody of the norarian It was urged by more moderate men that the official should be withdrawn reading the judgment of the house But the Chancellor of the Exchequer ?"cl,2eil 10 interfere with the discretion of the Speaker Finally, the committee? was allowed to proceed with its proper business, to cool in a "catcdatmo3Pnere that was along which Mr PAWS Crowds the next morning, j when Mr Parnell moved a resolution which I declared the action of the Speaker to be without precedent, a breach of the privileges of Parliament, and a danger to the liberty and independence of debate The Chancellor of the exchequer moved, as an amendment, that the Speaker was justified in the directions given, and that he was entitled to the support and confidence of the House. The Marquis of Hartington, who seconded the amendment, spoke his views without any official reserve no said the present state of things was one which could not be permanently endured, and maintained that fuller information was required that the Speaker might be able to advise on the subject On division Mr Parnell's motion was rejected by 42 to 29 The amendment then became the substantive resolution, and it was resolved to continue the debate upon it at the evening sitting OnthenousethenreBummg, Mr Gray moved an amendment to the effect, that the clerk assistant should not take any notes without the previous direction of the House, and that the entry of particular members Breeches was without warrant. Further debate ensued, which ended in the defeat of this proposal by 292 to 24 The Chancellor of the Exchequer's resolution was then carried without a division and the result hailed with long continued cheering The session is rapidly running out, and there are yet many matters of practical bust ness-the > note of credit on the African war amongst them-that must he completed The Government has been compelled to abandon the Criminal Code Bill and the County Boards Bill, as well as some other measures of minor or less general interest The Irish University Bill has passed the second reading in the House of Lords From casual express Bions, it has been inferred that the Ministry would not be unwilling at a later period to supplement it with some system of grants but in its present form it finds scant favour with the Irish Catholics, whom it was intended to relieve THE AGriCULTURAL QUTSTIOV The long continuance of bad weather threatens still heavier burdens than those of which our agriculturists have been come planning, the winter was followed by a late spring In June the vegetation of fields and gardens was a month behind, and since the first few genial days of promise the clouds have returned, and the rains have fallen copiously there is little sunshine, and the low temperature hinder growth The fruit does not ripen, and the hay harvest is dealt) ed, or destroyed A feeling of alarm prevails in many quarters, for never were the tanners less able to bear the losses of such a season Mr Chaplins proposal could not have been discussed under circumstances more provocative of sympathy It was in the form of a motion for an address praying Her May esty to appoint a Royal commission to" inquire into the depressed condition of the agricul tural interest, and the causes to which it was owing , whether those causes were of a temporary or of a permanent character, and how far they had been created or could be remedied by legislation The Government have acceded to the request The debate was one of much interest Mr Chaplin disclaimed any idea of a proposal to revive protection but his speech and the speeches of others had an evident leaning in that direction. It was, however, agreed that the inquiry should include all related questions though specially directed to the effects of the American competition Mr Bright seemed roused by the near presence of this ghost of his ancient enemy and spoke with all his old energy in vehement denunciation of our present land laws "I believe, he said ' it would increase the price of land all over the country if you were to abolish all the ancient, stupid, and mischievous legislation by which you are embarrassed Let us have the inquiry wide and honest, at least let us break down the monopoly that has banished so much of your labour from your farms, and that has pauperised so much of the labour which has remained On the ruins of that monopoly, when you have broken it down, there will arise a fairer fabric and although it is not possible that I should live to see it, yet the time will come when you will have a million homes of comfort and independence throughout the land of ] England which will attest for ever the wisdom and the blessedness of the new policy that you have adopted More significant however, than this speech was that of Lord Hartington, who frankly avowed him self also in favour of land reform In reply to Mr Chaplin he said that the remedy to the state of things he had described must be looked for elsewhere than in the quarter he had indicated ' If, said the Liberal leader, he can prove his case, it is nothing more or less than this-that the land Bjatemof this country, under existing conditions, has broken down, and that the land will not move support, as it has hitherto supported, the three classes of farmer landlord, and agricultural labourer Lord Hartington charge termed the land system of this country as one which prevails in no other country in the world He declared further that one of the blots on our System is our system of the entail and settlement of land When a man of Lord Hartington s position and training himself the heir of a great land owner allows himself to speak in this way from his place moreover as leader of the Opposition we know what the next generation may expect There are large domestic questions already looming on the horizon COLONIAL TOPICS (FROM OUR OWN CORRESPONDENT LONDON, JULY 16 THE COLONIAL AND INDIAN MUST UAIS The statement lately current that the Indian Council had resolved to abolish the Indian Museum in London as a distinct in stitution has been confirmed in Parliament The contents are to be attributed to Kew, South Kensington and the British Museum A portion of the jewellery is to be sold The saving that will be effected is about £9,000 per annum Some regret has been expressed but no opposition has been offered to the intentions of the council which resulted from the home Government having declined to defray) from the Imperial revenue the expense of maintaining the museum Dr Forbes Watson has received telegraphic replies to the communications he addressed to the Australian Governments last March upon the offer being made to reserve for four months the new opera-house buildings on the Thames embankment as a site for the Colonial Museum Appended to Dr Watson's return nications were plans of the building to show me the accommodation proposed to be reserved for the different agents general in reply from Western Australia was the brat received, I think and stated that the Government were willing to appropriate a sum for the museum Le, but that the space allotted to the colony was in excess of its wants New South Wales replied that it was ready to take action in the matter if the other colonies joined in the undertaking The South Australian and Queensland answers were somewhat identical theGovern mence of both these colonies stating that they were prepared to consider the question and in fact approving of the museum but being of opinion that the home Government should I take the initiative tasmania declined to take part in the affair 1 from New Zealand no reply has been received, but as no telegrams have come through from Australia since the not that owing to the interruption of the cable it is possible that the answer may be writing from your colony Dr W Watson was informed that you were spending money freely on your forthcoming Exhibition, and that, therefore it would be inadvisable to contribute towards a Colonial Museum at present The result of the replies on the whole is not regarded as favourable towards -an early establishment of the museum How ever as Dr Watson a hands will be no lander tied by his connexion with the Indian Museum, he intends devoting his time towards the furtherance of the colonial project, in the hope that it will at no very distant date be warmly taken up by both colonial governments and colonists THE WINE, DUTIES The committee of the House of Commons on the wine duties, which has been sitting for several weeks under the presidency of Mr Cartwright, who moved for the committee have agreed to their report lucy recommend that w nea with greater alcoholic strength than 25 degrees should be admitted at the lower rate of duty, which would be left at la , but they resolved to leave to the Government the question of deciding up to wlmtdeLreo of strength the wines should be admitted at such rate A proposal was made in the committee to admit wines up to 37 or 38 but this was objected to by the majority, and although no resolution was come to there was a feeling in favour of admitting wines at the lowest rate up to 32 degrees This would meet the views of the Australian wine producers The committee are in favour of a sliding scale above the maximum fixed for the shilling duty proposing that a charge shall be made upon every degree in excess of it, and that this shall bear a due proportion to the spirit duty In addition, the commit to reserve for consideration the Bugges "Vi a lower duty upon wines, under a (x ample test of strength and money value, In Spain it has been stated that the committee were willing to raise the shilling duty to 38 degrees by SykeS hydrometer, which would have completely acceded to the Spanish demands, but this, as will be seen from what is stated above, is incorrect-30 degrees would have included almost all fortified wines, and for fortifying, the Spanish imports of alcohol are increasing every year During the first few months of 1879 they reached 124 000 hectolitres THE ITALIANS AND NEW GUINEA Statements received from Rome BIUCO the commencement of the present month point to the Italian expedition to New Grant, spoken of some months ago, as being still intended, and indicate that the rumour that whilst it was ostensibly being organised for New Guinea. it was really destined for Albania, was incorrect We are now told that preparations are being continued for New Guinea, and that Signor Fagan intends sailing for Australia with a small party of friends in the middle of September, and that during his absence the final arrangements for the organisation of the expedition will be proceeded with Menotti Garibaldi will remain in Italy. MiscrEUTÑrous Captain Lord Charles Scott has been appointed to the Bacchante, which is to proceed on a cruise with the sons of the Prince of ales She was commissioned yesterday, and will have a complement of 384 men The Princes will join the ship in September, and the cruise will occupy a twelvemonth The Bacchante will visit most of our colonial possessions, and although none of them have been specifically named, doubtless your colonies will be included The Whitehall Review states that the inhabitants of Fiji have been informed by the Colonial Office that it has. been decided to allow Sir Arthur Gordon to retain the go vernment of the colony for the full period for which he had been appointed, and that no notice can be taken of their recent petition Last Wednesday Dr Kenealy asked the Home Secretary, in the House of Commons, why he objected to see Captain Barry, of New Zealand, a person of position there, having been three times mayor, and who, having well known Arthur Orton and De Castro, was prepared to prove that they were two distinct individuals Mr Cross replied that he had only followed the usual course Captain Barry had made a statement in writing, which he had forwarded to the Home Office, and it had been referred to the solicitor to the Treasury and to the law officers having charge of the case A few day B back the Daily Î elf graph published a telegram stating that Mr Ahmed Kenealy, the doctors eldest son, had committed suicide by shooting himself with a pistol Yesterday it contradicted the statement, and says that the telegram was a forgery, and the telegraph authorities are now inquiring as to the sender There seems considerable doubt when the action brought by Mr Elliston against the Peninsular and Oriental Company in connexion with the proceedings against him at Bow street will come off Your Government telegraphed for him to go out upon Weiberg a re arrest, but his friends and solicitors recommended him not to do so In the first place, it is stated that he has no evidence to true and secondly, his friends do not appear to have much confidence in your authorities As has been asserted, if the positions were reversed, and he were wanted to come home from Australia, trust could be placed in the authorities here to take no unfair advantage of his presence , but Elliston 8 friends think that if he went out to Melbourne it is quite possible that those who were so hasty in telegraphing for his arrest on the statement of such a man as Weiberg, and after the Peninsular and Oriental Company had declined to take proceedings, might not scruple to re arrest him at the Antipodes Such is the statement current in London The Bishop of Dunedin preached in the first Surrey camp at V lmbledon on Sunday last The spring wheat crop in Canada promises to be slightly below the average Ino a fall wheat IB 21 per cent above the average crop, and the barley crop will be an average one The wheat crop in Germany will, it is stated, be splendid A deputation of the relatives of young men who have joined the Cape 1 conner Armed and Mounted Police, and who were into duced by several members of Parliament waited upon Sir Michael Hicks Beach last week in reference to the alleged unjust way in which the young men had been dealt with by the Cape Government in being forced to serve any military capacity After listening to the statements the Colonial Secretary replied at length, and promised to communicate with the authorities at the Cape He was afraid, however, that he could give no effectual redress, as the Cape possessed constitutional government and was, therefore, independent of Colonial Office control At a recent meeting of the select com- mittee on the co-operative store system, Mr Strangways, formerly Premier of South Australia, gave evidence, and described his experience in England in dealing with stores and retail shops The members of the International Telegraph Conference paid a visit to the East and West India Docks last Saturday Amongst other vessels inspected by them was the John Elder the Cuzco steamer reached Suez? yesterday, a few hours after the Indian mail had been despatched from Alexandra The Austrust in mails by this Orient steamer will now be left in Egypt for several days, and will arrive simultaneously with those despatched from Melbourne on the 12th June, due here on the 28th inst Tina has been the fate on recent occasions of the mails forwarded by the monthly Orient steamers In the Admiralty Division of the Supreme Court, on July 10, before Sir It J Phillimore and Trinity Masters, cross actions of damage were heard in respect of a collision between the Sw if taure and Loch Tay, which happened off Folkestone about 1 o'clock in the morning of the 14th May last The Loch Tay is a full rigged iron ship of 1,191 tons, and was on a vol ago from Melbourne to London, and the Sw if there was bound from Newcastle for AgiBtera The weather was thick with fog and the Loch Tay, in charge of a pilot, was being towed by the tug Cambria According to the case for the Loch Tay, she was steering L N F and making about two knots and a half an hour, and the tug a whistle was being frequently Bounded The green h(,htof the Swiftsure was seen about 200 yards off and about three points on the starboard bow 'The helms of the Loch Tay and her tug were at once put hard a port, the tug s whistle was sounded, and the Swiftsure hailed to starboard, but the latter, which was carrying great deal of sad and going at too great a speed, with her stem ran into the port bow of the Loch Tay, doing her considerable damage For the Swiftsure it was contended that she was sailing close hauled on the starboard tack going at about four knots an hour. The two vertical lights of the tug were seen about a mile off on the starboard bow, and the fog horn was blown on the Sw if tBure, but the tug and her tow came on, heading to cross the bows of the Swiftsure, and thus brought about the coal baron Mr Butt, Q.C., and Mr. E C Clark son appeared for the owners of the Loch 'Tay Dr Deane, QC , and Mr W Phillimore for the owners of the Swiftsure His Lord ship) came to the conclusion that the Swift cure was alone to blame for the collision, and decreed accordingly Mr 'I A Wright, secretary to the Royal Commissioners of the Australian Exhibitions, in a letter dated July 1, addressed to Mr T B Potter, M P reports the failure of the attempts which have been made to obtain a reduction of telegraphic rates in favour of exhibitors at Melbourne and Sydney The commissioners have received a communication from the Treasury enclosing a report from the Postmaster General unfavourable to the granting of the privilege, the Post- master General stating that as the telegrams in question would be sent with the view of facilitating the arrangements of manufacturers and tradesmen who were exhibiting for trade purposes, and because of the pecuniary advantages they were expecting to derive he could see no reason why the Post Office department should forego its revenue for their benefit, adding that he regarded the discussion of the question as outside the POA era of the delegates at the Telegraph Conference Under these circumstances the executive committee of the commission have reluctantly come to the conclusion that they are unable to take further steps in the matter MONETARY AND COMMERCIAL INTELLIGENCE (From our OWN connnsroNDEiT ) LONDON, JULY 16 The dividends having been paid, money is in still greater abundance than at the date of my last letter, and mercantile requirements being slack, advances are readily obtainable at from i to 1 per cent being 1 to li per cent below the official minimum The discount houses a fortnight since lowered their allowance fordepositBat call and "notice to J and 1 per cent respectively, and a further reduction is contemplated Some large amounts have been changing hands recently in connexion with several loan operations, but these transfers of money seem to do little or nothing to relieve the congestion of the market On the 8th, an instalment of nearly £800,000 fell due on the New South Wales loan on the following day there were the Treasury Bill payments and repayments on the 10th over half a million was due upon the last issue of Metropolitan Board of Works consols, and yesterday the deposit instalment was paid in connexion with the new Canadian three million loan None of these transactions make any impression upon the hoarded surpluses of the Bank of England, which maintain their strength undiminished Yet much of the gold which arrived from Australia and the East 10 days ago, instead of going into the bank was taken for Spain and Japan The silver market has relapsed into a state of stagnation, the present quotation being 51sec per oz.
