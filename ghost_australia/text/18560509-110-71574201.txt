BURTONS CIRCUS. There have been highly interesting nov- elities in the performances of Burton's Cir- cus these last two evenings. The wonders of Le Perche were exhibited on Wednes- day. Vaulting, Gymnastics, Jugglery on horseback at full gallop afforded great a- musement to the company. The perfor- mances of the monkey in riding, turning somersaults, &c;, were astonishing. ther was a novelty and origininality too about the sullies of wit of the two Clowns. A new pantomine wa exhibited, called "The Sailors Ghost" which afforded very evident amusement. Last evening, the performanaces of Madame St. John on horse- back afforded further novelty and enter- tainment. It is a pity that the weather has been so unpropitious this last night or two, as to restrict the attendance upon these performances. They are well worth witnessing ; and every one who has once been is eager to attend a second time.
