Edwards secured the services of a man of of 1 ongntabno, named J o, ns pilot and interpreter In the first capacity he was of little use, but proved of service in our inter course with the natives As amor Island and New Guinea Our course after leaving Australia was due north to Warrior Island, a distance of 60 miles, but, as we were 1 to in getting away from our anchorage, we were compelled to drop anchor the first night under the lee of Sun Island, one of three low wooded island lying about five miles apart, Known as the "Three Sisters,' the others being named Bet and Poll The most notable thing about Suo Island was that the anchorage ground mo moved on about a mile north-west of the island seemed to be perfectly covered with masses of the young pearlshell, and was so frequently found the same to be the case off Bet Island.

The men have no clothing or covering of any kind, some of them are marked like the Australians walls seams on the shoulder and they set out the lobes of their cars into fanciful shapes. and pierce the rim all round and ornament it with coloured wool or fibre 'They seem fond of ornaments of bird's feathers for the head, and necklets of pearl shell The woman we saw little of, Uley are not allowed to be seen by strangers, but we saw enough to satisfy us that they were no beauties They are the hewers of wood and drawers of water , all the work that has to be done is done by them the duties of the man being confined to fishing, hunting, and fighting A very scanty covering round the loins it then only clothing but they seem fond of ornaments of cassowary feathers round the knee and ankle The chief, and almost only, weapons of offence of these people are bows and arrows but these are of very formidable do cription The bows are of bamboo, very like those used by English anchors, and all lung in the same way, and the shows are over four foot long, and can be used effectively at a distance of 120 yards Like the wool) -haired races of Fiji and the New Hebrides of which they are probably a variety these people use kava Captain Edwards saw some of the loot with Maine, who informed him that it was got some distance up the country, and that they were well acquainted with the use of it They are great navigators, and go long distances in their canoes, which are of great size, and are made from theoxenvoted hunks of large coral trees (Li ill i ina) Their supply of annual food is chiefly from the pigs, which are very numerous, both in a wild and the slate I saw no indication among them of cannibalism, though human skulls were not an uncommon ornament in their houses The appearance of the country is the same everywhere Tromwheio the ship lay we could see the coast line of New Guinea from Saibai Island on the west to Bestow Island on the east, a distance of thirty miles, and the uniformity) was perfect In some places the mangrove seemed to grow out into the sea in others, no not Moha is, there was a beach closely bolted by cocoanut palms, and, behind, ever) vi here the same absolutely level mud flat, without the slightest apparent rise as far as the eye could reach, and all densely covered with trees of all kinds and wires At no place, I should say was this interminable wooded means more than three or four foot above the level of the sea or by of The Ghost spots have all been selected by the natives for their bananas and taro plantations , but even these places have to be intersected every three or four feet by ditches to keep the water off them. There they cultivate besides bananas, taro, v ams, and sweet potatoes, crotons and other showily leaved plants. The country also produces cocoanuts, sago, and bread fruit On our first day ashore we walked for a little distance along the beach, attended by all the youngsters of the village, who seemed quite delighted with our visit, and kept supply) in g us with grasshoppers and every living thing they could pick up, with the greatest diligence. A few birds were shot, but Mr Masters found all attempts to penetrate the jungle ineffectual The following day I determined to attempt the naviga- tion of the river, and accordingly at an early hour a party of twenty, including the captain, left the ship in the steam launch and surf boat, and after calling at the village and getting Maine and Owen to accompany us, we commenced our first essay to penetrate into the interior of the country The Kntow, at its mouth, is about 200 yards wide ; it Very soon, however, narrows to about 60 yards, and it was not more than Unity yards wide at the highest point we reached For the first two miles we passed through a dense forest of mangrove, but beyond that the margin of the river was closely linked by a very beautiful palm, which raised its huge frond like leaves light from the surface of the water to a height of nearly 50 feet Behind these there was the lofty and interminable forest, excepting where occasionally B. break in the dark mass showed a banana or care planta- tion The day was fine, the view on some of the i cached was very lovely, ovorvthmg-ticos, birds, do , were now U us, we were progressing most favourably, and were in Ki cat sun it's, when we were stopped by a tree of great but, which had fallen or been of fled, across the river We had then ascended the river about eight or nine miles, and as we were in a fine stream of fresh water, three fathoms deep, we were unwilling to return without an assay 64 "'zone Our tomahawks how i vor, were quite unequal to the task, and we were after five hours! delay compelled to turn back, with the intention of m dear ano! bei alte meet the following day with suitable axes and cross cut saws Our having to turn back was unfortunate in another respect It would appear that we ought befo e as sending the river so far, to have communicated with an people of the various villages through whose torn tory we had to pass, but as we had started without doing so our greens were in hopes that our sudden arrival at the largest village would so surprise the people that it would be easy to appease them, but our failure, and having to turn back seemed to arouse the whole country and from the frightful noises are heard in all directions, I think we must have been ful lowed for some miles by hundreds of infuriated savages It was said that one snow was shot, but I certainly saw neither arrow nor blackfellow I was afraid that this conti stamps might seriously affect our chance of ] penetrating inland, and for some days it certainly did for we found next morning that the people of the Yilhgowoicin a state of great excitement, that a number of the bushmen as they call the up country tribes, had came down to urge MninonndOwtnto join them in Cannaway ihomvadiiM, and that in fact everything looked like was Munro and Owen, however, remained staunch, and Captain Edwards got them to dispatch messengers to the head men. of the different villages to explain the friendly note of of our visit and give them a few small presents In the meantime one Shooting parties were advised by Main not to wander far from his village In a few days nui ambassadors returned with friendly) greetings and an invitation to visit them from some of the leading men up the river A party was formed the following morning, which I was prevented by illness from joining", to ascend the river again and remove the obstruction, but, despite of axes and crosscut saws, the obstruction remained immovable, and the boats w ci o compelled to return The natives, have vor, along the whole route exhibited the most perfect friendli- ness, in some places making huge presents of bananas, cocoanuts, and taro in others crowding round the boats and offering to trade tobacco, tomahawks, knives, and bright-coloured handkerchief s and pi mt, are the articles most in demand amongst them Having thus failed in my effort to get inland by means of the river, and any progress by land being utterly impossible, I saw that it was of little use remaining longer atKatow Birds were plentiful but could not be got at Crocodiles were abundant, but I had got two, and was told no more Insects were few, and fish were very scarce indeed 1 therefore, on Saturday, July 10, after about eight days) A' stay, gave just actions for a move as soon as possible It was not, however, till the 17th that we again cast anchor offAVarnoi Island The working the ship out from Katow into clear water was more difficult than the approach, mBofai that in addition to the sounding and blue) ing of every inch of the way, we had on our yet am i south-easterly gale directly against us Hamley Island, on account of its reputation as a convenient watering-place, was our next destination, but though the distance was short, the weather was so tempestuous and the wind so unfa vom able, that we did not reach it till the afternoon of the list The intermediate time was spent at anchor off the islands of Dungeness, Long Island, But, Sup, Cocoanut, and York Islands, and some of those we found the Torres Straits pigeon so plentiful that we were enabled to shoot enough for food for the whole ship's company Woiemainedat a very snug anchorage in Treacherous Bar, on the north side of Darnley Island, for a fortnight, waiting for letters from Cape York. Our success in dredging was very great, and altogether out time was not misspent This island, known and described by Jukes, in the voyage of the ITy, by the name of " Erroob,' is very beautiful and fertile, it is of volcanic origin and very precipitous, the rock being a volcanic deposit thickly studded with masses of porous lava The inhabitants are much reduced in number since Jukes wrote of them, and many of their interesting old customs, such as preserving the bodies of their dead, are , are fast disappearing before the march of civilizationwithits accompaniments rum and tobacco There is a missionary teacher resident on (the island, a native of Lifu He scored a very good worthy Farm, and u evidently much liked by the native? On Friday, the 13th August, we left Darnley Island for Hall Sound, on the east side of the Gulf of Papua, and, as we were informed we would find a very heavy sea crossing the gulf, I was reluctantly compelled to leave the steam launch behind in charge of the missionary It had been no part of my intention originally to v wit that part of New Guinea but I found upon our escape from the difficulties of Katow, that the captain was most averse, so long as the strong south east trade wind continued, again loappioaohsuchndangerousconst and hopositively declined to take the ship in towards the mouth of the By River before the month of October There was nothing left for age, Ihoriforo, but to try the east side of the gulf It took an five days to get to Hall Sound, calling on our way at Bramble Kay, the breeding place of innumerable boobies, Poddies, and ferns We found, as we had been told, a very heavy sea in the Gulf, and unfortunately, when we got asthma or 40 miles of the coast of New Guinea the wind went down, but the sea did not, and we were tossed and rolled about for two days within sight of our haven, but powerless to reach it The entrance into Hall Sound is by a narrow but deep Etienne], between large reefs extending from Yule Island a one side to the main land on the other Once inside, there is abundance of room and good shelter for any Maher of Hu largest ships ' Yule Island forms the sea face of the sound, and the l opening on the north side between the island and the main is merely a shallow sandbank We dropped anchor close to the north-west point of the island, opposite Mr D'Albertis' residence, which we could be perched on the side of a clean hill about 100 foot above the water Mr D Alborlia, an Italian gentleman, well-known for his previous exploration of the north coast of New Guinea, established himself on Yule Island some months ago, and though holms suffered from the desertion of most of his men, the loss of his boat, and robbery by the natives, he still persists in holding his ground and prosecuting thoobieotof his wanderings the collection of objects of natural history Assuredly if pluck, perseverance, and determination can command success, Mr D Albertis ought to be successful The inland n about six miles long, picturesque and healthy-looking The soil is rich, and thoplnutationsof the natives are numerous 'The geological formation is singular , it consists entirely of a sedimentary) rock nearly horizontal on the sea face, but with a great dip inwards The book itself is ciloanoti-« and probably of very recent formation, for it is of imposed 11 the coral shells, china, and other nimmo animals at pans it existing in the surrounding sea It is, a fuel, a t not of of fossils, resembling, I should imagine, that in Ki' of Oxford I found on thomas and, on the sea cliffs, and wherever I touched upon using ground, the good great form iii in was much the same, though in most cases, instead of I used when, he ; the concrete had imbedded in it large quantity s of water-worn pebbles of ngxfo, climber dony, and hint of all colours Of course, my observations were confined to the vicinity of the coast and the first line of ranges I had no opportunity of ascertaining the composition of the rain on ranges of high mountains in the real Tho appear men of the, pad of New Guinea is the very opposite of that of Iviitow For a few miles from the coast there are in in >t places dense) mangrove swamps intersected by rail a iter creeks and it is in these places where the population, which is dense, is mostly congregated but beyond that then are low ranges of well-wooded open forest, bearing gum and gigantic evil lies Beyond the ranges, at a distance of perhaps 10 mild ft of in the coast, the country seemed to become von i urn and mountainous, and the whole is backed up by n stn perilous mountain chain, which on a clear day is distinctly visible from the magnificent peaked M mut A rule on the west,!, to the orntor-topped- lonking Mount Owen SI blow on the east But the difference in the chamber and appear rules of the population here from Hint of Katovr is just as marked as the aspect of the country They m o n light endeared race, of medium size well formed and active looking Ilion hair is not woolly, and w gemmill worn very long and tied into a chignon behind ' They are fond of ornaments of all kinds, birds' feathers, boars' teeth, and pearlshell They never use tobacco, but lon still, when they can get it, show the both!

They pay considerable attention to cookery, and they manufacture pottery and cloths and nets of excellent quality from various fibres We remained at our anchorage off Yule librad until Thursday, the 2nd Soplerabpi, during all which time we were employed collecting One attempt Arita made to none state inland We run up a over-rated by Captain Moresby the Ethelton 10 or 12 miles, and onmpedjOiil four night on its banks but we wore, as at Katow, stopped by timber, and it was very apparent that we could not here to reach the mountains by that channel We are fully handsome and v valuable birds during our stay here, averaging in number of specimens from 20 to 30 a day, among them some fine specimens of Buderim sad one of the magnificent tested "ground" We saw plenty of the patriarch til una., í x>_Si_a «." ,., "., I a l "i none Our success in other respects was fall Mr Brazier secured a goodly lot of land shells, Mr Spalding got a dozen specimens of the very taro pullets TPallaeei, and a smoke belonging to the genus Amis was secured, of the length of li feet I was disappointed, however, in not getting specimens of the cassowary and tree kangaroo On leaving Hall Sound it was my intention to visit Redscar Bay, about 21 miles to the east-south-east, as there were still three weeks to nan of the tune which I find fixed upon for my return to Cape York But on finding the wind unfavourable and that no might be a day or two doing so it 1 had h paid to do in three hours I gave instructions for an immediate return to Darnley Island to pick up the steam-launch en i came to Cape York On Wednesday, the 8th instant, the Chevert dropped her anchor in her old anchorage near Somewhat, paid my expedition to New Guinea came to a close I may satisfied from my own observations, and from what I have heard from pearl shellers and others who had visited in tons pints of the lions!, that dread of hostility from the natives need be no bar to the exploration of New Guinea The intercourse which has sprung up lately between people engaged in pearl fibhingnndthoblack Papuans, from Bamp- ton the Dean cranes Island, shows that the hostility to strangers, hitherto ascribed to these people is not in accordance with fact, while as to the yellow inhabitants of the east coast of the Gulf of Papua, their submission to the prince of Mr D Albirhs, their friendly conduct to the missionaries, and their unsuspicious reception of the Basilisk, and afterwards of the Chevert, proves that they have no antipathy to the visits of foreigners the real difficulties in the way of exploration proceed from the climate and nature of the country The low lying wooded swamps, which extend from the bond of the Gulf of Papua westward to the Dutch boundary line, are not only unhealthy, but impenetrable, and the interior of this the most interesting part of the island, can only be reached by finding some liver which can be navigated throughout the whole extent of Hutt enormous delta The Ply, I believe, will be the river by which this may be effected The difficulties in the way of exploration on the eastern side of of the Gulf are considerably less , the country is more penetrate, the climate tolerably healthy, the dis- tunes across the island is very small, and the ambition to ascend the great mountain range will be be stimulated by its proximity and apparent business, so that we may expect soon to hear of this part of New Guinea both j thoroughly examined Already a party of three, consisting of the docks, one of the taxidermists, and one of the botanical collectors of the Chevert expedition, has been formed to proceed to Port Moresby, and I am told that a gentleman named Stone, at present residing with Mr Macfarlane, the head of the mission here, is making preparations for the ascent of Mount Owen Stanley But it is only by penetrating the island from the head of the Gulf or some point further west that its real character and conformation can be seen tamed, and this, which would be worked great difficulty, should I think, be undertaken by the Imperial Government An expedition of this kind, fitted with steam launches and accompanied by scientific men, whose duty it would be to investigate the mineral resources of the country and report upon the value of its vegetable productions, such as timber, gums, barks spices, india rubber, etc, could be associated with a surveying party for the survey of the south coast of the island, which is at present very incomplete All this, I think, should pre- cede annexation or settlement On the subject of settlement I may state that I am convinced, from what I have seen of the races inhabiting New Guinea, that anything that would appear like a permanent occupation of the country, or any part of it, would be violently opposed Both races are extremely jealous of their territorial rights, and a war with either of them would be a serious matter. The Papuans would make very formidable and determined enemies, and the yellow race, though not very formidable as fighting men, are very numerous and it would probably be found necessary, for the safety of a settlement, to drive thousands of those poor people aw ivy from their villages and plantations I am desirous of seeing New Guinea opened to civilization, and I should be very sorry to see any country but England undertakes that task, but I hope that until the Imperial Government judges the time for annexation to have arrived, every effort will be made to discourage such a plan of settlement as that projected a few weeks ago in Sydney. Any allan pt of the kind must end in failure, certainly in the ruin and perhaps the death of the adventurers, and most probably in exciting a fixed hostility to Europeans on the ports of the natives I can understand people settling in a new country where the natural productions offer at once a valuable article of export, but it has not yet been shown that such is the case in New Guinea gold and other metals may be, and probably are plentiful, but no one knows where to look for them. It is more than probable, too, that in a country, with such vast gigantic forests, there may he many vegetable productions of great value, but that has not yet been ascertained But the idea of a earl of Englishmen bottling in New Guinea for the purpose of cultivating the land is preposterous All the labour required would have to be imported, paid for, and protected, for assuredly no help would be got from the natives The black race could not be made to work, and the light coloured people could only be utilised under a system of corn alston, m Inch would never be tolerated in country under BY fish protection is " 1 WILLIAM filACUSAX.
