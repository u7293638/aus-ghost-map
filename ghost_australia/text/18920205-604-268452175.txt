GHOSTS IN THE TfcIMPLE. The London correspondent of the Man chester Courier writes:â€”Christmas is undoubtedly the time for ghosts, aud vory appropriately a strange story reaches mo from one of tho Inns of Court. A sot of ohambers had been vacant for some time; indeed, they had only been tenanted .for throe weeks during the last six years. The rent was remarkably moderate, und tho rooms were comfortable. Accordingly a youug barrister took them for a month or so. He never inquired why it was that they had been so long empty, nor had be any idea that they were supposed to be haunted. He had not, howevor, been in possession many days before he announced his determination to quit tho rooms, though he had spent a good deal of money in doing them up and furnishing them. H:a friends naturally asked for an explanation, and ho con fessed that he had seen a ghost, or rather a collection of ghosts, for every night, he said, the door opened of its own accord and in walked three men and a woman, dressed in last century costumes. They sat down at the table, and commenced to talk and to drink. Eventually the talk got louder aud a violeut quarrel broke out, in tho course of which the woman was Btabbed./ After this catastrophe ghosts disappeared.. Such is the most recent ghost story,.
