' The Sun.' A few months ago we noticed a new Sydney paper called ' The Block.' Quite a number of our readers sent for it), to see what it was like. It didn't live long, poor thing, but gave up the ghost, and was swallowed by ' The Sun. The Society Courier.' This is a stagger paper of 24 pages, and a gorgeous cover. It goes in for the doings of ' Sassiety,' and wrestles with Palmistry and Graphology, music and tho drama, aad lots more things, like ' How to make potatoe soup.' But it's got a ripping good article on sporting, by ' Lynx,' that's good enough to re deem even a poor paper. ' Lynx ' gets hold of some queer items, and he's evidently on the inside track. If the 'Sun' would only print its pictures better, it would be the boss society paper of Australia. But what can you expect for 3d ? Still, it's got a good future before it, and we'll send it along to anybody that wants it, for 4d, but you can order it through your bookseller on trial. P.S. â€” We'ro booksellers when I come to think of it. Doctor : ' You might try a porous plaster.' Patient: '? All right, doctor. What is the latest scientific discovery as to the best method of taking them off.' Tillinghast : 'Wasn't, Mis.-; Kl.'.er born in 1858'?' Gildersleevr : ''?
