His team looks looks well, and will no., doubt play an important part at the N.'l.C. . annual fixture.

The Hur. die Race, now that .Sunflower Tias*een scratched', reduces the field to eight, of, which, Lucy heads the liBt.with lOst 71b. a. nice impost for a mare with her credentials. .

Snip, who used to be pretty fast on the flat, is reported to be alright it Coota. Clansman, the last on the list, is not a bad, 'un, and will run well. The four I like best, are — Lucy, Bouquet, Cedric, and Clansman, and I fancy the rice will be won by. Bouquet ob. Lucy. For the N.T.C. Handicap Roseleaf, Sun flower and Qnictnarch have been with drawn. Silver Rose lias pride of place with ' 9.2, and her performances lately have been first-class, and her chance of annexing one of - the big events appears very rosy. Ready Money, who is also on tlie same mark, if well, will be about at the finish. M.L. A. . I prefer for the shorter raoe. Psiimmeticus, wio is in the winning vein, will take a lot of. beating. Waxworks I do not fanoy for a race of this description. Ganinain is treated well, so is Naughty, Woodlands, audlCame nuud. Sunshower at 7-3, reads well, and if preferred instead of Ganinain, will Jie dan-., geroiu. Mea Culpa, Kiuderepiel ana|Ipvy, on the 7st mark, may ct*ateasnrprisi. From these down I do not think the winner will corno from, except that Golden Spravj. parly Morn, or Arbaces may turn up. 3S) pict ? seven from which the winuer wiUconjefrom.
