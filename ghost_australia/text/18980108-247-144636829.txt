FEDERATION. The Federal Bill, will be con sidered at the meeting of the Federal Convention in Melbourne this month; meanwhile, the general prospects of federation do not improve. Whether Queensland will be represented in the Convention or not is still dbubt ful, but the representatives of , that colony, when they take their places, will certainly bring to the Convention new matter for debate; Sir Hugh Nelson told a Press interviewer that the Queensland vote would be against any limitations to the power of the Senate, and any provision for deadlocks. The financial problem, he added, must be solved in advance, and the question of the federal capital be settled* This is, of cotrse, to call up again ghosts whioh have been happily laid. The entranct of Queensland into the Convention, it is plain will have its risks. It will enormously increase the strength df the smaller States against the larger States ; and the task of equitably Ad justing these two factors has already proved almost too much for the Cot* vention.
