Olakki** GASH AT Abiluen.-Last Friday evening, about duskj Bra bushrangeri/ Olarke, Berriman, and three others, steak up Mr. El ward Kstou'a (tore; at Orowa Flat, Aralnen, and robbed him,of £21 in cash and a gold natch. The gsbg- was «e«a during the day at the home of a relative of some of*he bo*h rangers . who residas at Aralnen. After robbing Eaton's store tbe bushranger** ivfco had all blackened r.w proceeded to Mndmeloog, and stuuk op ibe publiobouse and store of MrJ Morris, .and took some £i or £b from him. Subse quently, a broth«Nin<.law of Erton went to tlie police Camp soma twd miles lijrth* creek, and reported the robbery, Mating that there were only two buhtsogan. Tbi police, with tUe eaoeptionef the look-up beeper, were then all out on iltity in various parte of the valley. Souie ' few minutes after the robbery was reported Constables HiahaMson and Karnes arnve t at the louk up, and, on being informed of tbe tohbery, armed themselves with revolvers, and a gun was also given tothe iufifmsnt, who voluu {teered to assist tbe polioe. The. three pro ? needed ott foot as last as-they could, and ot arriving at Grown Flat tbey asoertoined that the Tobbers bad gone towards Mudme» long. The polioe and their volunteer went thither also. Wueu they arrived at Morris's, four of the bushrangets were in tome other part of Mudmelong, but . man with a blackened face, who turned out to be tbe bushranger Berriman, was found in the bar of Morris's Inn. The constables aaked their guide whether tbi* man was one of the bushrangers. The volunteer declined to aay, and at-the came time threw hit gon on the top of a bed where there were two children, and «rept into the bed, and covend bimself up with the blankets. Constable Riebardson then took Berriman into cus tody on suspicion, bit haVing-no bsndcaffs bound him With cords, and took from him the £21 and: tbe gold watch stolen from Eaton. Before they could get their priso ner away the other four bushrangers came to the house, and Ending their companion iu custody, demanded his release, Karnes at the time was outside, and after some parleying between tbe bushrangers and constable Riehardaoo, the prisoner and the Klinemen's arms were Surrendered to the shrangett, as also the money and tbe watch. Olarke, it seems, ordered. Morris to plsoe a otndje behind Biohardson so that he could have a good shot, which he did, and upon Kiobanison seeing a - revolving jrifie jwinted at him through the Window ,apd*er*rel«Stb*r rerf.iWera fr.m the bands L-of'tba other bu»iiipuit{t*t *nd beintfaUgle bauds1), be reluctantly gave in. In a few uriuutes afterward* constable Karnes came in, aod b< jras alsp stripped of hit revolvers and made prisoner. Dnrin^ thit dmis two Other constables had returned to "the polito camp from tbeir beat, and on being told what bad taken plaee at Grown Flat, tbe; one after tbe other armei) themselves and went to the looality indicated, and as tbey arrived at Dlorris'atbey were also confronted with the. five basbrangers, and their 'guh« and revolvers taken from them and them selves boaud, iu which etste they remained till 1 o'clock on Saturday morning,' when the gang left. Telegrams ware reoeived in Braidwood on Saturday. reporting these outrages, and all the pohoa that eould be spared at onoe went out. Tbe greatest ex citement prevails here, owing to the fact that the five bushrangers ve camped in Dr. Havan'a garden, at Reidsdale; tbey aay they must hvve horses and money. There are several valuable race horses in that part of the distriot, some of the owners of which have been into town and reported the where abouts of the gang. But the police are all absent from town-ell up at Jerrabat-gully direction-the elronghold of tbe bunb raugera. In consequence of this, tbe rsbe- i horses will be brought into town, if tbey are Dot gone before the owners return borne.

It Is eald that be tried experiments in New Sooth Wale*/ abd iV> taioed results by bu machinery as high as six onnoes of gold per load, while tbe oOst was trifling. Should the tailings be 1nb purchased yield anything like that, the ! wealth be will acquire may be imagined. He bat obtained a lease, pf fifteen acres of ground at -Myers Plat, on which he purpose* ereoting bfe machinery, and to which plafee the tailings from tbe various machine* may be readily carted or conveyed by tramway*. It is somewhat Tsmarkable that tbe turner* of orasbiug msobinas should have done so little towards solving tbe question whether gold in paying quantities oan' be tecovereil from qaarti tailings. The experience 6f the last few montba proving tbat a lsifge quantity of gold oan be recovered from tbe tailings by simply washing them through cradle* with blanket oovered.. slides,. and with or without quicksilver wells, ouglit to indaoe mining companies ;to make inquirie* u to whether . furtSer improvement cannot be made in nunbig machinery, so tbat tbe gold now lost in the tailings may be caved. If it pays specu lators to buy up heaps, giving large sum* for them, to erect machinery and employ labour, it ought sorely to pay the oompanies. Tbe diffiottlty it to know whstmaobibery is best fitted for tbe pnrpoee,, ft is admitted that the finer the qaarti i* crashed tbe better for amalgamating pro^ssef, bat it i* also well known that we very best stamper machine does not or ash the qaarti finer than oosiee sand.
