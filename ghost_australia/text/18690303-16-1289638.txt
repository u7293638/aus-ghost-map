MARY RIVER. (FROM OUR OWN CORRESPONDENT.) February 27. After nearly six weeks of dad) thunderstorms, followed by two or three days'' steady rain, we are again blessed with a clear sky From the quantity of land which fell every one I anticipated a flood, or something very like it, but we have been agreeably disappointed Here the mob toss about three or four foot above high water mark, but accounts from the latter part of the river speak of u use those of more than twelve feet As far as weather goes we have had a singularly) good season Bardi) a month has passed without a few good showers, so that the intense boat which prevailed at the beginning the year did you) little harm to) one hastening the ruins of a few who " didn't mind the boat " The very appearance of the farms is a proof of the favorable climatic influence of the season. The corn crop was rather later than usual, but it is only fair to add that in many cases it was much heavier than usual, and on all hands was allowed to be a " fair average crop " For thousand crop, which is now coming on, we could not have had more favorable weather the only complaint that can be made is, that the weeds grow as fast as the corn A week or two hot and dry, will soon lay this ghost Maize has, so far, realised a fair price, though it may almost seem paradoxical, green corn, just beginning to boat, and quite unfit for a horse to oat, has been more readily sold than a decent article Drv maize may be now quoted at 3s 6d to Is If it has been a good season for maize, much more so has it been for sugar cane The last crop was by no means a had one, in spite of the misrepresentations of interested parties, but I cannot estimate the present crop at less than three times the weight of cane to the acre (last season's) It will be a splendid lagoon crop, and I expect will tax pretty heavily all the mills we are likely to have next season Some are already crying out that the farmers will not get them cane crushed, that there is a vast deal more land in (ano, and that there will still only be two public mills for though Mr Eaton, and also Messrs Jamieson and Murray, will have mills in time for the next i lushing, it is not supposed that they will do more than crush their own case I believe, however, that we need have no fear about getting rid of this port of our crop, though I confess I do not clearly see how the funnels above the police camp will manage For some of them the past season must have been almost ruinous, as it is well known than in some instances the miserable dole of ten to fifteen shillings an acre was all that Mr. Meiklejohn would give, and I heard the other day of one farmer who, rather than be so dealt with, cut down his crop and find it in rows to rot It seems a pitiable thing that in mi agricultural and rapidly progressing district, as this certainly is a crop so valuable could be put to no boat or use The distance from the mills will, I am afraid, affect them much more in the coming season than ever it has done in the past They will stand like to change until they get a full hour to their farms, for they will until thou be entirely at the mercy of the millowner, who will subject himself to great inconvenience for the sake of of a very low price My four months' rattoons are . now fully six foot high, but those who had their cane cut in September were very lucky, as the great heat in December found the ground more shaded Of cotton I now hold very little talk No one doubts but that it is a good crop, but the impossibility of getting hands to pick it, over at Something ubovoafun price, threatens to swamp this industry entirely Women here will not, and men cannot, pick cotton-so " there's an end on'! " Thanks to Mr Brookes and his friends, many who were inclined to try South Sea Islanders now hung buck, fearful of some disagreeables of others which might be easily caused by outside malicious or thoughtless moddlora If Mr Brooks s and his party would show half the London money for the poor white pioneer (in the days of cash, a customer, too) that they exhibit for the colored laborer, loss nonsense would be written on this subject. It is to be hoped that the attention of the Government Engineer will be drawn to the present state of the Gympie road near here is a quarter of a mile (nearly) of dismal swamp, which, of late, has been a perfect slough of despond, and this within five miles of the ferry A raised road across it need not cost much, and could be easily and quickly made. It is false economy to neglect all means of ready communication in a well settled district, indeed), it is well known that a district often attains importance through having facilities for transit. This leads me to remark on the urgent need of a bridge across the Mary, at or near the Prince's ferry It is not only the road to the gold fields, but also to nearly thirty miles of farms Nearly the whole of the product is now wearily dragged down the river in small boats, for the expense of and inconvenience, not to say danger, of the present mode of crossing the river effectually prevent farmers from investing in drays I do not hesitate to say that the increased sale of lands, of which there are thousands of acres cultivable, would go a great way towards the principal, and I am sure that the tolls, if on a reasonably liberal scale, would after the first year cover the interest I remember an iron bridge being built across a wider and more rapid river than the Mary for £20,000, and, judging by that one, I should think £15,000, or perhaps loss, should give us a first class bridge. Whilst most averse to increasing the burdens of our already over taxed community, I look upon such necessary works as a means to an end, as it means of cheapening the cost of production, carriage being a very serious item, tend to increase production, and induces more to become, producers.
