With a.charming wife .and. ope pretty little daughter, living the pleaSan tj easy life of a wealthy c.>nntry gentleman, was not tobè wondered that his sudden and unaccountable disappearance; bad caused some commotion amongst his friends and acquaintances. For nearly month nothing had been heard of him; not a trace of his whereabouts, dead oj* alive discovered ; and not a ghost of a reason known for his thus absenting himself from his family. He had ïun up to Liondon for two or three " days on business, and the last, night of his àtay he had written his wife tosay that he wai.leaving by noon train-next day, And would-be home the same evening. The boots of the hotel where he had stayed toot his pbrïfriaateàu to the station and saw him off by the 12 o'clock express ; the ràiiway guard spoke to him a Rugby ; and a Manchester gentleman, Mr Fielden, saw him walking along the platform at Crewe, apparently alone, and this was. the last definite news received regarding him. Up to the time of leaving London he was in the best of health and spirits, he was a very tempeiate. mas, of a cheerful, sanguine -disposition—a most unlikely subject to develop suicidal tendencies.^ The theory of murder atid robbery -was scarcely tenable^ as he was tall, powerfully built, very active, and muscular, and not in the habit"of canning many valuables about with him. He bad no known euemy in the world, nor h'id he any associates < r friends npon whose character, could rest the shadow of a doubt. A heavy, reward and a minote description failed to elicit the slightest additional information to that already known, and his disappearance was utterly incomprehensible. W«ek after week passed -away* and multiplied into months;". and still no news came of the lest Paul Duncan. . A skilled London detective followed op and unravelled -one sipposed iplue after another ; friends travelled' to different parts of the conutrjr toviewthe bodies of unknown unfortunates cast by restless tid^s, or found la lonely lakes or rivers, w&b; a view to identification ; .the Continental police were communicated with, but to ltd purpose, and gradually Draftshire, as well as the re n t of the country, ceased to talk or even think ' much about the matter. Bat there. was one whose memory did not grow weaker, whose heart did not lose all hope, whose strong will and great love kept her ever watchful, even energetic, in the vain search for some thread by which to unravel the dreadful secret -of Paul Duncan's disappearance, and that was his wife. Ellen Duncan was not at first sight a strikingly handsome woman ; she was too little to be hamlsome, being barely five feet high ; nor was she what ieould be called pretty, for there was too mnch firmness about her features for snch nn vijective to correctly apply to her ; but that • she was good- looking could nat be denied. Her complexion was clear and healthy, her small figure peifect in its lines and curves, and her *yes large and liquid. It was in tier eyes, perhaps* that lier chief attraction lay. In watching them the r.*st of tho features weie forgotten, and critical analysis disarmed. They were brows in color, but whether light or dark br.iwn it would be difficult to say, they changed so with lier mood and attitude.

Drag herself away from v the scenes of tlie happièst years of her life she would fibtj. except for sliart intervals; and * within, twelve months of the mysterious disappearance of Paul Duncan, his wife or \Tido^, none knew which, had settled (iown :at 0!msfoldto a quiet, monotonous country Qife, receiving no company, and but few çaïtersj. devoting', herself to the care educ^tipn of Iierlittle daughter, and to ran inward brooding over lier own great^ sorrow.- The young men of the oountry said what a pity it was thst suijh a jolly little Wvman like Sirs Duncan should bury herself so completely as she I had di$e. ; aU .yery well for. a time, oî I Course, : .to'be^quièt and keep out of I socieiy end all that sort of thing, but! she -Wite as much lost toher iriends as was h'ér.husbànd. The subject of such co.mmen.te, even if awàre of theoi, wbich it is doubtful she was, remained in her 1 voluntary seclusion with a strictness I wh ch only .seemed to increase with time. She was met out walking or driving less ,and less frequently, until by most her existence was almost forgotten, and, if I recalled, pit was only in the shape of an ] iteqi i .of .interestinginformation to strangers.in the vicinity of Elmsfold, to whom the story was retailed with the various additional details which always attach themselves to, and get themselves inc irporated with, such histories in rural districts. With Mabel it was somewhat different; she was - constantly seen riding about, the lanes', attended by a groom, and many were the expressions .of admiration and] pleasure made u«e of by such as'.met her. She wàs healthy and happy, fond of the open' air, of horses, and digs, and birds connected with outdoor life. Of children of her own age she saw bgt few, and of young t companions she had none. Her , - « - * , , mother, shrinking from leaving her own seclusion, argued with herseif that it would be quite soon enough for tlîe child to make friends outside her home circle "when she was three or .four years older. It-'was a quiet life the mother and daughter led ; to the latter a very happy one, for she was too young at the time of her fathers disappearance for the event to mike any lasting impression on her, mind. To Airs Duncan, however, the.life was different ; quiet it was, peacefuiito all appearance also ; but the lapse of time, though it bad deadened the sharp pain of the earlier months of trial, had not stifled the great longing for news, or bad ; that ever present hope "that the lost one might yet return, that s'itne - explanation of her husband's absence wonid:still be forthcoming.
