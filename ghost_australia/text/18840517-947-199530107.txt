iyiCTOEIA INSTITtJTI! ' '], Buddhism in Relatiok to Christianity;; . At the large meetingMield in February, by the Victoria (Philosophical) Institute; 7i'fAdelphi Terrace;' London, a paper was read by the Kev. E. C. Collins, M; A/, -on Buddhism in relation 'to Cliristiamtyi Referring to the parallels between' the peri sons and ^characters' of Buddha and. Jesus Christ, he said: — Take, as a 'prominent instance, the birth .: stories. '? I needf not here give details, ?wMchare to !be found in any modern work on 'Buddhism. The'sup posed miraculous conception ; the'bringiiig down of Buddha from the Tusita heaven; the Devas aeKnowledgirighis supremacy; ' the presentation in the iTemple^'when the images of Indra ! and .'other gods -threw themselves at his '? feet ; -the ; ltemptatioh''by Mara— which legdnds are embellishedl'.by the modernwriter.I have: already quoted, under such phrases as ,:' Conceived by' the Holy Ghost/' '?'? Born of the Virgin' Mary/^ 'Song i of the -Heavenly ^host,-''1'' Pre- sentation, 'in ''the ? 'Temple' i 'and' terirptai tion in ?th'e wilderness '—none of these are found in1 the ''earlyi Pali texts. ' -The simple story of ancient -Buddhism is that an r, ascetic, whose family, name, was Gautama, ' prejiched Y, a , new doctrine of human suffering, and a new way of de liverance from it. There , is no thought in the early Buddhism, of which we read in the Pali texts, of deliverance, at the hands of a god; but.' the man Gautama Buddha stands alone in his striving after the true emancipation from sorrow and ignorance. The accounts of his descending from Heaven, and being conceived in the world of men,, when a preternatural light shone, over, the -.'worlds, the blind received sight, the, dumb sang, the lame danced, the sickwerV. cured, together ,^ith all such embellishments, are certainly added -by la^er. hands,;, and. if .here .we i l'ecognise some rather; remarkable likenesses in thought or expression; io,^Kings familiar to us in our Bibles i we, neeU not be asj»nished- when. we reijfec.t how j. great!. t must -have. ,been iKe^y ', .inflriep,ce^ j.'.'.^s ,-? .I'^Vjhave' before fiuitedi ,' o|,[rthe.[ Chroisitian', story, , in India in the 'eai'ly centuries of the Chris tian era', 'and; porhaps) long subsequently.
