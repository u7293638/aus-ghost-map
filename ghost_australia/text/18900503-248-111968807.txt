Ah, love 1 do you know meadow sweet f ; Does some pale ghost of passion fleet :v • Adown this dreary lapse of years,. So void ot lbre,;so fiill'of fears ?' Some ancient, far off echo greet' - - The once loved name of rucaclqw tweet f An Ingenious Swindle".—A .«wind)«' recently detected is conducted as followii'A cheque, s&y; for ten guineas,is obtained from a depositor nt a bank, and a blank cheque exactly like the filled-in cheque is secured. Tlie two cheques are laid one upon the other so vthat"' the edges' are exactly evehr Both cheques are;then torn irregularly across, and in such a way that the signature on the •filled cheque appears on one piece and the amount and name of the payee on the other, - The chequcs haying been held together while "/eing torn, of course one piece of the blank cheque will exactly fit the other piece of the filled cheque. The swindler then fill* in one piece of the blank cheque with the name of the payee and the amount to suit himself, say one thousand pounds, takes it.withVthe piece of genuine cheque containing the sig nature of the bank, and explains that.the cheque was accidentally torn.
