LOCAL INTELLIGENCE. A Ghost in Beechworth.—Who has heard of the ghost—a down right veritable ghost to be so conjured up by Dr Slater? Descriptions have lately appeared Id the Melbourne papers of a metropolitan ghost, and it appears the Deputation went to see it. Cr Kerferd was not half so frightened apparently at the apparition, as he was at Mr Sullivan, for while the latter gentleman was able to take Cr Kerferd's measure. Cr Kerferd was able take the measure of the ghost, and as we were facetiously informed, brought it to Tadmor in a carpet bag. At all events, be that as ii may, Dr Slater has not only repro duced this ghost, but is going to do so publicly in a melodrama, written for the propose, in which the ghost will be the principal character, in order. to. give our readers some idea of these spiritual manifestations, we clip the following from the London 'Spectator.'— 'Modern researches in spiritualism have led to one practical result—the discovery of a ghost. Not of an ordinary old fashioned ghost, appearing in the midnight hour to people with a weak digestion, haunting graveyards and old country mansions, and inspiring romance-writers into the mischief of three-volume-novels; but of a Well- , behaved, steady, regular, and respect- able ghost, going through a prescribed round of duties, punctual to the minute ——a patient ghost, in fact. This admir- able ghost is the offspring of two fathers, of a learned member of the Society of Civil Engineers Mr Henry Ducks, and of Professor Pepper, of the Polytechnic To Mr Ducks belongs the honor of having invented him; or, as the disciples of Hegel would express it, evolved him from out of the depths of his own consciousness and Professor Pepper has the merit of having improved him considerably, fitting him for the inter course of mundane society, and even educating him tor the stage. After having bowed to the Polytechnic Institution, he some weeks ago made hit debut "upon the boards of the Britannia Theatre, in a new and highly original drama, entitled 'The Widow and Orphan—Faith,Hope, and Charity.' in which piece tie continues to present himself nightly to crowded audience's with the greatest imaginable success. , . . Presently, the vast house sinks into obscurity, only a few flicker- ing gas jets being left here and there to create a faint twilight. Once again Sir Gilbert-Northlaw steps upon he stage, closely followed by a skeleton. The apparition is certainly striking. It gradually and almost imperceptibly evolves itself out of the air, and after various movements vanishes with 'the rapidity of a flash of lightning. A second lime it comes and goes as before, and immediately after appears a female form, the exact counterpart of Faith the widow. Close as the eye may watch the operation of the whole proceding; it is impossible to detect the source of the fine optical, delusion. There the figure certainly stands, walks, and talks; but disappears as instantaneously as if fashioned out of the mere air. On the second appear ance of widow• Faith, or- rather widow Faith's ghost,Sir Gilbert Northlaw takes courage, and, rising from his seat attacks her with theue sword. . But, the sharp steel, aimed at a walking and sneaking human figure, meets no resist ance but the empty air, and the would: be. murderer is mocked by a loud sardonic ha, ha, ha ! This is the crisis of the spectacle.- When the baronet a making desperate efforts to grasp the widow, the spectre vanishes in the twinkling of an eye, leaving the echo of a mocking voice resounding from afar. Whatever the means by which ibis curious scene is effected, it is undoubt edly a most clever and wonderful striking bit of stage effect. Those in want of a new sensation can do nothing better at the present moment than pay a visit to the Britannia Theatre and to Ratbs.-—The gatlieret'of ;tlio!»e im- ( vostg^asveb^^eu^^b^t'ctir-uf.. vigitg 1 throughout the municipn i» givi'yr. timelv warning to 7Aca1<9'?»ni r^tfipAvers,.. ."Sffiee^tTiifir7^#:ifitiWatr-nfaas- : the v'ratrtjS?.y crs,' i t hasT hpeora'P'a' sv;.. aer-rabnr l»te the town'- without h*viv»£ pn'<,-tf notices bearinfc ' the 'sign vii;* <-f -thr town c«erk politely r^qnesti'-^'ijt'fMulierf - to nsinrnrip up thrust before your fves-' We hope those, .^ooumenis will so fas 'affect '.those tpc iving tiem, as to., save the .Council tl»e troupe of u nfi .invitation of a more unjth-swot I ohft^oer.
