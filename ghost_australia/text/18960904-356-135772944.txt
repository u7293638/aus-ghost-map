IS 'YPHOID PREVENTABLE? Typhoid, the Hosepitfl lays down, is a disease of bacilli, typhoid bhoilli; and the baoilli we find in human exorement, and in drinking water fouled by such exorement. It is probable that no man or woman ever takes typbhoid except by swallowing some I typhoid bacilli. They may be swellowed, as we have said, in dritlning vater, or they may be flying about in the air in the neighbour hood of typhoid exorement, and may be swallowed with mouthfuls of air. What then is the first and last commandment of typhoid prevention ? " Cleanliness; personal and publio oleanliness." It is allthere. If we keep ourselves clean; if we keep our drinking water clean; if we keep our closets and our drains, our kitchens, soulldties, gardens, streets, and towns entirely olean, typhoid will be praotioally as great a stranger to most of us as is the ghost of King Solo mon or the shade of the extinot Deinothe rium.
