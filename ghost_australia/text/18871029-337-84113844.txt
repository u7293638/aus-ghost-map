Oh, the breezes blow, And the white yachts go Far out o'er the heaving sea; And I rise and sink Till I really think It will be the death of me. Oh, my breath comes quick, I am deathly sick, And as pale as a Chinese ghost: Ah! that billowy swell, As the steam-tug fell, Made me long for death itself. While the swift yachts fly I heave-a sigh, And I long-hoyr I long !-for home; And I gaze at the beach Far out of reach And I wish that 1 hadn't come.
