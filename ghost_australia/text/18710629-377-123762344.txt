THE IPSWICII ELECITON. To the Editor of the Queenrland flmee. Sm,-Two well- known commercial gentlemen, hav ing a private pique against one of the Ipswich Bunch, have been going the rounds of the town asking the public to sign a requisition to Mr. BIolrsonl-who, it is said, will stand also in the Govsernmentterest--and have met with some sucess so far as procuring sig natures is concerned; but many of those who signed were under the impression when signing that one of the late members did not intend again to offer himself for election, otherwisn they would not have subscribed their names to the document. The commercial gentlemen commenced their cam paign at break of day on the morning of Tuesday, and so caught many "on the hop," as the saying is, who now regret ever having attached their names to the precious document. I hope Mr. Robinson will eon eider this before he gives an answer to the requsition ists; and I am quite sure hlie will also consider that, by his coming forward at this time, he will imperil the best interests of the town, for he knows well that there are traitors only waiting to finBd a spllit in our ranks so that they can announce themselves as clndi dates, being aware that they have not the ghost of a chance while there is unity.
