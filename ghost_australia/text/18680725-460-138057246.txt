Ee madi ona .peechtfrom ft email r&ised; booth that was called ft platform, aadthat #a8.fcU »h« hB was called upoD to'do. Mr. Orating oitde a speech > in proposing him, and Mr. SmaUrtbs kntther'. in seconding him j ' and then were all tlw speeches that were .required, The tiling,, seemed, to be JO very easy that he was after* j 'wards almost offended when'he was.told that tha bill for so insignificant a piece of work cameto £247 13s. 9d. He bad soen no ooca sion for spending even the odd fortj^wvan pounds. But then he was tnemberfor Lough* ton ; and as he passed the eveningalone at.', tbeinn, having dined in'company with Muni. Orating, Smallribs, and sundry other influen tial elector#, he began to reflect that, titer aU» t was not so very great a thing to be, a mem- ; her of Parliament. It almost seemed that that which had come to him eo -easily could not be of much value. On the following day he went to the and was there when (he Earl arrived. They two were alone together, and the Sari waa very bind to him. ?" So you had no opponent after all," said the great man of LoDgbtw, with a slight smile. " Not the ghost of another candidate." " I did not think there would be. They have tried it once or twice and hare alwaya failed. There are only one or two in the pV'T who like to go one way just because their neighbours go the other. But, in truth, then is no conservative feeling in the place!" P,hineas, although he was at the present , moment the member for I/oughton himself, coujd not but enjoy the joke of this. . Could there be any liberal feeling, in such a place, or, indeed, any political feeling whatsoever ? .Would not Messrs. Grating and Sm&llriba; have done just the same had it happened that Lord Brentford had been a Toiy peer ? " The/ all eeemed to be very obliging," said Pfaineas, in answer to the Earl. " YeB, they are. There isn't a bouse in the town, you know, let for longer than seven - years, and most of them merely from year to year. And, do you know, I haven't a farmer on the property with a lease,--not one; and they don't want leases. They know they're safe. . But I do like the . people round me to be of the same way of thinking as myself- about politics." . , On the second day after dinner,-the hut evening of Finn's vigil to fiaulaby,-the Barl fell suddenly into confidential conversation about his daughter and hu son, and about Violet Effingham. So sudden, indeed, and so / confidential was the conversation, that Phineaa was almoBt silenced for awhile, A wprd or two had been said about Loughlinter, pf f the beauty of the place and of the vastaess of t$w property. «'I am almpBt afraid," saitJ Lord Brentford, " that Laura is not happy there.** X hope she is," said Phineas. . " He is so hard and dry, and what j call exacting. That is just the word for it. fTow Lauta has never been used to that With me she always had her own way in everything^ and, I always found her fit to have it. I do not understand why her husband should treat her differently.T " Perhaps it is the temper of the man.** " Temper, y es; but what 'a had prospect is that for her! And she,-too, .has a. temper and so he will find if he tries her too far. loan* not stand Loughlinter. I told Laura so fairly. It is one of those houses in which a man cannot call his hours his own. I told Laura that I could not undertake to remain there for above a day or two." " It is very sad," said Phineas. " Yes, indeed; it iB sad for her, poor girl; and very sad for me too. I have no one else but Laura,-literally no one; and now I am divided from her i It seems that she has beat taken as much away from me as though her husband lived in China. I have lost both now!" " I hope not, my Lord." " I say I have. As to Chiltern, I can per* ceive that he becomes more and more in different to' me every clay. He thinks of .ma only as a man in his way who most die "Amp day and may die soon." (< You wrong him, Lord Brentford." " I do not wrong him at all. Why has ha . atwwered every ofter I have made with eo touch insolence as to make it impossible for ine to put myself into further communion with him?" "He thinks that you have wronged him." " " Teabecause I have been unable to shut mj eyes to his mode of living. I was to go on paying hjje debts, and taking no otyiee notice whatsoever of his oonduot!" "Ido not think he is in debt now." "Because liis sister the other d%y eve^i .Btilling of her fortune in paying them . She gave him £40,000! Do you thiwy the would have married Kennedy but for that f I don't. I oouldnot prevent her.
