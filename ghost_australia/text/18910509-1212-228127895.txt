' How grnrupy you are, jLizzie,' laughed she, letting her lead hbr away, using one of the fev slang wordfj ^he had picked up in her childish intercourse with the servants. ! ' I need to be 'grumpy], dear, when I 3 you treading on powder-mines,' said the faithful naid, as she arrayed her in her clean white gown and dry stockings aud slippers. What nonsense ! When all that I have done is to be barel^ civil to an artist who is painting my picture, whom I chanced to meet in my uwil garde ; you know it was a chance meeting.' Yes, <ie.ar t but 'twasnx being barelycivil to give htm a rose to wjear, and smile at him as you smiled.' ! ' And'yet 'twas but the girl all over— they take to itj as ducks take to water, be they rich pr poor !' So sbliloquiked Lizzie, after her young mistress hid gone down to jbin her father at the brcakfabt-table. _ Ay, and this was the beginning of the tangle—and tfmgle it was ; for what says the'poet : j Oh, what i tangled web we weave, ' When first we venture to deceive. And Janetj was deceiving her father, holding these (stolen interviews with this artist, whom [know one knew, no one favoured among the servant^, coming and going about (the old place' wit his dark, handsome, southern face, graceful manners, as .poor sjs a church mouse ; as one and another of jthese pronounced him to be no gentleman, though with the easy bearing of one. j J ..^"ell, he spjred and he reaped ; he wové"--4he net, and was, j;anght in the meshes his own hands had woven. jWihy did.he haunt the biaimnce after that eventful morning ; ojr, rather, after the morning when events began to shape themselves, if by chance the beautiful young heiress might be there—might be sitting on ithe ivy-covered steps—she and mongrel Jack ? : It came to be recognised thing between the two, for ' jthem to mfeet for k bri«*f every evening after dinner, when homas Wildering was pitting oyer his ftine in the stately old dinning-room. It cime to tfe a! settled thing that' Janet should steal out into the garden, or stand on the garde 1-steps, to [hold a golden tryst with her lov'e>^aTid then back to the drawing-room to sing t^ her father his favourite songs. j One evening, as Janet; stood on the gardenste^s holding, her] brief parlance witli Algernon Ford, some one surely came through the covered way and entered.- ihe,g*rd£p,>viirily/Jmakingiiis way, a noisiess Bhadjow, into elery sheltering shade as it fell, and a woman crept from" gomewliere towards him, till both seemed lost in the frowning darikness under the wall. | 1 Whom could it be ? A servant from the house creeping out to meet her lover, though on forbidden grouhd, as it were— that in her liwn especial, garden, Jlanet thought ; aijd with a guilty undefined fear, bajle, Mr. .

But there, on the :opmoet st'U, she met Lizzie, panting, and :ooking wi>it* and scared in the pale moonlight. She uttered a lo cr| at meeting her mistress thus.; 4 Lizzie, what is it ?

The confusing revelation came to !her standing by her weeping maid. : ; i [That evening and to-;morrow evening she was on the ivy-coveried steps, a coy sweet maiden, with her id ream began. CHAPTER! I V. ît was [bliss to be there—to sit upon topmost jstep, Algernon Ford lounging agjainst the iron balustrade, whispering ijeet nothings into her ears. (Sweet nothings ! Xav.j What wa 1 - he saying ? I wish I had never seen vou, Miss Wjildering, for I love vou[' ' No, no, no !' What else could she saV to this sudden avowal ? [ f Yes ; despise me shrink from me if yon will, I, the mean coward, who am fain to [reckon and count upon the price of the picture I am painting for you the worth of the pretty diamond bauble you always wejir.' There was a ring of truth and reality in his words as they, softly spoken as they were, thrilled on the moonlit air. And this to Thomas Wildering's daughter, who must never, never marry beneath her ; and she loved him—this rash man speaking—loved him, though she may never, never confess it. A.11 the long golden summer day she had be^n musing of it, and while sitting in the old gallery, as he painted her, hei sweet, sweet dream seemed to fade into a arable nothing. Her father that morning had said to her., while sitting at breakfast, as if half dimming her precious miserable secret : ' My child, yon are fast nearing seventeen ; you must now think of going out into the world to see and|to be seen. My little Janet must marry well ; she is worthy to queen it among the titled ladies of fashion ; nothing but a title for my daughter, would induce me to part with her.' , < And jf not, father—if I loved no titled one?' she had faltered, thrilling as with a great longing. 'There must be. no 4 if ïiots," had been the answer. ' I could never give my child to inn inferior ; scarcely to her equal.' And here wa? Algernon Ford telling her of his love, she hearkening, giving hith love for love, though it was all unspoken and evfr must be so. Like a frightened child she stood there, frightened !at what her heart was .spying, at what her own double dealing had wrought. Will y had she deceived her father ; disobeyed hint, sunning hersell like a silly moth around a caudle,in that which must bring its own misery ? T|ie scorching o lier poorlittle wings was beginning already and she knew not the half of what was coming. 1 Don't, Mr. Ford : y oust never, never say that again.' So she pleaded with hint, as igainst the whisperings of her fond foolish heart. ' No, love ; I know th • linsuperalile b irspicitlile l mus: rier between us. How<U be :in your eyes !' • Oh,no, not that !' Soft us the wing of : dove canie the words. 4 Bless you for that, il Wildering, and now, were we as equals ?' Ay, why would he selfishly press her so sorelv ? 4 We are equals : only you must never, never speaK to me like that again,' cannas in sweet protest. 'Janet ! Mr. Fu.d !' Proud Thomas Wildcriiig spoke. H:> tall commanding figure stood behind them iu the dim light of the dojjrway, his white Step beneath rolled daughter but him. 4 What means this scene ? Janet, my chîld,'go in ; and you, sir! artist, to your own quarters, and to-morrow's sitting shall be your last.' So lu! spoke, standing aside to let poor trembling Janet puss him by. ' Father, don't—don't blauie anybody," she pleaded and led away. . • Turn me from vour house as a dastard if you will, Mr. Wilderiug; but spare your daughter all blame,' urgj-d the artist humbly. ' Have vou spared her from meriting blame?' ' i .How sternly angry • ma s \v; •riur could lie. The voting man wn it. 'Hast no 1 word, cnwaird ?' was tin scornful epiestion whi ;ti stnote upon tin stillness. ' I" could plead but one ejxeuse, to which vou would not hearken, Air. Wilderiug.
