-HAMLET RECREATED. And the man that did it t as Beerbohl Tree, the m?ost iimpersonal. and versatile of .all our actors. ltamlet, thi iunspakable Dane, hasor late years been done to death by ambitious artists who successively have replied to the "To be" with "not to be." The sight of Wilson Barrett disporting his 'cumbrous length on the stets of the throne, and soliloquising before a' Princess s audience was not one to forget easily. Poor b1ested Dane, he has indeed suffered the "slings atid arrows of outrageons"-actors. But Mr. Beerbohm Tree has bid the dead bones live, and the manes of Shakespeare are apneased. There was a spleudid tirst night audience in the Haymarket on the Thursday the plin opened. lMr. Tree grasps the subtlety of the rdie admirably. Hamlet's underlying love for Ophelia is beautifullt accentuated by tone and glance. The house wvas moved en masse at the end of the second act, when bending over his tablets by the red fire, Hamlet cries, "The play's the thing, wherein I'll catch the conscience of the king." In the fifth act the churchyard is a spring parterre of blooms, a new rendering, and thither Hamlet returns to Ophelia's grave. The fencing scene with Laertes is a magnificent piece of intellectual grasp, shown in the actor's expression and acting when he looks Laertes in the eye and reads his treachery. Then a.ain, Mr. Tree's subtlety shows its power. Mrs. Tree makes a charming Ophelia, delicately as well as strongly given. Mr. Arthur Dacre, as Horatio, also secured a triumph, and Mr. Fernandez, as Ghost, and Mr. Fred Terry as Laertes were generally successful. Shakespeare this season at the Haymarket will not spell ruin.
