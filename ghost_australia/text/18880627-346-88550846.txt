THE SUNDAY QUESTION. The Lower House of Convocation (says " Truth") has thought'it necessary to add its cackle to tlte recent maunderings of the bishops on the Sunday question. Archdeacon Burney acted as the spokesmau of the flock, and told a harrowing tale of Sabbath desecration in his own riverside' parish— He remembered the time (he observed) when -any one who deiired to go out boating would slink down some by-street, and do all lie could to avoid being seen but now they seemed to liave no sense of sliame, or no idea that they were breaking the Lord's day. So we arc going on step by step towards the time when " the people" will be deprived of the " priceless boon," etc. Does it never occur to this reverend gentleman that the people are the best judges of the value of the " priceless boon?" Or can he suggest the ghost of a reason why a man should slink down a by-street on his way to the river on Sunday? Not he. All that he and the rest of their reverences can do is to hold up their hands like a party of ecclesias tical Mrs Grundys, and exclaim" Dear ine, how shocking'." But it isn't only the boating men. The evil lias spread to the very apex of society. Hero is the Rev. Jacob Primmer (auspicious name!) giving voice at Dunfermline to the "great pain" •which her Majesty has caused to many of her Protestant subjects by leaving Florence on the Sabbath, and—woe the day-- driving to the station " through dense and cheering crowds of Papists," instead of slinking down a by-street, as 110 doubt both the Kev. Primmer and the Rev. Burney would have her do. All this comes —so, at least, I gather from the Protestant Primmer—of " the Queen's running after the EriesU of anti-Christ."' I knew that there had een high-jinks at Florence, but I had no idea it ' had been ao bad as thir. Fancy Queen Yieto- ia running through the streets of Florence after the priests of anti-Christ?
