Centennial Magazine. The August number — whnh is also the first numberof the second volume of the 'Centennial Magazine,' is well in keeping with the reputa tion this publication is earning for itself. The subjects dealt with inthoissuo are varied, rang ing from a somewhat heavy artiole on ' Modern Ghosts,' to an interesting description of the Jadao-gnri or Indian jugglers, and some reminis cences culled from a freBhwater log. ' The status ot literature in New aouth Wales is a shaft aimed at Sir Henry Forkes's recent oftor of £300 anl £160 for a history of Australia, the prizes being open to competition, and the New South Wales Government are oorreoted in curt, but by no means too strong language for their parsimonious offer. The illus rations are all very good, the frontiaopioce, ' The Acolyte' especially. The ' Centennial' is certainly one of tho best magazines yet publiaUsl in the colonies and should receive full ai\preoiation and support of the reading publio.
