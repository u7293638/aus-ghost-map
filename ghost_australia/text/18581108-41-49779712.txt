These suras, with £112,000 defined as 'Schedule* D, 18 and 19 Vic, cap. 55,' £9,000; University of Melbourne and smaller sums for Pensions, Commissioners of Audit, and Mining Board?, amount altogether to £422,645 — an aggregate of close upon one eighth of the entire estimated revenue for the year. Leaving out of calculation special ap propriations, the amount of which for the year 1858 is not included in the document before us, we firfd the general expenditure for the two years to stand as follows : — ... 1858. 1859. Houses of Legislature ? £17,833 £16,111 Chief Secretary ? 721,170 76i,673 Attorney-General ? ... 124.621 133,225 Treasurer .., ? 4iO,05l 421.537 Board of Land and Works ... 1,417,891 1,645,923 Commissioner of Trade and Cus toms ? - ... 167.B75 178.315 Postmaster-General ? 141,936 201,374 Commissioners of Audit ... f-,830 5.830 Total ? 3,021,19) 3,289,893 The estimated expenditure for 1859 is there fore £248,703, or in round numbers a quarter of a million, in advance of the expenditure of the year 1858. We may glance en passant at the departments in which the increase has taken place. In that-of the Chief Secretary there is an enlargement of expenditure to the extent of £40,408, and this notwithstanding that in Registration there appears a reduction of £4,543, in Penal Establishments of £6,000 and in Gold-Fields of £3,400. The principal' items of increased outlay are, Electoral, £25,000; Education, £10,000 ; Police, £11,211. In the Attorney-General's Department there is an in crease of £8,640, being for the Supreme Court, £5,520; Police Magistrates, £2,533 ; Clerks of County Courts, &c.;, £2,514. In the Trea surer's Department there is. a total increase of £4,486 ; but several reductions appear, as for instance, Military, £11,000 ; Pounds, £3,500; and Miscellaneous, £26,009. The items which go to form an increase on the whole are, De fences, £25,000; Government Printing addi tional, £5,882 ; Charities, ditto, £7,850 ; Mu nicipalities, ditto, £4,500. In the Board of Land and Works there i3 a total increase of £127,929, the principal items forming it being, Survey, Sale, and Managemantof Public Lands, additional, £84,870 ; and Railways, additioual, £63,062. A reduction appears of £12,535 in Public Works. In the Commissioner of Trade and Customs Department there is a total in crease of £10,640, the advance being prin cipally Lighthouses, Harbour Lights, and Light-vessels, £6,559 ; Customs, £3,225 ; and Distilleries, £1,200. In the Postmaster- Gene- ral's Department there is a total increase of £58,408, of which additional Mail Service contributes £46,000; Electric Telegraph, £7,261, and Post-Office, £6,147. TIih e*T.ima.rc(l cast of Police for thfl reap 1859 being £322,548, and the population for that year being put at 500,000, which probably svill be its amount, gives 12s. 10|d., for each in. iividual of the community. The proportionate sost in South Australia is 6s. 2tl., or not quite tialf — a fact that tells in favour of this colony as to the effectiveness of our police, or the economy af that branch of the public service, or the comparative peaceableness and good order of society amongst us. Gaols and penal estab lishments are to cost Victoria over £100,000 for the year. Education £125,000, or 4s. per head for the whole of the community ; or, com puting the educatable portion of of it at 100,000, £1 5s. per head. For scientific objects the sum of £37,918 13 set down. This expenditure provides for a Board of Science, £1,400 ; Geological Survey, £6,633 ; Magnetic Survey, £1,750 ; Botanic and Zoological Gardens, £11,460 ; Museum and Mining Department, £2,040; Experimental Farm, £2,065. The following grants also are included : — Botanic Garden, Geelong, £2,000 ; Philosophic Insti tute, for building purposes, £2,000 ; Agricul tural Societies, in aid of, £6,000 ; compiling Agricultural Statistics, £2,000; maintenance of deserted children, £2,000; Queen's Plate, £200. Bat haw these hut come under the head ' Scientific' i» difficult to decide. The Supremo Court, County Courts, and Clerks to same are to cost the colony a trifle over £90,000. Police Magistrates and Coroners £35,520, Under the Treasurer's Department the Treasury is to absorb £33,430 ; the Govern ment Printer, £45,296; Military, £26,897; Volunteer Force, £6,177 ; Charities, £77,400 viz., £20,000 for building, and £57,400 for maintenance — the Institutions assisted being chiefly Hospitals and Benevolent and Orphan Asylums ; Municipalities, £145,000. Uader the Board of Laud and Works Department are, Survey, Sale, and Management of Public Lands, £200,850; the estimated expense of Contract Surveys being £125,000 ; the Surveyor's Office Branch, £17,000; Field Branch, £27,250 ; and the Land Oceupation Branch, £10,390; Roads and Bridges are to cost £610,805, comprising Commissioner, Staff, &c.;, £24,000 ; District Road Boards, £100,000 ; Maintenance of Roads, £152,148 ; other large sums ranging from £12,000 up to £49,000 for various Districts. Public Works are esti mated at £616,594. Among the items com nogin? this sum are. for comDletinff Public UUices, aiiu,iwu; new uenerai roBt-umce, £30,000; new Lunatic Asylum, £20,000; Workshops, Sheds, &c;, £7,000; Wharfs, Jetties, and Harbours, £28,800 ; Marine and RiverWorks (twoSteamDredges on the Geelong Bar, oae in the Yarra), £47,480 ; erecting Police Buildings through the colony £65,000 ; for completing Gaols through the colony, £80,000 for Penal Establishments, new Panopticon, &c.;, £50,000 1 Court-Houses, £23,000; new Barracks at Melbourne, £15,000 ; Lighthouses, £19,600; Electric Telegraphs, ^£39,j§00. The sum for Railways, £113,674, is for superin tending and working them and not for con struction. Under the Commissioner of Trade and Cus toms Department, we find that Customs cost in the collecting £67,619; the total sum to be collected being £1,777,000. To Female Immi gration £50,000 is to be devoted. Tinder the Postmaster-General's Department we find an expenditure of £58,950 for Post* Office expenses, and £113,000 for Mail Service, making £171,950 against £97,030 of estimated !evenue. Of the £113,000 the large item of £40,000 is for Steam Postal Communication. Electric Telegraphs are to cost £27,424 for the year, of which £1,000 only is for the opening of new lines. . Among all these vast sums expended for the advancement of the colony civilly, socially;, and intellectually, which are to place it in rivalry with any other colony, and with many of. the old kingdoms1 of Europe, is the sum of £2,000 to ameliorate the 'unhappy condition of the Aborigines. The Next Mails. — A private telegram in forms us that the Havflah was to leave Mel bourne on Saturday night, and to start again from Adelaido with the mail for England on the 11th. We understand, too, that the Admella and the Burra Burra are advertised to sail hence on the 11th, so that all three steamers will be here at once. This unac countable arrangement may lead to some in convenience if the English mail, which is now due, should arrive in Melbourne within a week of its time. The Havilnh will call at Guiehen Bay, we are informed, on her present trip. Chbistian Unio-\ — We are requested to state that the address to the Bishop, as pub lished in our columns on Thursday last, lies for signature at the following places : — Messrs. Blyth Brothers, and Mr. R. A. Fiveash, Hindley-street, Mr. Mullett, bookseller, Sundle street, and Mr. H.Watson, chemist, North Adelaide. Public Hoixdat. — To-morrow being the Prince of Wales's birthday will be observed as a public holiday by the Government Offices and Banks. Subhabete Telegraph to New Zealand. —We learn from Wellington papers that Mr. McGowan, of Victoria, has reported favourably of a acheme-for connecting New Zeland with these colonies by a submarine telegraph — a work which the Independent believes will pay if the Panama postal line is brought into use. That journal says : — 'Aastralia.it is well known, is determined to have European communication via Panama. Strong as this determination was ttro or three years ago, it is far stronger now that the Indian mail route has proved so unsuccessful. Whea the Panama line shall be opened, New Zealand will bo the first point of call and the last of departure. By means of the electric telegraph the news can bo flashed into Australia a week earlier thin the steamer arrives there, and flashed ont again a week later than the steamer leaves there. To gain this object, the laying down of 1,350 miles of telegraph will be comparatively nothing, and the cost a mere trifle. If the Australian colonies disagree as to the termini, or anj other detail, Melbourno would not hesitate to execute the work herself. With an annual export of gold of upwards of £12,000,000, the cost of doing so— a mere £180.000— would not be looked at for a momeut. These are the considerations which we believe justify us in looking on Mr. McGowau's report as, perhaps, tho most important document that has yet appeared iu connection with New Zealand, and satisfy us that the proposal to-day— lauphed at by many as chimerical will become the fact of no very distant to-morrow.' Featjdpleitt Flotje-Dealebs. — A corres KHident of the Argus, writing from the Cape )f Good Hope, draws attention to another case )f dealing in imitation- flour. He says : — 'If your Adelaide farmers aud merchants will sell ireadstuffs here, recommend them to take care that their ample? are good ; for we were xecently greatly imposed ipon by a shipment which came from Mauritius, and vhieh was sold here for good Adelaide flour, whereas it ras the veriest trash, and bad the appearance of having some from heaven only knows where, and put into other -ags at the Isle of France, and forwarded to this port to ibel your fine Australian produce.' [t is not our farmers and merchants who need }e told to take care that their samples are jood ; but the rascals who vend tho spurious ituff of which the bags only ever came from ;his colony. _ Emigration. — The Sydney Morning Herald Dubltshes the following extract of a letter from F. S. Gray &, Co., shipbrokers, London, dated L6th August :— 'Since our last the emigration has been but sm^] loth to Australia anil the United States and Canada, con sequent upon the unfavourable news received from those jolonics. America and Canada are overdone with labour ind c'oieSy owing to the late panic there causing much' listr&ss; in the large cities. By oar last advices from Australia, which arc good, we hope that there may be i fresh impetus to emigration to that hiithly-favoured land. The free grants of 40 acres of land at New Zealand, md the assisted passages to that port, have caused many persons to proceed thither instead of to Australia. [f apms society could be formed to assist the really deserving hardworking mechanic and labourer, those nho have the bone and sinew, and a proper inuivi lui! chosen for selecting the same, our unions aud crimes would be decreased and cur colonies improved. We do all we can to assist the struggling man here by taking him at ihe lowest possible price — even as low as £13 p;r adult— but, then, this is too high; hundreds we have to refuse, because they may have only£» or £7 each adult— not the shabby genteel Londoner, but the stal wart labourer, who would be a fortune to your landed proprietors. We have certainly had many here who are perfectly helpless, and many have found their waj to Canada, such as shopmen, clerks, &£. Such persons we never aavise to emigrate unless they are willing to tarn their hands to anything, or in fact roughing it. On all occasions we entreat emigrants to make their way into the interior, knowing, from our experience, that in Sydney, Adelaide, and Melbourne there an always t.o many that cling to the city instead of pushing into the in terior. All of our London journals arc teeming with good news, and we expect that the intelligence brought by the late mail, respecting the discovery of another large nugget, will cause the public to be invested with more contiJence, but generally the people have a very indifferent opinion of our golden colonies. There are four ships laid on for Vancouver's Island.' The Territory to the West. — It will be seen by our Sydney telegram that the Legisla ture of New South Wales have negatived the proposition brought forward by tha Govern ment for granting to South Australia the occu pation of the piece of country in the neighbour hood of Fowler's Bay. The motion, as it stood on the paper at the date of our latest file3, is as follows : — ' 1. This Assembly, having duly considered the corres pondence laid before them by command of His Excel lency the Governor-General on the 1st iustant, with re spect to the proposed annexation to the province ol South Australia of a portion of country at present included within the boundaries of New South Wales, are of opinion that there is no valid objection to tho annexa tion to South Australia of the tract of country hereinaf ter described, which is entirely detached from the re mainder ofNew South Wales, and is inaccessible to it by land— that is ts say, the portion of territory lying be titeen the western boundary of South Australia ana the eastern boundary of Western Australia, and bounded eu the north by the continuation westward of tho northern boundary of South Australia. 2. That a copy of the foregoing resolution be presented to His Excellency the Governor-General, with a request that he submit the same to Her Most Gracious Majesty.' An TJnluckt Americas Wab Steamer. — Phe Boston correspondent of the Morning Post lays the following account was sent home by Lieutenant Weed, one of the officers of the United States steamer Arctic, which was sent -ut to stop the outrages by the British West [ndian squidron : — '1 he first day out sbo made three miles an hour, rhe third day oi't she rolled so heavily that a corporal's juaru of^mariiies had to hold the howitzer to keep it from pitching overboard. On the seventh day she broke her engine. On the eighth she sprung a leak. On the ninth, set all bands at the pump.-). Succeeding In stopping tho leak, she crept on toward Havana at ;anal-boat steam — two and a half mlleu an hour. She lid not see the Brtiish fleet— didn't see the Styx— lidn't sea anything, in fact— except when some raer :hantman overtook and sailed pa.st her. Finally, after i voyage of 18 days (more than it takes to go to Europe) ihe reached Havana. Then it wu fjund that tier toilers were out of order, and she s'arted back to Key West for repairs. It is hard y necassary to add that she did not blow the British fleet out of water.' Ttpups Feteb at the Cape.— A correspon dent of the Cape Town Mail in August last writes : — 'Typhus fever or puleic fever has beenragin? in Stellenbosch for some time, and not less than 60 children, between three and sixteen tears of age, besides aiults, live died within the last three months,', and it haa now infested almost every house in the town, and several Farms in this neighbourhood. It is to be hoped that rigorous steps will be taken to disinfect all infected places, by removing the sources of efnavia which caused [he fever, and its great mortality in this otherwise iiealthy locality.' Ibis announcement, as the summer is now joining on, should quicken the activities of Inspectors of Nuisances for the removal of all filth and malaria producing stagnations. Congregational Chapel, Freeman 3TRKET.— On Sunday morning a sermon was delivered by the Rev. Thomas Binuey, at the above chapel, on tke occasion of its eighteenth anniversary; and a collection was made in aid of the fuud for bringing out ministers from England. The chapel was filled with a most atten tive congregation. The rev. preacher took his text from Romans, xiv. 17— 'For the kingdom of God is not meat and drink, but righteousness, and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost.' He glanced at the state of the early Christian Church in Borne, and the heartburnings which had arisen there, as 'in most other places, between Jewish and Gentile converts. He pointed out the way in which St. Paul, who always insisted strongly upon essential points, reprehended any intolerance upon those which were non-essential, and upon which good men might conscientiously differ. This he applied to the ques tion of Church union, which has recently been so much discussed; and placed in the strongest light the duty of Christians of all denominations to carry ont as far as possible the spirit of the apostle's injunctions. In the afternoon the Holy Sacrament was administered by Mr. Binney to the members of seve ral Congregational Churches, aud there were present, as we understand, the whole of the members belonging to that denomination in Adelaide and its vicinity. In the evening the Bev. T. Q. Stow preached from 1st Corin thians, vi. 20—' For ye are bought with a price: there fore glorify God in jour body, and in your spirit, which are God's'' After the sermon the rev. gentleman took Occasion to remark that it was a double anniversary, in asmuch as he had preached his first sermon in South Australia on that day % I years asro; three years before the opening of the Freeman-street Chapel. ' A collection was made for the same object as that in the morning. Miss Emma Stanley's Entebtadtment.— Miss Stanley repeated her monopolylogne, entitled, 'The Seven Ages of Woman.' on Saturday evening, and was warmly applauded in every character in which she appeared. The wonderful quickness with which she made the various changes, and the clever manner In which she enacted each particular character, quite astonished the audience, so much so, that many would scarcely credit the possibility of there only being one person. The change of voice and the many different dialects and languages which she uses is no legs astonishing than her aoting. She concluded with ' Polymelos,' in which Bhe appeared in the characteristic costume of different nations, and singing in the language of each. At the close, she was called out to receive the acknowledgments of the audience, which, although not so large as we should have wished, separated apparently highly gratified and amused with the evening's entertainment Horticultural and Florictjlttjbal SocrsTT.— A Committee meeting of this Society wa» held on^Saturday afternoon at tke Norfolk Arras, Mr. F. C. Davis in the chair. Mr. J. Gray was voted a number of the Committee in the room of the late Mr. Sergeant. The names of several gentlemen were proposed as Jadtres at the ensuing show, and it was resolved that they should be waited on and requested toaet. The follow ing gentlemen were appointed as a Cpmmitte^ of Management for the show, to be held in White's Boom, November 19:— Messrs. F. C, Davis, Greenham, G. Gray. J. Gray, O. Lines, Unwin, and Q. Smith. It wu rewired that the resignation of Mr. Summers as Secre tary be accepted, and that he be written Jo to that effec
