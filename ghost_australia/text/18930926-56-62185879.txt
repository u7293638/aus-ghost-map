ARRIVAL OF THE ACCUSED IN CARCOAR. [By Telegraph.] Carcoar, Monday, 9 p.m. E. H. Glasson, the man arrested at Cowra for the murder of Mr. Phillips and Miss Cavanagh, has just arrived by train from Cowra, under a strong escort of police. He presented a most awful ap pearance as he stepped oft the train, his eyes bursting out of his head, his face pale as a ghost, with mouth wide open and gasping again. The crowd around the station numbered about 300, but although moved by intense excitement they behaved very well. The accused was led from the station on foot to the gaol, followed by the crowd. It was a sight that will not readily be forgotten. The clothes and mask the murderer wore at the time of the tragedy have been discovered, also the saddle and bridle.
