'THE RE-ENSLAVEMENT OF CHRISTENDOM.' Under the above title and in the North Adelaide Congregational Church, on Sunday evening, the Rev. Dr. Jefferis gave a reply to the recent speeches of Prior Vaughan and Cardinal Moran on the subject of the reunion of the churches. After speaking generally of attempts made to accomplish the reunion of Christendom, Dr. Jefferis went on to say : — The Pope proposes the reunion of Christen dom. 1 have carefully considered the ;| terms propounded, and I say the Pope m ^ requires the re-enslavement of Christendom. ' ;,\? When free men unite it is to respect each ^ other's opinions, to offer honorable com- ?/; promise, to join as far as may be on equal '.v-j terms. Let us seo what the Australian -; Cardinal and the Enerlish Prior are offering | their fellow-Christians on behalf of the Bishop . ] of Rome. The cardinal, indeed, declares that 4 while in matters of faith there can be no com- | promise in matters of discipline the Pope -^ could' make concessions if he pleases. And -J so Anglican orders, the validity of episcopal y ordination, a married priesthood, and worship ,| in English instead of Latin. These could be | dealt with on their merits, as the Pope might ;| think fitting. As for all the graver questions ,-;j in debate, the infallibility of the Pope, the 'li cultus of the Virgin Mary, the invo- I cation of saints, indulgences from the fire of 'A purgatory, masses for the dead, these, and a ;^j number of other articles of belief at present j rejected by the Protestant churches, must be -'|j accepted implicitly. The prior declares that 5 nothing which appertains to the essence of the J church might be altered — that the constitution, *^ authority, and sacraments are immutable. '?£ Auricular confession would be insisted on. j. The Holy See might possibly make concessions, J but it would be on matters not deemed oi ? /: vital importance. He does not think, as the ! cardinal seems to, that clergymen should be - -i permitted to marry. Only it is not unlikely . ? J that the Holy Father would graciously allow - those already married to retain their wives , .« and children. As for the young priests, 1 they are -to accept celibacy-ties which _?]_ the Apostle Peter formed, the successor of St. ' ?: Peter condemns. They must dwell apart -; without wife or child or home. I shall -~\^ not attempt to follow Prior Vaughan in ^ his wild statement that 240,000,000 of people -; are united in the Papal Church 'as one man.' J But a word needs to be said. Does he include '3 the Italians in Rome? I once saw Pius IX. ??? performing High Mass in the Church of San ?} Carlo Borvomeo. He was guarded against ;A attacks from his own Roman subjects by a j triple file of soldiers with freed bayonets, | raiiged from the door of entrance to tho very steps of the altar. United as one ; man ! Surely the prior has never : been to Italy, or Germany, or France, or even Spain. In the very heart of Roman Catholic ism there is revolt, deep and deadly, against Papal rule. And I beg you not to trust implicitly to the ; prior's reading of history. The ftev. Haskett ? Smith has characterised it as 'superb audacity.' We may agree with him in his estimate of Henry VIII., but when he lauds Queen Mary, and evidently regrets the failure 5 of the Armada, when he traduces Queen Eliza- -v beth and sneers at her with a bit of unpriestly '' witticism, and when coming with a bound to our own times he asserts that Lord Halifax and the English £-eople are longing, to be re united with the centre of Christendom, we see ' at once that he knows little of the mind and temper of the English race. I must ] leave it for those who can speak with greater authority than myself to say whether the : High Church party has accepted 'almost all the doctrine and even the ritual of the Papal Church,' whether there are over 3,000 clergy- j men and 30 Anglican bishops united in sym- i pathy with Lord Halifax, endorsing 'the * humble, beautiful, and spiritual letter' -vhich he is said to have 'placed at the feet of the J Vicar of Christ.' But I venture to express the 1 opinion that while the High Church party has ? j followed too closely the ritual of Rome and has * adopted some of the doctrines which our f athera of the Reformation repudiated and put away, -; yet that the greater number of the clergymen j and a j'et larger proportion of their followers are stoutly opposed to Papal domination. Irt i their dreams of reunion with the Roman J Church they have not dreamt of submission 5 to an infallible Pope. Of the Broad Church s| and the Evangelicals, and of the Christian 1 sects outside the Episcopal (these last alono 1 numbering more than one-half the nation) I * can speak with greater confidence. They if would as soon think of rendering civil 1 obedience to the Czar of Russia as of render- ' J ing spiritual obedience to the Bishop of Rome. ^ My contention then is that the reunion of § Christendom upon the term3 haughtily ^ proffered by the Pope would be the re- enslave- J ment of Christendom. Three centuries and a ^ half ago our ancastors broke the fetters forged i in an evil time. We are asked to return to the f spiritual bondage of the middle ages. Listen to the great historian of English literature, ; 'From the fourth century gradually tho dead letter was substituted for the living faith. Christians resigned themselves into the hands ? - of the clergy, aud the clergy into the hands of j; the Pope. Christian faith was reduced to the ; accomplishment of works, and works to the ac complishment of ceremonies. ... In place of Christianity the Church, in place of free I belief an imposed orthodoxy, in place of heart and energetic thought external and mechanical ^ discipline. These are the characteristics »v*i of the middle ages. Under this constraint a ; thinking society had ceased to tnink, and man- J kind, slothful and crouchinp:, made over their conscience and their conduct into the hands of '*, their priests, and were as, puppets, capable 1 only of reciting a catechism and chanting a ' hymn.' Do you say the middle ages are gone, and with them the spiritual domination of the '-- priesthood. My reply is that the claims now * \ advanced by the Papacy are greater than they s were when Luther renounced his allegiance. j. In declaring the infallibility of the Pope at the ^ QDcumenical Council of 1870, rn asserting that he is the one mouthpiece of the \ Holy Ghost, Rome arrogates for him a divine \ authority which Hildebraud and Innocent 2 dared not say was theirs when kingdoms were « at their feet. 'The Rome of the Middle i ages claimed universal monarchy. The modern ^ Church of Rome has abandoned nothing, re- J tracted nothing.' & We. are not concerned to-night with the j doctrines of the Papacy. We are to look at it f rather in regard to its policy, its government, i and the relation of this to the civil power, the ; ljearing of this on Australian citizenship. Your attention is invited, not to its creeds, -j or its discipline, or its methods of wor- * ship, but to one great feature of its policy,1 ; which I deem to be antagonistic to the free- j dorn which is the inalienable heritage of the ^ sons of Britain. In our days, and among \ those who have won for themselves the largest | results of truth and the fairest fruits of ; civilisation, there is no principle more settled. ' Listen to Sir. Gladstone, a High Churchman \ more eagerly held, more constantly acted on }\ than the right of peoples to govern them- ~\ selves. The divine right of kings was buried -i in the tomb of George III. If you will but t fairly consider those revolutionary efforts that \ are being put forth in Europe you mav Sr discern, under all extremes of socialistic --8 opinion and anarchic action, the resolute M determination of the people themselves to ? 3 achieve their own destiny. It is the last ^ teaching of the new political philosophy and, rm may I say it, of the old gospel of Christ. It 4i comes to us as the ripest result of experience M and as the truest exposition of the words fj of the Master. The despot, the auto- a crat, the dictator, the unconstitutional M monarch belong to an age that is effete. Here, |i in Australia, we are fully resolved to govern *ll ourselves. Civil freedom is the breath of onr gj| nostrils. J|h How, then, shall we explain the anomaly !« that in the religious sphere it is with. JB many so different ? They belong to a church 31 where constitutional liberty such as they Jf| demand in civil life must not be dreamt --^a of. There they recognise a human autho- ^H rity to which they must render implicit , J» and unquestioning obedience. All real power -^M is vested in the clergy. The laity have -no ' ~i-JS share.
