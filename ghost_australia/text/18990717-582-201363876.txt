' OASTLEMAINE Y. NEWSTEAD! " It is evidently time that football, as -well.: us piracy, had its comic opera j . Gilbert- and; the ghost of Sir Arthur Sullivan could have found a good subject on the Camp on Saturday. Foot ball language, by the way, would uiake, a ,'very enective iioretto ;. we recommend tne thomo' to aspiring local posts. Half the Oiistleninihe team, aud more than half the Nowstead, had gouo to Maldon to see the other inateh— the ;Ne"wstead fellows out of sheer cussedness and despair, and the locals beoause they did not oxpeeD a gaine here. Both teams wero therefore filled up'by recruits from a scanty muster of spectators, and as Castleinuiue had first pick, the other side, had to lie content with " small stuff,", with the re sult that senior football was played by ; shrimps eoaroely in their teens. The game was not a very serious affair, for after two ! quarters of tho kindergartem ; exercise, the Nowstead team threw up the sponge, the scores being .then ft in favour of Castlomaino— 4 goals to IV Some of the little fellows showed surprisingly clever football. ' OTHER. MATCHES. The list nt the head of this column shows the results of the other matches played on Saturday. Tho Chowton team is evidently going to. exer cise a big. -influence in' determining this' year's preiniership ; arid 'now that the Hareourt boys have got into a winning mood, thoro is no toll- ing what they may not do. . >'- ft'' '" " r".
