' ,. ; ?'-.... EyENING JiiSEII»fi& ? ? r: . , Largely attended tea^andpublic meetings were held at the Stow Church, in f he evening. The 'Bfiv. F. W. Cox (Chaicman ^f the Union) pue sided_at the. public meejfcing, anjl in ioitiatang; the proceedings ailuded^ojtheir previous gather- . ings, saying the. time ior, discussions and busi ness had been .found too limited, -although' two days had been occupied^ and he, was not sure ;but that, they, would have to extend it to three 'days. He then referred tp matters connected with Church life, expressing himself favorable -toa certain amount of denominational union,', but pointing out that in ChurcheB, as dnofche .trees pf the forest, -there must be to some ex-, teat diversity -still, all aught move in harmony t3 the one great .will, and have -? a strong and vigorous ecclesiastical life. , Amongst the wants of their ' own Church were more direct and personal .appeals; to God, and in their singing their praise should, be the -. outcome of their pwi. spiritual natures. The Rev. M. Williams, M. A., before speaking upon the topic confided to him, expressed -his agree ment with the Chairman's remarks,-- His sub ject— 'The .lack of spiritual life in- pur. Churches, and tie means of remedying it' — iie divided into two parts— first the disease, and then the r«rpftdy. Tffe did, not wish to make any invidiousr cpnir^risons withjother-Churches, or speak in depreciation of what had been done by their own body!'- On ? the 'contrary, he regarded the .success- which- 'had been achieved with thankfulness ; but whilst admitting that much had been done, that their congregations were good, and their- : organizations numerous^ lie maintained that there was a lack of spiritual life. All true -members . of the Church, were - those who believed through grace in Christ, and had a spiritual life. Spiritual life to the Church was like? scaffolding to the building. . It sought to conserve, maintain, and perpetuate this life, to nourish it so that it mights grow, and it did this by rettgious preaching, Christian ordinances, brotherly intercourse, andChmtiah. fellowfihip. , This, life must be propagated, diffused— iu other words — there must be a con version of sinners as well as . a building up of the Church in faith and holiness. When they had this it would be evidenced in two ways — by growth of inward and outward life. As to out ward growth, he did not think thev had the numbers they. might expect evidencing it; and, is to inward growth, was it not a fact that their spiritual meetings, meetings for spiritual fellowship, and the 'ordinance of the Lord's Supper were but meagrely attended ? ' The first thing ? in connection with .the remedy for' this , was that they should feel their position, they must wake -to. their responsibilities ; ministers : shojild, briag,' the truth closer home to souls ; more should, be done to place spiritual subjects before 'the minds of. the children in Sabbath schools; . and more in the samedirection should be adbne by deacons ; and metnbets of. the Church with regard io those with ... whom ., -they, were brought, into . relationahip. Furtherj 'When Churches were low in their spiritual condition, special .services should be held ; and, lastly, tnere was, necessity -for .-individual and collec tive, earnest, importunate, and believing prayer. ,tio:.Gp4. ff ot: Juriiher- success; (Applause. ) The Eev.
