THE GURJ3E OP THE. AGES. ABr BANKER.J From the very earliest stages of the world's history, back even to that little known period before the flood, the fer mented juice of the grape has been used and, unfortunately, abused-by mankind as a beverage. The first mention in all his tory of wine is unhappily a record of the abuse of the intoxicating fluid by Noah, wbho, though a preacher of righteousness, to his lasting shame succumbed to its seduc tions. And, throughout the long chronicles of the world's annals, ever repeated in stances occur of men, notable in all the varied walks of life, even great rulers, statesmen, poets, varriors, artists, who, against tl eir better judgment, have volun tarily allowed themselves to be enslaved and ruined by the madly insensative craving for strong drink. From Alexander the Great, who, though conqueror of the world, could not conquer himself, to the barbarian savage who drinks himself insen sible with kava or arrack, the career of ulitold mnillions has been blasted by the bilighlti?g eflects of thes abuse of alcohol; and althou!lgl througl?out the Briti-tj Empire, thanks to the work of Temperance Societies, and also of the ubiquitous Salva tion Army, the prevalence of drunkenness amongst the masses has during the past two decades very materially decreased, yet on the continent generally the opposite has been the case.
