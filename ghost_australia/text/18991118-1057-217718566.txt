GHOSTS. The painter tolled at his plctaro in the light of the northern sky, And his soul burnt out at bis casol as the pnint grow hard and dry. Tho marvolous work that tho painter wrought seomed full of depth and soul, And each one gazed at the doathless thing : while each one paid bis toll. Then questioned tbo volco of the painter's heart, while tho great man shook bis head. "No motive pure can tho world endure— I did It for gold," ho said. Tho worker worked in th6 midnight black and under the light of day, And dragged his soul from oat of himself and breathod it into tho olay.

In front of iho battle's wavering Hue the bero charged his steed ; A thousand furies had hurried him on, and bis was a hero's speed.

Art met Duty, and Duty said : " Three things have just been sola t One for glory and one for famo and one for glittering gold.

You're a ghostly thing, and I myself nra tho samo ; Wo are not worth much to tho popular touch with gold and glory and fame I " —Tom Masson in "Munsey's Mngazlno."
