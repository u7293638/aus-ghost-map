SELECT POETRY.. GHOSTS. GHOSTS often come to my window, And knock at my chamber door, Or sit by my side at dinner, Or walk with mo on the shore. I know their villanoiis faces, As they giggle, and sneer, and jar: They will not be gone, so I'll count them, And tell them what they are I Ghost3 of ambitions buried, Ghosts of a love grown cold, Ghosts of a fortune squandered, Ghosts of a tale that's told, Ghosts of a traitorous friendship, And of follies nine times nine j Come Wizard ! come! and lay them In the deep lied Sea !-of Wine ! -All the, Year Round.
