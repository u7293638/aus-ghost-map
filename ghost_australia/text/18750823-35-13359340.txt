RIFLE MATCH. (Abridged from the Kiama Independent.) KIAMA v. No. 1 Co., 1ST REGIMENT. THE second match of the second series between the above corps was contested at Kiama on tho 14th instant. Tho repre- sentatives of No. 1 company arrived at Kiama, per steamer, about 2 hours beforo tho commencement of tho match. The shooting at tho 200-yards rango was greatly delayed in COnsoquenco of tho unserviceable target which had boen supplied by tho brigade authorities for tho uso of the Kiama company. At this distnnco tho shooting was poor, and No. 1 company dropped slightly to tho roar. At tho longer ranges the Kiama riflemen, by excellent average shooting, secured another victor)*, with 28 points to spare. Shortly after (he completion of tho shooting tho competitors woro formed in line, the usual choers wero indulged in,'and Cap- tain Wells congratulated Major Black and his team upon their undeniably good average. In tho evening, the Sydney, visitors, including Captain Compton, woro tho invited ghosts at an excellent dinner, which was, as usual, provided at Mrs. Jackson's. Thero was a large attendance, evidencing tho çreat local interest taken in the contest. Major Buick occupied tho chair, with Captain Wells on his right, and S. W. Gray, M.L.A. for | Illawarra, and S. Chartes, M.L.A. for Kiama, on his left hand. John Marks, J.P.,was vico-chairman. The toasts proposed and responded to wore--"The Queen," "No. 1 Company," "Kiama Companj-," "The Parliament," " Captain Compton," and " Tho Ladies." A topio of general interest to Volunteers was touched upon, namely, tho shoddy targets and defectivo aminunitioa which tho Volunteer corps at Sydnoy and throughout tho country wero compelled to use. A general wish was expressed to tho eiToot that a few hundred woll-constructcd serviceable targets would be imported within tho next few months. Captain Charles, who had been under tho impres- sion that good targets wero kept for Sydney, and tho inferior ones foisted upon tho country corps, stated that pei-sonal inspection had proved the contrary, for all wera equally faulty. Ho is of. opinion that, if Volunteer officers move in this matter and causo a sufficient sum to bo placed on tho . Estimates to replnco the bad targets with good ones, the Assembly would willingly grant it. Pewters woro presented to the highest scorors on each side—Private J. Dinning and Sergeant J. H. Maddocks. Master R. Roberts read a neat address, expressive of his gratification nt the receipt of a tankard, subscribed for by the members of No. 1 company's team of Easter, 1874, as a token of their appreciation of his excellent marking.
