\- CtJltlOUS CKEDUL1TY. (Sydney Globe.) A Ghost ra the Mudoke District. At a place called Cooyal, iu the Mud gee district, a mysterious affair happens i wo or three evenings u week, A family is living in a small hut there, the mother having some time ago left them because she did uot like tbe neighbourhood, Her sous aud daughters are simple und unsophisticated people, and they believe that the mother has died, tbut her spirit has returned to the viciuiy of their resi dence, aud several times a week throws Btones at'the houses. The stones appear lodropthrpugh the coiliug of the kitchen. There is an attic between the ceiling and the roof filled with potatoes. Though there are no holes in the ceiliug, the stones are said to drop from there, as many as 40 falling in a single night. A number of sharp- witted .residents of Mudgee weut out to the place the .other evening, and in company with a constable watched tor the ghost. About 8 p.m., when the spirit apparently went home to bed, the constable and the visitors made every eft'ort to discover where the stones came from, but without avail They watched both inside aud outside of the building, but failed to detect the presence of the stone thrower. As soou as tbe stones fall the children of the house pick them up and hand them over to the visitors with feeling of awe. The affkirJias created some excitement in tho district, aud is puzzling the miuds of many levej-hpaded, personB who, up to the present; have been unable to discover a clue to the. mystery. The stones are 'of the earth earthy.'
