PORTFOLIO. Cather op the fragneietsl, ineveresy, human life thero are sure to be some. Every one of us has a secret chamber snoiewhere, filled with inhabitants whom nodrie but hii self can see; it rests with himself alone whether they shall be decaying corpses or only beautiful :ghosts. "God Â°lniude -me what I am, and iade my lot wliat HIe willed it to be," is a tnith not inconsistent with the other truth, that Hod gies us; the materials to work s wih, beot leaves the workmanship in ouer iOn' hands. Every mal can nmake or mar his'irvi life ; at any rete, it appears so. Tl?he fn9t tjt we know nothing lo the' results oI 6ur'acts, makes them, as regards ourselves, absolutely in dependent; and the imLpossibility'of gezing one inch into the impenetrable future comes to tile same tlhing as if we behleld it all. Lead Thou me'oh I ilo not ask to see The distant scene f oneo step's enough"for But that one step 'iost be taken steodily, firmly, religiously. L There must be ino look ing back, no mourning over the inexorable past. Each. day--saeh a little day, and every one circling round so quietly that they mount into weeks, and months, and years, before we know' what iwe have lost or gainedra?-eact day must be filled up, minute by miuute, with thesib suties which are in themselve jays, or grow to be. If among them ever rises the spectral face of tile neveriforgotten- might.lave-been-heauti ful in its eternal youtllr, perfect in its unattained felicity-wihy fear? It is but a ghost, and life is a reality. Ay, a useful, useable, noble reality. lHappy too, when once the grim idol Self lhas been dethroned for ever. For it is a truth which we all have to learn -often times through moany a bitter lesson -that we never can be happy until we cease trying to make ourselves so,--Bly the uthoer of" John lfalifir, Gentleman." .
