How oft do we meet, in the cloudland ot sleep, The ghost of the byegone day, And, with skeleton-hand, see it point to the land Of the future, that looms far away ? I saw in my dream a mystic scene : I gazed on a broad fair land, But its soil was scarred, and its beauty marred, By a rude despoiler's hand. Of her sages' light, of her heroes' might, Remained but the mouldering sipns, Where a conqueror's creed had sown the weed On the walls of her holiest shrines. And T thought to my gaze, through the silvery '' hase, That o'ershadowed the land of my dream, Shone an angel bright, all robed in light, And she looked on that rueful scene. On the gallows high, were hung tg die, Men young, and brave, and fair. While a blood- thirsty crowd cheered and shouted aloud, And drowned their dying prayer. From the struggling form midst scoff and scorn, Had flod the lingering breath, Bub uo traitor's shame, no murderer's stain, Had sullied the soul in death. Why die they there ? said the angel fair, Spirit of Nature, tell ! .And a chill cold blast came murmuring past, They loved their country well ! And an agonised thrill seemed that spirit to fill, As shu looked o'er the ocean waves Where the convict bark, o'er the ocean dark, Bore its cargo of manacled slaves. Guarded and bound, they looked around, Still on those loved shores now fading away, And Sadly they sighed that they had not died Where the dust of their fathers lay. And high ou the gale rose the exiles' wail, And the mart) r's stifled prayer, With the mother's sigh, and the orphan's cry, They smote ou the angel's ear. ? Then lifting her eyes to the dark purple skies, She knelt, while her lips seemed to move, And a low mm inured prayer, on soft, balmy air, . Went up to the God of Love. Then my dream passed away, while a voice seemed to say — 'On ! Borrowing land, be of cheer For the clou-l of thy woe it shall melt in the glow Of the peaoe bringing day that is near.' — Nation.
