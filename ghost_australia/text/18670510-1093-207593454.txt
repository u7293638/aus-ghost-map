Miss Aitken again performed at White's Rooms on Thursday night to a large audience. The chair was taken by the Rev. Mr. Harcus. The programme contained little that was new to an Adelaide audience, but the pleasing manner in which - the lady performed her part rendered everything new. In answer to encores of the charge of . "The Light Brigade"' and "Lochinvar" she substituted "The Wonnerfu' "Wean" and "The Scottish Cavalier." Mr. R. B. White presided at the piano with his usual skill. As to-day will be her last appearance in Adelaide we strongly advise all to go and hear her.

Mr. and Mrs. Case gave their very ftmuttigg "3?iia &&st; Ita^y," iu ' the Tomperanoo Holl, North Adelaide, on Thursday evening, May 9. The attendance was numerous, and the audience evinced^ their appreciation of the acting, singing, and instru mentation of the talented artistes by hearty ! rounds of applause. On Wednesday and Thursday, the 17th and 18th April, No. 3 Company classified at Kapunda, under Drill-Instructors Kingdom and Mortimer. Two ranges were used, one being that of the old Mine Company. The weather was very unpropitious, and in the after noon the wind increased to a furious gale, so that dining the firing in the second class the target was almost invisible from dust and rain, and at last the shooting was postponed till next day, and the volunteers were dismissed, wet through. Thursday was a lovely day, and in consequence some of the finest scores ever made by the Enfield was the result. Forty-three fired; 13 passed into the second class, and 12 into the first, all of whom became marksmen. Subjoined are the scores:—At the first period— Ensign Small, 57 points; Privates C. H. Austin, 55; C. Rebbeck, 54; Captain Tuckfield, 53; Sergeant N. Hawke, 52; Private E. Edgecombe, 49; Corporal G. R. Lowe, 48; Privates C. Marquet, 45; J. W. Strawbridge, 45; Lieut. Mullen, 43 ; Privates 6. Thompson, 43; D. B. "Wiltshire, 43; J. H. Williams, 42; and Surgeon Blood, 40. Second period, at the second-class ranges—Sergeant Hawke, 47; Private C. H. Austin, 42; Captain Tuekfield, 38; Private J. W. Strawbridge, 35; Corporal Lowe, 33; Lieut. Mullen, 31; Ensign Small, 31; Privates Wm. Hill, 31; J. Knuckey, 31; E. Edgecombe, 30; J. H. Williams, 30; and D. B. Wiltshire, 30. Third period, at the first-class ranges—Private J. W. Strawbridge, 41; Ensign Small, 38; Captain Tuckfield, 37; Corporal Lowe, 37; Private E. Edgecombe, 37; Sergeant Hawke, 36; Privates J. H. Williams, 31; C. H. Austin, 29; Lieutenant Mullen, 28; Privates W. Hill, 27; J. Knuckey, 27; and D. B. Wiltshire, 27. The aggregate scores of the marksmen are— Sergeant W. Hawke, 135; Captain Tuckfield 128; Ensign Small, 126; Privates Austin, 126 ; Strawbridge, 121; Corporal Lowe, 118; Pri vates Edgecombe, 116; Williams, 103; Lieut. Mullen, 102; Privates Wiltshire, 100; Wm. Hill, 97; Knuckey, 96. The score of Sergeant Hawke, is, we believe, the best made as yet. Ensign Small fired standing, and scored three consecutive bullseyes at 750 yards. The in structors said the shooting generally was ad mirable, and the men look confidently to bringing away the champion prizes to the North. [We published an account of this practice some time ago, but it was not quite complete. We now reproduce it in a corrected form.] There was a very large attendance at the Victoria Theatre on Thursday evening. The entertainment was under the patronage and presence of Major Vivian and the officers of the 14th Regiment. Shakspeare's tragedy of " Hamlet," commenced the performances. Mr. Joseph Rayner appeared as Hamlet, and sus tained the character remarkably welL His delivery was very distinct, his action good, and he was frequently loudly applauded by an appreciative audience. Mr. O'Brien made a very good ghost, Mr. Andrews was passable as Claudius, the King, and Miss Arnot made a very good Horatio, and Mr. Charles Young made the most of his part as j First Grave Digger. Mrs. Jackson took the part I of Ophelia very well indeed, and in the mad scene she was very good. The other principal j ; character was the Queen, which was alloted to Mrs. Ray, and which was performed by her very well indeed. The minor characters were also fairly taken, with one or two exceptions where the promptor's voice was heard rather too often. On the whole, however, the piece was a success, and at the fall of the curtain on the last act Mr. Rayner was honored with a loud call before the curtain. A laughable ballet " Mad as a March Hare," which introduced some excellent dancing by Miss Woods and Mr. Edouin con eluded the entertainment. To-night the same j pieces will be repeated, and Mr. W. Hoskins, of the London and Melbourne theatres, and Mdlle. St. Denis will make their first appearance on ^Monday evening. We have our special reporter's account of the first day's Gawler Races, but the demands of the English mail upon our space this morning compels us.to hold it over.
