OLLA PODRIDA. He Met His Match. — He was all that's brave and manly. He had emu lated Stanley, and had traversed wilds where white man ne'er had set his foot before. He just gloried in a battle, for he loved to hear the rattle of the bullets and the sounding of the can non's deadly roar. He would fight a hundred people ; he would climb the highest steeple, though he knew by that rash act he was courting certain death. He would face a raging tiger, he would swim the turbid Niger, and he'd walk up to a cannon's month and never bate his breath. There was nothing that could scare him.

Upon the president r itiring in August of last yar Iqa took with him his copy of the Act, and when applied to for the book, as it was the property of the council, alleged that he gave it to a brother councillor. It was therefore 'uat th|s con. version of the book kept it ont of the hands of the president. JudgtLgqt was given for defendant as there was no evidence of wrongful conversion.
