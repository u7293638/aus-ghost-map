NANANGO. [FROM OUR OWN CORRESPONDENT.] June 30. ON the 23rd and 24th instant the Nanango Racing Club held their annual races, which were a great success, as far as the quality and number of the horses was concerned. The club is to be congratulated upon the new saddling paddock and steward's room just erected; it is a great improvement upon the old one. It is to be hoped the club will go on and further improve the course; it is needed in many ways. On the evening of the first day of the races, a concert was held in the Town Hall, under the auspices of the club. Mr. S. Mendelsohn deserves great praise for the trouble he has taken to bring the concert to a successful issue. All the more praise is due, as the performers, with one exception, consisted of boys and girls attending school. They seemed to be a bright and quick-witted lot of children. The part taken by a young gentle- man—a noted amateur—was very well rendered. The two little girls played their parts very creditably, and the tableau " Pepper's Ghost; or, the Manager's Troubles" went very smoothly. The concert was a success financially, and with regard to the attendance being good, I can personally say from experience that the hall was crammed. I forgot to mention that Mr. Mendelsohn, assisted by the Dramatic Club, gave a concert on last St. Patrick's night, which was also a great success. On the night of the last day of the races the usual ball was held in the Town Hall, at which about 100 persons were present, who seemed to enjoy themselves, and, I believe, danced until day- light.
