LITTLE MISS LIGHTFOOT A CHRISTMAS STORY. Written expressly for The Tasmanian BY JOHN SILVESTER NOTTAGE, Author of "Dr. Longhurst's Mistake," "Half a Century Ago." I have learned to love Tasmania, my adopted hime, almost as much as I love my native land— England. He must have but a small heart who cannot love both after having spent a quarter of a century in each of these favoured countries. But to one feature of Australian life I have never become reconciled. There seem still to me to be an incongruity in Christmas under a fervid sun. Christmas with snow and lee, with keen winds and frosts, with short days and long nights, with holly and mistletoe, with roaring fires and good cheer, is Christmas to me. But Christmas as I have passed it in the island continent with dust and intolerable heat, with buzzing night flies precluding slumber, with brazen sky and parched earth, I cannot with all my philosophy enjoy, I can only submit to the inevitable. Christinas in Tasmania, however, is a different thing— a very agreeable modification of the latter, though the force of early habit and association compels me to express my decided preference for the former. Some such thoughts as these were passing through my mind one genial sunny Christmas eve as I stood under the verandah of a pretty cottage home in this fair land, looking upon as sweet a variety of prospect as, I was fain to confess, had ever greeted my sight in the dear old mother country. My life had been somewhat lonely and, perhaps, more sorrowful than the majority of lives that are recorded, but I was not sad that evening as I gazed, utterly forgetful of my environments, on broad level or gently undulating meadows—I like that last word much better than "paddocks" —on the dark blue Western Tiers, on the high-road winding round the neighbouring hillside, on the little bridge spanning the rivulet, the red brick inn and the white stone church, the foliage hidden rectory, and the cottages sprinkled around the gentle aclivities on which the hamlet stood. I know not if my pleasing thoughts were expressed in any countenance, but my day-dream was suddenly interrupted by a voice, musical, soft, and low, beyond that of any other voice I have ever heard. "Dreaming, Miss Sabine?" I started, coloured, and smiled. "I must plead guilty, Ethel. I am not given to dreaming though." "Are you not? I should have thought you were." "Why, Ethel?" "Because I have seen you very frequently seem to lose all consciousness of your surroundings ; and those beautiful large brown eyes of yours alter so strangely in expression that I felt convinced they were gazing on things unseen and unseeable by such prosaic mortals as myself and my people." I felt my colour deepen. I was angry with myself that I had not more skilfully, nay completely, hidden that inner life of mine from even the good, kind souls among whom my lot had been for some years cast, and who I had learned to love as I believe they loved me. "I have not hurt you, have I, Miss Sabine ?" "No, dear; but I am angry with myself that I should have been so forgetful of what was due to you all—so wrapt up in myself as to be dwelling on the irreparable and irrecoverable past until I had forgotten the present." Ethel laid her little white hand on my arm, with which I was supporting my head, and leaning against the post of the verandah, " No, I won't hear you say the least thing against yourself. You are the most self-forgetting creature under the sun. Why, I don't believe you ever studied your own will and pleasure in your life." "You give me credit for more virtues than I possess, Ethel; and it is like your kind heart to utter such phrases of one who, in justice to herself, must say she thinks very highly of you. But the truth is I am not unselfish, or at the best, I was not unselfish. Perhaps the severe schooling I have had, it may be the copious draughts of sorrow I have had to drink, have been necessary to purify me from the dross of selfishness. But what are we talking so much of myself for? Who goes there?" I pointed as I spoke to the figure of a little woman, somewhat oddly dressed, who was hurting past the house. I say hurrying, but that word does not exactly express the manner in which the pedestrian was passing. She was moving swiftly, very swiftly, but with a smooth gliding motion. ''Oh!" said Ethel, "That is little Mrs. Lightfoot.'' "And who is Mrs. Lightfoot?" "Hush! Speak with bated breath," whispered Ethel. "She is"—and my pupil placed her rosy lips close to my ear and uttered almost inaudibly the words—"A witch!" I laughed a little low short laugh. ''Ethel, darling, how can you talk such nonsense." "But it's a fact, Miss Sabine. Tell me, did you ever see an ordinary mortal walk like she walks? So swiftly, so smoothly, so noiselessly?" "What a string of adverbs! Well, to say the truth, Ethel, I was struck with the peculiar gliding, swift motion of the little woman. ''Yes, that is why she bears the name of Lightfoot. It is not her proper name, but I think it is very appropriate." "Very. It is strange that being a witch she condescends to terra firma at all ; she ought to go through the air you know." "On a broomstick," laughed Ethel after a glance which assured her that the object of our conversation was a long way on the road past the house. "Where does she live, Ethel?" "In a cottage 'far retired by solitude and deep surrounding shade concealed,' '' said Ethel, slightly altering Thomson. '' You seem to know all about her," I said smiling, as I looked at the fair young face, With brow as yet Pure as the young moon's coronet. "Not all," replied Ethel, "but enough to make me shiver whenever I see her or think of her." "Nonsense! Ethel, I shall have to be angry with you if you talk such rubbish. You don't really mean to tell me that you believe any woman, little or large, old or young, good or bad, has the power of predicting; has, in short, anything with which witches, are usually credited.'' "I cannot say what I really believe about this little woman. I don't know, whether she is good or bad, but I do know that she talked most seriously with me, and gave me excellent advice, and that she was very angry with me when I went into her house and asked her to tell me my fortune, and what would be her charge for so doing." "Ethel, Ethel, you astonish me. When did you go to her ? I hope it was before I came among your friends and into your home." "Now don't look so horrified, Miss Sabine. Of course it has been since you came to us, but it was no fault of yours. We went while you were absent during Christmas last year. Matty and I. Matty hadn't courage to go alone, and yet had an irresistible desire to pry into the mysteries, so we went. I am a very rational sort of a girl you know, but Matty is brimful of superstition. She believes in second sight, warnings, presentiments, and the supernatural generally. When we reached Mrs. Lightfoot's cottage our courage all oozed out of us. I had intended, to be very valorous, and to show my superiority to the vulgar desire to know what is hidden from our sight. But somehow when we came to the door of the neat little cottage, and the wind wailed through the tall poplars that shaded it, and the thunder growled int he distance, and the darkness seemed to be coming on apace, I wished myself home again, I can assure you. However, Matty's lips were set, and her face, though pale, was resolute. ''Come on," she said, and we tapped at the door. I must confess all my preconceived ideas of the dreadful nature and appearance of those " horrible and awful' " beings called witches were scattered like spray in a high wind when the little woman opened her door. In the first place, she was a comely looking body, dark complexion, very dark eyed, but with regular, small, features, and a generally bright, intelligent expression of face. Then her room was neatness itself, and on the table was —you will stare when I have told you—a Bible ! Matty was was very pale and motioned to me to speak, so I said with a little huskiness in my voice, "We'want our fortunes told Mrs. Lightfoot—how much is it?" Oh dear! You should have seen the change that came over the little woman! She straightened herself and seemed to grow a couple of inches taller. "I am not a fortune teller," she said. I muttered something about having heard that she was, and rose from the seat she had placed for me in some confusion. A smile broke over her ruffled face and she relied; ''If you want my counsel and guidance I will give it to you. I will tell you what I know of your past, and put you on your guard for the future.'' Matty said "Please do so, and let met be the first." She took Matty's long, slender hand in hers and held it for a few minutes in perfect silence, fixing her dark eyes on Matty's which were still darker. I watched the proceedings with breathless interest. At length the little woman said ''My dear, yours has been a stormy, troublous past. You have suffered greatly already — you will suffer still more in the future. You have lost the one being on earth who could sympathise with you and who loved you, and who would have given her life for you if it could have saved'you from sorrow.'' I stared at the two when Mrs. Lightfoot said this for I thought the fact of Matty's mother's death was known only to ourselves, Matty's eyes were riveted on those of the little woman— the pupils seemed to dilate. It was evidently as much a surprise to her as to myself. The little woman went on—"Yours is a stormy, passionate nature. You cannot love or hate in moderation. You have given your heart to a worthless man who will mar your life and make you as miserable as misplaced affection can make an ardent, nervous, excitable, passionate girl. Tear him out of your heart if you would save yourself from great misery. Much more she said, and all in the same style — a style so different to that which I had supposed these imposters to use that I tell you plainly, Miss Sabine, I began to be afraid she really did know more about her fellow creatures than her fellow creatures knew about her. Then she talked in such a motherly way to Matty that the interview ended, as most other matters do, with Matty in a perfect rain of tears. You know I am not excitable or nervous, or imaginative, or impassioned, and so I was not so much moved as Matty, but still I thought that the abominably knowing little Mrs. Lightfoot might tell me something that I should not care about even Matty knowing, so I declined to hear any more when Matty got her hand back again out of the little woman's grasp. Matty' slipped a fee into Mrs. Lightfoot's hand, and away we came. When we had got some distance on the road, and out of the shadow of the big trees, the rain began to fall rather heavily, and we hurried along. "Matty,'' I said, with a desperate effort at merriment, ''let me look at your hand ; I shall see the mark of the evil one there, I know." '' Don't be absurd, Ethel," said Matty shortly. " Why, Matty, you don't mean to tell me there was any truth in what she said to you, do you?" "No truth !'' exclaimed Matty. "No truth! eh ? Is not my poor mother dead?" "Yes, of course; but that was a mere lucky guess." "Perhaps you are right," she answered, and then relapsed into silence.But at bed time when I went to my room, which you know adjoins that in which Matty slept, I heard her sobbing piteously. Well, I have not had a letter from her for many months, but the last I received is finished in these words:— "Oh, Ethel! would to Heaven I had listened to the warning of the little woman that night of the thunderstorm." So that I cannot help thinking that little Mrs. Lightfoot is something more or less than mortal. "Did it ever strike you that she had become acquainted in some way to you unknown with the history or some facts in the history of the girl you have been speaking of?" "I don't think it possible," replied Ethel, or at least it is very, very improbable. Matty is my second cousin, and until she came to our place for her Christmas holidays had never been out of her native country, New South Wales." "It is singular, but I am not disposed to allow that Mrs. Lightfoot is anything more than an imposter, notwithstanding that we are assured by one having the gift and faculty divine that ''There are more things under heaven Than are dreamt of in our philosophy !" And yet, when the the sun had long gone down behind that hill around which the highroad ran, and the Western Tiers frowned beneath the calm blue sky, with its myriad sparkles; when the lights had all been extinguished save the solitary lamp over the doorway of the red brick inn, and Ethel -j:m X'l'Ji~:{ia u-'^ ^a SVJilI oox tdiiiiljiis ?
