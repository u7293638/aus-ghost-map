ROMAN CATHOLIC. ORDINATION SERVICE AT MARY'S MOUNT. THK dignity of the priesthood was on Sunday last conferred upon three Passionist students at the'retreat of studies, Mary's Mount, Goulburn. The Right Rev. Dr. Gallagher, Co-adjutor of Goulburn, was the officiating prelate. The Very Rev. Father Gregory, provincial of the Passionists in Australia, was Archdeacon, while the Rev. Father Fernando C.P. acted as director of ceremonies. The names of the ordinandi were Father John (Sherlock), Gerard (Chester), and Alphonsus (Coen). Many of their friends and relatives came from a distance to witness the function. The solemn and impressive ceremonial was full of meaning. The Bishop placed upon the youDg Levites the priestly vestment, an outward symbol of the inward charity which is the peculiar mark of the deciples of Christ. He bound up their hands to signify that henceforth they were sacred to holy things and cut off from all profane uses. They were anointed with holy oil as a symbol of the unction of the Holy Ghost communicated to them that by the power of God whatever they should bless should be blessed, whatever they should consecrate should be consecrated, and whatever they should sanctify should be sanctified. Such arc the wolds of the beautiful prayer offered by the Bishop as he performs the external ceremonial. Then with imposition of hands and with prayer he called down upon them the Spirit of God to fill them with grace and strength and benediction to^ execute well their priestly charge. The relatives and friends of those ordained came to receive their blessing. Amongst those who were present were Mr. Chester (Father Gerard's brother), Mrs. Coen of Yass (Father Alphonsus' mother), together with others, friends of Father John.-â€” Goulburn Herald.
