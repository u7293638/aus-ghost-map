Flotsam and Jetsam A Tale of the Back Blocks. G. SPENCER BRIGGS. A young man of the city Of London thought that he Would, if he were in Queensland, An acquisition be; So left his home, a baker's shop, And sailed across the sea. And in due time he landed In famous Brisbane town, Where he. who'd often browned the loaves, Was in his turn "done brown"; For he lost all the cash he had Before the sun went down. Next morn a bushman on the spree — A roving sort of card— Heard the young man explain how he Had had his fortunes marred; And said though the young man was soft Hla case was very hard.  The bushman helped him to obtain A pass to the far west, And with a swag upon his back The new chum went in quest Of any sort of work, at which He meant to do his best. He rode upon the railway train  As far as it could go, And then "humped bluey" to a place Where he'd been given to know They were in want of a good cook, And he might stand a show. In three days' time he found the place, And made his application, And to his Joy obtained the job Of cooking for the station; A pound a week he was to have As his remuneration. Now at this time a fearful drought Bound earth with iron band; The sky for months had been like brass; A curse seemed on the land— Even the water that they drank Had carefully been dammed. It was a weary, weary drought; The gum trees 'neath it bowed, The cattle and the sheep all died, The country round was cowed; Yet there was not a soul could say It was under a cloud. A sad, sad thing it was to hear The dying bullocks' moans, To know what used to be green grass Was nought but sand and stone, To see what was a flock of sheep A heap of mutton bones. The country was in this sad state When New Chum undertook To execute the duties of Slushy and station oook; And, being such, to boil his beef For water he'd to look. The creek between its banks had faffed [?] Though not in liquidation; There nothing was to liquidate The solids on the station, And carting water was the cook's Most frequent occupation. Some time before the weather had No Clement Wragge to boss it, Floods came, a run upon the banks, The creek a boomer was it Until the water went and left The stones—a fixed deposit. But six miles off there was a hole, And water still was in it; Two horses to a dray were yoked, A tank placed in next minute, And New Chum mounted to the top, His Journey to begin it. The track was plain, the squatter said, And as the moon was waning, There was not much daylight to lose; Then ended by explaining His horses, being rather fresh, Would need some slight detaining. Away the young man went, and fair And soft his steeds he treated; Bat ere the waterhole he found, Or half his trip completed, Misfortune came upon him whore He on the tank was seated. A boulder, lying on the track Where ancient earthquake rolled it, His wheels went o'er, and on his perch The cook was badly jolted, Then saw that both the wheels were locked, And both the horses bolted. The brake held good, the wheels were fast, But both the horses faster, And they rushed on in mad career, In spite of reins and master, At rate of speed that could but end In most grievous disaster. Ere half the young man's hopes were dead, Or half- an-honr expired, His brake broke into pieoes, which Was not to be desired; And both his wheels lay down to rest, For they were badly tired. Then, like a miner seeking wealth In likeliest of places, Down 'mong the shafts he went headlong With sad cries and grimaces: He saw no sign of precious ore, Though he lit on the traces. The horses came to sudden stop, Or New Chum where he lay Had seriously been mangled by What was left of the dray; And then, in language technical, He found they'd lost their way. He slowly turned the horses loose, Gazed round in deep dejection, And then searched round him for the track In every direction; He could not find it, and at last Sat down in sad reflection. The sun sank low; the squatter felt 'Twast time the cook was back; His men were waiting for their tea, So he sent on his track A heathen old blackfellow, whose Most Christian name was Jack. The cook was sitting on a stump When the black tracker found him, And fancied ghosts and cannibals, And bunyips did surround him, As stealthily and silently The shades of night crept round him. And in the gloom the tracker's face Assumed a darker hue; The young man sitting on the stump Was looking very blue; Then all at once he turned to white As Jack's form came in view. He wanted no outlandish curse, So took to his own heels, O'er sticks and stones he fled as one Who awful terror feels. "Him no savee," the tracker says, As after him he steals. Then, seeing that he could not lead, Made up his mind to drive The cook, who, in an hour or two, Exhausted did arrive At the door of his own hut, where he For his blankets made a dive. The station hands then clustered round, And there were explanations; The men did " blow," the cook was blown, But made gesticulation, And wished that he had never come To cook on Back Block station. But with the morn he changed his mind, And was himself again, Is cooking yet—the time lapsed since That drought I can't explain; Suffice to say it was not in The year of Record Reign.
