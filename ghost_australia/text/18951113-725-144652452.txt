'Short Story ? X ' - ♦ ?? V * THE MAN WHO KNEW. . . There -was one subjeot which Walter Ferrand was believed to have at his finger-; ends, and that was Womu. He devoted touch time and labour to the study ot Woman, and lie gave the resolta of bia oV ' Servataons to tbe votld in a Series of Utile books, ^ each of whioh oontalned a careful analysis of some type of feminine oharacterj There was a curious Eftmenees about. Jtee] kohu o wwa, wre cue. masculine pan 01 no toading pubtioadmired it greatly, aod; was firmly convinced of the, aoouraoy -of the ?attof's observations; the more so because he dealt liberally ia the cynical epigrams,' paradoxes, and generalisations whioa, when uireoted against the opposite sex, are so dear ' to the heart of man. It was tne that one beardless youth had had the presumption to . tell Ferrand that the women in books Were like so many dried butterflies, with pins Stuck through them, and all the bloom! brushed off their wings. But' then everybody knew that he was not an impartial oritao, because he was dreadfully in lore with a Very delightful woman, only fifteen years older than himself. Although Ferrand knew so much about Borneo, he was but little addioted to feminine ftciety. Rumour said that he had been un fortunate in his relations with the fair sex, and it was oertain that he never felt so com pletely at his ease or on suoh good terms With himself as when he sat by the fire in the (tub smoking-room, and delivered himself of Words of wisdom on the subject of Femininity^ fts faults, failings, and general xmsatis- 1 4aotoriness, while the younger men hung teon his Hpa, and told each other that the 'toman wasn't bom who oould take in old : fterrand. Meanwhile, his books prospered beyond Cheir literary desserts. The heroines Wtere all creatures of impulse, hysterioally cftnotlonal, superficially sentimental, oon BlstenUy inconsistent, and impossibly irra tional ; oonsequefitly, they were eulogised by flie critics ae exquisite and lifelike studies of teie womanhood. One 'flOBRnsr J&rrand; decided- io spend a few weeks at Kartanlenbad, partly . . iop Account of his -liver, partly beoauae hfe thought that amoog'the heterogenous society mere assembled he . might pick op -some taehd material for bia next book. Tlje Ihoraing after his arrival. as he sat. under the dhestnat trees In the Cksfpo gardens, listen ing to the band, he notloeda sodden oom thotion among a group of students at a ileighboixrfng table. , 'Die rothe Dama,* they: were whispering flfegerly. 4 Da gehfc diejothe Dame.* Die rothe Darnel The Bed Lady ! A Mod title for a book, thought Ferrand, « he glanoed in the direction .Indicated by the ? indents. For a moment his eyas were tfkroit dassled by the glow of oolo^r radiated {rota a tall laoy atured'in a.aoarlet gown, tfnd wearing a toque oompoaed of a single huge poppy upon her head. It 'was ah rtidadoua costume, the more so beoause the wearer had red-gold hair -of a tint so bril liant that H threw even her poppy head- gear . feto the shade. Fferrand could not bis sure at fhe first glance whether the lady was beauti ful or only startling, for her eye-brows were golden, her eyes biuleb-greeh, and her nose Was not innocent of freckles. But— she. .pop Jbssed the compensating complexion that is dbmetimee the complement of suoh hair and fres; indeed, as Rvraad gazed at her be in tbluntarily recalled some of the foolish, tender rhapsodies of the old poets about tbe lilies and. roses or cherries and cream that Were supposed to mingle in their ladies' cheeks. There oould be no hyperbole lu any tfuoh comparison for the oolouring of the 'rothe Dame,' mnoe sht 'put out* every Woman hi her neighbourhood as effectually as a fine Bubens puts out the pictures that Surround it. Ferrand decided that he must somehow -5bntrtve to make acquaintance with this new tod brfflifmt ' specimen,* whioh, with the tinourof tne true naturalist, he longed to tfdd to Ids collection of types. Fortune eoomoa to favour his derign, for the jlBB evening at dinner 'he found: 2 himself geated opposite to the apparition of the morn ing. She was looking radiant in a flame dblourbd1 sflk blouse, and her hair glittered Ufa spun fold in the gaslight. By her side Mi an Infirm-loGkingoid lady, whom she ? nfldnjssed as Aunt Harriet, and to whom rfie appeared to be a kind and attentive niece. - * AH put on forefoot/ thought Ferrand as he notloed her pretty manner to the invalid. ' 'Kndh atftentfric the poor old tiling would . get if they were dining alone.' ^he- passing of amain brought him a few words from the 'rothe Dame.'. . 'Had he jnst arrived?

And what mattes all the more ooufosing was that there Were times when the Bed Lady was quite as frivolous as his heart oonld desire. She wore the most astounding oostumes, kept an ever lengthening string of admirers tn tow, and was the life and soul of allthe mtertainments that Kaatanienbad oould afford. * How you do enjoy yourself P he said one night, half reproachfully , as, flushed and panting after the maddest of German galops, ahe dropped'lnto a ohalr at his side; 'Why notP she adced, a faint shadow coming over her radiant faoei 1 life is short -«^nd very preoaricMiSi' - . -i * Is that any reason for'fritteringhaway ^ he' asked sev^e^-.

Day by day Ferrand grew more plqosd, interested, bewildered by the ohameleou lika creature, who Seemed to have as many ohaoges of character as of oosfcaoM.

As sonn as Hs holiday was over Ferrand went1 baok to England and wrote a bopk.
