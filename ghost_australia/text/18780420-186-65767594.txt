If yon do not reach your conch-boasted bosteby soon, not only my horse, but I, myself, shall be utterly exhausted,' and the speaker grew a shade whiter and reeled forward in hie saddle as he spoke. It was nearly the close of a sultry Sep tember day, and the ™™ was rfwfcing, fifee a ball of fire, behind ?*«* -?«*»»??. mountains in upper Lorraine. The riders had been in the saddle for many hoars, bat one of them, a middle-aged, sturdy-looking peasant, seemed hardly the worse for the fatigue. His com panion was a tall man, young and handsome. He wore a military dress, and carried a small raw| fniwfa iifianmhiinp a despatch-box, slnnir in front of his saddle. He looked like an F-igK«jii^aTi with his blonde beard and deep bine eyes : but his dashing, soldierly seat in tiu saddle had been learned in many a, wild charge over the battle-field. Jacques shook his head. 'What would m'siea have?'1 he asked with a helpless shrug. 'The horses axe good beasts, none better, but what horse can travel from dawn to sunset without failing? It is only wonderful that they do not fall by the road side, and then— what would Maxtre Pierre say ? As for the village of St. Etaenne, it is seven £Ood miles by the road — five, as the crow fiies ; what would m'sieu have? It ts destiny.'

'Ah, but «n*«ifw mistakes,11 said Jacques, eagerly. 'They belong to the French nobksBC, these XFOrvaks. It is a smgolar family 1 but the last Baron fell at Sedan for France, m'sieu.

So, bearing of some demoiselle in Paris, tie child of an old friend and grand dame, who was of a marriageable age, she farts on a journey to arrange the affair, leaving the Baron to his own pursuits at tf»p ^?at**?'.

She was always hoping to get better, and so would not send for her son : it was bad weather, too : any way, monsieur month aftw *'flnth passed, and she did not return. At last, one day, tiie servants at tiie chateau were amazed to receive instructions from then- master to make ready the state apartments, for he was about to bring home a bade. Does monsieur Monsieur did. 'It was not the bride for whom his mother had Ap^jftHJ him,' continued Jacques ; **bnt m Engifeh girt, whom ^* 3i^J met *m^ £aHen in lore with at the little village of St Wifimp. Same young Northern A-mni— m. who had been travelling with friends— their governess, it was laid; and she fell 31 at St. Etjenne and had to be left there. Bat oh, m'aeu, she was beautiful as a dream ! The country people say her hair was like ai dory about her head, and her eyes had the look of the Madonna's. No wonder the Baron wor shipped her; they thought he would hare died for her.' ' What came of it !' 'It was months before Madame returned to Lorraine. Perhaps news bards slowly to Paris, or the Baron kept his secret well; at least, when Madame returned she did not know Hut a daughter-in-law awaited ber. When her carriage drove op, ihe servants were an in the hall, and the Baron met his mother. He kissed her, and led her up to where the young Baronne stood, blushing and trembling. It seemed as if the mother divined what was to follow, for she cast an envious glance at die young lady, and said in her most insulting, haughty voice, ' Whom hast thou here, Philippe ? a new housemaid ? She is too pretty for the place !' It is said that the Baron answered her back with a spirit haughty as her own. ' Von are quite right in fhinl-jnjT her too beanlifnl for any but the reigning place, mofher ; this is MT wife !' Bold of him, was itnot, monsieur?' 'Oh, then, m'sieu, the storm broke. The old Baronne raised her hands and erased them both; she cursed the babe unborn. Her words were avfoL 'Hay the habe be as hft*n*jfnl and more witless than yoa ate V she said to the wife; 'may it show as little af&ction; for its own flesh and blood as my son has shown for ?'**.. and may no blessing fall on the D'Orvales until a stranger comes from a diiTtwit land and bears it away from its fore-fathers1 home V ' *'She must have been a. carious old lady. Go on,' ** The young Baronne fell like a dead person upon the floor, and Madame swept away to her own apartments. It was doubtless the influence .of the evil eye which prevented the Baron from seeing how his poor young wife pined away after that night. And at last she £ave birth to a -*fM, and died. Two months after, the old Baronne was found dead in her bed, m--? rumours came abroad that there were strange black marks around her throat, as if the fiend incarnate had come to claim his own.' The half -moednlous enule witii which the stranger had listened throughout increased to one of mockery. 'What became of the chOdr he asked. ' Did the Fiend and the old Baronne spirit that away, too?'

They &ad; been going at ojrite a slow pace, for the road was a bad one, and evidently seldom travelled. But as they tamed abruptly to the left, the tall grey turrets with their sugar-loaf peaks rose clearly before them, above the tzees and the underhush which impeded liwnr progress. An tabey came 'It's afllnuwft eaual to a piluy of the ft* ' y tales,' «='-* be, alfwid, speaking in Bngiim. increanJity, I might fancy that it held tint sleeping Princess of the Wood.' ' Comment, m'sieu?' said Jacques, catch ing the words imperfectly., and fancying him self addressed. 'How do you propose to enter?' was the traveHerB answering question and again he found hiwwjrff wondering whether he should not find a trumpet suspended to the gate-post, upon which he must blow a peal loud enough to iralnpn tie sleeping Fpha^itayrts. uncertainty himself. His tired master rode forward to the gateway. 'Not there, nfsien,' cried Jacques, in dismay. 'There is another gate somewhere behind the chateau; or we might get through tie hedge, perhaps, or over the well: but we must leave our hones outside. Jean-Marie would never do to anger la Mere Margot by riding in on horseback.' Barfing 'lum^ jyrd gvH?ng over tine tangled mass of grass and overgrown weeds as they best could.

What is to be done T Upon which T^p1*^*' question, the afaameer impatiently seized the half bidden handle of a beO, *nd Bounded a loud peaL Before ite echoes had died away, a voice rose behind ebon. 'Be off! What dost thoa want* We can have no EtxacgleEB about the i luti m dX-rrale.' Just beyond the gate stood an old, withered-op woman. She looked like a bit of a, vixen, bat yet her black, bead-like eyes had x gleam in them that was not altogether unkindlv; on her arm was a basket hal&dl; of wood which she had evidently been fiillua uig. 'U Mere Margot,' began Jacques, re moving ius ha^ ami spealcnig in aconaliBtoxy tone, 'I am Jacques Virot; dost tiiou not remember?

'Hump!' said she. 'Who are you, that you can know anything of us? Blonde and ing — von are a. Prussian !' 'Whether I am or not,' said the stranger, disregarding ber fierce tone, 'I fought for Erance at Sedan.' The woman's face softened. ' He is too young to lie while looking in my eyes,' she muttered. 'But— no! why should I do it? Go to St. Ermne for your lodgings.' Just then, a dear, bird -like voice was heard humming a song upon the otiier side of the gate. Margot gave an uneaBy glance in the direction whence it came. 'I tell you, sir, we can't shelter you. Jacques Tirot, begone. How dare you come here ; don't you know this place is sacred ?' T .iftjwg her hands to enforce obedience, the stranger, utterly exhausted, fell heavily to the ground. At we eame minMaw* the gals was opened, and a slight, beautiful girl appeared. ' Where's your key that you Ehould ring, Margot? I bear Jean abusing you for for getemgit. And ? what is all this J Who are they?' the sweet, bell-like voice filtered; the young girl drew back. Inspiration seized on Jacques. He resolved to appeal to her. 'For the love of Heaven, Mam'iseUe la Baronne, let me carry him in ! B he has not some brandy and his wound is not .dressed, be will die. See, be has fainted '.' '? Bah ! he is a Prussian,' cried Margot ; 'let him die.' But the litUe Baronne said not a. word ; she glided towards him. ?' He will not die,' she said, nodding her head, after long scrutiny of tiie senseleBs form in Jacqness arms. 'But he will be company for me, and I am tired of the lone liness. Margot. tell Jean-Mane to come here, and h*»lp cany fr*™ in to rin- chateau.' She gave the order in cold, imperious tones, very angular in one so young as seventeen. Jacques looked at her in open moutiied admiration. Margot began to grumble; but tike Baronne quietly repeated her order, and Margot hobbled oft; scridingas she went. When he came out of his long swoon, he opened bis eyes upon surroundings that, at first, completely bewildered him. He lay upon a wide aofa, in the centre of a 1-upe, gloomy- looking saloon ; Jacques was *'*»*?''% over him ; and an old man, who kept up an incessant *-Jl'Tig, in a species of monotone, was applying some sort of cooling lotion to his shoulder — Jean-Marie, no doubt. As bis senses came back, his eyes lingered long and -ronderingly upon the huge old fire-place, vhere a handful of wood was burning, and in front of which sat a strange, lovely figure.* She wore a long robe of black velvet, quaint in style. The sleeves were wide and trimmed with costly lace ; and there was a bit of the same yellow lace around tiie fair white throat. Down over this dead black dress floated an exquisite nww of long, waving hair ; tfi*- hafr that is golden in tgmfight, and tare brown in tiie shade ; tiie face was oval, with delicate, pearly skin, and ehort, red lipe, and tie eyes were hazel-brown, beneath dark and beantifuUy-pencfled eyebrows. Yet, with all its exquisite *f'''*-y. there was a curious want in tiie face; it was almost such a one as Undine's may have been before she gained her BooL She was sitting wifli her head resting ra her hand; but when the sick man epoke, rose and came towards him. 'He has bine eyes,' she murmured to her self, in tiie amased tone of a discoverer. 'I did not think they would be so handsome.' 'I speak French,' said he. unable to help a boyish blnsfa at this remark. 'Very good,' she said, blushing too, but not allowing hexself to be disturbed. 'I never saw blue eyes before ; all the peasants have black ones. I thought you spoke only German. Are yon a Prussian *** ' I am an EngUshman, but my mother was French, and zny sympathies ate with the French. My name is Henry Arthur Living ston.

'And titey do not provide you with another !' he exclaimed, asking the question in ish^T f *'*WPTiyiit. ** Do you mean my guardian — tite man of business in Bans? He does not know. What would you?

'I will have it here, with monsieur,'' she aaid tersely ; and Hargot disappeared. 'What did you say you were called?' began Lucille, curiously. 'My name is Harry (or, as you would call it, Henri) Livingston.' ?? Uveenstone,' she said, stnmblmg over it. 'Itutoo long; I shall call you Menaeur Henri.

But she proved herself enough lite ordinary mortals to give hhnscnpof delicinnriy tnade conee, which Margot brought in ; ana when be explained his inability to hold it because of bis wounded shoulder, she gravely seated her self on a. chair at his side, cup in band. ' Never mind, I will give it to you from the spoon ; I did so once to papa, when he wasm.' There was nothing for it but acquiescence. So Livingston Bubnutted to have part of the coflee tanckle down bis neck witiKmtamumur, and wondered whether Hebe had administered nectar to tin1 cods in a lifrp enibarrassiiif Jacques was in a dawd condition * not only had he obtained entrance to the chatean in a very unexpected manner, bit here was la petite ft'***.**- actually helping m'skai with her own bands, as beautiful as an angel, but oae of those fearful dttrvales, nerertitdess. 'They say that madame'e ghost walks here at night, —the Madonna preserve us '.' *hnog*t he. Jacques crossed himself devoutly, and in cluded m'eieu in the sign, by way of foiling any bad spirits who might be hovering around. But tiie traveller began to look very pale and exhausted, and Laucille wished }**'} good night. Margot came in, very cross, and told Jean-Marie that tiie eeartieman's bed was * ready, and that he had better go to it. In tiie ''''''E Harry Livingston found himself too ill to move; tiie wound had been too lung without attention, «w. his ride had aggcavated it terribly. Jacques went over to St. Etaenne, and brought from thence the only doctor thatthe little village could boast; but he proved equal to the emergency. Being too cautious to use many medicmeB, he con fipftfl friHiwrif -tn irwymg Anam tf** fww Mllfll threatened J livingeton ; and nature, left to bereelf, lirought the patient tfanm^i in eafete in tiie course of a few days. The doctora pjfftfpr. a benevolfint m«H-1lr ired dt**'P. I'unit* over often, and gave much countenance to the yonng Banmne. After that came tiie days of convalescence; weary enough titey would hive been to tiie sick young man but lor his littie hostess. She was at once tiie most fotytffopg, fairy like vision that Livingston had ever seen. He had loiown very many T ''^iiliFul wmnen— tbe loveliest and besMncd of bis own cbann ing countzywomen— but they lacked tiie sabtie, curioue attraction of Lucuie. Shewas such a child ; all simplicity, npsophiatacjUiou, and gnUeless innocence. Passion vraa un known to her; love had never touched her breast. Knowing nothing of conventionalism, in her intercourse with uvincstone she was free as she could have been with a brotitar sittingby bis sofa half the day, and *»llr™r with him by the hour together. Of her dead father she spoke in reverent, *Jimr»njr teems ; she gloried in his patriotism, and in his fclltiwr for Prance ; but of actual love, even for him, Livingston half doubted whether she knew tite meaning. AH tiie auHime, heroic side of a, woman's ohanwtfirsppnifd wanting; or else it slept: she was an elf, a fairy, a, sprite— or, in less lover-like phrase, a careless, lovely 'Monsieur Henri,*' J^rH\e would call, standing under his window, when he began to get about, 'comedown and see me feed the r»g'»w Jean-Marie has gone to tiie village, Margot is in her kitchen, Jacones sees tot£e horses-and for me, I an. lonely. Hasten then.'' And Harry would yugiigs down the lone stairs as far as his half-restored strength would permit, to U met half -way by Locale, who would insist upon aidinc bun with her slender arm. All scenes were not so !*«-«'?* as tins, *, however. Lucille would sometimes ask Iivingston to tell her of his own home and country: and although his stories of it and of his life tiiere seemed to bold a, stange cbann for her^ she would manifest a curious jealousy of them. Let him look a trifle more tired than usual, and her lovely Irps would curl in vexation ; she would irritate him, with suggestions that be was sufteriiig from ennui and mal dn pays, and threaten to leave him and neveroome back to the salon any more. And then IivingBton would implore and coax her until he saw the usual half-sweet, half arch smile come back to the lovely face, and a truce would be proclaimed between titem. But one memorable morning, when Locale carried this other Car, Livingston adopted an entirely different line of tactics. That is, if he thonghtof tactics at mlL Lucille announced that she had lessons to learn (she was always talking of tiie studies that the death of ber governess had left incomplete), and that she must leave monsieur for tiie rest of the day. Upon which, to her great surprise, monsieur responded with stately courtesy that beahoold be pained to think of detaining her from her learned researches, and tint he had the honour to -rah Mademoiselle la Baronne a very good morning. *' I have wasted too much time emb van.

She was frightened. 'Oh, take me away, Henri, to yonr own land. I am afraid no more of your ice and snow ; you win be tiiere and Lucille hippy.' A distant noise befnyed the present danger. Livingston sprang to his feet so suddenly that pain wrong a faint groan from his lips. ^rWhatisit,He5rir she asked, in alarm. In a low, hasty whisper be begged of her to be still.

'Hold!' she cried, as the fearless courage of her long tine of warlike ancestors shone m every line of the girl's fane, and made the foremost soldier pause, involuntarily.
