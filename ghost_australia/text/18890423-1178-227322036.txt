YESTERDAY. Yesterday is dead And lies at rest. No breathing stirs The white-robed breast ; The groanB and sobbing Are noshed at bet, Thanks he to Heaven 1 Bnoh pains are past. Seek not to rouse Its nhqniet ghost; Con jars no phantom Of what is lost ; Come away aoftiy. And make ho moan, Leaving thy perished hope Dead and alone. â€” sobibnbr's. .
