THE HAUNTED MAN. HE had a haggard, haunted look, id is face was pale and thhi; Together you might pin his cheeks With any common pin. His hair hung long and lank and limp, His ears hung so likewise, Despair glared di-mally from out The caverns of his eyes. Could this be he whom we had seen, A week ago but one, »So merry that he might have been The Deity of Fun ? We questioned him "Now tell to UB, And tell us straight and true, The way and wherefore of this sad— This fearful change in you ? " Hast killed a constable in jest, Or robbed a bank ?—why so Have others, yet don't carry round A secret weight of woe."j " Ah, no," he sighed, " would that were all, All—or at least all-most, No," here he tremblingly looked round, " I'm haunted by a ghost. " A ghost of most blood- curdling look, Shaped not unlike a stork, That in its bony bosom bears A carving kuife and fork." " Gheer up, old man," we said, but here He shuddered and broke loose— ' Avaunt!" he cried, " I slew thee not, Thou ghastly Christmas gorse."
