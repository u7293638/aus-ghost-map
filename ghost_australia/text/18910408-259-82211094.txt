A. Gliost In Sydney. One of IIiobb mysterious visitors known as a ghoBt appeared some short time ago in one o( our suburban streets; (cepacia the Evening Xewt of the lOtli inst), completely demoralising the local polioe tone, who made himself scarce in a manner never previously eclipsed in this part. It appears that a visitor from a southern dis triot who was etnyiug with some friends in the suburb referred to, imbibed so heavily, or in other words, got on the spree so desperately, that ho began" to see anaiks," as they -say in the country prcBs. This attaolc of delirium tremens became BO severo one night that he forced hiB way out of the house, despite his friend's attempt to keep him in, and wrapped only in a white Bheot he made for the street. The man was an educated sort of fellow, and muoh given to amateur Bhskesperian recitals, and now in bis temporary insanity ho bad reason enough to feol that, wrapped fn a white sheet, he made a good representation of a ghost' in " Ifamlot." The friend utterly powerless to interfere, followed the unfortunate man on to the street, in a hope of being able to got the assistance of a policeman to bring him home. It was about 2 o'clock in tho morning, and still dark, when a policeman did appear, and righlAhcad in a nnwt lonely part of the stieet. It must have been a superstitious " bobby," for at the sight of the unearthly rover ho turned to hie heels and fled for his life. The .ghost instantly behaved in a most unghostly manner, for it pursued llobort with a desperate endea vour to take him into custody. A public-house lamp-post saved the oonstable, for it puljod the ghost up with a abort turn, and lie knocked for nearly lmlt-an- liour to get in. It was just on daybreak before the spiritual man was got back to homo. Whether the " bobby" is run ning yet is not known; but tho poor ghost is dead, and a well-known town has lost a woll-luiown man.
