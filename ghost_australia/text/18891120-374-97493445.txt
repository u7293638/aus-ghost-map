"May It please your LordshipWe, the teachcrs and children of the Mitchell Church of England Sunday School, desire to accord to you a hearty welcome on this the occasion of yonr first official visit amongst us. _ Of your ability and zeal and your un tiring efforts iu advancing the work of our beloved Church we -are 'already well acquainted, and we feel that with, your increased opportunities of superrisiug-'aud organising, and with God's' blessing upon your labors we shall.see a.systematic and solid growth in the development and ex tension ef the church in the diocese. " In presenting you with this address, we would assure yon~ that we are not ignorant of our own responsibilities. One important result of Sunday School work, we believe, means (in proportion to the size of the school) a corresponding number of candidates for the Apostolic rite of Confirmation; so that one and all we may be led ou step by step to know and to value rightly the blessings with which God has surrounded as his children through the ministration of the "Church. In conclusion we pray that the' blessing of God may ever be with you, and that you may long be spared to labor in the great and holy cause to which we -know you have devoted your life's best energies. "Again offering you a hearty welcome we beg to subscribe ourselves your Lordship's faithful and obedieut children in Christ Jesus.—Jane W. Lethbuibge, Superin tendent. "Teachers: Jane M. Lethbridge, Lily A. Wright, Nelly A. Baniford. Teresa J. WrighCFrauces C.
