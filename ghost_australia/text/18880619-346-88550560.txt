The back xloor was forced open with an axe, which was lying in the yard, and then the bedroom door lock was forced open in the same manner. The whole house was ransacked, and in the bedroom £3 3s., and about £2, the proceeds of the sale of the l['nr (!r;i, were stolen. A neighbour saw the door open about 9 o'clock, and thinking that the officer had forgotten to close it, she went and did so. The police were informed of the matter, but no clue has as yet been obtained. A Ghost.—For several.nights past some foolish person has been acting the ghost in Victoria street, between High and l'anton streets. Several females nnd children have been terribly scared at the sight of the apparition. A number of boys who were not so superstitious determined to watch for him, armed with pistols loaded with slugs and siltpetre and other weapons, to give him a warm reception, but he did not come in sight.
