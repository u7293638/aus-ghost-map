'' ' ' ;''I ' !.:M': .'Tlier'e can1 har/jly bo 'a more, interesting subjecti'f6r study than the different- modes adopted' b'y our L'o^ii in addressing different classes of hearers. Of coutse 'His ' words had a future as 'ivell as a present^'applica tibn,' but in order, to' .unddrstaiid them aright, it is necessary that we should know something about tho .character, of., the persons' to ..whojrh they were in the first' place addressed. ' Tiike, for instance,' the Pharisees, of .whom, as we read, in St. Matthew (y. 20)J 'bur Lord said ' except your;, righ eouanfess' shall 'exceed, the righteousness ;6f the Scribes and Phari sees.' 'Now, wonderful as many of Christ's' sayings must have' sounded to many of his' hearers, we may feel almost certain thai;' nothing^ should .seem, more surprising to, tkem'.than. tliia saying about'tho rigliteoiis neas of the Pharisees.} It^puld sound very much as though, He'tiad's'aid ; that in f order to make1 water wet'it was necessary to add something liquid to it -, a condition which it alrea'dyj possessed.,' In fact in saying1 that it was needful'to 'exceed the righteous ness.o^the, Phariaee.it was almost as much, as 'to'demarid a rigliteousne'ss greater ' than the laW'of'd-i-id1 itself— something' far in excess, rpf .anything the .world had. j ever dreamt'of. 'Indeed, it would.be very . diffi cult, to point to any class of!;inen, at' any period of the world's history who surpassed the Pharisees in righteousness'. They were eminently pious, and, .were , habituaL and 'persevering in ' their .'.'.prayirsY they w«re charitable, and made a practice of bestowing much alms on the poor 'and needy ;,they were minutely just and exact, in all , their dealings, so that theyjeven' tithed the herbs which grew' in their gar dens,: the. mint, anUe, and cummin. ,, And. that th'iJy were hospitable 'and courteous, we have sufficient proof in the life of Cliriat, as we often hear of their' having invited Him. to their houses.,. St. Paul^wihp.de-j scribes himself as having been a'Pharisee of the Pharisees, bears witnessjtp the fact, that they were mosc exact. It' is tlierefpre j little to be, wondered. at ' that when. 'the people wished to describe a' holy matij they could find. ,np .better, way. of, doing so, .than by sayingf'that'he w^s' 'a iPharisee. , ' '.Thus in speaking of 'Abraha^.'the ancient^ Jews described him asa 'Pharisee' of ^ love, .'Job,', as a Pharisee of fear.' ; ' To 'such' an extent' indeed was .this opinion, carried, that an old story tells' us' that ''the Jews'believed ?that. if, put of , all Jthe world .^only t]vo( mqn.. were'tb reach :heaverf, the. one would be &' Pharisee and the other a Scribe.' (Trapp's Com.) .- ;1v,- ciG'S .', ';r; r.l -1% O.b '?Xn the ;facei then o£' thisu consensus^cif; opinion:as'.to,.the righteousness of ihePlnt- risces, how are we to account for our Blessed Lord'sAverdict ?,.' 1'here canlb'a:;bufc two answers : The first, which no believer in C.hfist'eaffi'adiriitj'withgut bl&sphemy;^js thaii''eur''Iio«iildst -'His Vsual tone of A6elf icoinmand .and gentleness ;. or secondly, ,that' though' Christ' ' accused '''ttie'in0 of (hypocrisy, he did not.do,^o,in the prdinavy. sense bf',the 'word,' not;1 as' inbs^ 'pebplo' juriderstarid 'thewbrd. To say that the sect ;of the Pharisees was composed 'entirely of 'worldly formalists .would .he, not .only, uu fair and uncharitable — it i, would be. (more it would be'untru^! 'Th'e'very origin1 of 'the sect proves this.: it, arose from the evident jwish of ' the Jewish people 'to:]'' seek the' tL'ord' God of vlsraelV and 'tp: dq; thist- tlie, better they 'chose the , way appointed' by ,Gbd hims'eW-^-theiTribe of Levi,frpm which to choose their leaders. The name Pharisee'. or Perishin meant 'separated.-' and each' member of the, sect, vowed in the presence of at least three other members that lie would be true to -their -laws. '..The '.founda- tion upon -which ' the sect depended jWasa', strict obedience to' traditional' or' br'al law; as well as to the ,w.ritten law. .. They. main: taine'd that in addition to, the .five books of Moses, there were ' commands which had been delivered to the Children of 'Israel :by him by word of mouth. In the ' Mishna,' which forms part- of the Talmud, there is this sentence,'MoBes received the (oral) law from Sinai, and delivered it to Joshua,1 and Joshua to the elders, and the elders to the prophets, and the prophets ;.to the -men of the great Synagogue.' So that, you see, it was with the deliberate intention of pre serving and keeping alive the tradition of God's spoken law that these Pharisees were s'et apart. And it is undoubted that they in a certain degree fulfilled their office. It was amongst the Pharisees that the glorious ideas were /developed about the Messiah.the kingdom of heaven ,the immor tality of the soul, the world to come and many other matters. It was the Pharisees who trained such men as the celebrated; Hillel, and the just and devout' Simeon; Zachariaa, ! : who was; righteous .before God ; Gamaliel, the. teacher of Saul^, of Tarsus ; licodemusj'whb came to Jeraa1 by night and who assisted Joseph of Arimathea (another probable Pharicee) to bury our Lord ; Paul, the Apostle of the Gentiles — all these were Pharisees, and doubtless there were very many moro noble men be longing to this sect. We are told, more over, that some of the Pharisees believed in Christ ; may we. not hope that after the descent of the Holy Ghost many more believed in him ? It is clearly evident that there was very much in the .Pharisees, both in their system and practice, which was extremely admirable and praiseworthy j it is there fore all the more necessary to understand why our 'Blessed Lord so sternly rebuked them. ?-, Now, it seems quite clear that the chief, if hot'the only striking' error of these men was their feelf-oonfldence. They ? trusted in themselves. This was at the bottom of all their eyil-dbing and living. Hence they assumed much importance, took credit for their good , deeds, treated : contemptuously those who, differed from them, neglected all efforts to reclaim sinnerp, and disregarded the Bpiritof the law while they paid a strict obedience to the mere letter of it, and at the saine time with the desire of appearing righteous before men, they paid an undue attention to external acts and cerr-tnoriies. Such wet e the Pharisees of our Lord's day, or at least such were;. too many of them, and so he accuses them of rejecting the counsel of 'God against 'themselves ; of making the Word of God of none effect by their traditions ; of appearing outwardly righteous while inwardly foul'; of shutting the kingdom of heaven against them who would enter in, whilst not going in them selves ; of performing acts of devotion to be seenlof men; of binding heavy burdens on nieh's consciences, etc. These were grave charges and well merited 'the strong con ? damnation of, our Lord. ... . ? ,. _ ... ?-?;.. ',In .thus trying, to cause you to realise the ' pnaitibn of these' Pharisees, my Pbject has' \ been to find out in-'what way our righteous i ness is to exceed theirs., , . , As I have shown; you, in many; ways these inen were, estim^ able characters, arid apart from their arro gant self 'sufficiency,' there|was much that j was admirable , in .them and. worthy of :in : vitiation.. .Our . righteousne.BS in order to. ' excel 't'neir'a must do so iri'mpre ways than' lone. (I) In its truth' and sincerity; for ?' are we not told.-.that God desires .truth in 'the in ward parts ;, then, (2) our righteoua inW must exceed theirs in' its' 'extent and integrity, that is to say ; it' must include all God's commandments, and not merely thpBe which we, choose to observe, and further it means that we have i rib right to ''sin that grace may abound' onby ?thinking that because- we keep one commandment, strictly that, that is there fore an excuse for our sinning in other ways;' A third way in which we are to ? excel the. Pharisees is. (3) in the lowliness andwhumility of, our/righteousness ; they i claimed a reward or praise for what they i did ; but we are bidden when we have done [anything,; to- say ,--?
