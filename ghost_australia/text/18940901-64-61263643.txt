Three years later the struggle botween the Kingites and the Government commenced, known as the Waikato war, in which 10,000 troops were engaged. The natives, who were driven out of the Waikato, occupied a position of sullen isolation for 20 years, but latterly the rela- tions were of e. friendly character, and their country was freely open to European inter- course. Tawhiao accepted a pension from the Government some two years ago ; but his followers disapproving, he surrendered it, and returned the money, thus maintaining his independence to tho last. Only a small body of natives had latterly acknowledged the authority of the king, and it is not thought' likely that any successor will he appointed.
