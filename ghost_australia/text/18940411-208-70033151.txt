UPPER BEACONSFIELD. BY TODEA AFRICANA. If there is one thing more than another that, climatically speaking, we pride ourselves on being free from, it is fog. Morning after morning the sun rises clear and crisp as if he had just had his morning tub after a good night's rest, instead of doing the eternal ceaseless sleepless round that he is doomed to. Of course I know the wise- acres will have it that it is WE who do the ground tour, whilst Sol just turns on his heel—I mean axis—but "you needn't be so — particular" as the sailor justly remarked to one of his auditors, who officiously inquired how, in that heroic encounter with the shark, he was happily able, at the critical moment, to whip out his jack- knife and give the brute his quietus ; when according to his own showing the incident happened whilst he was out bathing. The moral of which is that if some poetical license were not permitted, life would not be worth living—at least to the story-teller. pardon me for so specifically pointing it out, as I was afraid that from the haziness of my style the application might after all be only mist. But really you cannot call the etheral sub- stance which has to a greater or less extent wrapped us round for the last few days, by any such vulgar name as fog. At night, when asleep in the gully, it looks like the ghost of a great snow-drift, solid enough to hide all but the hill tops on the further side, but on the slope nearest us proclaiming it's spectral nature by allowing the weird forms of gaunt gum trees to loom larger than life through the veil of vapour. The morning comes, and kissed by the Solar rays the mass begins to move in billowy waves, until the rising tide has reached our own particular standpoint, but the flood in which we are submerged is not a fog— oh no! We are only in the clouds— that's all. I, have been there, and the INFLUENCE—Sir, remains.
