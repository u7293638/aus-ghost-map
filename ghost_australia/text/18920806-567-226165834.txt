A MAN OFF. In the small provincial town of Battleton dwelt a worthy shoemaker who bad gained "a more than local celebrity by bis skill in mani pulating the pieces on the magic squares, and It was no uncommon occurrence for our friend— . James Jones by name— to be matted by, tomb ambitions knight-errant anxious to ' test bin abilities at the game ; and many n baxd/fonght oarcie nas come oa in we utue room Desma nae " cobbler's " shop, occasionally, we are afraid to say, to the neglect of a customer's debilitated understandings. One foggy afternoon in dull November, .ham tag lingered rather long over his afternoon pipe, Jamie was startled out offals ordinary equanimity by a somewhat peremptory knocking in the shop. Hastily lying down his " silent' partner, he'hnrried into the plaoe to find a stranger standing at the counter, upon which ' be ted placed a traveller's case. "Good afternoon," shid Jamie, thinldqg"' It was somebody on hostess bent— draughts 'put then being tbe thought farthest from his mind. . "Good afternoon," replied the stranger: " have I tbe pleasure of speaking to Mr. Jones f " .You have, sir." WeIl,Pm a stranger to tbe town, as doubtless yon will perceive S and noticing a draughts-board in tbe puce where I had happened to drop in for dinner, I inquired if there was anybody in tbe town who could play a good game, and after some further conversation was referred to you. I have an hour or two to spare, and should be glad to speod it in a game with you if yon can make it convenient.

" Well, I anticipate no difficulty in defeating you," continued tbe stranger, in a grandiloquent manner, twirling the carefully wared ends of his loxuriant black moustache the while, " / haveneverbem defeated. "I generally allow our fellows one man off to start with, and I trill give yon the same odds," he coolly added. Whatever Jamie's feelings may have been at" tbe stranger's cool audacity inbffering him the odds, he did not give expression to them," but quietly invited bim into the back room, at the some time requesting the favour of bis visitor's name, which was somewhat hesitatingly given as " Alphonso Boscele." " Evidentlya foreigner," thought Jamie, as nonplussed nt thehighsonndingname,he meekly led the way into the back room, Don Alphonso majestically striding behind. Jamie soon had the board and men placed before them. "Ah! A nice board and set of men," re marked Don Alphonso, as ho took the Blaok side and removed a man off square 12. " I think we had better start with level pieces," said Jamie ; " I don't think there is a player in the world that will stand any cbanoe . against me with a man off" " Ob ! We'll see about that by and by. Have you travelled much ?" " Well, I've knocked about a little bit in my time." " Very good ! So have I," Don Alphonso carelesslv remarked in his off-hand manner, to which by this time Jamie was becoming quite accustomed. "I see you smoke. Can yon pro cure any good cigars down here?" "Oh yes, some capita! penny ones," re sponded Jamie/ whilst the ghost of a smile flickered across his countenance. " Then I'll bet yon a couple of cigara you don't beat me," Baid tbe Don. " Just as yon please," replied Jamie. Thereupon Don Alphonso commenced the game, and tbe play proreeded steadily for some time, bnt as might be expected, the Don was in difficulties from the commencement, and very soon bad to resign, as gracefully es he could under the circumstances. A conple of really good cigars were procured at the loser's expense, and over the enjoyment of the fragrant weed the seoond game was com menced, with the fall complement of pieoes, the distinguished visitor being fain to acknowledge that in Jamie he ted met a foeman " worthy of his steel." Don Alphonso again took the Blacks and the game proceeded as follows : — Game No. 195.—" The Edinburgh." 9 — 13 11 — 15 4— 8 8 — 11 22 ... 18 18 ... 11 22 ... 18 22 ... 18 12 — 16 8 — 24 6 — 10 ' 1 — -. 5 24 ... 20 20 ... 11 18 ... 9 18 ... 9 8 — 12 7 — 16 5 — 14 5 — 14 27 ... 24 28 :.. 19 29 ... 25 23 ... 18 3—8 19 — 14 2—7 24 ... 19 25 ... 22 25 ... 22 Up to this stage the game ran on the same lines as the 17 th game in the Freeman- Barker match. Jamie perceived that his opponent was as familiar with the play as he htauelf was, to in stead of playing 26.. .22, a B Barker did, he varied with 23. ..18 as above, which if not quite » strong as Barker's, had the merit of putting the players on their own resources. The following ahows the position :— Blaok men — 7, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 16, White men — 18, 19, 21, 26, 30, 31, 32, Black to play, who continued 14 — 23 20 — 24 13—17 24 — 28 31 ...27 18... 14 14... 9 6(5) 2 16 (a) 20 10 — 17 17 — 21 27 ... 18 21 ... 14 9 ... 6 White wine ' (a) Don Alphonso studied long and oarcfaily over this move, he was evidently not satisfied with his position ; 13 — 17 instead, would have secured an easy draw. . (5) At this stage the Don took np his bat and bag, and regretting that time would not allow of further play, he hastily departed, and Jamie aaw him no more. Jamie's friends declare that the visitor waa a woll-knowo Cockney expert, whose object ted been to take a " rise " out of the worthy shoe maker ; but Jamie, in the simplicity of bis . heart, and <he pride of victory, perhape,_atoutly maintains! t.Kafc hp WAS ft PDbL llVe Rtmnttth dflDa and his friends continue to avoid undeceiving him.
