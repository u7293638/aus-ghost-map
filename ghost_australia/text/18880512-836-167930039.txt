Now, although' the Seeress and tliis lady were old friends, they came to disagree about this ' occult' -business. Among other things, there ' was some little . trouble about money.

She denounced ilad.une Blavatiky in the columns of the C/insiiim College Magazint, and vindicated the con trivance by which' the- joccult'. mysteries had beeo obtained. ..Further, she pub. lished a pamphlet ubder the .title of ' Some Account of My In tercourse .with Madame Clavattky,' in which the whole ' unvarnished story is put before the public.

Sinnett's room. The ceiling of this room was boarded, but* between the boards there was a s1it( sufficiently wide to permit & thick letter to slip through easily. To this trap & string was attached which ran along the garret,- passed through a hole, and hong behind -the dodr and cartatn of Madame Blaratsky's bedroom. Thus, i.by' pulling the string the tiap was lifted; the letter released, and, carried down by its own weight through the slit in the cciling, fluttered into the loom below,.. Xo^', let* us. see how- this ' occult' - |arrang^nent-^ worked. Uponjpage 120 of 'Thc^pc- cult eWorld' Mr. Sinnett says : — I was' sitting - talking to Madame ;B. in the ro^rn that had been allottedj-to me.

' It can easily lie conceived that her narrative as published, produced a considerable flutter ' amnng ihe *( muffs ' and '* domestic 'im-. brciles afori-said, not to mention the highly-^espcctable 'native and European gentlemen who had fallen, victims to the Mahatn'ia' devices.

' The pjeeross herself wrote from Paris in great distress, 'Oh, Madame- Con- lemb,' she. said, ' whit then, have' I done tot youf that you should try ;to ruin me 111 this way? Is it because 'for four years - jve lived - together, helping eacli otlier to meet the trials of ,:life,tand because;! I have Jefc. everything in .the house in-your hands',. saying to you con tinualljji ' lake whafclmoney you need/ that you seek to ruin me for life in the minds of those, who, when they turn their back ou me, will turn their back on yoii; firefl' , , . M Remember that if I was ? 20,000 times exposed, d&- iirted, and convicted of imposture, like the mediums, all that would indeed be. nothing ;to the cause, to truth.' When Herr Paulus made his confes sion before the conference of spiritulists, when He- proclaimed himself a frt'.ud, did theyi believe him ? Not in the least. Mr. CJyrus-,BrundeneI ' could not -admit the possibility of imposnre. ' Jly* friends, f; he^said, ' I; am certain that there is] now no doubt in any of our hearts. jiThe true Paul has gone from us — forja time only*, we bope— let. the shell, the shell ' (thby all felt an intjn-' 'ite contempt for th? shell) ' depart ;in peace. ||But as the -result of the teach ings and the- manifestations of our Paul, we stand. — wo stand, I say— upon . ihe Solid Iltjck.' : .
