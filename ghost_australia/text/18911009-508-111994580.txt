BOUND HAND a™ FOOT. BY THE AUTHOR OP ' THE MAID OP THE MARBLE HEART/' &c;, &c.; ; [Ali BIGHTS BESEBVED.] [Commecced in the Evening News of Saturday, Sept. 26.] PART I. CHAPTER XVI.— (Continued.) ' Sometimes with, me lie would harp on old times, and give expression to bitter accusations wliiclx showed her conduct had cut Mm deeply. ' This was on his little visits when we sat over the fire, and smoked our pipes in my old rootn — my little study, which I kept just as it was — a gun- Tack on the wall, with the pea-rifle still in it; which my father gave me on my twelfth birthday — ? fbhing rods in a corner — Pip's and mine hunting scenes from the Christmas Geaphic all round, aid Barbara's faded photograph in a frame 1 had cut for my self still hanging over the mantelpiece. ?' It was the room adjoining' Pip's bed room — his old bedroom which, he still used. It catches the first glint of the rising sun. Oh, for' the times — the many times when I've bounced in whistling at 5 o'clock in the morning— dashed a wet sponge on his handsome face, and five minutes later at the outside gone with him whooping down Fleetdeer Wood to the little trout stream, not brighter, nor fresher, nor freer, then, than my brother Pip's heart and mine. ' When we eat thus together talking of our old adventures, and jokes, and esca pades, and of old Aggy's Elbrado, Philip would seem more like his old self, and for blissful moments I used to have great hopes of him. Sometimes he would ask me to play the flute — -my old llute^— of which he made such fun when I was learn ing. That flute used to remind me almost more than anything of Barbara, but Philip did not know that I used to play it down at the cottage when I was the lover, to old. Aggy and Barbara. ' But of those little respites enough. When Philip's money was pretty nearly spent he made one desperate effort to pull.. himself together. Somehow — from his knowledge of German mostly — he got a continental agency for s, firstrate Din minster firm. - ?.'.-????'?? I 'I saw him off from England with reviving hopes. Change, and a fair salary, I and nothing round Mm to remind him of I the past, seemed to warrant them. I ' At first his letters were frequent and I pretty cheerful ; then there were long I intervals between' short unsatisfactory I notes, and I knew things were not as. they I should be. I ' Then came a latter in answer to a very I long one of mine. It was a kind letter, ac I knowledging, with more gratitude that* I was necessary, «om# money which I I had sent', feeling sure he was in want of I it. He spoke more about himself than he I had done before. . His allusions to Bar I bara were thrown off in his old careless I fashion. I could almost hear the short I bitter laughs which hid the intense feeling I lie would never show. ...??: I ''If Barbara Had been true,' I should I never have made such a fool of myself, I Prank— never have made you ashamed of I me, dear old fellow. But, never mind, I I stall marry byrand-bye, and be as steady I as Goldring's mill. Yes, I shall marry I Ecme becoming young1 lady, with a lot of I cash; but as for love, never! That little I Barbara, with her saucy smile and eyes I like stars; — cruel jilt as she was — has I cured me of that for ever.' I ' The very day after I got that letter I I met Barbara in jbhe street, Shewas'com I ing away from her paintanjg lesson with' I Miss Willersley, *nd I 'walked home with I her. I ' On that occasion I spoke 'to her more I earnestly abont her careless and expensive I way of life than. I had ever dJojte^efoiJB. I I upbraided her soundly for her pailt fotlyy I I talked a good deal about old Aggy, and I ften — I could hardly tell 'what made hato? I I reminded her with much bitterness of I aer Bhare in Pip'e folly and vice. . I ' When I had began to speak abont «k I penditure she 'had sjfcopped roe &»& jpluwva I me, not without some parade, the account* I of Hex housekeeping So* the laatJ anQUth^ 1 which in a very sloVenly vray »he hftd acttt-^ I ally kept, and they were1 economical. TbJbti. I she rihowed mo her Attempts at, palrti^g^ I and talked (alas J I had heard tite faX4 9*fea^ I before) of turning over * n« w 'leat, #nd I earning her living. * Painting I jMjfi&'jgfjr I cried, « and I wiH T^'ati^* ? ' '^ff ; ? ? .'.'????'-» ??-.??-.? ??? ' So, at first, I was somewhat appeased; but when — strange impulse — I began to talk of Philip, I became again so severe, that the weak, sweet creature— indeed she was still sweet— fairly broke down and sobbed. 'I was amazed at the good effect (as. I thought it) which I had produced. Tke next moment I was more amazed. . . '??Oh-, Frank^-'sher criedvj' «©asn}tyou stop him? Won't he change? I didn't know what I was doing. I didn't mean it, for I did love him, as I've never loved any one since, and I love him now.' ' When I left Barbara that afternoon, it was with the strange dazzling, foolish thought that X might yet save them both, ' I wrote to Philip the most earnestly remonstrating letter I ever wrote, and at the close actually told him all about my last Interview with Barbara. ' By. return of post, I received an answer —a letter full of new courage and resolve -^-in the first page about himself, and four pages of talk about Barbara. ' For the next two months similar let ters came and went, sometimes twice a week, and meanwhile I watched Barbara like a detective. I was- more than, satis fied— I was elated. She seemed a different woman. ' At the end of two months Philip came home. I met him at the station. I saw his face at the open window — ruddy, brighT, aiid smiling. ''' It 'was my own old brother, Pip. But I scarce dare look at him. The very glance which I had longed for stabbed me. For only that very day had I beard the ^news which I was bound to tell him. Barbara was engaged to Mr. Willersley, and the wed ding-day was fixed. ' The rest may be told briefly. Philip never saw Barbara at her home after she was married (it had been better for him if he had), but. he saw her often elsewhere. ~ ** I was anxious enough — 'now , mostly for my brother j but little did I , anticipate the sad: termination of. the .clandestine meetings, which seemed so accidental. ? 'The last time 'I saw Philip was the evening when Mr. Willeraley'a valuable paintings were in Mb room. He was in high spirits, but of a kind T did not like. He had just come in for £200 from a great number ot rotten shares, which by some accident or trick of the brokers had sud denly attained a value. ' The ^pictures entirely escaped xny iniixd afterwards, but I remember how Philip pointed to them with a laugh, and said, he had picked them up for nothing. 'It seems Barbara had simply made a convenience of his rooms j he knew no more about pictures than I do, and Barbara confessed, in that bitter outcry . against Algernon Brinklough, that ? ehe alone was guilty. Phflip would not eyen suspect a theft. The seainp irJio bought the pictures, or, rather, «tole them, doubtless carried through the whole transaction ; and Algernon Brinklough was the man who made this possible. He had introduced her to the thief; when he wished her to rob her husband for him. I don't know, but I feel certain he-even %ot his vile commission out of that transac iXon. ' - . , ? '' ?

' Following that I received three letters almoBt facsimiles of it — posted on the same day— doubtless to remove the torture which the $-Por fellow felt in imagining any miscarriage in the post. ' So I came to Barbara's wretched- house. As to what, brought Algernpn Brinklough, I can only give one horrid gueBS. ' Barbara wrote to him, and like a serpent^nay, a 4 Judas — he came disguised as a friend, to betray her, perhaps, in very reality, with a kiss,:../ .'?'-?..?.' 'That I could have been suspected never even crossed my mind. When Barbara begged me never to enter Mr, Willersley*s house again — saying he was jealous of my influence— I thought -him (he has for given me) a silly, jealous pld man. I be lieve now that prohibition of Barbara's was a cunning blind both to me and to her husband. .Would $o heaven he had been ten times, more jealous of me and of everr -me else.' CHAPTER XVIL— Opt in ihe Sarow. After L* Martin had told me ijis story, , -we looked put together again on the cold', snow-clad streets, i I say nothing of the remarks that passed ' .between us during the recital-r— nothing of my surprise, pn learning Barbara's real antecedents — nothing of the strange and rapid fluctuations of my feelings and the W^i' I beteayejl them. It is sufficient to say that before he came to the end of his story I looked into his sad, handsome face with implicit trust, and knew him to be the noblest man I had ever met. The little servant had not returned, and the snow was still whirling down fast and furiously. ; A blaze of light streamed from the win dows of the Masons' Arms athwart the carpet of . spotless white that reached to ite very door-siiep f and a sudden clang of joviality that burst on the silent air struck on bur heartB just then in their solemn quiet like a Tandom -peal on the bells of memory from some passing evil ghosts. We entered the house without a word, and there sat sadly talking about the past, until very soon we heard the .front door opened, and^ going into the passage we met the, little servant, careless of the snow which fell like a, little avalanche from her umbrella arid shawl, anrieus i» know if « the missis iiadti't come back,' «I can't find ker nowhere,' ehe cried.

'* You muBt keep itfroin the cold. You ought not to have gone to the door. But I will go and have another look.. I think something ought to be done to find her. But what can we do P' What, indeed ! Where could we begin f What could the sprightliest officer from Scotland-yard have done to find a wretched wanderer -walking on and on through those white streets with a, whirling mind in the whirling snow, with no object but oblivi ousness— I suppose nothing. When lie Martin returned from the door, this time with a sad shake of the head, in answer to my mute inquiry, he put on his overcoat. , ' I will just have a look outside,*' he said. 'She must4 be coming now if she's cpnling back at alL How far is the river from here? But no! I don't think we need fear that, Mr. Willersley.' 'The river, the river!' I repeated to myself, as I sat alone, while Le Martin anxiously and hurriedly went out and came in. half a dozen times during the next hour, and still Barbara did not come. The neighbor, which the little servant had pressed into her service, had gone ; and she, wearied out, now slept in her chair hj the fire*, as unconscious as the child at her feet. The snow had ceased falling, and the pale moon shone out on the white silent world, touching impartially with her chastening finger even the gabled roof of the 'Masons' Arms.' Not one vibration, of jarring noise broke the holy quiet ; and when Le Martin came in for the last time, sinking into a chair with an. expression of hopelessness in his face, and staring into the fire, it seemed as if the worst had hap pened ; and invisible ghosts were whisper^ ing in our benumbed hearts that something awful was over and hidden away under the snow. -. ? ? ' .??'?? : ?'' .' '.. : ' .: But at half-past 12, when neither of us had spoken for many minutes, the gate creaked i and with; a quick glance at each other, but without a question, we both hurried to the door There, indeed, stood Barbara, like a White ghost from head to foot, and like the whitest of white ghosts in the face. She did not start back, nor did she offer to come forward. She stood before us speechless, motionless, statue-like, until Frank Le Martin (he was neiaiesttoher), asif,verily, he had been the brother, whoBe part he had so often played, held out his hiands and drew her into the house. _ And., then, without a cry, -with only a stified groan, like a crumbling image of snow-wreathed marble showering white ap ray in its f all, she fell forward into his ariks insensible. _ '?:'.,''?'?' ;'' ,, ' ''-;.'.?
