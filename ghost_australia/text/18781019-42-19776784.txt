CHILDREN'S CORNER The Fox and the Turkeys; or Charley and the Old Folks. BY SUSAN COOLIDGE. [A cunning fox perceived some turkeys roosting securely on the bough of a high tree. Unable to, climb, he resolved to get at them in another way. Night after, night he stationed himself beneath the tree, and there played off all sorts of ourious trioks. He jumped, he capered, he turned somersaults, he walked on lus bind legs, he pretended to be dead, he raised and expanded bis tail until, in the moonlight, it looked like a flame of fire, —in short, he performed every antic conceivable. The turkeys, who, to sleep in safety, had only to torn their backs and forget the fox, were so agitated and exoitsd. by his pranks that for whole nights they never closed thoir eyes; the consequence was that they lost strength, and one by one dropped from the bough and into tha jaw* of Reynard, who soon made an end of them. Moral. —lt is unwise to oouoern one's self with the tricks and antics of mischievous persons.— £a FontainSi Fablu.] It was midsummer at the old Brush Farm. When I say "midsummer," how many pretty things it means, —woods at the freshest and greenest, meadowß sweet with newly out hay, cinnamon-roses in the hedges, and wator-lillies in the ponds, bees buzzing in and out of the clove-pinks and larkspurs which edge the beds of cabbageß and carrots in the kitchen-garden, a humming-bird at work in the scarlet trumpets of the honey-suckle on the porch—everywhere the sense of fulness and growth, with no shadow as yet of rankness or decay. August is over ripe. September's smile is sad, but midsummer is all rosy nope, the crown and blossom of the year. Charley Brush lay under an apple-tree, lace downward, and absorbed in " The Bed Rover," a book he had read at least ten times before. Stories about ships, and sea-life, and freebooters, and buccaneers, were his favorite reading, and, unfortunately, what with illustrated papers and cheap novels, and so-called " Boy's books," plenty of such tales abound nowadays. I say unfortu nately, for besides teaching him nothing, these books made Charley utterly dissatisfied with hia life at home. Hoeing vegetables, chopping wood, and going to the district school, seemed dull work indeed to a boy who was longing. to stand sword in hand, on a blood-stained deck; in a gory uniform, trimmed with skulls and cross-bones, and order his enemies to be thrown' one by one into the sea. "The shark awaits, your car casses !" spouted the imaginary desperado, with * yioious snap of his teeth ; and when Aunt Greg interrupted by asking him to bring in an armful of kindling, he glared at her like the Red Rpter himself. Poor Aunt Greg I how little sue guessed what was passing in his mind I " You look real pale to-day," she Mid. "I was afraid all that mince-pie for supper would, be, bad for you. Here, Charley, I'U uux you some ginger-and-water. That'll settle you, and make all right again." " Mia-cre-antl" was what Charley yearned to say, but instead he muttered, gruffly, " I aint, sick, and I don't want no ginger." Very bad grammar, as you perceive ; but grammar seemed such an unnecessary accomplishment for,a would be buccaneer, that Charley never could be indoeed to pay the least attention to it. That afternoon, under the apple-tree, he made up his mind. A pirate he must and he would be,, by fair means or by fouL He was cunning enough to know that the very word "pirate would frighten his grandmother into fits, so he only asked her leave to go to sea. Going to sea was, to his mind, a necessary first step towards the noble profession, he desired to enter. • " I want to so bad," he whined. " Please My I may." Grandmother began to cry. Aunt' Hitty was sure he must be out of his mind, and ran for the Epsom salts. Aunt Greg quoted ''There's; no place like home," and told a story about a boy she once heard of who ran away to ata and never came back, " foundered or drowndered," she couldn't remember which. Aunt Prue seised hia shoulders and gave him a sound shake. This was what came of idling over story-books all day long, she said—he could just shut up and go and give the pig its supper, and pot let her hear any more trash like that—making them all feel so bad about nothing. Charley twisted his shoulder out of her grasp with a scowl, but he took the pail and went out to the pen. All the time that piggy ate, he was considering what to do. " I'll tease 'em," he decided, "and tease, and tease, and than they'll let me go." So he did tease, and plead, and expostulate, but it was all in vain. Grandmother and the aunts could not be reached by any of his entreaties, and at the end of the week he seemed as far from his desire as ever. Tcu will wonder, perhaps, that Charley did not run away, as so many boys do in books, and a few out of them. Somehow he never thought of that. He was not a hardy, adventurous fellow at all. His desire to go to sea was • fancy born of foolish reading, and he wanted to have bis going made easy for him. "I must set to work in another way," he thought at last " Asking of 'em aint no use. I must make 'em want to have me go." Then he fell to thinking how this could be done. "Aunt Hitty wouldn't hold out long if the others didn't," he thought " I could coax her into it as easy as fun. She'll do anything if I kiss and pet her a bit Then there's Aunt Greg—. she thinks so much of poetry and such staff. I'll hunt up the pieces in the 'Reader' about ' The sea, the sea, the deep blue sea,' and all that, and learn 'em aid say em to her, and I'll tell her about cot * 'igror « and palm-trees, and make her think it? cae jiuiruiest thing going to sail off and visit 'eui. Grandmother's always bothering about my being sick, and afraid of this and afraid of that: so I'll just be sick—3o sick that nothing but a viyage 'ill cure me ! As for Aunt Prue, 'taint no use trying to impose 00 her. I guess I'll have to be real hateful and troublesome to Aunt Prue. I'll tease pussy and slot on the pantry shelves, and track up the floor every time she mops it, and leave the dipper in the sink, and all the other things ah* don't like, and by. and by she'll be jnst glad to Bee. the last of me! Hi!—that'll fetch 'em all!" He ended his rdflectioona with a chuckle. Charley: wasn't really a bad boy—not bad through and through, that is—but he had a cunning, tricky Bide to his nature, which mad© him like to play on the weaknesses of his grandmother and aunts. A sharp boy may prove more than a match for four unsuspecting old women ; and though in this case they were in the right and he in the wrong, , none the less was he likely to suooeed in his crafty plana. He waited a few days to let opposition sub side, and then began his tricks. ' Charley's first victim was Aunt Hitty, She was a gentle, weak minded person, easy to persuade, and when Charley put his head into her Up and called her coaxing names, and was sure she was too kind to disappoint him in the thing he was set upon, her heart softened, and she began to think that they hud all been hard and unkind. "Thedear boy wants to go awful bad," she told Aunt Greg, and to her surprise Aunt Greg did not fly out and soold as she had expected, but answered, with a sigh, " I suppose sailing on the ooean w beautiful!" Annt Greg had never seen the ooean in her life, 'but she was naturally romantic; and Charley, who had been hard at work at the- "Reader," 'had crammed her with all sort* of poetical quotations and farcies concerning it. Flying fish, coral islands, pole stars, dolphins, gallant mariners, wet sheets" and flowing seas, figured largely in these extnfct*, but there was no men* tion whatever of storms, sharks, drowning, hard work, dr anything disagreeable. Aunt Grer could not see the charm of ¥ wet Bheets," but all the rest sounded delightful; and gradually a picture formed itself in her mind of a sea which was always blue and always smooth, and of Charley standing on the deck of a ship repeating poetry to himself in the moonlight; and her opposition grew.feebler and feeble/. " Charley's got a lot of ideas in his head,".she said one day when she and her Bisters were slicing apples for drying. "He aJnt no common boy, Charley aint He 11 make a mark yet—see if he don't" . t... •'Dear Uttle fallow !"- sighed Aunt Hitay. i "So tovin'and affectionate! He used to be a Uttle . worrisome in his ways at times, but he's got all over that 1" ; " Oh, ha he ?" snapped AwtPrae. "I'dtika to know when ? He's been more of a plague the . hut six weeks' than ever in hit life, before,,. When he upset that milk last night I could have oaffed i him. It's the third time since Wednesday. Mark, indeed !

He thinks it's the air about here makes him feel bad, but I don't know if he's right about "it I wish we'd a doctor here to say it going off to sea—or somewhere—would be the best thing for him. I'm clean confused as to what we'd best do about it, b\tt I'm real uneasy ih my mind. Charley, coming to Just then, chuckled to him self as he heard her. ■ • ■ ' " So things went on, and by October Charley had his wish. It was settled that he should go to sea. Aunt Greg drove over to Wachnset Center and consulted with old Mr. Greg, her father in-law, who was the wise man of the neighbor* hood. M Let him go—let him go," was Mr. Greg's advice. " When a chap like that gets the bit between his teeth, ifs no use to keep yanking at the reins. Let him go for one leng cruise, and see how he likes it Ten to one he'll come back then and be glad to settle down. He aint the kind of boy to make a sailor of, I judge. There's' Ben Bradley,—my first wife's eousfty—captain of one of them China traders ; ship Charley with him. Til writ* a line, and I guess Ben '11 kind of keep an eye on him for the sake 'of the con nection." So, late in the fall, Charity went to sea. Grandmother and the aunts feltglreadfully sad when it came to the parting; but he was full of satisfaction and triumph, and never shed a tear. The "Helen Weeks," as Captain Bradley's ship was named, sailed from Boston on the 2nd of November, and for fifteen months nobody at home heard a word of Cnerlsy. Those were sad days at the old Brush Farm. Grandmother fell ill from anxiety, and even Aunt Prue looked white and miserable. Aunt Gre o and Aunt Hitty spedt their time crying in corners, and " Why did we let him go ?" was the language of all their hearts. But in February, when everything was at its coldest and iciest, Qharley came back,—Charley or his . ghost, for the tall, thin, starved-looking ragged boy set down at the gate was very unlike the stout rosy lad of the year before. He was so weak and forlorn that it was several days before he recovered enough to explain what had happened to him, and then it was little by little, and not as I give is, in one connected story. MI don't ever want to go to sea again," he began. "It sink a bit like what we thought it was. I A»'t know vhy then tha* in th» ' Reader' called it ' blue.' It's green and black and yellow, and all kinds of colors, bnt I never see it look bine exceptin' when folks was looking at it from the land. It's cold, too, and wet and nasty. I wasn't dry once for the first two months, it aeemij to me. Ugh ! I hate it Never let to sleep till you're rested, and such horrid stuff to eat, and sick—my, how sick I was! Captain Bradley was a fair enough sort of man, but he fell ill of China fever, and we had * to leave him behind in Canton, and Bill Bunce, the first mate, took his place. After that we had a. hard time enough. I thought it was bad at first, but it wasn't nothing to that. He was always walloping us boys, nnd swearing and kicking and cuffing us about Then we had a storm, and lost our mainmast, and came near foundering ; and then we were stuck in a calm . for three weeks, and the water aboard ran short That was the time I had the fever. I'd have died, I know, if it hadn't been for Tad Brioe. He was one of the sailors, and a real nice man. His 'boy at home was just as old as I am, and he sort of took an interest in me from the start He used to come in and feed me, and when we were put on allowance he saved half his water ration for me ; and when I got to crying, and thinking about home and you all, he'd ——•" Here Charley choked and was silent Aunt Hitty, who sat next, possessed herself of his thin hand and wept silently over it. ' " When I went away I meant to be a pirate, you know," want on Charley. "A pirate!" cried Aunt Bitty and Aunt Oreg in awe-struok voices. "Tea. I didn't know much about what it meant^ but it sounded somehow nice in the book*, and I wanted to be one. But when I asked '«m about it aboard they roared and hooted and made fun, and *hey all called me Captain Kid from that time on. And once, when we were in Shanghai " (Charley's voice sounded full of horror), "we saw two pirates. Tad Brice said they was pirates. The folks whs taking 'em to gaol. They was dreadful black and ugly, and their eyes were ,■0 fierce and bad that it made me cold to look at 'em. I never wanted to be a pirate any move • after that, but Bunce and the others, they all < kept oa calling me Captain Kid just th« name;" • " You' absurd ridiculous boy I" began Aunt Frua, but' Grandmother hushed her up. . ■' '•' Now, Prue, I wont have poor Charley scolded when he's been so sick," she said— v He's only m bay, anyhow,i and he's going to turn over a new leaf-now you, Charley t and go to school regular, and do bis. chores, and be the comfort of, his granny's life.
