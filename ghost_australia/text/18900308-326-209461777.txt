The coffee exhaled a fragrant odour, the fresh-baked biscuits were of the most delicate brown, aud the chickens broiled to a turn, but Mrs. Cone's face wore a most tragic ex pression, as she sat with an open letter in her hand. 'Aldrich,' said she, hysterically,' '-what am i to do? Here's your Aunt Efliugham coming here next week,- with lier six children and the nurse ! : They've had the measles, it seems, and., the doctor lias prescribed country air, so thev've decided to inflict a four weeks' visitation . upon .me!' ' ' Oh,' said Aldrich, guiltily, 'I forgot totell you. Haidee Clair wants to.come liere,"tliis- summer. She requires perfect quiet to finish her hew novel, and says she retains rsuch . a de lightful impression of Blossom Hedge from her lust summer's visit.' 1 Oh, does she, ' indeed?' said Mrs. Cone; dashing the cream and sugar recklessly into the sea-green chiua cups. 'And we must remember that your cousin Falkland has kindly volun teered to send Andromeda hete for the "snmmer, so that' she may forget that dove affair of .hers with Jack Jocelyn.' 'I'm afraid we haven't room for. 'eni all,' said Mr. Cone, reflectively. - H-- ' Oh, yes, you have,' said Lally, with tears, and laughter struggling in her voice. ' -They'll sleep on the hall hat-rack, on the garret ficar, or-.tho cellar shelves, sooner than . forego tile opportunity of getting good couiitry board for nothing ! And I shall do as I did last year — get along without a new winter suit, and . do luy own winter -house work, because the houser keeping bills were so-heavy during .the summer.

' What for petulantly inquired his mother. ' Cousin Aldricli- has sold it.' 'Sold it? "How "very inconsiderate of Mm!' Said Mrs.' Effingham. - ' Sold it to whom ? C : :» ' To tho cemetery people.' h 'What!' ' The cem-e-te-rv people,' enunciated. Master Ersicine. . ' Tho railroad's a-goin' right through ths old graveyard, iui'ci tliev ve got to have a new place. "I heard cousin .Aldrich tell the carpenter to bring that load of fence posts right off, and I heard him say, too, that it didu't matter so much, because there had already been two or three interments there.' 'Interments!', gasped Mrs. '. Effingham, under our' very windows? Goodness me! I never heard of such a thing!' ' If ye plase, ma'am, said Delia, the - nurse,' '.that accounts for it.' Accounts for what ? 'The ghost, mum, all in white." uttered Delia, with chattering teeth. 'I - seen it last night, mum, as tlie church clock struck twelve ; an' I seed it the night before. An' I don't wonder, ma'am, the poor dead bodies bein' dug up and scattered around this way. Aud if you plase, ma'am, you'll suit yourself at once, for not another week will Delia O'jRourke live next door to a churchyard.' 'Ma, ma,' whispered Florence Effingham, who had eagerly devoured every word of the discussion, ' I'm afraid of ghosts. Delia says ghosts come after little girls if they don't — ' . ' Will yon hush?' said Mrs! -Effingham, clasping her hands hi despair. ' Aldrich, what, is this ? Have you sold the Maple lot 7' ' Sold it ! Why shouldn't I ?' said Mr. Cone, why just then came in with a string of speckled brook trout. ' They offered me a capital price, ' and I'm not a rich, man, Y 'But to a cemetery !' 'I don't know a quieter neighbour than a cemetery,? said Aldrich. ' And I'm told,' said Mrs. Effingham, with a shudder, ' that some interments have already taken place!' - ' ' I didn't suppose you'd mind it, Aunt Effing ham, 'said the young host. ' Minil it 1 Why it's a semi-barbarous pro ceeding.!' cried the lady. 'Do we live in a. civilised country or do Ave not ?' 'Ma!' screeched Rudolph Effingham, the second son, jcrkiug at the maternal skirts, ' here's a load of lumber at the bars, a real, big load. Do you. supoosc that's to make the'eoffins out of ?' - - ' ' Just then Miss Clare stalked, d la Lady Macbeth, on the scene. ' I attach no importance to vulgar supersti tion,' said she, glaring at Mrs. Effingham, with whom she was no longer on speaking terms. ' Of tlie dead I entertain no fear. But the living are quite a different thing. And I cer tainly saw a — man, Cousin Aldrich, prowling about these premises last night,, with a dark lantern.' "'The gliost!' squeaked Delia.- 'Iliaveseen him. too! I did, with those eyes, the blessed saints betnne rae and all liarih ! Oil ! oh ! oil !' ' Peace, foolish woman ! ' said Haidee. £ This was no shade 1 It was a burly thief, intent no doubt on mischief. I saw him try to open the -..back parlour shutter, and then Neighbour Foxley's waggon drove by, and lie disappeared as if by magic. And I want you to under stand, Lalijq'rto Mrs. Cone, 'that I can't stand tho nervous shock of this sort of thing. My profession requires that I should be sur rounded by peaceful calm. I leave here to morrow.' ' An' I'll go wid yez,' said Delia. ' I can't sleep nights in a place where burglars is cliinin' up the trellis work, and poor ghosts come stalk- in' avouncl when the church clock strikes mid night, and a whole waggon-load more coram' to- morry or next clay, from the cimetery 1 Och, hone ! the like of it niver was heard before !' 'Ma, ma! can't we go too? We're afraid to stay at Blossom Hedge any longer !' pleaded tlie little Efdughams 111 chorus. . And so there was a general exodus, ' Aldrich, is this true ?' said Mrs. Cone, when the last express load of trunks had dis appeared round the curve of the road. ' Is what, true ? You're not afraid of ghosts, are you, Lally ?' ' No ; but ' ' Don't fret, my dear.' said Gone, com posedly .

'Who — I? Not in the least.' ' But tlie ghosts,- Aldrich ? the burglars ?' ' Here comes Andromeda, said Sir. Gone, with a sudden assumption of more than judicial gravity. ' Come here, you false damsel, and own up at once what I've already been sharp enough to discover for. myself.' ' Oli.

' And I .shrewdly sus- pect that tlie ghost' was Jack Jocelyn in li white tennis suit, haunting the gceen field beneath his sweetheart's window, and the burglar no other than Jack Jocelyn in black, climbing up the trellis after a letter which he well knew where to find. : Andromeda blushed redder than ever. 'Now, I'll have no more of this,' said Al- .drich. with mock sternness. .' Confess, young woman, at ouce, that you aud-your love affair aro at the bottom of all this mystification. Jack Jocelyn has owned up;' , Y .. ' Oh, Aldrich ?' sobbed Andromeda. 'And will you, too,'tun!(ngainst me'?' ' . .'Not a bit of it.' said Aldrich. Cone, cheer fully. ' Don't fret, little one, Jack has just toid hie that lie lias been appointed to a tbou- "sand-dollar berth in the general post-office, aud I've written to your mother that things are all 1- right. He's a jolly good fellow, and it isn't necessary for him to play ghost out in the cold "any longer.' . / " Andromeda throw herself, weeping with joy, ' into Lally Goiie's ariiis,' and the two women .re-, 'joiced together.' . . .Aldrich smiled.
