He went after Mentor had gone | to lied, and she knew neOhing ef it; hot j when she arose early in the moming to { get the scanty tweakfa^t 'toady she found ; that her father was not in the house, . But this did not ranch alarm her, for it had often happened before. Miller Gray and his gold were each good friends that they often stayed dose together all ; through the night. So, when Mercy had eaten her cam breakfast, she pot her fa- | theses meal to a stnall bs^cet, and went | e ver to the mill to give it to him, ss We "■ had often done before. She did not lock ' rhe house door when she left it, for the ' mill ufts only over the way, and We ex pected to stay only a Sew minotos. As she came up to We mill, however, Mercy saw Hat something must be amiss. The windftheek irate motionless, and her father's three employees sets Standing Idly by the door. It was stilt the eariy morning, but old Gray lad always made hit employees go to work an hour before any other men in the village. He had i always kept the key himself, and was j generally there before they were in the ] morning, and unlocked the door for litem. ! Gut on that morning, they told Merry, I they had knocked, and pounded, and kicked on the door of the mill in vain. ' So, supposing that he was still in the , house, tkey had waited until he should ; appear. i Such an occurrence had never been be- j fore. Mature had, I dare my, wound up Miller Gray when he was bom just he same as my husband—he was the sexton —wound up the old church in the church tower, and his life had gone on with the same regularity as that clock did. He had everything all laid out, and did it with such precision that he was more like a csy old monk iu a monastery than any I oue of whom I ever knew. So, when poor Mercy heard that the mill was not yet opened, and that her father had not been seen, she was tost as frightened and dismayed as she could be. " He must certainly be inside," she eaid, after a minute a thought. "Is ne ver happened before, but it might pos sibly be that he is asleep, or, perhaps"— and she spoke in an uncertain way— ** perhaps kt is ib that vault, if there it .... : ■ - ; Wejyili 1^^111^ i I i l I am wiBBk tAti ft | . _ ._. .
