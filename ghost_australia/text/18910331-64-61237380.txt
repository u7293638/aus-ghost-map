Am l-acorrlg-lble JTolter. AMONG the well-remembered characters of jny dramatic life (says Joseph Jefferson) was an actor named Salisbury. . . . Life was one huge joke to him; he treated nothing seriously. He was the delight of actors, and the bane of managers. It is related .of him that he once sent a telegram to Mr. Bice, of the Chicago Theatre, applying for an engagement. The manager sent back this answer:-"I would not engage you if you would come for nothing," to whioh Salisbury replied:-"Terms accepted. "Will be with yon to-morrow." This man's memory was so wonderful that it was almost impossible to ask him a question without getting a Shak spearean quotation in reply. If he was' imperfect in his part, which was generally the case, he would interpolate speeches from other characters, talking the most absurd nonsense, and turning a serious scene into ridicule. ' . One morning the poor old laundress was dunning him for her hard earnings. Ho waa standing at the stage door surrounded by a circle of. admirers, and, turning furiously upon the old woman, he paraphrased Macbeth's , speech to tho ghost of Banquo in the following 'words:-''Avaunt, and quit my sight. Thy tubs are marrowless; there is no starch in my fine shirts that thou dost glare withaL 'Approach thou like the Uussian manager, the Hyrcan critic, or the old rye whisky-us; or, be alive again and make it salary day. If trembling, then I do inhibit thee, confess me but a' babe of a Salisbury." The laundress fled in. despair, only too glad to escape unpaid from the supposed lunatic. ;
