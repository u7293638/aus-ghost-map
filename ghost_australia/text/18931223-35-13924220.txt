We read of an in creased exports, an increase in the quantity sold in the Swluej market, and, not withstanding the large amount of business already done, a buoyant tone in the market, which promises well for the sales that will be renewed next year after the vacation The deep sea exports of steel from Sydney and Newcastle horn the 1st July until now amount to 420,393 bales, an excess of £7 170 bales over the exports for the corresponding period of the previous season The number of bales offered for sale in Sydney was 309, bo6, an increase of db,002 upon the number offered during the corresponding period of last season, and the number sold was £63, 133, an increase of 39,817 "When these figures are accompanied by the fact that vigorous bidding characterised the sales before the holidays which have just begun, it will hardly be denied that so to the conditions of the wool trade are encouraging There are two aspects in which the progress of the wool trade may be considered the increase in the amount of the exports, and the increase in the amount off on ed and sold in the Sydney market In the past there has sometimes been a ten deals too%erlooLthegieatimpuitancooiour production and export of wool Amidst movements for the development of agriculture, the stimulation of Small settlement, and fine encouragement or town in dustries, the part played by the great pastoral interest in the maintenance of the prosperity of the colony has not always been fully appreciated The altered tone of the London money market, the shook placed upon the borrow ing now one of the Govern- mont, the contraction of public expenditure, and the general depression have combined to bring more prominently into view the relative importance of our great exports of staple products as the means of paying um creditors and upholding our credit When the chairman of the and of New South Wales was lowes ing some months back the course of events during the preceding part of the year, he expressed the opinion that, although heavy losses had fallen upon residents in the metropolitan district, the great producing interests had remained in a sound condition. It is well for the colony that it has been so "Y. o can look back upon times when the pastoral interest has received staggering blow shorn protracted droughts and otherwise, it is gratifying to see in the men casing export of wool palpable proof of the good fortune we have had in a way out able season But there is not more, this question of the increased export and the increased production behind it We know that for years past the increased direct export has been evidence of the creation to our own ports of trade that formerly went through other colonies to other places of shipment and in the growth of the bill in the Sydney market is to be seen not perhaps a guarantee, but at least as strong promise that the dust of the current will be continued in the same direction It would be folly to expect that Sydney for over be the sole centre of the Australian wool trade, but in the nature of the case, the greater the concentration home, the greater the gathering of buyers, and the greater the facilities offered here for had the more likely mail Sydney to to hold and retain the position of by far the most important place of sale I and shipment for wool in the Australian I colonies the extension and the efficient management of the railways have helped to bring about this remit the enterprise of the wool turns in providing, accommodation for the wool and making arrangements 101 its exhibition and file, have conduced to the same end and if it is not wanted is a vigilant persistence in providing for the require- months of a growing trade and the uoidancoof causes of obstruction It is well that the recent development of friction between buyers and sellers was terminated before injurious heat wiser gendered Even now, perhaps, there has been under estimate of the relations between the progress of Sydney), as both the selling place and the shipping place of the wool, and the prosperity of other classes than the wool producers It is to the interest of the latter that they should sell their wool, or send it for shipment where they will have their business done to the greatest advantage It is to the interest or many, others that the place for both purposes. should be Sydney. that is, allowing for such a proportion of the made as may be more conveniently centres at Newcastle Even a glance at the capacious stores and warehouses built within the last few years, and a comparison of then with the accommodation formerly pro vision, should indicate what an immense gain the growth, of the wool trade has been to the architects the con factors, the skilled workmen, and the labourers for whom the election of these numerous and extensive buildings found employment And, although a great ad- France has thus been made, the continued increase of production will render the provision of increased face hides a matter of continued necessity Notwithstanding all that had been provided in this direction before, the your now approaching its close has witnessed thegither enlargement of the accounts dation And such is the Coburg on the sly earn pouring in during the season that is. on now we see such structures as a skating link pressed into the service for storage purposes But this is not all.

Some of it has to be arranged for sampling.

The programme of train arrangements for the holidays which the Railway Commissioners have been able to make a one which, in the abundance of its provision for the enjoyment of the people must remind me observer of how mud has been accomplished during recent years in the way of opening the country for the pleasure and the business of the show community That is, perhaps, the most striking impression received! upon glancing through the,- list of. a. cursion trams which left Sydney for inland parts, and leave the country for the town, during the present holiday season Northwards and southward stretch the coast lines, arid westward lead the great trunk lines, with Germany branches, all open to the traveling public. Our 6) stem takes hold of almost the whole of Eastern Australia, so that by means of the Commission" as a angementslVery populous district in Queensland, Pretoria or South Australia is accessible, just as are the pleasure resorts on our own colony. Of course at this time of year is in chiefly the latter, the nearer districts, which will attract most of the holiday movement And what an increase has been made of late years in the number of these places, while to all, whether or recent or older bettie. ment, the regime of the Commissioners has rendered equally cheap, came, ment, and comfortable the menu of visiting them. It is not W ago since the beautiful Illawarra in suet was closed, save as to that limited area which lay about the seaports, against all those who could not afford the time and the expenditure necessary to travel it by vehicle A few years before the opening of this fair legion by the railway, much the same condition could be said to exist in regard to the mid portion of the northern coast district lying between the two most important seaside cities of New South Wales. The completion of the Hawkesbury bridge opened to the residents of both the capital and the coal port a series of resorts which the public has grown to admire and to iroquLut in greater numbers year by) year. The service to the mountains has boenimpioved in a variety of ways The trains keep eAiict march with the needs of time, and are be adjusted to the convenience and, would add, to the purse of the people that a complaint is seldom heard either from residents of the mountains or from tourists Tor has. ing so improved his means of locomotion the modern traveller has to thank Poilmment in courts acting new lines, and the Commissioners in wisely admits firing all their loads The old order of things in the railway as, a did as well as it could with the more limited resources and the smaller population of its period, and no dispassionate critic of the rule of Mr GOODen. will compare the present and the past without bearing all this in mind The change by which so much greater an area of our country is now open to the visitor, by which so many more people are encouraged and assisted to travel!, is unquestionably for the general good This is a land of resources as yet undeveloped, of potent conditions as yet all but unknown We are continually learning something new about its capacity for expression Where Oxer beheld a land unequal even to the main tenance of a few miserable nomads, where Siunr was turned back by the rigours of drought and desolation artesian water from scores of words is making the wilderness to blossom and of a farther district, once regarded as even more for bidding we have just been assuiedbyllr It said that the time will come when its production will be increased a thousand fold The truth is that the people who, perhaps believing that they so industriously assorted, have employed themselves in proclaiming that Australia is played out ' do not know their facts We are at the beginning, not the end, of development It is, in this view, a gain to the community. that the country is open to all who would assist by settlement and production in its u . pension what most of us are thinking of just now is rather the facility of getting about the colonies purposes of recreation And that is not as matter of little o' passing importance. A shrewd Ama eau observer has generally remarked upon " the wonderful faculty of the English for a little change,' a run out of town for a few days' as they phrase it " It would strike an American in this way, for his countrymen go to Europe for a little change, and cross the entire Western continent in a low dayschool town But it is a useful and pleasant practice to make the best of those few days which custom Spares to every member of the community People are all the better 101 the time they can spent away from the cares and associations of their workaday inos To the man or woman who u tied down nearly all the year to close work in office or shop or domestic duties, the opportunity of getting to the mountains, to the Illawarra 61 the Gosford district, to the homes of their relatives in the country, or to the kindly towns and where their families belong is of es. unal value for resting the mind and rein Mgointiug health, and sending the indiA dual back sounded, and the other of happier. 1\. sides, there is the cultivation of a senti- ment north-country A generation is grow- ing up which knows no other land than its own.

All the same, it is competent for the lay mind to Was why certain features of that code should he maintained in the medical profession which are regarded as inadmissible in the ordinary walks of bf e Our son respondents, in discussing the question, hardly state the case correctly in assuming that we advocate that medical discoveries should be kept secret that allopathy and homoeopaths should cooperate. in the treatment of a patient, and that medical men should in dulge in fulsome pi lees of the motives in the public press With regard to medical discoveries, our contention merely is that in this, as in every thing else, the labourer is worthy of his hire, or, as it was put "it is difficult to see why a medical investigator should not be entitled to the benefit of his own discovery as much as any other month The term " secret remedy," as we have said, tends to mislead and create prejudice What was apparently intended by) Mr EKM-SI Hair is a remedy that is the possession of an individual If under a high sense of professional honour he is disposed to impart the knowledge of it to all other members of the professor freely, he is entitled to do so, and it may he even added that it is to the honour of the profession, that such a generous spirit of self sacrifice should mile But that such a concession should be exacted at the pain of pi votes sional ostracism, seems to the lay mind as little short of the tyranny of trades unionism To state the case of a few eminent discoveries or inventions, without which the world would have suffered grievously, and so form the hypothesis of the discoverers keeping these things a rigid possession of their own can hardly be regarded as putting the case fairly) The withholding of the mid wife) forceps from the knowledge of the world for a couple of trousers one seems as cruel as it was bad business But are there no surgical instruments and appliances patented in those days of ours ? And is it to be considered an immoral net if the inventors make a little proof of their skill ? In the case of the inventor of the great anaesthetic it would have been an undoubted loss to the world if the discovery had been kept as a professional " secret ' And it the eminent man whose name is forever associated with the application of chloroform was too high minded to think for an instant of personal profit, does that invalidate the position, that the pecuniary value of Dr SmisoVs discos, on no man would have had any moral right to take away from him? So of Dr IIAMK and vaccination It would have been a loss to humanity) had his discovery been kept as a " secret remedy " But the fact that he was rewarded with a gift of £30,000, and that all the world said well done, amounted to an admission therefore was a pecuniary value attaching to his discovery, his proprietary light to which was recognised by the world. If we accept the theory maintained by our son respondents, Dr JIAM.II should neither have been offered nor lune accepted this gift, but should have been regarded as having an interest in the discovery only in common with all the medical profession If men of eminence decline to benefit by their discoveries and elect to take their reward in another way), either in the consciousness of having done an eminent service to humanity), or in th of arms that will attach to their names, all honour to them for it, but that does not establish a basis for a rule that neither men must do the same thing Besides, in point of fact there is no difference in principle beWec the ownership of a particular remedy, and the ownership of special skill That proprietary remedies should have been worthless, as alleged, may have followed nor, the fact of the pim ciple of them being frowned on by the profession, and the . practice of their being therefore relegated to a doubtful class of practitioners, but it does not affect the equity of the position, that every man is entitled to receive the reward of his skill, and that no authority should assume a right to prevent him As for the attitude of the medical profession towards practitioners of a different school, the idea of allopathy and homoeopaths co-operating in floating the same patients is absurd, and is not contended for by any one But absurdity) does not extend to such a thing as mutual help in the diagnosis of disease, or in the actual performance of a surgical operation, or in anything so far as their systems do not conflict But it is the attitude of the "superior poison" assumed towards a diffoung school that challenges the 10 mail of the lay mind No good can come of this, and it seems as unscientific in spirit as it is about to the temper of the ago Why this hostility, earned as it frequently is to the length of misrepresentation ? Even so eminent a man is Mr EiiYEsr HALL burlesques the tenets of the opposite school as teaching that " medicines act with an intensity, proportionate to the infinite diminution of the dose," of that "the activity of medicine increases in the ratio to the number of shakes given to the vessel containing it " To present this as the principle of the rival school and to demolish the absurdity is not argument, but to the lay mind it seems merely the fanning or unreasoning prejudice, and in no way tending to the public good As for giving publicity to the qualifications and abilities of medical practitioners b) advertising, the objection to it is concentrated in a nutshell in the question of our correspondent, " Where would the line be drawn ? " That is the ghost that stands first in the way of nlliofonn "Where will it out '" If the dangers of excess consul into the only objection, we might feel confident that an honourable profession like that of medicine would find a way of keeping itself within reasonable bounds PoSTilABTEES AND tin.

The 12,000 yards tanks will go to a depth of 20ft , while that at Coolgardie would be 25ft These tanks are In addition to the wells along the road which now form the chief water supply) M" Renou further ex- pl lined that there were now at Coolgardie two tanks that held 200,000 gallons of water, also a shattering at Coolgardie to the depth of 198ft, 6ft by 4ft wide In the shaft were six rises averaging 6ft by 4ft There was 12ft of warm in the shaft, and it had been drawn upon to the extent of 4000 gallons a day without any impression being made upon it This water was said to be highly mineralised and not eatable but Mr Renou said men had drunk from it freely without any ill off acts Rollo's bore was now down to 300ft , passing chiefly through shales and clays also 10ft of lignite, the bottom at the present time consisting of soft red clay with ironstone mixed the same as the natural surface of the ground.

W Conyers appointed to inquire into the relatives of sallies of Victorian coal and its suitability for I locomotive purpose (says the Melbourne Age), has completed its labors, and is now engaged pro j paring a report in which, will be set forth all the exhaustive tests and examinations which the board has been making during the last 12 months from samples of coal obt died from the Gippsland coal centres, viz , J nmbunna, Moe, Coal Creek, Coalville, North Coalville, Korumburra and Jeetho, Outtrim, Strezlecki, and Hazelwood for the purposes of the tests the Railway Department placed an old Belgian engine of the B class at the disposal of the board, and with that engine the experts have been testing the steaming merits of the different coals The two lines selected upon which to carry out the tests wore the main sections running from Melbourne to Woodend and from Melbourne to Geelong The run to Woodend is specially adapted for BOVOIO tests The test trains were always made up of trucks of coal with a van at each end, and the same trucks and freight were used throughout the various trials The board in its finding proposes to make comparisons between the results obtained from the Newcastle i coal and the Victorian coal The tests show that the Jumbunna, Outtrim, and Strezlecki coal stand by themselves As no- games the quality of the Victorian coal it has been found that the samples obtained from Coalville, Moe, North Coalville, Koruna ourra, and Jeetho were not suitable for all classes of work for railway purposes, but would be fairly services. for lines upon which the work is light, or for six Durbin train The best results were obtained from the Jumbunna and Outtrim mines, and the analysis indicates that the coal from these places is superior for all purposes to the average coal obtained by the Railway Department from New castle Com- paring the Jumbunna coal with that from Newcastle, it is ascertained that the Victorian article gives a smaller percentage of ash and is also superior by 2 6 per cent for heating purposes ESOEISH DEJECTION -Dr C H Pearson, the author of " National Life and Character," and Sir James Crichton Browne have both been holding forth recently upon pessimism, and both (says the Spectator) rather misuse the word Both, however, admit the fact that there is in Britno at this moment a deep sense of direction for which Dr Pearson assigns many reasons, while Sir J Crichton Browne attributes it to the growing re- finement of the senses, occuring at a time when the nation feels old and is suffering from one of those spasms of lowered vitality which occur to communities as to individuals we are in the trough of the wave The old faiths have lost their hold, life is no longer considered a probation, society is destitute of gladness and permeated by the spirit of ostentation , " art is lugubrious, literature un- inspiring, poetry neglected enthusiasm dist reciter, and science while adding largely to material possessions, has no mutual consolation to o ft r The finest intellects are yielding to hyphen draws, suicides have risen in du years from Go per million to 7 J per million, and the use of anodynes sometimes in the shape of drugs, sometimes in that of pursuits intended solely to distract, rapidly increase- That is a melancholy picture, md is confirmed by Dr Pearson, Or, rather, he assumes it as so undoubted that it is within the knowledge of all men, and it remains for him only to discuss s its causes, and plead that the melancholy may fight as bravely as the cheerful, and that p 2. simism in the sense of melancholy may be even more desirable than optimism as a permanent force an opinion in which we should thus in coincide, that it is neither the lighthearted manner the lighthearted races which, as the great struggle for existence, ultimately survive All over Europe, even in America, among all who are easily audible there is a single tone of dejection which, as Dr Pearson intimates, may not interfere with work, but which is fatal to happiness and, as we rather conceive, to the new energy never so much needed as just now The tired horses still pull well, but they will not voluntarily jump We do not mind very much for we believe the whole period will pass, as. the period of optimism passing, md has e no doubt of that revival of faith which will banish despon uency but for the horn those who state that it is in the ascendant, and visible even in the physical constitutions of the cultivated, do not state the truth We recommend those who believe that all the world is happier for the progress of the last few years, and who deny that the minority pay for the speed of the majority, to read Sir- J Crichton Browne ronEiOMus IN JAPAN -The army of Japan is happy in the possession of a
