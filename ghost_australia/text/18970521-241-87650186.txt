IN THE FLESH.t We had only that evening buried poor Jephson, who had diei the pre vious night after a short illness. He and I had chummed since his arrival in ndia two years before, and as we had been living together, it had been my painful duty, though I'did not know and had never seen any of his people, to in form his parents in England and his brother, whose regiment was at another station in India, first of his illness and then of his death. The notice, however. had been too srot to permit his brother coming in time even for the funeral. Af ter dinner, as it was bright moonlight and very hot, I lay in an easy chair on the lawn at the back of the house medi tating, when my bearer came through the house and down the steps into the garden; he seemed to be greatly excited, and scarcely able to articulate, but poin ted to a "sahib" that had come to see me, and was, in fact, following the ser rant. Raising my eyes. I saw in the bright moonlight my dead friend Jephson ad vancing towards me. t needed only me to tumble out of the side of the chair with a gasp, for the servant who had ushered this strange visitor to rush off with a shriek. Jephson came straight towards me, and when he held out his hand aud spoke. I fell down in a dead faint. When I iecovcred I found that my visitor was my dead friend Jephson's twin-brother, who had come as quickly. as he could on receipt of my telegram.. The likeness wasso great that it was no wonder my servant as well as:I tooek niM visitor for a ghost.
