A GHOST STORY FROM CALIFORNIA. Out in Los Angclos, California, a young ludy went to a photographer to havo her picture taken. After tho ceremony had been performed, the photographer rotirod to the dark room and proceeded to develop up the plate) ho having told tho yqung lady that if she would wait he would show her the nega tive. After developing tho plate tho photo grapher discovered that, instead of taking a picturo of one person there were two, and still further that tho other person was a ghost. At first he decided not to mention it to the young lady until after the picture was mounted, and then charge her for the ghost too, but fright took possession of him, and he decided to try it again. This plate also revealed the fact that the ghost was still in it. Three more sittings were given, and in each instance the ghost showed up very well for one so thin. When the young lady was shown tho plato she recog nised tho ghost as that of a dear friend who had diod a few weeks before. The likeness to the friend was very strong, and as tho ghost beckoned her on to a fairer clime than Los Angolos, she thought the matter over and became very excited, all of which ghosts to show that she is very supersti tious. Of course, we are unable to explain the mystory, but a wee sinall voice whispers to us that it is probably the work of some horrid newspaper reporter, who was pushed for news. However, the reader is at per fect liberty to form his own opinion.
