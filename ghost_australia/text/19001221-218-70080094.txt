Thle IriIu FlIa;: at E11roa Tennis Court. On Wedinesday afternoon the tennis court was dressed in gay bunIing, repre. senting the flags of all nations. The faled condition of the Irish colors very naturally called forth a stirring protest from a patriotic neighboring r wident, whose verycows stniffed Idlignautly around the fl g in search of sonlething green. Geordie Artustrong thus puts liar protest into harness : Take down that ugly, tawdryllig ! 'Twas never Ireland's boast To revel in a dirty rag. It shames us - such a ghost ! For Irishmen have fought, and bled, Beneath ithe " old ald green., Andl kept that lug unsoil'd in war, While tighting for the Queen. Oh, surely, thenll, in peceful timles, When was lug o'er tour mi th, That Il ig should sholw the Ihonor due To those who know its worth ! And proudly roll its emeraid lield And precious harp of gold Unsullied in iti margins fl.i, Frmn "Jack" to farthest fold. Take down that dirty, dingy rag ! Old Ireland's not so poor That disliclouts are her portion, (ld cith, that's Wsiped the IIor ! Give her the Irish symb ,l brave, lit which hlir sons take pride, For which they've fought, upheld unstain'J, For which, alas i they've died ! G. AnItSTrtONt.
