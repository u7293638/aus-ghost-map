A HEADLESS GHOST. A headless ghost has made its appearance near Ephrata, in Pennsylvania, where it excites considerable curiosity and alarm. Thero is no doubt whatever (writes St. Jmnci Gazette of January 17) as to its being a veritable ghost. It was first seen by the Kev. Daniel Witner, when returning home one evening from tho schoolhouse in Manor township, where he had been preaching. Mr. Witner had gone but a short distance when ho saw coming towards him what ho supposed to be a man carrying a lantern. On the nearer approach of the object he was, to use his own expression, "almost paralysod with horror" to find that it was a moving body without a head. His terror was Etill farther increased on seeing tho head carried in one of the hands. " The fearful object," he says, " took its place by my side and accompanied mo to my very door. How I managed to retain consciousness and reach home I don't know. It was tho most fearful experience I over had, and I hope I may never have tho like again." The reverond gentleman's statement is fully corroborated by two ladies and a Mr. Kaufman, who from a distance of about a hundred yards saw the ghost meet Mr. Witner and walk away with him, but were too appalled by the spectacle to interfere. The ghost has since been seen sevGral times, and the nerves of tho inhabitants of the district are described as being in " a fiightful state of tension." It is somewhat refreshing in these days of vulgar " spirituil manifestations" to hear of a comf old- fashioned ghost without a he*d, of whoso bio id cur.lling qualifications there is no mistake. These headless ghosts were once common enough in this country, but have of late years become almost extinct. Perhaps they have all gone to America.
