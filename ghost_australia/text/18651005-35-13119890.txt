THE SLASHING STYLE. (From the Shilling Magaùnc for July.) Tim dictionaries tell us that slashing is the act of flogging without mercy They also tell us that to slash is to strike as with a sword at random. In either case the stroke is delivered without measure. It may be fierce without mm, or severe without justice, or just without mercy , but always tho great charac- teristic of slashing is that it keeps no bounds and grves no quarter It is a mistake to confound it with mere severity It is always severe, but severity is not always slashing Now it is a curious fact, that in London, at least, this ait of slashing lins nearly died out Itis curious because, from the spread of periodical literature, and from its propensity to muko efforts at any cost, it was to be feared that ex iggerations of st)le would come to bo greatly fnvoiiTcd among us Any one who wishes to uiitlcibtanil tue character of a free press ought to dip into the earl) volumes of John Bull, and to compare itb style with that oi tho most censorious journals ol our own day It must be remembered that thib newspapei was edited bj n wit of the first water, was intended for the peiusal of the highest classes , was in a manna the organ of the Court, and was a triumph of successful journalism It made a virtuous parade ol itself avoiding scurnht), and of an anxiety to put it down m otlicis Yet wo who now read the old volumes ot John hull, even if we are carried away by the brilliance ot language and rush of animal spirits that assail us in every page, arc aghast at then Bcuniht), and know that such writing now-a-daya ?would be intolerable Certainly it is strange that the brilliant utupciation winch was ndmncd when news- papers ivere lew should now be abhorred when they are abundant as the sand And certainly, again, it is strange that now, when oui newspapers are iieer than ever they weie, they are less licentious lhere are some among us who lament the decadence of the slashing stjle Two years ago Mr Phillunore published n Histor) «f Englind which seemed to have been wirttcn with a sledge-hammer lletdlbus thci e that the w orst pamphletcei of the last century is to be prefened to the best newspaper vvritei now The opinion is so singulni that one is at a loss how to ac- count foi it, and one cannot help tho inference tint it must be due to Mi Philhmore's exceeding love of slashing It is in the v igour and fury ot attack that the political wilting and speaking ot last century aTC dis- tinctly superior to those of the present Last ccntuiy w as the epoch oi the hangman, and a hangman style pervaded oil political discussion In this centurv ive have nenrl) abolished the hangman, andpeihaps we mc too font! of rose-watci We dehbeiatcly íetuso to strengthen our conversation with frightful oaths, vic carefully abstain from the imputation of offensive motn cs , w e do not call each other names, and when a haid word escapes iiom us, we e\plam that we have used it unmeaning))'-in what is sometimes ci)lcd n Parliameiitai), and sometimes a Pickwickian, sense Certainly the stjle into which wo have now subsided vi ants the smashing vigour and the overpowenng odoui which Mi Phillunore admncs m t'ie writers ot lnst 'entuij.

The penod of the most slashing criticism is the penod of the most ltilsome dedications If we take speci- mens oi both the one and the other, and set them side by side, it will be seen by that veiy act that they aie in spirit identical .Toliiiboii eajs that m the meanness and seivility of hvpcrbnhcal adulation Dryden is almost unequalled. Since the thjs -when the Roman Emperois were deified, the onlv one who has approached andpro babl) smpassed lum is Aphra Behn, in an address to 1 leanor Gwjn A lair specimen ot Diyden's adula latorystjlewillbe found in the dedication of "The Rival Ladies" to Loid Oneiy "I can only say in general," obseives the poet, " that the souls of other men shine out at little crannies, they understand some one tlimg perhaps to admuation, while they ore darkened on nil the other pnrts , but your lordship's soul is an entire globe ot light, bi caking out on ever) side" One w ould tbmlv it difficult to surpasB this, but certainly Apina Behn surpassed it in her dedica- tion of a comedy to Nell Gwvn " Your peimission I has enlightened me, mid I with shame look back on i my ignorance which sufleied nie not to pay an adora- tion )ong since -nhere there was so veiy much due, ) et ev en now, though secure in my opinion I make this saenface with infinite tear and trembling, well know- ing tint so excellent and perfect a creature as yourself diflers only horn the divme powers in this-the onciings made to )Oti ought to be woi thy of you, whilst they accept the will alone" After sucha plirnse the subsequent sentences read almost tome, and \et the) are loaded with extravagant compliment " Besides all the charms and attractions and powers of j otu sex, jou have beauties peculiar to youisclf nn eternal sweetness, jouth, and air which never tVw clt in .my face but > ours You nevei appear but y ou g)nd the hearts of .ill that hav e the happy fortune to see jon, as if jon weie made on purpose to put the whole world into good humour ' But of all the flattcrrSs of tint ilatteinig age, I do not think I have read ana thing moie outingeous than a biography of Prince George of Dcnrmik, the husband of Queen Anne "When Aphra Behn decreed divine honours to poor Nell), she had at least an excuse in the pnvilcged phrases with which women have been alw aj s addressed Who need vv ondei when a woman is saluted as a goddess, oi even ranked bevond any goddess5 But what can justify the application to Prince Ocoige of suih tenus as the following ' "To name Punce George is to cast a cloud upon former ages, and to benight posterity Upon a survey of his whole life, I hnd not any man m all the reeoids of the ancients, or the writings of tile modem authors, over whom Prince George hath not some advantage; nor an) one's life taken altogcthci so admnable as his, nor an) thing admnable in any that is not in him.

an overwhelming influence If this I be indeed n fact, then my argument fills to the giouiul If it is the tendency of the new order of tlmips to reduce the organs of opinion to a dead level ol nuthonty, then no one organ can have that »FMirantp of Dower which will enable it to feel that it will bo heird without bawling, and that it can punish without slashing But is it a fret? and is there any likelihood of Do Tocquevilles prediction coming true' Let us refer to a parallel case Has the diffusion of wealth tended to reduce its in equalities » Or, again has the diffusion of education tended to lower the ascendency of the superior minds ' On the contrary, wealth, mere sordid pelf, wa« never more potent in the world than it is now, and the educated intellect, the slave of education, yields its neck with n comparable meekness to educated authority On the same principle, if the power oi the periodical press is mcrcasetl m the moss, the relative power of particular journals is also increased in an increased ratio The multitude of journals make the whole people peculiarly sensitive to opinion , and a chosen few of these journals reap the benefit of that sensitiveness Their opinions are studied with peculiar interest and tell with peculiar force Amid the clamours of multitudinous jour nalism, we hear one or two organs of opinion con btnntly quoted-sometimes m blame, sometimes in prufce, but always convassed with interest Ihese are the journals that make themselves heard ovei all others, that maintain their ascendency, notwith- standing De loequevúle s prediction, and that conscious of their power, can afford to lower their tones "Whether these news as to the influences which have led to the decay oi slashing among us be correct er not, there is no doubt as to the fact of its decay And there anent two remarks suggest themselves in conclusion The first relates to the Yankee press The slaBlimg style flourishes across the Atlantic, just aa there also nourishes the oratory of high flights And it must be confessed that the more powerful journals of New York sometimes descend to a system of attack to which fortunately we can find no parallel in this country

a slashing description of the slashing style The remark, howe\ti, suggests itself that we who know how recently the slashing style flourished in all its gloiy among ouisehes, should not altogether despair of the American press Many people fall into a way of accounting for the gross abuses oi the Yankee journals by ittnbutmg them to the degrading influences of democratic society and alow price They leap to the conclusion, therefore, that these abuses must be perennial The conclusion is illogical The only fact w e haA e to go upon is, that the "iankee journals are a quarter of a century behind our own Á\ o see precisely the same phenomenon m the poli- tical economy oi our transatlantic kinsmen All through this wai we have been complaining oi their Protectionist prejudices We are full five and twenty y ears a head oi them m oui knowledge of trade and finance , but we do not expect that their economical fallacies will last for ever, or that they are to be ascribed to democratic failings Neithei need we suppose that the murderous style of journalism which they are so iona of is peculiar to their form of crulisation and is ineradicable The same causes that haie tended m England to root it out, will.no doubt, m duc time, also root it out oi the United States The other lcmaik which, suggested itself bears on ouisehes-on the remains oi the slashing style that are still to be found among us Slashing, Ihave said, has nearly died out of the metropolitan press It still lurks, howevei, m holes and corners One is not suipnsed to see it now and then ciopping out in a pro- uncial newspapei It is but natural that the J atansuill Ga cite should be a little behind the spirit of the age The odd thing is to find the slashing style chiefly piactised by two of the liberal professions -the medical and the clerical It is very strange that mon oi sense, men of science, cannot write against medical heresies without using terms and hurling epithets which most men of the vvoild have consented to drop altogether Lspctially is it stiange, if we coi sidei that in matters of .science hard words can be of no avail, and wo require the pure logic of facts, not the doubtful logic of sneers Unfoi'unately, medical control ei sy is a terrille scene of massacre and blood shed Ihe shsmng style becomes mere bloodletting The medical heretic is denounced as a eiuack, an mi poster, i fool, a madman, a rascal, a knave, a lrvpocntc, a cormorant atoad, alec finder,-a perfect demon lhe mildest tenn winch Dr Sampson-a well known doctoi who nguics in the pages of Mi Challes Beade s last novel-applies to the brothei physician whom he distrusts is, ' Idiot ' That in the noble piofession of medicine there are to be found men who scoin such a style of controversy wo me of

slashing style, but there is more excuse for them, since they haie to deal cluefly with themes that profoundly engage the feel mgs and are not to be appioached by meie leason It is the business of the clergy to deal with the heart oi m in, and to measure the influence of motn es as an i clement oi human conduct In public cnticism they \ find it difficult to throw off that habit, and are con I stantly attributing those abominable motives and I drawing those unwarranted inference* which are among the chief characteristics of the sloshing style. "I heard Dr. B. say in a sermon," writes Jortin, " that if any one denies the uninterrupted succession, of bishops, he should not scruple to call him a down- right Atheist. This, when I was young, was sound fashionable doctrine." But we recognise the in- ference as a slashing one, and we know how easy it is for churchmen still to slash in that style, to call a man a godless infidel, because on some minor tjuestion he differs from orthodox opinion. It' is the old Puritanic love of hewing Agag in pieces. Sometimes in the adoption of this style, the clergy and clerical journals dwell much on images of the burning marl and the smoke of torment, sometimes on images of nausea and loathing, with especial reference to those of us who, being lukewarm in our opinions, deserve to share the fate of the Laodiceans. It is not for us to say that these strong modes of cxpres-ion are never to be used. We do object to their being used on every common occasion. 'Then it comes to pass that the sublime denunciations of the Scriptures are vulgarised into the tools of the slasher.
