BELGIUM. A, short time ago the body of a man in an ad- j vaneed state of decomposition was found in the canal of Bruges, near St. Michel-le- Bruges. An inhabi tant of the town having been missing for a fortnight, his family eame to view the body, and fancying, from certain fragments of the clothes, that it was' the remains of their lost relation, claimed it, and eon/erred a decent funeral upon it. According to the custom of the country, the attendants adjourned aftermrds to dissipate their grief by. the enlivening affects of a good dinner. Towards the close of the afternoon, when gaiety was beginning to assume the place of sadness, the man they had mourned in the morning as dead, suddenly appeared in the middle ef the party. The women, taking him fbr his ghost,' fled in terror, but the men, with all the fortitude of Hamlet, determined they would speak to him ; but, instead of vanishing into thin air, they found it was unmelting solid flesh, able to account for its long absence from St. Michel, and ako to partake with appetite of the viands spread on the table. A ques tion has since arisen which may not be easy of so lution—who is to pay for the funeral meats ? The ghost insists that they cannot he placed to his charge, and the family maintain, that as the expense was created entirely ou his own account, they are not liable. tHow this knotty point is to be settled re mains to be known. —Galignant.
