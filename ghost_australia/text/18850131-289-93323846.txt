SPORTING. Tlie weights for the Newmarket Handicap and Australian Cup having appeared, those who are fond of taking long shots will exercise their ingenuity in. selecting the good things. The three top weights are worthy of respect, although they have luuipiner weitrhts. Con ingsby, Helene, Topaz, The Ghost, Little Sister, King of the Gipsies, Napier, Claptrap, Paganini, Tlie Broker, First Love, Lavingtou, and Coronet appear to be fairly treated, aud one of these rsiay furnish the winner. In the Australian Cup we think Le Grand, Guess work, Ruf us, David, Hilltop, Dirk Hatteraick, and Despot are well enough in to make a good tight for winning honors. The Penola races take place on Wednesday and Thursday next, February 4 and 5. There are good acceptances for the principal races. In the hurdles Banker, Smuggler, and Guard fish should fill the places, as they will probably do also in the Members' Handicap. Storm Queen should win the handicap if she is up to her old form, her most dangerous opponent being Tom Moore, and these two should also be about in the Racing Club Handicap. Desperado may be good enough to win the Flying Handi cap. On Monday next nominations are due fortbi* Wentworth annual races, and as the recent rainfall will make the river navigation an easy thing, some of oiu- Adelaide horses should be sent to this favorite trysting-place. The Cavrieton races will take placf- on Thursday next, February ;'-, and if SliyloeJc is sent n]- lie should just about ?win tho douhlv, Handicap and Narrow Gauge Stakes: Free trader, Abbot, and Tancred should ha placed in tlie Hurdles, and Exile and TiUinis should be about in the Members' Handicap.
