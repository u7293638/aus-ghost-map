LOCAL AFFAIRS. THE POLICE OFFICE. -To-day is likely to be a rather busy oue in this Court, as there are three serious charges to be goue into. The first is oneWiilliara Hall, a uotorious cha- racter was arrested on Friday night, by Ser j géant Nolan for highway robbery. The second-a mounted policeman is charged wiih stealing"* pocket-book containirrg- pro perty to a considerable amount from a Ger- mán ; ana the third-one Charles Pearson, late in the employ of Mr Samuel Bake- well, Storekeeper, of Hindley- street, was yesterday morning arrested upon warrant by Sergeant Etheridge, for stealing a bag of potatoes, a bag of flour, and other articles thc property of his läte employer- These I cases will be beard this morning at oleren o'clock. THE HORSE-WHIPPING CASE-This being our last issue, we are desirous of ex- piring as comfortably as poesib^, but we are very much afraid there will be a vampire or two hovering over, our grave, who will say, " I would hit yon if I dared." Against these gentlemen, then, -our pen has ceased writing about for ever, and we therefore hope that if any ill-feeling . has arisen in the breasts of any parties, against whom we may possibly have written rather strongly, that they will forgive us, and thereby allow our spirits to roam about at ease. In conclusion we hope that all Sub Commissioner^ of Police, ali Lawyers, and j others, who have within the last three months thrown themselves open to ridicule, that they will for their own sakes turn cfver j a hew leaf, and thereby save themselves a great deal of annoyance by seeing their absurdities shown up by the Press. ORDINATION. - On Saturday last an Ordina- tion service was held at Trinity Church, when the Kev. W. Platts, minister of St- Andrew's Church, Walkerville, and the Rev. E. Jenkins, Acting Head-Master of St. Peter's Collegiate School, were admitted to the order of priest- hood. Prayers were read by the Rev. W. J. Woodcock ; and the Very Rev. the Dean, and the Rev. Messrs. Bagshaw, Fulford, Platts, and Jerkins assisted at the service. The oath of supremacy was administered by Mr. Bartley, the Registrar of the Diocese. The Lord Bishop preached an appropriate discourse from Acts xx., v. 28-" Take heed therefore unto yourselves, and to all the flock, over which the Holy Ghost hath made you overseers, to feed the church of God, which he hath purchased with his own blood." THE LORD BISHOP OF ADELAIDE. - We understand that Dr. Short and his family are about to pay a visit to England, and that they have taken their passage by the Shacka maxon, which vessel is advertised to sail on the 3rd proximo. DESTRUCTIVE FIRE.-About 12 o'clock on Good Friday, a fire broke out in Morphett Vale on the premises of Mr. Richard Humphries. The house and furniture, two stacks of hay, one of straw, and 200 bushels of wheat, were consumed, together with a waggon and many farm implements. Through the exertion of the neighbouring settlers, the fire was prevented from spreading to the ad- joing properties. Police-constable Heywood, stationed at the Emu, was soon on the premises, and manfully assisted in extinguishing the fire. It is computed that property to the amount of £500 was destroyed. FREEMASONRY. - On Wednesday last, at the j freemasons' Tavern, there was one of the j largest gatherings of the Members of the mystic craft the colony has ever witnessed. Ute Lodge of Harmony of South .Australia had made the neeting especial for the purpose of presenting 4 token of esteem to P.M.
