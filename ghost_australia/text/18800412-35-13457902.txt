THE VICTORIA THEATRE. Mr B Tau clough, according to announcement, appear ed at this theatre on S saturday night in Shakespeare's tragedy of Hamlet" This gentleman visited Australia some years ago, but in the colonies more "come and go so rapidly that it is more than probable that by far the larger portion of the great audience assembled at the Victoria the actor was seen and heard for the first time It now be safely asserted that no work of the immortal author has caused some discussion, or is better Known, than this story of the Prince of Denmark Whe over English literature is valued " Hamlet" finds a place, and this chiefly because the more the character is studied, the greater is the attraction, because in drawing the hero Shakespeare has so powerful displayed his knowledge of human interaction as the student tries to an item re the money even such entranced the Royal Dane, he is compelled to examine his own powers of mind, and, also because to many so I cil is Hamlet known, so thoroughly does he become the property of any one, who by his own or other's' failings is too sorely tried, who has daily dreamed of noble deeds, but has lacked the nerve to do them, who has had his " sweet bells jangled" that listening to or reflecting on his woes is as a chapter in their own history But the very universality of the stud) causes the it diversity in the representations of "Hamlet" No two men think exactly alike, and this creation, which appeals so forcibly to all, is not similarly interpreted by any two schools of actors We use the word " schools " advisedly, because there are recognised traditional "Hamlets" from whose stage version many actors would hesitate to differ , occasionally one more fearless than the rest strikes out a new sense, and by degrees attracts disciples It is not our purpose to compare the Hamlet of Mr Tun clough with any or those who have preceded him further than may be necessary to make our remarks clear to our readers We take this impersonation on its own merits as they were revealed to us Mr. Fairclough, in the first place, is to be credited with greater force of character than his hero had, he has devoted Very great study and much earnest thought and labour to the elaboration of his ideal, and has not scrupled to differ from authorities in his resolve to set it right " From the moment of his entrance the spectator is impressed with the scholarly refined earnestness of the Prince, and with the lofty estimate the artist has formed of the character he portrays From first to last there is sustained power high intelligence, and an utter avoidance of the common-place His figure is good, his dress in excellent taste, but to our mind there is in the make-up one striking defect Mr Fairclough wears a wig of light hair, with a suspicion of redness in to that, which is the acknowledged colour of the Dane or Norseman, but with this he has a black, moustache and jet-black eyebrows, which are not natural, and with the short upper lip, singularly effective for expressing scorn and haughty contempt, the dark moustache is often brought into formidable prominence. The scene with the ghost was played with great dignity, and the impression the apparition issue upon the oppressed moody youth was at once apparent The mind was momentarily unstrung , but even in his first speech to Horatio and his companions, he makes it clear that his after-madness is designed as a foil to enable him to determine how he shall expose the crime of Claudius his elocution and deportment were good, and the audience, at the close of the first act, unanimously recalled him The scene with the players was an effective one, and the famous soliloquy " O what a rogue and pea int save am 1," was delivered with earnest force and vigour, and true eloquence that won the sympathy of his audience, and again as the curtain fell the calls for the actor were loud. In the third act Mr Fairclough departs from the stage business, he does not stand to deliver the famous " To be or not to be," but, seated in the King's chair, where once his royal father said, he speculates aloud on the mighty problem of the future, he whose whole business in life is to carry out the vengeance promised to the "per spirit" of his father, yet, though brave as a lion and careless of life, yet forgetful of that supernatural visit, or unwilling to believe in it, or not knowing what he believes, he asks, " Who would barrels beer," c, but for the fear of " The undiscovered country, from whose bourne No traveller returns " Mr. Fairclough's attitude was natural, he made the listener feel how deeply he himself realised that " the native hue of resolution was sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought," how, through over reflection and too calculating a consideration, he had in the energy of his resolve lost the power of action, and the dreamy state into which at the close he momentarily relapsed seemed the natural result of the over-strained mind the change as Ophelia entered, and his talk with her, were well managed But in the interview with the Queen he proved himself a greater artist than in any other portion of the play, his demeanour as the ghost reappeared and bade him speak to his mother, was intensely dramatic the mingling of love and terror, yearning for the lost father, and the swoon which checked his steps as he hastened after the retreating ghost, all marked, carefully conceived, and independent notions of his interpreta- tion Theolmo8ttiger-likespringatthe_ingasheturnedaway from the poisoning scene in the play was startlingly real The dangling of Ophelia's fan and sudden shattering of the league that, the changed tone to Horatio-all seemed as the fitting outbursts of his highly. wrought mood At the grave of Ophelia he was touchingly eloquent, graceful and manly in the duel with Laertes, painfully realistic in the death agony and the lightning-like rapidity with which he used the few moments of fast ebbing life to slay the wicked king Judging him by his own performance, it is impossible to refuse nay, it is right to award- him high praise for a very clever, original, and refined interpretation, and to join in the applause of the audience the other characters may be speedily disposed of Mr Douglas did his best as Laertes, and acquitted himself well in the duel Polonaise and the King wore failures The speech of the former to his son we have never heard lesBiuipressivelv spoken Horatio was ill at ease, Osnck imperfect in the few words he had to say The gravedigger of Mr J. L. Hall stands out a most agreeable contrast The argument with the second gravedigger was carried on with a just perception of his own superiority in law and wit In his talk with Hamlet be kept up the same strain of merri- ment, and the equality implied in his tone and words was not lost upon the Prince who gravedigger was an advanced liberal, and realised the importance of his office The Ghost, which, it is said, Shakespeare himself used to play, was in the hands of Mr H. H Vincent, who, in appearance, movement, and speech, was excellent. He gave the fullest prominence to the character, and supported "Hamlet" most thoroughly. Miss Myra Kemble is a great favourite, and for this reason her Ophelia was approved, though there is much in it which might be improved Miss Julia Merton, a pleasant | actress in many characters, was ill-suited to play the Queen | The play was fairly mounted, but the stage is too small to allow of the usual appliances The King on Saturday prayed not in his chamber but in front of a very using a wire close to the footlights The orchestra contains some good musicians, but the selection of music was inferior There was a capital house all parts except the dress-circle, being over-crowded, the " gods" were not too orderly Mr. Fairclough re- appears 18 " Hamlet" to-night Hisreoeptionon Saturday must be W9 been very gratifying to him.
