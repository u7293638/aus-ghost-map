Charade, by Fred Forrester.— As the gods are depicted, By artists addicted To illustrate heathen mythology, There is one with a lyre Whose too partial attire Is but really a tiresomeApol(l)ogy. But as now I've begun Pray excuse this vile pun, * And among the nude myths please be searchin'. With the playful young imps You may catch a brief glimpse Of my first with an artful young urchin. If far north you should steer, Then my last you may hear, As the stars in their splendour are shining ; Should you happen to stay At a "bull-puncher's" dray, When the twilignt is slowly declining. But if now you put in Just a vowel between My two terminal letters so kindly, Then my last you may greet In an Adelaide street, Either Bundle, King William, or Hmdley. Now my whole may be seen, In a cheap magazine, Which can boast of a large circulation, Among young men and lasses, And most working classes, Composing the bulk of the nation. 1,C59.
