Creek and investigate the genuineness of the numerous free selectors lately taken upon that run His task, we fear, will be attended with some difficulty in accomplishing The inquiry has been forced upon the Government owing to the extraordinary interest manifested on the part of the public to learn whether the eminent personages in whose names the land has been applied for, comprising Wellington, Sir Robert Peel, Jack Sheppard, Dick Furp n, Pitt and Lanky Rnilert), and a host of other celebrities supposed to be long defunct, are still in existence, and have a local habitation on Myall Station, or otherwise If Mr Greaves is a believer in spiritualism, his course will be a simple one Failing in discovering the corporeal existence of the individuals he is in search of the next bed thing we can recommend him to do will be to hold a canter the ground, and invokes their spirits from the vasty deep,' who if they wish to maintain a character for being considered respectable disembodied spirits will appear to his summons, and notify their thanks to those who have so munificently provided them with a stake in the country From the well known partiality evinced by the Premier for ghosts we may reasonably ex- post that he will be content with the apparitions of such great men subscribing simply to the residence clause, without troubling them about improvements As a rule, however, in dealing with free selectors, we think the Government would be disposed to award a preference to a corporeal being as a more conclusive o evidence of existence than any spiritual presence If Mr Greaves should prove not to be a bobby or in spiritualism-as we more than suspect he is not why then it will devolve upon him to expose the deception by showing the end and purpose for which the Myall Creek ghosts were made LEPROSY AT HAW AH -Regarding the disease of her rosy as it exists in the Hawaian Islands, the A citizen, a journal published at Honolulu, writes -The scare of leprosy has done us a good deal of harm The segregation of our lepers we believe to be necessary, but such a work might have been carried out far more quietly and just as efficiently as it has been done Do not lay all the blame on newspapers and say they stirred it up They are not to be blamed if they gave no more than prominent or notice able facts However, we do not want to discuss any blame in this sad business, as we believe that the authorities tried to do what was for the best in the matter , but we wanted to say aw word about the unnecessary scare that leprosy has given rise to in our foreign community and abroad The disease has been in the islands say forty years or longer, and from first to last perhaps 1500 natives have been attacked by it, yet only four, perhaps five white men (and not one white woman have become infected in all this time, and yet the whole foreign community have been mingling in years past with all these patients We have known lepers to be em] loy ed about the houses of foreigners for a long time we have shaken hands with diseased people very often we have passed and jostled the lepers for years and years in our streets, and yet we have felt that there was no more danger of becoming lepers ourselves, nor was there in fact, that there would be to get our back crooked by associating publicly with a lot of humpbacks But this disease is no doubt to some extent contagious, but only in cases of most intimate association, and when in a predisposing state of disease We do not believe it is so contagious as consumption, and certainly not so much as to the mumps, as we said once before A healthy wife or husband may acquire tubercular consumption by constant association with ind naming of a diseased companion But this leprosy is not so surely contagious, and it is the latest fear imaginable that there is any danger of hung in the country or in consequence of being in the neighbourhood of the person of a leg or There is not the hundredth part of the danger that is to be apprehended in America or Europe or other parts of the world from loss blo contact with a case of consumption, measles, mumps and other minor diseases unknown to us, without speaking of cholera, smallpox, and scarlatina The ss phill the con- dilli n of some of our native people no doubt affords an opportunity for the inoculation of this disease we call leprosy All diseased v nus is some sort of infusorial life Now, the minson not cholera, smallpox, scarlatina measles, and other diseases readily find a lodgment, and grow even in a healthy body but we have no evidence that this leprous virus will effect a lodgment by merely coming in contact with a healthy subject It seems to require some previous diseased condition in order to effect a graft or to take hold and grow We would sit and eat with a leper We have done so, and would do it again, and we say that all fear of danger from any public contact with a leper proceeds from a most unreasonable scare ANALYSIS OF EVIDENCE AND DESCRIPTIVE REI OUTING -The Pall Mall Ga elie says -Another of those scenes with which the Tichborne trial has so liberally supplied the ' descriptive reporter, took place in the Court of Queen's Bench After the hearing of an application against a provincial newspaper on the now familiar charge of " contempt of Court Dr Kenealy rose and complained in terms of excessive o harshness of the reports of the trial which have appeared in the James newspaper This brought up Mr Finlayson, a well-known member of the Bar and author of the reports in question, to defend their accuracy and impartiality, which he did with considerable though not unnatural warmth The Lord Chief Justice while expressing his regret at the language in which Dr Kenealy had spoken of Mr I minson personally, at the Laura time intimated his opinion that " it would be better that the reports of the proceedings of the trial were confined to the usual mode of stating what passes in Court without putting evidence against evidence, and doing that which is properly the business of the counsel when they come to address the tun The "descriptive reporter" (observes the Ga elie) is forced to fall back upon the witnesses, and to tell the public how this one " stuck to his text and defied all efforts to strike him," or how another gave his evidence with all the appearance of honesty, while a third did not so much prepoBsess the " descriptive reporter in his favour Surely if analyses of evidence are to be forbidden, comments on the demeanour of witnesses and remarks on the successor failure of a cross examination ought to be still more sternly prohibited If one report is to be checked in a particular mode of reporting, because, though adopted for a useful purpose and in all good faith, it may accidentally prejudice a case, a stop should be put to a species of reckless comment, in which at any moment accuracy and impartiality may be sacrificed to a telling phrase It is at least due to a journal which has held itself honourably aloof in its reports from all concessions to the vulgar taste for sensational writing that its liberty should not be restrained without some check being opposed on the process of its less scrupulous conlon po runes.
