MIDNIGHT GHOSTS. Ghost3, ghosts, gnosis, ;ney crov.a arouna me to-night ; I see them come and X sue iLum go in the old year's fading light. So eerie tbev trieam at this midnicht watch that I fain the hour would toll And the sad old time, with its burden of gloom, to tho tomb of the dead-pas: roll. Ghosts, ghoita, ghosts, paic shades cf the "might have been," Into the realm of the "never to be" are pass ing away umeca. : But the shadow they leave upon haunted soul3 will brood through a lifelong night Tiil the Father shows the "wherefore" in the everlasting light. Ghosts, ghosts, ghosts, of opportunities lost, Standing around with their earless sheaves on a broken sickle crossed ; And in r. vaporous mis: of team vague aspira tion mourn O'er noble thoughts left unfulfilled and up ward strirings gone. Ghosts, ghosts, ghosts, of kind deeds left un done And tender words unspoken that some lost eoul might have won. If only we bad thought of it !— had dreamed of others' woe — Such spectres of despair could ne'er with eyes reproachful glow. Ghosts, ghosts, ghosts, of twelve moons come and gone, Of fateful hoars once ripe with power and purpose ye: unborn, All wasted now ;aod rising up to mock us in thfir death They vanish and new hopes flow in apon the New Y'ear's breath Hopes of the better thing3 to be in the new born eighty-eight ! Of "neighbor" firs: above dear "self" and all the crooked straight. Of kindlv words shed everywhere, cf grander ideals sought. And the mighty world with its shallow aims a: las: £5 : all a: nought. Will it be so? No spectres come to mock at the New Ycar'i end ? Can we change our nature at toll of the' bell and the old man in as rend ? Alas ! weak mortals must mortal be and human beings fail; But the aim lifts upward— one step is gained — through the ghosts of the " undone" wail. 1887. AU5TBALIE.
