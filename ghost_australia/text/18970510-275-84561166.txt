SHAKESPEAEE J - ? ' ? ? ? ' ?? THE BAR AND THE BAR]). j t i i i^ :' NEOTAE OF THE^POETS. A namesake of the ' Sweet Swan of Avon,' the immortal bard, Shakespeare, figured in the Perth Police Court to-day, charged with drunkenness.' He had in '?' the witching hour of night,' in search of ' the nectar of the poets,' visited sundry hotels. He is now fully aware that ' there is a tide in the affairs of man, which, taken at ?theh flood,' leads to the waterside watchhouse. Hence his appearance in court to- day, when doubtless he wished with the bard, ' Oh, that this top, too solid ? flesh Wduld melt, thaw and resolve itself ?into adew.' All the world's a stage and men and women merely players, and this was evidently the state of Benjamin Shakespeare's mind, for, in this train of thought, like his illustrious namesake, who in sweet days gone bye played at the Foun tain theatre, the' Shakespeare of modern days also appeared at the fountain— that is, the -fountain 'of liquor— the beer-tap. The arresting officer having, as in V Hamlet,' like the ghost of the head of the 'Eoyal House ? of Denmark, unfolded his tale, then, with . Eichard ? HE., ? Shakes peare, so to speak, exclaimed, 'Shine out, ? fair sun, as in.' a glass,' ? had evidently been ' in the sun,' arid ' had his ? wish gratified as regarding the ' glass.' The con stable hailed a cabman, and the erring namesake of the illustrious 'bard* was driven to the watchhouse. '-To be, or not to be, that is the question' that puzzled the mind of the Bench, as at last they finally i decided that it was to be— that is, to'the extent of cab fare (2s.), in default ©f payment, the bard will . ' go in ' for 24 hours. ?
