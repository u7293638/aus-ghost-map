Find of Old Coins in Tasmania. A few days since a man who is employed as ploughman at the farm of Marchington, Breadalbane, went into the shop of Mr Allen, watchmaker, Brisbane-street, Launceston, and asked the proprietor if he was a purchaser of old silver. Mr A. having answered in the affirmative, the man produced thirty seven old silver coins — dollars — some ware dated as far back as 1604, and the rest between that and 1807. The man said he turned the coins up whilst en- gaged ploughing in a field at Marching- ton. They were heavy coins, some being larger than a crown piece. How they came into the place where found is a mystery ; but it is not impossible that they were "planted" here by Mr Brady or some of his pals, when bushranging in the neighbourhood of the Cocked Hat. Be that as it may, Mr. Allen declined to purchase the dollars but whether from a fear that he might be haunted by the vindictive ghosts of aforesaid bushrangers, or because specie so found is supposed to be claimed by the Crown we cannot say. — Cornwall Advertiser.
