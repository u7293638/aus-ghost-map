LECTURES. ghost night, in the Unitarian Church, Hyde Park, Mr. John Gammell, H.A.s from New Zealand, delivered his third and final lecture on "The True Theory of the French Revolution, before a moderate audience. 'The lecturer begun with short recapitulation of the previous lectures, in which he had shown the weakness of what he described as the Sunday-school view of the French Revolution, and exposed the false light in which the Jacobina were customarily represented by historians. He went on to trace the abolition of the monarchy and the substitu- tion of a republic in its place. When the King, Louis XVI., was- dethroned, the question that arose was how to dispose of him. 'The Convention Parliament was formed, and the fate of the king became the subject of a struggle between the Jacobins and the Girondists. U iib, dismay it was heard that the vote in favour of Louis' death had been passed. No foreign aid was forthcoming, and on the morning of Monday, January 21, 1793, the unhappy monarch was murdered. I then arose a further struggle between the Jacobins and the Girondists for the supreme power. Other incidents in the Revolution, that upheaval of 1793, the effects of which were felt all over Europe, were graphically described by the lecturer. A pause was made in the middle of the lecture to allow a collection to be made.'
