Hib Excellency the Governor and a. few friends arrived early, and daring the day evinced a lively interest in everything that took place.. Considering the weather that had prevailed daring the months of May and June the track was in capital order, and it was noticed" that the straight had been widened; though to keep the public from treading it down Mr. Bond .hod placed a line ol rails to keep them back. A start was made at the customary hoar with the Hurdle Race, for which 10 of the 12 numbered on the card pat in an appearance. Chatsworth and Huntsman seemed most in favour, the former having a slight call over the Bendlgo winner, hut he had no show with the latter, who took np the running aoon after the flag fell, and never gave his opponents the ghost of a chance. The manner in which Huntsman performed at Wyndham was again criticised severely, and how lie was beaten there will remain among the mysteries of the turf, to be unravelled hereafter by somebody behind the scenes. Originally there were only five in the Victoria Gold Cup, and this number was re duced to four by the withdrawal , of Indian Queen, who was reserved for the Open Steeplechase. The ancient Blackthorn was installed first favourite, but the Bal larat division bad a commission out in favour of Dundee, who - looked a much .improved horse. The race was fun at a fair pace throughout, and the four competitors presented.a very pretty, sight as they jumped the fence on the hill together. Up to this point Dundee had made most of the running, but Mr. C. Glasscock took a judicious easy, and waiting until they ap proached the home turn, he c,ame again, ana, settling .Blackthorn without much of an effort,' won easily. . .The winner is a very useful son of Manuka, and will some day perhaps win a more important race than the Victoria Gold Gup, which, however, is a very hand some affair. The Ladies' Trophy, as usual, attracted a large field to the post, no less than 27 jockeys answering the summons for saddling. On looking over the competitors we thought nothing looked better than Fernlea, Who had satisfactorily answered a question put to him at Flemington, and so evidently had Phantom, who was in rare form, considering that Yeend had not had him up for any length of time, and the grey's prospects were considered to be of such a roseate hue that he was made a strong fa vourite. Primus, who was also in capital form, was a strong " tip" among the Caul field division, who also favoured the chances of Umberto, upon whom M. O'Brien had the mount The Ghost also had admirers, albeit his owner fancied the heavy ground would prove detrimental to his chance. The cast-off Hannibal bad bat few friends, notwithstand ing that he never looked better in his lite, the general opinion being that he could not quite get the distance, but that this was a false conclusion to arrive at the sequel proved. While taking hie preliminary canter Woodbine broke away with nis hoy, andran twice round ere he could be: stopped. ,-aAS this settled whatever ch&ncehe; may hare had, his owner ordered the horse back to the enclosure. When the others assembled at (he post Mr. Watson did not keep them long, and got them off on pretty equal terms, and Primus was one of the" first to show in front but Honora held the lead along the bend. Well into the straight Primus and' Hannibal had the best of it, but Fernlea and Phantom, both of whom had been disappointed, came with a rush inside the distance, and a magnificent ?race ensued, few of the' spectators knowing what, had won until Mr. Bowles hoisted Hannibal's number, and gate him the verdict by a short head, and he could not separate Primus and Fernlea. After the race His Excellency the Governor presented the trophies won during the day. Mr. Loughlin thanked Sir Henry Loch in a few appropriate sentences, and representatives of the ladies also responded on behalf of those who had to receive the bracelets. As there was a dead heat for second place, Mr. O'Brien and Mr. T. Jones tossed to decide who should take the second bracelet, and Mr. O'Brien won. It was, indeed, complimentary to the hanrti capper that 16 of the 18 engaged in the Steeplechase should face the starter. Union, Native, Sir Samuel, and Lizette all received genuine euport Patchwork was the first to misbehave himself by running off, and it is said be took Indian Queen with him-at any rate, she was a long way in the rear when theypassed the stand the first time. From this point-to the finish the race was one of the most interesting ever seen at Caul field or any fwhere else, and from the home turn Native, Lizette, and Old Soul fought it out inch by inch. At the last bardie Old Soul looked like winning, bat Lizette came again, and after a desperate straggle she gained the judge's verdict by half a head, and as the third was only a neck behind, those who did not witness the race can imagine what a spirited contest it mustnave been. A field of 21 put in appearance for the Richmond Handicap, and , when it became known that the stable had backed Country Boy the public followed suit* and thegood thing came off.
