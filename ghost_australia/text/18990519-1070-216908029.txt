DEATHS FROM FRIGHT. '! I. linvo interested myself somewhat in looking up unusual causes of death," said a well -known physician, "and havo met several well-authenticated instances where fright was tho cause. The English Surgoon- General Francis tells of a drummer in India aoross whoso legs a harmless lizard crawled wheu ho was half asleep. He was sure that a cobra had bitten him, and it was too much for his nerves, and ho died. "Frederick I. of Prussia was killed by fear. His wifo was insane, and ono day sho escaped from hor keepor, and, dabbling her clothes in . blood rushed upon her husband wliilo ho was dozing In his chair. King Frederick imagined her to bo tbo white lady whoso ghost was bolioved to invariably ap pear whenovor tho death of n mombor of tbo Royal Family was to occur, und ho was thrown into.a fovcr, and died in six weeks. " But perhaps the most romarkablo death from fear was that of tho Dutch painter Pcntnian, who lived in tho seventeenth con- tury.' One day he wont Into a room full of anatomical subjects to sketch somo deaths' heads and skeletons fora picture ho Intended to paint. Tho weather was very sultry, and whilo sketching ho foil asleep. He was aroused, by bones dancing around him and the skeletons Buspeudod from tho ceiling clashing togotlier. In a fit of torror ho throw himself out of tho window, and, though ho sustained no serious injury and was informed that a 'slight carthquako hud caused tho commotion among his ghostly surroundings, ho died in a fow days in a nervous tremor. " I could cito many othor cases whero tho shock to tho nervous system which wo know as fright has produced death."
