THE FLEMHTGTOH HOUNDS. TO THE EDfTOB OF THE AUSTRALASIAN. Sir,-^Of all the merry and fast spins the Flemington flyers nave given ub this season that of last' Saturday was the best. The meetwasat thekennels.and the throw off near to Mr.Petty's, at Maribyrnong. There was a pretty fair muster of horsetnen, the wea ther was delightful, and all things favourable for a good run. The dampness of thie morn, ing was good for the scent, which was breast high; ana the sun shining the two hours we were out made it pleasant riding to hounds. Mr. Waldock, although unable to ride, was at the meet, and the founds were in charge of Mr. Hearn, who rode Rocket to the front' throughout. The first fence was a three-railer into a reserve just above Maribyrnong, an'd some of the first flight took it in gallant style, the ma jority, however, going through agate which was handy. Then we had to negotiate a wall or two, and having crossed the railway tin unmistakable boomer loomed in sight, in the shape of 5ft. of solid masonry. This obstacle very few surmounted, but we came to a check soon after and recrossed the line at the eighth gate, and turning Bhaip to the left we had-a nice succession of walls apd fences for a few miles, when the honnds ran into the dingo, and killed him before any one - could get up to save him. The distance traversed in the run was about a dozen miles at a good pace, the time atoutan hour/ The .following members of the hunt .were well placed throughoutMr. Hearn on Rocket, Mr. Woolier on Royal Charlie, Mr. M'Cloud on Lucifer, Mr. Filgate on Bacchus, Mr. Goydjer on Prodigal, Mr. Harding on Chanticleer.' A few others manased to see the finish.! Yours, &c;" , - SAM'S GHOST.i
