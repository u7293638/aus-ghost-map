FRAGMENT FROM AN OLD LATIN ODE. A dull deep pain is at my heart, My eyes are wet with bitter tears, That gush from that still silent fount — The memory of bygone years. Oh! that within the iron gates Where death receives the trembling ghost, Some spot were found — some quiet nook — Where we might converse with the lost ! Where, far from life and light, and pain, In that still shadow of the tomb, Oar souls might meet with , theirs, and \- they Fill in our hearts the vacant room. Oh 1 kingdom rich in conquered spoils ! Oh! land whence none can e'er return ! The soul is shut and barred in thee Even as the dust within the urn. . —Jane C. Simpson.
