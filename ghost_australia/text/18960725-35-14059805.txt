MUSICAL AND DRAMATIC NOTES. The French papers are apparently anticipating a new play by Hem is Ibsen It is stated that the Norwegian Poet Laureate " generally flowers every two years, and that by next Christmas that period will have elapsed since " Little Eyolf " was poured This anticipation of another interesting v ork lins stirred Trancisquo Sarcoy, the great French critic, to an amusing and instructive article upon Ibsen's plays It is amusing in the viv city and sense of fun with which is described the controversy excited by the Doll's House" series It is instructive 0 because it shows us how different is the attitude of criticism towards Ibsen in Paris from what it has been in England We see at once that in Paris even the adverse cii ticism, of which there has been much, has been thoughtful and worthy of attention It never degenerated into senseless abuse of what it did not try to understand M Sarcoy gives a history of Ibsen's career, so to speak, in Paris His name was not generally known until 1889, when M Edouard Rod, a distinguished Mt 1 atcut, wrote upon " Lea Reve- names" and "La Maison de Poupcos" ("A Doll's House) M Rod expressed the opinion that the works of the now writer would not be readily accepted Their power would be acknowledged at once, but they would at first surprise the reader, and he added, that it would only be little by little that their harsh flavour would be appreciated M Darcey remarks that Parisians so adore the theatre that they paid little attention to the newly- published plays, saying in the words of the proverb " In fact too fine piece aux chan- delles Now over, though the plays were not immediately staged, they fixed the attention of Jules Lemaitre of the Debats Lemaitre did not quite like the plays, but nevertheless, he said they were the works of "a strong man," and he found in them " a singular savor, a color, a perfume, all distinctive " "I am not far from any ing," he continued in this essay , " that whilst our dramatic authors may be better workmen, they are far from reaching the profound humanity and tranquil audacity of Henrik Ibsen " Lommtro found in " Revenants " (" Ghosts") a beauty as incontestable as terrible This article made 11 great stir and " Ghosts " was at once staged at the Theatre Libre Then the storm broke Those who wish to gain a humorous idea of the situation must be referred to Sarcoy himself With good-humoured satire he describes all Paris as in an uproar about Ibsen, old friendships rudely broken, people over coming to blows in the streets ! This state of mind, exactly reflected in the columns of the leading London journals, was continued in Paris to the man at the street corner" The printed IOMOWS, mostly adverse, seem to have been well- weighed onticisms-not vulgar abuse Darcey saw the performance of " Ghosts " on the 30th March, 1890 He says the play was not noted, but mumbled, and that it was chiefly remark! able for giving rise to two cant phrases of the day "Snobs" for those who pretended to know all about Ibsen without having read a word of him, and Muffins for those who disliked his method Sarcoj himself was too used to all the honourable degrees of " simple, muffle, double muffle, ct triple murder," and merely remarked with a smile, " Je tie taken porte paw plant may " However in 1601 " Nora " had a genuine success at the Vaudeville tin chief part enabling Mile Rejnno to still further dev chop the genius which London had recognised in " Madame Sans Gene " Sarcoy declares that " Nora " (" A Doll's House ") is thoroughly French in the neatness of its construction, " that it is formed on lines which Sardou would not disavow, and that it is besides " fort jorie," and quite full of scenes of exquisite truth and grace " he remarks that the denouement " plunged him in stupefaction," but that the piece as a whole is not Norwegian at oil, but French-and of masterly originality at that M Sarcoy declines to pronounce absolutely upon any of Ibsen's pieces except " Nora," because Nora was the only one properly acted and staged But he saw also "Le Canard Sauvage" and "Hedda Gabler" in 1801, "La Dame de la Mer" in 92, " Un Enuomi du Peuple" in 93, " Solncss lo Construoteur " in '94, and Co Petit Ay toll " and ' Brand" in'Ofl The reception of the two last named showed that the opposing forces were coming to terms The admirers of Ibsen began to point out faults M Siirooy for his part says that as soon as " the enemy " became reasonable, he at once found such expressions as 'touches of genius,' 'scene of incomparable beauty' flow more freely from his pen ," and the great critic declares that now the heat of party feeling is evaporated, Henrik Ibsen will be re- Spectfully heard, admited, and criticised by both sides The Potter Bollow season in Melbourne was slightly extended at the Princess Theatre, so that it did not close until last Wednesday Crowded houses seem to have been the rule at the Princess Theatre since "David Garrick" was staged, and the stars might do worse than open their Sydney Reason with that comedy and the tragic sketch " Cav al- Lena RuBtioana " On Wednesday this latter was put up as a curtain-raiser, and then followed the screen scene from " School for Scandal, the balcony scene from " Romeo and Juliet," and the scene between Ophelia and the Prince in the third act of "Hamlet" The programme must have formed a rich intellectual and emotional feast Mrs Potter and Mr Kyrle Bellow will open at the Adelaide Theatre Royal to night in " La Tosca " On Thursday the Princess Theatre was closed, on Tuesday the 'Trilby" Company) made their farewell appearance in Australia prior to their New Zealand tour, and to night Mr Nat Goodwin will make his Australian debut at the Princess Theatre in A Gilded Fool " When the cabled news of the loss of the Drummond Castle reached Australia it was generally supposed that the sole survivor, Miirquarur, was the violinist who had lately appeared in Sydney with his wife, a well-known harpist According to the English files to hand, this is not the case The survivor is described as " Charles Mar quard " and in the published list of drowned there is no other person of that name on board, no " Madame Marquardt " being mentioned M and Mme Marquardt were popular here, and if they were both young it will be a relief to think that they did not go down in the ill fated Drummond Castle The Polish estates of the De Reszke form the subject of a lengthy article in the New York Wot la" We may perhaps be excused if we accept with 2016 receive the statement that adjoining Borowna Castle they have a potato held of 10,000 acres, but it is nevertheless a fact that the estates give employment to over a thousand hands M Jean de Reszke is at present Rebuilding in must ornate style the old castle of Skrzjdlow, where he and his future bride will 111 1897 take up their abode, and he is also building a summer residence at Borow us, while Lelouurd will, after his brother's marriage move to the estate of Garrick The racing studs nt Borowna, under the charge of a younger brother, Victor de Reszke At their estate of Chorzenico, by-the-way the brothers have had a slice of luck in discovering a rich mine of cement It is curious that their old associate M Lassalle, retired from the operatic stage, and is now also amassing a large fortune as a maker of cement The death, from angina pectoris, is announced of the famous Italian actor, Signor Ernesto Rossi, the follow-pupil and rival of Salvini He was born at Livorno 29th April, 1827, the son of a contractor for vi wood, who had been a soldier in Bonaparte's army He studied his art at the famous school of Signor Modena, where Salvin was then a pupil Salvini afterwards took the tragic and Rossi the heroic and lover lies, and in 1852, when he joined the Royal troupe of Sardinia, Rossi was acknowledged as, in his particular line, the greatest actor in Italy He appeared at Drury Lane Theatre in 1870, and thrice visited the United States, where he amassed a fortune Rossi was largely responsible for the popularity of Shakespeare's works in Italy, and among his best parts were Lear, Romeo, Macbeth, Coriolanus, Shylock, and Hamlet Miss Kate Chard and Mr Deane Brand, the original King and Queen in the production hereof " Manteaux Noirs," of which Miss Ivanova was the soprano, have just produced " Playing the Game" at the Strand Theatre The piece is, however, described by the i again as " piffle of the poorest description "-which may be supposed to mean in the vulgar tongue " poor stuff " The Brough Comedy Company close a success this season at the Brisbane Opera House to-night, and then enter upon their northern tour During the present week " The Passport," "Tanqueray," "Dandy Dick," and " Turned Up " have been started Mr Lewis de Groen, who is a native of this c lty, though Dutch by descent, and grandson of Josef de Groen, a once famous violinist of Amsterdam, has just been appointed Conductor of Music to his Excellency Viscount Hampden ( Sir George Darroilhas completed arrangements with Messrs Williamson and. Musgrove and Messrs Brady and Palmer (New York) to tour all cities in Australia not yet visited by the "Trilby " Company. An actress new to the stage will be the new " Trilby," and Mr. Darrell him self will appear at Svengali. Mr. Arthur Deane has just signed in London an engagement with Mr. George Edwardes, of the London Gaiety Theatre, for a period of one year. Four months of the engagement will be in England and the rest in America, and probably Mr. Deane will sing the baritone rule in " Goteha " the whole time. It is, however, Mr. Deane's intention to push on with his studies in German and Italian opera, for which the advisers of the late Sir Augustus Harris, and other competent judges, considered him specially qualified.
