Warialda. July 13. An Entertainment in aid of the Church of England general fund was held in the mechanics' in stitute, recently, and was a decided success, after taking into consideration the very short time in which it was worked up. The programme was varied, consisting of comic, serio-comic, and sentimental Hong's and duets, which were sung with ability. After the overture, the curtain was drawn on a very pic- turesque group of little girls, who sang the chorus, "The Fairies". This chorus was sung by the same little girls, and under the tuition of Miss Connolly, at a previous entertainment, and was so greatly appreci- ated that it was by special request again performed. Among the best items on tho programme were the performances of the two lady singers, Miss Connolly and Miss Atkinson. I must not omit to mention that Mr. Crisp was well received in his comic songs, "Wherever I May Go," and "The Ghost of Ben- jamin Binns." Miss Atkinson sang the good old song "Eileen Allanah " very nicely indeed, and was well received, but her great skill was shown in the duet, "Money Matters," with Mr. Brown. The second part of the programme opened with the"See-saw Chorus" by the same little girls and teacher just spoken of, and were greatly applauded. The success of the evening's performance reflects great credit upon the promoter, Mr. W. H. Newman, manager of the Bank of New South Wales, who un- doubtedly did his utmost. The performers had a splendid accompanist in Miss Hoy. The entertain- ment concluded with a farce entitled "My Turn Next," which was exceedingly well acted.
