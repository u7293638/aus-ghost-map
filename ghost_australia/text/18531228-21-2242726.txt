E N I Gil A. I'm a fanciful thing, I dwell not on earth, Tho' I visit it on to give genius birth ; I know very well I'm a Strange sort of thing, I'm needed each time they are making a king; Without me the engine went forward a peg, Nay, less I go with him the beggar can't beg. Being so useful, of course I am apt to grow big; But a barber once took me to finish a wig, And, alas t for my prospects of fortune and fame, I was ordered to watch o'er some geese by his dame; I tried to escape, but was chased by a rogue, And, as bad luck would have it, stuck fast in a bog. At last I took wing and rode far on the gale, Till hunger attacked me and grief made me pale; However I boast that the' often in danger, To fear and despair I was always a stranger. . Of late I have taken a fancy to rove, And I've looked into every Tasmanian grove ; Eyes bright as the stars I have seen in some places, And I've managed to fall into all their good graces. In gesture the' soft, I am too harsh for love, Yet, in general, I think I am mild as a dove ; Be that as it may, I am fond of the girls, And ducklings, and goslings, and such other pearls. A mighty stout fellow I tell you am I, My influence Government cannot deny ; in Europe they quake at the Czar's Cossack host, If they put me before it I'd make it a ghost. Though my energies all Upon goodness are bent, In anger, not mercy, to earth I was sent, And tho' to your revels access I don't crave, Yet, reader, observe me, I'll open your grave. And now would you guess at tiny wonderful name, 'Tis blazoned in gold on the proud flag of fame At the close of the evening or middle of night, Seek for the young folks in the merry star-light, And my age wrinkled form will appear soon in sight.
