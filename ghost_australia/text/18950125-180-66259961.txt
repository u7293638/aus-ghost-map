The witnesses of thia etxangel scene made their declaration to the-' Grand Marshal of the Court, swearing, , to the truth of what they had seen. On the next day the same apparition occurred. ' On this occasion the spectra not only prayed to the Holy Virgin, b&t; also walked round the church befoi4, vanishing. No doubt could now be! entertained on the subject — the soul at\ Alexander U. was tormented and needed^ more prayers and tapers to release him, from purgatory. Thenews was bometo the courtpprhere it is hardly neeesaarytoi say, it created deep astonishment. At first it did not encounter absolute : incredulity. The members of the Holy Synod were conBulted^md they promised to enquire into the matter. But Alexander JH. lost no time in expressing his indignation thateredence should be given to such a story, which was an insult to- the memory of his father. He sent for one of his detectives, in whose skill and fidelity be had the greatest confidence, and ordered him to dear u{. the mystery. The detective went to thb church, and, Tiidfng himself behind a pQlar, waited for tho result. In due course the phantom appeared once more, and, as on previous occasions, directed' its steps towards the statue. The detective although not a superstitious man, felt somewhat uneasy. Ho had served Alexander IL, and a seemed to see him again as he -* was on the daj of his assassination, with his face bathed in blood and { i suffering excruciating agony. Thoi ghost prayed longer at the statue than : usual. The detective mustering up alii his courage, glided softly toward it, but it moved further away. Instinctively the detective glanced at the statue, and discovered that many of the most valuable jewels were wanting. ^ This fact at once opened his eyes, and he dashed after the phantom, which turned out to be something more sub stantial than a vision. The next second it was struggling to release itself fron* the detective's grip, but in vain. It - was simply a thief who, endowed with * considerable imagination and audacity* had conceived the idea of robbing the relics in the midst of the terror caused by his apparition as the Smperor's ghost. He was taken to prison, and eventually tried and condemned in secret — at last so the legend runs.
