National Shipwreck Relief Society. A meeting of the committee of the National Ship- wreck Relief Society of New South Wales was held on Thursday afternoon at the Exchange. Captain Hixson presided. The bank balance showed a current account of £372 18s lld. Against this, however, there is a charge of £170 due to Mrs. Ohlsen. The sum of £93 6s 6d had been collected since last meeting. Of this amount £55 9s 3d was from Captain Ghest, of the R.M.S. Australia. A letter was received from Captain Roberts, of the barque Lorenzo (which was recently wrecked), thank- ing the committee for the sum of £20, voted by the society to enable him to proceed home. Dis- cussion of a conversational character ensued with reference to the wreck of the steamship Cahors. The bravery exhibited by Captain South and the boats' crews of the Burwah and Cahors was highly spoken of. The question of acknowledging this in a suitable manner was postponed for further investigation by a sub- committee, in order that a list might be prepared of the deserving recipients for the society's medal. Relief would be granted in the ordinary course, so that this was not discussed at any length. It was decided to send a commendatory letter to the Misses Bottomley and Latcham, who had gallantly saved the life of Miss Johnson in the Balmain baths in January last. The collector was requested to make inquiry into the circumstances attending the saving of a drowning man at Balmain by a youth named Wells, and report to the next meeting. Lambing in Jerilderie expected to be below the average.
