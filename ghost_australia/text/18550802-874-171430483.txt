We only print the present communication, in the hope, that—though seventeen persons have no doubt convulsed themselves over this fatuous pun, while each (in unconscious depravity) supposed himself to be it's parent and author-— the British Empire does not contain a wretch, who (to quote the words of Cobbet's ghost) would be " base enough and brute beast enough " to send us this pun again after the present publication.

DEFINITIONS:—A Leader—that part of a newspaper which people read last; A Poem—that part of any periodical which the public decline to read at all; Mwrdei—a civilized excitement. Public Opinion—the most recent imposition; a Colonial Secretary—a Governor's Clerk; an Auditor- General—a negligent student of accounts; a Punch—the safe guard of the Colony.
