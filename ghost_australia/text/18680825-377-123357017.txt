'"-n CoucT."-By the arrival of the steamer Saxonia some further intelligence has reached Sydney of the sayings and the doings of the pseudo Count Von Attems, the owner of the yacht Hamlet's Ghost. .The yacht arrived at Cleveland Bay on the 28th July, and the adventurer was lionised to the entreme. He was a guest whom everyone delighted to honour on board the Saxonia, spoke patronisingly of his Sydney friends, and announced his intention of completing his cruise by returning to Port Jachson on the 3rd instant, as he expected an Austrian war vessel would shortly call at the station to convey him to Enrope.- .Empire ".The Count" again. --We are informed that a letter has been received from this distinguished indi- vidual, in which he speaks highly of his reception in Queensland, of the honoure paid him, and the extreme hospitatity of the lenders often in the dilferent cities of that colony. He also requests that a "little bill," returned as not sufficiently endorsed, may be endorsed by one of hsi many wealthy friends in Sydney, and placed to his credit in a certain bank. The Count has not yet made up his mind when he will re-visit Sydney.
