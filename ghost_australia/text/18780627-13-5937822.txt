truth is oozmg out, and there is indisputable testimony that the selectors can obtain money on fan and equitable teims except m so fai as they aie restarted by the erratic action of the Mimstei himself That many of them liaYe been bl ought neai to nun during the last few months by an inability to obtain funds, though the} have good secunty to öfter, is undeniable, and many moie, it seems,

fl_"'K chaiges aie "lo pei " cent oi less ' Mi A T SCOTT alleged that " the selectors »vere not chained " exoibitant rates, he nevei knew of " more than 10 pei cent being chu ged, ' and so the list might be continued Time is a consensus of testimony fiom bank manager«, stoiekecpers, and fai mere, that the selectois can and do bonow at from 8 to 10 pei cent pei annum, the latter being the maumum chaige in bona fide cases Some men may pa} moie, just as some tradesmen YVIII be din en to obtain accommodation at 20 pei cent ,Y\lnle the oidinary discount ratesare fiom 7 to 8 pei cent, because they aie not trustworthy, and must go to dealers Y\ho take faulty itsks and chaige ac cordmgly Such exceptions pi ove the iule The Lands Commission has satis factonly established that from 8 to 10 per cent is the picvailmg mteiest at winch selectors can bonoYV, and we need scarcely say that any mei chant or tradesman »vho deslíes an overdraft, can do very little, if any, bettet in Mel bom ne, and that any clerk oi artisan Yvho Yvishes to become his own landloid can make no better teims Yvith a budd rog society The idea that the selectoi is in some Yvay a victim, and that, as Y\ds bioadly stated m Pailiament last session, he is the subject of some conspiracy on the part of capital, is thoioughly exploded by the mquny, and so is the îeason foi the existence of the commission feo long as the seloc tors can obtain money on the same terms as the mei chant, the shopkeeper, and the artisan, theie can be no neces sity foi state interference, unless, m deed, loyal liberalism is piepared to go a step iurther, and to charge the state Yvith the duty of lealismg the Millennium by piovidmg capital foi eveiybody HoYvcYei, theie is no doubt that the selectois just IIOYV aie m trouble As Yvitness

difficult, indeed, to decide Y\1HC1I has occasioned the most mischief, the edict tint no selectoi should bonoYv more than £1 pei acie, oi the dcciee that leases must be applied foi by the sclectoi himself, and cannot be deliYeied to his oidci The absurdity of the first iule becomes palpable YYhen YYO considei the ditTucnt Yalues and cn cuinstances of the ptopcities dealt Yvith bomc land is fit

YYIII enable lum to turn such feitility to account In the Echuca district it seems tho banks YYCio m the habit of adYancmg fiom £1 10s to <£2 pei acre, and cou sequently by a stioke of the pen the

some of its cor- respondents Into a mild sort of a ra¿c What will they say when we tell them that Ballarat men, Messrs Paterson, Quayle, and Howling, hav e taken the contract for the whole of tho gatekeepers' cottages on the Gipps Land line, thus going not onlj 12 but 120 miles on the other side of 'the metropolis? To this we might add anothei little fact to the effect that only laßt week a Ballarat firm, Messrs A & Corbett and Son, sent oft two large contracts of machinery to Sjdnej and Newcastle Our contemporary seems to imagine that there is Borne con- spiracy to favour Ballarat men Perhaps tho moro rational conclusion to be drawn is that Melbourne does not jet absorb the whole o the cnorgj,

make them- selves acquainted with the tactics of their opponents, and much closer contests moy be looked for on tins occasion than on the last The Rugby Union gamo differs greatlj from tiie Victorian, and is made up largely of scrimmagos and runs with the ball under tho arm The ball has to be kicked over a cross bar elevated 10ft above ground, and the " little marks" which are given and taken with so much effect in matches played here are not allowed, because a plajer is not permitted to pass tho ball on to one of his own side in front of him The aim of the com- petitors is to carry the ball to the opposite goal, and put it down between tho posts, 'the sido by YV Inch this is done is then allowed a place kick, under certain restric- tions, at the goal, from the distance of 25 jards, but the kick has to bo quickly taken, for the moment the ball is put on tho ground it may be rushed by the opposite side The YVaratali team have had the advantage of tho tuition of Mr Newing, an old

Judge Cope held that the father had no pow er to compromise the action, and sent tho case to the jmj, who awarded the plaintiff £170 damages 1 lorn tins decision tho de fendant appealed, contending that a next friend, who was prosecuting an action for a minor, liad power to compromise any action The Court, however, without detcinnning the larger question whethci, mulei no circum- stances, the next friend had powei to com- promise held that in tins particulai caso it w as not show n the compromise vva3 foi the lads benefit The decision of the County Court in favour of the plaintiff was

In the County Court jesterdaj, George Gibson, of Northcote, dmr. man, sued YVil ham _oung, of Brunswick, drover, for £21 being the Y ailie of a horse which it was allc_cd the defendant had detained from the plaintiff The defence was that the hoiso was the property of Young, and the question for the determination of the jury of four who heard the case was w hethcr the animal really belonged to the plaintiff or the defendant I he latter was prosecuted at the May ses sions for stealing the horse, and was ac quitted of tho charge A number of wit nesses Yvere examined jesterday on both sides and plaintiil s case was that he lost tho horse about two j ears ago, and did not see it again till March last, when it was found in the possession of the defendant The case for the latter was that he bought the horse from a person last j air, and lost it for a few months, but found it again just beforo it was claimed bj the plamtifl nia Honour Judge Cope, in addressing the jurj, sind there was no doubt the numerous witnesses on each sido be lieved they Y\ ere telling the truth when they spoke to the identity of tile horse as belong- ing to the plaintiff or the defendant and it w as for the

Patrick WilBon, landlord of the Royal Oak Hotel, was summoned at the Emerald- hill Police Court yesterday for permitting a por- tion of his licensed premises to bo used as a dancing saloon. Proceeding» were taken under clause 05 of the Licensing Statute. Mr. Sandilands, who appeared for the defendant, contended that the Bencli had no juris- diction ; the case, being one for forfeiture, could only be dealt with by the licensing magistrates for the district. The magis- trates on the bench, Messrs. Cowie and Foote, took time to consider the objection. A meeting of tho shareholders of the United Suburban Omnibus- Company was held last night at tho Grace Darling Hotel, Smith-street, Collingwood, for the purpose of adopting the deed of association. Mr. R. Showers occupied the chair, and the deed of association waa read and adopted. At tho ordinary meeting of the Footscray Council last evening a letter was read from Mr. William Mitchell, the lowest tenderer for tho Stony Creek Bridge, expressing his readiness either to withdraw his tender in accordance with the wish of the council, cr to carry out the contract. A proposition was made by Councillor Smitli to call for fresh tenders, but Councillor Thomson expressed his intention of speaking till mid- night to prevent its being carried, and the council adjourned without any determination being arrived at. It is probable that a special meeting will be called for Monday next, at 2 p.m., to further consider the matter. Our Ararat correspondent writes :-" An incident occurred in the Court of Petty Sessions on Tuesday during the hearing of appeals against the assessment made by the borough valuator on house propertj-, which may surely be put down among the signs of tho times. In support of one of these appeals Mr. Nott, a house and estate agent, who acts for the majority of the non- resident property holders of tho town, stated on his oath that ho was now letting houses generally at a reduction of one third on the rates mung a j ear ago, and that this reduction liad been forced upon lum. He also said that a very large proportion of the rentable houses of the borough passed through his hands in the way of business, and that his bookB would fully confirm his statements. As Mr. Nott is well known here as an activo agent, who does not willingly submit to any depreciation in the rent rolls of those who entrust their premises to his management, this evidence of the decline in tho value of property in 12 months is not without significance -, and as ho is, as a public man, in tho habit of declaring himself as ' an out-and-out pro- tectionist,' and is known to be opposed to the aggregation of largo estates in few hands, there is no room for the supposition that his views may be coloured' by his political predilections. It must be Btnted, however, that the appellants were defeated in the majority of cases on the legal ground of the informality of notices. It is not in Ararat alone that appeals against assessment have been in excess this j car of all former periods. The movement is general throughout the western district, and cannot have sprung up without cause. In those daj-s of government by Royal commissions, it may come to pass that an inquiry into the depreciation in the value of tho rateable property throughout the oolony of Victoria will one day have to bo intrusted to a chosen few of the members of the Legislative Assembly, under tho sign manual of His Excellency the Governor." Mining at Daylesford, telegraphs our local correspondent, has been exceedingly dull for some time, but there is a prospect of better times. The Rising Star Company, Blind Creek, have struck splendid quartz. The Ajax Com- pany, resuscitated by the enterprise of our townsman, Mr. M'Millan, is crushing payable quartz, and giving employment to a number of men. There is a spurt at tho Keep-it Dark Reef ; a well-defined payable lode has been struck, and a number of claims taken up. At a meeting of pastoral tenants held at Wentworth on Tuesday evening, our Sydney correspondent telegraphs, resolutions were passed condemnatory oi the provisions of the new Land Bill, and a memorial for presenta- tion to the Assembly was adopted. One resolution is to the effect that in consequence of the barrenness of the country and ita being subject to long periods of drought, special legislation is required for the Lower Darling district. Telegraphic communication waa opened yesterday between Melbourne and Howlong, a town on the-New South Wales border. " Very littl« doubt can now be felt," writes the Warrnambool Guardian, "of the fate of the two adventurous men who sailed from Warrnambool Bay on the morning of the 10th inst. with, the intention of making Port Campbell, and, from there, operating at the wreck of the Loch Ard. Both Lindsay and Boldon undoubtedly met their deaths during the heavyigale which prevailed on the morn- ing of the. 11th, but as to the actual circum- stances under which they perished nothing can now be known. The Goldhunter, the craft in which tho perilous voyage was made, was an open boat, 10ft. in length, with 5ft. Gin. beam, and sailed under a sprit-sail and fore-sail. She was a square sterned little thing, utterly unfit to last for any time in a heavy, sea, and it ia to b« presumed that the voj-agers trusted more than anything elao to the chance of having a quick run down in fine weather. Lindsay was an experienced' boatman, and having for many years past been engaged fishing about Curdie's Inlet andiup.and.down the coast, must have been perfectly well ac- quainted with the dangerous nature of the venture. It is now established bej-ond doubt that the boat reached the vicinity of Curdie's Inlet in safety, for she was seen under Bail off the Bay of Islands, about 5 o'clock on the ovening of the day on which they started, by Mr. Inane, a resident in that locality, who, however, did not take very much notice of the small craft, as he imagined, from the courso she was then stcoring, that it was the intention of those on board to mako for the inlet, where he expected to meet them. In all probability, Lindsay, having BO far made good time, thought to push on the same night to Port Campbell, where ho could ontor with- out difficulty, and find ample sholter and security for his small craft, but not being able to cover the distance-which, by water, would be some half-a-dozen miles- he evi- dently determined to stand off the coast for the night with tho intention of running in in the morning to the scene of tho wreck, when an opportunity would be afforded of picking up any cargo that might bo floating seaward. It would be during that night or the early morning of Tuesday when tho gale burst along the coast, that the Goldhunter would be caught in the midst of it out at sea, and Lindsay, no doubt, like a skilful boat- man, would run before it, and doubtless had' reached or rounded the Otway before the accident occurred, which left tho men to drown, and cast the boat ashore many miles further cast at Bream Creek." "Wo understand," saj-s the Brisbane Courier, "that Mr. Chester, Government Resident at Thursday Island, is about to visit Port Moresby, to report officially respecting the movements of the prospecting expedition who recently landed at that place ; also to re- port generally on the condition and prospects of the settlement. Sir Arthur Gordon having expressed a wish that this visit of inspection should bo made, the Government of this colony have granted Mr. Chester two months' leave of absence for the purpose, appointing Mr. Duff (second officer at Thursday Island) to act for Sir. Chester during his ab- sence. It will bo understood that Mr. Ingham, who was commissioned hy- the Queensland Government to render what assistance he could qf Porf.Moresby, with a Y lew to check any irregularities that might occur on the landing of the prospecting expedition, and to establish amicable rela- tions between the Europeans and natives in New Gamea, had really no legal status there, and although he undoubtedly did good serwee to tho attempt which lias been initiated with a Y niw to the opening up of New Guinea to Europeans for purposes of trade and settlement, lira appointment was in a sense irregular Mr Chester, how ev er, is in »different position, as he holds a com- mission from Sir Aithur Gordon as Judicial Commissioner of Pohnesia, and will there- fore, in the intended! visit, bo pioperly re garded at the authorised representative of the Imperial Gov ernment "Mr E H> Cameron, M L A ,' saja tho Evelyn Obtener, "has rcamlly received an official communication m which it was stated that the Lilj dale and Upper Yarra lino had been included in a scheme of railvvaj exten sion to be proposed bj the Commissioner of Railwajs " The Rev D S Maxwell, who for some timo filled thepulpit of Chalmers' Church, and after wards accepted o call to Kew, but left again for England, is, it appears, about to return to Victoria Tho People's Journal (Elfe) of April Oth reporta -"The Rev David S Maxwell who has officiated at Dunbog, foi the last nine months in absence of the paiiBh munster, and who ia about lo ro turn to Australia, w as presented, on Saturdaj, the 30th ult, with a beautiful drawing room clock llie presentation was mado ni tho public school by Mr James Carnegie, of Ayton, in presence of a number of the parishioners and Sabbath school children, with the latter of whom the movement originated Mr Carnegie spoke in flattering terms of Mr Maxwells ministrations, and Ins lundi) attention to the sick and dis tressed, bj which he had won, not onl) the respect, but the love of all classes He also paid a deserved compliment to Mrs Maxwell, who had cordiall) aeconded her hu8band s efforts in all good vv orks, especially among the j onng Mr Maxwell, m accepting the Lift, said that he valued it for its in trmsic worth, but above all for the kind feelings of which it was an expression, and assured the meeting it was a source of very great pleasure to himself and Mrs Maxwell that thej carried with them to the dis tant sphere of their future labours the good w lshes of so manj friends in Dunbog rho rev gentleman at the conclusion of his ser mon on Sabbath made a suitable allusion to his departuie, and w hile asking the prajei-3 of the congregation for a safe Yojage mid arrival, he bade them all an affectionate fare- well The church was well filled ' " A recent Alsatian journal,' observes tho Globe, "contains an account of some iron plnted defences which ore about to bo in- stalled at Strasburg bj the German com- mandant If the opinion w Inch the Prussian mihtarj authorities hav e formed of those con" structions is well founded, it maj bo expected that the) will come much into fashion m manj part3 of the world, as indeed thej have alreadj done in some of the moro important modern German strongholds The idea is to introduce into the fortification of towns that principle which has been worked out w ith such important results at sea, and to erect, m point of fact, ironclad " turrets, ' cxactlj similar to- those with which ships of war are fitted The new s.hcmo has not, of course, boen) et tested in actual warfare, but exporiment3 aro said to hav o been made w ith the most successful results at some of the German militar) centres, and at Metz and other places the new forts hav e been permanent.) erected Ï hej can be made cithei on a stationär) plan, w ith embraaures arranged in the most convenient positions, or so as to revolve by the aid of machinery, directing the fire of the single big _un withm at the pleasure of the garrison, and it is tho latter BJ stem which finds most favoui with the engineers of Strasburg and Berlin, if nothing Bhould occur to shake their confi- dence, the iron forts will soon become tho rag«, and the critics YV ill begin to laugh at the old defences of stone fronted with iron, which still make an important part of the defences both of Cronstadt and Portsmouth. With regard to the latter places, they would naturally be the first to adopt the new system of protection, inasmuch as it would be com- paratively easy to transfer the big guns from them to war vessels, or vice vasa, while the land turrets, being arranged on very much the same system as those of the navy, would not make bad schools of instruction and practice in time of peace or war.
