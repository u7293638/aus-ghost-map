' Like the Missus.' The Ethiopian damsel represented in our engraving has been misled by her too anxious desire to follow in the footsteps of her mistress. That what ' mistress does in the way of toilet decoration must be right is an axiom which requires to be guarded with certain limi tations. As ' mistress ' belongs to the Indo- Caucasian | branch of the human family, the application of rice- I powder will doubtless impart an attractive, though artificial , delicacv to 1; er complexion . \\\ ltli ner in uoian handmaiden (for reasons which may be superficial and skin-deep, but which nevertheless are very potent), a totally different efiect will be the result, and should she, after her 'face-making' endeavour, chance to meet one of her male admirers, he will probably scuttle off in terror, believing that he has seen a negro ghost.
