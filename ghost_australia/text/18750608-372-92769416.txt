CRICKET. Jbx Seep.] The Clare Young Men have every cause to be gratified with the success that has at tended their efforts this season. Thej have played three matches with tha Burra and ona with Saddleworth, and commenced two "with the Glare Senior Club which have never been finished. At the opening match Hunter distinguished himself by making the grand score of 66, without giving the ghost of a chance. He has also kept up his average all through, thereby winning the bat given to the highest scorer. Next on the list comes Harder, the captain, and if lie could only play a steady innings and drop the habit of letting out at straight ■ balls he wbuld no doubt be a teazer. He bowls very straight and fast, and sometimes with a good ofi-break. Matthews comes next, and he plays a very strong, defensive game, but has not played enough to show what he is made of. Loades is un doubtedly the prettiest bat in the team, and is a smart fielder at point and cover. Welsh is a "coming" bat, and is a very straight bowler, and fields well anywhere. Scott ■will be heard of next season. Bishop's small score may be easily accounted for. His performances when playing for the Seniors is a sufficient criterion of what he can do. Hcare is rather timid at the bat, but knows how to handle and return the ball at mid-off. C. G. Siacey has unfor tunately had no practice this year. He is generally a dangerons bowler, and a very good bat when in practice. F. Staceyhas not done much in batting, but he has fully atoned for that by the way he has bowled. Daly.has fallen off altogether from his old fotjjL. 4ab?ough want of practice. Lipsett ^■rmake a good player with practice. C. fSmith wante more practice at the bat, he is aTiardworMngfielder. J.C.Smith is the last, but not least, on the list, as he is a brilliant longs top. I have been given to understand that two gentlemen have promised to give a bat each to the highest average batsman and, bowler of the Clare Young Men next season. The following are the averages:— Hunter.. Harder.. Matthews lioades .. Welsh .. Bishop .. Scott .. Hoare .. F. Stacey ,C. Stacey Daly f jipsett.. C. Smith Fitzsimons 2 4 5 3 2 0 1.1 J.
