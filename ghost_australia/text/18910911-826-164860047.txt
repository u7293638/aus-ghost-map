iriah leWd, [From the Home Papers.] CARRY ME DOWN TO CARLOW. Why Mrs. O'Shea Stayed Away? The non-appearance of Mrs. O'Shea in Carlow on Sunday (says the Cork Herald, July 4) was a disappointment to thousands who were ill-consoled for the absence of the divorcee by her husband's essays on his own merits. But Mr. Paruell was coerced by his stalwarts on the scene to abandon his expressed intention of introducing her to the men and women of Carlow. "Carry me down to Carlow— O, take me, Charlie dear, For thousands must be waiting Your peerless bride to cheer. In days when you were powerful You loved me well, and now ril win you back the laurels That once bedecked your brow. " Joined hand in hand we'll conquer, Though myriad foes arise— The priests we'll knock to pieces, The ' sweeps' we'll pulverise. O, take me down to Carlow, Our subjects true to see, And where's the low-bred creature Will dare to scoff at me 1 " The " Chief " consented, smiling, And gazed upon his bride ; His noble heart was swelling With happiness and pride. No ghosts of murdered peasants, No gloomy prison pen, No thoughts of ruined homesteads Disturbed his grand soul then. But, rat-tat goes the knocker, Again and yet again, Until the sounds are echoed From every Brighton lane ; And telegrams came pouring, From Carlow county fair, " Oh ! for the love of heaven, Dear Charlie, leave her there ! " The lady's brow grew darker, 'Twas black as thunder cloud, Her scorn and hate she vented In accents fierce and loud. But Charlie whispered softly— " My dear, though love is blind, Those Irish must be humored, So you must stay behind." And she did.
