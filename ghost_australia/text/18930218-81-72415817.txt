Will you forgive me for leaving you?" "You will find it hard work to leave me. I go with yon and stand by you in this cause, life or death." "My dear friend! my brother!" We took hands on thin. Our close friendship passed into com- pleted brotherhood. Donbts and scruples vanished. We gave ourselves to our knight errautry. "We will save her, John." said I. "She is my sister from this moment." His fuco lighted up with the lieanty of his boyish days. He straightened him- self in bis saddle, gave his fair mustache a twirl, and hummed, for gayuty of heart, "Ah non gi unger'to the beat of his mustang's hoofs. ' ; We were riding at the Iwttom of a lit- tle hollow. The dusty trail across the unfenced wilderness, worn smooth and .broad, ns a turnpike, bythe. march of . myriad caravans, climbed up the slopes . before and behind us, like the wake of » ? ship between surges'. The mail traill' bud disappeared over "the ridge. Our horses bad gone with it. Brent and 1 were alune, as if the world held no other tenants. Suddenly we beard the rush of a horse- man after us. Before wu could turn he was down the hillock-be waa ut our side. He pulled bis horse bard upon his haunches and glared at us. A fierce look it' waa; yet a bewildered look, us of ono .suddenly, cheated of ? u revenge he hud laid finger on. -. He glared at us, we gazed at him, au instant,'without a word. :.'.?. . A ghastly pair-tliis apparition-horse 'and mau! The horse was a tull, gaunt, white. There were, tho deep hollows of tige, over bis bloodshot eyes. His ont-, stretched bead showed .that be shared his master's eagerness of pursuit. Death , would have chosen such a steed for a gallop on oue of death's errands. Death:wóúld hüve commissioned such ' a rider "to bear a sentence of death. A ' tall, gaunt mun, with the loóse,'-long frame of a pioneer, Irat the brown vigor , of a pioneer was gone from bim. His . face wiis lean and bloodless. It ' was clear where some of his blood hail found issue. ' A' -strip bf old white blanket, soiled -with dust and blood, was turbaned askew about his heud, mid under it there showed the ugly edges of a recent wouud. t . ; ; When he pulled np. beside ns his stringy, right hand was 'ready upon the butt of a revolver. He dropped ,the .muz- zle, us be looked ut us. ... . i For .what horror was, this mun the em bodied Nemesis! "Where ure they?" : He whispered this question in a voice thick with ' stern purpose and shudder- ing with some recollection that inspired' the purpose.? .,: .; i.,; ,,.,> : '-"They!-'Whor ..- '......

They' allowed we had ! money, them murderers did. Well, we ? camped all right, and went to sleep, and I never knowed nothin, ef it warn't a dream that a grizzly had wiped me over the head, till I woke up the next day with the snn brilin down on my head, and my head all raw and .bloody, as ef I'd been scalped. And there was Bill my brother Bill-lyin dead in his blankets." A shudder passed through our group. These were the men we had tolerated, sat with at the camp fire, to whose rough stories and foul jokes we had listened. Brent's instinct was true. . . Armstrong was evidently an honest, simple, kindly fellow. His eyes were pure, gentle blue. They filled with tears as he spoke. Bnt the stern look re- mained, the iihndumanthine whisper only grow thicker with vengeance. "Bill was dead," he continued. "The hatchet slipped when thoy come to hit nie. and they was too skeared, I sup- pose, to go on choppin me. as they had him. P'r'aps his ghost cum round and told 'em't warn't the fair thing they'd ben ut, and't warn't. But they got our horses. Bill's big sorrel and my Flathead horse, what's made a hundred and twen- ty-three miles betwixt sunrise and sun- set of a September day, goan for tbe doctor, wheu Ma Armstrong was tnk to die. Thej' got the horses and ourmoney belts. So when ! found Bill was dead, I knowed what my lifo was left.me for. I tied up my head, and somehow I crep and walked and run und got to Box El- der. I don't know how long it took nor who showed me the way. bot I trot there." . Box Elder is the northernmost Mor 'Uiou settlement, or was, in those days. "I'll never say another word agin the Moi mon religion, Jake," Armstrong: went on. "They treated me like a .brother to Box Eldor. They outfitted me wiLh'a pistol, and this ere horse. They said he'd come, in from a train what the Indians had cut off, and was a ; terrible one to go. He is, and I believe , lie knows what he's goan for. I've ben night mid day ridin on them murderers' trail. Now, men, give me time to think; Bill's murderers ain't at Bridger. They was there hist midnight. They must be somewheres within fifty miles, and I'll find'em, so help nie Ood!", ,; , . His hoarse whisper was still.
