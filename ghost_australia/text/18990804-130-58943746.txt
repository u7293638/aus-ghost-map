Johnny says, with a or burst. cz Then there was a thrill, and a hard tl drawn breath, and a sensation through the -crowd, If you like.

I left as'soon as Tn -I woke,- about seven, and so missed the nh first train to New York, which I intend- bi ed to take." o0 There is silence-extremely awkward or silence. Dr. Hunter, the coroner, has n teverfelt so embarrassed and nonplussed in his -life. It has an ugly. look,.-a devil- o ishb ugly look, he thinks, for the colonel. What the deuce. made him stay in the summer house? - Confound the sumnser P house, and confound Johnny's prying fr eyes.. He gives that youngster a savage -i glance that makes him quake. There is s not much more to be done. The whole 61 thing is hasty and informal, the jury feel as uncomfortable as the coroner, and about noon a verdict in "accordance with the facts" is returned.

They 'throng disperses, and Colonel Ffrench follows, amazingly erect and upright, cool and unflinching for a suspected criminaL is That evening brings Mr Dane Fan shawe, pale, breathless, horror-stricken. Vera looks at him in honest surprise, as she sees the grief, the real regret. in his face, and softens to him ever so little. After ill, perhaps, some men .cannot help being half fool, half knave- it seems horn with them-and he has reason to be g sorry for lie has killed the goose that laid to the golden eggs.

"If you had- t been here it need never have happened. a 9 say t it your doing as much as the bur- JI glar's.' . -. d "But, good Heaven! Vera, how could I t tell?" He Is so pale, so piteous, so tremu lous, as be says it, that-she relents. "I t did not think-how could anyone ever think-it would come to this?' "She showed me your telegram!" Vera exclaims, here eyes flashing. "From first I to last, Dane Fanshawe, you have acted \- ..t~ owards her like a brute, and, oh, my I poor little Dot, she was fond of you!" I He lays his face on the mantelshelf -with a groan. He is actually crying, the weak, poor creature; but it is more than Vera, than anyone would have given him credit for. .. i "I would give my life, -so hear sme, Heaven," he says, "to bring her back.'. 'Perhaps at the moment he means it. She sighs drearily, and lays her tired head down upon the'coffin. , . . "Bring her back!" she repeats, with a sob; "bring her back! " Oh, Dora, my dear, my dear!"

"My dear little love! my dear little love!" she re peats, over and over. Never once has one unkind or harsh.word fallen from Dora's lips to her.

It is good to have him here--it is a comfort, a protection, something to cling to her in her great end sudden shipwreck. The funeral is to be next day, and the concourse will be unprecedented. The Wholecountry side means to turn out in -sombre force. Friends come down from the city-no such funeral has ever taken place in St. Ann's. Many persons pass -In and out of the room of death. Vera '-is : -there constantly worn and wan to a alegree. Once, as she sits at her dreary and solitary post, a small, common tooking man comes up to her, and Snri?es an awkward bow. "Ask pardon, miss," he says, in an â€¢ spologetic, guarded undertone. "I'm 'Daggit." Vera stares blankly. "Daggit, miss." repeats the small man, 'In a whisper, "of the detective force Sorivate.

"Vera, my dear, my dear!'. . . . t. And she clings to him.and hides her a face on his'shpulder, quivering all over while the coffin Is screwed down, and the dead woman taken away.

What must be, mus al ss is a fatalist, more or less-it It is tren, it is written. Of course, he at wdo hat he can, but the prospect I gloomy. He must resign his com lon, inform his friends, put. his af- y sn order, leave Chariton Place in i Icare of the lawyers and of Vera, and jht for what Is dearer to him than life -his honor. Will Vera believe .him guilty? That thought is the hardest i to bear of all. ra :-It is a gusty, overcast evening, almost e the last of the month. - A fire.burns in the grate, the last: yellow glimmer of hI the frosty autumn sunshine steals in and lights his writing-table. He is bus ft Jly.writing letters, making most of th st dying daylight, when there is a tap a A t the door. i "Come in," he says, without lookin f C up. n r Some one comes in, and stands silent :., some of the hotel people, of course. i \- "What is it?" he asks, without turn 8 t Ing round. I There is a rustle of woman's garments t y He turns quickly; a long, black, veiled a figure stands before him-a ghost - in g f crape and bombazine. t e But, despite the heavy crape yell, he n knows her. n "Vera!" he says, and rises 'in vast g amaze. , She throws back her vell and lays hold of the table, as if she needed sup t port. She is paler than he has ever i :d seen her-pale to the lips-and her eyes shrink and fall before his. - :h "Sit down," he says, and places a 1y chair; "how.ill you look! 'You are not fit to stand." se She stands, however, and makes a Id motion to speak. She is greatly, strongly 1e agitated, that he can see. Once, twice, ar she essays before the words will come. e- "I have heard-that you are-suspect as ed of-of what has been done.-I havy m come to say that-that I am sorry." Sr. It is with the utmost difficulty she 'r, says this much. Some inward feeling e- moves her profoundly. But his whol re face lights. "Thank Heaven!" he says: "it is like its you. You do not believe it- you wil in not believe it. Say that!" '"I do not-I will not-I never can." !! "Thank Heaven!" he says, deeply it. moved. '?It is like you-it is like you. ee I do not care half so much now. I am sy, innocent, Vera: need I say it? : When ye I left you I went straight to the sum , mer-house-I was nearer you there than it elsewhere. It was for the last time, and I istayed. Believe me guiltless, he and it will matter little who believed 'le me guilty. Men have suffered unjustly in before-I can bear It as well as they." om She makes a second effort, greater en than the first. He wonders what it is Iso she is going to say.- - - a "I want to tell you-I have come to tell Sa you-that I"'-- a pause-"that if the an try nouncement of our marriage will help mn you, I will announce it. I-I will stay nd with you-I will be your wife." an The last word is a posltive gasp. No Swords can tell the effort It costs her to say this. She turns from him as she doe say it, and walks suddenly to one of the windows. It is not alone the offer a' itself, hard as it is to make-it is the construction he may put upon it. As ' the sister of the rich Mrs Fanshawe l only a week ago, she rejected with scorn iss and pride the offer of being his wife. As the impoverished sister of the dead mg Mrs Fanshawe, she comes to him - the heir-and renews the offer herself. How g hard she has found it to come- to say Sthis--only Vera's proud and sensitive heart can ever know. Let him mis understand if he will--it is all a mis understanding, from first to last. She ore will make it if she dies in the effort to say the words. Blt he does not mls understand, he is unutterably touched- Smoved to the very depths of his soul. "What shall I say?" he answers, brokenfy. "I cannot thank you; I have no words. It i like you-I say that again-to come to me In the darkest hour of my life, and offer, me the saecrl flee of yours. But I cannot occept it his The name I give you must be a clean one, the hand I offer free from all sus plcion of crime. I would, indeed, be a Sdastard If I-accepted your heroism to help:b yself.7 I would not:accept it if it cild heli;pmbn-butlt cannot. Notli int- now but the, discovery or thegreal criminkhcan dothat. For all tlie world I would not have it known that you are my wife now-the:wlfe.of a -dspected thief. No, Vera, I love you with-all my heart-a.hundredfold better in this hour than-ever before. '.And for that very love's sake I say no.. --It the day eve comes when.I stand clear and free, I will come to you then;.and" :But she 'turns' from the window as hqstliy as she has turned to it, and pulls her -veil once more over her face. "Say no more!" she exclaims. "Let me go. It is so warm here - I am faint" - The words die away; but she rallies in a moment and pushes aside the hand he holds out. "I -am better-let me go." Something in her strained, unnatural tone checks the words he would speak. He goes lovn '-with; her to .the' door, where Johnny and-' the -phaeton wait 'He helps her ini, but she seeriis- t' shrink from his touch. - -: - "Good-bye, 'she says..- 'Drive fast, Johnny; it is nearly'dark." - "Not good-bye," he answers, cheerily; "good night. I will see you early to morrow. I have much to say." "Drive fast, Johnny," is her sole ie ply. She shivers and draws her wrap closer alout her. How dark it grows, how windy it is, how deathly chill! He stands in the door'ayunitil she is out of sight, then slowly and thought fully returns to his work with.. a new, glad hope stirring .within him that all his gloomy prospects cannot dark?en And Vera is driven rapidly home through the gusty gloaming, and ascends to her room. How still the house is-how empty, how lonely! How empty is the whole world! Every one seems to have died with Dot- life has come to. an 'end. It is like a tomb like the vault where they have laid her. these echoing, 'unoccupied rooms. Is it a sin-to wish she were dead, too? WVhat in all the weary world is there left to live for? She is tired out, her head aches-or is it her heart? She feels numb and stricken, lost, forsaken, and full of pain.. "Oh, me! oh, me!" she says,-pitifully, and Jays her folded arms down on the table, and her face upon them, with a long, sobbing sigh. The wind cries like a banshee about the gables, the trees 'rattle, stripped bleak arms; the night falls cold and starless: : And still Vera lies there long after the -last light has faded; her head on . her arms, as if she never.cared to lift it again.,- - ' - .
