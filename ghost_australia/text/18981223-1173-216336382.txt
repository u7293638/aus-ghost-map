This I succeeded in doing, and being/like most Welshmen, very jprqucj pfmy country and descent, I was prouder still at being gazetted as second lieutenant itl a Welsh regiment. Our headquarters were at that time in foutia in? WotBfcrofficers — most of whom were Welshmen, including the * colonei y an old frienjd ofmy fathers—very nice, sociable,and smart meti. Thfe first year of njy service passed oyer very ^quickly and agreeably. I paid several visits home daring tbetime,ahd found my did mountain able , and guiet change i from my usual everyday I barracklife In^nMaglish town.

There was th^. arm—long, thin, and of abluish-grey tint, Archie and I couldn't tell whether it had belonged to a white or brown person— man or woman—and as our surgeon was a curious critical old fellow, we resolved not to mention it, but to bury the arm and await events. Of course, I withdrew my ring, and there it is, Wallace^ if you doubt ^my story. But here comes the strangest part Every night' after that—wh erever we were located—about midnight a slight noise used to wake me, and if sleeping iri a room, even with the door fast, it would slowly open and the same naked arm appear. At length I grew so nervous and ill from want- of rest that I was forced to resign my commission, and my father finding me tiie money, I am no^r out here lot colonial experience and to see if sheep^breeding will pay. I inay say, that since I left England { have not been haunted by the ' Ghost of the Naked Arm.' Wallace, we'll turn in.'. We >did -so, fastening the rickety door as^ Well as we could, and blocking tip the larger cracks in the hilt with clothes and newspapers. ^ ' It was Christmas Eye, aind Arthur Meredith ideolared , ti^at he would rest over Christmas Day. in the hut and give the sheep a chance to rest t q>{! »;-i»i v ? \ .. and feed pn the young grass that was abundant on the plain near the canip.

Presently Tthere, came three loud raps pn the door, 'which fairly shook the |; w^M ^multineously myself and !Heredith shouted ' Who's there ?' ; ,'^BreatJilessly iWe awaited a reply-r- none came. 1 got up, took the lantern in one hand and my revolver in the other and opened -the door. Scotty nisb^dfdu^ arid, barking ^furiously, cjhii^if' some object which lopked like a thin streak. of light about a man's height around.the,c^mp.- I-lollowedilbut the object vanished Iii-the darkness, and I was soon busy quieting the frightened sheep, which hstd bunched tbg[ether iii a corner aihd threatened to'break down . the flimsy.feuce., . On, returning t met Mereditlii! i -He, too, had seen the speotral apparition, ind entering the hut we gazed at each other for a niinute, in silence, v^h^n he said: * If I telj^yed in ghostis I would take my^ciatfi .thaf %as one.'ri •'It naust have beep.a pretty healthy one,' I answered, ' to knockas hard as it did, but I'll be hanged if I don't believe it was a ghost ail the same.' We put frfesh %odd on the lire, and after a pipe and two or three drinks, turned ih£gsUn. i ^coUld. hot sTeep, : "how-: ever, for i ^musf own thpugh not superstitious I was somewhat scared and [perplexed. I was half asleep and half awake when 1 heard Scotty utter a low. angry growl, and looking towards the door, saw, in the firelight^ a long, bony,; bluish- looking ajci^i pusih Chough an opejuirig in the door and try to,turn the. latch. 4 1 reached over: and , touched Meredith, who woke -at once, and I pointed.to ; the arm and hand. ^jn,; hand, and seizpd the skeleton; ??Yrist, ; An unearthly iyelL came from th e outside, but my hand held only a handful of dust. Banging^ io]|fen door into the daifaidsis, add skipping rapidly over jt^e ^kiQ, ag^ins^w that %eak rof bluish 'lighjL. . Scotty .gave chfse and iwas;gone some fifteen-minutes when he came back with his tail between his legs, shivering like a man with the ague. Neither of us wanted any more sleep, and so we sat up and talked over the odd apparition until daylight, which, I tell you, we both hailed with delight. I tell you, although it was Christmas Day, and the rain was pouring dotoi, we didn't stay ~urthat-hut~another night, but drove on some five miles to a road-side inn where there was a well fended paddock^ and took our Christmas turkey thelre. That night we fold -the landlord—Jerry Lynch- . abotrt our experience, and he said : ' You would not get even a tramp irt these parts to sleep in that hut for love or money, for it bas for some years had the reputation of being haunted. Fourteen years ago an old sheep-drover named Cole lived there. He lived there for three years and must have saved money, for he never came to town or spent a cent except in tobacco. One day, when the owner of the sheep came around, he found his 'flock half-starved in the yard, where they had been probably for two days. Old Cole was found in one of the bunks with his throat cut from ear to ear, and stone dead.' Now, boys, you can make as much' fun of me as you like; but If you want proof of what I've told you, just write to A. F, Meredith, jcare of Bell and Co., Gimley's Hotel, Sydney, and he'll corroborate every word I have said/ Under these circumstances we had to believe Tom, and all went to bed that night with a queer shivering feeling about us which we were ashamed to confess. In olden times Christmas carols were sung by the "bishops and clergy, the money collected being distributed .among the poor. :
