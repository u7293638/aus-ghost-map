He gives the history of the [Rhode Island colony that he founded with the charter obtained from Charles II., the incidents of his life, his faith in Christ, with a letter to his.family, his Church, and the ' world. Mr. Holmes also gives an account of his public whipping in.Boston, and attests-f 'I did there shed my blood.1'
