ONCE WAS ENOUGH. “I-ike a good many young men who ■havemore imagination than experience, I started out to be a detective." The speaker is' a man who buys real estate when 'someone has to sell, and sells when someone is anxious to buy. “By sheer chance, I happened to be on the ground when a new agency was being formed, and found employment. There was a reign of terror then be cause of burglaries and hold-ups, just as there now is in many cities. On a certain evening one of the wealthiest men in the country was robbed by foot pads. and I was put on the case. I found his watch in a pawnshop, and watched patiently there till the thief appeared with a gold match safe, set with diamonds. "Bent on doing the job alone. I shadowed him home, with a view to get ting the rest, of the plunder, and corral the rest of the offenders, if then1 hap pened to lie a gang. My man did not make a bluff', much less a light. lie gave up the pawn tickets, surrendered most of the money taken, and declared himself my prisoner. As I was about to slip the cuffs on his wrist, he asked me to step for a minute into the next room. There was .a woman (hat. looked about, as substantial as a ghost, and three little children in rags, crying for something to eat. Not. a word was said, and when we were back in t.lie main room the man extended his hands for the wristlets. 1 took his right hand, gave it a hearty shake, and told him to provide in some honest way for those in the other room. "On the way back to the .agency I was stopped by a revolver at the end of my nose, and the money I had recap tured was taken from me. The robber was the man I bad just spared, and he grinned as he told me that I happened to drop in on him while he had his gun apart, (-leaning it. He was just stop ping there, and had nothing to do with these who had so stirred my pity. •T mailed my resignation to headquar ters. and left for another city."
