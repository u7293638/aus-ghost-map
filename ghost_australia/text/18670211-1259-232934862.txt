On the late "Telegraph" THE " Telegraph," rag to the wall has gone, . And nobody seems to mind it; For a dirty trade it carried on, And left all its debts behind it. The " Herald —a thing of villainous type— Lived long on slander and lying; Till at last a squeeze from the bailiff's gripe, Laid the venomous beast a-dying. The " Herald " fell! But the " Telegraph" rose- A ghost from the grave of Murray ; It scared its friends much more than its foes, And was kicked to the shades in a hurry.
