V.A.T.C. Cup M eeting. [CONDENSED FBOM MONIUT’s "AOI7.."] From the time of the institution of the Victoria Amateur Turf Club's Spring Meeting in its prerent fjrm the opening day lias invariably been attended by wel weather,' and Inst Saturday proved to be nc exception. Fortunately for th^ club, atmospheric indications remained favorable until after the majority of intending visitors Jiad started for the scene of action, b u t M i an hour before the appointed for the first race ominous clouds gathered over the and a heavy shower, which lasted for twenty minutes, drove those who w p.csent undercover. Before the inai: platers were taken in band by the starter, however, the rain had cleared away, 1- av* ing every prospect of a fine afternoon: but immediately after ike race for the Guineas rain fell more heavily thuu , giving the amateurs who wore engaged in the Australian H unters’ Cup a ride over a heavier course than miuht have been deriied. The nlteiidaucc was, however, highly satisfactory, being greater than on the corrc&poi; ding day of last season, and but for ihe intermittent rainfall tbe racing would have furnished a thoroughly enjoyable afternoon s cuterlainruent. H»s Excellency the Governor and suite arrived before the first race was run, and remained throughout tbe afternoon. The course and all its surroundings presented a beautiful ap.carnnce, and although three or four of the amateur riders came to grief in the Huntcis* Cup no bones were broken, and evervthing passed off satisfactorily.
