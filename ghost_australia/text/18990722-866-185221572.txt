The Miseries of D Y S P E P S I A EFFECTUALLY ERADICATED The Case of Mrs. CLARKE. [From tht <fNepean T im a " N .S.W .) (87 OUB SPECIAL BXPOBTEIl ) Directions were given to_our reporter to look up Mrs. Clarke, of CToodrofie Street, Penrith. On calling tbe pressman received a cordial reception, and, on inquiring about her illness, Mrs. Clarke said: " I first guessed there was something tho matter when I found tbat I couldn’t do my ordinary work. I f e l t R e s t l e s s and relaxed, and if I wanted to go out anywhere I felt bo tired by the time that I had finished dressing that I often changed ray mind and took my tilings off again. Then I began to notice a twitching, pricking pain between tho shoulders, which got worse and i tbe most that night after night I was ~ ai#»* o h u i i * niMirn, N o t a b l e t o L ie D o w n , but sat up in bed, as it was easier to near the p∈ in that position; and, os for Sleep, why, I hardly ever got an hoars rest from ' evening to momiog. "So had as th at?’* “ Yes, and all this time I bad a heavy sick headache th a t never ceased, aud my food disagreed with me every time I took it. After eating 1 felt great oppression on my chest, and 1 would have given tho world to have thrown it up again. But there it stuck, cold and undigested, till it turned sour and brought on wiudy spasms. There always a nauseous taste mouth which nothing could remove. It Is no wonder that f was S o T h in a n d W e a k , ana of a pallid, unwholesome colour. People used to say that I looked more like a walking ghost than a human being, but I looked no worse than I felt. I bad to give up trying to work; it was no uso, I couldn't do ft. Tortured with unceasing headaches, and harassed by T h e N e v e r - e n d i n g P a i n s In my back, life seemed not worth the living, and everything was a misery. Meal times, whieh, to those who are in health, is a time of cheerful gathering, only wearied me, for 1 had no appetite, and only ate when * ~ ‘ actually obliged to.'1 "Things couldn t last long like that,' said our reporter. “ You’re mistaken; a woman takes a lot of killing, for, on and off, I was 111 f o r T h r e e Y e a r s , "Nothing of the sort; the doctors could do nothing for me. Their physic quite failed in its object. I can’t stop to tcllyou now how many different pills and other things 1 took trying to get relief. If they were all put together I believe the bottles of medicine aud boxes of pills I took would have filled buckets. Every penny of the money I paid for these things W a s U t t e r l y W a s te d , and I can hardly uDdcretaud how my poor body stood it all. It was quite plain that none of these remedies bit off my disease, so I ceased taking medicine altogether; but I grew no better. A sluggish torpor lay heavily on me all day, my eyes were di and swollen, and yet I was not able m sleep, and a t night I never could find to easy position In which I could eet a few hours rest, whloh 1 needed ao badly, so exceedingly acute were the T o r t u r e s w h ic h A f f e c te d Me* I grew very dejected. A great weight of despair huug over me like a cloak. The conversation of my husband and children was not able to aronse or interest mo. Lower and.lower I sank, and got weaker and weaker, till very-often I thought that my spark of life ^ out, and that t as about to di< dedicine had seemed seless, and I could a gleam of hope anywhere, and yet, at last, I found a T h a t D e f e a t e d t h e D is e a s e which had hold of me.*1 A "Yes, whatT" "Clomcots Tonic. I woe advised to take it, but I put being about as much use as tbe other things which I had swallowed. But I was quite out of roy reckoning, for, when I did give in and commenced to take it* A n I m m e n s e D if f e r e n c e was easily seen in my general health after holy one large bottle. The dull appearance bout the eyes gave place to a brighter and ealthier l i k . I sSon took • pleasure in eading and tbe company of friends, who complimented me upon M y M a r k e d I m p r o v e m e n t, I obtained four more bottles of Clements Tonic. I t brought my strength back splendidly, and my headache and the pains in my back cave me less troable and pain after every . dose. I felt quite . , *“ ’ ively io the daytime, instead of heavy mid tupid as I used to do, and at night, not feeling any pain /o s^peak of, long slea; began 1-1 to bo a regular thing. Ho day but what I was a step further towards my usual vigorous health. Once I sent my food away, but now I called for more, aud it did me good, digested cosily, aud I began to fill out all over. I avoided any chance of a relapse by sticking to Clemente Tonic after t thought I was convalescent. All traces of P a f n a n d D is e a s e w e r e D is s ip a te d , and I was robust and vigorous again, thanks to that fine remedy, Clements Tonic, and I need hardly tell you I ’m never now without bottle in the house.
