'CUI BOK'O?' — ? a — . ? (For The Freeman.) The red sun sets behind a distant hill, And Autumn grieves for gold- green leaves that fail; a T\u™n-° wiU, heed- may hear dead voices call. And thrilling echoes bid the world be still. It would not do if every man could tell What shadows lurked behind each open dior ; AVhen laughter comes — what sighs that went betore. . We know our own — hufc whnVi,'c «o;'ni,k«,..i. tt,. , Ghosts gravely nod when doors are left ajar, We turn and flee out to the shuddering stars ; We stand without, Life stands within the baw, ? Ana takes her payment, having journeyed far. , We hear the voice of Fate that softly calls, And stumble blindly in our haste to go ; Wphr-T^W/VLre h,er finger P°int8 we do not know, We only feel the gleaming axe that falls. NELLIE BRUTON, N.S.W. March, 1899.
