LONDON TOWN TALK. (FROM OUR OWN CORRESPONDENT.) LONDON, JULY 14. I am going to puff a book, it is not often that I indulge in this deleterious practice, but in this case morality is on my side, since what I do will tend to promote the happiness of the greatest number Those who read a in the volume just published, called Vice Versa, will be able to indulge themselves nay, they must do it-in a luxury they have not enjoyed from a new book since Charles Dickens was alive namely, a long and liver shaking laugh It describes how a father and son change places, the former going to school, where he experiences very common tribulations, but which are strange to a man of his years, and the boy takes a high commercial position in the city Those who have any fun in their composition will thank me for this information, to those who have not I don t recommend Vice Vei so, for it will be caviare to them. It is a pleasure to me to hear that the author IS but six and twenty, since it affords hope that there will be plenty more where this comes from I had feared that the days of fun were gone by but this is at least a resuscitation There are disclosures in the case of Mr Belt, the sculptor, which are calculated to make a novelists month water Without for a moment imputing to him that he got assistance not customary with persons of his profession, it seems that a good deal of help is customary for all I know painters got their pictures done on similar co-operative private pits, and I wish it was possible to apply them to literature If one had a name, for instance, as a writer of fiction, how pleasant it would be to suggest the plot of a story to some rising young writer, with instructions to work it up into the three volume form. I think I could write that is put my name to them-a good many novels per annum on this system I would just suggest the coarse that true love was to take in the face and then get some young lady to carry out the description of the hero and for the legal matters I would engage some briefless barrister to "devil for me It seems to me a very good notion There must, of course, be some limit to professional assistance A modest young medical student who had his doubts of being able to pass the examination for his diploma hos- been endeavouring to persuade a friend for ass it for him for a consideration of Â£250 The one had money and the other bad with so that on the first blush the arrangement sec race full of convenience , but in the eye of the law, as Mr Sampson Brass observed these little negotiations however advisable in themselves and satisfactory to the parties con cerned are held to be a conspiracy, and the medical student has got into trouble about it From what I have seen, not only of medical practitioners but of the other learned professions, it strikes me that false representations at examinations must be much more common than they are understood to be At the board schools, where it seems almost everything is taught, I do hope some little attention will be paid to the science of Humour The fun of our lower classes is at the very lowest ebb, and almost always involves the infliction of distress or pain on other people When they do not indulge in the admirable, but rather ancient, jol L of pointing a loaded gun at their sweet- hearts, or sisters, they are quite at a loss for a channel for their animal spirits Last week the re happened the following incident, which no doubt our muscular moralists who are quite different from our " muscular Chris trams -willsetdownto"hghtheartedness - A butcher, driving at a furious pace, per cents a light cart with some women in it and with a shout of glee instantly drives right into it, spilling the occupants on the road. He is informed that one of the women IS dead, whereat (still full of fan) he replieD, "And a good job, too, I wish I had broken all their necks ' I dont know what is to happen to him, but I know that if there was any valuable property in the cart be will stand a chance of being very severely punished The other case is still worse A Bailor at Birmingham enticed a pot r little lad of eight years old to mount upon his back under pretence of teaching him to swim in a canal, having reached the middle of it be slips from under him and shares to the bank, and without an effort to get him out leaves the boy to down On the Continent murders are performed upon a system and with some definite and deliberate end It is not six months ago that it fell to my lot to point out in these columns how in Germany the doctors were having a bad time of it by being called up to visit patients who were in reality assassins, and who. instead of paying fees, took both the physician a money and his life In France this ingenious plan has now been imitated with the pleats in country districts Like the doctors, these poor pastors must go when they are sent for, and the lambs who require their services being always in extremis, they carry with them the sacred vessels used for the administration of the last rites which are generally of so id silver The vessels are what the back men go for This is really very hard Things may come to that pass that folks will never see a clergyman except in company of a policeman These things, however are but continental Tor a purely English affair, let me introduce to your notice a gentleman of Chatham, who has had a dispute with the burial board of that locality, because they will not permit him to put Esquire on his father a tombstone It is not very long since a clergyman of the Established Church got into hot water and water in my opinion very properly hot-because be refused the title of " Reverend to a Nonconformist minister But then that divine was alive After one is dead it really seems to me that titles of courtesy are not of great importance Is it possible that it is imagined they are necessary as introductions in the next world ' In that case, perhaps a decree at the Uni- versity may be of some use Would the burial board of my parish, I wonder, refuse permission to me to put B A after my name I hope my executors will try that question One more addition seems likely to be made to the examples adduced by the believers in Heredity, in the case of the children of Mr Irving who acquitted themselves to admira- tion as juvenile actors, at the late fancy fair at Knightsbridge The choice of a piece to exhibit their histrionic talent, however does not reflect credit on their stage manager Imagine the Screen Scene in the " School of Scandal played by a Charles and Joseph Surface of ten years old or so 0 tempera, O mores A death was announced last week in three lines of The Times of one who has probably conferred a greater benefit on the inhabitants of the metropolis than any man in his generation namely, Mr Joseph Hansom Morning and evening and also in the middle of the day, have I blessed that man without suspecting his existence I did not know that the hansom cab bore the name of its illuBtnouB inventor , but I admired and was grateful to him, whoever he wftB What other city in the world, save London, has ten thousand chariots, OBBJ going, lightly hung, swift and comfortable I cannot say, as Lord Eldon said of port wine, "Some hansom B are better than others but there is no such thing as a bad hansom There are a good many bad ones, whose windows rattle above your head so that you cannot hear yourself speak , or whose shafts, too big for the animal they are supposed to fit, oscillate from side to side so that if you shut your eyes you would think you were crossing the Channel. But these are after all exceptions The majority are good and they are improving every day in the best Sort the apron opens and shuts without in ternal aid and the interior is fitted with looking glasses for the ladies and with ash holders and even cigar lights for the men I wonder does it ever happen that the hirer (sad example of the ' endowment of research is so base as to put the box, which he meant pro bono publico into his private pocket Toola prate of the convenience of locomotion abroad, whereas throughout the Continent there is not a public vehicle to be procured, even for a high price, to compare with the hansom The present strike among the cabmen of this class is deplorable and I confess that, so far as I can understand the matter, my sympathies are with the drivers If it is really true that the price per cab demanded by the owners IB in the best season 19s per diem and in the worst 123, their profits seem enormous indeed I am glad to hear that the drivers are amalgamating and form ing a fund for the purchase of cabs of the best kind, so as to make themselves and a pendent of this exorbitant tariff Nor do I see why the rate per mile should be uniform Provided only that each vehicle bears a placard with ltB charge distinctly set forth upon it, why should not the rate be in proportion to the convenience offered-to the goodness of the cab ' There is I suppose, no limit to the sense lessness of the Irish rebel or he would surely draw some deduction from the late defeat of the Government They have been beaten in a fruitless effort to make the law more mild to the Irish, and those who sent them were the Tones Meanwhile the Irish members who might easily have preserved " their bleeding country from this new seventy by their vote But grinning in the gallery in pursuance of their magnificent resolution to have nothing more to do with the bill I should not at all wonder if the Milesians who can see but one inch before their noses express their gratification at all this They are certainly a marvellous race A released BUBpcct made an application the other day (from the ground that there had been no ground for his imprisonment) for compensa- tion for damage to his He no Rule hat The judge rather wittily observed that he aup [need a Home Rule hat must be a hat without a crown What a pity it is that among the honest and loyal Irish there are so few to be found of the same pattern as Sergeant John Hughes of the right Volunteers This brave fellow was called to the front of his regiment last week and publicly complimented by his colonel for standing up against seven romans, who were using ' tery vile and traitorously grade Being seven to one, they did not resort to Ioopholing a wall (perhaps they had no guns), and summoned up courage to attack him but setting his back against a wall, the gallant sergeant gave them as good as he got and even better There are some stones which, like certain religious dogmas, however much we may wish to believe them, one can not swallow. That of the Nihilist who informed the chief of the St. Petersburg police the other day of' the Emperor's certain doom, and then put an end to himself to stop further proceedings, is one of them. The whole situation is too sublimely dramatic for truth "I do not with to be subjected to the indignity of torture, cried the young fanatic, "I would have killed you, but we do not commit murders uselessly, in coming here I have sacrificed my life, ' then he struck the buttons of his case against his forehead, and being full of some explosive Substance they burst, and while inflicting fatal wounds, left no trace of his identity. If this be true, the professional weavers of romance are out of it, and fact in Russia is indeed stranger than fiction anywhere else But I cannot help suspecting drollery-and not dynamite-in those buttons Why, who, if this narrative is to be trusted, will venture to keep a page? The phrase, "Dash my buttons, hitherto supposed to be an innocent substitute for an oath, would become a frightful imprecation The expression "I don t care a button ' would alter its significance altogether, and a lady a eight button gloves might represent in force, if not in ten nage, a fair sized gunboat So poor Phiz is dead 1 It will be said no doubt by some of the high art folks that we could have better spared a better man that one liked his works more than oneself ment approved of them and in a word that he was more popular than meritorious For my part I dont believe a word of this He was able at all events, to do what the very finest of living illustrators often fail to do, namely, to enter into the spirit of his author, and if it cannot be said that he reproduced with his pencil the genius of Dickens, he was a most excellent master of the ceremonies in introducing it to the public. Phiz and Piclwich are inseparable, and mutually suggest one another, while such pictures as "On the Dark Road,' and "The Ghost"s Walk' in Dombey and Son have a genius and vigour of their own, independent fail association. .?
