LITERATURE Original Poetry. [WRITTEN FOR THE QUEENSLANDER.] The Omen. MARY HANNAY FOOTT. Brisbane, August. The clouds closed ashen gray— Where the last of sunlight lay Like a dying ember on a hearth grown chill; And the great pines, that were green With the west aflame between, Stood all sable on the sand-ridge—whispering still. There arose not moon or star; And the horse bells, tinkling far In the distant creek-bed, fainter fell and ceased. With its crimson bleached to snow Burned the camp-fire—low, and low; And a rainy gale blew sudden from the East. And the sombre serried lines Of the vast environing pines Merged their blackness in the swiftly-gathered gloom. And 'twas then, ah then, I heard First thy plaintful voice, O bird- Like the wail of banished ghost at word of doom. All a painted scene it seemed— While the sunset glowed and gleamed— When the waning west grew cold. No ominous chill Checked the heart-beat steady and strong, As some savage-chanted song Came the curlew's call and woke no boding thrill. So I hearkened—oft and oft, For the foot of Fate fell soft; Gladness, line by line, all moonlike melted slow; And the planets quenched and spent Yet awhile their lustre lent; And the angels poised for flight delayed to go.
