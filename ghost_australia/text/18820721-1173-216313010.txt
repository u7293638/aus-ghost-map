There, are ghosts abroad—the spectres Of the happy long ago : Wraiths that rise to haunt me ever When the dreary north winds blow, As in winters long ago. Hark ! was that the wild rain falling In the dark, deserted street ? Of the litful pit-a- patter Of a baby's restless feet ? Was that cry a gusty murmur Of the wind without the door? Or a clii'dish voice that calls me From the distance evermore When the rain is at the door? From the hollow darkness reaching, Tender arms my neck entwine, Baby ringlets brush my worn check, Baby lips are pressed to mine ! Nay, 'tis but a haunting memory Cheats my hungry heart's despair ! Yonder stands his shrouded cradle, And his little empty chair Mocks my hungry heart's despair! Yet he coineth to me ever When the night and darkness fall; When the wild winds shrill and clamor, And the rain is over all! While I count my hoarded treasures— Previous trilies dear to me !— Sunny curl, or half-worn garment ltich with cunning broidery— All of him tliat's left to me ! Battered toys and baby's picture, With " Our darling" scrawled beneath. And his rosy coral, dotted With the prints of little teeth. Oh, the dainty, scarlet stocking 1 Oil, the tiny silken shoe— Worn threadbare, where I so often Kissed the pink toes peeping thro'— Baby's first,enchanting shoe! iSo with loving hands I take them From their secret hiding-place : Turn them o'er witli lingering touches— Kiss the chubby pictured face; While the salt tears, slow and bitter, Wrung from motherhood's despair, Fall upon his shrouded cradle : Ami his little empty ehair Mocks my hungry heart's despair!
