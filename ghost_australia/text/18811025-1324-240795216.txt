PROFESSOR RICE, This gentleman gave a private exhibition of his powers as a mind-reader, in the south room of the Mechanics'Institute last evening, before about one hundred ladies and gentlemen, who had assembled at his invitation. The Professor in his introductory Temarks desired that any test might be applied, to prove the gunnineness of his undertaking. He stated that he would discover anything on which any one had set his mind, bat if there happened to be more than one article in the room, his singling out any one would comply with the requirements of the test. The Professor aiso said that occasionally he would fail, especially when he suffered as then, from severe pains in his head. Several difficult tests by wellknown Kyneton residents were applied in nearly all of which Professor Rice was emminently successful, proving conclusively that he posses'ses the power of reading another person's mind. The Professor claims to be uhle to expose all the so- called " Spiritualistic " tricks in all departments. At the same time he desires not to hurt the feelings of those who have been led to embrace the views of that peculiar sect His object is, he states is to enlighten them and show how unfounded is their belief The Professor performs all manner of spiritualistic operations, asserting that he uses nothing but trickery. We have not space to say more, but advise all who desire an evening's amusing and intelligent entertainment, to attend the " seance " on Thursday evening, when amongst other things, all sorts of ghosts will be raised, simply by trickery.
