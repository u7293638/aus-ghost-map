Melbourne, Juu 8 TO THE EDITOR OF THE ARGUS Sir,-It is with a feeling of the greatest joy that the railway employees read the genuine expressions of sympathy towards their late chief, Mr Speight, on the unexpected ending of his great fight. It is their unanimous wish to assist the man who, for uprightness of character and a true love of fair play while their master, has won their unit versal sympathy, and it is now to appreciate his many good qualities they are anxiously waiting the appointment of a receiver to put their appreciation in a most practical form I, can safely state that, with few exceptions, the railway employes would gladly give a days pay all round to assist Mr Speight to clear his name and obtain fair play -I oura, ke, RAIL WAY. Jan S TO THE xniTon OF THE Arrow Sirs-I have not the honour of being a Victorian native, but I take a great interest in the doings and sayings of the country of my adoption Hence I read 'J he Mr m Yesterday (Sunday) I had been reading your Saturdays edition, and had been highly edified by the interesting correspondence re pronunciation, or rather mispronunciation, and also the letters of sympathy with, Mr Speight Shortly afterwards I took my usual afternoon nap, but instead of sweet repose and pleasant dreams my slumbers were disturbed by a A tion Methought I saw a figure (whether that of a man or an old woman I leave you to guess wrapped in what appeared to be paper garments the pattern being of large creeks, some crossed and variegated with figures, mostly £100 What did the appari- tion want of me, I wondered In its hands it held a large landing net to which the word " National was formerly attached The figure held the net towards me then seemed to speak I listened attentive!), and could only catch the following words, mumbled incoherently " " The time is out of joint. Oh ' cursed Speight, That ever I was born to set it Hellt. ' "Who are you'' I tremblingly naked. "His Smart of the Age, ' the figure replied, "and I come from the haunt of the fire but " "Oh I thought you must be the ghost of Young Victoria s pronounce tion, I said But what extraordinary garments you are clad in " It 's a law suit, said the spirit, "and I feel melting, its so warm ' 'Its enough to make you look strange," said I quietly " Make who look strange ' ' it said 'then suddenly grinning, it laughed in a horrible manner shrieked what I took to mean M'Culloch I Strange ! and vanished. In its place appeared the figure of a woman, whom I at once recognised as " Justice for she held a scales towards me, in one side of which sat a man who seemed to have a whole railway system running around his massive shoulders, in the other side was a small weight marked £100 The balance was very uneven, and altogether in favour of the man Justice looked me fearlessly in the face and spoke-her pronunciation was decidedly Victorian, but all the same was easily under- stood pointing to the light end of her scales "Show your sympathy, ' she said and smiling on me as I answered " Light, she vanished without telling me whether a committee has yet been appointed to receive subscriptions for the plaintiff The moment it is appointed it shall have my Jan 8 MINE. HEWSTON GUARDIAN T IN 4 ) Spelling for ourselves as journalists we could have wished our contemporary had come cleaner out of this business It is surely no part of the function of journalists to take articles intended for put cution and. submit them to the purview and opinion of persons unconnected with the journal as there was evidence had been done in at least one instance in this case And this breach of journalistic etiquette and good taste was all the worse when the person to whom they were submitted might have been suspected of having an interest in launching these criticisms and who actually became a commissioner when the original three commissioners had been driven into resignation a step originating in the criticisms of the defendant journal Evidence was given that at least one of the Age reporters had complained of his copy having been so altered as to be almost unrecognisable and 111 several instances what was represented 1 by the At/e reporters as the actual state of the Rail way department as to stores and other matters was shown to have been very much, misrepresented Vie do not consider that the Aye has satisfactorily cleared its character in these four respects 1st In subs ittniR its criticisms before their publication for approval or otherwise to a person known to be hostile to Mr Speight and who would possibly profit by his retirement, (2nd) from the suspicion of altering-. the reports of its own agents (Ird) from encouraging the publication of exaggerated statements respecting the management of the Railway department and (4th from making statements which at the time of publication tire journal does not seem to have been able to prove and to prove which it had afterwards to obtain special privileges from the then Minister of Railways to the questions whether or not Mr "W Wheeler EKcecde This functions in this respect or whether he acted with fair play in den ing to Mr Speight or throw mg difficulties in the way of his obtaining the same privileges he gave to Mr by mc and his agents we do not desire it to enter There is no probability of Mr "l"E heeled ever occupying the same office again and we consider that it will be quite as well for the country that he should not BACCHUS MARSH Lxiitrss ) So far as construction matters are concerned, Mr Speight had no more to do with them than Mr Labertouche Isominallv he was head of the construction branch but practically Mr Gillies was the responsible man The Age attacks were also altogether too personal against Mr Speight an 1 continue BO up to this very week It would have been quite possible to attack the Railway department or the last bit, Railway Bill on general grounds of wide public policy without nagging nt Mr Speight in a most cruel and artful manner day after day and month after month In fact the libels quoted in Court were not the real libel at all. The same personal element with gross unfairness added, assailed the Public Service Board, and commencement of the a time kind of treatment have been made with other departments but happily have ceased for a time his cry of wolf is the very worst kind of service which a radical journal or orator can undertake for its constituents It leads straight to anarchy
