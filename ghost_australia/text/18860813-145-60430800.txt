ANDERSON'S CREEK. (FROM OUR OWN CORRESPONDENT.) The "Yarra Tunnel Quartz Com- pany" have purchased the crushing engine belonging to the Iate " Union" Company, Diamond Creek. As soon as it can be carted over and erected a christening will take place, and work started at once. There has been a great scare during the week with reference to a ghost, said to haunt the bridge over the Yarra. I recollect some months ago two or three parties living over the bridge, on the Nillumbik side, mentioning having seen a shadowy figure on several occasions, but as I was aware they were not exactly members of the Total Absti- nence Society, some allowance was made for alcoholic influences. How- ever, recently, there han been two cases that do not come under this deflnltion. Some two or three weeks ago a gentle- man from Melbourne returning over the bridge after dark saw a white figure hovering over him, and then heard a heavy splash in the river. He was frightened some, I believe. Last Mon- day week a person, his wife and daughter attempted to cross from the Nillumbik side when the horse jibbed, and declined to proceed. This was at five o'clock In the morning. He got down and commenced to lead it. The horse made a swerve and nearly upset the cart and load over the bridge. lHowever, they succeeded In getting across, the horse being literally covered with foam and trembling voolently. The whole of the occupants saw the white figure hovering before the horse's head across the brldge, when it disap- peared. I, who live immedlately across the bridge, and pass and re-pass at aIl hours, night and day, either for want of faith or whisky have not, as yet been fortunate enough to see It. Perhapls it is because I am not a be- liever in shadows without a substance. However, there Is a watch now, so per- haps the mystery may be elucidated.
