'STUMPING' AT CHRISTMAS. A TIMELY WARNING. . ' ? '' JFrom Nepos. ' ! ,'; , i , 'May confusion wait At the coward's gate, , And honest men; have their own.' — Old Cavalier's Song. 41 Stumping' seems to be the latest novelty in the games of Chriatmastide ; but though its rather a grim sort of sport for the festive season, both sides of our political Blowhards — Ministers as well as Opposition — are at it as hard as ever they can be. The 'Outs' are making frantic* efforts to become the 'Ins,' just for the screws attaching to the latter's position ; and a precious ' job lot' these present 'Outs' are, headed by Pan juggler the Great, the Man of the Iron Jaw, Tom O Camden and Frawncis of West Sydney. As there seems some danger of an unholy Parkes-cum-Garrett alliance, I cannot do better in the way of a Christ mas offering, than repeat some of the old reminis cences of the head of this proposed new firm, by; way of preventing such an undesirable consumma tion. In January and February 1867, I was an swerable for four or five contributions to Bell's- Life in Sydney, re 'The Kiama Mystery^'? known sometimes as ' Parkes's Ghost Story ?;' and I've just had a chance of refreshing my memory. Having been kindly allowed access to the paper3 by Mr. R. F. Pickering, who possesses the only file of ' Bell' I know of ; it gives me great pleasure to place the extracts I've made from those old articles at your service. Any Prime Minister who would employ such a pair of double-barrelled ruffians as Benedict, and Myei*s or Meyers, ought to have it put outside of his possibilities ever to repeat Buch ?a pestilent coup ; and so it seems a fair thing to remind the Electors of 1886 of these disreputable 'historical parallels,' which may have grown out ?of recollection in the last eighteen years.
