NEWS SUMMARY FOR EUROPE, PER ORIENT COMPANY'S R.M.S. AUSTRAL. POLITICAL. Since the despatch of the last mail summary political strife has been concentrated in the motion of censure As announced in the previous summary, Mr Reid had moved,-" I That the present Administration does not possess the resi- dence of this House or the country 2 That the foregoing resolution be communicated by address to his Excellency the Governor " Upon this Mr Cotton had moved the insertion after paragraph 4 of the words,-" 2 That this House desires at the same time to express its strong disapproval of the payment to the Premier of a sum of £1000 out of the public funds without the authority of Parliament " Then there was a further amendment by Mr Cann, to omit the words relating to the payment to the Premier of a sum of £1000 out the public funds without the authority of Parliament, and the substitution of other words, the effect of which would be to make the amendment read as follows " That this House desires at the same time to express its strong disapproval of the way in which the Government has administered the law at Broken Hill " The debate on the motion, complicated as it was by the two amendments, lasted over two works, Bevon sittings of the Assembly being occupied for the purpose. The sittings indeed were not unduly prolonged, except on the last day, when the House sat for over 20 hours Altogether nearly 75 hours were occupied over the discussion, an average of 11 hours each night In all 37 members, four of whom addressed the House twice, spoke, the average length of speech being thus some 52 minutes Reviewing the situation, Mr Barton, in half a dozen sentences, struck the keynote, and put the issue with clearness He pointed out that it was not a matter of Mr Reid's motion of censure, nor of either of the subsequent amendments. The issue to be settled, declared Mr Barton, " Is not whether this Government shall go on, but whether government, as we know it, shall go on " The House received this announcement with cheers, and the Attorney-General entered upon a criticism of the conduct of the leader of the Opposition This gentleman, contended Mr Barton, should, at least when he delivered his speech, have taken the trouble to learn about the arrests made at Broken Hill There was plenty of time, for the news was known in town by 1 o'clock, and Mr Reid did not speak until the afternoon Yet the leader of the Opposition, despite frequent requests, shirked the whole of this important question, and said not a word to indicate whether he approved of the action of the Government in maintain law and order or no Mr Reid must have known that a declaration either way would cost him his motion, and he refrained from doing his obvious duty, resort- ing rather " to miserable subterfuges and shifts " However, the Attorney-General's attempt to force the hand of the leader of the Opposition met with no immediate result, if we except constant interjections from the more disorderly members on each side, who delighted greatly in this attack by one leader upon another Mr Barton, continuing his criticism of the leader of the Opposition, again reviewed the issue, and contended that the debate, as Mr Bold well know, had from the very first turned entirely upon the question whether the Government was, or was not, entitled to carry out the law There were more interruptions as the speech progressed, and Mr Barton warned the reader of the Opposition of the dangers which lay before him What would the world say, he asked, and how would the credit of this colony be affected, if it were known that the Government had been defeated, and a general election brought about, upon the mere question of the enforcement of the law ? This, too, with the " connivance "-he used the word advisedly of the leader of the Opposition He again cautioned Mr Reid of the dangers which lay before him, even should he snatch a political victory by means of this kind Then reverting to the immediate state of affairs at the Barrier, the Attorney-General entered upon a warm defence of the conduct of the Crown Prosecutor, Mr Coffey, who had acted under these difficult circumstances with the utmost discretion and judge front Some of the labour members, having already made up their minds as to the innocence of the men under arrest, resented this portion of Mr Barton'sspocoh, and the interruptions at lost grow so bad that the Speaker had much difficulty in securing a fair hearing for the Minister in every step which had been taken in this matter, Mr Barton contended, the ordinary administrative methods of justice had been adopted, the only difference being that, owing to the exceptional importance of the case, great deliberation had been employed Turning to the labour end, he drew an expression of opinion upon the maintenance of law and order, asking whether, under similar circumstances, the labour members should, on the report of the Crown Prosecutor, have acted as the Government has done "No," cause prompt y as a reply Turning round triumphantly to the Opposition, Mr Barton declared that this denial was only an evidence of the unfitness of the gentlemen making it to hold any public office whatever He made this denial the basis of a similar question to the Opposition, asking the leading members on that side of what they would do under similar circumstances No one made a direct reply, and Mr Burton was enabled to make a vigorous appeal to the patriotism of the Opposition The defeat of the Government on the law and order question would place a stigma on this colony which no English speaking country had on or jam under The Ministry could only be defeated by the union of the Opposition and the labour members, and it was for members on the other side to consider the fact " If they use these means to ox or throw the Government they know that they are using a weapon which means, in its essence, the subversion of all our institutions " " A remarkable speech" said Mr Reid, when he rose to reply) He did not believe that things were in the terrible state indicated by Mr Barton, the emergency could not be so very grave, or else the Attorney-General would not have made such an insulting attack on the Opposition The speech, he considered, delivered under such circumstances, was a disgrace to the House All hopes of an amicable settlement between the leaders on each side were evidently over, for Mr Reid proceeded to return the Attorney-General s litt sick with interest no maintained that the Opposition vina quite as desirous of preserving law and order as the Government a great deal more so, in fact, than certain members of the present Government had been during the maritime strike He made a good deal of the Premier's statements at the time of the maritime strike, and he also referred to the Post master General's famous speech at Redfern, made at the commencement of the Broken Hill trouble The part j spirit ran higher and higher as Mr Reid continued his denunciation of the Ministry, making light of the " hw and order" plea which had been raised If a Government was to be kept in office because it would maintain law and order, then the Ministry would be practically immortal The Attorney-General, he said, amid deafening cheers from the labour end, libel libelled the country by stating that the in union men of law and order v, as in water for a general election Then, referring to his own position Mr Reid showed that, if the Attorney-General had desired the co-operation of the Opposition, during this crisis, he should have t ion its le idea into his confidence Again Mr Reid pointed out that when he first spoke on the motion he had not had time to consider the quasi ion but declared that, even now, he would not say a single word which would catch a vote As long, as the law was the law he would insist on its being uphold and though he would condemn the Gol her most unhesitatingly on or cry feature of its career he could not condemn it upon the amendment sub mittedbyMt Cann " At lost," said this gentleman, satisfied at having secured a definite declaration of policy from the leader of the Opposition After this admission Mr Reid hastened to assure the House that he had no confidence whatever in this miserable Aduimistiatiou It did not follow because he approved of its action at Broken Hill that he would withdraw, any one of the counts on which he claimed that the Ministry was unworthy of the confidence of Parliament. He raised a general laugh when he indicated how the Government could avoid putting the country to the disturb- me of a general election All it had to do was to walk out of office, and refrain from advising his Excellency to dissolve Parliament. The naivete of this remark put the House in a much better humour, and Mr Reid went out in a lighter vein offering words of conciliation. to the labour end He expressed his firm opinion that, in no country where large industrial disputes had taken place, had a more peaceful spirit been displayed This conciliatory attitude did not last long, however, for Mr Reid, by his warm approval of the notion of the Government in arresting the strike leaders, brought forth strong expressions of dissent from the cross benches He declared, is a public men, that he could not ensure the Government for this action, though he qualified the statement by admitting that there might have been faults in administering the law Once more, however, he went back into favour with the democratic end by making some stirring remarks about the need for social reforms, advocating as the first of these changes the removal of the Customs tariff and the substitution of a land tax Those sentiments, expressed in glowing language, pleased the majority of the members on the cross benches, and so Mr Reid, amid ringing cheers, returned to his seat Sir Henry Parkes contributed to the debate The ex-Premier spoke quietly, and in a voice so feeble that his words could with difficulty be heard He raised his voice, as he said, with some reluctance, and only because he desired to be thoroughly understood it this crisis by every section of the community Refering to his own great political experience, he held that he was justified in addressing a few words of advice to the labour men bers When this Assembly first met, audio hold office as Premier, he had declined from the outset to recognise those mom ben as a labour party He looked upon them rather as free and independent representatives of the electors " The sooner," he declared, " these gentlemen begin to recognise that there is no room in the Legislative Assembly of this country except for representatives of the whole people, the sooner they will be able to win advantages for the class which they are supposed to represent " He advised the labour members seriously to abandon the idea of class representa- tion, showing that, if it were accepted, every class capitalists, bankers, merchants might also claim to be specially represented Passing to previous legislative work, he showed that, long before the advent of the present labour party, many things had been accomplished for the workers A good education had been placed within the reach of all, the land had been thrown open for selection, and poor men enabled to secure homes He admitted, indeed, that there was still much left to be done , but still nothing could be gained by hasty action, and the assertion that bad laws ought to be broken, made by a labour member, could not be upheld If the principle was acknowledged, where was the authority which should decide whether the law was good or bad After briefly defending the policy of the late Government, he came to the great maritime strike, and turning to the labour and, asked whether this strike was not the greatest dispute of the kind which ever occurred in those colonies. The answer, of course, mi a reedy affirmative, and was made use of by Sir Henry to controvert Mr Want's assertion that the present strike was of infinitely greater magnitude He reminded the House that, by constant care and watchfulness, he had preserved the public peace without having to make a single arrest He excepted, of course, crimes of an ordinary kind, inch as those Yet how was he treated by the then Opposition ? No consideration was shown, and his opponents did not hesitate to attack simply because a strike was in progress Sir Henry protested against the Attorney-General practically filling the position of the leader of the Government Then, coming to Mr Barton's speech of the previous evening, Sir Henry expressed grave disapproval, stigmatising it as "the most abusive speech from a man in position I have over listened to" However, with regard to the notion of the Government at Broken Hill, Sir Henry, like Mr Rod, concurred in all that had been dow But what did this amount to The Government had simply done its duty, and this could not be urged as an excuse for its other faults of administration If any mistakes had been made a Broken Hill, they were the mistakes of the officials there, and the Ministry could not be held Directly table It might as well be supposed that the Attorney-General had given special instructions that the strike leaders should be let out on bail, an event which he believed had occurred Mr Barton, rising hastily, assured the ex Premier that in this, as in all matters connected with the case the Crown I prosecutor had acted entirely on his own discretion Sir Hours, passing from this subject expressed his approve of the country followed by Mr Reid he would not, if the matter was left to him, give notice of a motion of censure in the midst of a crisis such as this, but as notice was given long before the trouble arose, he saw no reason why the motion should not be proceeded with He even spoke of Mr Reid in a tone of unusual friendliness, thinking that the member for East Sydney had acted the part of a sensible, upright, intelligent man " At the sitting of the Assembly last Wednesday, it was agreed that the House should come to a division at the sitting next day, but it was 20 minutes past 5 on Friday afternoon when the Speaker put the first question, which involved the fate of Mr Cotton's amendment The issue was whether the words censuring ho grant of £1000 to Sir George Dibbs should be outsider not From the first it was seen that the method of putting the question would place a section of the House in a difficulty If members voted for the retention of Mr Cotton's amendment they would shut out Mr Cairns, who on if they defeated Mr Cotton's amendment they would lose their chance of disapproving of the payment of £1000 to the Premier As the labour end was naturally anxious to vote against the law and order policy, whilst the Ministerialists were equally anxious to support the Premier, the result, of course, was a coalition between the Government and the labour members The question was put amid intense excitement, though there never was doubt as to the result Most of the leading freetraders, including Sir Henry Parkes, Mr Reid, Mr Bruce Smith, Mr Carruthers Mr Gould voted for the retention of Mr Cotton's amendment, and Lucy were aided by the freetrade section of the labour party, as well as the dissatisfied Mr Toohey The whole musical section of the Assembly, together with the protectionist labour members, went on the other side, and the result was the blotting out of Mr Cotton's amendment by 82 votes to 52 This division, however, was looked upon but as a preliminary an irish, clearing the ground for the real battle to come The statement of Mr Cann's amendment gave the labour members a chance of directly condemning the Broken Hill policy of the Government. Here another coalition was inevitable The freetraders and protectionists joined against the democratic section of the House, secure no, of course, an overwhelming majority against the amendment The minority of 37 was made up almost entirely of labour representatives pure and ample, aided by a few outside democrats, Mr O'Sullivan, Mr Haynes, Mr Hutchinson "Mr Schey Mr Willis, and Mr Melville lent their aid in this way A few labour members, such as Mr "Nairn, Mr Newton, Mr Morgan, and Mr Hindle three in their lot with the vast majority of 99 which defeated the amendment The majority was composed of gentlemen of all shades of political opinion, opposing parties being for the moment forgotten in the desire for the maintenance of law. It was only when the direct motion of censure was reached that the House, colonies from the dis- turb agreements which had so affected it, returned to its normal state. As if by a chemical reaction the scattered parties once more grouped themselves in the usual position, protectionists and freetraders returned to their allegiance, and the note became mainly a party one ghost in the "know" have long foreseen that Mr Lyne's amendment would have this effect, and that it would divide the labour party as thoroughly as the fiscal question did a little less than a year ago The scene in the chamber at the big division began seemed to impress all present with a sense of the importance of the question at stake Though every inch of space was occupied], though the floor of the Chamber was crowded, and the galleries filled to o\ crflowing, hardly a person spoke Only one member, allowing his excitement to overcome his discretion, called out, "low for the tug of war" Thus the House divided for the third and last time, and for a while, so evenly were members divided on either side, it seemed as if it were all over with the Government Many spectators expressed this now of the case, but their hasty opinions were soon shown to be erroneous. The greater number of the freetraders, including Sir Henry Parkes, voted with Mr Reid but there were several exceptions, the most prominent being Mr Want, who some days ago indicated his intention of supporting the Gol orient Other freetraders, Mr Wilkinson, Mr Gillies, Mr Collins, and Mr Booth, took the same course of the labour party, which met ides 16 protectionist members, only 10 supported the Government, Mr Murphy, Mr Edden, Mr. Davis, Mrs Williams, and Mr. Houghton voting for once with their freetrade colleagues in the working class representation, Mr, Cann voted against the Government; and so did Mr. Toohey. The freetrade labour members, together with Mr. Schey, voted against the Government, thus making up the minority of 64. When the votes were all counted, and it was announced that the Government had received 68 votes, winning only by the narrow majority of four there was a tremendous uproar ; handkerchiefs were waved; there were cries of " Resign." Even the strangers gallery joined in the enthusiasm, an indiscretion which the Speaker promptly checked. After this there was nothing left for the House to do except to get a little rest after a continuous sitting of 25 hours. Mr. Reid, upon the motion for adjournment, made a satirical remark, to the accompaniment of much cheering. He drew the Premier's attention to an unprecedented circumstance in the history of protection, the fact that the Government had been twice saved in one night by freetraders. Sir George re- torted that the Government had been saved by a majority in favour of law and order, and then, amid more exultant cheering, each side appearing equally delighted at the result, the Assembly, at 6 in the evening, adjourned. It will be seen that 132 members voted on the main division, the whole number of representatives being accounted for as follows: Voted for Government 68 Voted for Opposition 61 Two pairs (Messrs. Wise and Chanter and Messrs. 83. G. Brown and Newman).. 4 Members who refrained from voting (Messrs. Farnell, a'Beckett, and Walker) 3 Absent from the colony (Mr. McMillan).. ,, 1 Mr. Speaker. 1 I Totals
