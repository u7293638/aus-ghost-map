A PARISIAN SOARS.. That there is nothing MOTT under the sun has once more been conclusively proved by a remarkable story communicated recently by the Paris correspondent of the London Daily Telegraph It turns on the undeserved tribulations undergone by a family occupying a suite of rooms in an old house in the Rue de la Sourdiero Part of the kitchen which is a very spacious one had been shut off by a glazed partition to serve as a bedroom for a lady relative of the family who was in Paris on a visit A few evenings ago the lady visitor was aroused by a tree rnoudouB disturbance in the kitchen, and on entering the found that all the pots and pans which had been suspended from pegs on the wall had been dashed to the ground. The whole family had to woke up and make search for the cause of all this day , but nothing resulted from their investigations On the following night not only the cooking utensils once more came to grief, but the very shelves nailed against the walls fell down bodily The glass of the partition was smashed, a heavy coal dresser was upset, and some charcoal from the stove was projected into the middle of the kitchen. On this occasion one member of the family was actually in the room while the furniture was being hurled about in all directions, and the next morning, when all had been set to rights again, the extraordinary scene was repeated An architect was sent for, but he could offer no explanation of the mysterious proceedings Then the improvised bedchamber adjoining the kitchen was abandoned by its occupant and the noises ceased, but not before there had run through the entire neighbourhood a rumour that the house was haunted, und Uns repart led naturally to the place of being besieged by a mob of curious impertinents who were anxious to know something about the ghost or ghosts who were supposed to have played their pranks there. It is even stated that the cure of the parish had been consulted with ii NOW to the rites of exorcism being performed in order to expel the fiends from the old house in the Rue de la Sourdiero It will at once strike persons with good memories that mishaps of a precisely similar nature befel an innocent family inhabiting a country village in England about a dozen years ago, while there is upon record another curiously analogous case which occurred at Wickham, in Hampshire, about half a century since the victim in this case was the village dressmaker Her goods and chattels went night after night to wrack and ruin, and the strangest of noises were heard in different parts of her residence, The poor woman lost her servant and her lodgers, and, more than that, her customers, since no one would venture to employ a dressmaker who lived in a house which was reputed to be haunted Naturally the oldest, ugliest, and poorest woman in the hamlet was suspected of having bewitched the house, but nothing definite could be brought home to the poor old crone, and the villagers hesitated to employ such an heroic measure as dragging her to a horse-pond How many kindred instances of nocturnal disturbances attributed to tape - natural agency have taken place within the present century it would be difficult to ascertain, but in more remote times there occurred two examples which have become historic of houses supposed to be haunted by malevolent demons The well known case of the drummer of Tedworth furnished Addison with the plot for his comedy of "The Drummer, or the Haunted House," a play which is adapted to the French stage by Desto lichen us "Lo Tambour Nocturne " Another instance on record of a mansion supposed to be noisily and aggressively haunted made considerable stir throughout England in the middle of the seventeenth century In the year 1849 a succession of incidents, firmly supposed to be supernatural, took place at the Royal Palace at Woodstock, near Oxford, which the Commissioners of Parliament had been required to visit for tho purpose of dismantling-, dilapidation, and ultimately demolishing the quondam residence of Charles The "Devil of Woodstock" was hailed with satisfaction both by Cavaliers and Roundheads, the former asserting that the house extended to the Union was a manifestation of Providential w rath at the impious deso creation of the King's furniture and apartments while the Roundheads declared that the malice of the fiend was only designed to obstruct the pious work of pulling down the residence of the Man Charles Stuart The Commissioners had converted the King's bedchamber into a kitchen, his council hall into a pantry, and his presence chamber was the place where they sat for despatch of business Fuel was stored in the dining-room, and some of the faggots had been out from the famous Royal Oak in the High Park In the midst of their first debate there entered, so the commissioners thought at least, a large black dog, which made a terrible howling, overturned some of the furniture, and then retreated under the bed, where it vanished So said It ister Giles Sharp, their clerk On succeeding days, while the commissioners were at dinner in a room on the ground floor they could listen to the name of persons walking overhead, and then doors which they know to be locked were violently summEd The faggots from the Royal Oak vi are scattered all over the dining-room , chairs, (-stools, tables, and cupboards were hurled about, the papers of the minutes of the Commissioners' proceedings were torn, their inkstands were broken, and then pens split up They held a solemn debate as to the causes of these disastrous occurrences, and it was unanimously agreed that the person who did all this mist kick could have entered a no other May but by the keyholes of the doors faith" more, when the unfortunate Commissioners went to bed the candles were all blown out together with a sulphurous stench, trenches and billets of wood fell on the bed, and Master Giles Sharp and his fellow-servants declared that their bedsteads were all cracked, and they were sore to the knees by the tossing and jolting of the mattresses These astounding demonstrations continued for many days and nights, the noises being diversified by a sound resembling that of the discharge of a cannon and the treading over- head of some four-footed creature, supposed to be a bear handfuls of dirty water were thrown on the Commissioners, and, had the) not called in trusty Master Giles Sharp and his fellows, the palace would more than once have been burnt down The Commissioners prayed and they sang psalms, and at length the noises ceased The learned Dr Plot, who in the reign of Charles II wrote a history of Oxfordshire, described in detail the transactions at Woodstock, to which he attached implicit credence , but eventually the mystery was cleared up by the publication of a tract entitled " The Secret History of the Devil of Woodstock," in which it was a erred, under the writer's own hand, that he, Joseph Collins, commonly called 'Turn) Joe," was himself this very devil, that under the feigned name of Giles Sharp he had hired himself as a servant to the Commissioners, and that by the help of two friends, of an unknown trapdoor in the ceiling of the bedchamber, and a pound of common gunpoint don, he had been unable d to play all these bon lldering tricks The dog, which handbag in the comedy, was "Funny Joe's" once the dog, which had been trotting about in quest of her puppies, and the gunpowder had been used in very minute quantities for the purpose of making articles jump," breaking windows, extinguish- ing candles, and causing sulphurous smells It was through the unknown trapdoor in the coming that the billets, trenches, and pails UIB of water had been cast down, and a great deal of the furniture moving and trampling about the rooms had been the work of "Funny Jon and his companions How the heavy articles of furniture had been made to topple over was not precisely explained, but in all likelihood the means adopted were those which have been ent plo)odinvcr) many known cases for the purpose of destroying crockery, flinging substantial goods about, and creating general turmoil and disturbance The method for bringing about such confusion and havoc is an extremely simple one All that is required is a coil of thin wire, which is wound without solution of continuity round the light articles which are to be broken, while a strong wire is used for the one moment of the legs of chairs and tables And all that the person or persons have to do who wish to frighten the inmates of a house half out of their wits is, when they have disposed their wives according to their inclination, to tug at them, or, better, to wind the wires on to reels which they hold in their hands While they are thus wind- ing, the crockery and the pots and pans are flying all about the kitchen, the furniture is dancing minuets in the drawing- room, the pictures in the dining-room arc tumbling out of their frames, and unutterable disorder reigns in the bedrooms sheets, blankets, and bolsters falling about, and jugs and basins and looking-glasses crack- ing in all directions, while the bed curtains are torn from their rings and the fire irons execute apparently supernatural armbands The engineer who is working all this mischief may be pulling at the wires either in the garret or in the kitchen The Devil of Woodstock delusion was a hearty, political, practical joke, "Funny Joo" having been one of the Royal keepers in Woodstock chase, but the dilapidations and alarms caused by means of wires attached to articles of household use have naval s been due to sheer in the event spite, and a desire to injure the owner or occupant of a house It is possible that, if the family in the Rue de la Sourdiero who have been so grievously annoyed act on the time honoured French detective nuiMiii, " Cherchez la femme," the) will ere long discover by whose done) all these terrifying, destructive of acts have Mon perpetrated
