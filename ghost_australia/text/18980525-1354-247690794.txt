About Ghost ShipB. To tlie Dutchmen we have to look for the, original of phantom ship tales, which form absut the most familial of sea. legends.

There is however, another spectre that haunts these waters. Years and years ago a ship was homeward bound for the Indies with a cargo of specie and spices, but in consequence of fever breaking out, at no port of call was she allowed even to enter quarantine. So she cruised about until the crew all murdered each other, and now she is doomed to cruise about for ever, manned by' the ghosts of the defunct mariners. Then there is a story of Baron Falkenberg.
