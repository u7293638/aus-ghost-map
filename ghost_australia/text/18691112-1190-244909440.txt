REV. D. ME RLE-JOHN AND THE " CHRISTIAN REVIEW." The speeoH of Mr Moiklejohn, at the meeting ef the Presbyterian Assembly, eo exactly ex presses what wo think tho right view on the matter ef which it treats that wo give it promi nence in our columns :--- Mr Moderator, â€” I have the assurance to say that whatover tondenoy there is in tho direolion of Broadehurehism.now complained o, in tho columns of tho ' Jlr- vieto, that _ tendency the Itcview Jhnd previous to the dumiision nt tho editorship by- Mr Dykes. It was Mr Dykes who gave to the Review its pre sent character. I therefore think it un fair to Mr Ingiia to have each a charge as the present brought forward at this timo of dev. I obiectto the appointment of the proposed committeo. It must be remom- bered that different views obtain on this sub ject in the General Assembly. Some of na believe that tho dootriuee of our religion are better oonBerved by mooting tho peculiarities of the age by a stylo of treatment suited to it, thftg by clinging tQ tka stereotvusd modes of byogono days. Perhaps I hold tho dootrinea of our faith with aa much of dogmatism as any member of the court, yet I claim for myaeif-.-and I would olaim in behalf tf my brethren, the liberty to avail ourselvca of the new lights and _ new settings for those dootrincs and principles, which the time furnishes, end whioli tho f reek guidance of tho Holy Ghost, who is perpetu ally resident in tho okuroh, brings to view. There is more ef danger to tboBe doctrines, I venture to Bay, in treat ing them in a languago of tho past, than in the ooursa animadverted on by Dr Cairns and Mr M'Eaohran. For, if we fail to meet tho independent and freer thinking of the preBont time by suitable and worthy methods, a reaotion will oome, and movements lie deter- mined. in the public mind, when it will b& too late to attempt to oontrol them. I decidedly oppose tho appointment of a oomraitteo so thoroughly ono-sided us that which has been nominated by Mr Nish.
