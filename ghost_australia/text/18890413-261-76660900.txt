Those wbb professed ip be,,in the,,secret suggested Ihpt it ?night alter all governments and abolish ifll laws. Why they said, that I know pot, because certainly nobody was ad . milted to the laboratory, and Professor .had no confidant- This hig-hcadedinan, with'i the enormous bald forehead and <h£faig glasses on his fat'-nose-it was long and broad as well as, fat-kept his own'Counsel.

The telegrams <werc continued with ex asperating .perticacity, until over the whole civilised world the eyes,«f all who . loved 'scifencfe were turned upon that modest laboratory in the little University Of Gansweltweisst am . Rhein. , What was coming from it ? One d6es not go so far as to saylfiat all'interest "in coil-, temporary; I wsjness, pplitics, art,r and letters opfed,: but .it is quite certain .that evtlry 'morning and every evening when everybody "fl^ened "his paper, his first thought was to look for news from Gajizweitweisst am Khein. . ., } But the days passed by, and no news came. This was especially hard oii the leader-writers, who were one and all waiting, each man longing to'have a cut in with the subject, before anybody else got it. But it Was good fur the - people who write letters to the papers, because they had so many opportunities of sug gestion and surmise. And so the leader writers got something to talk about after a'.l. .Fur ;6ome suggested that Prof. Schwar-zbatim had found out :a "way to j 'make food artificially, by ; chemically compounding nitrogens, phosphate*, and jo forth, And these philosophers built « magnificent Palace of Imagination, in Which dwelt a glorified mankind no loiter .occupied, in endless, toil for .the tsakp.iOf prtjvJdi^g- meat and drink* $>r themselves and their families! *>»t. .all engaged in the pursuit of knowledge, And tn Art of all kinds, such as Fiction, Poetry.

This took the.fancyhugely, and it was pleasant-to read the imaginary developments of histoiy.asinfluerited hy this Discovery.' But . U'earned certain that the learned Professor pould keep, it for the use of his.own -country. Soithat there was no' longer any Toom'tO dbubt that, if ,ltils was nature of the Dis covery, the whole of thi habitable world must inevitably-fall under' the Teutonic yoke, urn) an Empire of Armed Peace iould set in, th$: like of which had never, before, been'witnessed upoh the globe.

There Was tint, however, the least hint in the an nouncement of the nature of the Uis <overyt'i!'- . : "'Yes," said the Physicist, speaking slowly, " Huve givcnthc-particulars to my friends ovei the whole earth; apd, as .London is'^111 the centre of then-pod, I resolved thut I would nlyself communi cate it to theEnglish." ^ .'-'But what is it?-what is it?1', asked the President. ? .

When the clock in your theatre -points to nine exactly, at that moment everywhere the same Paper 'will be read." - " " In fact, at that moment the clock began to strike. The President led the way to the Theatre, followed by the Countil. The Director remained be hind with the Lecturer .of the even ing. " My friend," said Professor Schwartz .baum, " my subject. is nothing less" he laid his linger npon the Director's arm-" nothing less than 'The Prolonga tion of the Vital Energy.'" " What 1 The, . Prolongation of the Vital Energy ? Do you know what that mearis?" the Director turned pale. " Are we to understand--" "Come," said the Professor, :"we must not waste the time." Then the Director, startled and pale, took his German brother by the arm and led him In toihe Theatre, murmuring, J "Prolongation . . , Prolongation . - . of the Vital-the Vital-Energy I" > The-Theatre was crowded.

"Td> you, Dr. Linister," said the Countess,1'" Isupposfe everything that thfe Professor hasto tell us will be already well khofrn?" ; ' . **'Thati": said .1>r. Linister, " wduld be uk» much to expect.".; : ; "For me," heriLadyship went on de licately, " I love to catch science on .the wing-^-on the .wing-on htr lighter moods, when she has- something really popular to tell.". Dr. Linisur boned. Then his eyes met those of the beautiful jprl sitting be low him, and he leaned and whispered': »? I looked: fori'you everywhere .last, night. You had led me to under stand " . j " We went nowhere, after.all. Mamma fancied she had a bad cold." : '"Then this evening. May I te quite sure?" . ... -j '.| ' His voice-dropped, and his fingers met Iters beneath the 'fan. She idrew. them; away.'quickly with a blush.- i- . '. <" Yes,',' she whispered, " you rtiay find mc to-night at Lady Chatterton's or Lady IngleJ^'s.": Fiom which we can understand .that this young 13r. Linister wat quite a man in society.. He was young : be had Al ready a great reputation . for Biological1 research: he wasthe only sort of a fashion ablephysiciin : and he would be very rich. Therefore, in the season, Harry Linister wasq/~the'season. On most of the faces present there sat an expression of anxiety, and .even fear. Whit was this new thing? Was the world really going to be turned upside down ? And when the West End was so very comforthble arid its position, so very well assured! But thfcrewere a few pre sent who rubbedthieir .'hands .at the though of a great upturn .of t-every thing. Up with the scum first: -when that bad been ladled overboard a new arrange ment would be possible, to the advan tage of ihtfee Who'rubbed their hands. When.the clock struck ;nine, a $oad silence fell upon the Theatre t not: a breath was heard: not « coilgh t not the rustle of a'di-ess. Theirfaces were 'pjile with expectancy : their lips, were parted: their very breathing seemed arrested. Then the' President and the Council walked in and took their places. "Ladie^ and Gentlemen," said the President shortly, V jhe learned Protestor will himself communicate to you the subject and title of his Paper, and ye may be certain beforehand that his sub ject and matter will adorn the ntotto of the Society-Mustrans cowmoiia vifa" Then Dr. Schwartzbaum stood at the table before them all, and looked round the room. Lady Mildred glanced at the young man, Harry Linister. He was staring at the German like the rest, speechless. She sighed. Women did not in those days like love making to be forgotten or inteirupted by anything, certainly not by science. The learned German ciiried a small bundle of papers, which he laid on the taMe. He carefully and slowly adjusted his spectacles. TTieh he drew front his pocket a small' leather case. Then he looked room and smiled. That is to say, his lips were covered with a full beard, so the "sweetness Ipf the smite was mostly logt; but it was observed under and behind the beard.: The mere ghost of a smile; y<K a benevolent ghost. 1 .

The guists. were weary: they were- in decay : the champagne arrests that decay. My discovery is of ianother bind of champagne, which acts with a more lasting effect. It strengthens the nerves, hardens .the muscle^ quickens the blood, and brings activity to the digestion. With new strength of the body returns new strength to the mind: mind and body are one." He paused a moment. Then he I gave the. leathern case into the hands of'the Director. " This is my Gift, I say. I. give to my brothers full particulars and the history of the 'invention. I seek no profit for myself. It is ybur own. This day a new epoch begins for humanity. We shall not die, but live. Accident, fire, lightning may kill us. Against these things we cannot guard. But old age shall no more fall- upon us:-decay shall no more Tob us of our life and strength: and death shall be voluntary. This is a great change: I know not if I have done aright. That is for yoi) to determine. See that yau use tHis gift aright. Then, before the people had under stood the last words, the speaker stepped out of the Theatre and was gone. But the Director of the. Royal Institu tion stood in His place, and in 1iis hand was^ the-leathern case containing the Giro or LIFE. ; The Countess of Thondisa,. who had been asleep throughout the lecture, woke up when it was finished. " Howdeeplyinteresting" she iighed " This it is, to «atch Science On the wing" Then she looked round. "Mil dred, dear," she said, "has Dr. Linister gone- to find the carriage ? Dear me I what a coknmotion 1 And at the Royal Institution, of all places in the world 1" ' " I think, Mamma," said Lady Mil dredcoldly, "that we'd better get someone else to find the carriage. Dr. Linister is 6ver there. He is better engaged." He was: he was among his brother physicists: they were eagerly asking questions and crowding round die Direc tor. And the Theatre seemed filled with mad J>eople, who singed and crowded and pushed. "Come, Mamma," said Lady Mildred, pale, but with a red 6pot on either cheek, " we mil leave them to fight it out." Science had beaten love. She did not meet Harry Linister again that flight.. And when thejr met again, long years afterwards, he passed her by with eyes. that showed he had clean forgotten her existence, unaltered though 6he was in faceand fortn. (To be Contmutd.)
