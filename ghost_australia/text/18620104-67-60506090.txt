j COMMERCIAL. . Empire Office/. Friday Evening. BUSINESS during the week bas been very quiet, as is almost alivays the caso during tho few last days of the old year, and the firBt week of the commencement of tho new--wo have con- sequently very "ittlo to report in our market for goods generally. In produco we have to report very little doing, especially in our chief staple. The arrivals of wool have been considerable but there has been a general indisposition to purchase unless at a considerable reduction on tho rates obtainable prior tri tho departure of the last homeward mail. During the week there has been' only a comparatively limited amount of business done by private contract ; but during yesterday and to-day, in consequence of a disposition on the part of sellers to meet the market, wools have been taken moro freely at th<3 public sales. Sheepskins havo como for- ward on a limited scale, and have been pur- chased freely by the fellmongers at full market rates. Tallow bas also been in limited supply,' and the various lots in . the market have found ready purchasers, both for shipment and for the requirements of the town trade. _ The quantity of hides also for Bale, has boen inconsiderable, but in the absence of further intelligence of the English market, there has'boen little disposition to operate, and sales have in consequence been made at a trifle under previous prices. We re- print from our yesterdays issue our. report of tlc public produce sales of Friday and Thursday. Messrs." W. Deon and Oo. held their weekly producá sale, (postponed from the previous Thursday,) on Tuesday last, tho 31st ultimo. The attendance of buyers was very limited, and there was little or no disposition to purchase. The quantity of wool catalogued amounted to 96 bales, of which 15 bales only wore disposed of, via: 6 bales akin wool at 19}d. ; 7 baleshandwashod at 18d.; and 2 bales New Zealand, scoured, at Sod. per lb. The remaining lots were withdrawn from sate. A lot of sheepskins Bold for 7d. per lb., and 0 casks of fair quality tallow, realised 35s. per cwt. Two lots of hides, brought respectively 7s. Od. and Ids. per bide, the latter parcel being of good avorage weights. Messrs. Mort and Co.'a sale to-day comprised upwards of 530 bales of wool. Tho attendanco of buyers WBB good, and BB the venders mani- fested a disposition to meet the markor, there was a considerable amount of business done. About 430 bales passed the hammer at a shade over the prices attainable laßt week, and about ld per lb. under tho rates current prior to tho departuro of the last mail. Fleece wools of ordinary quality and condition realised from 17d. to 10d. per lb., and ono or two superior clips brought from SOd. to Sud. A large parcel of fleece wool, in fair condition but full of seed, waa disposed of at lOd. per lb. Of wools in grease there was very little offered, and ono parcel only was disposed of at lOd. per lb.. Sheepskins : Tho supply was very limited, amounting only to a little over 1200 skins, for which very full prices wore ob- tained. Ordinary skins eold for 7£d. to 7 Jd., and fall woolled, in light condition, 8¿d. to 9¿d. per lb. Tallow : Tho quantity offered amounted to only 38 casks, the.whole of which found purchasers at full market prices. Inferior qualities sold for 33s. 3d., and good beef and mixed station tallow, from 353. to 40s. per cwt. Hides : Tho quantity offerod amounted to 650, chiefly of ordinary and medium qualities. About SCO passed the hammer at tho following prices :-inferior qualities' Cs. to fis. Od. ; ordinary, 8s. to Os. Od,, and medium to fair qualities from 12s. to 13s. Od. each. Mr. Ebsworth catalogued 133 balds wool, but disposed only of 20 bales, tho rest being appa- rently burlhened with unattainable limits. Th cr only lot sold worth notico was a parcel of well grown northern fleece wool in fair condition, which realised 20d. por lb. Mr, Ebsworth also offered for sale 41 casks of tallow of which l t were bought in at 38s. per owt. The re- mainder found purchasers at Sis. to 31s. 3d. (or inferior, and 35s. to 41s. for fair to primo qualities. To-day Messrs. Durham and Irwin hold thoir usual we'oklv salo of produco. Tho quantity of wool offered amounted to 220 balcB, of which about 70 bales wore withdrawn. Tho rest found purchasers at prices, if anything, a trifle over tho rates obtained at tho pnblio solos of tho previous day. The following wero tho lots most worthy of notico amongst thoso which passed tho hammer :-JN, 28 bales fleece, lOJd. ; Hat, 20 ditto ot 21d. ; and WO, 18 bales ditto at 10} cl. In greasy WOJIS thoro was very littlo business donc. A small lot vory light and free from «cod, roalisod 13|d., and a large parcel was bought in at lld. per lb., tho highest offer at tho sato being lüjd. por lb. Sheep- skins : Upwards of 2500 wore offered for sale, and tho whola ' found pur- chasers at full market ratos ; full woollen) skins bringing from 7}d. to, 8d. per lb. Tallow : Tho quantity submitted for sale amounted to 07 casks, tho wholo of which were disposed of nt tho following prices :-Inforioi qualities, 31s. Od. to 33B.J3J.; ordinary, 3ßs.; and good beef and mixed station tallow, from 30s. IQ 40B, ? A .o'aBjr, QI mutton tallow sold, (fl 43s. Cd, per cwt.' Hides : Upwards of 155Ù wore submitted for sale, abd about 450 were bought in. * The reBt passed the hammer at 3s. (Jd. to 7s. Od. for interior qualities; 8s. to 10B. for medium 5 and 13s. 3d. to 14s. lOd. for good heavy hides. One parcel of BS, extra weights, sold for lös. 3d. each. The same firm also disposed of 18 casks of cocoanut oil at £30 15a. per ton, and a lot of shankbones at £5 10s. per ton. In our market for imported goods generally we have very littlo to. report, transactions, with the exception of that important article sugar,' having been on a very limited scale. In liquids we have to notico a continued firm- ness in the market for brandy, both in bulk and in case. Holders of Martell's and Hennessy's oro firm at 129. for the former and 11s. Od. per gallon for the latter; but we are unable to report any sales at the above quoted prices. Geneva continues scarce, and 14s. 3d. to 14s. Gd. per case is demanded for suitable strongth and contents. Ale in balk continues scarce, and holders of Bass's and Alsopp's now demand respectively £8 10s. and ¿£8 6s. per hogshead ; outside brands are. saleable at £7 to £7 10s. per hogshead. In draught porter there has been little or nothing done, the season of the year being adverso to the consumption, and prices are altogether nominal. In bottled beers there has boen a limited amount of business done, but without any alteration in prices. The market for sugars is very firm. Stocks aro heavy, and during the week have beon con- siderably increased; but tho recent intelligence from Mauritius has greatly promoted the upward tendency of prices. Sales of two car- goes by privato contract are reported at an advance on last week's quotations ; but the prices realised havo been kept strictly 'private. Sugars generally are held for a considerable ad- vance on the rates lately obtainable. In toas thoro hoB been little or nothing doing during the week, and stocks have received a con- siderable accession by the arrival, on. tho 1st instant, of the: John Stephenson from Foo Chow Foo. Tho markot for rico has been very quiet, and tho arrival of the City of Palaces, from Calcutta, has added largely to stocks. Holders, how- ever, are not disposed to force the market, and wo quote present pricesat £10 10a. to £17 for fine samples of Patna rico. Salt continues to arrive freely,-but as thc present quotation of £4 per ton, is considerably under the cost of importation. We do not look for' any further decline.. Ono or two large holders decline selling at tho present market price.' ? ' . ' The markot for coffee is very dull/ and stocks during the week have been increased by a direct importation from Ceylon. In other important articles of general mer chandise, there have been no alterations in out market worth recording. . On Friday, Messrs. L. E. Threlkeld and Co, sold the damaged portion of Mauritius sugars, ox Casti. The bidding was very spirited an tho whole was placed with great ease, but in consequence of a considerable portion being much damaged by sea water, its bearing upon present markots could not be tosted. The same firm DISO sold privately, for nett cash in ono lot, the two cargoes of Mauritius sugars, ex Balmoral and Star of Eve, but being a speculative pur chase, tho price is not allowed to transpire, The same firm also placed privately the balance of Baltic deals, ex Henderika, 0 x 3 at 5¿d. pei foot. The cargóos ot Ceylon coffee, ox Cheetah, and Mauritius sugars, ox Margaret Thompson, are advertised by tho same firm for salo, 01 Wednesday next, and will doubtless test -effeo tirely present' markot rates.
