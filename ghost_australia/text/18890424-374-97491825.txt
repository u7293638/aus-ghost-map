" Young Jamie" loved "Jenny, but, havingonly a crown in his possession, decided that it would be unadvisable to marry at present' and, therefore, 'to. imike tpe; crown a pound' he went to . sea. When he had been.gone. a year, Jenny^s father broke, lis arm, her mother fell sick, and the cow was stolen. ' Auld Robin Grey' aided tliem in their difficulties. News came that Jamie's ship was wrecked. aiyL, Robin Grey asked Jenny to marry hjnaY, ^ teair.-ray mUher'didim apeak., ' ''Tier heaSr^y^'-iit''^ihiiA:-^ontn^ after heKigi|®ciage Jamie i^umrf^ind."i greeted her at the door witlPthe^SjrasJ; ' I'm come back, love, to ^u^<jtliee.' i -Jenny told her sad tale; .'bitterly, took one kiss, and ' ever.

'V ; i^There are tew incidents in literbijge j ■more pathetic than that which is "1_ fiti Longfellow's * Evangeline.' W "people of Arcadia were cruelly^ !%vangeline and her lover Gabi^B)E|ppi3te | started. Through many years the^sbufeht I ^eiach other in vain. At last ogfa£p(g:h|te! rift, on which Evaageline and;ii'er frienas_ lay asleep, was in the Mississif urged by the trappers, gUded'Spky island. Gabriel, sat at the helm:— " Alas, they saw not the raft, -jrhere itlay concealed In the willows, ^ ■> . And undisturbed by the dash of their oars, and unseen were the sleepera; Angel of God! was there none to awaken the slumbering maiden J Swiftly they^mied away/Tike the shade of a cloud on tfie prairie." So the maiden and her lover passed bv unknown to each other, and continued •theirweary quest. ... . • Joaquin Miller, inhiB poem ' Arizo nian,' tells an affecting story of a young ;maa who left his-sweetheart in. one of the Eastern States and ./went to the far West -to djff: for. gold. , jGoojl and ill luck came alternately^ and in the-feverish search theVears pissed swiftly and* almost un noted. At last he gathered up the gold hehad found and turned his fece to the Easti He did not' notice that his hair was\grey and his brow .wrinkled. He thought hewasa young man going 'home with wealth to his: sweetheart:—■. • • ■ "Shehas braidedher tresses, and through her tears Looked away'to the"West for years, the years That 1 have wrowrht where the sun tans brown. She has waked by night, she has watched by day,' ; She has weptand wondered at my delay." Then ho thought «f the joy with which she would greet liim :— '"She shall lift her head,- she shall see her lover, She dull hear his voice Hke a sea. that rushes, She shall hold his gold in her hands of snow, And down'-on his breast sheshall hide her blushes, And nerera careshall her trueheart know, While the clods are below, or the clouds above hen" i With such iliou^hte in liis mind he came | in sight of his old home, and taere, as he j imagined,. was lus sweetheart before him> ' ! •'On the, ltinge of the night She ' stoodwith her;! . . 'pitcher . . ' , At the old town-pump; and, ohl passing fair. ' She ii BiarvellousyounK and is wondrous fair Asthe night times down <ra her elorious hair 1. "Tisthe hair of gold thatl vexed of old, The marvellops flowing flower of hair; Aiid thedelicate curve ofthe dimpled chin, And the pouting lips and the pearls within Are theaame, the same, bat so young, so fair 1 She does hot know jne, her long-lost lover. For my beard's so'long, and my skin's so brown That 1 well might pass myself for another."' So I lifted my voice ajjd I spoke aloud; ' Annette' nydarltag 1 Annette Macleod T . She started^ she stopped, she turned, amazed, She stood all wonder with eyes wild-wjde, Then turned in terror down, the'dusk wayside, ' And cried as she fleo^ 'The tnan,is crazed, , . And calls the maiden name of my mother.' TV
