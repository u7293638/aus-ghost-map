BALLARAT AND ITS BUNYIP.' A correspondent sends the following to th A Ballarat Star:—" I am delighted to inform yon that the bnnyip has been seen in Wendouree. At Fi'3? s mill a few evenings ago two respectable young men secreted themselves and were re warded. The sound emitted closely resembles the bleating of a large calf, or, perhaps, to be exact, between that and the sound of a large drum. Well, after waiting for two hours, sure enough he made his appe&rance;, and rolled along a distance of teft yads, sending the water about in fine style; body like a large pig, face of a calf, witQ long mane. He has been seen near Brown's where his peculiar call can he heard any evening after sundown. As a pioneer I cannot tell you the pleasure this discovery has given me. We have no rats, no ghosts, and the spirits are a failure here ; but we have the bunyip ! For a week I have known nothing but delights. I have seen the bunyip myself. I wish I had not. Personal acquaintance with him has proved him a delusion. Alas ! Ibis has been my fate so often. I heard the dreadful sound as above — it came from a bittern— it has a peculiar bellowing cry, which has obtained for it the name of Mire drum, Bull of the Bog, and its name — JBitour, liotour, JBolattt its, see the books. Now for the other phenomena It is caused by the musk-duck. The male bird is as large as a common goose, with most peculiar wings, or rather pad dles — see description genus biziura — with which he scuttles along, every now and again sending the water high up in the air, certainly over 5ft., and making a great commotion. Go up to the swamp any moderately clear night ; voiy will certainly hear the bunyip, and with a little patience and imagination you will also see him."
