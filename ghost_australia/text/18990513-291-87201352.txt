'At first t Mb voice appears to be. thinner, but thai Jbb!-; ing soon passes away.

'The piercing eye, the gesture which ie5s oi.re solution; the {Oratorical flights all carry the audience iack to the days when they first heard this great leader of men who has conquered opposition in two hemis pheres, and who has with the spirit tit a Napoleon led his gigantic and everincrea sing army, to the uttermost ends of the world; The' General faced the -crowds which gathered to hear him on Sunday at tired in a long military body coat, -erect a^ in the days of yore, and when he began to' speak a hush fell on the assemblage and: all ears were strained to patch the words of ' the old man.' as he is sometimes af fectionately called. He began in the morn ing by telling a story from life. ' Last Sunday,' he remarked, ' a man travelled 150 miles to attend one of my meetings in. the sister colony, and he received salva tion.. That man had determined to be saved before he started, and little-^pnder that he was saved. Some people would not walk across the building-to. be saved, ! and little wonder that such do not find ; salvation.' . ! GENEEAL BOOTH. Sunday morning saw the South Austra lian mission opened in the fine hall of the Jubilee Exhibition Building. The pillars had lost their bareness, and around' the faces of the gallery one could read : — ' ' South Australia delights to do honor to the Army'fi distinguished founder. .Long live -our beloved General. Beneath the Southern Cross we greet our revered General.' The hall was trowded. there being a large gatheriig of the soldiers of the Army, who gave the General a cordial greeting when he appeared on the platform, surrounded by the officers of his staff and divisional commanders. ? Major Pollard offered prayer, and Colonel Lawley sang a solo. The General quickly rose. He said he de sired to talk to his soldiers about their own salvation. The words of Paul, 'I can do all things,' served as a foundation for what followed, a vigorous, stirring, evangelical address. Yet Paul, he pointed out, could not do everything. He could not keep away from cantankerous sulking crea tures like Alexander, the coppersmith. There were a lot of Alexanders in the colonies yet. Paul could no£- keep away from backsliders, and the latter deserted him in Home. That was what the back sliders in the Army would do. The diffi culties Paul had to contend with were dealt with in words which appealed to the heart, and the argument was pointed with illustrations. The general knew the pet omissions and commissions which troub led his soldiers, but if Paul, through Jesus Christ, -could tear out his besetting sin, yield up his right eye, his right hand, and give himself to the Master, bcl could they all. He spoke of the difficulty of those engaged in the malt and ifae spirit trade One fine fellow, said the General, refused to go to the penitent foijn because he was employed in a distillery, and having a wife ana family could not give up his work, which he would have to do on joining the Army. 'Quite right,'remarkedtheGeneral, 'we cannot get some people, in the wfaisky trade; we can do many things, but vre can't do all things.' How many . of them had started with the Army and had dropped behind. Jlany of them had had beautiful starts again and again, but they had gone astray again. . Thene was a great demand in .the cpmmei'ciaj, the engineer ing, and military worlds, for more power, but all he wanted for the Army irajs move power to save souls. The power they, want ed was Jesus Christ, for without TTim they, could do nothing. - ' \ , . . ? The -afternoon eaw another large assem blage. The service opened with a hymn :and prayer by Colonel P-epct, chief jseere tery for Australia, whose earnest words TOiMMrearnest response from the congrega tion. ' Then Colonel Lawley sang a solo, andttie Ge^erp.! began .Iris address. Taking for Jus subject the incident i?t Ananias and Sairpnira, he said that was the outcome of a »rofcen tow. There were euceessoru of those two in these days who acted In the same spirit. Salvation was a. compact, in which God ^promised salvation, and -the man. agreed to do pertain ininge.

Then he asked his hearers, to be earnest for God, to live upright, lives,, giving their lives to Him who TUled over life arid death. Never in the history of the world, said the Gene ral, had there been such handsome build ings erected for Christians to worship in as there were to-day/ never had there been ''? such' beautiful music in them as in these1 'days; bufc-'when he asked about- blood and :fire and salvation he was told it was old fashioned. They saw not, as they should see, the people falling 'down on their knees and begging for mercy, and it was because in many cases that pastors, captains,' and officers had lost the Holy Ghost because of, their broken promises. ? There was no re medy for Ananias -and Sa/pphira, but there was a remedy for all. 'Rising to a fervid pitch of eloquence, he exhorted his lis teners to pay all they owed, and if they could not pay the price they ' pro mised God would settle the ac count if they gave all they had to give. The evening service was_a triumph. The huge hall was densely thronged. Long be fore 7 o'clock, the time appointed for. the opening of the service, a crowd had gathered on North-terrace, but when lie ? portals were swung open the vast assem blage quietly moved in, .and in a few ino- ? ments the vast congregation had been pro vided with seats. When the General ap peared on the platform he-was recerced with a volley— a general outburst of enaiu- . siasm. It was the loving greeting of of- ; fleers and -soldiers to their victorious com mander-in-«hief. Service began with a i hymn, the accompaniment being played by ; one of the local Army bands. Commandant Booth offered prayer, and then Colonel1 Lawley sang a -sacred solo. The General be- ; gan by stating that he had preached two otceueni BermoiiK mai. tiny, wiinju causea a smile, but it was turned to approval by the-i additional statement that they were excel- ; lent for the reason that his had striven to ; preach sermons which would.be suitable to the -peculiar circumstances of the people who surrounded him. He selected as the ; theme forms' -discourse Jeremiah xii., 5. ; Prom these words he- delivered a long, ; powerful, earnest address, in which the ; dominant note was that there -was only one way to face death — with the absorbing ' thought of having reconciled their con sciences with the ' Saviour. The address, the longest one 4jhe General delivsered dur ing the day, was listened to with rapt at tention throughout. &IBS.; J5OOTB. ? - ? On Monday; in addition to a number of private engagements, including one ' with his Honor the Ohief Justice and one with the' Bisiiop of Adelaide, General Bopth addressed two large jjatheriags at the City Tpjvh Hall, and Salvationists rallied in great 'force to HBtcn to the for« cible appeals of their chief. . The after noon address, which was listened to witb great attention, waB. founded on theiexlr-f 'If we *ay we tave tiq sin, we ideceiye our selves/ and the truth is not uk us; if we confess our sins He jb ' faithful and just to forgive us our pins and to cleanse us from all un riehteousnees/' The subject of the discourse was sin, and' the General said that $i£ evangelist bad toM lbemin\j}Jfl%, a!mp}e, upvari^h£d Jaaguage what 4n t»p ^on-opservance of the ia^FT-|-Gtod wia «wi ai irtw'slso all iwj^tepu^^:^wieU^ , ^..' /. , ..iff ^^j^&WjV;'Sfer^ and wound up with 'the ;deviLi^I^'%ae'SBii : abmk-idea^ BUiipoBTiUt &^-o»ld:he ^K real profit in indulging it.

No -one could do more than say, -iQJehold the Lamb of God. which taiketh away' the stn ? of the world. In conclusion, the General : made an appeal to them io surrender all ] to God.' - The Town Hall was packed to overflow ing during the evening, when the General again delivered an evangelistic address.
