THE ATTITUDE OF BRITAIN. Thb wind is hushed?— Bis darkness grows ;— The fainting moon is lost in fight j — Death lifts a sombre hand, and throws - His clouds across the face of night, With parted lips and haggard stare, That strives and strains to pierce the gloom, Each nation orouohes in its lair, And, breathless, waits the coming doom, Dim, shapeless shadows pass like ghosts; Along the trembling earth they feel The distant tramp of marching hosts, And bear ths smothered clash of steal { Till, reaching ont for friendly hinds To guide them through the gloom, they press To where one ailetp figure stand Ssrenetn lofty loolinata. Thar hnrl their taunts, their oaths, their prayers, — . . \ The Bnari of greed,— the growl of hate;— They spit npon the. cloak she wears, Or grtsp lb hem to supplicate. But still* tatbough she heard them not, Bel anxious 'eyei are fixed afar Amongst the clouds, on pee pale spot^ ?Where faintly gleams a single star. By that same star ehe chose her path For every night In vanished years j Though eeiWed by mists of doubt and math, She eeea it bill!, as If through tears. Than, planning at the fretful horde Who osll her.now to bend the knee, She lays her band upon her Bword, : A»ia turns her eyes towards the sea.
