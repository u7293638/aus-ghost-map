THE BENDIGO GHOST SCARE. The ghost scare, which has been the Bendigo sensation of the past week, has led to a youth named Eugene George Johnson being placed in an awkward predicament on Tuesday night. Johnson's mother had been frightened, and, imbued with a desire to prevent a repetition he sallied forth. after dark attired in an old dross and armed with an iron bar, prepared to lure tho masquerader into showing himself. John- sou's appearance attracted attention, and some one. apparently with little sympathy for his mission, handed him over to the police, and ho was locked up on a charge of behaving in an insulting manner. Ho was shortly afterwards bailed out. There was an extraordinary scone outside the city wutchliuuso during Johnson's detention, largo crowds of people having rushed from all quarters, under tho belief that tho ' ghost' had been caught. Yesterday morning tho Court-house was crowded, when Johnson was charged witli insulting behavior. Tho defendant said that lie had merely gone out to catch tho ghost, which had been scaring women and children. The Bench discharged him on his placing ton shillings in tho poor box.
