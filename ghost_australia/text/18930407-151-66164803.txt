JUST A LITTLE SPRIG OF SIIAM. ROOK. Jus.a little sprig of shamrockk in a letter iwheri the tehrs?afi ai * .. Ns>.f ? Which have blotted woids together have been dried these many years. Loving lines, yet sadly chierful--hov "'Twas lonesomeo here today ;" Then'a pauseo, a'iittle tearful-"' Dear, you are so far'away." Every sentence has its token of a love that could not fail, Throbbing with a faith unspoken, though he inkis growing pale i Faded are the lines, dim-lettered, like sael ghosts upon the page Ah, that poor love ehould le fettered with * the rusty iron of age I Then that line-"'I picked the shamrock frorn that spot, dear-you will know Whera we walked and talked together oh, it seems so long ago I" And at laet--Love, how much better it " will be when, by.and-by, We'll not need to write a letter to each other, you and I." If you know how I have needed some new token through the years You have slept away unheeded, it must move your soul to tears. If you still know how I love you, how I missed you day by day, Since the shamrock grew above you, you could never stay away. Take all treasures, Time, I cherish, Fame and Hope and Life at last, Flitting things which needs must perieh spare this memory of the past, Lying with a sprig of shamrock in a letter where the tears \bhich have blotted words tpgetller have been dried these many years.
