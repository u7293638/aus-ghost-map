MEN MAY DIE OF FRIGHT. ' I have interested myself somewhat in looking up unusual causes of death,' said Dr. Elder to a reporter, ' and have met several well-authenticated instances where fright was the cause. The English Surgeon-Gene- ral Francis tells of a drummer in India across whose legs a harmless lizard crawled while he was half asleep. He was sure that a cobra had bitten him ; it was too much for his nerves, and he died. Frederick I. of Prussia was killed by fear. His wife was insane, and one day she escaped from her keeper, and, dabbling her clothes with blood, rushed upon her husband while he was dozing in his chair. King Frederick imagined her to be the White Lady whose ghost was believed to invariably appear whenever the death of a member of the royal family was to occur, and he was thrown into a fever and died in six weeks. ' But perhaps the most remarkable death from fear was that of the Dutch painter Pentman, who lived in the seventeenth cen- tury. One day he went into a room full of anatomical subjects to sketch some death's heads and skeletons for a picture he intended to paint. The weather was very sultry, and while sketching he fell asleep. He was aroused by bones dancing around him, and the skeletons suspended from the ceiling clashed together. In a fit of horror he threw himself out of the window, and, though he sustained no serious injury and was informed that a slight earthquake had caused the com- motion among his ghastly surroundings, he died a few days after of nervous tremor. I could cite many other cases where the shock to the nervous system which we know as fright has produced death.'
