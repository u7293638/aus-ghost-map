OCEANIC. (For THE + ARGONAUT). Our ship speeds like a giant ghost Through blackest dark of night; White foam- locks scatter and are lost, Dissolved in nascent light. Lone, lone, impenetrable death Lurks yonder, ah . . . too near! We shudder,—the appalling breath Of chaos makes us fear. Into the deeper gloom of time My gleams of thought have fled, While to some hoped-for lovelier clime My soul's dirk course is sped. Yet fear not, fear not, for the day Will greet us evermore, And though the land be far away, Yet onward lies the shore ! The following advertisement appears in a recent " De Republiekein," printed at Vryheid:— 2,000 ! 2,000 ! MEN WANTED. If no war breaks out two thousand loyal Africanders from the Transvaal, Free State, Cape Colony, and Natal, who are not landowners in the South African Republic, are wanted to form a free Republic in a healthy part of South Africa, where no whites live at present. Time and place of meeting will be made known later on. Those who are willing to join this movement are requested to send their names and tull addiess to the undersigned in writing. .Bastards, cowards, and those who are not prepared to fight for the freedom of Africanderdom are excepted. Those who are accepted must be provided with a gun, horse, saddle, and. bridle. Kindly write without delay to H. J. Potgieter, Box 26, Vyrheid. The most wearying pari of the cable news since the war started is that stereotyped line "The. British losses were small." You can bet boodle on it being at the finish of the.acQount' of every actionjust following, on the statemeut that the Boers lost very heavily. And yet one of the dailies jibed during the week nt the Boer press censor suppressing the number of killed? and woundeds the other day ! It looks as though .the " Sons of the Sea " are going to come 't>ut? very'much on top of the " Soldiers of the <Jueen " in the matter t.f feats of gallantry in the present war. The best honor plums have been grabbed by them eo fur. V.P.
