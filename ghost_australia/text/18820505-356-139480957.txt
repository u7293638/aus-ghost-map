DE)AR S s,--We have received instructions to address to you, as solicitors to the Brackenbury family, a communication which will doubtless be a matter of as much 'surprise to you as in frct the circumstances caused to ourselves when we received instruc tions in the matter. The disappear ance and supposed death of Cuthbert, Lord Brackenbury, seventeen years ago, have now been accepted as fact for so long a time thnt at first sight we could hardly credit that we are now in a position to announce to you, as a matter of certainty, namely, that he is alive.and inEngland. The documeh tary evidence which he has placed in our hands"(comprising various letters from Miss Winifred Savage--to whom his lordship was formerly engaged in marriage-letters from his steward, his brother, and various friends; besides a large number of hotel bills, mdmoranida, and other papers .bf groat importance, inoluding an inven tory, of' certain diamonds, etc., etc.) places his identity beyond doubt," and we therefore submit the proposalwe arb:instructed to make before you with every confidence that will be ac aopted . ',We have to explain; in ·the first instance, .th?t. Lord Brakenbury's obljet:is not'to disturb the existing arriagemients. At tile time when he nwas supposed: to have fallen' into the hlands of brigands, le had',in fact taken steps t'o indulge his taste for a wandering lifo, and has since that time beonr teavellig in dieierent' parts of the, ?orld.

As, how ever, hehas expended the greater porl tion of'the ?monoey. drived from the sale' of the diamonds, ho finds himself in need of further supplies, and is reluctantly obliged' to'apply to his brother for a portion of the propeity of which he might, if he thought woll, claim tie whole.

Lord Bmraeknbury, who was lost on fliviora with l00,000 worth of dia monds about his person on the 1lth of April, 18--, proves to have been, after all, neither robbed nor mur dered, Yielding to 'an ill-regulated taste for a nomadio lifo,l he has, it would appear, spent his ,time and llila money in wandoerng 'fi~m Inhdiss to, th" pole'; but, weary of /his vagabond exisitence, is shortly about to rdsume his place in society. Ihiat place, hiov over, has been iilled by the present pcir, his lordship's brother and 'hdir resumptive, who ,will hardly vaoa," It without a struggle.
