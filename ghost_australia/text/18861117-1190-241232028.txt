Tho French Hamlot. Hamlot is n prodigious success at tho Theatre Francais, in Paris, with a sumptuous production nuver equalled on tho Loudou stage, taking nil round, and tho resources of tlio Parisian classic houso havo boon ox- hausted. Doubtless AL Muunct-Sully, as tho Prince, has beou excelled by Kemhlo, and perhaps by somo other English performers, certainly by somo in Germany. But, after all, tho English boards havo scarcely witnessed a greater Hamlot tlum that by Vechter, tlio Frenchman, who is emulated by Mounet-Sully. Sully, like Fauro and Mnjorom, insists on wearing his own board. Maubnnt ns tho Ghost, Silvam as tho King, Got nÂ» Polonins, the younger Coquelin ns tlio Gravedigger, Mdllo. Keicheutborg as Opholin, and Mdllo. Agar as tho Queen, are spoken of as filling their parts with hivh distinction. Two striking pictures of tlui revival nro given iu tho Parisian Jjlllustralian, by tho Inst mail, with a splendid critique by M. Savigny, who, iiowovor, insists that, nfier tho three first unrivalled acts of Hamlet, it sinks into a melodrama. Edwin Booth lately played Hamlet and King Lear to overflowing houses in Borlin, although tho Gennmi performers, wtio supported htm, hud to chlmo in with his spcakiug tho English language, na Salvini and Rossi played thoso characters in Italian throughout the United States supported by English- slinking actors. But our mighty master, Shakespeare, always conquers. Tho version played nt tho Francais is not that admirable one by Victor 1 logo's son, but a mora Frenchi fied variation by Dunms tho older and Meurieo; ulthonph this is proferablo to tho cohblo in which Sara Bernhardt noted Ophelia some mouths ago, at tho Porto St Martin, with Garnierns a funereal 1 iam let. Whilo Shakcspcura is At a discount in London, hu is preeminent both in Berlin nud Paris.
