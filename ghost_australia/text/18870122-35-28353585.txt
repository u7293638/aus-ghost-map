DISPUTED OWNERSHIP OF THE GHOST. A matter of some interest to persons who are concerned in the giving of public entertainments was brought before Mr. Marsh, S.M., at the Water Police Court yesterday. It appears that in December last a Mr. D'Arcy Read entered into an agreement with a Mr. Francis Dyer to produce an entertainment or exhibition known as the "Ghost," Mr. Dyer agreeing to pay the sum of £100 to Mr. Read, with certain conditions as to re-payment, &c;, and, a provision that the "Ghost" apparatus was to be his (Mr. Dyer's) property until he was repaid or the termination of the performances in Sydney. The exhibition waa duly produced, but Mr. Dyer for reasons of his own becoming dissatisfied, entered the old Masonic Hall (where the entertainment was being hold) one night and seized the whole of the apparatus, together with a quantity of Mr. Read's' personal property. Thereupon Mr. Read interviewed a magistrate, and laid an information, upon which a search-warrant was issued. The apparatus and goods were found and seized by the police at Nos. 21 and 23, Windmill-street, and brought before Mr. Marsh, S.M., for disposal according to his directions. Mr. Richards appeared on Mr. Read's behalf, and Mr. Dighton represented Mr. Dyer. After a long discussion between the solicitors and their clients, it was ultimately agreed that an order should be made for the personal property — apparel and such like — to be handed over to Mr. Read, and that Mr. Dyer should take possession of the "Ghost" apparatus — the latter order being with all future rights reserved; i.e., the fact of the delivery of the "Ghost" apparatus to Mr. Dyer should not prejudice any action which Mr. Read may think fit to take hereafter.
