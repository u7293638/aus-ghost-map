' I meant to keep my promise — never jtq return to Amborsley, for I would hot count upon your husband's dea,th; Clara. I went away, from England. It was only by the merest chance , that I saw an account Jof Harry Walsihgham being committed ito priBOi^ for the 'murder' of Budeley;' apd1 even then, the paper in -ivhich I saw the' news waa. three weeks old. At once I tele-, graphed tb England and'to this plaoe, ahd;, asq^tftiaod , the trial had not; '«^n-| ? \ ' menced.

Trust in me.' i 'I do rely upon you, as once I hoped to trust in your life.' i 'And now tell me,' said Pierrepoint, what is the baeia of the charge against :'him ?'? - '? I 'He had borrowed money 'of Budeley,' said Ladv St. Maule; ' and this was known to tho dead man's clerk. On the after noon preceding the murder, Mr. Walsing ham had been at the man's offlco asking for time, and the money-lender had refused in offensive language! He always carried his documents about with ? him ; and this was known in the town. After the death, Walsihgham's promissory notes were missing from the dead' man's pocketbook, which had evidently been rifled, for one of his papers was found near the body. It was the absence of Mr. Walsingham's papers, ana the declaration of the clerk to the effect that he had heard Mr. Walsingham nse threatening' language to his master, which led to an , investigation. The half-burnt remains of .the papers in question were found in a grate at Mr. Waleingliam's place, and his gun .waa, discovered with marks of blood upon it, although it had evidently been recently washed and cleaned. Then followed the accusation.' , . Pierrepoint nodded his head. ' You see what has occurred,' he said. ' Giles, taking to flight' immediately after he had committed the deed, returned to the dead man with the view of taking measures to cast the crime upon some other than himself. ; He fixed upon Walsingham, whose gun he happened to be carrying;' for he was very familiar with -the rascal, . and frequently employed him in one way or another. He, therefore, stole thepromissory notes; held by Budeley, and signed by ; Walsingham, and ' purposely . half-burnt; . them in Walsinghaoi's house— perhaps the ! next morning.' ., ' j ? ... ' Horror !'. oried Lady St. -Maule. - . 'For the same purpose, he cleaned, the' gun, leaving however, ? sufficient marks; upon the fire-arm for detection. A :bad; -and unscrupulous man.' ; . ' , } 1 'At this moment Lady St. Maule uttered; an agonised scream. She saw the murderer entering the room, and holding a letter in: his hand. ?' ; - ' ' Puirholt, do not lethimeome nearer!' ' What do you want ?' 'A letter, sir, from Sir Edgar to my lady, sent on from the court, and about the trial.' ' ' Put it down, and leave the room.' | The. keeper gave his old military look about, him, as though searching for an enemy,' and saluting, he withdrew. ' 'Water!' said Lady St., Maule. ' I am fainting!' ?' ' ' , When she was able to speak again, Bhe said, 'Tell, me, and in few; words, what you mean to do ?' 'PirBt, to wait until the trial is over. There is a chance that he may be declared innocent. If that is the case, then he and you will be both saved.' , , '.But then, the, guilty man will go ; un punished,'; .. -, ' That is true/,' -. . ' And a Btigma will remain upon your cousin's good name!' ? ' No. I have. thought of a means of clear ing him' from all doubt.'.' i 'Vo not ask me, for my plan iB, my seorat.' ;. . ' ' - ? ?

The man' was almost a maniac by the loss of hia infamous wife, who had ,fied, whither or with whom he knew not,' and had left him in a state of mad despair, the more des perate that his masculine pride 'compelled him to disguise the misery he felt. ? ' Heaven forgive you, my man,' said the cavalry captain, rising, ' for your victims are many. And to think,' the captain pondered, that all these things take plaoo in consequence of the heartlesBne3B of that woman, the wife oE this keeper Giles, found by him no one. knows where. So iriyonly chance is in the hope that the jury find him not guilty !' Alas!' that same evening, after many weary hours, the jury found Harry Wal singham guilty and he- was condemned, to death. ? ? : . # * ? # » # ; . It .was about nine in the evening when Captain Fairholt Pierrepoint presented him self before Sir Edgar and Lady St. Maule.. He waB very pale. HiB first question was oonoerning his coUBin Graoe,'the sister of the condemned man. He heard that she had..bsen compelled to take narcotics, but even in; the depths of artificial sleep she was Biiil praying, and oaliiDg for her brother incessantly. Lady St.'Maule had by this time presented the captain to her husband. ' , , ' Yoji will pardon mo calling bo late in the evening,' Baid Fairholt ; ' bnt I am leaving the town. I wish to plaoe. in your hands a lecter whioh is, of very conaiderable impor tance, and, which* you s?ill read a quarter of an hour after. I. have quitted you.'. Lady St. Maule started, looked at Pierre point's faoe, saw tragedy 'written there, and, with a woman's instinct, she divined that he wbb indanger. She .rose , and went to one corner of the room; where a -gentleman was busily consult ing certain papers. ' Alr. Smail,' she £aid, ' you Bee the gen tleman taikingjio Sir Edgar?' [['?, ' Yes,' replied the individual in question, and, who, iii faot, was. -the oounsel , ,f7ho had defended WalBingham.;; : ; ,. 'He is in danger of himself.. Will yon go to the court-house opposite, and.' order a couple of cbustables to' watoh him, '.and, if it can be. done, even: arrest him as he le^vea this house?' ., :',What oan yon mean?' / ; ; ,. : V I think he contemplates snioide.' ? . ' Ohl let me look at him. Yes, there is despair in his face. I'll -do better ; I'll get a warrant from one of the justioss. But.npon what ground ?' . . . '? ' 8ay — say he iB mad; :and — and has aooused himself of Budeley's death.'. , The lawyer looked at JUady St. Maule as though he thought it ; was she who must be insane. ; , - Bat marking her calm, resolute . faoe,, he smiled, and hurried fiem the room._ ? . , , , _ Before ; he returned, Captain Pierrepoint rose, and calmly wished Sir Edgar and . Lady St. Maule good-night. Lady St. Maule walked toward the door with him. V You are safe,' be said. ' Good-bye, and forever!' ' Good-bye 1' she said, - , The quarter of an hour through whioh the then passed aged her many years. , ' The fifteen minuteB are, at ah end,'! said Sir Edgar. 'Let us see what this cavalry captain of the doleful countenanoehas to Bay for himself.' - She did not; dare to traBt herself; to . eay a word. - ' ' Horror !' cried the baronet. ' Ho ac cuses himsolf of the murder -of the man Budeley, and says that by the tiuw this letter is being read, he will have expiated his crime by suicide.' , It was then she contemplated the im mensity bf her selfishness in not at once revealing the faots to her husband. .She felt that an innocent life had been sacri ficed. ?- ? ' ' '?'?' ' With a terrible cry, she was about to tell Sir Edgar all, when the door opened, and Mr. Smail, with the acuteness of hia race, 'seeing ' what was about to happen, saved her by saying, , ' Sir Edgar, your friend Captain Pierre point has been arrested upon BOme charge, and isnow Bafe in custody.' That same night, the miserable man Giles, suddenly seized with an attack of delirium tremens, blurted out the whole of the particulars of the murder. In fact, he made an unintentional confession of flots and motives on his part. But not a word did bo say about Captain Pierrepoint. Certain material points of evidence were corroborated, and when, the next morning, the wretched man name tb hia senses, ha learned what ho had done. . , He was committed for trial, and Wal Bingham acquitted ; but it is possible that 1 his actual coafennon ww bwughtiiwrat* not by any repentance on his part, but by the information tbat hia abominable wife ?was dead, in consequence of inflammation of the lungs, taken at a boll- room, where ?he had worn a very low-cut dress. He ascertained these fact3 by an application for the payment of certain debts. Then he confessed his crime fully, and threw light upon every point. . However, he saved tho executioner a morning's work by strangling himself in prison. The sacrificial confession umdo by Fair ? holt Pierrepoint, written to save Walsing ham, and at the same timo to protect Lady St. Maule from shame, was never made public. ? .but Sir Edgar himself found tho confes eion in question involved in obscurity. He sought enlightment from young Mr. Smail, the rising barrister; and, inasmuch as lawyers are naid to SDeek falselv. Mr. Smail had no -'difficulty whatever in expressing himself according to the following terms : — 'CaptainPierrepointloves Miss Walsing ham, and in a foolish and. reprehensible Bpirit of insane self-sacrifice, ho accused hifflEelf, and went the length of contem plating suioide to Bave her brother. He did not know that she had loved him ever since she was a little girl. And now all this ngly business is over.it is to be -hoped they will marry.' Three months afterwaids Sir Edgar Baid to hiB wife, 'You see, Smail was right. Pierrepoint has married Grace and has behaved very handsomely to Miss Walsing ham.' And so it came about that Lady Maule's secret was not revealed.
