ORIGINAL POETRY. A GENTLE NOBLE. Oh listen, listen, gentles gay, I tell no haughty feat of arms; My song is not a lover's lay, I whisper not of ladies' charms. "Hold, hold the horse, my comrades true, Stand, stand, my steed, and let me mount. My sight is dim, my acts I rue, And of the drinks I've lost the count." "Oh, house the horse, sweet courtly sirs, And gentle noble deign to stay; What terrors on the road bestirs It boots not now for me to say. With mighty power the Darling sweeps, (The curlew wails upon the breeze)— And if thou wert within its deeps, The cold would surely make you sneeze. Stay, stay, and sit beside the fire, And warm thyself with 'Collins John' 'Tis night, when evil ghosts aspire To ghostly deeds of spirits gone." "Nay, nay, I cannot stay, good friend, I must to home, the good wife's there; Her tongue will wag you may depend, The smell of grog she can't abear. 'Tis not that I'm a bit afraid, I fear no foe, I dread no doom; But then the wife may be dismayed, If sleep I not within the room. And wife is waiting now for me, The bride is waiting for the groom. She knows I'm out upon the spree, And won't she whack me with her broom." That night within the landlord's doors, A ruddier fire-light seemed to glow; The lightning darts, the thunder roars, And wild and weird the wind did blow. And shrieks were heard, and sighs and groans; The whistling wind was mixing free With gasping sobs and awful moans Oh, go not out upon the spree! Next morn the sun rose from his sleep, But "gentle noble" lay abed— "So as ye sow, so shall ye reap," His head was sick, his eyes were red. And wife was looking at her broom, The handle, it was split a lot; The scrubby part lay round the room, For "gentle noble" got it hot! —THOMAS ROSSLYN.
