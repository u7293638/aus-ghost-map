WOMEN AND THE FRANCHISE. de above subject is ouo of groat nportuuce, aud has attracted the attention of the greatest political philosophers of the age. The Attorhkt-G knerai., vlieu addressing the Inst Temperance t’onvtution held at Hobart ou the subject of Woman Franchise, impressed ou the ladie6 present that if the)* obtained the political wedge that they wished for, it was to be hoped that they would use it wisely and well. A. large number of people pooh-pooh tho idea of giving a woman a vote on the ground that they would not knowhow to uso it if they got it. This is rrant nonsense. If womco have a ight to the franchise, which they ■doubledly have, is it not wrong aud uujust to exclude them from exercising that right ? Some people fear that if we were to allow every omau to exercise her rights they ould perhaps toon divest themselves of certain attributes which sickly writers ascribe to them. This is simply raising a ghost. Hot- headed Conservatives arc particularly afraid of females, both old and young (old maids are the worst of all), and because they* era afraid they say that they should be disfranchised — a woman pays the taxes, obeys the laws, and pays her way, aud if she doss this why should she not be allowed a controlling influence the councils of the nation. There a small section of the community who say that if once women take up political subjects the men ill have to stay at home aud rock the baby’s cradle. Well, after all, we would prefer seeing men engaged this occupation rather than lounging about neglecting their business their wives aud family's interests, and with not two ideaB which they could call their own. The right to the franchise by women is slowly surely coming in, and whan the Attolnky-G bmkai. introduces Dill to give the ladies a voice in future of the country, we hope to see it go through botli Houses of the Legislature with despatch.
