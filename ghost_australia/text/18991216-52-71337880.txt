A Man of Resource. Slr John Waters -was the most admirable spy ever attached to an army. In the Peninsular War he gave Lord Wellington the most accurate and valuable information about the Spaniards and their movements. On one occasion he was taken prisoner by a company of Spanish dragoons while still clad in the English uniform. He was sup- posed to be a stupid Britisher who could not un- derstand a word of French or Spanish, and his captors conversed freely before him. He learned from his guards, while riding be- tween them, that they were going to kill and rob him at an old mill where the company was to stop for dinner. They would pretend that thoy shot him because of his attempt to escape. On reaching the mill the dragoons dismounted and went into the house, leaving their prisoner outside, in the hope that he would attempt to escape. The instant they were out of sight, Waters threw his cloak upon a neighboring olive bush, and mounted his cocked hat on top. Some empty flour sacks lay on the ground, and into one of them he crawled. A moment later the dragoons came out, fired their carbines at the supposed pri- soner, and galloped oil, intending to return later to rifle the body. \- A horse, loaded with sackB of flour, stood near the door, and Sir John, still enveloped in the, sack, managed to throw himself on the horse's back, as if he were part of the load. > The owner at length ; came out, mounted, and rode away without de- tecting the peculiar contents of ono of the sacks. When far enough away for safety, Waters, find- ing his position most uncomfortable, managed to free himself from the sack, and sat up. The horseman, chancing to look round, beheld the man covered with flous, and took him to be a ghost perched behind him. -Terrified at the sight, he fell over in a swoon, and the supposed ghost thrust him to the ground and galloped off. . ~ Sir John reached the English camp witLout fur- ther adventure, and was warmly greeted by Wel- lington.
