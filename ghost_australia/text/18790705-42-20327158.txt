An Uncommon Sort of Spectre. I. THE ancient castle of Weinstein, on the upper Rhine, was, as everybody knows, inhabited in the autumn of 1352 by the powerful Baron Kalbs<*> braten, better known in those parts as Old Twenty Flasks, a sobriquet derived from hifl reputed .daily capacity for ,the product of the vineyard. The baron had many other admirable qualities. _ He was a, genial, whple>Bouled, publio-Bpirited gentleman, and robbed, murdered, burned, pillaged,' and drove up the steep sides of the , Weinstein his neighbors' cattle, wives, and suters, .with a hearty bonhomie that won for him fche un affected esteem of his contemporaries, j .One evening the good Baron sat alone in the .great hall of Weinstein, in a partiqularly happy , mood. Be had dined well, aa was his habit, and twenty empty bottles stood before him in a row typon the table, like a train of delightful memories of the recent past. But the Baron had another reason to be satisfied with himself and with the world. The consciousness that he had . that, day become a parent lit up his countenance with a tender glow that mere wine cannot im part. . "Whatho ! Without IHi 1 Senesohal!" he presently shouted in a tone that made the twenty empty bottles ring as if they were glasses, while a score of suite of his anpntors' armor hanging around the wa)ls gave jOut in accompaniment a deep metallic baas. The •eneaohal was speedily at his aide. j';','Seneschal/said Old Twenty Flasks,'"you gave me to understand, that toe Baroness was aoing finely ?" ,; ; ''Xsaa told," replied thy Seneschal, "that .her ladnhip is doing as well as could he expected." .The Baron mused in silanoe for a .momeat, absently regarding the empty bottles. " Yott also jntye, ma to understand," he ooßtinnad, "that linen were " r "Four," said the Seneschal, gravely, "I am crediblyinformed,that there are four, ail boja," . " That," exclaimed the Baron, with a glow of , honest prjde, bringing a brawny fist dqwn upon .tte^taWa— ''that, ia these days, when the abominable doctrines of Malthas, aw faiawg Jpound. among the upper pluses, is ,what I «*U .creditable—creditable, by ( Saint Christopher, if I .dasayitl" . His eyes rested again upon the worty Wiles, "Ithiiik, seneschal?'hi «ld>d,ti^ We£ pause, "thatuudee |he dintimptaoasji we om^ U fljpre,,<m4n«Jtli Vf*m*? flask for with, and of to* best What say* your .Exoetymoy to the vintage ot.UOt, the year of to* comet?" .,., , . . , .

"4. pious otoj man, a traveller, is in the paatle yard, my lord, seeding shelter and a sapper. He oemes from beyond the Alps, and fans toward ."f presume." said the Baron, with an sir of indifference, "that he had bean duly searched for plunder.", . " TJe passed this morning," replied the. retainer, " through the domain of your well-born oousin, Count Conrad of Schwinkenfela. Tour lordship will readily understand that he has nothing now save a few beggarly Swiss coin* of copper." " My worthy Cousin Conrad 1" exclaimed the Baron, affectionately. "It is the one great mis fortune of my life that I live to the leeward of Schwinkenfels. But you relieved the pious man 0^ his copper ?" v , ?• My lord," Baid the seneschal, with an apolo getic smile, " it was not worth the taking." " Now, by my soul I" roared the Baron, " you exasperate me. Coin, and not worth the taking t .Perhaps notfor its intrinsic value, but you should have cleaned him out as a matter of principle, you fool I" " . • \- The seneschal hung his head and muttered an explanation. At the same time be opened the tweoty-fint bottle. "Never," continued the Baron, lees violently but still severely, "if you value my esteem and your own paltry Bkin, suffer yourself to be swerved a hair's breadth from principle by the apparent insignificance of the loot. A conscientious atten tion to details is one of the fundamental elements of a prosperous career—in fact, it underlie* all political economy." The withdrawal of the cork from the twenty second bottle emphasised this sentiment. , "However," the Baron went on, somewhat mollified, " this is not a day on which I can con sistently make a fuss over a trifle. Four, and all boys! This is a glorious day for Weinstein. Open the two remaining flasks, seneschal, and show the pious straoger in, I fain would amuse myself with him." 11. Viewed through the Baron's twenty odd bottles, the stranger appeared to be an aged man —eighty years, if a day. He wore a shabby gray cloak and carried a palmer's staff, and seemed an innocuous old fellow, cast in too commonplace a mould to furnish even a few minutes' diversion. The Baron regretted sending for him, but being a person of unfailing politeness, when not upon the rampage, he bade his guest be seated, and filled him a beaker of the comet wine. After an obeisance, profound yet not servile, the pilgrim took the glass and critically tasted the wine. He held the beaker up athwart the light with trembling hand, and then tasted again. The trial seemed to afford him great; satisfaction, and he stroked his long white beard. "Perhaps you are a connoisseur. It pleases your palate, eh ?" said the Baron, winking at the' full-length portrait of one of his ancestors. •■ ""Proper well," replied the pilgrim, "though it is a-trifle syrupy from too long keeping. By the bouquet and the tint I should pronounce it of the vintage of 1804, grown on the steep slope' south-south-east of the castle, m the fork of the: , two pathways that lead to under the hilL The sun's rays reflected from the turret gave a! peculiar excellence to the growth of that parti-: cular spot. But your rascally varlets have shelved the bottle on the wrong side of the: oellar. It should have been put on the dry Bide, near where your doughty grandsire, Sigiamund I yon Weinßtein, the Hairy Handed, walled his third wife in preparation for a fourth." The Baron regarded his guest with a look of, amazement "Upon my life," said he, "but you ; appear to be familiar with the ins and outs of this ! establishment." "If I do;" rejoined the stranger, composedly sipping his wine, "'tis n6 more than natural, for . I lived more than sixty years under this roof, and : . know its every leak. I happen to be a yon Weiu-' stein myself. | The Baron crossed himself, and pulled his chair a little further away from the bottles and the ' stranger. , " Oh, no 1" said the pilgrim, laughing ; "quiet t ', your fears. lam aware that every well regulated ' castle has an ancestral ghost, but my flesh and blood are honest. I was lord of Weinstein till I went, twelve yean ago, to study metaphysics in 1 the Arabic schools, and the cursed scrivepers wrote me out of the estate. Why, I know this hall from infancy. Yonder is the fire-place at which I used to warm my baby toes. There ia the identical suit of armor into which I crawled when a boy of six and bid till my sainted mother—heaven rest < her !—nigh died of fright. It seems but yegter- ■ day.

You must pardon ' the garrulity of an old man who has come to re visit the home of his childhood and prime." The Baron pressed his hand to his head., " I have lived in this castle myself for half a century," ■aid he, "and am tolerably familiar with the history of my immediate progenitors, but I can't say I ever, had the pleasure of your acquaintance. However, permit me to fill your glass." "It is good wine," said the pilgrim,holding out his glass. "Except, perhaps, the vintage of J892, when the grapes " The Baron started at his guest v The grapes of ,1902," he said, dryly, <Plack forty yeai/of ripening.

Pray proceed with your very interesting reminiscences, and do not spare the wine." " I never practise magio," quietly replied the pilgrim, " and aa to being an impostor, scan well my face. Don't you recognise the family nose, thiok. short, and generously colored ? How about the three lateral and two diagonal wrinkles on my brow? I see them there on yours. A/c not my chaps Weinstein chaps ? Look closely. I court investigation." ' " You do look damnably like us," the Baron admitted. " I was the youngest," the stranger went on, of quadruplets. My three brothers were puny sickly things, and did not long survive their birth. As a child I was the idol of my poor father, who had some traits worthy of respectful mention, guzzling old toper and unconsc jnable thief though he was." The Baron winced. "They used to call him Old Twenty Flasks. It is my candid opinion, based on memory, that Old Forty Flasks would have been nearer the truth." "It's a lie r shouted the Baron. "I rarely ex oeeded twenty bottles." " And as for his standing in the community," the pilgrim went on, without taking heed of the interruption, " it must be confessed .that nothing could be worse. He was the terror of honest folk for miles around. Property rights were ex tremely insecure in this neighborhood, for the rapacity of my lamented parent knew no bounds. Yet nobody dared to complain aloud, for lives were not much safer than sheep or ducats. How the people hated his shadow, and roundly cursed him behind his back 1 I remember well that, when I was about fourteen—it must have been in '66, the year the Grand Turk occupied Adrianople—tall Hugo, the miller, called me up to him, and said : ' Boy, thou hast a right pretty nose.' 'It is a pretty nose, Hugo,' said I, straightening up. 'Is it on firm and strong?' asked Hugo, with a sneer. ' Firm enough, and strong enough, I dare say,' I answered ; ' but why ask such a fool's question ?' ' Well, well, boy,' said Hugo, turning away ; ' look sharp with thine eyes after thy nose when thy father is unoccupied, for he has just that conscience to steal the nose off his son's face in busk of better plunder.'" "By St. Christopher!" roared the Baron, "tall Hugo, the miller, shall pay for this. I always suspected him. By St. Christopher's burden, I'll break every bone in his vilknous body." " 'Twould be an ignoble vengeance," replied the pilgrim, quietly, " for tall Hugo has been in bis grave these sixty years." "True," aaid the Baron, putting both hands to bia head, and gazing at his guest with a look of utter helplessness. " I forgot that it is now next century—that is to Bay, if you be not a Bpectre." " You will excuse me, my respected parent," returned the pilgrim, "if I subject your hy pothesis to the teat of logic, for it touches me upon a very tender Bpot, impugning, as it does, my physical verity and my (status ad an actual individualised Ego. Now, what is our relative position ? Ton acknowledge the date of my birth to have been the year of grace 1352. That is a matter in which your memory is not likely to be at fault On the other hand, with a strange in consistency, you tn»intj»n t m t Qe face of almanacs, chronologies, and the march of events, that it is still the year of grace 1552. Were you one of the seven sleepers, your hallucination (to use no harsher term) might be pardoned ; but you are neither a aleeper nor a saint Now, every one of the eighty years that are packed away in the carpet bag of my experience protests against your extraordinary error. It is I who have a primd facie right to question your physical existence, not you mine. Did you ever hear of a ghost, spectre, wraith, apparition, eidolon, or spook coming out of the future to haunt, annoy, or frighten individuals of an earlier generation?" The Baron was obliged to admit that he never had. " But you have heard of instances where ap paritions, ghosts, spooks—call them what you will —have invaded the Present from out the limbo of the Past ?" The Baron crossed himself a second time, and peered anxiously into the dark corners of the apartment "If you are a genuine yon Wein stein," he whispered, "you already know that this castle is overrun with spectres of that sort It ia difficult to move after nightfall without tumbling over half a dozen of them." "Then," said the placid logician, "you sur render your case. You commit what my revered preceptor in dialectics, the learned Arabian, Ben i>usty, used to style syllogistic suicide. For you allow that, while ghosts out of the future are .unheard of, ghosts from the past are not unfre quently encountered. Now, I submit to you, as a candid man, this proposition : That it is in finitely more probable that you are a ghost than that I am one I" The Baron turned very red. "Is this filial," he demanded, "to deny the flesh and blood of your own father ?" "Is it paternal," retorted the pilgrim, not losing his composure, "to insinuate the unreal* ness of the son of your own begetting f" " By all the saints t" growled the Baron, grow ingstill redder," this question shall be Bettled, and speedily. Halloo,there,seneschal!" He called again and again, but in vain, . "Spareyour lungs," calmly suggested the pil grim, " The best trained domestic in the world will not stir.from beneath the sod for all your shouting." ■ Twenty Flasks tank back helplessly ia his chair. He tried to speak, but bis tongue and throat re pudiated their functions. They only gurgled. ?That is right," said his guest, approvingly. " Conduct yourself as befits a venerable and re ■peotable ghost from the last century. A well pehated apparition neither blusters nor is violent. You can well afford to be peaceable in your de portment now; you were turbulent enough before jour death," " My death V gasped the Baron. : "Excuse me," apologised the pilgrim, "forte, fa-ring to that unpleasant event" "My death !" stammered the Baron, his hair standing on end. " I should like to hear the par- Heul»rs." " I was hardly more than fifteen at the time," said the pilgrim musingly ; " but I shall never forget the most trifling circumstance of the great popular uprising that put an end to my worthy sire's career. Exasperated beyond endurance by your outrageous crimes, the people for miles around at last rose in a body, and, led by my old friend, tall Hugo, the miller, flocked to Schwin kenfels, and appealed to your cousin, Count Conrad, for protection against yourself, their natural protector. Yon Schwinkenfels heard their complaints with great gravity. He replied that he had long watched your abominable actions with distress and consternation ; that he had frequently remonstrated with you, but in vain ; that he regarded you as the scourge of the neigh borhood ; that your castle was full of blood stained treasure and shamefully acquired booty, and that he now regarded it as the personal duty of himself, the conservator of lawful order and good morals, to march againßt Weinstein, and exterminate you for the common good." "The hypocritical pirate I" exclaimed Twenty Flasks. "Which he proceeded to do," continued the pilgrim, " supported not only by his retainers, but by your own. I must say that you made a sturdy defence. Had not your rascally seneschal sold you out to Schwinkenfels, and let down the drawbridge one evening when you were as usual fuddling your brains with your twenty bottles, perhaps Conrad never would have gained an entrance, and my young eyes would have been spared the horrid task of watching the body of my venerated parent dangling at the end of a rope from the topmost turret of the north-west tower." The Baron buried his face in his hands and began to cry like a baby. " They hanged me, did they The faltered. " I am afraid no other construction can be put on it," said the pilgrim. "It was the inevitable termination of such a career as yours had been. They hanged you, they strangled you, they chocked you to death with a rope; and the unanimous verdict of the community was Justi fiable Homicide. You weep ! Behold, father, I also weep for the shame of the house of yon Weinstein ! Come to my arms." Father and son clasped each other in a long, affectionate embrace, and mingled their tears over the disgrace of Weinstein. When the Baron recovered from his emotion he found him self alone with his conscience and twenty-four empty bottles. The pilgrim had disappeared. Meanwhile in the apartments consecrated to the offices of maternity all had been confusion, turmoil, and distress. In four huge armchairs sat four experienced matrons, each holding in her lap a pillow of swansdown. On each pillow had reposed an infinitesimal fraction of humanity, recently added to the sum total of yon Wein stein. One experienced matron bad dozed over her charge ; when she woke the pillow in her lap was unoccupied. An immediate census taken by the alarmed attendants disclosed the startling fact that, although there were still four arm chairs, and four sage women, and four pillows of Bwansdown, there were but three infants. The Beneßchal, as an expert in mathematics and ac counts, was hastily summoned from below. His reckoning merely confirmed the appalling sus picion. One of the quadruplets was gone. Prompt measures were taken in this fearful emergency. The corners of the rooms were ran- Backed in vain. Piles of bedclothing and baskets of linen were searched through and through. The hunt extended to other parts of the castle. The seneschal even sent out trusted and discreet retainers on horseback to scour the country. They returned with downcast countenances ; no trace of the lost yon Weinstein had been found. During one terrible hour the wails of the three neglected infants mingled with the screams of the hysterical mother, to whom the attention of the four sage women was exclusively directed. At the end of the hour her ladyship had suffi ciently recovered to implore her attendants to make a last, though hopeless, count. On three pillows lay three babies howling lustily in unison. On the fourth pillow reposed a fourth infant, with a mysterious smile upon its face, but cheeks that bore traces of recent tears.— New York Sun.
