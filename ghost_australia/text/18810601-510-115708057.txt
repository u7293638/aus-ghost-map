Nimitybelle. May 30th 1881.— The weather here of late has been cold and bleak, with occasional showers of rain. The funeral of Mrs. John Smith took place yesterday. Despite the inclemency of the weather, over 250 persons followed her remains to their last resting place. She leaves a large circle of friends and relatives to mourn their loss, and was esteemed by all who knew her.
