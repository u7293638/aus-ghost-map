There is a comical story told ol two Ameri cans who settled a quarrel in a fashion whicsi would have msde tbe hair of a Psrisian fencing master bristle with horror, bot wbicb neverthe less had an inspiration of common-sense in it. Tbey were both in love with tbn same lady, aod it became ni oeasary to their feelings that tbey should fight for posseasiou of her. One of the two must clearly be pot out of the way. Yet why should they kill each other ?

Here were all the results of a duel obtained without its mock heroics, and without mors tragsdy tlsn belongs to all renonsistioa.
