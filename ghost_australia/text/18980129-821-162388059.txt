He tolls me that the difficulties in finding satisfactory outlets for the increasing produc tion of the South A ustralian "vineyards havo been by no mean3 exaggerated, and lie is no longer surprised that so_many exploiters bF the trade havo, in' thrrpa3t,"retired gracefully from tho contest. There appear to be only about- half a"dozon"h6u.Hos"whd"can "buy "good sized parcels,.whilst tho oidifistablished irms_ in the trade naturally look askance at Austra lian wine, while ttioy have-a ready demand for the Continental vintages.

These arrangements will not actually got into work ing order until Mr. Ralph is back in Adelaide, but in the meantime ho is turning his attention to the reduction, if possible, of the expenses -on-w-ine stored in London, and so far he has met v/ith considerable encouragement, and hopes to succeed in obtaining substantial con cessions before returning to Australia. I understand that Mr". Ralph will be taking witli lnm valuahlo information as to many causes of disappointment in tho past to shippers of wine from Australia, and upon his arrival in tho colony he will bo giving tho vignerons the benefit of his investigations. For the past y oar or two the importation of American horses into BelgmtVi has increased in enormous proportions (says tho Liverpool -Jouxnal.of...< om>nere.e). Kv.erysliip.ment that arrives in Antwerp is larger than the previous one. A*t many as from soven to nine hundred are arriving por week, with the result that Belgian breeders are very much alarmed, for they havoa] ready fnl t theoffccta of tliesharpand successful competition. Tho competition is tho more serious inasmuch as the heavy .American draught horses arc now being sold on the Bel gian market as Belgian horses, they aro worked off at a lower-price, and hence tho Belgian breeder is unable to sell hi.s animal. Tho Germans," wlur-hrthorto have "been purchasing Belgian work horses, find the American thorn in largo numbers. The Manitoba Government has lately issued the final crop bulletin for 1897, which shows that' tho estimate of tho crop yield made in"the August Imllotin has not been , realised. The actual results are as follows:— ; Wheat acroage 1,291,000, average yield 14T4, ; total yield 18,202,000 bushels: eats, total ; yield 10,030,000, and harley 3.183,000 bushels; ' potatoes, over 2,000,000 bushels. Blight j reduced the yield of wheat, but the .quality is ■ cTccHrvnt.
