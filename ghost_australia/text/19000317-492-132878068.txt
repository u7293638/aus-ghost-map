POETRY. THOUGH WE REPENT. Though we repeat, can any God give back | The dear, lost days we might have made go fair — Turn false to true, and carelessness to care, And let us find again what now we lack? Oh, once, once more to tread the old-time track, The flowers we threw away once more to wear— Though we repent, can any God give back The dear lost days we might have made so fair ? What can repulse a stealthy ghost's attack, Silence a noice that doth the midnight dare, Make fresh hopes spring from grave-sod of de- spair, Set free a tortured soul from memory's rack ? Though we repent, can any God give back The dear, lost days we might have made so fair ?
