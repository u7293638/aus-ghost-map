THE FEDERATION BANQUET. ———o——— A BRILLIANT CEREMONY. INTRODUCTION. It was only fitting, and in accord with our tradition« as Englishmen or descendants of Englishmen, that the commencement of the Federation Convention should be markod by a grand banquet — a banquet, too, which exceeded in importance any which have hitherto been held in Sydney, and which has only been exceeded in size by one great dinner — that given in the Exhibition Building at the time of the Centennial celebrations in 1888. There may have been more persons present at that dinner but the significance of the occasion was by no means so great. Three years ago we celebrated an anniversary ; to- day we celebrate the advent of a new born national movement — the creation of a desire for unity rather than for separation. And if the banquet last night served no other ourpnso xhan io illustrate this, it certainly served a good purpose The Centennial Hnll, in which the banqnot was held m certainly the mo«t suitable building in tho city for a .purpose Buoh as this Tn foct, no other building could havo hold with comfort some 900 diners, and a largo number of lodv spectators Thoro was ample room for all Seven long tables ran frosn end to end of tho hall, and nt the top, just ander tho groat organ, was the cross tahlo raised on a dais, «hero the chairman and Iho moro prominent truest« were accommodated VII around the gallery were flags and shields nnd emblems, whilst from avery pillar hung festoons of greenery, altcrnatol with incandescent light« in various colours which contrasted well against tho dark ccdarwork of tho gallones Beyond this littlo attempt had boon mado to doeorate tho magnificent ball, which indoed does not require ornamenta- tion in any way, and is better loft alone The guests on arrival wore received in the ves- tibule of tho Town Hall by Sir Henry Parkes *nd other members of the "itmiBlry Shortly after T -the chairman, Sir Henry I nrkci, took his seat, with lord Jersoy on his right hand and Mr Munro, Prvmior ?of Victoria, on his loft Tho loyal toasts wera treated .with, perhaps, a little moro cet'imony than asnal as Sir Henry considered it necessary to make a brief nddress when proposing tho health of the Qu,con, a toaBt which IB usually accepted as a formal one He also mado a fow complimentary remark« when pronoiing Lord Jorsoy's health opening tho way for his Fxeel lency's speech in roplv, which contained many graceful allusions to federation The great speech of the evening was, of course, Sir Henry's on the toast, "One People, One Destiny." The venerable politician was in a happy mood. He had already dealt pleasantly and lightly with the hors iiPoui res, tho preceding toasts and now the time had tcomo for his great effort, for the inculcation as ha, put lit, of peace and t,oodwill and union between all theea j great Colonies The time had como when this Australian | >poonlo should ho one-hencoforwnrd and forerver- should make common cause and inherit ono common destiny lhere was no doubt as to the approval which.those sentiments mot with from tho audience Thcro waa a general outbreak of applause, and then Sir Henry went in to show that federation must come and no power on earth could throw it bick The "Victonnro Premior, Mr Munro, who followed Sir Honrv, took a lina equally favourablo to federation tho question which they had como hero lo consider being, an he pointed out, not the desirableness or otherwise of federating- that was already admitted.
