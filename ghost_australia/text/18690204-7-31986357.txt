RAILWAY NEGLECT. TO THE EDITOR I am, Sir, &c.;, PREVENTION. airâ€”On Monday evening last the driver of the engine from die Port never sounded the whistle on approaching the level crossing at Bowden. I was very near to him at the time. ana called, the attention of a lady to the fact - nor did he sound the whistle before stopping at the Morphett-street crossing. I called ibiuie lady's attention to it, and also several other* who were in tho carriage at the time. I also spoke to the person who took the tickets abont it, and he seemed to beat the matter mrr cavalierly, bnt before I left tie puSornThT came to me and said he hoped X would tafeexro farther notice of it, as the driver was a new hand. Feeling then that I did not dashs to injure the dmer, and supposing it would be a warning not to commit the same thing again, I refrained from mentioning the matter, bat tan induced to do so now because I saw last evening again a level crossing passed by a train without even a ghost of a warning given. I know not if the engine was driven by the same person or not, neither is that of any moment. The fives of the public are not to be placed in jeopszdr by careless drivers, and I leave you, He Bettor, to deal with this matter as yon deem best tat the public welfare.
