CLERICAL LICENSE OF SPEECH. TO THZ Z0IT02 Sib,—I this morning attended pnbllc worship in a large cmurchin Aberdeen- street, and heard the mini ster oftha*.churchpreach. tDjesermoc inmost re specte was excellent, but there -was one assertion -which, the preachermade which cannot be allowed to pass unchallenged. Quoted verbatim, it ran foj. lows -—"-ilanj" ministers before ^Trf^rnno- their pulpits seek the inspiration of the gny* shop, instead of seek In? the inspiration of the Ho!y Ghost" Sach a speech as this might be passed over in silent contempt, as unworthy of notice, if it fell from the foul lips of a semi-intoxicated tapster at the "bar of some loir public house, but coming from the xnouth of a Christian minister,T$Tfchin the sacred precincts of hie palpii^ and in the hearing of a large congregation, it is a gross libel upon his brother ministers, it jg ■mw»hr?gKgnj it is ungentJpTnanlv, and can only be atoned for by an apology and ■withdrawal as public as the utterance itselL I will Tentnre to assert that his brethren in i this town are men of unblemished reputation. Thev may not aQ, like him, wear the blue ribbon, J1® . they perhaps all total abstainers, °a*_ to _ insmnate (as big remark certainly i *u meaninff at all) that they I fojtuy themselves with drink before entering i iheirpuJpitsis a gratuitous insult, and a rank false hood. If eel assured, however, unless I am very mucim^aken in him, that upon reflection he trill <^5P?se^ *° uphold the assertion, but will do I what be can to remove this slur cast in an ummarded upon .ois ministerial brethren. , oepc.
