IN RHODESIA. THE QUEENSLANDERS' EAGERNESS FOR FIGHTING. The 'Daily News' special correspondent with Carrington's force, writing from Gwelo, says: — And now the sun is up, and the ghosts of the night have vanished, and the fantastic-; ally grotesque of midnight is the fancifully quaint of breakfast time, and then, in the warm flush of the young sunshine, one see3 Rhodesia; nor is there any change in the view for the whole runt of 260 miles. Imagine a huge hayfield, not fenced-in, geometrically bisected, pathed hayfield, but a hayfield run wild. Imagine clumps of trees dotted about at irregular intervals — trees wearing their ruddy Autumnal tints. Imagine innumerable dried watercourses wandering through this tree-strewn hay field, and you have Southern Rhodesia. The only break is an occasional boulder. Soon the coach passes the trekkers, ^out- spanned during the heat of the day, and a brown-faced, bare-armed Queenslander. swings himself into the saddle, and licks his horse into a gallop to overtake the coach. 'Anything fresh?' The face bent over ?the horse's head is keen and anxious. 'Nothing. You've heard Roberts is in Johannesburg?' 'No.' Disgust, and disappointment have replaced the anxiety. 'Surely the. war isn't over?' 'Not by a long chalk,' encouragingly; 'plenty of fighting.' The face brightens. 'Do you think we'll see any?' ! The eagerness of the questioner forces a statement which is directly contrary to my convictions — 'Bound to. How are you get ting on? Who are you?' 'Doing splendidly — only lost one horse — Queenslanders under Captain Hockings— got any papers?' 'Sorry. What do you think of Rhodesia?' 'It's — it's a great country,' cautiously. 'It's a very nice country to see, but we'd rather see some fighting — Good-bye!' The rider wheels, and the journalist sinks back to his seat to ruminate upon the bloodUiirstiness of the average Australian.
