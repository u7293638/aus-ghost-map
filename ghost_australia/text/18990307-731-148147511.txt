WHO'S AFRAID. fTo, the Editob.1 Sib, — I am becoming disgusted at. the turn of events, and although a Labour man I feel a strong disposition to plump for John Thomas Annear, as being the only man about whom there can be no mistake. The Labour candidates simply haven't the ghost of a show. What gets over ue is this, that the only candidate who is *' eoine for' Mr. Stafford is tho only ono who has no ocoasion to fear him, and that is J.T.A. Mr. Bar tholomew's seat is clearly threatened by Mr. Stafford, yet he has nothing to say against the intruder, and does not utter ia word to discredit his candidature. He leaves all the fighting to Jack. Again, it is Mr. Stafford who has utterly spoilt the chances . of the two Labour candidates. They haven't a hope of succcbs witb Mr. Stafford in the field, and yet their attitude towards him is even more dooile than Mr. Bartholomew's. What does it all mean ? Is there an underground understanding be tween Stafford and Bartholomew, or is it Stafford and M'Ghie, or what is it anyhow ? Mr. Stafford seeraB to have them all by tho wool, except J.T.A., and if tho fog doesn't clear before Saturday Jack solus is the man for ine, and no complications. — Yours. &c.;, Labour-in-a-Fix.
