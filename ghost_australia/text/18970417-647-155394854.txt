THE RESURRECTION. That Christ lived, loved, taught, and died is doubted by few, if any, who are ac quainted with the words and works attributed to Him. But that, having died, He rose from the dead is denied by many and questioned by more. Yet His character cannot be explained except upon the assumption that He rose. He declared that He would do so : a failure would impeach His knowledge, truthfulness, or sanity. His promises are credible only because He is divine and supernatural ; but if he tran scended nature He could triumph over death. Had He not risen the disciples would have been without any ground for confi dence, and must in bitterness of spirit have counted themselves among the credulous and deceived ; their perplexity and conduct in the brief interval between His death and resurrection showed how perilously near they came to a renunciation of their faith, which would certainly have followed had the delay been protracted. But wondrous waB the change in their behaviour at the very time when they would have fallen, to rise no more ! Their trium phant utterance, ' CHRIST IS RISEN ! ' shook the world, andjit vibrates to this day. New voices raise it in every land, and hearts renewed testify that Christ is formed within them ' the hope of glory.' The forgiveness of sins, the communion of saints, the hope of everlasting life, the gift of the Holy Ghost, all rest on the re surrection of Christ. Withdraw that, and the soul of Christianity would take fight, leaving the Church like a dead body, soon to moulder into dust. Not a prayer could be -offered in His name, nor a promise trusted, nor a triumph over death expected. Hence, let every Christian joyfully exclaim : ' He lived for me. He died for me. He rose for me. He has gone to prepare a place for me. He iB preparing me for that place. He will come a second time without a ain offering unto salvation 1 '
