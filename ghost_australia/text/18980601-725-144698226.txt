SOW L1QB.T, TBAYJSLB. Light, bb a traveller, in point of rapidity is only thralled by eleotriclty, its speed being so vast that it is only when we have to ded : with the enormous distance stretching be tween us and our snn, and the far greater ones between our system and the myriad] others whioh dot our skies with the fixed stars, that snmvjitaMn viamaA. a! n-a come in play. A ray of Ught sent to us from' j our sue, for instance, traverses the inter-* venisg space of some 9g, 000, 000 milea in i about eight minutes — that is, at the rata of or6r 180,000 miles per second, bo that about one-eighth of a single second will suffice to' flash a sunbeam right round the world if a 1 serieB of mirrors oonld be arranged to reflect it from point to point on its surface. This , enormons speed appears still more wonderful j when we consider that light, makes its wayj through spaoe by means of waves, 60 that ' the ray, by pursuing a wavy line instead of a perfectly straight one, really travels much ? farther, and has besides io perform an in- J flnity of work in generaUng these inveepr' vibrations , as it proceeds. Thtt^ waves ant also marvellous in their minnteneet*n4 their; varied oharaoter, since the white ty™ of light which atzikesonr eye in the smkbeam U made up by a whole host of wave* of dif ferent -Ungths, eaoh length 1*y itself having a different colour, though the blend of the Vholei^ white, Hence, if we pass the ray of light through Apieoo of glass ont with tiuee sides, and known as a prism, wo get an artificial bow, owing to glass so cqt having.'the sih gular property of sorting ont the .different jdnds -n waves as thoy ^tss through it and morging graduelly, Uiroogh -orange, yelloir. green, and Una, into dark violet at die other, - hEryond which visible limit otlier waves %naka their presenoe felt ie heat, Whiih ie put and ! pirbel pf the ray.
