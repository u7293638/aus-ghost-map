t^S^^'is^'}1 A TALE OF LOVE' AND ADVENT UKE. _.. ^BiHECTOR A. STUAET. ' (COKTIITOSD.) So far aa we could understand from tlie Lascar, the settlement, was situate about a league from the coast, in an almost meridian lino ;rwith. the wreck of the Indiaman, ! stranded in a small cove, sheltered from ihe1 break-of -the sea. and where she still laid in i a very good stale of preservation. Oar first Btep Was to find the wreck. With this de sign 'We followed the windings of the coast, and as the bcacli was composed of sand, and the tide on the '-ebb, we found it more agree able ^ralking than along the edge of the eliffsprcoyered with' brambles and briars, through which we had at timea to really hew ouv way; '» We had' not traversed more than a mile when we discovered the object of our search' lying biiged upon the shore, with her fore and -main masts still tsrect. The -remains showed .^fche; vessel. to -have been of . immense size. -/;)l3h/& jcarried ten large jgiin8,:on.-the. ? maine. deck and- two bronze pieces on the forecastle and. after - deck. To . n-an this shipuiit required upward of «ne hundred menjbesides officers, who were as numer ous &S; those .on a. man-of-war of the same weight in metaJ. ., Her frame was built or teak^ne x-f the hardest and most endur- 1 ing woods which the forests of India pro duced and the manner in which it was put together evinced- n? thorough knowledge among those employed 'in her construction with *he best received rales of naval archi tecture. As we looked upon the wreck we coukjt not forfeear being sad. for it was. melancholy -to think so fine a vessel should leave her bones on this dismal island. Having found the wreck, our next step was to strike into the -country, and following a south-east direction, endeavor to search out the Lascar 'settlement. We accordingly fol lowed this course, but made slow progress, owing to the rough character of the road and ,jthe closeness of the forest through, which* we were compelled to pass. The weatjier, however^- remained serene, and as a thuii mist overhung the sun we did not suffer much from the heat. In spite of all, however, we kept on, hardly knowing whether the course we were pursuing would lead ins to our destination or to some less' in teresting but haply more dangerous place. Toward meridian we ? called a - halt, and camped by the side of a spring that oozed out of a bank cut by nature in the form of a great bastion, and on the top of which a group of stunted trees stood in melancholy solitpfle. Rising in an abrupt mariner, we perceived on the eastern hand a chain of hills^hich -appeared to ring a small valley. These hills_ seemed almost inaccessibler save at one point, where, after a carefulex amination, our glasses disclosed a very minute opening, which, from the inclination of the heights, bad ibe appearance of a defile eom miimcating with the valley. This, our men were persuaded, was the entrance or defile, of which the Lascar had spoken. However, being ^exceedingly fatigued, and tr wide ex panse -of rugged -sountry*to traverse before we could reach the mouth 'of the pass, we deemed it best to remain at rest for the balance of the day. ' We therefore made ourselves snug, and being now, to use a military expression, in the enemy's conntry, took Vvery precaution against a. surprise. The camp Tras fortified as well as circum stances would admit, our arms looked to and re-primied, while none vere allowed to ramble more than a furlong from their quarters- Guards were also posted and pickets thrown out, after the manner of. armie's, to raise the alarm should a foe ap pear/- . . In this position we passed the afternoon.1 About sandowo, themaster, while sweeping with his perspective glass the chain of hills bevcugl us,, saw .what he supposed a great suake winding down a gully. A closer ex amination, however, revealed a tronpe of men; hut w~h~cf they. weret whether white or back, or '-whence they came; were questions none of ns could answer. Some of the men said they were: Lasc&sjenterinff; the valley as.a reinforce ment to their comrades at the habitation, while' others vowed they were Nat J£elson and 'his foBoVers,' *who, 'eTcher Through ignorance or intention, were marching upon the tasear '. settlement. This last suppo sition .seemed hardly correct, since .Nat Kelson- took fcwa^ with him not more than thirty men, and tbese must at least save numbered nfty. However, it -was all con jecture, for ihe strangers were so -remote we could 'learn' 'nothing even' from birr1 8trorigBst^l|BfBS,;j '$%?* fffigPkfr; JMscoTieir/j whilft-^ it' ?

When I arrived »t the post I found the boatswain, 'Nick Trollie, standing near a large rock which crowned the peak of the hummock, and leaning on his Irelock in a pensive manner. I went up. to him and said : ..... '?' ''. ,.' ' '. .';?'' '_ V 'How nowf Nick £' .. .' ? ] ? * Never better in health;' was the response, ' though , somewhat ;melanchdly. I am not over superstitions, . but -looking down yon valley about a minute ago I eawhim, sir.' ? Who ?? I asked^ becoming Interested, as the boatswain's: condition in a manner tallied with toy own. * A ghost, Nick ?' ? Ay, sir,' replied the boatewain, with the utmost gravity. ; ' - ' Black Jack,' whom Tom Spokes murdered. I saw him cross the stream and go up the hill, until he was lost in the trees yonder. It was 'Black Jack,' I am certain. He m&b; dressed in white,. and wlien he got near the clump of trees he whistled.' My blood ran cold/ ' Indeed I* tried I, smiling at the man's credulity, * what/became of Jack ?' * He was lost, Bir ; at least I saw nQthing more or him. 1 feel sad, knowing his ap pearance is the forerunner of some cal amity.' I laughed, 'Hush!' exclaimed the; boatswain, in a whistoer ; fall Bacfc, suf, and look darerully I at the top shadow of .that, grove of trees, and see .if there is not a movement visible.1 I looked, and sure enough there ap peared cast upon the Surface- of a flat stone the shadbw of a human figure, attired in loose clothes, siich as the Lascars are wont to wear. While gazing at the apparition it moved, and after a bit seemed to sink among the branches, «o we saw it no more, though our eyes were fixed upon the shadow as it lengthened along the hill,i;he moon declining almost immediately beyond the grove. Ov course, we both were mightily astonished^, though the boatswain would have it thre shadow came ?from the ghost of 'Black Jack,' and not from a Lascar, j§s was my ideai However,- what diverse opinions i.ve might hold as to its ifiiere essence, -we w*jre persuaded the 'shade was thrown from, an eneijay, and therefore it behoved us to alarm our fellows, for there was no telling what might transpire. I was just tur/iing to leave when one of the two sailors,' who, with the boatswain, held; the post, Bai/i in a whimper; ?'..... / ' Has anyone gone beyond the lines ?' 'Not that I -know of,' replied th6 boats wain; f why, Dave P' ' ' * Because,' returned the sailor, /* I see a man looking over a rock at the fc^ot of the hiU.' : -'Ah,' exclaimed -the boatswa/in, 'what like is he?' -? . ' 'A dark man dressed in blifck, holding in his hand something' that Looks, like a musket.' ... ,' 'A Lascar, by Jove !' crie/'l the boats wain, levelling his night-gtyiss upon the figure ; 'is your firelock read*/, Dave ?' * At my shonlder,' answered the seaman. ?Then fire!' . .' The sailor's finger pressed the trigger, a report followed, a -cry of pain rose upon the air as the corpse of a man rolled from the rock and fell with a splash intjo the stream at the foot . of the hifl.' At . the tame moment a yell issued from the grove opposite, which seemed alive with dark figures. Soon after a volley of musketry came from the same direction. By mere lueir we escaped un touchedj tifeugh the shotfc ranged all round ns, and rattled on the rocks like, a skem of hail. We at once replied with our mus kets, and then fell back upon the main body of our men, who, roused by the uproar, came rushing to pur assistance.- Being; noir reinforced we halted and got in a volley, which, judged from the cries that followed, must have been effective. -But this ; noise, was nothing in comparison. to what fo/Jo wed when the enemy issued from their covert and begun the battle on ^eopea fielS. The country here was siot close enongh tc- make ambuscades of much avail; these we re very few trees, and the rocks scattered b.erearid there were so small as to afford bat little sneiter. However, the conflict be^an, and from, the prefaVe f'fo' the finis was msiintained vVSi great ^lirit, and marked by 'instances of decided heroism;. '.'
