MY-LITTLE FORGERY- CA SE~-\ j ."?=<.? ..-. «Air ihr»» y»an desperately bard fight tog Kt tba bar I had pushed my way into ? lmall bat raliabl» practice ; I wai makinf £360 a year, and could look forward witt sonfjdance to greater things,, and so felt ju« tifia^ in asking Ellen to marry me) Of couru we couldn't do very much on such an. in .omi, but Ellen wai a wonderful manager, and ¡although we bad to liv» in a decidedly smaU^ way I can confidently assart thal thar« were no happier people than wa in thi who]«, world. For about three months oui married life wai a perfeot dream of joy ; wi wara entirely f devoted to, .' each , other, - and Ellen had a great beliif in my pewits bl making a carear in my profusion. - Ai ? Blatter of fact I shared this belief to a larga .xUnt. I Bometimea could not help think ing that this abiolute happinasi was. too goodj to Int, and fairly trembled ' lest any thing ihould spring ap to mar it in ivan the aUghUitdegree. Ons morning, on coming down to break fast rather late, I found Ellen standing a« th* ¡window with her baek toward« me, reading, a,letter, and evidently abiorbed ia its oontsnta. ( '* Who ii your love-latter from, little; woman ?" I" asked *; smilingly.- Shs turnad round with a »tart, and I notioed how ghaatly pala aha teemed. ' While I looked sha fluihed orimion, replying in a nervous voice)."'Oh', from, no one you know, dear an old sohool .friend,'-'/ at. the sims tim« thrusting the letter into her pocket. ,.. Tba envelope wai lying on the tabla; and I notioed*that it wai in a maiouline hand writing of a most eharaolariitio and unusual .tyle.-j Ellen sat down without saying any thing'further, and poured out my coffee; I noticed how her hand trembled (shs'ipilt half the milk on the doth), and asked her, " Whatjs,tbai matter? You leem quite up set about ?ornething-" . ".Thara1! nothing wrong^with.mê,' Arthur,',only I ! ami» little il I .*iroa.w'"i< ot" long walk yesterday." I was ' surpriied'and really hurt at har answer. Ton sea, from the very commencement ol our engagement wa had mutually vowed to keep no secrets from aaoh other, and up to this moment I really believed wa had ihared our every thought. U; i Now her» was something which was clearly of luffioient importance to upiet Ellen lo a quite unusual extent, and when I inquired about the eauia aha was not only uncommunicative but actually evasive. .1 laid nothing further, but let her sea plainly ,., by roy manner that I wai hurt by her non tu confidence.. I have often thought linea that i wai entirely to blame (or all the wretohed *x bueineis' which happened afterwards; I \- ought to hava ahown mora oomplete confi dence in my dear wife, and Heaven knows that up to that moment, and indeed even t, then, ehe really had my entire and porfeot _ truit-only I was such a fool as to exhibit . my pique to her, and, having done io, of sourie felt bound to cherish it, lest sha ^'should think me ". weak." . For the next few days sha seemed really ''wretched, and would often look at me in an c imploring, pitiful manner whioh at another ' time would have mada me oatobi her to my haart. But just now, from ona causa and. another (the brief« were not coming in as tqu'iokly 'as I had 'expected), I was out ot . aorta, and mada my luspioiona an exouss for a small exhibition of spirit on my part. By the end of th« weak, however, I felt in bet ter humour with thinga, and determined to and tba trifling «étrangement. Those line« . oaiue into my head " Tb« little rift within the lute, \- That by-and-by «hall make tba music mute." . And Holt that it really wouldn't do to play with fire in ever BO small a way. So I got .áawayVfrom work an hour earlier than my usual time, and-hurried home delighted with the thought that I would quite " make it up." I knew'Ellen wouldn't be expeotlng me at that hour'of the afternoon, io determined tc give her. a surprise. 'I let myself in. with my^atónkéy(.and stopped softly upstairs to', thevdrawing-Toom, openod. the door quickly and saw-well, this is oxactly what I saw. Ellan'was leaning with bowed, head against the mantelpiece,' and stooping over her with one'háñd on her shoulder was a stranger, tall and strikingly handsome,^ though with a . worn, dissipated look about tba eyes which1 somewhat' spoilt . him.

About a month after our domestic shipwreok, I piokad up a not* from th* floor in th* dining-room, ¿nd noticed th* sam* hand-writing as that j of th» mysterious letter which had produced our.first difference. In a moment I had 'grasped its oontents. j ^ -'For Heaven's talc* don't rom* his sus picions. It would ba fatal.

SO this was" th* end of it all. The culminating proof' lay in my hand. Th* first part of tb* letter was olear enough. It suited th* scoun drel's purpoB* that I should be kept in th» dark aa long as possible. But for a mittut* or two 1 could not understand-the maanjngi of th* latter part of th* letter-" Ut* any means to prevent him trom taking up th* oas*." What oas* ? , Then it flashed aeross me. Only a few days before I bud been: en-, trusted by a well-known firm of lawyers with the prosecuting brief in a forgery eas*. It wa» th* first oa»» I hid .r*o»iv»d. (rom* Masar». Bracebridge <St Haokle.'and it meant a good deal to me, as I had felt iure that if I mada a success in it I should tartary in ' orease roy praotio* by their agency. It hsd come a* a mournful sort of pleasure' to me as I thought of what my joy would har* been in the old days, when such a htroke of, good fortuna would have been doubly'.plés sant from the happiness it Would ' hay* given Ellen; and now I suddenly remem bered that th* aroused was a man named Hammersley. Th* coincidence 'had not struck me before as I glanced .'casually through my brief, but I understood now ; though still I could not sea why' the man should so dread my appearing against bim. It could not be that he feared my powers as : prosecuting counsel-that was too absurd ; I was a comparatively unknown junior.1 Pro bably, then, it meant that he had som* spark of shame and remorse in him which made him dread to meet th* mau he had wronged in auoh a situation. Now all the old hal* and passion which had been almost dormant for a while ros* in me with tenfold fora*. I. gloated .over th* opportunity thus afforded me of* being in strumental in punishing in some degree th* wretch who had ruined my life. "Give up the ousel" Bather.give up heaven itself. I, would strain every nerve and power to ' s'* oure his oonviotion, and having don* BO, I would leave Ellen for ever. At dinner Hist . night J mentioned oasually that I,had been ; fortunate enough to be retained for. the pro secution in a rather big forgery case.;;.Sile started, anil eagerly asked for particulars.
