THE MUNICIPAL RACE. Totiie Editor of the Tasmanian Times. Sm,â€”According to the tenor of "Ratepayer's" letter in your issue of yesterday we are led to believe that the run for third place lies between Crisp and Pike in the above race. The writer is veiy loud in his praise of Pike and states positively that he will be the winning horse. Now what are the relative qualities of the two nags and what have they to recommend them to our confidence Crisp's pedigree is well known to us all; he is from good stock, and has been known to us all from the time he was a colt, he has always ran well and honestly, he is a rare sticker and under any circuinstanccs is sure to save his distance ; his previous performances have greatly inspired confidence in him for the future. I cannot say anything'of Pike's pedigree oi public performances, andmust leave the citizens to form their own opinions as to what he is likely to do in future. It is said by good judges that he will not stand the ghost of a chance with tbe tried old horse who thoroughly knows his work and the ground which he has to travel over; at the same time it must not be forgottenjthat "Ratepayer" who no doubt is a good judge of the animal, places great reliance on Pike's new blood. Crisp's supporters are earnestly requested to meet at the Town Hall this morning and back their opinions. I for one will bet on Crisp and recommend others to do likewise. Tours &c.;, NIMROD.
