THE ROUNDABOUT RAILWAY. I CANNOT conceal from myself that one of the most prominent facts of my everyday life is the Round about Railway. Every seven minutes and a-half of mv waking existence, that wonderful institution asserts itself so clamorously, that I am in no danger of forgetting it; and though I have long ceased to consider it a nuisance, as I once did-for habit re- concile us to everything-I have not yet arrived at the happy condition of the Yankee waiters at the niagara Hotel, who, deal, through custom, to the roaring of the waters, can hear 3 pin drop on the floor, in spite of their everlasting thunder ; so I hear each recurring train as it rushes through its deep ditch of a cutting at some fifty paces from my fireside, and can time my movements by them, if I like without looking at my watch. I quarrelled savagely with the Roundabout Railway at its first intrusion some years ago, and grumbled at it and its projectors like a Briton, as I have a right to do ; then I began to tolerate it-then to make a convenience of it-and at last to like it. In the course of the last seven years or so, I have taken all manner of advantages of the Roundabout Railway, and now I mean to turn it to account once more by getting an article out of it. The Roundabout Railway is the pet of the London- ers, being patronised by them to a much greater extent than any of our iron roads and it owes its popularity to its excellent character for punctuality and safety, as well as for some other special qualities and conveniences which will make themselves evident as we proceed. It abounds in stations and termini, in London and out of London, and at all points of the compass. People walk on to it from a level ; they climb up to it by endless flights of stairs ; they get down to it through long galleries and shafts and staircases combined; and they burrow under- ground to get at it, and emerge upon its platforms through trap-doors; like the ghost of Hamlet at Sadler's Wells. Then, while it is the most cosmopolitan of all roads, doing hourly business with all imagin- able grades of society, and travelling to and from all points of the compass at once, it is at the same time the most intrusive and impertinently familiar of all the railways reckoned up in Bradshaw. It is positively shocking to see the liberties it takes, and the rude manner in which it mixes itself up with the private and domestic concerns of us modern Babylonians Starting from the very centre of the old city, upon a level with the tiles and chimney-pots, it cuts and carves its way among the dwellings in the most remorseless manner. Here it knocks off a roof, a stack of chimneys, and an outhouse or two ; there it shares away a gable end and anon it puts Mr. Perkins' dormitory into halves, leaving only a moiety for that gentleman's truckle bed and wardrobe. The effect of its coming to such close quarters among the lieges is a very various kind of revelation to the men of observation who travel by it-a sort of obligatory introspection into the streets sanctorum of numberless domestic temples, whose mysteries, but for its impertinence, had been sealed for ever from the gaze of the curious. As one is whirled along the line, little interesting spectacles are presented to us seriatim in a species of endless living diorama. We see now the family washing getting up in the garret, where Mrs. Saddles and the two eldest Miss Saddles are rubbing away elbow deep in three several tubs, while a third damsel, in a state of picturesque dishabille, is expediting preparations for drying on the roof. Then it is police- man Z 25, snoring under the blankets, with the windows thrown up just to let in the steam from the engines, by way of a refresher, this close muggy morning, while his glazed hat is airing on the window-sill. Next it is a cobbler, seated at his left in his " parlour next to the sky," and hammering away at the sole of a blucher boot, while five little cobblers in future pause from pottering among the bristles and wax ends to gape open-mouthed upon the flying train-. Then there is the fat beadle of Waddlebrojk "Within, in that six feet state-berth of his, fussing about amidst his gold bands, his purple plush index- pressibles, his magnificent robe of office, all glittering with the precious metal, and his huge mountain of a cocked hat. He has about as much space in his garret as a terrier caught in a rat-trap, or a silkworm in its cocoon, and has to wriggle perspiringly to get himself into his finery. But for the rush of the train, you would hear the marriage morning bells pealing from Waddlebrook steeple. Mr. Beadle hears their loud banging all too plainly, and it is that he may be in time to meet the wedding faces at the church door, that he works so hard at shuffling on his mortal coil. Another moment, and there is Mrs. Maggs, the fish porter's wife, dishing up a smoking mass of something substantial for Magg's breakfast, who, having been walking up and down ladders in Billingsgate Market, with a couple of hundredweight or so on his head, ever since three o'clock this morning, wantS to fall to without a moment's delay. You see his cavernous jaws dilate at the instigation of the savoury fumes, but you see no more, for you whiz past-and To ! there lies poor Bolter, who is down in the ague, all solitary and forlorn, and tucked in among the physic bottles, to shiver himself well again as fast as he can, having nobody to console him the while, because Mrs. Bolter is obliged to be off scouring the streets with, the hand-cart of whelks, periwinkles, and stewed eels, in order to keep the pot boiling for the benefit of the little Bolters and her sick husband. Then comes the seamstress at work upon a fourpenny shirt, with her worn wan face close to the window ; or perhaps it is the sackmaker, earning a better wage at coarser work, and stitching away with her pack thread to make up her bundle for the wharf ; or, better still, it may be the shoebinder, working cheerily in expectation of the fair reward that sweetens toil. And lo ! there, on empty chamber with a bill up announcing a lodging to let-Lodgings-with a look-out against the black brickwork of the railway viaduct, exactly twenty seven and a half inches from your nose : who wouldn't be tempted with such a prospect. You note as you sweep along, that in a good proportion of the windows, spite of the smoke and the steam of the engines, the omnipresent soft and blacks and chimney blessings, there are flowers that elsewhere would be all a-growing and a-blowing, but here are withering and fading away, and that numerous dingy pots, empty and tenanted only by a dry twig, attest the persevering attempts of the" denizens of this dusty region to convert it into a garden. All these things, however, are but a vision of a few minutes, and then the scene rapidly changes. First there is a wider prospect ; the city with its domes and spires and towers spreads itself out to view, while in the other direction a forest of masts and yards mingles with the stacks of chimneys, and an unmistakeable odour of pitch and tar and mouldy cordage is borne upon the breeze. Then the train stops, and if you are bound to the river-side, you get out, and transfer yourself to another, in company with numbers of jolly young watermen, or ancient mariners, and whatso- ever things are of the brine, briny, all the way from Wapping to Woolwich. But not being bound to the river-side, you bid adieu to affairs marine, and skurry on in a direction in- clining to the northward, and ere long you have exchanged the urban and commercial for the suburban and rural. You rush over other railways, and under other railways, and across other railways ; London begins to retire on the left, and the broad level country open on the right and there glinting fitfully under you white cloud, if you are sharp enough to catch a glimpse of it, you may see the river Lea-old Izaak Walton's river Lea meandering its way through the meadows and marshes into the Thames; and perhaps you may remember that it was there that the pious old biographer of George Herbert and John Donne while he impaled his living, writing baits upon the barbed hook, handled them tenderly," dear good man, as a Christian should do, " because they are God's crea- tures." In a few moments more you are at Bow, where was the " sole " at which Chaucer's prioress learned her indifferent French, and which was famous for its cakes and cream in the days of bluff Harry the mony-wived. _ From this point you begin to range along the limits of the recreative region affected by Eastern London. Victoria Park stretches almost down to the railway embankment, and country ale- houses, taverns, and tea-gardens approach still nearer, taking, in fact, a position as close to the line as they are allowed to come. Thither resort the lieges from Shoreditch, Spitalfields, Bethnal Green, and Whitechapel and there you see them lounging at ease on summer evenings under clouds of tobacco smoke, or flying their pigeons, or labouring at _ skittles, or gymnasticising among the poles, swings, and cross-bars. And see down in yon paddock there is a tent pitched, with the union flag flying from the central pole, and long tiers of benches ranged on the left for the convenience of the sport- ing gentlemen who are inclined to venture a little J spare cash on that tall fellow in the azure vest and white pants, bound above the knees with a tricolour ribbon, who is stepping out so vigorously along the 1 beaten path fringing the boundaries of the paddock, that is the celebrated pedestrian, Slipper, who has pledged himself to do sixty. five measured miles a-day for twelve consecutive days of twelve hours each and is at this moment doing it. Slapped is a grand favourite with the connoisseurs of pedestrianism ; it was he who licked the famous teetotal champion down at Scranford Beggs, and walked him off his legs in nine days-an exploit which the teetotal chroniclers say nothing about. He is doing the present unrivalled I feat for a purse of a hundred guineas, as the placards have it- and we heartily wish he may get it-though who is to pay the money does not appear It is rather monotonous and weary work for the stalking professor, it has rained cats and dogs for six days out of the nuolhathehas already trudged it, and he cannot Black a single yard of the allotted measure in the fog of the time keepers who are there to register his daily doings His pi irons and backers drop in from time to time to see how he is getting on and as the decisive hour approaches, there will be a rush from all quarters to the scene of action, to witness the triumph of his defeat, and a grand explosion of pigeons front pockets and bags to carry the news to the sporting editors As a novel attraction to the walking phenomenon, another rural hostel announces a bout at single stick, on a fair stage every evening, open to all England and calls upon all the lovers of a broken head to come and enjoy that supreme luxury free gratis for no thing ; the only stipulation being, that you shall subscribe a sovereign in case of your winning the silver cup, which is honestly worth five and twenty sh 1 lings, but which, as the challenger is a n famous adept in his elegant sort, and has broken three hundred heads within the last three months, is not very probable event A third speculator gets up a wrestling match, also open to all England, under conditions somewhat similar, and a fourth, soaring a little higher, and with a view, no doubt, to family patronage, sports a balloon, which you may see from the railwovhtting its huge bald head among the trees, are swaying this way and that in the driving rain The train again pulls up at Hay knew station, and you look down upon the old church with its time worn tower and the quondam village, with its orchards and gardens and teeming population, now a vast suburb, and almost itself a city Here lived Pope's miner John Ward here were the mansions of the old nobles, Vero, Rich, and Brooke, here Matthew Henry preached and commented and here Smpe, the historian, lectured for more than thirty years, and here died-a nonagenarian Although we started from the city with our faces eastward we are journeying due west shortly after leaving Hackney, and are running in a straight-line for Merry Islington And here we can but remark how wonderfully the landholders opinions of the Round- about Railway have changed between the dates of its projection and completion We remember well when it was surveyed what monstrous prices they got for their slips of land, on the plea that the adjacent acres would thenceforth be good for little or nothing , and now they exact still more monstrous rents for said acres on building leases, on the ground of the railways proximity and convenience ' Everywhere, the toll rows of houses come down to the railway c nting , princely villas have their gardens abutting on it and it would seem that no ground rent, however exorbitant, will induce the builders to keep their distance We see little of the merriment of Islington, for we make a more like passage through it underground, or in gloomy cuttings, and only emerge into fair daylight on approaching the Caledonian Road, where we gradually pass from deep fosse to lofty viaduct, and thence look down from a giddy height upon the Great Northern line where it tunnels under the new Cattle Market, and starts on its career to York and beyond At this point, especially if it be market day, we are invaded by butchers, drovers, carcass men, and cattle dealers and agents and we psi'B whole droves of oxen and sheep stuck up in sidings and bound for the market pens On again, over house tops and warehouses, manufacturing yards, waste building ground, and pasture meadows, through Camden Town stop- ping there for a minute and then onward still to that interminable network of rails, the iron Champ de Mars which is the mance living ground of the North Western Here we finish our roundabout, having encompassed the major portion of the modern Babylon The Londoner s pet railway would hardly be so popular as it is if it did no more than is detailed above But it does far more does everything, in fact, for the locomotive citizen that a railway can do. It is not only the ever-ready highway to and from all the roundabout stations, but it is high road to Hampstead Heath, to Kew, to Richmond, to Hampton Court, to Windsor-to Stratford, to Tilbury and Gravesend, to Southend at the mouth of the Thames to Epping Forest, and to numberless other intervening or outlying places of popular resort, whose names would £11 a long column In consequence, it is notoriously the pleasure line for those classes whose holidays are brief and ephemeral, and who must perforce return to harness on the morrow It is, of course, during the summer and on sunny days that the holiday traffic is at the greatest It is then that the stations are crowded with noisy multitudes, and the carriages thronged to running t per while thousands after thousands are whirled off in all directions to the paradise they have severally selected - It happens occasionally that successive parties who have flown off to some favourite place of resort in batches during the day, seduced by the charms of the weather, by on extra good breast of an, or by their own fun and frolic, will all elect to return together by the lost train In this case it is not fortunate to be one of the number, the packing being somewhat terrible all classes are unavoidably burn died in together wherever they can be stowed forty are said to be squeezed into the room for ten, and we have heard the transit described by a sufferer as a species of black hole experience, endurable only from its brevity and the certainty of speedy release After all, the holiday affairs, large as they are, are but an exceptional feature in the Roundabout Rail way Its serious business is mainly commercial, with a mixture of the convenient It is more a capacious omnibus, open to any number of passengers, than anything else It travels to and from all the city stations at omnibus fares, and its principal patrons are those who conduct, control, or transact the business of London in some way or other Every morning, it runs express trains from its several termini, and at the hours when business commences at the Bank, at Mark lane, at Mincing lane, at the Exchange, and other ports, it pours in whole battalions of business men to do the world s work Again, in the afternoon, it runs expresses to carry them home to dinner and though it works with unerring regularity all day long up to eleven at night, carrying all London wherever it likes to go, it is only for the accommodation of the men of business that it comes to deviate from its jog trot pace As a rule, its trains do not travel fast-they cannot do so, owing to the shortness of the several Stages which does not allow of time for getting up steam to full speed It is mainly owing to this fact that it maintains so excellent a character for safety , we can hardly remember an accident of any consequence having occured upon it, and none that could be fairly laid to the charge of its own servants In the department of luggage, the Roundabout Railway is almost as formidable as in that of passengers The amount of goods hauled from the Docks to that last receiving ground on the North-Western is something almost fabulous Sometimes, in our evening walks, we hear from far the thunder of a goods train as it comes at express rate along the Hackney cutting Think of threescore luggage vans, chained on to a couple of mighty engines, and stretching over a quarter of a mile in length As it roars and pants, and bounds along, shaking the solid ground, we can compare it only to a travelling earth quake, and feel relieved when it is fairly out of sight and hearing In busy times, this luggage hauling goes on through the night, and we are startled and literally rocked in our bed by the lumbering masses as they shriek, and crash, and clatter past Of course the Roundabout Railway is a well paying concern , it is rumoured, indeed, that the dividends are first rate, but not being a shareholder, I can say nothing decisive on that head -Chambers
