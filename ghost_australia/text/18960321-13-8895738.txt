"If I can't come before them and brazen the matter out, I and I can't remain away for fear of confirm I tug what they already suspect, and I can't leave the monastery) without drawing clown suspicion on you, I must confess I don't see what is to be done. I suppose we couldn't bribe the man to withdraw his charge''" "Not to be thought of, a ntl Nikola, with conviction "Our lives would then be simply dependent on his reading of the word 'honest) ' You ought to know what sort of faith recorded place in that " " Could we not force him to clear out then, and thus let it be supposed that he had brought a false accusation against me and was afraid to stay and face the consequence s " "'Fruit is not possible either," said Nikola ' He would only begin to bargain with us, and to be revenged on us, turn traitor when we re lined his demand in that case it would be a case of pull devil pull bull r, and the one who could pull the longest would gain the day. No i You had better leave the situation to me and let me tackle it I did as he w shed, and for nearly half an hour could hear him pacing his room deep in thought. Throughout the time I did not intrude myself upon him or interrupt him in any) way). At the end of the suite stated he abandoned his sentry go and came in to me. "I see my way," he cried. "But when all is said and none it is almost as desperate as either of the other remedies we thought of you will have to carry it out, and it you are, well, Heaven have mercy upon both of us You have saved my life before, I am going to trust it to you now. But remember this, if you do not carry out my plan exactly as I wish you will never see me alive again Give me your best attention, and recollect ever) thing I say). It is now close on midnight, the gong for early) service will sound at half-past 5, but it will be da) light an hour before that I must get you out of this place within a quarter of an hour, by hook or crook, and even if you have to steal a horse to do it, you must be in Pekin before half-past 1. Once there, you will find the house of Yee Laojeh, which is situated in the street at the rear of Legation street, near the chief gate of the Tartar city." " But how am I going to get into the city at all * ' I asked, amazed that he should have forgotten what struck me as such a hopeless barrier-the wall. " The gates are closed at sundown, and not opened again till sun rise "You 11 have to climb the wall,' he answered But as you know very well, that's altogether impossible, I said Not a bit of it he replied "I will tell you of a place where it is quite practicable Do you remember the Bpotwheto you proposed to Miss Medwin' " Perfectly, I answered with a smile But how do you know it I ' "My dear fellow, I was within a hundred yards of you the whole time No I You need not look at me like that, I was not spying upon you I had my own reasons for being there, and you see how useful that chance visit has proved M eli, two bastions trots where you were stated that day, the stones are larger and more uneven than anywhere else along the whole of that side of the city To my certain knowledge three men have been in the habit of climbing that portion of the ramparts for the last three years, between midnight and sunrise, smuggling in goods to the city, in order to avoid paying the Office [duty) which as you know, is levied during daylight. When you have got over you will find a sentry posted on the other side, to him you will pay three taels, telling him at the same time that you intend returning in an hour and that you will pay him the same amount for the privilege of getting out Having passed the sentry you will proceed into the town, find You Lace etc and let him know the fix we are in You may promise him the sum of £100 cash down it he falls in with your suggestions, and you must bring him back with you, willy nilly, as fast as you can try el I will meet j 011 at the southern gate knock four times and as you knock rough that shall be the signal and as soon as I hear it I will open the gate All that must be guarded against inside this place shall be no care Everything outside must be yours Now let us come along and see how I can get you out together we left the room descends 1 the stairs and crossing the little ante chamber entered the big hall The wind came in through the narrow windows and rustled amid the long silk hangings till the place seemed to be people us with 11 thousand silk dal ghosts Nikola crossed it swiftly, and left by the southern door I followed close at his heels and together eve passed unobserved through the great court and, keeping well in the shadow of the building until he reached the first gate fortunately for us this also was unguarded but we could hear the men who was supposed to be watching to pluckily snoring in the room beside it I Slipping the enormous fur aside we opened it quietly passed through it and crossed a little open strip of green towards the outer I wall Just however as we were about to I turn the corner towards it a sudden sound of voices caused us to heart in this way wins) over Vil ola sii7tn.;my wrist and dragging me to the left "lean fingers another hut I notice 1 yesterday a big tree growing by the side of the wall I hung the great centre gate we turned to our left hind tins I have sail and followed the wall we desired to surmount until we arrived at a large tree whose branches more than overcome it.

Being anxious to obtain some news of him, my guide interrogated one of the players, who informed him that he had seen our man about an hour before He imagined he had then gone into the room we had first visited Wey returned there and made further in quires, only to elicit the fact that he had been seen to leave the house about half an hour before our arrival. " Hnv e no fear I will find him for a ou," said my companion, and we thereupon proceeded down the passage, past the door keeper, and into the street again Once more we took uptheehnsi, passing up one street and down another, to bring up eventually in an opium house a little behind the English Li gatton. The outer room, or that nearest the street, was filled with customers, but our man was not among them. The inner room was not quite so crowded, and there we found the man we wanted But there was this drawback he had smoked his usual number of post prandial pipes, and was fast asleep. It was now hard upon 2 o'clock, and at most I dared not remain in the city more than another hour. At the same time it would be a most foolish, if not a dangerous proceeding to attempt to travel with my man in his present condition. 11 he did nothing else, he would probably) fall down the wall and break his neck, and then I should either have to leave him or remain to answer inson lenient questions, but whatever happened I knew I must carry him out of this house us I quickly as possible, to some place where I could try to get him round a bit. I said as much to the man who had found him for me, and then, between us, we got him up, and i taking him by till tr and led him off to his home, By the time we got him there he had in a small measure recovered from the i effects of his smoke 'line we sit to work, using every means known to us to bring him round, and by half-past 2 had no far succeeded as to ward me me in thinking I might set off on our return journey) "But what do you want me for I asked lawyer, who was still a bit mystical, though fortunately not so far gone as to be an able to recognise the "ion view to come along with me,' I answered, taking good care that the other man was well out of hearing, "out to the LliuntiHerai, where Nikola wants you I will tell you the rest as we go.

Half an hour later the great gong sounded for morning worship, and in a few moments the courtyards and balls were literally alive with men. On Nikola's instructions I descended to the hall alone, and mixed with the throng I was not the only cripple amongst them, for there were dozens of others with their arms in slings Nor was the fact that I was a str tiger like it to attract any undue attention, inasmuch as there were mendicants and people of all sorts and descriptions passing into the berth directly the gates were opened at daylight I had not been in the hall vir) long before I saw Nikola enter and take up his place beattie the Chief Priest. When the service was at an end it was evident that something, unusual was going to take place, for the Monks and their guests remained where they were, instead of leaving the hall as usual.
