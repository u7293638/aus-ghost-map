After 'the heavy work' of last session, and more particularly during the latter two months, Mr. Colton feels the need of a rest to recoup his health and energy for next cession.

The Mayor presided, and stated that through tha reaJgnaiion of Councillor Grossman _ an extraordinary vacancy had occurred in Bowden Ward. Mr. C.'H. Beck, the only candidate present, addressed the meeting, and stated, that he was willing to place his services at ths disposal of the ratepayers. In reply to questions,' the candidate thought that persons uninsured requiring the ser vices of the proposed Fire Brigade should be compelled to pay something towards the expenses connected with the Brigade — (No) — also that a weighbridge should be erected by the Corporation. Mr. Beck would support the opening of the reserve in Drayton-atreet. Mr. Hocking con tended that the amount derived from rates could be better spent in making roa&3 and footpaths in the ward. {Hear, hear.) Mr. Beck would be in favour of calling for tenders for the offices under the Corporation, and also to make the offices of Town Clerk . and Surv eyor distinct, as he did not think i the present system of carrying out She public ? works wa3 satisfactory. (Hear, hear.) ' A 1 ratepayer asked if the Council would favour I the eight-hours system for their employe's. ?The Mayor failed to see how the work that waa required to be done in the several wards could be carried out under ';the eight-hours system without an addi tional expenditure being incurred by ?the Council. The candidate would favour a system of payment by time, and would be I in favour of calling for tenders for daywork :in each ward. (Hear, hear.) The appli j cation to the Government for an OYervray jbridgein lieu of the present level crossing !over the Port Sallway line in Gibson-street should have his support, although he did not think, with the facilities at present available for foot traffic, that their application would be successful. Mr. Beck refuted a statement made that little or nothing had been done towards making the roads and footpaths in the ward. A number of other questions were replied to. A proposition in favour of Mr. Beck was carried. A vote of thanks was accorded to the Mayor for presiding. About seventy persona were present. Eotind Deowi'ed. — On Sunday morning a little after 9 o'clock a Mr. Kirby living at Glenelg, whib walking along the shore at Henly Beachj saw a naked body floating in the water. With' some assistance it was landed, and identified as that of Yoigt, a watchmaker, who, a few minutes earlier, had been seen walking about. On searching the beach in the vicinity ths clothes of the man was also found. Deceased, who was a single man about 85 years of age, arrived in the colony from Germany about two years ago, and for 'i;orne time had been engaged at Mr. KrahenbtiliFsj in King William-street. Daring the last fsw months several valuable watches have been entrusted to him to repair ; but Mr. G. Kindermann, one of the gentlemen^who had employed Yoigt, found that his watch had been pawned, saw de ceased, and charged him with the offence. Yoigt admitted the charge, and restored the watch. Mr. Kindermann then informed several ether of Voigt's customers, and the result waa that on January 2 instructions were given to the police by no Ies3 than fifteen persona who had been victimized to issue a warrant for the apprehension of Yoigt for larceny £3 a bailee. Thess proceedings became known to Yoigt, and lie waa not seen in the city until Sunday morning. That day, about 6 o'clock, he called at tas houss where hs had lodged, and was told by a ATr. Socco that there was a warrant oat for him. Deceased said ha was aware of -the fact, and had] been 'planted:- in the hills near the Waterfall Gully for two or three days. A few minutes later. he left his friend and waa next seen walking on the seashore at Henley Beach a few minutes before his bedy waa discovered. An inquest will bo held II113 afternoon at the Destitute Asylum, the body having been removed to the City Morgue. The police have recovered twelve out of the fifteen watches entrusted toldeceaasd. Lccal Option. — In accordance with a petition presented to the Hindmarsh Corpo ration a poll took place on Saturday, January 3 in Sowdea r.nd Brompton Wards to decide whether i_.e eight public-houses in those wards should remain, closed or otherwise 'during tha present year. The general feeling expressed waa that the reault would ba in favour of the houses being reopened on Sundays. The Mayor (Dr. Eees, J.P.) acted a3 Ra turn- ing Officer. Councillor Medwell acted as Deputy at the Boiling-booth in Brcmpton Ward, and the Town Clerk (Mr. Tait) filled the like position in Bowdan Ward.

Grass Fire at Magill.— A fire 'broke out , at about half-past 12 on Sunday afternoon, January 4, on the property of Mr. Offen&ale; at Magill. Several neighbours turned ; out : and beat back the flamea, but despite their efforts in a few minutes the fire spread into : the grounds cf tha Orphanage, where it was extinguished. Altogether in Ies3 than, half an hour about forty or fifty acres of good grass were burnt. Nothing is at present known as to the origin cf the fire. Congest at ths Cbtjsadebs1 Hail,— Another of a series of free concerts was given in the CniEadera' Hall 'on Saturday 'evening, January 3. The Bev. A. Tumbnll presided, . and tha hall waa crowded. The- Chairman observed that the audience were -not likely to ? be annoyed, as they had been on ths previous Saturday, by young men who 'came for the : purpo3e of causing 'disturbance. Of late there had been a succession of disagreeable in cidents of the kind, and he had resolved to refuse entrance to any of the persona he had referred to. It had been intimated to him that they were sent there for the purpose. On the previous evening, during the Holiness Meeting,3$he Ecene- ont3ide the hall under the eye3 of the police waa very disgraceful. .He waa sorry that he had in any way to censure the police for not doing their duty, and ha hoped no cause would be given for complaint in future. The entertainment opened with an overture by ths band, after which a young lady Eang ' Come birdie, come.' .Mr. Symon recited ' Young Lochinvar,' and Mr. Shaw gave a long poem of his own entitled 'The Bush Fire.' Mr. Myres' contributed Wo eoIos. Another gentleman, recited 'Mary's Ghost,' and a few songs followed in addition to a solo on the cornet and selections by the band. Mr. TurnbuU remarked that more than half the persons who had promised to help that evening had sent at the last moment to say that they could not come. Steaxgs Death rs a Miss. — On Saturday, December 27, the remains of a man were discovered in the bottom of a shaft at the Outward Bound Mine, Thacka ringa, by Mr. Penglase. Death had evidently occurred some time ago, and the deceased was devoid of every ve3tige of clothing, and could not be identified. Warden Brown and Police-constable Connor were called to the spot, and the body was buried without delay. Thera was no signs of violence so far as could be seen. No one in the neighbour hood seems to know anything of such a man, and how he came to be at the bottom of the shaft, and how3 above all, he was in a nude condition, will probably ever remain & mys tery. Usttaeian Service.— -On Sunday morn ing, -J anuary 4, at the ' Unitarian Church, Wakefield-street, the Kev. J. C. Woods, B. A., discoursed on ' Lessons of the Past ; Hope3 for the Future.' Treating his subject mainly from a religious standpoint, the rev. gentle man briefly alluded to the more prominent events and personages in the history of Christianity, and expressed the opinion that a mere study of the dominant theology would not suffice to enable U3 to understand the true feelings and religious condition of in dividuals or of a people at any particular period. Even when theologians taught that the majority of mankind were doomed to eternal misery we did not find the heart's vivacity entirely quenched and all happiness banished from life, though, of course, there were some upon whose minds the doctrines of Calvinism, worked with terrible effect. With such exceptions as these, the hearts of all devout persons had been stayed' and. comforted in times of bereavement and trouble by a faith in God which triumphed over all logical deductions from accepted dogmas. The principles, aspirations, and hope3 of the Christian religion had been the same whatever the theological clothing with which they'; had been encumbered. A study of the progress of religion hitherto woul«3 suggest to a thoughtful mind- many lessons, and it also warranted hope for the future. The tendency nowadays was towards a more general emphasis upon the practical bearing of religion upon daily life, a more hearty recognition of the principles ard beliefs which Christians cherish in common, and a disposition to avoid making mere difference of opinion a ground cf offence. In concluding his remarks, Mr. Woods urged the importance of the young being impressed ? with a sense of the responsibility which rested upon them as to the immediate future, and expressed the hope that when they in their turn had to give place to others it might be their happiness to feel that they had at any rate endeavoured to do what they could for their day and generation. Shall Fibe in ths City.— At about 2 o'clock on Sunday morning a small fire broke out in agalvanized-iron shed, the property of Henry Hodgkinson, a storekeeper living in Stoir street, off Grote-stfeet ' west. Some '. chaff which was stored in the shed was burnt, It was not insured, and was valued at £10. The fire wa3 put out by the police before the arrival of the reels. A man named John McCulloch, a servant of Hodgkisson, was found asleep in the yard just outside the chafFhotise. The City Coroner made enquiries on Sunday afternoon, and decided not to hold an inquest, aa it was evident that McCulloch had accidentally set Sre to the place while in toxicated. Scientific Exploration ix New Guinea. — It appears from the Anglo-New Zealander and Australian Times that Mr. H. 0. Forbes, F.R.G.S., is organizing a scientiSc expedition with the view of exploring the botany and zoology of the Mount Owen Stanley Moun tains, the great central range of the- eastern peninsula of New Guinea, . Mr, Forbes has been allowed £400 by the British Association and £250 by the Royal Geographical Society towards the expense of the expedition. The party will start early in December, though it is not expected to get into active working before May nest, in consequence of the neces sity for procuring trusty carriers from the Moluccas. Mr. Forbes will break his jour ney at -Batsvia, in' order to- proceed to Amboyna, where hs hop S3 to find his men. He will theR return to Batavia, and. sail for Thursday Island, proceeding thence to Port Moresby. Hs proposes to ascend the course of one of the -rivers which, flow from the mountains to Eedscar Bay. .. Should 'the natives prove friendly and the- food supplies sufficient, Sir. Forbes 'doss' not despair of' reaching the other ccaat. of the peninsula.; but in. any .case ths exploration of the 'Mount' Owen Stanley raags would be of itself asatiB factory achievement. -The mountain travel ling is declared'to be dangerous to'.' any but very experienced travellers. ? - '.?;:?; : Loss of the Watss Supply op Madbas,— We regret to have to announce} says. the Madras Mail of November 25) that 'the northern end of the Red Hilla : Tank— the reservoir of the partable water of the City of ?Madras — waa breached yesterday, and: that. the whole of the water collected 'since 'the ? beginning of this monsoon; has 'effected its escape into the sea - by and around the .wsste ?channels to the north of the town.' Definite news of the - - breaching ?? ' of the' ? tank reached ths municipality last .night, ' and ?was communicated at, once- to the Collector of Chinglep'ut. ' Early this . morning, after a- consultation with tile-: Vice-President, Mr. Arundel left 'for the '?

For' about a mile and a half on' thi3 side Tulukanchuttram the road is under water, and a strong stream, two and three feet deep is still running over; it in many 'places. Hear Tulukanchuttram Mr. Arandel's horsa got into - a deep'1 hole, and rolled over, and Mr. Arandel had to take to wading, while the horaa went for a swim in the flood, but he was shortly after recaptured. About 200 houses and huts have gone in Tnlnkaschuttrain. Ths small village of about- a hundred housss on 'ths Madras side of the tollgate is absolutely wiped out, and not a ves'tige remains of it but the level foundations of ths houses. Sixpeople were carried ? away, bufc the rest ? made good their escape. A - man,, woman, and child were on the -bund- when is gave way in front and behind them ; but the fragment they were on stood firm, and they were xescued after twenty- '? four hours' exposure.

The evening before the storm the water was. below high-water level, and sis feet below the top of the bund, while there was a parapet, wall three feet high [besides. The cyclone drove the water clean over this nice feet of perpendicular height, and the top and back of the bund were torn away till the 'whole collapsed. The Supervisor D.P.

Victoeian Public : Seevics Regula tioks. — The first series of regulations under the Public Service Act 18S3, apDroved of by the Governor in Council on December 31, have been issued? (says the Argus J. To a great extent, the regulations are similar to those previously existing, but a few impor tant .alterations have' been made. '.The hours of attendance are extended to half past 4 o'clock p.m., except on Saturdays, when they will remain aa heretofore, -Half an hour is in future to be allowed for luncheon. Hitherto there has been no well: defined rule on that subject, It may here be. stated that' the rumour which haa 'been circulated that the Public Service Beard were in favour of extending the hours of attendance to 5 o'clock 1b incorrect. When the head of a department finda he has too many officers, he is to report the circum stance to. the Board. When, in the opinion of the Board, a department re quires temporary assistance, the Board 'will certify that fact to the' Governor in Council, who will appoint the - person whose name stands first on a register to be kept of _2t and proper persona who are' applicants for ap pointments ; but no such persons are to to be appointed for more than three months. Regulations as to teachers of singing and of drawing are also published. The Public Ser Act is now in force. A Cyclone at Madeas.— Madras (say3 the Madras Times of ; November 22) has : just passed through a cyclone. On Tnursday, after midnight, it commenced to blow furiously, the wind being accompanied by rain ; and^by the morning it blew a regular hurricane, which uprooted several trees and shrubberies, dismantled wooden structures, and tore into pieces several thatched sheds, The vessels riding in the roads at the time were the steamer Clan Grant, the sailing ships Medusa, Dominion, and Laurel. At 3.30 a.m. the Clan Grant appeared to be in distress, owing, it is believed, to her stern moorings having parted. The morning waa pitch dark, and she showed four bluelights. She hung, on up to daylight and then cleared out. At about 6.30 the Medusa drifted from her berth on the south of the harbour towards the Sailors' Home on the north, and much apprehension was felt regarded her safety. Having been supplied with a fresh cable she anchored safely near the third surf. The Dominion also drifted towards the northern arm of the harbour. Captain T. E. Marshall, the Deputy Master Attendant, arrived at his office at 3 a.m., ind at once placed himself in communi cation with Mr. .Norman Pogson, the Govern ment Astronomer, and that officer telegraphed to him saying that there was every likelihood of a blow. Between the hours of 7 and 9 a.m. it blew a cyclone. The signal guns having been fired from the fort* the South Wales Borderers,' a wing of the 25th Regiment Native Infantry, stationed at Washerman pettah, the usual complement of police from the several divisions, and the Ordnance De partment with their-rockefc apparatus, turned out to render aid. Colonel Cos, the Com missioner of Police, and Mr. Simpson, his Deputy, were also present. About 9 a.m. the cyclone passed to the North, and there being no further, danger anticipated, the military and the police were ordered to dis perse. Me. Gladstone and Slate-writing. '— The following extract is from the current issue of the Harbinger of Light ;—' Mr. GladafcouSj the British Premier, has recently had a stance witii Mr. W. Eglinton,- the celebrated medium for psychography, or slate-writing, and having approached the subject in a rational and philosophic manner, exhibiting a scientific spirit which the so called scientific meri usually dispense with when dealing with spiritualistic phenomena, has not only' expre3sed himself satisfied with his experiences, but ventured to hint that scientific men acted unscien fically in denying the existence of forces in. nature which they had never attempted to investigate. -The secular Press is very much exercised over this, and doubtles3 the religious Press will be seriously troubled. The Weekly Despatch, indeed, questions his right to attend a stance at all, and foresees s a world ot mischief rising np as a result of hi3 deprecation of the action of scientific men. It appears also from the Daily News that Mr. Gladstone is being written to by busybodies, and in one instance has allowed ht3 subordinate to pen a brief reply, in which, however, he simply calls attention .to the fact that he has 'expressed ao conclusion on the subject.' This i3, doubtless, intended as an intimation to busybody and his con frdres that it will be time enough to make a noise when! he has'.publicly announced his belief in spiritual manifestations.'
