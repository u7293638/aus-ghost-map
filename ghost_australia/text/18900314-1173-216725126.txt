An Ocean Tragedy; BY W. CLARK RUSSELL. CHAPTER XVIII. IS SHE THE "SHA1K?" It •was not to prove a gale, though it would have been hpd to guess what lay behind that dirty jumble of white and livid terraces which had been stealthily creeping all the morning zenithwards. The clouds scattered to the rush of the wind, the sun with a brightened disk leapt from one flying vaporous edge to' another, dazzling out the snows of the dissolving seas till the eye reeled from the glare of the brilliant foam and the sharp and lovely sparkle of the pure dark blue between. Indeed, before. long the wind steadied down into a noble sailing breeze with a piebald sky of warm and cheerful weather steadily swinging into the southeast, as though the whole heaven revolved from one quarter to another like a'.panorama on a cylinder. Wilfrid looked his wishes, but said nothing. He hung apart in a fashion that web "the ..same as telling me iokeep oflj horhad he anything to say to Miss Jennings. Finn easily interpreting his master's face, piled cloths on the yacht till it seemed as though {inother rag .would blow the whole ibfty white fabric of' canvas, tapering spar,-and rig-; ging 'clean over the bows. We fled along » thunder, and to; every curtsy of the vessel's head the water recoiled in a roar of spume as far as the jibboom end, to speed-aftasfast, you would have tliought, as the eve could follow it, the swell washingto the counter as if to help her. • We held on in this way for some time, when suddenly, Wilfrid, who had come to* stand at the weather imtaind*was looking : ahead, bawled trithi the'note of a shriek' in his voice, .«• Lpokj^xc^^ajag his long arm pointing directly on a line with cnir bcwBprit. ' • .-.••'• ."Ay, there die insure enougl!'' cried I»«sl caught sight, to a floating, lift of \- thedeck at that moment, of the pearlish gleam of'canvas of a .milky brilliance ; slanting past the soft whiteness of a head of sea against the marble look of the sky there, where the sun4ouched clouds were going down to the ocean edge in a crowd with a vein of violet here.. and- there , amongst them. I glanc&l; at Wilfrid, not knowing what, sort - of mood this first glimpse of the yacht would put into him, but there was no'alteration of face. His countenance had. set into an iron hard expression ; methought resolution could never show more grimly stubborn. Miss JenningB came to the side to look. '' There is little to beseen isy et," said I to her, "but we shall be heaving her hull up very soon. She is taking it quietly." Finn stood near; I took his glass from him and levelled it. V Why,'tis merely ambling with her, capteili," said I; "gaff topsails down and no hint of squaresail that I can. make out. The cloud we are making astern should puzzle her. D'ye think Captain Fidler will recognise this vessel!" "Why, yes, sir; bound to it," he answered; "we aren't like theShark, you know ; our figure-head alone is as good as naming us. Then our sheex. of bow 'ud sarvelike a sign-post to Fidler. Back this by our square -rig and he'd have .to ha'sfalien dark to mistake," meanine i»v dark, blind. j •" ** be as easily recognised ? " asked Miss Jennings, who stood close by me, occasionally laying her hand upon my arm to steady herself and putting the other to her lips to speak^ for the breeze rang with a scream in it at times over the rail in a manner to sweep the words out of her mouth asthough -her syllables were the smoke of a'dgaiette. Finn shook his long head. : . "Lay me close, aboard, miss," said he,' "and I'll tell you"the Sharkfrom another craft; but there's -nothen distinct about her as there is with us. She's black without gilt like a great many others, of a slaving pattern, long, low, without spring forrads or aft, with apple sidS&%e other*, again. But," said he after a pause, during which he had taken a look through his telescope at the glistening fragment hovering like a butterfly over the bow, "though I don't want to say too much, sir, I'd Be willing to lay down a good bit of money on the chaiice of yonder chap proving the •Shark. - Time, place, all sarcumstances point her out." "True," said I; "but there are many -hooners afloat." " Ay, sir; but such a coincidence as fhat, your honour," said he- pointing, " Bits tp far on the weige of what's likely to fit it to sarve as part of a man's reckonings." "I agree with Captain Finn," said Miss Laura ; "beside, 1 feel here that it is the vessel we are pursuing." She laid her hand upon her bosom and turned to cross the deck where her chair was. I assisted her to her seat with a peep out of the corner of my eyes at Wilfrid, but there was no encouragement in his face ;. so, posting myself forward of the companion for the shelter of it, I lighted a cigar and puffed away in silence till the luncheon bell rang. Wilfrid did not come to table. When I returned on deck after lingering nearly an hour below, partly with the wish to put some heart into Miss Jennings, nrho was pitifully dejected and nervous, and partly because I had had a l«ng spell in the open air and guessed that for some lame yet there would be little enough of the schooner showing to h« worth looking at—I say when I returned I found my cousin at the rail with his arms tightly clasped on his breast f taring fixedly ahead, with a face grim, indeed, with the scowling contraction of she brows, but as collected in the determined severity of it as can be imagined. In fact, the sight of the schooner ahead w c o h a b S had gathered all his faculties and wandering fancies and imaginations into a bunch, so to speak, and his mind as you saw it in his eyes, in the set of his lips, in the resolved and contained posture of his body, was as steady as that of, the sanest man aboard us. It was without wonder, however, that I perceived we had risen the yacht to the line of her rail, when_ noticed that she still kept under short canvas whilst the Bride was bursting through the surges to the impulse now even of the lower studdingsaiL 1 took Finn's glass from him and made out _ very handsome schooner, loftily sparred with an immense head to her mainsail, the boom of which hung far over her quarter, whilst she swang in graceful floating leapinga from hollow to ridgo with the round of her stern lifting black and flashing off each melting brow that underran her. We had, indeed, come up with her hand over hand, but then it would be almost the worst point of sailing for _ fore-and-aft vessel, whilst we. were carrying in our square rig alone pretty nearly the. same surface of canvas that she had abroad. She was too far off as yet, even with the aid of the glass, to distinguish her people. "What do you think, Finn, now? said I, turning to him. He stood close beside me with his long face working with anxiety* and straining his sight till I thought he" would shoot his eyes out of their sockets. "If she ain't the Shark," said he, "she's the.Flying Dutchman. I had but one doubt. Yonder craft's boats are white, and my notion, but I couldn't swear to him, was that the Shark's boats were blue. I've been forrards amongst the men,- a few of whom are acquainted with Lord Winterton's yacht, and one of 'em says her boats was blue, whilst th'others are willing to bet their lives that they are white." -* But thecut of heras she shows yonder proves her the Shark, you think ? " do, sir," he answered emphatically. " Well,"said I, fetching a deep breath, "after this hang me if I don't burn my book and agree with your mate, old Jacob Crimp, to believe in ghosts/' f . Ilevelled the glass again'and uttered an exclamation as I got the lenses to bear upon her. "By thunder, Finn! yes, they look to have th!e scent of us now.- See! there goes her gaff topsail!" Wilfrid caught my words. "Whatare they doing? " he roared, bursting out in a mad way from his rapt iron-like sile»ce, "making sail, d'ye say?" and he came running up to us with an odd thrusting forward of his head as though straining to determine what was scarce more than a blur to his short sight. He snatched the glass from my hand. " Yes," he shouted, " and there goes her squaresail. By every saint, Finn, there's an end of my doubts," and he closed the glass with a ringing of the tubes as he telescoped them that would have made you think the thing was in pieces in his hands. " Shall I signal her to heave to, your honour ? " exclaimed Finn, speaking with a doubtful eye as if measuring the dis tance. Ay, at once,"cried Wilfrid, "but"— he cast a look at the gaff end—" shell not see your colours there," pointing vehe mently. " I'll run 'em up at the fore. Sir Wilfrid ; they'll blow out plain there with the t'gallant halliards let go." "Do as you will, only you must make her know my meaning," cried my cousin, and .he went with an impetuous stride right aft and resumed his.fonner sentinel posture. Miss Jennings came timidly up to me. " S m w ccaw y y p bo o t y a n cwm s g s p " She is the Shark, then ? " she said in a low voice. 7 • All who.know her are. agreed, Finn says, saving here and there a doubt about the colour of her boats," 1 answered. •She had a sailor's eye for sea effects, and,, instantly "noticed that the schooner ahead had broadened her. show of canvas. "Do they suspect who we are?" she exclaimed, talking as though she were musing. "No doubt the Bride is recognised, and they will run away if they can. She looked at Wilfrid. "I do noc like to speak to him," she exclaimed. "He's killing Hope-Kennedy over and over again," said I; "his wife" is before him, too, and he is haranguing her. Bless us, what a wonderful thing human imagination is!" IJp went the signal flags forward in „ string of balls, a man tugged, the bunting broke and streamed out in its variety of lustrous colours, every flag stiff as a sheet of horn handpainted, with the light of the sky past it showing through. I caught myself breathing short and hard whilst waiting for what was to follow this summons to the running craft. We had been crushing through it after her with the speed of a steamer, and, supposing her indeed to be the Shark, had literally verified Wilfrid's boast that the Bride - could sail two feet to her one. But now that she had broadened her wings there was a threat of considerable tediousness in the chase. "Do you suppose they have made out what yacht we are ? " I asked Finn. "Likely as not, sir. I shall think so for sartin if they don't shorten sail on reading that bunting up there. A stranger 'ud be willing enough to speak us. Why not ? 'Tis understandable that Fidler should have kept his rags small in the face of the muck that was crawling in the nor'rad this morning. He's got nothen to chase, and was always a careful man, so I've heard, and I tell ye, sir," said he in a subdued way, speaking with his eyes fixed on Miss Jennings, who stood close with a hite face, "that the sight of his easy anvas is almost the same to me as seeing f her ladyship a sitting there," levelling w is hairy finger at the yacht, "for, fond m s she was of the water, let anything of a t reeze come and she.was always for halving sr ir Wilfrid reduce* sail." He put the glass to his eye as he spoke. " Hillo!" he exclaimed in an instant, "they're hoisting a colour. There it goes—there it blows. Oh my precious eyes! What is it ? what is it 1" he rumbled, talking to himself and working into the glass as though he would drive an eye clean through it. "Why, Mr. Monson," he bawled, " I'm Field Marshal the Duke o' Wellington, sir, if she han't hoisted Dutch colours." I snatched the glass from his hand, and sure enough made out the Batavian horizontal tri-coloiir streaming from the peaksignal halliards like a fragment of rainbow against the lustrous curve of the main sail. " Wilfrid," I shouted, addressing him as he stood right aft, Miss Laura and I and the skipper being groupeda little forward of the main rigging, "they've hoisted Dutch colours. She's a Hollander, not the Shark I" and I fetched something like a breath of relief, for it was a condition of suspense that you wanted to Bee and end to one fashion or another as quickly as possible. ' He approached us slowly, took the glass from my hand in silence and after a steady inspection turned to Finn. "She's the Shark," he said, with fierce snap in his manner that was like letting fly a, pistol at the skipper. " Your honour thinks so ? " "Don't you?" . "Them Dutch colours, Sir Wilfrid " A device, a trick! What could confirm one's suspicion more than yonder display of a foreign ensign? She's the Shark, I tell you, and that colour's ; stratagem. What do you say, Charles ? " I'm blest if I know what to think,' said I. "If she's the Shark, why has she taken it so leisurely, only just now setting her squaresail and gaff topsail though we have been in sight for a long time, crowding down upon her under a press that should-awhile since have excited their suspicions? No need for them to hoist Dutch colours. If Fidler thinks he is chased, why don't he haul his wind instead of keeping that fore- and-aft concern almost dead before it, as if he didn't know on which side to carry his main boom? " " She's the Shark 1" thundered Wilfrid, " the flag she iB flying iB a lie. Finn," he cried in a voice so savagely -imperious, so confoundedly menacing, that I. saw Miss Laura shrink, whilst the pobr skipper gave a hop as thoHgh he had touched something red-hot; "are we overhauling that vessel I" "Yes, Sir Wilfrid." "How long will it take us to come within gunshot of her ? " Finn scratched the back of his head. "Mr. Monson, sir," said he, addressing -me, "that gun 'ull throw about threequarters of a mile, I allow." " Call it a mile," said L My cousin, with his nostrils distended to the widest, his respiration hysteric, his whole body on the move, and with that raised look in his face I have formerly described, stared at Finn as though he would slay him with his gaze. The skipper scratched the back of Ms head again. " Well, your honour, if yon schooner holds as she is and this here breeze don't take oS, we ought to be within gunshot, 1 here he produced a silver watch of the size and shape of an apple, "in three hours' time, making it about half-past ive." " How far is she distant now ? " "Betwixt three and four mile, Sir Wilfrid." Get your gun ready." A blank shot, your honour?" A blank devil and be damned to you, Load with ball. Who's your gunner ?" " We shall have to manage amongst us, ir Wilfrid," turning a face of alarm upon e. I was about to remonstrate, but there as an expression in the eye that my ousin bent, on me at that instant that aused me to take Miss Jennings' hand as n invitation to her to cross the deck and alk. "Charles," said he, "you told me that ou knew something about gunnery. Will ou handle that weapon yonder for me?" "Wilf, it is madness," said I. -What! lump, a shot into a craft that may not e the vessel -you want! or, which in my pinion is just as bad, fire at with a chance f sinking a yacht with a lady aboard— hat' lady, your wife—the woman whom ou have embarked on this extraordinary dventure to rescue?" My blood rose with my words. I dared ot trust myself to reason with him. I rossed the deck with Miss Laura, and hen we faced round I spied Wilfrid arching forwards with Finn, and preently he was by the side of the gun r esticulating vehemently to a body of b eamen who had collected round the t iece. s Our signals were kept flying at the fore, whilst with the naked eye one could behold the minute spot of colour steadfast at the schooner's peak. Onwards she held her course, swarming steadilyforward in long gliding curtsyings over each frothing surge that chased her, a most shapely and beautiful figure with a long flash of her low black wet side coming off the line of foam like a lift of dull sunshine, whilst on high soared the stretches of her sails with something of the airiness of a dragon- fly's wing in the milk-white softness of their spaces against the cloudy distance beyond^ The time passed, Wilfrid remained forward. He stood upon one of the anchors swaying with folded arms to the movement of the yacht, stiff as a handspike, his face fixedly directed at the schooner ahead. The sailors hung about, chewing hard, spitting much, saying. things to one another past the hairy backs of their hands; here and there a whiskered face looking stupid with a sort of dull wonder that was like an inane smile; but the fact is, from Cutbill down to the youngest hand all the seamen were puzzled, excited and uneasy. The state of my cousin's mind showed plainly to the least penetrating of those nautical eyes. • No man amongst them could unagine what wild directions would be delivered, and though I made no doubt the gun would be let fly when the order to fire was given, I was pretty sure that should it come to a command to board the schooner by force the men would decline. Sometimes Finn was forward, fluttering near Wilfrid, sometimes aft, restlessly inspecting the compass or going feverishly to the side and looking over, when again and again I would hear him say in a voice as harsh as the sound of a carpenter's )lane: "Gloiy, glory! blow, my sweet jreeze, blow!" manifestly unconscious that he spoke aloud, but evidently obtaining some ease of mind from the ejaculation. The sun went floating down westwards the breeze shifted a point or two towards him and then slackened, though it continued to blow a fine sailing wind with a regular sea that had long before lost the early snappish and worrying hurl put into it by the first of the dark blast. Slowly e had been gaining upon the chase; inute after minute I had been expecting o see her put her helm down, flatten her heets, and go staggering away into the eddening waters weltering and washing to the sky under the descending sun, on what she might knowto be some best point of sailing. She kept her squaresail spread and the Dutch flag hoisted, and swung stubbornly ahead of us, making nothing of our- signals, which still continued to fly. Through Finn's glass I could distinguish the figures of a few seamen forward and a couple of men pacing the weather-side of the quarterdeck. Now and again a head would show at the rail as though watching us, but the suggestion I seemed to find in the general posture and air aboard the vessel was that of indifference, as though, in fact, we had long ago exhausted curiosity, and had been quitted as a spectacle for inboard jobs and the routine of such life as was led there. Is she the Shark?" I said to Finn. "If she isn't," said he, "myeyes ain't mates, sir. It is but a question of the colour of the quarter-boats." • "I see no name on the counter." "No, sir, the Sha/rkhas no name painted on her." "She's steered by a wheel," said L "So is the Shark, sir." ''What do the men forward who know the Shark think now?" I asked. "Two of 'em say that it ain't her; the rest that it is. But ne'er a man aboard has that knowledge of her that 'ud give him conscience enough to take an oath upon it. Gloiy, gloiy, there she walks! By the piper that played afore Moses in the woods, your honour, 'twill be the fairest sunrise that ever I see that lights up th e end of this dammed mess, begging your pardon, Mr. Monson* arid yours, miss, I'm sure. Fact is, I feel ail of a work inside me, like a brig's boom in a calm." r . "I am unable to hold the glass steady, said Miss Laura. "Mr. Monson, I see no signs of a lady on board. Do you, Captain Finn?" "Not so much as the twinkle of a hinch of petticoat, miss ; but if her ladyship's there, of course she'd keep below." " You know Captain Fidler," said I. " Very well, sir." "There are two figures walking that quarter-deck. -Is one of them he?" " It's too fur off, sir. I've been looking and looking, but it's too fur oflj I say, sir. Mind!" he suddenly roared, "they're a-going to fire," and he rolled hurriedly forwards. A moment or two after, crash ! went the gun. The blast broke in a dead shock upon the. ear, and the smoke blew away Qver the lee-bow as red with the tincturing of the sun as a veil of vapour at the edge of the crimson moon. Miss -Jennings shrieked. "A long yearning gush of sea catching the Bride fair on the quarter swungher for a breath or two "so as to hide the schooner, then to her next yaw with Wilfrid still on the anchor bending forward in impetuous headlong pose and two or three sailors handling the gun and a crowd of men in the head staring their hardest, the chase swept into view afresh. " Ha! " I shouted, " she's heaving to." " Oh, Mr. Monson!" cried Miss Jennings," clasping her hands. Instantly Finn-.fell to thundering out orders. "" In sturTsails 1 clew up the t'garnsail! down squares! ; down gaff tops'l!" Twenty such directions volleyed from him; in a trice the decks of the Bride: were as busy as an anthill; canvas rattled like musketry as it was hauled down;, the strains of Cutbill's whistle shrilled high above the voices of the meiy and a true ocean meaning came rolling into the commotion and clamour from the yeasty seething over the side, the sirring of the wind past the oar, and the frisky motions of the yacht as she brought the sea on her bow heading, to Finn's yell to the man at the helm, to range to windward of the schooner that was how fast coming round with her squaresail descending, her main tack hoisting and her topsail withering with her head to the west. Distance is mightily deceptive at sea. How lax off the schooner was when they let drive at her from our forecastle I could not say. She was probably out of range; at all events', she showed no damage as she came rounding to, away down upon the throbbing blue which had softened much within the hour, with a bronze gleam of sheathing, as she heeled over ere her canvas broke shivering in the eye of the wind, that wonderfully heightened the beauty of the long, low, black, most shapely hull, and the bland and elegant fabric of bright spar and radiant cloths shining white yet through the faint claret tinge in the atmosphere. Wilfrid came slowly aft, constantly looking at her as he walked. Under reduced canvas we swept down leisurely, sliding lightly upon the un of the surge that was now on the eam. I examined her carefully through he glass whilst Miss Laura stood by my ide asking questions. Is shp the Shark f" ' She may be. But such of her crew I make out don't look to me to be English." ' " Can- yon distinguish any women on board?" Nothing approaching a woman. They mean to board us. They have a fine boat of a whaling pattern hanging to leeward, and there are sailors preparing to lower her. They are not Englishmen, I swear. I see a large fat man delivering orders apparently with sluggish gesticulations, winch strike me as distinctly Dutch. How about her figure-head ?" 1 continued, and I brought the glass to bear on the bowis of.' the schooner. " Ha ! " I cried, and looked round. Wilfrid was watching the schooner right aft, where he had stood during the greater part of the chase, his arms folded as before, the same iron-hard expression on his countenance. I called to him. "What is the figure-head of the Shark?" He started, and answered, "I don't know. Ask Finn," and so saying walked towards us. The skipper was giving some instructions to Crimp on the other-side of the deck. " Captain Finn," I called, "Sir." " What's the Shark's figure-head? " "A gold ball in a cup shaped like a 1 lily, your honour." "Then, Wilfrid," I cried, shoving the glass into his hands, "your pursuit must carry you further afield yet, for that craft's figure-head is a white efiigy, apparently a woman's head." His manner to the sudden, desperate surging of the disappointment in him fell in a breath into the old form of the craziness of his moods of excitement. He looked through the glass, and then roared out— "Finn." The skipper came bundling over to us. " That vessel is not the Shark." " I've been afeared not, sir, I've been afeared not," said Finn. " Like as two eggs end on; but now she's drawed out —'tain't only the figure-head. She han't got the Shark's length of bowsprit." Wilfrid dashed the telescope down on to the deck. " A fool's chase !" he exclaimed, scarcely intelligible for the way he spoke with his teeth set. " Heavenly f s c d y h God, what disappointment 1 But it should have been Monday, it should have been Monday," and his gaze went into a scowling, wandering way from us to the schooner. I suppose you know," said I to Finn, ." th»t they're standing by to lower a boat when we* shall have come to a stand ? " "Ay, shy I" know it," exclaimed Finn, who had picked up his telescope and was feeling over it in a nerrouB, broken-down manner as though he feared it : was injured, but durst vnot look to make sure while Wilfrid stood nigh. " I shall heave to to looard for their convenience," and with that he walked aft to the wheel Wilfrid looked crashed with something absolutely lifeless m.ipKdtill leadeiiliteiaf of his eyes.- ;.It was '^erhaps forhifiabe for- us, if not for him, that Ihis suddeh prodigious blow of disappointment should have completed the sense of physical and mental exhaustion -which inevitably attended the war of emotions that iad been going on all day in his weak mind, otherwise heaven alone knows what miserable and painful display might have followed this failure of his expectations. I was much affected by his manner, and endeavoured to console him, but he motioned me to silence with a gesture of the hand, and seated himself on-the skylight, where he remained, with his arms folded and his eyes fixed od the deck, apparently heeding nothing that passed around him. "He'll rally after a little*" said I to Miss Laura,'who furtively, watched him with eyes jsad with the'shadow of teari ' " It ought to have been the Shark, Mr. Monson, 1 '-she'exclaimed in a low voice. "My; cowardly heart all day has-been praying ^thenrase^and nOWxwould give teg^?® 18 of ny life that my sister were ty|fer-for Ms- sake, for mine, and for yoiirs 'too, thkt this ^retched voyage of —ohi, and I do not know what else," she added with a little toss of her arms like a •wringing of her hands, " might come to an end. The sailors forward-were eyeing the sssel steadily as wespprbached her. By this time all han^^were aware of the blunder that had ^n. made, aiid one seemed to see a. kind fif suspense in the posture of the felloes, with a half grin in it, too, as though 'twsts an incident id be as much laughed at as wondered at. The breeze continued to. slacken, the seas were momentarily losing weight as they rolled, the gushing of tie western crimson floatec I in the air like ia delicate red smoke, with a heap, of flame-ooloured' iclouds resting broodlngly upon the : sonthern confines'; and the new nioon OTerithesun, a wonder for the bright sharirtiess ^of: its curve in such a hectic as she stood in.

Get us -out of this mess as best you can, pid -asjjuickly." \- He spoke faintly, apd slightly stagge after he had risen/ Miss jennings, seeing this, took his arm; and together they went below. I stood at the gangway along with friend Finn. Twas a ludicrous position to be in, and what excuses to make lknew not, unless it was to come to my explaining the full motive audi meaning of our expedition—a sort of Candour i did hot like the idea of. In ihej stern- sheets of the approaching boat WHS the large fat man lhad previously taken notice of in the schooners quarter-deck; His face was as round as the mooi^ with a smudge of bristiy yelicW injmstache under a bottleshaped nosej; his person was the c^mpletest pudding «' figure, that can * "be imagined, as though, forsooth, a huge su 't of clothes had teen filled out with suet. He wore a blue |ap with a shovel-shaped peak, and a piece of gold lace on it going from one brass button to the other. "That's not Fidler,t' said I to Finn. " Fidler !" he ejaculated, staring with all his.might at the boat, "there's twenty Fidlers in that man, yoir honour. Why, Fidler's a mere rib, lean enough to shelter himself -under-the lee ct a ropeyarn." ,'£Thb boat came fizzint alongside hand homely, and the' fat man, watching his opportunity, planted iimself upon the steps and rose like a whale to our deck, upon : Which he stepped. In a very phlegmatic, leisurely way he stood staring around him for a little out of a pair of -small, greenish, expressionless eyes, and with fi countenance! that discovered no" signs of any sort of emotion ; then a cht f latir t o a I w t in the deepest voice I fever heard in a man, a tone thjit literally "vibrated upon Ihe. ear like the low note of a church organ, he said in Dutch, "Who speaks my language ?" ! I knew a few sentences in German, enough to enable me to understand his question, hilt j by no meanS^" enough to converse withi even if ihe cinan spoke that tongue, so;I said bluntly in F-ngljafy "No one, sir." J He wheezed a bit, lofSring stolidly at me, and" exclaimed, "You are Captain ?" : " . I motioned-to Finn. ' "^yy^^ire ot me ? " he demanded, turning his f^t, emotionless-face upon the skipper. : - Finn tohchfed his cap. " Heartily sony, sir : 'twas iatta plunder happening through our mistaking you for another craft. I'm very willing to 'pologise and do whatever's right." j The Dutchman listened apathetically, then slowly bringing his fist of the shape, if not the Mie, of a leg of beef to his vast spread of jbieast,: he exclaimed in a voice even deepen than, his former utterance, " Yot I ask£s, vy you vire ot me ? " Finn substantially repeated his former apology. T The Dutchman gazed at him dully, with, an expression of glassiness coming into[his eyes. " Yot schip dis ? " Finn answered with alacrity, " The schooner-yaclit, Bride, sir." "ZhevilgtvoiTherr nation ? " sending a lethargic glance at our masthead as if in search of a pennant. " No, sir," cried Finn, " we're a pleasure vessel." " Der is no var," exclaimed the Dutchman, shaking his head, "between mine coundry and yours." '1 Ho no, sir," exclaimed Finn. "Den I ask," said the Dutchman in a voice like a trombone, " vy you vire ot me?" This promised no end. I hastily whispered to Finn, " Leave him to me. Turn to quietly and trim sail and get way upon the vessel. He'll take no other hint, I Finn sneaked off. " Pardon me, said I, "yoju'll have heard from the aptain that our 'firing at you was a bluner into which we were led by mistaking our ship. We desire to tender you our umble apology, which I trust you will see your way to accept without delay as we are very desirous of proceeding on our voyage." , He looked at me with a motionless head and a face as vacant of human intelligence as a cloud, with its fat, its paleness, its Alp upon Alp of chin, then ponderously ana slowly putting his hand into his breast he polled out a great pocket-book and said, " Yot dis schip ;s name ?

CHAPTER XIX. A MYSTERIOUS VOICE. Tms was an incident to give one a deal to think and tali about. Certainly little imaginable coi'-d be stranger than that we, being in %hase of a fore-and-aft schooner yacht, should fall in with vessel so resembling the .object of our pursuit as to deceive the sightof men.who professed to know, the Shark weH. should have been glad to ask the Dutchman about his craft, yet it was a matter of no'moment whatever. : Hie thing had happened, it was passing, strange, and there was an end. Likely though she was an English vessel purchased for some opulent trader in the. is «uid of (Tura$oa, and on. her way- to that -possession in charge of the porpoise who had honoured us with a visit. The incident signified only as a disappointment. All dinner time I had been fretting over it, for since sunrise I had been thinking of the vessel ahead as the Shark ; counted, in a sort of unreasoning, mechanical, silent way, upon capturing Lady Monson out of her, which, of course, would mean a shift of helm for us and home again. Wilfrid bore the blow better than I had dared to expect. He made a.good dinner, for which ne had the excuse of having fasted since breakfast, and broke into a noisy roar of laughter out of the air of gloomy resentment with which he had arrived from his cabin on my describing the Dutchman, and repeating his questions nd my answers. In short, his weak mind ame to his rescue. With the schooner ad vanished an inspiration of thought hat had served his intellect as an anchor to ride by. His imagination was now luent again, loose, draining here and there ike water on the decks.of a rolling ship ; nd though be spoke with vehement biterness of his disappointment, and with ndignation and rage even.of Finn's ignoance in pursuing a stranger throughout he day, he dwelt very briefly at a time n the subject. Indeed, his talk was just n aimless stride from one thingto another. f he recurred to the Dutch schooner, it as as if by mere chance; and, though he subject would blacken his mood, in a very short while he had passed on to other matters with a cleared face. Miga Laura afterwards said to me that the strain of the day had/ been too great for him, and that when the tension was relaxed the strings of the instrument of his mind dropped into slack fibreB, out of which his reason could fiddle but very little music, Well, I could have wished it thus for everybody's sake. Better as it was than that he should have shrunk away scowling and hugging a dark mantle of madness to him, and exaggerated the abominably uncomfortable behaviour I had witnessed in him all day. He arrived on deck after dinner to smoke a cigar, and whilst I sat with Miss Jennings—for it was "a quiet night after the stormy blowing of the day, with a tropic tenderness of temperature in the sweet gushing of the southerly wind, the curl of moon gone, and the large stars trembling through the film of their own radiance like dewdrops in gossamer—I could hear my cousin chatting briskly near the wheel with Finn with intonations of voice that curiously proclaimed the variableness of his moods to the ear, sometimes speaking with heat, sometimes in a note of sullen expostulation, sometimes surprising the attention with a loud ha, ha ! that came floating back again to the deck in echoes out of the silent canvas, whilst Finn's deep sea-note rumbled a running commentary as the baronet talked. "What do you think of this chase now ? " said I to Miss Laura. "I wish it were over," she answered. " I want to see my sister.rescued from the wretch she has run away with, Mr. Monson, but this sort of approaching her recovery is dreadful." " It is worse than dreadful," said I; "it is tedious with the threat of a neat little tragical complication by-and-bye—any day indeed—if Wilfrid doesn't stow that gun in his hold or heave it overboard. The Dutchman might very well have answered our shot had he mounted a piece or two or driven alongside and plied us, as they used to say, with small arms. Now one isn't here for that sort of thing, Miss Jennings." "No. Is there no way of losing the cannon ? " I laughed. '' If Wilfrid will reserve his fire until he is sure of the Shark instead of blazing away at the first craft that resembles her, the weapon might yet prove something to usefully serve his turn ; for I doubt if anything will hinder the Colonel from cracking on when he catches sight of us, short of iron messages from the forecastle there., Bat we shall Hot meet with the Shark this side the Cape, if there." " I fear it will prove a long Voyage," said she, with the sparkle of the starlight in her eyes. " You will be glad to return?" . "Not without mv sister." - "But shall you be willing, Miss Jennings, supposing ustoarriveait CapeTown jfithout falling in with the Shcunk, td persevere in this very sihgular and xmprpmis- Ing sea quest ? " ^ . - " I will remain with Wilfrid certainly, she answered .quietly.*" "My-duty is to help him in this search, add Where Tie goes I shall go." 1 ' : '. ~- s . " But he will be acting cruelly to xarry y<)u on from the Cape unless able to certainly tell where to find the fugitives, fixing the date too for that matter." ; ., "I see you will leave us at the C4j»e, Mr. Monson," she exclaimed with .an 4ccent that could only' come' from the Movement of- the lips in a smile.. . '' Not unless I prevail upon you to acfcompany me home," said I. " - - She shook her head lightly, but made mo answer. Perhaps it was her- silence that rendered me sensible of the_ unpremeditated significance of my "speech. ""Well," said I lighting a second cigar, " whilst you feel it your duty to stick' to my cousin I shall feel it mine to stick- to you. _ Not likely I should leave you alone \- f with him. No. At that instant the harsh, surly voice of old Jacob Crimp hailed the skipper, who Still stood aft talking with Wilfrid. 'All was in darkness forward; it was hard upon two bells ; the canvas rose as elusive to the eye in its wanness as a dim light; ih windy gloom far out to sea, and the shadow of it plunged a dye as opaque as blindness into the obscurity from the mainmast to the forecastle rail, where the stars were sliding up and down like a dance of fire-flies to the quiet lift and fall of the close-hauled yacht upon the invisible folds brimming to her port" bow. " Capt'n," sung out Crimp's melodious voice—plaintive as the notes of a knife upon a revolving grindstone—from the heart of the murkiness somewhere near the galley. "Hallo !" answered Finn. 7 " Can I speak a word with ye ? " " Who is it wants me ? " "The mate." ^ "Tell him to come aft," Wilfrid bawled out. " If there's anything wrong I must know it. Step aft, Crimp, step aft, d'ye hear ? " he cried. Old Jacob's stunted figure came out of the darkness and walked along to where Finn stocJd. • : " " What is the matter, I wonder ? " said - Miss Laura. I cocked my ear, for there is something in "a hail of this sort at sea on a dark night to put an alertness into one's instincts and nerves. Besides, there was no sounder snorer on board than old Jacob, and'.his' -merely coming up on deck duringAhis~ watch below, though he should have stood mute as a ghost, was something to raise a little uneasy sense of expectation. His voice rumbled, but I could not hear what he said. Wilfrid shouted " What d'ye say ? " with an expression of astonishment and incredulity. Finn laughed in a sneering" way, whilst old Jacob again rumbled out with some sentence. Then my cousin bawled out " Charles, Charles, come here will you?" " What the deuce is the matter now ? " said I, and Miss Laura followed me as I went over to the group. " Here'sa nice pickle we're in, Charles/' cried Wilfrid. " What think you ? Crimp swears the yacht's haunted." " So she be," said Crimp. " Pity your mother didn't sell vinegar, Jacob, that you might have Btayed at home to bottle it ofi^" exclaimed Finn. " Haunted ! That may do for the marines, but you won't get the sailors to believe it." "That's just what they do then," remarked Crimp. " All the watch below have heard it and can't sleep in consequence." *' Heard what 1" I asked. "The woice," answered .Jacob, "the same as you and me heard 'tother night." "Have you heard a voioe, Charles?" exclaimed Wilfrid, suddenly fetching a deep breath. "A mere fancy," stud I. " Ye didn't like it anyhow," said Crimp gruffly as though speaking aside. "For God's sake tell me about this voice, Charles," cried Wilfrid, agitated all on a sudden and restless as a dog-vane, with the twitching of his figure and the shifting of his weight from one leg to another. I related the incident, making light of it, and tried to persuade him that the mere circumstance of my having said nothing about it proved that I regarded it as a deceit of the hearing. "Did you know of this, Laura ?" said Wilfrid. "Asa joke only," she answered. "A joke," cried he, breathing deep again. " The voice sounded off the sea, hey ? and two of you heard it ? What did it say ? " and I could see him by the starlight looking towards the starboard quarter in the direction wfience the syllables had floated to us. - "What did it say?" he repeated. " Why, that this here yacht was cussed," rattled .out Jacob defiantly, " anddumme if I don't think she be now that the blooming corpse belonging to the wreck is a- jawing and n-threatening of all hands down in the forepeak." " What is this man talking about ? " I exclaimed, believing that he must either be drunk or cracked. He's come aft to tell us, Mr. Monson," answered Finn, " that he and others of the watch below have been disturbed by a woice in the hold saying that there's a ghost aboard, and that the only way to get rid of .him is to sail straightaway home and end this woyage which, saving the lady's presence, it calls blarsted nonsense." I observed old Jacob's head vigorously nodding. " You've heard the voice too, Charles?" said Wilfrid, flitting in short, agitated strides to and fro beside us. " Mr. Monson heard it twice," growled Jacob, " off the wreck as well as off the quarter." " Speak when you're spoken to," cried Finn. " Why, spit me, Mr. Monson, if it ain't old Jacob's grandmother as has signed on instead of Crimp himself." "Look here," said Crimp, "let them what disbelieves step forrards and listen themselves." Charles, inquire into this matter with Finn, will you ?" exclaimed Wilfrid. " I_ I—" he stopped and passed his hand through Miss Jennings' arm, immediately afterwards saying with a short, nervous laugh, " the sound of a supernatural voice would cost me a night's rest." " Come along, Finn," said I. " Come along, Crimp. If there be a ghost, as our VY YOU TIRE OT MB? friend here says, he must promptly be laid by the heels and despatched to the Red Sea." " "What did'ee -want to go and tell Sir Wilfrid about that voice you and Mr. Monson heard 'tother night ?" grumbled Finn, as we moved forwards into the darkness towards the forehatch. "Cause its true," answered Crimp in his sullenest manner. "'Sides it's time to end this here galliwanting ramble, seems to me, if we're going to be talked to and cursed by sperrits." Finn made no answer. We arrived at the forehatch and descended. %io Bride's forecastle was a large one for a vessel of her size. On either hand abaft was a small cabin partially bulkheaded off from the sailors' sleeping-room, • respectively occupied by Jacob Crimp and CutbilL Whether the mate ate with the captain, whose berth was just forward of the one that hod been occupied fcy Muffin^ with access by means of a sliding door to a small living room through which be could pass into the forecastle, I cannot say. It was a rough Bcene to light upon after the elegance; glitter, land rich dyes of the fittings of our quart&rg; alt, but the more picturesque for thatquality as l found it now, at least on viewing the homely and coatee interior hgr; the light of a small oil lamp of the tfhape.of a block-tin coffee-pot with a greasy sort of = flame" coming out of tKe spout, and'byrning darkly into a corkscrew of sioaoke that wound hot and illflavoured to the upper deck. There were bunks for the seamen and two or three hammocks slung right forward ; suits of oilskins hung by nails against the stantions, and swung to the motion of the Vessel like the bodies of suicides swayed by the wind. The deck was encumbered by sea-chests cleated or otherwise secured. Hera and there glimmering through the twilight in a bunk I took notice of a little framed picture, a pipe rack, with other odds and ends, trifling home memorials, and -the artless conveniences with which poor Jack equips himself. There w&e; seamen lyingin their beds, a visum of leathery no'seis forking up put of a hedge of whisker,^with fright wide- awake eyes • that' made one think of glow-worms in a bird's nest ; ojsher equally hairy-faced figures in drawers imd wita iiaked feet, huge bare amis dark with moss and prickings in ink, sat with their legs over the edge of flieiriunks. It was with difficulty that I controlled my gravity when on casting a hurried glance round the forecastle on: entering it my gaze lighted on the visage of Muffin, whose yellowness in the doll lamplight showed with the spectral hue of ashes. His bunk was well forward ; his bare legs hung from the edge like a couple "of broomsticks • his hands were clasped ; his head slightly on one side- his posture one of alarm, amid which, however, there still lurked a native qm&ty; of valet-like sleekness with-a sugnervous. Sweet aa t§e Bride doubt, as apleasure vessel compared, with other craft of those times, the 'odour of this interior, improved as it was by the flaring snuff of the lamp, not to mention a decidedly warm night, was by no means of the most delicious. Added to this was theliftand fall of the yacht's bows which one felt here so Btrongly, that, coming fresh from the tender hearings of the afterdeck, you would have imagiied a lively head sea had sprung up on a sudden.' That Muffin should have stood it astonished me. Sleeping as he did, right in the " eyeB," he got the vary full of the motion. Besides, such an atmosphere as this must needs prove the severer as a hardship after the luminoustad flo wet-sweetened air of the cabin. Finn took a leisurely survey <tf the occapante bf -the bunks. • '• f *fmeOi fib 1" 'said he, * what's lie meaning ofthis here talk about a woice? Mr. Crimp's, just come aft to. tell me tbere's somewhat a-Bpeaking under foot here," ' u That's rights sir," remarked Cutbill, . "irho stood bolt upright like a sentry in the entrance to his little berth. "I beg your pardon, Mr.Monson, sir, but it's nigh hand the same sort o speech as hailed us from the wreck." - "'Tis the Sxme.'" said a deep voice from one of the bunks. - v ;. 11 Bats 1" quoth Finn, contemptuously. "Never yet met with the rat aif fcould damn's man's eyes in English," grunted Crimp. " Nor in any oQifer lingo, Mr. Crimp, said a singular looking seaman,whose" lace I had before taken-notioe of as resembling the skin of an over-ripe lemon; He lay on the small of his back blinking at us, and his countenance in that light, that was tendered confusing by the sliding of shadows to the swing of the yacht, made one think of a melon half buried in a blanket. ./..."Well, but see here, my lads," exclaimed Finn, in a voice of expostulation, "what did this here woice say? That's what I want to know. What did it say, men?" " I told 'ee," growled Crimp. But old Jacob's interpretation did not tally with that of the others. The sailors were generally agreed that the voice had ' exclaimed in effect that the yacht was cursed, and that their business was to make haste and sail her home; but some had apparently heard more than others, whilst a few again manifestly embellished, with a notion, perhaps, of making the most of it; but there could be no question whatever that human syllables, very plainly articulated, had sounded from out of the hold ; all hands were agreed as to thai, and proof conclusive as to the sincerity of the men might have been found in the looks of them, one and all. " Silence, now !" cried Finn, " let's listen." We all strained our ears. Nothing broke the silence but the sulky wash of the sea outside, seething dully, the halfstifled respirations of the sailors, who found it difficult to control their hurricane lungs, and the familiar creaking noises breaking out in various parts of the fabric to her swayings. Impressed as 1 was by the agreement amongst the men—arid I had come besides to this forecastle -with the memory very fresh in me of the mysterious voices T had before heard'—I could scarcely hold my face a£ I stood listening,, with my eye glancingirom one hairy countenance to another. The variety of the Jacks' postures, the knowing cock of a bead here and there, the unwinking stare, the strained barkening attafcude, the illustration of superstitious emotions by expressions which were retioered grotesque by the swing of the ltunp, the half - suffocated looks of sdine of|the fellows who were trying to draw their breaths softly, formed .'a "picture to'appeal irresistibly to one's sensfe of the ridiculous. Three minutes passed ; it might have been hours, so long the time seemed. "Seems'it's done jawing, whatever it is," said Finn. We liejjpjned again. "Telllfe it's rats, lads," said Finn. "Asmg cuss was meant for this 'ese craft,''Jj|j3aimed the deep yoice that had before^poken, "perhaps if her owner was to'come below, tho sperrit, if so be it's thot, Ju& tarn to and talk out again." " Tell 'ee, its rats!" cried Finn, scornfully. ' " Hats!" exclaimed Crimp, with great irritation, "if that's all, why donlt Sir Wilfrid lay forrard and listen for hisself ?" "Won't he come?" said one of the men. "Come! no,' 5 rattled out Crimp, "and why ? - 'CauseJie knows it's the truth." "Well," exclaimed Cutbill," speaking with all proper respect, seems to me that what's meat for the dawg ought to be meat for the man in the likes of such a h liumble-come-tumble out of the maintop into the inain-hold sort o' job as h i this." e There was now some grumbling. Crimp t (li;td enabled the men to guess that Wilfrid i •was afraid to enter the forecastle, and suudry sarcasms, with a mutinous touch iii them, passed from bunk to bunk. s " Avast!" roared Finn; "listen if hell a kj>eak noir." o s But no so and resembling a human syllable entered the stillness. "It's rats, I tell 'ee," shouted the skipper, moving to go on deck. " Come along, Mr. Monson. Blamed now if I believe that Jacob is the only grandmother as has signed articles for this here woyage." . But'as' I followed him the exclamations I caught determined me on advising Wilfrid to come forward. He had left Miss Jennings standing alone at the rail, and was walking swiftly here and there with an irritability of gesture that was a sure symptom in him of a troubled and active imagination. On catching sight of me as I emerged out of the blind shadow on the forward part of the yacht, he cried out eagerly, "Well, what have you heard? Is it a voice, Charles ? " " There is nothing to hear," I answered. " Finn disrespectfully calls it rats." " What else, your honour ? " exclaimed Finn, " the squeaking of rata ain't unlike a sort o' language. Put the noise they make alonp with the straining of bulkheads and the like of such sounds, and let the boiling be listened to by a parcel of ignorant sailors, and I allow ye 11 get what might be' tarmed a supernatural woice." Wilfrid burst into one of his great laughs, but immediately after said in a grave and hollow tone, " But you, Charles, have before heard something preternatural in the shape, of a hail off yonder 'quarter, and from the dead man you found on the wreck." "Fancy,mere fancy,"Isaid. "Gracious mercy! am I miking this voyage to carry home frith me a belief in ghosts ? But I wish you'd go into the forecastle with Finn, Wilfrid, and listen for yourself. Make your mind easy: there's nothing to be heard. . A visit from you will pacify the men. They hold that you admit the truth of what they allege by declining to satisfy yourself by listening. Their temper is not of the sweetest. They should be soothed, I think, when it is to be so easily done." He hung in the wind and said in a hesitating way, 41 What do you think, Finn?" " Well, Sir Wilfrid, since, as Mr. Monson says, there's nothen to hear, and nothen therefore to cause ye any agitation, I dorn't doubt that a wisit from you would please the sailors and calm down their minds. I'm bound to say they're oneasy,—yes, I'm bound to say that." " Come, then," cried my cousin, and he abided impetuously into the darkness, followed by the skipper. I gave Miss Laura my arm and we started on a little walk. The awning was furled and the dew everywhere sparkled Eke hoar frost. The quiet night wind sighed in the rigging, and the yacht, a point or' two off her course, and every sheet flat aft, softly broke through the black quiet waters with dull puffs of phosphor at times sneaking by like the eyes of secret shapes risen close to the surface to survey us. The sheen of the binnaole light touched a portion of the figure of the fellow at the. wheel, and threw him and a segment of the circle irhose spokes ho held, out upon the clear, fine, spangled dusk in phantasmal yellow outlines, dim as the impression left on the retina by an object when the eyelid is closed upon it. My fair companion and I talked of the incidents of the day. One thing was following another rapidly, I said. 'Twas like a magic—lantern show; scarcely had one picture, faded out when something fresh was brightening in its room. ' " What manner of sound could it be, she asked, " that the sailors have interpreted into cursings and dreadful warnings ?" ' '.' It was no fancy on my part anyway," said I, " let me put what face I will on it to Wilfrid. If what the men profess to hear be half as distinct as what J heard, there must be se/me kind of sorcery at work, I'll swear." (Tobe continued.)
