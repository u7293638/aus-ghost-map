POETRY. DON 'T RUN DEBT. r wara a debt, Pain for whatigu got. Y'ootli.,5 are not in style, But jar thorem yet awhile; With brush and neeodle, you Can slke themorn "good as new." Thie head. and not the lst, The heart, not the cravat, Makes a success of lifo, For husband, child, and wife. Debt is a frightful ghost, Whbioh haunots us when we most Desire saweet peoace to reign Withlin tihe mind's domain. The floor seems bare and cold, The furniture is old, flut sweot is sleep on straw, Where comoq no fear of law, And the diesourteous dun For debts that should not run. Don'.t.run in debt, bewareol It i a trap, a sOnare; Let fashion put on airs, You seue its whims and cares. Flue feathers someetihes make Fine birds, somirthes they break Thie wings in whioh tbey're worn, Then drooping, soil'd and torn, The bird in sorrow lies, : Under unpiltying skies. Tbe debtor is a slave; " Many a man" that's bravo Pales, trombles, when Ire meets Iis naolghbottr in tho streets, When notes are "oomairg due," What vwill become of you? Unless you meeoot the bill, You are a debtor still. Oh, bo ao Ihonest man; Earn all you fairly can, And spend loss than you earu.
