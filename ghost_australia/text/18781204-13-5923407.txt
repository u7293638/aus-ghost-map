OPERA-HOUSE. METAMORA. A good many years ago an American actor named Allen came to Melbourne and played a piece called ' Metamora.' We could not understand " Metamora then, and now that another American actor, namely, Mr Hamilton, has come and played it, we understand it no better The hero is an Indian chief who has a grievance, also he has a squaw and a child, and he is continually on what Joe Gargery called the "rampage That is to say, he goes to and fro on the earth, like another celebrated character, seeking whom he may devour ne is armed with a short straight sword and a fowling piece and for a while he is apparently invincible At any rate, a number of firearms are simultaneously discharged at him and they have no injurious effect upon him. He engages in several single handed combats, and is uniformly v victorious, until the end of the last act, when having put his squaw to death, he invites a number of soldiers of the period to fire upon him and they being seemingly of an obliging disposition do so, and Mctamori gives up the ghost with appropriate denim dations of his enemies Besides Metamora and his squaw there are several other characters some of them being persons of quality, and we learn a little indistinctly, that one of them is the son of some body who was at first not thought to be his father There also is a council of five, and on one occasion the Indian chief is brought before the council though for what offence is not by any means clear A most agreeable young lady dressed in white, comes and goes in a manner quite out of the limits of explanation The last that is heard of her is that she is taken prisoner by Indians, and carried off to a wigwam, but what done with her at the wigwam we are never allowed to know Two men are in love with her but as the Indian chief kills one of these there is an easy way for the survivor to make his suit successful Whether he does so or not is not revealed to us This play is in five acts and on Monday night the five acts were all got through by half-past 9 o'clock Mr Hamilton, who played Metamora, the Indian chief, seemed a little troubled at this unexampled rapidity, for at the end of the second act he came forward and complained of not being allowed to do till that he had had a mind to do Five acts man hour and a half is certainly quick stage work, so that although the play might be incomprehensible, the rapidity of its performance made some amends for the incomprehensibility Mr Hamilton having a deep voice, an ample appearance and a stake walk which tells well in melodrama, made the character of the Indian Chief stand out a good deal Of the other characters Miss Jessie Grey who played the part of the pretty young person in white is very much to be commiserated, for she had many entrances and exits but neither she or anybody else seemed quite to know what her mission was It must have been a comfort to her when she was dismissed to the wigwam and had no more to do Miss Pelham was the chiefs squaw, and had a name which sounded not unlike Tapioca. She looked picturesque and very miserable and was a good deal hunted by myrmidons She died dreamily, looking into Space for the spirit of her grandfather Mr Boothman was a nobleman who had to meet his death in a resigned manner He appeared quite resigned, and was seemingly very glad to die and we do not wonder Mr Ryan was another nobleman with bad antecedents, and he spoke as if his conscience troubled immensely SodidMr Joyceasanotherperson equality Mr Ireland was theuulnppyyoung man of mysterious parentage, and he also was the reverse of comfortable Mr Phillips as the Chief of the Puritan Council was more dismal than all the rest
