The Shepherd’s Tower at Florence. Forty years ago there was assuredly no spot of ground, out of Palestine, in all the round world, on which if you knew, even but a little, the true course of that world’s history, you saw with so much reverence the dawn of morning, as at the foot of the Tower of Giotto. For there the traditions of faith and hope, of both the Gentile and Jewish races, met for their beautiful labour. The Baptistery of Florence is the last building raised on the earth by the descendants of the workmen taught by Deedalus ; and the Tower of Giotto is the loveliest of those raised on earth under the inspiration of the men who lifted up the tabernacle in the wilderness. Of living Greek work there is none after the Florentine Baptistery ; of living Christian work, none so perfect as the Tower of Giotto ; and under the gleam and shadow of their marbles, the morning light was haunted by the ghosts of the Father of Natural Science, Galileo; of Sacred Art, Angelica ; and of the Master of Sacred Song. Which spot of ground the modern Florentine has made his principal hackney-coach stand and omnibus station. The hackney coaches, with their more or less farm-yard-like litter of occa sional hay, and smell of variously mixed horse manure, are yet in more permissible harmony with the place than the ordinary populace of a fashionable promenade would be, with its cigars, spitting, and harlot-planned fineries ; but the omnibus place of call being in front of the door of the tower, renders it impossible to stand for a moment near it, to look at the sculptures either of the eastern or southern side ; while the north side is enclosed with an iron railing, and usually encumbered with lumber as well; not a soul in Florence ever caring now for sight of any piece of its old artists’ work ; and the mass ot stran gers being on the whole intent on nothing but getting the omnibus to go by steam ; and on seeing the cathedral in one swift circuit, by glimpses between the puffs of it.—Art Journal,
