AN ASPIRATION. God 1 what a pitiful mookery Seems this poor human speech, To paint the mnrvellouB majesty Which my life designs to teach. God 1 how much less than vory death Is this outspoken tongue, To grasp the glorious hymn of faith Which my soul and I have Bung. Oh but for living lips of fire To utter out my heart, And gash the toneB from my spirit lyre In the voice with whioh they Btart 1 Oh but for language that should scorch The innermost boart of hell, And vleam aud glare like a flaming torch Through the deeps where devils dwell Oh for an utterance that should sweep Like the red- bot-lipped Blmoom, And wither the damning things that keep This beautiful world in gloom I Oh for a voice whose tone'should fall Like the touch of a mother's prayer On the sick and sorrowing souls of all Who pine for a holier air I Oh, if my passionate scorn of wrong, My prodigal love of right, And the beautiful hopes that thrill and throng My soul like th« stars of night— Oh, if but these could pasa my lips In the might with which they rise, How I'd tear and trample the black eclipse . That shroudetb my brothers' eyes I O ChriBt I for a boundiors pentecost To rest on my heaving sou!, And give it spceoh of the Holy Ghost Instead ot this stammering dole. Then, Jeeu 1 the lofty hymn Bublime I'd fling on life's panting sea Should ring on the farthest shore of time, And grapple eternity. Riohabd Realf,
