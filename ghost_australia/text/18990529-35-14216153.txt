VIEWS OF CORRESPONDENTS. FEDERATION AND "THE IRON INDUSTRY. TO THE EDITOR OF THE HERALD. Sir,-As I am constantly being asked what effect federation would have on the iron industry of this colony, and also assured that some statement on this "point would assist the cause of union, and as it is impossible to supply every inquirer with the necessary information as fully as could be wished I beg that you will allow me to place the following before the public in your columns in the interests of Australian federation from the" New South Wales Statistical Register for 1897, the latest edition before me at the time of writing, it appears that we imported into this colony during that year by 41 to ii north of iron and steel in various faults, which might have been, and could be, made here in this total I have not included those things which it would be difficult or impossible to produce locally, nor tinplates and tinware This total represents 108,0 of tons, and I may explain that in the case of imported machinery, us the weight is not given, but only the timber of ' packages," I have arrived at my tonnage under this head by assessing its value at the very moderate figure of 6d per ton If that FORMS tons was the result of local manufacture, certainly not less than 1,000 tons of pig iron would burn quired as the necessary raw ni itsrial 1 have been ence but throughout these extra it-s to in her estimate, so as to avoid the danger of exaggeration to produce this quantity of pig iron four blast furnaces, equal to an output of rice tons each per week, would be required Now us to further details to suit these foul furnaces certainly not less than 200 hands would be used and then when the pig son went on its way towards the finished iron and stool stage it must pass through the hands of furnace, forge, converter, and mill, men, etc and the number of these cannot be stated at less than 5000 And there is also the question of providing the law materials necessary to produce the pig iron, which calls for the services of colliers, iron-ore miners, and limestone quarrymen, and, if wool is required, of nmnganesc-orn miners also The hands required in this way would number at the very least 6ft This gives a total so far of KOO hands, and that on the low oat possible calculation On leaving the mills and of orses the metal passes into the hands of the various trades who use it as their raw materialize , engineers, boilermakers Smiths, are a considerable percentage also going direct from the blast furnaces in tho shape of "pig to ironfounders For every man employed in the actual production of the metal in convenient and useable forms it least 20 are employed in subsequently shaping and adapting it for industrial and commer ul purposes so that the annual 1701) must now be multiplied by 6, giving a total under this hen I of 31,3111) or a 1,700 in nil There is another aspect of the question which is often overlooked, and that is (1) the dependents on hands employed and (2) the number of those who supply their daily wants As to the first, we may assume, at the lowest nv forage, that each of the J i,"00 may be credited with a dependency of two (wife and child so that 3 700 multiplied by 3 gives us 107 100 on this account Al to the second, it is generally calculated til it for every one employed in the iron trades Qve others are engaged in supplying his daily wants and the requirements of his household therefore, we must now multiply 5,700 by 'J, and then we shall find that 178 500 has to be added to the already big sum And I might even go further and show that each of those who suppliers should be also credited with family dependents and suppliers but I think it will sufficiently demonstrate the great importance of the industry if the figures remain withou+furtlior addition under tabulated thus 241 900 Total 280 600 At present I have not the latest statistics of all the colonies ready to hand Actual reference to them would show the Australian iron and steel market to be worth between £1,000,000 and £1,000,000 H y oar, but the New South 'W ales figures quoted give an average of 1 7cwt per head in weight of pig iron, and value of £1 Is 6d per head for the trade, on the population returns of December 31, 1898 Ap- plying these averages to the other colonies on the same population data (December 31, 1866) the result is as follows - Pig Iron Tons Victoria 99 000 Queensland 42 e75 South Australia 11 26.7 1 asinania Hi 074 Western Australia 14 91 202,119 And tho value of the iron and steel trade of these five States, on the same basis of calculation, would be - Victor £1,335 713 Queensland BUS 921 South Australia 105 385 Tasmania 1110 GIO Western Australia 1S0.78U £2 of 8 -CO No doubt these figures, showing the number of persons who would be supported by the industry if this colony supplied only her own market, may seem enormous and surprising, but a still greater surprise is to follow, for a simple proportion sum will show that if to produce 111,000 tons benefits 285 600 people, to produce 202,919 tons will benefit 503,915 These stupendous figures are not the result of air flight in June, but of careful calculations, guided by an intimate and thorough knowledge of the subject dealt with and guarded by a firm determination to avoid anything approaching over estimation in order that the tinpot tance of the matter may be quite clearly understood, I will place the totals thus - Persons If N S W supplied her own market only 35 600 If NSW supplied the other five States also then in addition 503 9t j Total 738 M5 Now it only remains for me to point out two plain facts, and to recommend my fellow -citizens to give them full consideration before going to the polls on June 20, viz -1 That New South. Wales is known and acknowledged by every trustworthy man having expert knowledge of the subject to be the only one of the six Australian colonies in a Inch it would be possible to successfully carry on the business of making iron and steel from local raw materials 2 That the establishment of this business absolutely depends now on the acceptance or rejection of federation, and that the people of New South Wales may look at the matter in this plain, [blunt way-no federation, no iron industry may also point out in conclusion, that In addition to supplying the Australian market, there is a large export trade in iron and steel to China, Japan, and a, South America, iVc , of which New South TV Wales could secure a very considerable slice, probably equalling in value and extent the whole of her home demands There is not it is least reason to doubt that New South Wales will be to federated Australia what the State of Pennsylvania has always been to the United States, the centre of industrial prosperity and progress To secure such a desirable end is worth many sacrifices and even if the people of the colony had to pay the fanciful amounts of taxa- tion some of the opponents of federation try to scare them with thinking they are children to be frightened with ghosts it would pay them to do so Pay there ? Yes' Even if federation cost tuena £5 a head in extra taxation, instead of 3s 6d or less
