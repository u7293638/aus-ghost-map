'j:jAM'/&RBBN.T;(r90D'S LECTURE. ;; .As I was not, present at the lecturo recently given. ( by,,. Mr. Janies/, Greenwood,' I cannot 'therefore cbmbat, his 'views except as to. Mr. , Greenwood's description of tlie; personality of Jesus phnstj.-Tas' . a ' remarkable, man full of courage aud, purity, .who spent a noble life in groat work. ; of religious , reform, , like Socrates, of, Athens, wlio 'suffered martyrdom 400 , years, before the Christian age, for the cause of Truth." ; , This ,110 .doubt is a noble eulogy, but short /J/0 reality. Just lot us see .'.what the Prophets said of Him. - Secondly the .testi monies of .Him at His appearance.'. Thirdly, .what the Apostles said of ilini-1- Christ Him self in . prophetic terms appealed to . the Irophets? — ".Behold we go up to Jerusalem ifPa .all, things that are written by ,'the Prophets otineeruing therSbn- of -Mail' shall be acconi- ' phslied." ' '" ' " ' - ,"t He shall be: delivered, uiitol the: Gentiles, r and shall be mocked, and 'spitefully, ; entreated" and. spitted upon, aud they shall- scourge' Him and put 'Him to death, and the third day He; shall rise again.!' -/ > , Moses wrote of Him,. " A Prophet shall the; Lord rise up unto you, of your Brethren, ( like unto -me ;" and lie was to be of Jewish extrac-- tion, to. be a leader of the people, a law giver, &c.;" v ' In the 22-69, 1 118 Psalms to which Christ referred,: we! have in the 22nd, the . very words He uttered on the. cross, " My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me." . , A; most minute description of His sufferings of being pierced, of their casting lots for His garments, of the piercing of His hands and His feet. So we see Him hanging on the Cross hundreds of years before the dire event, and so in the i other Psalms allusion is made to Him. In Isaiah, 53rd chapter, we have a most .minute description of His suffering, His death land burial. Depised and rejected, of men, a man :of . sorrows-":— and in liis- 'death and burial, he made his grave with, the wicked and. with the rich in<his death!;— crucified between two thieves, and - buried in , the new . sepulchre of;NicodemUS.''/ii!l tj:sii/?/ -socr-uq ;:;.?(/ i, -Then .we-liaveithe peculiarity. !of /His/birth/ .

Him as. a special iwon- derful being, tlie desire of. nil nations;: . . , Next lot us see what thu Apostles say,, of Him. They recognised Him as more < than human. Peter in bis. sermon, -.in th'ci face of his i crucifiers,- says;-?
