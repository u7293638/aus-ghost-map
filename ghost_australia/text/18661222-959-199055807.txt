SYDNEY SPORTING NEWS [r!tOSI OUB 0*5 COBBtaPONDKXT.J Our Sydney Ca\t weights not being ont yet, tliere is little enough to interest yon in tho racing world of 2icw South Wales, though from tlie entries for the New Year's Gift and Maiden Plate, I reckon -we Bh.ill ia-re very good Bport on New Year's. Day orer Itdiulwick ; but as for the Christmas races at Pcnrith and Parramatta, both meet ings are spoiled by sticking to'the same days. which 13 a great pity. Nobody will convince me that Tattcrsall's Handicap is not a very bad one, but still most of the horses engaged have been backed for some money though not for much, and it is difficult to fix a first favourite. The weights will be ont for 'The Gift' on Saturday, and those for the Sydney Cup on Thursday, aDd then I ex pect the metalics will go to work in earnest. The big race will be good to get round on, for out of mich a lot of good nags almost all are sure to find friends. At present the Trot is fjuito our ureat card, and I need net tell you it will catue great excitement. Tho Don I have not seen wince his arrival, but I under ntand that he looks well, and people fancy him. The Fool's chance being looked upon much in the same light as Green's was with Hickey on Saturday, By-the-bye I was not aware till I read it in yonr Collins street con temporary that The Fool was an American. I'ew x-eople know, I think, from whence he comes, and I don't think he's wise enough to know his own father. Sir. Hogan ha3 him in tip-top fettle, in fact too full of bearu for my fancy, and I hear that his party are satisfied with the way he has shaped with the sulky. I hoiie to seo a good honest race, and that the best nag may win tho money without any dispute arising about it. Isupposeyou'UgettheSydney Cup Handicap clown by telegram on Friday, and I hope, in common with everybody else on this side the border, that it will not be by a great many Mr. Lackey's last effort Just now the turf of New South Wales can ill spare him.^and it is much to be wished that he will continue to fill the office of handicapper. iMr. Ben Richnrds has undertaken the starting on TattcraaH's day, and after the terrible ex perience of your lat-! metropolitan meeting in this Togard, it is indeed to be hoped that his efforts will be as successful a3 I am sure they trill be genuine and energetic. The race« for the Albert athletic pro gramme, which closed last Saturday, have not drawn so large an entry as I anticipated, but you will see by the handicaps, which I npp^nd to this, that the quality o£ the stuff is tirst-clasx, and that we may look for sport jyro rata. I am glad to see a name or two from your great centre, and hope it will not Jx- long before we have regular intercolonial meetings among our athletes. The names of Higjins, Ferguson, and Aldis are becoming pretty formidable in the running lino; among the ivalkera Hincks is a host in himself ; and by the time we have had another year of Albert Athletic Sports there will bo plenty more new aspirants who will rival the deeds of tlieso already celebrated performers.

Last Saturday's cricket, so far as it could fro called practice for the Intercolonial Match, traH, as all the preparation has been for this season') contest, a perfect misnomer. The Eighteen wcro there, and had their innings, against Home half dozen of tho Eleven, the absentees including some of tho cracks ; and no far tlio selected, team have not once been in the field together. On your side you complain of having no captain, but our misfortune has been having no company for our captain to command. Playing -together is one great Btcp towards winning the game, and our men in this great point are utterly wanting. How this colony will fare under such management the result of next week's engagement only will show, .and as I am not inclined to croak on this subject, I'll leave it alone for tho present. I much regret, however, to lave to s.iy that in 'all probability Nat Thompson will not be ablo to' play. Ho met with an accident some time back, and as he ?lid not pay immediate attention to tho ail ment it has assumed so aggravated a form as to put a stop to his taking nuy violent exertions whatever. How we shall fare for bowlera in his absence, you can as easily imaaino aa I can. Saturday was a great day for sport. First, there was the crcat sculler's match between Green anil Hicltcy, which, to tho astonish ment of many very knowing people, the old champion won, and of which I send you par ticulars ; then there was tho practice match for the eleven picked cricketers; nnd, .be- sides theau, the Metropolitan PigoonShoot ing Club held their quarterly matches at Cook's River. Taking the boat race first, I may tell you that such a con vincer has Felilom been seen. Green bad a splendid boat built for the occasion, and a better has never been launched on theso waters; and moreover, -.ho was in splendid fettle. I should think in his best days' he never was brought litter to tho pout than ? !Tom Day had him now. On the other hand, at was remarked by several persons who had seen Hickey within ft day or two, of tho race, that ho seemed to have had too much of it, or else that ho didn't like it. At all events ha '.v.i3 not to he comparod to his antagonist in pointof condition, and ho ought now to ho convinced that neither he nor nny other man can afford to tako liberties with Dick Green. , All disadvantages: not ?withstanding, tho knowing ones laid 2'u to 1 on Hickey at the start .until they could lay »o more, 'and thought Green was not to have tho ghost of a chance. Starting them selves, both got away on good terms, Hickey, perhaps, enteliing tho water first, but when ihoyhad got into their' work Green established a cloar lead, und went sailing away at a pace ?which noon told Ilickey ho 'Jiad his ?work cut out -for him. Tirao after time he . tried, by dint of gigantic efforts, anil'a series of plucky spurts to oyer ?haul tho veteran, and especially lifter a mile had been' got over, when ho thought Groen would begin to givu out ; but all was of no ttao, for ho'noyor collared his leader, and was beaten in. tho end, by moro than a boat's length. ? '?'..; . Hero you havo tho full scores of tho pigeon matches, nnd I can .'only say that tlie shooting in tho beuond and third classes was a long way from being Al. Tho lirBt-class men shot up to a fair avcrago standard, but tho birds were, most of them, tho worst I' vc soon for liges. . Tho class-prizes havo to bo won twice iu succession, or threo times pro miscuously, and .this timo /-Mr. AVilliams entitled himself to tho second-class money. '. ' .
