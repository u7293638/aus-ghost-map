FROM SOUTH AUSTRALIA TO THE UNITED STATES. [From OU1V Special Correspondent.] [Stage a!.— Philadelphia to JNapanee, ? Ont., Canada. . ; As I found that in Philadelphia living jwas- rrea}ly expensive^ and the Australian ? Courts were not fit for show, I made up : my rninVl to accent an invitation tendered \ me by His Worship the Mayor of Napanee, ! a town situated near Lake Ontario, in I Canada, to have a Tun up to his naunici . palrty and see a little ot Canadian lire. 1 : accordingly leftPhiladelphia on Wednesday, : June 7, at 8 p.m., via the North Pennsyl ; vania, Lehigh valley, and Erie Railway, for ; Niagara, for I had determined iiliat I would not leave America without haying a look at the falls, which are admitted on all : hands to be the finest in the world. During; ; the night we ariived at Bethlehem^1 Waveiiy, and several other towns tsf: mote7 or less importance in. Pennsylvania ' sfnd! found ourselves in the Empire State.- -Th.e( country here looked very different; fr^m' that I had' hitherto passed through.1 ©own South the trees were in full- bloom, 'the' birds ' were heard warbling their1 sweet music on every side, and, in .'fact,' every thing wore a look of sumineri In the North, oil the contrary, every thing was as distinctively spring-like. The trees were yet showing their buds, and the weather was cool, sharp, and brac ing. This was noticeable all the more from the fact that hitherto I had been eating fruits fresh from the trees and plants, while here the fruits were not nearly ripe.' There were no strawberries or other speci mens of summer fruits. The pies, &c;, were all made out of dried or preserved fruits. ' ?.-'.''; We arrived at Buffalo — or rather near Buffalo, as we did not enter the town — about noon, and then proceeded on to Niagara Falls, where we arrived about ' one o'clock, crossing the Suspension Bridge in the train, or I suppose I ought to say ' on the cars,' as I was in America. After getting over the Bridge we were in the dominions of iier urracious Aiajesty i^ueen v ictoria ever more, although no one would have been able to tell the fact. Everything appeared to be as distinctively American as on the other side. From the Suspension Bridge we had a good view of the American Falls, although the Horseshoe Fall was not clearly visible, owing to a turn in the river. Of course I was not satisfied with what I saw from the cars, but went ) on to the scene of wonder, about ; two miles away from the railway depot at Suspension Bridge, on the Cana- ; dian sidfi. These falls are situated on the ; Niagara River, 22£ miles from Lake Erie, and 13£ from Lake Ontario. The river is the outlet of Lakes Winnipeg, . Wimie bago, Superior, Michigan, Huron, St. Clair, and Erie, and drains .over 150,000 square guiles of territory. Two miles and a half above the falls the river is three miles : wide, while at the ' whirlpool,' one mile below, it is. narrowed to 400 feet. The falls are separated into two parts by Goat Island. The portion between the island and the United States shore is called the: American Falls. These are 1,200 feetTvidV and 164 feet high. Between the island and the Canadian shore are the horse-shoe or; Canadian Falls. These have a width 2,400 feet, and a .height of 158 feet/' It is giene rally. believed that these 'falls are in the Dominion of Canada, but such is not the fact. The international boundary line, follows the main channel of the river, and,; -therefore, passes through the centre of 'the ; horse-shoe fall, leaving two-thirds of the great cataract in the United States. The amount of water passing^ over this cataract is incalculable. ProfessorLyell estimates that 90,000,000,000 cubic feet pass over hourly. Occasionally a wind blowing continuously out of lake Erie causes the water to increase in volume, and when the rise is one foot above the falls, it is seventeen and a half feet in the rapids below. These ramds ave -wonders, only second to the cataract itself . In the narrow rdek-cut channel the waters of the jgreat. Lakes are. compressed, and rush with such fury that their centre is ele vated many feet, higher than the sides. It is thought that the. depth of water here ; is about .180 feet, but soundings cannot be ! made with any accuracy.. . ; All around, this ; great central wonder rib ces of interest and curiosities abound. Nature has left strik ing effects ^n j;oc%s and c«a«ms; and history has cast her charmed halo orer these, until every^ road leads to na; novelty, and every U ppot is marked by something to pause at J and remember.

I; wonder. hbw many of those who read these words know what a . Sugar Social is. I was just as ignorant as any of the reapers of the Advertiser, until a few days ago, when I received a polite invita tionto attend one, and which was tobe held a few miles out of Napanee, for the benefit of a lodge of Good Templars. After driv ing for about an hour we arrived at the locus in quo. Here we joined a merry lot of people of all ages and sizes, from the old grandfather and grandmother down to the boys and girls of the household, around the place. We all received a warm welcome, and in a very short time we were completely uthome amongst the young people. Shortly after 8 o'clock the proceedings commenced, a saucer containing a quantity of stuff, lobkingremarkably like treacle, was handed to each, of those present, and I soon saw that we were expected to eat it. It was not long before X made a start at mine, determined to try and do my best to get rut Oi vne mixture aown my Miruau \ju first essaying it I found it was nearly boiling hot, and- the first thing I suc ceeded in doing was to burn my mouth. However, by judiciously waiting for awhile this disadvantage was got rid of. I employed the time during which the contents of my saucer were cooling in. malting enquiries as to their nature, and was informed that the treacly looking stuff was meUed maple sugar, and that it was considered a delicacy in Canada. On attempting it a second time I was agree ably surprised to find that my taste cor responded with that of the good people of Canada. Maple sugar is really very nice, and I enjoyed my first taste of it very much. After getting rid of it I was asked to take ^ome more, but I had come to the conclusion that one saucerful was quite sufficient, as too many sweets are Cloying to the palate, aud I respectfully declined to humor my appetite any further. Half an hour was then devoted to social Intercourse, and I found that about every second inaiyiauai s. was ureroaucea m was named Parkes — in fact the locality is a regular colony of Parkes's. The meeting was then called to order by a brother, who of course rejoiced in the cognomen dis tinguishing so many of those present. There were speeches from Mr. Allen, the Chief Inspector of Police in . Napanee, jlr^W. S. 'Williams Boys, and Mayor of Napanee, Mr. Chisholm, Grand Lecturer of G.I*, of Canada, and your humble ser vant, all of which, were heartily ap plauded. I gave an account of the pro gress of Good Templary in South Aus tralia, and expressed my appreciation of the merits of a 'Sugar Social.' When I stated that I had that evening taken my first taste of Maple Sugar. I noticed that quite a number ol the youngsters present looked perfectly astonished. They could not un derstand it at all. Maple sugar to them is as common as bread, and they evidently thought that I must have lived all my life in some outlandish and barbarous country, When I said however, that I enjoyed it very much, and that when they held another Sugar Social, I hoped they would let me know if I was in the vicinity, the applause was loud and long. I suppose they thought £hat I was past learning the habits of civilization. Altogether the affair was a most enjoyable one, the speeches were all short and. to the point. They were separated from one another by eome very good vocal music, and we parted from one another, with, I believe, mutual regrets. A sugar social was something new to me, and I have no doubt an account of it will be interesting to 'South Australians. ? ^ ? .
