Choosing a Wife. " My son, if you think about taking a wife. You should look for the>o qualities four, That your friendsmay be fond of frequenting y;r house. And y»>ur family thrive evermore. In the first place, bo sure she's a girl of good birth, Let her have, too, spins thousands in hand, Be comely in |»erson and sweet in her face, Well-mannered and quick t'understand. " But if she be Jacking in any of these, Take not such a woman to wiffc ; If you do, you'll be shunned by your friends,, and you will Sit and mope like a ghost all your life."
