The Parnell Banquet. Earl Spencer's presiding at a banquet to Mr. Parnell is possibly not exactly a case of the lion lying down with the lamb, but it shows a change in mutual relations quite as remarkable as would-be fraternisation and mutual civili ties between those widely differing quadrupeds. When Lord Spencer was Viceroy he was the best hated man in Ireland, and the chief organ of the Nationalists denounced him week after week as a murderer, alleging that his refusal to reprieve the men found guilty of the Maamtrasna mas sacre had been persisted in despite his having been supplied with convincing proofs 01 their innocence. The editor. of United Lseland, when publishing the report of the banquet at the Eighty Club, must have regretted the poetical fervor that he or one of his staff displayed a few years ago. Lord Spencer was then described in the poet's corner of the paper as dining in the ghastly society of the ghosts of his victims, instead of with a select circle of Nationalist members. The poet said : And the ghost of the murdered peasant shall stalk by his Side 3. TnaiTV In the festal hall, at the council 'board, \- 'Mid the bristling blades of his hireling- horde, 'With white lips muttering one fearful word, Cain, ever and always Coin. As there was no Banquo-like apparition in the festal hall of the Eighty Club, we conclude that ' the ghost of the murdered peasant ' was all along a bogey got up for political purposes. In view of what has transpired at the Tiiies inquiry no one can assert that Mr. Parifell and his friends would court the patronage of a Tnp.-n they really believed to foe a murderer, even if he happened to be also a convert to their opinions.
