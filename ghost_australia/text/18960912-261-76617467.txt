American Humour. A German one day expressed himself as being somewhat offended because an American gentleman had asserted that his Teutonic countrymen could not, as a rule, appreciate American jokes. " Try one on me !" said he, defiantly, and the American accordingly told him the story of the tree " out west" which was so high that It took two men to see the top. One of them saw as far as lie could, and then the second began to look at the spot where the first stopped seeing. The recitQl did not raise the ghost of a smile upon the German's face, and the other said to him : " Well, you see the Joke is lost on you. You can't appreciate American humour." " Oh, but," said the German, " dafs not humour. Dat's von lie !" .
