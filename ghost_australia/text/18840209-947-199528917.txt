The arrival -of the' Vic .tbrian'coatilfgent, however,, is, sure , to in !faae s'otne life' into the affair. ' Up, to the VJXjU&llU; CiliCZ tJ 11 -W3 UWU. DU(*iUClJ' U- UJ.U -V struck'.' This Queen occupies the position pf faV6uritfii' as will be noticed by the quotations in another column. Owing to ^ae majority of.the.handicaps not having oeen 'declared, there is only the Maiden Plate, Two-Tear-Old. Race, Hobart Cup, and1 Steeplechase to discuss. For the first iilamed' race I fancy Anchorite, notwith standing his inglorious display at Carrick, aa'I'beliove him to be a good horse when Strand -well. I have not heard how he is doing, nor am I certain whether the dark and ?well-'b'red Astronomer, who is engaged in ?the Gup, will strip for this race, but the improving Knave may defeat the pair if 1 ithey: : s&rt.; For the Hobart Cup Linda ias, by her Geelong.win, incurred a penalty ?Vrhich makes her weight 8st. 91b., a burden she will find different from the 7st. 41b. she carried in the Creelong Cup. I am in doubt as to her putting in an appearance as her name is not mentioned in the list ?of horses likely to leave Melbourne by the Flinders/which arrives to-day. Still if she comes, and is strijjped in Tommy Wilson's usual polish, she- is bound to run well. The Joker ought to- cut a good figure,and as the wily Langis goingto bring King of the Vale over, it may ho depended %hat- he ?will; be worth baoking. ? Belle (Brandon T do not fancy,- and Sheet Anchor's -running at Evandale is not (encouraging enough to lead one to have the- slightest fancy for his chance for the Hobart Cup, even though he will have 1st 61b -less weight. If he were fresh and well *he would have a great chance,- but his per formance at Evandale showed that he was 'iriany pounds below j his proper forin. If Signor gets back to the form, ho showed ' on the Memington training track he would have a chance'. Astronomer I know nothing of, ' .but as he- is entered for the Maiden Plate I conclude that he is not a wonder.. Hobart at 6st 121b I have a great partiality for, \- ' ^though I do not consider him thrown in asspme persons assert. All the Panics, however, improve with age, and I fancy -, ihatV.Hpbart will not prove an exception. 5or shaped like a racehorse aa a twoyear old; \aiid, 'though 'short of work, ran well at Cairi-ifc..and ^eloraine, last season,, but he i^d^^ot'lshpyrrimuchhiPorHi'.at' Hobart vor ,'?'? Xaunceaton. In coinmbn '?nrith njaioy 'otherB,,I- fancy' the Queen ;has the best of the (1 handicap, and, this' w.ell-bred mare, who. haSiivon'-.seyeral good races (including ;the Weld Stakes twice, the; Green; Ponds Cupi and,. Brighton Plato), . will, 1 should think, prove tho Siinon Pureof tho Waverloy stable, while Hobart, I imagine; 'w.il'1' be re-i served, for the Australian Cup. Craoknell Will ride whicheverMr. Agnow starts, and I suppose, the selected onp if ho starts both. 1 do not think Granville good , enough; to Idefeat the Queen at a difference of three pounds, and Clarendon, like Shept Anchor, is put of court by his running atiEvandale. Not so Bonnie Scotland, who, if he can last lir miles — and there is no reason why he should not — I consider ? very dnngerous. The great difficulty, ? however, will be to find a.horseman capable of doing him .justice at the weight. , I, think the issue hvill rest with King of the, Va^'e, The, Joker, the selected of Waverloy/ and Bonnie. Scofe-, land,and if the Victorians are.to be beaten I [think the Waverley champion will do the tricki but if tho services of a good light weight can be secured for Bonnie Scotland he may . fight out the finish. Of tho five lengftged in tho Nursery Handicap, I lo.ok to [Marshall Ney, who got badly away at Car-; ^ick, to reverse, places with Goodwood, while 'The Knavo will be handy.- In the Steeple ?'chase I fancy Kanaka, and if he is beaten I ? think it will be by Denmark. . : '-? ( Mr. Grant; as usual, has acted liberally.1, ?in the way of train arrangements, for Hobart Kaces., Return tickets, -\vill bo issued at single fares, from Monday . the -, illth /, until: Pxiday. 15th, and available up to, the 18th.

Keating,, who is a civil and well conducted lad,, was rendered insensible by the fall, and reports we^o, circulated of his death. These, fortunately, ? proved to bo untrue, and tho lad towards; evening had; all but recovered from.. .the, effects of tlio: accident. Peter, .it; will ;be remembered,, steered no: less than four winners, at E,Tan dal,e last week, and, judging by .the change he has effected in' Mr. , Burt'a . horses, he evidently undor^tands something about training, as well' as riding a race. , ,. ? ?The., , weights for , the. i Launceston Cup, Steeplechase, Mowbray Hurdle, and Now, Chum iHandicap will , be declared^ here directly after Hobart Races. . ? The other day I had the .opportunity of visiting the .College .Farm, and was, as usual, hospitably- received by the worthy tenant, Mr. Alex., M'Bain, who, although one: of our!; most celebrated, breeders of draught horses,, also likes a thoroughbred. 1 1 found, the, team; looking: well, despite that the ; weather was not the .best, cal culated to, show a thoroughbred off to ad yantage. Blink Bonny was looking , none the worse for the struggle she. had ,: with West .Coast,', while, B.onnie Scotland, not-, withstanding liis .desperate, enoountor with Meander on the.- same convincing ground,, looked hearty and well.

On -my way. back- I called- at the Moat farm, and Ted Davies kindly showed me Rob 'Roy and Rose. The former is a thorough gentleman,; and. he served to remind me of what a loss the colony, sus tained by the death of that much neglected Biro Castle Hill, on whose .behalf I was always willing to hold a brief. Rob Roy, it will be remembered, effected a sur prise at Carrick in the Maiden Plate, when with barely four weeks' training he came like a shot out of a gun and passed his opponents a3 if they were standing still. Rob Roy is both a good-looking and well shaped horse, and is beautifully let down hehind. The son of Castle Hill is in. good heart, and I think Davies will win a race or two with him before the season closes if he does not overdo him. That factious mare Rose looked well considering the time she has been in training, but was not in the condition that Rob Hoy was. A race meeting iB to be held at Stanley on March 17. There are six events, all of which, excepting the Maiden Plate , and Two-year-old Stakes,' are open to all horses. ' The amount of added money is not stated. The nominations close in March. I regret to stato the longest races are the Hurdle Race, 1£ - mile, and, the Highfield Handicap, 1£ mile. On the first day of the Calcutta Meeting Nulquine,'asonof Lapidist, won the Trial Stakes, defeating Queen and others. Gudarz, the son of Yattendon and Luna, and who ran third to Assyrian and Stock well for the Melbourne Cup, was, however, the hero of the meeting, as on the first day he ran second to Transferred, another Aus tralian; for the Trial Stakes.' On the se cond: day, carrying Ost. 91b, he won the Dharbanga Cup, with Loyola' (lato Cam ballo) second, and Nulquino third. Gudarz won easily, and did, the distance,' 1 mile 6 furlongs |132 yards^ in1 3 /min.' 19. sec. Belladrum and Ween ' yretb the, other starters. .1Oij.;the,fourth'idaj ?

He carried off the Sandown Park Stakes by a head after a fine race. , Old, Pahnpr kton, ,,who .now inuBt have won a great inany races in India, still showed ho is a hard , nut to, crack by defeating Trans ferred, Nulquino, Caspian, and Queens land for the Burdwan Cup.

It is very evident, therefore, that it pays far better to breed horses in the ' old country than in Australia. The highest ' priced yearling waa Goldsmith, a colt by Hermit out of Crucible, 2500gs. . The lowest priced yearling was by Craig Millar, which .'only brought 5gs ! ?????, ?.??;( -,-. , ,,:;/ The , best performer Musket, left; ,in England, the game Petronel (winner of the Two Thousand Guinea Stakes and other races), has, I noticed, concluded his racing career, and will stand with the Irish . sire^ Ben Battle, at Badminton. ? The following horses were struck out of the Australian Cup yesterday :— Nicholas/ G-rosvenor, Santa Clausj Calnia, , Pollio, Warwick, and Archie. On Monday List 36 horses had been left in the Australian Cup and 64 in the Newmarket Handicap. . A few important moves were made in the betting market on Monday (says the lead ing Melbourne journal) in connection witn segennoci ana uountryman lor the Newinai-ket Handicap. Both colts were steadily backed during last week to win some thousands, and on Monday the sup port was so genuine that at last 100 to 9 was the best offer against either. Bar the two named 100 to 5 was offered any other. Precious Stone, after his Greelong successes, was sure to'be inquired after, and his name was written to some tune at 100 to 4. Coolabah was also supported at the same figure, and he then, remained at 100 to 5. Claptrap was backed at 100 to '4. For the Australian Cup not a single blow has as yet been struck, and 10 to 1 ;is 'offered 'on the jfield./ There is very' little 'doing ,pn~ the* iChampion, Stakes, 6 to 4 being ,tho Vniost liberal j offer against Mar tirii-Heriry,' with fakers, at 7 to, 4.i Commotion's price is 3, to p.. offered, and 100 to 30 wanted, whilst 5 to 2 is the rate bar tho two favourites. For the Newmarket Handicap and Australian 'Cup, double event prices range frorii 1000 jto a to 1000 to 10. - , j : The , stewards of tho English Jockey Club . are determined to exercise a strict supervision over jockeys. . Thoy have given notice that for the future lisencoswill only. be granted to jockeys on condition that-, jthoy are not owners or part owners of any Tacehorse. Leave may be given, on'spdcial application, to jockeys to own one or niore horaes. but this permission will only, bo ?granted when the jockey is also a, trainer, and the horse is to bo trained in his own Btable. It having been represented to the-, .stewards ,pf the. Jockey Club that many jockeys are in the habit of betting largely 'oh: horse-racing, the stewards hereby, give notice that' such practices .will not -be -tol- erated in future, and that any. jockey who maybe reported I to them .for this offence, and who. may be proved, to the satisfaction jof $he stewards, to have become ongagedin (betting transactions, will.be liable to have his license, at once ^withdrawn.. -. Oyer ?trainers the Jockey Club seem determined !to -exercise a similv-v supervision. They have ,'grarited all appliciltions to train hprf)e& on. the club lands at Newniarkei; with the '.ex- ceptiori of those of Charles Arclier,. who,' Ys ropbrted to. ,be: in the ? habit, of 'betting - uargely, -and, ',-T. , Brown, ^rcher's. license! - | they have declined to rj3ne-v, while iBrpwn'Sf 4s . ordered 'to- stand over for future ebn-f Isideration. .,:,..''

To this iihey add '^200,. and -Mr,., ?Wilfred,- Blunt, , ai great admirer' ; ? of ' ,tlio ? - Aiabj and ? ^ho has a fine stud .'? of-' .this , hreed , . ? of hprses;, supplements , the addled money ?Hrith ,', ^SIOO. ... ? Therei , is_ some diveriBity. 'of } opinion about tlio race.' The Field says :pr-. ' It is .difficult to, imagine, why,, the Jockey Club ? should encourage such retrograde: breeding as the re-infuBion . of Arab blopdi into the pedigrees of, our, racehorses. ( 'For' : generations the ; Arab .blood jh'as been bred ; put to the constantly: increasing ? benefit, and now. we are breeding back, toother element that aii experience shows, wp. can, better do without... In the desarts y-f Arabia this breed may be all that we have been taught to believe him from the nur sery onwards, but experience deprives the Arabian horse i of many of his.bcpraised characteristics, and we begin to look upon him as a very inferior class to our English racehorse. . So inferior, indeed, that were the best Arab in existence brought over to, this country to run against Corrie Roy or Barcaldine, the Arab to carry 6st and the English horse 12st, the odds in favour, i of our own horse winning would bo incal- ; pulable; .and yet the Jockey Club indi--, rectly tells us that this is the blood that; we should infuse into qut studs.' In the conditions of the race it states ,that the; stewards of the Jockey Club will; consider, as Arab all horses sent from India which/ have won a public race value 1000 rupees,, It was, stated at the time: that .these; Arabians were admitted to, the Stud Bppk at the request of the Jockey Club. How,' then, can they, refuse to admit Activity,: the winner of the Liverpool Cup. and other^ good races, and incalculably superior as a racehorse to the best Arab ever, foaled.' Considering there are so.few stayers on the English turf now some change; is, needed, but I; agree with the Field that it is questionable whether .Arab, sires will effect :the reform needed. The_ chief .cause of; the decadence of .the English thoroughbred is there are so many short distance races, and therefore stout and staying horses are not nearly so ' numerous as they were a few years, back. Notwith standing-vigorous protests we are slowly but surely darfting into a 'similar state of things. .The distance of race is. being in siduously reduced arid weights: for races, ablished. .- ' -.
