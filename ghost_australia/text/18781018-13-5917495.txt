CONGREGATIONAL UNION. "Wednesday, Oct. 16. The Rev Jos King (chairman elect) took the chair at 3 o clock The usual devotional exercises were engaged in, after which the report of the editor of the Year Bool was brought up and adopted STATE SCHOOL EDUCATION The Rev S C Kehi rose to move the fol- lowing resolution -"That, in the pre sent state of feeling m relation to publie education, this council thinks it deair able to express its satisfaction with the existing Education Act It Btrongly depre cates the endowment of any religious denomination for educational purposes, as a step backw ard towards the old denominational sy stem At the same time, it believes it to be advisable, for the sake of those who wish their children to receive religious instruction out of school hours and those who aro anxious to impart it, that the act should be interpreted m the generous spirit in which it was originally conceived ' He sa'd, as Congregationahsts, they had n history m connexion with the cause of civil and religious liberty, and they were Bcarcely justified in quietly looking on whilst a movement was on foot for the alteration of the Education Act without f,iv ing expression to their opinion They must have observed that three denomina tiona of Protestants were engaged in an agitation which had for its object the intro duction of religioua instruction nito the state schools \\\ ith this object m v lew a meeting was held last week, at which Dr Moorhouse read a paper T he view s enunciated in that paper were supported by the Rev J C Symons, a Wesley an minister, and Mr Robert Harper, as the representative of the Presbyterians They must know, too, that an organiaed attempt was being made by the Roman Catholics to obtain an alteration of the Education Act as it now standa Thus, they had the representatives of four of the largest religious denominations working totether, and it behoved them, therefore, to take action if they did not w ish to see the Education Act destroyed As Congregationahata they ad mittcd feeling some dissatisfaction with the working of the act, but not with the act itself When the act was passed they accepted it as a compromise, and the bcBt that could be de v ised, and they regarded it m the same h-ht now Now, in order to convert the state schools into religious schools, it vv as proposed to give o separate grant for educational pur poses to the Roman Catholics This proposal, as they were aware, rame from Bishop Moor house, and if it were adopted, others whose claims were equally strong with those of the Roman Catholics, would ask for the same, and then they would come back to the old de nominational system (near, hear ) He de sired that the r»solution should be imam mously passed, in order that some weight might be attached to it outside For his part he should very strongly deprecate the awarding of a grant to any religioua de nomination for any purpose whatsoever (ApplauBe ) The Rev J Walker, of Ballarat, seconded the resolution In regard to the first two parta of it, he believed there waa no difference of opinion Aa a bod}, they were heartily satisfied with the present systein of education With regard to the third part, ho could quite conceive that many of the objection3 to the present Ldnca tion Act had ariacn mainly from the narrow spirit ni which the act was interpreted, and tho hostile spirit in which it waa administer«! It waa never in- tended by the authors of tho act that re bgioUB matruction ahould bo altogether ex eluded , on the contrary, tho fact of aecular instruction only being prov ided by tho state waa advanced as au argument why the re ligious bodiea should exert theinaelves to Biipply the religions instruction required Speaking, however, from Ina own experience in Bollarat, he must sa} that every attempt on the part of the rehgioua denominations to supply the want which they all felt, was per severmgly frustrated nia opinion was that there waa something behind the achool board to account for tina A ahort time ago, a school board election took place in Ballarat, when all the Protestant ministers, with one exception, united with the view of securing the return of members who were favourable to religious instruction, but they were not successful When the election took place the Roman Catholic paper odviBed ita rcadera to vote ogoinat religious instruction of any kind being given in the atate schoola, and he believed he knew the reaaon of this was that it was desired to bring the state school system into disrepute He contended that if the net had been ad ministered in a generoua apint, there would have been no grievance to complain of anywhere As an illustration of the hostile spirit in which the net was being administered in regard to religion, he need only point out that the use of the Bflinnl Juiililino-n fnr rílminilo-JCiatcuatinr although they were freely granted for any other purposes, such as lulls, concerts BoirecB, kc He hoped the council would give forth no uncertain Bound in respect to the act, which was, he thought, the grandest and beat that had ever been paaaed (Ap plause ) The Rev A Gosman said he waa aome vv hat disappointed with the resolution-(hear hear)-because the very point on which it vi as most important to say something was ignored That point was how to reach the neglected children. With regard to the first part of the resolution, he need not say more than that as a body he thought they were nil tolerably favourable to the present act (Hear, hear ) With regard to the second part of the reaolution, he quite concuired in the view that they should look with great disfavour on any proposal which would result in breaking up into denominationahsm, but at the same time they could not loae Bight of the fact that the hopea they had formerly cherished of being able to carry on a ay stem of rehgioua matruction in conjunction with the atate schools had been diaappomted, and they had now to face a difficulty which they had never contemplated when the act waa posaed They had been refused the use of the scliool buildings, which were freely granted for dancing partiea, i.c , and the Minister of Education waa apparently deter- mined not to grant any facihtiea to muna tera of religion for giving religious instruc- tion What, he asked, was their experience of the experiment that had been tried of supply ing rehgioua matruction out of school hours' With one or two exceptions the attempt had signally failed In the first place they could not get any considerable number of children together either before or after Behool hours, ana in the second place munstera aa a rule were not adapted for the work of teaching Ifamimatot did Ina onn work ev en in a country district it was enough for him to do, but even if he had the time to viBittheschoolshewouldnotbeabletoexerciae the same control over the acholara as the regular teachera.and his efforts therefore would not be likely to succeed ne would suggest that the reaolution should contain a clause lamenting that the attempt to aupply a want which they all felt had failed, and aakiug Ministers to seriously consider whether it would not be possible to import into the Education Act tho voluntary principle by which rehgioua matruction could be supplied in state schools somewhat in the same manner ns in industrial scliools He did not see any difficulty in this being done by an arrangement among tho ministers It appeared to lum that the interpreto tion of the secular principle of tho act had been carried to an absurd and ridtculouä extreme, and the reault or it was that all their hopes had failed of being ablo to supplement the instruction imparted m state schoola He concluded by expreaainga hope that the reaolution would bo amended, orbe Bhould be compelled to vote against it Mr Tuos TiiORrt rose to mov e the follow- ing amendment -"That tina council ia of opinion that the fear of the Lord l8 the begin- ning or principal part of both knowledge and wisdom, that therefore it is imperative that religious matruction should be imparted to all children attending the schoola ofthe state vvboBe parents are not averse to the same, if w e are to be a moral people, that owing to the inadequacy of Sunday schools, the pre- occupation of the time of ministers of reli- gion, and the indifference or opposition of boards of advico, this can only be effectually done m the day schools by the ordinary teachers, and therefore this council expreases ita hearty approval of the movement recently initiated m tina direction by Dr Moorhouae, the Anglican Biahop of Melbourne, and will cordially join with all the Proteatant bodiea in the preparation of a common religious manual, and in the attempt to obtain its introduction into the state Bchools " He said he had no idea that his amendment would meet with the cordial support of tho council, but, nevertheless, he felt it incumbent on him to discharge bia conscience of a burden which for some time post had weighed heavily on him He had not asked any one to second the amendment, but he hoped some one would be generous enough to undertake the duty, if only for the purpoao of en- abling it to be discussed. The mover of 'die resolution had brought forward no reasons why it should be carried ex- cept that he objected to the endowment of any religious body. It seemed to him (Mr. Thorpe), however, that there was a great confusion of ideas in the minds of some people aa '/> what constituted an endowment They spolie of a religious endowment and an educational endowment as one and the same thing, whereas there was an essential differ- ence between them. Why, he asked, should they not endow the Roman Catholics for educational purposes' There would bo no infringement of their own liberty in so dome As Congregationahsts they had confessed that under the present B)Btem they could not give moral and religious instruction and this appeared to him a fatal and glaring defect in the present Education Act Reference had been mode to the action being taken by other Protestant denominations and he thought it as well they should remember that the Con gregationahata were a small and compara tively insignificant body If then the other great religions bodies aureed on a common text book, the Congregationahsts would ap pear a very peculiar people indeed if they alone stood out The Rev V Greenwood (rmerald hill) bo conded the amendment He said he believed they were all anxious to do one great work, vii,, to instruct the children not only in secular but religious knowledge He agreed with the first and second parta of the résolu tion moved by Mr Kent but the third part was, he thought, inconsistent with the arguments that liad been advanced m support of it. Thero was an admission of something wrong m our educational sys tem, and the question to be considered was how this was to be remedied It was also admitted that the ministers could not system atically visit the state schools for the purpose of giving religious instruction, and even if they could do so, the school rooms were not adapted for the purpose It, moreover re quired men specially trained for the purpose to teach children, and winch ministers as a rule were not The next question was were ministers prepared to go into the schools' He had tried it lnmBelf and found one hour s teaching more exhaustive work than preach ing a sermon It was no use talking about a liberal înternretatiou of the act unless mmiaters themselves were prepared to carry it out A great outcry had been raised against any alteration of the Lducation Act He did not know that anyone wanted to alter it, but if it proved defective there was urely no reason why it Bhould not benn prov ed (A Voice -' ' An improvement would be an alteration ) What Dr Moorhouse had asked was that tho religious and moral lessons Bhould be replaced in the text books s they were before the act was passed, aud that the Bible should be brought in the schools They were surely wise enough to teach thiB book without raising questions of dogma AMiat was wanted was that the ?;reat facts of Scnpturo hiBtory and the essons of moral teaching Bhould be laid before the children The fact had been drawn attention to by Dr Moorhouse that there were 100,000 more children m the stite schools, than in the Sunday schools and there was too much reason to fear that these children were receiving no moral or religious training of any kind If any one could tell him how those children were to be overtaken with any kind of religious instruction without imparting it in the schools he would go with the» resolution, but if not he should support the amendment It was no use talking about the Roman Catholic endowment rutting the matter plainly, the giving them a grant for Becular instruction on the certificate of a Government inspector was not an endowment of the Roman Catholics at all The Roman Catholic numbered about one fourth of the population, and they paid their share of the taxes, and as they could not conscientiously accept the education provided for them b) the state it was proposed lo give them an equivalent for it m money, in proportion to their numbera, out of the sum they paid m taxes for the support of the present s) stem Mr Fentov expreased himaelf greatly aur prised at the views expressed by the two preceding speakers In respect to this ques tion of teaching the Biljie in school it appeared to him that they had just as much right to take the mone) of those who believed in the Bible to p ly for teaching the prm ciples of Tom Paine and Voltaire as they had to take the money of the be hevers in Tom Paine to teach the Bible He believed the result of teaching the Bible in schools was not satiafactor), and he very much doubted whether the state school teachers were the proper men to teach reli gion Some of them had recently been sent to prison for offences which could not be ev en mentioned in that assembly, and others might not themselves be believers in the Bible He went with t^io first part of the i resolution, and though he believed the pre 1 Bent Government wero the cause of the pre sent widesproad commercial depression and misery, if the Berry Gov ernment wero going to Btand by secular education, he would sink every other consideration and do Ins beat to keep that Government in power Refer ence had been made to the influence j of the Weale) ans and Methodists, but it was notor 0U8 that those bodies had alway s been weak kneed m politics (Laughter ) Small as the Congregationahsts w ere m number he believed tb« _Gôrs'}î?ed more political m the Anglicans, Presbyte^A'Vésléyañs, and Methodists combined He behev ed the Berry Government knew tina, and had not taken a leap in the dark in standing by the secularists The Rev D Meadow croft said be thought that all that was desired by the amendment was airead} embodied in the act, and if it were carried out it would supply all that was required "\V hen he waa in Western Australia Bishop Hale made a similar proposition to Dr Moorhouse a, but he could not carry it out They had been told by the mover of the amendment that the fear of the Lord was the beginning of wisdom, but the fear of the Lord was already inculcated m the school text books and in aupport of Ina osaertion he quoted extracta from the Royal Readers U8ed m the atato achoola, in which the over ruling providence of God ia spoken of as ex empbfied in the works of nature The Rev JiiO Legge MA., proposed to add to the resolution the following words - ' And that facilities greater than those at present accorded be given for such voluntary moral and religious instruction as the religious denominations may undertake to aupply He aoid he woa aware of the fact that there were Boroo beautiful Bentimenta and principles of natural religion to be found in the state Behool books but he waa told that many of the teachera had been forbidden to teach these lessons It appeared to lum that the present 8} stem had failed to give something which they felt they wanted, and it became them to look out for a remedy As Congregationahsts they all rejoiced m the national character of the atate Bchools but lhey might consider whether thero was no safo pasBuge to be found between the Scylla ana Charybdis of sectarianism and secularism pure and aimple Winle they w ould do nothing to nak a return to de nominationaham they felt that in restricting education to secular subjects they might be creating a dongeroua type of man What they wanted was to'get the act bo administered that there should be a possibility of all de nominations, Catholics included, giving re bgiouB înstructiona m the achoola Ho could not bhnd himself to the fact, and he thought they should not try to do so, that a atrong feeling woa growing up which, unless some Bofety valve were found for it, would some day tosa the Education Act to the winda (Hear, hear ) lhey could not ignore thia feeling, nor should they stem it, but they mifeht guide it, and with this view ho would sutgeat that the chairman and aomo other membera of the union be oppointed a com mittee with matructions to open up commu nication with Dr Moorhouse and the heads of other religious denominations on the sub jeet of religious inatruction in schools (AppluuBe ) The Rev S C Kent said he was willing to accept the addition, and the words were accordingly added At the suggestion of several members of the council who desired to speak on the sub ject the debate w as adjourned till 3 o clock next day The council then adjourned for refresh ment After the adjournment tho Rev Thomas | Jones took the chair SUNDAY SCHOOLS Mr H T Neal addressed the council on the report of the Sunday school Committee, which was brought up the previous evening He expressed great regret that only a small portion of the returns aaked for had been sent in, and the result of this was that a statement had appeared m one of the daily papers representing that the number of their Sunday schools was 24, and the number of scholars 2 400 The error was one for which the preBS was not to blame, but those who neglected to send in the returns when they were asked for He should be sorry, how ever, if such a statement should pass un corrected He thought it was not necessary for anyone to seek to justify theexiBtenceof Sunday schools, but it was incumbent on the churches mdividuaUy and collectively to recognise the necessity of bending their beat energies to make them more successful They Bhould apply themselves to obtain more children m the schools, and better teachers He thought they should not rest satisfied till their Sunday school system was at least on a par with that of the United States In moving for the appointment of a sub-committee he apprehended that some of the country members would tell them something of the difficulties they had to encounter m Sunday school work, while the town members would perhaps be able to afford them some encouragement and offer suggestions as to the best way of sur- mounting these difficulties Ho wonld then invite them to consider by what means they could so advance the Sunday schools as to make them what they ought to be-the nur senes of the church (Applause ) The Rev. S C Kent informed the meeting that the number of Sunday Bchools in con- nexion with the Congregational Church was 55, not 24, as erroneously reported, and the number of scholars was 0,013 The Revs. J. Bryant, W. H. Lawrence, E. Greenwood, Jos King, and Mr N. Beatty furnished the meeting with some interesting particulars of Sunday school work in their respective districts, after which the follow- ing resolution was earned, on the motion of Mr H. F. Neal, seconded by the Rev. J. Bryant - "That the report be adopted, and the following gentlemen appointed the com- mittee for the ensuing year - Revs. S. C. Kent, E. Greenwood, A. Gosman, J. J. H alley, and Messrs. W. F. Walker, Geo. Bell, J. Pitts, Robert Gladstones, and the mover " CONGREGATIONALISM The Rev. A. Gosman delivered an address on "Congregationalism: our duty in the colony, and how we may best extend our work." Several other ministers and laymen ex- pressed their views on the subject, and after passing votes of thanks to the Rev. E. Green- wood for his services as chairman during the past year, and to the officers of the commit- tee, the council adjourned at a few minutes after 10 till 3 o'clock next day. THURSDAY Oct 17 The Rev Thoa Jones took the chair at 3 0 clock The proceedings were commenced with the usual devotional exerciees executive committel The Rev J J Hai ley announced that the ballot taken the prev lous day for the election of membera of the committee had resulted in the election of the following -Ministers Rev Thoa Jones Rev E Greenwood Rev S C Kent Rev R Connebee, Rev L Dvy, Rev A Goswan, Rev W II Laurence Rev D Meadow croft and Rev & I Green Lay- men-Messrs E P Newcombe, W Bates 1 W "Walker T II Thwaites II I Neal. 1 Luke sen, J Port, Welstced, and Barlow STA1E SCIIOOr EDUCATIOV-ADJOURNED DFBATr The Rev J J Hallev resumed the debato He said he had never before with so much sorrow atood up to open a debate He vv as never so much astonished in his life as when he heard the amendment moved by Mr Thorpe the previoiiB afternoon but ho bud to lay in an extra Btock of astonishment when he heard the amendment seconded by Mr Greenwood It Bccmcd to him that on the present occasion they had not to diacuaB the education queation. but to affirm the prm cipleB on which their denomination acted The amendment said as plainly as worda could say it that what they were asking for waa a Btate endowed rehfeion in their schools AMiat difierence ho asked them waa there between aupi orting a state church and a S}stem of Btate endowed re ligious education ' As a body they had al« a} s entered a protest against state aid to rehyon in any form and were they now to turn their bocks afcainst all their f,lonous histor}? i\ ere the} now to baulah all those glonoua memories of the past and onl} to let them come bael like grim ghosts of for cotten greatness stalking m their midst' (ApplauBe ) Hie amendment invited them now to consider how they could establish re lifeions education in the state schools W is it not he asked, a disgrace to them that they should be told that their Sunday schools had failed and that the only «ay of educating the j oung w us b} asking the state to do 11 for them (Applause) Hie iroposal embodied in the amendment was diametncall} opposed to the first ] rmciples of their denomination and if it were corned their raison délie would be gone They might as well then clothe themselves in the garments of penance, and go in a body to the Archbishop of Melbourne, and entreat him to take them under his wing They Bhould tell lum that the free air of independency was too strong for them He would ask those who might be called the Paula of the Assembly to reject the amendment with Bcorn He implored them by all the love he bore to them and to independent principles not to betray them by passing it, or by giving it any countenance To give a grant for educational purposes to the RomanCatholics simplymeant an endow- ment of £20,000 or £25,000 to a religion which they believed to be bad-which brought up bad citizens, and was detrimental to tho beat interests of the colony. (Applause) Mr Strongman said, in his opinion, tho subject they were considering was one of the greatest importance, and one on which it was incumbent on every one of them to speak clearly. He was sorry to hear the amend- ment proposed, cicept that it gave them greater scope for discussion Hf believed every true Independent would support the resolution, and thus no true Independent Í87O, nndin 1872 the free, secular, and com- pulsory Education Act was passed On both occasions the same principle was affirmed, that there should be no state aid to religion, citherforadultB or for children Hedidnotsee thattherewaa any differencebetween providing religious services for adults and religious in- struction for children. If the Sunday schoola were not efficient, the onus lay upon them of making them so The state had nothine to do with religious convictions, and whenever the state interfered with religion it made a miBtake. In tins country they had no state church, and they could not consistently cry out for religious education in state schools He was rather at a losa to understand that portion of the resolution which referred to the Education Act being interpreted in a generoua apirit Was the interpretation to be that of the school boards or that of tho Minister of Education ' If tho interpretation of the Minister of Education meant the ex- clusion of ministers of religion, he thought they should get a clause inserted to enable the ministers to go into the schools, and he was pleased with Mr Legge's addition, because aa a denomination they wero fully alive to the importance of religious educa- tion The Rev S C Kent said, with reference to the interpretation of the act, he only wished to iemark that he had alwajs under- stood that four hours were to be devoted to secular instruction, and that religious in Btmction waB to bo allowed out of school hours Mr Small said, as a layman and a Non conformist, lie wished to lift up Ina voice ngamBt religious instruction being introduced into state schools He thought they had done violence to their principles as Congregation alista in accepting state education in any shape, and if they w ere all Congregationahsts there would be no need of a state syatem It waa the parenta duty to educate their chil dren, but they were driven by necessity to odopt a uniform system This, however, was no reaBOn why they, aa a denomination, should not proude voluntary teachers for giving religious matruction to the children under their care, and he believed they were quite prepared to do so He trusted the re Bolution would be carried by a large majority Mr GiiisT said he felt an intense intoreat m education, and aa he had lived for aomo y ears m Ontario, where they had the best system of any m the world, he should like to say a few words on the subject In Amenca, the free, secular, and compulsory bj stem was establishedineverystate Therewas however, a difference m the administration In America every city or towoi was practically supreme 1 he local authorities had pow er to levy taxes, appoint teachera, and erect the buildings There was, it was true, a Ministei of Educa tion, but he had no actual control, and ho believed they would have to como to this here He believed that what was wanted to make the act work smoothly was decen trahsation, but ho must confess he did not as yet full) understand our system (The Chair man- Nobody does ) He understood that we had free, secular, and compulsory educa tion, but notwithstanding this ho must tell them we were 25 years behind Ontario We should not, however, sacrifice what wo had got and he asked Mr Thorpe by the memories of hiB Puritan forefathers to with- draw his amendment, if not, he hoped not a Bingle hand would be held up for it The Rev A Gosman asked what provi- sion was made for religioua instruction m schools Mr GniST saul, m aomo of the schools a chapter of the Bible was read and a hymn sung, but m others there was nothing of the kind The Rev Thomas James said if this had been a purely church question he should not have ventured to Bpeak on it, as his position in the church was a tentative one, and to some extent an experiment This, however, was not a purely religious question, but one of public policy He did not share in the enormouB surpnso that bad been expressed by previous speakers that such an amondment as had been proposed bad been brought even before that council He apprehended that the primary view in the minds of Mr Thorpe and Mr Greenwood was that the children should be taught the word of God. and he heartily sympathised with the motives, though not with the tenor of the amendment He observed that ad caplandum appeals had been nude m the council m reference to the ethics of independency which led him to remind them that the intolerance of liberty involved a negation of liberty He did not think they should so <ise their liberty as to the detriment of those who ventured to express opinions that did not exactly accord with their own He believed a large majority of the council wonld be with Mr. Kent a motion, but he would counsel the majority touBe their strength with moderation tor himself he came to the conclusion seven years ago that nothing was practicable m this colony but a free, secular, and compulsory BjBtcm, and he should therefore support the resolution The Rev Mr Price, of Geelong, said no one had fought harder than bia father for tha pnnciplea of independency, and ho would never allow priest, parBon, or presbyter to enter the state school T he Government had established a system of education, secular, compulsory, und free He did not quite agree with tho free ayBtem, but he supposed it waa adopted as the only way of thwarting tha Roman Catholics (Hear, hear ) He thought they should set their faces aa a flint against the Jesuitical and insidious attempt to 'o, introduce denommatioiioliBm into the schons. Dr Moorhouse had not been hero long enough to hav e a thorough knowledge of this question, or he w ould nev cr have proposed if There viere wiser men than Dr Moor house on the Roman Catholic aide, and ho (Mr Price) waB ButiBficd they were only hiding their time, and were simply using Dr. Moorhouse na a catspaw The Rev Jab King said he should vote heartity for the resolution, and he thought it would be a disgrace to the council if tha amendment were carried, or even supported. The present Education Act in hiB opinion, admitted of reh"iouB instruction being given, provided the denominations «ere prepared to supply it Mr Radbury said he was one who «as brought up in the Church of 1 noland, but when he became of agc he was «me enough to abandon it for Congregationalism He Bhould like to see the resolution cut in two, and the latter part dropped as he did not see the necessity for ministers of religion to go into the state schools when they had the churches and Sundaj schools, where they could assemble the children nt any time they hlicd ( No ) The Rev J M Stiiongmav said he should support the resolution The Rev S C Kent haid he was nmto willing to waive anj nuit of reply, but ho wished to make an earnest appeal to tho mover and seconder of the amendment to withdraw it He hod no doubt that Mr Thorpe and Mr Greenwood were actuated by the highest and purest motives lhey had an intense desire that the rising generation should be instructed in religious truths but they must see that their Mc« h could not bo carried into effect vi ithout lu in" m their ad« hesion to that which would prove injurions in the long run Culls vv ere here made for Mr '1 horr e, and some discussion took place na to whether Mr. Thorpe was entitled to replj Mr Ilalloy re- marked that if Mr Hiorpe «ere allowed to replj, he should donn the n"tit to reib to him The Chairman put the proposition that Mr 'J horpe be heard, which was cirned Ml Thoiuf said the) need not entertain any apprehension that he w as going to my an)thing which would require a reply lia simply wished to c\p'mi some points on vi Inch he had been misunderstood , and a? it appeared to lum that nothing but what nig Puritan and Congregational would f,o do vit ni that council, he would read to them an extract from the firit of n new seneaof Congregation ii lectures by Profesor Andre«, bearing upon this question of the introduc- tion of the Bible into the = ho 1- He then read sonic extracts in which the opinion of Professor Huxley was quoted on the value o£ tho Bible as a textbook He sud lie be- lieved all the schemes tint lind been pro posed for giving reh iona instruction out o£ Behool hours would fail In regard to vint had been said against his amendment it nppenrcd to lum that he h id notliin-, to reply to, as no arguments had bem adduced. lhere were, however, such words in the Lnglish language as fustian, bom nat, rhoclo« montado, and claptrap and these formed tho main ingredients of the speeches that had been made against lum Mr G wen wood facetious!) remarked that he thought the council ought to pass a vote of thanks to Mr Thorpe mci himself ¡or affording them the opportunit) of having a good honest talk on the education question. (Laughter, and cries of " Withdraw tha amendment ) Tor his part, he was quita willing to withdraw, and let the resolution aB added to, with the consent of tho mover and seconder, go forth as tho unanimous voice of the meeting He hoi ed Mr 'thorpe would also withdraw The Chairman and several members of tho council joined in requesting Mr Thorpe to withdraw his amendment Mr Thobpe at first declined to withdraw, but he at length consented to do so in defer« ence to the wishes of the chairman The resolution was then put and carried jiem con The Rev J>o Legce then moved, and the Rev Jos Kee seconded, ti e following *-e«o lution -"That the secretar) of tho Union Te-o iciiucolcd tu cuiuuiumcnta Hlth tho heads of religious denominations, Catholic and Pro- testant, for the purpose of ascertaining whether a conference can be held to consider the present relations of religious instruction and the Education Act " The Rev A Gosman suggested that it would be better to remit the question to tha Executive Committee, and it should be understood that the voluntary principie Should form the baais of the negotiations Mr Legge accepted the sugestión, and the resolution was ultimately carried m this form -"That this council instructs tha Executive Committee to communicate with tho heads of the various religious denomina« tiona for the purpose of ascertaining whether a conference can be held to consider the hegt way of convey mg v oluntary religious instruc« tion in state schools ' This concluded the business of the sessioiii and the council accordingly adjourned PUBLIC MEETING A public tea meeting of the friends of tha union and mission was held lost evening ni the Independent Hall, Colima street, and was followed by a public meeting in the church, which w as largely attended Mr W T WolkeC Ëresided, and delivered the opening address, fe commenced by remarking that the Con'« gregationahsts aa a body liad never had a more trying year than the past one, nut nevertheleas they had some cause for Lratili« cation with their position o id prospecte.
