@#t-£ and J?Mfks. MISS MAY. It ns an afternoon ia We Febnory, and Tom Kingsley was lounging in the bay window of ths little Eitt2Bg-room, his Latin and Greek books all around him, and, what was worse, a bioad enow-covered nfll in front of him, don whkb sled after sded ns gliding with tie mott *-nfal.»mg rapidity. Tom was twenty and devoted to learning. b«t he was not above a good coast when the chaooe presented itself. OccasianaUy he £aroored his aster, who was the only other ocfflpact of the room, with very audihLe *wn^lintTR igajnst the EestnctiouB of Btady \- The two irere stadents in the academy whose mattipmaiii-ally squire bmMiags rose almost opposite to tfce EingsUy house. They vereTneariy of an age ; bot the one vafr pre~ paring to enter college ; the education of the other was considered nearly completed. The two young people, with their father and mother, nude up the whole family ; bat Mr. Kinpsley, in fch*» si in pip unpretending way of the village, received into bis boose as a, boarder one of tiie academic professors and also occasional students when they hap penad to be friends of the d&drai-; It was I this first-named individual who was exciting ' Tom's attention, in lack of anything better to lookat. '*MayT' he said, jerking his bead over friw shoulder with a Quiet, fh^rsMrtprisiH? move* neat, 'jnst come, here and see Professor ?Braselgoby.' Hit? sister dropped her work and came to the window-.. On the other ade of the I street ettod a tall, ungainly man, with a ' scholarly stoop in his Aoolders, a head of j boshy bair moch t^r^^d^ viih grey, a. pair ' of mild, wise spectacles, and. a geoJersl air ' of perplexed acquiescence in all nnff*^''1 1 a£Eans whatever. 'In his hands he te»M a ' very tiny sled, looking at it at .armVleogth, j 3& if it was sotnet2iiii£ of an explosive nature. ' On* six-year-old little feBow was surveying ; ins broken plaything vffji. despairing eyes, ( wlule two other excited nrefains danced dp and '? dom in front of the professor, endeavouring 1 duly to set forth the natare of the accident ' that had happened to the numer.

After considerjig the sitnation x few i tnhmtes the professor started off again drag- ' gmg the sled by the rope, and his processiaa, ! crow and all, trotted along behind him. ' Sow,' said Tom, ' he v£Q po straight to j the ciirpenter's shop to get that thing maided ; - -he ardnoos aatBre of tiie job, wSl charge yost \ ten times what it is worth, and he win pay it without a word.' ' Ko dooht he iriH. ™ ' And those little beggars will ran off with out even Hi?nlHi^ htm ' ** Bet ttay are fond -of him, Tom.' **I don't care.

Promise me yon won't teU anybody about it.' ! ' Of comse not, except Jem. ' : 'Oh, Jem knows all about it already : be was in it. Seems to me you're very dJatifai, tiioagh, all at once.

Well, Jem jast told him the thunder -shower bad done it. Hot it had charged the room with electricity, and that he himself was a first-rate prime cafidnctor. Jem expatiated learnedly for half. an hoar or more on the freaks of electricity ; talked, you. know, as n it was a ma«jai thing to see rooms behaving in that fashion. And, if you'll believe me, the professor »ctoafly took it all ia ; be is writing a paper now — if Jem'fi any anthority on the subject — en these Tom was in ecstasies of laughter by tiiis tj^p«f» and his Bister was not slow in joining ' I was only afraid father would bear the noise, and stop the fen,' gasped he at last, when be was able to sneak. 'Luckily he didn't come ia tzD it was over. I suggested to the professar that it might frighten mother if he was to mention it at_ the table, and he since.

' ' May ?' cried Tom, jumping to bis feet and dancing the FfehePe Hornpipe, ' yoo're a tramp I Jnst wait till Jem cones, and we'll have it all fixed. The professor never locks hie door.'

Bat Jem rejected both of these propasal£ ; they woald be liable to bring about discovery, and were not solemn enough to be accredited to a ghost. ! ' No ; it most he something that will I affect his whole life,' he said— 'something of I so much consequence that be would think it t likely tfae spirits would be charged to deliver j it Well tell him he must go as a missionarv ; ! or, no, better- stall, let's tell him to marry j somebody — May, here, for instance : he was i always fond of her, and she is right in the Baxne honee.~ ** Bat unluckily May is not food of him, but of yon,' observed Tom, wickedly. 'Well, he dosn'f; know that. He wiQ think it's bis duty to ask her. And when she says no, he wiU wait for eoate new spiritual light. Yon don't mind, do yon. May ?' May did mind .very much at first, but the two boys, aided by her own senae .of fun, at last persuaded her into it. Pesbaps she t&ooght; that it was sore to be discovered, and that the professor could not possibly carry his credulity to that, point, helped to quiet her conscience. At any rate, she not only yielded, bat, after the fashion of women kind, was the one to originate tile boldest part of the scheme. ' If I let you do that boys, you most let me do what I want to.' Of course they both asked, M What is ftT May refnsed to tefl them. ' You'll know ttaoon enough, 'she said, with the mischievouB sparkles comic? 'and eauu* in her brown eyes. 'OdyJf I don't say anvtiang to spoS toot fun, yoa. most pEoaiae not to spoil mine.'

Hay sat down to some feminine ! trork of her own. to ponder wver their ill -fated J schemes, when in Talked Professor Eenad, who was supposed -to be safe in tns j clasB-room. May was aghast at the sight of : him. ?? Kow for it T die thought 'It is too | bad I should have to take the scolding alone.' t For it could not but be that even so mild a man would be angry at such an escapade. Tree, be could not know of her share in it, bat then it was nearly as bad to have Tom made tiie scapegoat. Miss ftlay was an audactons young lady, ! bnt conscience made a coward of her, and she ! dared not look op or ask him why be was not at school. I ' Why don't he begin ?' she mused, still j keeping her eyes on ber work, as the tall | figure shuffled uneasily round the room. ? j Presently tiie professor stopped in front of ber and cleared his throat. ' Uy dear* Miss May, do yon think yon could e^er bring yourself to marry me f The work fell out of her hands, and May aat faMy- dnmbwitliastordshment. Theprotessor picked it up again for her. 'I am much older than yourself. Miss Mar. ' he went on, ** and a very awkward nun in action and speech, as yon see. Not such a one as a young lady would be likely to fancy. Only— only I felt it my duty to ask you.' Then at bst May foond her tongue. 'One would not like to marry anybody who asked her merely from a sense of dnty,' she said, gravely, bending still lower over her work. The same nosh tinged tbe professor's face that had been there the night before. 'When I said duty, Mini. May.' he answered her, half reproachfully, ' I oxtly expressed the motive tint had led me to speak to yon this morning. I said nothing of my earn feelings. Surely yon must know what tjrty are and have long been.

There was SmOug so pathetic w .the sight of the gentle, lesraed professor aodretmng cuch words to tbe thwgfatha* prl whom «««-_ treated only as a companion Si mischief, but T»« wbomhis love elevated to a pedestal above common womanhood, that Hay might well have been restrained by it. His gray bain and simple kindliness of life might bare aponhim. aewavarfvisMylbraiiioment ; aim the oM misehieMOT sparkle came back to the eyes that were so demurely dropped. 'Yet you have altered your resolution tins morning I' she ssid, inquiruigly. 'AiTI told you. Miss Bay, because I believed that is was .right for me to do so.' ' WeO,' «id May, after a long Dsnae, in which die was scarcely able to keep down the roguish quivering of her lips, 'if it is your doty to msRyoK.it most fas mine to marry you.' 'Then you consent. m The tall ungainly man stooped, wtiJi no grace euept that which love gave him, and lifted her hand to his lips. He seemed no more astonished at ber answer tail he had been at the spiritual visitation of tile night before. When the boys came home that rqght they foand the professor radiant, Mr. and Mte.

Whether she was pricked by ber coasdenee, or only frightened by the boldness of tbe game sue was carrying on, they coold not tefl. ( by herself and feU^on her, metanhorica% speaking, with an avalanche of ouestinDS. 'May did he really ask you to marry him?' 'Yes.' 'But be acts as if yon said yes.' „ 'WellMldid.' 'By Jovef ejaculated Tom, perfectly 'You know I told yon, boys, tha* HI : helped you in your tan, yon must let me ban mine.' 'But, May ? Ma; ! do you. knew he has sll resdy asked father's consent !

What a storm there vffl be J' 'She mews,' interrupted ten, who hid been studying her faoe attentively, 'to let it go on till it comes to the finals, and then say no iiwaaad of yes when the TOmiwtnr pubi the question.' Tom's face was s picture of mingled oon sserjutioB a&d; *«?'w^ti*h B& htA bftU a very low opinion of tiie courage of girls up ta this point, bnt here was one who was wu-:ng to go beyond him. 'Did yon think of this last night when you wouldn't tell ns what you were £oiug to do T* te asked humbly. 'Of course I did.' 'Only think. Tom, he believed every word of it. after sU ♦' put in Jem.

Have you (bought what an awful row there!) be when it comes ont?' 'IVs too btetoetop saw,' said, his sister faintly, ss ff she were a little alarmed herself at the prospect. ' Well anyway.

'You'd better take her oat of father's reach as soon as JWMsible. He thinks everything of the old professor. ' 'Well, why shoold'nl we?' asked Jem with confidence. ' It's just as weQ as any time. May won't ' mind.' And indeed May did look so relieved at this proposal, after the fashion of a child who has onexpectadly grasped a torpedo, tnat Tom began to think it would be the best way out of the ecrape, after all. To be sure, tbe pair wonld have nothing to live on after they were married, except his sister's littie leqscy, which would not go far; and besides which could not be claimed for a year, till the young lady was of age. Bnt Tom bad a cheerful confidence m Jenrfs abilities, and as a great confidence in his They finally settled in among themselves that this was to be the dawwxmMl, and after ward tried to look as if every thing was aD right One of them at least failed ignominiously. .
