A Forlorn Hope. Ons did think that something might come of that waterworks deputation to tho Government, but it is not bo. The eagest remark from the Premii r wa that perhaps we might bj put upon Ecogeera. Hope dies, despair fi'.ls our bunrnn, and dirty water our mouths. It is too bad, the water is ; and to ba doomed to drink it till the board can be decently interred next year ! This ii rather rough upon us, after the lightning, thunder, hail, and mud slinging of that public meeting. After hearing Bauoroft the wist, Taylor the sagaoious, Hendle the enthusiastic, and seeing Bailey's grand pyro technic, it is too bad. Is it not a good cause lost for the want of generalship ? However, if that board does not straighten itself to its ?work there will be a mighty hubbub. Burely it is not meant that through the hot summer months nothing 13 to be attempted, nothing done. There is ProfesEor Pepper. He oould send electricity to tho olouds, and bring down rain, at least, so he said ; oould he not be employed to bring ua tome relief? If hi has a eoheme— and I am told that he has— that will cleenae the pipes, why in th« name of Flagstaff Hill ii he not allowed to try it f He could not make tho water worse ; he might make it better. He says that the mischief, not the devil, is in the pipes— not in tho water The devil got into the awine safe enough, but sow the allegation is that they have got into the board. No, tho mischief is in the pipes. Very well, then, let the professor be allowed to enter the pipes at Gold Greek and make his way through to the city, if that is the way in whioh tho remedy is to be. applied. What can the objection heF Tho board oan have no fear lor tho professor. The man who otn make ghosts is not afraid of them. I m!an to say that if the professor has a scheme for oleansmg tho pipes and purifying the water, it is too bad not to let him try.
