PHOSPHORESCENT PAINT: Dr. Wylde takes giyat interest in :tlie scientific n'srfcWfle/of the age, and'in view of the diffieu It*' of '^tlmg' the Semaphore Jetty' landing stages pftinfa'd white/lie has *tt««<noii tfi' the\ht.-st novelty in paint Work, which" is thiis described :— " On Tliinsdav,' the 11 th March Inst, at the "Society of Arts, " Prfbri«*.* : Roscoe 1 in the chair* Mr. Heaton, « f Ghnring Cross Hospital, gave nn account of the 1 lumitfous pairit for which the lnt<\- Mr. Balmainob" tained n patent, and which is how' being introduced for many useful purposes. Surfaces painted with this substance (which io<>ks like ordinary white paint) absorb Ji^-ht vritii remarkable avidity, and continue Mft, » wanls to emit it in the dark for some hours: The paint, in fact, stores up daylight, or even candlelight, attd gives it out again afterwards in quantity sufficient to rtMidcr it available in wrtaiii cases as : a substitute for artificial illumiimtion. The pr.fp.Ttv'' to which the paint *nves its }«.«•< r is called "phosphorescence. . Most important i.f all, however; are tl.c proposed uses <>f tliu lii-w paint Tor marine pur|»pses. For example, it is often extremely-diffifcuH, ami yet absolutely ri< c -ssary, on dark 1 tiiglits -to distinguish' the buoys which. miu-k the channels of harlVp^s 'or rivers.^ ir the buoys were coated with thV luminous paint they would be visible throughout 1 the whole,"'brat any rrite the greater ^art, of the ni^it. - Again, n iili>buoy is 'pfractirally TOfttfs^^fii'ndark' liigHt; Tlii nnfortunafe ' inaii Ovt-rlvitird' caiotot see' it,-" and however good a swiUinier lie tnay lie it is a inere' nlifliice if he reaches it. or if a boat is able to pick hifn up. 1 But the life-buor exhibited at tha 'lecture would be «t all times Sufficiently •luminous to be' visible at a short distance, and would guidb not only tfttf fiwiintiier hut the boats' crews.' _ Lastly, h : diver was exhibited in fiill tire^s, whose, j lielniet' and waterproof "coat ItaVi" been, painted,and consequently iHuniinatcd. ; He, looked like a ponderous and unwieldy.; ghost, arid emitted an amount of light that, would' be quite sufficient to guide his operations at tlie' bottom of the water. It was,, in fact, stated that the' same dress' liad. been worn" ia day or two biifore' at the. bottom of the Southampton Dock, and that, tile diver had been able to distinguish the bolt heads in a ship's bottom with ease. "The patentees also showed h' luminous inscription 40ft. ! long, iii illustration of thuya lue of the 1 inveution as & means of advertising." ; : 1 V
