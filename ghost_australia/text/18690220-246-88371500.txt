BLACKWOOD, (FROM OUR OWN CORRESPONDENT.) THE usual quietness of our little township was disturbed on Tuesday evening last by the pleasing intelligence that Mr. Walter Montgomery, the tragedian, had made his appearance amongst us for the purpose of giving one of his justly- celebrated Recitals. Mr. Magnus was in commu- nication with Mr. Montgomery on the subject, but the former gentleman failed to receive any inti- mation as to when Mr. Montgomery would visit Blackwood. However, notwithstanding the short- ness of a few hours notice, the Oddfellows' Hall was well filled with an appreciative, audience. The programume comprised "The Sevun Ages of Man," " Hamlet's Soliloquy on Death," the scene between Wolsey and Cromwell from "Henry VIII.," a scene from "Much Ado about Nothing,' and the churchyatrd scene from " Hamlet." The second part consisted of Hood's "Bridge of Sighs," " Ben Battle," and " Mary's Ghost," all of which were given with exquisite humour and pathos., Mr. Montgomery also recited " The Bells" and "Shamus O'Brien," in answer to a request, The entertainment was a very delightful one.
