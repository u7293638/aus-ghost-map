THE COAST GUARDS. MAN'S TALE. h " GOOD evening, sir " " Good evening A fine night, this " "Yes, sir-A greenish sort of night Pity for us we don't have more of them " The scene was on the south coast of Cornwall, where I had learned a few days before the commencement of the long vacation, to seek a short repose from the turmoil and worry of the law, leaving behind me the old time worn buildings of Lincoln's Inn, where the old sundial, with its quaint mottoes seldom looked at, and still seldom needed, is perpetually reminding us of the frail tenure by which we hold our lives , leaving the bush stars in their gowns and wigs, hurriedly passing from courts to consultations (or, mother HOlds, from fee to see), the lawyer, in their black dress, and with their bundles of papers under their arms, and the office boys, with big bags, stuffed full of what it would be hard to enumerate brief cases, opinions, and all the other multifarious paraphernalia of the profession, evidently looking upon themselves as no mean part of their respective establishments, beating all this busy scene (and only too glad to do so) to seek a little rest and quiet, in about the quietest part of England I had taken rooms in a little village about half a mile from the sea, and the short walks gradually) extended, the regular hours and the quietness of even lines; inUunlit and externally) was fast bringing me round again when the circumstances I am about to relate took place. It was a fine moonlight evening, and T stood gazing out of my window at the less stir rages still passing up and down the village street, when a sudden wish came into my head to take a walk along the cliff- by moonlight I had often thought of doing tins won learned what sort of life the Coast guardsmen had of it-the e men by whom every inch of England so that say, is walked round every night, as Tilt v pi e up and down, night after night, and year after year, and so I resolved, at last, to put in) long fancied scheme into ever action I had been sent el mg along for about half a mile, looking at the blue waves, it aching far far out into the distance, and chequered here and there by the distant sail of some fishing boat gleaming silt her in the moonlight, and at the long golden track, reaching from far away up to the base, of the cliffs the footpath of the facts, as I had been told long ago-and peopling it in my fancy with the light spirits of the an tripping along in many a font istic maze, on the glittering surface, and calling to their sister sprites in the water below, when I was startled by on approaching footstep and, looking up saw a man close to me, while the inviting smell from a short pipe quickly recalled me from my) fancies to the state of ordinary existence All that I noticed of his- dress it is that he had on a rough pilot Coat, with slow hit, while a thick wall mc "tide seemed his- only apparent weapon of offence and defence In short, it was with him that threatened- "first above written" Were i.\cllttH"od I soon found that my new acquaintance was one of that very body of men that I had so often pondered about, and so, have fallen into conversation, I walked on a bit with him "I suppose you don't have much to do now " beside- by walking up and down, do tion " " Why, no, sir There is not '0 much doing as there used to be once on a time, though I have seen some going- on in my time Mind where you are treading sir'" he exclaimed " The call is not very 'safe along the edge, and if it gave way you would be smashed on the rocks below, like a poor fellow I knew was some time ago God rest his soul ' " " What of him I said " Did any one fill over here s" "Whyte, sir They didn't exactly fill over, and it wasn't over this cliff, neither but the one we shall come to next My beaten Is there. and, as I am a bit before my time, I expect my mate won't be up for ten minutes or so and if you like to hour the sale, though it 's not so much after all, I will tell us" on the spot where it will happened Indeed, to get the truth, I shall be very glad 1 of the company, for it's a windit t "Pot, and often as I have waited there I am always glad to turn my back on it again." We soon reached the bay by the light of the moon after looking along the call, to see if there were any signs of his companion and not finding ant, he sat down on a stone, and I lighted a cigar, and, taking my place beside him, he began - "It is not so many tears ago sir, eight or nine, maybe when a young gentleman came down here, as it might be you to spend a month or so our town being a quiet sort of place, like He wasn't a bad looking sort of fellow, and had small and white hands Indeed, most people would have called him handsome, though there was always a kind of look about his mouth I didn't like to say he was stating up at the Miners' Arms?, and there soon got baits about the town of the way in which he and two or three other wild young fellows about here, as there are every where, used to go on the sitting up at night-, the dancing and card playing and the wild freaks they used to be at but as he always had plenty of money, and paid his bill every week (it was by his own wish), Polmarthen, the landlord, sir, never cared to say anything to him he was a close man, was Polmarthen, and no doubt he made plenty of money out of his customer, but it would have been better for him if he had never let Mr Hendon under his foot His daughter, prêt li Kate Polmarthen, as she it is always a culled, was the prettiest girl for miles about (I sent you guess what is coming, and many was the glass, that had been emptied in her honor, and in int a young man would have given much to have stood well in her good graces , but though she was a bit of a flirt, there was none that had her found favor in her eyes but Bulph Belgravia a likely young fellow as over was seen Folks often wondered how it was that old Pointai then ever allowed his daughter to engage herself to young Trcgnrva who was only a fisherman, but though the old man loved mono) much he loved his daughter more and though I hear there was some trouble about it, yet in the end, he gave way to her in this It was not long, however, after Mt Hendon came down here, that a change seemed to come over poor Kate She would sit silent for hours, and if Ralph came to try and cheer her up, she would speak sharply and harshly to him, and then sometimes burst into a flood of tears, and beg his pardon, and kiss him, and tell him that he was the dearest and best of men, and that she was not worthy of him 1 to us a great friend of his, and I gathered most of this from him at the time, Poor fellow I was sitting in my cottage one day, towards the etching, thinking it would soon be time to be going off on his beat, when Owing Tregarva burst in with a fine as while as a wheat, and scarcely able to stand What l the matter man, said I have you seen a ghost ''' but he staggered to a chair and fill rather than sat down on it, holding his face between his hands, while the big sobs that burst from him seemed to shake him from head to foot, though not a tear fell through his fingers. I stood by him for some little time, but he seemed to grow worse instead of better, and at last I said my hand on his shoulder ' Come, Ralph be a man, what is till Hits about he turned on me like a tiger 'Tiatomc alone curse ton Do you to mock at me and with one spring he was past me, and out at the door like a ma Union I followed in haste greatly alarmed as you may suppose, but could I see nothing of him. There was a mist rising, and any one would have been invisible at any moderate distance, and it was with deep forebodings that I went my rounds that night When I returned to my cottage, I noticed a small piece of paper lying on the floor It explained all It was a letter from London to Kate, evade all) written in a hurry, and was all crumpled up as if it had been clean bed in the fingers Jio doubt it had dropped from Ralph i hand, though how he got it I do not know It left no i morn for doubt He urged her to fly from the village before her condition became known, and promised that he would at once for her Soon after I heard more That same evening Kate Poliuaithcn had disappeared That morning her bull com* £6, Ex moisture one class as yellow * sea-air is ' HJl-Ol-ScL-t had been found empty, and she was gone What surprised others, though not me was that her father made no search after her-for he made none He knew only too well why she had gone Hendon was still in the village in order suppose to divert all attention from himself as he was not an are that the note had been found Ralph and I each keeping our own counsel What need to publish the cer taunts of her shame? We heard nothing, of Ralph for three days when he turned and went about his work just as usual but resenting fiercely any mention of the past His manner too was quite changed Oh so rugged and wild he looked and with a dogged 1 kind of sullenness. in place of his former light been led g note Even to me he never spoke now and one or two at tempts I made to draw him out into comers i tion were met with such bursts of rage that I was obliged to have him to himself And now I must come to the most painful part of mi tale You see that the bin below is closed in at high tide, and the Hind gets quite
