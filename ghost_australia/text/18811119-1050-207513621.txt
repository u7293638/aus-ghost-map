" ' ' ' " feffi 'we' rifePdi'nofc'1yely- merely on 'tli'e' language of the Papal iiidulgences.1 ' 'Tte;; history of the .Ckurchj for the- fourteentli- and fifteenth j, centuries,! , , proves, , conclpr j siyely,, the.imeaning which the Church of, Rome then intended the people, to.,. put j-. and'whichjtheyi actually. 'did-- put,, on- the indulgences issued in her name, and with ' herflexpress sanction. Of this; the ancient writer; Goh'elinus, furnishes , us with a remarkable proqf. He says . that, the preachers of indulgences told , the people.,, too encourage them to deal with them, that.the indulgences were not only dpcend but d culpd too — i.e., not merely from the'- teiPpbral punishiPent of sin; but from1 the faik'l't itself) which deserved eternal pun ishment, This made the people look into them ; . anil not finding those terms, but only, a most .plenary remission, they-. were unsatisfied), because they, -were told- the, fault could only be forgiven by God alone ; bub-if -they- could -but once find that -the Pope (W.duld /undertake to clear all scores , with! (God. lifqr them, they did, not doubt, but the indulgences would be worth their money.. Whereupon," adds Gobelinus, " those very terms were put into them;" then the wiser men ..thought, these were counterfeit, and made only by the pardon-, mongers ; but, upon further inquiry, theyfe found it1 otherwise. 'W e may add another' example from ,the ; general form . of absolution, , sold bv Tet-' zei-,,. under the direct , authority of Leo Xr. We1 need scarcely recall to , the recollection:: ofdur 'readers, that' the shameful sale of indiilgeuces, by Tetzel and others was the impiediate cause of the Reformation in the sixteenth century., / The absolution con-,, cluded' asi follnws :— "1; restore thee to thb'boly'Bacraments '.of the" Church, and to'.the unity of tHe faithfui; and to the innocence, and. purity conferred on thee by, baptism ; ! so that.the gates .of punishment , may be closed, against thee at thy depar ture;' and'those of the joys of Paradise be 1 opened.'1 Pr,'8hbuldest thounot presently . di el let this. gr, ace, reniairi in full force, and, avail thee at the point of death. In the- name of'thei Father, and of the Son, and of 11 'the- Holy1 Ghost:— F. B.- Johannes Tetzel; /Subrcommissarius, manu prpjjria : scripsit." Either the doctrine of the Church , of Rome is the same now as it was in: the time of Tetzel and Leo X., or it is not. Ifdt'he the same, then modern apologists in,, Protestant countries are not to he believed when they tell us that " an indul gence is no pardon for sin -of any sort, past; present, or: future."— If' it':bef- ijfr fefefoti then the Church of ' Rome must haye, changed her docti:me ! since the six- teenthiiicentury). and,i consequently,1 she cannot be infallible. ' We'have given a specimen of- the lan guage of the documents which Tetzel Sold ; but v.we .really feel .some reluctance in reproducing some , passages of the harap-i, gues -which he is said 'to have addressed to 'the people, and in which he magnified the' value of his indulgences : — " At the very instant that the money rattles at the bottom .of the . chest, the soul : escapes from" Purgatory) and flies liberated to heaven. . . . . I would1 not change my privileges for those of St. Peter in beSveri1'; for I have saved' more souls by my. indulgences than, the , Apostle by his sermons.,,. / . Reflect that for everymortal sin,: you; must, after confes sion and contrition, do) penance for seven years', eithdr in this life- or in Purgatory. NqWj hqw many mortal sins are there not committed in a day, how many, in a week, how many in a month, how many in a year; how many in a whole life ! . . . Al'ais ! 'these sins are almost infinite, and; they entail 'an infinite penalty in the fires,, of, Purgatory ; and now, by means of these letters - of, indulgence) you can, once in your" life; in every case except four, which" are' reserved for the Apostolic See, and afterwards in the article of death, obtain a plenary remission of all your penalties and-- all, your sins. . . . There, is no sin' so great that an indulgence cannot remit ; and even if any one (which is, doubtless, impossible) had offered violence to the Blessed Virgin Mary, motherr of God; it isi as,.' clear as , day-light that if .he only procures an indulgence; all"will!be forgiven him ! " jVHen the princes, of the. Empire were assembled at the Diet of Nuremburg, they made a complaint of. their grievances to the Pope.;, and) in. speaking of-. indulg ences, „;they , unanimously, state, , as the fcosjf.iarf,consequence- of them, " that the people were cheated-1 of their money by them ;" they then go on to point out far more .considerable evils .arising, from .the, same pernicious source., " Ohristian.piety they- say, "-was destroyed bg them manner of ' wickedness did spring ( from thence ; ; men were; afraid of committing norland of sins, when; at so .cheap, "a rate!, theyicoula purchase; aremission of them." We , must conclude; "for the present, with1 nbticifi' a'-'priiclent piece Of advice about, indulgences, given , to members of the dihurbb ,qf 'Rome, ,by Cardinal Bellar- mine. " Though the Church," saith he, , " may ,have poorer to, give indulgences, yet ' ithey, may, want-j their effect in . particular,- persons, and; therefore, all prudent Chris tians do so receive 'indulgences, as withal otherwise to satisfy1 -God1 for their sinsi" We hope there are many such " prudent Christians " in New South Wales. The plain meaning of Bellarmine's adyice) if he hadithe courage to speak plainly) is this— ;that: prudent Christians are , too wise to- believe in indulgences, and. that none but fools' rely on them ; for if - there were any thing but fraud and imposture in ' them, why may not a prudent Christian trust a Church, which he believes infallible ? If the Pope on next Easter Sunday, gives- a plenary indulgence to, every person, in the crowd standing ,at 'the door of St.. Peter's, at Rome) . we desire to know why a prudent Christian of that Church may not, yea; ought not to rely lipon his" word ?', Does he suspect the head of his Church may cheat and abuse him ? If he does, what becomes of infallibility ? If he : verily believes, thatthe Pope cannot err, and will, /not1 (deceive, why must -not his word- be taken? We know not how these things i pass current among prudent Christians of 1 the Church of Rome; we would only in vite all sincere and earnest members of that- Church, who may read what wehav9 written, to contrast the dangerous and contradictory statements /of her Popes,aud divines, on the , momentous subject of .the , forgiveness ' of sins, with the short and Bimple statement of the inspired Word of 1 God— " The blood of Jesus Christ his Son cleanseth us from all sin." — 1 John : :i. 7. !: . ,!. .
