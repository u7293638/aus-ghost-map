THE BALLARAT GHOST. The Ballarat Courier observes that interest in the midnight rambler who wanders round the mullock-heaps near the Victoria United mine, Princes-street, Ballarat East, is increasing. Adventurous persons are talking of investigating the character of the ghost (who, by the way, is an original one, aud dresses in black), but his stone-throwing propensities deter them. He again made his appearance one night last week, and a police constable would probably have clutched him but for an unfortunate accident by which the officer slid down one of the mullock- heaps rather precipitately. The dark visitor is said tohavelockedtheminers in the engine-house a few nights since, and to have carried on in a manner which stamped him as a fiendish lunatic. It is impos " that the foolish individual will be at large many nights longer, as residents in t' neighborhood are preparing to give him warm reception. Meanwhile considerable commotion is existing in the minds of residents at the strange occurrence, and many are the speculations hazarded as to who is so foolhardy as to risk the forcible insertion of a pound or two of duck shot in his body. The other night a large number ot persons went out, dedetermined to "do" for the ghostly visitor, or die, but up to a late hour next morning he did not make his appearance. It appears that the 11 ghost" consists of an eccentric resident in the vicinity ot'the mine, but still the miners and others at the claim do not feel at case when on the night shift, as on several occasion* a number of persons have surrouuded the mullock-heap on which he usually stands, and yet when they " went for him" at the summit, he suddenly disappeared.
