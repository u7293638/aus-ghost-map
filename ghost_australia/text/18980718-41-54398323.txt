The season— IS97-8— so far at city racing ii concerned, was brought to a termination on Saturday aftarnoon, wbon South Australian Tattersall's Club bold their Winter Meeting on the Old Course. The weather, though a little chilly at interval.!, was admirable for racing, and the attendance was fair. The totalizator was better patronised than it was at the same meeting last year, £7,71*8-5 being invested as compared with £u,iM3 10*. re corded twelve months ago. Backers com menced the afternoon all right, bat they overlooked Stocking* in the Steeplechase, the dividend which he paid amounting to £23 3s., anil they failed to futen on to Cigarette in the July Handicap, her sup porter* in ths maohine receiving £17 9s. for gaoh sovereign invested. The resulti of the y.B.0. Grand National Meeting were posted on the course, and the victory of Floater in the big event wat naturally well received by the public The Dream and Quondong were the only two withdrawals out of tho eighteen ooloured on the card in the Trial Stakes, and backers expressed a- preference for Orb and Rose Park. Neither of the pair was, however, equal to securing even a kitu&tion;, the finish being confined to the two-year-olds Gratuity and Louise, victory resting with the sister to Goodwill after an interesting set-to. Gratuity, who was in recoipt of a, Mb. allowance for being a maiden, paid 5J to 1, but had Louise reversed the positions the divi dend oa her would have been £32 odd. Another capital Geld faced Mr. Cornelius in the Hurdle Race, Father Confessor being the only absentee. Albnry Queen was installed favourite, but thanks to Rronberg, New Warrior, Li ttle Martin, and Wirrawa also being f»r^^H those behind the mare were accommo dated with 4$ to L Too race proved the best of good thing* for Albory Queen, who took charge seven furlongs from home and had all her opponents in hopeless trouble before the straight was reached. The other placoi were filled by Little Martin and Barton, the latter of whom would have paid the healthy dividend of £23. A capital gallop executed by Birksgato on the track during the week and his creditable performances as Port Augusta gained for him the position of tint favourite in Tattersalls' Handicap, in which Viking and Goodwill were the next most fancied. The Judgment of backors was well verified, for the trio bad their numbers hoisted by the Judge, with Birksgate on top. The running was made by Conscript, who held command until the dip in the straight, when HodgKns came on with Birksgate. the result from that point never being in doubt. Good will made a determined effort to get on terms with Keily's gelding from the distance, but the attempt was futile, and he was beaten comfortably by a length and a half. Viking was third a couple of lengths further back, with Conscript fourth. As was generally antieipated. Father Confessor and Happy Jack mouopolizadattenttoa inthe3teapleanase,with Ensign carrying the most money of tho others. The supporters of Father Confessor were put out of their suspense early in th« contest, as he cams to grief at tho third fenoe, leaving Stockings with a substantial lead of Evanston. Stockings came on over the treble in front of the Stand as pioneer, and from this out he was never headed, he having practically led from start to finish. Making the South terrace double the second time Happy Jack, whom Joskin had laid too far out of the race, ran up behind the loader, and from the Stand appeared to have bis measure, but the ?Sort was too much for him, and he was wall beaten in the run homo. Aif. Read, who has not ridden in publio for some time, piloted Stockings. Grassmere fell at the jump at the turn following the treble, and injured himself so severely that ba had to be destroyed. Grassnwra has proved an expensive animal to Mr. C. H. T. Hart since ho purchased him eighteen months ago. Up to the time he made bis mistake on Saturday he had sbapod so well that Howie fancied his chance. Florida fell the first time round. The Federation Handicap, for two-year-olds, furnished a slashing finish, six out of tho eight starters twing bunched as they passed the Judge. The verdict was secured by Cicero, who Mat Louise by a short neck, with Tarsu* and Gratuity alongside oack other only a head away, while Furore, who commenced slowly, and Lady Melbourne were on their quarters. The horsemanship of Hodgkins contributed in » treat measure to the victory of Cicero, who paid a dividend of £5 6s. The favourite was furore, who was backed down to a shade over 6 to 4. Gnullo was made a 2 to 1 chance in the July Handicap, but aba did not com mence too well, and was beaten by Cigarette and Quiokahot. Rose Park and Cigarette made the pace very lively from the rising ol the barrier, and though the former failed to stay, Cigarette kept her place, and beat Quickahot by » length and a- half.
