Tfas narra tive wu written, at tbt n quest ol a friend, ool many days alter tbe evani, when all Uio olreamstkooes wete tresb In my ricolleclion ; On the 10th of October, 1870, I drove over from Norwich to Mannlngtou Hall, to ?pond tbe night at LordOrford's.

Not for a singlu moment did it turn upon tho supernatural ; It wat clilufly concerned with questions of art, and tho experionocs of men who bad scon a great deal of tha world, and oould desoribs In telligently what they had socn, and com ment upon It sugu««'ivoly. 1 have very rarely been at % ronro pleneant i*rtr.

Tbe main object o! my going over to Mannlngton wai to examine and uk» notos upon som» very rare books In LordOifurd'i library, wbiob I bad l«eu anxiously winning to get a light of (or tome tears, but trad never buen fortunate enough to meat with up to this time. I asked leave to sit up for some hours and mako trtnuoriptt, Uil- lordship at first wished mo to let faia valet remain lu attouduoe to ace all the lights put out, but a* tbla would have embarrassed me, and oompollud me to go lo bad earlier than I wisbod, and as it eeemed likely that 1 thould bo occupied till two or three in the morning, it 'at agreed that I should be left to my own devices, and the lervants should be allowed to rotlro. llr eleven o'clock I wu tbe only parson downatairi, and I wu very toon busily at work, and tbtorbtd in my oooupstltra. The room in which I wai writing Is a largo one, with a huge flru-pLce and a graod old chlnney; and It Is meJleaa to aay that It is furnished with every com fort .and luxuiy. The library opona into tnlt room, and I had to pus out from where I was titling into ibis library and got upon a cbalr to reach the volumes J wanted to examine. There were iix tmall volumes in all. I took them down, aud placed thorn at my right hand in a little pile, and set to work — lometlmti reading, aomotlmee writing. At I finished with a book, I placed it In front of me. There were four silver candlestloki upon ihe table, the oandtei all burning, and, at I am a chilly person, I sat myself at one earner of the Uble with tbe fire at my left, and at Intervale, at 1 had flnlthed wl-h a book, I roae, knocked the fire together, and stood up to warm my feet. I oontinotd in thlt way at my.tuk t.lll nn&rlrflnfi; a'niAAlr. I hail orA. an tutlfcar than I etpeoted, and I had only one more book to occupy me. I row, wound up ray watcb, and opened a bottle of Stltser water, end I remember thinking to myself that I ahould pet to bed by two after all. 1 tet to work at the last little book. I bad been engaged upon it about half an hour, and wm ja.t beginning to think that my work wu drawing to a clow, when, at I wu actually writing, I taw a large whit* b»nd within a foot of my elbow, Tornlqg myfccad, then ait a ngnr*jBL| tomawhat Utgfmau, who.

He waa dr»u»d in what I can only describe u a kind of eeoltilat tlcal habit of thick corded silk, or tome I inch material, close up to tho throat, and a narrow rim or edging, about an inon broad, of satin or velvet, serving at a itand-up collar, and flttng clow to the chin. The right hand, which, had first attracted my attention, wMoUtptog, with out any great pressure, tht left hand ; both hands were in perfect rmoM, abd the Urge bine veins of the right hand.wereoon ?p&aous.; I remember thinking that the hand wu like the band ol . VatajoWt magnificent 'Dead. Knight' to the National Gallery. I looked at my Wltor 1 for tome seoondi, and wu perfectly sure 1 that he wu not a reality. A thousand I thoughts came crowding upon too, bat I net tbe least f«ding of alarm, orl even uneasinossj curiosity and a strong I interest wer» npperniott.
