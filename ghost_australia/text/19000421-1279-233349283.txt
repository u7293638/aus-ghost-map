\- The Late General Wauchope's Family. Niddrie Marisohal, tbe reaidenoe of the late General Wauchope, is one of tbe most ancient and interesting residences in Mid-Lothian, -and tbe Waucbopes are recognised as one, if not tbe ibe oldest families in tbe county. In the time of Mary Queen of Scots, tbe mansion was destroyed by fire, and most of tbe family archives and papers were burnt; while during the time tbat Cromwell raided Scotland Ibey again lost many valuable documents. Tradition says that Niddrie was given to the then ancestor of the Waucbope family by Malcolm Canmore. The Waucbopes, who were staunch Roman Catbolios, were adherents of tbe'tinfortunate Queen Mary, and in 1745 they threw in their lot with Prince Charles Stuart and supplied bim on several occasions with money; but on his final defeat they made peace with Ibe reigning Sovereign, and have been loyataoldiers and subjects ever sinoe. Niddrie contained at. one time a King's Boom, where Charles I. slept, but this was removed some years ago owing to some structural improvements. A ghost named Jerry Traill was supposed to haunt tbe passages and rooms in tbe gloaming. Niddrie is surrounded by beautiful old trees and quaint oldworld gardens, with delightful walks between old holly edges ; ..while there is an abuudance of fruit and fiowera. The ourious name of Niddrie Marischal is supposed to -bave originated from the fact that tbe Waucbopes were ^hereditary Bailies to tbe Earls
