THE GHOST OE MRS. HIVERS, HO. 1." A ghost iu the Divorce Court seems to be a strange mingling of the ideal and the actual. A message from Albany, Aew York, dated 'May 2, states that Anna Kivers, who has begun an action for di voree from her husband, claims that the ghost of her "husband's first wife infests the bouse- and makes her miserable.,..'It .ap pears^ at nights and frightens her so that she is unabV.td sleep. .It comes near to her and indulges .in paroxysms of weeping, and occasionally it .smashes the furniture. Mrs. ltivers's assertions were . at first laughed at, but she. persisted in them, and upon being medically examined was de clared sane.'
