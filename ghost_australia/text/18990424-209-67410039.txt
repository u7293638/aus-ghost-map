The law of the land had not provided for ouch cases, and until quite recently it was an everyday occurrence for a poor old body to be brought before the courts and sentenced to herd with criminals, the charge brought against them being-poverty I No wonder public opinion was roused and it is en couraging to note that noble effolbrts are being made to house such poor. old poople and enable them to go down the hill towards the grave at least without the thought of whether the morrow would bring any food to take away the gnawing pangs of hunger.
