mim " THE BREAKER" is gone ! The Army made one last vigorous attack to save his hard cased soul. Someone got punched on the nose, and—" The Breaker" is away to the " Setting Sun." I take up poor " Break- er's" Jew's harp, which he left at the GAZETTE Office, and chant sadly, S'long Breaker, you're gone for good, Into the land " out back" ; Striking a line all bushmen should, Taking the north east track. Send us word when the bush is sighing, Wrapped in the heat of noonday dying. Think when the swans are homeward flying, Think of the Barracks " Crack." Close your eyes, though the dreams be brief, Ghosts of the early morn— Out on the course in bold relief, Gripping our saddles worn. Mate o' mine, when we two were pacing, Over the rails, with the sod wall facing, Exercise ! It was more like racing ! Out in the Randwick dawn. Good-bye, Breaker ! my heart is sad — Weary the days to me ; Down South Creek, where the willows wave, Yet once again I see Your big heart, with a bare wound showing— Mate o' mine ! by the cool creek flowing, None but I got a chance of knowing Your hidden misery. ROBERT ALLAN.
