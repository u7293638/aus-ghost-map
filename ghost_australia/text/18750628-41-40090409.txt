ROCHESTER, June 22. OÂ«iEg to tbe almost continuous wet weather the main road through the township is gradually being washed into watercourses for want o i roper drainage, and on each side the roads are like a strip a chain wide of well-ploughed land with an occasional lake to relieve the mouotony. A resident sent his horse to grasp, but the animal entered an open and vacant farm hat and then the door must have blown to, thereby imprisoning the beast far a day and night. It was accidentally found by a boy, *ho, on first hearing a noise, thought it moat have been from a ghost The roads, rivers, and creeks are dreadfully out of repair. A day or two ago a farmer was thrown from his horse into the Magpie Creak, and severely bruised. Several narrow escapes to persons crossing the Broughton have been re ported. The river is about as high aa ever it has been since the region wa3 settled upon. This place is a little livelier than usual on account of the building of an hotel; but a butcher's, baker's and Ehoemaker's premises are needed to make the village class with some of the better known Northern townships.
