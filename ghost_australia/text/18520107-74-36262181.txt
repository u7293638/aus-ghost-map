INDOLENCE. Indolent I Indolent l--yes, I am Indolent So is the grass growing tenderly, slowly, So Is the violet fragrant and lowly, Drinklng in quietnoss, pence, and content, So Is the bird on the light brinnches swinging, Idly his carol of gratitude singing, Only on living and loving Intent. Indolent I Indolent I-yes, I am indolent - So Is the cloud overhanging the mountain, So is the tremulous wave of a fountain, Uttering softly Its eloquent psalm, Nerve and sensation In quiet replosing, Slent s blosssoms the night dew Is closing, But the full heart beating strongly and calm. Indolent I Indolent l--yes I em Indolent, If it be Idle to gathor my pleasure Out of creation's uncoveted treasure, Midnight and morning,-by forest and sea, Wild with the tempest's sublime exultation, Lonely In autumn's r orlorn lamentation, Hopeful and happy with springand the beer. Indolent I Indolent I-are ye not Indolent, Thralls of the heart and its suanges weary, Tolling like gnomes where the darkness Is dreary, Toiling end sinning, to heap up your gold, Stflingl the hIeavenward breath of devotlion, Crushing the freshness of every emotion, Hearts like the dead, that are pulseless and cold ? Indolent I Indolent I-art thou not Indolent, Thou who art living unloving and lonely, ,Vrapped Ina pall that will cover thee only, Shrouded In selfishness, piteous ghost? Sad eyes behold thee, and angels lamre weeping O'er thy forsaken and desolate sleeping; Art thou not Indolent ?-Art thou not lost ? A. W. It -New York Tribune.
