THE GHOST. DANCE OF THE SIOUX. The Ghost Dance, in which the Sioux Indians are now engaged, has seldom been witnessed by a, white man, hut an American paper describes one of them as seen from a distance by an enterprising contributor, who persuaded n friendly liali-brced to bike lihu to the spot. The camp in question was situated in a hollow between a-narrow belt of hills. Many of the Sioux are farmers and freighters, and their waggons were corralled in the middle of the valley. Some of the older braves and squaws, who linvc never recon ciled themselves to modern ways, had tents apart. The oxen, pigs, and poultry were cooped or tethered on the outskirts of the camp. The dance began at dark, anil though the old squaws had carefully raked out the fires, a blaze arising from them now and then revealed the fact that the braves were in full war paint. The warriors formed in rows at the eastern end of the camp, those in front kneeling, with the young bucks and squaws staneling behind them. At this point there was a paitso of about 10 iniuutcs, during which perfect Bilonco and absolute immobility prevailed. Then the old srpiaws joined hands and knelt down in the centre of the valley. They began cliaiitiug â– what sounded like a dirge, varied by savagely triumphant yells. The warriors advanced, and, joining hands in a large circle behind the old squaws, they began the Ghost Dance. They, too, chanted a dirge, but less shrilly than tlio'squaws, and then "came the invocation to the dead braves to arise and exterminate the white man. The old women, meanwhile, had each procured a burning stick that had apparently been dipped: in some kind of pitch. Returning with these, they stole like shadows under the linked arms of the warriors, and passed through the circle like a procession of sphinxes. This was repeated again and again, and it is said that the dance lasts till daylight,when every one concerned in it is more or less exhausted.
