j UNITED STATES. G I (Foott Our CoRRESPONDENT.", NEW YORK, May 24. It is more plain than at any previous time that the tariff will be the chief question at issue in the national canvass that will have been opened by the conventions of both parties before this letter reaches you The party managers may try to dodge it, but so far as the vote of the country is not already determined by strict party ties, it is the tariff that will decide it The long debate that has been going on in the popular branch of Congress has awakened far more interest in the question than has ever been shown before, and the tendency of public opinion is very strongly toward freer trade Of this there can be no doubt tHis matter that has received most attention, and about which the contest has waged most fiercely, is the repeal of the duty on wool and curiously enough the greatest fervour in opposition to the repeal has been shown in Ohio which state does not produce one third as much wool as Texas, from which state comes Mr Mills, the chairman of the ways and means committee and the relentless champion of free wool The reason of this is not far to seek Ohio is a politicians suite It is said to have more politics to the square foot than any other state in the Union Most of the running part of the state was settled by emigrants from New England, who in the days when slavery was a living issue were not free sellers and Republicans the large cities and some of the smaller ones, on the other hand, have a considerable foreign population, and a good man residents of Southern birth or descent who in those days, were Democrats Hence the State was often ' doubtful. It hold its State elections for many years in October a few weeks before the national elections and victory in these State elections was greatly desired by each party The sentiment of any small body of voters who held the " balances! power was therefore, out of all proportion to its real importance, respected by both parties and as there was always a certain number of Democratic farmers who raised sheep and believed in a tariff on wool, the Democrats in the state have until recently been weak kneed on that question Some three or four Democrats in the House from Ohio have been opposed to free wool, and as the Democratic majority is but 15 in all these men have been the object of great solicitude on both sides It, before the Mills Bill reaches a vote, free wool is stricken From it, it will be due to the necessity of winning these votes. But up to the present time the committee has shown no signs of yielding On the contrary, Mr Mills declares that he will let the bill be defeated, and trust to the people to give it a majority in the next Congress rather than yield what he regards as one of the plainest requirements of tariff reform In any case, the question of free wool wd enter largely into the canvass this summer, and there is practically no doubt that the next Congress at the latest will repeal the duty After a long struggle, the International Copyright Bill has passed the Senate with a large majority It will now go to the House, and will pass there also unless it should be crowded out by measures in which members have more direct interest There is a very large majority for the bill in the House it it can be reached, but a few members can prevent its consideration if they choose 1 England has just been strengthening the Government by the adoption of what is practically the previous question of American legislative bodies, but the hopes I have seen expressed in the English press, based on supposed American procedure, that this device will greatly aid in the despatch of business are, I fear, ill founded A bill cannot be talked to death in Congress, but it can usually educated or very greatly delayed by " filibustering i e by dilatory proceedings These are quite simple A motion to adjourn, or, when the House adjourns, to adjourn to a fixed time, is always in order and one eighth of the members present can always order a roll call, which can sumes about an hour By alternating these motions delay can be secured so long as the physical strength of the minority holds out there is danger of this in the case of the Cop) right Pill, from a certain number of western members, who have got it into their heads that the bill is meant to make reading dear for the benefit of Englishmen As a matter of fact, copyright will cheapen literature, because so soon as the market is secured it will be to the interest of publishers to meet as wide a demand as possible and this can only be done by cheap editions The most grotesque element of opposition to the bill came in the Senate from some self appointed champions of the newspapers, who tried to amend the bill in such a manner as to prevent a copyright from being given to articles published in a magazine tile contention being that this would cut off the great supply of miscellaneous matter from the newspapers. This is perfectly true, as nearly all the short stories now used in American newspapers are stolen from English magazines, but it is also true that the newspapers would be glad to have a stop put to this piracy If they could control the stones they would be glad to buy them, whether foreign or native, and the modern plan of ' syndicates,' by which several newspapers whose fields do not coincide unite in bu) ing expensive matter, would bring such matter to a wide market The papers the authors, and elie readers would all gain by It Honesty in this case, at any rate, is good POllC). there has been a queer volte face by both parties in the Senate on the Canadian 1 scenes Treat) A few weeks ago the lie publicans were dead against considering it in open session, and the Democrats were tr) ing to secure that plan Now positions are reversed It has been found that two or three of the Democratic senators are afraid of their Irish constituents, and while they would vote for the treaty in secret, do not dare to do so in public. The Republicans, on the other hand, think they can ' make capital with the Irishmen by opposition to the treaty and that the Democrats will not dare to fight then very hard Probably this is true There is as I have said, little chance for the treaty in any case but one advantage of the present chance of front is that we shall probably have an open debate, and that will be good for the country. It cannot fail to bring out the fact that the opposition to the treaty is purely political, or else comes from a little lot of New England fishermen, whose interest is solely in keeping up the heavy duty on Canadian fish and fish oil It would be easy enough to show that the total interest affected adversely by the treat) is exceeded in value by any one of a halt dozen minor industries in the United States that would be benefited by it -thup of carr) no fish, for instance, which would be greatly stimulated by free importation of Canadian fish One dealer, who makes a specialty of cod liver oil for meet cruel purposes, says that with free fish, for this trade alone, with the superior processes of preparation now in use in the United States, an export trade could be built up in a few cars worth more than the present yield of all the cod caught by American fishermen But beyond these facts is the very important one, that it we do not accept the treaty we must either keep up the vexatious disputes of the last 10 years, or we must resort to the non intercourse policy, which would be one month inflict injury to a greater area it than the entire fishing trade is worth The ignoring of such facts as these, because a few thousand Irishmen are in a state of chrome anger with Knglan 1 and will express their feeling in votes, is to be good politics," but it seems a peddling sort of statesmanship The America, papers have been discussing with a good deal of interest the in stem of checking Chinese immigration by them j taxes, and some of them have given New Zealand as an example of its effective work it. It our) shows with what profound ignorance and with how little real interest the matter is regarded, that many of these papers urge upon Congress the enactment of a like law. The fact is that the landing of Chinamen on American shores is already forbidden under very severe penalties (mich mg to the confiscation of the vessel except the Chinamen are returning here after a former residence, or belong to one of two or three special classes, including Government officials, students, travellers for pleasure, kc Moreover, the Chinese Government, in despair of being able to get from the United States any adequate protection for its subjects, has just agreed to a treaty even more severe in its exclusion than our present law On that treaty, however, an amusing faux pas was made. Senator Sherman is at once chairman of the committee on foreign affairs in the Senate, and candidate for the ItepubhcannominationforthePreaidenily He wants the "hoodlum" vote from the Pacific slope. He made a bid for it when the treaty was before the Senate by securing its amend ment, so as to make it still harder in some minor details The result is that the: treaty must now go through the long process of re consideration by both Governments, and at least a year must pass before it can go into effect Mr Sherman s amendments were of a kind to be provided for by) lady, and one of his rivals has already pointed out that they were fully met by a bill introduced by him sell, and already before the Senate 'Thus the Senator for the merest demagogy, has defeated his own end, and attended the rowdies he sought to enlist. What ever may be the case in Australia, the anti- Chinese movement in the United States has no 1 anon d Ure, except on the Pacific slope, and even there the testimony as to the effects of the presence of the Chinese is very conflict in, That public sentiment is not all one way is shown by the fact that Senator Stanford, a very wealthy man, and the leader of the Republican party in California, is out spoken in his belief that the state owes much of its prosperity to the Chinese. He employs thousands of them in agriculture and in his vast vineyards, and says he is suited with them. It is quite certain that the Pacific railroads could not have been built without them that they are an important, if not an indispensable, element in the labour of the state, and that domestic life would be almost impossible without them Certainly they have their faults, and by petty thieves and carries of violence (almost invariably between themselves, however), they furnish much too large a share of work to the police courts in New York But that they are impossible to assimilate in the body politic has not been shown. It is plain that public feeling is against them, and that they will never be allowed to gain much of a footing in this country, but it is equally plain that most of the feeling against them is of the narrowest and meanest sort, A feeling of very much the same sort has grown up, and bade strong and bad influence on legislation in several of the states, and particularly in New York, on the question of convict labour The trade unions have got it into their heads that convicts ought not to be allowed to do any work, on the ground that, if they did not, the members of the unions would have more to do A few years ago all the convicts in the three great prisons of this state were employed under contract. The contractors furnished machinery, in structure, and overseers, and paid so much per day for every able bodied convict Under this system the prisoners were kept employed, many of them learnt an honest trade, discipline was easier, and all the expenses of the prisons were paid, with a small profit to the state, and a corresponding relief to the taxpayers Under the pressure of the trade unions this system was abolished, and what is known as the " state account by s item" was substituted In this the state furnished the machinery and instructors, purchased the raw material, and sold the products as beat it could It was, of course, much more costly, but the extra cost was sheer waste, and the goods made finally went on the market in competition with other goods, the same as under the old system The trades unions perceived this, and at the last session of the Legislature opposed the appropriation of money for the expenses of the system They were successful The result is that between 3,000 and 4,000 prisoners are now idle. The state is paying nearly a million of dollars a year for their support. Discipline is necessarily difficult, and the prisoners are undergoing a process of steady demoralisation that will make them when released, far more dangerous to public order than they were before It is not a matter of theory that the opposite was often the case before Let me relate one instance that came under my personal observation A man of 30 was sent to prison for 10 years for forgery He was tried and convicted underanossumedname he was the son of wealthy and honourable patents, and revue apparently ruined by dissipation He had a wife and two children, who, left penniless, were cared for by his father The convict was a man of talent, and of good constitution Application was made by some of his friends to persuade the warden to give him some clerical work in the prison He declined, sent for the prisoner, inquired carefully into the disposition and former life, and urged him strongly to go into the foundry then run on contract in the prison He simply and effectively argued with the young man that he would thus learn an honest trade, and one he could practice on going from prison, free from his former associations and temptations The man consented In 75) years, the term being shortened by good conduct, the prisoner left prison an excellent workman, able to earn good wages To day he is at the head of a large foundry on the Hudson river, living with his family, a respected and fairly prosperous man. Had he spent the time in idleness there is no room for doubt that he would have left prison to become ft hopeless member of the criminal class 'There was a very brilliant performance of "Hamlet" the night of May 21, in honour of Mr Lester Wallack, a gentleman who has done more for the American stage than any other in the land, His father was a very successful manager, us he has been, but Mr Lester Wallack is also a very intelligent and de lightful actor of high comedy parts and of " society " roles For some 30 years he has provided a theatre with a well balanced and strong stock company, at Which little or no tragedy has been given, but at which the play and the acting have always been, not only enjoyable, but pure and healthy No stage in the United States has so often rendered the standard English dramas, and none has presented them better, if so well 'the testimonial of the 21st was purely honorary, and was a demonstration of the cordial respect and affection that Mr Wallack has won from his own profession Mr Booth played Hamlet with all his accustomed subtlety and certainty, and more than his usual spirit and fire Mr. Lawrence Barrett, who ranks next to Mr Booth, made of the ordinarily thankless role of the ghost a most impressive and touching representation. Mr John Gilbert, Mr Wallack's chief reliance in his own company, and an actor of unrivalled grace, dignity, and humour, played Pol or his Mr Joseph Jenerson took the part of the First Grave Digger in a most quaint and delightful manner Miss Rose Coghlan, another of Mr Wallack's company, took the part of the Player Queen, with telling effect. But alter Mr Booth a Hamlet, which is by far the noblest piece of art the American stage has produced, was the Ophelia of the Countess Modjeaka 'J he grace and simplicity, and pathos, of the part were not more marked than the passion and force-which are usually omitted The only rendering of the part with which that of Modjeaka can be compared is that of Miss Ellen 'J error, and in my judgment the latter is hardly so original or so beautiful, though Mian Terry has the advantage of greater natural charm of person, and many cars the advantage of age. John L. Sullivan, the bruiser, is back at home in the classic shades of Boston He had an ovation on his return, and made a HI" each, in which he only rendered it more uncertain why all) honour should be paid to him He confessed that the little English mail, Mitchell, tired him out in the rain"', and complained that the whole "gang that went out to see the light were against him. As he has heretofore based his claim to glory on the fact that he could " knock out of any living man in four rounds which however, he failed once before to do, with Mitchell-he la, of course, -a beaten man, He now talks largely) of going to Australia, where, he says, he knows he will have " fair play, but he is not likely to go. As is the case with all great men, reports vary much as to his condition and conduct, but he is probably wasting his wonderful strength in debauchery) After his reception in Boston he got drunk, went into a police station, and dared anyone to put him out. The sergeant, instead of locking him up, as he should have done, bundled him on to the side walk, whence his friends led him away to his home. If he should go to Australia any one who shall whip him, even fatally, will win the gratitude of all decent people in the United States A story has been going the rounds of the papers that a wealthy man directed his lawyer to draw a will bequeathing all his property to a scapegrace nephew, and when the law) or asked why be thus favoured one whom he so detested the old gentleman replied, "I know your profession well enough to be sure that if I leave the rascal everything be will get nothing, and have a lot of trouble in getting that" There is certainly a basis of truth for this The widow of A. T Stewart, who inherited a number of millions, died some time since leaving nearly all that was left of her property to the lawyer and confidential adviser of her self and husband, one Judge Hilton, and this gentleman is now, and has a prospect of being for years, the defendant in suits to break the will, on the ground of undue influence One cannot have much sympathy with the contestants, in bo are relations that have received in all, already nearly a million of dollars from the widow, but the evidence discloses much to show that the hue of the owner of millions is not necessarily happy, and certainly not a free one. It is plain that, on the one hand, Mrs Stewart was besieged by a little army of beggars, relatives of her own, and on the other band was gradually induced to part with one after another of her husband's business properties that invariably found their way to the judge's ownership. A very quiet and modest and benevolent old lady, she worshipped the memory and what she supposed was the character of her husband, who was in reality a very hard and cruel and mean man, and seems to have thought that she was honouring him in disposing of his property to the shrewd and grasping lawyer, who had great influence over Mr Stewart in his later years. Mr Stewart himself did little in the way of benefaction during his life, but he left, by will, a considerable sum to be expended in founding a home for unmarried women of the " Shop girl" class, of whom he employed many hundreds The "home was built under Hilton's direction, but in a few years two facts became apparent, one, that the management of the place made it utterly re- pulsive to every self-respecting young woman, and the other, that the building was beautifully adapted to the purposes of a large hotel, to which it is now converted, with Hilton as proprietor
