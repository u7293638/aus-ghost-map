The Land and Income Taxes. Mr. Want (Attorney-General) moved that the Land and Income Tax Bill be postponed nntil the other financial measures of the Government reached the Connell. Mr. Watson: Why prolong the agony? Mr. Want Baid he failed to observe where the agony came in. Mr. Piggott asked if this bill were rejected what was the nse of bringiog in the other bills ? Mr. Want said this bill merely provided the machinery to carry out the other bills. He then moved that the bill be postponed for a week. Mr. Dangar: What is the nse of postponing it for a week? There is not the ghost of a chance of the other bills arriving in that time. Mr. Davies said the whole of the principles of the taxation proposals of the Government were involved in this bill. In dealing with the measure the House would deal with the whole question. The other bills simply related to figures connected with direct taxation. Why keep the matter hanging over the heads of the public for a fortnight? After further discussion, the con- sideration of the bill was postponed foi a fortnight. The House then adjourned.
