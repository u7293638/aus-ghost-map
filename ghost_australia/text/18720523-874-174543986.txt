MORE THAN HE BARGAINED FOR. "HANS BREITMAN HAD A PARTY, WHERE IS THAT PARTY NOW?" —Mr. Duffy's taunt at the want of unity amongst the Opposition members. AH! where is BREITMAN'S party now? That party split and scattered, Not half a shirt amongst the crew, A banner torn and tattered. Ha, ha! I can't get on so well, he said, Without a party there; Will no one fight me? there's my coat, Tread on it if you dare. He, he! There's LANGTON with the Free Trade lot, And FRANCIS with the others: Why don't they join their hands and bands? Why don't they live like brothers? Ha, ha! Look at my party at my back, See my Australian flag, My order—policy—and lor! Look at your dirty rag. He, he! See how they worship at the shrine Of their ex-rebel god; See how the country "over heads" Gives me its "boohoo nod." Ha, ha? Give me a party, some one, do— A party wrong or right, A big, strong party with a head; I'm rusty for a fight, He, he! But stay—what's that I see up there? A shadow or a ghost? Why, no! it's BREITMAN coming down, And at his back a host. Ha, ha! Here's for a fight—there is my glove; And now lay on, MACDUFF, And damned be he who calls "a go! Hold off! I've had enough." Ho, ho! * * * * * Ah! where is DUFFY'S party now? That party split and scattered; Ah! where is Mr. DUFFY too, With that old hat so battered? He, he! Ah! where is DUFFY'S party now? That party he's been bilking; And where is DUFFY, "mit his flag?" Say, has he gone a milking? Ha, ha!
