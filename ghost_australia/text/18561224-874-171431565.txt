PLAYHOUSE POETRY. Vox et præterea nihil. —LATIN GRAMMAR. There is a voice that pealeth high, And ringeth shrilly clear, How often have its accents jarr'd Upon my startled ear! I've heard it in that northern hold,— The "temple-haunting martlet's home, And in the stately market-place Of old imperial Rome: In Prospero's enchanted isle; At "stormy" Elsinore; Upon the marge of ancient Nile; And by the Adrian shore. I heard it once, ere life had fled From broken- hearted Lear; And once again, when Hamlet wept O'er sweet Ophelia's bier. I heard it next when Claude Melnotte To Pauline open'd wide A husband's arms, and claim'd her as The gallant Morier's hide. I heard it when the Cardinal— The wily Richelieu rose, And, cramping Francois' packet, hurl'd Defeat at all his foes. And when the love-sick Romeo breath'd To Juliet his vows; And when the banish'd Duke went forth The dappled deer to rouse. And when old Falstaff, "hissing hot," Plunged in the "cooling surge"; And when the "princely boys" sang sooth Fidele's plaintive dirge. Ever that voice hath haunted me, Ever its accents rise Above Maria's ringing laugh, And Haller's piercing cries. These words they haunt me like a ghost That may not e'er be laid,— "Apples, or nuts, or oranges, Or sparkling lemonade."
