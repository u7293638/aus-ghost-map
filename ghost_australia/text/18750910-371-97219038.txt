THE TELEGRAM. 'Mrs. Smith, I am astonished at you!' John Smith was ' astonished ' at his wife at least once a day, on an average. Mrs. Smith was used to it. She was a tall, slight woman, scarcely more than a girl in years, with cheeks that had been as pink as sea-shells in the davs of her happy maiden life. 'Things are all at sixes and sevens,' went on Mr. Smith, tying his cravat before the mirror, and viciously twitching | it into a knot. ** Coal wasted, butter ; thrown into the grease jar, and my third- ; best coat sold to a dealer in tinware for a funnel and two pie platters. I ^ never heard of anything so outrageous in my life.' 'But, my dear,' meekly interposed the' much-enduring wife, *' we needed tbe tinware, and yon had not worn the coat for a year ; it was full of moths.' ?* Thera it is again,' said Mr. Smith. «* The moth would never have got into it if you bad, taken proper precautiena. I never heard of a moth in my mother's time. And now you are actually asking permission to visit your brother.' 'I have not been' away from home before since we .were married, John,' piteously pleaded Mrs. Smith. 'I feel almost worn out, and I think the change would do me good.' ? ? - **And what is 4» become of me?' sonorously demanded the husband. Mrs. John Smith thought of the day's excursion last week, and the trout-fishing expedition a fortnight since ; but she said nothing, except— ' ??It don't cost much to go, John. And rflonly«tayaw*y» week. Do let me eo? The -doctor say* the fresh air might help baby along with his teeth, and little Johnnie ia drooping.' * Well/' wad ||fe.

'I suppose they are at Bilberry 'Farm by this time,' said he to himself. ' I suppose the younkers are in bed, and Jenny is sitting listening totheaightin gale. I've almost a mind to go out there myself to-morrow evening 5 it would be a pleasant 'surprise'f or Jennny, and— hallo 1 what's that ? A ring at the bell ?' John Smith shuffled along to the door id his -slippers. ?-.... ?** Oh, a telegram ; now I wonder who should telegraph to me;' . I Mr. Smith carried . his buff envelope back to the parlor light, and somewhat nervously tore it open. '^o JoffiTSaBraS^Eailrdad accident: ToUr wife Tb killed, and your child dangerously hurt. Coxae by the next train. '* Jabe© Mebebtsph, M.D.*' Again and again Mr. Smith's bewildered eyes roved over the coutents of this appaHiag missive, before he could fully comprehend its dWlly meaning. 'Dead ! Killed.!' he muttered to himself. ' My Jenny killed by a railroad accident?'* ' And then, catching a railway guide from the book- shelf, he whirled over its leaves with a trembling hand. The next train did not leave the ter minus under an hour and a half. An hour and a half! To him the time seemed almost' like eternity How could he endure this awful agony of soul for an hour and a half? / 'Perhaps. Obey are incorrect,' he mut tered to himself, wiping the beads of cold sweat from his brow. 'People can't always judge exactly in such a moment of dismay. Perhaps she is only badly hurt, and I. can nurse her through it, after all. My Jenny; my loving, patient, sweet-eyed wife/' A strong sob rose up into his throat, as if it would strangle him. ' No, no, she is killed !' he gasped, as his eye fell once more on the telegram. ' Dead ! And I never can speak to her again, or tell her what a cruel, exacting brute I have been. God knows I didn't mean it, and now it is too late to make any amends. Why didn't the children go too ? ' How can I bring them up with out Jenny?'* His head drooped low in his quivering hands; a low, spasmodic groan burst from his pale lips. An hour and a half before he could get to Jenny j half an hour, then, before he could .reach the scene of the accident, and look upon her dead face. '? If I could only, live my life over again,' he cried aloud to the bare walls, while tight in his arms, he clasped Jenny's little' work-basket, with its strip. of un finished hemming— -all that was left to him of the fair, departed presence. 'If I could only speak to her just once, and ask her forgiveness for a thousand things. But now it is too late— too.late, and— — ' He stopped abruptly. : '-' ' The sound of a cab driving hastily up to the door, the reiterated jerk of the bell wire, roused him pnce more into reluctant action. \ 'John! dear John!' 'Jenny! my wife!' He stood pale and stupified, staring at her as if she were actually a ghost re turned from the regions of space and un reality. '??':' ' ? ' There has been a terrible railroad accident,' said Jenny, her voice faltering, as she laid the baby down on a sofa, and - took little jKhnny lovingly on her lap, *f& few miles beyond C ? . Three or four people were killed, but, thank God 1 we escaped unhurt. Of course, I took the first train back that I could, for I knew you would hear of it and be uneasy. And only think, dear, there was a poor mother killed, with her little babe in her; arms, and her name was the same as. mine —' Mrs. John Smith.'^ ' He pointed one trembling finger to the telegram which lay open on the table. : |lrs. Smith read it with' dilated eyes And pale lace. .- .... ,_- , , ,.,? ,\ ?-?-:?- .-.,, :;, ,: trOh, myiover^atrtrihgttt- yoniiaTe hid !' she exclaimed. ' And only to re iect it might have been me.'
