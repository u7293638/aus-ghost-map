The use '©f the -bone in the animal's ,'' economy is merely surinisecl, from the; fnot :ef :'.' feed ''being found among it. In the sperm whale, the oil of which- somewhat contradictorily commands a higher price than the ' nght ' oil, the male of the species is the largest, the average length being 45 feet,' with a girth of about 28 or. §0 feet. Thepepu liarity Of this auiriial is its head, which is square; and -massive, ia fact, as often said, ' like % tea chest,'' the under jaw being a mere Blip as compared with the bulk of the creature's head ; ;the teeth are' large, white; and regular ; in color it is dark; sandy color on ' the back,;: shddirig lighter dowhwards.i ' This whale has none of the cartilage referred tVpr6vi6iisly1aS;'-',Tyhalebone,' ;asin thejright' whale. ' The eye of ; the sperm' vWhale is, ..fromi thti. sciuareness ,of the . i head,' Bet ' bo far ' out, : that,1 though; he cap-; not jopk forward of the beam, he can com mand about 45 degrees astern; ;;or, to make it plainer, if the fish were lying head N. and; tailS., he could comtriand the 'view from' E.;tp S.E^;andfrpm:W^to:;S.W» AU theseV.fish/ taketheir ;;fopd,: principally ;' squid' of various , kinJ,tlrafc is,ihe jeliykind of fishbf the Medusa': tribe, ; by ,B wallowing the prey, ' together with' a large quantity of ' water* which is ex pelled through va beautiful, .filter ai;range ment in the'skuU, kn'awn as the blow-hole in : the right, fish.. The blow is-in two dear streams ! to some -height, falling in ; cascade, on' either side, while 'is this', sperm \the, water ia. forced out with 8uch- violence .that:it assumes theappearauce of fog;, hence a sperm whale is technically called !'f to bush,' and a right whale 'to blow;' tbu3 the masthead -cry of ''there, she' bushes,' or ^; there she blows,' is 'tiuffioiently ; distinctive for it to be known what! i cattle, they nre lowering fpr. The swallow of ,the whale is small, therefore en tirely upsetting the biblical theory of Jonah's incarceration- in a . whale's ;' belly, unless we accept ' itin the form of a miracle; but, if the prophet did. meet with the mischance and detention' indicated; like everything e'l'se bat a bishop, the' passage has suffered by translation, I . think, and ? :. the . werd whale has -been im- ?? properly substituted for' some other fish with' mbite capacious swallow. I must not, how-', ever, be ' iniBuhderstood, to make this contra diction, r in 'any; spirit of impietyj: b&t; ' must needs think that the passage is more meta phorical ; than literal. t In connection .with re ligion, I may say that, as far as the obser vance of Sunday is'corioernedj even1 in ships of the moat la!x management, no ,xirinedessary i ^ work V. is done, and, even among those keen fishermen, ;the Yankees, the fish may look in at the hawse-holes or cabin windows with impunity; on the Sabbath : as, irrespective of religious : reverence, there is a tradition, as usual with' Jaok,that a certain man who 'lowered of aSuri daystovehisboatandlostso'mehands.' The ship . should, perhaps, claim my next- attention, and I will take for example a 'four-boat ship,' the standard of capaoity generally used. She will profcably represent a tonnage, of 350, and. will be officered and manned about as follows :— Captain'; 1st, 2nd and 3rd officers; cooper (a very important functionary in the enterprise, as, next to the importance of ' catching your whale ' as Mrs Glass might say, comes, 'the saving your oil').; boat-steerers,' headsmen or hatpooners as' they are variously styled (these areialso experts, not only, in the mere catching of the fish in its various details of striking, killing and cutting-in, but in the more delicate audiarfcistio, superintendence of the try-works,' so as to be able to turn out their oil of the lbektifuipale sherry: color,, and with the. es sential bouquet ;V for,', on the principle of chaeun ,«. son gout, it- is contended by many that there is nothing so grateful to the olfac tories as a pau of cleah sperm just before it is turned out) ; about 20 (men supposed to be1 eailor-men ' that1 i8i- aq! fthe Yankees s'ayj; *4 splicers;' or in English,' A'.B.'s capable j of all. the duties of practical seamanship. I had: alnjest forgotten that ; important offioer the cook, for,' bo it understood, in'a( whaler he is'; a most responsible officer, for it often happens in the exoitement of falling in with a Bohool of whale that all the boats being down and an offi cer in each, Mr Cook will be in charge with per Itaps no one.but a sick man and a boy or two to lieop her jogging ns near as possible to the scene of the fishery. : To facilitate this, while on 'fa'. ground;' the ship is kept under merely norni-i nalaail— perhaps the topsails,- jib and spanker. o Beside these there are some mere boat hands— «' green handB' as they are termed, -and & few apprentices or boys. Some ships pick up a f ew: natives, 'Kanakas,' from the Islands in the' South Seas, who niakd excellent boatmen; but, are of no other use.1, The.shipis fitted when on !?' a ground' something differently to any other vessel ;; the' space tfsually filled by the long- boat, booms, &o.;,. is occupied! by the try works (somewhat anomalous on board a ship, a mass of brickwork for the try-pots, in which the oil is' tried-out' of the 'blubber'). 'The boats to be 'used are jslung in davits over the Bide, and the spare ?? boats, generally two in number^ are' turned «pon skids ;oyer the quarter deotf. Below, the ship'presents the usual ap pearance, fit a ship in ballast^ the ground tier feeing: casks of water by wny of ballast; and 'shppks' for further use, together with the necessary tierces -, of pork and hogsheads of ? beef , for the voyage. In most ships theie is a sort of 'tween- decks, where there are. workshop?, lathes, &o;,, in. which many, of the. men use up their time of inaotion and while away an other wise nionotonoua existence. ' The boat' and; its us draft' is the more essential part of the ship's equipment, and its various instruments ana implements of more material importance. It is generally about 24 feet long with a boam of 5 f Bet 16 inohes, well built, with bow and atom alike in build, and steered by a large utoor-oar. This,, however, in the hands of a skilled manipulator can be made uoe of as an auxiliary propelling as well a directing power. Five oars, inclusive of the 'headsman,' who pulls the ' bow,' are used. The equipment consists of say throe 'irons' (or harpoons), two lances (a sort of lighter harpoon without barbs, and consequently capable of being with drawn easily), a, tomahawk, a.knife, a mop or swab, a fin spado, a drag, and throe or four tubs containing about 150 fathoms of a fiuely made flexible lino about 1$ inches in oiroum fcronoQ, the tabs being ?distribute^ under th hwarts. . The harpoons are for fastening to he whale ;the lances, as the name imports, for deeding him in some, vital .part after, hauling ip to him ; the fi,n spade is a sharp spade-like nstrument to be thrown, at the 'tendons of the ins of a particularly: troublesome , whale pp as o disable him. TMb is an emergency weapon lot of ten used by good fishermen, who gene ?ally contrive to give the coup de grace with he lance. The tomahawk and knife are for sutting the line lif /anything goes .wiorig ;? the nop or swab is fpr wetting the bollard or ' tommy -knpptgin'' round which the linais eased iway while, the fish Jb 'rnnnhig;'' : the , drag, yhtch is a square pie. e of wood about three feet iquare, slung like a scale by the four corners, s, for the purpose of putting on with a rolling litoh on the line outside the nose of the boat, ind then the line being paid out a few fathoms t.acts as, a clog or drag; of greater retarding lower than, the boat itself; the tubs contain the ine/ coiled in very neatly ; a breaker of water ind sometimeB a tin with a few. biscuits (in ;ase of a lengthened absence from the ship) com pletes the equipment. ;To keep in this condition sven to;thotslightest minuti»8,iand' each article; 'I.Beoured',' in, its;own place,; thei ddge tools Barefuily, sharpened, oiled, and covered, being' the boat-steerer's most especial: care and con stant source, of solicitude— in fact, the boat ateerer has nothing, else to do but to see that his boat with ^ its rM craft!' as. the equipment is titled, is Jready for lowering at' any^ mo; ment. ;.'?.,,;. ?-....?? .o .h;. ?-.???'%'; }-. m :?'?- ??'?- '*;?

' Shove off 1 give way !!' Now, lads, pull till your1 eyeballs ' crack 1 ! ! Be the lucky first boat, lucky all the voyage !' ;' A bottle birum, boys, to the firat boat,' roars out 'the, old man' over the quarter, as the tough 16 feet ash oars bend under the.' exertions of the' respective crews. Away go the boats in tlie di ^ectidi of the fish as indicated by the mast head'look-but,' and-theship,' .if- prdetiteal,; is ' ',' squared away' towards them ; or if theyigd away to- windward,, she is kept close to the wind in their direction. Leaving- the ship to ? the cpok or skipper (if he ; is ' aboard) , my gentle reader,' we will, if you please, follow the fortunes of the boats. . At Giveit to her,' is , the officer's cry. 'Lay back, boys,' say all. Presently the fish is neared, and ' Stand up,' says the officer, and in comes the bow and up stands the harpooner with his 'iron' in hand and his feet in the beokets in the head sheets, his two thighs in hollows, out purposely .to afford him 'steauiment.' ' Silence' is hissed rather than spoken. A freshman, .whose ner vousness has reached a climax, is about to in dulge his inquisitiveness by looking ; round to see how. things ar* going on; when1 a choko chicken kind of a. thump in the' back . from the loom of the man's oar on the next thwart admonishes him 'more eloquently than words' not to be bo thering his head, but to' be ready. ., Sdddeiuy aisharp sound like M hiss', is heardi there is a commotion in the -water near the boat, and at the. seen- rather than; heard ** stern all,' the boa); is booked from the dangerous proximity vbf the }' gained'-: (frightened) and wounded fish.. Now is the skUl of the headsman /and officer required, to note quickly whioh way the fi^h.means to head, whether he will ' ran,' or ?'?? sound,' 'i. e., take a header, or 'mill round upon the boat'.' ' The mammal having made his seleptipn, all hands peak their bars, if the fish runs, and the harpooner holds on to him or gives him line at discretion* The flah haying exhausted its -strength j by a long jrun -or deep dive, or from loss of blood, probably lays quiet, and 'haul in line' is the word, ; it being carefully coiled away as it cornea in ; pos sifely another short run, asWund, or a ?' '? run around'! takes place before the boat is honied up to him. ? A oharjge.then is made ; the , pfllljer and the harpb'bher change, places,, the offioer coming forward to kill, and the man' who 'iitruck,'' or ' fastened' to the iish going to the steeroari.; The lance is thrown at a vital part, behind the pootoral fin if possible, and very '[ soon ' She blows thiok Wood ' tells the ' tale that the heart or some of the . larger blood-vessels have been touched, and very shortly, with something between a sigh and a grunt, the oily manster rolls over on his side ajid technically 'shows white.' After some little jubilativo, speculation as to the yield, and. breathing time, ho is takon in tow; if the ship is to leeward,' and if not, the ship at a sighti! stands down to the boat, and the fish is made fast alongside, tail foremost; and as soon as may be the, work of ' cutting in' is; commenced. ' The rationale of this portion of the Operations will be best represented' by de soribing.it as peeling him, muoh as one would . an apple, one hand using a blubber knife, and cutting down and under the slip ranch as a turf-putter does. Being got on board, it is cut into junks, and tossed into the blubber room. The head matter is bailed outby buckets through a hole cut in. the head, and put away by itself. The bone is taken out of the month, the lower jaw bone taken in, and the now use less carcase, . divestod of its buoyant element, is cast off and generally sinks. In some oases gases are generated1 in tho carcase, which bring the remains up ngain, and theBe during their brief resurreotion (as the gas soon es capes, and they again sink) have been often token for wrecks. As long as thero are any fish to bo killed or 'out in,' the tryworks are idle, but failing in fish the blubber is forked up onv deck, and one or two men sot on ' minohing,' or slioing the blubber down to tho Bkin in rashers, the fireB are lighted, and the wort of trying oufc coaimenoe and continues' : till the ' blubber-rGcm is cleared.- The oil is at a certain stage changed, or .;.I might call it decanted in to new casks and carefully stowed away. This is pretty much ther rationale of legitimate fish ing. The Americans, however^ are not so par ticular^ but vary their enterprise by' sealing and elephant (sea) hnntirig wherever '' ' prac ticable. In order to make the several 'narra- tives of incident in connection with the trade intelligible, I have given the foregoing descrip tion of men and things; ' ? ' ;- ? : . ; _.'

I involuntarily, : looked over my shoulders, aad ; sure' enough, there lay the big brute, his glazy, back,) some ?feet .out of the water. Fortes: vixere ante Aga- ? memhon, the classic .poet sings, but' I question if any of the braves, either before or since that warlike-hero, would not have experienced some^ thing like a tremor at the sudden introduction^ to the' monster of the deep,'' Aslight rpminder from oarsman No. 3, a; case- hardened; old blubbor- hiaater a with a, cemplexion ' jbetween ;a , ginger^breai nut ,and' a, Jew,' as Barham, says', from the loom of. his oar and few words' mojre.forcible than polite or .even parliamen tary from, the officer,! brought my head, in the, proper .direction, and in half a minute more the . word ' stem all 1' told all. -that the moment of peril had arrived, and^tnatTom, -had fastened., ' She means running,' said Tom, «{ hold on all you can,' replies Mr. — — -, .' peak, quick,' he added, and we were soon running; ai.:.-,the/ ' tail of a pretty fish. ii the sensation k pro 1 duoed ; by the sight of the huge beastnvas not of. the most pieaiant character, the position: of , affairs was by no meons improved by the at tachment process; the velocity at which. we; were .being towed caused the water to rise: some; feet-, on either side, and present what. : would be, under more favorable circumstances and a , safer point of. observation, a: magnificent sight. On ! on ! for a mile or so didpur fish drag, us, line only being given when necessity compelled ;. when ho came ? up forair, and wobegan to haul up to him, coiling . away the line as it came in. The fish lay . perfectly quiet, and it was generally assumed . -that he had given in, so muclii so that Mr ,', . did not go forward to kill^ but told Tom to give him a '^ set' with' the lance, which poor,.

The fish, either from pain, fright, rage, or .the, check of the line still fast to him, swam round in amongst us, the line, at one time being across the small of my back, till I, having . a wholesome fear of being cut in halves, cleared myself of it bya sprt of aquatic back sdmersault. Happily most, of us could swim, and one whose education had been neg lected in that particular,; was aided by the rest, two pars being improvised as arsort of raft under his arms which' kept .him up till , the mate's i boat - arrived and picked as up. -; , G^l16 remains of the boat were about half an hour afterwards observed and recoyered, and.on in; speclion it was found that so violent and sharp must have been the blow that she had, been cut 'down diagonally by the fore thwart almost as qlean as if cut through by a cross-cut, saw ; thanks to a clever carpenter, the same beat subsequently did good service in spite iof her first. unlucky venture. ... - :. ; . ; '-,,. A TKUE GHOSX STORY, , Sailors have in all time been superstitious, and in a whaleman, where there is much time for yarning, the weakness is largely developed. They have their lucky and unlucky oinens; and - almost every : incident which occurs is! 'read' more or less extravagantly for good or evil, and I have heard of an Ameri can .-captain determining wliioh ground ho i'ahduld make for by the dh'ection in which a,' certain pig should point his nose on a given morning ; however, ? this may or may not be true, .but! what I have to tell you is :— ^-On thej night ??. to whioh I allude — of course it must be a night story to involve a ghost — we were running down from the Gallapagos to the B[orn under a strong nor'-weater ; tho night was -wild, -and the sea exhibited 'more than usual luminousneas, throwing, as it broke in fpam ? under i either counter, threw a pale ghostly reflection on the sails and rigging. The ?men had just come down from aloft' after close ? reefing the maintopsail, under which we were running, everything having been made snng for a dirty night of it. The watch had been sent below, and the watch on deok,: with the exception of the man at the wheel and myself, as officer of the watch, were stowed away in the, most convenient sheltered spots they could findj—' look-outs,' by-the-bye, are appoint ments seldom made in whalemen, large cdnfi- ' donee being reposed in Providence, and in tho fact of their being muoh out of tho track of ships. After walking the deck some time,' my atten tion was called by the steersman to some one in the maintop, and on looking up I oould Bee the dim outline of sorao person. At the time I saw nothing remarkable in the fact, and continued my walk, but oasually looking up again some ten miuutos afterwards, I still ob Borvod tho person moving iu tho rigging ; hailing tho top and getting no answer, I asked some of tho watoh who it was aloft, bub |i)uad,strarjgetoeay, thatnoaeof tho watch wer nissing, and on an investigation, it.was found hat, to a man, no one was on deck belonging to he watch below,' and consequently speculation ffas: rife as to who' it could r be vho on such a night prefeffed / to ; make his promenade in the exposed situation where the mknown walked or moved,' ; for it, 'though 'pil- jably moving, did not seem to '-walk. The iolloquy and inquiries brought up the captain ra'd my brother' officer, neither of whom.' could 'make it out.' ; ' Gaptain hailed the fopV and :n language more forcible than polite, informed ;he 'party,' whoever it mightbe,' that there! was no requirement for -.'any '..larking' just1 ihen ; still, with nil his complement 'of men' nustered about him (the watch; !; below ' haying «' turned Out' dn: hearing' the ? singular narjra-; ;ive), he hardly knew who to' charge the' lark!1 ipon.; With an outward1' 'adherence to'tlie ?larking,' but with an inward conyidtion that ;t was a iridst mysterious affair, he ordered^ )ne of the boat-steerers; ff' man of consider-'; ible firmness of -character, !tp( ',gb up' and' see what it was. He had/ however, 'hardly got ibove the leading1 blocks when it 'was an-' aounced that it haddisappeoifed, diid itseeme'ft, probable that it would be np ' jmpre' .thoright, if, but just as thewatch wdre about to^ return'; to their blankets, anid the captain' andrniite' igain got in the cabin, there was our friend in' the top again ; the same 'dark; undefined, but ' moving body, how moving to brie sidej stop-, | ping Or returning as1 it were;' mounting' guard ! on the only available space jin the' top. The1 affair was getting serious ; 'something must be \ ibhe. ; Captain again told George' to go. aloft and see to it. George; however ', after the 3udden diaappearahoe, which gave' it'1 stiil m'ore supernatural features; declined except on terms, ' viz ', that' some oriO should ? mount the' other rigging simultaneously. After some loOking^at one another for a demonstration of ; a' volun- tary character, there was nothing for 'ft ,but. for me, as officer of the watch, to ' accept the position, and away we 'two enfants. jperdus went, certainly not in the' best heart ; 'ratlin; by ratlin we mounted, arid could now; and again- hear the remarks ''of 'those' on deck as1 to ' the mysterious one in the 'rigging. \ Cautiously,' ] I may' say neck arid neck, ..We, poked our' respective v heads through ', the ' Jubber's holes and' peered round the top.' ' Db^ you see anything ?' ' ; ' No ! dd you?' Up we' both got into the : top, and all was vacancy ! With an assumption bf sang froid I managed, through the howling of the wind;, to throw my voice down, irifo'rming them below that !, th^re was no One there.; Just at the moment aheavier squall burst over the ship; iricreasing, the heavy gloom of the night; and captain 'screamed'out, ' 'Yes there is ! wb' see three of yot in the top ! He is between you !' It has 'always been a mystery to me how either myself or .brother, ghost : detective reached the deck, arid I only know I bathe down quick, arid I belieVje Greorge presented; himself with ijjual celerity. . ' The , thirig was inexplicable! and even the pbtent ' aid of 'grog, ph!' faucd3 tb givb a'splutidn to the mystery, or to restore the' mental equi librium of the hands. Thpso bridepk huddled pretty inuch together, every now and. again stealing a furtive glance at the top, while the watch below preferred asm'oke'and 'a'yarri to turning in, ghost stories, pf course,' being pte domiuaht ia the various experieuces related. Re lieved at 'night's deep noon,' while doiDg my turnirig-in pipe,I was endeavoring; to dispose of the matter if possible to' my bwnsa'tisf action, when ' three taps of the heel' ' on the deck above me, an understood signal betweenmyself and Mr'— -^.called ; me on ! deck to find the whole mystery . explained. 'In the course of the preparation for the coming; weather we had been tightening thb tiller ropes,;' aud the lamp used in the operation havirig ' ' been left by the boy had thrown a shadow of the rriaiat the helm just above the rirnpf the top. 'The sudden disappearance when George , was going up being probably caused by'' sbmedna .'stand ing between the lamp and the steer's- ' mm. The slight iribyement of '' the helmsman in giving her wheel ' either ; pne way or the o.ther causingr the \ mover . ' ment of the shadow from side to side. 'The solution of the difficulty was, however, gene rally satisfactory. Some two or three old salts, however, still looked upon the thing as ominous of '-something,' or that there was sbniebody on board who had ' done sdmetbirig ;' or, in fact, objected to its being' referred tp.'-or ex 1 plained away upon natural causes/ anid 'if still in ^ the flefih continue to rooburit th'is ^^(sii'ppi'essing the' lantern elucidation) ambrigst tbfeif1 ghostly experiences. , . . r' ,„- .,= ?;.!,'-.
