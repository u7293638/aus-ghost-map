ODE TO TOBACCO. Thou who, when fears attack, Biddest them avaunt, and Black Care at the horseman's back Perching unseatest; Sweet when the morn is grey, Sweet when they've cleared away Lunch; at the close of day Possibly sweetest. I have a liking old For thee, though manifold Stories, I know, are told, Not to thy credit; How one (or two at most) Drops make a cat a ghost-- Useless, except to roast-- Doctors have said it. How they who use fusees All grow by slow degrees Brainless as chimpanzees, Meagre as lizards; Go mad, and beat their wives; Plunge (after shocking lives) Razors and carving knives Into their gizzards, Confound such knavish tricks! Yet know I five or six Smokers who freely mix Still with their neighbours; Jones--(who, I'm glad to say, Asked leave of Mrs J.)-- Daily absorbs a clay After his labours. Cats may have had their goose Cooked by tobacco-juice; Still why deny its use Thoughtfully taken? We're not as tabbies are, Smith, take a fresh cigar! Jones, the tobacco-jar! Here's to thee, Bacon!
