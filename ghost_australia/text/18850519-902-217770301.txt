A Haunted House. A REMARKABLE case was heard pn Febuary 21 in Dublin. Mr. Waldron, a solicitor's clerk, sued bis next door neighbour, who is a mate in the merchant service, nnrned Kierman, to recover Â£500 damages for injuries done to his house by, as he alleged, the defendant and his family. Kiernan denied the charges, and asserted that Waldrou's house was haunted, and that the acta complained of were done by spirits or some persm in the plantiff's place. Evidence for the plan'iff was to the effect that every night from August, 1884, to January, 1885, his hall door .was continually be ing knuckeil at ami bis windows broken by stones, which came from the direction of the defendant's yard. Mrs. Waldron swore that one night she saw one of the panes of glass iu the window cut through with a diamond ; a white hand was then withdrawn ; bnt 011 examining the place, she could find neither the fluger or any traces of blood. On another occasion tbe servant, hearing mysterious knocking, fell down with fright, up setting a pale of water over herself. Mr. Waldron armed himself with a rifle and revolver, and brought a detective into the honse, while several policemen watched outs id". They, however, could find noth ing. Kidman's family, on being taxed with caus ing the noisi-s, denied such was the case, and sug gested it was the work of ghosts, nnd advised the Waldrons to send for a Roman Catholic clergyman to rid the house of its uncanny occupants. A policeman swore that- one evening he saw Wal- , drou's servant, kick the door with her heels about tbe time the rapping usually commenced. Chief Justice Morris said the affair suggested the per formance of the Davenport Brothers or Maskelyne and Cooke. It was quite inexplicable from the ab sence of motive, and remained shrouded in myste rious uncertainty. The jury found for the de fendant.
