SELECT POETRY. THE VOICES OF THE WINDS. WE are the voices of the wandering wind, Which moan for rest and rest can never find i Lo! as the wind is, so is mortal life, A moan, a eigh, a sob, a storm, a strife. Wherefore and whence we eve ye cannot know, Nor where life springs nor whither life doth go j We are as ye are, ghosts from the inane; What pleasure hare we of our changeful painP What pleasure hast tliou of thy changeless bliss P Nay, if loTe lasted, there were joy in this; But life's way is the wind's way i ell these things Are but brief voices breathed on shifting sitings, O Maya's son! because we roam the earth Moan we upon these strings ; we make no mirth, So'many woes wn see in many lands, So many streaming oyes and wringing hands. Yet mock we while wo wail, for, could thoy know This life they cling to is but empty show J 'Twere all as well to bid a cloud to stand, Or hold a running river with the hand. But thou that art to save, thine hour is nigh ! The sad world waiteth in its misery, The blind world stumbleth on its round of pain ; Bise, Maya's child! wake! slumber not again ! We are'tlie voices of the wandering wind ! Wander thou, too, O Prince, thy rest to find j Leave love for love of lovers, for woe's saVe, Quit state for sorww, and deliverance raitke. So sigh we, passing o'er the silver strings, To thee who know'st not yet of earthly things So say we; mocking, as we pass away, These lovely sha lows wherewith thou dost play, â€”EDWIK ABSOID in " The Light of Aria."
