SHAKESPEARE MODERNISED. The present popularity of boxing contests, and the large houses they invariably draw, suggest/ much to the theatrical experimen talist (says a writer in the Natal "Mer cury"). "Shakespeare spells bankruptcy," so runs the stage proverb. Now, if some 19th century Bard of Avon were to re-write "Hamlet," so that the swords and the pol eon cup could be done away with, the in terest in this somewhat sombre play might be revived. The spectacle of Mr. Joseph Ashman as Hamlet, coming on the stage with 4oz gloves to have a set-to with Clau dius, when he starts in to "perserver in ob sti-nate condole-ment," while the ghost acted as referee, would draw full houses. Or again, In the grave scene, he could quar rel with the first grave digger, who could do a comic boxing act with a pair of mealie bags as gloves. Hamlet could knock him Into the grave, while Leartes would throw up the sponge. Then, Hamlet taking up a loaf of bread, made to look like a skull, would say, "Alas! poor Yorilc. I fought him. Horatio. There is the fracture in his skull where I knocked him out in two rounds."
