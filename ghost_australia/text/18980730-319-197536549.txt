Mysterious noises, says nn English contem porary of recent date, which are said to oc cur nightly at Bayluill Manor IIouso on Lord Camden's estate nt Fombury, a smull village on the outskirts of Tuubridgc Wells, have caused intense excitement for miles around. The old manor, with its moss growu roof, Its broken doors and windows, Its old moat, can be traced back to the reign of King John. For several weeks past persons residing In the imnicdlutc neighborhood have been startled by uncnrthly noises and groans, and muny of the villagers have been heard to de clare that they have seen ghostly llgurcs walking about. Such hns been the sensation caused in Tuubrldgo Wells that a number of well-known gentlemen have visited the house aud heard what they believed to be "true spirit noises." The Investigators were arm ed with heavy sticks, and for upwards of an hour awaited the llrst sound which was to signalise tho presence of ghosts. According to the story told by one of them, they were straining eye and ear, when suddenly n rumbling noise like the dragging of some heavy body across tho floor broke the alienee of the night. One or two of the explorers were paralysed with fear, but the rest were sufficiently courageous to enter the house. In the cellar below there wns a succession of thudfl, followed by groans, and the result was that tho party beat a lmsty retreat. Visits have been -made to tho house by other parties, who . linve reported the groans as terrible. Meanwhile the vlllnge Is besieged dally by visitors from all parts of the county, nnd several men linve been posted rouud the ruins to prevent damage being done.
