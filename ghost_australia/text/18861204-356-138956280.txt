SELECT POETRYI. The Lost Horizon. STooD at evening in the crimson air: The trees shoak off their dusky twilight glow; The wind 5ookup old burdens of despair, And moaned like Atlas with his world of woe. Like the great circle of a bronzed ring, That clasped the visions of the vanished day, I saw the vague horizon vanishing Around me into darknes, far away. Then, while the night came fast with cloudy roar, Lo, all about me, rays of hearths unknown Sprang from the gloom with light unseen before, And made a warm horizon of their own. I sighed: , The wanderer in the derert sees Strange ghosts of summer lands arising, sweet With restless waters, green with gracious trees Whose shadows beckon welcome to his feet. "For erst, where now the desert far away Stretches a wilderness of hopeless ,and, Clasping fair fields and sunburntharvests, lay Tihe heavenly girdles of a fruitful land." I thought of a sweet mirage now no more: Warm windows radiant with a dancing flame Dear voices heard within a happy door A face that to the darkness, lighted, came. No hearth of mine was waiting, near or far; No threshold for my. coming footstep yearned To touch its slumber; no warm window-star, The tender Venus, to my longing burned. The darkened windows slowly lost their fire, But shimmered with the ghostly ember. light : A wanderer, with old embers of desire, The. lost horizon held me in the night.
