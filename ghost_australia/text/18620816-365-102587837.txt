POETRY. SITTING BY THE FIRE. AN OLD MAN'S REVERIE. Barren age, and withered world ! Oh ! the dying leaves, Like a drizzling rain, Falling round the roof, Pattering on the pane ! Frosty age, and cold, cold world ! Ghosts of other days Trooping past the faded fire, Flit before the gaze. Now the wind goes soughing wild, O'er the whistling earth ; And we front a feeble flame, Sitting round the hearth ! Sitting by the fire, Watching in its glow, Ghosts of other days, Trooping to and fro ! Oh ! the nights — the nights we spent, Sitting by the fire, Cheerful in its glow, Twenty summers back — Twenty years ago ! If the days were days of toil, Wherefore should we mourn ? There were shadows near the shine — Flowers with the thorn ! And we still can recollect Evenings spent in mirth — Fragments of a broken life — Sitting round the hearth ! Sitting by the fire, Cheerful in its glow, Twenty summers back — Twenty years ago ! Beauty stooped to bless us once ! Sitting by the fire, Happy in its glow, Forty summers back — Forty years ago ! Words of love were interchanged, Maiden hearts we stole ; And the light affection throws Slept on every soul ! Oh ! the hours went flying past — Hours of priceless worth ; But we took no note of Time, Sitting round the hearth ! Sitting by the fire, Happy in its glow, Forty summers back — Forty years ago. Gleesome children were we not ? Sitting by the fire, Ruddy in its glow, Sixty summers back — Sixty years ago ! Laughing voices filled the room ; Oh, the songs we sung, When the evenings hurried by — When our hearts were young, Pleasant faces watched the flame — Eyes illumed with mirth — And we told some merry tales Sitting round the hearth ! Sitting by the fire, Ruddy in its glow, Sixty summers back — Sixty years ago ! Barren age, and withered world! Oh ! the dying leaves, Like a drizzling rain, Falling round the roof — Pattering on the pane ! Frosty age, and cold, cold world ! Ghosts of other days, Trooping past the faded fire, Flit before the gaze ! Now the wind goes soughing wild, O'er the whistling earth ; And we front a feeble flame, Sitting round the hearth ! Sitting by the fire, Watching in in its glow, Ghosts of other days Trooping to and fro. — Henry Kendall.
