Yet I hesitated to truBt to ohance, and to havje my name' publicly connected with Stevena'a death was a thought that was absolutely intolerable to me. What would Minna think? Would Bhe believe that I had first offered' 'to '-help the man to esoapo, and that his reply had been a. second and more open attack on my life ? I went back to my dead enemy, and made a final- effort to revive him, and then I accepted the fact of his death.' I felt heartily Borry for Stevens ; he, too, had. loved* Minna, and in his own rough way had done his best to win her affec tion. ^ What if he had begun by robbing her— the robbery had. been committed when he was in ignorance of the fact of her existence. At the time a knowledge would not have altered his original plans; but it must be conceded that the moment he leal nt that the girl, was young- and unmarried, lie offered to share his, ille- gitimate gains with the rightful owner. It was a grotesque settlement of the ques tion,', but it was the best he could think of ,.,and in Jiis ? crime jnisted; eyea -was ;ad^ mirab'le enough! . «.V 0 ?Was he so, very muchT-?ifferent from. the great :hi8ifcorieal ? robberB -and - pir'atM - we used; to worship in pur ohildish^day^-j'Ke certainly had'lacked' the^fascinatibn^bf-a' possible.Dick Turpin,; ora Claude Duval, ? or the exquisite' courtliness of our own great, robber .FreeneyV'f'but divested of their balo'of romance,1 Iwere those geritlja-J men1 not' reallymobe1 criminal/ and' dm-' reputable-than'h'e?'' !?'»''? ..w/-n .;i«; ,', .« ..-;: : j Nowthat.-he waB|dead,:iit:occurred to me that he would have made just as.re-. speotable a county- squire, and. magistrate', as nine-tenths of our agricultural mag nates, and /.the probability was that his'( past was not, one ?', whit . more , tarnished : than that of many of the city Lotharios who were at that moment/aspiring to the 'pbsitioni.of 1 Minnals, suitor elect. ;.; ;' /,;?!/; ? i But those melancholy and' futile; medk. tations could not last much longer.! iThe sun was rising higher and . higher, and swiftly melting away all the mprninerrdew1; mists. -The song of the larks broke olearly; on -the: silence, and the- sleepy sea was beginning to stir restlessly: under the lash of a freshening breeze.
