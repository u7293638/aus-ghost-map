SWALLOWING AN OYSTER ALIVE. ?At a late hour .the - other . night tie door of an oys*er house m'our citv was thrust open, and in stalked a hero from the Sucker '.Starts. ;? ' He waB quite b»x feet high, spare, gonrewhat sJoopet?, « i;h a hungry anxious countenance, and tii3_ hands pushed clear' down to the ~ bottom of his breeches pockets ; his outer cover ing was hard to de6he, but after survey- . ing it minutely we.caine to the conclu sion that his suit had been made in his boyhood, of a dingy yeljow linsey wolsey, and that having sprouted up with as ? tanishisg rapidity, ha had beea forced to piece it out with all colours in order - to keep pace with his' body? In spite of -= his exertions, however, he had fallen into arrears about a foot of the necessary length, and consequently stack far through his expresses. His crop of hair was surmounted by the funniest iittle; i-seafakin,. -e*p imaginable. After . taking a positk)B-he indulged in a long stare at 4he maa opening the bivalves, : and slowly ejaculated-— ' Isters ?'. : 'YeB, sic,' responded tha attentive speaker, ' and fine ones they are, too.' .*? Welli I'Ve heerfl -''of isteri *fore,' said be, u but tbis is the fust time 1're eeen 'in, and perhaps I'll know whet thar made of afore I get*out of town.' Having expressed his desperate inten tion, he approached the plate ani scru tinized the uncased shell-fish with a gravity 'which would have- done honour to the most illustrious searcher into tha hidden mysteries of nature. ? At length he began to soliloquise on the J&imcuky; of getting them out.' - .... -; '.... ' I never 6eed anything hold en bo— takes «n amazin'-eite of ecrewing boss, to get 'em out, and aint they slick and elip'ry when they does oome? I'v.ea good mind to gire that feller lodgin', jis to realise the effects,, as Uncle Jess used to say abopt, speculation.' 11 Well, Bir,' was the reply, 'down1 with' two bits, and you can have a. dozen. :; . . ' ' Two bits,' exclaimed the Sucker. ' No Wj come, that's seeking- it .on, rite . strong, boss, for isterfl. . .; A dozen- on ?. 'era aint no bin' to a chicken, ana* there's no ©ore'n a picayubne apiece for them. I've only .realised forty-five picayunnes on my first ventur* to St. Louis. 1»11 tell you what, I'll, gin you two chickens for a dozen, if you'll con-r; clade^to deal.'' ? A wag who was standing 'by, in dulging in a dozen, winked to theatten-' daht to sell out, and the offer was ac cepted. 'Now mind,' repeated the speaker, 'all fair— ^-t wo chjekens fora dozen— you're a witness, mtBter,' turning at the _ 8)i ma tinie to ^ the wag; (t cone of your tricks,- for IVe heard tnat Borne of yoo ^oity i-feU«^s; are* 'uiighty slippW coons.' ': The bargain being fairly understood, our Sucker squared himself for the out set, deliberately put off his s*al skin, tucked up bis sleeves, and, fork in hand, awaited tbe appearance of number one. It camr— he Baw — and quickly it was bolted J A moment's dreadful pause ensued. The wag qroppei his knifo and fork with a mingled look of amuse ment. Jind . horror — something akin to ?Shakepcare'ff Hamlet on seeisg hit daddy's ghost — while be burst into ex clarnatiqn— ; ' . 'Swallowed alive, as I am * Chris tian 1' Oar Sucker hero bad opened bis mouth frith pleasure before, but now it stood open. . Fear— a Jiomd dread of he didn't know what— a conBciousnesa that all was not right, and ignorant of. the extent of the wrb»g — tbe un certainty of the moment was terrible. Urged to desperation he faltered out — ' What on earth'fl the row ?' *? Did you swallow it alive ?'' inquired the wag. -..i , ' Swallowed it jist ap he gin it to me !' shouted the Sucker.
