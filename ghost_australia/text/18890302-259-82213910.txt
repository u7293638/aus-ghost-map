A Haunted Gallery. There is a mysterious haunted gallery connecting the old " Queen's apartments" with the royal cliapel. The gallery is haunter), it in said, bj' tlie shrieking ghost of Queen Cathe rine Howard. The Queen was a fascinating deceitful, delightful little creature, who had been sadly ncg lcctcd in her youth and corrupted by debasing companionship, but full of the delight of life and shrinking sensitively from every touch of pain. Yesterday she had been the petted toy of her cruel husband; to-day she was doomed to the fearful fate that awaited Harry's discarded wives'. In the horror of her position, eur rounded by rougli and brutal soldier/? of the King's guard, she fonnd a I momentary chance of escape, and' rushing through the long gallery, ran to seek her husband, who was nt that moment hearing mass in the chapel, to cling to his kir es, to soften with her tears that heart of adamant. The guards at theit utmost speed followed the poor distracted creature just as she reached the King's closet they overtook her and dragged her back, hpr frenzied screams re-sound ing through the palace. The gallery | is now used as u kind o( lumber room, but still the shrieks of the agonised Queen are to be heard at times. Anyhow, in Ernest Law's interesting volume, "Hampton Court in Tudor Times," there is recent testimony to that effect.
