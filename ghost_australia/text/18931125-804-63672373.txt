A RELIC OF THE PAST CENTURY. About three miles from the old town of The old Military Guard-house on the Parramatta-road. Parramatta, on the road leading to Sydney, there has stood since the year 1791 a prim, quaint, octagonal little structure, which has stood the time test of upwards of a century, and has been the dumb witness of the many stirring events connected with the life and times of early Australia. One of the old military guard-houses attached to the conr viet salt pans, and the first to give evidence of the incoming of the brick industry in the young settlement, is the place referred to. The illustration above shows the time-worn appearance . of the building prior to its demolition a few days ago. Legend . tells, with a keen interest, of its active connection wdth the military authorities and the wretched convict element that was suffered by Britain to taint the. fresh, young country over a century back. It claimed to be the first brick structure in Australia ; it boasted, with a questionable pride certainly, that its threshold had been crossed by the famous convict-historian George Barrington, and the .notorious Maurice Frere-of Marcus Clarke's vigorous story " For the Term of His Natural Life"-Captain Price. Within it the first Governor, snare of form but in dis cipline stern-the illustrious Philip-stood and awed sentry and convict alike. Up to Fitzroy's time it claimed succeeding Governors as casual, or required, visitants. For the last quarter of a century it has en- joyed an unenviable reputation. Like the Fisher's ghost episode, credulous folks have, by virtue of superstitious mouthings, be- lieved it to be haunted by spooks, and reference to it still exists thereabout to terrify a refractory nursery into submission.
