THE TANTALUS ROUND TABLE. BRISBANE SCHOOL OF ARTS. By VBISONIWAI. Tho "Liottcrs and Tournai of W Stanley Jovons " edited by his wifo, will prove both interesting and saddening to many readers interesting because it is tho record of the life work of one of tho most highly talented and honest of Britain s sons of later yoars, and saddening because it will bring to mind tho loss which bcionco suffered when Stanley Jovons lost hw life by drowning at Buiver hythe, near Hastinga, on tho 12 ch of August, 18S2 Jivons carno of honour able and talented ancestry, his father was of good and able LTuitaiian stock, his mother was the eldest dau"htor of William Roscoo, who will bo known to some as tho author of tho ' Life of Lorenzo do Medici" and of the "Lifoand Pontihcato of LBO X " To some it may be as it was to mc, an enlighten ment to learn that levons spent somo timo in Australia At tho age of I8 he was appointed aasayer to the then new Mint and on the 29th of June 1854 he sailed for Sydney in the Oliver Lang. For nearly two years he re mained in this part of tho world. While in Sydney he lived on Church Hill and afterwards at Annandale Cottage, at Petersham, on the Parramatta Road. His letters from Sydney are very interesting. One of them contains an account of the terribly disastrous wreck of the Dunbar, which occurred while ho was living in Sydney. He went home by way of America, and many a time he, as many anotbci has done when amid tho smoke and mud and murk of London, thought regretfully of the bright skies of Australia '1 ho remainder of tho voluino relates the wonderful work ho did during tho runaindor of his too short life That he has left a permanent, a most abiding mark m tho literary and scientific world, particularly in the domains of Logic and Political Economy, I need spill no luk to prove He died boforo ho had completed his 47 th year-ata pi nod when his fa mo, already great, was grandlv greaten ing , at a timo when his domestic joys wore will rounded and his modest worthfulncas among his fellow mon had como to be highly valued.

Dr Samuel Annesley, wifo of the Rev Samuol Wosloy, mother of John and Charles Wcaloy, and of sovonteon othor children, was no ordinary woman-you may safely accopt my word for that If you have the ghost of tho shadow of a doubt about it read this book, and I warrant you that by the time you close the book, having worked your way through it, you will say she was a woman of genuine grit This book 13, as noted abovo, written by Eliza Clarke, who, judging from tho following words in tho preface, belongs in some way to tho Wesley stock -" I was delighted with tho opportunity of writing her momoir, and havo done so with tho sympathetic admiration natural to one m whose veins runs some of her blood, however much diluted " Mrs Clarke starts with tho principio that so marvellous a man as John Wesley muat havo como of a stock in whoso records " there aro suro to bo foroahadowinga of tho coming prophet, priest, or seer," and as "boys usually reproduce vividly tho charac tonstics of thoir mothers, so m Susanna Wesley wo should seek tho hidden springs of the bound- less energy and grasp of mind that made her son stand out so prominently as a man of mark among his follows"-in Susanna Wesley's life and character theso springs aro sought-and found. Susanna was tho twenty fifth and youngest child of lier father, Dr. Samuol Annesley, a libei al, large minded man , and was herself, as I have intimated above, the mother of nmo toon children-a bumper quiver full ' So far as worldly wisdom went, and tho faculty of tho management of men and of money, Susanna Wesley was a better man than Samuel Wesley, her husbsnd , while in tho matter of general mtolligencs and i-ound sense, she was his quite w orthy mate Her life was as full of troublo and unmistakable hardship as her homo waa full of children , but she as bravely boro the former as she wisely and woll-tramed the latter-bolievo mo, she waa "a brick1' She was a woman of strong roligious feoling and principio, although, by tho way, she did not accept tcototahsm (that will bo a puzzlo to somo of my friends who look upon the latter as a necessary consequence, if not tho pre requisite, of tho former), as may bo seen from her letter to her oldest- gon, "Sammy," thon at Westminster School, p 59 She had strong political feeling She ovor acknowledged the Divine right of "the King over the water," in other words, remained a Jacobite, and did not accopt William She was a good mother, and had an educational system which, as recorded in chapter hvo of this Life, might bo advan- tageously contemplated by many a mother nowadays In fact, this clear capital story of Susanna Wcaloy'a hfo confirms the idea I have long hold, that she was ono of the most re- markable womon of tho last, or any, century, I was somewhat surprised, and more than a little pleased, to learn that Charles Vojboy, who has shown pluck and brain enough to bo a first claas heretic, is a descendant of Susanna (Sukoj), tho second daughter of Mrs Wesloy, the steel is not gono out of the sturdy stock y ot As a clew, compact, mattorful book, this "Susanna Wcaloy" is quito worthy of tho excellent series of which it is a member " Tho Truo Story of Mazeppa," " The Son of Peter tho Groat," and " A Change of Reign" aro the threo pieces which together make up this book of near -iOO pagos, by Viscount E Melchior do Vogue, translated from the French by James Millington Tho first purports to bo a reduction to sev ero and sober fact of tho story of Mazeppa-a story hitherto, so far as wo British aro concornod, thanks to Lord Byron, largely legendary Byron road a dozen lines or so in ono of Voltairo's volumes, and his intenso imagination clothed the character spoken of in those lines with tho form and colour by which sinco his day the British folk have known lum Victor Hugo, by his " Oriental," occomphshed tho same thing for the Trench Our present author Drofesses to divoat the character of all that is mere fiction, and placo it before his readers as mero his torical fact Tho second picco is tho story of the treason and the tragic fate of the Taaro vitch Alexis, son of Peter tho Groat, and tho third tho succession of Paul I to Catherine Ii , tho story of which is in no way wanting in tho wild weirdneaa which is so frcquontly to bo found in matters royal in the Russian Empire. The usual monthly meeting of the Brisbano Branch of tho Australian Natives' Association was hold in the Oddfellows' Hall, Charlotte Btreet, on Wednesday ovemng, Mr, W Pearso, vice president, m tho chair. The attendance was considerably below tho average. Four gentlemen were nominated for membership - threo benefit and one honorary memhor The report of the An niversary Committee was received, and showed that tho excursion had resulted in a small proht to the society. It was decided to send a lottcr of thanks to Mr. Wassoll for his kindness in placing the Reformatory buildings at the disposal of the association, and to forward a couplo of cases of fruit to the boys at the Reformatory. The adjourned dobato on " Protection v. Free trado" was then proceeded with, and quite a number of members took part. By far tho greater number, however, took their stand for protection, and on a divi- sion being taken a substantial majority voted that protootion, or rathor that a protective policy, is better than than that of free trade. Songs, readings, and recitations will form tho programmo for next meeting. There was an exciting contest at Ludlow last month between tho two celebrated Heroford bulls Goodboy, belonging to Lord Coventry, and Maidstone, belonging to Mr. H. W.
