What shall we do with the remains?' In reply a cheque was sent for £20, with ! the request : ' Bury them.' The young man pocketed the money snd \ had an elaborate spree. When in condition ! for writing he sent his father the following note : . 'I have just learned that an infamous j sooundrel named Barker sent you a fictitious \- account of my death, and swindled you out of i £80. He aho borrowed £ 10 from me and left tbe country. I write to inform you that I am ?till alive and long to see the parental roof again. I am in somewhat rednced circum stances, the accumulations of the last five yean having been lost— a disastrous stock speculation— and if you would only spare me ?- £40 I would be very thankful for your favor. Give my love to aJL' A few days later the canning youth re j oetved the following dignified letter from his \ outraged patent : i 'My Dear Son —1 have buried yon once, \- and that is the end of it I decline to have any transactions with a ghost.— Yours in the 1 flesh,— Father.
