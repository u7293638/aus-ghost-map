On Friday, the 6th of August, theCentenary of Daniel O'Connell will be celebrated, a#»ong other things by a concert of national music, in the Town- hall, and on the night following the Rev. C.' Clark will lecture upon another Irishman, that 'is to say, upon Oliver Gold emitb, whose name will live in the'love of all English-speaking hearts while the lan guage shall continue to be spoken. . The Metropolitan Liedertafel give a "grand concert" at the Town-hall on Saturday, for the purpose of raising a fund to defray the cost of their hand. Considering the popularity of. this society, the attendance is sure to he numerous. ' The list of performers includes Miss Christian, whom everybody likes, Mrs. Cutter, SignorRosnati, and Signor SuflnL The programme is an extremely well-selected one, and has in it among other pieces two trios respectively from Verdi's " Attila" and Doni zetti's "Lucreria Borgia." The organ will be used as an accompaniment to some of the choruses, and considering what tire Lieder tafel chorus can do, and what thegieatorgan can do, and that one chorus is the Rataplan from "Les Huguenots," tire result may be readily imagined, In Sydney there has been a musical festival for the relief of the sufferers by the late foods on the Garonne. At the afternoon concert, in the Exhibition- building, the, LyBter opera company assisted, and Miss Alice Wooldridge's singing of " Non e ver" is spoken of as a notable feature on the occa sion. Miss Winston, MisB Thompson, and Mr. Beaumont were also in high favour, M. Blondin has written out by the last mail that he contemplates leaving Europe 'for Australia in August, and that he will bring with him some novelties, though what these are to he he does not say. Of Madame Ilma di Murska, who has just arrived, I hear from trustworthy sources that she has powers which merit the title of won derful. Her voice has sometimes been de- scribed as an acrobatic voice; that is to say, she can perform astonishing feats with it, running up to F in alt. and flying down to Heaven knows what depth in the scale, with the utmost facility. As she is shortly to ap- pear in this city, we shall soon have an opportunity of testing these powers: She comes with a reputation which, unlike some reputations, is not one which exists only on ..paper,..,, . . , A Hew Zealand (Wellington) paper assures me that Mr. Darrell is an actor of promise, hut that he cannot play Hamlet, and that he introduces much new business which is not calculated to improve the general effect of the character; that Mr. Hoskins'a Ghost fulfils all that can be done in the part; that Mrs. Darrell's Gertrude and Mrs. Hill's Ophelia "approach perfection;" that our old friend Burfurd ag the King is "effective, though a trifle exuberantthat Mr. Hydes >s. "as funny a First Gravedigger as. conlcfbe desiredand Miss Anstead "a pretty Oaric,'' Ih'tbe iBame journal I road of Mr. Darrell's Othello,fhat his "actions were of. a very . antic description, and spme of the positions intO wbich he threw himself scarcely human." I find also that on the 9th iast Mis. Darrell's "benefit took place, when rihe .'played Rppieo to Mtys ColyiOe's Jsliet, and that when the latter lady came forward at the end of the piece, she and, fell heavily upon the stage/ From "the same source I learn also that the Fakir of Oolii was enjoying full prosperity and . teirupted popularity in thatcfty at that date.
