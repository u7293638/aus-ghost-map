Titbury's Turkey. CHAPTER I. Mr. Titbury, having received his quarter's 1 salary, considers how he shall spend his Christ mas. A bright idea strikes him-he determines to buy a turkey ; and for that purpose proceeds to Sydney market, where he finds various speci mens of the bird. He rejects one as too large, another as too small, a third looks tough, a fourth seemR bony. At length he selects one that he thinks will suit, and he con veys it home in triumph, and afterwards smokes a com placent pipe, as one who has taken a step in the rii^ht direction. In the meantime his landlady prepares the turkey for the spit, and in the course of the evening Mr. Titbury returns from hiB dub slightly excited, and insists on stuffing the turkey himself, which his landlady declines to permit, and politely orders him to bed, where he naturally fallB asleep; and the ghost of the turkey appears to him, which causeB Mr. Titbury to clutch his pillow in some alarm. Whereat the turkey attempts to pick out Mr. Titbury's eyes, and a frightful combat ensues.
