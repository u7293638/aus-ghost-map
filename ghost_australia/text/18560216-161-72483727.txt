A GIIOST STORY; OR, SUPERSTITION AND ITS FOLLIES. (Founded on Pact.) S the belief in GHOSTS and GOBLINS is very common in this, as indeed it ever has been in all countries "where Education has liot stepped in to disarm the ignorant of such absurdi ties, we here give a tale founded on facts which really occurred some years since*1-that may read the believers in such imaginary existences a valuable les son. My uucle, by whom I was Teared from my boyhood, was a very kind and indulgent man; almost to a fault. He had a variety of good qualities which en deared him to all who knew liftn. Scru pulous in all his transactions,-honest and upright, punctilious to the extreme in business; in all matters of order strictly attentive, a kind friend to all is need, but yet of a singula nervous tempera ment, and so unsuspicious of the truth and honesty of others, that he was easily . imposed upon, and readily devoured auy legend and tale handed down by tradi tion or recorded in print. A Ghost story was his delight, and he would listen with thrilling wonder to narratives of Goblins . with intense interest. One frosty night, when the wood em bers of the farm house fire was burning with fancied images;-of a horse,-a calf,-a hng, and various other forms, coming and going as the fresh coals van ished and* relighted-his old steward a tried a faithful servant (as if on purpose to Wiffuse'him) said, "[Lor,. Master look at them'funny c6als ifc the -fire do you believer- that spirits of the dead rove about? See, there's a horse's head; just like> our Black Bess ;-and see there that's the very image of Missus's goat that died or was killed last harvest." Believe in them ! James, to be sure I do. On my word I see them too-and, look, it has changed tothe shape of a dog. I'll bet my life we shall yet learn 'twas tlie dog of that rascally neighbour that wor ried it. Yes, answered the Steward, I believe so too. This puts me in mind of a story I beard when I was a boy. Turning to me, his nephew, my uncle asked with marvellous delight, if I did not think too-that the Ghosts of'the dead walked to warn the living? 'Ire plied that I had no faith in any such things, for my father had taught me theie could not be such things,-that God would never permit spirits in human form to toll of the past, or foretell tho future of bis heavenly will and design of bis creatures; and that it was wicked to put faith in such nonsense. This ready reply by DO means pleased either my uncle or his steward; and to warn mc of their contempt of my remarks a Variety of foolish tales were narrated one after the other by both of them. These I listened to, but I must say with incredu lity-'as the inventions of oid women. I had but just returned from Cambridge on my Christmas vacation, and as I had heard similar subjects discussed pro and con, I determined on hazarding the result of a story that should ridioule theie opinions. My uacle in anxious expectation, sat and whiffed his pipe, whose blue columns rose up the chimney in rapid succession. The church clock had just struck 12, and at the last peal from its heavy ham mer, I thus began.
