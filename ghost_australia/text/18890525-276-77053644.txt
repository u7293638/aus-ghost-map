Old Devices of Photographers, There axo various waya for providing sur prising roaulta in photography, things that in one ago would hava been oalltd magic, but in oux'd recognised as Bcientilio trioka. Thu ghost picture, for instance, in which a shadowy ghost-through which material objects wo visible-ia a ten between natural attitudes and occupations. Tlmfc ia produced by an almost instantaneous exposure of the figure that ia to do duty as tho ghost, fol lowed by a full f.xpoauro of the figures and properties that tuo to appear natural. Another novel trick was shown recently in a photograph reproduced by a prominent trade journal; which presented theproprietor seated at ft table, playing oheas with himBelf, Bitting on the opposite eido of the table,while be, himself, stood up in the background looking at his two nclves playing. The figures were all on the negative, whioh waa produced by the succeesivQ exposure of the plafco, parte thereof beiDg masked each time by a ulack velvet shutter. Scill another sort ol trick ia that by which a person who likes thai; sort of thing may ap pear to bo photographed riding upon a fly ing g00B0, or a iish, or any other deeired style of ridiculous locomotion. Thin is done by the subject holding upon his lap p. huge pioco of white or sky.tinted card with the fanoiful ilguvo drawn upon it. Hisfauo appeara above the upper edge of tho card, i nd soerns, in the picture, joined to tho funny little body mounted on tho gooso or flih. The etatuo pioturq io made by about tho aarno devite.
