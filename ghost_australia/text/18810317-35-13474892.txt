Le Patoure. They left Sydney 18th August, 1879 ; arrived at Newcastle and Lambton 19th August ; returned to Newcastle on the even- ing of the 19th August ; left Newcastle for Sydney 22nd August; arrived in Sydney 23rd August, Thovtookup their quarters at the hotel at Lambton, and the Great Northern Hotel at Newcastle.

Tho vouchers were forwarded from the Artillery Brigade Office on the 26th Aujcust 1879, and the money was paid in November, 1879 , Mr BAKER said, m answer to Mr Fergusson, the state I of public business will not permit the introduction of an i amended Mining Act this session Sir HENRY PARKES, in answer to Mr Abigail, who asked,-"Does the Colonial Secretary intend to make pro- vision m the new Licensing Bill for the examination by qualified msjpectors of all liquors sold m public-houses throughout the colony i" said I cannot at this moment say whether anv such provision as this will be introduced into the Liconaing Bill but I may state that at the present time the police very frequently take samples of liquors from public-houses, and submit them to the Government analyst that, in fact, Mr "Watt has just sent in his examinations of several samples of liquors so taken I may state further that in every instance up to this point, though these samples have been taken fiom public-houses in obscure neighbourhoods, supposed to be the most likely placei for bad liquors to be sold, no ingredient has been found upon which a proseoution could lie Mr LACKEY informed Mr Trickett that it would not be possible to complete the tramway from Randwick Asylum to Coogee Bay now, without withdrawing the men and plant now employed on the Randwick extension Mr SUTTOR gave Mr Fergusson information with regard to the mail service between Glen Innes and Vegetablo Creek Mr LACKEY said, m reply to Mr Camoron, who asked for Mr O'Connor, the duties of night officers in charge of stations on the Western lineare -Attending to the passing of train», the working of signals, and assisting the ¡ruards of goods trains while shunting, also attending to the work- ing of staff and ticket system Ihey average twelve hours on duty, but the duties are light- indeed little more than nominal Inquiry will be made, and if it be found that relief is necessary in any particular case it will be afforded, but it would not be possible to limit tho hours of attendance to eight hours on the railway the hours of actual work do not as a rule exceed, even if they amount to eight hours at the present time. MESSAGE FROM THE GOVERNOR Mr. SPEAKER read a message from his Excellency the Governor, in accordance with the 54th clause of the Con- stitution Act, recommending for the consideration of the House an accompanying estimate of expenditure on account of services proposed to be defrayed out of the surplus revenue account. Also another message, recommending consideration of an accompanying estimate of expenditure on public works for 1881, to be provided for by loan. Order was made for the messages to be printed PAPER Mr. WISDOM laid on the table a copy of "A Rule of Court."

In other cases the Government would be placed at a great disadvantage if itweie made known that thev were purchasers, but caretul examinations would bo made m all cases Mr FITZPATRICK said ho was not disposed to com- mit to any Government whatever a large sum of money for expenditure without the House knowing anytnmg about it and ho could not see why this Pailm mont should divest itself of large sums of monoy, and let the Government pick up land without guidance or principle The whole community was desnous of getting these places of îecreation, and it was desirable to secure them on proper terms, but he was not prepared to give £100,000 to any Government without explanation, and 6hould move the reduction of the estimate by this amount Mr M'ELHOIsE said he was not disposed to oppose this vote, but he ce-tamly thought it was a very laige sum oi money to place in the hands ot any Government to purchase recreation grounds with The Government would have the whole and sole contiol of that monoy, and how were they to know that this money would not be used by the Government improperly f The Government were always made to pay a far larger amount than anvone else, and he would like to know it any of these lands had been purchased ? Were tho Government to be tho sole aibitrators of how this money was to be disposed of ? He supposed the Government wero like ever>one else, and more likely to help thoir friends than anyono else, and any Government supporter coming befo-o them with a strong claim would bo likely to be helped sooner thanothers The Colonial Secretarj should let the House know what places it was intended to purchase as sites out of this money He did not intend to oppose this, but he thought that a large number of places round Sydney were crying out for these reserves which had the least claim for thom Ashlieldand Burwood and other places were ci ymg out, whereas the money forming this surplus revenue account had come, not from them, but out of the country If there was any particular site this money was going to pay for, let the House know of it now Mr FARNELL did not think the Government were right in coming and asking for £100,000 to do what they liked with, and to make ducks and drake» of The Govern- ment should farst make these purchases where necessary, and then come down to the Hou6e and ask for the monev to paj for them The Government had now got a law by which they could go to arbitiation in the purchase of land This proposal was an inroad on our constitutional govern- ment, and they might as well pass flvo millions at once, and let the Government do as they liked with it, as accedo to this request Sir HENRY PARKES said that, of course, it would bo very easy for the Government to take the couise which had been indicated by the hon member tor St Leonards, but i* would be utterly impossible to take that course so effectually and so economically as the one the Government proposed Any one that had oven watched the course of things during the last few months must know that that the Govern- ment could not possibly stand at the same advantage if thoy had to submit every case to this House Some years ago they bought that estate which was now known as Callan Park, at one-sixth of its present value They gave £10 000 or £11,000 font, and now it was worth £60,000 or £70,000 but they never could hav o bought that estate for * it monoy if they had allowed it to be known beforekanu nat they weie going to buv it Ihey kept the matter a profound secret, and engaged a broker to buy it, and, in the same way, they had acquir d not very long ago, land at Redfern, which had re- cently become worth 50 per cent perhaps moro-perhaps double what they gave ror it The only object of the Government now was to purchase these places m the best possible way, and thev could do tint by being entrusted with the expenditure of this money He aid not know that it was the con«titutional course to purchase land fust and come to Parliament afterwards Everything was constitu- tional which they submitted fairly to Parliament Thoy should ondeavoui to do the best they could, and they were satisfied thev should do v ery much the best by having their bands untied In reference to what the hon member ror the Upper Hunter had said, he would reply that the onlv purchases ho had made wero those of a portion of land at Bal- main, with the view of reclaiming further lands at Snail's Bay, and another purchaso had been made, ho thought, in the neighbourhood of Five Dock These were the only purchases thev had made Mr FITZPATRICK said this was a swindle, and accoidingto the Piemierit was constitutional Tnehon member asked Parliament to give thom £100,000 to do what they liked with, and he for one would not do it It would be altogether a most unconstitutional proceeding Mr STUART could not see that this was spending tne money without comme to Pailiament The question seemed to him to be enfin ly one of ae0iPB as to what oxtent the Government should bo entrusted with funds ï ir makin}, those pui chusos A íesolutiou had been passed thal it w is dosuablo to make purchases of paika in niiiuv ot thu tow na in the colony, nutt ho had been undci the impie sion that the monoj had beun voted, but he found on lelueueo to (ho pipois, that tho voto ho roten cd t> was tho mm li lui ei amount ol £2o0 000 for tho put poses of auppljiug vuitm to the various municipalities But that was a vote of precisely the same character as this, and ho did not remember that the hon, member for Yass took the exception to it that he now did-that it was unconstitutional The hon member for St Leonards had (aid ¿oat too Government oiisrht to buy the Lend and thoa cometo Parliament and ask them to ratify tie» But suppose Parliament refused to ratif y it ?

If the Government for the time being saw that they could get at a cheap price a piece or land which was greaty needed thoj were bound to Duy it, and come to the House to justify the transaction, but this was not a transaction of that kind He was not tying the hands ot the Gown ment and saying that thev should not buy this or that piece ot land, but he declined to vote £100,000 to any Government in this loose wa>, to lay out as they plea»ed Mr H C DANGAR said if the vo'e disclosed no pur* poso whatever for the expenditure of this money he «nowa be quito as unwilling a« tho hon member for "iass to «up* port the vote but as the) had disclosed a very valuable public puipo"e he was not inclined to exhibit such a «ant of confidente in the Goverumpnt as a íetu'altovote tn« monev would indicate He thought if the Governmen baa made reserves throughout the country j ears ago tnere would have been no necessity to ask ioi these large sums (ii money Mr FITZPATRICK asked what hon member baa tu« ghost of an idea where these purchases were tobe.mide It was unprecedented that they should be asked to wta £100 000 tor puichascs of land the nature of wbion taey knew nothing Mr FARNELL said it was unparliamentary to proposa a vote like this, and it the House approved of it it wouia be a piectdent wnich would be followtd in the turare Thev did not know v hat this money wab to beeipona« foi and w bile he^did not wish to express any aistrust mm ever of the Government ho s iid that this principle was_un- sound in itself, piid the casts mentioned bv thei non member for Cimden bueno auulogy to this AVhatiniy wanted to guard at unst wis the public money ¡»"« T;" fuliv expended Let the Government take the w8P°T bihty of making these pincha e» wrsvernifiiig»T ask tho sanction of Parlnmont afforwards ".,TT* ment bought the Chisholm est ita some time ago without any vote, then let them exertiso their discretion withrarara" these recreation grounds, and come down ti P&Traa;" 'ÏÏ ask for the money afterwards He said Parliament ougK to have a voice m these matters It was improper to vo» this money, and it would sot a bad precedent tor aron» Gov ernments to follow , , Mr SI U \RT waa sure they would not besetünr a»" [Mr 1 ARNi.1 L Out ot the sale ot crown muT i " lesolution said that m the ea o of cities, towns,? >nd T£ where there waie no Ciown lands available for reweau purposes, the Goveinment should as opprtunihes oner, purchase land for such puipo»es That w.s theeffect out Lucas's íesolution L\Ir FARNFLL Tha has no^ now , this is a new P irlia.nent ] If m ^ff. &8 previous Paihaments was toba c0B"d6red"V/talent» oi should have such a state of chaos that even the ta eui» tho hon member would not be able to bring into order 1879 the House de ided that the o i¡»»JESÄBII made, and now they were asked by the GovernmentsUH them the power to nuke the» purcha es «e«>n that thcie was no departure from cowütahoiid P» such as the lion member scught to make out ino j could only be spent in tho way the House hld *"» tho puUoultih it tho exj tndttuio wuuid have to illunie lit, I to tin II use . ci Mi lll/PAIIUOK rud the bon member tor leon.rds hid only advocated the purely «.""&* uba^e, that the Government should wftkY Hews*T» and submit them to the Hocse for approval «" ^ hon, members would find out if ^P^fániv they had been guilty of a gross dereliction ot aruy Mr O CONNOR said they had heard Aeoonro» side of this argument, bat thoro was » nraoticiH «I»9 " He could not understand the hesitation of hon members in HiMUSsing this question, and tho httlo attention thoy had fcsidtoMr Farnell and Mr Fitzpatrick 1 hose gentlemen weht to have been treated with more respect The Govern- ment after the speech of the hon member for Cunden, Bueht to abandon the idea , for Ins speech was all agivmst (lio side he spoke on Mr Badgeiv's speech was not very satisfactory ffl \a¡, mmd Supp ise the lim member h id n piece of land for sale, nnd the Government was to iiequnn ilitttlnnd Hie peonle of this cottntn were vpij anxious to neal with the Government 11K Gi vrinm^nt weio good tus iomers He ventured to say Mr bulgcn wouldrccuvothe plenipotentiary of the Colonial Societal) with 111010 respect than ho would anv broker in town Sup Do e the Government bought a piece of land for £j0 000, and tic) found out afterwaids that it was not worth £10 000, what would thev do with the Government" Ihe» might turn tbera out, but what satisfaction would that be ?

It was a danger that tho Government must see themselves if thev pondered over it Mr ROSEBY should very cordially support this vote o' he considered this as money verv wellsp»nt He did not think the Government would pav £o0,000 for lind worth only £10,000 One important matter to which ho wished to draw attention was that he thought something ihould be done to provide for the people of thosubuibsa little more recreation ground around their dwelling Iho way in which the people wete permitted to cut up estates round the citv was m his opinion a disgrace to civ llization and anyone who had visited Melbourne and watehed the good sense of the authorities m compelling that sheets should le of a certain width, and allotments of a certain size would see the difference He hoped the Government would take the matter up Mr ABIGAIL said that m his ignorance of the consti- tutional rules and piocetdmgs of the House, he fuiled to see ¿ow the Goverument wero at fault m v hat thev propos"d He thought thev deserved commendation in tr)ing to pur- chase re erves in a pureh business manner He should lupport this vote in the full belief that this talk about cor- ruption on the part of Ministeis was all twaddle If the Government spent this £100 000 badi), could not tne House turn them out ? Mr PIGOIT said that this question had been argued as If the Government were not to be trusted in unv wav and be thought that if this vote were rejected it would bo clearlv a vote of want of confidence in the Ministry The joung members had been treated to a long lecture by the hon mombei for East S)dn°v but ho himself thought the new members were as independent as the old one« (Hear, hear ) He was sure that if it wore true that the Colonial Secretar) could frighten fift) members of this House into doing whatev er be wished, it would be a very serious thing for the House and the country , but the House would not be wionglv led bv the Colonial Sécrétai v or anv one «lse If the Government brought down anv measures he did not pppiove of, and if the Colonial Secretan said he would resign unless thev wero carried he would sav resign at once but he was certain that the hon the Colonial Secretary would nev or dare to do such a thm.r He would supnoit this motion, because he believe«? that

It He had alwa) s urged the Gov eminent to purchase land for recieation purposes so that ho did not wish to deprive the public of any recreation grounds but he thought it dangerous to give such a pov er to anv Government is was now proposed, and he was sure that if the Colonial beere tary was sitting in opposition ho would declaim against a vote of this kind and would never consent to it Mr LEVIEN thought the hon member for the Micleay had put a good deal of full on on this occasion in lecturing the young members as ho had done Ihe hon member had got £7o,000 for a road that a bullock drav did noi pass over once in twelve months, and would no doubt be glad to Wo the whole ot this £100 000 The hon members for Yass and St Leonards were supposed to bo constitutional authori- ties, and the Colonial Secietary was nl«o au authontv, end they greatlvdiffered He would rather be inclined to give his vote m favour of tho Colonial Secretary, beciuse thev had had his decisions so often upheld by higher authorities than himself He did not think thev need fe r that the Govern- ment would hand over these amount« te deputations as had been more than hinted at by some hon members If the) had any confidence in the Government and believed thev could honestly support the vo'e then let them do it He thought it highly desirable and necessary that thev should have the»e recreation grounds, not only in the suburbs, but in the various districts in the colony (Hear, hear ) Mr POOLE would have given a silent vote upon the question, had it not been for the extraordinär) speech of the non member for the Macleay He had known the hon member for years, and would tell him that there was no member that had ever caused the Government to spend more raonev foolishly than he had (Hear, hear) No wonder he bew ailed an increase of members m the House because it put down some of his peculiar privileges If the vote pMsed, ho had no doubt that one of the first applicants for B grant out of the vote would be the hon member for the Maelea) It was, however, the bon m°mber for Public Works who had set the bad example of tw lttiug the young members, and that example had been faithfullv followed He was rather reluctant to voto this mone) but as a man of business he saw cleirly the justice of the reasons put for- ward bv the Colonial Secretar), and he would, therefore, «upport the vote Mr R B SMITH desired to explain that he had the greatest possible regard for every one of the n^w mombei s of the House, but if bethought anv thing was right, he wAld express his opinion even at the risk of the insolence and impertinence ot the hon member for Tamworth In reference to tho votes he had obtained tor his district, he would sitnplv sav that he had never ad vocated a want unless he believed it was tor the benefit of his constituents Mr TRICKE1T said that after the wav in which the gauntlet had been thrown down by the old members he thought that the young members would have been ser- vile if they had not stood up in self-defence At in) rate they could not be accused of hav ing taken up the time of the House night after night m discussing old questions as had been done by many of the old members Having been present during the whole of the debate he was more and more of the opinion that this mone) must be voted Mr FITZPATRICK said he bid been accused of at- tempting to throw dust in the eyes of hon members It was nothiB practice to do so What he had said regarding this vote he would repeat m a few words Such a vote was never asked for bv any Government It was unnecessary for the purchase of the land, and it would be unconstitutional to agree to it when the purposes for which it was intended wero undefined Mr. BRUNKER said he was aware the hon member had Jjot attempted to throw dust in the ev es of hon members Ihe hon member, howovei, had said no precedent for this vote existed Probably the necessitv foi such a v ote had not arisen before His experience taught him mat it had n->t |Mr ÎITAPAÏUICX "ies it had] The reserves were essential for the pie=eivation of the health of residents in the citv suburbs and countrv, and would be purchased if they could be obtained satisfactorily various requests had been mude to thj Government to .ecurethem, and the Assembly might trust this Government «rita the money to pav for them, becaus» th»ir knowledge of the people and the quality of tho land required was quite as great as that of any other Admimatration was ltkelv to be He would give his hoartv suppoit to the vote beiauso his experience in Maitland where there theie was a largo reserve, inclined him to believe that these recreation grouuds "ere urgentl) required Mr SU1HERLA^D said he would vote a-reinst the 'auction of the item and ho did not know that he could Bud anv reason for his doing EO bevond those already adduced Ho desired, however, to rofer particu- larly to the item of £?0,000 for special grant to country »nd suburban municipalities The

A message was read from his Excellency the Governor recommending to the consideration of the Assembly esti- mates of expenditure on account of public works for 1881, proposed to be provided for by loan A resolution was submitted,-" That there bo granted to her Majesty a sum not exceeding £8,702 500 on account of public works proposed to be provided for bv loan " Mr LACKEY said it now became his duty, in proposing the estimates for a large public expenditure for railway construction and other important works, to explain to the committee the nature of the votes which the Government now submitted and the items the committee was asked to givo its conourrenco to Tho items contained m the Loan estimates embiaceda large number of important railwav extensions amongst other public works, and one of tho largest was tho extension which had been bofore the public for a groat number of years, that was tho line from Home- bush to Waratah, a distance of ninety-five miles, the line to be a double one It would be in the recollection of hon members that for several years this proposed line had been under the consideration of different Gov ernuients, and that surveys had been made from timo to time for the purpose of ascertaining the best route for the construction of this large and imnortant work And he thought it would be admitted on all hands that the line which the committee was now asked to give its concur- rence to was one which would affect largely the interests of the peoole of tho colony generally (Hear, hear ) It was well known that for a great number of )ears the producéis of the northern district had laboured under great disad- vantages compared w ith those of the southern and western districts, for want of railway communication between their district and the metropolis Whi'st the fal mers in the southern and weston districts had everv lacility provided for the transmission of their produce to the market and port ot S) dnev, the inhabitants of tho northern district were precluded from theso advantages from the fact of there being no communication between the Northern and Great Southern and "Western lines The dis advantages under which tho noithern distuct laboured had become very apparent to those engaged m trade and it was undei these circumstances that the Go veminent wero now asking the committee to concur in the pioposed expenditure, which would be the means of uniting these two great s) stems of rail wa), and thus complote the link m the line of railway communication bv connecting the Great Northern line and the Southern and Western lines Since this project was first undertaken various sun evs had been made irom time to time, and he held in his hand the descriptions of the different surve) s which had been made, and the routes through which each survey had been carried out, and he would bay, in submitting this project to the committee, that the Government had not been influenced by any desire to conciliate the wishes or predilections of any special section of the community Their object had been, in submitting the project to P irliament, to adopt that route w Inch w as found after sunevto bo most suitable m the interests of the colony generallv and which would most contribute to the convenience of those who were hkelv to u«o it 1 hey had adopted this line in the interests of the whole community, feeling tint it was one easiest ot con- struction least expensive, and one wh chvrouldcontribute in the largest wav possible to the commerce of the railwav f A voice No ] He might state that several v ears ago, when this railwav pioject was first initiated, the object of the Government of the day was to get the line constiucted as eail> as possible being impressed with the gieat necessity that as little delay as possible should occur, and although greater delav had taken place than should hav e been the case, he would impress upon the committee that this hod arisen, not from want of activity on tne part of the Government, or a deslíe to cair) out the work or any vant of recognition on the part of the Government of the great necessitv of the wor' , but from the difteienceof opinion existing between the iesidents in various paits of tho northern district as to which route the line should take, anl it wa« a fact that aftoi the first survev was completed applications were made to the Government, and deputations waited upon I thom, asking to have another line sun eyed Ibis necessaul) caused delav and att^r this fuither rarvevs wore made at the request of tue lesidents of the northern district living bovond Singleton, who thought the line should go vm Sin- gleton and Wollombi Publif meetings, vere hold in the nortnTn district and memorials got up and largely signed, and in deference to repeated apulications which were made by these public meetings, and by deputa- tions and memorials the Government wero obliged to give way and submit to another survey Hence the delav which had stood in the wa) of earning out this railway a work which vould laigely affect the profitiblo working of oi i railwav s and at the same time in a great measuie complete the link of communication between the extreme north and the extreme south ot the colonv "Vi eil, not onlv wus the work delà) ed by the causes he had referred to, but, as hon members who knew the countrv, and had any know ledge of the geogr iphical features of the country thiough which these sunevs had been made must be aware the countrv was of such a character that considerable time was taken up b\ these Bun c) s Hovvev er th"3e surve) s were completed and he held in his hand the reports of thesuivo)ois on the different routes and it was alter a very caietul consideration of the diuerent routes traversed and survev ed and after giving the gravest possible attention to the va-ious representations made to them that the Government had come to the conclusion that the proposed line was tbe best and most suitable for the general pur- poses of trade and traffic between the Northern, Southern and Western districts Hon members w ould see that the cost of the lino at per mile was verv great The work was necessanlv an expensive one, from the character of the countrv , and one large item in construction was an exten- sive bridge across the Haw kesburv, near Broken Bav, the estimated cost of which was three-quarters of a million of money, and m addition to this there were large engineering difficulties which would have to be overcome That was one of the reasons whv the expense would be so gieit, and another reason was that it was proposed to construct a double lino from one point to another, as it was supposed that it was only bv that means the large ti ailie which it was expected thi« line would have to carry would be met Ihe largo amount which was required for the purpose of constructing this line was accounted for by the character of the country through which it would have to pass, and the fact that it was to be a double line He pointed out the desirableness of permitting no further delay in the carr) rag out of this important public work through an) disposition that might exist among hon members in fav our of hav rag the line taken in particular directions It was bv such differences of opinion that the delav s had already occurred and Drevented the construction of the line Were it not for the local jealousies that had existed, it was probable that the line would have been completed bv this time Various routes had been surveyed, and estimates of the cost had been prepared According to these estimates the line now submitted from Homebush to Waratah vi as to cost £2 7oo000 Ihe route had boen surveyed from Parra- matta but it was thought desirable to avoid the large expense of crossing the river at Parramatta, and to take it round the hill at Parramatta and connect vith the line at Homebush Subsequently thoEugineer in-chief reeojimended a direct course going from Peat's Terry on to the dividing range between tho Par- ramatta Riv er on tho one side and the Hawkesbury on the other, past Pennant Hills at a point a little above Ryde, and joining the Western and Southern line at Homebush A «econd line had been survev ed from Parramatta to Wiseman's Terry, St Albans, Wollombi and Annundale with deviation from Wollombi to Broke and Singleton, 112 miles, at a cost of £3,883,000 and a third line via the Bulga Road to Singleton, 117 miles, at a cost of £3 021,000 Further surve) s had been made, going trom Homebush to withm a few miles of the neighbourhood of Lake Mac- quarie, i»nd branching off m the neighbourhood of East Maitland The expense would have been about tho same us that of the route now proposed, but it had been thought that if they were to adopt tins route to East Maitland thoy would hove lost a great portion of the large ti ade which thev had a right to expect from the Lower Hunter (Hear, hear ) Besides that, large settlements were being established in the neighbourhood of Lake Macquarie and the district should give a considerable amount of traffic to the railwav If tho line to EaBt Maitland had been adopted instead of the proposed lino to Hexham, they would have lost a great deal of this trade ïhe Government believed they had adopted the route which would be the most beneficial Ihey had adopted the route which would make tho line itself of a more paying character than under other cir- cumstances It was actuated by those views that the Government had been influenced in coming to the decision to ask the committee to give them power to construct this line from Homebush The actual constiuction would be less between Homebush and Waratah than between Homebush and EaBt Maitland b^ about three miles [An hon member What is the difference in cost ] Probablv, about £40,000 The line which was proposed to Waratah would, he thought, be found the least expensive of the threo Ihe following wero the survev ors' doso-iptions - " 1 Trom Homebush to a crossing of the Pairumatta River two miles above ¡south hvthe, and by the head of Lane Cove to the Peat's Ferry Road, thence to a ciossing of the Lowei Hawksbury at Dangar Island to Brisbane Water, through Gosford to the west of the lake at luggerab. Beach and Lake Macquarie, and m close proxirait) to tho vanouB coal lines which brunch in a southe! ly dnection from the main line to a junction with the Northern Railway near to 1\ ar itah 1 wo deviations from the Western Railway hav e been surveyed on this route, the first from a point about a mile to the west of the Parramatta station toa junction with the line surveyed from Homebush, at a point on the Peat's Ferrv Road 12 miles north« west of Homebush The second commencing at the same point on the Western Railway and joining tho Homebush lino at the same point on the Peat's Ferry Road, but making a moio westerly detour than deviation No 1, and passing through Castle Hill The deviations on the northern end of the line, being one through Wallsend to a junction with the Noi thern Ruilwav near Hexham, and u second from a point west of Lnke Macquiuo to East Maitland 2 From a point on tho Castle Hill doviationon route No. ', seven miles wet of Hie junction with the Western Ran i ij, to a tiossmg of the Hawl i - bury River at Wiseman's Icnv thpticp bv the Mit donald River to SI Albans, thence with n lone: and 6teop usccnt to the head of the ATollombi Click line, and a similar fall to Wollombi, and thencp to a junction with tho Northern Railway at Allandale A deviation from this route has been surveyed from Wol- lombi, via the general direction of the Wollombi Brook to Broke, and thence to a junction with the Northern Railway at Singleton 3 Trom a point on tho Blacktown and Richmond branch near Mulgrave, to a cross- ing of the Hawkesbury River about a mila btlow the con- fluence of tho Colo River, thence bv the Wheclbanow Range, and Parson's Forest, to the Bulga Ro d then e via the-general direction of that road to a crossing of the Mac- donald River, thence through Howe's Mountain to tho head of Ûarkv Creek, and thence by a long fall, with extremely heavy works, to a crossing of the Wollombi Brook, and thence to a junction with route No 2, at a point about midway between Broke and Singleton " These had all been carefully considered bv the Government, and they had decided m favour of the route now proposed He had had an elaborate estimate prepared of the prob ible receipts that they were likely to get from this line, and those recoipts had boon based upon the present traffic with- out taking into account the prospective increase that tho construction of tho lino must v îeld, and, according to those calculations, the return would bo between 3 and 4 per cent upon the expenditure Ho considered that a return upon tho expenditure in constructing u double lino should warrant the committee m incurring the expenditure The next line he would reter to was that from Svdnev io \VolIon0oug and Kiama, 68 miles, at a cost of £1,020,000 This line had been under public notice for a great number of years Though it did not lormerly mott with tho approval of Parliament, there was no doubt that at the present timo public opinion had grown greath m favour of the proposed railway (Hear, hear ) Not only had the rcsouiccs of those districts been increasing, but the whole line passtd through localities-at all events that portion whith would run as fai as Georgo s Ri\ er, and ev en bey ond that-where it would be largely used foi passeugei trniht, and that particular portion he had referred to would be largely used bv suburban residents who now trav oiled m such large numbers to the delightful districts in the neighbourhood of Georgo s Ri\ or -districts which were sure to be quic'tlv settled He thought this proiect was one in which the Government weie warranted in asking the House to give its concurrence The districts through which the line would pass were l«rge and feitilo and highlv cultivated, nud of gicit resources Besides the passenger communication there was a lui ga mineral trade, which would vield a largo return Under these circumstances the Government felt that it was their dutv to submit this voto to Parliament He hoped that hon. members would be as fully alive to the desirability of giving their concurence to a work which was likely to yield a considerable return im- mediately, as well as in prospective, which would be a large addition to the railway system of the colony, a line which would give facilities for the conveyance of the produce to the chief market, and that would give speedy communi- cation to the large population likely to settle down in the various suburban districts The next item was £1,430 000 for a line from Goulburn to Cooma, via Tarago, Bungendore, and Queanbeyan, a distance of 130 miles. Hon. members would be acquainted with this project, which had been before the public for a great number of years. On various occasions deputations had waited upon the various Govern- ments, and great interest had been taken in the construction of this line. Surveys had been made from a large number of points to the neighbourhood of Cooma The Government had given the greatest consideration to these routes, and had come to the conclusion that the one they submitted now would contribute to the convenience of the greatest number, and would yield a considerable return for the outlay. Proposals had been made to the Government for a line by way of Braidwocd, and although no survey was made of this route, it was transversed an officer of the department to ascertain whether that proposal was feasible. The conclusion come to by that officer in his report was that it was not desirable to construct the railway through that district. But the next best thing was done. To meet the convenience of the great number of residents in the various districts along that line by taking it from about Goulburn and coming by Tarago to Bungendore They would thus get within a reasonable distance of Brad- wood He thought this was a route that after the most careful consideration would commend itself to anybody, and the Government were quite warranted in submitting this route This was a fine agricultural and pastoral district. Ho need not call to mind the large claims of this district It would yield a large return, which would be much increased by the settlement of population in that district. The next sum was £b0,000, to construct a bridge ovei the Murrav , or rather, to pav half the cost, aod eui ry our railway fi om its present terminus at Albury to the Murray River [Air VA Liin Is the Murrav a mile and thiee quaiters wide'l It vv« very wide on the Vic- torian side, but not on oui s The engineers of the two colonies had been in communication in respect to the n-o posed junction of our railwav with the Victorian line Thev had not y et finally agreed, but when the matter was last discussed between the reores^ntntives of tho two colo- nies, it was arranged that the york should be done as fai as thenver on our side by us, and on the otherside by tno Victorians It was contemplated to have two lines-the Victorian gauge of o feet 3 inches would be t-tken from VA odonga right into the Alburv station, and our l feet 8J inch gauge would bo taken from Albury right into the Wo- donga station Since that was irranged there had been a change in the "V ictorian Government, and the officials bad been changed AA nether the prcent regxmt w ould carry out the arrangements he was not m n position to sav But, under any circumstantcs, this vote would cover the cost, and he thought it would bp admitted that, having constructed our lailway to Albury, it was onlv in the interests of the countrv that wo should give uninterrupted communication betwten the capitals of th9 two colonies Immediate steps would be taken tor the tmrposo of hav mg the work cal ned out The next proposal was the extension of the western line from Orange via Molong to the neigh- bourhood of Forbes Some time ago a íesolution wnspas'ed in that House directing a suivcy from Oiango to AA'ilcannm Tho line was surveyed, and this was apart of the loute then survoved The whole of this district was a rich pro- ducing country 1 his line went between Parkes and Toi bes It avoided the Hooded country-I othes was subject to floods -and it was carried along'the higher ground, and it was supposed it would be a greater accommodation bv going this w iv, and it would be a portion of the line that no doubt would one day be continued to tho river Darling, becauso the value of railways was so apparent, and their necessitv so indisputable It would be admitted that thev should give the greatest facilities to the inhabitants of this part of the countrv to como to Svdney if they thought fit to do so Even at the present time there was a largo population ia these districts, and the line would yield a large return for the outlay incurred in its construction When this lmo was first piojected it was thought that a tramway would answer until the traffic increased but ou further consideration and eiaimnation of the country it was found unsuitable fora tramway, and the Government decided to ask Parliament to give its concurrence to the construction of a locomotive line 1 he next amount wus £31S,C00, with which the Government proposed to construct a line from Narandora to Jerilderie This was only n con tmuation of the policy to endeavour to secure that lni ¡re trade from the Riverina districts Ah ead v vye had diverted a large portion of the trado that used to go fiom the Lower Murrumbidgee to Victoria The railway was now con- structed as far as Narandera The stock traihe ft om that district was nov> muchgreatorthan it had ev er been before, and was lai ger than had been anticipated Iheir policy was to continue this line not only to Huv, along the b inks of the Murrumbidgee, but down the Yanco Creek, to secure that largo trado which was now going to V ictoriu, and restore it to New South VA al»s, and give facilities to the settlers thero to send their live stock to this market, and in return to cet their supplies from New South Wales lhe line was a very inexpensive one, and it went through a verv rich country foi the whole of the distance It would yield a Ifrgo return upon the outlay, aud be a great convenience to tho residents m that part of the country Then he came to tho extension of 34 miles from Cootamundra to Gundagu. This also was not an expensive line. It had been projected for vcars, and survey a had been made and successive Gov- ernments had from time to time proposed to carry it out The Government now felt that thev were warranted m asking the House to asEent to this line It w as a largo pro ducme district, and a country that was well populated There was no doubt that the produce of this district would be sent to the metropolis if the people hud such means of communication as this railway would give Under these circumstances the Government felt justified in asking the Parliament for its concurrence in carrving out this work He hoped bon members in icvitvving this estimate would sanction this proposed railwav Tho next item was 108 miks, from Murrumburrah to Blayney There was a large population along this lino, near Young, Grenfell, Carcoar Cowra, and on to Blayney These were also large producing districts, rich and fertile, compnsiner elevated climates where wheat was grown and farm produce of all kinds was abundant It only required communication to bring this produce to tho market in Sy dnoy He had no doubt the line would be a great convenience and a benefit to the community Ho thought the Government would bo only doing its duty m carrying out this project There was a large section of country that would be left without railway communication at all without this line The country between the Southern and Western lines would be lett w ithout railway communication at all it this were not const! ucted It would alford a gre it conv onience to travellers from the northern to tho southern districts who did not require to go to Sydnov, for thev could thus go direct But this was not the principal re- commendation. 1 ho Government felt that thev had stronger reasons-tho great facilities to the i esidents of these districts, and the great impetus it would giv e to settlement upon the soil, and to pastoral and agricultural occupations. Bv means of a loop line, greater facilities would be given for carrving stock in cases of that oharaoter. Tho nest item was for the purpose of completing the line botvvepn Wagga and Albury-for the purpose of paying for a line already made The estimato first made was made in a somewhat hasty wav The Engineer-m-Chief was then at Albury, and was telegraphed to by the Minister to know what the line between Wagga and Alburv would cost, and, after a hasty calculation, ho submitted a certain sum, which wo. «iterwards lound to be £95 000 short The Enginoer-in-Chiof was generally most accurate, but this was a mistake in an estimate which might have crept in under oircumstances like that without any blame being attnbutablo to the officer entrusted with the w ork The information had to be given without making the ntcssary CIOSP calculation«, and the Minister for the day submitted to Parliament the amount sent to him The next item was one of p 00 000 for tho pin poso of making aire lihou« and additions to stati m buildings and Riding ictnnmod fion l> meet the inn easing traflic but ho w nil take tins oppoihunty ot statin,* to thn (o-nnutlo) that (hero vv is ono estimar« which tho Government fcl bound to leav o out of fins item A line had been projected li oin Gi afton on the Clarence, to Glen Junes, and one fiom Lismore on the Richmond, to Teiterfuld Ihe Government thought, in view of the remoteness of the o districts from the metropolis, and their importance, that the) could see thoir wav to construct a line to tile coast for the conv emence of the districts Elaborate plans had been made and estimates had been supplied to the Government within the last few days with a view of con- structing the proposed work, but it appeared from the surveys and estimates that such a worn, was of an extremal) difficult character and whether by wav of Tenterfield or Glen Innes extensive and almost unsurmountablo country was to be tipped and, in view of the large amount required, the Government felt they would bo scarcely justified in sub- mitting this worl to tho committee with the other latge items brought up Tho work would cost two and a half millions-that was some £17 000 or £18 000 a mile-and hon members would see that it was more than toe Govern- ment would be warranted in asking the House to concur in at the present time It wa* possible, however, that some moro suitable line would )et be found It must not bo forgotten independent!) of this that they had now con- structed a railway from Newcastle on to the tableland of New England ana to the borders of Queensland Lines wore at present m course of construction, or contracts had beennccopted for thom to Glen Innes and within tivo )ears the residents of leutcrd Id might hav o reason to be content for a time at least but the line to tho coast, as submitted by the En in or n Chief, was one which would cost £2000 a mile noie thin the mountain line between Sydnev and Bathurst, mid the Government were not justified m nsl m.r the committee to give concurrence to its construe tion now lho next item tho committee were asked to deal with was the sum of £)00 000 for alterations and additions to station building« and foi siding accommodation to meet the increismg tiaffic on our diffeient lines This had been regirded as un expenditure pioperly met bvthe capital vote, and up to the prosont time Parliament bud be°n in the habit of voting sum« of from £/ J 000 to £100 000 for the purpose of meeting this ote Prom the fact of this vote being exceeded at certain times and the inconvenience caused in accounts bv hav mg to anticipate this vote, it was thought that the moie desiribl» course would be to take the vote from the loan estimate and debit tho vote with the expendí ture under this head >o more monev would be expended under this s) stem than before Thev then got to the har- bour and rivers estimate The first item was one of ?20 000 towal ds tho construction of tho southern break- water at Newcastle This work had been going on for year« and this ivasoneof a seiiesof vot°s which had been taken from time to time Ihe woik which had been can ed out hore h id had the effect of making a safe her- born of the poit of Newcastle but the inroads of storms and tides had removed portions of the breakwater and these had to be repaired The next item was one of £30 000 for a breakwater at the Clarence Kivr This was part of a large work which had been carried out from time to time for the accommod ition of ships at the Clarence River They tried to carry out by means of engineering skill what natuie had denied-an outlet to this river -to mai o a rock) head on each side, and mike a scour between that the entrance might be navi- gable and available at all times lho next item was a sum of £60 000 for the purpose of completing the Darling Harbour wherf, and extending therailwav to the deep waters of Port Jackson lhov vvi«h<>d to complete Darling Harbour w harf so as to enable ships of any draught of water to go alongside Ihe present wharf might be extended down to tho bridge He might state that the Govern- ment contemplated some time ago to make Darling Harbour av niable for shipping to utilize our railway which went down to Dalling Haibour and to make the wliei i go dow n to M irl et street But they found on taking meisuiements tint to cain the îailwav down the centre would not admit of laigc ve «els obtaining their loading fiom the countiv or discharging cargo and the

countrv and reflect ciedit on the House v hich would be instrumental m carrying them out In their railway proposals the Government had not been actuated bv anv «pint of favouritism, or any deBire to carry the line in this diret tion or that but they had carefully weighed the projects of the Engineer-in-Chief, and had como to the conclusion that those were the least expensive and mo»t benehcial to the interests of the countrv Under these circumstances he hoped the committee would see their wav clear to pa«s the estimate (Hear, hear ) Dr BEN WICK vas glad that the Government lied submitted somo of these estimates, as some ot them had been long called for The extensions of the main trunks of railway had been desired and ho was glad the Government had brought down the propos ils which they had made in regard to these lines It appeared to him an extra ordmai) proposal that the e lines should be terminated m a small portion of the harbour called Darling Harbour (Hear hear ) He thought all our main trunk lines should come dow n to the Circular Qua)-(Cheers and dissent) and was sati«fi°d that no system of railway conv ev ance would be sitisfactor) to the people of Svdney until it was brought down to the great centre of commerce, Circular Quav (Hear, hoar ) It struck him thatthocitizens of Syduoy would not be satisfied with the accommodation provided for carriage from tho railway tormmuB to the city of Sydnev The tnmwavs undoubtedly had been a great convenience to the travelling public but sooner or later the railway itself would hav e i o be brought from the railwii) terminus into the heart of the cit) His own tmpiession was that the plan onginallv proposed bv Mr John "i oung was the best scheme vet lud before tho public of Svdnev By that scheme it was intended to bring the principal trunk lines round the shoies of tho harbour to the Cncular Quay ihe Government had auopted u small portion of that scheme, but it v as a poition that was lnadequitofor the purpose, and he believed thev had tal onthewiougsideof Dai ling Harbour for their terminus 1 ho amount of monev which had been spout at Darling Harbour wa« thrown away unless the Pvimont Bridge was removed and tho water was perma nentlv deepened But if that was done it would be utterly impossible in thit part of the harbour to provide the neces- sary accommodation for tho shipping of the city and, the cfore it became nil the more desirable to extend the mlvvaj round the shores of the harbour to the Circular Quxy He considered that thi« metropolis-though now one of the pnncipal marítimo ports of the southern hemisphere-was at present onlv in its infancv and he hoped thev would look to the future, but if thp plan subimttol wore adopted thov might say farewell to anv thine, 'ii e a bold system of railwa) construction for the harbour ihe Societalv for W< iks had also stated that this Government intended to tarry the two separate gauges side bv side between Albur) and Wodonga lhat appeared to linn to bo in absurd propos ii It was a pi tv that tlieie W016 the two gauges, but no blame rested on this colony at all for our gm0o was estiblishcd long bofoie the A ictorian gau{,ew is adopted ihe gauge we now emploved was that umv ersallv adopted throughout Great Bntain and America He hoped tho engineers would reconsider this subject with the \ ictorian Government, and that a mart should b° established into which should îun the lines of the two colonies It was, ho understood, a principle now con- firmed that branoh lines should be constructed, formerly, it was the rulo of that House that the main trunk lines alone should be constructed but this rule had been broken through with regard to the Mudgee rulwav. and he was glad to seo that the Minister had adopted some of the Bug- I gestions th it had been made, but ho thought it was a matter for regret that they had forgotten tho Clarence Riv cr lines which seemed to have been entirely overlooked He believed that the gradients wero not so oxcessive as had been originally stated He considered the city of Sydney had been unfairly treated in the proposals of the Government in regard to the continuation of the trunk lines to the harbour tself (Hear, hear ) Mr BRUN KER thought that considering the magnitude of tlio vote, lion members mi¡,ht fairly ask the Government for au adjournment of thedebate (Hear, hear ) He had been led to beliov e that the Government intended to adopt another course alt igethor from that which thev appeared to have takon, and ho was quite unpiepared to deal with this question, which was of considorablo importance So far as connecting the Groat Northom line with Sydney was concerned ho thought tho House should have considerably more informa- i tion than had been aven, for the Minister for Works had simply shown that he had an utter want of knowledge of the geographical wants of the country ; he would be able to , show that the proposal of the Government wai one of the most idiotic policies ever brought before the House. (Oh, and cheers.) Mr. SEE supported the proposal that the Government 1 should consent to an adjournment of the debate, and said he had to confess to a great amount of disappointment at the policy. He would, however, like to have a longer time to consider it than he should be able to givö that night, and he thought the dpbate might be adjourned for a week. Mr. M'ELHONE had no doubt thnt the Government would at once consent to the adjournment, and ho would suggest that the information which had been given respect- ing the expenditure should be printed. He did not care how the lines went, all he wanted being to get more lines that were best for the country. (Hear, hear.) Sir HENRY PARKES said the Government could, of course, have no objection to the adjournment but they could not see why it should be to any moro distaat date than next day. (Oh.) They were quite willing [An hon. Member : To muke it Tuesday.] They were per- fectly willing to adjourn it till Tuesday if non. members would give up that day. (Hear, hear.) While ha was on his feet he would like to say a word or two with respect to the disappoiatment of hoa. geatlemen who were interested in the connection of the Clarence River with the table-Iaad of New England or the Northern Border territory. He yielded to very few ia his desire to see this line constructed, but the only estimate they could bring down was one for £2,400,000 for a line of 131 miles in leagth, or at the rate of £18,000 a mile, a higher estimate than the actual cost of the line over the Blue Mountains. TAn hoa. Member : It could not possibly cost that.J . The hon. member set up his owa opinion upoa that point against that of the Engineer-in-Chief, t>y which the Government must be guided : and he unhesitatingly said that the Engineer-in-Chief of this country was an officer who, in poiat of ability, stood nB high as aay officer in tho world. (Hear, hear.) Ho was an eminent man in his pro- fession, and the Government must bo guided by his estimates in preference to those of any other man in the country. He did not mind stating to tho House that this estimate was in the printed estimates brought down, and that it was struck out because they thought tho Government were thoroughly unjustified in bringing down such an estimate until they had made other inquiries and other surveys to see if tho line could not be made at less cost They had not abandoned this connection, but they must have time ia order to see if it could not be doae at leBs cost. His owa opinioa was, that if they could connect Grafton with the Northern border country, they would have a fair chuace of competing with Brisbane, not only for the trade of their own border, but also for a portion of the Queensland trade. He was quite willing to rely apon the good faith of the House, and with that understanding ho would consent to the adjournment of the Loan Estimates till Tuesday. Mr. FITZPATRICK trusted that the Secretary for Works would give the committee some information with reference to tho proposal to pay half the cost of building a bridge in a neighbouring territory. It seemed to him a startling circumstance that we were going to pay half the cost of a bridge into the territory of Victoria. Sir HENRY PARKES said the estimate for £80,000 was for the expenses of the railway on our sido of the Murray, a mile and a quarter, and of half the cost of the union bridge, leaving Victoria to construct her line, which was nearly three miles in length, and to pay half the cost ot the union bridge. Mr. PIGOTT said he simply rose to ask that hoa. mem- bers shoald have full time given them for consideration of as much information as the hen. the Secretary for Public Works could give with regard to this estimate. He thought some of these proposals were so startling that hon. gentle- men should have all the information in the possession of the Government, and full time to coasider it. Mr. BRODRIBB was uaderstood to express a desire to maintain our right to the Murray River. Sir HENRY PARKES said Mr. Berry had contended that as the river bolonged to us we ought to pay the ex- pense of building the bridge ; but the Government con- tended that Victoria ought to pay half the expense of the bridge. Mr. BADGERY- thought the Government ought to be commended for their boldness in these railway proposals. It was a step in the right direction, and long wanted ; and he would support the Government in it ; but he thought thoy might very well go on to-night with the lines to which there was no objection. (" No.") Mr. COPELAND did not think it was fair that hon. members should be asked to give up Tuesday for the dis- cussion of theso proposal. The adjournment might very well be made for a week. Mr. POOLE asked the Secretary for Works to provide the committe with a schedule, showing the probable amount of traffic that would be derived from tbe construction of these railway lines, and the sources of the traffic. Mr. LACKEY said he would furnish the information. Mr. GARRETT said he had no remarks to make in any way opposed to the adjournment. There was only one of these lines that had not been very largely discussed from timo to time, and the line that he refened to was the one from Murrumburrah to Blayney. He thought all parties would come to the conclusion that the northern system of railways should be connected with the southern and western lines ; but his opinion was that the western line between Parramatta and Sydney would not bo able to bear the lance amount of additional traffic which its connection with the northern line would bring about, in addition to the traffic which the southern railway would produce by the extension of the line to Cooma, and to the increase in the suburban traffic. Having come to this con- clusion, the first way of meeting the difficulty, in his opinion, was to terminate the northern line on the North Shore. (Hear, hear.) Of this he was certain-that any line in the course of a short time must havo a branch between here and Newcastle from somewhere at the head of Lane Cove River to the deep waters of North Shore, and it would be far better to como in that direction at once with the main northern line. He admitted that we must have a railway connection between the Northern line and the Western line; but a light railway would carry what passenger trarfice there would be, and all the goods traffic should go to the North Shore, where there were forty or fifty miles of deep water frontage which they were leaving un- utilized. All the wool and the mineral traffic must go theie. The consequence of forcing all this trafilo upon the western line would be that they would have to triplicate the number of rails, and this would involve the widening of tho line, the tunnels, the viaducts, and bridges to three times their present widths. The expense would bo enormous. He was glad to see that the Government had abandoned the folly of bringing the railway through the city-(cheers)-to the Circular Quay. The Quay was only used for mero passen- ger accommodation for people going to sports down the harbour or to North Shore. The bulk of the shipping weat to Darling Harbour, and fewer ships loaded at Circular Quay than at private wharfs. If Pyrmont Bridge, which was useless, were removed, it the harbour were dredged, and the wharfs extended oa the east and west sides, they might easily extend their railways to deep water. He could understand geatlemea in the suburbs desiring to see the railway extended through the city to their offices ; but was it a good thing for the country to be put to the expense of meeting their convenience ? (Cheers.) They proposed now to spend £60,000 to make a railway to Darling Harbour, and to carry it to Market Wharf would not cost more than another £100,000. A railway through the city to Circular Quay would cost be- tween two and three millions. (Cheers.) The present ter- minus was near 'the heart of the city-[Mr. HOSKINS : Hear, hear]-and would perhaps bo more so when the rail- way was_ extended to Darling Harbour. He would like the line to the harbour to be of a double character ono branch to be taken to Pyrmont, and one to Market Wharf. The bridge should be removed, for it was utterly unsuitable to the requirements of the people. Its place could be supplied with a ferry similar to those used in some rivers of America. The Government had power undor a statute to buy the bridge at 10 per cent, on its costprico. He was glad the Government were willing to have the Wollongong line constructed, for ho believed that if it were constructed mile by mile, and a station placed at the end of each mile, for three-quarters of its length, it would pay its way. The people along the route were en- gaged in raising produce, and what might be considered a dense suburb extended as far as George's River. This would be one of the best-paying liaos they could undertake, and would extend the advaatages of railway communication to people who had not enjoyed thom but wore willing to pay for them as willingly as they had contributed towards the cost of other railways. They had used these people's taxes and credit and energy to extend railways in other directions to bring in goods to compete with those they produced. |Mr. H. C. DANGAR: They had cheaper communication now.] He was sure the hon. member would take a train in preference to a steamer. The time had come, in connection with their railway policy, when they must consider the northern and southern coast distriots." They could not go on in honour and justice without dome so, for the districts had been cutoff from the advantages of railway communica- tion yet had contributed largoly towards the cost of providing them for other people. Ho hoped the next coast extension would take place from Grafton to the table-land of New England, it was impossible to draw the traffic to Sydney from_ nuch a distance by the ordinary means of steam com- munication, and if they were not careful Brisbane would get it altogether. [A Voice : " It's going now."] The districts were the most valuable the colony possessed, and if thoy desired to secure their products they must bind them with a band of iron to the metropolis. With regard to the other proposals ot the Government, he did not think any would be objected to, except, perhaps, the line from Murrumburrah to Blayney. Mr. MURRAY said he would support the adjournment, and he hoped the Minister for Works would supply the Assembly with particulars of the surveys of the New Eng- land railway. He maintained that the "line would not be so , difficult to construct as was generally supposed, and he con- sidered the Northern members had been badly treated, for they bud beea led to believe that some portioa of the rail- way they required would have found a plnce oa the esti- mate. Mr. M'ELHONE asked the hon. Minister for Works whether he would give hon. members printed information ia reference to tho matters under discussion. Mr. LACKEY said the Government would give all the informatton they possibly could with regard to the surveys, estimates of probable expenditure, and the probable returns. (Hear, hear.) Mr. SUTHERLAND was glad to hear that the informa- tion asked 5or would be furnished to hon. members, because these proposals were some of the most important ever submitted. Ho should probably be found voting with the Government on their, nroDosals. Hut he honed the informa« tion asked for would .be given in sufficient time to enable the House and the country to consider it, in order that thoy might be in a position to deal properly with the proposals. Mr. FARNELL said that hon. members should have full information in dealing with this matter, which in- volved tho expenditure of £8,000,000. This would entail an expenditure of £400,000 for interest. As to the Northern line it seemed to him one of the most absurd things possible to tako it to Homo bush, and to bring the coal, wool, tallow, &c;, from the Northern district across the river and on to tho Western rail- way, which could not carry tho present traffic. They should tako the coal where natural staithos could be obtained, namely, on the northern banks of the river. This railway ought never to cross the river, and the torminus ought to tie somewhere opposite to Sydney. He desired that the Minis- ter for Works would furnish some information about the item of £500,000 for alterations and additions _ to station buildings and siding accommodation, to meet in- creasing traffic, inclusive of payments made in 1880 in anti- cipation of this vote. It was very questionable whether this money ought to be voted at all out of loans rather than out of surplus revenue. He thought this item would require a good deal of information, and ho hoped tho neces- sary details in reference to it would be furnished. In refer- ence to the Illawarra line, there could be no doubt that this railway would bo constructed sooner or later, and it was only a question which line should bo constructed first. He had had the pleasure of reading a letter from the Colonial ¡secretary when he was at Grafton, to the effect that the Government intended to construct a lino from the Clarence to tho New England district. He hoped that gomo explanation would be made in reference to this matter, and he would do his utmost to coerce the Government into including this line. (Hear, hear.) Mr. MELVILLE hoped the Government would adjourn the debate till Wednesday. i Mr. FERGUSSON supported tho adjournment to Wed I nesday. If tho Government had not given a direct pro- mise to favourably consider the New England railway thoy had implied as much when they asked him to withdraw the motion he had had on the paper in rcforence to the matter. Sir HENRY PARKES said it was desirable that the Government business should bo expedited in order to enable them to send their measures to the other ohambor. The Government, therefore, desired to press this debate forward ; but to meet the difficulty they would consent to give up Thursday to the consideration of private business. Although the expenditure proposed was very large-eight millions sterling-the subject was no more difficult than if it was the expenditure of so many hundreds. (Hear, hear.) Mr. BRUNKER and Mr. MELVILLE thought that a week's adjournment was not too much to ask for. Mr. POOLE also hoped the Government would grant thiB additional day. The question was put and agreed to on a division of 47 to 10. The CHAIRMAN left the chair, reported progress, and tha resolution. The resolution was read a second time, and adopted. OSBORNE ESTATE BILL. Mr. REID moved that the Osborne Estate Bill be read the first time. The motion was agreed to, and the bill read a first time. PAPER. Sir HENRY. PARKES laid on the table a return with reference to the purchase by tho Government of exhibits at the Sydney and Melbourno Exhibitions. Order was made for its being printed. PRECEDENCE OF BUSINESS. Sir HENRY PARKES moved that the Government business take precedence of general business on Tuesday next, 22nd March. Mr. MELVILLE objected. Sir HENRY PARKES begged the bon. member to withdraw his opposition, as it would cause considerable confusion. Mr. SUTHERLAND said he hoped tho hon. member would withdraw his opposition, though ho was quite justi- fied in his uction in view of the manner in which the hon. member and others had been treated by the Government. Mr. MELVILLE withdrovv his objection. Mr. COPELAND said ho was content to give precedence to Government business on Tuesday on the understanding that private membors would havo an opportunity of pro- ceeding with their business later on. The motion was agreed to. WAGGA GAS BILL. The SPEAKER reporter! the receipt from tho Legislativ« Council of the Wagga Gus Bill, with amendments. Mr. BURNS moved that tho consideration of tho Legis- lative Council's amendments be mado an ordor of the day for Friday next. The motion was agreed to. NO LIABILITY MINING BILL. The SPEAKER reported that he had received from tho Legislative Council the No- Liability Mining Bill, with amendments. Mr. COPELAND moved that tho consideration of tho Legislative Council's amendments be made an order of tho day for Friday next. The motion was agreed to. CHAPMAN ESTATE BILL. Mr. GARRETT brought up the Chapman Estate Bill, and moved that it be read the first time. The motion was agreed to, anl the bill was read a first time. WAYS AND MEANS. The House having resolved itself into Committee of Ways and Means, Sir HENRY PARKES moved that towards making good the supply granted to her Majesty, the sum of £150,000 be granted out of the Cousolidated Revenue. Tho motion was agreed to, and the House resumed, when the resolution was reported and agreed to. The Appropriation Bill was tuen brought in, and road the first time. ADJOURNMENT. Sir HENRY PARKES, in moving the adjournment, said he would proceed with, and if possible finish, the measures now before the House ; and with regard to the Local Government Bill, ho would movo the second reading pro forma on the last Government day of tho session, so that it might go before the country during tho recess. The House adjourned at quarter to 12 p.m. till 4 o'clock on Thursday.
