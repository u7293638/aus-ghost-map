A GHOSTLY SOCIETY. London is to have one more intellectual societyâ€”the new one to be devoted to the promotion of psychological research. The members are to recount their dreams and the effect of them retrospectively or prospectively, what communications in their time they may have received from tho other world through supernatural agents, ghostly or otherwise. The conditions and qualifications of membership are not too exacting ; men with tho weakest possible intellect mil be freely enrolled and " no questions asked." But they must believe in ghosts and apparitions, extend their mental vision beyond the boundary lines of this contemptible little globe, and thus in their day and generation add to the sum of human knowledge and research in an unexplored region which, up to the present, like the North Pole, resolutely refuses to reveal itself to human ken and become the subject of human investigation.
