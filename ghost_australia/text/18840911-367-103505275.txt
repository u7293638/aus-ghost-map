NOT M3ORE-NOT LESS. Carx was the night in that still summer weather, And calmer still and colder were the twain Who, parting then, might yet have kept together, Had pride not stronger been than even pain. There were no bitter tears, no signs of sorrow, No sad reproaches utter'd at the end; And, shoul, they meet--years hence-or on the morrow 'Twill be with courteous ease as Iriend meets friend. Oh! mocking words for those who once loved madly, Henceforth to be mere friends-not less-not more- Deep in nacth heart a death- knell sounded sadly For love, deemed deathless, in glad days of yore. Not more than friends-timhe voices must not falter, Lest broken tones betray a rain regret: And on the lips, the forced smile must not alter To show how, 'neath that mask, grief's lines amre set. Lot them take heed. lest any word be Epoken To rouse some ghost from out the buried past: Though the dear ties, that bound themt once, are broken, A strange spell lintgero yet, and holds them fast. Not less than friends-but, all! thie friendship offered Seems of such little worth now love is done; 'Tis hIard to take the hand thus coldly proffered, " And feel the tender, thrilling touch has gone. Gone with the day, when just one word was needed Those heavy clouds of pride andti doubt to lift: But all in vain, lroe's dying voice had pleaded; Now far apart, eacht loely life rmust drift. And she will never know, at their next umeeting, How hard tho fought all outward calm to gain; Nor will tet see, beneath the friendly greeting. How her trie heart still yearns to him through pain. =-E.ra lRoe.Irnnte, in IBelgravia.
