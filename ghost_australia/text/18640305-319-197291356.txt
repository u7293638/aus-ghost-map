PSEUDO LIBERALS AND THE . LAND BILL. ! The land measure now before Parliament fairly holds its own. both within and -without the walls of the House,i The verdict of the country is in its favor. Except amongst used-up patriots and uneasy political , adventurers there are no symptoms of hostility to a measure which, whilst it ' preserves the public faith with the pastoral tenants, opens the agricultural lands to the honest meaning cultivator upon easy terms. That the bill is perfect we are far from contend ing ; we would have a larger area annually open for selection, and we contemplate as dubious in their operation the grazing clauses. But taken all in all the Land Bill brought down by Mr. Heales is' by far the most liberal, practicable-looking and reasonable measure yet submitted to. Parliament. It is liberal, for the cultivator can employ his capital in the work ing and improvement of his farm instead of ex hausting his probably limited resources in the primary land purchase. It is practicablelook ing, for the bona fide agriculturist can, without doubt, secure his freehold at certain periods of or at the end of his lease, if he has been really carrying on farming business, whilst if he is but a wolf in sheep's clothing— a land shark in difiguise — the non-fulfilment of conditions will effectually bar his monopolising proclivities. '.t is a reasonable bill, for itgoe3 far to remove the squatting community from an attitude of antagonism to agricultural settlement. The bill thus fairly aims at putting the land law of the colony at length upon an equitable basis and to terminate the vendetta which has so long vexed the country out of all patience. But there are interests to serve other than those of the country. There are hungry place men to whom the: repose of the Treasury benches viewed afar off seems very (tempting Plotting schemers there are, who are ever ready to postpone or mar the public weal if a personal end may thereby be. gained. To them the . cold shade of opposition is terribly frigid. The ghosts of by-gone Treasury orders flit by on quarfer-day, and so the political patriot is roused to action for his country's cause. The triumvirate 'who [so boldly desire to play the parts of tribunes of the people at St. George's Hall have no following. They are Vats without tails. Their exclusion from the ! ExeeB&ye; Council boardsite sorely on them. Itranklesdeep and the venom is sufilcieiitly effective to drive them to be the tools or accomplices of the ultra squatting section in the House. The mode of Mr Brooke's accession to office, upon the oeea-t sion of the ousting of the Nicholson Adminls-1 tration, is not quite forgotten. He was the connecting link,'the go-between, the smoother of difficulties, who arranged that strange and ivpnofniMil ^najif.iirvn wbifill . T)ln.oed Mp Ui$q$§ng ^^^^03Mv0^gum: ? ;?

Politicians, like other meni are known by the company they keep, and although Mr Brooke had led' thV assault, against the last O'Shanassy Ministry, tottering from inherent decay, he was excluded from the reward of the conqueror. The . charmed circle was closed to him — he could not be trusted.' He had coquetted with this party and that— he had worn liberal colors — but underneath were detected the tints of a suspicions livery. ' So Mr Brooke again betook himself to. opposition— his principles not being of that enduring and disinterested kind which last steadfastly, on the Government side— ^-gratis. Rather than suffer exclusion longer, Mr Brooke is at his old tricks. He bawls loudly for a more liberal land measure, ' and simultaneously fraternises with the mem ber for Kilmore and the squatting interest. He would again endeavor to gain office liy liberal professions, whilst submitting to be manipulated by Mr O ' Shanass Y. behind the scenes. The re jcuuuu vi tile present) uietisiuts vvuuiu pnjuu.uiy precipitate a return to auction, and what could so. well serve the ultra-squatting party ? The capitalist would have the game at his foot as of old, and bona fide settlement would be hopelessly deferred. Mr Brooke on the stump inveighed against the principle of MrHEALEs's bill. It may be over long to cast the view backwards in the career of a politician of the Brooke stump, but we cannot forbear reminding this gentleman of his beaurideal of a land bill at the period of his ejectionfrom office, at the end of 1861\. Feted by his Geelong constituents, and. warmed by the generous- juice of the Barrabool Hills, he thus pain tedin roseate colors the occu pation licenses, and the still, more liberal measure he had in contemplation. ? ? . : . . ' Under * the license system,' ? said . Mr Brooke, ' a man ? had- se-ven years' credit for the whole of his purchase money. He is called upon to pay 2s 6d per acre during that period, but at any time can ask.the Government to put up his allotment for 'sale, and Government would do so; and with the liberal valuation allowed for improvements, experience showed that the occupier invariably gets it; We in tended to make assurance doubly sure by bringing forward a bill, as' soon, as there was the remotest possibility of .its passing the Upper emption, and not subject him to competition by auction.' ? ? This, and more than this, does the* new Land Bill achieve, and Mr , Brooke .. pretends dissatisfaction with a measure which outstrips in its reality his after dinner anticipation of possibilities at Geelong. Instead of 2s 6d per acre the occupier pays only Is 6d per annum. He is not subjected to competition by auction, and his improvements are his own, the land costing him the fixed price of 20s per acre at the termination of his seven years' lease. But Mr Brooke has said much more which rises up in judgment against his present attitude. On the occasion we have already alluded to he pointed out the advantages of permitting the cultivator to get upon the land without outlay of capital in purchasing it. 'Supposing a man were to take up a 100 acre farm,'- said he, 'either under the Nicholson system or Mr Duffy's, in either casehe'paid £56 5s cash, while, under the licenses he paid but £3 2s 6d.' 'This,' con tinues the speaker, ' is a great advantage to the working classes of the colony. Many a man who can command the smaller sum and retain sufficient to crirry on his farm, is not able to1 comply with the demand of either of the' other systems. The distinguishing inejfifc of the occupation licenses system is this, that cultivation is the test of settlement,, whereas MivDufpy proposed to make capital the test of settlement. A man,' without he could command money, is not to be allowed by' Mr Duffy to go upon the land, whereas the Heale8 Government; said that the man who possessed the smallest amount pf money, and' was desirous of becoming a bona fide cultivator should be the inan to go upon the land and possess tfc,' ?'. , '.,' ' The liberal principles which Mr Brooke out of office then profes's'ed Mr Heales practically proposes to effectuate. He has gone beyond the occupation licenses, and, his former colleagues'., liberal pvomis.es, and yet. Mr Brooke, feigns indignation that ko has not done more.
