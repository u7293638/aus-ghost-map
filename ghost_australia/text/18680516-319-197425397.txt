It \ was enough ; for me. tb know, on that day in the j Ward, that the. farms r's cart .was. waiting ,for me at: the, street corner.. : I was not slow, to get ; into -ityr tot. it was the first ride I eyers had ia ? my life. .- It;.maide; ,rae sleepy, and I slept.' First,: I ttared at Preston- streets,; as long as j .they lasted, and meanwhile,;! may have bad j some, small ;.dumb- ^wondering 'within me; wherebonts pur cellar was. ? Bufcl/ dqubt.it. ; Such a .worldly little devil was I,, that I took | no thought, who would, bury Father and Mo ;ther,vor; where, they would be buried, or when.' The question whether the eating, and, drinking ; by day; and the ,. covering by night, would be; as :gppd at,th/e farm-hou.se as at the Ward, su perseded; those/questions. '., ,. . .,.-.. . The jolting of the cart on a tough stony road \ .awoke me, and I fpupd that wa.were mounting: a steep hill, where the, road, was a rutty by .road through a field. And so, by fragments of an ancient terrace, and by some rugged out buildings that had, once , been fortified, and , passing: under ^a rained gateway, we came to| ? the 'old ,f ayjn-hpuse;in the thick stone^ wallput side the old, quadrangle of Hoghton' Towers.; Whip.Ti T.TnriicflrTnf;. lilrfl n. stnnirt nnvsicrn ?; Rftfiinc' no speciality in ; seeing np;antiquity .in; as-, earning ajl/farm-hpuses -to resemble it ; as sjgning.the tlepay I noticed to the one. potent, . causa of allruin thatl knew— Poverty ; eyeing the pigeons in' their flights, the cattle in their stalls,' the ducks 'in the pond; and the fowls peeking abput.theyard, with, a hungry hope that plenty of them might be killed for dinner while: I stayed there ; wondering whether the scrubbed dairy-vessels drying in the sunlight could be the goodly, porringers out of .which the master ate his belly-filling food, and which, hie. polished, when ha had done, according to my Ward ex perience; t shrinking doubtful whether the shadows passing over that airyheight on the bright spring day were, not something in the nature of frowns ; sordid, afraid, nnadmiring, a small brute ta shudder at. /. , /, ?-,. To that time I had never had the faintest impressien of beauty. I had had no knowledge ; whatever that there was anything lovely, in this life. ,,When I ha^: .occasionally slunk up. the cellar-steps into the street and glared in at shop windows, I had done so with no higher feelings than we maysuppose to ammatea mangy young dog, or wolf-cub'. It is equally the fact that I had never been alone, in the sense of holding unselfish converse iwith myself. I- had been solitary often enough, but nething better. SuchiWasL.my condition when I sat ? down /to my .dinner, that day, in the Idtbhen of the okl farm-house. Such was my condition when I lay on my „ bed in the old farm-house that night, stretched out opposite the narrow. mut- lioaed window, in the cold light of the. moon, like a young Vampire. ?' : ? What do I know, now, of Hoghton Towers? Very little, for I have been gratefully unwill ing to disturb my .first, impressions,. A house, centuries old , on high gi- ound a mile or so removed from the road bat ween Preston and Blackburn,' where the first James of England ia his hurry to make money by making barb nets, perhaps, made some of those remunera tive dignitaries. .A house, centuries old, de-1 serted and falling to pieces, its -woods and gardens long., since grass/ land' or, ploughed up, the rivers Ribble and Darwen glancing below it, and a vague hnza, of smoke against which net :even the sriperriatnral' presoience of tbe first Stuart could' foresee a Counter blast, hinting at steam power, powerful in two distances. ,, .... '-. ,' ' ' . What did I know, then, of Hpghton Towers ? When I first peeped in at the gate of the life less quadrangle, and started from the/moul dering statue .becoming 'visible to me like its Guardian Ghost,; when I . stole round by the back of 'the' farm-house and got in, airiong the ancient, rooms, many of them with their flqoirs and ceilings falling, , the. boamsand rafters hanging dangerously down, the plaster 'drop ping as I trod,/the oaken panels stripped away, the .windows half walled up, half, broken: when I discovered a gallery corii ',' manding the. old kitchen, and looked down be tween balustrades upon . a massive old table and benches, fearing to see I know riot what dead-dlive creatures come in and seat theriv Belves arid look up with I know not what dreadful eyes, or lack of eyes, at me ;. when all ?T®r *^i? !^?M0 ? w?^ ???lV ^v SaP9 «nd ohinks where the fiky stared BoiTowfnlly at me, where the birds passed, and. -the ivy rustled, and the stains -of -winter.
