Selects! Pootry- MAIIY'S GHOST. A PATJIERK: BALLAD. 'Twas in the middle of the night, l'o Jilecp young William tried, VViien Mary's ghost came stealing in, And atood at his bed-aide. 0 William dear ! 0 William dear ; My rest eternal ceases -, Alas ! my everlasting peace Is broken into pieces. 1 thought the last of all my cares Would end with my last minute ; But tho' 1 went to my long home, - I didn't stay long in it. The body snatcliers they have come, And made a sn itch at me ; It's very hard them kind of men Won't let a body be? You thou-jht that I was buried deep Quite decent like aud chary, But from her ^rave in Mary-bone, They've come and boned your Mary. The arm that used to take your arm Is took to Dr. Vyse ; And both my legs are gone to walk The hospital at Guy's. I vow'd that you should have my hand, But fat's gives no denial, You'll lind it there, at Doctor Bell'«, In spirits aud a ph'al. As for my feet, the littlo feet Ymi used to call so pretty, There's one, 1 know, in Bedford Row, The t'otlier'fj in the city. I can't, tell where my head is gone, But Doctor Carpue oiu . As for mv trunk, it's all pack'd up To go by Pickford's van. I wish you'd yeu go to Mr. P. And save me such a ride.; I don't half like the outside place, They've took for my inside. The cock it crows—I must be gone ! My William, we muat part ! But I'll be yours iu death, altho' Sir Astley has my heart. Don't go to weep upon my grave, Aud think that there I be ; They haven't left an atooi there Of my anatomic.
