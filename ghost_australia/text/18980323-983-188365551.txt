Bob'e treatment nearly gave ClaxtonbU final promotion-hot , degradation. Hot that's the story. I ■ Bob visa a strappmg young fellow of twenty two, smart and steady, vrith a head full of technical school, and xh'Irrepressible desire to get on.

Nonqqn, a frolicsome lad of nineteen, was in ths fitting-shop learning the business. Bob and he had becomewttaohed to each other. One hot duly afternoon Norman had slipped oot to have a dip inthe works1 reservoir. He was a poor swimmer, and after swimming into deep water became exhausted. His cries for help brought the hands out of the moulding-shop en matte. Seeing a bead in the rt tetvoir, Bob Crewdson dashed into the watcji and after a hard struggle deiiositeu Norman Westleigh on th bank, more dead than alive, for which notion Charles Norman Westleigh ioii his son woe ever after grateful. The •Utehmant between Bob mod Norman grew stronger. ■' Ouoerons and true-hearted, Bob Crewdson detested Olaxtuu ** He's a disgrace to. the works," he would say. 41 If I Wbre priucip'al I'd clear him in twenty minutes ** Claxton learned of the mutinous tbodgbbs and' feelings which possefmod Bob Crewdson, and would gladly have kicked him out of the plans. But Claiton'a autburity fell aliort of any Mimmary execution 1 or disrating of Crewdson. And each of them | knew it. The latest addition to the Urge staff pf the Crauelea Works wis a wisp Of a boy named I'eter. He was a wee, blue-uyeil laddie, with hair as soft and light as flax, and, according to the beat information to hand, was nobody's child. He was 13, hri'd come out of an mphsu-1 age, and was living with an old woman"whose I principal means- of' livelihood was an old-] fashioned and creaky mangle. Peter bad conn into the works to make his living, like a mio. - Olaxton bullied the boy until he cried from] sheer bewilderment. . On« cold and stormy dby I Claxton sent Peter out for his own dinner.

A' lmtd laugh brok« involuntarily from the men as they observed the disaster, and three of them ran to the aid of little Peter. Claxtongraw blai& as thunder. Storming at the lad for "being a clumsy young fool he administered to him a heavy cuff whirl atretohed him a eeoond lime on thelssnd.. " 'Bre." he growled, *' Go right back to uiy Louse and bring some more dinner, and let me see you throw that aw'ay and Til sack yon. Go on, you little fool!" :• ft wis raining hard.

At night the lad went home chilled to the marrow, took to his bed, and remained in it for nearly a month, tenderly oared for by the old mangle woman. ., r " .The scamp wants ^Sooting for treating the kil in that way," said Bob Crewdson, learning that little Peter waa atdtome straggling with a fever brought on by exposure to the rain. 4,PH pay him off for that aosjehow, or my nameisn'i Crewdson," be added savagely. -o ''At half-past five o'clock^ tb*t night Bob Al J-I kfl&ACjWr-JU-l;'it. -i LI j CrewdsOir ahfl-NdftoinWestleigh were observed in subdued oouVersalibn in the engine-house.
