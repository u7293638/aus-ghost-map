" By an interesting coincidence the sub- ject of a revival of whaling in these waters is exciting attention here and in England. A cablegram in this journal on Thursday stated that a paper had been« read before the British. Association for the Advancement v>f Science, dealiug with Antarctic explora- tion, in which Mr. J. SCOTT KELTIE, a geo- graphical authority, had discussed the probability of whalers doing part of the work if subsidised with a I bonus. Hero a number of events have given riso to the correspon- dence in these columns. It is natural, when whales are seen within a few miles of Circular Quay, and when activity' is being displayed iu New Zealand to equip a ship to test the southern latitudes for whales, thut people should recall the state of this industry in past years, and should ask, What hinders a revival of so enterprising and profitable a business ? lu the thirties it was no small part in the industry of New South Wales that was filled by the whaling and the sealing. In the year 1836 thoro were 40 ships engaged, of 7644 tons, and bearing crews of 828 men, and the value of their take of whole oil (spermaceti and black), as well as of seal- skins, was £126,085. Two years later there were thirteen moro ships and 66 more men employed, hut the yield of spermaceti oil and of seal- skins fell off, and the value of the produce of the fishery sank to £117,474. Of course we must recollect that in those J days New South Wales covered all the] eastern mainland from Torres Strait to Bass's. Still, Sydney and Twofold Bay had a good share of the trade, and many a man, since successful and honoured in other walks of life, made his first venture on the "lay" of a whaler out of Port Jackson. Ada to the British I ships the goodly number of Yankee craft all the way from the Atlantic States, and it can bo imagined that half a century ago Australasian waters were worth an enterprising man's attention. What is there to show in this branch of maritime activity to-day ? Little enough, save at Norfolk Island ; and tho fallen fort unos of the southern whaling are attested by the fact that it is considered in England that a bonus might be offered to whalers in order that tiley should visit Antaietio latitudes, combining tho in toi est of science with that of "try- ing out " lliero aro few who would not like to see that ti ade revive, puiged of some features which were gross in then scorn of regaid for man or brute Apart from theso features it was a fine school for seamiiu ship and for manhood The flayed and reeking carcase of Le, intlian, a prey to sea birds and sharks as to the «eamen, or the deck of a ship w hile the blubber wus being " tried out, ' was not a pleasing spectacle, but the spoil that was to pay each officer and man aboard m a sort of quarter deck and lorecastle socialism was only secured at the riBk ot eveiy man's life, and oiten at the loss of boat and bont'screw lhere was ever that perüsuper added to tho ordinary dangers of the deep, and there was, too, a special neod foi vigour and dexterity and nleitness, from which necessities it lesulted that as a class tlie whalers woie the eh to of the sea, just as their ships were often among tho fineBt To such things a maritime people should not be mdif feront But is it of any avail to hope for i return of the whaling? When we quote tho statistics of fifty years ago we have to remember that whaling, in northern as in sou hern latitudes, is not what it was, and unless we can discern tho commercial promise of the veulure it is vum to dil ite upon the value of the industiy in other respects Speaking bioadly, it may be said that baleen oü is haidlv worth the taking nowa- days, since jietroleum and artificial lubri cants aro so cheap and effective But there still is a market for sperm oil, which tan not be supeiseded for delicate machinery and for übe in ninnufactuies lhat Dundee whalers should \isit the longitude of the Cape m Southern waters, as was done lutclj, shows that there is mono,, in the industry suffit lent to worrant vojnging tar for tho right whale The Scottish ships did not find the spermaceti whale lho crucial point of the w hole luquny is whether n sufhcient quantity of tho sperm whale is to be found in our waters It is not \eiy uselul to fall back upon records of the paBt to ascertain whereubouts the fishery was best Bass's Straits and the eastward waters wero the good region But tho inei ease of traffic and the disturbance of , then haunts within seveial decades past i muy have caused the migration of "the N aluablo cetacean It is indisputable that ßomo aro 6till about the coasts, tor, besides tho lcgular whuhng off Norlolk Island, iho cieatuies are uften seen from the! mainland or from a passing vessel, though m these cases it may bo tho common and not the apel m whole that is seen Arguing about tho industry is not yery helprul until more is known as to the dis tubutiou of tho fash In these columns such investigation has repeatedly been uiged, whether for itself or as part of au expedition into high polai latitudes As he Nen ¿¡colanders intend to go eastwaid, thon researches will not bo immediate!} nuittul for us Perhaps the most useful thing that is piacticable, in the absonce ol initiativ e of our ow n, is that tin ough the good oihces ol the Piennei and the Agont Geneinl, the Dundee shipowucis bhould be inyited to dnect their yessels, upon the piojocted yo} age to the falklands, to make a yibit into Australasian yyaters There aro some patent objections to this course, 1' mg piinci|ially m tho lact that tho ven tuie is a pin ate tommeicialouo , and in such caso the Dundee ships, if thoy come hero at all, will come in their own interest, and not in ours Still, what else is likely to bo done ? Whon Barons NOHDLT\6KJOIJ> and DIOKSON offered to paitly equip an Antarctic expedition we w oula not support it, and private energy seems lacking It is only in accordance with the , manners of politics that some of the t Luglisb journals opposed to tho Ministry 1 should proless to see something sinister t and m}6tonous behind the reasons ' assigned by Sir HLMIY NOBMAI. for * his withdrawal of his acceptance c ol tho post of Viceioy of India, but ' to minds uniniected with the malad} of . suspicion those reasons «A ill probably a nppear sufficient Sir HENRY NORMAJT IS , a soldier, and his first natuial impulse » w hen the offer was made to him was to t view it as a call of duty, and to ac- 1 copt it at once When time was » allowed for reflection other consideiations e caine in Sir HLVRY IS nearly 67 joais Í of ago Not too old, as wo view matters in j those days of longevity and ot the lulo of ¥ the world by veteians, for a man to go on c performing the most onerous work in the C position in which he may rmd himself. I But it is an advanced age for a man to commit himself to the heavy and anxious and responsible duties whioh fall to the lot of the Viceroy of India. It 'must, moreover, be remembered that Sir HENRY NORMAN has an intimate knowledge of what those duties aro. He knows the work, and ho knows the climate. At the expiration of bia term of olfiue he would be 72. We do not know that the supreme rule in India was ever held by a man of these years, and especially by one who had already had an experience of India. As lending confirmation to the reasons mentioned by Sir HENRY NORMAN for his withdrawal, wo may recall that when the Indian papers were two or threo woeks ago canvassing the appo ntmont, tlioy did not espress themselves adversely to it, save that they held that " a younger man should have been seleotod." Tho Indian press knows tho work, the climute, and the burden, " wollnigh not to be boine," of the groat and onerous position. So does Sir HENRY NORMAN. It is easy to under- stand that Mr. GLADSTONE, " in the energetic vigour of his 84th year, should regard Sir HENRY NORMAN as still in the flush of youth and promise. The question as to when one is too old to enter ou so great a task is one which every man must decide for himself, and it is one whioh in the present case Sir HENRY NORMAN was eminently qualified to determine by his full knowledge of the work and the conditions under which it has to be done. When we consider the splendour of the position and the tempta- tions of many kinds to accept it at all hazards, the publio is not likely to fail to appreciate the conscientious self questioning which has led Sir HENRY NORMAN to the aot ol self-abnegation implied in his withdrawal, an act some aspects of which curiously recalls General GORDON'S withdrawal from the post of private secretary to Lord Kirox as Viceroy of India, even alter he had started to enter on the duties of his office. The publio works statement, submitted last night in the Now Zealand Parlia- ment, presents a case that may well excite intorest throughout Australia. The steadfastness with which that colony adheres to the determination to borrow no more money is un- abated, for wo are warranted in believing that the action of the Government is the reflex of the will of the people. Yet public works require to bo carried on, and, tho money has to be found some- where ; and the Government finds it in the year's revenue. In other words, tho people are determined to pay as they go, and instead of looking to others to help them, they meet the year's require- ments of publio works by putting their hands in their oyTn pockets. Tho procoss is so natural and so simple that pity is that all the colonies have not loarned it, and learned it long ago ; and New Zealand is rendering a service to the colonies in leading tho way in thin most exemplary procedure. The sums are not largo, but in proportion to tho popula- tion and the total revenue, throe-quarters of a million devoted to railways and other public works is a handsome amount, especially when taken straight out of the people's oyvn pockets. It looks small by the side of the millions taken on loan from creditors in London, and so cheerily scattered every year in any of the colonies. But yve dare say thoro yvill be moro solid satisfaction found in spendiug it when the people fool that it is their oyvn, and that they will not be called to pay it back or to squeeze out interest for it year by year indelinitoly. Even that oxpenui turo will bo made to do double service, for the workmen receiving the money aro to be encouraged to make homos for themselves on the lands adjacent to thoir employment ; so thut not only will this creditable sum from the surplus roveuuo promote public worliB, but to an equal extent promoto tho permanent settlement of country. There may be legislation in New Zealand of yvhich we may not approve ; but tho Government of that colony has sot a good example to the colonies in. its simple practical fashion of dealing with finance. THE GOVEBNOB'S INDISPOSITION.-Yesterday his Excellency the Governor, yi'ho was suffering from «light indisposition, was seen by his medical adviser, and pronounced to be much improved. His Excellency, however, kept to hiB room during tho greater part of the day, nnd did not accompany Lord Hopetoun to tim Randwick course as he had intended doing. A parly from Government House put io an appear unco during the afternoon on the racecourse, aud in the evening a ball was given at Government Home.

The Governor's bpeeoh. has not yet been agreed to, nor havo tho nuinos of the mover and seoouder of the Address lu Reply been decided The Opposition will not hold a meeting, and it is not likely that anything will bo done until the Governor s speech bus been delivered A protectionist demonstration is how - ei er, being arranged Tbo principal speakers will be country members In addition to others, there will bo representatives from Cootamundra, Bathurst, and Lismore, the idea being tor co ntry delegates to inform cityppoplo " what a lot of good protection has dono for the country " IsiTEBltuTlIOV ON THE OvEBI^Ml TELTOBAPn LrsE-Tho Postmaster-General has received the following from Adelaide -"The Port Darwin line has failed botwren Powells Cn ok and Daly Waters Cabio business his been arranged for % ia Roebuck Bay, but Perth advises that the Roebuck Bay Uno is working badly VISIT TO THE HARBOUB ISLANDS -Tho trustee« of tho islands in tho harbour will make thoir annual n«it on Monday, and will be accompanied bv the Minister for Lands.

B. Elwell, engineer, Electrical Engineering Branch of the Railway Department, and Mr. G. F. Clements of the same department ; Mr. J. W. Tyrer, assistant engineer for tram- ways ; Mr Matthew Nimmo, locomotive officer in charge of the North Sydney cable tram ; and Mr C. Peters, traffic inspector ; Mr. J. F. Cullen, M.L.A. ; Mr Alexander McKnight, Mayor of North Sydney ; Dr. R. D. Ward, Alderman Elliott, Rev. Roger McKinnon, and Messers. M.H. Kingsbury, F. J. Cahill, Hodgson, F. W. Hanson, and R. Oxlade, C.E.E. A stay was made at the Spit-road for a few minutes, to enable the visitors to appreciate the surrounding scenery. The return journey was then entered upon, and when the tram arrived at Ben Boyd-road, Neutral Bay, the passengers dismounted and took up a position on a grass patch at the roadside, where the Mayor ot North Sydney took the opportunity to congratulate those present on the convenience now afforded them for reach- ing the Spit by means of the new electric tram. He, thought they should thank the Government for having given them the line. Mr. J. F. Cullen, M.L.A., said that he looked upon the opening of the electric tramway as marking a new epoch in the history of the district and of the country as regards its tramway systems. Having referred to the cheapness ol' the fare and the ex- ellence of the work which had been accomplished by the officers of the department, Mr. Cullen con- cluded by congratulating the people of Mosman, Neutral Bay, and North Sydney upon being brought into connection with each other. He pro- posed "Success to the Electric Tram." Mr. J. W. Tyrer, assistant engineer for tramways, re- sponded on behalf of the oflicers of the depart- ment, and said that the hope of the Railway Commissioners was that the line would prove a financial success. I'utNTiNO AT WILCANKU._Mr. H. V. Jackson,' rulittving forestor at Wilcannia, has submitted a report to the TJuder-Seeretuiy for Miues relating co the plantation there. Planting was commenced on 14th August and completed on 4th September. The quantity of plants reoeivod from Goslord wai 30,000. With tho exception of some 800 planta in tubes, the balance was open-rooted. A considerable quantity of pine was inolnded in the consigument, also a considerable quantity of small open-rooted eucalypti., Tlio great proportion of opcu-rooted plants wai against the success of the planting. In planting in the Western division, he would recommend that open-root planting should be on a limited scale. Since hie previous visit there had been an abundant growth of herbage on tho ground, aud it wat difficult to find many of the small plant« ; but a careful examination of the ground satisfied him that a large proportion of the plants was alite and growing. Five bugs ef bamboo tubes were re- ceived from Gosford Nursery. These had been set with sugar-gum seed, and a quantity of pott had been set with white pine seed.
