An effort was then made by the goldfields meffiben to throw the bill out; fcot the landed intereafe.ms too strong for them,' and, therefore, the bill was carried in just the ,aame state as it had left the hanHs x/t the committee.

A caae presenting some painfnl phases came under the notice of Messrs Claxton and Glenny wben'offiOTting in their capacities as honorary jnstices at the CSty lock-up yesterday morning. They were desired to sign a warrant of commitment of a young married woman named Annie Sophia Graham to the Innatic'asylum, a mediail certificate signed by Drs Scott {of Boninyong) and Bnnoe hatiCyiiig that she was of unsound mind. Mia Gnbpm was .brought in frotn Biscocks on Tuesday night by the Bomhyoog police, and- lodged in the lunacy oeSs at Cfty kxi-tip. She wM very quiet aQ nvht, snd nn' the morning, when Mr CHuctoo saw her, he positiviiy dedinsd to sign any, waiiant of oopimitmebt. 'ie he tNKi>ved her to- bt toerely auflforiug from ddirioni * from e • hiuStiua, fVrafli|ueBt npop recent ccflfiDtmait Mra. Otahampreaented no ^ipparsiye <if. insatMy' when the honorary justices saw her; and. they considered that she was more a fit patient for the Benevolent Aeylnffl or Hospital than for. a lunatic asylum. ' Thfey tried to get her adniitted to the Benevtden^ 'AB^tun, "but l>r Solthoose examining ber, conodered-that she did not come unoer tbe category of persons eligible .for AdBli2£ion ^o it. Messrs Claxton aad Glenny then waited on Dr Owen at the fibspital, and .nfflteltailsd the matter to him, aod asked hint-; to admit' the tniTerer.. Dr Owen reptied -tfaat it agafkirt tbe rides bf:the Hospital teSadmit any person suffering fcom insanity,' bit Df Bonce statimr-.that be-^bougti^ the treat-; mant at tbe.Hb^ital would prove beneficial to her, aad-that efae vonld not be, trooblesome (on account tot josanHy 1 ); Dr Oweir deaded.to admit the imfortonate woman. She wis accordingly takein to the fioapit&L; In speaking of her cue, DrOwon a»id she was, he i»lieved, siiS&iing; from, .mel»n-; cholia, resulting ^ f^nfi^^Mi^ri^ and that with« few weeks' qaiet-nuning she' would, in' all' probability, recover. Should die prove violent, however;he wpoldhave no other coinrae than to eead her to a tnnatic aaylnm. ' We 'are informed"-Oiit "Dr3iince, though he considered £Hrs Graham to be of: unsound mind when fee-signed the certificate" of insanity, -thought her hardly a fil-subje^t for'the lunatic asylum, but he completed £the! certificate rather thaa«bc should be kept, in, her-weak atrte,in the. lunatic cella at the C5ty lock-up .for any Jtime, aod.ic order to| expedite an enqnity. Doubtless" in making out the certificate of insanity Dr Scott had: strong grounds for belief'that Mn'Otahamr could not be kept under' proper supervision in her own home, and feared the conseqnencea ot her malady failing such supervision. What circumstances transpired to allow of her being conveyed from Bctmnyong to Ballarat and lodged in the lunatic cells at the City lock- up, when her oonditaotr whs such that she needed medical attentibn,' and careful nursing, we do not know,'-but It is a patent fact that, but for-the. determised humanity of. Mean Claxton and Glenny, the poor woman'now in iht Hospital, and saf from a malady wbiA qmetness and _ nursing will qi all probability cure in a few wedes, would now be on her way toalnnatic asylum, with' what probable result from the journey and detention with lunatics we do not like to contemplate.
