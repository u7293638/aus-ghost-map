We had quite a pads in front of our bouse frith the eealed parlour, aad bappeniag to be oalled home at midday aooa after tbe wild rosea began to bloom in my wife's pale oheeks, I was struck by the singular markings in the park walk.

I was not a jealous husband, but what 1 read en the four faces of my fsmily stuck la my crop, as they say, and, like that Bhakesporian ghost, it wouldn't dawn. However, I held my peaoe and bided my time. Bet surprises were com ing in quick succession, for only a few days thereafter, on returning home from my bank at so t-nlier hour than usual, I found the living* room, kitchen, and shed empty, and was dum foumled lo hear a perfect roar, a Babel of voices, issuing from—Great heavens I Gsuld it be P Ve«i the parlour must be the eoeae of all this Lubbub, immoderate laughter, and family circus 1 Stcppiog to the door lightly I oarefully pu bid it baok, and here is what 1 saw Baby Ned tat oo the piano, driving my Kapbael wilb a pair of silken curds for reins.
