SERICULTURE. ?-. THE following letter has been addressed to Dr. Bennett, by Mr. Charles Brady, on the silkworm " Manly, 20th December, 1869. " George Bonnett, Es q , M. D. , F. LS, ic, etc, lion Sicrtfctrj Acclimatisation Society New South Wales "Dear Sirs-I have carefully examined the parcel of silkworms eggs just arrived from India, and have the pleasure to say that although the varieties are in part similar to some of my own, they form a very desirable and valuable addition to the useful sorts which Australia is now acquir- ing The society may be congratulated on the success which has in Una instance attended the Viceroy's efforts to HBfiHl the difficult enterprise of introducing the silk indus try into AUBU alia the eggs were admirably picked, and arrived in perfect condition. "A portion of the eggs was already hatched so that a further short delay would have been fatal, but there is every probability of saving enough of each breed for repro- decide in the colony. " There appears to be two, if not three separate varieties -one a high CURES race from italy byway of India, a second unnamed, the third Japanese green (apparently different to that already imposed by the Society) partly acclimatised in India by Dr. De Vecchi, from whose estate also the Italian eggs were obtained. "At present the j ming worms appear healthy though small and pricked-it will probably take two or three generations to bring them up to our standard-indeed pretty well all my experience goes to convince me more and more that the flesh food and new climate both operate powerfully towards restoring the natural vigour which, is now so many years, appears to have deserted the finest stocks of silkworms in Europe-and there are not wanting symptoms that even the pure and clean races of Japanese v varieties may shortly become more or less desolated by the same scourge which has deprived several millions of people in li ance and Italy of their most alluring and profitable occupation " What I mean by our standard, is simply that degree of health and physical vigour in the silkworm, which, for three consecutive years, gives it power to commence, under ordinary circumstances, its natural course in due Benson, to passing through all its changes without disproportionate casualty (its management without unusual difficulty or special pains), to consummate] its progress in forming a firm, stout, and clean cocoon of moderate size, and whose mother neither too bulky nor too attenuated, is perfect in its form, development, and covering of down. This standard is attained by continued and assiduous attention, first to cleanliness, second to rigid selection, and thirdly to judicious use of various kinds of mulberry as food plants, according to season one kind being used from first to last (or at any rate during the last two stages at least) with the males, and a different man- here with the females Pure races bred in and in in this way, soon acquire additional vigour, and are afterwards much more manageable than I found them on their first introduction, " I remain, dear Sir, yours faithfully, " CHARLES BRADY."
