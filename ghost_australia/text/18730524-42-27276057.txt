THE DEBTS OF THE WORLD. IT may be useful at the present moment, when our attention is being prominently directed to our own expenditure, to reflect on the burdens under which other nations are unhappily groan- ing. It U not a very easy matter to discover the actual indebtedness of either Europe or the world; but it is possible to give an approximate estimate of the total liabilities of continental nations. There are seven European nations which owe upwards of £100,000,000 Men. They are :— Great Britain £790,000,000 France 748,000,000* Italy $60,000,000 Bussia 856000,000 Austria M 6,000,000 Spain .'. 261,000,000 Turkey 124,000,000 , £2,944,000,000 'l he debt of the German Empire amount! to a little over £85,000,000. The different States composing it, however, owe in the aggregate about £178,000,000. The liabilities of the Empire may, therefore, be probably placed at about £206,000,000. The debts of the eight most heavily encumbered European countries may in this way be raised to about £3,152,000,000! There are six other countries in Europe which owe their creditors more than £10.000,000, but. less than £100,000,000. They are:— . Holland £80,000.000 Portugal 64,000,000 Belgium 27,000,000 Greece 18,000,000 Boumania 18.000,000 Denmark ... 12,000,000 £214,000,000 These six countries, then, add £214,000,000 to our previous total, and raise the national libalities of Europe to £3,366,000,000. It must be remembered that we.have exoluded from this category all fractions of a million, and the debts of all States which owe less than £10.000,000. Nor should it be forgotten that in most cases the only returns which are avail able are one or two years old, and that, there fore, the national debts of Europe are probably greater than the figures at which we have placed them. We shall probably be within the mark in saying that, without including the liabilities of municipalities, the national debts of Europe exceed at the present moment £8,400,000,000. The relative charges which these debts involve does not correspond with their relative amounts. Here are a few of them :— Country. Debt . Interest Katep.c Italy ... £360,000,000 ... £30,800,000 ... 8* France... 748,000,000 ... 27,700,000 ...

The debts of the rest of the world are happily much mailer than those of Europe, but even these are considerable. America, of course, heads the list. The different American bta.es owe:— United State* £433,000,000 Brazil 67,000,000 Canada ... \ 21,000 COO Argentine Bepublio ... 16,000,000 ' ! Venezuela 14.000,000 Peru 12,000,000 Mexico 10,000,000 £573,000,000 Asia follows America at a considerable dis tance. Her chief debts are:— British India £108,000,000 Japan 27,000,000 £185,000,000 Our different Australian colonies owe in the aggregate £38,000,000. The chief African debts are those of— Egypt £28,000,000 Morocco 10,000,000 Capetown 1,000,000 £39,000,000 The chief debts, then, in each ot the fire great divisions of the world, amount in the aggregate to the following sums:— Europe £3,400,000,000 America 573,000,000 Asia 135,000,000 Africa 39,000,000 Australasia 38,000,000 £4,186,000,000 If we add only £15,000,000 to this total for minor omissions, we are compelled to conclude that the nations of the world owe their creditors £4,200,000,000—a sum which at only 4* per cent, must involve a charge of £189,000,000 a year! The figure! are so stupendous that is hardly possible to comment on them. Bat it is a suggestive circumstance, that with three ex ceptions—the United States, Germany, and our selves—all these countries are steadily increasing their debts. The greater portion of them have been created within thft memory of the present generation} the great majority of them are rising still with a rapidity which is adding annually hundreds of millions to the national liabilities of the world.— latettora' Quardiom* •This is the lowest estimate** the ftench debt; Some authorities plan it at CSflOyßOa/N*.

Ascuht Hubio. —The Xgyptain flute was only a cow's horn with three or four holes in it, and their harp or lyre had only three strings. The Grecian lyre had only seven strings, and was very small, being held in one hand. The Jewish trumpets that made the walls of Jericho fall down were only rams' horns ; their flute was the same as the Egyptian; they had no other instrumental musio but by percussion, of which the greatest boast made was of the psaltery, a a small triangular harp or lyre with wire strings, and struck with an iron needle or stick; their sackbut was something like a bagpipe; the timbrel was a tambourine, and the dulcimer was a horizontal harp, with wire strings, and struck with a stick like the psaltery. They had no written music—had scarcely a vowel in their language—and yet, acoording to Josephus, had two hundred thousand musicians playing at the dedication of the Temple of Bolomon. Listen* ing to such a concert, Mozart would doubtless have died in the greatest of agoni**- Am Anoun.—Professor Shepherd, of Am* herst College, Massachusetts, has published some particulars respecting the meteoric stone which fell at Searsmont, Maine, TJ.&, on May 21\. About 8 a.m. there was heard in explosion like the report of a heavy gun, followed by a rushing sound resembling the escape of steam from a boiler. The stone fell in a field, and a lady who was in a house close by saw the earth I scattered in all directions at it entered the ground. The hole whioh it made was soon found, and on digging down the fragments were found still quite hot, the outside surfaces showing plainly the effects of melting heat. The largest pieoe weighed two pounds, and the fragments altogether twelve pounds. They emitted an odour like that of flint* when rubbed violently together. The hole made by the falling body was two feet in depth, the soil being a hard ooarse gravel; but the fracture of the stone was obviously occasioned by its striking against three large pebbles, each about four pounds in weight. Professor Shephard obtained and examined the largest fragment of the aerolite Fully one- half of its surface was ooated with the original crust, and the shape would seem to denote that the perfect mass had been of an oval sub-conical figure with a flattish base, so on the whole to have approached the shape of the famous Duralla stone, now in the British Museum. Among the constituent ele ments were found meteoric iron, peroxide of iron, chladnite, troilite, together with a single, blackish mass whioh Professor Shephard con sidered was in all probability a plumbaginous aggregate. Touudoh.—Professor Whitfield, of Ala bama, who has bestowed much attention upon the subject of tornadoes in the Southern States of America, has published some details eon oerning them whioh oonvey a vivid idea of their immense power. For example, daring a very destructive tornado in May, 1868, there was a large two-story framed house, the timbers of which were scattered for miles along the path of the storm. The bodies of the family, five in number, who were all killed, were found nearly a quarter of a mile away, almost all the clothing of the females having been stripped from their bodies. A pieoe of pine, sixteen inches square and fifty feet long, whioh, being unattached to any timbers of the house, was moved by the force acting on its own surface only, was carried across the intervening valley to an adjacent hill, into which it plunged end foremost, opening a a deep trench, broke, and was carried farther on. The Professor calculates that, to produce such results, a pressure of at least one pound to ewery square inch would be required, a force fearful to contemplate as possible for the wind. The house, to the destruction of which reference baa been made, presented a front area of a hundred and eighty thousand square inches, and therefore encountered a pressure of ninety tons. The velocity cf the wind necessary for such an effect must have been a hundred and sixty miles an hour. From the observations he has made, Professor Whitfield concludes that the gyration of the tornado is not horizontal but spirally upwards, for not only does it dis displace heavy bodies, but it carries them up to a considerable elevation. He has seen, for ex ample, a pine tree, sixteen inches in diameter and sixty feet long, float out from the black vortex of one at the height of a quarter of a mile, and sail round, to all appearance as light as a feather. The velocity of gyration, which is always from right to left, he estimates at a hundred and twent j miles an 'hour, to whioh must' be added forty miles more, being the ave rage rate of its progression, which is nearly from the south-west to the northeast. Boxuv Lokdoh.—Eighteen feet below the level of Cheapside lies hidden Boman London, and deeper even than that is buried the earlier London of those savage charioteers who, long ages ago, bravely confronted the legions of Bone. In nearly all parts of the City there have been discovered tesselated pavements, Boman tombs, lamps, vases, sandals, keys, orna ments, weapons, coins, and statues of the ancient Boman gods. So the present has grown up upon the ashes of the past. Trees that are to live long grow slowly. Slow and stately as an oak London grew and grew, till now nearly four million souls represent its leaves. Our London is very old. Centuries before Christ there probably came the first few half-naked fisher men and hunters, who reared, with fligt axes , and suoh rude tools, some miserable huts on the rising ground that, forming the north bank of the Thames, slopes to the river some sixty miles from where it joins the sea. According to some, | the river spread out like a vast lake between the Surrey and the Essex hills in those times when the half-savage first settlers found the low slopes j of the future London plaoss of health and defence amid a vast and dismal region of fen, swamp, and forest. The heroism and the cruelties, the hopes and fears of those poor barbarians, darkness never to be removed has hidden from us for ever. In liter days, monkish historians whom Milton afterward* followed, jgnored these poor early relations of ours, and invented, as a more fitting auoestor of English men, Brute, a fugitive! nephew of Momm of Troy. But, stroll on where we will, the per* tinaciou* savage, with his limbs stained blue and hi* flint axe stained red with blood, is a ghost not easily to be exorcised from the banks of the Thames, and in some Welsh veins his blood no doubt flows at this very day. The founder of London had no historian to record his hopea— a plaoe where big salmon were to be found, and plenty of wild boars were to be met with, was probably bis highest ambition. How ho bartered with Phoenicians or Gauls for amber or iron no Druid has recorded. How he slew the foraging Beige, or was slain by them and | dispossessed, no bard has sung. Whether ha was generous and heroic as the New Zealandar, or apelike and thievish as the Bushman, no ethnologist has yet proved. The very ashes of the founder of London have long since turned to earth, air, and water.—Jre* Cm—lf* Old mad Bmt.L—t—,
