In addition to the usual athletic events, bicycle races, &c;, there will be such novelties as a football match. between twenty sailors with a ball six feet in diameter, a set of Japanese Buffoons (novelties never yet seen here), and other events of equally- amusing charac ter. The night show will be as varied and interest ing as the day. Magnificent fireworks, artificial lakes, Mount Vesuvius in eruption, dance of the ghosts, will be a few of the promised entertainments. An enormous attendance will doubtless be, the ? result of the enterprize. ; ' The H.A.C.B. Society's annual sports and picnic will be held at Sir Joseph Banks grounds, Botany, on Boxing Day.
