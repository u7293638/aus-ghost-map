' M'Leod will enow you over the plaoe, (or, to tell you the truth, I know very little more of it than my own three roome and the etablee. Ton wiU find it an oddly planned home.' Itwaean oddly-planned house, yet one built, I oould quite betyeve, with the one view of suiting It to the requiromenta of the olimate. It waebnilt In the thane of the letter E, with the wing of the bouie that oomaponded with the bottom of the B lying right against the hill. In the oentre ot the iquire formed by the three angles of the building, a fountain, sup plied, ae M'Leod told me, by the drainage mm the hill, mattered iU radiating- epray refrtihingly in the eon, and the tfafoe portioo, that oompleted the letterreeem blano*, aa it were, waa covered with a ollmblng roee-trM, heavy with bloeeome. 1 need not, howaver, delay my atory by any umeeeaiary deraripUon of Bongarra. 1 lnipeoted it eloiely, approved of, and bought Ibe property. I saw the old woman enoum brtnes', and pitied her trembling hand ind white, worn lao», -iulte enough to pot auy idea of fair being in the way out ol my head, bnt that the wa't quite unaware that the property uad ehanged hands until I went to iv« on it I dlidovored within ah hour of my arrival. 1 had takrn up my own man, one I had brought fiom England with me, and aa soon at M'LaoS, who had been making aome arrangement! with me, had gone out, Union told me that the old woman wae very andone to apeak to me. ' BbVt in an awful to-do abont something, ?ir,' he added: ?- I think 1 never law a woman's- false to whit* in my lilt.' My. peimlaalon tuhirad her Into the room almost inttanlly, and at tbe ttood by the door, hetltatlngly holding it In her hand, I .naa an opportunity ol notloug her agitation ; at eitreme. She wat to thin and Iralllook 'ing, loo. and her deep black dreea to eoggei Hive oi tronble and death, that I felt for tbe ipoor.old etetlnre, and rote to pita* her a ehair. ' Sit down, Mta. Tone. If yon have any thing to say to me, yon ean tay it more at yonr eate tbui.' She tat down and lifted her dim eyti to my f aee at the nervouily fingered Ibe oornera of her bltok apron. It teamed to me u if ; the were anxiously toanning and trying to read my ohtraeter in my f aoe. ?? I didn't know that Colonel ArdweU had told Bnngarra nntll to-day, air,' the began, ' antl Fm anrioua about it.' ' Ob, yon may let you mind at reit,' I battened to aniwer. ' I am quite aware of the life elalm you have on the property, that mmbeauVigbt.' 11 Buttheoloeed room, ilrf Did tbe Oolonel toU yon abont thalf' Toe qoMlion wai to anxloualy pnl, and tnoh a atrange one, that I looked hard into Ibe woman't fee* at I retnmed.

' My good woman,' I tald, with a firm neaa ihat I have no donbt gave her ?ome inaight into my determination ol eharaeter, 'II there i» one thiog more utterly abominable and disgusting to me than another it it tuperititloni nonsenee of any sort I will take oare there are no ghosts about this house while I am its owner. Which of these keys is that, ot this haunted roomP' and I laid the bunoh of keys on the table before her. She pointed to one, rusted and dieooloured. 'That is it. but for God's eake, sir, be warned, for there is no luok in crossing the wishes of the dead.' ' When the wishes -of the dead interfere with the oomfort of the living, they shall not be considered at Bnngarra,' I replied, 'Mr. Montford'e wishes aa to yourself he has make lawful and binding on good parchment, bnt there is no mention of a reserved room.' 'He had not time, or he would have done iV she murmured. 'No timeP' 'No sir. I don't think that Colonel Ardwell'ever knew how Mr. Montford died, for he never tried to desecrate the room e cui uu [ran tue unug vv. nie expressed lying wishes, bnt as yon sir, are determined to' let light into a spot daylight should never penetrate, I tell you that Mr. Mont lord waa murdered in that chamber.' As she spoke, the old woman rose and jnrteled to me, and then went ont of the loot with a tottering step, yet without mother word. I was angry, and my ouriosity was excited. I put out my band, and touched the ball for my man, 'Linton,' I said, when: he appeared, 'there's a room in this house, that has been shut up for yeam.it seems— I want to visit it — do you know in what part of the building it is P' 't can (guess, sir, for I wae wondering at the state of a door at the end of the hiU wing, as MJvM'Leoi oatls itr It does not seem to have been opened or dusted lor ages, and the oobwebs are in every oorner of it.' ' Here's the key of it. I am going to visit that room.' A* we passed alone the hall that ran right through the building;, and round ito every wing, J looked, but saw nothing of Mrs. Tons. I thought, perhaps, she might wish to look pnoe more into the room that evidently held a deep interest for her— but it wae not bo. Somehow or other, as I fol lowed Linton along the dim passage that led lo the closed room, I felt lor the first time in my life some idea of the sensations enoountered by the superstitioua when they approach the dread aoene of a murder or ? trseedy.' ! The door was tbe very last in tbe corri dor, and as Lfnton, with some difficulty, turned the tatty key in the look nod opened the door, nothing was visible bnt a darkness wonderful to-exist in the broad lights day. The one window opened into the miadrteigletormed by the arure of tbe building, bnt it was so overgrown by fb6 interlaced ivy that the few rays it admitted were easily.oaught hj the dosed Venetian jjlijjd inside. Linton at onoe drew up the blind and opened theCwindow, while I eagerly waited to ase what appearance was presented by this chamber of death. . It was a tolerably large room, furnished with every convenience at the bedchamber of a gentleman aoenstomed to -be eur ronuded with the luxuries as weU as the Comforts of life. The large naif -teeter feed was hung and draped with a handaome «retohne,-thewmch%ilithefootofthe£bed, and tho.eu/ chair by the firi-pl*io», w«W i covered with the same. A large mirror occupied a prominent plaoe on the earvad t*iltt-iable, on which jet remained the oombe, brushes, and other toilet requisite*, probably as the last owner had Iett them, and directly opposite the bed and toilet were the double door* of a large closet, in which *tili hung many garmentv that gavei ont a damp, mildewed smell a* the doors were opened. The etrangosr thing of all was, however, the fact that from on* aide of th* floor, olote to the bedvthe rich oarpet was totsied. back, and the board*, whereon war*. great, dark itains, by quite expand. X use the word toned, adviiedly, for tha oarpet wu not folded bank, bnt. lay a* if, it had been thrown back by a itrong and hurried hand.. My mail raiaed hi* eyes trom oontemplating thste dack'ataini, .and* meeting mine taid, eerionsly i 'This mutt' be the . room where Mr. Montford waa murdered) ir,' : ' Ob, »-m'« heard that story, thenf' I : ?' Zm, air ( the waiter at thehotel where1 we baited told' me, and asemed to wonder that I did not already .know.' i 'Ahl andhedoubtleMhlniedaUttie ! about a ghost, ud all that aorc ot thing,. , 'WeU,' yet, *lrt he did *ay that this -room wa* said to be haunted('.' . ; ' Exaotly *oi Now, Linton,. you have, known me long enough to believe that I won't have any such non**nsioal tale* about a place that ha* beoome my property.

I was going away, leaving, the arrange1' ment entirely to Linton, when a ourloeity that I felt growing on me urged me to' atk a question « 'By-the-way, did yon hear any par. tionlan of this murder, Linton f 'I suspect the man told me all he knew himself, sir. It tteoa Mr. Montford/ was a very odd char&oter;, and was known, to keep all hi* money under hi* own hand. One morning when thi* old', woman, Mr*. Tone, came to bring fcia hot water as usual, abe found him lying there on the floor in his own blood, and so badly wounded- that, although he lived for two day*, he soaroely spoke, save to the lawyer that made hi*. wilL Mn.

II Her *onf where ia In nowf' ' I don't know, air; To* old woman mail have been very fond of her masler, for they say she has never held up her head lino*, and has aged a good twenty year* tins* h*. died.' ' I went away to the sitting-room, end »»t down to try. and pnnl* a meaning out ot the, strange story I had heard in oonneolton with the old woman'* name.

II w»a a lovely afternoon, the ran aa l\ drooped to the wait' f ailing folly on the play ing waten ol the fountain in the centre of what I may term tbe eonrt-yard, formed by, th* angles ol the building.' I went oat, and, standlnj in the porob, looked' toward the room wliere my valel wai buy, it was on my right, at the extreme end o! th* wing of In* hone*, ai I have already italed, and then for ibe firit time I observed, at a little dli tanoe from the room, and lying right agalml thi hill itiilf, a small tenement with a ohlmney and a paleli ol flowera in fronts It etruok me that It wa* the habitation of old Mn. Tone. Impultively, I stroll6d aorou the yard, and approaehed'th'e open door of the email oot tage. II I had any doubts at to it! being th* old woman'* plaee ol abode, the light of her sealed inttde, with her head bowed on the table, and her withered hands claaped above II, wat luffiolent to til them at reat. The poor oraature waa apparently In great agitation— great lobi shaking her Iran -ody from head to loot. ' I oould not help wondering if thla awful grlefhad anything' to do with the opening pi lie room ia whlob her- untortnntte muter had died; bntl douot think I sUiuld htvb ventured to' make mypreienee known'unier tbe-eircamatanoea.

' I do not blame you— yon know no better,1 and It i»- the wUl ol God,' she replied, shortly, ae (be wiped her dim eyes. ' You leal' loo lonely a life, my poor woman,' I continued, 'you have brooded over tbe ltd lowoladoubileis good mister until yonr brain has beoome weakened.
