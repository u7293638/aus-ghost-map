Smith yesterday asked how the position of the Land Tax Bill which the Government will not send up to the Council differs from the One Man One Vote Bill which Ministers are again proceeding with, and he obtained no answer There is the best of reasons for no answer being given, namely, that there is no creditable answer to give There is no difference in the two positions Why should the Council alter its decision that this bill must go to the country any more than it should alter its decision in the other case? No possible reasons can be suggested the Assembly in this, as Mr Turner pointed out in the other instance, must either be snubbed by the Council or dissolved by the Premier What leadership it is that brings a House to this pass ' One knows, of course, what the decision of the 'Trades hall Corner may be "Put up with the snubbing " Let us Docket our salaries so long as " the law allows It is noteworthy that there was no absolute majority of the House for the bill when the division was taken jos to-day And yet it is almost certain that the bill does alter the constitution itself, and therefore requires a statutory majors) When the franchise was gil on to mon, males were meant, and the word men was not intended to include women, as in certain cases it is held to do Mr M^ull s contention on this point is clear, and the general legal opinion is strong that it would be upheld by the law courts The explanation of the position of Ali Is v ves is that he overlooked the point in the first instance, and that then he takes umbrage at correction If the bill were not to be sent to the country on its merits the Council could scarely ignore the vital error And if the Government believed that the measure had any chance of escaping the Councils veto they would be no means have run the risk of seeing it set aside by the Crown-to whom there would be an appeal-or declared to be null and void by the law courts Nor would the Ministry, if they believed in the passing of the bill, have kept the measure in the Assembly until the last week but one of the session It is broad farce to expect a deliberative body, such as the Council, to set the old constitution aside and replace it with a new one at ten days' notice with the ten days full and overflowing with other business The Government do not anticipate the adoption of six h a measure under such circumstances of haste and hurry The bill is sent up to be rejected It has open ed its purpose of Some time ago all the labour organisations sent representatives to the Trades hall to frame a lighting programme This fighting prog mine included a state bank, one adult one vote, and the abolition of the electoral roll and bills to establish a state bank and to give the one adult one vote and to abolish the electoral roll duly followed The A and wharf agitators, the advanced democrats the budding socialists, and the 01 dinar) trades hall crowd, find fused, as it was said into a must) whole The report concluded that the new organization would have committees in every town, and that the arrangements for pledging candidates would be complete The majesty) of the occasion owed the Government it has proceeded at once to render homage to the rejuvenated power Li Hint Cirvxr, according to the cable messages, has made some demur to the practice of Too tow to the Chinese limited! No such idea of impropriety or les of respect suggests itself to Ministers when the "united " labour party speaks at once they grief Such is the genius of the Government and the genesis of the bill Yesterday's illusion was not a reflex of the strength of either party the full vote for the Government bill is supposed to be 02, or more than an absolute majority) In other words, three seats won by the Opposition would veto the Ministerial proposals as a whole Does anyone suppose that those three boats could not be obtained? Let anyone look at the list and he will have little doubt on the point Given a content, and the history of 1862 would assuredly repeat itself, and either the House would be balanced, on the majority would be against the dochra tion that tin hat and settled citizenship are entitled to no recognition whatever, and that the unit of representation must be the loafer, the larrikin, and the sundowner It is notorious that the last general election did not turn upon the issue whether thrift should be absolutely excluded in our representation, and therefore it is not too much to say that the Ministry) are seeking to effect their purpose or the purpose of their allies) a ( nip Lut ought the constitution to be altered by surprise?
