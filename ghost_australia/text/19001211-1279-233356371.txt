MINING. The reef in the face being driven on in tbe Fingall North is feet thick and prospects well. A mining man who lately visited Lee-Steers and Co.'s lease out beyond Carwill, says that- the reef being worked is traceable right through a 12-acre block and carries the same average stone from end to end, sup posed to be worth not less than 2oza. per ton. Besides the reef opened there are several others running parallel carrying long shoots of high grade ore. Lee-Steere and Co. have 70 acres leased along tbe line. Tbe Star of the West, Carwill, continues to yield splendid specimens. Bertram's lease on the end of it is also turning out good battery stone.. Most depressing news comes from Horseshoe. All bands except those necessary to hold the ground have been dismissed, and an application is being made for six months exemption. This gloomy outlook is having a mis. erable effect on tbe locality, and will also, to a great extent affect Peak Hill, for upwards of 100 men will be thrown out of employment. The lode matter in the Horseshoe Mine resembles that being worked along tbe Boogardie ridges, except that it appears poorer in free gold (what there is is fine), and more heavily charged witb mineral. Tbe cross courses carry the best of tbe auriferous ore and they are comparatively short. It is to be hoped that the company will bo able to give tbe ground Â» further trial before giving up the ghost entirely, for unless tbe mine manages to survive tbe crisis it is now going through, the reputations of more than one prominent expert will be damaged beyond all repair.
