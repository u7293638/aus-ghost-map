Cresswell ar- rived in the Queanbeyan district some years ago, then calling himself Smith. He engaged as groom or coachman to Mr William Davis, of Gininderra, and subsequently married a Mrs Clark, widow of an innkeeper. He ill used her, and was tried for assault and received a sentence of imprisonment. The last that was heard of him is that he was sent by the Braidwood bench to the Gladesville hospital as a dangerous lunatic. It is said that there was always something mysterious about Cresswell, and even his wife was not acquainted with his previous history - Goulburn Herald, Sept. 27.
