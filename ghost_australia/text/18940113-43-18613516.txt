"Jab[?] Basterbrook," "Zillah," &c.; [ALL ELENYS R[?]VED.] "There are two angels that attend unseen Each one of ui, and in the great book record Our good and • rfl deeds.

It is already Sealed up in Heaven, as a good deed accomplished. The rest is yours. —Lokqfili.ow. The time was the evening following the night of the dark deed on the cliff*. The place was the library of Penwithen. Throughout the morning Reuben had sat there brooding. Sometimes he felt safe from all danger, at other times he trembled at every sound. WLen lunch was OTer he could stay indoors no longer, so ho had ordered his horse to be saddled, and had ridden to Tintagel, ostensibly on basinets, bnt really to hear what people were talking about. To his surprise, nothing was said of Fraser. No one knew of his death. Mro had been working along the coast all the morning, bnt no dead body had been seen. Eridently the set had not given np iU drad. Well, so much the better for him. Perhaps the body might float for days, and teen be washed on tho beach at Padstow, or New Qnay, or Undo. It might be that no one would connect it with John Fraser. That worthy had told his tip- room com panions again and again that he should go to America, where there wrs room for a man of his talents j and so suspicions would be diverted into oUrr channels. Well, he should say nothing. A great longing came to him to go to the seen* of the straggle, bnt he said he would not be weak enough for tint. He had heard of nany murderers being discovered in that way, bnt he would not be so fooJiih. And so he rode back to Penwithen for dinner, and appeared gay and happy all the time, but directly the meal concluded he locked himself in the library again. A fire burned cheerfully in the grate, the limp on the table tent out a cheerful light, and Beuben enjoyed his comfortable surroendings. He had sot partaken o( much dinner, but, contrary to hii usual custom, he had drunk several glatsei of wine, and thai for the time, ™ Saihed with a falsa courage. In an hoar or two it* influence would leave him, bnt at present ite power wm grateful. He had sat aboot an bov when a knock cam* to the door, and, on hU opening it, a aerTant gave him a note. " Any answer, Satan t" he aaid absently. " No, air; the boy that brought it is gone. "Do yon know the boyf" "Tet.iir; it tu Jane H«ndy*i boy— she as wa* aerrant 'ere yean agone." "Ah, thank yon, Susan." He spoke more kindly than usnaL He wanted every one to think him cheerful and satisfied. He locked the door again, however, and, sitting down in hit arm chair, opened the envelope. After that he looked at the addreaa. It wat evidently written by a woman who had had little practice in the art of writing. Thnt it ran, " to mr. Eobsn penwithn np to Penwithn." "Who can this be fromf" ho mnsed, and then taking oat the letter, read at follows:— \- respected tor. i ope yu will tcote me tor ritiu. yew wai a good maatter to me op to your com, an i thot yn wud like to ao wot wat goin on, to i am ritin tbii. boot tea o'clock thit momin that black aired chap called ]ihmnl who do lire up to Coombahed, oomed in 'ere set he ard to work Uiscot Hendy. in tart i. tit a lot aroet bein matzid than bein in «arrioe like i woi np to penwithn, i wat Jane Bickett then, an ad a good time cot tnatttar pen withn woa aieh a good maaster, tayt i. he'J a Tillin aet ee, no th. thing teti.ee wai a good maaster to me cf ever then was one, look ere Ms «, eet no rite to be there, an somebody elt will be there r-.cn, git away tes i, for i never did like that ohap, ee alUyt made me feel oal creepy liv.j well a«s ee you naw ton heady that •e do ave oaryot ways, and eere got a secret, iVe found it out, ive got the thing here bin hidin for years, an you will toon aee a new mauter to penwithn, tit in my pocket set ee tlappin hit jacket, and ee USti pal eurynt like tet ee i tint a bin lookin oal thaite yean fur nothin, wot do ee main taw )■ you will tooo naw te* ee, then «e thawed bit teeth again an looked ■teaoge round the «y«e?ad went of. theni tet to myself mr pen^ithu shod naw this bat i beant well nufl to walk tox at present to i^ead my little boy without tellin any body year obedient sarvent jane Hendy. •' to mr &cbes; Penwithn fvfto penwithn. p • please tuT e« uM something coat your won b«ia in Boo?«n J»"-" .

Ue was a magistrate himself, and he know. A man of nit standing in the county would be believed a thoueand times before this man. Yeo, he would fight to the end. He read tho letter again, and lib mind tamed Into a different channel. Might not this be a hoax:' No doubt Jane Heudy had written the letter, no doubt, too, Ish mael had spoken to her; but had ho not done this to frighten him t Should ho go to Jane Hvndy and speak to her 7 No i that would give credence to I»hmacl's statomrnr, for, of course, there must be no will. No, no, Ishmael could never hate found it. Why the place waa.unknown, and even if it was known, a hundred men mipht search and never flad it. A dark hole diScult to see, and then—no, no, it oould not be! • Again he pcr-a'dtho lrttor, and tho more he felt confirmed in hU oj iaion. ll* looked at his watch. It was nine o'clock. He want to tho window and looked out. It wa» a wild night Tho «ky was leaden, and the winds howled fiercely. Tho pale crescent of the moon oould not be Men.

Every me was aileep but himwlf, and he felt w though he tbooU never sleep again. Like Uacbeth, he had mnidarad it. He turned the lamp low, and crept through. the passage into tht kitchen, and then went out into the yard by the kitchen Joor.

The ipot wu open, neither hedges nor haute* were near, and so it would be impossihlt for any on* to hide. It war terribly lonely. The nearest ootUge was far away, and the howling wind, mingling witb the roar ot the sea, made him shudder. Flakes of foam were constantly blown against his face, so he knew that tht Atlantic was in a furious mood. He walked on until he cams to the precipitous footpath leading to the beach. For one who did not ktow every yard ot the ciiSt dctcent would Ik perilous, but Reobin did not beiiute, and in a few minutes stood oa tbe bard tea land.

"It wcnldn't be convenient for mo to come in the morning." said Ishmael mock ingly ; " you see, I'm so much interested in thoee Lelant mines. Krer sinoe you were so anxious, through Squire Uetallick, to put fire hundred pounds w them for me, tho<M) mines hare had a wonderful fascin ation," and he Uughed a low, bitter laugh. Keuben writhed aa he heard this taunt. The young man had teen through his every movement. " Besides," Ishmael went on," I've a very strong desire to see what you took from the cave. It must have a curious history, and M 7011 stjr it doe* not affect me, there can be no pouible objection." HeuSen hesitated a minute, then he Slid huskily— " Very well, yoa shall see it." Ishmael loosened his grip somewhat then, and Keuben who had anticipated this, made a sudden struggle, and slipped from his grasp, lie made a wild leap forward, and tied for life. A minuto later he wag hurled to the ground with terrible force. "Very well,'said Isbmael; "tinoo ono way will not succeed another niuit be tried." With co gentle hand he tore the coat open, and took the packet away from the prostrate man at his feet, lie put it is ait own packet, and buttoned bis coat carefully over it, while Ueuben, who had been stunned by the fall, rose slowly to his feet. tty this time Ishmael was. becoming ex cited. His eye* gleamed red, and his handi quivered with passion. Ever/nerve v« highly stiung. At U>t he was vic tories*. Lang rear* he had been waiting for this lime, waiting, watching, and scheming. Now that he had found tne will the lands were hU, and to him that meant borne, happiness, heaven 1 Ho fcit that he possessed a great treasure, and the man or men who touk it from him would have a ccrrible work before them. Ha no longer felt that he could mock Keuben; be wanted to pour out his hatred in burning, bitter word*. Still he retained command over himself, and stilt watched the man ho had so far conquered. Bat the battle was not ended yet. "Give that back," cried Benben.' "It U not yours; it is mine." " Prove it yours at a court of law, then." " Yes, 1 will 1 and if there v a law in the land yon shall suffer for this, you thieving, murdering——" " Words are cheap, nsmes are cheap," said lahmael. " I feel Uke calling jou names. Vuu who hare rained my mother's life and blighted mine You who for flve and-twenty yoars have grown fat on what haa never belonged to you, you who bave trial to ruin my prospect*, my life, you who have embittered my heart, and nud« the earth black. But never mind, the day of reckoning bat come, and now we shall tea who will win. Fcrhap* when you lio in a felon's cell, and jour children are cuned by your evil deeds, you will know that you made a bad bargain when you sold your soul to the devil in order to rob a defenceless giil of her right*, llut you'll tuSer.

If I've sown lies, you've sown hate, and G<jd will make you reap hell, a* he has made me reap it." Kcubtn IVnwithen seemed to forget himself as be taid this. For a minuto nu eye* were opened to truth, and he saw things in a new light. Even Isbmaal* heart quailed as he heard the words, which ne somehow felt were true. Hat only for • moment. " 1 know nothing of your theology," he said 1 "it U not in my line. I'll get my right*, and risk all th« rest.

You should hay* watched old Margery Goudge more closely. You ihoald have listened to her conventions with old Sally Origg •ben she was dying. Death frightens people, it make* them tell."

All bit care to make hia petition was in Tain nnw, all hit ariilocratic acquainlancea wouli eloae their door* agaimt him. And he desirrcd It. Well, well, It wouli not be for long. After all, hia only grief now wat for bia children. It ni hard that they should tuffer for him, bnt ao It waa. Oh, it had bten a weaiy, weary struggle, aud 11 bad ended in dilo.t, t«nibt« difut, and ditgract. And suppose it had ended in rictory,what then? Ah, the game was cot worth the candle. He had been far happier, far better aa Keuben I'enwllheo, of Carloggas, than v Keaben I'enwithen, Kiq, owner of Penwitnen.

AU wouU be known soon, bnt he would not know what the world Slid. Ho wat dtltrmlnti on that. Ho entered Penwithen House in the aame stolid way, and, oa it by instinct, turned towards the library, where he had brooded so many hours, lie aac down in the old arm chair, and remained motionless tor houra j then be roso up and, opening bi. <u.t., b,g»n ♦- -write^ ji*.jrapitJj scribbled » dozen page*, then rtia them,," •a if he wanted to aeo whether he had ex pressed hia thoughts correctly. When hfi had done this, he threw all he had written into the fire, and began again. * This time he did not write so much, just a couple of pages of note-paper. " That will do," he said when he had finished. " I cannot confess my guilt to them, I can only warn them. They will know soon enough; he will glust crrtr their tnHering, he will Ungh at their cUi grace." Calmly ho folded the paper, and placed it- in an envelops, which he carefully sealed. Then he wrote in a dear, steady hattd i— " For my boy Bertie, And my mud Grace. "To be read when I am g-one. " Hay the Lord hare- mercy upon them and upon me. "' Whatsoerer a man oowetb, that ehall he also reap.'" , , , He placed the note inside the <Je;k but he did not lock it. "They will bo mre to torn to it," he ■aid. " And they will hare no difficulty in gaeuing tbe rest." He tank back in his chair again, and began to brood. Eridently he waa thinking deeply, and weighing some dread alternv tire, for spas an of pain often rerealed themaelres in hia face, hia handa twitched nerroualy. " Yea, it ia beat," he mnaed, presently, "it moat be belt. When I am deud, people will pity the children. 'Poor young things'.' they will say,' they cannot help it.' If I lire they will hure more to bear. No, 1 will curs* them as little aa I can. Besides, people often pity a criminal after he's hanged. He went to a cupboard and unlocked it, then he took from there an old pbtoL It was an antiquated weapen, but deadly not »ith*Undln^, and he looked at it calmly, curiously. After this he took a powder flask and a shot-bag from the cupboard, lie carefully measured out the powder and emptied it into the barrel of tho pistol, cauii'juEly knocking tho stock so that the powder might come back to tho nipple. With a at*>vsr hand he rammed in the powder, and afterwards poured tbe shot into his h&ad.; They were large-fired buckshot, and four of these he placed in tho pistol, and pressed them down aa coolly as it loading hia gun fur a day's ahooting. Then he placed a cap on the nipple, preuing. it carefully down with the cock of the pistol. •' There," he said, " I think that's all ready i and aa far as I know there's nothing to wait for." A far-away look came into hia eyee, and his lips trembled. " And thia v the end," ho muttered, " the end of all my scheming, all my hopes, all my fears. Weil, tatter this than to bt> hauled before tho magistrates, and after that the judge, and hare it prored against me that 1 hare been a thief, a defrauder, a murderer. Yea, a good deal better. Well, let this be the end." He lifted the pistol in hia hand. " What will it be afterwards f" ho mut tered, "what, I wonderf Well, 1 shall soon know. So hell can be worse than tbe hell l're been in. Besides, it is my duty to the children i the net it drawn around ate, oa erery side, erery side. Well " lie started guiltily, (or he heard a step outside the door. He had forgotten that the night had passed and that the morning had come, and to did not know that the serranta had entered the kitchen; but the noise aroused him. "Well, it's time enough, it'a time enough," he thought, ac he put the piitol into bis pocket; " time enough, but I'll keep it handy through the day. No doubt, he's at work, and soon they'll be here. Well, they'll not find much when they come | I'll take care of that." Quickly he locked the cupboard, and made the room tidyi then noltletsly he went to hia bedroom, and waabed himself aad brushed hia clothea. Thia done, he seesaed to be fighting a great battle with himself) but the matter in hia aaiud was soon settled. " Ym, I'll c0 down aad matt ttam. I wast khaa to taiak m ki»4lr ol m« a* thij cm."

Through the breakfast hour, too, he chatted pleasantly, although he coMUutly looked oat: of the window and towarda the door, M though expecting vinitora.
