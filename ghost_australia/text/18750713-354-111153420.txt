His enemies always admit that he ^possesses an honest heart, and is always in Pflueiiced by the best of intentions. His ad jT^ice and friendship are worth having ; and lift Pievcr refused it to those deserving of it. (Ap plause). Although at times they had differed, c he Kid always looked upon Mr. Hannell as a f-'-inan he could go to for advice. He could depend upon him for his sound judgement. h Jit tiamiL'11 is a man this district knows how | io appreciate. These arn my sentiments, and | (hesentiments of a large majority of the inhabi t (ants of the Northumberland District. As a E *wi, as a citizen, and as a justice of the i^jeace, his equal is not to be found in Lthis district. (Cheers). Our guest may feiave faults— anil who has not — but as B^ln administrator of justice who can point out |-\Ks equal 1 (Cheers.) Is this fact not ad Ryjitted by the whole of the district? Mr. K Bannell is not a friend of the broadcloth, but B £ friend of th« poorer classess (cheers) ; he m!win nlivavs re.idv to see the ivorkinff- man net fitice; his conduct has ever been impartial tffci'n the rich and poor. He is honest and KL intelligent, and deserves the thanks of evcry ? aiewho is desirous that fair play and justice Eilfould be administered fairly and uprightly, ?^respective of friend or foe.

I hope that the two -pic- tures will hang side by side for many genera tions. The Chairman proposed the health of the 'Visitors.' — Mr. Clarence Hannell re sponded. The Chairman proposed the 'Press.' — The toast was respsnded to bj the represen tatives of the Press. The ' Ladies ' was next proposed by the Chairman. — Mr. James Hannell, jun., re sponded. Mr. James Hannell, sen., proposed the health of the ' Chairman,' — The Chairman returned thanks. He deprecated the position of the Northumberland electorate at the pre sent juncture, represented us it was by its present member. Some portion of the evening was devoted to songs with which some gentlemen favored the meeting, and at eleven o'clock the company dispersed. Daring Robbery. — Ou Sunday night, the premises of Messrs. Grierson, Brothers, were burglariously entere.1, and some drapery 'roods stolen — the quantity cannot now be stated as the stock is large and varied. A square piece of wood was cut out of the panel of the door, through which, doubtless, it was intended to introduce the hand, to turn the key, thought to be in the lock ; iinding this was not the case, the thief or thieves must' then have wrenched the lock. Having entered the shop, a candle must have been lit, and the burglars proceeded in their nefarious work, and, having abstracted some of the goods, they leisurely left the .store. Tho proprietors of the store reside next door. We believe the matter is in the hands of the police. The Book of Mormon. — Mr. Rogers preaches regularly every Sabbath, at the old School of Arts, upon the ' Fullness of the Times,' and the ' Approach of the second ad Vent of the Lord.' He is very impressive in his style of delivery, and vividly pourtrays the prophetic statements, denouncing the coldness and apathy of the Christian Church through out the world, at the present day. Arguing from appearances, he draws his deductions from Scripture that the end of the present dispensation is close at hand. In his views there is nothing of a speculative character, the foundation of his belief being based upon the orthodox teaching contained in Scripture. Polygamy is not a doctrine of his section of the Church, but is severely denounced as im politic and unscriptural. Concuegational CuuitCH. — A meeting was held on Friday evening lusr, iu the Welsh Chapel, for further consiileriuir the necessity of n-taining the Rev. Mr. Williams', us a minister of th» Congregational Church, in the mining townships. The rev. gentleman oc ciipiiui the chair. The chairman exnlmned the obji'ct of the meeting, und Mr. Humphries in formed those pri'.opnt of what took plnce at the merting in Ltuubton, on Tuesday last. — Mr. E. H. Simmons was appointed secretary, pro. lew., for WalUenJ, and Mr. HumphrtBa, trea surer. Mr. Humphries moved, 'That the resolutions passer) at the Lamhtnn meeting be adopted.'

Mr. Humphries Htuted that Mr. Rorh Imd informed him that tilt; rent of the School of Arts would he 7*. 6d. per week. Mr. Simmons moved, that the offer of Mr. Ross for the use of the School otl Arts be accepted, and that the secretary write to Mr. Rosf, acquainting him with the decision of this meeting, and that the rental of the | building comuiruce ou Sunday, the 13th iimt.

A Ghost. — Wallaend furnishes a ghost stoiyj a veritable i;host, in propria persowe, is to be seen on the swamp nightly, druwed in black. Some individual is amusing himself frightening votufin that pass that wh- at night. The only wonder in, that the miners don't ' lay on' to his ghostship, or that the police don't arrest him for his nefarious conduct. A Curiosity. — A colporteur has been in Wallsend during the week, preaching and ef fecting a (tale of books. He presented your dorr«Rpondenfc with a pamphlet containing u portion of Rcriphire printed in ouo hundred and thirty-four different languages.
