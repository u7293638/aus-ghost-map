THE PEDIGREE OF MAN. No. II. We have now arrived at a very important stage in the human pedigree, that of the fishes. As man has been shown to be de- scended from a worm, so it is equally certain that he is descended from a fish. Among the five great divisions of the vertebrate sub- kingdom—fishes, amphibia, reptiles, birds, and mammals—fishes are the lowest in point of structure, and are undoubtedly the ancestral stock from which all the others are descended. They represent, however, a markted advance on the round-mouths. Not only have they the movable jaw and the double nostril, which is wanting in the cyclostoma, but they have the swimming bladder, from which the lungs are subse- mien ti v dev eloped m the higher animals, and also two pairs of limbs, winch have thus bu n inherited by man, m common with all other vertebrates, directly from his fish uncestr) In the development of the fishes there are several clearly marked stages, the primicval fishes, represented by the sharks and mis, the ganoid or enamelled fishes represented bj the sturgeons and the osseous or bon) lishes, including all the rest of the lish class We next come upon another of those re toorkuble connecting links which are of more interest to the biologist and of more significance as evidence in favour of the de velopmcnt theory than the most highly organised and prominent members of tho various subdivisions of the animal kingdom 'Hie insignificant looking lancelot, as wo have been, is hu more important and deserving of studs irom a genealogical point ot view than the comparatively highly developed lobster ot cuttlefish, and similarly the humble mud tish is a more notable creature than the Murray cod or the huge crocodile, and the little platypus an 1 echidna than the ¡ordI) lioniuid the mujcstie elephant Ila mud fish, us it is called, which is rcpro sentcd at the present time by only three genera, two of winch are found in tropical Africa nnd faouth America respectively, w hilt the third, the Ccrutodus Tonten, inhabits the swamps ot Northern Australia, is to out w ard appearance a decidedly queer looking fish During the wintei time it lives in the water, and breathes through its gills like other fishes IA hen the water dries up, however, it burrows in the mud, anil breathes air through lungs Hence the class to which it belongs is called tiipncuiila 01 double breathers 'Hie mud fish is thus obviously a transitional torm between fishes and umphibia (frogs, toads, newts siilunmndeis ) It is dcseiving of notice that the Australian Ceratodus l8 the most primitive in structure, having only one lung, while the African und Americun mud fishes have the double lung formation possessed bj ull the higher animals It mai ulso be mentioned that the mud fish has the cartilaginous skeleton of the primicval fishes (sharks), which seems to indicate that it developed fiom this class and not from the more Inejily organised osseous fishes Hie laet that the three extant genera ure found in such fur rernov ed localities is ev idenec that this class of animals must at one time have been widelj dmpersed throughout the wolle1 Hie mud fisn muiks a most important transition in the evolution of life-thut, niunelj, fioiu the water breathing to the air breathing animals Hie change becomes tar moie miiiuleit in the amphibia, which, no doubt, developed out of the dxpntuala 1 lie lowest division of these, the gdlcd bairiieliiims, lepiesentcd by the proteus and the i\olotl, retain their gills throughout life, although the) have lungs us well, while the mote advanced amphibia, as is well known, breathe with gills only in the larval or tad- pole singo1, w Iule m maturity they lose the fills and breathe only through lun^s Both these divisions must be regatded as repre suiting successive stages m mans pedigree liesides the immense advance m the respira torj organs shown by the nmplnbiuns, they also developed another striking feature, winch has persisted m nil their descendants dow n to mun 1 Ins is the transtormation of the puddling lins ol the fish into the five toed feet und legs of the higher animals All icpnles, birds, and mammals possess four limbs, euch ending in five toes (or fingers, us we call them in man), although in many eu=e« us in sniikes, the wings of birds, the fins of whales, and the hoofs of horses, they have become greutlj modified, or almost lost by subsequent adaptation to varying -onditions of life '1 lie development of air breathing lungs and five toed legs markpd ano ot the most noteworthy changes ever mude by our ancestors in their mode of life 1 rom being puiely uquatio animals they be came the inhabitants of dry land, and ever since then it is the land animals that have contmuul to advance in organisation and intelligence, while the deiu/ens pi the water have stopped short at u comparatively low stage of both liesides wonna and fishes, man is thus also descended from amphibians and from the Bulamtindrme oi tailed form as is shown by the fact that all reptiles and birds and all mammals until u very late stage possess tails from the umplnbians must huve sprung a \erj primitive reptilian form winch developed in two different directions One branch gave rise to reptiles proper, li/ards, snakes, crocodiles, toitoises, and subsequently to birds while from the other vvns evolved the most ímnor tant of all the divisions of the animal kingdom the great mammalian class We are thus entitled to say that man is de ecended from a reptile, although the term when applied to him has now come to he used as one of supreme contempt, surely an unjustiliublc slur upon our lizard like ancestors In all reptiles, birds, and mammals there is a great structural advance ti pon the amphibia in connection with the development of the embryo, in consequence of which they are classed as animóla, or ammotic animals, while the lowerlvertebratcs are called anamnui, as being wanting in this purticulur structure Kverjone has heard of ' crocodiles tears " and it is an interesting fact that the lachrimatory organs/first make their appearance in reptiles The primitive reptiles, tocowuna, lead by a denes of transitional forms, the remains of r Inch were discovered by the American palaîontologist Cope, to the mammal reptiles ( Ihenosauria), and tliencp totheearlicBt main mais, now represented bj two extraordinary creatures found only in Austialui, that land of primitive and transitional forms, the duck billed plat>pus and

mum anatomical structuie icsembled the pint) pus and echidna Trom these \er) primitive mammuls must have sprung a much hi-her class of anlrauls, the marsupials or pouched animal« repre icnted by the kanguroo, opossum, wombat, 4o. Like tlie monotreinata, tlie marsu- pials arc, with the exception of the Americnn opossums, now confined to Aus tralia, Tnstnnnm, mid tho adjoining Asintió islands They show a grout advance upon their oinitliodelphiü ancestors, inasmuoh us they bring foi th their young alive instead of from eggs. These arc, however, horn in a very immature state, the j oung of the great kangaroo being only an inch long when bom, and being nourished for nine months in the maternal pouch. Although the marsupials arc more nearly allied in structure to tho highest class of mammals, the placenta] animals, than to the monotreinata, they are clear]} a connecting link between the two, and man must reckon marsupials among his ancestors Wo hn\e now reached the last stages m tins strange eientful history. From the marsupials there ultimately dei eloped the ancestors of the highest division of the in mi- maban class, the plucental animals, so called because the young, instead of being bom nu maturel), and nourished in an external pouch, is not bom until it has arrived at maturttv, being in the meantime nourished by menus of the placenta, a membrane con- necting the embryo with the body of the mother. The development of tho placenta is, bo far, the last of the great funda- mental changes that lune taken place in the structuie of animals during tho long course of their evolution In con nection with the development of the plucental mammals out of the marsupials a difheult question arises Did the pliu.eiitu.ls develop once oui) out of the minsupiuls, or did the diflucut divisions of the hi/hei class develop separately out of Ibu dillcrcnt divisions of the lower' Foi instance, did the carnívora (lions, wolves, bears, \\.c ) spring from the carnivorous marsupials, unit the herbívora horses, cattle, sheep, deer, &.c,)from tho herbivorous marsupials' The question is still regarded as doubtful, and Haeckel considers the latter hypothesis us at present the more probable. Further, palæontological discoveries may throw light upon this interesting and much vexed problem. 'The difficulty does not, however, greatly affect the question of man's gene alogy, us all the chief groups of the placental mammals are clearly not in the direct line of his ancestry. We can say with ceitamty that man does not reclton among his remote progenitors the beasts of prey, the hoofed animals, the seals, whales, bats, rodents, or edentattt. The only group with which we need concern ourselves is that of the pri- mates or quadrumuna, which includes the apes and monkeys In his anato- mical structure man is far more closely allied to these than to any other of the mammalian groups The most primitive members of the pi limites arc the semi apes or lemurs, a very mteiesting class of animals, whose chu f habitat is Madagascar, though they me ulso found in pails of Atliui and Asta and some of the Asiatic islands. It seems probable that the lemurs developed out of the marsupials, perhaps Irom an opossum like lorm, most likely at the be- ginning ol the tertiary period, and Unit they were the ancestors of all othei apes and monkeys, and therefore of man It must be admitted, however, that the exact line of descent of the lemurs from tho mai supials has not yet been clearly mude out. 'the true apes, which thus descended from the lemurs, arc divided into two muni groups, the plutyrhme, or tlat nosed, and the catar lune, or narrow nosed, ants The lirst named include only the American monkeys, and need not be considered here, us it is not irom them but Irom the others who inhabit | the old woild that man is descended. As Haeckel expresses it, "The human race' is a Billilli branch of the group 01 ' eutarinna.', and has developed out of long since extinct apes of this group m tlie old world," This fuctmuy be considered to lui ve bein cstiibhshed once tor till by Professor, Huxley in his memorable vvoik, Man's i Plow in ISiitui f. Of the naiiow nosed ' monkeys those most closely allied to man ure the anthropoid apes, now represented ' only by the gorilla, the clnmpan/ee, the i orang nuning, and the gibbons, of which theie are several species Kachoneof these is in some- respects more like mau than the j others, und we cannot soy that any one of | them is nearer to man's ape progenitors than , the rest. In one point, and a very important one, they all ugroo, und Unit is m being1 without tails. The anthropoid apes are the curliest of man's progenitors to discard this remarkable appendage, which was minuted by the tailed monkeys from their fish, or we might even say their worm, ancestors. Not only in the ub.cnce ol tulls, but m the par-1 tail loss of hair, the more elect gmt, mid the ' great develoument of the bruin do the i anthropoid apes come nearer to man than any other animals We must, howevei, be cnre-| ful to avoid the error so often attributed to evolutionists by their o)poucnts ot looking upon any existing membti of tins group, the gorilla foi instance, as repicsentiug the i anthropoid upe troni winch mun is un-1 doubted!} descended. The anthropoid unes probably oiiginutcd in the miocene divi- sion ot the tertiary period, and ufter n long; course of gradual improvement, lasting for unknou n ages, grew by the com- plete loss of the liuir) covering, the per- manent adoption of the uptight gait, ». still lurther development of the bunn, and above all by the acquisition of speech into men, though of course of an extremely pumiuve and savage type. Suoh ia a brief outline of man's pedigree »s tar as it can at present bo made out in ac- cordance with the development theory. The ancestral history of the human race has been traced from a minute single celled organism, the moneron, through the various stages of worm, fish, amphibian, reptile, monotieme, marsupial, lemur, ape. It is, indeed, a marvellous hiatoi), and to many persons it will, doubtless, seem more like n dream, or the fiction of a disordered imagination, thnn a sober statement of, fact. Yet if there be any menning m I the resemblances between man's structui e I and that of other animals, in his embiyomc development, in the succession of higher and higher forms of lift» upon the globe leading up to him, if thcoigaiuu world is not to be an insoluble enigma we must conclude that man has a genealog}, it mav be somewhat differ ing from in detail, but m all essential points the same us that îrdicatcd m the foregoing sketch. [We have received a letter from Mr. S. Hector Ferguson, m winch tue writer takes exception to some of the statements made in the hrst paper on the "Pedigree of Man," vvhioli appeared in The Annus ot January ti. Our contributor, "A.M.T.," replies as fol- lows.-"Mr. Ferguson sa)s, 'In regard to Lord Kelvin's suggestion (that organic matter was introduced into the world by a meteorite), I have to remark that lie never made the suggestion m the sense in which " A M.T." and many other writers give lum credit for. I believe I was present when he fust made the state ment I studied natural philosophy in Lord Kelvin's class, und on one occasion, when he was speaking on the manner m which our globe wits clothed with vegetation, lie said, A seed may have been conveyed to our euith by a meteorite."' Mr Ferguson is evi- dently not aware that Lord Kelvin (then Sir William Thomson) put forward Ins sug- gestion as to the introduction of organic matter by a meteor in his presidential address to the Buttah Association at Kdmburgh m 1871. With reference to the liathybius, Mr Ferguson writes at follows : - " Does 'A. M T ' not know that the Ilatliyhius is only a scientific ghost f Ur. Wullieh, m 18b!), in the Monthly Mia OHCopualJournal, proves that the-deep setioo/e called Iluthybius bus nothing m ittoconlnm Huxley's views, and the ship Challenger has accumulated much evidence of the sume Hort, professor Lionel Hi ale sti) s that 'Bath) bins is only a com- plex muss ot slime, with many foreign bodies m it, und the ddbim ot living oic.au isms winch have passed avvny.'

In the third edition of his work, 7he ICio/hIioh of Man, dated October, 187h (Lnghsh trans- lation 188.Î), Haeckel writes as lollows - 'The moat remarkable of all Monera is the liathybius which was discovered by Huxley in 18b8 'Jins wonderful Monolon lues in the dcept st patts oi the sen, especiully in the Atlanta Ocean, and in places covers the whole tloor ot the sea in such masses that the line mud on the lattei consista in gnat ineusuii'ot living ahme 'Hie pro toplusm in these formless nits does not slim dillcreiitiated at all, euch little puce l8 capable ot foiniiiuaii individual Tlieuctive uimLUuid mon incuts ot these foimltss pieces ol plimsoll, which wiie lirst observed bj the J ngbsli /oolo^istH, Gurpeiitit and W)ville 1 houison, have ucently bein ngum obsi ned by the German Arctic voy agu, Lind 1'issils, in the Until) bins of the coast of Oieinlan 1.
