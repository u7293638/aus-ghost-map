TO-DAY'S RACES. i At Morphettville to-day will begin the first Adelaide Cup Meeting faeld on that course sinoe Maloa won the £2,500 stake, promoted by Mr. S. Barnard, in 1884. Since that time only one Cup has been run, and that was in 1885, when Mr. E. W. Ellis won at Flemington with that good horse Lord Wilton. Aa every onejknowa the;, S.A.J.C. collapsed directly the totalizator was abolished, and it was reformed a few weeks after Parliament relegalized the machine. This is not the first meeting the new club has held, as they raced with fair BUCCSEB on New Year's Day, despite the heavy rain. The programme this afternoon la not particularly inviting all round, but there are still fifteen left in the Goodwood Handicap, and this race at all events will be very interesting. It was instituted in 1881, and was inaugurated in a most sensational maimer, D.O.D. winning and paying £836 in tbe totalizator, the biggest dividend which has ever been paid. Most people will remember that the winner had only one backer, and that owing to a flaw in the machine it appeared as though there waa not a single investment on the old son of Panic and Flying Doe. Without doubt D.O.D.'a victory was one of those gigantic flukes that now and again crop np to upset all the calculations of those who study raoing form. There were sixteen runners, the places being filled by Miss Harriett, 6 at. 12 lb., and Aiblins, 6 at 5 lb,, while the unplaced lot inolnded Camballo, Rivalry, Pawnbroker, Lothair, Totalizator, and Trevallyn. 'That such pood horses should go down before D.O.D. is simply inexplicable. Harry Tothill trained the winner, who waa ridden by D. Bowes. The next year of the Goodwood Handicap saw t&e; favourite, Result, with Hales up, squeeze home by a head from Speotre, with Baron von Mnelier, who was badly disappointed, third. There were fourteen runners this time, and the race will be remembered on account of Mr. W. Pile being persuaded to protest against Result for not carrying a penalty on aooonnt of her A.J.C. Free Handicap victory. All racing authorities were of opinion that the penalty had not been incurred, and eventually the late Mr. A. K. Finlay received the stake. When Colstoun, 8 st, beat Royal Irishman, 7 at. 8 lb., in 1883, there were such good ones as Larpent, Tyropean, and Bassanio among the unplaced lot, and the field was at the post twenty-five minutes before Mr. MacDonald could get them away. Tyropean started favourite at 3 to 1, tthe winner being at 4's, while BasEanio, who iell, waB a 5 to 1 chance. Hitherto the race had been run on the last day of the meeting, but in 1884 it preceded the Adelaide Cup. This was Malua's year, and the betting over the Goodwood in the new TattersallB' Rooms the night before the race waB very heavy. Ironmaster, 7 st-, was in abont equal favour, with Lord Wilton, 7 Bt., and the former won, Tothill's colt being knocked over at the start. Bassanio, 7 st. 10 lb., a 50 to 1 chance, waa second, and Country Boy, 6 Bt. 5 lb, third, while heavily backed ones like Royal Irishman, Countryman, Creswick, and Madge were out in the cold. There was only one Goodwood after this, and that was run in Melbourne. Topaz was a screaming favourite, but strange to say this usually quiet old horse swung round the wrong way when the flag weut down and lost all chance. Lantern, ridden by the late Donald Nicholson, slipped his field from the start, and won easily from Lord Wilton and The Ghost, while seventeen were unplaoed. This year the field will not be up to the average in quality, but Chetwynd, Goldstream, and Tareena are all fair form, and possibly some outsider may spring up to recall recollections of the D.O.D. feat. Mr. Whitisgton has done everything poBBible to ensure the comfort of visitors, and if the weather keeps fine and the trains run satisfactorily there ia every prospect of an enjoy- able day's sport. Betting on Friday evening was conspicuous by its absence; 50 to 40 was taken Tareena for the Goodwood Handicap, and 3 to 1 was the best price The Lawyer for the Cup. Is this shortening of the odds a precursor of more scratching^? Seme people may be surprised to bear that Banker waa scratched for the Hurdle Race at 8.18 last evsning. We mnst confess that it takea a iood deal to surprise us now-a-days, but the strike of the bookmakera is calculated to make one lift hiB eyebrowa in stonishment. The Knights of the Pencil bject to the oharges levied by the S. A.J.C., nd they have deoided to deBert the enoloBure, nd carry on operations in the Derby Stand. hey willbemissedfrom the neighbourhoodof the totalizator, but those who have been backing doubles, beginning with Banker for the Hurdle Race, must feel that it would be no loss if the strike lasts for ever. Mr. Whitington informs us that a red flag hoisted on the Steward's Stand will signify to those betting in the Derby Stand that the first three horses have weighed in correctly.
