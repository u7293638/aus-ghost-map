HONORING THEIR ANCESTORS. Mr K. S. Gundry, in an article on Ancestor "Worship in China in the "Fort nightly Review," thinks that the mission aries are mistaken in attempting to put down the practice as idolatry. A China man -will give up Buddhism for Christianity easily enough, but to ask him to abandon the worship of his ancestors is to scandalise and wound his greatest religious instinct. Every house has somewhere its shrine, where the tablets inscribed with the names and descriptions of his ancestors are kept with as much reverence and care as the Kornans of old used to preserve the images of their forefathers. On certain occasions ho sacrifices to them and offers up prayers. The definition of Confucius is " serving the dead as they would have been served if alive," and the dishes con taining food which are spread before the tablets really form a banquet. A China man's desire to leave a son is caused by the hope that he will offer these banquets to his Manes, and it is worthy of remark that the belief that neglected souls turn into hungry ghosts seems to be as old as man. Even in Christian countries the same feeling exists, and as Mr Marion Crawford puts it — " From Eome to Palermo swear at a man if you please, call him by bad names and he will laugh at you ; but curse his dead relations • or their souls, and you had better keep beyond the reach of his knife, or of his hands if he have no weapons." Mr Gundry makes it pretty clear that the missionaries, if they want to make any true progress in China, had better refrain from any interference with the native mode of honoring their ancestors, and leave Christianity to bring about a revulsion of feeling of itself in time.
