CARE AND WORRY. You have heard of care and worry—dark visitors, they say, Who stalk about, familiar as Hamlet’s ghost at play. They come and tarry with you, unbidden and unasked, Aiid flaunt their gaunt arms o'er you— add weight to every task. They watch the rays of. sunshine, stud guard your open door, Lest light and hope may enter and sing the songs of yore. Close friends are care and worry, >:tkey laugh and dance with glee, And pile th* faggots higher at each white lock they sac. They glory in the shadows their blaclc robes fling about. And while the cloud is o’er you they laugh and dance and shout, They ever walk before you. for should they fall behind, Their forms would vanish from you like mist before the wind. But over on the other side wait love and hope and joy, Mother and wife and sister, and little Bob, your boy. The robin sings m the willow and the skylark ohants his lay, And flowers blossom about you from the morn till close of day. Fling back at eare and worry their black robes of despair, And know as the years pass swiftly God’s hand hath rested there. Smooth out the great deep furrows out wide on brow and cheek, For trouble lies in the valley—you nre Hwriug the mountaiu peak.
