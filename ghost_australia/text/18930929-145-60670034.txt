WARRANDYTE MECHANICS' INSTITUTE. THE WARRANDYTE VARIETY TROUPE'S INITIAL PERFORMANCE. It is always a very great pleasure to cordially endorse and encourage any- thing that tends to give legitimate entertainment and amusement. The Warrandyte Variety Troupe, composed of several respectable young amateurs fond of music, singing, etc., and anxious for self-improvement, deter- mined to give a series of entertain- ments, and their initial performance (in aid of the Warrandyte Mechanics' Institute), which took place last Fri- day evening, although the result of but few rehearsals, fully warranted their action. The troupe, consisting of Messrs. W., A. J., and J. A. Manning, W. Watkins, A. Livingston, C. Rose, and George Treadwell, were introduced to the audience by Mr. C. A. Blair, who, in a few well chosen words, thanked them and the public for their patronage in supporting such a good cause. The whole of the troupe possess voices considerably above the average, and in spite of the poor acoustic pro- perties of the Hall, the songs went off in, first-class style. With everything running on so evenly it is hardly necessary to particularize. Mr. G. Treadwell, although young in years, is evidently old in piano playing, and with Mr. C. Rose on the violin, gave great satisfaction ; his overture in the second part being a brilliant per- formance. Nearly the whole of the songs were new to the place. The coster song, "Round the Town" (in character), by Messrs. W. and J. Manning, was rather an innovation, and was heartily cheered. Mr. S. Graham's clog-dance brought a hearty encore and was followed by an Irish jig. As the troupe intend give a series of entertainments in the district we can safely recommend those who wish to spend a pleasant evening to patronise them. The following is the programme :--Minstrel portion. -- Bones, Mr. W. Watkins; Tambo, Mr. W. Manning ; Interlocutor, M. A. J. Manning; violin, Mr. C. Rose; pianist, Mr. G. Treadwell; Messrs. J. A.

Manning; "Tan-Tan like a Fairy," W. Manning; "Anchored," Mr. Geo. Treadwell; "Willing Chap," Mr. W. Watkins. The ordinary side business and jokes were quite up to the mark.
