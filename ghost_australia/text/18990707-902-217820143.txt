I Rocks that King. j a Pennsylvania paper describes some curious rocks that cover several acres at Pottstowu, They I have a metallic sund when struck with a hammer, I aud hence are (called " Hinging Rocks." Daring j tne first spring thunderstorms recently the night I was quite dark. Persons passing the rooks were I startled to see a light bluish flame rise from the ground aud spread over a 6pace 10 or 12 yards square. This flame rose and fell after the manner of the Northern lights, sometimes entirely disap pearing and then flaming up again, lightiug the darkness around it. They stood and watched this mysterious light from a distance, aud tbeu went close to it to see what cause there wrs for it. Some old residents in that neigborhood said they had seen the strange lights on nights during violent storms. They explained that the rocks were so metallic in formation that thejr attracted all the electricity in the atmosphere for miles around, aud through some natural cause the electricity became luminons, like phosphorescent glow, that lit up like the Northern lights. To some the fire looked like I a name rising up from the huge rocks whose cavern - I oub depths below have never been explored. These metallic or ringing rocks look as if they had been dumped into a vast lake and thoroughly filled it, so that the water entirely disappeared. Small pebbles dropped through the crevices of the rooks can be heard dropping from ledge to ledge till the sound is lost 50ft below. On some of the surfaces impriuts of human feet or feet of boasts or birds can be eeeu as if they had passed over the rocks when they were soft enough to receive an impression BDd then hardened and retained them. There was a story that a ghost that emitted fire from its nostrils i haunted the rocks, but scientific men declare that the roeks are so highly charged with magnetism that any electric disturbance will cause the glow.
