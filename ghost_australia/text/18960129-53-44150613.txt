MINER'S SUPEKSTITÍONS. SUPERSTITION still retains its hold ov: r the miners of Sooth Wales (write.- a London corraspondenb of Decenal er I 20 ) For some days work has been suspended ac a large mine, and 300 men were kept in voluntary idlenesp. It appears that strange and unusual sounds 'were heard by some of the miners. Two of them were sitting side by side at a turn in the underground passHges, beyond which were miles of old workings. Suddenly frjm this un- known region came a succession of piercing wails, horrible to hear. Ac- cording to the Western Mail, which investigated the occurrence, the pitmen took to their heel3, and as they tan spread the alarm. Tho report spread throughout the mine that it was un- hallowed, that some ominous influence was busy in the workings, and the men declined to descend into it. Their fears were intensified by another omen. In the early hours of Sunday morning a dove wes found at the pit's mouth, ar,d this, although ib was neither whits cor black, was regarded as a ghostly mes sesger. The mystery bacame deeper and deeper, asd the more it was dis- cussed the more extraordinary it appeared. A gamekeeper heard straDge voices singing dirges near a neighbor ins; Methodist chapel, which was built near the site of an old monastery, and at the very hour, 4 a m., that the miners heard the wails in the under- ground working?. At the same weird hour a door in one Of the ga'lt ries of the mine was seen to open aud shut itself. The manage» of the mine showed more coolness than the men. They asked the Government inspector to make a full investigation of the workings, and he, in company with the men's agent and a small party, made a thorough examination and came up with a most satisfactory and reassuring report. Whereupon the men threw aside their fears and went below again without any attempb to exorcise th( ghosts or goblins by whom they hac been eo terribly frightened.
