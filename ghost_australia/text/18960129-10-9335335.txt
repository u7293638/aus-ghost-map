THE BAND CONTEST. TO THE EDITOR OF THE MERCURY. ' SiN. Would you kindly allow me a word through your valuable columns with reference to a very flattering report which has been published. One would naturally think that this so-called contest was a thing to be looked upon as something grand. I am surprised, air to see still a miserable turn out of local bands in the competition when there are several in Hobart. It is no wonder the Launceston bands have stood out when such a miserable prize is offered. The contest that is now being held does not reflect much credit on the Hobart musicians. The bandmaster of H.M.S Orlando seems to fall in with the ideas of our Hobart burnie, and expresses his opinion that if the Garrison were to go to New Zealand and compete at the NiZ. contest, they would scoop the pool. Let me say, as an old member of a N.Z competing band, that no band at present in Hobart would stand a ghost of a chance, for the bands in New Zealand are far superior to any we have' in Hobart. The contests are conducted in a first-class style, where all competing bands receive fair play. By inserting this you will greatly oblige. -Yours, etc., I DUNEDIN ENGINEER BANDSMAN N.Z. January 27.
