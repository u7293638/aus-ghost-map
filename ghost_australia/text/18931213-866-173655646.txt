DON’T BE W ISLED A MiisiUiiK of Parliam ent fcn^ht to be view ed in two dihtin’ct lig h ts. F irst and foremost, in his relations to the S tate OS a w hole; and secondly, in h is relations to his constituents. T hat dual aspect applies w ith greater force to representatives cf country dis tricts. The duties ■ th a t fall to th e lot of country m em bers are much heavier than those entailed upon towh members, if the former com e any way near the m ark of efficiency. And tl£ reasons are not far to Beck. Indeed, we have been keeping th em well before the public for several years. Tho chief cause of increased re ­ sponsibility upon the shoulders conscientious m em ber of & ru ral district is largely due to the' system of adm inistration ib Vogue iu th e Colony. T hat system is in ­ herently liad, because it docs not satisfy th e just demands of deserving settlers, and because it casts an odub upon individual legislators which ought to be assumed by th o Lands and W orks Office. Royal Cotnmissions have sat, exam ined witnesses, and reported ib f&vo;'r of &h; entire change in ptcsebt m eth o d s; b u t there, as tisuA), the m atter stopped. It ^o o ld bo laughable if it were n o t serious, th is childish w ay of putting th e Colony to g reat expense by appointing Commissions to ascertain defects in public d epartm ents, and then w hen they bavo m ad e recomm endations, to pitch them into pigeonholes, from thence to b's ex tra d e d a t some rcmoVc d ate a t ndubilablc proof of legislative im ­ becility. B od as the methods w ere prcously, the evil was accentuated by requesting members fo r country constituencies to tarnish th e M inister L ani>® with a liet of works re ­ p aired in th eir respective districts. T h a t w ent on for a tim e, b u t the p ractice had not been in such full sw ing d u rin g Mr. P ii.lint.er’s term of office as responsible Minister. Now then, we see th at a responsibility which fchould be borae b y the Denartm cnt was shifted to the Parliam entary representative, and th a t practice is still recognised. H ence a country m em ber m u st be p a r­ ticularly active and vig ilant to secure th e zno3t trifling sums of money foe urg ent w'orks iu the locality he represents. When the district a n extensiro one, our readers will perceive-Chat its m em ber has a g reat deal to do, and a g reat dual to luok after. H aving made these few points ■dear, we venture to say th a t there ' not a constituency iu th e whole of Tasm ania whose interests are more im p o u an t, whose ^inhabitants are more industrious, and w hose bulk of trad e of different kinds is more valji' able to the Colony than th e rxteliBivu area known as tho H uon. M r. Bmp, M r. G ili., and Dr. Crowtukr in the H ouse of Assembly, a n d M r. J ohn W atchorn in the Legislative Council Iiavc m ade these facts plain year a fte r y e a r ; and if any one doubts the accuracy of the statem ent we have m ade, Parliam entary papers are available, wherein tho resources of the district are elaborately set forth. Unlike country m em bers in other p a rts of the Island th e old Members for KiDgborongh, Messrs. G ill and Ckowtder, have done tb eir level best for tbeir constituents in the te e th of jealonsy and m isrepresentation. The Huon has frequently been held up to derision in both branches of th e Legislature, chiefly by men w ho are totally ignorant of the distric t and its capacities. Even th a t political wise-acre plain M istor H enry D obpox has attem pted to poke fun at the H uonites in his own w eak, drivelling, inim itable style. B a t like m any more of his “ w asters” they did no harm . If he had any influence a t the Lauds Office he, plain H knby D obson, would p retty 6oon cut oS as many votes from the Huon as he could. But every person one m eets, except a few “ craw lors” and “ lic k sp ittle s,” desire to sec the crstw hilo non- R ki'Uesentaiim: for B rimito.v sent back to the obscurity of Elbodcn PJnce or tho C halet, there to aludy political econom y w ith th e ju n io r insurance clerk now knowu G eoroe S Chapman, E squire, who, th e strength of a subordinate post, calm ly tells the ICingborough Electors th a t uutil lately “ he had been in business.” Lot the Electors u ot forget the Dobsonian quips and cranks in tho political arena, a n d let them teach the prolegc of th e “ waning P rem ier" Ibattb o y do n o t w ant him to m isrepresent them in Parliam ent. Now th a t wo have touched upon this aspect, or rather farcical side of a political contest, we rem ark th a t although “ plain H enry D obson ” has been w hining over th o w orthy W ard en of Bbiohton standing for his native district against a man who does not care ono brass farthing for the pooplo or tbeir prospects so long as they feed his insatiable vanity by sending him into the Assembly,— he, H .D ., hawks ab o u t q u isitio n to a young fellow who has never been heard j m iles from home, and w ho happens j to have some “ siller,” through no personal exertion “ in business.” Mr. D odpon h as been talked ab o u t pretty plain ly of late, and if he is very n x io u s wo m ight bo disposed to onlig h ten him as to fho g eneral estim ate form ed of him by m any whom he im sginos view his brief political career w ith adm iration. T h a t is th e an w ho in the nam e o f “ m y abinet,” b u t w ithout th e sanction of is colleagues, is try in g to ra n M r. hatm as fo r th e im portant d istrict of Kaagjboroughu M r.DousoH w jll find t a uite enmjfrh, 16 ‘do in B righton istrict.

W ithin the p ast few weeks and w ithin the la st few days many ghosts have flitted before Mr. D.'s w akeful eyes, recalling a scone ho w ill find som ewhere in ShaNE- 6PEARE— 1 At mC «it heavy cm Uiy eoul Uus night I Is th a t the k in d of politician the people of Kingborough a re to accept as dictato r ?

H e is not a bore in the House, a n d be does & very large share of Co&mittiee; w ork, besides the fre- V^uent conferences ho h as w ith constituonte from all parte .of the Huon, in addition to extensive correspondence relating .to m atters, affecting th e well-being of those who retu rn ed him to Parliam ent. H is sense of fairness led him to take up th o grievance of M r. Beamish, and th e Tasmanian Ncics devoted tw o leading articles to the gross outrage p erpetrated a g ain st an honest and capable police officer. B a t when M r Beamish wrote to the Prem ier, all he g ot w as a cu rt note fro m his Secretary. W e think it rig h t to lay these facts before the electors of K iugboroogh in justice to M r.
