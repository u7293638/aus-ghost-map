MECHANICS’ INSTITUTE. Professor Jonas’ company appeared in the Mechanics’ Institute on Tuesday evening for the second time. There was a fair audience, and the performance passed off very success- fully.' The programme had been considerably altered since .the night before, and included a greater, portion of the vocal and dramatic element. The “ ghost’’ part of the entertain ment had been perfected, and the very clever illusions in the opera di camera of “ Faust and Marguerite” were presented without a hitch, and caused no little wonder at the clever manner in which the deception was worked. Misses Walton, Lane, and Vivian rendered several songs in a manner that gained for them no' little applause. Messrs T. B. Brown and Chas. Florence were equally, successful in their efforts to please, and Mr T. Buckley caused much laughter, by his humourous performances. Little Virgie Vivian danced a Highland fling, and won deservedly the ap plause of her audience for the energy and spirit she displayed. In addition to the solo performances, a duet, " Flow, gentle Diva,” was rendered by Miss Maud \Yalton and Mr Chas. Florence, and a quartette, “Good night” (Martha), by Messrs Lane and Walton, and Messrs Florence and T. B. Brown. The enter tainment was brought to a close by Mr Buckley’s original sketch, “The Mischievous Monkey,” which served to send the audience home in the best of humours.
