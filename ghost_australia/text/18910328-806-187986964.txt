The rants, as to the coming probate in which Mr O'Shea is interested. h aV o not. l.een correctly stated. Mrs. Wo-d an aunt of Mrs. O'Shea, died leaving about 1 I riO.OOO. She had bf.-n long in infirm health. Some years ago she made a will, bv which she left £*130.000 to Mrs O'Shea, and di\ided tlm rest amongst her nephews and nieces She then w-mt to li\e near Mrs, O Sh> a, who looked aft**r her. Later on tdu; added a codicil to this 'vill, by w},i:h she left all her mnn-v to Mrs. 0 Sh.*a. I he family contest both -wills, on tin' ground of incapacity, and < aim that Airs. Wood ought to b<» con sidered ta have died intestate, in which case (he money would be equally divided >» tween the nephews and nieces. p.y a clause in Mr ami Airs. O’Slvas marriage sett lenient, all monies inherited by either form part of the settlement, which creates only a life inte r) . st to Mr. and Afrs. O Shea in them, with the remainder to the children. In the codicil it is express \ stated Airs, Wood’s money is not, to go into the settlement, but in all probabi i(\ this would not override the condi tions of the settlement. ff this be co, the Court would have to decide how- fin* life interest is to bo divided between Air. and Airs. O’shen, ami as the divorce was pronourH-d against the lady, and the uistody of (} lc children is given to (he husband, it seems as though Airs. O’Shea "ould not personally take much by either will. It i s expected (hat the case will come on n^ ( . r Easter, and I am credibly informed that during the trial of the suit interesting revelations regarding Mr. Parnell may be expected. In an extremely unostentatious manner for several weeks past, olbicial enquiries have b-en made through th° Board of Trade as to the actual condition of the labor question. In this wav a consider ftble amount of valuable information has been obtained and laid before the Government. Upon this I am able to state, ilie Government are considering what steps are necessary to (-ope with the many difficult labor problems which just now beset them on all side?. In dealing xvith this question, Alinisters are un doubtedly confronted with one of the most formidable of industrial problems. How, it may be asked, will this problem he solved ? It is very certain that no attempt will be made to interfere with the hours of labor in nnv way by legislative enactment. But the suggestion has been made, by those who for years have been engaged in dealing with industrial ques- j tions in an official capacitv, that a special committee should he appointed. This idea is favorably entertained bv certain members of the Goverment. It is pro bable that some definite statement will he made, shortly, by a responsible minister in the House of Commons. It was interesting to watch the by*-play with which Mr. Gladstone, in his speech last week on the Roman Catholic dis abilities Bill, contrived to entrap Mr. Matthews into a statement ns to bis u? o of his ecclesiastical patronage, Air. Gladstone did not at all disguise his de sign* ob Mr. Matthews to his friends around him. After a little preliminary u f ging, which was unsuccessful, he ex claimed impatiently to Mr. Morlev, “ I can’t get him to rise * At length the |>ait too U) aml the fish was caught. ‘‘(lot lllBll w *** th<> Grand olfl Man’s Hu 1 l)ukeof Marlborough has secured 0} lions on lar-e tracts of land in Ala -1,1)11 and Tennes>ee which arc suppos. and ° , ' i ' nta,n and iron. 11c has rn .
