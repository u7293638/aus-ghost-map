AN OXJTLAND VOYAGE. Th© tall shins come, and the tali ships go, Across tbe purple bay ; jjat there's never » a ship go fair and fine, Beyer a ship eo brave as mine — As mine that sailed away. Bright m the light, and grey in th© shade, And white when th e waves dun j The gulls go hy with their great WIBgO spread ; Bat the e»ih of my chip wore gold and red, And th8y shone lilre the setting stm. liej maps good cheer in the tavern here, , The sailors home from sea ; \- Aht the crow of my ship, they feaot with kings, In emerald crowns, and opal lings, And coats of the cramoisie. Bine is the freight their shins bring in, But mine bears finer far ; Pearl?, and roses, and links of gold, Myrrh , and amber, and rich bales rolled, j As bright as tbe morning star. 'Twns May-day morn that my ship set sail, "With the dew on hor figurehead : Her bows were wreathed with the hawthorn bloom, As she stole through the dusk of the dawning gloom, Like a ghost, or a bride new- wed. The Maydays dawn, and the May-daya die, And the hour draws near, I know— The day when my ship shall come for me, To carry me hack to my own eountri©, j East of the sun, by the outmost BBft, In the heart of the Lode: AflO. — Rosahrsd Mabeioit- Watson.
