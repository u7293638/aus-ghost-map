".^ "What we have oboene Raying of household prnyer loads us to its more clevutod form-Sundny worship. Mount Calvary, ns tho nltar on which ' the ono stupendous sacrifico worthy of God and satisfying His justico was offered, is to us tho most' important scouo of Christ's work on earth. Through it the promised pardon was realised, and from it all His sacraments derivo their strength. So, nlso, tho holy sacrifico of the mass-the con- tinuation of Calvnrj'-is tho ono-holocaust loft to-us by tho Saviour, to porpctunto and koop living His act of rodoniption. It primarily, and in a certain sense alone, keeps open tho intercourse between heaven and earth, re- established by Him. As Christ did not chango or cancel tho commandments, 'Thon shalt not kill,' and ' Thou shaltnot stool,' so noithor'di'd-Hoor His Church abolish the order to ' Keon holy tho Sabbath day.' This last, quito ns fullv ns tho others, retains to-dny all its original authority. 'The form, which thut 'keeping holy,' is1»principally to tako ÍB tho sacrifice of tile mass. - And this ia tho ordinntion, not of man, but of Him who says, ' This ÍB My blood, which shall bo shed for you and for many, unto 'tho remiBBion of sins .... rdoyo,this in commemoration of Mo.' This obligation of sanctifying tho Sunday, and of sanctify- ing it ihus, is woll understood by you. Wo exhort you to be faithful in fulfilling it, and to bring up j-our children in the, same practice. ' With far moro fervor and reality than tile prophöt in the Old Testament, may we cry out, ' Thero is no nation under heaven which has its God* so near to it, ns_ our God is nigh unto us.' The mass is, ns wo havo said, tho porpetunlion of Calvnrv. In it are present tho vory blood thero st .!.* and the body there immolated. For you and yours, for tho living and tho dead belonging to you, that precious blood is thero boing poured out, and ¿hot sacred body is thero being offered. What an invitation to you to bo present. What a chnllengo to all the gratitude and love of which your soul is capnble ! What an opening for pardon, and what an opportunity for grnco ! That most solemn moment called of ' consecration ' is plnccd by God's saints in tho most precious setting of tho Church's liturgy. Tho angels nnd tho apostles and» martyrs ure invoked, tho words of Chri«t, as tlio Holy Ghost has penned them down in the Gospels, aro read, and into that saintly assemblage, that holy of holies, you aro invited. Tho Catholic, who unless prevented hy a serious obstado, absents himself from mass on a Sunday or holiday of obligation, is guilty of a griovoiiB sin. His ; omission is a gravo dis obedienco to that Church to which Christ has said: ' Ho that hears you hoars Mo, nnd ho that despises j-ou despises Mo.' It is also a contempt of God's greatest mercy, and a very serious neglect of tho means of salvation. "PREQUENT COMMUNION. "With tile holy sacrifico of the mass,- prophet and apostlo havo united tho recoiving of tho blessed Eucharist. 'As ofton as you cot' this bread,' says St. Paul, ' mid drink " t this chalice, you shall announce the death of-the Lord.' Duriug tho first persecutions, daily communion was nn ordinary practice in many ports of tho Church. In tho days of the,: penal laws mass was seldom said in Ireland or England that all pre sont did not communicate/ Arid well, in thoso tinicB, might men so live, for from hour to hour thoj stood faco to face with death. At present dnily communion is found only within the cloister; and tho number of oven ' weekly or monthly commuuicuuts is not ouo-fourth of what it should bo. ' Christ ' prepares His banquet, and, sends out His messengers to call those who wero invited.' Ho adds, ' Unless yon ent of tho flesh of tho Son of Mnn, j-ou sholl-not havo lifo in you.' Yet, moory Catholics pass whole years rejecting tho invitation and defying the threat. -The.pioty of j'oung childrou at- tending school, or, j'ust after leaving it,' is frequently ox posed , to tho gravo scandal of o father who for years . does not approach . tho holy tablo. What a terriblo judgment is such ii parent laying up for himself ! How fnlse is he to tho Christ, whoso words ho pretends to boliove aro those of eternal lifo ! How cruelly misleading is be-tjhtjs children, in whom his example, stronger than all in' Scconcis daily tending to produco a similar neglect. Ti,, Third Put religion is good nnd plensing m childron and* woin,3Ív but is not expected from business mon, is widelj' preached, nnd, oven whero not belioved, is largely practised. But this fnlse theory, sa insulting to man and so slanderous of his Milker, strikes its roots onlj' into hearts over balanced by self-prido, or corrupted by avarice or immorality. Religion carno directly from God. It was communicated not to the starB in tho sky, nor to the beasts of the field, but io man, tho noblest of 'God's works. Its first form was that of a mandate, which, whilo requiring from Adnm on homage to tho Crentor's supreme dominion, tendered to him nt the samo moment a splondid recognition of his 'mtelligenco and free will. Prom Unit hour to the present day, man has lowered or raised himself in tho scale of orealion, nccording as his lifo has been a re- fusal or o realising of his dutv to God. Hence it is that the meanest races of humanity have over been thoso in whom religion has had least part; and dntho other hand tho highest in intelligence aro invnriablj' found to bo such as aro most pormoated by thoughts of God. As it is with races, so also is it ¡ronerafly with individuals. The great men of every deportment of lifo havo been charged with, and elovatca by the spirit of religion. Catholio pnrcnls, wo trust Unit you will closo the doors of your children's homes against this wicked indifferentism, which withdraws tho soul from God. If, unhappily, yourselves havo hitherto been bud examples in vour families, wo besoech'you, open youl eyes to the danger of your BOUS and daughters biicoming victims of the samo carelessness or unbelief. " EARLY EMPLOYMENT OF Clin.I)UEN. " When your children leave school, do not pormlt tho spirit and habits there acquired, to perish. The years which intervene between tho ona of school timo and tho first dawn of manhood or womanhood aro tho most important of all ono'B life. It is then flint tastos begin to develop themselves; passions havo then to leam whether they aro to bo the rulers or tho rilled : comrndoships and associations begin to bo formed ; habits settle themselves on tile heart and (ho mind; nnd tho" spirit which is to govern the soul during after life en- thrones itself firmly therein. And yet, it is at this verv period that young girls mid j'oung boys aro most left to themselves. Would to God 'it was only ' to themselves_! ' Alas, in how many instance me they left to the first unsuit- able compunious that bcizo on them, to irregular houis, and to still moie irregular habits? Tho discipline of school life, and the respect for authority which it creates, soon givo way lo a time of uncontrol and irresponsibility; tho wishes of parents are disrespected, the inculcations of re- ligion mid morality nie set aside, and often tho very laws of the Stato nro outraged, till at last tho innocent and pro- mising Catholic school child of a couplo of years ago, tho centro of parents' nnd teachers' lovo and hopes, bocomes tho bettled-down outcast of society. To whom is this sad result, this proat disappointment, to be im- puted P To the parents, and to tho parents alone. After leaving behool, the boy or girl, but especially the former, should be immediately bound to somo tindo or profession. Let every care be taken to moko sure that tho occupation selected is healthy and suitablo, mid that tho persons into the company of whom the young apprentice is necessarily brought aro virtuous and improving. Theso points being ascertained, lot thero bo no mistaken kindness; no time nllovvcd for habits of indecision, unsteadiness, or laziness to take possession of the child. Set him at onco on the path of industry and of honest occu- pation, aud you will do well by yourselves and by society, and, best of all, by j'our young bo giuner. Through uudefinedness of training and of purpose, verv many of our people neglect to place their children in Iho'runks'of skilled labour. Hence, in ufterycars, you find Catholics abundant in tho polico force, in the navvy camps, in tho labour gangs of largo contractors, in tho obargo of public-houbcs, on the wharfs and on tbo cab-standB, duin miiking or fencing in tho fHr intorior, or timber- getting by the fever-stricken estuaries along tho northern coast. In fact, j-ou find those poor fellows wherever tho hours aro long, tho climate merciless, the labour unskilled, the com- forts few, and tho remuneration small. Why is all HUB tho case Y Becauso their parents brought them up to nofhing better. Dearly beloved, open your eyes to this mistake No enemy could do you moro injury than by this listlessncss and shortsightedness you nro thus doing to yourselves, mid to those whom you lovo moro dearly still. You who are alrendv working on new railway construction avoid thoso cursea'of largo public works, gambling and intemperance. Save your earnings for o couplo of j'eors, get hombteads, and ninko yourselves Bomo provision nnd resting-pliico for tho evening of your life. Bring your- selves within the influence mid comfort of religion. God never meant tho Irish Catholio to bo the wanderer that ho is over the face of tho earth. "MIXED MAIVHIAGF.S. ' " Amongst the most serious impediments to common family, as well us common Sunday worship, oro mixed nmrriiiges. In fact, the former cannot have placo with the latter; and, we may add, the latter cannot happen where the former hnvo been healthily prac- tised. Tho j oung mun or miiiden who bus from infancy lived in nn iitiiiesphore of Catholio commun prnyer, will not easily picture happinesB for himself or herself in ii faith divided household. On the other hand, mixed mnrringes render dililcult-often almost impossible-all tho duties of a Catholic home. Religion, which ought to bless a house with peace, and help husband mid wife, vvhoro neccssaty, to mutual forbearance, is often tho chief cause of dissension and of life-long quarrels. Tho fancj', so common before mixed marriages, that ' wo aro ull wor- shipping the ouo God,' however plausible in theory, does not! in after life, when worship takes on itself the forum of actual practico, realise a single one of its delusive promises Tho 'morning offering' of tho children, the pravers they uro to be taught the schools thov aro to attend , tho catechism thej have to leiiru at home m tho evenings the satrameuts, for winch in succession thev aro to bo prepared, mid which thoj nro lo receive the baiutiful ceremonies of their first communion and confirmation, all, in a thoroughly Catholic household, are so m-iny graces descending directly from heaven, and lnigelv blessing tho parents as woll as tho little ones On the other bund, in homes of mixed religion, how manj times do not ÜIOBO Bhould-bo sources ot happiness bocomo occasions of stnfo among tho parents, and scandal to tho childicn Some- times a Cauioho young woman is satisfied thathor pro- mised husband 'will not interfere,' that ho will 'allow her to liav ober own waj with her children ' Does sha calcu- late on tho danger of Ina changing his mind, or the possibility of his relativos by-and bvo challenging lum over his 'weakness m givmg-m on such a point to a woman i" And, in tho best of circum- stances, do»» sho set befoio herself tho having to do without his aid mid support in nil that regards the religious forming of tho childi en's minds and habits Tho mertness of her husband m the matter of religion-and inertness is tho best thing sho hopes for-will reproduce itself m her boy s, ns they grow nigh to manhood Indeed, unless whero a fnther has mado himself a degraded or repulsivo character, the sons almost invariably form ttieiusclvcs on his model Thoj continuo to lovo and respect their mother, and her i elation to thom, but thoy shufflo off her ' woman's pictv ' Again, what weight can her words havo with her sons and daughters, when, in after life, sho tries to dissundo them from taking to them- selves spouses from outside the Church?

Place a boy or a girl in these surroundings, steep one of them in this atmosphere, not for one year or two, but for all their years from five to fifteen, accustom them during that long time to do all their working, all their important thinking, without a notion of God , keep before them from lisping infancy to tho threshold of manhood or womanhood God-excluding knowledge as tho one interest of their lives, and, finally, encircle them for all those years with companions who are being similarly trained, and can you wonder if the result is practical infidelity ?

'Let tho Churches,' says Lord Houghton, when recently lecturing in support of Secularism, ' settle among themselves what religion they wish taught and let us know, in the meantime we shall instruct the children in reading, writing, and arithmetic' This flippant language goes down with those who welcome any insolence to Christianity It is unworthy of a logician or a states- man If the nation, or its Department of Pubho In struction were asked to teach religion, that is, to pro- vide, train, and pay teachers thereof, there might be some appearance of reason in the remonstrance Even then it might be required of it to take from tho heads of recog- nised religious communities a nomination of fit in- structors, and to furnish competent remuneration for the same But the State is not, in our case, expected to teach religion Not one word of what we have been say- ing, not a line of any contemporary Catholic writer, can be adduced to show that this is demanded by tho Roman Catholic Church What we do require is that the children, in whose well-being we are specially concerned, be left to their natural guardians, their parents, and that these latter, as they are bound to provide nurture for the children's bodies, be allowed to also select and furnish that of their souls Permit these rightful custodians of the young to say in what class of school they wish them brought up But do not
