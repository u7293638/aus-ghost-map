, THE VICAR. > His ta".k was like a stream which runs, \- r ' 1 ' Wuh rapid change from > rocks to roses; \- It slipped from politics to puns; -l ; \- : :. lt passed > from Mahomet to Moses: Beeinning with the laws which keep '?, The planets in their radiaut courses, ?? "V, And ending with some precept deep For dressing eels, or shoeing horses. :? He wrote, too, in a quiet way, _ ? Small treatises and smaller verses. And sage remarks in chalK aud clay, ' . And hints to noble lords and nurses ; ; ; True histories of last years ghost ; \- Lines to a ringlet or a turban, And trifles for the ' Morniog Post j And nothings for Sylvauus Urban, He did not tliiuk all mischief fair, Although he had a knack of joking. He did not make himself a bear, Although he had a taste for smoking ; Ann when religious spcts ran mad He held, in spite of all his learning. That, if a man's belief is had ? -K-' ' It will not be improved by burning. - And he was kind, and loved to sit In the low hut or garnished cottage, And praise the farmer's homely wit, And share the widow's homelier pottage ; At his approach complaint grew miid, And when his hand unbarred the shutter, The clammy lips of fever smiled , The welcome that they could not utter. He always had a tale for me Of Julilis Cmsar or of v enus ; From him I learned the rule of three, Cat's- cradle, leap-frog, and quae genus; J used to singe his powdertd wig, To steal the staff he put such trust in, And make the puppy dance a jig When be began to quote Augustiue.
