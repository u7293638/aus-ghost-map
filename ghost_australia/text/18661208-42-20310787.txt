LINES Suggested by the Opening of KEDRON BROOK CHURCH, St. Andrew's Day, November 30, 1866. M.H.S. To Thee. O Lord our God. we raise This House for solemn prayer and praise: Though not of carved work or stone, Deign to accept it as Thine own It tells Thee that a little band Of pilgrims in a foreign land : Though wanting many joys of home, Would have Thee with them when they roam. Tis true these woods and groves may tell Of Godâ€”perhaps of Heaven and Hell; But yet they cannot make him known, Through Jesus Christ, His only Son. We therefore raise the Cross on high, A witness between earth and sky, That He who died thereon can save From sin, from sorrow, and the grave. Oh, maf the Holy Ghost descend, Our Guide, our Guardian, and our Friend, And dwell with us until we be Made meet. O Lord, to dwell with Thee.
