, MY FIRST EXPERIENCE OF OUH COUNTRY HOUSE.

We had a long drive in a comfortable close .conveyance, hired at the nearest railway town, from - the windows of' which -the children • were delighted to watch the new scenery!as.we. drove along. The smallest little; darling of • fortable-in lus -wraps and - furs ,-as. -if •he ,-;.were! afcthe^^'warmest'ifireside.;?; ^ ourselves at the door of our new. house,-far m the-heart; of the country- ©reary and soh- . tary enough it looked.-standing by itself at the foot of;a; slope, with; its short, avenue of, trees leadmg up to the door; Soon,;howerer, we. were inside, and roaring fires in.every room helped to raise :o.ur -spirits;arid; : dissipate - thegloom;:>by imparting thatcheerihess which, fires only can give. Next morning," on exploring our new quarters, we found that their appearance did -not" altogether belie their weird and ghostly- reputation. Some stories we had heard about the: hbuse bemg harintedpas thc reason .of its remammg. so long unoccupied^ we of course; only laughed at.. The walls were of enormous thickness, and several of the -rooms . panelled.: Already withiir lhe" panelling, the rats and- by 'themes-which' had been;>put• -in several days before our: arrival, once again- began to hold their revels.. The main passage; waB. harrow, the stairs of stone—one stair leading from the middle floor, up to. the-bedrooms above, containing the public rooms ; the other .down to the kitchen range of rooms, below, most of which;'were :really, below ground; damp and' dark, with their wallsglisleniug with,moisture.; This f latter -stair-. led r.off the slobby, near the' :eiitTance, ! and the very idea tot'descending: $ gave one a shudder. Upstairs the .walls- were -sloped in over the bedrooms, and so as to give them a square shape; a part .of the width had been cut off by partitions;.next the gable, which.left a Jarge dark empty space all round; fbetween,-wall ;;and partition, .enough, as the proprietor said, to. accommodate half a regiment of infantry. This, however, had the one advantage of keepmg the rooms dry. - At the back of the house a clear ,brook rippled along,.- subject - to - rise and fall with every shower of ram. For four orfive, days ;the- storm that had .ushered as m, continued-, but at length one morning, a clear,-bright sun broke.-out over the landscape, showing us,'.from, the top of. the'slope, our vnsular.position with the German ocean on • three sides in the distance. Sea-coast towns were also scattered along the shore at intervaIs, and there appeared a pretty undulating country sparsely • planted, with . treeSj Withont village -or hgmlet:, anywhere to be sSen among the large cultivated fields,.except the big farm _steadings-..that-appearedhere and there at considerable distances apart. As time passed, and we settled down m our new, abode, -I.found that-the days did ,not hang so' heavily on my hands as I expected; what with ihe increasing; acquaintanceship iwith.. very kind and pleasant.. neighbours, and. shooting (kindly granted me by the proprietor) among hares^partridg'ej &c.;, iind. espeeially at large flocks of geese which had.taken a fancy to the .neighbourhood... The children enjoyed the country,freedom immensely,and the roFes daily: deepened m their cheeks from the strong «cean air some seven hundred . feet ,above 1:he sea leyet. ;: ;,:•'; V .--; - .

There was nothing now to be seen. Our one servant, I knew, had left for an afternoon holiday; and; wotild not be back for some hours. With a- shiver running all over me, half congealing my blood, I flew to the door and looked, aiong- -the narrow passage, but nothing .was visible. The furthest , end door , that opened to -the staircase leading to... the ^public rooms "above still remained , closed.

It was too strong; to; yield to ' iny . pressure. .Still the figure remained motionless. I tlien bethought myself of rriy. box of " vestas," which, as a smoker, I aVjfays carried, and struck a light. As the darkness fled, and the whole passage became visiblei'with.ihe.flgure in it, whom and what,did I see? Por a, little I could ' hardly believe my eyes, and wondered it I, too, .^vere in a dream. .',A;.riianj.certainly, in full flesh and blood, and no ghost, was there, motionless still, his head slightly bent, and eyes fixed bn Vacancy as iri a dream. .No sign ;i>£'8eSng..-me/.o>;'v(>t'.tiK jeagt'idaini at my .preserice, appeared in .his face. But...what was- sfiangest: of. all remains to be told. The face was that of an honest carpenter of our- neighbourhood, whom I well knew, as a very'respectable, steady-man.' I liad heard he had been in the habit of disappearing now and theri from his house a,t night for a day or two ; at .-'a. time, arid..of returning again by night as quietiy as he left; while he either refused, or,.was ..finable-.to give any account of his absence. "The truth was now " plain. The man was a somnambulist.

The man, it appeared, was. liable to be affected differently at different times. . Sometimes he had more than his'ordinary waking wits about him,in a.certain groove, in the forrri of an invincible cunning enabling him , to elude "discovery, and baffling all attempts, at tracing him. . At intervals ..he liad always.disappeared during the; night, the somnambulism appearing to continue for brie or two days at a, tiinel His mode of ingress has been described; and I: found, on carefully examining the passage, that while one end,of it led down from .the granary; as .mentioned, the. other led "up at the back of a.paririelling .by a flfght of steps - to the rooms above, into which he obtained entrance by- ,a...sliding deal ,ih the dark enclosure between rooms and gable. The man was about fifty-five,; had resided. in the district, since childhood, and became ac- . quainteil with the secret passage in the;C0urse of some repairs, o£ wliieh he alone had charge —a, secret he kept to lnmself." I.afterivards learnt .that ho had gradually awoke on his way . home, probably from the disturbing influences he had encountered; while;tlie. -warning given hirii jmder ; his Somnambulism had '.ite:SMl.'.''.;-At:the samo time, needless to say, i £ad.the "secret passages firmly built up, so that no one might again be'.subjected, either ,to.isecret;.inteusioni-dr-tb those hours_ pi suspense ..we underwent, between the :losing and finding of our child. .
