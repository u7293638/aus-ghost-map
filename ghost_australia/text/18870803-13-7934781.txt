I A FAMOUS MAGICIAN. ClOSE THE LONDON STANDARD.) A correspondent supplies us with some curious reminiscences of Ben manu the Wizard, ' whose death has just taken place at Carlsbad Few men were better known than M Herrmann. He had visited and per- formed in almost every city of Christendom and to the many fortunes which he made and lost almost every race known to civilisa- tion had contributed He was moreover an antiquarian und an artist and spent the leisure of his him on wandering in accumulating houseful of coally ware arms, utensils, sculpture, and ethnological cure names But Herrmann was not only a popular favorite he was a welcome visitor at the courts of kings Relate Czar gave him crosses of knighthood and large sums for his entertainments and the Sultan Abdul Aziz was never quite sure whether to regard him as a mighty Jinn ora chevalier d india, is it. who had best be I kept at a distance from honest man's pockets In many respects his skill has never been surpassed, and as he died without revealing his secrets they are always likely to remain a mystery unless, indeed, his intended memoirs are ready for the printer He true the most admit of pickpockets-all in the way of business. But though it is easy to understand how he abstracted the Sultans watch from the Imperial job it has never yet been explained how he contrived to replace it alter the time piece had been tossed into the sea The solution of the problem has been sought for in the supposition that the watch thrown into the Bosphorus was a duplicate of the one in His Majesty a pocket This is simple But M Herrmann who, though he chose to keep his own counsel, was by no means lacking in frankness invariably declare 1 that this was entirely untrue Nevertheless he did not repeat the experiment. It did not pay, except with Oriental monarchs He would take two pigeons, one with a black and the other with a white poll and. to all appearances make them exchange heads, and often amazed a restaurateur who was carrying a plate of rolls with the discovery, before he had crossed the floor that he had only will have to place before his customer Herrmann w" however perhaps the greatest of a race of conjurers now all but passed away he was a sleight of hand performer His art was almost wholly that of legerdemain and he could quite as easily transfer a threepenny piece to the centre of a pear on the luncheon table as he could with all the appliances of his art about him, on a public platform Quickness of an unequalled character ingenuity in diverting attention from his manipulations and a remark able faculty for concealment, were what gave him his chief dexterity lim inexhaustible hat was in his hands even more inexhaustible than usual and the globes of gold fish which conjurors are wont to produce from under cloth were in Herrmann s performances, even larger and more numerous than ordinary It is claimed that he and Robert-Houdin elevated white music from the level of vulgar jugglery to the rank of a Bennie This is to a certain extent true, they almost, for the first time, did their trick in the open scorning the magician s robes and the fur embroidered cap though even in plum evening dress the modern conjuror has never yet been able to dispense with his mystic wand Herrmann loved dearly to envelope himself in mystery he spoke all languages but all with a . foreign accent and to the day of his death no man quite knew what was his nationality Nor for the same reason, did he care to give a positive disproof of the absurd story that he could not sign his name In reality, he was well educated, and for some years studied and, we believe, practised edina in Paris, until like so many other men who have taken up the professor n to gratify their parents, he abandoned it to please himself t Latterly, he took advantage of the rapidly advancing applications of physical science But, for the most part, he preferred to trust to his amazing dexterity and match less keenness of eye In the East this is the special idea of the "Milgi can ' in the market places of Har bury, and in the bazaars of India, jugglers from Sus and the Valley of the Ganges may be daily seen performing feats which are to any the least of them inexplicable, their skill is, however, the acquired skill of men who belong to a family or an order who from time immemorial have prac used the same feats until they become won droualy expert in them Napoleon III sent Robert Houdin into Algeria to shake the Arabs faith in their Marabouts by showing that he in infidel could perform " miracles more amazing than any of them His journey was not however an unqualified success He certainly managed to so astonish the wild tribesmen that occasionally, his life was in danger from professional. jealousy But on the other hand he failed lgnomtmousW to even approach some of the native feats which were shown him And in Japan and China, without the aid of any seven of the apparatus, the local con juror can to this day mystify even Europeans familiar with most of the usual stock in trade of conjurors from the west In truth the majority of the modern magician a tricks owe everything to a m tion 1 ous application of the principles of science They are professors of applied optics, chemistry, and electricity, quite as much, though only in another direction, as Sir William Armstrong or Mr larson Their ghosts and vanishing Indies, their automata and their spirit photographs are only skilfully mystified effects produced by mirrors or worked by electricity, though, of course, they are not likely to acknowledge the fact, and far less to explain the way in which the effects are produced they scarcely require a confederate, while anything be 1 runs as Pinetti s ' Grand Sultan which clumsy as Finetta s brand sultan, winds answered questions by striking on a bell by arrangement," or the host of binnia automata which, operated by a human being inside of them, would nowadays a be despised by even a Hum . rate conjuror 'The "pitch drinkers," the man who takes blazing brigantine into his mouth, and effects to wallow molten and In reality quicksilver - have been relegated to the booths of country fairs, and in an age when every schoolboy knows something of electricity, it might be rash to repeat Houdin s trick of the light and the heavy chest, the lightness or the contrary being due to a concealed electro-magnet. Herrmann, as well as Houdin and Anderson, developed an excellent acquaintance with the teachings of Mesmer, and not only surpassed, or have done their successors, the pretended wonders of clairvoyance, but demonstrated the knavery of the rogues who duped the public by making supernatural preletiHiona The inexhaustible bottle," which at one time was a source of so much speculation, is now scarcely considered worthy of exhibiting before a civilised audience very body knows how the flow of the liquid from the partitions is controlled by the air holes in the top, according to a principle of hydro- station no more recent than the apple hole in the bend of a beer cask. 'The tape tying and sack feats which for a time were associated with the Davenport Brothers though in reality the American Indians had performed them for ages are now exhibited by the ragged conjurors who seek for the patronage of a sporting public in the London by streets ; while the Chinese ring trick, and the producing of a bowl of water with gold fish out of a shawl-though, so far as Europe is concerned, not 50 years old have become part of the i fuel tom of most amateur practitioners of legerdemain In brief, the modern conjurer is, to a large extent, no longer a Juggler Ila does not affect any mystery in youd a professional secret or two, and so far from making Bimpletons gape with lug " hours points," his magic wand, like stuffed alligator, his " incubus, and his familiar, is only too anxioustolethis patronsknowthat the spiritualist and the thought-reader ace humbugs, whilst he in an honest man who pretends nothing more than to deceive Science is his accomplice He tries simply to apply its principles and reaps his harvest in the brief period which elapses before the world gets as wise as himself
