LYRICS. ORIGINAL. To the Editor of The Australian. SIR,—The young authoress of the following stanzas (a LADY OF "ERIN," yet, in a great mea- sure no stranger amongst us), was most unwarrant- ably surprised by my friend William -------------, on the moment of their inspiration. He requested a copy; and, deeply-blushing, she presented him with the lines in ORIGINAL. The Lady, I trust, will pardon a stranger for offering her some CON- SOLATION, and you, Mr. Editor, will perchance favor me by giving room to both "pour chasser l'ennui." I am, Sir, your most obedient servant, T. Australia! I've roamed thro' thy woods, And marked all thy beauties with care— Thy hills, dales, rocks, rivers, and, floods— Thy blossoms and flowerets so fair. At a distance—thy mountains I've seen— Thy high-towering trees I've beheld; The sweet songs of thy warblers at e'en Have enlivened each meadow and field. I have tasted thy much-boasted fruits— Enjoyed the mild months of thy clime— I have bathed in the glory that shoots From the sun of thy noon in its prime. Yet, whatever the pleasures I'er found In this "Land of Promise" so fair; My eyes vainly wandered around For beauties I could not find there. And "O where," I have often exclaimed, "Doth the sweetest of flowerets bloom?" Then they shewed me a Rose as there named— A few leaves without tint or perfume. Soon the nauseous scent it breathed forth, Instead of that fragrance so sweet I've inhaled from the buds of the North; Brought the sad, sickly flower to my feet. And, as with indignation, I've thrown This Ghost of a Rose from my breast, I've bitterly thought of my own Wild blossoms in bright beauty drest— The charms of my dear Native Vale— The loveliest hues of the Spring— The rich music, thro' groves, meads, and dales, Which the sweetest of Choristers sing. Then a tear for my own Native Land, Has struggled awhile in my eye, At I thought on a far, foreign strand, Perchance 'tis my sad doom to die!
