Old Devices of PLotographers. There ate various ways for providing sur prising results in photography, things that in one age wonld have betn called magio, but in onra recognised as eoientifio tricks. . Tho ghoBt picture, lor instance, in whieh a shadowy ghost-through whioh material objects are visible-is seen between natural attitudes and occupations. That is produoed by an almost instantaneous exposure ol ihe figure that is to do duty as the ghost, fol lowed by a full exposure of the figures and properties that are to appear natural. Another novel tries was shown recently in a photograph reproduced by a prominent trade journal; which presented theproprietor seated at a table, playing chess with himself, sitting on the opposite side of tho table, while he, himself, stood up in the background looking at his two selves playing. The figures were all on the negative, whioh waB produced by the successive exposures of the plate, parts thereof being maBked each time Dy a blaok velvet Bhutter. Still another sort of trick is that by which a person who likes that sort of thing may ap pear to be photographed riding upon a fly ing goose, ot a fish, or any other desired style of ridiculous locomotion. This is done by the subject holding upon his lap a huge pieco of white or sky-tintod oard with the fanciful figure drawn upon it. His faae appears above the upper edge of the. oard, und seems, in the pioture, joined to the funny little body mounted on the goose or Bah. The statue pioture ia made by about the same devise. .
