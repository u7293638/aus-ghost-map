THE EIGHT HOURS ANNIVERSARY. THE PROCESSION. Yesterday) was the great Trades field day of Melbourne, and was celebrated in a manner showing the estimation in which the 21st of April is held by the artist and labourers of Victoria. The procession which is the main feature in the demonstration, has become the popular annual pageant in Melbourne, and takes the place of the Lord Mayor B Show In London the only thing at all approaching it for display being the torch light processions of the United Fire Brigades The two are of an entirely different character, however, the artisans relying for their effect on their bright banners and emblems floating in the sunshine, while the firemen seek to charm the eye with a pyrotechnic display in the darkness. The procession yesterday was the most imposing that has yet been seen Several new societies have joined the Light Fours League during the year and as a rule the now banners and designs eclipse the older ones in the matter of show Early in the morning the suburban branches of the different unions, many of whom have special emblems, mustered their forces, and with an ever accumulating retinue marched to the Trades hall, the appointed place of meeting At 10 o'clock, when it was granted the procession should start on the street parade, the broad thoroughfares around the Trades hall were thronged with people and the societies with their banners struggled hard to fall into their allotted places in the line Tram the northern and north eastern suburbs especially there were processions not of league area guns, but sightseers on the footpaths, all moving in one direction towards the main avenues of the city. The workmen of Collingwood, Carlton, and Hotham were apparently determined that their motto of eight hours' recreation should be specially abandoned for this occasion, for they were out to make a day of it. All the unfinished buildings of any im- portance along the line of march were bright with bunting than they may over be again The men employed seemed to have engaged in an active rivalry with each other as to which pile of usually inelegant brick and mortar should make the bravest show It was a significant fact worth considering seriously, perhaps, by both the members of the procession and many more aristocratic onlookers that with political parties federated, the buildings rising so rapidly to completion in the streets were far more numerous and mi posing than in the days when the professed champions of labour were foolishly) striving to make this a grand country for the working man by such doubtful methods as converting it into a very dismal paradise for everyone else Very decidedly old times were changed old manners gone What a splendid piece of irony it would have seemed a few years ago, for example, to see the broad banner of the Eight Hours League floating from the new buildings at the Melbourne Club, yet no one seemed to notice anything strikingly peculiar in such combination now A close inspection of the cunning with which the buildings in all parts of the city were adorned, betrayed another significant sign of the times The 'A Victorian flag with its union in the corner and the five white stars on a crimson ground, represent ing our favourite constellation, the Southern Cross was supreme everywhere 1 vidently Victorians are beginning to recognise that they, too, have a national ensign, none the less honoured because it has not been shot torn in a nation's struggle to uphold its credit It would be interesting to find out from the Bailmakcrs just falling into their place in the procession whether the demand for that flag as the prospective emblem of Australia has not increased since the Sydney federation convention and the pronounced colonial objection to the French convict pro S osais Next in importance was the Union Jack of the mother country, which floated loyalty from many flagstaffs, and after it no national emblem could be more suitably chosen to illustrate the motto that union is strength than the stars and stripes of the United States of America. In the streets special arrangements had been made to give the procession moving space The greatest crush was anticipated in Bourke street and here the usual traffic system was temporarily altered the intend nig visitor to South Collingwood for mi his omnibus meandering unnoticed alone I title Collins street, while the Bruns side street vehicles were allotted a distinct honour in being transferred for the time being to the fashionable thoroughfare of the city. It was no holiday for the horses however, and few of the omnibuses ran light coming into Melbourne that morning. Shortly after 10 o'clock the procession fell into line, the marshals, Messrs T. Arthur, W. Campbell, T. Bryce, and J. Allan having for the previous hour had a busy time of it. As the route was arranged beforehand the best points were soon seized The broad steps leading up to the Collins street churches I formed an excellent gallery, and were quickly seized. The Post office steps were also pre empted early in the day, and the broad | terraces leading up to the treasury buildings were in firm demand Gradually the people on the footpaths were forced by the crush over the kerbstone of the pavement and out into the street, the lane left for the procession being so narrow that the names of the large banners brushed the front row of onlookers as they were moved along, and those who held the guy ropes at the hide were literally obliged to work their passage in front of the procession a half dozen smart looking mounted troopers, on their strapping police horses, pressed back the crowd, and their duty was no sinecure Has it ever occurred to anyone that these same troopers, in their plain, neat fitting uniforms, are smarter looking horsemen than the units of many cavalry regiments Most of the banners has held a place in previous processions, and were Tambar to those who had witnessed these demonstra- tions One defect in the spectacle, v revived as a whole, was, perhaps, the want of variety in the design of the banners, most of them being the conventional square, with representations of artisans at work, and the edges ornamented with handsome fringe As a result of this adherence to the popular pattern, anything in the way of an original design, even of less attractive than the banners, at once took the fancy of the onlookers Nine new societies had joined the union since the last anniversary, and as several of these had only lately received the privileges of eight hours men they floated temporary emblems improvised for the occasion A few of the new societies, however, did more than a fair share in adding to the pageant In its appro- I prince place, at the head of the procession, which was led by Mr T. Charge, chairman of the Eight Hours Anniversary Committee, came the eight hours banner, the universal emblem of the long train behind it It is merely a plain blue banner, bordered with a broad margin of crimson, and bearing in the centre the well-known motto, "Eight hours'' labour, eight hours' recreation, eight hours' rest " Beneath it walked the members of the Trades Legislature, some of whom were the pioneers and promoters of the present movement. The visitors from New South Wales and South Australia were | however allotted the place of honour in the lead. The farriers, as usual, had gone to some trouble with their show. A smithy of rather limited area certainly for a warm climate, was built on a lony, and at the two (fires blazing inside smart looking improved models of the village blacksmiths made the blazing sparks fly like chaff from a threshing floor ' In the opinion of some of the onlookers this was taking pleasure sadly, but no doubt these critics were men who, only on rare occasions, were troubled with fitful spasms of industry At any rate the farriers seemed to like it, as they clashed did banged and perspired after the approved fashion of the craft At one end of the smithy a pony was fastened, waiting to be shod, ondit only.iei'Uired the village politician reading a newspaper to complete the picture The tinsmiths made a unique show, and attracted more attention than any other society out for the day three men in bright tm armour were a reminiscence of medicinal times, but the armour, although it flashed gaily in the sunlight, would have been of little use to the Crusaders Alien opposed ki Saracen spear heads. Two of the knights of the soldering iron were mounted In addition to this attraction, the trade had quite a little exhibition of japanned we are on a lorry in the rear Their banner was painted by the secretary of the society, Mr K. H Bromley, and was an excellent work of art The quana men had the other day banner with a representation of a number of brawny workers delving in a game pit The ironmoulders had a conspicuous emblem, upon which the disciples of the god Vulcan tended a blazing furnace They had a wholesome motto, " Unity to assist, not to injure," so it is to be presumed no thunderbolts were being forged there The different societies connected with naval architecture showed the skeletons of vessels on the stocks, and in another case it was supposed that the ceremony of launching a fine ship was just about to take place.

the morning the steamers lying at their berths each dipped their flags by way of compliment Accompanying the seamen were several divers in their strange dress, and looking at them one was apt to wonder that even an animal with such cosmopolitan tastes as the octopus should care to interfere with these objects On the engineers banner some spaces were filled in with the painted portraits of some of the dead and gone notabilities of their order The frame that upheld the banner was an artistic piece of work, the emblem being low ered or raised by the use of a spring Some of the labourers

being intermixed with the devices of the brotherhood of ] Freemasons 1 he con fectionera carried one of the prettiest banners in the line in the centre, the work of the society was illustrated, and around about it were worked in symbolical figures, represent- ing the arts and sciences, together with commerce and industry 'The design rested on a background of ultramarine blue, surrounded with a border of nell brown The banner, which was of silk, was both handsome and expensive The typographical Society made a splendid show with their new banner, which has already been described in 'I lie

were of course able to show some tasteful proofs of their art on the banner carried by the society On the emblem of the Plumbers' Society two sturdy workers were shown standing on either side of an open furnace, waiting for a " white heat Their motto, ' Hot and Heady " could in a mechanical sense scarcely have been more judiciously chosen but it would be scarcely suitable for a ju licial or

brought out the gigantic Havannah that was so much noticed last year, and on their lorry the Union Jack and Stars and Stripes falling over the side were decorated with samples of broad green tobacco leaf The mill sawyers had quite an important work in progress on their banner, and figuratively were turning out. sufficient sawn timber to keep a great many builders occupied The slaters, another new

of march the smart looking Highlanders were loudly) cheered The bookbinders bakers and left-handers who brought up the rear, were all raw recruits in the army of eight hours men The book binders had a small banner, but the bakers made a more effective display without any banner at all A number of them in their white caps and aprons stood on a lorry specially fitted up and tossed about loaves of new mode bread 1 he never idea quite took the fancy of the crowds, and the workers in dough were frequently accorded a cheer, these marks of approval being given in an encouraging way to new societies The motto of the bakers was the sensational announcement, ' Slaves no longer If they have really in the past been bondsmen, they are certainly jovial looking, well conditioned slaves and seem to have prospered in serfdom I he felt hatters who whipped in at the tail of the procession, went through their business of hat making, but unlikethcfarriers, they contented themselves with the pretence of working When the procession was fairly in motion, some 15 000 people must have been extended over that long line Some idea of the length of the procession may be obtained from the fact that it required considerably over an hour to pass any given point Several members of the Ministry had as assembled at the Treasury to witness the spectacle those present being Messrs Service, here), Langridge, Levien, and Sargood As each society came opposite the Ministerial party they halted, and gave three hearty cheers, the compliment being acknowledged by the Ministers It the gallant citizen

sunk at once into his ample boots Evidently the Ballarat manifesto has not made a startling impression upon the minds of the artisans and working men of Melbourne As the van of the procession was passing through the entrance to the 1 friendly societies grounds on the banks of the Yarra, the last banner could be seen leaving the Treasury, and having let a great portion of the city to traverse At least it must have extended over two miles, but the line was not continued s, for, on account of interruptions in the crowded streets, there were occasional gaps in the procession It was an undoubted triumph for the united trades, as nothing approaching it in the way of a demonstra- tion has previously been seen in the streets of Melbourne Sir George Strahan the governor of Tasmania, on his way to the I n usury to meet the Acting Governor Sir William Stawell, watched the procession with keen interest One satisfactory feature in the whole affair was the aspect of solid Comfort noticeable everywhere and the order and decorum which characterised the throng Even towards the close of the day there were few cases of intemperance, and the leaders of the Blue Ribbon Army, had they been present must have come to the conclusion that there was not such a vast field for their labours amongst the working classes of Victoria after all those who did offered by a too liberal indulgence were generally of the birch in type, and were in no way connected with the trade societies The SPORTS At the Friendly Societies grounds where the usual programme of sports was arranged to take place, the crush was very great, and it is estimated that over 20 000 people passed through the gates In addition to the athletic events which included a very amusing obstacle race there were of picot many amusements in progress around the ground, and the proprietors, of these sideshows had a healthy patronage At the door of a large booth in rough and ready lecturer, whose face kill too palpably that he did not believe his own announcements appeared to the crowd to patronise an entertainment vast and Htructnc in its way A magnetic lady would tell their fortunes by electricity- cirtuinly a new

with a Spanish name and brigand appearance, as shown on the outside of the tent caught cannon balls as they were fired from a piece of ordnance and this with the ghost of a steam man was a standing attraction there was s mothing too vague and cream putable, however about the announced attraction of several American villians in thorough working order for two become much of a draw All the fun of a huge fair was in progress during the afternoon, and as the embankment round the running ground I was entirely occupied, the majority of those present saw little of the foot racing and were forced to other amusements In elevated theatre the antics of a troupe of burnt cork minstrels were varied by several costumed Highlanders dancing a wild Highland fling to the music of the bog pipes the proprietor of a French "Aunt Sally Stand find an ingenious way of advertising himself When any of his patrons with a well directed shot upset one of the dummy female figures, he called out loudly in a tone of feigned concern, "He knocked a woman down Shame I shame I ' when a crowd, gaping for sensations, gathered round ; the proprietor, however, turned his attention strictly to his own business. During the afternoon the Carlton District Band, under the leadership of Mr R Warnecke played in the sports enclosure Mr J A Mansfield acted as secretary for the fete and w BH a distinct success in the position, while the sports committee included Messrs Lennon (secretary).

(FROM OUR OWN CORRESPONDENT ) MONDAY EVENING The first local celebration of the anniversary of the inception of the eight hours movement took place to day, and proved an unqualified success. The weather was all that could be desired and as the majority of the tradesmen closed their busing " places, a large concourse of persons Ima an opportunity of first of all witnessing the procession, and subsequently patronising the sports in the Upper Reserve fully 1,200 representatives of the various trades, who are participants of the recognised eight hours for labour, eight hours for pleasure, and eight hours for rest, ' joined in the procession, the largest contingent being from Pickles and Sons coach factory, which contributed over SOO to the total Other trades were, however, well represented, the excep- tion being the Miners Association the mayor and councillors, the Hon D C Sterry, M L C and Messrs Mackay, Hur rowes, and Dr Quick, M L A , were also present Arriving at the ground, the mayor, in a few well chosen remarks, formally opened the sports The Eight Hours Handicap was won by J Cameron.

Burrowes, M.L.A., and other representative gentlemen After the usual loyal and patriotic toasts, Mr G M Pickles proposed "The Parliament of Victoria.' In doing so he said that individually he believed in the Coalition Ministry, and while there were doubtless many who were not of his opinion, the) must remember that the fault, if mi), in the choice of representatives and Ministers rested with the people Dr Quick, MLA, in responding, said that notwithstanding the cm ping sneers of an ultra constitutional press democratic government had reigned, and had given to the colony protection to native industries, by which such establishments as that over which Mr Pickles was mentioned had been fostered and encouraged to their present success Having dealt at some length on, and adversely criticised, Mr Herbert Spencer's latest work on political economy, the principles of which, he argued, would not hear the test of reason and science, inasmuch as under the proposals the people would be deprived of parliamentary) intervention as between serfdom and an on joy ment of the rights and privileges of a rational community, Dr Quick proceeded to point out that unless there were less lative enactments in the matter of trades unions, the just rights of the labour ing class were not conserved, they having no legal standing under the common law there were four measures, viz., the Trades Union Bill, Employers Liability Hill Courts of Conciliation Bill, and the Eight Hours Statute, which formed a strong plotter in for the Liberal port), and he hoped that during the next session there would be a Ministry in power who, having the courage of their opinions, would demand that the Council should pass those measures Mr MACKAY, in responding, briefly complained that during the last session he found public debate was completely paralysed but he had raised his voice in objecting to questionable measures, and would continue to do so as long as he was in the House Having referred in general terms to the physical and mental benefits derivable from the eight hours system, he concluded by complimenting the committee of management upon the success that day achieved In proposing the toast of 'The United Trades and Mining Industry),' Dr Quick traced the origin of the movement from the 21st April WMl Several other toasts of local interest were proposed and duly honoured, and the proceedings were brought to a termination at about 11 o'clock BALLARAT (FROM OUR OWN COUHFSI ONDL_¡.T ) MONDAY EVENING The eight hours anniversary was celebrated to day) with great eclat A proa aston consisting of the local fire brigades with their steam engines and hose reels, the various trades with their banners and several bands of music, matched him the.
