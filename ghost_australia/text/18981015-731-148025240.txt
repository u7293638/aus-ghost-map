The Mayor of Woollahra (says the S. if. Herald) in speaWhg at the - Woollahra Council Upon' the1 insanitary condition of dwellings, stated that it was a disgrace the way in which the . proverbial ? ' coach and ' four' 'was being driven through Reid's Act within the Various municipalities. The good intentions of that Act were being frus crated in many instances' within their own borougtt, in which he knew of houses that had recently been erected with backyards measuring 15ft. x 15ft., of which 14 square feet was pccupied by back premises. In the adjoining borougb of 'Paddington the popu lation was1 So thick that no less than 20,Q0Q persons' were living upon' an area of 268 acres, in which borough, also, dwellings existed with rooms f.or dwelling measuring 18ft. x 6ft. 6m.1 ?? Sucb a condition of things he desired to prevent in Woollahra. This is how ' Outis' in the S.D. Tele graph scarifies Archbishops and their mode of living : — A claim for public sympathy is put forward on behalf of Arahbishops who live in. palaces and have five-figure incomes. They are obliged to spend so much on garden parties and such like, ehtprtainments that, big-as their salaries. .are, there is no money in the business. It is stated that the lead infejAfcWjl^ioprios' '--jof England are Tun at a loss to those whom the uninitiated regard as having the good fortune to be in possession of them. 'Hence, without a man has private means, he -cannot accept arch-episcopate office. ' Jiikely enough this is all true, for even on'a mitre it is hot necessarily all gold that glitters. It is a fortunate thing for the Church, therefore! that this state of things did not exist when the Holy Ghost came down in fiery tongues, for if it had He would not have found a man eligible for. appoint- ment. -It is nottin record that Peter or any \ of the Qallilee fisherman had big private in-, apmes from1 money invested in gilt-edged ?securities, nor was there-a man amongst Ahe apostles who had ja, rent-roll amounting to shucks; '''The only way they could make it work was by doing without fat-oalvecL flunkeys to hand ithem : things-; on silver salvers, and not being over.-solicilpus about wl^at they : should' -eat or what they should, .drink, or wherewith they -might be clothed. How would it be if. instead of complaining, about the inadequacy of their ten and fifteen thousand a year pitbanoes, their successors tried -to get over. the diffidulty by similar, means. . . ., , ; It may be interesting to many to know that tobacco planted on -the same pieee of ^ound will . yield a larger crop the second yearf'anJ so on; and will hold its own by a very little manuring each, year, but if iyou plant something else in the same ground after. the jtp^acco, has been -raised bn it for ^yq.rSUcc'essiyB 'years, you. will 'find . -the ground ' greatly depleted, and it will take two or. three years tp work it up again to raise potatoes, &c.; . .According Ao reports from Southerners now, at IfettaWas, tobacco has .been profitably grown for 50 consecu tivo years on the same piece of gronnd in the'' Connecticut Valley and other places!
