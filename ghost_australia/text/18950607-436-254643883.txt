PAYMENT OF MEMBERS. Had the Sapreme Court sitting in all itff Banco authority put the "stopper" on the darling principle of payment of members, many things of a large and groterque character might have happened. In the first piece there would be the ghastly spectre of tbe vanishing ghost, which is vulgar for pay. Then, members would be individually liable for every" vote they gave, a liability of £250 for every separate division. Farther, members' seats would be declared vacant and there would be no Parliament in the country, a truly pathetic possibility, Loss of pay would be a terribly melancholy contingency. There are times when £25 per month comes as a boon and a blessing to patriots as well as other mortals. Tbe plethora of actions against tbe members on the information of speculative citizens would be another gorgeous spectacle in jurisprudence. The Labor members, who specially shine in division lists, might have a claim against esch of them, totalling at least a hundred thousand pounds. Tbe wealthy freetraders and protectionists would be keenly contested and flooded with writs. But the most awful matter would be the summary extinction of a Parliament which legally appropriated rational funds. Altogether tbelr Honors in Banco had a mighty contract on hand.
