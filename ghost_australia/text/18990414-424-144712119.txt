Pedestrianism. A chaixknor appears in tho Welling Times to ths effect that Thomas Brummell is prepared to run E. Robards 130 yards, for the sum of £20 or under— if Robards will give him eight yards start. If Bruintnell can't run any faster than be did in Molong at last Hospital Sports it wouldn t bo a cantor for ' Tea.' Brummell hasn't a ghost of a chance on his receut performance, of course providing Ted Robards is fit and welt.
