CHRISTIAN CONFERENCE, PETER SHAM. The fifth annual Christian Conference closed in the Petersham Town Hall on Thursday 8th inst. The Rev. W. G. Taylor of Bathurst presided. It occupied four afternoons and evenings, was well attended and some excellent addresses were delivered. Among others may be mentioned one by the Rev. W. Mathison, B.A., on 4 The knowledge of God, ' a philosophical and practical discourse of a high order. The Rev. George Lane spoke on the ' knowledge of Christ ministered by the Holy Ghost, ' a beautiiul address forcefully delivered and containing a striking view of one particular phate ot the Spirit's work. The Rev. J. W. Leadley's speech was lively, interesting and stimulating, but the most striding deliver ance of all was by a Welsh Baptist minister from Newcastle, the Rev. Seth Jones. It is spoken of by one admiring hearer as ' a masterpiece of sanctified eloquence. ' The matter was evidently very carefully prepared and most excellent in itself, the topic, ' The knowledge of Christ consum mated in glory with the Lord; but the delivery was most pathetic and telling. The i Welsh ' Hwyl ' or ' Hywl ' came -(n, and though not 95 per cent of the audience could have pronounced the word to save their lives, they all felt the weird power pf the i thing itself, and one merourial minister, carried beyond all power of self restraint, rose and cried in a high key ' Hallelujah I ' The Rev. C. E. James (Bathurst) spoke on ' The Apostles' resolution. What is ours ? ' And was original in thought, graphic in diction and' striking in massive application.' The Rev. F. Langham was very good on Missions, and Miss Lynne spoke on Zenana work. We have not room to specify further but the Conference is regarded as a success, and was a time of blessing.
