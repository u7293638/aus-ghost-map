Anointed Speech, Under the anointing of the Holy Ghost the humblest child of God is qualified to preach the Gospel and reap its glorious fruits. How this turns ordinary conversa tion to account, giving it just the direction and savour it needs, and without any attempt to make it ' holy conversation ' or ' talk ing to people on. religion.' In a natural, unobtrusive, spontaneous way it will yield abundant fruit. A Christian woman sat in the midst of a company of friends after an evening tea. In an artless, unaffected, unpremeditated manner she spoke of her Christian experience— some of God's provi dential dealings with her, and the answers to prayer given. She seemed unconscious that she was doing anything for souls, but tears were in many eyes— light came to hearts. When the social interview was over, one had found peace, another had returned to God, while all seemed to have been lifted up nearer to God. She had preached the Gospel to the meek without knowing, and it was, as the Gospel always is when accompanied by the Spirit, the power of God unto salvation. — Dr. S. A. Keen, in ' Divine Life.'
