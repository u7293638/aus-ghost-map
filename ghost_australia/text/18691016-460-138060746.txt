"That is what I rather fancy myself at," exclaimed the Q.C. eagerly, •• Let me see, how many was it I scored Bob, at fee handicap on the first?" and he passed hiifiugers gracefully through his hair, as if it *ere Ms wig, and his jury sat before him. jfow I also " funded myself " a bit at pigeon ghosting, and so it came to pass that I oaught myself saving, "Could not we get up a little' fan in tbis way ! You London fellbws are to gtayuntil Wednesday; Barber would send jus down the birds on Monday, and on Tuesday we might have a glorious utile match. What say you ?" Jones, whose trap-shooting was, I fancy, but a myth, answered .that "he wouldn't mind, yet scarcely thought it worth -whilebut Carstairs, to my surprise, at once took me up. "I should like it above all tilings," said he, "and would be happy to shoot you a match just for something to give it au interest, and to try at the same time and get my wretched hand in." Could I want anything better f^-a chance, such as might never again be mine, of lowering the colours of a dreaded rival (for I scomea the notion of failure with such a "muff," as Tom had called him), and onty too eagerly and too gladly was it that I responded, " Most happy, What shall we say it for; a hundred aside and shoot at twenty birds bach?" But then I was sorry a little as Carstairs answered, a deep crimson flush dyeing his cheek, but with head erect sad a proudly beaming eye, "Thank job, bat I fear that wonld be far more «u»n I could afford; If yon like, however, to say a hnntingoaddle, I shall be happy to shoot yon for one." "Done.'"said I promptly, *'ahd now I'lleo and write to Barber." (To be concluded in our next.)
