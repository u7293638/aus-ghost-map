A PROPHETIC LYRE. ( Not by the ghost of Byron. ) The Treasurer pounced like a wolf on the fold, A nd his Tariff was gleaming with bunkum all bold ; And the cheek of his colleagues was as wondrous to me As the cheek of the sharks when they swim in the sea. Like thistles in forests when summer is green, That mob with their Budget a season were seen : Like thistles in forests when autumn hath blown, That mob with their Budget were smitten and strown. For the anger of men,- like a ruining blast, Fell heavy on these for their pestilent past ; And the eyes of supporters waxed sinister, chill, And Lord but once spoke, and for ever grew still. And there sat old Jack with his nostrils all wide, But through them there roared not the breath of his pride ; And the beard of Jem Byrnes was as white as the scurf That is formed by the salt of the rock-beating surf. A nd there drooped the chieftain, chap-fallen and pale, With the wig on his head and the ' ' brief " in his tail ; And the rest were all silent, unnoticed, alone, Their voices unlifted, their blather unblown. And the sons of Protection are loud in their wail, And the "idols are broke in the temple of Baal And the might of J ames Martin, un3mote by the sword, Hath melted like snow through the Tariff of Lord. The least said the soonest mended. Does Mr. Lord believe in this ?
