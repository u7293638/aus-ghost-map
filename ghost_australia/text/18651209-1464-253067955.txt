Bitter B(ee)roodings. Of Beer — and all the many sorts and kinds of Beer Whether the, hitta beya of club-fed swell, Or heavy w et of London drayman strong, Or e'en colonial swipes to loafer dear — Teach my to sing, thou Muse of malt and hops. Beer \s an Institution — hath its ranks And different grades, each sort a different grade, It hath its history too in legends rich, That cany us far hack to olden times — When our brave Saxon forefathers of yore Quaffed the strong mead — the mead of honey — And, passing some few centuries, we read How good Queen Bess for breakfast used to take Her modest pint of malt, instead of tea ; But since those " good old times" the world hath grown Wiser and still more wise — as man hath tramped The march of mind — that still goes marching on — Beer, with gigantic stride, hath crossed the world, And here, and everywhere where Briton dwells, There floweth British beer from polished tap. Whether 'neath blaze of glaring Indian sun, Where Bass the mighty — mighty renovator Renews the worn out strength of used up swell — Or here, beneath Australian azure skies, We sip half-pints in pewter 'neath the shade. And here let me recall my own boy days, When at the midday meal a mug of beer, Small, very small — the ghost of one small X, Sufficed to make one talk about one's friends — And after that when 'rived at man's estate, At College the Imperial Audit Ale Of "King's" or "Trinity" inspired our souls With dreams of triumphs in the Senate house, Of silver sculls wonTn the pair oar race, Or hard-earned scores upon the cricket field. But these have passed away long years ago — I never more shall taste such beer again, I must content me with a milder tap — And beer of Marian must suffice me now. My theme hath made me thirsty, and if I Can threepence find in waistcoat pocket left, I'll hie me forth, and have a half-a-pint.
