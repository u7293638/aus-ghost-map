THE SOUTH AFRICAN POSITION. TO THE EDITOR. -Yours, &c.;, PAUL D'ABOY. SIR,— Can anyone nay what this new depar ture mean? Readers of The Ballarat Star have long known th it Paul Kruger and C[?]cil Rhodes are keen rivals at the game of political cricket, and they know, too, that Mr Kruger hasn't the ghost of a show against the bowling of Mr Rhodes; in fact, Paul Kruger’s stumps have been scattered more than once. Why doe3 he so airily assume that Mr Cecil Rhodes was “the prime instigator of the Jameson raid, and that Dr Jameson was a mere puppet in his hand?" To my thinking, the brave dootor is not the man to allow himself to be the puppet of anyone. Prom the evidence which has been brought to light, he ap pears to have taken the bit between his teeth and made his gallant rush in defence of what ho believed was right, neither more nor less. As to the Boers’ puerile prate about war, there is nothing in in it. They may bluster, but Paul Kruger, although unablo to keep up his Btnmps against such a bowler as Mr Cecil Rhodes, must not be considered a fool. No man knows bettor than Paul Kroger that John Bull is neither to be frightened nor bullied. And now we come to Trans vaal patriots. Is it not the drießt of rot to tell a free people that Boers are “ endned with a patriotism to their oountry that has never been equalled ?’’ Had the native tribes who were robbed of their birthright by the Boers no love for their country? Does “S.A.” really believe their love of the land in which for ages they had been free was not equal to the lust of those who dispossessed thorn ? If he does, then by all means advise him to quit the Army and shoulder a rifle for his dearly-beloved Boers.-
