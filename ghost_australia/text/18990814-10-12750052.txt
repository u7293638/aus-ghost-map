ORIGINAL JUBILEE SINGERS. At the Temperance-hall this evening the public will have the pleasure of listening to the famous Jubilee Singers, and a brilliant programme of choruses, etc., is arranged. The Passion Play and phonograph arrived on Saturday from Sydney in charge of Dr. W. H. Lane, the lecturer. The Passion Play is rendered by Edison's newest and most wonderful kinetoscope. Twenty-two beautiful scenes, illustrated by 2000ft. of films A contemporary describes one sconeyerygraphically, "The thieves are seen hanging on two crosses in the centre is the cross of Our Lord Jesus Christ dying, on the ground. The Saviour is placed and fastened to the cross, and so realistic is the scene that one can almost see the nails pierce the flesh as they are driven into his bands. The cross is raised by willing hands, and firmly fixed in the earth. The crowd are seen to mock and jeer at the Saviour. The inscription is then nailed on the cross. Our Saviour makes a sign for a drink, and a sponge is then placed on a spear and raised to his lips. He is seen to bow his head, and give up the ghost. The scene changes, the heavens darken, lightning flashes, and the earth is rent with erup- tions. So marvellous a scene cannot fail to impress every audience." The " grand concert phonograph " is the latest and most perfect production of the Wizard of Merlo-park, introduced for the first time in the world in America on May 15 last. The records are ICJin. in circumference It must not be confounded with "graphs' and phones" exploited turner other names. It reproduces the human voice perfectly, just is clear, just as loud, and just as sweet. Its reproductions are free from all mechanical nuisances. It is strong and vibrant enough to fill the largest theatre or hall in the world. The plan of seats is rapidly filling at Walch and Sons', and those who have not b oked are advised to do so at once.
