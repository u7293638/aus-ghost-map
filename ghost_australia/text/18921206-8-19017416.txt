POETRY. THE OLD HAND PKESS. The altcr-dlnner orators who answer to the toast 01 the press-of the poor old press. They conjure up in memory a gruesome sort ot ghost That ever comes to bother and to bless. The presses that they talked about are presses run by steam And It is not th it I love the steam ones less, But the press that kinder haunts me and enobants me like a dream, Is the old-is the old hand press ! When I leave them jpeechifying, I can feel the frlsket flying, While the old- time ink smells strangely new and sweet i And as I jerk the roller, still the editor is sighing, Because he has the appetite to eat. Oh, it all oomes back and takes me to the village on the hill Where the old subscriber dodged us day by day; But the editor is sleeping in the moonlight by the still, And the old bund press is harvesting the bay.
