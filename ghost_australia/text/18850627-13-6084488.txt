'J he jrent uqiuiria of Lntlniid und JCuropo were not csUbhshcd until many )cars of experiment and the sacn lice of many thousands of fish had tnutht how to keep the water pure and nerutod, how to regulate the temperatuie and the food Buppl), and how, in short, to maintain arti dally thoso conditions to which the fish were naturally accustomed Mr Sherrard, m the official handbook, gives us a good idea of the difficulties of the task - " A piece of decn) ing sou weed winch micht escape notice and remain in the tank, an excess or msuflicienc) of the revivif}ing air, a sudden change of the temperature in tho water, too much to ent or not enough, mid the inhabitants of the tunk, winch hnvo been obtnined with cost and acclimatised with Buocess, will be found either dead or m the lust stages of dissolu tion " 'Hie trustees have borne in mind the im- pôt tant fuct that a state nqumiuin Bhould bo something more than un institution to amuse tlie curious und even more than a popular educator , and in the olhciul handbook it is stated that observations and experiments will bo carried out at the aquarium huv ing m view the development of tue fishing industries, "which have not )et taken the important placo they deserve in our economic resources. ' A consideration ot the fact that deep sea fishing is-or was until quite recently-still unpractised m Australian wntcrs will show the importance of this allusion to colonial fishing industries. One instance will suffice to show the necessity of extending the fishing operations In August, 1864, a small shoal of maray (a fish almost identical with the English pilchard) wus seen in Hobsons Bay. In the sime mouth in the succeeding year those shoals were bo extensive thut thousands were caught for the mnrket, und m 1860 they were so exceedingly plentiful that baskets were filled by simply dipping tliem m the wuter, and for Beveial weeks these herrings weie sold m Melbourne for a few pence the basketful This fact is almost conclusive proot that at the proper bcason heirints swarm in Australian open seis, und could be caught m the usual w11} by the drift net With regard to that still higher function of an aquarium which has reference to bio- logical research, the presence on the com- mittee of such prominent Victorian scientists as Professor M'Coi, Mr 1 llery, and Mr Newbery is a guarantee thnt it will meet with ilue attention , mid we may hope to si c the national aquarium of 'V letona not only rivalling in point ot attractiveness the cole bruted aquarium at Brighton in England, which has a tunk large enough to contain a whale, but also ranking with the one nt NnpleB, winch nllords accommodation for skilled naturalists to carr) on ícsearch In the meantime some lemarhs concerning what is to be seen in the present nqiiuriuin mny not bo without interest to those who propose to visit it Ichthjologj and cognate terms are suggestive ot ponderous "drjas dust" treatises, but thestudj of fishes nnd other mnrinc life can bo carried on without dulness " Dulness does not exiat in science, is the dictum of an eminent 1 n^hsh Mount, nnd it ia certain that fish hie, whethei ob served from a river bnnk with un ungiera lod and line, or view ed through the less exelt ¡ng medium of the glass aide of nn aciuariuin tank, aflords endless food for interesting re tlection. - II HIE HI PI 11070 \ " In Mibstanou urisul sun!!
