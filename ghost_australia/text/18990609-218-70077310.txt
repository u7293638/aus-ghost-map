WVhat is Luck. A Kalgoorlie correspondent to an Adelaide paper writes:-"Do you believe in luck? There are many in this country who do not. Yet 122 applications were made for 12 timber lots thrown open for selection in the Bridgetown district. Each of these lots contained seven square miles of timber, which is rented at Â£20 per square mile per year, and the erection of a sawmill ensures the renewal of the lease till the forest is as bare as a bald man's head. You will note there were 12 lots, and 112 applications. A ballot was taken, and MBr. Doherty, M1.P., of Conner and Doherty, who applied for nine lots, drew nine win ning numbers, which secured for him 40,320 acres, and with concessions granted him late, now occupies the position of leaseholder of one of the largest and most valuable timber areas in Australia. ' The odds were 10 to one against his getting one lot, and any price to a passion fruit seed against his getting a treble. But he draws the lot, the whole nine, and he will die a millioniare, if he does not die before he makes his money, just as sure as Charles Cameron Kingston is more than 1S inches high, and over 10 years of age. Luck? Great Cresar's Ghost, I would sooner have his luck than it signed and sealed license to rob banks. I wonder what he fancies for the two Cups '"-FINANCIAL ADVISas.
