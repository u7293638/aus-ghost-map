''Beit, Evan, send word to mamma by the very flcst courier ' to j5ttoh-i m'-nd.' Tbe boy gulped some steaming ooffee from a tin oup ; the horse was brought from I screening woods, ud saddled ; and, as he ' wafl about to mount, Miss Clay wbisptred, warniogly,— * Bemember ! when you report to ihe general, do not say too muoh. Tell him 1 prefer to report my own capture and escape. You understand P' 1 1 suppose I do,' the boy replied; though a oomioal look of bewilderment cr.'eaed his frank face, as he sddod, ' Bat I'll obey, all the same.— Good-by. Mr. Barron ; and thank you heartily, sir — Good-by, Pete. Here, shake hands. You're a perfeot paragon among boat-men 1' 'Thank'ee, boeey, lie, pholj,'. the black answered, gravely. ' I wor fotol:ed up dat way, from the nuss.' And the Lard band he withdrew from tbe boy's friendly grauphel-l oue of P«y ton Fitzhugb'a criup greenback*. 1 G-uod-by, Caro, you deur, l-rave girl ! You t ugrht to be a man.' The old vein domi nated the recklecs boy even thtn ; for he bfnt from eaddle to whisper low, * Even though Captain Charlton would not think eo 1' He tonohed the spur, galloping through tbe familiar woods towards Btuari's camp, and tbe ob'e&ry; notes bf 'dinner- call1 were ringing from the bugle as he - halted at the gnard-honBe. Briefly reporting - to the offioer of the day, £he soout sought the general's tant. The great cavalry . leader was pacing to and fro in the sunshine, his plumed felt bat drawn down over the high, broad forehead.' cut tbe wavy brown nair esoaptng beneath tbe hat, and tbe buge. ourly brown beard, were jauntily oombed, the great moustache I t.whted away from it in massive curves. 'Fr-*«'ng cold as was .the davy General Stuart wore no overooat ; and his double breasted jaoket, though carefully buttoned ?back, swung wide open over the brown shirt that o6vered his broad, deep chest. Well-, worn corduroy . ridjng-breeohefl, ending in heavy knee-boots,' and long, strong gaunt lets, completed his simple attire. From within the tent . came the jocund | strumming of a well-managed banjo ; and | the general's riohl«ngh rang out, as be turned from eome jest to the player. It ?showed ihe atrongjwhita teeth, gleaming under the moastaahe ; and his merry, blue eyes, filled with sparkling ..fun, softened into kindly warmth as Jie exolaimed,— 'Fauntlerovi or his ghost., dressed f.tr. Sunday I Why, boy, we -thought -yon were' inpriBonf' ' I was, fir,' the,, soout answered. 1 Bat I am out now, and come with important in-! formation;' ' Important P Cut with it, then!' The laugh in the blue eyes quickly faded into gravity, ai the general turned towards the tent. * Beg pardon, sir, but I was instructed to hand you thiB psper— -alone,' Evan said, very timidly for him. ' And when you open it, general, I suppose you'll . order me in arrest, for disobedience of orders.' From his shirt-pocket the boy drew a email, thin paoket, securely tied with silk and the knots seared with wax, its onl; superscription being, ' Destroy, if olose iiret-sed.' * Why,' there's no one but Sweeny inside,' Stuart said, taking tbe letter oarelessly ; bat the instant hi* eyes fell upoa the writing his hrowft oontraoted,^nd Jie slipped the paper ,iuto his glove, .as be called, — _ 'Come out, Sweeny Dinner-call sounded.' Then, as the general's banjo-player parsed, staring at the coont'a strange olotbes, the obief beckoned him into the tent, dropped the fly, and turned full upon him : ' ' Yon know the writer of this letter P' * I do, tir.' * You knbw its oontents P' 4 Oaly in part, general ; in case £ was forced to 'destroy it.' ' When did you get it f Go on, sir.' . This impatiently. 'From him,-' general; yesterday; at Havre*de- Grace.' \- Stuart showed no surprise. Strange. news oime blten by strange routes. But he aak^d, Bternly,— * You know the orders, Fauntleroy. What were you -doing with -with tbe writerP' 'Banning for ' the Ferty,' air. He got me out of Camp Morton, at riskoflitB life, brought tne to * the Ferry,' and—' The boy fcleoitared. 'Go on, sir,*' thundered the general. '* Tell your f tor v in full, and quiokly. ' ' * He naid , »-ir, he had imperative duty ia — mWashingtbn,_^8lr^ Evan went on ;~and he briefly narrated his capture, imptison inent, and escape. The general I dl seated himself, thepapket unopened in his band; but the ehaaow,of tho broad.bat bid his^ait faoe, save for tbe twitch of his browQ ^pustaobe from tim9 to '.time. ? ^ ' ' And no news pf: j^iss Clay sinoe yoar «apluref' he queried, suddenly. . - \- * She crossed with me, sir.

Wait,' the general broke in abrnptly. He opened tbe paoket, smoothed out the paper, and read rapidly, his lips moving in aooompaniment to the words. The sheet was closely written, with many figures and oocasional rough maps. Finishing the soroll, he sat silent and still, his head rest ing on his hand.and his Ups^etill moving soundlessly; for several minutes; . Suddenly he looked vp, a qua^nt ^leitn in hiB blue eyep. fixed on the soout^ as he asked, — j 'Had any breakfast?' *' \- 'Cnflee,-dr.''.:/ 1 Bnportat the Boouti^misi for dinner.' i ' f Under arregtiVir P f The deVil^; no, sir;. for duty}! thon«i dered the reply.- 'Select the besib horse Wnbng the' sewnts1; hive him well^ed, and report here at five o'olock.
