IPocii\\!. The Sin. of Omission. It isn't the tiling you do, dear, It’s tin thing you leaveundono, Which gives you a bit of heartache At the setting of the sun. The tender word forgotten, The letter you did not write, The flower you might have sent, dear, Arc your haunting ghosts to-night. Tho stone you might have lifted Out of a brother's way, Tho bit of.hsartsome counsel You were hurried too much to say. The loving touch of tho hand, dear, Tho gentloand winsome tone That joti had no time nor thought for, With troubles enough of your own. Tlieso little acts of kindness, So easily out of mind, These chances to be angels, Which even mortals find— They como in night and silence, Each chill, reproachful wraith, When hope is faint and flagging And a blight has dropped on faith. Tor life is all too short, dear, And sorrow is all too great To suflbr our slow compassion That tarries until too late; And it’s not the thing you do, dear, It’s the thing you loave undone. Which gives you tho bitter heartache, At the setting of the sun. —JIargaket E. Sangster.
