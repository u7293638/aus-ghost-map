Visited by a Ghost. A YOUNG INDIANA GIRL'S SPECTRAL LOVER. A ghost and spirit manifestation story comes well authenticated from Washington county, Ind. The ghost professes to be one Riley Mull, who died thirty-eight years ago, aged 18 years. It came into the Coker family a year ago while Mrs. Coker and her daugh- ter Sallie, aged 15, were sitting in the room by lamplight, and claims to have been attracted by the daughter. Hundreds of people have since gone and witnessed the manifestations of the spirit, which really did some remarkable things. It played an organ while the girl worked the bellows, beat a drum, wrote on a slate and talked very intel- ligently. Strangely enough, it thoroughly objected to profane language, and several times asked those who were present to pray, joining heartily in the 'amen.' The organ playing, drum beating, etc., have been done in other houses, where it would have been impos- sible to have fixed up any apparatus. Sallie Coker, to whom the ghost seems to be espe- cially attached, appears to care but precious little for her ghostly lover, and not infre- quently goes to sleep during its visits, while the mother treasures the hours of its visits. Mull, when alive, was her playmate. â€”Pitts burg Dispatch.
