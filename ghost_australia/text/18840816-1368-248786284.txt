CONFITEOR. A moment may oome to a man and save Eternally; A green yew-tree and a little grave, Anda memory. Heart throbbing quick, as the swift days sweep Past like a ghost, Long days, sad days, since you fell asleep, Little one lost. Can you hear me, little one, sleeping fast Under the yew P I have missed yen since the Death-Angel past Betwixt us two. Yean since, I carried you robed in white, In sad spring hour, And bid you here from the warm sunlight— Poor little flower! I may not roll back the sealing-stone, And see you, dear, But let me whisper you here alone- No one can hear. Why did you leave me P I needed aid, Aid of child-grace, For the evil things would have been afraid Of your sweet face. For a whole life's wrong I would make redress For your loved sake, I have sinned a sin;—let heart confess, Or heart will break. I kneel by the dead child's grave, and vow A sacred word; And through the silence that falls, I know My vow is heard. FBBRB SAUYAOB.
