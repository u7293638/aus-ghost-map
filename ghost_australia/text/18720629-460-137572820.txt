He helped the sailors at their work, - And toiled with jovial din; Be helped them hoiet and reef the sails, He helped ihem atov the casks and bales. And heave the anchor in. Bnt woe unto the lszy louts. The idlers of the crew ; Them to torment is bie delight, And worry them by day and night, And pinch them black and bine. And woe to him whose mortal eyee Kl&boterman; behold; It is a certain sign of death!— The cabin-boy here held hie breath, He felt hie blood run oold. The jolly skipper paused awhile, And then again began; " There Is a Spectre 8hip," quoth he, u " A Ship of the Dead, that sails the ser, And is called the Garmilhan. " A ghostly ship, with a ghostly crew, In tempest she appears; And before the gale, or against Hie gale. She sails without a rag of sail, Without a helmsman steers. " She haunts tbe Atlantic north and south, Bnt mostly the mid-sea, Where three great rocks rise bleak and bare Like furnace-chimneys in the air, And are called the Chimneys Three. • " And ill betide the luckless ship That meets the Csrmilhan ; Over her decks the eeas will leap, She must go down into the deep, And perish mouse and man." The captain of the Valdemar Langhed lond with merry heart. " I should like to see this shim"said he: •' I should like to find these Chimneys ThrO), That are marked down in the chart. " I have sailed right over the spot." he said, " With a good stiff breeze behind, When the sea was blue, and the sky was clear,— Ton can follow my coarse by these pinholes hap,— And never a rock could find." And then he swore a dreadful oath, He s* ore by the Kingdoms Three, That should he meet the Csrmilhan, - He would run her down, although he ran, Bight into Eternity 1 . • • • • Eight bells! and suddenly abaft, With a great rush of rain, Making the ocean white with spume, In darkness like the day of doom, On came the hurricane. The lightning flashed from cloud to cloud, And tore the dark in two j A jagged flame, aeinglejet Of white fire, like a bayonet, That pieroed his eyeballs through. Then all around was dark again, And blacker than before: Bat in that single flash of light The captain saw a fearful sight. And thought of the bath he swore. For right ahesd lay the Ship of tie Deal, The ghostly Csrmilhan i Her masts were stripped her yards were bare, And on her bowsprit, poised in air. Sat the Klaboterman. Her crew of ghosts was all on deck, Or clambering np the shrouds ; The boatswain's whistle, the capttinb hail, Were like the piping of the gale, And thunder in the clouds. And close behind the Csrmilhan There rose np from theses, As from s foundered ship ofatonm Three bare and splintered masts alone; They were the Chimnpys Three I ■ >• And onward dashed ths Valdemar, ■ " And leaped into the darkr r A denser mist, scolder blast, - 1 A little shudder^ and she had pamei Bight through the Phantom Baric.
