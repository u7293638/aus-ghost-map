Ho had dismissed tho olerkB, for ho had no need of assistance ; every detail refer ring to tho wharf was entered in tho books upon tho shelves around him. Still tho silonco seemed each moment moro opprcssivo. It was past nine. What cou'd Ducket bo doing bo noise lessly down stairs, ho wondered 1 It was so strange ho had neither hoard tho aound of hia voice ,.nor footsteps.

Ho imagined tho figure of Clog etoun, as Ducket had described it, loaning over. tho parapet of the bridge. Was the mnh thero to-night, ho wondered ? Ho could not ro3ist the temptation to stretch out hia , hand and draw the curtain back from tho window and look out upon the dark river. Tho lights flickered on tho bridge ; but they woro too dim to havo enabled Mr. Lintock to distinguish one figure from another. Yet ho fancied that, dark as it was, ho could discern a shadowy ' form standing lioar tho contro of the bridge, and that the form resembled that of tho man with whoso faoe bo was so painfully hatintcd.

It .was a huge storeroom; its area represented tho dimensions of tho ontiro warehoueo ; and although thero wore piles of merchandise on all sides of tho iron pillars which sup ported tho floor above, its great sizo waB still appuront, for thero wore avenucB in every direction botwoen those goodly pilos wido enough for tho truoliB to run to' and fro. Noar tho rivor ontranco to this. store- room stood a woodon shod ; it had a' door facing tho main avonuo, and a small win dow on oaoh sido. On the door was writton1 'Superintendent's office.' Duckot. raised the latch and. steppod in. Thoro was a desk under ono of tho windows, and under tho other stood a stovo with a fiin nol disappearing through a hole in the wood-work. Tho foroman drew up a ohair in front of this stovo, and having looked at tho lire and fed it with charooal, hp began to ap poaso hia appotito out of a pail and a blackened tin can with a cork in it. Ho ato his supper with apparent rolifih ; but tho mixtures in tho can did not Boom to hia taste, for ho rejected it with a grimaco after tho first draught. 'I'd rather drink a pint of senna,' ho declared, driving tho cork homo oinphati cally with tho palm of hia hand, ' than another drop. of that stuff.' Ho lit his pipo with an air of resigna-' tion, leaned baok in hin chair and stared porplbxedly at tho'tin can. Had anyono, boon playing him a trick ? Ho waa bo ginning to get . ro aloupy. that tho avails of tho shod appeared io expand, and his head to grow proportionately larger. It was a maddening Bonnntion. Ho tried to throw oif hia drowsiness, for ho waa tlio solb watchman in tho building. 'If any catastrophe occurred tho blame would fall on his Hhuuldors. ' Duckot took hia lantern and wont out. Ho began to paco up and down tho centrn ? avonuo botweon pyramids of bales. No matter whether lit) turned to the right or If ft ho was always becoming moro and more impresaod with tho fact that uncor tainty lay beyond. This soon ended by tho lantoin's falling from hia hand and going out ; thi»n ho sank on tho ground with hia hond resting on a hard bulo. Was ho dreaming? It heemed to Ducket as in adroam thatsomeono glidod past him liko a ghost, and thut a light flashed boforo his oyes ; then an interval of dai'knosa and confusion followed, until he awoko with a start, strongly convinced that ho had boon roused by tho clang of tho warohouso boll.

Ho took 11 lantern from tho wall, and lighting, it '(?lanced anxiously at tho dock. ' Half-past ten !' he exclaimed ; 'why-' It teds tho warohouso boll. It wns no dream now ; it sounded liko an -'alarm, it. ,wus so incessant.

Duckot, still more perplexed at Over beck's mnnner, hastened up-st.-firs with out a woid. lie wns ro'zcd with a dioad ful senao of apprchonsion ; and on open ing Mr. Lintock's door, ho uttered a sup pressed cry. Tho wharf-ownor's room was empty ; but tho lamp upon-ljis desk was^ burning, and the light thrown upon, his papers showed them in disordor. An inkstand had boon upset upon tho trMo, and .the ink was trickling down into a pool upon tho floor. \- Ovorbeclc stepped forward, took a quirk Rlanoo round him. Thou ho looked koenlv otDuckot. ' Clogstoun has boon horo. no and Mr. Lintock have mot.' Tho foreman's faeo expressod a Icok of horror. 'Now, Duckot,' Raid Percy Overbook, placing hii hand upon tho foremnn'a shoulder, ' norvoyouiaolf. Lotussoarch tho warehouse.' The warehouse was explorbd from roof to basement. Tho foroman who had known every turning among tho dnrlc lanes of merchandise ainco boyhood, took the lead,' flashing hin lantern into every nook and corner. On each floor thoy called on Mr. Lintock loudly by namo ; but only* an echo of thoir voicps roncl'od them; They stood onco moro within tho wharf-owner's room. ! 'Diipkbt;' said Ovorbeck, 'east your byes carefully around. Ia anything mia singr1;' ; '. .Tho.'light from tho foreman's lantern mpyed. ovor tho floor and then slowly round tho walls.

' The koy, air, to that privato door ;' pnd Duckot pointed to a dooroppoaito tho window. - v; '-?'' But,' said Overbook, ' that lends out upon tlio wharf. ? And,' he added, turn ing the handle, ' it's locked. What can it mean ?' ?''' 'It moans,' said tho foromau with suddon inspiration, ' that, dead or alivo, master has gone out by that door.' Without loaa of time, by meana of tho superintendent's key, they made thoir way out' upon tho landing-atago. Thoy looked oagorly across tho diirk rivor. Tho tide was lapping monotonously against the sidoa of the wharf ; chains woro rattling, boats and barges moored along aido croaked and strained at their ropea. Presently Duckot. who went flashing about with hia lantern, cried out : ' Thoro'a a boat gone 1' 'Ah! Is the tido obbing ?' '-:.-. . ' Ay, air, ebbing fast.' . / ? Overbook rollocted a moment; then ho aaid : ^\ ? ' Givo mo tho lantern. ' Dueket obeyed. '.' . )','.'? .'.???';? ' Now,' addod Ovorbeck1,,, 'unfasten a boat, and lot us row down' fho stream.

' Yes, by all moans ; with tho tido.' And ao, w-it.h Duckot grasping tho rud der and Ovorbeclc tho acullo, tho bo.it moved out into mid-atroam.

'?; \ ,}.'-: ; , ;?'..,.! Bortha Lintook, although made awaro in a mesnago from hor fathor that ho 'should not roturn until late, began to grow anxious towards midnight. Sho paced up aud down her room, and con stantly listened for tlio sound of wheels 111 tho onrriago-drivo ; tho unpleasant alihir, of which Percy Ovorbeclc had epokon to hor reassuringly, recurred to -.her mind. Though trusting in Percy, oho oould not; coiuiuor her atrong presenti me'n.f of danger ; for, when a child, Wythred's wharf had mado a dcop im prenaion upon Bortha. Whilo walking at hor fathor'a sido through the great sombro atoro-rooms, they had reached norao piio sa,r;o— walled with bali;s of morchandiso— so dark and lmvrow that aho shrunk back with, sudden fright, and would go no further. That was hor first visit, and sho had novor entered it ainco. Presently, Bertha hoard a hurriod step outsido tho house. Shorau to tho win dow and throw it open. Ovovbeclc stood below. ' ' Percy, baa anything happened ?' sho aoked. ' Whoro is my father P' ? ' Ho is hero, Bortha— -at tho gatp. You havo no nood to bo aldrinbd.' Bertha hastened into tho hall. Porcy Overheck mot hor at the door, and thoy wont into tho dining-room to gether. 'Your fathor has boon again seized with that odd fanny,' Percy hastens to tell her. ' Ho bolioves that wliilo seated in his oflioo this evening, Clogstoun .threatened him. Panic- stricken, ho cs oaped from this phantom, or roality, down hia private staircase leading to the wharf. Hero; groping his way to tho barges, ho dropped into a boat, and, aot ins; it adrift , wont out with tho tido. Ducket nnd I— to cut along story short overtook tho bo.it, and — ' -??? At this. moment Mr. Lintook slowly en tered the room, loaning on Ducket's arm. Ilia' clothes wero wot and bespattered flilh mud. Seeing hia duughtor, ho atep ped toward her, but losing strength, sank into ii chuir. Bortha ran to his sido and bent over him. ' Aro j'ou hurt, fathor ?' 'No, my dear, only oxhauslcd. Porcy and our old friend Duckot,' said ho, looking up gratefully into their faces, 'havo saved iny lifo,' Tho wharf-owner's nerves woro badly shaken. But a few days' rest, under his daughter's thoughtful supervision, ro stored him to health. Clbgstoun'a faco novor haunted Mr. Lintock ngain ; for on tho day after this occurrence, the man was found at tho warohouao among somo bags of sea damiiged homp-soed, breathing hia last ; and as .1 small phial was discovered at hia side containing traces of a naicouc, it was conjectured that ho had pouied this drug into Duckot's tin can; and had himself swallowed tho reat with a otiong resolve to bring hia wretched existence to an end, For some timo Mr. Lintock avoided tho subject oE his flight from tho olllcoand from tho faco. It appeared, however, that at tho momont whon Ologstoun forced hia way into Iho room, tho wharf owner re'reated through fho privato door. This door he locked behind him, in order to cut off punuit ; and thus separated from tho Thames-street exit by Glogstoun'a prcsonco, Mr. Lintock made his cscapo by water. In after days, when Bertha had become Ovcrbeck's wife, thoy often dwolt on that midnight affair at Wythred's wharf 4 and it transpired how Percy, frequently on tho watch ' for Ciogstoun, having learnt something of ;:hia haunts and habits, had reason to supposo that ho had found a meani of getting into tho whaiehouso. For thia reason ho had appointod that meeting with Ducket, though scarcely imagining that events would lako f-uch a strango turn as they had dono.
