BISHOP MOORHOUSE ON THE REVISED NEW TESTAMENT. The following is the full text of the lecture by the Right Rev Dr. Moorhouse, Bishop of Melbourne, on "The Doctrinal Effects of the New Version of the Testament," which was delivered at Sandhurst, on Wednesday evening, and of which a condensed report by telegraph appeared in The Argus of Thursday. The Rev Canon MacCullagh occupied the chair. Bishop Moorhouse said -Ladies and Gentlemen,-I have undertaken a task which Somebody, I think, ought to attempt at this particular time It is not to give a minute criticism of the scholarship of the Revision Committee of the New Testament That is a task which, considering the eminent character of the persons composing that committee, any scholar might name rally shrink from Nor would the at tempts, by whomsoever made, be intelligible or profitable to nine people out of ten. The people want to know what changes, if any, have been made not in the verbal' form, but in the substantial teaching of the New Testament Tins they have a right to ask, and Somebody should try to answer this question for them Hence the present at tempt I must, however, bespeak your in indulgence, for I fear that in the execution of my task I must appear not a little tedious to you My lecture must have the, fault of old fashioned sermons It must abound in texts, and as these quotations have to be made from an unfamiliar book they cannot be made from memory, and must involve much turning over of leaves, and some little loss of time Since, however, this is a difficulty necessarily inherent in my task, I trust you will make kind allowance for it One word let me say first about the title of my lecture I am to speak to you about the doctrinal "effect' of the new version What I mean is the doctrinal tendency or drift for what will appear as the result of our investigation is rather a tendency than a solid change, which can be expressed in propositions You may ask, therefore, why I did not propose to speak to you about the doctrinal drift of the new version' The title is a much neater one, and would have looked betteronahand bill But then it might have misled you You might have thought that I saw a drift in the mind of the transaction rather than in their work And this would not be the fact More indubitable marks of honesty, of an honest endeavour to give the exact equivalent of an original, without either doctrinal or other bias, I never saw in a translation Be assured of this-you have really honest work in the new translation The only subjective element I see in it is a little timid conservatism But then when you take into account the importance of the sacred documents with which the committee were dealing, and their resolve based upon this fact that no change should be made in the old version without the consent of two third of the company, the wonder is not that some timidity appears, but that more of it is not discernible One other thing let me say I have taken some little pains, as much as the time permitted, to qualify myself for my task I have read through the whole of the revised version, and have noted with some care all the more important doctrinal changes If I produce at present only a selection of these, it is because our time is limited, and because those which I have selected enable me to give a pretty complete survey of the subject. With these few prefatory observations, I shall now plunge in medias res I begin with " the last things " first, partly because the altera- tions in passages relating to eschatology, or the " science of the last things, are amongst the most important and distinct of all which are made in the new version in Matthew v 22, we find " hell fire translated the hell of fire," with the reading" Gehenna of fire in the margin I have no doubt at all that here the translators were wrong They should have put Gehenna in the text, Find have made no mention of " hell whatsoever But why, you will say ' Because so many gross and misleading ideas gathered round the word hell in the middle ages v" Hell in itself is a harmless word enough It only means a hollow place, and with reference to this meaning of the word there were called helliers (coverers in of a holy place in early English But in the middle ages hall came to mean a place fulloffireandbnmstone.in which souls were literally burned, place full of torments and friends, and all the horrible paraphernalia of the medal ival Tartarus These associations will always cling to the word like a parasite that has grown into a tree You cannot cut them away, and, therefore, the word ought not to have been used for observe, ' hell is no more a translation of Gehenna than it is of Hades Iladea means "the unseen world and in several places (as Matthew xi 29, Acts u 27), the word hell has been exchanged for Hades Where " Gehenna occurs, hall should in like manner have been exchanged for Gehenna Nay, the reason for this change was even stronger than for the other For Gehenna has a definite meaning It means the voices of Hinnom It is the name of d well known valley to the south of Jerusalem and thus it carries upon its fore front the site that it is nothing more than a symbol there was a very dismal swamp called "Batman's Swamp near Melbourne Suppose, then, that for its filth and horror it had been adopted by earlier colonists here as a symbol of the misery of Souls cast out from God W Whenever we had said to an obstinate sinner "If you go on in that course, you will be in danger of Batman's Swamp, he would have soon that we were speaking by insolently so it would be with a Jew When you told him that he was in danger of the " Valley of Hinnom, he would know that you were speaking symbolically And if further, you spoke to him of the worm and the " use of the Valley of Hinnom (as in Mark ix 33,34), he would know that you referred to the corruption and torment of am in another world under the images of the rotting carcases of the Valley of Hinnom and of the fires kindled there to consume them it is a very great pity, then, that the new version relegated the word to the margin which tells this story It should have been in the text, and the misleading word "hell should have been excluded That the Scriptural representations of the future punishment of the wicked are symbolical is apparent, too, from another circumstance The imagery under which it is represented changes in different parts of Our Lord's teaching following, indeed, the imagery of certain parables in which it occurs In Matthew xxiv 51, where the conduct of the sinner is compared to that of a disobedient slave, the punishment also is represented as that which a slave would receive His master shall " cut him asunder, or as the margin has it severely scourge him, casting him into that prison where there 1s " the weeping and gnashing of teeth In the beginning of the 28th chapter of St Matthew Our Lord had represented the rejection of the wicked under the image of the foolish A twins, who were not allowed to enter into the light and joy of the manmade mansion, but were shut out into the outer darkness in a parable accordingly spoken by the Lord at the same time-that of the talents-the churlish BOrvaut is represented as cast into the outer darkness, where as before is the weeping and gnashing of teeth Again (Matthew xxii 42) as the end of the tares 13 to be burned, as also the punishment of the wicked is represented under the image of being cast into the furnace of fire, where again in " the weeping and gnashing of teeth The only symbol which is constant in these representations is the weeping and gnashing of teeth, made more emphatic by the proper translation of the left the article The great reality represented, then, is sorrow and despair, but the forms under which this torments represented vary now it is a Scourging, now a abutting out into the darkness, and now again a casting into the furnace of fire the particular form in each case being clearly determined by the imagery of the context It is unnecessary perhaps to point out that the representations of the Apocalypse are all symbolical The fact stands out on the very face of the book It adopts and developes whatever of the symbolism of Darrel and Ezekiel is most striking and reals tie But who can doubt that it is Bymbo ham' Does anyone ever expect to see a city 1 500 miles high, with enormous gates formed each out of a single pearl ? Or does any one ever expect to see a bottomless pit,' rendered more exactly the pit of the abyss ' ' If so, he must expect to see also very peculiar locusts ascending out of the smoke of it, locusts which certainly would have been killed by the fire out of which they issued, if they were visible and tangible Milinda, locusts which forsake their natural food, grass and green things, and only go forth to sting men to death like scorpions, locusts that above all, don't belong to man's "future life, but to "this' life, where there is grass to avoid, and where there are men to sing' Is it not obvious that we have here a terrible symbol of the earthly retribution or Bill, and that in the pit of the abyss we have only an indication that this retribution shall proceed from the agency of evil. The book itself (chap xx. 5) teaches us that by " the pit of the abyss " is only meant the secure im- prisonment of evil, as also (chap xx. 20 xx. 16 and 14) show us that in the " lake of fire, which is the second death, we have nothing more than a symbol of destruction. For what are the forms which are there said to be coat into the lake of fire t Are they teal forma, susceptible of torture, 01 only ideal forms susceptible of destruction? They are ideal forms pure and simple. One is the beast the symbol of Godless force, another is the false prophet the symbol of Godless wisdom; another is "Death" the paper donation of an accident of human life ; another is " Hades" the unseen world. Does any one think that death of the unseen world is going to be tortured in that lake of fire? No one. Every one sees that the meaning is they shall be destroyed. There shall be no more death or Hades And why, then, should any one deny that, when (chap xxi. 8) the wicked are said to be cast into that lake, the meaning is they shall be destroyed Certainly it be the drift" of the new version to favour those reasonable views of symbolic interpretation. It renders chap, xvi, 7, for instance -" I heard the altar saying " Our version has it -" I heard another (angel) from the altar saying " A talking altar seemed to be on absurdity to some early copyist of the Greek text, and so, to make sense of it, he introduced two Greek words [allow Hi). These, however, are not in the best copies, and have been excluded from the text which the re- visers followed. And now, what is the result of this honesty ? It plainly proves that the language used is symbolical, for in symbol you can have either a "talking altar' or an impersonated Hades, We have seen what light the new version throws upon the question of the nature of future punishment. Let us inquire next if it affects in any manner, and if so, how far, the question of its " duration." The new version retains, we observe, the two phrases " for ever and for ever and ever,' as it gives in the margin their Greek equiva- lents-" unto the ages and " unto the ages of the ages " Again, I think that the marginal leading ought to have been in the text To render theBOGreek expressions for ever " and " for ever and ever, is not to translate, but to "interpret' them As it stands in the Greek, the expression " unto the ages," represents a future time " indefinitely long ,' how long is to he principally determined by the context in which it occurs Thus, when it is said (Luke i 33) that Our Lord shall rule over the house of Jacob "unto the ages, the meaning can only be unto the ages during which such a distinction us that of race and nationality lasts But when it is said, as in Revelation IV 0, that the Lord God liveth " unto the ages of the ages," this indefinite expression must be held to embrace all future ages. A more literal translation of these expressions would further have revealed their connexion with some other important passages, which the old version can only be said to have para- phrased translating age by world, Such a passage in Ephesians i 21 Leave the new version translates correctly, not the " world to come," but the age to come Doing so it adds definiteness to the meaning "The 'world' to come may be equally existent now, but the age to come, the age of glory, is wholly till in the future" it has sometimes been urged that it is allowable to paraphrase the passages in which such phrases as (as to us stones) occur, because the Greek language furnishes no better equivalent for the English " for ever." This is not the case There are several Greek words for endless (as attended, a; enables not one of which is ever used Nay, had the sacred writers desired to express strictly the idea of time without beginning and without end, they could have done it by a proper use of the word aion 1 or of the new version shows us, this is actually once, but only once done in the New Testament In the last verse of St Jude's Epistle glory is ascribed to God before all time and now, and unto all the ages ' This absolutely includes all duration, as we are used to phrase it from eternity to eternity" But there is no other passage in the New Testament where any of the sacred writers uses the adjective all to characterise the ages, a thing which had been easily done if the design had been to give the idea of endlessness Well, but surely, you will Bay, there is the adjective everlasting But in the original this is only removes, the adjective formed from the word we are considering It is interesting to observe how the latest translators have dealt with this word They never translate it everlasting but always eternal, a word which is related to the Latin alas, an age, exactly as the Greek homes is related to mon, an age The ambiguity of the original is thus exactly reproduced in the new version And that there is ambiguity in the meaning of this word, the version very clearly and very honestly reveals to us by translating, and not merely paraphrasing, us the old version did certain remarkable passages The most remarkable of these are 2 Timothy, i 9, and Titus i ? Here we are told of what happened "before times eternal Now, if eternal meant here what we commonly suppose it means, that which is with out beginning and without end, this is absolute nonsense, for what could occur before times which had no beginning If, however, 'eternal"hero only means (cowan eyelid! dis sensational, referring to ages which had their truth to realise, which realised it and then passed away, all becomes clear, and all most interesting Then it is said that God 8 " promise' and Gods ' purpose ' existed before all the times, which in their passage have typified, and partially realised it There is another possible meaning of the word "over nal ' It may mean that which in its nature is related to the abiding -that which is real, because spiritual And, strange to say, the new version reveals to us that the former translators, in spite of their sometimes translating eternal "everlasting,' saw the possibility of this in the new version you will find 1 Timothy vi 19 exactly rendered "That they may lay hold on the life, which is life indeed The old version is, as you Know "That they may lay hold on eternal life, showing that the old translators por ceived that the eternal might meant real, just as the temporal may mean the phenomenal, ' "That which is seen being very poor], that which is not seen being eternal.' life is very much the meaning which Mr. Maurice saw in the word ' eternal ' -a meaning which almost seems to be formulated and explained in Our Lord's words (John xvi 3), " And this is life eternal, that they should know Thee, the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom Thou hast sent These two meanings then of the word "eternal, the "cyclical" and the "real are clearly brought out in the new version, and this alone shows how thoroughly the revisers were justified in abolishing the translation " everlasting. Everlasting is an interpretation, and a very " precarious ' interpretation And. while speaking of "condemnations 13 important to remark that the word "damnation' has wholly disappeared from the new version, even as the word' hell ought to have dm appeared Thus in Romans xiv , where the Apostle is considering the question of clean and unclean ments, he lays it down that it is lawful for a Christian either to eat or to abstain from eating But, he adds, let each be persuaded in his own mind, for he that doubteth is condemned (not " damned ) if we eat And "how condemned By his own act, for whatever is not of faith in Bin It is obvious that here there is not a hint of final damnation In like manner the word damnation is banished from a passage where it has done more harm and caused more distress to sensitive souls than I could easily describe or you conceive "He that giveth,' we read in 1 Corinthians xi 23, "careth (not) 'damnation,' but judgment to himself, if he discern not the body. And that this judgment is only a temporal one, a " chastisement sent to avert condemnation with the world, is made quite plain inverse 32 The word damnation is excluded even from a passage where most persons would expect to find it, John v 23 29, where we read in the new version, "All that are in the tombs shall hear his voice and come forth, they that have done good unto the resurrection of life, and they that have done evil to the resurrection of judgment," whatever that judgment may be, the effect of the alterations in such passages is to subdue the accent of threatening, and to rob the awful face of retribution of something of its dread Bternness It is natural to ask next, does the new version throw any light on the question of a " possible future probation' for any of the dead' There is very scant reference in Holy Scripture to the state between death and judgment We find in Rev elation none of that " fanatical particularity," as Paley calls it, which dis- tinguishes So many false'' religions. The parable of Laroma and Diver is a parable filled with Jewish imagery, concerning which we cannot do better than remember the old theological rule, theologic par abolica, non est demonstrative But saving this passage, there is only one other in the New Testament which can be said to refer directly and speed fically to the state of souls between death and judgment That you know, IS 1 Peter ii 16 The old version left it possible to interpret this passage as meaning that Christ went to the AntediluvianBnoW in prison, when they lived on the earth, and by His spirit, through the preaching of Noah, called them to repentance 'The new version, by its more correct rendering, noa destroyed the possibility of such an interpretation. Hero flesh and spirit are be opposed that, as in the Greek, the word spirit must mean, not " the Holy Spirit," but our Saviour's human spirit, in which (not by which He went and preached to the Antediluvian in prison. We must not make too much of a single passage, cor present its application beyond its proper scope But bearing these cautions in mind, ' two things are to be noted First, While opening the possibility of probation in the state between death and judgment, the means of this probation are purely spiritual There is not a hint of the gross and carnal notions of the medieval purgatory. It is not by fire, but by preaching, that souls are called to repentance Secondly, it is to be observed that we only hear of the extended probation of a particular class of men These, it is true, may be only specimens of others But if so they suggest to us the continued probation of those whose probation was on earth incomplete What myriads there must have been in the great overthrow of Noah, to whom, as in all natural catastrophe, death must have come, so to speak, accidentally How can we believe that at such a time, or, indeed, at any time, natural death always synchronises with the completion of the souls moral trial, that for instance, no the falling from a house over kills a man, except when his will has taken that decided action which fixes him " unto the ages, either as a friend, or an enemy of God? Or how can we believe that all the myriads of the heathen, or all the children in Christian lands, who have been brought up by profligate parents, have come to an end of their moral probation, when the. suffer the natural accident of bodily death ? All these cases it used to be the practice to hand over to the uncovenanted mercies of God It must be a most welcome relief to have some light of revelation, be it only a gleam, to point out to us the means by which such mercy reaches its beneficent ends I have spoken of the extent of condemnation The question may next be asked, does the new version throw any fresh light on the extent of redeeming love ' I think it does In Ephesians let chapter, 10th verse, the expression, to gather together in one all things in Christ, is better rendered by the larger phrase, to sum up all things in Christ ' This phrase reveals to us in its highest generality the first polio of our Lord a mission He came that by His life and work. He might be enlarge all minds and change all hearts on earth and in heaven, that reflecting His image and being transformed into His likeness they might all be summed up in Him The vision of redemption thus opened is so vast, that it can scarcely be said to have limits on earth or in heaven in time or in eternity On a narrower BtnLe, that of humanity, a similar largeness of redeeming purpose is revealed by the better translation of Romans v 19 U Here, instead of many, which would imply the exclusion of some, the new version by translating the many, has pointed out that the Greek refers to all, to the multitude the mass of humanity And thus we learn that in the divine purpose the gift of Christ 's life was not made to an select few, but to the whole family of man We are led towards the same conclusion by the objective case of many of the new transit tions And here it may be necessary to explain what I mean by the word objective of the production of Christian sanctity two things are necessary, the gift of Christ's life, which is imparted to us, and that state of heart called in the Scriptures " faith, which depends, partially at least, upon our own will Now, what is done to us and comes to us without our own co-operation I call the ob jectiv e element in salvation while that which is done by us or in us through crowned operation, I call its subjective element Well then, this being understood I think you will find that through the better rendering of Romans 6th chair ; the fact is brought out that in many verses of that cHapter, St I and is not so much referring to what is done within the behoves through his faith, as to what was done for him at a special point of his past history, viz at his baptism In verse 4 we read 'wowerobm-ied with him by baptism unto death In verse G our old man (not is crucified as though the act were continuous and now going on but " was crucified with him, at a point of time in the past our baptism Again in the 8th verse we read (not " if we be dead with Him if we be in that spiritual condition now), but "if we died with Him in the past objectively by an act of His grace in our baptism Through what was then done, ideally, and actually by God's grace we were put in a certain position, and gained a certain relation to God There fore the Apostle says (11 that we ought to " reckon ourselves to be dead to sin but alive to God, not through Jesus Christ - as though our death and life might be apart from Him but in Christ Jesus, even as we were planted in Him at baptism Of course this grace is given that it may be taken and used It were of no value else Accordingly in verse 12 St Paul bids us realise subjectively what already is ours objectively by the gift of God in Christ Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal bodies that e should obey it in the lust thereof The same definiteness of objective reference is brought out by the better rendering of the tenses m 1st Conn things, chap xi, verse 2 It is not " but ye are w asked but j o are sanctified as though reference were made to an abiding State it is, ' ye were washed, ye were sanctified, at a definite point of past time in your baptism that act which marked and denoted your ideal union with Christ The connexion of the objective work of Christ for us, and the subjective work of Christ in us, is further brought out by a better translation of 2nd Corinthians v chapter, 11th verse - M e thus judge that one died for all, there fore all died The old version has it, "If one died for all then were all dead, making the death of Christ the proof of the spiritual death of the natural man In point of fact there is not a word here about the death of nature The point is that there is such a union between Christ and the believer repre sented ideally in baptism, and realised by faith that if Christ died to am then all died with Him The practical conclusion follows If we be dead in Christ ideally, let us take care that really and inwardly we ' no longer live to ourselves but to Him that died for us The same thought is emphasised mlituB, chop in v 0 though here unfor I tunately, the better rendering is put into the margin The thought of the apostle is that a salvation does not originate in acts of ou a ' whether emotional or practical, but only in the mercy of God What then did nia mercy do for us ' He gave us the layer of regeneration and renewing of the Holy Ghost, the outward ordinance of baptism to assure the gift the inward renewing of the spirit to convert that assurance into a reality It it almost more wonderful to find "favor in the margin than it was to find Gehenna there Loutron cannotmeanthe act of w asking but the vessel in which the washing is done. It is translated later by Bishop Ellicott, the chairman of the Revision Committee, in his new version of the Epistles and bo by nearly all modern i Scholars I suppose it was difficult to feet a ' two thirds majority for its insertion in the | text owing to the significant fact that this is the only text in the New Testament, in which the word ' regeneration is applied to an individual It is certainly startling to find that on the only occasion of its occurrence it clearly refers to baptism But there need be no wonder It is only in accordance with the prevailing objective cast of New Testament language, and it dearly means that baptism is that laver which ideally represents the new birth in which the new life in Christ must begin It is important to keep in mind this objective view of salvation that every thing necessary to our salvation the life of Christ the gift of the spirit whose office it is to distribute that life and the ordinances of the church, through which as through appointed channels that attribution takes place-that all these are provided for us by the love of God independently of our faith not only before we believe but even before we live This is the peculiarity of Christianity Anyone can believe e a Pagan or a Mahommedan not less than a Christian The difference is revealed when you ask, What shall I believe and Why shall I believe ' Here the Gospel presents to your inquiry a new thing-a gift and possibilities unknown in the world before This newness and uniqueness of the Gospel is well suggested by a better translation of Romans, 3rd chapter, 21st verse, " But now a righteousness of God hath been manifested, not " the righteousness, as though it were a thing already well known, but a righteousness apart from thelawwTiicblproceed to describe the righteousness of God through faith in Christ I have spoken of the connexion of faith with grace, with what went before faith This leads me next to speak of the connexion between faith and its fruits, between it and what should follow it This is made clearer by a better translation of Galatians, 2nd chapter, 16th verse The old version was, " A man is not justified by works but by faith, thus excluding works altogether from connexion with justification The new version more correctly renders " A man is not justified by works save through faith except so far as works are necessary to indicate the reality of faith You will see at once that the celebrated opposition in this matter between St Paul and St James is already abolished by this rendering But in fact it is made yet more impossible a better render- ing of James, 2nd chapter, 14th verse We read no longer "Can faith savouring as if faith had nothing to do with the matter, but can that faith Bav e him such a faith as that, which can only make him tremble without obeying St Paul is thus plainly seen to say, Works cannot save except through faith, and St. James to say, " Faith cannot say except it be a fruitful in the Suppose however, that a man has taken the life of Christ by a real faith, a faith which vindicates its reality by works Andtber question may here arise-Can the man who has I once possessed such faith ever lose it, or must he keep St because of God's predestination The new version helps us to give a better answer to this question also, it translates Luke x 0, "If a son' of peace there "-not " if the son of peace be there The latter expression would imply that the Apostles should remain, if the son of God had done before them and selected the house. The former means if your best" be a sort of peace, who will receive you, remain Again the new version translates Acts ii, 47 not"suchasshould behaved bytheelectionoí God, but such as were being saved through their own faithful use of God s grace. Again it translates, 1 Corinthians 4 18, To them that are perishing' foolishness, to them that are being saved the power of God " When this passage stood to them that perish, the Gospel is foolishness, it might; mean that, the Gospel appeared foolish to them because they were destined to perdition. But now it can have no such meaning, Those who are perishing through their own wilful disobedience need not finally perish- nor, on the other hand, can it be said that those who are " being saved must be ultimately saved "Once in grace, always in grace," is now shown to be an unscriptural sentiments I need make no remark on the effect of the new version in modifying the doctrine of Oac Lord's divinity, because it leaves that does thine untouched I or if it omits the passage 1 John v. 8, containing a reference to the three heavenly witnesses and adopts the reading, "Ho who, instead of God ml The 11, 10, on the other hand it translates Titna 11, 12-hour Great God and Saviour Jesus Christ and strengthens the affirmation of Philip, 11 C, 7, by a better and more intense Bible reading The new version very decidedly accentuates the value of the spiritual element in religion by two improved translations In Mark v 19, we read, not " purge ing all meats, which may mean almost anything, but this He said making all meats clean It is difficult for us to conceive the vastness of the spiritual revolution implied in these words At a time when the great schools of Killed and Shatnmai were busy putting about the relative importance of bearing the day first or the meat first, Jesus stands up and cries, "All these things are thought, you are children of God, and to such all meats are clean to the Phaneeo of that day the utterance of such a sentiment would be as though the heavens had fallen. It deprived him not only of the chief subjects of his mental activity, but of all the cherished reasons for his national and spiritual pride. It made Calvary inevitable The same paramount authority of the spiritual in religion is implied by that depreciation of asceticism. which is brought out be clearly by a better translation of Colossians 3 23, "But are not of any value against the indulgence of the flesh ' Here, instead of- an utterly unmeaning phrase, we get an un- compromising denunciation of mere outward acts of mortification as a medicine for the soul-in this age, a great and distinct gain. Indirectly, too, spiritual religion is relieved of a burden and a difficulty by the omission; of John v 3rd verse This was a description of a miracle taking place regularly, as if by a law of nature, and without any reference to the spiritual condition of the healed These characteristics put it entirely out of harmony with the New Testament miracles, which are exceptional acts of power rendered credible even more by their adapta- tion to a great spiritual purpose than by the character and mission of those who wrought them It is no little relief then, to find that the passage which recorded a miracle of be different a character is nothing better than a late interpolation I will just notice in conclusion that the new version alters certain texts which have formed the favourite Sheriffs of one-sided preachers. It robs one sect of its name The " peculiar people ' have gone out of the New Testament. If they want to continue to be scriptural they must call themselves now "The people of God's own possession, for be in the new version 1 Peter ii 9, is now translated Perhaps even to " peculiar people, it might savour too much of arrogance to style themselves as opposed to all other Christians "The people of God's own possession " But I Scarcely know If people are only ignorant and stupid enough, no arrogance appears impossible to them. The new version omits a text on which a vast number of excited sermons have been preached, Acts [vi 37, "If thou believes with all thine heart thou mayest" (be baptized) Again it rev cases the meaning of Acts xxvi 28th verse In the old version Agrippa seems to say, "Thy sermon to be convincing that almost it persuades me to be a Christian, ' whereas in the new version he is made to say what he was more likely to say, and what he actually said, " Do you imagine that with so slight an effort is this you can make a Christian of such a. man as I am' I daresay that many preachers will be disappointed at the loss of a favourite text, but for my part, I think the subject presented by the new version, M7, the hardening power of am and the curse of worldly pride, not only far more interesting, but also far more useful Lastly, I may observe that preachers who are always insisting on the necessity of conversion, and are wont at the same time to assign to conversion a peculiar and utterly my throat meaning, will experience, perhaps, some little dismay to find their pet word entirely excluded from the Gospels It remains only in Acts xv. 3, and James v. 19, and ought not to have been left in either place. But it is hard for a committee to be consistent The word formerly translated " convert ' means simply " turn, or " turn again and refers sometimes to turning the body, and sometimes to turn- ing the mind, sometimes to turning from evil to good, and sometimes to turning from good to evil in the circumstances there was no alternative but to translate it by a word that would express its large and comprehensive meaning And nothing but good can result from the change People will see now that where the word refers to a desirable spiritual chance it merely describes n turning of the mind whether that turning be made suddenly or gradually, whether with ecstatic phenomena or without them. No doubt this turning is sometimes attended by such phenomena, and is as sudden if not as complete as a turning of the body. But it is by no means always so And if one may be permitted to judge who himself experienced a sudden and ecstatic change it by no means follows that such a form of change has the most sanctifying influence on the character Our Lord said, Except ye turn and become as little children, ye shall 111 now late enter into the kingdom of heaven ' (Matthew 18th chapter 3rd verse). Here the thing to be done is to turn the mind from the proud wilfulness of what is called "manly independence to a childlike, dependence on God And I may be permitted to repeat that I have sometimes seen this spiritual change more completely effected, where the turning was gradual and silent, turn where it was Sudden and ecstatic I have now finished my task, and it is natural for you to ask what is the result of all this Just what I told you at first - The net result is a decided drift, a tendency to obliterate some of the sterner features of the old translations There is a fuller statement of the spirituality of our holy faith of the universality of theWoofGod and of the long suffering grace which will condemn none till his moral probation is fairly completed There is besides a clearer e hibition of the symbolic character of those passages which describe the nature of future punishment, and the uncertainty of many of the expressions which do Bcnbe its duration And these alterations are not made capriciously They are not made in obedience to any critical theory -they are not due to any effort to adapt the text either to the supposed historical notes Bibles of the fast century, or to the beliefs and speculations of the nineteenth century If any change has been made in the text it is on the authority of more ancient and valuable manuscripts and version And though I admit that the new translation sometimes mars the delicate balance and harmony of the matchless English of the old version, as in lat Corinthians, chap 13, yet it does this only from an anxious desire to render more exactly the meaning of the original This being the case it is surely very interesting to notice, that the drift of change observable in the new translation is in the same direction as the drift of all healthy change in modern thought in that direction which is indicated in the well known words of St John -" Perfect love eaten out fear, because fear hath tor ment I draw an augury of the brightest hope from this fact It proves to me at least that the general drift of modern thought is healthy and truthful. May we not, then, humbly hope that if men will only be Sincere and patient, scientists on the one side, and theologians on the other, enlarging knowledge will bring us not a diminution, but on increase of faith-a faith it may be of a different tone and temper, but which is made all the more confident and assures quite as much by what it loses 03 by what it gains The finest pulpit 111 England is said to be one recently erected in St A Nicholas a Church, Great Yarmouth The basis of the structure is an oblong platform Hitler length, and this has now been surrounded by masses of beautiful carving and wood sculpture, illustrating the idea of the text, "Built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets " There are no fewer than 15 statues on it, representing various prophets of the old law, as well as the four evangelists and St. Peter and Paul These statues, as well as the main portion of the work, are executed in oak, whilst there are five beautifully carved panel subjects in walnut woo.
