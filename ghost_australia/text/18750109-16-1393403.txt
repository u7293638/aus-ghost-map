Money is talk, done up in ' tens ' and ' twenties I' take the talk out of it, and it's nothing." Thus, one way and another, we whiled away the journey back to town, where I left William, and proceeded about my business, far away from the high altitudes and stry Valleys of Nevada. Homo months later I returned, to find the town in one of those mining fevers which invariably . follow the discovery of rich silver ores. Picking up the lively little daily newspaper from the clerk's counter at the hotel where I stopped, and glancing over it, my eyes fell upon the following : "Hick Sticks: in Tin: Servian Circulars t Wires, ropes, spangles, Necks, and cases of silver 1 Chloride ores by tons and tons, all through the mine, with rich sulphurets at the water level. " Nothing, except an ownership in the property could give us more satisfaction than we now enjoy in chronicling the grand success? which has crowned with a gorgeous silver crown their long- and tedious labors of the council Brothers stock sale. " By invitation of Mr. George llocksaw wo- -' stepped into his buggy on Saturday last, and ?'," after a pleasant drive of two days, and a still?' , climb up the side of I'rotighorn Mountain, we were permitted to descend into the mine. Is ? that descent of the main shaft, and for a hundred ' feet along the main drift there is nothing worth mentioning ; but at the end of this hundred feet there' opens a scene more gorgeous than the dream of the Count de Monte Christo. All along the drift, overhead, under foot, and upon the hanging wall, for a distance of 100 feet, tim precious wealth of wattle glitters in the lamplight gloating o'er.' Below this drift, on the lower level, a distance in perpendicular depth off . fifty feet, and in the mountains over 100 feet, there is even a richer picture. The mine is not describable, except by exclamations. It is; magnificent I ] " The mine is patented under the broad seal of Uncle Sum, to George. hacksaw and Andrew Hocksaiv, their heirs and assigns, to have and to hold for over." So Bill was mistaken, after all, about that mine and the Jacksons.
