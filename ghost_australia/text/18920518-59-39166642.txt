Friday. May i^. An entertainment and coffee supper was held in the Mount Bryan East Bible Christian Chapel on Wednesday evening last in aid of the church debt. Great credit is due to Messrs. Wilkins and Scoit for tbe manner in which they worked to get up such a creditable pro gramme to place before ibeir patrons, and they must feel greatly pleased at the reception that gÂ»eeted each performer as they made their appearance. Miss Yeoman played an overture very nicely; Mr. Hyatt sang ' Plckaboo' which was well received; Mr. Beal followed with a comic song which caused a good deal of laughter ; Mr. Wilkins then recited that Stirling piece 'Heaved up,' which was re ceived with applause ; Mr. Beal then caused considerable amusement by entertaining the audience with another comic song ; Master Thomas followed with a fife solo, which was given with great credit for a lad so young ; Miss Penglase sang ' The song that reached my heart' very sweetly ; tbe Misses Williams were weli received in their duet ; Mr. Scott then recited a ' Ghost story' ; Miss Yeoman Sang tbe 'Gypsy's warning' with good effect; Miss Williams and company winding up the first part of the programme with a filee. The entertainment concluded with the laughable drama 'Cherry Bounce,' and caused a good deal of amusement. Messrs. Bald, Dennis, Beal, Hyatt, Mrs. Lucas and Master Penglase tak ing the different characters and acting the part very well. A good muster sat down to supper and did ample justice to the good things placed before them, and by the happy appearance and good will of all everyone enjoyed themselves. A hearty vote of thanks iva-- tendered to Messrs. Wilkins and Scotl also the friends from Hallett, Mount Bryan, and Burra who took part, and I think each one thoroughly deserved it. Tbe entertainment and supper was a real success financially and otherwise.
