A GHOST WITHOUT A CHEQUE BOOK. It is a relief to turn from a story of horror like this to a ghost which showed itself possessed of reasonable intelligence if not a sense of humor. Glamis Castle, the residence of Lord and Lady Strath noi-e, is, as everyone knows, notorio'is as the scene of the terrible events in 'Macbeth' â€” and of course Glamis has its ghost. When Dr. Boyd was staying there he, like all visitors to the Castle, heard a areat deal about the haunted room. It had baen put about that the mention of it was a painful subject in the family. Never waa ranker nonsense. In the morning the firs^ thing the countess said to her guests was, 'Well, have you seen the g'nost?' The carl treated the subject in a fashion yielding practical counsel. He told how some years Defore an excellent digni tary had just gone to bed when of a sudden the ghost appeared. With great presence of mind the clergyman took the first word. Addressing the ghost, he said he was most anxious to raise money for a church he was erecting; that he had a bad cold and could not well get out of bed; but that his collecting-book was on the dressing-table, and he would be ex tremely obliged if the visitor would give him a subscription. Upon this the ghost vanished and has never returned.
