The Customs returns published this ?week can scarcely be said to have taken the public by surprise Everyone is aware that the year 1879 was a bad year for business, ana what the figures do is to tell what a very bad year it was bad almost beyond the current assump tion The imports are lower than for any year since 1872 , the exports have never fallen BO low since 1854, when the popu lation was only 312,000 instead of 900,000, asnow Thephrase "hardtimes" is indeed written across the face of the return, and we can only hope that when the present year comes to an end a very different tale will have to be told The total imports for three years aro as follows - 1877 £16 3G2 301 1878 16 161 880 1879 IJ 035,538 And if the return is studied m detail, it will be seen that while clothing suffers the most, the decline is pretty well spread over the long list of items Something must be put down to the fall of values in Great Britain, which allowed more goods to be sent for tho same money, but it is notorious that orders were largely curtailed in Melbourne during 1878 and 1879, because mer cantile firms found that they could not work off their stores Capital went away from us Employment and money became scarce, and consumption was checked, and on the top of a political shock and bad seasons carno new and injudicious taxation at the customs We have a class amongst us who affect to rejoice in a decrease of imports, and treat the incident as a sign of prosperity, but no one, wo apprehend, will look with favoui upon the decrease in our exports The productive power of the colony appears during 1879 to have immensely fallen off, the export returns for three years being as follow - 1S7C £15 157 687 1877 14 92o,707 1878 12 451170 Wool held its ground pretty well We I shipped wool to the value of <£5,2G9,000, or a falling off of half a million of money as compared with 1878, and of £1,150,000 as compared with 1876 We must wait for more detailed mfor mation before saymg whether produe tion was lessened m Victoria, or whether the reduction is consequent upon the di version of trade from central Austtalia, and it may prove that both causes are at w ork On the ono hand the sister colonies aro energetic in their efforts to secure the traffic to and from inland Australia, and on the other tho selectors, who havo taken up land in Victoria at the rate of over one million of acres per annum, are apt to allow a part of their area to re mam unused, neither tilled nor grazed ovei To put the land under the plough is impossible, and frequently the farmer has not capital wherewith to buy stock, and unproductiveness of this character necessarily shows itself in tho îeturns The fall in gold is very heavy, representing, as compared with 1878, a decrease of £1,318,000, while the miscellaneous industries show a decline of £070,000 In 1878 our total trade, linpoit and export, amounted to £35 10s per head of the population, and that wag a great falling off from previous years , but m 1879 we had to submit to a reduction to £30 10a per head And to show how far wo have fallen behind the other colonies, wo may tabulate the returns for New South Wales and South Austialia with our own - Exports per lToad of Population South Australia (1878) £22 0 3 New oouth \\\ alea (1878) 19 2 5 Victoria (1879) 13 10 0 And so it is with the imports Imports per Head South Australia (1878) £23 10 3 New South Walea (1878) 21 15 8 Victoria (1879) 10 14 0 The other colonies may havo fallen off somewhat during 1879, and to that extent the comparison will be inexact, but nevertheless it shows the gi eat gulf we have placed between our selves and our neighbours Victoria is admittedly tho most favoured of the colonies in soil and climate and miner ii resources, but with these fyuros staring lum in tho face, no impartial critic will allow that she can have done justice lo heiself 01 LS doing justice The rovenuo returns aro of course afiected by the sanio causes of bad go vernment and hard times that have affected the imports Despite the duties piled on during the j car, tho îeceipts for 1879 were less by ¿G0.000 than w13 the case in 1878 If wo go a littlo further back tho comparison is as follows - Customs Revenue 187C £1 803 3X1 1879 1 510 8U We shall only stop on this occasion to point out that the tobacco revenue continues to fall, and this, though there is every reason to believe that the consumption of tobacco m creases The diop from 1878 to 1879 was £12,000, the figures being respec tively £100,226 and £88,197, and this process of gradual extinction has been going on for many years past The cause is not far to seek, and consista in lie lack of an excise duty Every year more and more Victorian grown tobacco s used in the manufactories, and under our fiscal arrangements the payment of duty is evaded If protection is the necessity, it would bo quite possible to continue the present advantage-an ad vantage enjoyed almost wholly by the Chinese of the Murray flats-and yet to carry out the state policy of taxing the article of luxury The views of Mr SERMCE are well known, and Mr FRANCIS made a gallant effort to effect a change last year, and now that these gentlemen are in office we shall hope that this hole in the cask will bo stopped once for all Mr BERRY was urged last year even by protectionists to take action of some kind The heaviest falling off occurs under the head of transhipments The trans actions amounted to £3,318,000 m 1878, to £1,914,884 m 1Ç7<}, but here the figures m_y occasion undue alarm, Tia 1>»H: 0[ tll0 decrease is due to the circumstance that the ocean steamers now run direct to Sydney, and convey from there the gold and com which formerly used to be sent hero for transmission, and which consequently appeared in our returns Exports for drawbacks, however, show a decrease ot £80,000 for the year, and m these, as in other incidents, we perceive the con tinued falling away of the intercolonial trade Taking the return as a whole, we may say that it is one with which no statesman ought to rest satisfied It shows that Victoria is sick Her pro ducing power and her consuming power have suffered and aro suflenng, and it must be apparent to all that to restore tone to the system, lehef ought to be given, and the great natural industries of the colony allowed fair play The example set by the Mayor of Melbourne m offering a handsome pecuniary reward for the best essay on a subject of great public importance ia one that might find imitators amongst our wealthy men with credit to 111 dividuals and advantage to the state We t enture to predict that the premium which his worship has announced foi the most valuable suggestions relating to tlia underground drainage of Melbourne will do more to distinguish his year of oflice in the minds of thinking men, than could ha\e been accomplished by ten times the usual quantity of civic feasting, 01 a whole wilderness of fancy dress balla We feel sure that the citizens will ap precíate the practical and generous public spirit displayed by their chief magistrate, and feel proud to think that they have indirectly been the means of bestowing honours on one who is capable of weanng them worthily, by remembering the responsibilities they entail The notification of Ins worship's 111 tention was submitted in a printed form to the City Council at its last meeting, accompanied by a " memorandum for " competitors " drawn up by the town clerk, and dealing with details Both these documents appeared in our issue of Tuesday last The former sets forth that the prize essay must be " lllus " trated by plans, diagrams, approxi " mate estimates, and other necessaiy " particulars "-the essay to become the property of the mayor, the accom panymg papers to bo returned to the author The scheme must contain pro visions for carrying off soakage from the " foundations, basements, and cellars of " buildings, street gutter water, com " prising house slops and other refuse " fluids, the waste and foul water from " manufactories, and ordinary storm " w iter ' All this sewage must be dealt with, and disposed of in an inoffensive and advantageous manner-in a way which would lead to tho purification of the \ arra and the bay, and put a stop to that process of " silting up ' which at piesent is a source of continual annoy ance and never ending outlay The essay is also to fuinish suggastions foi improvements in the method now adopted 111 dealing with the night soil of the city W ith regal d to house drainage, wo find some particulars of a somewhat puzzling nature m the town clerks memorandum already alluded to In clause 8 we find the following re marks - \\\ ith regard to No 2 of the foregoing hat of evils tobe remedied viz. the foulness of tho street Rutters it is thought desirable for the preclusion, of sewer gas from houses and of privy excreta from the drains that house slops and refuse water should as now bo discharted into the street gutters winch should be kept free from offensiv enesa 1 f the frequency of the gratings giving inlet to tho main drains and that the only drains con necting houses with the main drains should be those from cellars or basements and restricted to the carrjing of soakago water only Now, it appears tous that if the base ments of houses aro to bo effectually diained, such a communication must be "stablished between the tenoinents and the street tunnels as would, in tho absence of proper traps, render the dwellings liable to be flooded with sewor gas from cellar to attic Sewer gis could not be kept out of houses by merely discharging "slops and refuse "water" into the open channels it any connexion wore to be set up between the houses and the drains Without a connexion the withdrawal of the soakage alluded. to could not, of course, bo effected « 0 do not see what relation one thing has to the other Neither could oxcreta be I ept out of the drains by Bundar means Wo may postúlalo that to drain foundations a conduit of some sort must bo maintained between the houses and the tunnols, and tdVt icvvei gas must bo excluded from the foi mer by the usual neans If this is admitted, then it is evident that the means of passing anything into tho sewers would exist, and as the use to w Inch the channel shoull be put could only be regulated by bj o law, what would bo g. '¡led by compelling house holders to pour a quantity of liquid filth ii to ihe open streets 1 Weare told that the stieet gutters thus charged with nastines3 could " bo kept free from offensivoness " by the frequency of the gratings giving " inlet to the main drains " This is a somewhat remarkable discovery, for as long as the spaces between the various inlets were kept supplied with " slons " from the houses facing them, the only difference between the old and new systems would be one of volume As a shallow stream can give off as offensive an effluvium as a deep one, we fail to see what great impiovemcnt could be effected, on Mr TIT/GIBBON'S plan, in the smell of our citj We may, however, draw comfort from the thought that-as he himself saj s in his opening paragraph Hie object of this memorandum is to m tlicato tho matters moBt urgently needing attention and to suggest some qualification of the manner of dealing with them in one or two particulars, but it is not intended to bind the judgment or limit tho fertility of resource of competitors Such being the case, we would strongly îccommend intending competitors to put the memorandum behind the fire before setting to work, and to trust entirely to the clear and concise specification of what is îequired contained in his worship's notification It is to be regietted that it w zm possible to throw the competition open to English as well as to colonial ?engineers Wonders have been worked of late years in the mother country m the way of draining towns and utilising the sewage, during the accomplishment of which much valuable experience has been gained The absence, however, of anj complete survey of the Metropolitan district, showinglevelsandothernecessary paiticulars, renders it impossible for professional men at a distance to give us the benefit of their matured views That such a survey does not exist is a re proach and a disgrace to the Govern ment of the country, which became charged by act of Parliament, on the dissolution of the old Water and Seweiage Commission, with the duty of providmg for the proper drain age of the capital Ministry aftei Ministry announces its intention of stiel ing to the profitable water supply like a limpet to a rock, while it per sistently disregards the accompanying oblig ltiOD Nothing practical, we feel assuied, will ever bo done m the matter until a comprehensive metropolitan board of v\ orks, representing all the interests involved, shall have been constituted Attention to this pressing require ment cannot now be long withheld, and «-hould the present Government, or its immediate successor, awake to the dutv it owes to about one fourth of the entire population of the colony, we shall have to thank Mr MEARIS, whose tpiritcd oflei cannot fail to attract r ublic interest and beget a wholesome impatience of further delay Tho promoters of tho Orient line are to bo congratulated upon tho success v Inch has attended their development of Hie Australian trade Tho annual moot in=cf tile company waa hold in London this v eek, and, os wo learn by telegram, a dividend of 5 per cent waa declared, and 0 per cent was earned to tho reserve fund the figures showing a total profit of 11 pet cent on the oporations of the year ^o encouraged aro tho directors by these lesults that they proposo to inoreaso the capit ii of tho company to £1,000,000, and v o m ty pieBiime, therefore, that then in tcntiun is to build new vessels of the s a One) / typo, and continue their fortnightly seivice The company has m fact effected aiovolution in the Australian trade by its bold policy of using tho Suez Canal on the homeward route, and of utilising the titree i orts of Adelaido, Holbourne, and Sydnev matead of making any one of them its solo place of call Whatever sood fortuno the company meeta with has been deserved, and every Austra han will tom in wishing the line prospci ity m the future Returning to our seh es however, wo may point out that the repoit placea m a supremely ridiculoua 1 osition tho persona who week after woek clamour foi a aubsidy for tho Onont lino If tho company ia doing its work mag inficently 'f it is prepared to put still moro Bpirit and capital into the enter puse if its shareholder aro earning heavy dividends, why should wo intoi feio ?

And it oxliibits a fooling of complacency at tho magnitude of the sums publicly and privately disbursed upon reputedly bonovolont objects in a community, whon it really ought to take »hamo to itself that there should exist so great a demand for oleomoBynary aid As Dr JAMIFSON observes with îe spect to our hospitals -" It seems to bo " an inevitable result of the ontranco of " the governing bodies
