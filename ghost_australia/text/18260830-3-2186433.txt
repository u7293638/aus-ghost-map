Poetry. FROM BLACKWOOD's MAGAZINE OF MARCH LAST. THE SAINT AND THE DEMON. SAINT. How sweet is the state of the blessed in heaven, Where their spirits are cleansed, and their sins are forgiven; And the thoughts and the cares of this being are driven From their bosoms for ever and ever!— DEMON. How dismal and dreary are Tophet's grim caves! And how wild are the screams of the suffering slaves, While Eternity's pendulum over them waves, And repeats in their ears,—Never, never!— SAINT. The beatified spirits and angels of light, With palms in their hands, and with robes shining bright, Sit around the high throne of their God, day and night, Singing hymns to the Holy Eternal.— DEMON. The ghosts of the cursed, in the place of despair, With goblins and devils their dwelling must share; While the Evil One revels in cruelty there, 'Midst weeping and wailing infernal!— SAINT. With loud hallelujahs our mansions resound, When a spirit comes up from the earth's mortal ground; And with garlands of glory that spirit is crown'd, When he enters the heavenly regions. DEMON. With gnashing of teeth, and one general yell, That echoes around the wild caverns of hell, We salute the poor wretch who is sentenced to dwell With the rest of our terrible legions!— SAINT. The tomb of the just is a beautiful urn, Where his canonized bones to their nature return; And pilgrims come far to admire and to mourn. Till they, too, shall reach the blest havens. DEMON. The grave of the wicked is quickly forgot, Or remember'd, that good men may shun the dread spot; While, unwept and unprayed for, his body may rot Like a carcass that's cast to the ravens!—
