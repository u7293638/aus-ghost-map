GHOSTS AT THE W?HITE HOUSE. \------- WeNaeon CASTLE having been deolared to be Oaunted, it is almost a natural scquence that the White House at Washington should also have its ghost or ghosts. The principal lnare of abode of the spectre is said to be in the attic, where strange noises are fre quently heard. The Eceptics naturally said, "Ruts !"--nith a double meaning-but an old servant who recently went to the attic alter dark elstates that a shadow advancod towards him, which gradually tool: the shape of a man and motioned him to leave. There is also a ceaseless tramp of many feet to be heard at night, but the policemen on duty have become so accustomed to these myEtori ous footfalls that no notice is taken tof them. Oddly enough, however, the ghoutly revel lers steer clear of the Presidential family, who have not been disturbed by any strange apparitions.
