ENTERTAIN MENTS. THE THEATRES, *e. * Gir» ne Imw Toipwt my mW- Smmwawt There are three Richard the Thirds, the 1 traditional Richard of history, such as we ' have him in Shakspeare, the conventional stage Richard of CSbberian odgia, and the 1 true Richard sa we know him to have ex isted. The Cibberian melodramatic Bichard is by far the most familiar to your average , play-goer, 'and the tree Bichaid hasonly recently begun to be known. Strictly epeak ing, therefore, there ate but two Richards from which an actor may choose hiB modd, inasmuch as Shakspeare, who, though a great poet, was ueverthelessa tune-server, adopted the prejudices erf his age, and depicted the man whom his Sovereign's grandsire slew, as a monster of iniquity and baseness. Until comparatively recently, this has been the stage Richard. He has been represented as a villain so bad that he could noteven con ceive a good action, and, therefore, to do one has-been considered quite out of his ieach. Acton have thus punted him all shadow, and even in the passages in tended to exhibit the less hlood- ftiirety side of his character, they havemade him so grim and repnlsire that the Lady Annehas always seemed little short of an idiot to bdmtfred by l^s. uncouth flatteries. The argimedt has bees, tfra t Sbakspears, having madeRIchard a detestable scoundrel, there was'iio option lint to represent him as one; qnd aa the Gibberian adaptation presented him . in .fin aspect' somewhat more varied than in the legitimate version, the CSbbeiian version vras, naturally enough, preened., But critics hare betotolersbly mmidmous In e^bblt with both the text and tbe character. tTheycculd niot «ee why a iast- oentury adaptershould ? have more poosideration shown.biin thaa one would at this day.

" Mac or " Othello," hewould be cat in pieces rat mercy or xemoneand critics.have natnrally enough inquired; who Is Gibber, forsooth, that he should be more con* siHerately dealt with? The wish, there-' fctre, .has. always been felt, if' not a!-' wptye expressed, that Shakspeare's unspoilt ''Jttchard UL" should be restored to the stage.. It was, however, confessed jto ibe; im possible to p.ve the unabridged play without "fcuts."

The scenic arrange meats in the fifth act, however, sure deserving of much commendation,' e.g., the two meadow scenes, one being supposed to represent Bosworth field, with an old church in the distance, and the other an agreeable picture representing presumably "A plain near Tam worth," of English appearance as to its foreground, bat somewhat Australian in its distance. The tent scene is in faithful accordance with the text,, and the appearance of night is very well given. The ghosts are made to rise all at once, and they are not so numerous as the text describes them. But they are quite numerous enough to alarm any average man, and the general effect is tolerably good. Tbe work of reduction necessary to fit the play for representation can hardly have been a very difficult .one, and I cannot, therefore, see the necessity for the announcement by the management that they have had the invaluable assistance of Mr. Phelps's mAed prompt book. All that Mr. Phelps appe&TB; to have done has been tosborten some of the long passages, altogether to exclude others, and somewhat to modify the arrangement of j the acts; the first act being made to end with the third scene instead of the fourth; the second act beginning with thefOurth of the first and terminating with the second soene of the second act. The third act, by dint of ex tensive excisions, is brought to a close at the ! legitimate place, and the last two act* are 1 included within compass by. the same means. But there is no interpolation, no tnotposi- \ tbn, so dragging in of passages from otter plays, and none of the characters are excised, ( thus giving opportunity for bringuig in not i only the whole of the regular company, but. necessitating the engagement of some addi tional members. Iam not clear, however, that | the general effectiveness of the representa tion has not been inversely to the number of the cast Moreover, there has been no general | attempt to make the costumes accord with the fashion of the period. Such a revival as the management is desirous this should be con sidered, Onght surely to have "been distin guished by attention to this particular. The brat-played part in this revival is, pin* doubted ly, tie Richmond of Mr. Harwood. It is correct, unexaggerated, and excellent1 as to the declamation. But then Mr. Har wood is always correct and very often excel lent I cannot tell, indeed, why he didnet < play Richard; he would have played it far moie satisfactorily than Mr. Stark. Did the " enormous mental labour" alarm him? There is a good deal to learn in such a part,, looking at it only as an exercise of memory. No doubtMr. Harwood is tolerably well oc cupied with his duties as manager, and' does. notcare to undertake newparts. Botifhehad cast himself for Richard, he \votild have pleased the audience better than Mr. Stsife. Mr. Start; to be sure, takes dreadful pains, bntunfortunatelytberesulte of his pains are as | dreadful as the pains themselves. .2 cannot tell in what his "enormous amonnt of mental labour" has consisted, and J «inoierely : hope he has not seriou&y; hurt himself by the effort; -but I could not' help HritiVing about' the old " monies parturimf' prtyrerliv* j when the play was over.

Some day, probably, a real revival of the Shak sperian "Bichard III." will take place; meantime, managers will go back to Gibber, and "so much for Buckingham." At the Duke of Edinburgh last Saturday night there was an overflow. The house was of the kind it makes a manager happy to see, and Mr. Roberts was happy accordingly. There was what is technically described as a " great bilL" A comedy with Mr. Mont gomery in it, and tjie drama of " Black Sheep afterwards, offered foil value for the money. "Lavater, or Not a Bad Judge," is one o! those plays which, when they oome to an end, leave you disappointed there is no more 01 them, and Mr. Montgomery's acting in tbis is of the kind that pleasantly haunts you long after you have witnessed it Wotkld there were more of euch plays and mow each actors. Mrs. Steele, I take it, is now so firmly established as a fttvourite, that she Is to be considered a permanent institution of the stage. And yet, admirable as has been her acting in the part of Harriet Routh, I believe she is capable of still higher flights. Mr. Montgomery has gone to Baechworth and other places for a month. . When he returnB he will again appear at the Duke of Edinburgh, and then he will go to Tasmania. Meantime there is novelty in store; for Mr. Bellair, the Melbourne agent of Mr. Robert" son, has ^placed at Mr. Roberts's dapbsal Beveral of that gentleman's comed&sT;'of which/"Gaisten has served to shorf ho*r admirably they are written. " David Ggrrick" is one of these, and Mr. Mont gomery is (o appear in the part originally played by Mr. Sonera, Mr. IutsselTs drama of " Fra Angelo" is also to be produced, and. though the London critics'condemned this play, there is < reason to, believe that, if efficientlycast, it is likely to be a considerable success. The afterpiece on Monday and three fallow ing nights has been the farce, ad&pted; from the Fiencbof "Jesoistnon fils," .«{ "The Two Puddifoots," produced in London a year ago. It Is one of that somewhat too numerous class of pieces which defy all probability, and' which, frithont being as picturesque as burlesques, are quite as far removed from any semblaince ol reality as they arc. They belong, towhatm&y; be called the If branch of the drama. It yoa can persuade' yourself that certain of Jhe, characters axe sufficiently fatuous not to see through the motives of some of the othfers who are equally fatuous, then youmay suppose that some of the events in the plot might happen. It is jnecesnty, however, to set out with so mu& supposing, that you feel you are dbing violence" to your common sense long before 4h« frlay oomes to an end. In this bist&nce; a fathferpatfrn lim> .self off as his son for no jNurticuup .tepfgn that is discoverable, and a. mature'person wbo was shatp-wftted enough tor inske him marry her twelve ' years previously is understood to be deceived into thp belief that it ts the son, and not the father.
