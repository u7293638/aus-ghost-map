THE SINGLE FOOTSTEP. A GHOST STORY. TByL. H.F.1 Uhpsta! Is there a man in the. world, \- however sceptical — is there a woman on «arth, however strong-minded— ia there a «hild breathing, however well trained and nurtured, who does not in the inmost re ' cesses of his or her secret heart believe and dearly cherish the belief in ghosts ? Ghost . stories — more especially those which\grace -or ' pad' the - pages of periodicals as the '.. caseniaybe — are generally supposed by a too credulous, yet at .the same time m-r : credulous public, io be but the distorted dis? tiliings. of some fever-racked .mind, or else the ill- pajd emanations .of some :outat elbows pressman who* has fallen back on V^ ',,' childhoocfs fleeting hour' - i 'pr^ &n; £d.ea which liis beerrbemuddled; brain, is in ?capable of spontaneously creating. -' ^Cjhe -above ^supposition^ if a correct one,,,.w]buld do away with too, . many pWrestablished. customs* to be tolerated. 'for *^ven. ^single j moment, and I think f.may il&ke;*'it for granted . that ghosts are an hereditary mr stitution which is about as immutable as Parliaments and as much a matter of fact -as the revolution of the globe. Having given vent to the above few, but I trust : not inappropriate remarks, I shall now pro J ceed to relate a series of facts, which, In ' my humble opinion, will remove the veil of , -scepticism from the eyes of any hardened heathen. * ? ....??'''.: 'Going down North, old man?' said a. voice at 'the window of the smoking car^ riage ia which I had ensconced, myself^ anl which was attached to the 9.30 Limited Edinburgh Mail. I looked up from the 5 copy of the evening periodical I was jjeruslng, and recognised iny old friend and college chum, Jack Colenian. . ' Yes, old fellow,' I replied, after the porter had opened the door, and Jack, in company with a guncase, a carpet-bag, : -and a setter, had been shoved in. 'Yes; I'm going down to old Sir Malcolm Gordon's place to see what I can make of the grouse — jolly old place, I believe.' *( By Jove ! you don't say so ! I'm going there too,' was Jack's answer. ' What fun ! the girls are no end of stunning) and. the shooting isn't any ways dusty, they tell : -me.' s .''?: '?? .-- . :; ' ' - -l What sort of a place Is it ?' I enquired.

Jsuild, with coarse, fiery xed bushy hair and beard, and eyes which seemed to gleam with all the savageness of a hyena, coupled, -with the cunning of the tax, he^was a terror to all, and his very -name .would hush a crying child. Jt; was no wonder, - then, that he was unmarried. The iaiid of the neighboring clan of McRae was his vety opposite in every particular, being handsome in person - and chivalrous and lionarable almost to a fault. Herbert McRae had been married, but had lost his wife -within a year of -his marriage, she having died in giving birth to a daughter, who was at the date of my story some nineteen years old, and of surpassing loveliness. McRae lived with his daughter almost alone, and his small but devoted clan were scattered sparsely over a con siderable expanse of country. Roderick, if not absolutely at peace with the McEtaea, was at any rate on a footing no worse than that of armed neutrality. The reason for this most unusual forbearance on his part towards a clan which he could have cut up and dis persed, and whose lands he could have ap propriated with the greatest ease, was not far to find. He had fixed upon McSae's daughter Kate as his bride. He first of all tried fair measures in order to attain his end, but finding, as was hardly to be won* dered at, that Kate loathed the sight of him and scorned his odious attentions, he determined upon taking rougher if more decisive measures, and for this purpose called agacheringof the clanin the very iiail in which -we are aiow sitting. As may be imagined, when such a, man as Roderick was chief, it took very little time to decide on the course to be pursued or the means : by which they were to carry oat their ab ject. The plan was simply to go to McRae's house and demand Kate, and should she be refused, then to take her.. No sooner ^said than done. Darkly and sileatly, like a panther - creeping on hi3 prey, did the Gordons, -with Roderick at their head, steaL down on the unsuspecting McRae. Arrived at the house, Roderick, as had already been arranged, stepped forward alone and knocked loudly on the door with the hilt of his claymore. McRae immedi ately opened it, and seeing who it was at once flung the door wide open and stood forth in the porch extending' M3 hand. ! 'I have come to ask you, McRae,' said Roderick, ' whether you still stick to your determination not to give me your daughter Kate in marriage ?' '? ' Mcst decidedly I do !' retorted McRae. 'And that is your final determination?' exclaimed Roderick. ' It is,' answered McRae. 'Then jouhave to learn that might is right, and that what you refuse to give the Gordons know well how to take. Clans men, advance 1' roared Roderick, - and striking the unguarded McRae a terrific blow on the mouth with his sword hilt, pie rushed into the house together with his followers and soon found and secured Kate and the few attendants vrho were inside. They ;±hen .bound McRae hand and- fob t, and returned to the Castle, taking their prisoners 3vith4:hem. On arriving at ? the castle Roderick summoned the .clan and ordered the priest to prepare to go through with the -Marriage. -This was done amid many a ribald joke and je^t at lhe bound McRae, -who icould only writhe iina His' bonds in. impotent , fury. But fibdericKs cruelty had only commenced ; and when once his temper was aroused or his mood. thwarted he was guilty of actsjat which even his rough followers shuddered. Commanding In a stern voice that the prisoners should be 'placed before him, he with -Jiis own hand stabbed all McRae's attendants abound as they were,! and then, as if the sight of thB blood;had ftnadden^d him, strode up and down the hallendeayor ing to invent some torture ^hich -should, be worthy of even his brutai-nature,rthat he could inflict on ihe powerless land, captive McRae. At length his eye paught sight |of two iron rings hanging from the wall, and he stopped in his hurried walk. Calling his two henchmen to him he proceeded to give them some orders in a lojw tone, and then took his seat ; at tie head, of the long oaken table opposite to the two rings. Ko sooner had he done $or (continued the old Dowager) than the henchmen, with two or three assistants, seized the unfortunate McRae a.nd bore him to the wall underneath the two ringls. They unbound his feet and fastened ^he right ankle in ;one of the rings, which wfs at such -a height from the ground as to: allow of the poor wre tcli nearly touching, the floor with his finger-tips, but not quite. Roderick then gave orders to be left alone with his victim, and when the. last of his followers had left the hall he took a jchai r, and seating himself clW to the, toutureU. McRae proceeded to taunt him, while, hie poured draughts of fi^ryjju?quebaugh^ jun mixed with water, down iue pjera tliroBJb. So deep ? did- his. potations become that at last Me head sank on his breast and he bent forward in a drunken eiujpor. . ..'. r | Arid what was the' position of the W fortunate McRae?

Then with a rapid circular stroke of his claymore he sent Roderick's sword.- flying from bis hand, and with a straight and true thrust pierced him through the breast. Roderick gave but one gasp and f elL forward dead ! The attendants having by this time heard the noise of the combat rushed into the hall, and seeing the fate of their laird, im mediately slew the brave McRae. Matters, however, did not end here. The occurrence which I have narrated took place on a Christmas Eve, and ever since that fearful night should a male Gordon be going to die during the ensuing year, a *' Single Step' is heard to walk thrice round this hall, and woe to him to whom the warning comes. The old Lady Gordou concluded the legend of her clan amid a deathlike silence, raising her thin hand, and pointing to the dial of the clock which marked the hour of Midnight. Sir Malcolm buwt out — 'Ha! ha! ha! very well told, indeed, mother. What a pity it is I can't quite believe it all ! I do believe it all but the ghost, and that — : — ' He was interrupted by a general ' hush!' from the assembled company, and truly enough through the open door at the; ex- treme end of the hall was heard a sound a.% of some one entering with » list slipper on one foot and a heavy boot on the other! No I there was no sound from one foot — it teas a single footstep ! Sir Malcolm turned deadly pale, and clutched the rails of his chair convulsively. Dowager Lady Gordon sat with eyes start ing out of her head, and the rest of those - present were 011 the tiptoe of expectation. The footstep went once completely round the hall — but nothing was visible. Twice did the unearthly sound proceed on its beat. At the third time the ' Single Footstep ' came, or seemed to come, close up to Sir Malcolm's chair. He fell forward in a fit ! We raised him up and carried him to bed, from which, however, he nerer rose, again, and the prophecy of the Dowager Lady Gordon was fulfilled. This may seem curious, but it is true. And will any one now venture to say that he doesn't believe in ghosts ?
