ENCROACHMENT ON THE PARK LANDS. TO THE EDITOR, Sir—I always said it would be BO—that as soon as I left this world they would encroach on the Park Lands—and I see they have begun already to do so, and close to the Cityroad this time. I thought I would like to know something about it, so I went up and listened to two tram boys talking about it. And one SAid to the other, "I say, Bill, ain't the Company awful good to put up this shed for us to get out ot the sun and wet?" "Dunno eo much about that," says Tom. " They's liberal on the cheap. They don't pay nothing for this ere land: and they puts us here to save running two-horse trams and save a conductor for eaoh tram also. So it strikes me, Bill, that's a good speck for them —not much goodness about it. £ think the papers shamed them in doing something for us poor covies." Says Bill, " I spose they are going to build a place up at Kermodestreet, too, for them chaps up there." " No fear," says Tom, "they wcula have to buy or rent land there: that wouldn't suit, you bet." Oh, dear me, the world seems no better since I left it; it is still easy enough to be generous at others expense. Now, Mr. Editor, if that shed remains after this warning from me I will haunt His Worship the Mayor and all the Aldermen and Councillors and the Town Cerk until it is, and if my old friend Samuel Tomkinson does not carry out the trust I lelt with him, and do hiB best to get it done, I will haunt him too, so they had all better look out. I am, Sir, &c..; DAVID GALL'S GHOST.
