ossian. . : . The ghost of Ossian has appeared at Crieff! But, after the manner of ghosts, it - si- made no revelation.. The farmer and his" man ' who were privileged to Bee the ghost v ; bad not even the courage of Hamlet to call on the' ghost to wait till they came- up toit. They fled to Crieff to tell their experiences -i ' to the wondering crowd. It was in the i' ' Sma' Glen, a favourite drive from Crieff - for the visitors to the hydropathic, that the- ghost appeared. The farmer and his man were with a flock of sheep, and when -near Ossian's grave they saw a dark shadow rina ; \ oat of the ground and spread itself out into - a cloud of smoke. And after that another - . dark shaft shot out of the ground with a 5; hissing sound, .and the brave men could «(. stand no more. .They fled at. their best speed : i to Crieff. What became of the sheep we. are ' not told, and it is only to be hoped that none r of them were missing after the terrible ?' apparition had rim its course. . . r .

Some people have been unkind enough o suggest that it was market night when the ghost of Ossian appeared, but it is well known that the ghost' of Ossian has- long since ceased to observe any distinction ;-- between a market night and any other, and, - besides, market nights are now periods " not of hilarity but of sober sadness for the Scotch, farmers.-
