nonEETSON SMITHS LECTURES ON THE BIBLE On the 3rd and June in the present year a kilogram appeared in our columns announcing that the General Assembly of the Free Church of Scotland by authority of 100 votes, had removed Professor W Hobart on Sunday from the chair of Oriental indignities and Old in lamont Genesis in the College of Aberdeen. The co troversy Indfeenof long duration, and the issue doubtful It seems as far b ich ns 1877, when the Professor 'had been t y years in his day, and had won, it the early age of thirty, a place in the front rank of living Biblical scholars An article of his in the new edition of (bo Jncylojidu» Maranoa appeared in that year and was denounced by some of his clerical brethren as heretical He met his accu ora before Uto Aberdeen Presbytery, and "-am in the General Assembly it Glasgow in 1871 His defence was successful, and he legume 1 his chair amid the acclamations of his admirers and the general satisfaction of the public Contemporaneously with his victory appeared another article from his post in the hnnjclopirdxa Lrilanmca, upon which his enemies returned to the charge. The professors writings were acceded to the test of the Westminster Confession and declared wanting by the majority mentioned in the telegram, a decision against which 117 Members of the General Assembly recorded their protest The lectures now pub called vere given by special reque I before Sarno and cultured audience at 1 Edinburgh and Glasgow prior to the termination of the trial first, for the purpose of letting 1 roo Church Presbiteriana know waterway they were asked to condemn and Ftronlh ascents (motion to the progress of sound biblical criticism. In his preface which is dated 1st April left to " luther va The current treatment of the OUT recitation ha produced a wide spread, uneasy suspicion that this history cannot heir to be tested like other ancient histories The old method of explaining difficulties, and reconciling apparent contrast! tions, would no longer be tolerated in dealing with other books and men in [themselves whether our Christian faith, the most pro in-, gift of truth which ( oil his given us, can safely be of its defence on arguments that bring no use of mainly to the mind." That question transcends the jurisdiction of any Presbyterian or other ecclesiastical a sembly 1 endowed chairs and church preferments, are matters of law which must be it in the hands of the proper tribunals Hut the Bible is the common property of Christendom, and from the high heart of conscience to which it appeals pro Judice emolument ambition, jealous-, prescription, and every other false witness must be excluded, the voice of ignorance must be silent, and truth alone must be fought in whatever manner it may appear A book of any kind always carried, with it its own credentials, and these are men of little faith who fear for the Bible a test to which the Koran, the book of Mormon, the A cedars, and other holy books of all peoples are rigorously subjected Professor Smith's first lecture is devoted to an explanation and vindication of his method of criticism It is the inductive method, not the a pi form. He refuses to bring to the sacred writings any " poetic truths " any theological dogmas, any philosophical system with which the holy oracles are to be forced into harmony by commentaries as complex as the vertices of the Copernican system of the physical universe. All our discoveries in natural science have sprung from that habit of questioning nature, of Intoning to her voice and watching every indication of her wave, which istnoiirbt qualification of the seeker for truth so the Bible must be left to tell its own I do as nearly as possible in the identical words of the holy men who spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost' The first thing, then, for Biblical criticism to do is to find out what constitutes the Bible and that is prior to the question of what the Bible teaches. In the words of the writer - " We have got to go back, step by step, and retrace the history of the Sacred Volume up to the first origin of each separate waiting which it contains In doing this we must use every light that can be brought to bear on the subject Every fact is welcome, whether it come from ToAAish tradi- tion or from a companion of old MsS and versions, or from an examination of the several books with one another, and of each book in its loss n inner structure It is not needful in Ffartinp; to lay down any fixed rules of procedure The ordinary laws, of evidence and good sense must be our guides, and these we must apply to the Bible distaste should do to any other ancient book For the transmission of the Bible is not due to a continued miracle, but to a watchful Providence ruling the ordinary means by which ancient books have all been handed down In this department of intellectual life science and faith have joined hands There is no discordance between the religious and the scholarly methods of study They lead to the same food and the more closely our study fulfils the demands of historical scholarship, the more fully will it correspond with our religious needs " The eleven Bucceodmg lectures give the results of this method of study, and some -valuable samples of the evidence on which these results rest. The Old Testament was written in Hebrew while that was a spoken language, but after the cap tivity Hebrew became a learned tongue, and the kindred but still distinct Aramaic, sometimes mis ailed Iebrew, supplanted it as the vernacular of Palestine While Hebrew was a hung language it was walton only in consonants, the bowels being taken for granted by the reader But when it became a dead language the pronunciation was a matter of tradition, taught by the Rabbi-. to their pupils until the Massoiots or go lessors of tradition" had completed a set of vowel points and accents which are now essential to the understanding of printed Hebrew. like an illustration. In old Hebrew without vowel points the same letters " hmmtth would mean either " be 1 " or staff ' according to the pronunciation. With vowel forth a hammittah " would be the bed," and committed " would be the staff " The same word is actually given "bud" in Genesis xiv 81, and start " in Hebrews we. 21 The reason for the differ cure is, that the Old Testament is translated from the text of the Hebrew Massorets, and the writer of the Epistle to the Hebrews was quoting from the Septuagint, a Greek version of a Hebrew text very much older than the Massoretic text which became the modern standard. The Septuagint has thus become a valuable means of correcting the Masoretic text, because it is an independent transfer bon made by competent men from Hebrew MSS hundreds of years older than the standard finally adopted by the Massorets, and a translation acknowledged to be faithful and authentic by the Jews of Palestine for centuries, both before and after the Chus lian era. An instance or two of Profesor but the comparisons between the Masoretic Hebrew text, which is the basis of our authorised version and the Septuagint, based on pre-Christian Hebrew MSS. will i best illustrate his mode of working :— He now St i t vrixT And Saul said to Ahiah, And S ml send to March, ong hither the Vikol God bring; hither the echoed, for For the Vik o' God was on be here (he replied on that that day, and notes L A , day before Israel with] the Children of Israel 1 Sunl, ma , IS they came to the house of they came to the house Ishboshcth, in the hottest of lshbo-,bcth in the hottest part of the day, while he put of the day, while he was taking his mid-day was taking his mid-day siesta And hither they siesta And, lo, the we can in came into the midst of the who kept the door of the house, fetching wheat, and house was cleaning wheat, smote him in the flank , and and she slumbered and slept, Rechab and hannah his and the brothers Rechab and brother escaped, and they Baanah got through an engine into the house as he observed, and came into the lay on his bed and house as lshbosoth lay on Hiiolo him and slow him, his bed, as she 2 Sand , to , or 6, and 7 I will bring back all the will make all the people people to thee Like the turn to thee as a bad turn return of the whole is the 6th to her husband The man whom thou seekers All socket the late of but one mo people shall have peace man, and all the people shall \- ham > seven , I have peace It does not follow that the Septuagint is always the hotter text but the two throw light upon each other in a variety of ways which help a competent scholar to the ipsissima coach The inspired author. The use made of the variations in most effective. It is proved almost to absolute demonstration that the story of David and Goliath in the authorized version following the Massorohc Hebrew text is made up of two separate nan natives subsequently put together by "compiler so is to overlap each other.

In one sense all these were the Torah (Law) of Moses because they were based upon his legislation But they reveal a regular growth such as might be expected in the life of a people advancing from the primitive pastoral stage to the agricultural and commercial epochs with political institutions also changing during successive centuries'. The ritual of Aaron in the wilderness at 1 Ii at Shiloh, of Samuel it Mispch, Gilgai, and Bethel, of David on Mount Zion, of Solomon and his successors and of all the prophets who were before the child, was not the actual pre cribed in the critical law as the Bible history itself abundantly proves Yet it was signally approved by Jehovah when devout Hebrews approached him through its means Is it to be supposed that the Levitical law could be in existence all this time and yet have its requirements ignored by the most conscientious men and by the nation gone rally for many centuries ? We can find no passage in Professor Smith's lectures better adapted to present his views of the Pentateuch than the following " YYTien 810 I Levitical law lost comes on the stage of actual history at the time of EVen it presents itself as the 1 iii of Moses People who have 0 not understood the Old Testament are accustomed to say with the usual proving tion of an historipcal rationalism, that this is either literally tree or a lie The Pentateuch is either the literary work of Moses, or it is a barefaced imposture The reverent and fhnttfrhtful student, who knows the complicated difficulties of the problem, will not readily accept this statement of the question If we are tied up to mud 0 11 choice between the 0 two alternatives it is impossible to deny that all the historical evidence that has come before us points in the duction of the second Hour present Pentateuch was written by Alomes ltwaslo^tas completely insane hook could be The prophets know the his tory of Moses and the p anarchy they know that Moses 13 the founder of I each but they do not know that complete system which we have been accustomed to suppose his work and the priests of Shiloh and the temple do not know the very parts of the form of his h would have done most to raise their authority and influence at the time of Josiah a hook of the law is found, but it is still not the whole Pen- that such, for it does not contain the full Rev local system From the death of Joshua to Ezra is on the usual chronology just one thousand year "NY There was the Pentateuch all this time, if it was as! known to everyone of those who ought to have had most interest in it ?" It is plain that no thinking men can be asked to accept the Pentateuch as the literal work of Moses without some evidence to that effect But evidence a thousand years after date to the evidence at all, when the intervening period be in, unanimous witness in a different sense Bv in asking that the whole Pent iii nell is one word of Moses and all of equal date the traditional view cuts off nil and ability of proof that its 1 erne! is No mc For, it is, cer am that Israel before the 0 evils did not know all the Pentateuch Therefore if the Pentateui his nil one they did not know any p 3 t of it.

There he became familiar with the great German philologists whose re beauties have almost created the science with which thou names are so intimately associated The results of Biblical criticism he has now once existed are by no means new to students, of German literature, nor are they regarded as inconsistent with a devout belief in the Holy Scriptures as the rule of i nth and life Whether they are consistent with the Westminster Confession and with the retention of a professional chair in a Presbyterian College is a question we do not care to discuss The world wants the truth and the truth 10 to be determined, not by Synods and Councils and ecclesiastical deere s but by rigorous investigation and the balance of evidence authority itself must have right on its side Roseworthy of. reverence The force of. numbers the power of wealth, the imposing influence of titles, rank, and ceremonies, will not suffice to maintain its reason unless it can commend itself to the judgment and conscience of thinking men.
