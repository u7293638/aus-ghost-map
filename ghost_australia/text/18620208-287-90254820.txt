W by, that the colonists there are more liberal and more iu earnest than in any of the other Australian colonies. At a meeting of the Biblo Society just held at Parraraatta, tbe agent of the parent institution, the Rev. J. K.. Tucker, commenced hie speech by expressing a very high opinion of the Christian zeal, activity, and libe rality of the people of South Australia, which colony he had recently been visiting-.
