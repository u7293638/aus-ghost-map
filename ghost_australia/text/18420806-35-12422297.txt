HARBOUR ACT. His Excellency the Governor has directed that the general objects of the undermentioned Bill, now under Consideration of the Legislative Council, be published for general information. No. 1. — A Bill to amend an Act intituled ' An Act for the better preservation of the Ports, Harbours, Havens, Roadsteads, Chan- nels, Navigable Creeks, and Rivers, in New South Wales, and the better regulation of Shipping in the same." With reference to the penalty of £100, imposed by the fifth clause of the Act 4 Victoria, No IV., on any Master of a Vessel who shall allow any passenger to embark on board his Vessel, whose name is not contained in the outward list of Crew and Passengers, required to be delivered to the Officers of Customs before the departure of Vessels — It is proposed to empower the Judge, before whom any such case shall be heard, to reduce such penalty to any sum not less than £10, if he think fit. APPOINTMENT. — His Excellency the Go- vernor Has appointed Mr, George Milner Slade, Clerk to the Bench of Magistrates, at Brisbane, Moreton Bay THEATRE. — Although it is not usual to notice the performances at the Theatre on benefit nights, the production of a colonial play on Mrs. Knowles's night induces us to depart from our usual custom. The play of SALATHIEL was entirely successful - the inci- dents all told, the plot worked out well, the language, where the author was followed, and It was easy to see where he was not, was polished and appropriate, and, in fact, the piece gave so much satisfaction, that at the conclusion of it Mr. Knowles w is called for, and returned thanks for the manner m which his production had been received. Mr. Nes- bitt, who was to have played the principal character, was unable to appear — drunken- ness, it was said, being the cause of the inability — and the part was undertaken at a few minutes notice by Mr. Simmons. The early part of the evening was wet and dreary, which prevented the house from being so well attended as it generally has been at Mrs. Knowles's previous benefits. Should Mr. Knowles print his play, we shall take an opportunity of noticing it more fully.
