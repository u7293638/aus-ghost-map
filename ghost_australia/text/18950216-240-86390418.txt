After dinner that evening Florenooce loft her cousin to his own resources, but at eleven o'clook camo down from Ann's room to bid him goodnight. " Don't lot them turn out the lights," he said. "It's 0o use my going yet. I may as well make myself comfortable indoors for another hour or more." She clspd herho handls nervously is she looked down into his upturned face. "No use going where ' shie faltered. "On the watch, to bhe sre," "Oh, Arnold," shea cried, "I hoped you had had enough of this," "Enooughl I I haven't .beogun. Why, Floy, I told you I meant to shadow that woman like death." "N over mind what you told me, Arnold. Don't do it ; please don't do it. Oblige mo inthis. lMr hairford was a friend of father', he is a friend of mine, and this very morning you called at his house and pretended that he was a friend of yours. Please, Arnold, give in to me in this." "Sorry, Floy, but it can't he done," he answered. "It puzzles me you take such an interest in the chap. You haven't kno;vn him three months all told. You go to bed, and wlhen I've discovered the truth, you 11 he thankful I stood firm for once in my life." Sho turned away very sadly, and Arnold began to repose upon two chairs. Shortly after midnight, he bcetno eageorgr to b doing something. It was a cool, fresh night, and he turned up his coat collar as he quitted the house. Thou he took his stand under the shadow of the largo sycamore tree, anti fixed his eyes upon the two gates of Forest Prospect. But though, with patience worthy of Joe Bodger, he waited thoro two weary hours, no sound fell upon his oars 0av0 the ,ttikiug of the distant clurch clock, echoed by another within the house, the rustling of the leaves, and the occasional crowing of a restleec chantlcleor. It was eleven the next morning when he came down to breakfast. "No luck last night," he said. "Of course, I put the Johnny on his guard. An awful juggmno I was I Wiell, Ploy, well seo who tires tirst I Arnold Derwent was not the only person In ltooktiold who perplexed his mind about the mysterious woman in black. After gooig dutifully to church on Sunday evening, Lizzo went to her iatoors cottage, a clean whitu building, with a roof of extremely ornamental thatch, standing at a coovenient dtdunce from the cuuro~yard-tau lield or MIr Mgfoide labours for so ml.ty yetrs that, at least as far as the living were con corued, no rrgardedl that domato a virtually hbs o0n proporty. " It a my opinion you sec a ghost, Lie.' said Mrs .luoftord, the only bacek-naioed membn r of the faily. ' vo seeon 'em my self, come to tiat. Take the night oluore poor Aunt Lorry tiled. ' "It wasn't Io ghost," declared John, the oldest son ; "I uvor saw a ghost. I lay she'd holloa if 1 Ilah. hos on nor. ' John tollowed up the assertion with a loud gufftw, as hu drew Ihs huge boots farther boneath his chair. " If it wasn' a ghost," sail Mrs Mogford. "I don't see no harm done. A poronu can walk what time nae likes and no harm done, ii ta be she to a person; w ha do you say, father ?" "1 say the same as you say, Emma," answereu hgfoed, who from long-eoxpcriencu found this a plan welch taved troalOe nid ilt-feelng. Hoe was a thick-act, bow-legged, dreay-faoed man, with a shock of brhlgta red hair, and an invariable eloell of eartll about his clothes. "VWell soon find out that 'ere," said James, the younger born. ' low'a that, Jim?' aked lizzio; "how are you going to find out " "ath and see, Liz. Ain't that reason? If you want to find out what a thing is, jut loot at it, And there y'ore. You're lu it, John ?" "I'm there, James." "I don't know but what I'll make another," said Mogford, senior; "eh, missus !" Betwoeen a desire to alfford her rash off spring the natural protectlon of their father and to preserve her husband from danger, Mirs Mogford wavered ; but at last the plot was hatched, and Lizloe told Florence all about it on Monday morning. Lattr in the day, meeting Owen Fairlord in the village, Florence stopped. le ssemred entirely to have forgotten his embarrusament at The Itookery the other night, and after some casual remarks, asked alter Anu. "She in dying fast,' was the reply. "Dr Viret doubts whether she will live through the day. I should not have left her, only he insisted that I should come out for half an hour." Whn presrently her small hand rested a moment n his rnather large one, shli longed yet did not dare to warn him of the rod in pickle. Not only wna Arnold on the watch, but the Mogfords also; aud, between lthon, surely 0 van mast be compelled to sulfer. And there was another, still more vigilant, entirely unsuspectod either by Florence or Owen. Joe Iodger, having gained an ink limg of the Megtord sohoeo at the Lton, regarded it as a drsign to talo the brcrdout of his own open mouth. But when, about five o'clock, tho oloudo whitch had beha lowermg all day burst tutionuly over hlook. feld, Joe rejoiced. If the Mogfords wareao ill-advised as to turn out, tlhey would scure only a ducking for their pain?; nobody elsa was Ihkely to follow thtir crxample I AtoorCdmgly, he himself trned m at eloven, and wea lying Itateniog to the rani patter ing on the roof overnnad, when hohei arda door oponod and oloord, and reohled his look-out just on time to see a tall, dark figure leave the gate, to all appearances toe aiaon uoacry tocpoot oA usual, oxcept that instead of, or, for all he could sRue, as weoll as, having tie lace hldden by a veil. an ambrtlia was holt low down over tlo hoat.

A thrill of suppressed exoitement was common to the threo. " ho'a comling." whfopered John. lnitalg their head above the nali they all peered over. Twro ate of teeth chattered, and Mogford, whose teeth were, for the most part, things of the pant, quaked in his ahgon. There was oon tall ligure in black, just as Lizzio described it, naveo the face was hidden by an nnbrella. The pourlngrain prevented the three watchers front clearly diotinguioh Ing any ldetail, exocept the loft hand hnng ing bare. At it drew level with their ambush, the Mogforde stooped lower anti rrept along under the shelter of the wall to. wards the lych gate. Then Mlogford senior opened it. " eVo won't stand no nonsense," said James, ovinoing a courteous desire to stay behind nod shut the gate; but the otheors waited for him, and three abreast they advanced to meet the tall black figuro. Stopping right In front of it, they effectually barred the way. Next moment the umbrella was raised, an?, to their utter astonishment and confusion, they found themselves face to face with Owen Fairford. He was clad in a long black mackintosh; and, what with the darkness of the night, the blinding rain, and their preconcuived opinions, t halt been quite easy to mistake his teo. "Well," he exclaimed, "what do you want ? You appear to occupy a good deal of the highway." Mogford felt that he was in a quandary. IIe scoaraly know what explanatlon to offer, and after rubbing Iris head for some seconds in confusion, stammered an apology, and, followed by his two aons, beat an undigniliod retreat As he deoolared subsequently, you might have knocked him down with a feather ; anJ hit wife aummed up the whole case :- " Liz is just crazed," she said. But the rsnidents of the night were not at anu ond yet. True to hlris word, Arnold Der oenthad watched and waitedin vain. If he had not paid that visit to Forest Pro. opoct, doubtless, as he continually told Florence, the woman would have come forth and delivered herself into his hands -re now. But to-night seemed to him pro p.tiaus. Owen Fatrford would not gtve tiut credit for sufficient perseverance to bravo tile elements. It wao exactly the night to throw him off Iris guard, exactly the ngnot to bring florth the woman whomn his wratbi fuina.n had recently confilned titiln doors. Accordingly, he camo out a little after lhall-pat twelve, having waited till the last mloent in order to reduce hlis inevitable tucking tJ the minimum, andtook his stand beneat the tay anore tree,. fe could not setnoucth through the slant. log lines of rain ; but about one o'clock, thinking ie heard footstep,s he carned hin head fra nod, and perrealnvmng a person in hIlok on too point of cttering the furthest gate of Furoat Prospect, ran swiftly along btsido the hedgo, ald himslf enotered tot orater gate, hoping to intercept the person beiorr the front door could be gained. Within a second of being too late, the door nearly olo.ed, to his excitement Arnold threw hitumelf l .inat It with atl his force. It illmaediately flew wide open, and, to lis surproau. he was confro.ttoh by O.ren stern, white face. ?oth Aruold persisted ; planting his right foot upon the mat, he attempted to make goold nm entry. " Leaae oly house," said Oson, looking down upon hlln threaternngly. But Arnold'. bho?tad ws tip, ond he was uo, the man to be turted back Iry a t:,reaf.

" For iGod' take send for Vlret to fet it, and get olo out of pain." The wounded limb lay in a sling roughly tied by weo, whlstla Arnold, looking olant and pale, clasped it with his lft lohanu. 'Chuy led him into the dining-room, and Lizoie lighted a lamp. " Toll tne what i can do I" cried Florence, full of sympathy for his obvious pamn, and of wonder Athe canuse of he dlisaatr. " Nothing, only send for \orit. While they're gone you can got some scissors and out my coat off."

Tuen Florence was sent away, and Dr. Viret immodiately got to work I and when ato arm was not, Owen helped Arnold into bed. " Bid for you all, thie," said the doctor, meotnig Flournce on reaching the hall cgaon. " You haven't turned in yet-three o'look, too. Hfow'e Ann ?" "Sao in dead," was the reply. "She died at halfpant twelve. It wae terrible to meo her at the last, battling for power o1 -pe-oh, as if she longed to say a few last words.." Owen folded hie arms and turned away an her tears began to flew afrerh. "You'ro bettor alone," said Dr. Viret. " I'll come over to.morrow and talk about Aon's funeral." Owen followed the doctor out of the house, and stopping at hi. own gate, asked abruptly,- "\Vet in to result from all thin ?" "Dorwent willnave to keep quiet a few weeks, and be a little more Abstemious." "I meant rather regarding myself. Of course, I am sorry the man is hurt. I am wondering whelther he will makeo a noise about the affatilr." " He knows he brought it on himself," Dr. Virot answered. "If a mon tried to enter my house, I should servo him the amnoe. Come, Tigoer. Good.night, Mr Fair. lord." Joe Bodger from the hayloft window saw Oen appronch the door. During the last two hours he had endured all the pains of Tantaluo. He had awaited anxioualy the result of the encountor with the 2iogfords, and been astonished to see the tigure re-enter the garden alone, and apparently unharmed; stdl more astonished to sea another dusky form dart in at the second gate, to hoar sounds of a struggle, end Arnold'n yell of pain. TJ?t the ause of this proved to hbe Owen himself, instead of the woman, surprised him less. A suspicion of somethng of the kind had lilled his mind for some time past; but ouncerning the purpose of these nightly wonderinde Joe remained as much in the dark as ov0r. Although it was early morning when F lorouc retired to rest, ahe came downstairs only an hour later than uoal, and looked up in astonishment when Arnold entered the room before she finished breacfast, \hallet Owen fetched Dr Virot last night, Arnold, in short, disjointed suoenence, gave her a hurioed accouuc of hie accident; and, wilst hardly blaming Owen fur reslting hli couniu a ocruoieo, it was entirely impossible to wilhnold her sympathy from the nuoffrer, nilom, in fact, she had expected to be an rnraitd, keeping his room fur several daveys. I'erthap Arnold stood higocr un her regard hliu mornmg than sincu theo rst day or his rutur to liotokield. "It gives me a twinge now and then," he said, answering her cuquiries. ' But I'n a oad hand at lytig up. Itook an hour to dress myself, and you observe I haven t omad. a very good jell of it yet." His coat, buttoned acro.s the cheet, hung like a c.po outside his arms, his gooU lumourod race loosed pale, and black pa?ches were visiblo under i. eyes.o "' Beosdos," he added, " I knew there was the funeral to see to.

"'To tell you toe truth, tdon't ca;e to play seonod hndle to Vfret en vertthing. lne to baomy y, and I don't s.n why I shouldn'r. Wi'ncrc are you going to bury the woman?

Nothiag could so curely betray Floren??e conviction that abheo w* never see her lato p;iIr, . If she had actually nourished enen thu fainteat hope untl now, surely nothing would have Induced her to yield to Arnulod a uggestron ; but it seemed to be just what the old faithful asrvant would have i.,hed, and ct would certinamly save nn outly whtcn must inovitably fall upon Dr After breakfast, whllat Arnold was ro" ciinig upon te sofa, Dr Viret arrived, and, havmg eoxamined the ureenings, asked for "neoru's Ann's funeral to talk about," he ,aid, "and the sooner it's all eottled the better." "It is all settled," Arnold replied. "' 1V talked it over at orootlast, aund we re going to bury her m the fanilly grave." "W'no suggeatod thatl" Dr Viret do manded. " Coi ato that, I suggested it. The grave is praotially mme, you know; and I offered it to Florence for Ann. It will nave upense, and It Seems the natural thig to do." "'Natural-I don't see it. Howevr,o' he added, "if your cousin wishes it that's enough." " Hoero she is," said Arnold, as the door opened ; " you can enquire for youraself.' " So you wish to lay Ann in your mother's grave" he askeid, taking her proffered hand. " Yes, I thought so, Dr Virat. If you see no oujetidon.'" "l-none in the world. If it in really your wish,. oly dent be ridiculous ; ar you sure the question of money does not arile.n ' lie appeared a little difficult to convince on this piuot, but at lant the matter wan dcidcld, and Arnold drew a breat of reliefi. " Enough of than," he cried. ", I say, doctor, I got bcautifully told last nigts, didn't i?' SYles, you scratcheod a lusean and found a Tartar. I suppose you i1 aduit your blunder now.

He took his hat from the table and stood with it a moment in his hand. Presently he drew closer, and she heard her own heart beat as she waited, wondering what he would say next. lut it was only good-byo, and in another minute he had left her. CHAPTEII XVII. NeLWa AT LAST. It was Thrsdany morning, and the day fixed for Ann's funeral. Toe blinds ware all drawn down at The Rookery, and the sun shone upon them hotly, and the flowers looked cheerful in the garden. Mindful of Florence's slightest wisb, as usual, Dr Vtret had volunteered to follow the old servant to the grave. There was none besides; and she had gratefully amssnted. The funeral was timed for one o'clock, and at half-past eleven Florenoo eat reading the morning newspaper, whilst Arnold lay wearily on the sofa, caraening his woundtied arm, when the visitor's hbell rang. To their aoto o.ohmeat, Owen pushed past the housemaid, and, unceremoniously enter. ing, ignored Arnold, whom he had not seen ainee the night of the fracas, and walked quickly towords Florence. " I bring bad news l" he cried, evidently lahoutri.g tndeor tunaoe excoitement. "About father i" elt faltered, blanching to the lips, her face looklrg suddenly all eyes. " "Mr Derwent's body is found." Arnold rose from the sofa, not at all quickly; doubtless his broken arm made his movements more careful than they used to be. " Good Lord I' he exclaimed. Florence sank back into her chair again; hereyca quite dry, a terrible, stricken ex preslon to her face. '?haero whero i" she gasped, barely able to form the words. Tell me quickly ; let leo hear the worst. e can bear it." SIn--for Gld's sake be brave, Florence," Owen continued,-in your mother's grave." As he leaned over her she bent furward, and whilst ner eyes seemed to protrude, and her lip.s ,ro parted with horror, tightly gripped Oen's lIft arm. "I was paslong the churohyard," he con tinued hurrtodly, "and seeing a crowa , entered. The coffin lay beside the grave, its Lid jast being replaoed." " Wny-why did they take it offi" ehe cried. Arnold was pacing up and down the room. The moat canual observer might nave per. eiwed th?t taee news watch tilled her wiet horror afooeted atm very differently. His handsome, good-humourel face wore a look of elatlou ; hi exciltment was obvious. "* On opening the grave just now," Owen explalued, "Mlogford saw tuat the upper mo.t cotlin had been tampered wife, atn seut fr sergeant Cadmnu. In toe aergeaut'e presence he removed tne lia; it was hold only by tour sacrew.. Inreadnf your mother ocrpeo, he saw Mr DOetwntae. "'At any rate," otled Arnold, "the m stery i solved at last."
