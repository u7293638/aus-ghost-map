IPfr- - They say that the name of the'sttntion is changed,' and that tlie dog ie dead, but I remember, and I think I shall- re member always. In a sharp V of a valley, between two tail, unheeding mountains, stood a Jitfile brown station, all alone. It looked, like a knot in tbe end of. the brown rag of road that lmn<\- (.v.M- tlie low rldeir beyond it. "Hope" was thename in the middle of the weathered : sign-board, with "Winnipeg. — miles," at the nearer end, and "Vancouver, — dalles," at the farther. There was small token of life abont the building so far as even we In tlie observation car could see, so, when the conductor came back from the office with his orders, we wondered why "the train did not go on. But pretty soon a tall old man, wltb a red flag under Ms arm. came up the track ahead to the station platform. Some of us had alighted, and to us he volunteered, wMle he rolled bis flag closer:— "Rock on tbe track!" "Is it very large?" asked someone. "Nope; they'll get it off purty soon; like 'nough. In 'bout ten minutes." That accent was unmistakably from the "States," and I came nearer where I could bear all be said. He sat down on a pile of boxes, and. in reply to some remark, said meditatively: "Nop: trains don' liev much 'casion to stop here long nowndays. Used to be a puty decent mine up yonder." jerk ing his head toward the little road; "then they war some doin's here." "Mine abandoned?" "Eaup." he was going on: when an other idea struck bini. He, looked round uneasily. "They liain't none of you seen Roily, hcv you?" "Who's Holly?" "W'y. Roily, he's tlie dorg:" his eyes grew anxious. "He's a great institution 'round these parts. Roily Is." He rose and went quickly to the, door of tbe station, opened it, and put his head inside. "Say. Bennie. Where's Roll ?" he called. His voice was different from that In which he spoke to the men out side. , The answer was inaudible. "Humph! Gurious. ain't It? When did he-go?". Again the Inaudible reply. "Well, he must a' heard the whistle." He came back to the travellers, but with bis eyes on the brown road crer the ridge. "Didn't it pan out?" asked one. "Huh? Ob. tbe mine! " IHulino. I guess 'twould ef— — " but tbe old Idea was too 6trong— his eyes sought the slope again. "Now, where in . time is that doi-g? He ain't, use", .to missin trains." " "What was the matter at the mine?" "Oh," there was ghosts came there, 'n' they scart everybody. n now they won't no one go nigh but Roily, and he's interested. Wish 't he'd come, any how." . ii " "Well, what is II about , Roily, my friend, is he your dog?"' asked a big, quiet man, standing near with his wife. "Nope! That is, he is and-4ie ain't — one way he's" mine, and two he ain't — ope way he's mine, . 'cause: 1 jfSed 'im and hanker after 'Im ef he ain't round. One way he ain't mine, he's Behnie's, 'cause everything I've got that ®ennie hankers after Is Ms'n, an, he thinks a heap o' Roily. Bennie's the telSgraph here. . . ."
