[?] Cricket. THE TWENTY-EIGHT INTERCOLONIAL MATCH. Lovers of cricket, or lovers of Australia, or of those por tions of Australia lying within the bounds of New South 'Wales or Victoria — patriots, that is to say, or sportsmen could not have desired a fairer noontide than shone downupon the Association Ground on Friday, the 10th, the opening day of the ' most immemorial' match that the Association Ground has yet seen. The north-east breeze piped merrily across the sandhills, the blue waves beyond Botany were all a-dance with joy, and a pleasant freshness and jubilant hopefulness were manifest in the faces of the few thousands that at the beginning of the game Bpread themselves about tne terraces and the grand stand. Not many thousands upon the first day ; Sydney has not a large population who can quit business upon a Friday, even for the pleasure of on intercolonial match. The men are all busy, and the women do not care particularly to go without the men, or rather, let ub say, they sacrifice themselves and will not go when it is positively certain that the men will be absent. It was upon Saturday afternoon that the grand stand blossomed in all its glory, and the densely thronged terraces all about the enclosure buzzed as the living walls of a Spanish amphitheatre, and occasionally broke into shonts that might have scared the Russians had they still been cruiBlng outside the Heads. The grand stand itself, the structure apart from its contents, is worthy of a little notice, and might with a little elaboration be made the most notable, cricket pavilion in the world. In size it is ample; in arrangement, very complete. The seats rise at a pleasant incline, and are not too straight in the back ; and down below are refreshment rooms, with liquor at a drinkable temperature, and room to sit down without un seemly jostling. The interior of the roof is a blot upon its perfections, artistically considered ; too many trusses aud beams and ties are shown that could not possibly be done without, but certainly would be better concealed. Still, when, as upon Saturday, Sydney turns out all her pink and white, and smiles and dimples, all the roses of her rosebud garden, and the lilies of her lily field, robed in the soft fabrics, and bright, cool tints of the summer season, who considers an unsightly roof ? Who looked beyond that field of beauty on Saturday, where primary colours were unknown, but all the sympathetic tints of the ' aesthetic craze' met and blended in a rich, harmonious glow ? Too much pink was tlie only fault. There is too much pink every where now, and yet pink was never the colour of a Murdoch, or a Haycock, or a Trickett. Some lovely face above a pink frock aud beneath a pink bonnet has set the city palpi tating with admiration and jealousy, and since pink has 2 ? i ? i.ff ..A BA t-Vtnl MAH, 4La UOiIIIIJaIcU pttUU UtUllDCI O ItUivjy Bv LUnt UvW tUv ptttllcUv green, and the silvery gray, and the heliotrope, and the lavender, and the primrose, and the faraway azure, and the quaint old gold are killed, put out of sight and considera tion, while the pink flaunts, and is not at all times enchant ing. The glare was not quite so prominent on Saturday as has been usual of late. It may be that a reform is Betting in, orthatthestocksof pinks are giving out. Certain it is that the effect of the grand stand was as satisfactory to the con noisseurs of art and beauty as to the patrons of the game and the treasurer of the Association. And upon the lawn, green and soft, and shaven and shorn, the moving colours and the merry music were also pleasing. Without these sacred premises, sanctified by the charge of a half crown per head for admission, were all the people who really love the game, who come to see and in no sense to be seen— the critics ana enthusiasts who can stand upon one leg for half-a-day and be content to see with one eye, or sit upon six inches of turf, and be thankful for small mercies. They were there by thousands —almost tens of thousands— their faces chiefly observable ; eager and elate, hope changed to certainty, and expectation to glorification. Their voices were occasionally heard in one long-continued roar that went round and round the ring like an electric current, and con tinued at timeB until it seemed reasonable to suppose the community had gone mad. Notably when the 500 went up did the cheers arise long and loud ; so loudly and so long that cricket was suspended for a while, and the cricketers, having bowed to all points of the com pass, sat down upon the grass to wait until hands were tired or throats grown hoarse with cheering. It is exceedingly probable mat Murdoch got more applause on that day than any man in Australia ever received in a single day before. He had a six hours' triumph, while all the hearts of the people were with him, as were the hearts of Borne, in old days, with a Caesar bringing home his spoils. Murdoch spoiled the Victorians : was it not reasonable that we should rejoice ? They had had their share. Four con secutive laurels had gone across the border or been retained there. It was time that we should peg one ; but the mis chief is that all our magnificent success pegs but one. Had we beaten by a wicket or a run, the game had been ours, aud a one-innings victory with 138 runs to spare is but a victory, and counts but one. Something should be changed there ; a big hit should count more, and big victories also, even though the scientific exactitude of the game should suffer, because it has always to be remembered that should positive perfection of cricket be attained we should be no nearer the millennium, or cheap bread and butter, or the squaring of the circle, or improve ment in the telophone, or Australian federation, with the Federal Parliament picnicing on Saturday afternoon in Sydney harbour. Perfection in cricket or a multiplication of Murdochs would make the game very monotonous indeed. Friday's game began upon a wicket worthy of good play, prepared with all the skill that a quarter of a century of training and a lifetime of love have taught Ned Gregory. It felt like good scoring, and Murdoch leaped a mile in imagination immediately he had won the toss. The play began with A. Bannerman and Massie at the wickets. Four runs were made from the first over, which augured well, and runs followed runs fast till MaBsie moved around at a ball that seemed ' to leg,' but wasn't, and didn't 6core a five, bnt lost his bails. Many hopes were quashed as this plucky but latterly unlucky batsman returned to the pavilion. We expected three figures from him, or at the very lowest a half -century. Murdoch filled the vacancy, and everybody felt as confident when theyjsaw him step into the breach as Romans would do to-day did the ghost of Horatius appear before them. Murdoch was acknowledged in England as the best captain ever seen in a cricket field ; he has proved himself also the greatest master who ever wielded willow. It is unnecessary to follow his 11 hours' innings point by point. A. Bannerman went for 30 when the score stood at one short of 150, caught in the slip by Palmer, but the champion still played on. C. Bannerman stayed but a very few minutes, leg before wicket ; and young Jones, unhappily deprived of all chance of winning laurels in the recent great matches, buckled on his armour and came out, aud the two as knight and squire fought valiantly together until the evening. The play was a close approach to absolute perfection on all sides, the bowlers perhaps a little weary, but the field true and steady and watchful as through the first hour of play. At the time of stump-drawing Murdoch stood at 183, Jones 91, and the total 350. The telegram to that effect that went down to Melbourne doubtless made ali the people of that southern village supremely happy. ' We will change all that to-morrow,' they said ; and Murdoch rubbed his hands and said, ' exactly so.' Noon upon Saturday saw all the men in their places again, Baker at the bowling crease and the unvanquished of the previous day at the wickets. Ah, it was a weary day for Victoria. Jones went about an hour from the start, having increased his score to 109, and left the total at 400. He was caught at short-leg by Boyle. Davis came and went, caught in the same position by the same field for 4 ; but Murdoch still played on. Garrett came in, and aided his chief manfully till the sun was well down, Murdoch driving balls hither and thither for lours, threes, and twos as easily and gracefully as an old woman shelling peas. Lunch came — have I already spoken of lunch ? I remember it not, and it is a part of the record that should not be let slip. It was a good lunch, and well served upon each and every day ; there was an abundance of room and tolerable attendance. It was different — oh, so different — from the alfresco concerns of old. But who of New South Wales thought of lunch while there was any prospect of Murdoch scoring 1000, or who of Victoria while it was held possible to slaughter him for 600? Lunch was eaten, and the play went on. Somehow about this time Murdoch seemed content with himself. Samson probably got tired by the time he had slain the three hundredth Philistine. He made a few more splendid drives ; but at last lifted one above the! carpet, and yet not high enough ; it went out to leg, ana Blackham greeted it as a New Zealandjsettler would have grabbed Te Kooti 10 years ago, or a Sydney shark to-day would collar a Victorian's leg. Is it necessary to say that the pavilion cheered till one might have fancied the roof was rending ? — that all around the ring the welkin rang (welkin is an old word, and a good word, and means something doubtless) ? — that men were ready to give their hearts and their jlives, and their sisters, and almost their sweethearts, to the gallant captain ? — that a general movement was made from the pavilion to come down and embrace him; but was checked by — well, propriety ? — that sovereigns were pitched intoahat,and200 promisedin no time topurchase a testimonial to commemorate the mighty innings ? They ought to have come down and carried him in on their shoulders, for never cricketer came in from a wicket since wickets first were pitched having done more to merit honour and glory and fame, it was the greatest of all great innings. More runs have been made, some greater totals put together ; but never against such fields as opposed Murdoch upon that Association Ground.* D. Gregory came next, and played cautiously, as if he had the game to win' by himself. He held his wicket until time was called, and added 21 runs to the score. The total was 640, and there were yet four wickets to fall. Sunday's rest brought every one to the field in fine torm on Monday at noon. Garrett seemed to have taken Murdoch's' place. Gregory was caught by M'Donnell for 28 ; and Hiddlestone came in. He went out of his ground, having made 27 ; and Blackham had the bails off ere he could return. Evans came next, but from him very quickly went Garrett, bowled clean by M'Shane for the splendid score of 163. Spofforth came in, the last man, and scored 8. The innings terminated at 10 minutes past 3 for the splendid, magnificent, never-excelled, and never, never, never to be beaten total of 775. Captain Boyle must have felt somewhat as Hercules with all his labours ahead of him, when he led his team to the wicket. Palmer had said, 'I can swear to every blade of grass on the ground,' when he entered the pavilion after three days' leather-hunting. And now, as M'Donnell and' Blackham went out, they must have felt that there was as much chance of driving every blade of grass from the field as of equalling and surpassing that gigantic score. (The reader should be forgiving if these terms have been repeated. Adjectives give out in dealing with the wonders of late days.) Spofforth took the ball in hand, long and lithe, and angular and fiat, and demoniacal as of old, reaching almost from wicket to wicket and spreading half across the field. Runs went up fast for a while, and once M'Donnell hit Spofforth with all his might, a marvellous hit, right over the pavilion roof. No sneaking drive or scientific tap, sending the ball away ulIOug|il LUG UGili tO BinKo LUG lGXlvc lUl tt iUUl j UUldU UUcii hearted, open-shouldered blow, lifting the ball 30 feet nigh and sending it away like a cannon-shot. There is pleasure in such hits as that. It makes the old game seem masterful once more as when the villagers used to boast how they had topped the tall elm trees. It was risky, doubtless, as was shown by the rattle of the batsman's bails following a second attempt ; but when successful it surely merits a larger reward than that insignificant 5. M'Donnell de served 10 for that one high hit, as would any other man who brought the voices of the whole ring of spectators out in one general cheer. 'Who did not feel weary and impatient through those triumphant hours of Murdoch's ?_ Acorn stalk who would stand frying for the glory of his country might have been happy all along ; but who else ? Is it not advisable to remember that cricket of itself is not as a science to be pursued for its own sake, but simply a means to an end — viz., healthful recreation ? And should not that end be kept steadily in view in framing new laws or amend ing old ones ? It is more than probable that the play would be brighter and the laughs more frequent if every clean cut outBide bounds scored 10 in place of 5. That is moralising. Perhaps it is well to moralise, for the time of applause was almost done. The Victorians went one after another. M'Donnell succumbed to the Demon for 48 ; Baker for 50. The others made fine scores, but what availed they ? At 6 o'clock there were six wickets down for 206; and more should have fallen, or less runs have been made, had there not been so many butter-fingers and bandy legs and wild throwers amongst the Sydney team. Catches were missed in shocking style, and balls flung about as irishmen fling potatoes, or Nihilists dynamite. It was not pretty play at all. Spofforth's face when the stamps were drawn was a study. Both Horan and Blackham had given easy chance' off his bowling a few minutes before, but the * The great scores on record are — 1\. Roe, 415, and not out. Caius Long Vacation Club v. Emmanuel Long Vacation Club, 1881. 2\. Tylecote, 404 runs. 3\. Grace, W. G., 400 and not out, U. B. E. £. v. Grimsby Twenty- two. 4\. Grace, W. G., 344 and not out, M. C. C. v. Kent. 5\.

And for once every body sympathised with him in his hand luck. On Tuesday, the fourth day, play began at noon, as usual. The day was* fine, but the attendance thin; interest was lagging. Victory was sure— victory in one innings a reasonable conclusion. The fielding was again bad— it need not be qualified— and bafi some turn of the tide changed the aspect of affairs, and given Victoria a chance of winning, some of those Sydney n.uffs would surely have had bad dreams for many a night to come. But the play dribbled on, the wickets fell, and the first innings closed for 315— a very good innings, if not made odious by comparison. The next looked even better at sundown ; for though M'Donnell aud Palmer went out for 17 between them, Horan and Black bam held well together, and went in to the pavilion with 61 and 96 respectively, and not out. | There was a little fear and trembling in the minds of some timorous Sydney people upon Wednesday morning; but when it wss known that Murdoch had returned to town— he left for Cootamundra upon Tuesday — hope be came exultant again, and the first telegrams announced that the captain's presence was felt. Blackham disappeared without increasing the score, and there seemed no good man to stop the gap. The play tailed off, and at 20 minutes past 4 the last wicket fell for a total of 322, leaving New South Wales victorious by an innings and 138 runs. Horan alone on the Victorian side scored over 100, though Black ham and Baker, and Palmer and M'Donnell, each and all did valiantly, and put together respectable double figures, comparing favourably with those of the second best of New South Wales; for, taking Murdoch's pheuomeiial score of 321, and the sundries, 62, from the New South Wales total of 775, we have 392 to the credit of the other 10 batsmen, but 272 of these runs were got by Garrett and Jones, leaving only 120 to the account of the remaining eight members of the team. So that the phenomenal play belongs to three men, the others showing only the very ordinary average of 15 each. There can, however, be no doubt that this colony can send a team into the field far-and-away better than Victoria can produce just now. C. Bannerman is probably a cricketer of the past. The ill-at-ease fashion in which he shaped at the wicket on Friday made the spectators glad when he was kindly put out of his misery. But in Murdoch, Garrett, Jones, Massie, and A. Bannerman, New South Wales has the finest quintette of bats men in Australia. And in bowling the superiority is almost as manifest. Spofforth is still the demon of the cricket field. On Tuesday he was credited with the wickets of Blackham, M'Donnell, Horan, and Baker. On Wed nesday he dismissed Turner and M'Shane, each with the disliked 0 opposite his name. It is clear that, wherever he has been resuscitating, he has kept up his dreaded form. He has come down on the Victorians like a wolf on the fold. Passing to the fielding of the contesting teams, it is only fair to admit that the comparison is immeasurably on the side of the visiting team. Through an unprecedentedly long and dispiriting innings, they hunted the leather with unfailing alertness ; while, with eveiything in their favour, including superb bowling and an almost absolute certainty of ultimate vicioty, the local team fielded atrociously on both Tuesday and Wednesday. A muff team. of corpulent grandfathers would hardly have made a worse exhibition. The two teams amalgamated and sifted for Saturday's malch should make a formidable front to oppose the All England. We look to the contest with much resignation, and confess to a modicum of hope. Appended are the tabulated results of the completed match New South Wales.— First Innings. A.
