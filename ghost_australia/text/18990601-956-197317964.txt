THE COMFORTER.— A WHITSUNDAY MEDITATION. The teaching of Holy Scripture about the present mission and work of the Comforter amounts to this : That, just as God the Son, peer from eternity of the Father and the Spirit, humbled Himself to His mediatorial work, for- the manifestation of God's glory and the salvation of mankind, emptied Himself of all the power and wisdom and majesty and the very, fulness of the Godhead, in order to make of the fallen creature Man a son of God, ready and able to do his Father's will — so, also, God the Holy Ghost has humbled Himself, ' not indeed to be made man, or to become, like one of the angels, a ministering spirit to the heirs of salvation, but to be given by the Father to the Godman, to be henceforth the Spirit of Christ, then to be given again by Christ to His covenanted people, to form those to whom He is given into one Body ; in that Body to impart to every member gifts according to his measure for the fulfilment of his proper functions ; to be the sustaining life of the various ordinances and ministries of Christ's appointment, causing them, instead of empty forms, to be the channels of our continual supply from Him who is our Head; to make the Church of Christ His temple, and yet so to dwell in that temple that it shall be Christ's presence with His Church, which His operation shall effect ; to be in everything subject in the Church to Christ as a man's spirit is subject to a man; to witness in all His working to the divinity and Sonship of the Man Christ Jesus, and to say by every tongue that speaks as He inspires that Jesus Christ is God to the glory of God the Father. Such is the glorious condescension of the Holy Spirit of God in the work of man's salvation. But we stop not to exalt His praise. We give thanks to Him always for His great goodness and power, but we then thank and please Him best when we say in heart and life, in word and work, that to us, whom He has purchased with His own blood, Jesus is eternally the Lord.
