A few minutes later the door opened, and here entered a tall, thin, wiry-looking man, ith an unmistakable military bearing, bearing. «< Pardon me for intruding upon you, Mr. gypt to-morrow, I have very little time at v di«po«al " «l am at your service, Colonel," I replied, s I pointed to a seat. ^ " 1 wil1 be as brief as possible," he began, he laced his hi hl £ lished ' hat an | hi ; T an, and . have , spent T much of my time in T J L.

I found that besides the goblet some antique rings and a few pieces of gold and silvef had been carried off. The lost skull had been kept under a glass shade in what the (Colonel called his "Treasure Chamber." It was a small room lighted by an oriel window. The walls were wainscoted half way up, and the upper part was hung with tapestry. The Colonel assured me that the door of this room was always kept locked, and the key was never out of his possession. The lower part of the chimney of theold- fashioned fireplace I noticed was protected by iron bars let into the masonry, so that thethief, 1 was sure, did not come down the chimney ; nor did he come in at the window, for it only opened at each side, and the apertures were so small that a child could not have squeezed through. Nevertheless the thief had succeeded in getting into the room. . How did he manage it ? That was the problem I had to solve, and that done I felt that I should be able to get a clue to the robber, I found the Colonel's family consisted of his wife—an Anglo-Indian lady—three charming daughters, his eldest son, Ronald Odell, a young man about 24, and a younger son, a youth of 12. The family were waited upon at table by two parlour-maids, the butler, and a page-boy. The butler was an elderly, sedate, gentlemanly-looking man ; the boy had an open, frank face, and the same remark applied to the two girls. As I studied them 1 saw nothing calculated to raise,my suspicions in any way. Indeed, I felt instinctively that I could safely pledge aivself for their honesty, Ronald Odell was a most extraordinarylooking young fellow. He had been born and brought up in India, and seemed to suffer from an unconquerable lassitude that gave him a lifeless, insipid appearance. He was very dark, with dreamy, languid eyes, and an expressionless face of a peculiar sallowness. He was tall and thin, with hands that were most noticeable, owing to the length, flexibility, and thinness of the fingers. He sat in the chair with his body huddled up as it were ,* his long legs stretched straight out before him ; his pointed chin resting on his chest, while he eeemed to smoke his cigar as if unconscious of what he was doing, Having passed the household in review without result, I requested that I might be allowed to spend a short time alone in the room from whence the skull had been tolen. The floor was polished and immovable, but a part of the wainscoting gave back a hollow sound to my raps, and I was of opinion that the room had been entered by a secret door. Although convinced that the panel which gave back the hollow sound was a door, I could detect no means of opening it. On rejoining the Colonel, I asked to be allowed carte blanche in the matter, and this ee granted, I tQ ld him that many tilings necessarily seemed extraordinary when the reasons for them were not understood, and with that F emar ' i * t0 °k m y depart mv. living promi*ed the Colonel to do e\>.i .\H"" •'•••rtal mail goiiiu uv t>Q reuwvei' the lvcb akuU, Three days later i went, <iowi. t.rn. Manor disguised as a working plumber," and was admitted without any difficulty. As a ^rvant was showing me upstairs to the top • iding, where a trap-door in the ceiling nave access to the leads, I pnssed iRonald Odell on the stairs. He was attired in a lon<; dressing-gown, had Turkish slippers on his eet, a fez on his head, and a cigar in his mouth, from which he was puffing great volumes of sinokc. His face was almost ghastly in its pallor, and his eyes had the same dreamy look which I had noticed on my first visit. His hands were thrust, deep in his pockets, and his movements and manner were suggestive of a person walking in his sleep, rather than a waking, conscious man. This suggestion was heightened by the fact that before I could avoid him he ran full butt against,me. That,however.seeniedtopartially arouse him from the lethargic condition, and turning round, with a fierceness of expression that I scarcely deemed him capable of, he exclaimed— " You stupid fool, why don't you look where you are going to ? " I muttered out an apology, and he strode dowu the stairs growling to himself. My object in going on to the roof was to see if there was any communication between there and the " Treasure Chamber." I noticed a trap door between two chimney stalks, but found it fastened. So after a time I went back aud inquired of the servant where the communication with the other trap door was. She conducted me to the lumber room, which she assured me was haunted, and there left me at the door, saying, " There you are, but I aint a-going in." The room was in total darkness, but having procured a caudle I commenced to explore. It was filled with a miscellaneous collection of lumber. A flight of steps led to the trap door I had noticed on the roof, but I found they, had not been trodden on for a very long time. The walls of the room were wainscoted. Going down on my knees I examined the floor with a magnifying glass, and detected footmarks made by slippered feet that led to one particular corner of the room. This was very suggestive, and on rapping the wainscot iu that part found it was hollow. Unconsciously I touched a spring in the woodwork, and the door swung open. By the light of the candle I discerned the head of a flight of steps built in the thickness of the wall. I saw unmistakable traces of the slippered feet on the steps as I descended. I reached the bottom, and found further progress barred by a door that was without handle or lock; but, after some time, I discovered a -mall woodeu knob sunk in the woodwork at the side, and, pressing this, the door, with almost absolute noiselessness, slid back, and lo ! the " Treasure Chamber " M as revealed. In the face of this di-covery, I no longer entertained a doubt that the thief had entered the room by means of this secret passage. And there was no one in the whole household upon whom my suspicions fixed with the exception of Ronald Odell. If my assumpt ; on that he was the thief was correct, the mystery was so far explained ; and my next step was to discover why he had robbed his father, and what he had done with the property. He was so strange and peculiar that somehow I could not imagine that he had stolen the things merely for the sake of vulgar gain, my impression being that in carrying off the jewelled skull he was actuated by some extraordinary motive, quite apart from the mere question of theft, and this determined me to shadow him for a time in the hope that I should succeed in soon obtaining distinct evidence that my theory was correct. Before leaving the house, I sought an interview with Mrs. Odell, who was anxious to know what the result was of my investigation : but I considered it advisable, in the then state of matters, to withhold from her the discovery I had made. But, as her curiosity to learn what I had been doing on the roof was very great," I informed her that my theory was at first that there was some connection between the roof and the "Treasure Chamber"; but, though I had not proved that to be correct, I nevertheless was of opinion that the purloiner of the articles resided in the house. Whereupon she very naturally asked me if I suspected any particular person. I answered her candidly that I did ; but that, in the absence of anything like proof, I should not be justified in naming anyone. I assured her, however, that I would use the most strenuous efforts to obtain the proof I wanted. Before leaving her, I remarked in a casual sort of way— " I suppose Air. Ronald is at the head of affairs during his father's absence ?" " Well," she began, with evident reluctance to say anything against her son, " Ronald is of a very peculiar disposition. He seems to live quite within himself, as it were, and takes no interest in anything. As a matter of fact, I see very little of bim, for he usually spends his evenings from home, and does not return until late. The greater part of the day he keeps to his rooms. I am snre I am quite concerned about him at times." It fell to my lot to solve this mystery a week later. I shadowed hiin to a house situated in a cul de sac in the very heart of the city of London. I ascertained the house was in the occupation of a club consisting of Anglo Indians. The premises were in charge of a Hindoo and his wife, and the members of the club met on an average five nights a week. All this was so much more mystery, but it was.precisely in accord with the theory I had been working out in my own mind. The next afternoon I went to the house, and the door was opened to ray knock by the Hindoo woman, who was a mild-eyed, sad-looking little creature; I asked her if she could give me some particulars of the club that was held there, and she informed me that it was known as " The Indian Dreamers' Club." But beyond that scrap of information she did not seem disposed to go. " You had better comeAvhen my husband is here," she said, thereby giving me to understand that her husband was absent. But as I deemed it probable that she might prove more susceptible to my persuasive influences than her husband, I asked her if she would allow me to see over the premises. She declined to do this until displayed before her greedy eyes certain gold coins of the realm, which proved too much for her cupidity, and she consented to let me go inside. The entrance - hall was carpeted with thick, massive carpet, and the walls were hung with black velvet. A strange, sickening odour pervaded the air. I passed through a curtained doorway into an exten- sive apartment that ran the whole depth of the building. Daylight being excluded, tbe light was obtained from a large lamp of blood-coloured glass, and which depended from the centre of the ceiling. There was also a niche at each end of the room, where a lamp of the old Roman pattern burnt. The walls of the room were hung with purple velvet curtains, and the ceiling was also draped with the same material, while the floor was covered with a rich Indian carpet into which the feet sank. In the centre of the room was a table covered with velvet, and round the room were most luxurious couches. The same sickly odour pervaded this remarkable chamber, which was like a tomb in its silence. On the velvet on one side of the room was inscribed in letters of gold this sentence: " T« DREAM IS TO LIVK ! DREAM ox, FOE TO AWAKEN IS TO 1)IK ! While still engaged in examining the room a bell rang, and instantly the Hindoo woman became greatly excited, for she said it was her husband, and that he would be so angry if lie found me that she would not be responsible for the consequences. She therefore thrust me into a recess. Nothing could have happened better, for I was resolved to remain in my place of concealment till I had solved the mystery of the club. The Indian woman had told me the members of the club met at seven o'clock. As the hour drew near the door opened and the husband of the woman came in. He was a tall, ptiwi.-riiil, fierce-looking m«*n, wearing a tui'bau aud Uie^d in iuUj^u He placed three or iour small lighted lamps o« the table, also a number of quaint IndUn: drinking cups, which I recognised from the lescription of those that ..had been stolen from the Alanor a year or so previously, together with twelve Magnificent hookahs. These preporations eonaeleted, he retired, and a quarter-of-an-hour later he returned and wound up a large musical box which 1 had not noticed, owing to its being concealed behind a curtain. The box began to play muffled and plaintiye music. A few minutes; later, and the Indian once more appeared. This time he wore a sort of dressing-gown or some rich material braided with gold. He walked, backwards, and following him in single file were twelve men, the first being Ronald Odell. Five of them were men of colour ; three of the others were half-castes, t.he rest were whites. But they all had the languid, dreamy appearance which characterised Odell. who, as I was to subsequently learn,was their leader and president. They ranged themselves round the table silently as ghosts; and, without a word, Ronald Odell handed a key to the Indian, who proceeded to unlock a chest; and took therefrom the skull goblet which bad been carried off from Colonel Odell's " Treasure Chamber " by—could there any longer be a doubt ?—his own son. The skull, which was provided with two gold handles, and rested on gold claws,was placed on the table before the president, who poured into it the contents of two small bottles which were given to him by the attendant, who took them from the chest. He then stirred the decoction up with a long-handled silver spoon of very rich design and workmanship, and which I recognised, from the description that had been given to me, as one that had been taken from the Colonel's collection. As this strnnge mixture was stirred, the sickening, overpowering odour that I had noticed on first entering the place became so strong as to almost overcome me, and I felt as if I should suffocate. But I struggled against the feeling as well as I could. The president next poured a small portion of the liquor into each of the twelve cups that had been provided, and as he raised his own to his lips he said— " Brother dreamers, success to our club ! Alay your dreams be sweet and long !" The others bowed, but made no response, and each man drained the draught, which I guessed to be some potent herbal decoction, for producing sleep. Then each man rose and went to a couch, and the attendant handed him a hookah, applied a light to the bowl, and from the smell that arose it was evident the-pipes were charged with opium. As these dragged opium smokers leaned back on the luxurious couches, the concealed musical-box continued to play its plaintive melodies. A drowsy languor pervaded the room, and affected me to such extent that I felt as if I must be dreaming, and that the remarkable scene before my eyes was a dream vision that would speedily fade away. One by one the pipes fell from the nerveless grasp of the smokers, and were removed by the attendant. And when the last man had sunk into insensibility, the Indian filled a small cup with some of the liquor from the skull goblet, and drained it off. Then he changed a pipe with opium, aud, coiling himself "up on an ottoman, he began to smoke, until he, like the others, yielded to the soporific influences of the drugf and the opium and went to sleep. My hour of triumph had come. I stepped from my place of concealment, feeling faint and strange, and all but overcome by an irresistible desire to sleep. I managed to stagger to the table, seize the goblet and the spoon, and make my way to the door. As I gained the passage the, Hindoo woman confronted me, for she was about to enter tbe room. | " iVhat is the meaning of this?" she/ cried, as she endeavoured to bar my, passage. I " Stand back !" I said, sternly. " I am a detective-officer. These tilings have been stolen, and I am about to restore them to their rightful.owner." She manifested supreme distress, but recognised her powerlessness. Getting to the thoroughfare 1 hailed a cab, and drove home with my prize, - and the following morning I telegraphed to Egypt to an address the Colonel had given me, informing him that I had recovered the goblet. The same day I went down to the Manor at Esher, and had an interview with Mrs. Odell. I felt, in the interest of her son, that it was my duty to tell her ali i had learnt the previous night. She was terribly distressed, but stated that she had suspected for some time that her son was given to opium smoking, though she had no idea he carried the habit to such a remarkable extreme. She requested me to retain possession of the goblet and the spoon until her husband's return, and, in the meantime, she promised to take her weak and misguided son to task, and to have the secret passage in the wall effectually stopped up. I should mention that I had managed to save H small quantity of the liquor that was in the goblet when I removed- it from the club table; and I sent this to a celebrated analytical chemist for analysis, who pronounced it to be a very powerful and peculiar narcotic, made from a combination of Indian herbs with which he was not familiar. The denouement has yet to be. recorded. A few days later Ronald Odell, after drugging himself as usual, was found dead on one of the couches at the club. This necessitated an inquest, and the verdict was that he had died from a narcotic, but whether taken with the intention of destroying life or merely to produce sleep there was no evidence to show. Although I had no evidence to offer, I was firmly convinced in my own mind that the poor weak fellow had committed suicide, from a sense of shame at the discovery I had made. Of course, after this tragic affair, and the exposure it entailed, the Iudian Dreamers' Club was broken up, and all its luxurious appointments were sold by auction and the members dispersed. One of the rules was that the members of the club should never exceed twelve in number. In the course of six months Colonel Odell returned from Egypt and, though much cut up by the death of his son, was exceedingly gratified at the recovery of the goblet which the misguided youth had no doubt purloined under the impression that it was useless in his father's treasure-room, but would adorn the table of the Dreamers' Club, of which he was president. The motto of the club was singularly appropriate in his case : " Dream on, for to awaken "is to die." He had awakened from his dream and passed into a state where dreams perplex not.— Abridged from the Strand Magazine.
