TBB TALE OF r£HB (VITGJi OF BNDOB. Of all Bible stories cone is mora popular with children than the tale of tho Witch of Endor. On wet Sunday aftoruuoos the oioat admired plate in the folio Bible is that which shows Saul falling forward on th- earth, and the witch woman shrinking back in astonish ment and awe, and the white bearded, shadowy figure of the Prophet rising up from the silence oi Sheol. The ttoniuu of Kndor u beloved by controversial infancy, just launched, unconsciously, on the stream of Biblical criticism and pleading against the verdiot of parent or narae for the existence of ghosts and witchsj. The early syllogism runs thus : The Bible is true. The Bible) says there were a witch and a ghoat. Therefore, there are ghosts and witches. Wd often meet with worse arguments in later life, as when Science- avers : .' I don't tako any interest in the questiori,' with the suppressed inference, ' therefore there is nothing in it but nonsense.' Our instructors in our infancy, however, met our logic with pleas more subllc, though net wholly satisfying. Thus. 'Theie were witches, or at least there was a witch, but that was before the coming of the Gospel. So now run away and see if yon can find s ripe strawbery.' Thue was the daring metaphysical specula tion of infancy diverted into practical re searches. Or again, the answer woulrl bo, ' Saul was a bad man, and therefore the dpvil was allowed to deceive him in the shape of Samuel.' ' But it does not say anything about tho devil, and the ghost's propbeoy camo true' ' Oh, no doubt thut wus per mitted for wise reasons. So now run away,' ut supra. — Andrew Lang, in the Contempor ary Review.
