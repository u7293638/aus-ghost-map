Flotsam and Jetsam. The Wind and the Moon. GEORGE MACDONALD. SAID the Wind to the Moon, "I will blow you out. You stare In the air Like a ghost in the chair; Always looking what I am about. I hate to be watched ; 1 will bjow you out. The Wind blew hard and out went the Moon. Bo deep, On aheip Of clouds, to sleep, Down lay the Wind, and slumbered soon- Mattering low, "I've done for that Moon." He turned in hU bed ; she was there again I On high In the sky, With her one ghost eye, The Moon shone white and alive and plain. Said the Wind " I will blow you out again." The Wind blew hard, and the Moon grew dim, "With my sledge And ray wedge I have knocked off her edge I If I only blow right fierce and grim, The creature will soon be dimmer than dim." He blew and he blew, and she thinned to a thread, "One puff More's enough To blow her to snuff I One good puff more where the last was bred, And glimmer, glimmer, glum will go the thread I He blew a great blast, and the thread was gon/s; In the air Nowhere Was a moonbeam bare; Far off and harmless the shy stars shone ; Sow andoattain the Moon waa gonel The Wind he took to his revels once more; On down, In town, Like a merry mad clown, He leaped and halloed with whistle and roar, " What's tfeatr The glimmering thread onoe mom I He flaw In a rage—he danced and blew; But In vain Was the pain Of his bunting brain ; For still the broader the moon-wrap grew 1b» broad*' be swelled his big cheeks and blew.
