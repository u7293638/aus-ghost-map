TILE V.R.C. SPRING MIEETING. DERBY DAY. (From our own Correspondent.) On Saturday the greatest Australian meeting was inaugurated at Fleming ton, and a large concourse of people assembled to witness the day's pro ceedings. Though many of our leading colonists are away in England, the presence of so large a number of distinguished visitors, compensated for their absence. Sir Henry Loch, and his guests, the governors of New South Wales, South Australia and Tasmania, were present as was also Admiral Tryon, and his oflicers. The programme opened with the Melbourne Stakes, and concluding with the Coburg Stakes, a grand day's racing was made up. The following are the results of the various events" ...... MELBOURNE STAKES.
