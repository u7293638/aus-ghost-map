SThe Haunted House of the Black Swamp. — |;A Walking Skeleton That Told . / the Story of a Foul Murder. > g : f t " Talking about ghost stories," said Mayor ; Ward. " I had aa experience about thirty- six years aga which his haunted me all my life, and while I am ready to admit that I don't believe in the alleged appearance hero on earth of the disembodied spirits of the dead, yet, as I said before, I have an '/experience in that direction sufficiently thrilling to make mo nn ardent believer in //every story of supernatural appearanoes that .. .may be put in circulation." Being pressed to relate his peculiar ex- perience, the Mayor car.Eented to do so, pre- . . facing his narrative by saying : In 1853, when I had my interview with a ghost, what is now the great oil region of \- Wood County was a vast marsh known everywhere as the Black Swamp. The few , people who lived along the bordero of this /swamp were of u decidedly shady oharacter. IhievoB, murderers, counterfeiters, and desperadoes generally formed the hulk of the . population. lu these days, in a lonely and ifuinfrequcnted spot, far from any habitation in the Black Swamp, was what was known aa T-.kbe Woodbury Mansion, or "The Haunted ; House of the Black Swamp." It was an unusually large and old-fashioned dwelling, ."'.built of great oak logo. At what period it was created tradition fails to tell, but aside ;y from the story connected with it there is little doubt thai it was built in the year 1820, or /.about then: but it changed owners so often j/ihai it is even difficult to tell who owned it i at the time of which I speak. Mr, Duncan, now dead, and one Mr. Gibson were, at one time, strangely mixed up in the ownership, bat who claimed the ;/ premises when I had my adventure no one ; knows. The house itetli has long since di3- h 'appeared, and the lands (surrounding it are ! how in possession of the Syndicate Oil and Fuel Oo., and oil wells innumerable are ' everywhere in and about where the old .1' tumble- down mansion onoe stood as a melancholy reminder of one of the blackest //4eeds ever perpatrated by the wickedness of : . man — a deed of blood. ///About the year 1840 the house was j .icaeupied by one John Gleves, who, according i ; to common report, murdered a pedlar by the I 'name of Syms. Cleves, though suspected cf | the crime, was never apprehended or ; vpumshed for the murder, although he after- ! J'wards served a term in the penitentiary, and, j /alter the expiration of his sentence, was long i a disreputable citizen of Toledo, but is no?/ ; 'dead. : This murder at the old Woodbury house | i'ieoon established in the minds of the whale 'cdmmunity the reputation that the house . X7r h bannton o rid Tm«.rtv vipyniins whn vnant tjigbts in the plaao came away with the mast blood-curdling Btoriea of what they had seen : ||and heard on the premises. ('. f At . that time I wan a young man not /'afflicted with feeble oournge; ou the aontrary, /I laughed at the wild yarns, and told those .relating them that there was nothing but /imagination in the whole business. A friend f/di. mine, John Stows, shared with me this /opinion, and being bantered to test the . matter for ourselves, determined to do so, ; .So, on the night of May 15, 1853, a data ; v' never to be forgotten by me as long as j /.memory hold3 her plac3. Stowe and I j alked to the old Woodbury mansion to .Spend the night, the intent being to satisfy yourselves aa to the truth or falsity, of fch3 -. many stories in circulation regarding what could nightly ba seen and heard. As the r 'building was tenantless, and had been for /'. years, there was no ono to deny us admission' i'Whea we entered the door. It was, rapidly ' /approaching miduighfe, and wo had bean /talking for an hour or more, when wa /..were Htartled from the quiet reverie into '/.which we had fallen by the appearance of a //ghostly-looking object in the shape and form /.of a human skeleten. We were seated on the / floor at the time, bat sprang to our feet as the /'ipectra entered the room. I'v/ ' 'It seemed to me like the boneB of a human //being stripped of flesh, and was horrible Bnd /terrifying in its apparent reality. I was the '/first to recover sslf-pcssession, and I ordered ./the apparition t& stand, at the samei time ; (demanding to know the object of its vieit. '. But the phantom did not pay the least 'attention to me, and oonffnued to advanae ' towards where I stood, -at stopped in the //centre of the floor directly in front of me, S|:ow8 having, according to a previous under- /Btauding, taking his position in an opposite /corner of the room. The only light wa had /.was the faint glimmering afforded by the /burning of a few pieces of boards in the old fireplace. // As the phantom advanced towards me I ' raised one of my pistols, carefully elevating it on a level with his breast, and fired with as much steadiness as I was able ; bnt it faltered Dot, and as quickly as possible I discharged /another barrel of my weapon, but it had no .more effect upon the apparition than so much '/wind, and it continued to advanca until it came within reaching distance of me, when it raised it3 bony arm in the direotion where :I stood, and motioned as if to attract my -attention. Daring these few moments of /suspensa I closely scrutinised the figure, ' determined, if possible, to satisfy my mind /regarding its mysterious actions. Making a signal to Stowe, we exchanged places, mean- while keeping an eye on the object before | me. I must here oonfess my inability to ex. | plain, satisfactorily, anything concsrning the / Singular object. Stowe asserted to his dying day that it had no flesh, and that he could h see nothing about it bat bone3, which he I heard rattle when I fired. | The ghost, or whatever it was, talked to- lewards the fireplace, turned around, and again passed back to the centre of the room, occupying the same position, with its face in / the direction towards me. It again raised its hand, and as it did so uttered in a sepulchral voice the following words : I : " Give ear to me, and mark well the words that I shall- reveal to you. My name is /James Syms. I was born in Augusta, and was"— — 1/ I interrupted him here to inquire if he L was murdered in the bonce in which we were. | : talking, to which he replied : I j > " Ask me no questions." »-. The ghost continued his story : I/'.' " One evening in December, IS 11, 1 put up at this house, kept at the time by a man by rib9 name of Oleves. After returning to my I/room for the night, I was startled from sleep /some time after midnight by a blow on the l:jsidc of my head with a bludgeon in the hands I/of Oleves. I immediately sprang to my feet I "and attempted to grapple with my assailant, but in doing so received another blow upon l-my left temple. It was the blow that killed |/me, 'being dead before I Btruck the floor." |V> The spectre here showed his ekull, and true Fen o ugh it presented a large fracture. He '.continued : -/ " Upon the infliotion of the last blow my K/p'tiin stopped and all consciousness left mo. | /tfiiat moment ' I censed to exist, and the //transition of my spirit from the mundane to lifthe celestial sphere was sudden and sublime. I/My. assailant,. unaware that I had ceased to live, continued his blowB on my head. My ./purpose in appearing to you at this time is I- that I oan communicate through you to "the |;'/wiirid an account of my vile and bloody death, l;/ibat mankmd.rcny know my fate and abjbor fe'niy murderer/' You are commanded to write l/ito my grand-nephew, Gilmora Syms, of IvZColnmbnS, and acquaint. .him with the. par- pVtionlars cf my'doathj/anjf that it is my de&ira; /that my remains be taken up and receive the L proper rites of burial. I ra the spirit of tha | murdered Syms, whose iil to? ysers has //been in and abofct these promises. I have //wandered up and down the earth until relief | -came by communicating to you matters I;'b6rdening my mind. Through you the world l/will learn the nature of my foul and bloody l/death. I have near'v done. The hour is at iBjtand when I must /five you. Many persons Phaye seen, but darea not speak to me, and I lre not thejwerof until first spoken to by living man. Your courage has relieved my eoul, and now affords me peace." As be oeased speaking, tbe speotre extended towards me its bony hand, manifesting a i determination to shake hands, with whioh I complied, and as I grasped its fieBhlese grip a cold ohill suddenly paeBed over ma fchp.t caused my blood to freeze, aB it wore, in my warm veins. Thus band in haDd, ia locked, though loathed, embrace, front to front and face to face, I walked with the phantom soma yards from tha door to tbe open air. I was about to speak, when it turned its horrible face to me : " 1 must now retire. My moment lies como in which I must depart to that abode prepared for the spirits of all mankind. Farewell I L?t my eased spirit retire in peace. Remember well and forget not what I have told you."
