trial is entirely due. "BRICKISM!" " Up rose our hero with his darkling hair, And his complexion like a Babel brick." —Vide " Don Juan, junr.," by Byron's Ghost. Ye " bounding bricks" of Hobart Town, Who roam deserted streets at night, Pulling good people's signboards down, And putting ancient dames to fright; Has it occurred to you how mean, How vilely sneaking is such " sport," Or that the " c it " should come between You and your pranks if you are caught. Pray have you thought, if you can think, What degradation leads the way, When like vile thieves at night ye slink To acts you DARE NOT do by day. Nay, do not laugh,—no laugh can hide The vulgar bent of minds like yours, Such acts e'en Folly's self would chide, And scourging with a mne-tail-cnres. When next you shall consult your glass, Perchance you may discover the :, Nature has branded each as—ASS— It cannot be that you are MEN. TOBY.
