INDIAN SUPERSTITIONS. .The Bhattia women are very superstitious. .They believe in ghosts, demons, . and other supernatural beings; und to drive all these out of the house in the evening (for it is just before the lamps are lighted that all these evil spirits come into ' the house) a woman strikes a light and gads into each room and shows it in every dark corner, and the spirits, who are supposed to have a great dislike to any kind of light, go quietly out of the house. . Another oustom is that they will not eat until a portion of their food is set apart for tho cow, whom they all worship. " They believe that their food will turn into poison if this is not done ; and ono of tho women or a servant takes it out and gives it to a cow if . one iB in . sight, or leavos it on ono side of .tho road, But the, most unnatural euBtom that they hays is that they never iiso the name "mother" when speaking of or to .their own mother, but they call her Bhabhi, which meanB sister-in-law. Little childron, as well as grown up sons and daughters, call her so ; ' and tho sweet name'of " mother " is novor heard in their homes.' Again, a woman will never say. " my son," but in speaking of.him will say . " tho husband, or brother, or nephew of So-and-So." The first time a Bhattia woman says " my son " is aftor that son is dead. She believes that if she calls him so while he . liveB a certain goddess trill got so jealous of- her that sho will strike him dead at once.
