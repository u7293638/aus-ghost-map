A NEW TERRITORY. BY TELEMACHUS. TO BENDOC. I. And where is Bendoc? Once in a while, in a week or a fortnight, and amongst a thousand folks, we meet with a man who does not ask that question. "Bendoc," he says: "Ah, I remember. Went through there once with cattle, 20 years ago. A divil of a place ; never will be any good to any- body." Then one answers and says, " Is that so, indeed ; and why no good?" "All jungle and forest and scrub and rock country; just like South Gippsland, and twice as far away." Just like South Gippsland ; yes, where a few years of patient and intelligent human effort have made of the jungles and scrubs and swamps and forests, country rich and valuable as any on the hills of Ballarat or on the elder land on the fruitful weald of Kent. But most folks say, with a puzzled look— And where is Bendoc ? Where away from Melbourne? I will try and answer that question by-and-by, and will hope to do a little towards answering it in such a fashion as to aid in persuading our Government to take those bold and practical steps which really will secure to us "A New Territory." It was where away from Cooma first, and the answer was, " By Nimitybelle, by Bom- bala, by Delegate, by —. Ah, that is a question quite beyond us, but when you get to Delegate little doubt you will find some- body to put you through." And so away I went from Cooma, and on a Sunday morning, but not on what any reason- able man, Jew or Christian, would call a Sabbath day's journey. Oh! for the worst of railways again. Oh! for the highest fares. Oh! for the slowest of slow trains, and the hardest of cushions and the roughest of buffers and springs. A loaf about the still town till noon, and then a rattle and a jangle down the street, and behold the fear- ful thing in red and yellow, all bespattered with mire and clay, mail- bags and luggage stowed within, one man on the box and one spare seat beside him. No hurry about any- thing. Driver rubs his tobacco carefully, and fills his pipe. Manager, coming along to see the last passenger off, collects fares, and then, with crack and "yup" and jingle and jangle again, away we go. Out across the rolling downs, still brown and grey, along a tolerably hard track, which has never been spoiled by any road-making ; on and on through a country which really seems to have been destined from the very beginning of things for the production and maintenance of sheep, and sheep only. Attempts at farming there have been, but they seem to have been suc- cessful chiefly in dotting the country with ruined or miserable homesteads, and the breeding of turkeys. In old days this land was the natural home of the wild turkey, the turkey bustard as I believe he is more pro- perly called. They have almost been killed out now—I saw but two on all our travels but the good old Christmas turkey has in- creased, and thriven in marvellous fashion. You see them in droves, in hundreds, all about the country; safe, apparently, as the sheep : fattening, as they told me, on the thistle, and which certainly is plentiful enough. But strange as it may seem, in a fortnight of travel I do not remember to have seen one of them in that other place where they are more to be desired. On the table, to wit, where alone the turkey acquires dignity and grace, and is clipped and trimmed of all that in life made him ridiculous and absurd. I heard some folks driving a bargain about a mob of a hundred and fifty, and the price ranged between two and three shillings a head. Not prohibitory, one would imagine, even for an article of everyday ordinary diet. But somehow it is not proper to eat turkey in the bush. They had rather kill you a sheep and cut out a chop before the flesh had fairly ceased quivering. On we rolled, on we rattled, up hill and down, all "o'er the downs so free," meeting nobody but the return coach, and pulling up to yarn with him for the space of half an hour. It was nearly three when Nimitybelle came into view, set high on a hill or a broad, rock-strewn plateau near four thousand feet above sea-level. It is a hamlet about which there seems to be some life. It is the begin- ning, in fact, of a better country, which slopes away fast to east and north, to the inestimably rich and valuable lands of Bega and that broad coastal tract which runs quite up to Illawarra. One is absolutely startled in pulling up at the hotel at Nimitybelle. Here is a great brick structure, with balcony supported on solid Doric columns, evidence of roominess, of grandeur, of something quite apart from the inn of the village or the shanty of the bush. How came it into existence here? And what is the meaning of that other queer structure yonder, that squat block tower? Is it a mausoleum, a monument to the de- parted aborigines? It is a queer country this. The traveller from Victoria has to learn that for many years there were no trades unions, no fixed rates of wages, no wages at all at times excepting rum and tobacco, and it good deal of settlement of a very erratic sort. The story of the hotel is very similar to that of the old Rum Hospital. The man who built it got a few good tradesmen about him, and paid them always ¡n rum, so that it did not cost him much. And of the black tower, which seemed to promise a legend weird and wonderful as that which Longfellow found in his round tower on the coast, it was the work of an old German who settled there, and with infinite pains raised it up, not for commemoration of any sort, but to accom- modate windsails to furnish power for the grinding of wheat. He set up his sails, and set them going also, but on one merry day they scared the horses of some local magnate driving past, and local authority made an order for their removal. Now, therefore, the poor German sits and mourns at the base of his sailless tower, and finds consolation only in his fruit trees, apple and pear and cherry and plum growing thick all round about. It was 4 by the clock when we moved again, and our party had increased by five. The coach was full; in fact, and there remained 40 miles of a journey to be ac- complished. Only 40 miles! '"When shall we arrive?" "Couldn't undertake to land you before midnight," says the driver ; and he is just very nearly as good as his word. We spin along gaily enough for a while. We wind along the sides of lightly- forested mountains ; we look down into long valleys, where little creeks trickle, and a few sheep and cattle graze. We climb hard hills, and rattle or grind harshly down sharp pinches. We get a cup of tea at a roadside house about 6, and then we are asked to get out and walk down a hill, where Ned Devine would travel easily and safely with a coach and seven and five-and- twenty passengers. And then it begins to get dusky and gloomy and inexpressibly sad all round about, and by-and-by we halt and shiver for about 20 minutes at a wretched roadside stable ; then creep into the lightless hole of the coach's interior, five men and one woman, and sit down to weather it out like jockeys to a hard finish. This is not exaggeration in any sense—there really is no light in the coach. The coach- man wants all the available lamps to drive by, for the night is dark, and promises rain. And we have about three hours to endure of this sort of thing—swinging along through the utterly unknown, jolting and rolling and bumping, snoring and sleeping and growling —a merry fellow making efforts for a while to cheer us with a song. Memories of rattling across bridges, of rushing through creeks, of toiling painfully up long hills, of halting for a quarter of an hour at a post-office, beside which stood a little church where the choir were doing an after-service practice. Fresh young voices and bright young faces out in the dark and lonely place. Thence onward nothing of any moment except discomfort, till the wheels began to rattle somewhat more mer- rily down a long descent, and we were con- scious of a rough ford on an apparently big river, and then of a sharp run through the streets of a considerable township, and the welcome shout, " Now then, Bombala." The day breaks cloudy and cold in Bom- bala, and the little town is not perhaps seen at its best. Yet it is pleasantly situated out on the edge of the downs, half surrounded, by a good, bright, ever-flowing river. Its various institutions are well housed and accommodated. Stores, banks, and hotels all prosperous, and a hum of increas- ing industry arising leagues around. Here also is for the first time felt the keen and vital interest in that great question of the Alternative, or, as they say, the "New National Railway Line." Bankers and store- keepers, squatters and settlers, come in all eager and burning with information. They know the value of their district, its rich soil, its abundant rainfall, its magnificent climate, and though they are well content they feel themselves imprisoned in it. Between us and you, they say, between our produce and your markets, between our poor life and all the richness of your civilisation, between all our possibilities and the much- desired goal of prosperity, there is a great gulf fixed, or bridged only by that miserable coach service. We could produce hundreds of tons of butter, but it is of no use. A two days' journey over such a road would ruin any packages in summer weather, and in winter no transit would be possible. We could produce thousands of tons of bacon and ham equal to anything im- ported, instead of which we drive our pigs to Bega, where they are fattened in the corn- fields, and so killed and cured, or shipped to the factories of Sydney and Melbourne. They tell me of estates round about which are even now milking hundreds of cows, and turning out magnificent cheese, because that may be stored and conveyed to market when the roads are good. And "Look at Bibenluke," they say—Bibenluke, a beauti- ful estate, the property of a distinguished military officer of New South Wales. It lies just outside the town on the Cooma-road. Bibenluke I saw returning, and must freely admit that it is a beautiful and much-to- be-desired estate. Its thousands of acres of flats are rich as any on the Murray, mid per- manently watered by strong clear creeks. Its hills are the soundest, healthiest grazing country, and in many instances seem fur- nished by nature with just sufficient timber for shelter. Its fat bullocks have topped the markets in Sydney and in Melbourne, but are now chiefly driven down to Eden and shipped to Tasmania. Yet Bibenluke is only a natural pasturage for cattle, well worked, thriftily managed, the proprietor's repre- sentative, Mr. Edwards, being one of the most capable and energetic men of the dis- trict. I would only ask, Should it not be something more of a home and abiding-place for human beings? and get answer, " Perhaps it should, perhaps it will be—when the rail- way comes." I must thank Mr. Jonas, auctioneer and newspaper proprietor, of Bombala, for much local information respecting this railway pro- posal, but, desiring always rather to speak of the things I have seen than of those I have heard, must thank him chiefly for an introduction to Mr. Newton—Mr. Newton, a pastoralist and enterprising speculator of the district, in whose care and under whose guidance I travelled over all the line in New South Wales, and crossed the border into our own colony, and journeyed to and fro about Bendoc, and came right along the surveyed lines, to those falls of Croajingalong up which the " Alternative Line " must some day run. We left the town while a smart and pro- longed thunder-shower was coming down, the reason being that it is better to drive in the rain than in the dark, at least on bad roads ; and we were soon out in a bush which, like many speci- mens of mankind, has no features worth mentioning. Pleasant enough if one is in a pleasant mood and the weather is fine, but otherwise good for yarning in, for telling or listening to old hush stories, or gathering up information from one who has matter of that sort to dispose of. Mr. Newton has just re- turned from the Bega district, where he has been judging at the annual show, and one feels, as he talks, that many men in Victoria, and of divers sorts and conditions, would do well to go and visit Bega, for there, evidently, is agriculture of a high sort. There was the beginning, and there is still the best develop- ment of the new and scientific dairying busi- ness of Australia. There, also—and more important than all else, in my estima- tion—is the beginning of the end of all the rural labour troubles of Australia. Which is not in unionism of one side or the other, but in the proper pro- vision for the reasonable wants of reason- able human creatures. On the great cheese factories and dairy farms there, says Mr. Newton, they are beginning really to under- stand that it is not good for man to be alone; that even at some considerable outlay of capital and sacrifice of profit it is well to encourage permanent local settle- ment. Folks there are building comfortable cottages, and fencing in garden plots, for people who will marry and settle down to work, and they feel that if steps such as these had been taken a quarter of a century ago, and had been accompanied or preceded by the importation of people of the right sort, agricultural and domestic labour troubles would, so far as they are concerned, have been things of the past. We agree, of course, as all folks except utter dolts must agree, that there is no comparison between Bega dairy-farming and central Queensland squatting. And yet, strange to say, we agree, as I think most folks who make impartial investigation will also agree, that one main root of inadequate domestic supply, even in Melbourne, and of ram- pageous unionism in central Queensland, may be traced to the same source. " Heigho ! says Roley ;" and where are we now, and where are the horses going? The horses are right, though the road is very vague, and there is a dreary bush around us, through which the ruin is whispering. And it is a sad evening once more. But ere it has quite closed, while the magpie, still chortling, warbles in some snug shades, and the crow utters his last low curse at the infernal weather, before the ghostly night-fowl have begun to flit about, and the 'possums to squeak and gibber worse than sheeted ghosts, behold a light, a last gate, and then the homestead of the Newton family. Light, and music, and flowers, and the company of a half-score of children at all stages of growth within. Life even in a dull bush, with such surroundings, is not all to be despised. But when the morning came even that bush was not altogether dull or dreary or monotonous, for the mists were covering all but the bold features of the face of the earth, and the risen sun was smiting them, so that they, shook abroad into separate silvery masses, and spun up- wards in fibres and threads and glittering webs, for which the grosser substances of earth afford no comparison. And, more over, there were flowers all abloom and dew-bespangled in a broad garden, and fruit trees well laden beyond, and cattle bells a-tinkling, and magpies singing, and children's voices at play. And as we drive away again, an hour later on, the dew was still on wattle and gum and fern and tall grass. And even the by-roads seemed full of well-dressed folks; for it was the day of the Delegate show, and we were in duty bound to look in and assist at that function, and to take a peep at the last little village of the New South Wales side, nestling in a very pleasant valley at the foot of the great mountain which they call Delegate Hill. It is a very pleasant valley, running away near to the border of Victoria. Open, sunny, rich, well watered, but, in a broad sense, all unused, because too far from a market, and because also chiefly the estate of an absentee proprietor. The show was like other little shows. Horses and cattle and pumpkins mid pigs, flowers and fruits and napery and drapery. All the men and the women and the boys and girls of the district assembled, and a good deal of flirting and a great deal of drinking going on. Yet, nevertheless, the show detained us too long that day, und we knew it would be dark long ere we reached the hostel at which we proposed to rest that night, far up in the mountains. And what then but another disappointment? "House is full," was the answer, " full as a beehive. Couldn't find you a place anywhere, not even in kitchen or billiardroom or stable or hay- loft." We made, therefore, a detour involving a loss of about twenty miles, and found a welcome with some good old colonial people at a small station called Craigie, and in the morning we laid in a stock of apples from a garden of the olden time, and yoked up and drove again towards the New Territory of Victoria proper, which to all but a score or two of Victorians is utterly unknown.
