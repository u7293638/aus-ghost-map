THE MYSTERY OF THE TOWER. A TALE OF THRILLING INTEREST, BY HELEN CORWIN PIERCE. CHAPTER. XXV. , Captain Dunning went all the way to Columbus to try and find Kenrick Prince; the writer of the letter that had been found in the cell of Bick Halsey, after his escape; from prison. He hoped to get from Mr Prince soma information regarding his missing priso ner. < ' He was most anxious to secure Halsey, both because it was hij duty, and still more, because he worshipped his beautiful yonng daughter, his only child, and wished to save her, in spite of herself, from her in fatuation for a villain and criminal, whose brutal behaviour towards her was deserving ofthelash. Captain Dunning was. by nature one of the gentlest, kindest, and most generous of men. But he hated the wretch, Bick Hal sey, with all the, bitterness he could feel, with a vindictiveness that could not be re pressed. ''- r ■-.■ He would willingly have given every thing be possessed to have had. Halsey in his power. Of course his trip to Columbus was of no avail, and he returned to the penitentiary disheartened, to ittend to matters requir ing attention. Then he intended to pay another visit to Bcellen Hall, and mako a fresh effort to see Kenrick Prince. Meanwhile the country was being well searched for Halsey. Large rewards wire offered for his apprehension, and officers irere looking in every direction for the criminal. As the reader has doubtless surmised, Kenrick Prince was not dead, bnt merely sufiVring under the deep and baleful in fluence of the powerful drug Dr Varle had given him. On the night following his seeming de cc&se;, Doctor Varle, at the de*d of night, removed him, still unconscious, from the Hall. He had solemnly promised Belle to take his unfortunate charge to some secure spot where he would be faithfully and carefully looked after, receiving every comfort and luxury save liberty, and he had received from her the large sum of five thousand dollars as payment for acting according to instructions. There was a reward offered for Bick *• alsey, five hundred dollars by the govern ment, and a thousand dollars by Oapt iin Dunning- An infamous thought came to Dr Varle and he resolved to act upon it. : He waited in safe quarters with his vic tim until Captain Dunning returned to his duties,and then he called upon him on the business. ... Captain Dunning did not receive him very cordially. He knew the doctor's re putation too well. But at mention of Halsey he became in terested. "If 1 could put you positively on Halsey's track—if lam the means of putting him in yoar possession again,.what will you- give me ? A' paltry thousand or fifteen hundred dollars is no temptation to me. What will you give me?" ." X will double the reward 1 have already offered." Varle shook his head. "That won't do. 1 shall have to got out of the country as fast ss I can go. My life will not be s*fe after I have betrayed him to you. I muse have five thousand " Cuptain Dunning hesitated—not because of the money, but he mistrusted the pale doctor. "If I could be sure—" he began. '* I will make you sure—satisded, before I ask yon for a cent of the money," Varle promptly replied, ; Dunning eyed him doubtingly and with keenness. " Very well," he said slowly, "do it" " When will you have the money ready forme?" " I will give you a cheque at any time yon please." "That won't do. I must have green backs." " I can get them at a few hours' notice.' " Will you have them ready to-morrow evening r" Captain Dunning agreed. " Xow then," said Varle, " I know you are a man ot honor. You will deal with me on the square, and not attempt any underhand means of learning my secret or securing my man ? ' *' You know I will not," Dunning said, flushing. " I will tell you how I am able to bring Halsey to you. He came to me, a very .sick man, soon after his escape. He had been hurt in some sort of a railroad smash, and fever set in. He has been delirious part of the time, and he is queer yet. I shall put him under the influence of a nar cotic to bring him here. He must go into the hospital at first" Dnnnisg listened in breathless excite ment, white to the lips. " Was he alone ?" " Yes, when he came to me," " Did he say anything about his wife ? Was she with him when he was hurt? Perhaps she was killed." "I don't think so. He talked about her in his delirium. 1 guess he was running away from her when the smash caught him." " Served him right Pity he didn't die," Captain Dunning muttered, bitterly. " He is pretty near it, I tell you." And so Captain Dunning thought when Dr Varle brought up the pretended Kick Halsey on the following evening. He had been prepared for a change, but .not for beholding anything so pitiful as this wasted object, which had to 1m brought inside the prison walls of the prison on a bed, and who looked at him out of dull and unrecognising eyes, with a sadly pathetic glance* ■  Varle had not given him a narcotic after all. He found that his unhappy prisoner was already too passive, with suffering, hope lessness and despair, to cause him any new trouble. Captain Sunning was so agitated, over the affair that be could scarcely contain y.T ? «i>if l , • .Not a doubt had he that this wasted and pitfjul wreck of a handsome man was the villui.* who deserved prison bars, and whom he so bated—the resemblance was so won derful. He was shocked at tho change, the awful change made by terrible illness and suffer ing—the eyefl especially held such depths of gloom and woe. "He lookßas though he had been through something very dreadful," he said to Varle. " 1 never saw a man so altered." The doctor's colorless lips twitched a little. . " Yes, he has been pretty bad," he said. " He would have died had it not been for me." j Still, though the cap'ain had been up to the last moment smpicions of some cheat, he was satisfied the moment he saw the ■m.n. . ■,-, ■'.• '■ ' ''■ He bent eagerly over him.  , " Where is my daughter; Halsey ?" he asked. '• Where did you leave her ?" ■ Keniick Prince stared at him.' ■ If Captain Dunning had only been able to read the terrible tragedy written in those dart, unhappy eyes. " My name is not Halsey," the (rick man said, wearily. " 1 don't know what you mean. What place is thU, pleasa F" Dunning looked at the false and wicked -aotior. ..- .■-'.. . "How changed he is I Even his voice is altered. And his' eyej «re strangely •different r \- r. ,-. j 1 . i •■; '*Itold you. he was queer yet," Varle laid, plaoidly. '• His brain was injured. 1 don't think ho will ever be the same man again. He ma; never entirely recover bin souses." "1 think everybody, himself included, would be better oil," rep.ied Dunning. Doctor Varle received the reward of his .villainy—the promised sum of money—and departed. Ho was not altogether hippy. » " I have been mixed np in soino pretty tough things in tbe course of my life," he said to himself," " but 1 don t think 1 ever did anything go mean as this, if it had been the real Halsey—that sneering Jas; per Prince—l should bo happy; " only,", he added, clinching his teeth, ."I should have got Belle afu>r me in that case. She will rage about this affair if she over finds out, but n ithing to what she would do if 1 betrayed the other. Odd, how she car keep on loving such a scoundrel, and he so, mean to her, too. Oh.ithes* women! But; I made a satisfactory deal, in that trans action, anyhow." : A month had gone by since Madame Bud's funeral . ... ...  ; Jasper and Belle were {nil of wonder that; thay .heard no more from~l)unuing, and, in secret, Belle speculated greatly what "had become of Varle. She wrotato him at various places, but got no answer. *" At last she received a letter. Ho wrote her'ihat Kenrick f nicer was Idoad—that h blunder had been committed somehow.ana he had not been able to bring him out of the drugged trance-in whioa* he''Kad' been removed from the Hall. . '■ . Belle's horror almost overpowered her. She felt in the first shock as though there was nothing she would not have done to have brought the dead to life. ■'"'■ ■■ ■ ;'.>'J She had intended to use his pretended death as a strong weapon in her scheme of vengeance against Jasper,'but her plans had recoiled upon Herself. If she had known that, instead of being in his grave, he was, by a strange perverse fate, fallen into hi) wicked brother's prison cell, how would she have felt then t " 1 am sorry he is dead," she murmured, "it is too horrible. 1 feel almost as if 1 bad murdered him. How could that old villain have blundered ?" But not a suspicion of the truth ever entered hot mind. - . " This complicates matters again," she mused. " While Kenrick lived, 1 had the upper hand of Hid if he should try any time to get rid of me, and marry Sibyl frince. But now " A spasm of piin crossed the lovely lace, as she went on, "Why do' 1 love him so? Could any thing, 1 wonder, mako me hate him 1 As he talked to Varle, that time, I thought it had put an end to uiy love, but that wa§ a mistake. Despising him, holding him in thorough contempt, yet the lore remains just tbe same.

Belle's hot temper flashed white in her face again; but the controlled it, only re marking, with sweet sarcasm— " Of course, it is much euier to get rid of a real wife than a pretended one. But let fair Sibyl go for tbe present. Mrs Bick Hal sey hat to be disposed of the first thing." Jasper made a movement of impatience. Belle laughed She liked to provoke him. '•It seems necessary,' she went on, ''in orier to stop theae wagging ton goes, that Lucy Venner should leave. She Bhill go." . Jasper looked at her excitedly. He n> so taken by surprise, be did not know whether be wanted her to go or not. Belle's clever, sharp brain was very useful to him just now, but her rule was rather an iron one. •' You don't mean it I" he said. ,•' 1 do, Lucy Venner shall go, and Dorcas Bud shall come in her place." •".Whois Dorcas Buel!"

For a moment the beautiful, foolish, loving ■romao was thrilled Co her proud, paoinoate heart by the worJs. But she knew him so well. He had deceived her to often. " What do you call a few days V she ajkoi, with an angry sneer. " Time enough to fix op matter) with fair Sybil, »n1 take her somewhere that 1 could not find you? It won't do, my clever friend. I leavo to night ; Dorcas Hnel comes in the morning, and you will see how qutekly sho will dis pose of Mistre's Sybil." Jasper winced, but finally agr-ed to Be Ic's arrangements with fairly g'xyl gracd. He had to, Tbere was no other way. ; The wife whom he h»i donbted and abused in the past had the uppor hand now. He drew a long breath of relief when Belle was out of the houw. "I Buppoje I can c*ll my soul my own while she is gone, and no longer," he mut tered. "So I had better improve the time. I'll ifo and see Sybil." .. There were two sets of keys to the tower rooms. Belle kept one and took them awty with her to present Jasper Prince visiting Sybil while sbe was gone.

As he stooped to pick it up. the flask of brandy slipped from his breast pocket, and lay upon the thick carpet, without hit noticing it.; ", -.-?,;.' • .-, . CHAPTEE XXVH.'; "TH« HAMOXAN IWJUn TH«E." A quick flash came into Miss Garr's " gimlet-eyes." She changed her position so that the skirt of her dress covered the flat bottle. Then in a moment more sbe had contrived to secure it without Jasper observing her. Passing quietly into the next room, in which Doctor Viirle had left a few vUls of various preparations, she tetatod one labeled '■ Laudanum," and poured tbe whole content* into tho flask of brandy. It had all been don* so qnickly that she had scarcely been miaaed from the room by the other two, when the returned to it, carrying the flask aad a small goblet is one hand, and a pitcher of water in the other. She moved noiselessly toward Jasper. He waa looking at Sibyl and speaung. She was almost behind aim, and he did not see her. She put the glass, the fluk and the pitcher of water all on a little table which stood at Jasper's rifht hud and quite near, but still he did not notice her. "Now, Sibyl, understand me," he was snjing. "I am willing to humor these fancies of yours—to allow you to ;i-iriat that there hat be— aaoihai KenrickPnmos to whom jpu hay« moM mi ftxo .4- i t*»^:i j-i-i.iif ' is now dead.

What do you say? Not a word camo from Sibyl. She sat staring at,him with eyes of loftiest and in dignant contempt, her lips white with pain, her whole air expressive of the utmost horror and defiance; but she did not utter a word. Jasper quailed before the fire in those beautiful eyes, in spite of those fierce draughts of spurious courage with which he had bolstered himself Uis uir.uth felt dry and parched. Ho glanced around and saw the flask of brandy, the pitcher, the glass. Uis senses were already becoming con fused. He reached for the flask eagerly, and poured himself nearly a glass of the strong spirit and tossed it down. Prudence watched him exultingly. " Now," sho thought, "if he stays here till that dose geta hold of him, the thing is done." " Well, what do you say ? " Jasper Degan agaia, blunderingly. " You don't expect me to do all the talking, do you ? " His speech was getting thick, his eyes looked glassy. "I say you don't expect—" he began again, savagely, moving toward her. But at almost the first step he reeled, caught at the Übie which held the bottle; and pitcher of water, and went down with it prone and sprawling, like a huge frag, among the ruins. Prudence Garr looked as though she wonld liko to dance on his prostrate body. She caught Sibyl by the hand. " Come! " she whispered. " This is our chance. The keys are in the door, and ho is safo for a while. He couldn't get upon his feet now to save his life, and he will be sound as a post in ten minutes, if not less." They went out of the room quickly, taking the precaution to lock the door at each end of the little passage. " It's a wonder Miss Lucy Venner is not around somewhere spying," Prudence thought. If she had known that Miss Venner was not in the house, her mind would hare been much easier. They went first noiselessly to their own apartments for hats and wraps. " We had better go ont by the garden door," suggested SibyL "We shall not be so likely to be seen." " All ripht," responded Prudence, boldly leading the way. But the suggestion proved unfortunate It was about nine o'clock; there were only dim lights in the halls and passages, and they encountered no one. They couM bear » laint bum and tligh' movement from toe direction of the kitcheu regions. All else was still nntil, v they weie pus ing a door which opened into the dining room, they heard the shrill tones of Mrs Tar fie, the Ball housekeeper, reprimanding some servant probably. '• She it coming oat I" whispered Prudence Garr, and pjlled nbyl with her through the first open door she saw. •• This will do till sho bis gone." ; - •' If she sees us, she will try to stop n>," Mid SibyL '• She has always hated me foi lome reason."

They bad gone into a small room set apart as a storage clotsl. ,There bad not been time to close the door.

She knew well enough who was inside, but pretended to think it was tiro burgUis, and screamed Wily. Fhe servants came running. The gardener took the key from Mrs. Tur fit, and opened the dojr. " Burglars, indeed I" he exclaime I angrily. 4 Why, its Mrs Pnnec and Miss Garr." i Toe two ladies came one into the hall Sybil was pale—but haughtily imperious. ; She looked at Mrs Turnt, and the hioja kec^er looked back at her as impertinently as thedaied.
