l-A CERTIFIED CORPSE. Asks for a Drink. A certified corpse was being taken by two porters to the Paris Morgue on a stretcher when it suddenly alarmed its carriers by sitting up and asking for a drink. It was a worthy female, who, having got out of a train in tho Mont Parnasse station, fell down on the platform and apparently gave up the ghost. A reputed doctor who was noar said that tho woman's heart and pulse had ceased to beat, so she was accordingly sent, by stretcher, to the unlovely establish ment in mid-Suine where the dead bodieB of city castaways are kept for dissection and burial. The woman awoke on tho Place du Par vis de Notre Dame, and in stead of taking her to the direful destina tion for which she had been intended her kind carriers marched her into the adjacent hospital, the Hotel Dieu, whore she was installed temporarily in a warm ward, and recoivcd refreshments. She had been over- fvtigued by a railway journey from Brest, and the cold had brought on an attack of congestion of tho brain.
