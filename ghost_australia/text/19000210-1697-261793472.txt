All Round. AND A SEQUEL. As a venerable minister tells this story it would be ungracious and superfluous to adduce further evidence of its truthfulness. 4 I went to a new parish that year,' he relates. 4 Iu looking about for a house I came upon a very handsome residence that was charmingly situated, But everything indicated that the place had long been without a tttiiuui, iiiuu I Lti.o.a.0 .i.n<4u.*.Ly, .LLLO houss was haunted according to neighbourhood tradition, and no one would rent it. I saw the landlord, and he was glad to let the place on easy terms. It would be worth much to him if I would exorcise the ghost placed there by popular superstition. 4 We moved in and I admit that we had a' very creepy experienceâ€” one that my wife oould not long have endured. When everything had settled down to the quiet of the night we would frequently hear the most distressing moans and the sound of someone walking heavily in the attic. I made several visits to that gloomy part of thi house, but oould find nothing to account for the uncanny noise. ' The next night that we were disturbed I,went up there with the dieter mination to fathom the fny.3terj\\. And I did it. The moans were pro- duced by the soughing of the wind through the district telegraph wires that were numerous on one side of the roof. The 4 heavy walking' was aceounted for by a loose slate, flapped by the same wind that did the moaning. Next morning I had the wires removed and the roof repaired.' 4 And that was all ?' 4 Not quite. The landlord at once advanced my rent one hundred per cent.'
