?5>- t «ai Centra' t\ PUBLISHED DAILY. SATURDAY, AUGUST 10, 1871. We are aH very ready to accept for un- questionable fact that the moro a subject is " ventilated"-which is another word for publicly discussed,-the more certain are the public to como to right conclusions respecting it. It is such a comfortable theory, fits in so nicely with many other comfortable theories, and seems withal so reasonable and proper, that one does not like to give it up when experience proves that it has failed in some particular in- stance. The consequences of rejecting this belief in the power of argument to put people right, too, are so tremendous that most of us prefer to doubt the correctness of our conclusions from personal observation even, rather than relinquish it. Yet this is at times difficult. Take for instance the question as to the proper mode of dealing with the Crown lands. Surely if ever I public discussion enlightened a people on j any subject the people of Queensland ' ought to be very clear on the " land ques- I tion," as it is called. The laud, immigra- j tion, and railways, have been discussed almost incessantly for the last eleven years, j or more, and during the wholo of that time j the land has attracted the greatest share j of attention. The agitation which resulted j in the passing of the Land Act of \ 1SG8 lasted for at least five j years, during which time it was perpetually i being ventilated ; but instead of leading to unanimity of opinion it seemed to have rather the opposite effect, so that Mr. Lilley, in utter bewilderment at tho num- ber of theories propounded, was at last driven to declare that " every man in the colony had a pet land scheme of his own in his head, and a land bill to match in his pocket." There is no doubt that the Land Act of 1868, in its broad outlines, did really em- body the opinions of a majority of the peo plo on the subject, was a vast improve- ment upon previous laud acts, aud if it had been administered honestly and fairly, in accordance with the intentions of many who assisted in moulding it to its present form, there would have been little to complain of. As it is, thoso districts in which it has been best administered have made rapid progress in population, settlement, and material prosperity during the three years it has been in operation. But notwithstanding all this, there is no shutting our eyes to tho fact that oven if it wore possible to secure its honest and im- partial administration all over the colony, which seems doubtful, it is still capable of amendment in some particulars, and tho same diversity of opinion exists ns to what amendments are necessary to be made. Xo only so, but, what is still more discouraging, the clearest and most simple provisions of the present Act arc constantly being disregarded, in spito of penal clauses and all the ordinary safeguards ; settlement of the most desir- able kind is being systematically shut out from certain districts in couscquence ; and nobody seems to know how this can bo remedied for the future. In one sense, Mr. Palmkr's friend was perfectly justified in saying that "it waa administration rather than legis- lation that tho colony required." If ho had said "honostand impartial adminis- tration," ho would havo beon still nearer tho truth. Tho manner in which tho runs on tho Darling Downs, " the garden of the colony" as it used to bo called, were divided so as to stave oil' population ns far as pos- sible, is matter of public notoriety. The schemes for still further carrying out this policy of exclusion, by purchasing all the valuable agricultural land on the resumed halves of tho runs, and tho facility with which it can bo and is done, aro equally well known. ¡Scarcely a mail comes in from tho country districts without supplying somo instance of the kind, either in tho shapo of correspondence, or newspaper articles and paragraphs. The mails from Warwick and Rock- hampton yesterday are cases in point. An extract from the Warwick An/us on the subject appears in another column, and it is not our present purpose to refer to that further. The Rwltliamplan Bulletin con- tains accounts of two other cases. There is nothing at all exceptional in them ex- cept in minor details ; they aro in no way ditl'erent from numbers of others which have been recorded beforo, and which will no doubt bo recorded again, but they are gricvaucos of a very serious kind noveitheless, and the fact that they aie ordinaiy cases lenders thein the bettet illustration of the point in question Ihclirst oi the cases îefeircd to is that of th > Ltljmeie Lagoon Reseñe, îespeeting which a petition was picsented fiom the settleis by Mi 1 iii, last session Tins lagoon is the watei supply loi a considerable nunibei of selectois lho petition silted tint the occiqants of twenty thousmd actes uno entirely dependent upon it foi watei, and up to a îecent penod a road to it, and also the best load to Rockhampton, ian ilong its western side Attimpts baie been made at vmious tunis, bj one ui othei, to sectue the land on lint side, close the io id, and so pieient icccss to the lagoon But the applicants weioinfoimed that the land was íesened foi ] ubhc pui poses, and tint the Goicin mint had no intention to liioke the íeseí \ation Yet in April last Me»sis Scorr, Ja\sl\, and Go, m ho owned a considci able portion of land at the back, obtained leave to close the load and thereby cut oil the neighboung selectors and the public fiom all access to duuktble watei within foin miles, in spite of the petition against this proceeding, and notwithstanding the statements pievtou'ly made in wilting by the Undoi Secietaiy foi Lands îespecting the matter The load is now being fenced in bj Messrs Scott and Go Mi Euc was applied to by the selectois some days ago, and he forwarded the following telegram to the Undei Secretaiy foi Lauds -" Considei ablo anxiety is felt in the uoinity of Lily meie Lagoon by settlers, in consequence of scat city of watei and fiom fences being elected Has the Reseñe been alienated ?

They might examine a great many witnesses without obtaining so signal a proof of its failure to ensure what it professes to dis- pense, as that afforded by the suit of Jacobs v. Pattison and Another, in Equity. We understand that Mr. W. Hill, tho curator of tho Botanic Gardens, leaves to- day per tho Lady Young, with a collection of Queensland pioductions for exhibition at tho Intercolonial Exhibition, which opens in Sydnoy on August 21. In consequence of tho short time allowed for preparation-'Mr. Hill being only mfoiined to get ready for departure a couplo of dal s ago-the collection will not bo as complete as it otherwise would huvo been, but thero is no doubt that the energy and judgment of the gentleman in chargo will niako it such as to sustain the character of tho colony. Tho well deserved piaito which Sir. Hill's collection gnmed from tho u«ttors at lust yeur's show in tho Southern metropolis is ne'l known, and wo hope that a like success will attend him upon this occasion. Further particulars of tho articles sent will be published by us when furnished.

Chang-, the famous Chinese giant, continue« to hold successful and well attended lovées al tho Town Hall, his stupendous yet symmetrical proportions striking the beholders with wonder. Last evening tho visitors woie numerous, and thoro were, as usual, several attractions. A largo assortment of, fans variously designed, and other Chinese curiosities, were displayed on a centre- table, and eccurod a number of pur- chasers, the articles being chiefly suitable for lad ios, who formed a considerable portion of the audience. Then Km Foo attracted a good deal of attention She is o young and very protty Chinese lady, and (to use the words of an English critic) has the merry, twinkling, almond-Bhaped, oblique oyes that we seo so often in Chinese pictuies, but so seldom in real life. Tho great attraction, however, was Chang himself-a mighty presence, towering hoad and Bhou'ders, and arms too, above the tallest of his adaméis, his many good qualities, and courteous, gentlemanly demeanor eliciting golden opinions in his favor But Mr. Chang-or, ive should say, Chang Woo Gow has studied hard, and has travelled in many lands Since the age of twelve, wo are told, the classic aphorisms of the founders of Chinese literature-ConfueiUB and Moucius-have beon ^g tho guides of his life, and his aotive and well directed career clearly proves his faith ia the saying, " Joss helps not those who let oppor- tunities slip hy " Thoso who caro to measure themselves with so mighty a man had better take an early opportunity of doing so, as his stay in Busbano is now almost at a olose. The Dioiama of tho American War will be exhibited for tho last timo in Brisbano, at the School of Arts, this evening, when the usual distribution of gifts will bo made. An after* noon pel formunco will take placo at 3 o'clock,and no doubt thero will be a largo attendance. At the Central Police Court, yesterday, three drunkards were discharged, and one— William Thompson, a seaman belonging to the Ramsey, aged twenty four years—was ordered to pay a fine of £3, or, in default, to be im- prisoned for seven days. He was taken into custody on the preceding night by constable Harris, who found him in a drunken state, and making use of the most abominable language, in George-street. He had also, it appears, smashed a "water monkey," and done other damage at the Sovereign Hotel, Elizabeth street. In the lock-up he became very víolent, and smashed a water bucket kept in the drunkards' cell. Here, too, his language was disgusting in the ex- treme. On receiving his sentence, he sent a messenger to the captain, and was, meanwhile, removed in custody. A bathee awkward hitoh huB take place m tho working of tho road trusts, it having been discovered, according to tho D D Gazelle, that members of somo ono or moro of lho boards havo an interest in contracts Tho Minister for Works, wo ni o told, has m consequence directod that on proof of trustees being associated with contiactors for woiks carried on under the direction of the boards, " tho agreements will bo cancelled immediately " But although it is very easy to make a rulo of tho kind, it is not quito so easy to enforce it, and nttompts to cancel agreements would loavo tho Government open to fiesh actions for damagos.

To Mr A Kohler, we believe, is due the credit of having originated the movement, for on Sunday last ho prepared a subscription list, and by Monday evening had obtained subscriptions amounting to £71. He raised £43 of this amount from the settlers on the Pink Lily, nearly all £5 sub scriptions, which is a proof of their earnestness in the cause, as the present season is a very trying one for them, and they find it difficult to make even rations. The balance was subscribed by residents in the neighborhood of Lion Creek. On Monday evening a member of the promoters was held at the Lion Creek Hotel, A. P. Gossett, Esq, in the chair. About twenty heads of families were present. The fol- lowing committee of management was appointed —viz , Messrs. Cranston, Schweinberg, Naese, Plahn, Belfield, Golz, Martin, Gossett, and Kohlor—the last named gentleman to act as secretary. It was understood that the com mittee of management should be canvessed on an early day, and we understand that Messrs. Belfield and Kohler will make their first visit on Friday next. It seems that the intended site of the school is about midway between Lion Creek bridge and Pink Lily Lagoon, which are about two miles apart. Within a convenient distance of this spot there are fifty children, and the number is constantly increasing. It is imposible that these children can come to the Rockhampton school, and therefore a local institution is an absolute necessity The amount wanted from the public is £150, which would secure an additional sum of £300 from the Government, and admit of the necessary build- ings being erected and furnished uccording to the requirements of the Education Board. The Pink Lily farmers are a valuable class of colo- nists, and we have no doubt that their efforts will be liberally seconded by the people of Rockhampton, despite the frequency of sub- scriptions and the extreme tightness of money at the present time.
