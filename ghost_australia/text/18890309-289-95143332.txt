TOO DEEP FOR TEARS. Out of the silence, cold and drear, Of the ghoBt-like phantoms of yesteryear, Conies the low wailing, full of fear, Of a pain too deep for tears. -Oat of thestormrack overhead, ?With it's distant ramble, all thunder fed, Comes the deep anguish, fall of dread, Of a pain too deep for tears, .Out cf the ocean's ceaseless tide. With the deep sea secrets its cold depths bide, ?Comes the ead murmur, far and wide, Of a pain too deep for tears, 3for my love lies dead 'neath the low'ring sky, While the sere leaveB fall and bare branches sigh, And the sad sea moans and the wind blows high, And my pain ia too deep for tears.
