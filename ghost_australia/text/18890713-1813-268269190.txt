THE D. J. C. MIDWINTER MEETING. IHB WEIOHT8, PROBABLE STAETEEa, AND LIKELY •WINNERS. By HARKAWAY. We are again on the eve of the July meeting which has always proved in previous years an Interesting and enjoyable holiday week (or visitors from all parts of the different colonies; I don't pretend to say that the racing in itself is the sole attraction. The Agricultural and Pastoral Society's Show being held in the same week is the means of bringing many to Deniliquin that otherivise would not visit as and, when they have reached the city of the plains, to assist at the Show, They generally pat in an appearance at the races, and this year ihould be no exception to the rule as the season so far has been ao| promising. Stock will be in forward condition, consequently owners will be in better spirits to enjoy a week's holiday, making with a probable chance of beating his neighbour in the two or four-tooth class or in the Ring, or possibly, winning a race at the meeting as I notice a few of the local wool growers (large and Bmall) are represented in the various events to be contested during the week. I will now deal with the weights. Some of the horses are unknown to me, therefore, I shall pass them without giving an opinion as to their capabilities or chances of appropriating any of the events for which they are nominated. We will take the events as they appear on the slip of weights distributed 'amongst owners by the secretary. We start on the First Hurdle Race, 24 miles, in which Dragon heads the list at 12st. 101b. a weight he has to carry in Melbourne amonst the cream of the oolonies, and if he comes to Deniliquin we need look no further for the winner of the event in a common canter, but as he is engaged below about the same time Z shall treat him as an absentee. Black Prince has a good chance; William Tell, a good useful sort of a horse who could carry MB popular owner across country to hounds, but his show of winning this event is very remote; Trentham, an arrant rogue, and may never get over the first hurdle; Squire, a fair horse; Weathercock, a good stayer, well named, as he jumps from east to west or north to south as the inclination takes him, but be will prov6 a troublesome customer in more ways than one; Marchioness must improve a wonderful lot to have a ghost of a show ; Black Prince, Squire, and Weathercock, will fill the places. THE RIVERINA CM. All Gold, a remarkable good horse but labouring under the disadvantage of a '• leu" so I shan't look upon his chance as rosy ; Abuse must be treated with respect if the Abuse of old ; V.C., no chance; Jebusite, dangerous ; Jasper, very dangerous ; Baron's Court, no chance ; Numismatist, one of the dangerous division ; Khedive, I can't understand being let in at 6st 131b considering his performances, he must have a show if started ; Hortense, a fair performer; Typhon and Weathercock, I muBt pass in thiB event. Therefore I have selected from the lot all that have a good chance of appropriating the rich prizo of the meeting, and would place them—Jasper, Jebusite, and Numismatist. THE FLYING HANDICAP. Rhetorician has a chance in this; Daylight, a fairly good horse ; and Black Prince, I can't-stand for this event*, Oneida haB a chance with 7st 71b ; Wamba, Boaz, and Mia Mia, must pass; then Grandee and Esmee have a prospect; Sir Arthur and Leviathan are unknown to me; and Clinker holds all beneath him as safe as possible. From the lot engaged I select four, viz., Daylight, Oneida, Esmee, and Clinker, from which the winner ought to come. IK THE SECOND HURDLE RACE I look for the winners from Squire, Weathercock, and Black Prince, and if Weathercock only goes a bit straight he ought to win with Squire next best. THE D.J.C. HANDICAP. I shall reduce the field to seven and name them as follows — Abuse, Jebusite, Jasper, Hortense, Khedive, Daylight and Oneida. Should Jasper win the Cup his penalty will increase his weight to S9t 21b which will steady him undoubtedly, still I think bis chance so rosy that I must select him to win with Hortense next best on paper. This brings us to the event of the meeting in my opinion. TOE STEEPLECHASE. I should have liked to have seen a few better class horses nominated for this event. Black Prince will be the top weight at starting, and will give his backers a fairly good run for their money. He is very honest and a good fencer. Trenthan don't like fencing, he has a decided objection to going up in the air. Hard Times will keep going at 1 that long loose style of his and will be hard to shake off; Voltaire has had two unsuccessful attempts to win at Deniliquin and this may probably make three, and I expect the winner to tarn up in Black Prince or Hard Times, TEE BRACELET Will be a good race between Weathercock and Daylight if he is " well and wanted." The light weights are new candidates for Bracelet horses, and there might be a flyer amongst them. " Oh 1 Bonnie Doon," "Bonnie Doon where art thou"—you could win "a blooming quid" in this company, providing "Tot" was in good nick. THE TOWN PLATE. By the time this comes on for decision the majority of the horses will have had enough of it, and we frequently see eood fields face the starter for this event. My fancy leads me to select Abuse, Jasper, Rhetorician, Hortense, Esmee, Little Rosa, and Clinker (who 1 know to be a good colt'), and the winner should come from Abuse, Rhetorician or Clinker. I wish the D.J.C. a successful and enjoyable meeting. I notice there are a great many twoyear-olds nominated for the different events, and this looks well for the Sires' Produce Stakeg'and Maiden Plate, entries for which close with the secretary on Saturday (to-day) at 8 o'clock. A weli-kuown sporting friend sends me the fol lowing, and says tbat backing his tip is like picking up money :— First Hurdles—Dragon or Black Prince. Riverina Cup—Abuse, 1; Numismatist, '2 ; Khe dive, 3. Flying Handicap—Rhetorician. 1; Esmee, 2. D.J.C. Handicap—Jebusite, 1; Little Rosa, 2 ; Daylight, 3.
