SATURDAY, NOVEMBER 2, 1878. Tlio speech dohveied by Mr BrRR\ in connexion with the pioposal to reduce tho ta. on impoited sheep norn nine pence to sixpence is a fair sample of the hon gentlemans confusion of mind as regaids commeicial affaiis He does not seem to be able to understand in the slightest degieo the secondaiy effects of any given impost, and it is questionable how fal he can appieciate its direct operation Seeing that he is the only member of tho Ministiy who Ins the faintest conception of anything lolatingto ti ade, his deficiencies m this îespect aie much to be íegietted, as ho is liable at any moment to vv andei into some fiscal quagmire, fiom which escape is linpos siblo except at tho cost of the countiy I he lion gentleman has been told by men whose business enables them to speak with authority, that the tax on stock, if continued, will deprive this colony of the Riverine trade He relies on cQrtain wool returns furnished by his colleague, the Commissionei of Customs, to relute this position These show that up to the present time the importations of wool have been laigei this year than in 187G (the season of 1877 was exceptionally bad, owing to the diought), and this he consideis a con elusivo argument against the state ment alluded to Suiely, however, ho can see that even if the fact is as stated, and shearing has not been earliei tins year than in former times, it does not tell much in his favour It was doubtful up to within a short time ago whether the railway to Wagga Wagga would be available this season, and mer cantile connexions, oftentimes compli cated, are neither formed nor severed in a day A commencement, however, has been mado in the tiansference of trade-the effects of which would have been felt before this had it not been for the heavy clip available-and we shall be agreeably surprised if the next two or three years do not show that the operation is progressing with over in ere ising speed But, says the lion gentleman, is summg that the tax has diverted busi ness from Melbourne, and will continuo to do so, " tho policy of the countiy " cannot bo undo subservient to the " cairjing trade ' It is altogether m correct to call the trade of lti\ erin. a mero "cairying ti ade, ' as the sottlcis in that dibtiict aro laigo customeis for articles of Yictomn lnanuficturc But supposing it were confined entnelj to transport, we would point out to the Chief Secretaiy Unit the va oik of cai nago cannot be cilected without the employment of labour, and that so fin is finding profitable emploj ment is con coined, a can ymg tiadc is just as good as an j othei Hie carnage of law mite nal fiom the place of pioduction to the place of consumption ls iii îeility one of tho stages in tlio piocess of manufacture But, without dwelling lon^ci on lins point, let us ask why the policy of the country cannot be so fiamed as to allott the carrying trade fair pi ty 1 Mi Blrr _ furnishes the answer It mu .t be suboidi nated to the meat pioducing interest, which, foi some iny~tciious icasoii 01 othei, is supposed to havo supenoi c1 nins to encoui igenicnt It is contended, then, that though the stock tax may destioya large and valuable intercolonial tiade, it must be maintained foi tilt, sake of Vic tonan glaziers let us see now whit it has done foi them To quote Mi B.iuv. again, "instead of tho maikets " going up, they ha\o come down c\ei " since the tax w is imposed, and not " onlj is the price lo wet, but the quality " is -dso much bettei ' In fact, the Victorian giazicis aie now selling better aiticles than they supplied before the tax w as imposed at smallei pi ices th in thej got foi tho inferior goods Sm ely, it is hardly woitli while ti destroy lucia tive commercial iel itions to attain such a result as this Mi Blrrv w ants to make out that the Victorian meat __ioweis now have the command of the muket, whereas bofoie they were frequently e .eluded by some imaginary " lings ' fonned of Riverine squatters "I ha\e known,' said the Chief Sccietary, "fanners in tnedistnct ' of Geelong bring their lambs t > mai " ket week aftei w eek, and im c to " take them home ag un because of the " Eivenne supplj ' lins is rathei too rich If the supply was so much greatei then than now, why was the pi ice highei ? And does Mi Li kuy mean to say that if his Geelong fneilds hld been willing to tal e the pnce they are forced to accept now that he his "en " couraged " them bj a tax, they c mid not have got nd of then animals e\eu in the markets said to lm e been glutted 1 Ile must think his bcaiei. is innocent as the Geelong lambs spoken of, but fal more readily sold But is it a fact that the duty has given Victorian giaziei-, anything like that appioach to mono poly which is necessaij, accoiding to Mi Bu«-., to secuio n fetoa.d\\.

Mining upon Private Property Bill passed by the Legislative Council, and now waiting the second readmg in the Assembly The Government, says the Minister, aie most desirous that I a nuning upon private

The plaintiff proved that the land belonged to one Cavenagh, who died in the year 1855. Prior to his death Cavenagh had mortgaged the property to persons through whom Atkinson had afterwards become possessed. Slack had purchased the interest of the heir-at-law of Cavenagh, and as such, in the suit of Slack v Atkinson, claimed the right to redeem. He proved that he had at one time been in possession, but had afterward been removed. At the close of his evidence Mr Goldsmith, for the defendant, claimed nonsuit on the ground that Mr Slack had himself proved he had no legal title to the property, and could not acquire it till he had paid the sum directed by the Equity Court and obtained the conveyance. Mr Justice Barry held that the plaintiff had not proved a legal title to the property, and nonsuited the plaintiff. At the conclusion of the trial of Slack v Downton, in the Juries of Six Court yester day, Mr Slack was called upon by Mr Justice Barry for an explanation of his behaviour to the sheriff (Colonel Rede) on the preceding day. The sheriff stated that when he had caused Mr Slack's removal from the bar seat, Mr Slack called him "a long eared ass." Mr Slack said he had no intention to insult the sheriff, but he wished to assert his right to take his seat at the table. Why should the public pay for a table, if persons who were only the agents of the public when they had no business in the court were to sit at the table to the exclusion of the public? His Honour said he had decided that point on the previous day, and could not allow it to be re-opened. Mr Slack persisted that, on behalf of the public, he was justified in in- sisting on his right to the seat. He had no feeling against the sheriff. His Honour - Well, as you say you were only acting in the assertion of a right, the sheriff can afford to accept your excuse, and I shall say no more about the matter. Mr Slack then left the court. In the Tquitj Court jesterdaj, a suit ol Iloyi) v Atkinson and Otho s was heard, in which Mr S P Hogg sued Dr II At kinson, of Sandhurst, and two othei persons, named Nelson Jones and Thomas, claiming to bo entitled to a half share m the Alabama and Butlers Iteef Com panj, Heathcote In 1875, Hogg and At kinson obtained a lease of the ground at Heathcote for nuning, the plaintiff to be the active partner, and Atkinson to find the capital A great deni of money had been spent on the mine when a dispute occurred about the erection of some pumping machiner) Atkinson insisted that if that machiner) was erected ho would leave, and uUimatcl) Atkinson transferred his share to Hogg There was some kind of un derstanding that if this machinery was not put np, Atkinson was to be at hbortj to resume his share Tho maclunerj did not turn out successful, and Mr Hogg was not m a position to comply with the labour cove nnnts or to paj the rent for the lease Dr Atkinson then applied to the Mining depart nient for a forfeiture of the lease, which was opposed by Mr Hogg, vv ho stated that he was sole ow ner of the mine T he Mining depart ment forfeited the lense, and granted a new lease to Atkinson, who with Jones and Thomas formed a company to w irk the ground 'Hie mine had turned out to be profitable The plaintiff claimed that he was entitled to his original sharo with the defendant Atkin- son, as the latter had no right to go behind lum and obtain the forfeiture of the first lease Mr Justice Molesworth was of opinion that the plaintiff had ceased to treat Atkinson as a co partner after the first lease had been transferred to lum, and therefore he could not complain of the latter s conduct in obtaining a second lease The bill was theicfore dismissed, vv ith costs An action was commenced in tho Su preme Court on Thursdaj, ni which Messrs liobertllarperandCo sued Mr W B Jones, bonded storekeeper, for £971 for damage to a quantity of rice stored with tho defendant In March, 1877, the plamtifls purchased a cargo of rice from Messrs Prell and Co , winch they stored with the defendant The defendant 8 store is situated m Moraj street, near the Yarra On the 10th March last there was a heavy Hood m tho Yarra, which overflowed its banks, and all the Hat to rmerald hill was submerged A great deal of water got into tho Storo m which this rice was placed, and between 50 and CO tons of the rice was damaged The plaintiffs sought to recover the valuo of the mcrchan disc destroj ed on the grounds that the de fendant was bound to return the rice m the same condition m which it had boen de liveied to him, and also that proper precautions had not been taken to keep out the water, inasmuch as the defendant ought to have put up boards m front of the door as he had promised the plaintiff to do m the j case of a Hood It vv as said that he had had | groov cs made m the retaining walls m front o£ the door, in which to place the boards, i and that he waa to puddle claj between tho boards , and if this precaution had bee adopted, the damage would not have take: place The case was continued yestordaj when the defence set up was that there wa no neglect on the part of Mr Jones, ho hai not warranted the store to be flood proof that all precautions had been taken, and th damage w as the result of a sudden flood ove winch he had no control The case had no concluded when the Court adjourned til Monda} _ he Melbourne General Sessions for thv month, winch were commenced in tin Countj Court jestcrday morning, only lastci n short time, as there were but two prisoner! for trial, each of them being charged witl fortuit, cheques for small amounts and botl of them pleaded guiltj John Taylor, agams whom there were two cases, received sen tences amounting to four years imprison mont, with hard labour , and George Wilson who hid thrco charges against him, alai recen ed sentences amounting to four years imprisonment, with hard labour Hie Cour then adjourned snic die The weekly meeting of the executive Com mittee of the Intercolonial Juvenile Industrial exhibition was held yesterday afternoon at 5 Collins street west. Mr Beath occupied the chair, and there was a full attendance of members. A sub committee, consisting of Messrs Cope, Carson, and Robotham was appointed to prepare the general circular, also the list of officers and the rules and classification of exhibits. A litho graphic form of the exhibition debenture was submitted, and generally approved of and adopted. Mr Robotham informed the committee that Messrs Charles Troedel and Co, of Collins street, had prepared the de benture form, and as their donation to the exhibition funds would make the committee a present of 1,100 copies. A vote of thanks was passed to Messrs Troedel and Co for their handsome donation At the close of the meeting, the debenture list was handed round, and resulted in £300 worth being taken up by the members present. From the favourable manner in which the undertaking has been received, it is fully ex pectcd that the whole of the debentures will be placed in the course of the next two or three weeks. It was resolved to call the general committee together on November 22, to lay before them a full statement of the progress made. The committee adjourned to November l8 The ordinary monthly meeting of the Photographic Society of Victoria was held last evening, at Mr Hewitt's portrait rooms, Mr Fenton in the chair. The secretary read a letter from Mr Williams, of Toorak, Mr. Thos. Pearce's uncle, drawing attention to a letter from Mr Burman, which had appeared in one of the morning papers, stating that an oil painting representing the scene of the wreck of the Loch Ard had been presented to Mr. Pearce together with a sextant, in the name of the society. Mr Williams stated that he accompanied Mr Pearce till the ship in which he sailed was about 10 miles from the Heads, and he knew that neither the oil painting nor the sextant had been received by Mr. Pearce, or by any one so far as he knew on his behalf. A resolu- tion was passed that the secretary write to Mr Williams informing him that the society knew nothing of the presentation.
