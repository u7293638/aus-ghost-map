A FOLDED LEAF. A MxpiD page, old,*tain6d,«id blurred, I found within yonr book last night. I did not read t&e; dim dark word I saw in tbe slow-waning light ; So put it back, and left it there, As if In truth I did not care. ? Ah 1 we have alt a folded leaf Tbat in Time'* book of long ago We leave : a half-relief Falls on us when we hide it so. We fold it down, then turn away, - And who may read that page to-day f Not you, my child j nor you, my -wife, Who ait beside my Btudy^cbair ; For all bave something in their life ' ' , * Tbat they, and they alone, may bear— A trifling lie, a deadly tin, A something bonght tbey did not win. My folded leaf I how'blpe ryoe gleam And blot the dark-brown eyes I. aee ; And golden curie at evening (warn Above tbe black looks at my knee. Ah, me t that leaf is folded dorm, And aye for me the locks are brown. And jet I love them who Bit by. My best and Ae arett— detreut nou. They may not know for what I tigb, What brings the shadow on my brow. Ghosts at the best ; ep let them be, Nor come between my life and me I , They only rise at twilight hour ; So light the lamp, and close tue blind. Small perfume lingers in the flower That sleeps that folded page behind. So let it ever folded lie; ?Twill be unfolded whan I die I Moax About Tarjass,— Otllleo's discovery of the pendulum was suggested to bis observ ant eye by a lamp swinging from the oelling of Pisa Cathedral. A spider's net sntponded ? . across the pith of Btr Samuel Brown, as he walked ope dewy morning in bia garden, was the prompter that gave to him the idea of bis eUBptnsion bridge across 'the Tweed. So trifling a matter as the sight of seaweed floating past bis ship enabled Columbus to quell tbe mutiny wbloh aroae among his Bailors at not discovering land, and to assure them that tbe eagerly Bought, ae* world was not far oil. Oalvani observed that a frog's leg ' ? twitohed when plaeed.ln oomtot with different metals, and it was thit apparently insignificant fact that led to th» lnvetlioa of the eleotrio telegraph.
