AUSTEALIAN CRICKETERS IN AMERICA. TFrom thn New York ElimrrA AUSTRALIANS V. JT. Y. EIGHTEEN. The team sailed from Livercool in the Guion steamer Alasha SO, accompanied' by Midwinter, the Gloucestershire professioLal, and after a pleasant voyage arrived here October S, when they were wel comed uy a delegation irom me various cncEet clubs of this city anil vicinity. After playing in this city and in Philadelphia they leave San Fran cisco in the Pacific line mail steamer City of New York on October 21, and aro duo in Sydney on November 10. The pmie at Uoboken commenced on October 9, but this is not the first appearance of the Australian cricketers in the metropolis. October 1.1S7S, they played against an eiRhteen of the St. George, Staten 'island, and Manhattan Clubs, and the visitors found some difficulty in defeating the eighteen in a two-innings gamo with 5 wickets to fall, and in this game Murdoch, Spofiorth, Boyle, Garrett, A. Bannennan, Blackham, and Horan of the present teajn played. Tha feature of the contest was the remarkable exhibition of fielding and bowling by the Eighteen, which excelled that of any team of New York azainst an in ternational eleven. In the bowling Brewster bore off the palm, he taking 7 of the Australian vrickets for 'i runs. .This is, therefore, tho second appear ance of the Australians in Xew York, and the gamo which began on the 9th on the St. George Grounds was a two days' match against an eighteen picked from the St. George, Staten Island, Manhattan, Newark, and one or two other clubs. On both this and their former visit the Australians were favoured with the finest weather they could have had, but in 1S7S they had a batsman's wicket, while in this jramo they played on a bowler's wicket, the majority of batsmen on both sides having but little chance to score. The selection of tho Eighteen was a poor one, and, though it was known a month beforehand that the match would take place, not once was the Eighteen given any field-practice worthy of notice. Though the services of Browster, too, were at com mand, they were not takeu advantage of , and instead of having fine fielders the selection waa made on the the basis of batting strength, and the result was a lamentable failnre. It is not werth while- to give much space to this match, for it was— with tho exception of some of the bowliny— the poorest exhibition seen in any of our international contests in this vicinity, and it was in striking and most inferior contrast to the play of the eighteen of 1S78 against the Aus tralians. The New Yorkers won thetos3and went to the bat to the bowline of Spofiorth and Boyle ; and of the whole Eighteen but twojmade even the ghost of a stand against these bowlers. These two were Lane and Lambkin, the former being in for half an hour fcr 3 runs, and the latter for nearly the same time for 3. Mart was badly missed by Bonnor after scoring 3, and Boyle gave Captain Whito a life. In fact, several lives were given, tho visitors not fielding up to the mark. After an hour and a half 's play the last of the EiRhteen was disposed of, tho inninga closing with the score of 27 runs, two of which wero extras, Mart's G being the highest. SpoSorth took 10 wickets fer 12 runs, and Boyle 7 for 13. At S p.m., after lunch, the Australians went in to the bowling of Lane and Mart, and, to the surprise of tho crowd, tho fourth wicket went down for 32, Bannerman and Bonnor scoring duck-eggs, and Massie and Horan less than double figures. Lano took 2 of tho wickets, and Mart and Cleverly the other two. Then it was that Murdoch and Giffen got in and made the only stand of the day's play, and but for two failures to accept chances for catchers off Murdoch's bat, after he had scored |11 runs only, the Australianswould have been retired for less than 70 runs. As it was, their ninth wicket had fallen for 110 only when stumps were drawn for the day. The game was concluded October 10, in favour of the Australians, with seven wickets to spare. The result would have been a one-innings defeat for tho New York Eighteen had not Captain Murdoch at tempted to prolong the game in order to swell tho gate-money receipts. As it was, as soon as- tho time drew near for drawing tho stumps, Spofiorth and Boyle were put on to bowl and quickly disposed of the Eighteen, and the meagre number necessary to win was [soon obtained, although at the cost of three wickets.
