All the Borgias were also experts in this branch 0f demonism. In the middle agas, however poison was a much safer weapon than it is now. Then the most accomplished chemists of the world manufactured it for the worst purposes. The man of science who had produced a new and subtle philter warranted to kill without convulsing was sure to obtain a splendid douceur for his secret from some prince or noble or lady of high degree, who, to use the classic language of a modern murderess, wanted to " cook somebody's goose " But nowa- days these things are not managed as they were in the Medicean and Borgian eras. All the resources of chemistry were then directed to the destruction of life, and never, as at present, to the detection of the means by which it was destroyed. It is next to impossible for a modern poisoner to evade punishment. The symptoms which follow the administration of all deadly drugs and chemicals are familiar to the whole medical profession. Analysis, like an avenging Nemesis, confronts the perpetrator with the proof of his crime. The stomach of the dead victim is a more potent witness against the criminal than spectres were supposed to be against the "secret men of blood," 400 years ago.
