SPORTING INTELLIGENCE. SOUTH AUSTRALIAN JOCKEY CLUB MEE TING. STEEPLECHASE DAY. 'The autumn meeting of the South Aus- tralian Jockey Club was concluded on the Flemington course yesterday afternoon. The weather was charming for the time of the year, but it was soon very apparent that the attendance would fall far short of the two previous days, and so the first race was an nounced to a very limited body of spectators His Excellency the Governor and Lady Loch were unavoidably absent, but the vice regal suite were in attendance on Lady Robinson and Miss Robinson, who arrived from Adelaide on a visit the day previous The attendance increased before the hour arrived for the Steeplechase and although it did not attain at any period of the day the maximum of Julie r of the preceeding Saturdays, the CUBII receipts were the largest taken during the meeting, show ing that the missing spectators yesterday must have been members of the V R C and the ladies whom they have the privilege of introducing to the reserves At the stewards luncheon SUCCeSs to the S A L C was proposed by Mr C B Fisher, chairman of the V R C Committee, Mr V Pitt, of Adelaide, responding busing opened at 1 o'clock with the Second Hurdle Race, for which the Bunill field of five went to the post precisely the same number on the card being absentees I lit betting it will be seen, underwent ton biderable ( bunges unionist 1 clio, Minerva, and I littler, and the last named city mostly went out favourite The actual result rested between Hitler and 1 clio , but Ilulit on 1 little, about a score of yards from theatre., appeared to hold the Ballarat horse too cheap, for although the mare seemed to have a bit in lum 1 the determine el dash made by Corrigan just landed Lclio a b ire halt head winner on the post An event in the testing to the fur sex now Clinic on fur season, mulled), the Ladies Bran let No fewer than 17 weighed out, with Remus as the favourite at 5 to 4 and bucked at that price to win a good state , but later on a heavy) commission was put into the market for Lantern, and he left for the post most fancied, Kennis having receded to b to 1 The race was to all intents and purposes cut out for Kennis judging from the easy manner in which he won the Nursery Handicap with 7st lib last Saturday), and so it turned out. for Cracknell mine at the proper time and although Last Lj line had looked the winner up the straight, the Pj Schley lodge colt won cleverly by a neck With another year over the shoulders, items ought to turn out a useful colt for Mr Cook the two bracelets were presented to the nominators of the first and second horses by budy Robinson-a Hillier appropriate arrangement, notwithstanding that the two prizes are left in Vic- tons Lady Robinson, however, just as appropriately struck the right chord when she naively expressed the wish that she might next year have the pleasure of making the presentation in Adelaide instead of Melbourne After luncheon, it was tantalising to find the Steeplechase had dwindled down to a miserable field of three horses Of course, Colebrook had the call in the betting, the other two opposed to line only being supported mildly The race was run at a slow pace the first time round, Blackthorn making pretty well all the running into the straight, when he died away, and Songster and Colebrook had the finish to themselves. The favourite, however, immediately find the nie o m hum! in the final run, and won in a canter by four lengths The whole three) jumped beautifully is our first to last, and had songster been a little longer in training he said Colebrook would have prim led an interesting finish The Chant) Plate saw live so to the post, but the number was reduced through hilarity bolting so soon as Mr Watson had taken them in hand The filly galloped all the way back to the saddling paddock, and lost her jockey at the entrance gate The boy had to be carried to the casualty room, and was found to be much cut about the head and body Reverting to the race, it turned out a good thing for First Pop, starting at the nice piece of 2 to 1 On being put up to auction, the bill) was longer I in at the upset price of 150 sovs, and so the Melbourne charities were not benefited thereby The meeting was brought to a conclusion at half-past 4 with the South Australian Jockey Club Handicap, for which a score opened silk Britisher was favourite at the, Ringwood and location ing next at 8 to 1, but the winner sprang from the outside division in St John, who was most prominent all through a fast run race (2m yes.), and defeated Britisher by two and a half lengths, the Ballarat horse taking second money by a head only from St Lawrence The general arrangements of the meeting, under the experienced superintendence of Mr Byron Moore, Mr Miles, and the other officials of the Victoria Racing Club, tended to make everything run smoothly from first to last But for the unfortunate breakdown in the weather last week, moreover, the gathering would have been a great financial success also In every other respect the meeting has undoubtedly been gratify- ing to all concerned, and it is pretty well the general opinion that the South Australian Jockey Club will not regret their somewhat peculiar visit to the head quarters of the Victorian turf Nor can they at all complain of the form shown by their horses on Victorian Boil, for they carry back with them the Goodwood Handicap, the Adelaide Cup, tile Sires' Produce Stakes, and the S A J C Handicaps capital result, it must be admitted The following are the details of to day's racing - SECOND HURDLE RACE Of D soil - each, with 100 Sovs added About one mile and three quarters Mr H G Talbot's eil g Echo, by Corus, aged, 10st lb (Corrigan) Mr R Philips oh m Rattler, 6 yrs, 9st 12lb (Hunt) 2 Mr LO Wright's br m Minerva, 6 yrs lost 8lb (M Loud) 3 Mr W G Cox's but Cook boat, 6 yrs, 9st (Mr Cox, Jun ) g Mr J Simson us eli of Yellow Hammer, . ) rs, Ost (Harden) 0 Betting -7 to 4 (at first J to 1) next Littler, 2 to 1 (at first 6 to 2) fight here to 1 (at least 2 to 1) ngst Minerva 10 to 1 agst Cockboat and Yellow Ifumniur Cockboat was first away followed by Folio and Minerva Coming to the first hurdle Minerva and Yellow Hammer cleared It together, clip clean up the latter of whom and Follow claiming led over the lump in the centre of the sand hoping left the straight together Yellow Hammer on the inside.
