. A Night Thought Planets porpetuato tho gods of-- Grecco, ' And in tho" dark serene of midnight glido, Like ghosts of tho dead powers, o'er pathways flddo; < Such spell is thero in names ! -which shall not ceaso, But rather, as tho ages roll, increase. What mysteries to posies allied Still in the old mythology abide— _ And stars secure their momory's lasting lease ! Wliilo that cacli planot boars its pagan nama : Tho gods nro unforgot. And glowing bright The constellations' clust'ring jowols claim To write, in letters of unchanging light, Tho history of horocs, Otlior famo Is dulled bosido tho blazonry of night! | —Tko Comhiil Magazine*
