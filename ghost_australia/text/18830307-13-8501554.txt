RAILWAY BRAKE TENDERS. Mr. BENT -In accordance with the pro- mise which I made in the House on the 20th October, that I would spend no money m the direction of providing brakes for railway vehicles without the knowledge or authority of the House, and that which I made on April 20 in reply to Mr W M Clark, that before the sealion closed I would not do anything in the matter until I had consulted the Assembly, I now lay on the table the tenders sent in for the supply of 300 sets of brakes. Mr M'INfYRE asked what the object of laying the tenders on the table was Did it mean that a certain tender would be ac- cepted' Mr. BENT replied that when he laid the report of the Brake Trial Board on the table last m eek he promised thatno contract should be entered into for tho supply of brakes be- fore the House had been consulted At the proper time he would make a proposal. ADDRESS IN REPLY-WANT Ol' CON F1DLNCE MOTION Tho debate was resumed on tho motion that a committee be appointed to frame an address in reply to the Governor s speech, and on the following amendment proposed by Mr Service - "That all tho words after tho word sovereign (In the introductory paragraph of tho draft address In rep'3) bo ormttod, with tbo view of insortlng tho foi lowing words- 'And respectfully informing Ills Excellency that lils advisers do not possess tho con Udonco of Parliament Mr C YOING said that a somewhat unusual course had been adopted by an amendment on the address in reply being moved without any charge being formulated againBt the Ministry lins gave the members of the Government nothing to reply to, but it might be inferred that their conduct was called into question In the absence of any distinct charge, bo desired to make a few remarks m reply to misstatementa publicly made by some lion members during the late elections ('Ob I Ho thought himself per- fectly justified in taking this course With reBpect to the position of the Ministry, ho wished to Bay that tbey did not desire to re tam their seats one hour longer than neces- sary, and that the Constitutional party were made awaro that the Ministry were perfectly willing to resign their seats in order that that party might occupy them Mr 550X -I waB not aware of that. Hear, hear ) Mr C YOUNG -Tbey have been made thoroughly aware of the fact Mr SERVICE -I must say that that ia not correct (Hear, hear ) Mr. C YOUNG -The Ministry were ready to vacate their seats for the Constitutionalists, and notified them to that effect Mr LEVIEN -After the tabling of this motion (Loud laughter ) Mr C YOUNG -The notice was given at the earliest poesiblo moment after the de plorable coalition waB arrived at with the bo called leaders of the Constitutional party During the recent elections several hon members declared the dissolution to be most unconstitutional, and took the Governor severely to task for accepting the advice which led him to it The hon member for the OvenB (Mr Kerferd) was one of those gentlemen, but Burely his memory waa not too short to enable him to remember that not very long ago the Government of which be was a member brought about a dissolution after a six vv celia' session, and carried thing j with a far higher band than the present Government had done On that occasion the House adjourned from Ihuraday to Tuesday, but when members returned to town on the latter day they found that Parliament had been dissolved If that was constitutional, surely tho dissolution brought about by the present Government was constitutional also The circumstances were all in favour of Bend- ing the House to the country The hon member for Geelong and others frequently eatd last Bession that the House was mori- bund and dead for all practical purposes, and the bon. and gallant Major frequently cried out "Dissolve." The electors in various parta of the country had been told by some bon members that the Government had used supplv for a purpose for which it was never intended It should be remembered, how- ever, that at the end of the bIx weeks session to which be bad alluded, a bill was pushed through the House by tho MiniBtry of the day by which they retained command of the public money for two monthB longer than they otherwise, would have done One evening m ¿be absence of the hon mem- ber for Geelong, and in Bpite of the protest of the hoD. member for Ballarat West (Major Smith), a bormleBS looking bill called the Audit Act Amendment Bill waa burned through enabling the Government to wield the finances after the Appropriation Act had expired. It therefore came with a very bad grace indeed from the hon. member for the Ovens, after being in a Ministry which advised the Governor lo dissolve under those circumstances, to say that what the present Government had done was unconstitutional. With regard to the Water Conservation Act, bott, members had told their constituents that the (Government brought in an amending bill embodying suggestions which they mado when the act was under discussion, and tho absence of which rendered the act a fallare Mr. R, CLARK -Qnite right. Mr. C. YOUNG had often listened with pleasure to the hon member for Sandhurst because he threw such a large amount of icuc and energj into what he said, so ns to make what was poor ana washy go down very well (Laughter ) Ile hod not named any of the candidates, whether they had been returned or not, who made the statement referring to the Water Conservation Act, and therefore he would not bo out of order m saying that they knew it to be untrue When the bill was first in troduced the Government asked for £300,000 to enable ltB objects to be carried out, bat since then loans to the amount of £319,727 had been applied for. That fact was well known to the candidates, and therefore could it be supposed for a single moment that they believed what they Baidî Work to the amount of £00,000 had already boon com- pleted and paid for, and although it waa contemplated that there would be only 10 truBla formed nnder the act, 14 had already been constituted, and three others were in process of being established Mr BERRY.-Is there not something to add to that ? Mr C YOUNO -Yes Those candidates also said that tua amended bill waa to make the original act workable, inasmuch as pro- visions were to be included m it which the Government refused to accept when the first measure was under consideration That I question vans raised in the House some mouths ago, when it was emphatically stated | that the amending bill contained no provision which altered the principles of the act It simply provided for supplying water to towns, and for altering the rating clauses. He would only say one or two words regarding the Railway Bill lion members on several occasions called it a bribery bill, but there need not be anything said by bim now, inas- much »B all of thom had come to the con- clusion, and they were supported in it by the entire newspaper press, that tbo bill must be passed m its en- tirety) no matter what Government came into power. A more absurd charge was never made against the Minister of Railways than that he attempted to bribe the constituencies when be framed the bill By whose money were the lines to be constructed ? Did it not come from the people, whose property the railways were to be, and did anyone ever hear of people being bribed by their own money ? It was to be borrowed for the purposes of rail wa> construction, and was proposed to be distributed as fairly as possible Great capí tal had been made out of tbe failure of tbe loan, »B it was called, and he desired to re mind hon members that one section of the press found fault with the Government for not making the minimum lower. What could have been easier for the Government than to gain popularity, if they deeired, at the expense of the colony ? What would have been easier than to fix the minimum at £98 10s, as New Zealand did'' But instead of being applauded for deBiring to up. hold the credit of the colony, and for en- deavouring to obtain a proper price for the debentures they were told tbat they should have accepted a lower price than they con- tended for The price they nsked for was perfectly fair and proper, and even allowing for the interest which bad Bince accrued, he thought it would be obtained. In 1874, when the hon member for Castlemaine (Ur Service) was Treasurer, only £90 was ob- tained for four per cent debentures , in 1870, when Sir James M'Cnlloch was Treasurer, only £03 was obtained, and m 1879, when the bon member for Geelong (Mr Berry) waB Treasurer, and a loan was iloated under his personal supervision in the London market, only £9G 15s waB obtained for £3,000 000 at 1_ per cent If the present loan were floated at par it would be equal to iloating a 4_ per cent loan at £107 Mnjor bMITII -But £2 000,000 was floated at 102 Mr C YOUNG -Yes, at £101 10,, or without accrued interest, at par The Govern- ment felt justified in asking par for their loan, and he had no doubt the result, which ,vould be known next do., would justify their action He wished to speak of one matter which bad been a source of annoyance and regret to the Government, as be ventured to Bay it had also been to a large number of bon members He alluded to tbo loss by the Premier of bis seat (Hear, bear ) There could be no doubt whatever that the attacks regarding the loan, the Railway Bill, and the variouB other matters brought against the Government, and which were tiled to be sheeted home to the Premier, were mere pretences and Bliams to cover the true objection, the true dislike to the hon gentleman, namely, that he was a Roman Catholic, {' No, no, ' bear, hear ) Of combo be was perfect!} aware tbat several bon memberB, many of them his own friends were above any prejudice of that kind He knew that, but thought that they were not entitled to much credit in consequence He carne from a part of Ireland where party feel- ing was waged with more bitterness than in any other place in tho world, and he thought tbat he waB not entitled to credit because he could see excellence and recognise ability in a man no matter what his denomination might be. What had be to do with a man s religious viewB so long aa that man thought out his religion for himself (Hear, hear ) Mr JAMES -And kept it to himself. Mr C YOUNG -Some men kept their religion so much to themselves that it could not be recognised as religion at all, and some of their actions were not the result of religion at all, but rather the result of the want of it. The hon member for Castle- maine (Mr Patterson) was the magnanimous hero that raised the party cry. He would do that hon member the credit of swing that he cared no more for that cry than he would for any other. He looked upon bim m the light of a street rowdy who waa prepared to "kick" up any row in the hope that during tbe ecnmmage be would be able to pick up something that fell to the ground. Not very long ago when he was an unsuccessful candi- date at Castlemaine, he said he recognised the clniiiis of the Catholics on the education queBtion, but he was beaten and saw that that game would not go down He imme- diately changed his opinions, he became a red hot man on the other side , he would compel the Catholics to take what was offered them, and endeavoured to ride down that denomination What confidence was to bo placed in the hon member, and what value was to be attached to a party co-a acaro raised by such an bon member ' Hon mern bers knew perfectly well that ho only wanted something for himself Ho (Mr Young) would give him credit for taking advantage of an opportune time the circumstances were favourable, and he made the best of them. Having made the best of it, what was found ' No chargo had been levelled against the Premier that he ever used his position to advance one denomination or one sect more than another Uo had been on intimate friendship with the bon gentleman, and he stood in his place to declare that he never knew him make any proposition or sugges- tion thot would show a desire to give on advantage to a man of any par- ticular religion or nationality A moro coiiEcientiouB and a more entirely honest administrator he never had an) thing to do with, and it wob an unpardonable and Bhamelul action on the part of anyone to say that he was ever biassed b) his religion to do any act or abBtain from doing anj act, and, it was, further, a Bhome that through a scare raiBed by an individual like the hon mom ber for Castlemaine, the hon gentleman Bhould be thrown over and put in a coruer. Mr. PAÏTERSON -Die decently Mr C YOUNG would be very glad to die decently if his executioners wore respectable men. He would fuither say that, so far a9 ho and the Government were concerned, they regarded tbe bon. member for Gee long as not having been an unreasonable eulie (Hear, hear ) They had always been treated courteously and fairly by tbe hon member He wonld thank those hon mern bera who had given the Government an honest, fair, and loyal support, and especially did he wish to acknowledge the Bupport of the hon member for Warrnambool-a man whose pure moral character, and pure political life entitled bim to the respect of every one in the colony There were some of the gentlemen who had supported them whom he would not thank, and whom he did not thank when they gave their voteB, becnuse they voted under duress They would have been only too glad to havo voted on the other side, but they were afraid to sever themselves from their party So far as he was concerned as a Minister, ho had tried to do his duty-(hear, hear)-and if he bad earned the approval of the House, that waa a satisfactory reward 'Hie Ministry deserved the thanks of the country for the peace and quietness which had been enjojed during tbeir term of oflice- fcheerB)-and it would be the bounden duty of any Government that came into power to pursue a similar course to thatfollowedby this Government (llear.hear ) As for the Constitutional party, he held tbat it owed the Government tbanka During the léomc of the present Government that party had increased their numbers, and the result of the recent dissolution had been to make them stronger than ever they were before. They bad regained seats in Mandurang, Gee long, West Bourke, and several other places , and bo agreed with 'Jhe Aigua in Baying that the party occupied a stronger and better post tion now than it did when Mr Service took office in 1880. And now he desired to address a few remarks to the House as a member of tbe Constitutional party, for surely he did not on becoming a Minister cease to be a member of the party to which he belonged (Hear, bear) He -as glad to hear that expression of feeling and be trusted that a 1 bon. membeis would stick to their party. Mr BENT-Where ia it' Mr Y OUNG -Along with his colleague the Minister of Railways, he (Mr Young) had been charged with having deserted his party when he joined the O Loghlen Administra (ion He had explained before and would now take the opportunity of doing so again, the circumstances under which he joined the present Ministry The occasion on which he explained this before was when he addressed hie constituents at Kyneton, and the hon member for Normanby had ventured to say that what bo (Mr Young) said then waa untrue Mr SHIELS-And I say ao now Mr YOUNG was glad to have that state ment made in the presence of at least 25 or 30 gentlemen, who having been cognisant of the facts were able to bear testimony What be said at Kyneton was that the late hon member for Weat Bourke (tho present Premier) had intended to move a vote of want of confidence in tbe lust Berry Ministry Sir Brj an O Loghlen waa, indeed, repeatedly pressed by one of the leaders of the Consti tutional party to give notice of a motion of that kind ('Bj whom? ) By Mr Murray Smith Mr SHIELS -Oh, you are going to make an absent one a scapegoat for your íniqui ties. Mr YOUNG said tho hon member for Normanby always reminded him of the vitality and excitability he (Mr Young) pos seseed eonio 25 years ago Mr M'INTYRE -That was when you were young Mr YOUNG said ho waa always Young (Laughter ) Aa he had said, however, Sir Bryan O Loghlen waa repeatedly asked to table a want of confidence motion, until on one particular day wben he was informed that the time was inopportune, and waa re quested to hold his motion over Sir Bryan then went to his own friends and told them that the thing was off Immediately after wards a meeline; of the Constitutional party vi as held, 35 members present, at which it was unanimously agreed that Sir Bryan should be asked to bring his motion forward forthwith Mr M INTYRE -That ia not correct Mr \OUNG-In accordance with that resolution Mr Mulray Smith was directed to communicate with Sir Bryan O Loghlen, and to inform bim of tbe reeult of the meeting Mr Murray Smith in due course eaw Sir Bryan, but he (Sir Bryan) said it was too late then, as he had told his friends that tbe matter waa off Sir Bryan, however, managed to see his friends again, and tabled his notice of motion That was the version of the matter which he (Mr Youor) believed to be true and bia belief waa grounded on what he had seen with bia own eyes and heard with his own ears Mr SHIELS -\\\ ho moved the resolution in the caucus '! Mr YOUNG -My memory does not Borve me on that point Mr SHIELS -But mino doea Mr YOUNG -What is more important to me is the fact that the resolution was carried unanimously Mr SIIIELb -I say it was not ao Mr YOUNG contended that the resolution he referred to waa earned by the party, and embodied a request to Sir Bryan O Loghien from the constitutionalists It waa true that Borne members of the party wanted to know what would follow after the Berry Govern ment was ousted, and these members might have given their votes unwittingly, but the question they raised never troubled bim (Mr Young) who had not aspired to any position higher than that of one of the rank and file V hen the Government was being formed he returned from a visit to Sydney and found that certain members of the party wera throw- ing every obstacle in Sir Bryan a way Ho was alao told it waa necessary that another member of the Constitutional party should join the new Government in order to make it a success and he bim°olf was unfortunately asked Housed the word "unfortunately because the honour conferred upon him entailed a dead Iobb in a pecuniary Boneo, as bis Ministerial duties had taken him away from his private buBineBS He accepted ofiice because he knew that the Constitutional party were pledged in a sense to give the new Government their support and because he felt that for the party to refuse any assist ance to Sir Bryan would have been moan and despicable He considered in short that the honour of the party waa at stake He had no doubt that the hon member for Collingwood (Mr Mírame) could, if he chose, corroborateagooddealof what he said ('Oh ) Moreover, supposing he had held aloof and Sir Bryan had failed to form a Government, wbat would have been the result' Aa the Conservative party was then in a minority, the bon member for Geelong (Mr Borrjj would have been sent for again, and not only would he have returned to power but the coiiBtilutionaliatB would have lost tho support of those members of their party who bad befriended Sir Bryan O Loghlen The great object of the constitutionalists had been to oust the Berry Government, and as that bad been accomplished by the present Premier and his colleagues the thanks of the constitutionalists were due to the present Government And what was the object or intention of the Constitutional party now ' Ab they had been told, the party was atronger now than ever it had been during the last 10 j cars Additional members for the party had been returned even by the Btrongholds of liberalism Under tliCBO circumstances, what wbb the duly of the constitutionalists ? Their duty wub to form a Government among them selveB (Hear hear) Ibeir leader (Mr Suvice) however, declined to do so Hitherto everybody had bolioved that gentleman to be a constitutionalist and a conservative, but to the surprise of all, when lie stood on the platform at Castlemaine he declared that he was never within a thousand miles of being a conservative He (Mr Young) could not tell wbat was actually PBSBing in the bon member s mind, but ho Lad always regarded him iib a real conaerva five and as the leader of the constitutional pari j and had therefora eat behind lum on boin sides of the HouBe Now however he found the hon gentleman all) ing himself with the radical of the radicals-hiB new colleague (Mr 1 atterBon) lins waB in itself enough to make the Constitutional parly pause and ask themaelves whither they wero going Hie senior member for Castlemaine (Mr Pattereon) wbb not only one of tho Black ^edi esdoy Ministry - Major SMITH-Oh look at your own col league, the Chief Secretary Mr YOLNG Bald ho was pointing out when interrupted that the senior member for Castlemaine waa not only one of the Black \\\ ednesdoy Ministry but that he desired to go in for a more ruthless butchery than his then colleagues would allow lho leader of the Constitutional party appeared, however, to havo forgotten all tina lhen there was the senior member for Rodney (Mr Gillies) He used to be considered tho cock of the walk (Laughter ) He waa the i,reat chara pion of hie party but he also had altered his tone, and had said that he thought the time had now come for a coalition He did think there was a bit of fight left in the hon membor for Rodney, but it seemed that there was not I hen there was tho bon member for Beechworth (Mr Kerferd) He (Mr Yonnp) could not find out what he stated before the declaration of tho poll, but be saw what he said after, and he presumed that he Buid the sameafter as ho did before the declaration of the poll Well instead of going up with his old colleague (Mr /incite) as honest and true a politician as ever eat in tho House he (Mr Kerferd) ahook off his old friend, and allowed an opponen to head the poll by 400 or 500 votes reversing the previous order, and, by failing to contest the aeat honestly and fairly lost one seat absolutelv to bia party, and only came in a bad second himself At the informal declaration of the poll h remarked that-' The election called to mind a great change in the politics of the country Ho now thought -he (Mr Youni,) wa ashamed to read this-"that 1)9 out of ever 100 electors wero Liberal (Opposition cheers ) What a grand man to conteat seat for the Constitutional party I And on tho following day, at tbe formal declara tion of the poll, he remarked that he believed that there wbb not a great difference between lum and bia colleague (Mr Billson) who, it must be remembered waa the pureat of Radicals Contrast such conduct with that of bon members Buch as Mr Connor or Mr Cunningham, who contested Geelongatraight forward!) on tbe Constitutional ticket and on the question whether the constituency would have Berryites or Conatltutionaliats _be reBult was wbat was bound to follow energy and honeBty They pulled off their seats and headed the poll m the hotbed of IlerryiBtD Such conduct ahould bo contrasted with the miserable wiBby waBhy BontimentB of the hon member for Beechworth Tho action of the bon memberB for Rodney, Beechworth, and Castlemaine was tho result of a previous agreement made before tbo dissolution There wbb an understanding arrived at diahonestly end disgracefully, wbich every member of tho Constitutional party should reprobate These hon memberB ehould have called their parly together beforehand, and consulted tbem, but to deliberately sell the patty was conduct altogether unworthy of them. This was not the first time that Mr, Service had sold his party. He drove that party to the country, and lost many members who had only lately, in his absence, and under a mode- rate Government, got back to the House, and that he should now attempt to lead the party in the direction in which he was going was conduct which every right thinking man m the Constitutional party Bliould resent At the time when he went to the country ho could have gone into opposition with 42 members. There was never a stronger party in the House than that which he led, and yet he led the party to defeat But there was something woree than defeat Defeat could be overcome, but degradation could not. (Cheers from all BideB of tbe House ) Mr. SERVICE-You are showing us tbo way. Mr. YOUNG repeated that defeat could be overcome, but the Constitutional party could not recover irom the degradation which would reBult from doing what ho saw it indicated in The Argut, that they would do, namely, suo for peace from Mr Berry. It was a confession of weaknosB as far as the Constitutional party was concerned If that coalition took place the Constitutional party would be wiped off the face of this country, (Laughter) Ho had asked a friend in Collins street who bad swallowed, or was trying to swallow, the coalition, what waa to be done with Mr, Bertyî "Oh," was the jeply, " ¡re will treat him as we would act if breaking in a steer. We will get a good pair of leaders before and a good pair of polers behind," (Laughter ) He (Mr. Young) asked, bad the hon. member's consent to this ar- rangement been asked Î He (Mr. Young) also desired to contrast the position of the hon. member for Geelong with that of the leaders of the Constitutional party. He went down to Geelong, but said nothing about a coalition, contested the election honestly and fairly from his point of view, tnod to win the seatBfor Geelong for two colleagues, and even went down to shed tears with them after their defeat. There was no concession from Mr Berry The concession had come, not from Mr Berry, but from the Constitutional paît), who now sued for favours for the Con Btnutional party. And in the election of the hon. the Speaker, it was the bon. member for Castlemaine who came forward and pro- posed the very person whose impartiality and the correctness of whose ruling he im- pugned on a critical occasion. Not that he (Mr. Young) was reflecting on that election, for the Speaker had, by his urbane and genial manner, gained the respect of every bon. member. He (Mr, Young) merely wished to show that the hon. member wob now supporting a gentleman whom ho previously would havo rejected, and that that which be condemned before he now thought right and proper He would not detain the House any further. (Cheers ) He waB sorry if be had detained it too long, but he had felt bound to make these remailiB as a Minister and member of the Constitutional party. Mr. SHIELS -Which you betrayed. Mr. C. YOUNG was proud of the position he occupied, and had never asked the hon. and learned member for Normanby or any other bon, member to vote for the Ministry When he took office he did not expect to be in for five weeks, and be did not desire now to retain it. In fact, he never desired office. Nor had he ever betrayed bia party. But this contemplated coalition was an unholy al- liance. He, for one, forbade tbo banns. It must end in disaster to and degradation of tbe Constitutional party, The hon, member for Geelong did not give up anything That party was now taking the hon, member which had condemned him constantly for seven years. (Cheers ) Mr. FRANCIS rose amidst loud cries of "Divide." Ho said it was not his intention to make a speech. (Hear, hear ) ne would not attempt to reply to the creditable speech of the Minister for Public Works. Mr. BENT_You can't deny it, Mr FRANCIS hoped that the Minister for Rail was s would be peaceable, and avoid nutating interjections. (Cheers ) Tho Minis- ter for Public Worka had madea miatake Tho bon gentleman said that the Premier moved the vote which led to tbe retirement of the Beiry Ministry with the knowledge and con- currence of the Opposition of the day, and at the request of ita leaders When he (Mr, Francis) spoke on that motion on Juno 23, 1881, he observed - " I stated, a week ago, that the motton tor a con fe« uco between tho ¿louses on the reform quostlon aies tabled by tbo bon member for Weat Bourko (8ir Br) an O Loghlen) ailthout any previous coucort with mo " Of course he could only answer for himself, as one of the leaders of the party pt that time He did not invite Sir Bryan O Loghlen to move the motion, and there was no consulta- tion between them Later on he said - " VV hilo 1 And it my duty to support tho bon morn bcr tor Weat Bourlto nsfarasaotlngfor bia motion Is concerned, 1 haao told that gcntloman that, from tho liiduposRlon which I havo rcferrod to, and also from tbo fact that on ono important question ttioro Is a barrier between us, I could not accept any political obligations from my a oto " Mr, MIRAMS said the Minister for Public Works bad appealed to him for confirmation of his history of the proceedings preceding the displacement of the last Berry Govern- ment He knew nothing of those proceed- ings as detailed by the hon. gentleman. ( ' Oh.' ) All he knew of them was confined to what passed between Sir Bryan O'Loghlen and himself. Ihree days before moving the resolution Sir Bryan O Loghlen asked him if he could support it, and he answered dis- tinctly that he could not. From that posi- tion he never wavered. In his speech on the motion, when Sir Bryan O Logblen was pro Bent in the House, ho mentioned that he had told tbat gentleman before the motion was proposed tbat be did not intend to vote for it it ill became hon members on the other side to cast reflections on bia political in teprily. Mr GRAVES, who waB met with loud cues of " Divide," Bald he preaumed the numbers were up.

He hoped he bad con- ducted himself like a gentleman, and ex- pected to die as one. Six mottons hostile to the Government had been submitted, and this was the seventh, and was, he supposed, to be the fatal one No. 1 was considered a fatal or magical number. He thought that the House, after the vote of the country, ought to take certain action Ho had to the beat of his ability, and fairly and honourably, administered his department, and ho pre- sumed his colleoguea had done the same If the bon member for Castlemaine (Mr. Service), who had jumped his present position, was going to lead a party on to peace and progress, he would support the hon member, but ho doubted very much whether the hon member would do that 'Hie bon member had before taken the Kins, but lost his party. What party did the lion member belong to? (Liughtor ) Not Ins (Renewed laughter and cheers ) Au Hon Mk-ídeu -Name your party Mr GRAVES had gono into the House a liberal, and left the rankB because be was opposed to the plebiscite As to the hon. member who moved this amendment, did bon members recollect the famous speech once delivered by the hen. member for Geelong, when Chief Secretory, at Dayles- ford ' Ina debate on that Bpeech on Septem- ber 17,1878, the bon. member for Geelong, referring to the bon member for Castlemaine, (Mr Seivice) made use of strong languago. Mr. PATTERSON.-Peace. Mr GRAVES-'Ihe bon. member for Geelong said, alluding to the mover of tho present amendment - "And «hols ho, lot mo ask What position docs bo occupy 1 During most of the timo of which I spoke, tho hon nicmbor sat In tho Ministerial corner, nidlni; and os-l-tlng tho Goaernroont lu tbo position v,hkh Iii») took up What Is ho now i Docs he say he Is the loador of tho Opposition ' Since ho (Mr Graves) went into the House hist, he had seeithe bon. memberfor Castle- maine in all con ers. He did not wish to say a Bingle unkind word of anyone, but ho, for one, would refuse, under any circumstances, lo follow the bon member in every way. (Cheers) The Government had met the House, and he waa willing to foco tba posi- tion. Mr. M'INTYRE, who rose amidst loud cries of " Divide," said that he waa not goinR to allow a motion of tina aort to be divided upon without so muoh aa saying a word in reference to it, for he ftlt that what waa proposed to follow this would be degrading to bim aud to his paity in every sense of the word. Ever since I he j ear 18C5 he bad been an active supporter of the interests and the principles of what was known ab the Constitutional parti, a party which waa now about to be absolutely sacri- ficed in the event of the amendment by tbe bon. member for Castlemaine being carried-a parly which wao no longer to exist in any shape or form. He felt compelled in this matanco to toke a position which waa novel to him in hia public career -a poBition which waa likely to isolate him from those with whom he had acted ao long -but he knew that there were many in the Mmiatenal corner who aympathised with bis views, and who, if they had tho courago of their opinions, as he had, would Btrongly repudiate the unholy alliance that was likely soon to take place It waa splitting straws to talk much about how the present Govern- ment came into office, but there could be no manner of doubt of this, that the Constitu- tional party supported the motion of want of confidence in the Berry Government which wbb moved by Sir Bryan O Loghlen He (Mr M'Intyre) was ono of those who used every possible means to prevent Sir Bryan O Logh- len and his colleagues occupying the Minis- terial seats, and in the caucus not once but several times he protested The position ho lock up at that time was almost identical with that he took up now. He advocated that the motion should be under- taken by Mr Francis, or by Mr. Murray Smith, independently of the question whether Sir Bryan O'Loghlen and bia friends would bave supported the motion. The result they all knew. When Sir Bryan OLoghlon waa sent for, he (Mr. M'Intyre) was very sorry indeed to find that some members of the Constitutional party almost at onco gave him their support He regretted it very much , but he found that, as tbe Minister of Railways said, they took up the poBition that it would be mean if they did not do all they could to assist Sir Bryan to carry on. The bon member for Rodney (Mr. Gillies) knew very well that th Constitutional support waa given to th Government at the Ministerial elections 'Vi ben Ministers carno back he wbb asked if ho would move the address m reply to his Excel- lency's speech, but he declined, for reasons which he then stated, aa he felt very much annoyed at the turn affaira had taken, Very early theo wero rumours of an attempt at a coalition against the Government, and he and several of his friends determined to do all that they poBBibly could to prevent that coming about The stand he took then he again took now. He was not there to apolo- gise for the Government They had made miBtakee-and what Government had not' but tbey had had a certain amount of success, and the Constitutional party could take credit for it Ho had given notice of a motion in regard to the Ministry in which he expressed an opinion that a change was desirable, and if the amendment of the mem- ber for Castlemaine had been couched in similar language to that, and there bad been a recognition of what the Constitutional party and tho country owed to the Government, ho would have supported it What ho had to complain of just at present was tbat all the principies for which he had fought for ao many yeara were being aacri liced by the coalition proposal, and were being sacrificed because the Constitutionalist leaders had not the courage to do their duty, 'lhey should at all éventa make an effort to govern the country on constitutional lines, lie well remembered the member for Geelong complaining when he bad a strong following behind his Government of the inconvenience of a weak Opposition He wanted an organised OppOBition.BO that he could know with whom he waa fighting, and be complained bitterly that there waa no such Opposition Yet hore they Baw tho bon member endeavouring m company with the member for Castlemaine to fotm a party in the House which to all intentsand purposes would mop up both sides \\\ here in such a cbbo would bo the Oppo- sition t \\\ bo would there be to Bit on tho Opposition benches ' Mr MIRAMS-You will bo there. (A laugh ) Mr. M'INTYRE had been m a minority before Ho bad supported an Opposi tion until from four tbey had risen to thirty eight, and now all that the party had done waB to be discarded. He felt most keenly that the tiling waa scandalous , and returning to the bon. member for Geelong, he repeated that it was utterly inconsistent for him to try and bring about a weak Oppo- sition. (Laughter) '1 ho fact was that tho Constitutional part) ought to take the oppor- tunity which the country had now offered to them, and be felt perfectly certain that if a Govornment waa formed out of the straight Constitutional party a very fair and generouB support would be given to it by many wbo were now classed as Liberals (A laugh ) Let the Constitutional party take tbo bull by the horne, and let the hon, member for Geelong toke the position of leader of the Opposition He bad been in ellice for many years, he had been coneiaten to his party, and let bim not now sacrifie i himBelf for place, pay, and power ("Hear bear' and laughter) lhe feeling of the hon gentleman a party was against it, as could be shown by a quotation from a journa which had been consistently Liberal-hi meant the Bendigo Independent ( 'Oh, oh " He would read that to ehow the non gentle man that it waa felt tbat those who were joining bim were doing bo m order to squelch him, aa he would himself squelch the Educa- tion and the Tariff commissions (Loud laughter) 1 be article read - " 3ho dlo Is cast and tbo rubicon of politics Is being passed But unllko Cmaar Mr Borry play s a Bub Ecrvlentpart, and occupies tho placo ol thecommandor of a cohort merely The Conservatives ride roughshod over all that was dear to Liberals All thoBo Liberal protestations and louder boasts that wero wont to rouso tho Bllont apathy of listening crowds to a rapt cntl uslaem aro now as tho breath of tho Idlo wind 1 bo pcoplo e trust has boon v lolatod, and the pooplo s Icador bought for a few ploccB of sllv or, foraubordlnato placo and Mlnlstoiial pay umlor a Conservative loader Is it too much to Bay that Mr Berry has deliberately wrecked tbo LlbcralcaUBO? ft 19 non clearly seen that the leader was tbo traitor, and should havo expiated blB treachery on a po ltlcal Ty burn ' -(Laughter ) Mr BOWMAN -Quito true Mr. M'INTYRE-Under theEO cucum stances he would plead with the lion gentle man to avoid ob he would tbo plague-(loud laughter)-this connexion with the Conserva tive party (Renewed laughter) Ho (Mr M'Int jie) held that it was not the will of tho country or of parttea in the House that there should bo this coalition It waa pressed on bj the two leading journals of Melbourne (Hear, hear ) One of these journals-which had been Iub Alpha and Omega-took up tho positton be waa con vmccd from a feeling that it was for tho interest of the countrj, but ho hoped to bo able to ahow that it waa wrong in doing bo Ho wouid like to ask ¡he Ai<jm what would be the poBition of parties if tho proposed com binotion took place At an) rato ho could plainly foresee that 'lhe Aigus and Aqe could not possibly run m tbo same groove and support ans Muustrj which might como into power 'lhe Ai/e Bald that the hon member for Castlemaine (Mr Service) bud sold himBeif body and soul to tbo lion member for Geelong and hia followers, whtlo the Bcndtyo Independent aaaerted that the lion member for Geelong had aold himself and tho liberal party to the constitutionalists It would bo difficult to draw the moan between the two étalements, but his imprea sion was that the outcome of tho position would show that both sides had sold them- selves It would further ahow how few were tho bon members who ro tamed honourable political instincts. If the coalition were permitted to take place, no man who had political distinction would merit recognition by tho country if be took part in it There never had been euch a wholesale Bystctn of ratting as now prevailed, and instead of ratB being cried down by the press aa they had been in tbo priEt, they were now applauded to the ekj. lhe Commissioner of Public Works had put the position of the Government excellently, and regarding that gentleman personally, it niljin bo Bnid that ho had been a straight foMvardond honest administrator, as also had all his collengueB It waB not fair tha tiny should be attacked by the party wlich had supported them bo long or that an attempt should bo made to so un ceremoniously kick them downstairs The bon member for Castlemaine, in moving the n otion, said that tbe country had unmiatak al 1) declared againBt the Government, and then fore it was utmcceeeary for him to occupy ai ) limo in proposing it What wore the rienits of the election Instead of tho countrj Bpeaking out against the Govern ment it had returned the members who had supported them, and added two to thoir number. Under tboso circumBtancea could it be Bald that tbe résolution was justified by lhe verdict of the country? On the contrary, if tbo constitutional party wero honest in the support tbey had given the Government in the past they Bbould continue to support them, because nothing had occurred Binco last BCBsion, excepting it might have been tbo dissolution Even on that point the Commis- sioner of Public WorkB had shown that thero had been greater tranBgresBora in the past than the MiuiBtry. He (Mr M'Intyre) wiBbed them to be dealt with in as pleaaant a manner as poBBible, recognising as ho did that m face of the combination which existed in the Houbo it wbb bopelesB to expect them to bo continued in office any longer. It bad been said tbat tho country demanded a coalition Tbo same thing was aaid by the bon member for Geelong (Mr Borry) in 1877, but later on that hon member s expressions of thanks to all that was good for having prevented a coalition between himBelf and Mr Service wore unbounded. The bon mem- ber for Geelong ahould remember tbat ctr cumBtance, as it formed a lesson which should teach him to be very'guarded in entering any coalition now. He (Mr. M'Intyre) offered the ton member forGeelong this advice because it seemed to be generally admittod that he was the man who waa doomed to be sacri- ficed. Mr, BERRY said he was a man of sacn fices Mr M'INTYRE knew well enough what the bon members present sacrifice would amount to The bon member would take oflico for a time with the hon member for Castlemaine, and by and by when he would be unable to get certain liberal measures passed, ho would retire from the Ministry, and throw himself again on his old friends, tbo " great heart of the people Addressing his old friends, ho would then say that he joinedtbecoalitionMimstryforBeveralreasons The chief amongst the reasons would be that the constitutionalists, by taking him to their arms for a time bad condoned all his previous conduct and had whitewashed all he had done Then, his reason for leaving the Go vernment would be that he had failed to get great liberal measures carried, and had there fore returned to the people so that they might place him once more at the head of a Govern ment formed on the good old liberal lines 1 he constitutional party were thinking that tbey were nobbling the bon member but Borne believed tbat the hon member was nobbling tbem The principle of the lion and the lamb business waB being carried out, with thiB difference tbat matead of the lion lying down with the lamb the lamb would be in side the lion, and the lion on this occasion waB the constitutional party He (Mr M'Intyre) therefore warned the hon member for Geelong against the chasm he waa about to fall into They were, in fact, nobbling him with the view of destroying his influence in tbe country Mr BERRY-And that s what vexes you (Laughter ) Mr M'JNTU.E - Not at all He had always held that there should be two parties in the Btate, and that each should have its own leader The bon member for Geelong was the undoubted leader of the liberal party, and he (Mr M Intyre) wiBhed him to remain m tbat position He waB satisfied that the country would soon see the hollow nature of tbe proposed compromise The coalition had been proposed and advocated on the ground that the end would justify the meanB, but be (Mr M Intyre) contended that the means would not succeed He trusted that when the coalition took place a strong Opposition would be formed, composed of men indignant at the compromise and jealously watchful of the measures which might bo brought forward by the united party He waa looking forward with curiosity to tbe picture which the Ministerial Bide of the House would present Tancj Major Smith and Mr bervice sitting to gether with Mr Gillies, and Messrs Lang ridge, Pearson Hall and M'Coll mixed up witb Mr BoBiBto, Mr Harris, and other staunch constitutionalists I It would be a scandalous, dishonourable, and unparal- leled alliance, and he predicted that tbe coalition Ministry, however Btrong it might appear to be, would have a more difficult task than any party Government could have in conducting the business of the country His own feelings would be so Btrong in regard to the coalition that he would never be absent, if possible, from the House, but would be alva ays in his place to watch the proceedings, If there was to be a coalition, let it bo one on the principle of thot now in power j ' Ob, ob ) During its r.r/miL tbe country had been prosperous If a coalition Government were necessary, and be did not believe it waB, it Bhould be composed, not of the loading men holding opposite views, but of men who agreed to a large extent on quBtions of public importance lhe proposed coalition was confined to the beads of the two par tics But tho Constitutional party was quite strong enough to form a Government without that He believed that the time might come when the hon member for Geo long might be received aa a brother by the Constitutional party, but not yet He was the political small pox of the countt) and had not been long enough in quarantine But ho was being received now, not as a brother, but as a dangerous opponent, who was feared lins ymtleman, who bad been so much maligned An Hon Member -Ah, )0U admit now that he was maligned Mr BERRY -Yea, maligned (Cheers ) Mr M'INIÏRE-\eB, maligned (Cheers) He used that word advisedly H e knew that no matter how bad a man was-and the bon member was bad enough-he might be maligned , but now be waa to be white washed, and made part and parcel of tho Conservative party, Mr M LEAN said that as this was his first appearance in the House since the general election, and not having been able to be present at the election of the Speaker bo desired to take that opportunity of congratu latmg the Speaker, and the House on the wiedom of its choice He hoped that the Speaker would long continue to discharge the high and honourable duties of his office Tri ith regard to tbe question at issue, bo merely rose to express tbe hope that the members of the Government would not push this question to a division but would accept the decision of the House on the voices In doing so he did not wiBh any bon member to think that bo suggested this from any deeire to evade any responsibility 'lo dispel any idea of that kind, he would tell the Houeo before he sat down the way in which he would vote if the question were forced to a division But ho thought the course be had suggestod was the moBt dignified and proper for the Government to take He wes not one of those who hav mg used the Government for certain purposes had not a kind word to say of them now He considered that in view of the great difficulties which they had to contend with, they had done very good work for the country Ihey had carefully avoided all party strife and burning questions and bad endeavoured to corry on legislation of a practical and useful nature He also I bought that they deserved very great credit lor having done more perhapB than any prevu ub Government to forward the interests of the country distncta He trusted that their examjlo in that reBpect would be followed by their successors Ho was quito with tho bon member for Kyneton (Mr Young) in deprecating the action of those bon members who lirBt supported the Railway Bill and then denounced it ob a bribery bill He (Mr M Lean) voted for tbat bill because ho be liev ed that it would do moro to Dromote the interests of the country diBtncts than almost any other bill Butwhilohoheldthcsoopiuions he could not conscientiously with lim pledges to his constituents support the Govern ment if this volo were pressed to a division He told his constituents ho would if returned f,o back as n member of the Constitutional part) and that if that party returned aufli ciently strong to form a Government ho would sit behind them He also Bald that it tile preaent Government were aufliciently strengthened to enable them to carry on buBiueSB with advantage to the country he would continue to give them independent support But ho could not now vote for the Government Instead of having been strengthened they had been materially weak ened In their reaäons for a dissolution which they submitted to the Governor, they said they could not carry on tbo business ad vautngeoUBly unless they were strengthened 1 vcryone knew the result of the appeal to the country, and he hoped the Government would accept the decision of the country in the nioBt graceful and digniGed manner pos Bible b) not calling for a division Mr B0SIS1O remarked that the lion member for Maldon bad said that the Ministry had alleged they would resign if another Administration could bo formed from tho constitutional side Along with that lion member and two or three others he bad boen U)ing to get the Ministry to reBign and allow a constitutional Government to be formed Seme of the existing MmiBtera being part and parcel of the Constitutional patty it waa be had considered desirablo that such Ministers ¡?hould, along with other constitutionalists try and see if a constitutional Government could be formed and maintained But he had never beard the offer mentioned by the hon member for Maldon that tbe whole of the prcBent MiniBtry would retiro if a con etitutional Government was formed It was found, however, that the constitu lonaliBts were not strong enough to form a Government and that somoof them would not oalesce with others Therefore, in the interests of the country, the matter bad to be looked at from another point of view, and as some of the constitutionalists would not assiBt tbo others tho only alternative was to form a moderate coalition Govern ment Peaco and progress and practical legislation were wanted by the country, and he would assist any coalition Government that would brtiiL, forward practical and bene Coal measures Mr BENT said that the bon monaber who last spoke waa present when the -who'e Ministr) declared they would resign provided a straight constitutional Gove'nment was formed Mr BOSISTO -Never Mr BENT-The bon members for Rodney (Mr Gillies) and EoBt Bourke were also told that would be done He told the hon member for Warrnambool months ago that four of tbe office

He certainly did expect that the hon. member for Fitzroy ¡Mr Tucker) would not have gone behind his (Mr. Bent's) book as he had done to tell Mr Lavater how he should prepare the "turn to hiB motion regarding the appoint meats , _, Mr, TUCKER.-That is not true. The accountant wrote to me and asked whether I wanted certain information, and I said that the order was by the House, and it waa for the officers of the departments to interpret it, I addressed the reply to the secretary of the department, because I thought that Mr. Lavater should not have written to ma Mr. BENT.-At any rate, what had boea aaid Bhowed that the communication was made without his (Mr. Bent's) knowledge. Vi as it not ridiculous for hon. members when ¿efi - the country to speak of his abuse of patronage m the department-or, as the hon. member for the Ovens expressed it, to aocuse him of having reprinted the Irish directory ? That bon. member wao nearly pat out at the election, and if a mau had not forgotton to lodge bia nominotion paper he would have teen put out. He obtained a great deal more prestige from the Iriah in tina colony than ever he (Mr. Bent) obtained, and any reference to the Irieh question came with very bad grace from him. It waa wicked- ness on the part of tho hon. member, and the hon. member for Castlemaine (Mr. Patterson), to use their poaitiona for the purpose of causing Btnfe, and no doubt they would be turned out of the Houbo before long, They had the gratification of having defeated Sir Bryan O'Loghlen because he wai a Roman Catholic, but a revulsion of feelins was approaching, and there waa even at present a general feeling of regret among all sections of the community at the loss of tha' able man from the House. Would any othor men stoop to the low acts which were prac- tised lby some personB during the elections persons who could not obtain livings in any other way ' Young and energetic men who weie able to earn their livinga would not re sort to such dirty tncka. He had hoped Ibnt tho old barnacles would have been thrown out, and that new members would have been aent into the House. It was said that good Bteady mon were wanted in the team, but what had the bon. member for Castlemaine (Mr Service) done? He (Mr. Bent) was in a Government with that gentleman, sad he (Mr Service) advised a dissolution, winch brought a grand party to rain, He iras declared by the present Opposition to be a failure as a financier, and how many time, had the bon member for Geelong (Mr. Berry) laid the hon member for Warrnambool was a failure' The reason of tbeir opposition »as now well known. They said that they would not go the country with Sir Bryan 0 Loghlen as their leader. They were nilling that he should be their Attorney Genera), but probably he did not want th.it ellice so much aa others of their num- ber, to whom it was a means of livelihood. He was not fit to cope with theBe men. He did not understand bow to fight men who distorted or misrepresented facts. It would be interesting, when the proposed coalition look place, to look up the speeches of the new Ministers, and to seo what they had said about each other in the past. An Eos, Member -And your own on Berry, Mr, BENT -Bent still adhered to what he had Baid about Berry, and still condemned the Black Wednesday proceedings in particu- lar, but the constitutionalists as a party were apparently going to receive the leader of the black Wednesday Government with open arms. The party referred to were not actuated by any love for the hon. member for Geelong, but simply wished to break him in aud to ruin him as a political leader. The bon. member, however, would probably prove too much for them. He could only characterise the proposed union as an un holy marriage, or a piece of politic ii prostitution.

He maintained that there had never been such a good time for all parties, from commercial travellers down- ward a, aa there waa during the OXogh len Government's tenure ot office. He cared not for the remarks of a man wbo called tbe Government a lot of " unmiti- gated muffs," and if that man were present bo would ask him what was the difference between " unmitigated muffs " and drunken unmitigated muffs. ("Shame.") Mr. ZOX rose to order. The Minister of Railways bad no right to make use of such an expression. If it was Parliamentary, it waa disgraceful, and if it was not Parliamentary, it waa still more disgraceful. The SPEAKER.-Tho term is not Parlia- mentary as applied to an hon. member. Mr. BOLTON.-He did not apply it to ony hon. member. .he SPEAKER.-The expression ranat be witbdrawn. Mr. BENT withdrew the remark. Some bon gentlemen seemed to think that the Government were acting unconstitutionally in not having resigned two or three days ago, but there were authorities to ahow that it was tbe proper thing for the Government to meet Parliament, defend themselves, and only go out by the will of the House. The rortmuhtiy Renew had an article on thiB, Mr. MIRAMS.-Which assumes that the Government has a party. Mr BENT.-That did not alter the fact. If this authority was not enough for the hon. gentleman, there waa the opinion of hia leader, the member for Geelong (Mr. Berry), 'lhat hon. gentleman said be would never resign again in tbe way be did before, but would meet the House. The Government bad then adopted the constitutional course If tbey bad resigned before now, the Governor might have made a mistake and Bent for the hon member for Mandurang (Mr. M'Coll), or tbe hon. gentleman that had got in by such a large majority in North Mel- bourne (Mr. Laurens), As it waa, simul- taneously with their resignation would be received a telegram stating the success of the loan, nnd tho credit for that could not be taken by tho talented ex-treasurers who were to join handa in the new Ministry. He thanked the House for having listeuod to him, and bad now only to say he would fol- low the same course as he pursued when the Service Government waa put out of office He would never Bay die, and although the present Government might be put down for a time, they would soon bave a resurrection. Mr BOWMAN said he was thoroughly opposed to any olliance between the bon members for Castlemaine and Geolong Ho did not recogniBe the hon. member for Geelong as the leader of the Liberal party. There was a distinction betweon liberalism and Berryiem. The former had for ita object the good of the country, the latter meant selfishness, place, and pay. When he found men sent there aa mere Berryite toola, and bowing down to their loader aa if he waa a little god, he was disgusted, Those mon actually pledged themselves to the hon. member for Geelong without any idoa of the kind of measures he would bring in. The hon. member for Geelong had indeed been a traitor to the Liberal party, and bad been denounced as a notorious office seeker by the leading Liberal organ An alliance between bim and the bon. member for Castle- maine would result in no good to the country. Had tho Constitutionalists only acted up to their political principles, and bad tbo cou rage to stand forward by themselves on thia occasion, they would have aucceoded m fortu- it g a etrong Government, for they would have hud the support of 12 men fromtheOppoaition corner whom tbo Berry party bad endeavoured to blackball by opposing thom at the recent elections As it was, tbe hon. member for Geelong could only muBter 25 Bupportera. Mr M'INIYRE - Hepromiaos30 Mr BOWMAN did not know where he waa to get them Supposing, however, the coali- tion Ministry formed, would the hon. member /or Geelong (Mr, Berry) attempt to carry out the threat be made to bia constituents that the moment ho re entered office he would oboliBh the Education Commission' He (Mr. Bowman) would watch the hon mem- ber's conduct in connexion with that matter with much intereat Aa to the present Go vernment, bo held that it deaorved more con Bideration at tho hands of the House than it waa receiving. They wero bound to roliu quiBh office now, but the amendment of the hon. member for Castlemaine waa of too sweeping a character oltogether. 'lhe question was put and the amendment agreed to without a division. Mr SERVICE then moved " lhat a committee bo appointed to draw up a ro fipectful addrees to Hld Excollonoy tho Qoveraor, such ion mlttco to consist of Mr Derry, Mr M'Loan, Mr Tucker, Mr Ilaipor, Mr Walker, Mr Bell, and Mr Ectvice, and that the conimltteo do rotlru at onco " Agreed to.
