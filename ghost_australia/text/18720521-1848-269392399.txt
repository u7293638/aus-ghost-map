THE POLRTSI-CATI SITUATIOK. \- Osr' Friday morning dast the ) vernment obtained a majority of two on the division on Mt. PiU-Kcls's •amendment, but it appeals" that the debat.e upon the, address -is by no means yet at an end, for .this evening" the Ministry will have to meet yet another, amendment, .which--has been* tabled by Mr. Bent, bat which/of cnuf.se proceeds from the same source c» the one just defeated. The hon^ member .lor ^Brighton could not,' i sfeems,-reconcjle it with his.-conscience^ to turn out the Ministry upon • -the' 1 liducatiom question, --biftMhe nowfeels^ it to be his duty to his constituents _ to challenge the appointments i nthat h?ve recently been' made by the \- Government, and he is willing to place himself in the hands qf Messrs i"UA.HCI3 and Co. in order that he may be used for the occasion, and then remitted to that political, obscurity from which for the moment he lias emerged.'--' If anything had; b.epn want-, ing to prove the facjtious nature ofdhe opposition now being offered to jthe Government, the course adopted after the rejection of Mr. EKAKGIS'S amexitlment will be quite sufficient to >sKow to the country' 'that not a single, opportunity wilLbe lost of hounding the. Ministry v from -the ; Treasufy f Benches, and that, on the failurejf&f; one attack, anothePsubject for assault will be held in .readiness, and an effectual stoppage put uponlegislation of any kind. What the Ministry in- • tend to do for the- country; has been feet before^ it in the pjogramme con taiaed in the Governor's speech. The policy of tho. Opposition' app(3ars to be simply to prevenfelhe-pohcy of ;the Government from being carried into effect^and J t appears to us that it is for the country now to say whether the existing Assembly' shall be permitted to postpone all practical legislation, and spend the present ! session in a continuation of the disgraceful scenes which have" distinguished the recent debater ^It-'is'- evident feom the bitter and.unrelenting animosity that c lias been; displayed towards the Government and their "supporters"that the Opposition will not Resist from ,,lh<eir attacks-- ,imtil they- ihave ^o„rc,ed the Ministry to resignOT place 'selves inlhehatidso¥theTConstitueneteS,' jmd<in-or<ler'tEafi ihe pubic ibusincs^s •" • " ' "" loll crer .„ , •.„„•? of ^th^ .country ttifled «m£h,^no fame shouM« t e be loet ini^lloiv^ing -the/ppeple! to igjara eipxession to their opinions of the conduct of 1 ^eir-jf Eepipserifafiv^s Constituted as thecAsseiably sent, atchange'of Ministry could rn" Co practical tl follow&om;^sSch % £03iijie, for, whilst no Ministry selected from the ranks of be dealing with the"question of E£ueati<s©f: anjife^-^mlMufc formed from such f k^fUjof IhV^WlS®! vT h i-Vi'-Y s^l S4, ,, ds gracexul>6quab oilng Mor plat e. - lbe amendment just defeated was a paltry 1 evasion, and ought to have been one j directly placing the House of a want ot coniidencp^fc^ present Administration.
