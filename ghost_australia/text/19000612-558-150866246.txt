A SPECTRE HAND. The ghosts which are said to fre quent the precincts of Hampton Court Palace are more or less known by reputation, but their ramblings have been promiscuous and uncertain. Great interest in their movements has, however, been newly aroused by the ■ strange experience undergone by an artist who, recently, has been visiting certain rooms of the palace for the purpose of sketching the old Flemish tapestry on the walls. Whilst en gaged in tho Guard .Watching Chamber in broad daylight—for the room is closed to the public at six o'clock—this gentlemaD, Mr Haynes, of Surbiton, positively asserts that a spectre hand, white and delicate and richly jewelled, has persistently intru. ded between him and the tapestry. At firstheimagined the disturbing element must be one of tho many hands so beautifully inscribed on tho tapestry, but tho limb, he says, moved slowly from one stage to another, and pointed downwards. Mr Haynes was much agitatod, and told several friends of this curious visitation. They, not unnaturally perhaps, advised him to dismiss tho subject from his mind'and return to the chamber and his work. But the hand reappeared before his startled eyes; and on the last appear ance of the phantom the artist made a hurried eketch of the outstretched hand, tho rough outline of which depicts a brilliant marquise ring on the forefinger. The effect of these continued visits of the supernatural on Mr Haynes is 'very visible; he is unnerved, and he has suspended his skefcking. These are the plain fact's, but there is, it would seem, a woird and historic connection between this hand and the hand of the Queen Catherine Howard, one of the wives of King Henry VJ-Li.
