WHIlE I LIVE. BE TRUE. Mako mo no vows of constancy, dear friend — To love me, though I die, thy whole lifo long, And love no otlier till thy days shall end — Nay— it were rash and wrong. If thou canst love another, he it so ; I would not reach out my quiet grovo To bind thy heart, if it should choose to go. Love should not be a slave. My placid ghost, I trust, will walk serene - In clearer light than gilds theeo earthly moons, ' Above the jealousies and envies keen Which sow this life with thorns. Thou wouldst not feel my shadowy caress, If, after death, my soul should linger hero ; Men's hearts crave tangible, closo tenderness, Love's presence warm and near. It would not make me sleep more peacefully That thou wert wasting all thy life in woe. For my poor sake, what love thou hast for mo Bestow it ore I go. Carve not upon a stone when I am dead The praises which remorseful mourners give To women's graves — a tardy recompense — But speak them while I live. Heap not the heavy marble on my head, To shut away the sunshine and the dew ; Let small blooms grow there, and tho grasses wave, And raindrops filter through. Thou wilt meet many fairer and more gay Than I — but trust me, thou canst never find . One who will love and serve thee, night and' day, With a more single mind. Forget me when' I die; the violets / Above my rest will blossom just as blue, Nor miss thy tears ; e'en Nature's self forgets; But'while I live bp true.
