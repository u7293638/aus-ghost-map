ECHOES OF MELBOURNE [By The Ghost.] : . How true it is that the evilmen do lives after them! The Parliament that placed the Shops and Factories Act on the Statute Book has gone the way of all triennial Parliaments, but its legacy of crude and ill-digested ' grandmotherly' legislation still remains to disturb the piece of tho colony. The Assembly has given fresh point to the well-known fable of the old man and his ass, and in its endeavour to please employers and employed has simply succeeded in pleasing neither, and in virtually setting them both by the ears. Framing acts of Parliament in such a way as to allow of their principal provisions being overridden by City and Municipal Coun cillors is assuredly an experiment which even so inexperienced a politician as Mr. Deakin is not likely to repeat. Fortu nately for the good name of the colony, the police have succeeded in restoring order j but during three evenings the chief thoroughfares of the cities of Fitzroy and Collingwood and; the. town: of Richmond were quite as much in the hands of the mob as were the approaches of Trafalgar Square in those of the London roughs on'th'e ocbasion, of the . late r Social-, istic' demonstration. ; In its^present 'shaped the act, to. \relieye the;' overworked '[, ) sliop assistants from their long, J hours of druid-; gory, has been , proved jto be: unworkable, | and those :for whoso benefit it was specially, designed havo' very little to be thankful'' for. Employes are now permitted 'to' eii- !gage themselves to their employers' 'for 'an indefinite number of hours' per week, and as 'the res arigusta :.'. ddmi cbtnpelO.the majority of unfortunate shop assistants to meet the, wishes of the more .grasping and, money-grubbing shopkeepers in .regard ito keeping open until a late - hour; even ; the poor privilege of grumbling — the ono in herent right of tho Briton of which neither ?King, Lords, or Commons can deprive. him — is thus bartered away, by what; :by : a legal fiction is: called the voluuta'ry act.. The blame of . perpetuating the ? '' white; slavery ' of shopmen and shopwomen rests,; .however, with the artisan and. labouring ; classes.' : They have succeeded in securing for themselves the boon of eight hours ;as: the length of a legal day's 'work, 'and are1 npw;careless of 'the; rights and' comfort of1 everyone else. .

Indeed, 'there' are people'in our midst who would fain : treat any intending1 competitors in ; the local labour market in the same irihbs-' pitable. fashion as Mr. Harper's- , sheep, imported from England by. the. R.M.S. Parramatta on her last visit to our shores, : were treated. And apropos, of this sheep episode, is it not rather an arrogant: and short-sighted policy on the part:-of;the: flockowners of Victoria to favour ;regulafr tions absolutely prohibiting the impprta'-' tion of live stock ;6f',all kinds, frpm.cpuii tries beyond seas? Are. the herds;!' and; flocks of Australia not capable of, .improve-: ment by the infusion of new and improved! strains of the best bovine and ovine blood of France, Germany, and England ? .The sheep arid cattle breeders who'- in a' high state of alarm interviewed the' Com missioner of Customs are 'apparently [ot opinion that there is no improvement' ppsr sible, and insisted upon the imported longr wools being kept out of the colony. ;/Mr. Harper by a little finesse and monoauvring managed to ? outwit the Customs cfflcials, arid succeeded in the face of the regula tions in landirig his , eight , stud sheep and lodging them within the. walled enclosure of the sugar works at Sandridge. His triumph was, hoveyer, short lived. Directly the news reached the Government, which happened at the time to be assembled at a Cabinet meeting, peremptory orders were issued for the im mediate execution of the new arrivals, the sentence — Mr. Harper's earnest protest to the contrary notwithstanding— being carried out during the course of tho evening and the carcases of the victims burnt. Surely even the intelligence of the Australian squatter ought to bo equal to devising some better means than total prohibition for keeping disease out of their flocks ! Scab, that dread disease to which ovine flesh is heir, was not many years ago prevalent in all the Australian colonies. It was stamped out by judicious management and strict legal supervision. And this; being so itjdoes seemTjust a little ridiculous that no proper and effectual means of pre venting the introduction of animal disease into the colonies \ short of actual prohibition ?, : : : . ; can bejtak'enipn one hypothesis is thecburse-; '''.... . , itaken jbyj'th'e ,gentlemen,\whb insisted on\\-; .',' , i- thedestructionofiMri Harper's stud ;sheep-j , , , - 'comprehensible.
