NUMMARY FOR ETJEOPE. POLITICAL. "Tho Government during tho fortni ?havo devoted thoir attention entirol; . mattera of administration, and no fa ? thoy aro concerned thoro is nothing A political character to notice. Sir Br, O'Loghlcn and some of his colleag were present at the annual gatherinj tho St. Patrick's Society on tho 2 hist. Dr. Dobson, tho Solicitor-Gone and Mr. Young, tho Minister of Pul Works, spoke at the dinner given by ^towards of tho LTeidolborg Show on 23rd. At neither of those entorts nients, however, did Ministers make official utterance or givo any indicat of thoir intontions rogarding tho p ceedings of Parliament. Nothing furtl haB been nnnounced rogarding their p grainmo than what was stated in tho 1 summary, and it is now gonorally und etood that the bills to bo submitted v bo thoso which wero before the Legh turo when the prorogation took pla ?with tho addition of others airea enumerated dealing with non-politi matters. His Excolloncy the Governor, havi left the colony on a visit to Queonslav. Sir Bryon O'Loghlon is acting as Pro dont of tho Executive Council. 1 Marquis of Normanby, after landing Brisbane, procoeded to the Logan Riv where his son, Lord Henry Phipps, engagod in Bugar planting. The Marqi was well received at Brisbane, and t principal residents have arranged to enh tain him at a banquot prior to his dopi turo from Queensland. He is expect to return to Melbourno next wook. Mr. Berry addressed his constituents Geelong on Friday evening, and althou ho spoko for a considerable time ho so nothing that demands particular attc tion. The downfall of his last Govoi mont, and the refusal of His Excellen to grant a dissolution, were dwelt up at length, and subsequently ho review tho progress made by the colony duri his four years of office, and tho action his Government in improving t' -defences and in othor matters. Final! ho condemned tho Water Conservati. Bill of the Government, tho Educatlt and Tariff Commissions,'and declarod th ho was favourable to the ro-purchaao alienated lands, in order to establish ti leasing principle throughout tho colon Ho received a vote of confidence. Defence measures continuo to rocei' tho attention of tho Government. C tho 20th inst. Sir Bryan O'Loghloi Mr. Bent, Colonel Scratchley, at Major Bull visited the forts at Po Phillip Heads. The works at Queen cliff, Point Nepean, andSwanlsland woi inspected, and improvements resolví upon which will be executed within eigl months, and will complete the equi| mont of the fortifications. Pending ti arrival of the Alpha Beta gunboats, an the Thornovcroft torpedo launches, has been decided to temporarily repa the Cerberus boilers, and place tho Octi pun, now in Gipps Land, at the servit ?of the Torpedo Corps, which is I bo re- organised under the control i Messrs. Ellery and Josephs. The tende of Messrs. Forman and Co. has bee accepted for supplying now boilers t tho Cerberus, and they aro to bo fitto within ten months. The Nelson la no' in tho Alfred graving dock boing r< caulked and otherwise renovated, to li her for service if required. The Cerberus ponding the completion of tho nei boilers, will be stationed at tho Head and UEed aa a battery. Tho Governmon «nginoor rpports that at proanrif a oni ii cient head of steam may be genorate -with safety to drive tho vessel at the rat of four knots an hour, which will onabl hor to bo moved whenever necessary. Tho erratic administration of tho Rail .way department continues to attrac attention, and vigorous comments hav been made upon Mr. Bent's mothod o -transacting Borne portions of the bual ness of his office. A deputation fron the suburbs of Brunswick and Gobur; waited upon the Minister of Railways oi the 15th inst., and received rather dia courteous treatment. They wero anxioui to learn tho Intentions of the Ministe regarding the construction of the author ised line to Brunswick and Coburg. I ?was sanctioned in 1880, and tenders hai soveral tlmeB been called for, but nothinj has boen dono beyond that initial pro coeding towards letting a contract for th( ?work. Tho " perpetual postponements ' caused much uneasiness, and whei tenders were again invited, to bo sub mitted on the 23rd inst., the resi dents were not confident that evoi then there was likely to bo i termination to the dolay. Thoy ac cordingly desired to be informed If tht announcement was genuine, but Mr, Bent declined to give thom any dofinitc reply. Ho demanded an explanation ol tho remarks mado at an indignation mooting to tho effect that the "hnewaE ?being kept back by Sir Bryan O'Loghlen," and as none was forthcoming, he stated that tho matter would havo to bo fought out in Parliament. Dean O'Hoa, and Mr. R. Ramsay, M.L.A., each had a rather severe " wrangle" with the Minis- ter, and the deputation withdrew after a thoroughly unsatisfactory interview. Mr. Bent's indiscreet behaviour was gonorally disapproved of, and it was remarkable that after so stoutly refusing to give any definite explanation of his intontions, he accepted tho tender of Mr. Robert Thompson, at £52,082 lGs., on the 23rd inat., for tho work. Another important public transaction has been the lotting of the contract for supplying 0,970 cast iron.water pipos,from flin, to 2áin. in diameter, for the new Yan Toan mains, which are to give an in- creased supply of water to the city and BuburbB next summer. Thoro was an agitation among tho operative iron founders to induce the Government to lay down conditions which would virtually havo limited the tendering to local com- petitors. Headed by Mr. Berry, Major Smith, and other prominent members of the protection party, they waitod upon Mr. Young, Commissioner of Public Works, ostensibly for the purposo of re- questing an extension of the timo within which the specifications aet forth that tho 24-inch pipes must be delivered, in ordor that the local firms might be ona blod to supply them. But they did not confine themselves to that point. Each speaker wandered through the stook argumonts advanced by the Victorian school of protectionists, and clearly indi- cated that what was required was abso- lute prohibition of British or foreign competition. Mr. Young, however, combatted those representations, and declared that apart from his In . dividual disinclination to accept the views of tho deputation, there wore ur- gent public reasons why the supply to the outlying suburbs for next sum- mer should not bo jeopardised in the interests oí any firm. He showed -clearly that Mr. Patterson, as Minister of Public Works, in 1878 accepted a Vic- torian tonder for the manufacture in the ?colony of a large quantity of pipes, at a virtual loss of £18,000 to the Govern- ment. That tender, however, was aban- doned by the person who submitted it, arid an importer's offer was subse .quently accepted on most advantageous terms. Parliament, he said, had fixed the protection to bo afforded to local founders at a duty of £2 per ton on im ported pipos, and boyond that ho would not go But even if ho wore inclined to pay a higher pnco for tho local ma lufac turo, ho waB asaurod by the only firm which could tondor that they had no avail able plant for tho manufacturo of tho pipoB, and could not supply them within tho time statod On the following day, tho 23rd mst, tho tenders wore oponed, und that of Messrs John Blj th and Co , importers, who undertook to supply pipos at £8 11B lid per ton, waa accepted Thoro waa but ono Victorian tondor, which didnot include the sizes from Oin tol2in , and the rate was upwardB of 10a por ton m advance of the price asked by the importers Apart from this, however, it waB Bot forth in tho oflbr that two months longer than waa specified would be ro quired to completo tho contract Moaars D and W Robertaon, of Sydney, ton dercd by tolcgiara at a lower figuio than that accopted, but their offor was rojectod on account of its allowed informality The COBO of Mr A B, Walha, sooro tory for Agriculture, who was suspended early in february by Mr Young, was dealt with by a board consisting of Mesars EPS Sturt, O Mollison, and W Templeton Three chargea were pro ferred against Mr Wallis as follows - 1 " That tho secretary for Agriculture in September, 1881, gave private instruo tiona to tho mombers of tho board ap pointed under section 10 of tho Vino DisonaeB Eradication Act, that they wore not to allow moro than the valuo of two ycara' crops as compensation for vinos destroyed under section 8 of tho act abovemontionod 2 " That tho soere tary for Agriculture denies In an oihcial memorandum, dated 10th February, 1882, that ho so informed the Mmistor of Agri- culture, in tho Miniater's room, on tho 1st of the samo month, on tho occasion of a deputation of vignerons waiting on tho Minister, and such denial is contrary to tho fact and truth of tho matter ' 3 " That the secretary for Agriculture, without authority, instructed tho morn bers of tho boforomontionod hoard as to tho compensation tiley wero to allow " Messrs Sturt and Mollison found that only tho second charge was suatainetl, but added that Mr Wallis waa evidently con fused when he waa at the doputation, and could not be considered as having made the Btatcmont with an untruthful intent Mr Tomploton considered it nocesaary to submit a separate roport, m which he ex pressed the opinion that neither the first nor the second chargea waa substantiated, but that tho third waa proved Tho30 findings were conaidorod by tho Cabinet on Friday last, anditwaadooided that tho office Mr Walba hold should be abolished and the services of that gentleman dis penaed with, ho boing allowed to retiro, and to receivo compensation amounting to about £500 Mr Charles Kernot, ono of the repre son tat lv ea of Goolong in the Legislativo Assembly, and a colleague of Mr Berry's, died on Sunday last, after six months' lllnesB Mr Kernot entered Parliament in 1808, but lost his seat in 1871 Ho was returned again in 1870, and romained In tho Assembly until February, 1880, whon ho was defeated by Mr Andrews However, he was re elected in July, 1880, and hold his place until the fimo of his death Mr Kernot votod steadily with the Berry party, and was a faithful adherent of tho protec tionist division of the House, but on many quontions-notably payment of mombors, which he opposed-he differed from his UBUOI associates in política Mr Kernot very seldom spoke Ho was much respected by Ina fellow members He died at the ago of 02, and was a colonist of 31 years standing SOCIAL AND GENERAL Some time ORO Mr Francis Ormond, a gentleman who bos frequently ahown unusual liberality and benevolence promised £J 000 l-Aa thn f lrwI f". »u . - .-. .

The 2 o'clock train from Flinders- street to Windsor was standing at the Windsor platform at about 2.18 p.m., when the 2.9 p.m. " express" from Melbourne to Brighton rushed into the station, and struck the stationary train, sending it some 200 yards along the line. The " express" was crowded with passengers and between 16 and 20 persons were sitting in the other train. Happily the reaults of the collision were less serious than might have been expected. No life was lost, and the rolling stock was but slightly damaged. The passengers, however, received a severe shaking, and a number of them sustained slight cuts and bruises. Some of them have not yet been pronounced out of danger, and it is likely that the Government will have to meet several claims for com- pensation for injuries received through the collision. The general traffic manager has attributed the whole of the blame to the driver of the Brighton express, who he con- siders, ran his train recklessly. He is of opinion that had the train been fitted with a continuous brake the accident would have been avoided, and he suggests that an ex- ample should be made in this case in order to induce greater caution among the drivers generally. A departmental board has in- quired into the accident, but its report has not been made public. During the past fortnight the theatres have been doing a good business, and the public bave bad a choice and varied assortment of dramas submitted to them At the Theatre Royal the " Lancashire LasB ' was produced with fair BuccesB, and this waa followed by the 'Comedy of Errors, in which Mr. HoakinB, an old Melbourne celebrity, sus- tained the character of Dromio of Syracuse, and the two Antiphoh were represented by the Messrs Hollowoy The play was well placed on the stage, and the acting through- out waa highly creditable On Saturday night, at this theatre, Mr George Rtgnold made his appearance in "Youth, a senna tional drama The Australian Juvenile Opera Company produced ' H M S Pinafore at the Opera-house for a few mghta, after which a dramatic season WOB entered upon by Mr Wyberfc Reeve He commenced with ' The Money Spinner, a comedy drama, which though improbable in ita plot, never- theless contains many elements of attraction " The Professor still draws large houses at the PrincesBB Theatre and there IB every probability that its run will be extended for Borne time longer The management of the Bijou Theatre have brought forth several dramas in rapid succession, including " Our Boya,' "Still Waters Run Deep, and an American comedy entitled The Big Bonanza On the night of the 27th inst a season of opera in English, under the management of Signor De Vivo, waa com- menced at this theatre Thecompanyincludes amongst its principals Misa Annie Montague, Mr CbarleB Turner, Mr r Tarley, Mr Gordon, Mr Templeton, and otberB well known here, sufficient to make up an ejjôu tg MHMtftfä»TTn7?<,Boh*emianGirr' was the firBt work chosen for representation, and has been produced with great saccesB "Mignon' is promised soon Wilbon's Circus, after a moat Buccesafnl season, will leave Mel bourne at the end of this week m order to mini engagements elsewhere The Mendelssohn Quintette Club of Boston returned to Mel bourne from Adelaide in time to keep en gagement at a great musical "At Home' given by the Mayor of Melbourne, Mr C J Ham in the Town hall, on Thursday even- ing, 23rd March MiaB Rosina Carandim Miss Cora R.

Admiral Aalanbegoff, visited Melbourne The squad- ron IB on a crmae from the Pacific station, and came here via San Francisco and Sydney The arrival of the vesBela baa been turned to account by the profeaaional EcnBation mongers, and more particularly by the publication m a morning newspaper of an article professing to make disclosures respecting an approaching declaration of war by Russia, to he followed by a descent on Melbourne The story told to the public in all gravity, and with many protea tahona of good faith, is that the RasBian Admiral waa in consultation m Mel bourne with a foreigner giving the name of Bryant To Bryant, Admiral ABlanbegoff ia supposed to have communicated the con- tents of a secret despatch from the Russian Minister of Marine, and Bryant claims that he »BBiBted Admiral ABlanbegoff to prepare a tclegrapbio reply in oypher The alleged instructions were that the Admiral should ascertain the condition of the Australian defences, the amount of contribution each colony could pay( and whether the Irish .vould assist the invaders It was directed that the squadron after leaving Shanghai Bhould coal at Fiji and proceed to New Cale- donia or the New Hebrides, " by which time war will have been declared," and then the 1 swoop ' would be made on Melbourne The Admiral is represented as telegraphing in reply that he has fulfilled his mission, that Melbourne is at his mercy, and that the riches and stores here are incalculable The absolute character of the announce ment that the despatches were genuine led many people to believe in them at first sight, but a second glance was sufficient to Bhow the hundred and one absurdities of the position The public was asked to believe that the Rusaian Government, m a time of pro- found peace, and indeed of amicable rela tiona with England, suddenly conceived the plan of sending a fleet to levy a war contribution on the Australian colonies It desired in tho first instance to procure some information relative to the pecuniary means and defensive equipment of our ports, and it determined, by way of keeping its designB a profound secret, to employ a war squodron to come here and collect the infor- mation When the admiral waa here he had to eena home some telegrams about the facts he bad learned and the designe he had to carry out, and to secure the perfect secrecy of these despatches he took into his confidence a nondescript person, of whom all that is known is that he describes himself as a Nihilist Mr Bryant affably assisted the Admiral to S repare his confidential despatch and imme lately after the Bquadron quitted AUB tralia felt himself impelled by a sense of loyalty to go and make a clean breast of the matter to a newspaper for pay 'Ihe Aigus next day published the true story Our inquiries allowed that Lieutenant Friede richs, a Russian naval officer who has been left in Melbourne invalided, knowe the man Bryant, and so doea Mr J, G Damyon, tho Hufeinn consul Bryant, it seems, submitted a torpedo to the Admiral (to be used pre Bumably to deBtroy the Victorian defences and the Victorian shipping ) Admiral Asian begolT thought sufficiently of the new engine to telegraph Bryant s offer to sell the weapon for 0,000 roubles, he to be taken to Europe to perfect the invention When at Adelaide the Admiral received a telegram in reply, stating that the offer was declined Bryant wau communicated with, and not bsing able to make mcney one way he endeavoured to effect lim purpose in another 'Hie Australian preaa, almost without ox ception, repudiated the hoax

tranaferrmg the architect a branch of the department to the Public W orita department, and that he did not think that the period of compulaory attend anco at Behool should be increased from 30 to 40 days in each quarter With regard to appointments and promotions, he Bind the recommendations of the officera of the de partaient had frequently been overridden bj the MiniBter on the recommendation of membera of Parliament When Major Smith waa Minister the officers were directed, when appointments were to be made, to furnish him with the recommendations which mern bera of Parhament had placed in the depart ment, but that system waa atopped when Mr Grant, the preaent Minister, took office There had been caaes in which the Minister had selected Bitea for schools different from thoao the officera of the department had recommended, and aleo cases in which more cxpeneive schools had been built than they adviBed As to the school ages, Mr Balam thought children of from four to foar and a half years should not be excluded from Behool, and that thoBe who had reached what waa called the etandard, should not be sent out of the schools because tbey had done so, but should bo encouraged to remain until they had passed through the 0th class Mr Bastow, the architect, was also examined, principally on the question of amalgamating the architect s branch of the Education de partment with that of the Public Worka department Ho was opposed to such a coûtée, and stated that he believed it would not only not effect anything like the saving anticipated, but would be productive of great delay in carrying out the worka He pre Bented some totuma which Bhonred that the coBtof the architects branch haa averaged CJ per cent on the money expended on build inga during the last nine yeara THE TARirr COMMISSION The examination of witnesses on Baddlery and harness waa resumed by the Tariff Com mission on the 14th Match Mr Gatenby, who stated that he was the oldest member of the trade m Melbourne, waa examined at considerable length He expressed himself m favour of protection, on the ground that it bad assisted saddlers to extend their opera tiona, and to pay their hands higher wages The number of saddlers and barnoBsmakers in and around Melbourne, according to Mr Gatenby, bad increased from leaa than 100 before the imposition of the tariff to 700 or 800, and there had been an mcreaae of wagea of fully 30 per cent The value of this evidence was, however, considerable reduced by the discovery that the whole of the employés in the colony engaged in saddle and harness manufactories was considerably under 400, and that wages had increased barely 10 per cent, and even that small increaae waa not at all clearly proved to have taken place A subséquent witness-Mr Evans, a trunk and portmanteau maker- gave somewhat similar evidence, and added that he desired an increase of certain existing duties on portfolios, pocket books, purBea, and other fine descriptions of leatherware to at least 40 per cent The Commission on the ICth mat visited the boot factory of Mr Bedggood at Rich mond, and subsequently the tanning eBlab liabmentB of MesBra Edwards and son and J Clark and Son, in the same district At Clark B tannery, evidence of a practical cha- racter was submitted to show the immense loss inflicted on the community by the care lees branding of cattle and the recklessness displayed by slaughtermen and butchers m skinning the carcasea passing through their hands. During last week the commissioners visited Bairnsdale After inspecting the hop gardens they Bat for the purpose of elioitmg the opinion of local residents interested in the 2LCcSrding*"£o" Mr" TáeehuseTn, one of the largesttobacco planters of Gipps Land, that important industry had received a deathblow from the Berry Ministry, which had imposed a licence fee of £150 on all tobacco manufac- turera. The smaller manufacturers worked the colonial leaf, and encouraged its produc tion, but two or three Melbourne firms work- ing on a larger scale had stepped in, and their influence had induced the Government to im- pone an excise tax in the shape of a licence fee of £150, which had strangled the small manufacturers and Gipps Land plantera alike The maize growing industry formed the subject of close investigation, most of the witnesses averring that the Baimdale district if properly worked could produce moro than onough for the entire colony The rich allu- vial finta of the Mitchell, the Tambo, and other Gipps Land rivers, it waa pointed out, would produce only maize, tobacco, or hopa, the growth of wheat and other cereal cropa, owing to the extreme fertility of the soil, being too rapid and rank It waa only by growing maize that the land could eventually be reduced to the quality necessary for wheat growing AGRICULTURE No change haa taken place m the position of tillage farming during the last fortnight Slight showera have fallen, rain ia still threatening, and probably may fall ore the mail leaves the bay, but Bundar appearances have been presented at intervals during the whole courae of the drought Threatening, indeed, IB a well recognised characteristic ot Australian droughts The effects of the visitation are being palliated to a slight ox tent by the despatch of water trains to the Buffering districts, and by the success that haa attended bonnga for water, and this baa enabled some of the formera to com- mence ploughing A little sowing is also being done in various parta of the Wimmera, and in localities elsewhere that are favoured with water enough for the working stock and domestic use There IB no question but that the work of preparing lund for wheat IB greatly in arrear in the early districts Had ram fallon in due season, ploughing would have been much more forward than usual m the districts that have recently been conuectud with our railway system The aaving of carting would have allowed grain growers to begin plough- ing several weeks earlier than usual The extent of next season's wheat area will de- pend almost wholly upon the time at which the drought breaks up Barley and oats being grown in the later and cooler districts, are leaa dependent on the occurrence of early raine Tho hop crop generally is of good bright quality, and, with some few exceptions, of average yield per acre In nearly every ground water can te laid on by gravitation from a neighbouring stream or by means of pumping therefrom The area under hops in the Bairnsdale and other districts is steadily increasing, and the climate of our ranges being peculiarly favourable to the plant, hop growing bids fair to become a considerable industry.

In the matches against elevens of each of the colonies the visitors secured well earned vic- tories, the curious fact about these contests being the repeated failure of the colonial teems in the second innings of each match When pitted against the Australiana, how- ever, Shaw and his men found worthy foe men, and were twice defeated on their merits, while in the remaining matches had they been completed the honours would probably bave been equally divided On tbe perfect wicketa prepared for the 11 a side matches, splendid all round batting averages were ob tamed, Ulyett heading the hat with the creditable average of 39 3 runs for 14 innings, while Shrewsbury, with a point leas, ran him very closely for the honour In the bowling nothing remarkable was recorded, Batea and Peate coming off best, although neither of their performances aro likely to add anything to their fame as bowlers In the matches ogainBt odds, an opposite result is noticeable, the bowlers here getting their turn while the batsmen suffered In the general average for the tour, Ulyett is still at the top in bat- ting, while Shaw and Midwinter claim the premier positions in the opposite depart- ment _
