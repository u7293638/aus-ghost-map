WOODEND NORTH. (Fr.Oil OUIt CORBESPOXDENT.) Since my lust, to u?e a new term, the weather lias voriated considerably, or, for fickleness, it has run through good, had■: ahcl indifferent. First it was unplea santly warm, then it was hot enough.for •. anything. Then: it. .was sultry*.-nestC it "was! chilly, and'* so until'we were? visited by the fag end of a thunderstorm;-, which brought a smart shower, followed V by drizzly conditions and a libavy, downpour. During last week it would he safe to say that a good inch of rain* fell, and that, too, just in the nick of time to confer the greatest possible bene fit on the potato erops. The January rains, taken all through in this district, caused the grass . to shoot, wonderfully, whilst the February showers will force italorig at such a rate, that there will be every chance'of grass for the winter. . Early last week Mr. J. Barker’s hush paddock at Carlsinhe, was set- on' fire how, is not known—with the result that over 100 acres were swept over. From an inspection, my . opinion is if the' forestry had conn; to thtr -very cornri of the paddock Mr GoocKc’s.stacks would not have;escaped clcslfu'ction. Luckily, there.\va3'n wide strip of land'covered with green-grass, aud* the fire.seems to have ended at it. • - v Some one who- does, not' hold to the. maxim that “honesty is the best policy*.' at that* hour when'ghosts troop forth, lately made a snatch at Mr \Vv Sneyde’s cornsacks,- ^reducing their ta.liy by 15. There is a tendency along this section of the Mg. Alexander road to .oil-bear any articles left out of doors or * in doors in outbuildings, hut the looter or lobters are * doomed to cofite along once too'often.* -
