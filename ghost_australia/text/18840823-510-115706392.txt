It was a pretty place, and It was marked hare and there by the unmis takable traces of a woman's presence. Neat white curtains hung in the windows, a- ham mock swung on the *arandah,*nd a trailing wnegrew over the posts by the door. One night, as the «un was ollmbing down aonu the western sky.tnetarandah was oooupledby twoyonngiiawfte. AWroeg hearty younomsn was swinging In tbe hammock, while flttlbg beside him, idly moving tbe network back ward and forward, was* lithe and sraoefal «rl. She was blushing drtply, but not hang., ing her head. There was, Indeed, in her large blue eyes a look of open frankness, wbieb I do not think fc often found about the f toes of young women when they are discussing the subject which was at that moment oooupylng her attention. , 'There is something which seems almost like sacrilege about It^obsrt,' she said, wltb a touoh of remonstrance in her voice. ' I had grown to think you my brother in reality, as well as by association.^ 'But you love me, Luoy. : Ton have told me bo.' His voice was deep, and not an musical to mm ear.

But Miss Luoy was but of the com mon sort, and sheWd not heedlessly assent to the proposition advanced, .'what.' she asked, presently, ' would he think? ? . ? It was. apparent that the young man did' not require a more definite desoriptive tfrm to undtrstand who wai referred to. _ 'He would ?aaaroaly objeot, Lnoy.

' TeU me,' he said, in a little while, ' why you suppose there is any danger that he will object. Mlsa Lucy's faoe assumed a deeper sowlet. '1-I-well, nothing. It is probably my imagination.' 'Will you ask him?' Another pause. Then In a lew voice : 'Tea. I will ask him to-night, if he does not speak first. If he consents, Bobert, I will do all that you have asked/' 'Tbat'e a dear, sweet Lacy,' exclaimed Bobert, springing to hi* feet and kissing her lips. ' We shall be very happy.'

His eyes were aerener now than they were of old, adit Us Mad -had not ihat ele ment of hesitation which formerly marked it. Thomas ?Glandsra, mine' -owner and operator, with ?-.pretty home, and the bene fits of solicitous female society, was rather inclined to be an ornament to his '?ex, al though there were momenta, I must relate, when he did not oocupy a simllsr relation to the English language. ? ' Good evenin1, Luoy, he satd. kuialy, as he drew a chair, upto her side, and Seated himseli jo that tbe folds of her dreks'brnsbed against bis knees.'
