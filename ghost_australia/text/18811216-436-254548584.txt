THE SHROPSHIRE MYSTERYâ€”SUP- POSED GHOST. We learn from an English journal that great excitement has for some time past prevailed at Church Stretton and the vicinity consequent on the belief that the neighborhood is haunted by the appearance of a woman who has been missing for a long while under circumstances of great mystery. Tbe woman in question is named Sarah Duckett. It has transpired that seven years ago Sirah Duckett left Soudlv, a small village near Church Stretton, to go to Australia. She started on the voyage, aud remained away a little over eighteen months, aud then returned. She stated she lauded at Liverpool, her boxes came to Church Stretton station, and she was seen to be walking up the Hazier road. She then mysteriously disappeared, and no trace of her has been fojnd. There is an account in the bank at Church Stretton still standing in the name of the missing woman, who also is said to have had a sum of money upon her when she came back from Australia and so mysteriously disappeared. In the hope of clearing up this mystery excavations have been made at what is known as the old Copper Hole shaft at Church Stretton, it being the belief of many that the remains of the missing woman are lying at the bottom of tbe shaft. A letter, bearing the London post-mark, was received recently by one of the principal tradesmen in Church Stretton, saying, " You will iail to find the body of Sarah Duckett in the Copper Hole. Look in the'Cellar of the toll-bar; examine the part nearest the road in the lefthand corner. One who knows."
