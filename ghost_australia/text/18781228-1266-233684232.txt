NORTH V. SOUTH CRICKET MATCH. The aonual cricketing contest between Northern and Southern players was commenced 011 Thursday on the Launceston Cricket Ground. The southern representatives ai rived by Wednesday's express and yesterday's mail train, and were received by one of their opponents and convoyed to their hotel. The Northern team this year was weak as compared with past years, owing to the absence from the field of Maxwell, 'G. Arthur, G. Bailey, and W. Martin — the last-named having located himself in the South and appeared in the opposing eleven. They, therefore, relied chiefly upon James Martin and the bowling of T. Hogg. The South also had not their best team on the ground— the absence of Birch, Bayley, and Whitesides being conspicuous. Very few visitors were present dnring the day, the pleasure excursions by rai\ and river no doubt possessing greater attractions for them than the " king of games."

Sidebottom as the respective scorers. The Southern captain won the toss and elected to let his opponents go first to the wickets. C. Martin and C. Taylor took the willows, and E. H.
