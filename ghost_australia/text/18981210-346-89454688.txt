Tom Debney whistled. • "Good luck for us." l:e said. " It'll i)e eiisy .enough, now.. ...There's lots. rimiv I'ni going in for a drink." "• You fool! You mustn't show yourself." ''Why not You did ! But look 'ore, niv iiny, I've got to bo well paid for this job, as I told you the other day. I'm "an'honest trader, and this sort of work is not in my line.

"All right, it don'tmake no difference to iii'-'. And .now I'm oil'to.drink the health of .you and your blooming bit." "Fur God's sake. Tom. don't go showing that note in 'The Anchor.' They'll know which way you're bound, and guess you've more cargo than cash oil board just now. And- go steady with the drink, Tom. We'ii want all our wits about us to- night." " All right, sonny !" cried Tom. "I don't, want-'none of your-advice. And if it comes to prudence, which of us two ought to be the lecturer:'" He turned away and walked briskly cowards the inn. Oliver watched him for a moment, and then ran after him. "Tom."" he said in a whisper, "'ave you got a knife to lend me '? I might want one, and that devil took mine from me t'other night. 1 put a kind of club in my.pocket in case if might be useful, but it's gone some-• • 'ov,-." . . ; .' . i " A knife !" whispered Tom.

And to blot out the recollection he began talking rapidly/. It was a glowing picture that he painted, of a bright and happy life of love and pleasure for himself and the girl who was soon to be his wife. And when he had finished, he asked : "Do you like my plans ? "Oil!" she sighed. "I think they are beautiful." But her tone was rather that of one who sees the delights of some forbidden joy that is just about to be torn away than one who hopes to share the gladness of a new life. "You are sad," he said. "A little. -This is the last day." He thought she was referring to her mar riage, and took advantage of the darkness to talk more fully and clearly of that new state on which they were to enter, together. His heart was full of a wonderful joy. But even .as -hc-uilked.-ke-Jieard_in .his own .voicethe note of resignation that he had. caught in hers : as if he. too. were speaking of some thing-t-hftt-mieht-liave neon, but would no-or be. " . Yet, even..so, the beauty of the prospect caught him in a whirl of passion. . The woman, at ~his-si.de was the woman-he. loved, would be—his wife on_the morrow : and" the mere thought was a glow of-happiuess. They were on U:c last step of the old life, and whether the new were to be a dream of biiss or a.nightmare of terror, there was something inexpressibly sweet, sad, and sacred, in the present moment. Come what might, he loved her. and a torrent, of burning words pourcd-from his-lips. -Without fear or hesi tation he gave rein to his feelings and told her something of the passion that filled his whole being. But the words seemed to make but little, impressioiron her. Her answers were short andiistless. It seemed almost as if she-paid no attention. And-sH- thsnvHuTthey crept forward slowly through the darkness. ; The wind was howling fitfully across the bleak marshes. The roar of the tide made, as at were, a sustained, bass,, on -which.the. ever-increasing - tempest . improvised wild snatches of weird music. The darkness seemed visibly to close in on them from all sides, broken only now and then by the. still more terrible glare from the red eye of the lighthouse. ; By degrees Aitken's passion abated, to be replaced by the old feeling of nervous appre hension. He tried to shut it out, but like the darkness, it seemed to close in upon him more'impenetrably every minute. Time after time he implored Rohilla to turn, back, thinking regretfully of the light and com pany in 1 The Anchor.' But she was bent on-going forward, and where persuasion ..was useless he feared the effect of anything like force. Yet her object" see'med no longer.to bo to reaeh the spot from which the white light could be seen. She rarely ■ looked towards the lighthouse, and never spoke of it. But when they reached the angle of the intersecting banks, where Ait-ken's studio stood on the site of her old home, she stopped. ... ; '-'-I-iised to live there,"-she said-suddenly. ■ Robert started. : You'romembor that? " ' -"Yes. I remember!;• I 'Vrant to sefe2tlie place." : " Not. now ! " "Yes,-now !" ' There—was.-somethirsg - imperious in her manner that would not be denied.

What if Fear had come before Love liadiad time to uar liim completely, out: of .his old -abode.. Struggle as he might, to deceive, himself, Robert could not but- be convinced byJier words that su^"^as"tlic"casc\ One hour had dashed all his hopes. Often and often, he had pictured to himself the wondering pity of his friends when they saw him linked for life to a woman, beautiful indeed in body, but maimed in' mind, a creature like a tired child rathe r than an active helpmeet. He would have scorned that pity. The task of healing the wound, of tn-ihgiTfg~Tia(rk_t«"~a"'ne\v 'and healthier waking those faculties that merely slum bered. that would have been a labor of love. But to cope, with the active mania of a dis ordered brain. hew.could he look for happi ness with' such a. task before him ? It passed through his mind in a flash that he had hoped to pay. tdo.'cheaply for ,the for giveness of his father's crime. Inexorable Fate was dcmandingaheavicrpricethanhchad deemed possible, the price, it might well be, of his life's happiness, eyen-of .his lite itself.

"Give ; me your hand." He.knew^that sooner or later he must de fend himself agninstihe demon of murder that .lurked behind the eyes or his betrothed, but •was'far- from prepared for .what happened. There came a quick movement in -the silent •figure that watched him. The girl's hands Sashed from under her shawi. and iu one of them waa some kind of weapon. The bin fell like lightning, giving him barely rime t" escape it. But already the stones in the unceasing dampness of the atmosphere Jiad become coated:wttii.a thin,:.-green slime. "As Aitken .moved aside, his foot slipped and threw hiu, off his balance. He. tried to catch the top of the bank, but missed it. His efforts to save himself but hastened liis fall, and in a mo ment. his head struck heavily against the sharp corner of the stop. - A red lire started to life in his farani, and was suddenly extin guished. Then darkness. He lay motionless on the bank. The club .fell from "Rohilla's hand, ami dropped ni i:sr feet. silent and still. Robert must be hurt'? She fell on- her knees on the damp steps by his side, and spoke to hiin softly. He did not answer. She bent over him and kissed his "upturned face. •'Robert!" she murmured, "Robert, speak to me ! I love you, Robert. Speak, oh. speak ' I love you !" And then, endowed by terror with more than common strength, she dragged the help less form to the top of the bank, and once more fell on her knees beside it. With lu-r hands clasped under liis head she stooped again tu kiss him. Was that a stone that lay so hard near his head '! She picked it up and felt it.care fully. It was a club—the club which — : She sprang to her feet. There was some thing wet on it—and on her hands—and 011 her iir-s where they had touched his face. \\\ho had brought that club out'here, in the darkness ? Was it Robert'! No. it was— A monstrous angry eye opened 111 heaven and glared down upon her. And suddenly a; frightful conviction burst upon her mind " My God ! My God " she screamed, and dropping the club from her hands fled for ward into the night. CHAPTER XX1T The Cm Changes Hands Again. ■ Oliver Magub knew beyond a doubt "over I whose body he had fallen. For his hand, as he feli,vhtvd_gra3pcd someLhing-familiar—the clu1'! which lie had carried away from the inn for the purpose of doing that which appeared to be done already. With a. rapidity -of thought born of the nervous tension of the last few hours, he saw what had happened. Rohilia had watched him while'he put the ciub in his pocket ;Rohilla had'come quietly hehind him, vyhile lie was standmg"w.ith the rest on the .green, .and . taken it away.-j^Tlo h'illa, for what reason lie _ could'-not imagine, had.laid^ei.lunii luit with it';. She must have drawn him away on the^-pretext of- a walk -for th§tTern-;purp'ose.,' .'And' Oliver saw'j that.into-this. game, of lovfl and revenge,'which he and;Ai£ken and RohiHaall^p^a'te^otie^ playing, ther&; had.-entia'ed somernewrsot of: drcumstancesr'quiW beyond his- eonitfi'Sheu- j sion. Anyhow, whatever was the meaning of it, it seemed likely to be of service to himself. : . When his first- panic of fear and repulsion had.passed, lie began to reflect on what had : happened.. More ithan ever_he saw theneces-J sity of,being gone;from Alderswyke.at once, never to.return, i. He must certainly, be sus pected of the murder, certainly convicted if brought to trial.„ ! All the village had heard him threaten Aitken^;,;most:.of them .probably knew of; his attempt 011 his rival's life at East liam ; and all-had seen him that night with the.club in his hand. But the news couid not^be'common'"property' till an hour or two. aiterdawn, perhaps not-till-late in; the-day and 1.1 y that time he .would be safely on board i Tom '-Debney's -'ship,'* with the girl 111 his power. It would never do to put into Lowes toft, as Tom had originally intended. He t riiust i be persuaded, xo alter his course, and 1 tkke them further north, or even across to Ctotend. •' ; Meanwhile what was to be..done with the thing-thatJay.on.the, bank at his feet.?- It must be disposed of somehonv while .helwent .in search of Rolalla. And where was the girl ? She must be somewhere close by, for she would have had no time to go far ; but the tide had turned all eady, and every inch less Waterin the river made it more difficult for his plan to be carried out. . He .must hide. Aitkens body at once, and go to look for the ! girL ; Should lie throw it in the-river 1 No that would be 110 good. It would only be:high and dry on the mudbanks iivan hour, just opposite "TheAnchor,"-perhaps. The-other fide of the bank"would be better.

"You were a grand man he muttered ; "a grand man to look at !" ■ And than he laughed to think how.entirely his rage had melted away. It was '-no good being angry with dead men, and he had no time to waste in useless, revenue.. ; He dragged the body to the edge of the banic and pushed it over. The grass was slippery and steep, and he could nor repress a shudder at the horrible limp: helplessness with which the thing slid and slipped to the bottom. ;,He peerect.down,after it. So far as he could see it was-lying-just where he wanted it, between the studio 'wall and the steep bank. ; A sudden sound made him look up. in .alarm. There was 110.mistaking it.
