' These and kindred oxolamations formed ?the staple of conversation, at thp moment, »t a birthday party, as the- subjebt- ,of. so much comment moved quietly ^away down the long,- woll-lighted, well-furnished apartment. The waltzing was over ; tho rich, softly undulating waves of Strauas's music had subsided upon the shore of comparative ailence. 'Oh, Eva, he was quite taken with you ! ' aald Amy Pendleton, in her quick straightforward manner. 'He told me your hair was the colour of beaten gold.' 1 'Did he ? Well, he Bpoke of your eyes, aud compared them to heaven's own blue.' 'And he said Kate's smile was the sweetest he had eyer seen,' said Lu Baker. 'I wonder what he praised about me?' she added, with a queer little grimace. ..'?'..-, '' Your hands; my. dear. . For white ness and symmetry, they were like lilies.' ' Then we are, every one of us, charm ing in his eyes ! Oh, how delightful ! ' said Eva Warren; the brightest and wittiest of the four young girls gathered at this birthday party. 'VOan't we con. glomerate our charms some way, and make one perfect whole, worthy 6f wor ship by this knight of the fathomless eye?' . , . ?. . ?????.,.? 'IJvthewav, he has wonderful eyes, hasn't he 1' said Amy Pendloton. 'Do you know, I scaroely dare to look in ' them, for fear I shall have to take np with the old strain, slightly altered : ' 'Oh, my heart, my heart is breaking.

'and. for that very reason I 'shall be' Bingled out by this paragon,' see ' if 'Tin' not. And then, I. shall smile and smile . on him, till Louia will frown and frown on me, and gnaw away at his moustache. It will be delightful to see him jealous once ; he boasts that he never was, is, or can be jealous. But he has never ' yet \- had any occasion.' . - ?? 'You won't 'ba bo foolish, Amy; this stranger can be nothing to you.' ' 'Perhaps— I don't know. Ah! he ib coming this way.' V Strangely enough, the handsome and distinguished young man .did stop ' at Amy's Bide, and in a few moments had engaged her for the dance just' forming, Amy's heart 'fluttered. She felt flat tered to be the choice of the most dis tinguiahed-looking man in the room, and her spirits rose proportionately, for they were soon on the best of terms. , ?? xou are iona or dancing r ne saia.

'Of which I was fortunate to avail myself,' -.he answered with a bow. ?;. 'My dear, don't1 bo so co'mmunica tive,' whispered Eva, as she crossed her in one of the figures. 'Remember, your partner is a perfect stranger.' 'Don't you fear for me,' said Amy a little sharply — 'just as if I didn't know how far to go,' she added, to herself. 'Eva -would be glad to have him for a ? partner.' ? Another pause in the dance. ' '?'

Why, Harry goes to PariB to- morrow with fifty thou sand pounds worth of securities— -so 1 heard papa say. It is something con nected with the Government things.' A strange electric light seemed to shoot over the man's face as he listened to this disclosure. For a second the nerves of his mouth twitched, thon he seemed, by a violent effort, to' control himself, and atill to continue lishtlv. to the vounc and giddy girl, his partner : 'Paris? Ah,' yes; I know many people' there. 'I lived there once,' he 'went on, and then detailed some of tha oiroura atancos of his life. He was very fluent, and had the gift of making pictures ..with words. Amy still listened to him after the dance was over, bowitohed by his,. merry humour; and when he left her, leaving also tho house, all the interest in the evening's pleasure was over for her. 'Well, and so your, new flame has . deserted you,'' said Louis, who had been industriously dancing, but not ' tho less Keeping an eye on ms juxncee. , ' He has gone home,' said Amy, yawn ing slightly behind her fan. ' He said he had some important business to attend to; What a valuable partner he is ,1 And you don't know how well he talked !'

'And, Louis, -, he knows Unole Paul, and bo many of our friends.'. ,,.., ' Possible,' ; aaid Louis, drily. 'Singular, then, he should be such a stranger here.

We may never see the man again,' said Louis, good-naturedly. ' ' For my part,: I hope I shall,' was the response; '1 liked him very much. Most men listen to their partners as if ? it were a strain upon their courtesy, but he just talked as if he liked to— as if he thought I was worth the trouble.' ?' T 'And so you are— there's no'dpubt on that 'head. , Opme, ; you ' promised this dance to me.' .'' '''''- ?? ? - '*DidI? Oh. yes;' And she rose languidly, and. took her place in the set. . ,. ? Meantime, Mr. Edwin Gray had hur ried into the dressing-room, selected a hat and coat, left the house, and entered hia :own lodgings — a shabby 'genteel room on the second floor of a second rate house near .Fitzroy Square. Arrived there, he mepts, and inditing what seemed to, be a message on three or four, different' Blips of paper.

As snon as he had nlaced thn nanor in his pbcket, he went to a small black leather trunk, and took therefrom a heavy beard and moustache of a dull red colour, with a wig to 'suit to same. Then he drew on a plain blue body o'oat, on the inBide of whioh, attached to the lapel; was a brass plate with a number engraved in the centre. Adding to this hii hat, and drawing on a 'pair of linen ' gloves of a dark colour, ho, left the house and went in the' direction of the nearest telegraph Office. . ?. ... ... . - ... ..:r -l . |f; ; There _ he ga ve ' the me ssage, [ displaying carelessly the , badge on , his coat,' paid for its transmission, and , sauntered slowly ..°ut..: ? ????,,.??::??? .-.; ' ? _ ', .- 1 'That's one of the force,.

If on the previous night he had been the free and easy gallant, he was now the reserved, aristooratio traveller, bearing the fatigues and annoyances of his journey with well concealed disgust, and condescending to be looked at and wondered over, while he was apparently oblivious to everything about him, even the boys who heaped, the seat beside him with boxes, and papere, and periodicals, of which he took not the slightest notice. ? , , Arriving at Brighton, he hailed a hack.

I Lilian shook her head ; but still tho air of depression she had. so suddenly assumed, remained. The dream' was noteworthy. ..She had awakened in the. morning, trembling and' faint: and had f61t a recurring shock to her nerves every time the vision came . to her memory, l^ow, however, it had grown fainter and fainter, until the conversation at the dinner-table, when it came back as vividly as at the first. ? ? - - I It appeared to her that her father had given a great dinner party, '-to whioh -ha hid invited Borne foreign prince, at that tiuio viHuiug nie cioy. j-'ecoraiora cnangeu -the appearanoe of the house till' it re sembled an enchanted palaoe. .Every, where resounded music ; everywhere flashed light and beauty.'
