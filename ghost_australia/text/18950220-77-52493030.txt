POETRY AÑD TKIELES. LOVE'S SEASONS. The wall-flowers to thc frolic wini! Do dance their golden aigu le tn, And elf-maids steal tUe hawthorn beads To wear for fairy amul'.ts. The spring is here, the Spring in here The lovc-timc oí the year, my dear ! All heavy hang the ripple boughs, ! Weigher! down hy (mils of yellow gol'l ; The poppy cups, BO fiery bright, Mcseciua would burn t he hearts they hold, The Summer's herc, the Summer's here The kiss-time of thc year, my dear ! The birrin arc wincing for the south, The elf-maids haste them to their bowery. And dandelion balls do float Like silver ghosts of golden flowers. The Autumn's here, the Autumn's here- j Thc wife time of thc year, my dear ! Kow are the heavens tiot more grey ! Than are the eves cf her I love ; j More daintly white titan her sweet breast j The snow lies not thc earth alnwe. j The Winter's here, the Winter's herc Hut love-time lasts thc year my dear !
