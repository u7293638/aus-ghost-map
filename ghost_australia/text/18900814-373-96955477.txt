One wOd March day, the coble . left Kirk Leslie pier without me. I staid at *fcome mending a dredge-net' with my -mother. The easterly bar -was on i&e; ooast, that is to f-.iv, thick cold mists ; and a keen wind. As the son rose high so did the tempest ; tre co^Jd see nought sea ward, for the grey fo.r was oat upon the ?water, but every wave came white, over and -over the pier, from end to end. My mother went to and fro, wan, and praying to her ealf ; as indeed did inauy another Silier wife, for they had givat cause. Tie night was awful. I sat cowering beside my rnbther, who was rocking herself on a settle ?With her apron over her head; or now-ane ?then stole down to the beach, to where men stood with lanterns upon masts to show the harbour mouth to the poor, folks at sea. Three boats, with crews pale and worn, made ?the land before the day ; an hour after dawn our coble came tossing *o the '♦utside belt of -the surf — but she Was bi-ttom nowards. In a month after 11ii--, my mother and I went to her father's, a very old man, and a reverend elder of the kirk. He sent me to -school to Dominie Buchanan, a learned carle, : who by his own account behoved to be of Ihe ^xace of the great Geordie Buchanan, oi -wh^m ?they tell merry tales, which surely are idle .and false, for he was a severe, grave man, and handled the tawse unmercifully, as his royal pupil, gentle Ej^^t Jamie, aonld in his ' -time well testify. At sjliool I -was diligent, *and pleased master and friends. Afterwards, up to my sixteenth birthday. I ? -went much a fishing in the boat of Saonders ?Draugglefute, my maternal nrcie, when de . -siring to see more of my eountry than could ? be descried in our furthest voyages between Kirk Iieslie pier and the deep-sea fisheries at °the back of the Isle of May, I made Jmany coasting trips, for the space of near five years, 4n the stout brig Jean Livingstone, belonging ?TO JtiirBBiay, dunng which time I twice visited the Thames and the oity pf London; plying also once oach year with a greatcarjro of herrings to Antweip, inthe Ebw Countries. -But still I wished to see the world further 'from home, and to this intent preferred rather _=to go on board the Golden Grove of Leith as a common sailor than to be mate of the Jean Livingstone, a promotion which was offered me by John Swanson, skipper and part owner of the brig. The reason of my coming to think of the Golden Grove was, that the Jean Livingstone ?having a cargo of goods from Yarmouth to Edinburgh, lay -while they were delivered . close -by the great sV.jp, then preparing at «fche foot of Leith .Wynd for a voyage to Italy, sntHrom thence to divers ports on the Moorish aide of the Mediterranean sea. Now Italy was a land which I had long wished . -to behold as being1 once the seat of that great people the Bomans, some knowledge of the ^poetry and philosophy of whom , the 'worthy ^Dominie Buchanan had not failed to instil 'Into me, but which I ofttimes felt with pain to fo fast fading from inytaiiatL Indeed, X miut tell you that it ia to the ewrttons of that learned msnilist thiB .narratSre is «lt» gether owing, for he, -Bealng, as he was pleased to say, 'a moreoonganial soil in mj mind for the eeed» of his instructions than ;was presOTted by Una other fisher-Boys, iiii KS^atpainB to imbue xne'-with a love for the human&ies;^'which has irofc;ide^ertad 'me emt^lyxnimtlnB^y.- Jftffer mirah ponder ing '-apominy uixw^HXito, -I flierefdio fitialfrr ' «ad»Tm^iSunar1» '«ffet mjsalf ;«ft toard of ^tfilltMen'':Gxbve/wlt^.t-.did7aiia'wa« ^ujtsmtea ' witi^ut -ttoreeac.1 Mr friends ?wbuM'iiate me pause and- think of Ihe ^danger* ^ imknown 'ooaistBialid pirates and . ^oobm jbfihe^ rbtttlknewXbirotam John ' ^Co^bo, ^J^Gbuen'Ji&wvej.t;^fifr-'a ,^toat '?: anflt^experienced seamanjW* one wK» was nadilt traii^ ^with Tich4re%htt^whib aa to i reeboottts, whaa i looked ^wk «ns BBStj of . ^reiins^^ni-culve^iBsi S«i ififl«meta raig^TT|wn^o 3eck^ amdelflo 4he flrow of cara\^»B^r t^tfeiwiaea'jlafcea- ateutilte jnk^%Hi^^^iut\fBilowa' te im* ?(«*'. wtelA &eai; iifettfwe^tsouia^^Bfen* .-«? .any^v&^;eT&jra;^.W*^«.;8aU«:- ^ -;' ?;?' !lierefo^, t» make » loag sttny Shorti, we oomplelKKt our cargo, tosk 'in. proviaipna and -wktor, ieina, ii8 Has been said, on a fine May . morning, X _3» not TCTienibet the exac^- dayT ; sailed.

The breezes was not steady, bat blew i» squalls, mnVing it often necessary to handiopsaila, aadraisjuig great seething, seas aronnd us, over which the Golden Grove rode very gallantly. At n'ightijill bb the eighth 'day of our voyage, we lost sight of Ushaat and entered into the great Bay of Biscay. , The iea here runs eioeedingly;high, tumbling into the shore in great ridges of .blue water; but with a stout ship,-w»u imsnned, the natare of tte waves is notaBB dangerous as that of the short, boiUng surges uia the North.Sea. And now I come.to.tiieaceident which'so sadly deter mined jbt lot for raany a day: ? ' ? On the morning of -either . the 13th or the ' 14th May -the w?-^ther was squally and un settled, .; and -the : sea irregular and high. Abont'8 o'clock, looking -forth to windward, Isaw a great blackness in the sky, which I took to be the pcelude of a gust of no common strength. At the same moment the aaate of the watch ordered the topmen aloft to hand *jbhe topsails,* we carrying at ths moment no Idgher canvas. My station was upon the leeward fore-topsail yardarm, and as I clung byfliemanropesto ttiesreat creaking pieces of timber, grasping the. flattering canvas of the«aS^ I thought I! had never seen a finer sight than , the great zoQiag ship below, . wallowing- -and labouring . in. the white fnamingseas, which, would sometimes strike her and pour heavy masses of eleargreen water in a flood over the decks. When we were. eecurJBg&e.sful;, the motion aloft was very gr-eat, we being, violently, swung from.' side to «dein such wise as aught well make giddy -even the v grizzled -head of an old mariner. 'Meantime, the gust to windward was coming ' fast; the blackness increased, and a rushing eound, as -©f the chariot wheels - of a host, rose above the rude clamour -of tiie sea: -Then, amid- .great, showers of -/-flying brine, .. which .it. 'drove be fore- -It;- : the fierce wind etrnck the Gcolden.Gjwve i bodily over span. her :side. At the same instant I heard a hoarse voiee belpw summoning (ba men from the yards down, upon desk ; but 'as I was about to obey, the tempest grew terrible. Thew were great clouds of mist above me, through which I could see nought below1 but the white patches of waves breaking over the strong bulwarks of the ship. . Suddenly the canvas, which had not been quite secured,, was torn open, as it were; with a loud . screech by the wind, and flapped and banged so that I felt the very ? mast shake and quiver violently, while I received rude blows from the loose and flying ropes, insomuch as, being half biined by that and the pelting- of the brine, I Sliut -my eyes. and. bending- down biv head jrasped the yard firmily in my arms. I might lave remained thus three or four seconds, when [heard theloudhowlof the wind suddenly in crease toasortof eldritch scream. In a moment, the mast gave two violent jerks, and with the third I heard five er six. sounding twangs like the breaking of harp-strings, and imme iiately a crashing of wood. Then, still drag ing to the yard, I .was hurried with, almighty rush through the air, and suddenly plunged, iown into the choking brine, which rose all gurgling- over my head, and I knew at the »ame time that the Golden Grove had carried away her fore-topmast, and I was overboard in the bailing sea. .- By instinct, I suppose, I strng-gled to ulimb upon the floating wreck so as to get my head and shoulders above water. Then £. saw that I was alone in iny misery. I have said that my station was at the outer end of the yard, and I conceive that my shipmates must have gained the top, and from thence, I hoped, the deck. But as for me, I saw nought but speedy drowning for my fate. The seas rose in great foaming peaks and pyramids around me, and the wind drove drenching showers from the crests of the waves down into the hollows. All around gloomy clouds passed swiftly, torn by the squall ; but the pitchy darkness which showed where its strength lay, was. far down to leeward, and looking: thereat as I rose upon a higher sea than common, I faintly descried the ship in a crippled plight, but having manasred to put her helm up so as to scud before the storm. She was already near a league away, and leaving me fast, so that the bitterness of death rose up in my very heart. For a moment I thought I might as well die at once, and letting go ray hold of the spars, I allowed myself to sink backward into the sea. ' But God has wisely made man to love life with with a clinging love, and to grapple with death, as with a grim enemy. Therefore, as the -water closed above me, and I felt suffocating, I could not help making a struggle, which soon replaced me on my desolate seat on the floating wreck; I looted at the spars, and saw that the topmast had broken only about a foot beneath the place to winch the yard had been lowered. Nearly the whole of the foreft p and the top-gallant masts of the Golden Grove, .with the frag ments of the foretopsail, which had been rent almost into ribbon, and the yard to which they were fastened lay therefore in the sea. I clambered in from tie end of the yard, and took up my position where the mast and it crossed each other; making myself fast thereto with one of tiie numerous ends of broken rope which abounded, and for near an hoursatdismalandahnostbroken-hearted, un heedful of how the waves tossed me to and fro, or how they sometimes burst over and almost stifled me. I was somewhat roused by a feeling of warmth, and looking- abroad, saw that the clouds had broken, and that the enn was shining brightly on the sea. The wind was also abated, and the wares not combing so violently, I -was more at ease. Then I heard that terrible sound — the eound of the sea alone — which no one has listened to save he who has swam far from any vessel, or who, like myself, has clung to a driving spar. On the beach you hear the surf, where the waves burst upon rotlc or sand ; on shipboard you hear the dasiiing- of the billows on counter and prow ; and,, above them all, the sigh of the wind and the groaning of the timbers and masis. But to hear the sea alone, you must be alg&e; upon the sea. I will tellyou of tho noiae - it is as of a mat jKoMtuaWoB hiss, rising universally about you— £ha buzz of tire ferm-enJing and yeasty wares. There ore no deep, hollow rumbling*. Excep't for that hisdng, seething- sound, 'the great billows rise «ad sink in silence; and you* looi ?ver a tumbling waste of blue or green~ water, all Ja$ed sad dashed, and Tariegated with a thousand stripes, and streaks, - and veins- of whit* glancing froth, which ?mbroider to it were with lace, th» 'dark masse* of heaving end falling oceam.

' Howbeit, *a holy trangaility eame down upon me. The blue sea appeared to melt away, aad t'saw^-eut dimly— the green bounjek aad the sweet, soft swarded links of the Balwearie burn, with the brown herring nete drying «h the windy grass. The place seemed holy and still ; the sub was hot, and none were stirring, and presently I knew it was a summer Sabbath day, for ixom out the' open windows of th«' grp-' old' kirk there 'cams a low sound ef psalmody, and I heard, 'as it were, in my bruia^ the^voieea of£the congregation, as they sang— 111 JadaVa land S«a is well kEeWi, .1 Hie name in Israel's great, In Salem is his tabernacle, Iu Z5oh is His seat. After this, there came oa me sileae* and darkness, I having gradually fallen i*to a fit or trance. . . ? ' ' - '. I was roused by rude sheeka and pulls, and a confused elaraour of voiees.\ Opening my eyes with effort, I saw surging upon the broken water, close to the spars, a ship's boat witti men, one of whom — he who rowed the boat oar— had grasped the cellar ef my sea doublet, and was hauling', mo Into . the pinnace, in whieh effort* he'-sueeeefled, ere I could well make out whereabontsl was. Atthe same time several voices asked, in two different, languages, what was my name and country, and how' I came, there. New, ..of both of these tongues I had -some smattering, the one b/'inw French and the other Irf-w Dutch, of which I had heard aad picked up spmewhat in my several voyages up the river Scheldt to Antwerp. ? I therefora; trying -to muster my senses, replied trnthfully'that my same was Leonard landsay — that I was a Scotsman, a mariner of the ship Golden Grove, ef Leith, where from I had fallen overboard, the spar to which I clung having- been, as, indeed, they might perceive, blown away im tempestuous weather. At this they consulted in a low tone amongst themselves. They were all seafaring tnen, mostly very swarthy, and tanned by the sun and the wind. They wore loug' blaok hair, and silver and gold earimgs, which glanced amid their greasy curls. Only two were fair and blue-eyed — mamely, ? the men who first addressed me in flemish or Xhiteh. After remaining for a brief time beside the spars, and seeming to consult as to ?whether they were worthy to be made a~ prize of, they decided in the negative, and dipping- their oars into tke water, rowed away, the steersman narrowly watching the run of fee seas, so as to avoid being broached to and swamped.- In the meantime, I had clambered from the bottom of the boat, and looking over the bows, saw, not more than a third -of a mile from, us, a bark, -which appeared to be both small and frail to con tend with such a sea. The manner of her rig was new and strange to me, for Bhe carried two masts, both very stout and short, and above them were two great supple yards, upon which was spread a good show of canvas, each sail being of that trinagular form, called by the seamen who use them, lateen. In fine, the ship belonged to a port on the Mediterranean coast ef France, and was of the class named feluccas. It was, necessary to approach the vessel with great caution, inasmuch as she rolled and surged excessively. We therefore came slowly up, under her lee quarter, and a man, of very dark complexion, and Jthe fierye&t; eyes I ever saw, jumped up upon the gun wale, and hailed the boat in French, but talking so rapidly, that I could make nothing of it. Then, a line having been thrown on board, it was made fast to me. and without more ado, I was soused into the sea, and dragged on board the felucca, where I lay panting on the desk, wlrile the crew — very wild and fierce-looking sailors — amused them selves with my wretched appearance. Presently, however, the man who had hailed the boat, and who seemed to have great authority on board, came up to me, and putting the rest aside, said more deliberately than before, but still in French, and with a peculiar accent — ' You are not, then, a Spaniard r' I mustered my few words of -French, and answered, that — ' I was not, but a Scots man.*1 'Without more ado, he stooped over? me, and searched my pockets. They contained some small English coins, being groats and eilver pennies, and also a letter, which Captain Swanson, of the Jean Livingstone, had. written to me to Leith. The sight of these things ax-peared to satisfy his doubts, for he spoke a few words in a kinder tone to those about him, and presently leaving me, a man dressed in a tarnished livery, like a lackey, brought me a great cup of hot dis tilled waters, which I greedily swallowed, and found myself1 comforted and refreshed. Being, however, much exhausted from the length of time which I had passed in the water, I laid me down upon a heap of sails in the forecastle, and being taken but little notice of, thanked God, inwardly,' for my deliverance, and began to drop oft tp sleep. Only beforehand, like a sailor, I observed the course of the ship. The wind being westerly, and sbe being close-hauled, aad labouring heavily to windward, I deemed, and with truth, that her destination must be across the Atlantic. But whithersoever 6he went, with my then feelings, mattered little. I was saved from an early death, and grate ful for my escape, I fell into a deep and dreamless sleep. When I wakened it was dark night, and. the first watch was set. As the wind, haw ever, was now very steady, and the sea not only lower but regular, the men were mostly lying and dozing- about the deck, except he that sonned and 'he that steered. Seeing- me stirring, a saSor presently came to me with a Iflntgrn* ia his nant ' aia, to my-preit'^^ from whence! «am», rsria . &e;'*paifticulaTa ^of my disaster. Having shortly informed him;* I requested that hs would tell me what the ship' Was ' which bad rescued * me, and what -manner of treatment I might expect at the hands ef the saptain and crew. At first,1 he made as if he would put off talking of thrae ?matters, bafaa I was ifljporhmate, he asked me in turn, whetheF I had not-heard, of the great association -of men ef all nations, Intt principally Bhglishmen, Frcneh men, *uad Hollanders ' who carried on a ' con stant -warfare with the Bpaniards among the islands of Che West Indies, and along the coast of Dariea, iBemetimes even erossmg 1hat narrew m«ok «f 'land, an* descending with'fire s&d; ?word Tipon Panama and itfiet towns «f the SMft Sea.' To this I replied, that cBrtaJnty I ftadhearaof tfcew companies, hut ialyvery partially and nothing dietinctty, that tlM!y were, X ?nppese, the -adreiitDrers callsd MftmetierB or Bneoanaim, ind more anciently the 'Knjkm.of fieifcast:*1 ICy new friend saade 'Enswer moodQy, that I ghonld most probably have ample -means of TearmngiRo^'orftheseFreebooteMerelputmy foot to British ground again — 'That is,** sayrhe, 'after you liave either escaped or served your -time/' . These phrases naturally threw me into great troable, and I earnestly askecl what he signified by them. ? ' 'Why,' he replied, 'that you will be sold as an apprentice, or in other words, as a ?lave, to the French 'West India. Company, in the Isle of Tortugas, on the northern coast of HLbpanioIa, whiraer we are oound.' At these words I grew siek at heart. * ' Better,''I said, 'to haveallowed me drown in that sea than; to have rescued me only to sell me.into slavery.' ' ' ' (i^ot 80/' answered my companion, some^ thing- sternly. ?-. ' Toa are young, -and have a thousana hopes before you.
