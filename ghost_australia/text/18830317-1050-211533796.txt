What is" imported'?; what transmitted?- Is it something or riotliiiig? Is consecration or- ordination accompanied' (as in': primitive times) by miraculous/powers; by any i'ihvigoration of intellect; by increase' of knowledge; by greater purity-of heart ?" It is not1 pretended'; and if it were, facts contra- diet it, as all history testifies the' ecclesiastic who is ignorant or impure before1' ordination',- is just as iiiucbso afterwards. Do the "parties ' themselves profess to be conscious of -'receiving the gift? ' No.-' Is the conveyance made evi/; dent tofoscby- any proof . which 'certifies any5 fact whatsoever— by sense, experience; or con sciousness ? It is not affirmed. " 'In a ' word it appears, tobe a nonentity inscribed with a very formidable name— a very substantial shadow'; ' and dispute respecting it 'appears about as hopeful as that concerning'the "in delible character"; impartedin the unreiteralile sacraments of the Roinish.Ghurdh ; of whicli ' Oampbelh archly 'says :— " As to thefoii of the character; there wiis no - less : varie ty: of< ' senti- ments— some placing it in the essence of' the' soul, others in- the; understanding ;; some in' the will, and otherB more plausibly- in- "the1 imagination; /others e ven in the ' hands and ' tongue ; but, by the ! general ' voice, the : 'body was excluded. ;.So. that the whole of what they.agreed ' in amounts to thiry fthat in ; the unreitorable sacraments, as they call them, something, they know not w7ia<pis imprinted;' they.know not 7«w?,on something in the'sonh of theirecipient; theyknownot- ic/iere, -which can never be deleted." . , ; e ' - - Again, who can certify that this gift has been incorruptibly transmitted through the impurities, heresies, and ignorance of the dark ages? Is there nothing that can invali date Orders? "Yes," say some of these men, " error in fundamentals will." Others affirm it will not ; but still, with that superstitious reverence for forms which ever attends neglect of the substance, declare that they may be in validated " if the formalities of consecration have not been duly observed !" Either answer will serve the purpose. If error in essentials is sufficient to invalidate Orders, we ask — had the Romish Church so erred when you sepa rated from her ? If she had, her own Orders were invalid, and she could not transmit yours. If she had not, as you all affirm that nothing but heresy in fundamentals can justify separation, you are schismatics, and your own Orders are invalid. What are the conditions on which the validity of Orders depends, or whether any thing can annul them (1) except some infor mality in ordination itself, our Anglican friends are very reluctant to state. That they do not insist on all those conditions of ' the Romish Church which made Chillingworth say, that " of a hundred seeming Priests, it was doubtful whether there was one true one is certain ; and itis equally certain that they are discreet in adopting such a course. The Fathers, indeed, often insist upon purity of life and integrity of doctrine as riecessaryto authenticate the claims of a successor of, the ; "Apostles-;- but ' it ivonld riot be convenient,' with the ' ecclesiastical history of the '"middle 1 , ages spread otit' before us,1' to iri8i8t strongly; ' on any such'eqtnMtes'j it beirig "certain" ftlmt.' in tho'aftes ! there > has been1 'noj' lack /of' "siinoniacal; atheistical; aridprofligatp Prelates'"; : though, if simony, atheism, and profligacy' L''rinll:'hotanriul..5'.holy;pi."l/tll|f;vknbwr not- what will.1 ' Tlie' majority; therefore; seem ' to have determined thqt there ris hardly -any amount' of- doctrinal ' !pravity?i'/or/prnct;ical licentiousness which could;repel the indwelling epirit of holiness--though,' vincompfehensible dogma ! an error in ithe, form ofi/consecration - "may"! -Be'ltiso;'raThe:charices ;aro still' infinite ; that 'there have', not. beerii flaws somewhere of other in'thellong chaimof the succession— and'- thongh thoseunay bc-few, yotlas no.one knows: where the fatah breach may be, it is sufficient' to apread;;universnlvpanics through the whole Church. : iWhat 'Bishop j can: bo: sure' that" ho and his predecessors' -in.: the (.same,- line: have' always been- ;duly-; consecrated? or-. what presbyter; ithab.hej.w.ns ordained; by 'Ta Bishop: who. had a. rightvto ordain him;?!. : Who will undertake to/trace -.upahis 'spiritual; .pedigree- "unbroken to thoivery. ago of tho Apostles;: or- give usm. complete catalogue of his .'spiritual: ' ancestry ? . > . 1 , ' '"'We' can imagine .the perploxity.oof oa'. prcsbytcr-thus-cast in doubt as to whether or; not'he has ever had. the: invaluable .V gitt'Vs of Apostolical succession conferred .upon:; him: .

'It is a novelty to find himi reasoning, o.t any 'time ; uan.d 'mathematical accuracyifis ( indeed more than we looked for. But it is a per version of language, and an insult to the human understanding, to talk of mathematical evidence in such a question. Though mathe matical in form, the argument, treating it seriously and decorously, yielda but a probable conclusion. By a novel application of the theory of ratios and proportion, he endeavours to show that, on the least favorable computa tion, the chances for the true consecration of any true Bishop are as 8000 to 1. "If it be admitted," says lie, " that regular consecration was the general practice, but only insinuated that there may have been here and there an exception through neglect, say, for example, 1 in 500 — for argument's sake let us grant so much ; upon this showing, tho chances for the validity of the consecration of every one of the three officiating Bishops in a given case are, : 500 : 1.!! For tho validity of those of two out of the throe, : : 500 x 500=(sic) 25,000 : l." - For the validity of some one out of the throe, : : 500 .x 25,000=12,500,000 : 1. If, however, this be not enough, let us pursue the numerical argument one step farther, and! instead of '(taking the original chances at 1 to 500, let (us reduce them ' lower than per haps any adversary would demand ; let us place tlieni at 1 in 20. On this extravagant allowance, tho chances in favour of the validity of the ' consecration of a Bishop wlio receives; his 'commissiori from three - of the order, are only 20- x 20 x 20=8000 : l."(3): Be it so i tliis'only diminishes the probability that, " in ainy giveri casejitho suspicion of invalidity is unfouridedi;1— it-still leaves the 'proposition : untouched, !that->there; is a probability that sucli invalidity exists, - dnd no one knows ' where, .thoi/panic is not- allayed. What is (wanted; is a criterion wliich shall distinguish " tho'genuine Orders from the spurious. Alas! who knows i but he may > be- tho unhappy 8000th ? " According !to Mr. Gladstone's theory, .limited as - his view of .thefoubject'is, "no i man-: ini the -Ghiirch of England has 'a- right to -say that.' he is commissioned "to -preach the gospel," :but .-only;th'at he haB'j' parts of a certainty tliat hei is !.
