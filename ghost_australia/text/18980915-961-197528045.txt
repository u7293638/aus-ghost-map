But the value of such inf ormation ^cariridt 'be T over estimated. Ife is no; less than : that of . technical education to the artisan. In. the popularisation of such- specific knowledge anii it's application, we agree with Mr. Burtt, lies the way of salva won, for the masses. We wish the workers would rise in their thousands and welcome 'such teaching, ; and apply themselves resolutely to S^vr the .methods by which our, social system wbrks and ls held together. When they do'they .will: be. masters of the situation ; until then they will remain its slaves. The lecture pointed out, to begin with, the change of view that was taking place ihthe studying of economics, from -..the dry logic chopping dissertation much resembling the theologic writing of that time1, dealing, as y,ai!jy^ pu-.t ,itj in '. prevenient grace and super venient moonshine,' to the more vital aspect of how it, affects human life. It was then the mere general question as to the nationalwelfare as a wRole, now it is the well-being of the iGdi viduals that form the nation. Benjamin Kifld wa3f quoted, to. illustrate thislpointof departure;: ' Political Economy has made a false start in not taking into account sbciarconditioris'a'nd socfal Pr?^?m,s- Our social phenomea seems to be going be continually beyond its theories into unknown territory, fan'd we see tb& economists following as, best they can with sbnib loss of respect from onlookers, slowly and painfully adjusting the old arguments -arid conclusions 'to the new phenomena.'

Money was the factor that entered into and regulated all human relations, 'and, intricate .though they were to th«. uninitiated, the laws of its operation were an indispensable study to us if we hoped to achieve anything in the way of practical reform. , We, must, get a sound grip of the fact that even under the existing arrange; mients money can be multiplied ind'eflhftely/and with perfect, safety, so long as the credit ; upon which it is issued is sure, and represents a repro ductive security. Into such security we iv^nt \,o jtranjjforrn the unassi-ted ^po'wer of every in dividual. , Finding that gold is scarce a fraction of the 'existing ' money of tlib world, and 'that capital. through its banks equips itself with this hundredfoid power of multiplied money, . against th'e very workers who constitiite the chief, eje ment of their', security, the enlightened tnlnker is beginning to exclaim, ..|l,Why),do.1)ye not utilise our own seciirity ourselves, and, with pae^ assistauoe ,g£. mutual guarantee wnere ueces 8ary, issue on the. credit of our own productive jjow'erB th'e money that will give tnein th'eir true, liberty of atition for weal tb-creatibn, instead of allowing other interests, to use, them. to(qur detriment.' Thor'old fiogei's showed that such increase of money actnally took place where the demand really made itself .fejt.;..thati if the regular banking currency was insufficient the community would effect some papar curreriby in stead of notes. As it was, merely; the wealthy en joyed ttie advantage of turning their credit into capital at pleasure, but how the position was becoming understood there was a growing de mand for a freer paper money of a^ conveniently negotiable sort, to put small transactors on tKe same footing with larger ones. ♦ * * Legislation, 'financfaiPespeciaily, had created mulch of the prevailing distress, and could' there fore do niuch to abolish it. It had -conferred privileges on the few, which hid enabled them fo :gaih at the expense ..of the ,many, fpr.as Buskin had it, 'for every 'plus' to one there wasianedual 'minus' to some other.
