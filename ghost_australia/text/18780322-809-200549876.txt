AUSTRALIAN" ELEVEN V. TWENTV-TW0 OF JiALLARAT. | by one oy them. Ballauat, 20th March Wo left Gteolong by tho quarter to iiino train' last night, and, arriving here a littlo after ten, were welcomed by the crickoters of Bullarab in their usual hospitable style To-day, at eleven, we commenced a two days match against twenty- two of tho district, and, so far as it has gouo, the local men have far tbe best of it. Gregory won tho toss from W. H. Figgis, the captain of the twouty- two, and sent them in, the first represen tatives being Norman and G. Slierard to tho bow ling of Allan aud SpoiTortb. Slierard played neat cricket for 10, and was then splendidly caught by Gregory in tho slips off Allan. Cleverloy camo in. fifth man, and remained at tho wickets for & couplo of hours, playing a very fine innings indeed for 49, obtained without & chance. He was magnificently caught by SpoCforth, at the chains off Boyle. A. Sheraid put 18 together by capital play, and the brothers Morey got their runs in fiiot-rnte style. TL6 innings terminated at 2.4a for & total of 134 Spofforth again carries of the palm in bowling, ten wickets falling to him for 32 ruus. He bowled live wickets in six balls, a rather uncommon lent, for which ho was deservedly npplauded. Allau bowled well, but with bad hack, and Garrett aud Boylo did fairly. Our fielding was very loose except that of young Banuerman, Boyle ami Allan. After the necesenry interval the two Bauncrm&ns; opened for us, against tbe bowling of Morey and E. Figgis, aud fourteen runs were obtained by steady play when A. Bauuerman was uiven out for a cutcb at the wickets off Morey. The retiring batsmna played vigorously for his contributiou. 1 — 10 — 14. Horau became the elder brother's partner, and 20 was not long iu appearing on the hoard. When two more had been ridded C. Buuucrniun was udjudged run out, a very eloso thing. 2—10—22. AUau was next, aud surrendered to Morey 'a secoud ball 3 — 0 — 22. Spofforth succeeded, ami rapidly ran up 11, when he waa caught by W. H, Figgis off hiB brother's bowling. 4—11—41. Boyie had only arrived when Horau was well caught by Cooper at forward cover for 10, carefully made. 5 — 10 — 44 Garrett camo and weut for nothing, and Murdoch had ooly appeared on the scoue when E. Figgis clean bowled Boylo for 4. Black ham and Murdoch kept their position at tho wickets until timo was called at half-past five, the total then being 59 for Beven wickets, a rather poor look out for us. Tho weather waa beauti fully cool nnd pleaumt, but tho inhabitants did uot master well, there uot boing moro than GOO persons ou the ground during any part of tho day. , . 21st March When piny ceased yoiterday Boven of our wickets bud fallen for the small total of 59, and to-day at elevemo'clock Murdoch and Blackbam, tbo not outs, resumed, their places at tbe crease to tbe bowling of Morey and E. Figgis. Murdoch snicked tbo former to leg for 3, aad Blackbam followed it up by 2 for a beautiful piece of leg play. 3 to Murdoch for a pretty cut off Figgis, and a single to Blackbam off the next ball, with another single to tbo same batsman, anil 2 to Murdoch fora neat leghlaoce, sent 70 up. Tbrco more wero added by Blackbam, aud theu, in attempting to drive Figgis, he was caught by Blight at mid-off. 8 — 15 — 75. Blackhstn ob tained his runs by genuine cricket. Bailey suc ceeded, and finished tho over. After a couple of inuidens had: been sent down by each bowler, the Tasm&oian; hit Figgis bard to the off-for a single, and Murdoch not 2 to sntiare.le? off the next ball, which, with another 2 to the same batsiuaa, caused 80 to be hoisted. This number was increased by a single only .when Bailey succumbed to a shooter from Figgis, 9 — 1—81 being tbe register us Gregory j;iutd Murdoch. A double and two singles were credited to Murdoch, and then Gregory played Figgis on aud retired for nought 10 — 0—85. Murdoch played splendidly for bts score of 22 not out, and did not give the ghost of a chance ' E. Figgis obtained seven wickets at a cost of 52 nine, and Morey also trundled well, but without tbe sue cess of his ooarade ..The fiehluyt all tbraueB »i. very good, 'only one chance being, mulled, and 'that was a very difficult one. ,. The Ballacatians. having 40 to the good, started their second innings with plenty of . confidence, and. tho result Iras a total ©i 155 before the' last wicket ' felL C." and A. Sherrard showed first-rate cricket for their respective score of 22 and 12. W. Q. Figgis seemed to be well set when he wan beautifully CAUght by Spofforth in the long field off Boyle, and Norman displayed dogged defence for bis contribution of 32. Thcpriae ot place, howovcr, talougs.to Ceopef, whose scores of 23 (not out) « as a faultless exhibition of cricket. He was at the wickets over an hour, and wns< re ceived with cheers on returning to the pavilion Tho innings closed at a anir tor-past four p.m., and as there was only an hour loft it was.evident that tho match would end in a draw. Bailev bowled very well, getting eight wickets for 24 runs Tbe two Bannerinant went in at half-pass , four with tho determination of keeping tneir stumps up for the remainder of the day ; but only - 5 runs had been mado f when Charlie was bowled by Morey with a shooter. 1—5—5 ; and Horan joined .Alice, who was immediately afterwards dismissed by Figgis "for nought, the -first the stone waller has mado during tbe tour'of the eleven Spofforth was run out for 4, and Bl&ckbatn; was only a. few miuutes at the crease when Horan was caught by BhVht off E. Figgis for 7, in making which tho but muni gave two chances. Murdoch was seiit to tbe pavilion by Morey for-2, ana Boyle was clean .bowled by Figgis for nothing. Bailey also disappeared from the scene for the dreaded duck's egg, and Garrett, with Allan, managed to hold posses sion of ' ibe wickets until time waa called, the state of the game being eight for 25. Such a collapse of good batsmen does not often occur ; and in this instance, it can bui bc attributed to the light, which was Tery bd towards the end of the plaT, so mnch so that scarcely a ball delivered by Figgis could be seen He secured five wickets for 15 runs j and Morey, who bowled .without tho aid of trees at his back, got two for 10. J8jo fieldiug, again, was first-class, and W. H. Figgis Bhowed good j adgment in placing his men There can bo no doubt that if time permitted we should havo bad to suffer a hollow defeat, and thedocal men deservo every credit for the fine show they made with the bat, -the ball and in the field against) the cream of Australian cricket.
