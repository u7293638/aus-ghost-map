! CURRENT LITERATURE, p c S05D3 STOKES. ร Rachel," by Miss Jane H. Findlater (is thuen's Colonial Library), is bound to add to this author's growing reputation. The story is some what sombre indeed, but so large an element of HonibrcnesB enters into the lives of the happiest of j us that it is none the less human on that on account. The heroine was gay and bright enough before the big event of her life happened, and we doubt not that at all-healing " tune rolled on much of the old spirit came back to her She lived with her old uncle, a Presbyterian minister, in Scotland, and there came to the manner as his assistant one of those strange mystic souls which Scotland, sternest and most sensible of mothers, produces in such wt d Icrfni variety The two Michael Fletcher and Rachel Cuesu fall in love with each other Michael is a forgetful soul He is thinking so much of R clips on his arrival In her uncle s house that he devours a side of a toast of beef He is thinking so much of her that the fact of his engagement to another girl slips out of his mind But Rachel is sane, if he is not She loves him with all her soul She would have made an ever so much better wife to him than the coloured girl he married She ยก would have kept him from the extravagances which wrecked his soul's life whilst they kept up his waning popularity as. a sensational preacher Her influence is ill for good, but it is used in vain And that is where the sombreness of the story comes in Two lives are wrecked, and the strongest agencies light in late against an inevitable disaster Rachel herself is bright and clever The account of her life in her cousin's home after the straightest sect of her religion, ' cor tra Elizabeth " lived a thoroughly honest and conscientious Pharisee and the story of her intercourse with this couple's son are full of a sub acid humour which is delightful enough Our author has picturesque knack of expression, too Michael, who has the gipsy gift of prophecy, has foretold the sudden death of a man, who straightway fulfils that prophecy and is carried away The bystanders, though they shrank from him in superstitious dread, would not tell the police of the fortune telling, and Michael smiled at the tacit reticence of the crowd " And again " Michael tinkled the little old bull that jingled through the ill- defined house how the expression brings before the mind a rambling barn of a dwelling, in which even the ticking of a worn old bell is heard all through ' And this for a description of mourners at a funeral feast " They But there in their union ely grief, munching buttered toast and red herring, and having their faces all the while drawn down into ex precocious of such artificial wog " " Fortune's My Time," by J Bloundolle Burton (Methuen's Colonial Library) is a story of the good old days when George II was king There is a decided line drawn between the various persons and the persons who are not virtuous Of the former are Captain Sir Geoffrey 15 and, R N, and his wife, Ariadne, rind of the latter is Algernon Bufton, a penny Jess but fashionable women, who has designs on the said Ariadne he thought to marry her and Eeetiro her bundled thousand guineas, but when the ceremony was concluded he found that his bride was not Ariadne but one Auno Tremlett, who took this strange means of punish- ing Bufton for causing the ruin and death of her younger sister Button in his dancer lies traps for a variety of people and falls into one of them himself, much to the decently concealed joy of the virtuous people, who live happily over after wards Lovers of literature owe Mr William Heinemann a debt of thanks for his Popular Novel ' series, in which he publishes some of the best stories in the language This week we have from him Mr Richard Davey's translation of Edmond About's fine novel, " The King of the Mountains, ' and Hannah Lynch's "Daughters of Mon " An additional attraction to About's book is a preface by Andrew Lang, which, despite such lapses into heathen tongues as " helerochthonous," and words of that calibre, supplies a good introduction to the Greece of the days of Mr Hadji Stavros " 'The Cardinal's Page," by James Baker (Mac- millan's Colonial Libr in ) has got into its fourth edition though its first appearance dates only some six months back The Cardinal is Henry Beaufort, of Winchester, and the page is one Ralph Braufcpath Both live surprising adventures in the cockpit of Europe, and Ralph comes out of them a knight with the lordship of Helfenberg, and for wife a charming maiden whom he has saved on various occasions from death and worse The story is one of stirring adventure in stirring times, and is intended by the author to serve as a companion volume to his " The Gleaming Dawn " For some reason or another he has found it necessary to introduce at intervals such strange words as "angst" md " crust " and " hist," but for the more part his characters drop but seldom into pseudo-archaisms of this calibre " Children, Racehorses, and Ghosts is the comprehensive title which Mr Edward H Cooper has given to a collection of short stories published in book form by D Duckworth and Co A. not inconsiderable part of the book is taken up with stones in which a vivid acquaintance is shown with various sorts of French life, and the Monto Carlo episodes will be read with interest The scene of " In this world of the Next a story which had the distinction of being adversely criticised by the late Mrs. Lynn Linton is laid in Adelaide " From Seven Dials," by Edith Ostlero (also in Duckworth's Colonial Library), is another collection of short stories We have here the life of London in the East End, with the joys and sorrows, too manages and the murders, of the (festive costermongers and their friends and relations It is a strange world, and the people in it useastrungolanguagc, sandhill e eccentric ways of conveying their sentiments There is humour in it too of a sort-a humour tinged with pathos, and with drunken violence and noise Perhaps the best of these stones is that which tells of the love of a bully 'bus-driver for his gin loving mother, his " old gal," as he calls her It is entitled " 'Ayer Up i "-a mysterious expression to those not versed in the language of London By Creek and Gully" (Unwin's Colonial Library) is the title which Mr. Fisher has given to stories and sketches of Australian bush life, told in prose and rhyme, by 1 - Australian writers now resident in England These stones are of varying value and interest The best of them is undoubtedly Mr Louis Becke " The Last Cruise of John Maudsley, Reoruiter " Mr Becke is nervous and vigorous, as we all know, in his description of events in the islands, which he know a so well He is at his best horse He does not force effect Whether it is war or love or sorrow that he tells us of, he is simple and natural Some of his imitators revel in gore and all sorts of unpleasant things Mr Becke does not lie simply tells us what he saw Of other worthy things in this volume are a story by Mrs Caffyn (2 lot i "), and a sketch by Mrs Campbell Praed Short stones and poems are contributed also by Mrs Fisher, Mr and Mrs Patchett Martin, Mr E W Hor Lung, and other writers "Lally of the Brigade," by L McManus (T Fisher Unwin), is a story of the time of the W of the Spanish Succession, when all Europe was spending blood and treasure in the endeavour to i Boouro or defeat an object which history has shown to have been absolutely not worth spending sixpence over For all that it was a great quarrel when it lasted, and Mr M'Manus describes some of its most important incidents with a graphic power which carries the reader along The members of the Irish Brigade get their due share of honour and credit, and there is a pleasant love story underlying the main hurdles, L " On the Edge of the Empire," by Edgar Jop Bon
