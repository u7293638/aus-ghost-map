A QUIET RUBBER. ' From what transpired to day at the Central, it seems that Frederick Merley and John M'Morrow met in M'Sweeney's hotel to have a quiet game of euchre. The time passed pleasantly, and nothing occurred to disturb the harmonious stillness of the hour save the shuffle of pasteboard, the gurgle of refreshment and the cheery clink of the currency as it from time to time changed its quarters or dropped with a comfortable ring into the pocket of a successful player. A while later, however, the atmos phere of M'Sweeney's back parlor was rudely rent by sounds of discord and the excitement of dispute. A difference of opinion had arisen, one of the parties had imputed crooked behaviour to the other, and the latter was hurt and offended. Soon sounds of anger' increased, and M'Mcrrow, with commendablo policy, left tho room, intending to pass out from M'Sweeney's hotel into the street. His intention was, however, frustrated by Morley, who, still heaping verbal indig nities upon him, struck him full in the eye with a glass or something equally cheerful, closing his optic, and cutting deep into the fleBh below it. For the defence it was alleged that M'Morrow bad tried to borrow from a blacksmith a hunk of pig iron, with which io make a ghost of Morley, but this didn't count, and tho bench having remarked upon tho savagery of the assault fined the prisoner Â£7 2s, or in default four months' gaol.
