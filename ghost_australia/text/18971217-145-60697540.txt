THE GHIIOT PUZZrED. John Iloole, the translator of Taso and Ariosto, was subject to nearness of vision. fo had a great partiality for the drama, and, in his younger days, would frequently strut his hour upon the stago at an amateur theatre ina Lincoln's Inn Fields. Upon one of these occa. slons, whilst performing the Ghost, in " lamlet," Mr. Hluole wandered, incautiously, too far from the trap-door throughwhihohhubad emerged from the nether world, and by which it was his duty to descend. Inuthis dilemma he groped about,hoping todistlinuish the aperture, whilst the audiounce, who were ignorant whr the Ghost remained eo long in the upper regions after the crowing of thu cock expected him to favour them with a second edition of that celebrated scene. It was apparent, from the lips of the Ghost, that he was holding converse with some one behind the wings. IHe at lengtlh became irritated--alas I poor Ghost I-aod ejaculated, in tones sullIciently aundible, "I tell you I oan't lnd it." The laughter which ensued may be imagined. The (host (which, if it had been a sensible one, would haro walked off) became more and more discomposed, until its perturbed spirit was placed, by some of the bystanders, on the trap-door, after which it descended, with.nll duo solemnity, amid roars of laughter.
