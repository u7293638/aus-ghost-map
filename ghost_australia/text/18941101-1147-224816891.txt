A PROSPECTIVE BRIDEGROOM. Lord Willoughby de Eresby, M.P., whose engagement to Miss Muriel Wilson, the daughter ol Mr. Arthur Wil son, the Hull shipowner, who owns Tranby Croft, is announced, is the eldest son and heir of the Earl of Ancaster. .His family are descended from one Gilbert Heathcote, Lord Mayor of London, and one of the founders of the Bank of England. One of Heathcote's descendants was, in 1050, created L,ord Aveiana, ana married a daughter of the last Lord Willoughby de Eresby. This lady was a peeress in her own right, and on her death in 1888, her son, then Lord Aveland, now Earl of Ancaster, succeeded to the barony of Willough by de Eresby. The young lord is a fair- haired, pale- lord willoughby de eresby. faced, blue-eyed young man, who unsuccessfully con tested Boston against Sir William Ingram in 1892. Last January he was returned as Conservative M.P. for the Horncastle division, and he proved in that contest that he has ability as well as rank. In the House he has spoken once or twice very smartly, and his inquiry as to what duty the Budget would force him to pay on succeeding to a mansion whose value was enhanced by the promenades of a family ghost, was the source of a good deal of fun. He and his father are large land owners in Lincolnshire, Derby, Denbigh, and Perth, but as theirs is purely agricultural land, they are not enormously wealthy like the Hull, Wilsons.
