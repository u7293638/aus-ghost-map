Tiim tau. op vHifi wuoa »* ? . JINDOR. Of ftD fiihla stories none Is mors popular with ofafldren than the tale of the witch of Endor. On wet Sunday sfteniuoni the most admired plate in the folio Bible is that whioh . shdws Saul falling forward ou th* earth, and the witbh woman ehiinlung baofcin astoui«h mcnt and awe, and the white bearded, shadowy figure of tbe Prophet ruing up from t£a jUenoeot Sheol. The wumuu of Endor to belovad by oontroversial infancy , just launched, nnoonsolou^ly, ou the stream of Biblical critfolsm an^ pleading against the verdict of parent or nnrse for ue existence of ghosts and witches. Tha sady syllogism runs thns : I Tbe Bible is true. The Bible says thazo Ml ft witoh and a ghost. Therefore, there are ghosts and wjtohes. . Wrt often meet with worse arguments hi later life, si when Solenoe avers : -* I don't take any interest in tbe question/ with .the suppressed inference, * therefore there is nothing in it but nonsense.' Oar. instructors in our infancy, however, met oar logio with .pleas more subiW, though net wholly satisfying. Thus. 'There were witohesrbr at least there w sea witch, but m» -ha Hnaruil So nowrun away and see u yon can find .a ripe strawbery.' Thus ww the daring metaphysical sperola tion of infancy diverted into prsotiri) re searohea. Or again, this answer wonld be, 4 Saul was a bad mau, and therefore tJie devil was allowed to deceive him in the shape of 8amuel.9 * Bat it does not say anything abont the devil, and the ghost's prophecy came true.' ' Oh, no doubt that was per mitted for wise reasons. So now ran away/ ut supra.— Andrew Lang, In the Contempor ary Review* .
