MONDA r, MAltUH 13, 1882. The full of tho first Gambetta Mm istry occurred in connexion with a poll tical question which has boon much debated in Victoria, and which awaits settlement to day, namely, whether tho electoral constituencies should bo large or small whether they should return one member or many At »osant tho 1 lench Assembly is elected by small constituencies, tho law being that each arrondissement returns one deputy unless its population is ni excess of 100 000 , and of this arrangement M Gunn nÁ complains, on tho plea tint thereby go\ eminent is rondeied difficult Ho is anxious that the small cointituenoiei should be swept away, ana that large departments returning many membeis should be substituted m thetr place Instead of the electors voting for a singla man, they would nomn ate a hat I ho chango was pressed upon the former 1 lench Legislature, but though carried m the Assemblj the bill was tin own out by tho Senate, and now after a general election, which was supposed to have gone in favour of M G un i HA, the Assemblj has negatived the pro posai 1 lance, it maj be assumed, there fore willadhue to h°r ancient system of single electorates, and no friend of leaco and liberty who considers tho arguments advanced by Al GVMBLTIA will regret the national decision J.ho sum and substance of the pleas is, that if there is a dominant party in the state it is well that that party should havo an inordinate representation in order that it may govern with ease It is to secure this end that the recognition of the pimciple of election by sa ulm Jo Ink is demanded And it appears to bo conceded that the scheme would operate in this direction Indeed, this supposition is capable of proof Fiance, we will assume, contains two mil lions of voters and one voter moro If Trance were niado one constituency, then ono million voters might declare for tho Gambetta list and one million against it, and the odd man might then return either list, and so give power to one half of the nation and disfranch so the other lins is the extremo case But the larger the constituency the nearer do we a_proach this position, and the more the constituency is divided the further do wo recede horn tho danger At present, Trance is divided into some 500 electorates, and it is most improbablo that e\ery one of these constituencies hhould be f the same mind In different districts dif ferent views prevail, and consequently there is some sort of guarantee that every party will find expression given to its punciples in the national Legislature Ibis is Û3 it should be, and the reluctance fco chango a system of local repieseutation for one which would enable a small majority to dominate everywhere is easily under stood, and is much to bo commended The rulb of M G \MI I I r v may bo most desirable for 1 raneo On this point lfc is not necessarj for us here to express, or ev en to form, an opinion 1 ut th* Trench I egisl íture must be right m its view, that it is not desirable that even to convenierce 3SI G WIBI I TA, machinery should be established which would m the future be at the service of any demagogue or despot As in 1 ranee, so in ^ letona, tho pnn ciple of single seat constituencies is bo coming more and more popular No doubt at one time there was a feeling against the principle, but the logic of facts is inducing politicians of both sides to adopt the belief that the system is at once better for themselves and more just for the public As regards the community, the case is simple Classes are apt to group themselves to gether Thus North Tit/roy is occupied to a great extent by artisans, South Tit?roj by clerks, merchants, and pro fessional men , the residents hold differ ent political views, and why, it may be asked, should they be linked together to struggle for the mastery? It is the same with Kichmond I£ that constituency were divided, Rich mond proper could return a maa after its own heart on the one hand, and the Jolimont or East Melbourne division, could do the same on the other In place of strife there would be peace We havo seen recently two constitu tionalists sitting for Richmond, some day we may have two radicals, and each arrangement is bad, and involves a serious injustice to tho one side or the other SoinWestMelbourne Thereis one constituency there which would certainly îeturn a radical member There ia another constituency which would as certainly always elect a constitutionalist,, but when the two sections vote to- gether, either one side or the other is disfranchised Bad feeling is conse quently created, and party stnfeis worked up to an unnecessary degree of bitterness Above all, with the wisdom which arise» from experience, we can see now that the system of large and many seated constituencies tells against certainty in, politics When, in a large electorate» the one district almost counterbalances« the other, neither constitutnonalist nor radical can feel safe Any temporary gust of feeling may destroy the balance. And such a situation is well calculated t» develope invertebrates and trimmers. If polls were taken ni the large consti- tuencies for and against their subdivision into single electorates, we should have little doubt as to tho result Localities have their own peculiarities, and the rule is that they prefer an independent existence to an alliance with some pos- sibly uncongenial neighbour We hava proof of thiB m the shire councils, where tho tendency to subdivide into ridings Is very manifest In nearly eveiy instance the ratepayers put aside tho sa ulm de lute, and adopt tua so ulm d'au onduscmenl Tho system commends itself equally to members, whose personal interests it clearly servos lu largo constituencies it is difficult to avoid a contest A may be secure, but there is a chanco of opposing B, and con sequently A i" forcod into an electoral strugslc Moreovor, tbe politicians see themselves deprived of many sure bavons Thus Mr Bl UIIY baa won Geelong on recent occasions by a mere handful of votes And yet if Geelong vere subdivided, one of tho new electoiates would offer him possibly the sätest sent in the colony Mr TIIOMI .JON MOORI IS out of Parliament, and jet if Mandurang weio subdivided, his leturn would bo certain Theso aro tj pical cases Awaiti, members com plain of the expenses of electoral con tests and to reduco the siro of the dis trict is the sarest way of cutting down the outlay All theso considerations have told upon politicians, and ara telling and when the Victorian Legis hture is next consulted upon the sub ject, we should not be surprised to find that it is as heartily in favour of single seited electorates as is tbo Legislature of 1 raneo An important point of international law has been decided recently by tbo Supreme Court of 1 IJI The question arose-Can a Pntish subject become naturalised in Simoa, and thus place him&elf;

King ÎIAUTTOV, Great Britain had recog tnsed Samoa ab a state to which British subjects might transfer their alle yanco This point was not dis missed by tho Chief Justice without careful examination The treaty alluded to distinctly recognised the jurisdiction of tho High Commis monei s Court ovei British subjects in Samoa, and this alone might be taken as a strong indication that the appel lant could not tiansfor his allegiance llio learned judgo pointed out that the broad rules of international law which are applicable to tho established and recognised powers of tho world cannot ne applied to communities of men in the South Seas, which are not aud can not bo recognised as states In Samoa, for instance, there waa a community on the border land between an unrecognised horde and a recognised state, and it in consequence became by no means easy to dotermine whether it was a state to which a British subject might transfer "is allegiance Judged by the doctrine mich gmded Imperial ltome, it was clear that Samoa was not such a state, J>ut applymg the principle of interna «onal law as interpreted by a learned íwfci,llke PniLLni0RE.lfc waa evident Mat the new kingdom approached very nearly if not altogether to the dignity of such a community as would be univer- sally recognised as a state The sola tf0^lon3'asln3 Honour remarked, were 'Hat Samoa did not exorcise sovereignty and control over foreigners within her territory, and that another apecies of jurisdiction had been provided to de wrmuie the civil rights of British sub I ii and to PumiJh crimes committed ey them The counsel for the appel «ant referred to the case of the Sand wich Islands, where both British and American subjects had been naturah ed, but it was shown that they obtained their rights uiidei the recognised civd code of the kingdom, while m Sipioa no such provision had been made King KALAKAUA'I advisers had been more astute than those of Kin» M vi ino v, and in consequence enjoyed pnvileges which the latter did not possess lue only pioof of i aturalisa tion which Mr HUNT could produce was an oath of allegiance which he said he had taken, and to which he added the words-" And I will certainly cast " off and put away and not obey the "rulo of Her Majesty ViOTOiiv, the " Queen of England," but as the Chief Justice pointed out, there was nothing to show that the taking of this fathwasan act of the Government of Samoa, or was recogmsed by them On the contrary, it appealed to be nothing more than the personal act of the Ki\& and his so called Munster Besides, it was shown that the son and successor of MVLIIIOV I was by no means favourably dis posed tow aids the appellant, but on the contrary had, wisely or unwisely, determined to have nothing to do with him " It is quite clear," observes his Honour in conclusion, "that HUM can " not be regarded as a Samoan if there " is no law to make him one, and the " ruling chief or authority repudiates " him I cannot como to any other " conclusion, therefore, than this-that " whatever right HUNT may have under " the Naturalisation Act of 1870 to be " come a naturalised citizen of Samoa, " there is jet no corresponding law m " Samoa authorising the naturalisation " of foreigners, and as a question of " fact, that the so called personal "acceptance by Muinovl of HUM " as a Samoan has been undone "by MVLILTOV II, who will have " none of him The appeal is thereforo dismissed Our object in giving pro nnnence to the main features of this in teresting judgment is to draw the at tention of the rovers of the deep to the fact that as British subjects they cannot liDhtly escape the responsibility of their acts Ihe authority of the QUTLN S repiesentative is no doubt of a some what vague and indefinite kind, but he enjojs powers which aie veiy far leaching, and it is satisfactoiy to see that he is both able and anxious to maintain them intact Our correspondent " Fa M >c p i ' latan, whoso lettei appeued in Saturday s

MOMSVI¡\\), who rules ovei a largo tract of country to the west of the Transvaal MOMSIV v has alwajs been friendly to the BritiBh connexion, andas aroward for his fidolily was deprived of a alico of territory under the Bhamoful tioaty of peace negotiated by Mr GLADSIOÍ,ES instructions It is thought by those ac quainted with South African mattei3 that tho qmurel arose m con- nexion with this transfer Wo pointed out in the article to which wo havo referied that by means of his alliances MOMSIV v could bimg some 10,000 fighting men into the field, and that as the Boora had frequently boon unable to mako headway against nativo foes, they might probablj find then hands full Our Burrmso has turned out to be correct W o learnt by telograph on Tuday that MOMSIVA had mot the Boors with a largo force, and defeated thom on two separate occasions with heavy loss Avhilo awaiting fulloi particulars con- cerning the wholo business we would once moro draw attention to the peculiarity of tho situation into which Mr GLADSTONE'S love of poaco has dragged us The treaty gave tho Boors a right to manage their domestic aflairs, but expressly vested tho control of their external relations in HER MAJESTY as suzerain Now supposing MOMSIVA should follow up his suc- cesses and overrun the Transvaal w hat is to bo done ? If wo say to MOVTSIV A, " Tho Boors are our vassals, and you " must not ravago their country," he may fairly aBk, " Then why did you not ro "strain them from attacking mo? " Either you have neglected your obliga " tiona and ßhould compensate mo-it " matters nothing to me whether you " pay the compensation, or levy it from, " your vassals-ox you disclaim tho " dutieB of Buzorainty, and havo no right " to mterfeie when I am merely punish " ing a wanton invasion " As the Boers wore aggressors without the permission of tho paramount power, they are doubly in the wrong They have contemned British authority, and hav o assaded tribes with which thoy aro not even competent to treat If they receive no punishment for their contumacy, the wholo Bettlemont, effected at the cost of so much national disgrace, will fall to pieces It ia impos- sible to imagine anything more humih ating than the position in which Mr GLADSTONE'S poley has placod ua.

The Ministry had unquestionably a most difficult and delicate task to perform in this matter, and although we cannot fully endorse their finding in every detail, we must heartily congratulate them on the courage and judgment they have displayed in their treatment of the report as a whole. To say that they have ignored the report would be using language entirely too mild, to explain the result of their entire verdict. In no single case except one have they paid any attention to its main recommendations. Superintendents Nicolson and Hare, who were condemned 'with benefit of clergy' if we may use that expression, are semi- officially declared to be on the high road to far more responsible appointments. Super- intendent Sadleir is restored to his full rank and standing instead of being placed at the bottom of the list in his class, and Detective Ward is also treated with that merciful con- sideration to which his too good natured fault was fully entitled."
