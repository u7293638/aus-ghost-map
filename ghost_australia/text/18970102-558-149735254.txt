A. TRUE GHOST STORY. Tiie Family Secret. The London " Telegraph " of a recent date says A weird story of tho appear ance of a ghost at Brighton reaches us from Mr Thomas Lucas Smith, who writes as follows from Mansion House chambers, E.C.â€”" On Thursday I was stopping at tho house of a friend at Brighton, and, having remained up read ing for some time after the family had gone to bed, I at last, it being nearly 12, prepared to retire to rest. In going upstairs I seemed to catch a glimpse of a patch of moonlight on a wall by tho window of the second landing. As I drew noarer, to my Utter astonishment, this gradually took the shape of a woman! Tho ghostly nature of this form was apparent, for the wall was clearly visible through the figure. The shape was that of a woman about 30, tall, well - formed, .and clothed in some plain garment, which might have been a shroud. She- was gazingearnestly into the grounds through the window, a very sad expression on her face. Suddenly she gavo a deep sigh of such utter lamcut that it startled me more than oven the first sight of tho apparition. Then her form grew indistinct, and in a few seconds vanished. I examined tho wall, but found no trace of anything abnormal. In the morning I related the strange adventure to my host, who was remarkably upset at my narrative. At liis request I refrain from naming tho preoise house, as the property is for sale, and publicity might do it harm. Ho stated that there was a family secret which he could not reveal, and he con tented himself by asking me to inspect a certain picture in his possession. I was astounded to find tho ghost and this portrait to exactly tally. The lattor must have been at least 70 years old. I nwait an explanation from those scientists and conjurors who laugh at spiritualism. I know that my experience is real."
