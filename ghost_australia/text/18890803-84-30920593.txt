YEs, it was a ghost-the ghost of a dead romance, of a dream, on ;whose white face I had looked down many a year beforie, scattering over i's cold heart the flowers of a life, the longing and trust and passion of youth, to be buried with it, to bloom on earth no more. A ghost ! It followed me home through the rainy midni-rht streets, and- up the. stlirs to my dingy London lodgings. ItTlooked at me out of the rod cinders of the dying fire, wih sad eyes full of memories, until I could bear it no longer, and Id laid down my pipe, and broke the' picture up with a drea y laugh, trying to think of some thing else--to forget., V-?ain-vain I It would not let me rest. Will it, in the years that are coming, I wonder ? dhall I ever forgot ? What took me there that night-my last up in the great, glittering, dreary world's fair ? And why had I not rather gone baclk to theo gray old cathedral town I had left seven days before, and lot the sorrowful ;,past 'aat alone in its grave ? .Who koltnowR . i had finis .:; the work that brought me tu the great throb bing city. LT .' its streets I knew 'no hutnau being with 'w'om to exchange a word. IThe slow hours hung heavy on my hands; and so I wont out into" the wet, cloudy evening and drifted into the first place of mutiical entertainment 1 came across, and there I saw a ghost. It sat in a box near the stage, dressed all in white, alone-a woman with a singular and exquisite face, pale as the white fire of the diamonds that 'glittered on her breast-a :?sorrowful woman, sitting alone, .and leaning her head upon her :;hand. '.That was my ghost. My heart leaped up suddenly within me, and as I leant forward, eagerly watching her, somehow the theatre seemed to fade: away, and all its lights and I s.ounding voices. I seemed to hear the whistleof a keen antum ;iill wiud through the branches :of.:a nond. the fallen leaves .,rustling under foot, the melan choly piping of the birds, the soft sweet voice of a girl speak ing "my name. Presently the r lady with the diamonds lifted '.her `:head from her hand, and, turning round, by some chance, looked me straight in the eyes. .... O1: fair: woman! Matchless face ! White rose of the world ! The old pain thrilled fiercely in 'my veins at sight of you-the soar of the old wound throbbed :and burned. Through a mist of tears the days canoe back that wore before I had seen you ' calm, gray, contented days; bifore I maddened over the soul, Sthe passion that were in you ,but not for me. Â° And the seasons had come and gone haid brought with them doubt s'.aiid waiting and pain-hopes unfilfilled - parting - love - ,deatlh. After many days they ,brought you once again into my I iif,--far off, cold, a stranger. 8trangers always now, until we die, must we two be; then, perhaps, you will know me better, and the love I bore you .-shall bear you.for ever and I Severl.
