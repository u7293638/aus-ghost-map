BICYCLOrE GHOST PAKTIES. According, to the New York " Journal," the latest form of cycling diversion is the bicycle ghost-party. Much of the success of the party depends on the story-teller of the oreuing. He must be a young person with the ability to tell legends regarding ghosts calculated to make the blood run cold, the heart palpitate, and the hair stand straight on end. The guests and hostess wheel away to some secluded graveyard just about the time twilight is darkening into night, sud here, amid the tombs of unknown folk, the tales will be told in voices fitted to the ocasion.
