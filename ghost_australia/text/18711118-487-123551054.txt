UPPER TARCUTTA. (FROM OUR CORRESPONDENT.) NOVEMBER 14TH.â€”It is a most extraordinary coincidence that on the same log where the boy Earl was drowned at Oberne, on Saturday the 28th ult., a little girl named Eliza Jane Galvin, only two years old, likewise, on Satur- day the 4th ult, met a watery grave. An inquest on the body was held on Monday, the 6th inst., and after the evidence of Dr. Large was heard the verdict returned was "asphyxia by drowning." The child, it is said, might have been saved by the mother, who heard shrieks but who did not repair to the fatal spot, thinking it impossible that the cries could be her little one's; as she had only a few moments before left her in bed. Rumour, will have it that Mrs. Galvin thought the cries to be those of the boy Earl's ghost, and that she ran to her house in a state of alarm and found her little girl gone. She then rushed to the creek and discovered too late her mistake. A telegraph office, it is said, will shortly be opened here, at Mr. Lankshear's hotel. I am afraid that the report may eventually turn out to be too good to be true, as nothing so far has been done. The inhabitants of Lower Tarcutta entertain great hopes to have shortly a Post-office opened there, I can only say that I hope that their anticipations may be realized. The Lower Tarcutta Inn has changed hands, and mine host George Hassett seems to all appearance to be the "right man in the right place." From the improvements already noticeable I think the change will prove a benefit to the travelling public. A Lecture on Education is announced for tho 25th inst, at the Lower Tarcutta school house. A violent shock of earthquake was felt here, at 20 minutes to two on Saturday morning last, by nearly every resident of the neighbour- hood, the shock fortunately did no damage.
