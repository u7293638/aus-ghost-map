Wesley Cycle Club. [CoNTRlKCTICn] A picnic under the auspices of the Weslcyau Cycle Club was held at the Ghost Rocks on Thursday. The party, consisting of 20 ladies and gentlemen, arrived at their destination about mid day, and after partaking of lunch, a flower gathering expedition was organised, the company proceeding on their bikes. When about a mile had been covcred, the. discovery was made that a lovely crop of thorns had been collected by the tyres of each machine. Needless to say all tubes were punctured and thoughts of flowers were at once give up An ambulance was at once formed which wended its way back to the water holes on the rocks. It was found that no less than 80 punctures had been veceived between the bikes, and several of the gentlemen were kept busy repairing damages for the greater part of the afternoon. A start was made for Menzies at at 5.30 p.m., and a pleasant break in the journey took place at the lake, where Mr Jowett kindly entertained the party. During the evening a programme was gone through, contributed to by Mesdames Millington and Thornber, Miss Potter, and Messrs White, Dunstau, Millington and Edgerton. A hearty vote of thanks having been accorded " Our Host " and the singing < f " Auld Lang Syne," the home trip was continued, Menzies being reached about 9 p.ui., bringing a most enjoyable outing to a close.
