CHRISTY MINSTREL ENTERTAIN- MENT. There was a large and fashionable audience in the North Adelaide. Institute Hall on Saturday evening,'when a company of Amateur Christy Minstrels gave ah entertainment in aid of the ^Sick Fund, &c.;, of the St. Peter's Cathedral Ladies' Guild. Those who took part in the circle which opened the entertainment were Messrs. Haggard (tambourine), Reed (bones), Parker, Lewis, Creak, and Dean, and Masters Faulkner, Raven, A. Everard, and Bellhouse, while Mr. A. Boult was interlocutor. The comic songs by Messrs* Haggard and Reed, and the song (Indian pastorale) " Dinah Doe" by Master Faulkner, were all well rendered and appreciated. The first portion of the entertainment concluded with a ghost scene, which created some merriment Mr. F. Dunn was then fairly successful in the eomic song "All Fours," after which Mr. de Vere amused the audience for some time with his ventriloquial stance. The four lads mentioned above followed with the sea song " The Powder Monkey," which they gave creditably, especially considering that the eldest was about 12 years of age. The voice of young Faulkner, who promises to become a worthy successor to Master A. Everard in the solo singing, was heard above all the rest and was much admired. Mr. Reed, in the comic song " The Good Yoi'ng Man Who Died," was applauded. The laughable farce "The Troubles of a Stage Manager" brought the entertainment to a close. The characters were taken by Messrs. Reed, Ha?gard, Boult, Lewis, and Sturcke. The audience was kept in continual merriment throughout the evening. Mr. J. M. Dunn acted as accompanist in good style,
