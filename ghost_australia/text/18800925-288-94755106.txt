Sinceids conversation with his ? aunt, his heart had inclined more to mercy than to vengeance. She had shown him the story of the past in a new light — his father the betrayer rather than the betrayed— his father's violent death a ^ayasre . act of vengeance, and not a cold-blooded murder. 'Waa -it, ifldeedj. thus that, stern justice, holding heru3flflexibie scales {between the' murderer and t$e murdered, ^ would compel ftiiin .to consider ;that crime which bad anitten.

' ? my life have been disappointed I am just the* right kind' of man for the House of ppmmqns,' he told Lizzie Hardman; 'a machine capable of eo many hours' work ivery day, with n© foolish longings' for leisure or the sweet frivolities of domestic life, a man made of cast-iron, and always in working order. ' And now, just when he had become 'wholly absorbed in public work, and when the. idea. of the approaching contest at Blackfprd had put darker thoughts out of his mind, here was Jane Barnard with all the painful associations that were insepa rable from her name. She was shown into Morton's study, where he was sitting at his desk alone. He had been unable to go on with his work, in nervous expectation of her coming, and had spent a comparatively idle mcrning reading . first newspapers and then books in a desul tory way, which was the very reverse of his usual method. ? tlI did not like to refuse to see you,' he said, rising to receive her, and motioning her to a chair opposite his desk, 'yet I would gladly have avoided an interview. which can only result in pain to both of us. Please state, as briefly as you can, the facts which, you wish me to know.' 'I will not be longer than I can help, but I must tell you the story almost as it wastoldtpme; and I must tell you the kind of man from whom I heard it.' And then, deliberately and clearly, she described the surgeon's groom, his dis missal, and his departing boast about. Sir Everard. She told Morton how her curio sity had been roused by this mention of : Sir Everard'a name, she already believing him to be the murderer, and how she had met the man later and got 'from him the whole story of his suspicions. She grew more energetic as she proceeded with her statement. Her eyes .fired, her cheek glowed with suppressed passion. She ex pected to find a responsive warmth in Mor ton Blake; but to her surprise and mortifi cation she found him cold as ice. '* Bo you believe this story .?' he asked. ; ' Why should I not ? It agrees with my own suspicions. I have never forgotten what I was told by a person who was present at my father's trial. He described the counsel's cross - examination of Sir' Everard, and how he looked when those questions were asked.' ;... ., ;.....; , This story . of the lost; spur tallied curiously ;with Shafto Jebb's assertion that the man who killed Walter .Blake_was-on horseback, and had jumped the hedge after, 'the murder.. But, in spite of. this , correrj spondence between the Wo stories, Morton affected to laugh the groom's statement to SCOJB;^, ?_ : -. =;..??? ? .-'.;'?.- '.: ?? ?::-//? \- *f Who is . to believe a: Ldruakard:and a itbief against a gentleman of : Sir Everard's ipositionf If the fellptir had been airhpnest: man he would have come forward at the /inquest and -told his story/' ?..: '??-,? : 'fTheman'B chaisaeter is bad enough, but that cannot alter the fact, I believe hehas told the truth, and he is prepared to make his statement before a -magistrate :. iif— i-. — ''.Mrs.- JBarnard '?- hesitated a little,. ;feeling tbat she was *bout to weaken ;her jcase-r— ' if he is paid for his trouble.' ,.? ?. : :_ 'Yes, of course, the fell© w has trumped _ , up. this story ;in iorder tOi '*ted^ upon it. . : He knew who you were— knew that you; were* inclined to suspect Sir Everard, -and he bas invented this story to get money out ot you. 1 wonder you could be: so easily gulled.' v , : .. . :.. .-...'. *' You are mistaken, Mr. Blake. .He did. not know who I was until he had hinted at the knowledge of Sir-Everard's secret.: Itold him my name then, to convince him that I was in earnest.

Yet, after 1 what he tpld me of Sir Everard's treat ment of Mm, that seems incredible.' ' One thing is very dear,' said Mpr ton. u He has cheated you. Good morning,' He turned on his heel and left her, to: go back to Austhorpe, cruelly disappointed.. She had believed herself oh the threshold of success. And now she seemed as far away from iei end as ever, and she began to think that she must once more resign herself to the knowledge that she had failed in her mission, and go quietly home again by the ship in which she had intended to sail until last night's revelation had altered all her ideas. Chapter XXXIX.— Drifting A.pabt. ldfe at Fairview was going on in the old quiet way. Sir Everard had made but little change in his habits since his return from Algiers. The only difference was that lie lived more alone, and spent much of the time that of old he had given to his daughter in the seclusion of his' own study. Dulcie felt the change, but she offered no :protest against it. She and her father/ 'seemed to have drifted imperceptibly from, the old, happy, familiar companionships into reserve and strangeness. He no longer * spent the idle hour or so before dinner j lounging in one of Dulcie's comfortable . arm- chairs while she played to him ; and; Chopin's mournful melodies seemed sadder than ever now that Dulcie sat alone at her? piano. Of the gradual decay in Sir Everard's . health and strength there could be no ques-. tion. He had the air of a man whose days are numbered, and who knows that the number thereof is small. It might be a question of months, or even years; but that idea of an indefinite lease of life which .a man has while his limbs retain their vigor, and his heart beats sound and strong, was at an end forever. He had been tp London since his return to see the famous doctor, who last December had pronounced, .with delicate ambiguity, that oracular seti- ^ tence which the patient knew to mean his death-warrant ; and the phy&ician; had in structed him in the art of spinning an .attenuated thread to the fag end. But this .process of spinning out the thread was a weary pne, and Sir Everard's soul reyolted against it, even although he obeyed. , , , He was to live quietly, to court reposSa;' perfect tranquility of mind and body, above all other earthly blessings, since in that lay his sole chance of prolonging his life. , ' I have led a secluded life for the last twelve years,' said Sir Everard, 'with np amusements or excitements of auy kind. I have lived alpne, with iny books and my daughter.' . . r . . : The physician looked .at -him with an in credulous smile- as who would say, ** Why will my patients persist in Jying tp'me, jwhen it is. so easv for me to find them Iputp' . --:- ?' : ;' ?--?-?-? ?/. ; :'' ? ? : 'You tell me so,' Le said, gravely, 'and I cannot gainBay you ; but y oiir heart tells of violent agitations — pf ail organization ; worn out by passionate emotion and' mental ^struggle.' ; Dulcie might have drooped and died from sheer loneliness arid melancholy in those days had it not been for Lady Frances ' Grange and her brother. Frances liaying: once pat her hand to the plough was' iot' ; the kind of1 young -w-omari to let :go-Tmiil [dhe had made her furrow. Having pro mised .Sir Everard to be a friend arid a sister to Dulcie, she was resolutely 'bent upon keeping her word. She came to Fair view twp br three times a week, and she in sifittd upon Dulcie driving her ponies to Blatchmardean almost as often. Thus't1ie . two girb rarely spent the day apart, and\ this : companionship absorbed the greater 1 part of Bulcie's leisure, since her mornings . were chiefly devcted to visiting among the poor and teaching in the school. Of late she bad-given herself up to this work with, a perseverance- and self-abnegation which ? she had scarcely shpwn iti' happier days, ' tender an'd affecrionateas'sh'eliad'eyerbeen;' ' in -her care: forthe ^odr.aWthe i sufferiiig.: But iiow thai all the1 hope and gladness had gone from her own life the cares and hopes 6f Pthers were i the fchief ^occupation of her mind. ;She shrank from _aU tiioughts that turned inward. She was glad to: be bus^ about other .people'^ bi^sm^ss. Those^long ' mornings at ; hSr easel pr, piano, which' had once been so swpet-tp her, would now have been full of 'pairiy since they would' have given Ijer fiiie for ^ thought; '' '.'. - : ~ Had Bhe;^Beti ?jeft tahersett in th.e time of ; Her fiilt'greaVsprsp^ she wpuld hardly have njade.'so noble.

Why, the fact that these people love you, and are anxious for ypur visits, ought in itself tp be a sufficient reward.' u Yes,' faltered Dulcie, looking ashamed of herself, '?! am very ungrateful, and I dp love them all, poor things, and it is verv nice to know they are glad to see me.'' ' Mr. Haldimond came to Fairview as often as the many duties of his parish would allpw him, and he was pae pf the few pepple whose society Sir Everard en joyed. The curate was a scholar, a man of wide cultuie ; and scholars were rare within a ten miles radius of Austborpe, in which rural district men gave their minds chiefly tp sport and agriculture, and thought they knew all that life could teach them when they had learnt how to chopse a horse, and were acquainted with the elements of farriery. Mr. Haldimpnd was made wel come at Fairview. He dropped in when ever he liked ; and it seemed tbDuleie that Tier father was always happier and -more at his ease with her when Mrl Haldimona was present that when he and she were .alone. If the curate came in at tea time Sir Everard would join him in the morning roomj ? rwhere Mr. Haldimond unconscipusly had ^appropriated to himself Morton's particular chair. He was a desperate tea drinker, |and had almost klived upon tea and bread iand butter during his busy life it White tohapel.' '-?'??? . I : ' My dinner was always a moveable feast,' he said gaily, 'and there were days when I forgpt to dine.

[ Dulcie went home with her heart «pn eiderably lightened; and played' lawn tennis with Frances Grange, Lord Beville, and Mr. Haldimond/ with something pf hef Pld gaiety. The sunk lawn belpw the terrace at fairview was admirably adapted fpr tennis, and Frances had insisted upon two afternoons a week being set aside for the' game. She told Mr. Haldimond that if he ; chose to play he would be welcome, though he was such a tremendous swell that he made the whole contest ridiculously one sided ; and if he didn'tcboose to join them they must find soriae obliging ? nione'ntlty1 tp make a fourth -, but it happened somehow that Mr. Haldimond could always fiod time' -for a game of tennis at Fairview and a- crip of tea afterwards, spmetimes in the morn- ? ing ippm, spmetimes in a -delightful little circular tent which Frances had persuaded I)ulcie to set up between .'two great cedars on the upper lawn. - ' ^ On this particular afternoorij^henDul -ciehadbeen cheered by her meeting with Miss Blake; the curate was delighted at the new brightness of her face.
