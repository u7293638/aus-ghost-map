SALE OF SIOTH SECTION RESERVES AT HAMILTON. TO Tim EllITOR OF T1IK LEADER. Sin,— I was somewhat disappointed on boing informed that several reserves on squatters' runs in the Hamilton district were gazetted for sale. I was of opinion thai the present Government would not encourage land monopoly, for such' it is if they intend to sell by auction to the highest bidder, and leave tlio would-be selector without tho ghost of a chance. I would suggest selection in those cases as tho fairest nnd best course to maintain popularity. — Yours, &c.; LI1IEIIAL. Dunmore, OrforJ, 18th December. [The Minister of Lands has promised to with draw all sales that wore gazetted to take placo after 1st January. — Ed. L.I
