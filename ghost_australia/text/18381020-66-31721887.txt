 Original Correspondence POPERY AND PROTESTANTISM IN NEW ZEALAND. TO THE EDITOR OF THE COLONIST. Mangungu, Hokianga, New Zealand. July 23, 1838. SIR,-Allow me, through the medium of your colums, to notice a communication which appeared in The Australian of May 4, under the head of "Catholic Mission in New Zealand". head of "Catholic Mission in New Zealand." Such a tissue of ignorance, impudence, and falsehood, with a personal knowledge of the writer, would not be deemed worthy of attention. -nor is it to be supposed that, the vile asper- sions therein cast upon the character of the Rev. N. Turner, the senior Wesleyan Missionary in this land, would have any weight upon the re- ligious public of Sydney and other places, where he is known ; but, lest silence should by any be construed into an admittance of the misstatements there made, relative to the reception of the Right Rev. Dr. Pompallier in this river, I have thought it advisable, without noticing the low, uncivil, and ignorant language with which that lengthy communication in replese, to furnish the following brief and correct statement of the case:- The Roman Catholic Bishop and Prostaeferred to arrived in this river, per the Rotuma, on Wednesday, January 10. We knew of nothing more than their arrival until Saturday, the 20th, when the Christian natives connected with this station came hither, from their respective homes, to attend the services of that evening, and the ensuing Sabbath. By some enquires progressed by them to us, it was soon discovered that a part of that tribe which live on the Mangamuka River, and, therefore, had occasion to pass before Mr. Poynton's house, on their way to the mission station, had been there intercepted, entreated to go into the house, and entertained with an exhibition of various images, and a few presents of triffling trinkets. Moreover, they were informed that, they (the Roman Catholic Missionaries) had come to teach them the only true religion,- that hitherto they had been in error,- that the church, of which they were teachers, was the mother, and only true church- that the church at the Bay of Islands, meaning the church of England, sprang from them; and that the church at Mangungu, referring to the Wesleyan body. was an off-set from the Church of England. And this they very significantly illustrated by directing the attention of the natives to a large Puriri-tree, which stands on Mr. P.'s premises, do r 7lcaý,ýd see r eý ýsseae, \- ba aww w~ zed = ý-Tee of tow =rrsm~lzsSi ~e~a iE Sa e z a -F~ a~~riS:1Ck~ ~ -f~~a3 __ -8a ~2snrm --f~t~%P ui~j ~~5 r~~ci~~p eb'~?-ia~9·lc~ earf~~ ~a~- dI ti ig-PI- -P~~ ~biC~26~~ qplrrarl ~C~- ~~iE ~ ~Q 3~1~ t~enrpg ~~r~iirM13 oe Isla;l U4UlP~~d dl%~;YP;; a i ~8ea~P r il~~ ~a ~aa _ etrme 2P~r r~ -t ei dfa ~lib ;aCL~ls-~·· ~P~2L --I ~ aaa l L~~~~.~i! g laT8~ a~b EOSs bae r~~iaB 9La8 ~ rd~ssli b .

Here agam, I >mus beg leave to 0ctuadict Mr. P.s statement, and am wam edr in sayiur that i is utterly false. If as Mr_ P.aSfms, Mr. Tur er says " that he was e.awrm e thate t oor natives would be alluaed over to that eligian by the splenadour of their uclrda and restnenls," it would apper from the seued that his judgment did not Smslead him, for we are informed by Mr.P. ghat ."he Bishop wesa to Widdenacey (Wisinale),e sinated about fourte mn ales from rm rplae on he #e?,lcianga(; ('be natives on this rirer neer liste tnoTnrs wziacig).

This, if true, is not surpriing, nor need we 'won der if, as M r. P. s:ates, some " atend every Sunday," but if a more powerful motive than a love of anwemy and tshow ada?es hem to attend, r. PI, shioul, I think, beware of v ais lo 1a i ?oo soon. But I am f?r from being sure that any iIo "a nend every Sunday."

Let tyour conscience answer. BEt " the (Roman) Catholics during this de- c bate (I (nmust here again ask Mr. P.'s definition of StLhe term as I know of no debate) behaved with £ good conduct and prudence," so says .Ir. P.,r and what are we e to understanrd by their "" good conduct and prudence ?" Why that " they came every Sunday with their families to m.ass." No t.ini more iz riven, and surely nothing more is 1 ir.:ended, as instances of their " Good conduct an:d prudence during this debate," for certainly the character of " good conduct and prudence" cannot be given to slander,falsehood, and aabuse, it cannot be awarded to that man who told his native servant that be would seek an opportunity to take anway Mr. Turaes life, because he had said thtir church was an idolatrons one; nor I think can Mr. P. very justly lay claim to such a character when, in a fit of intoxication and re hement rage. he told a respectable European flat, "be would see Mangunu~ , the Wesleyan Mission i Station, in flames." If, under the instructions and influence of his religious teachers, Mr. P.! becoes entitled to a character for " good con doct and prudence," it shall not be withheld from him; but that cannot possibly be while he is capable of such an infamous production, so low and vileas that which has called forth these remarks. As for the " free exercise of their religion "the Wesleyan missionaries have no objections to allow the Paldsts in this " free and independent country," any more than in Great Britain and Ireland." But Mr. Poynton, and the Right Rev. Bihop also, (while he e would be far from entertaining any thing but feelings of due respect for him as an individual) may be assured that, the Wesleyan Missionaries will, not indeed by the wse of "carnal weapons," but- by every means which reason and rerelation will supply, endeavour, to the best of their ability, to oppose the prevalence of a system of religion so tali Scr i , and, in its radical spirit, so subcmiie of alf lierty and right of person, property, or amciauz, as that which they wish to establish, in a land ia which in the course of Divine Provi dence, they are appointed to direct the poor degraded Latives to the " Lab of God that taketh away the sin of the world," to inform them that " there is only one name given under heaven whereby men can be saved,"-tat " other foundation can no man lay,"and that there is one God, and one mediator between God and man, the man Chrirt Jesus." In discharging this great duty, they are satisfied that they act under the commission, not of the Pope, but of him who is the sonl head of his crzch, even him who hath said," Go, and teach all nations, baptising in the name of the Father, of the Son, and of the Hol1 Ghost;"and hath alsodeclared " Lo, I am with you alway areen the end of the world." That he may" soon establish his kingdom hidch cannot 1 be moved" throughout the length and breadth of this land, is the sincere praier of the writer. JAMES BULLER.
