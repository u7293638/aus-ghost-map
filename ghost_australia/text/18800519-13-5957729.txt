PARLIAMENT. LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY. TUESDAY, MAY 18. The SPEAKER took the chair at half-past 1 I O'clock PETITION Mr ANDREWS presented petition from the committee of the United Temperance Societies of Geelong praying that the provisions of the Licensing Act against Sunday traffic in liquors might be enforced, instead of publicans being allowed to continually evade them STOCK YARDS AT EUROA In reply to Mr StaTE, Mr GILLIES said that no additional cattle and sheep yards could be erected at railway stations until money had been provided by Parliament There were no funds at Euroa but accommodation had been provided at Longwood, which was the place selected by the Railway department at the request of the district WANGAR PTE A W YTrR SUPPLY Mr SHARPE asked the Commissioner of Railways whether the Kailvv u department would supply water to the borough council of Wangaratta at 7d per thousand fcillonB this being the rate charged by the department to the borough council of Echuca Mr GILLIES said that in 1871 the borough council asked the Railway department to incur additional expenditure in order to supply Wangaratta and the department agreed to do so on receipt of £1 500 from the council The water rate agreed on was 18 per 1,000 gc lions, but in 1870 it was reduced to 10d Since the reduction had been made the department had lost by the transaction The quantity of water annually used by the borough was 4 458 SOO gallons, and by the Railway department 1 878 000 gallons It cost £177 to provide the total annual supply, but only £185 was received from the borough The department had to bear the major portion of the outlay, though it used only one third of the water. It was true that the borough of Echuca only paid 7d per 1,000 callous, but at that place, where the consumption was large, the payment covered the cost Until June last the Railway department had had to pay the Water Supply department Is per 1,000 gallons for the water used at Melbourne and Williamstown, and it was only since then that the rate had been lowered to 6d TARRAWINGEE SLUDGE CHANNEL Mr BOLTON asked the Commissioner of Public Works if he would fulfil a promise of his predecessor in office by placing a sum of money on the estimates for the farther care ing out of the work known as the Yarra wages sludge channel Mr BEN I said that there was no record of any promise to contribute a further sum towards this work The sum of £3,000 had already been granted by Government, and in January last the late Minister of Public Works, in reply to a deputation promised to consult his colleagues as to the desirability of placing an additional £1000 on the Estimate a, in order that the sludge might be tapped He (Mr Bent) had made certain proposals to the shire council and when he received a written reply he would be prepared to deal with the matter CENSUS OF 1861 In reply to Mr HABFFU, Mr RAMSAY said that the decennial census to be taken next year would cost £20 000 He had communicated with the Governments of the neighbouring colonies with the view of their all selecting the same day, and he had arranged for ascertaining by telegraph from England what day would be chosen by the Imperial Government for taking the census in the US ted Kingdom Arrange meats would be made for holding an intercolonial statistical' conference, 60 as to secure uniformity in the statistics SEBASTOPOL PLATEAU. In reply to Major Nunn Mr R CLARK said that he would consult his colleagues at the earliest opportunity on the question of draining the Sebastopol plateau REDISTRIBUTION OF SEATS In reply to Mr BOLTON, Mr RAMSAY said that there were many obvious anomalies in the present arrange- rent of the electorates, Moira and the Wimmera being glaring cases of inadequate representation It was only usual, however, to deal with matters of that kind in the session i receding the dissolution of Parliament, and in the final session of this Parliament an Electoral Bill would be brought in FOREST MANAGEMENT. In reply to Mr BOSISTO, Mr BULL said that the state of public business would not allow of a Forest Bill being introduced this session The whole state of forest management was extremely unsatisfactory, and a Royal commission would be appointed to deal with the subject without delay DOOKIE RESERVOIR In reply to Mr Boi/rov, Mr DUFFY said that the local land board meeting on the 27th Inst had been requested to inquire into and report as to the best way of enabling selectors to obtain water from Dookie reservoir in dry seasons REVISION OF THE TARHT Mr TUCKER asked the Premier who ther it was the intention of the Government to revise the tariff this session He said that he had not the slightest wish to embarrass the Government, paid he had only put the question on the paper because be found no allusion to the tariff in the Governor's speech Last session protective and other duties were imposed and some of these duties he did not believe in because they affected articles which could not he manufactured here and were used as part of the raw material of local manufactures Whilst he did not desire the Government to interfere with protective duties, he hoped they would not object to removing other duties on goods which both protectionists and freetraders were a reed should be allowed to come in free (Hear, hear.) Mr. SERVICE said that the hon. member had put the question in his usual direct and frank manner but it was contrary to the practice of the imperial Parliament, and also to the practice of this Parliament to question the Government as to their intentions regarding taxation It would be highly moon vealers to answer the question at this period of the session In accordance with the usual practice the full intentions of the Government would be disclosed in the Budget Speech (Hear, hear ) PAPERS Mr BENT presented estimates of expenditure on public works under the Loan Act No 208 Mr R Clark presented the reports of mining registrars for the quarter ending, March 1835 THE ADDRESS The debate on the address in reply to the Governor a speech was resumed Mr Mr RAMS was notanrpmed to find that members supporting the Government deprecated what they were pleased to call the rowdjiBni and larrikinism of the late Paris ment Hies desired that the crowd of the late Parliament should not be repeated 1 and for no obvious reason the present Government were enjoying the fruits of it, they owed their seats on the Treasury bench to political rowdyism If that portion of the press which passed strictures on what they c Med the Parliament tary rowdyism of the Opposition were in earnest, why did they support the present Government who gave premiums for Parliamentary rowdyism vi that spot e loudest - actions or words With white race could hon. members opposite lecture the House on the conduct of hon. members when the C o vernment they supported had promoted the arch offender of the last Parliament to a seat in the Ministry Not only had they promoted that arch offender, but if current rumour were true they offered another (gentleman who worked hand in hand with him a position worth £1000 a year if he would on 'j keep quiet during the present Parliament Again it had been likewise found that it it had rewarded another hon. member who made himself conspicuous in the same direction last session by giving his son the position of secretary to a fat commission (Opposition cheers ) What then could the country think of gentlemen who deprecated political larrikinism when they were guilty of such conduct' the Government had made use of the rowdy party in the House and in the country and now they were leaping the fruits of their labours "so far as he (Mr Mirams) was individually concerned he could promise that he would not treatt re&o; ernment found political Fankhauser andhe mightalsosay that if there was any rowdyism in this Parliament it would come from the Government side The hon. member for Belfast had found fault with the manner in which the Government had treated him and his party As an onlooker, he Mr Mirams) saw what went on at the late elections There were conferences be tween hon. members opposite and the Corner members If these conferences had any significance at all, they related to the question of the Education Act, to an alteration of which the hon. member for Belfast was pledged Whatever might have been and, that hon. gentleman and his party were made to believe that they might expect some of the concessions they desired from the party they assisted Now, however when the Government had secured their seats they had turned round and thrown the lion her train and his party over The Government might be accurately described in the words of Duraeh -' They are gentlemen who I j UBU " one party and bamboozled" the other has come to the possession of place, power and it, and then they turned round and son - Let us have no party questions, gentlemen but fixity of tenure it with re gard to the delay which took place in cabin E Parliament together hon members opposite seemed to admit the whole charge for the best reply they could make was it hit harm his it done They could not meet the charge on its merits and rebut it unions their own rep' however he might say that there was a treat deal of harm done On the first day of meeting Ministers found them Belt as no awkward position, and one union blitutio'inl practice led to another Another point too had been raised by the hon member for Mandurang (Mr Fisher), that the delay had enabled the Government to repel, without the sanction of Parliament regulations made by a Minister, had approved of by last Parliament Air DUrrY-Thej were not approved of Mr MIRAMS -If a ref wal to disapprove amounted to an approval, then they were up proved of by the last Parliament No one had yet answered the point raised by the hon member for Mandurang although it was one of an important character the delay in calling Parliament together had, then, been full of practical harm Why did the Government not follow the precedent established when Mr Gladstone resigned in 1874 ? They were told that on that occasion the Parliament only met JJ) of for mi, but the truth was that it met day after day, that the longest adjournment was a week, and that there was no prorogation The point in dispute had been well put by Govenor Head, of Canada in ISoS, who, on the occasion of a Ministry being outvoted, and on being asked by the new Government to prorogue Parliament, Bald Until the now Ministers meet Parliament His Exc cellency 1 as no assurance that they possess the con Meneo of the majority of the House ' And further on - ? If Parliament merely adjourned until after the re-election of the member of the Government the case is different, and the responsibility is on the House itself A prorogation Is the act of His Excellency, and in this particular case such act would bones for seed without the advice of Ministers who had already received the confidence of Parliament According to that dictum the present Go- eminent of Victoria had acted licensed nationally, for they had prorogued Parliament without having first obtained the confidence of a majority of the ROUse The address presented to Parliament must have been as disappointing to the supporters of the Government as to the Opposition One journal The Australisian which supported the present Government, cut out their work for them a few weeks after their advent to office, by stating that they were elected " to re-establish equilibrium of the finances to readjust taxation, with a view to its more equitable incidence, to restore credit to revive confidence, to reassure capital, and to remove obstacles from the pith of industry Now, what information did they get in the address with regard to those Bil blinds ' None A\ hat were the Government doing to reestablish, equilibrium of our finances' There had been an increase in the price of wool, the ted States had reduced their import duty on our wool, and there was the frozen meat movement All these things would tend to re-establish equilibrium in our finances but the Government could take credit for none of them What then, did He Auih allusion mein' Then they were told that the present Government would restore credit It was just possible that some of the gentlemen who had taken office might have had their credit restored by so doing but if the national credit were meant, then he would say that he was not aware it required restoring On the other hand, the newspaper from which he had quoted and its daily satellites he At gus had been doing their level best for years past to damn the credit of this colony The next thing the Government were to do was to re live confidence, but neither on this point did the speech give any information the hon member who moved the address in reply said that confidence had been restored amongst the civil servants He (Mr Mirams) however, believed that the civil servants never felt less confidence than they did at present They were cate enough to see that hon. member opposite were not likely to occupy then present positions very long and to know that the example they had set since taking office would be expected by their successors If the hon gentlemen opposite had believed all they soul about Black Wednesday they ought to have late I remain nammous part, but they had done exactly the same thing, and that, too, in a worse way, as they condemned the late Government for Mr RAMSAY-What about Mr Trench' Mr Mill A MS did not exactly see the point By acting as they had done towards persons appointed or displaced by the late Government the present Government had done the best they could to perpetuate the system they had so much deprecated and instead of restoring they had altogether destroyed confidence in the civil service An Her. MEMBUI - Give us one instance Mr MIRAMS-Mr TarreU, the Parlw memory homan, was displaced for political reasons, because they thought he was appointed to r nice way for the hon member for Castlemaine (Mr Pearson) Dr MADDEN Does anybody doubt that? Do you a Mr MIRAMS said there was no one but must doubt it after the statement of the hon. member for Castlemaine (Mr Pearson) the other night TiiipUy, 27¡e Australasian said the Government were to remove obstacles from the path of industry in the Governor s ap each there was no promise of a legislative act in that direction but there had been two samples of administrative acts of the Government in dealing with the industrial classes both of which tended in quite a contrary direction In the first place the Long more regulations had been repealed so as to facilitate the operations of capitalists in getting the selectors off the lands, and in in creasing their large estates Mr DUFf Y -You know that is not true Mr MIRAMS the hon. member could not deny the statement made on this subject the other 1 10th by the hon. member for Kara Kara Mr DU1 TY -The hon. member for Kara Kara is in favour of the repeal of those regulations (Hear, hear.) Mr. MIRAMS said he was contending that their repeal would facilitate the passing of the selectors lands into the hands of the large landed proprietors Mr DUFFY -Quite the contrary Mr MIRAMS Then another thing the Government had done was to annul the sale to manufacturers of land on the banks of the Yarra sales that had been sanctioned by the late Government Mr RAMSAY Reid what the Age said on the subject Mr MIRAMS If he lived on the Age he would not be SO fit is the hon member (Ioughfn ) These then were illustrations of ho v the Government removed obstacles from the pith of industry The 015 paragraph in the speech of importance was that which related to the question of reform Now, he would ask if the Ministry were sincere when they said that the peace and prosperity of the colony depended upon the settlement of that question, why did they not throw up their offices at once' they must know that they had not the ghost of a chance of carrying their reform scheme and that every day they continued 111 office they occupied time of necessary and took the county a money under false pretences They pretended to hold office for the purpose of carting reform, and they knew they could not do it An Hoy MEVIJEB-They went carry their bill to the Bay of Biscay and drop it there, at any rate (Hear, hear.) Mr. MIRAMS there were three members of the Government pledged to oppose the scheme propounded by the Premier, and three or four gentlemen sitting behind them were similarly pledged AMy, then did the Government continue 111 office, wasting the time of the country in a sham endeavour to carry a reform bill' Mr ¿0\ - Did the hat Government carry theirs' Mr MIRAMS -That s not the question Mr ZO\ -We are going to try Mr MIRAMS said it was quite possible that some hon. members on that side might turn themselves inside out, politically speaking There was the hon. member for Sand niece, who in 1871 was returned to Parlia- meet with the assistance of Mr Francis in the belief that he was in favour of the Norwegian scheme Dr MADDEN - That is not true Mr MIRAMS-Mr Francis believed it The hon. member for Sandridge said in 1871 that he intended to vote for the second read- mg of the bill, and that he was willing to make sacrifices to keep the then Government 111 power What had happened to cause the hon member to take a different course from that taken by him in 1871' Dr MADDEN The difference is that I have seen the ball and you have not, Mr MIRAMS- The hon member then said that he was in favour of depriving the Legislative Council of having a voice in the passage of money bills, but now he proposed to give them a greater voice Dr MADDEN How do you know ' If you have a hale patience, we will tell you all about it this day week Mr MIRAAIS-The hon member for Dalhousie voted against the second reading of the bill in 1874 but he did not take part in the debate was he imitating the practice in the Council who according to the statement of an hon member of that chamber did not speak much 1st were devils to think Mr DLI T Y - ion never do that as all Mr MIRAMS the hon member for Kyneton Boroughs also voted against the bill and the hon member for v Villiers and lUjt s bury not only vited against it but made a most a powerful si eech ag, mist it describing it as resuscitating a stage in history which the colony had long passed Mr Wrixon had also Spot on against it basing his objection on the fact that such an arrangement would be destructive of the Lower House except when their majority was overwhelming was not the argument stronger now that it was proposed to increase the number of members of the Upper House from 40 to 42 ' On the first division that took place it was seen that barely a statutable majority voted with the Gover i mont What was the use of wasting time (ironical cheers) in attempting to carry a reform scheme when there was no hope of success? Mr TUCKER said the Governors speech would be read with feelings of disappoint- ment, because it appeared that Parliament was going to repeat the mistake of making the question of reform a mere seeking horse to enable the Government to hold office and draw the pay paid exercise the power belonging to it The House was now called upon to settle a very grave question He had voted for every reform bill before the House, and he felt inclined to approach this question without any party of elongated, know was how the whole prosperity of the colony depended upon a speedy settlement of the question be arrived at (Hear, hear.) At present, the details of the Government scheme were not before the House, but there was a widespread impression that the Government scheme was an indirect attack upon the manhood suffrage of the colony Hon members had already been threatened in the leading press of the colony with a dissolution He was ready for a dissolution to morrow (cheers and counter cheers) but he did not think it right that statements should be made in the press that hon members would not make on the floor of the House there was not the slightest allusion in the speech to revision of the tariff or extension of the land tax, and it behoved the electors of the colony to look upon the whole proceedings of Parliament with the aim at suspicion He should like to know whether the Government had not taken office under something like Hso pretences The hon. member for Belf t Lad stated that 20 gentlemen owed their seats to him Sir JOHN O SHANASSY-I did not say 80 Mr TUCKER- I understood the hon member to say he was instrumental in some way Sir JOHN 0 SHANASSY That is very different Mr TUCKER thought the hon member had understated the case, and he should like to see a division taken, which would show which hon members had given private undertakings Having got into office, the present Government said, "Now let us have peace, but they were not likely to have any thing of the Umd It would be right that the House should do nothing until the question of reform was settled (Mr M iMYiif 'near, hear that even the Standing Orders should be suspended The in creasing prosperity of the colony which had been referred to, he attributed to to the increased yield of wheat and other produce He should like to know who paid for a paper called the Jtefin met, which was circulated throughout the colonies at tho time of the election It read like a reprint of the Argus, but who ever heard of The Argus doing anything for nothing' The paper to which he referred was full of false representations, suppressions of fact, and suggestions of falsehood to such an extent that more could not be contained in the print A little coterie also sat in Collins street called the National Registration Society forthepurpoie of placing dummy voters on the register He would cautiously examine the Government proposals when the bill was introduced They appeared to be seeking to bring into the House men who did not represent the people of the colony, and allow them to have a voice in measures which the entire body of the people would have to provide for He trusted, however, that the Government would surprise everybody by producing a b is that we could be acceptable to the Opposition, but if they did so, there would be a great exodus from behind them Mr WALKER said the hon member who had just sat down referred to a paper published during the recent election, which he called the Jicfoi mer He (Mr Walker) had never heard of that paper but he had heard of paper called the Elector's Guide, and he had understood that Mr Mirams had something to do with the editing of that paper That newspaper was sent to his private residence, and he studied with particular care the careers of several gentlemen desc led in it He paid particular attention to that of the hon. member for Geelong (Mr Berry), and he found that everything likely to see! in the hon members favour was carefully noted down, but the parts which were likely to tell against him were carefully omitted For instance, it said, in effect "We will now pass on to 18-," Ä.C, the interval in cluding some three years during which Mr Berry left the Duffy Government, and spoke and voted against the Education Act that Guide was a disgrace to whoever put it forth, and calculated to mislead the electors The hon. member (Mr Tucker) had also made a charge against several hon. members on the Government side that they had been returned at the instance of the hon member for Belfast and the party he was supposed to be identified with Who were those members Could the hon. member name them A W as he (Mr V a'ker) one He could have got that support if he had been inclined to do so and should have been glad to have it if he could have obtained it with out any infringement of principles but finding that he could not be had to do without it and he was returned 1 without it When hon. members talked about 20 or 30 members on the Government side of the House being so returned, they should say whether there were no members of their party returned in that was He could name half a dozen such Was not the hon. member for Maldon oppoSed most bitterly by the party referred to As a matter of fact that party had never gone for any particular Government but for a particular object and they knew they had not the slightest chance of getting what they desired from the present 1 render the hon member for Collingwood (Mr Mirams) most pathetically appealed to the Government to clear out as quickly as possible and let his party in, and no wonder for the House promised that he should be rewarded in the event of his party coming back in a majority His intense as well to see his party in power was therefore not to be wondered at He should take care in future however that his reward was given to him while his party was in power and not promised when they were out The hon. member also referred to the number of members of the Government who had voted against the Nor weyan Scheme and claimed their votes against the Government but to be consistent he must remember that there were a number of members on the Opposition side who had voted for the Norwegian scheme Pud who by similar reasoning can be to vote for the Government They included Mr Lalor Mr James Mr A T Clark nr Tucker Mr 1 Richardson and others in fairness if all the members on the Government side who in 1871 voted against Mr 1 rain we e to vote against the Government now surely all those who voted for Mr Francis bill then should vote for the Government now The hon. member also started a charge against the Government in reference to the appointment of a son of the hon. member for Sandhurst to some slight position in connexion with the Judicature Commission If that was the only reply he could make to the long list of improper appointments made by the late Government, he had very little charge the Ministry with He (Mr. A. all er) knew that the hon. gentleman a son was a gentleman of great attain ments, and eminently suited for the position he had been called upon to occupy the charge against the late Government was that they had appointed men to positions which they were notoriously unfit to occupy A\ as the appointment of the librarian a proper one' The hon and learned member for Castlemaine said the other night in the House, that he was very much surprised when he heard that the appointment had been conferred upon Mr Parnell With regard to the charge of larrikinism made against the Ministerial party by the hon. member for Collingwood, he (Mr Walker) was not in the House last session, but from the reports of the proceedings in the news papers, he thought there were some very rowdy proceedings on the part of the gentlemen opposite It was one of their supporters who was the first person who ever at tempted physical violence in the house, and yet they made the charge of political larrikinism mainBi their opponents That charge could be made with very much greater force from the Mlmetenal side A great deal had also been made of the Roman Catholic vote and of other questions in connexion with the recent defeat of the late Ministry, but did not the hon member for Geelong (Mr Berry) obta n office under very similar circumstances Mr BLRRY-No Mr W ALIvl R said it was notorious that the hon. member for Geekm; in the election of 1877 received a of support of the Roman Catholic party ( No no from the Opposi- tion benches ) It had been a asserted over ml over am that the support was obtained by a promise to amend the 1 due tion Vet Mr M IM IRE- "i es, but they sold them Mr WALKER continue" eaidhebehevl at the last election the Roman Catholics voted altogether irrespective of party The hon. member for Collingwood had also charged the Government with having delayed the bringing forward of the reform question for three months but novice as he (Mr Walker) was in parliamentary matters he knew that had the Government met Parliament on the day appointed by the late Ministry they would have had to ask for an adjournment for the period which they had had in recess The argument that three months had been wasted was therefore, nonsense and absurd What has been objected to was the way in which the Ministers took office and were sworn in He (Mr Walker) could easily understand the chagrin and displeasure of the hon. member at seeing the Ministry occupy their present seats, and it would undoubtedly be more pleasant for him to be in one of those seats out at the same time he hoped that the hon member would long continue in his present place (Hear, hear.) The hon. member in referring to the reform question, had endeavoured to obtain a slight advantage over his friends by taking a pre hmmary canter over a question which would shortly occupy the attention of Pur liament This question was undoubtedly a difficult one to deal with as a party question, but no previous Government had been in such a position for dealing with it as the present one. They had indications of public opinion with respect to it such as no other Parliament had ever possessed They had, for instance, the unmistakable decision of the country that they would be governed by two Houses of Parliament. Nothing during the last election came out more plainly than that (Hear, hear ) Another principle which the country declared most emphatically for was that the state revenues should not be at the disposal of one House those twopenny ciples the country had decided upon and they cleared the way to a considerable extent for the settlement of the whole question The hon member for Geelong and some others, while admitting that the Opposition scheme was defeated seemed disposed to assert that the scheme of the hon. member for Maldon was not approved of As a candidate at the last election, he (Mr XX alker) had to discuss the merits of these rival schemes and in his opinion the scheme of the hon. member for Maldon was very much more den" safely before the country than that of the hon member for Geelong, and for this reason that the latter was continually altering his scheme A Though Kia (Mr W Walker a) contest was a very short one he had to discuss the nomine clause at one of his meetings but afterwards he had to omit that portion altogether, because the hon member had dropped it A (ter leal inn out the nominee clause the hon. member addressed his constituents at Geelong, and on this occasion he was so vague and indistinct upon the application of the play scene that the reporters had after wards to wait upon him in private to learn how the scheme had to be applied On the other hand, the scheme of the hon. member for Maldon was definitely before the country the whole time that scheme was proposed two sessions ago in a series of resolutions which the hon. gentleman then submitted to the House, knowing at the same time that he was in a minority, and had no probability of carrying them Sir JOHN O'SHANASSY They were never discussed Mr WALKER remarked that he had not said they were discussed , but the object of the hon gentleman was to place his scheme that of the then Opposition before the country in order that it might be known Mr FINCHAM -What is the Government scheme 1 Mr WALKER, continuing, said that at the time of the dissolution the hon. member for Maldon published a manifesto in which he detailed the principles of the reform scheme which he was prepared to submit to the House, and that scheme was discussed by every politician and every candidate throughout the election contest It was also discussed adversely in some, and favourably in others-by nearly every newspaper in the country, and he (Mr Walker) asserted that the feeling of the country was so much estimate the hon member for Geelong at the general election that he found it neces- Bar} to resign before meeting Parliament that was tantamount to a verdict by the country in favour of the reform scheme submitted by the hon the Premier (Hear, hear.) He (Mr A*i alker) knew enough of politics to know that the attitude of the House since the meeting of Parliament had taken the Opposition members by surprise M BERRY Hear, hear Mr WALKER-It was not what they expected it to be had if the peculiar attitude of Borne hon members had any particular i leaning it was not fairly representative of the verdict which the country returned a few weeks ago ( " Oh, oh He could not understand the position of any hon. member, when he found that he could not sit amongst the Ministers, proceeding to harass and crab ir raBB them as much as possible He could not understand that course of action and he was sure the country would not In referring to the defeat of the late Ministry a great deal had been said about the Roman Catholic vote and plural voting" but had there been any alteration of the Electoral Act amee lb/7 Mr FINCHAM- In the application of it Yes Mr M ALKri -If it was the voice of the people in 1897 Surely it was the voice of the people now He was as much against the system of plural voting as most members, but they should remember that that system had been hitherto used at all elections and the last election should not be singled out as if plural voting, had any special influence 111 that particular case Plural voting, was used by ever) successful artist" 1 0 id mechanic who had by his own industry and frugal to suceeded in getting a little property and if the Opposition declared that plural voting., led to their defeat it was tantamount to admitting, that every man was against them whose interest was 111 good legislation and the best laws If they were prepared to make that admission he (Mr Walker) would be sorry to make it if he were in their place. (Cheers ) W with respect to the position as Burned by the hon. member for Belfast he might say that he respected him as much as any one in the country He respected his attainments as a poMician and because after a very long and prominent political career, his reputation for political honesty and straightforwardness was unblemished But if he was prepared to use those talents and that influence for the purpose of overturning Government after Government 111 a futile endeavour to obtain what was simply not obtainable he was taking a course which would not add to his reputation or be appreciated by the people of this country Sir JOIlis USIU1\ASS\ "Your premises are false Mr W ALKER said that passing away from the reform question he would gladly support the proposition of the Government for the aj 1 ointment of a railway board The amount of patronage involved in working the Government lines rendered it impossible for any Ministry to dispense that patronage profitably to the country. He would go further and have Ministerial patronage dispensed with altogether and the competitive examination system which had worked so well in Great Britain introduced here The hon member for Castlemaine (Professor Pearson) taunted the Government the other evening by asking whether they intended to repeal the stamp duties XX h} should they do that Before the hon. member for Castlemaine had a seat in the House the hon. gentleman who was now at the head of the Government proposed the stamp duties in his budget speech paid in bringing them into operation the late Go \ eminent merely adopted his suggestion " N Ho MUILEK -M hat about the stock tax Mr W ALTER said that if any hon morn beroipoaito would introduce a bill to repeal the stock tax he would vote for it (Hear hear.) It was one of the most iniquitous taxes ever applied in this country, and had been the means of throwing a large number of men out of employment The hon. member for Castlemaine in taunting the Premier with not being identified with the Liberal party here, gave the House to understand that in some mysterious way, his recent visit to England had something to do with the Liberal party getting into power there (Laughter ) But what likeness was there between his policy and the policy of his friends and the policy of the Liberal party in England ' They could not make a man a gentleman by calling him a gentleman any more than they could make a man a Liberal by calling him a Liberal The hon. member also referred to the unemployed, and endeavoured to mysteriously connect the present Government with the number of unemployed in this country But what had this Government to do with it The hon gentlemen opposite had had the policy of the country in their hands for a number of years, and they made the laws which had most to do with giving employment to the people (Hear hear) They had an overwhelming majority combined with the assistance of the hon member for Castlemaine and he (Mr Walker) contended that if the unemployed difficulty is worse now than it was some years a of the party who had been in power during that time were responsible for it and not the party who had just come into effect (Cheers ) The present Mr stry had also been charged with misrepresenta- tion but was it fair or generous or honour- able of the hon member for Castlemaine and his friends to go to the town hall the other night paid lead an excited audience to believe that this Government was, in some way, responsible for the Chinese difficulty, and for their engaging in cabinet and other work in this country "> It was the protective e policy of the late Government which had brought this difiiciUj about and surely they alone were to blame (Hear, hear.) He thought the present Government was entitled to a fair trial, and that nothing was or Id consolidate the Opposition more in the end than by affording an opportunity for that trial and nothing would more will the country to the Government than to refuse a fair trip! He could only add that if the actions which he had de nor iced in the late Government were repeated by the present Ministry, they would are no greater opponent than himself Sir JOHN O'SHANASSY -The lion mern er who has just sat down has reflected upon my character He said that I had made it my practice to overturn every Government that would not make any concessions tome -j No, no your that I was determined to be so I interrupted him by telling him that he started. on false premises I ask him to name any one instance, and if he does not will call upon him to apologise Mr WALKER.-I will easily satisfy the hon. gentleman What I said was intended to be complimentary to him, and I said that if the hon gentleman (hear, hear) was going to use his influence to overturn Government after Government, he would be pursuing a course which the country would not approve of Sir JOHN O'SHANASSY -I understood the hon. member to say I had done so, but putting a suppositious case is also very offensive (Laughter ) Mr. PEARSON also wish to refer to what I think I said or intended to say the other day I express no opinion whatever about Mr 1 arreH s appointment, as, in fact, I heard nothing about it until it was made Mr GAUNSON The hon. member for Richmond said he could not understand the position of members who, when they could not get in the Ministry, sat as far as possible from them and harassed them I have only this to say, that when I was sitting in Opposition beat straight opposite my present seat I could have got a very fair position in this Minist / if I had chosen to accept it, and now, because I did not accept it lara not precluded from giving this Ministry tina sort of But sort- not a servile support, but to attack them when they are wrong and supPort them when they are right That is what I shall do in the future, as I have always done in the past Mr BARR observed that the best points in the Governors Speech appeared to be those which were omitted, and that the address was open to the criticism ' what is true in not new and what is new is not true He was glad to hear the hon member for Nor money declaim BO spiritedly about the clank ing chains which had so long been rattled in the country being about to be done away with But who was it that caused the chains, and prophesied of anarchy, broken heads, and flaming houses' Who was it that sent to England such depressing accounts of our condition at the time we wanted to borrow money The party which did that clanked its charm to some purpose It seemed to him that all this Ministry had done to secure a return of public confidence was their delay of the meeting of Parliament In addition to abolishing the Longmore regulations the Government promised that the selectors should not be harassed out of their holdings by having to make immediate payments but they were told that if they did not pay they must surrender their holdings within a month Mr DUFFY- That is not as I have taken no steps to harass any free selector Mr BARR had certainly been told that what he had stated had been done He did not think the adoption of the American system of dealing with the civil service was calculated to bring about a restoration of public confidence Nor when retrenchment took the form of re appointing one gentleman at a very high salary and offering a gentleman under him on increased salary to remain, could he He the advantage of it. As to putting the railway B under a board they might as well put all the departments under a board The late Ministry were to be praised for leaving so much patronage to their successors It was satisfactory to know that if an epidemic carried off the judges there were all lawyers in the present Government to till their places He thought the reform scheme of the Government would please the Upper House, but he feared it would never reach that Chamber What was the use of carrying on the farce of manhood suffrage vvlulBt plural vote ' re mained? He was for the abolition of plural voting He was gratified to see that the Governors address promised a hill to abolish rabbits and other noxious vermin If it were intended to include political rats, he would give it his hearty support He quoted from a speech of Mr. John Bright to show that in the opinion of that gentleman the House of Commons should have sole control of the finances and then expressed the hope that the Legislative Assembly here would be true to itself and never consent to remit to the other house any question of taxation or expenditure Mr Y\ MADDEN said the hon. member for Richmond (Mr Walker) had very ably dealt with the politics of the past and he now proposed to confine himself to those of the future He did not propose to add to the arguments which had been so ably advanced from both sides of the House on constitutional law but desired to say that because the Service Government was a Government of moderation andmhisopimon acapableGo v eminent, he should give them a hearty support It gave him [.reatsatisfaction to know that the many measures mentioned in the address were to be submitted to hon. members this session and he hoped they would be considered in no factious spirit but in a practical and businesslike way Most of the mci sures were required for the good government of the country and for the development of its resources and the prosperity of its people and he hoped that after being properly discussed they would be allowed to become law without unnecessary delay It was admitted on all hands that reform of the constitution was necessary and the late appeal to the country proved clearly that a moderate an! not in extreme measure was required one that would bring both Houses into harmony, be run to each the powers it should have, and putting, an end to deal locks and if the Service Government passed such a measure they would deserve the thanks of all good and loyal colonists Nothing would bring about a revival in mining, affairs so much as passing a good mining, on private property bill and he hoped they would have a bill that would be satisfactory to the country that would open up a large amount of auriferous land and give employment to a large number of miners for that seemed to him the best and most practical solution of the unemployed difficulty A new Land Act was of course a matter that must be attended to this session in dealing with the question of pastoral accommodation the House would have to be very careful indeed so that those at present in occupation might not be hardly dealt with and, above all, selection must not be stopped if they desired to retain in the colony the Sons a id daughters of the present farmers and selectors who were the best population they cox 'd have The mallee country he hoped, would be dealt with specially for it was not fair and reasonable to ask men to the e up such wretched country at the same rate and under the same conditions as good open country was taken upon At present the mallee was only a sink for capitol, and a breeding ground for rabbits and w ill do 3 paid unless encouragement was given to deal with those pests the whole country would be overrun with them Under the Land Act settlement had progressed wonder fully and Victoria consequently had become a great producer of wheat grown principally in the northern areas It was therefore ira portent that they should encourage the selectors in every possible way sons to keep them on the land, paid for that purpose it was necessary they should have ample railway communication and that there should be good Water supplies for the drier districts for the two latter reasons he was glad the Government saw the urgent necessity which existed for the construction of important railway and water works The exportation of frozen meat he hoped, would be encouraged in every possible way, as it would give the best chance of disposing of the Bar plus sheep and cattle of the colony Another advantage of that trade would be that it would find good heavy cargo for a ship which might be taking away wheat as light cargo and so help to make freight for wheat cheaper The rabbit question must be grappled with for those vermin were in the open country as well as in the mallee and any bill dealing with that question would receive his best attention A judicature bill was promised and such a bill was much wanted It would simplify legal procedure do away with many delays a which were now very perplexing and annoying and it might have the effect of cheaper ing the expensive luxuries of the law An amended Civil Service Act was repaired and he hoped that the result of the labours of the Ministry in that direct on would result in the production of a measure that would give general satisfaction. It was amatterfo cor eratulation that business which had suffered so much during the past two or three years was again reviving and he hoped that with the revival and the return of good seasons and a bound ful In vest there would be general prosperity With the passing of was and moderate measures 1 Parliament that would benefit the whole community and the economical adequate tion of a (lairs the colony would no doubt soon be as prosperous as it was in its best days If the Service Government adopted honest energy economy and moderition as their motto he felt certain they would have a long and useful career (Cheers ) Mr. LYELL said that having handicapper tunity during the last elections of expressing his political A opinions he thought the House would pardon him if he spoke for a few minutes The hon. member for Belfast in making it so clear that under no circumstances would he approve of the Norwegian i scheme made a mistake in not going further and suggesting some practical method of settling a reform bill Mr GAUNSON-Hedid Mr LYELL was fully aware that the suggestion of a joint committee of both Houses was considered by the late Opposition Many of the then Opposition believed that such a plan would have been a good one and, if it had been practical would have been glad to agree to it Mr GAUNSON Mr Service moved it Mr LYELL -When the then Opposition saw that such a thing was unattainable, they did the next thing they thought practicable They felt that the country would not be satisfied by the Opposition merely opposing the Berry Reform Bill and they met and discussed very carefully a resolution submitted by the hon member for Maldon It was a matter of extreme regret to the Opposition that the hon member for Belfast did not come in and join them in their deliberations but no doubt he did not do so for reasons which were good to his own mind Those reasons were patent to the then Opposition, and they accepted them but the hon member for Belfast ought to have suggested something practical when he differed from the other members of the Opposition, or should have gone in and joined them The late House was dissolved on the reform question more than on any thing else and whether the result of the elections could be called an endorsement of the policy of the present Gov- em ment or not, he would say that the country had expressed a verdict in favour of putting a new Government into office The country had entrusted to a new majority the question of settling reform and he held that the hon member for Belfast was bound if he had a proper regard for the best interests of the country to join any party that would bring forward a reasonable scheme of reform If the hon. member for Belfast did not approve of all the details of the scheme that was submitted d he was bound to do nothing that would throw the country back on the question of reform The hon member (Sir John O Shai issy) ought to know now that what he has done has done not a little to unsettle the public mind on the question for he had made it appear that instead of the Ministerial supporters being a steady majority they were divided He hoped that when the hon member came to think a little more formp'ly over the matter, and had a little more leisure, he would see it his duty to give the Government his support As to the Education question he (Mr Lyell) would say there were Borne members of the House who to a certain extent sympathised with the claims of the section of the community the hon. mem- her for Belfast as identified with and he did not hesitate to say he was one of those to a 'limited extent but he had always said that until there was a change of public opinion on the question it was perfectly futile to bring forward an amendment and the best friends of the section of the community he was referring to were those who advised them to let the question stand over and not to bring it forward to delay public business He did not wish to resume his seat without saying that he regretted the press had already berlin to complicate matters to some extent by referring to a dissolution When her members had settled down to the business of the session he hoped they would be found able to do as they had put forward He thought it was very injud cious on the one hand to refer to the effects of a possible dissolution of on the other to canvass the action of hon members who might declare a certain amount of independence by selecting certain seats It was utterly destructive of the independence which ought to be charac- teristic of every hon member Until he took a definite position his action should not be anticipated by any criticisms of the press Mr DAVIES contended that there had been an unconstitutional postponement of the opening of Parliament which had deprived the country of representation for three months. The only reply the Government could make was that two or three months were not too long a time for them to prepare their measures Nobody denied that but the postponement was unconstitutional not on account of its length but because it had taken place without the sanction of Parliament. The manner in which the mover of the address had criticised the actions of the late Gov en ment was unprecedented His remarks were in bad taste and it was a judicious to rent an old sores If the supporters of the Government intended to pr each peace they must also practise it When they sat in On position they did not exhibit a peaceful demeanour They not only attacked men's public actions of an outrageous way but also entered into questions of a private character The r indecent attacks were made both in the House and out of doors at public meet- aga Mr G VL\SO\ -It is utterly untrue Mr D WILS -Not in regard to some members In some cases as they fled to come see their audience by argument they as a last resource shook m people a faces what they called a bunch of fives ( Hear hear and laughter ) Mr. G VUNSON -That is not true Mr DAVIES-non gentlemen who in dulged in such conduct ought to be the last to I reach ] peace and good behaviour Mr LENT - If you meet me you can have both Mr DAVIES went on to say that in his own case he had not stolen disrespectfully of as one of the a hat and did not mean to do it in the future he should be sorry to see members of the present House indulging in personalities He intended to offer no factious 01 position to the Government and he should treat every hon member as a gentle as (Hear hear ) Mr. BOLTON said that the courtesy and consideration which the House had shown to new members induced him to offer a few remarks He was glad to learn that an under Bta long had been arrived at to close the debate "in enable the House to get on with business No doubt this was an opportune time to discuss the programme of the Government but the proper time to deal with the details of the measures mentioned in the speech would be when those measures were introduced The present was a critical period in the history of the county the great produce g interest in the colony was in a double Estate and trade still do ceased As far as he had been able to observe the country demanded that the difficulties of the situation should be grappled with in on in te'Ugeut and comprehensive e spirit Reference had been made to the influence which a certain interest had exercised it the general election He regretted with some other members that the complaints of that interest could not be fairly and equitably just lied but he trusted that the House would give the subject due consideration when it come before them He hoped that there would be a recognition of the principle that justice and liberality went hand in hand and that everything, partaking of the nature of class legislation would be removed nothing would do more to retard the national progress than class hatred (Hear hear ) Mr LONGMORE considered that the Government could have had no other object in postponing Parliament until the 11th May than to show that at the elections an extraordinary triumph had been won over the Liberal party Mr GILLIES -That was not the reason Mr LONGMORE Then their choosing that particular day was very singular There was a singular difficulty amongst hon gentlemen on the opposite side The hon. member for Belfast had stated that he had assisted 20 of them to their seats and the Gov- eminent did not say a word against him or his party until it suited them It was also amusing to find that the Hon James Service. an out and out protester-(Laughter and What is that alongside of the bon mern cr for Warrnambool also a true blue-who ROI his seat by dividing parties unfairly and unjustly, and to know that both of them held their seats through the good offices of the hon. member for Belfast It was also refresh- ing to know that the hon member for Belfast could i Beat them at any moment he might choose The hon. member had only to cross the floor with two or three of his party and he would put the Government ma minority at once It was a pity to find our r to bruCE so much dependent upon the hon. member for Belfast Sir JOHN OoHANASSY-They are all Catholics in the Government (Laughter ) Mr. LONGMORE] If he did not mistake the hon. member who had been denominate 1 the high priest of the Government had an in. ci view with the hon. member for Belfast before the general election Sir JOHN OSHWASSY-Tliey were all interviewing me both sides avery day (Laughter ) Mr. LONGMORE It had been said that the country went unmistakably against the late Mr istry The country, however, did not go against the policy of the late Government but the Education question was brought. \ in- (Sir JOHN O'SHANASSY -' hear, hear as an element to strengthen the other side After all said and done however, now that they had got a good Government they should rest satisfied and be thankful Hear, hear ) They had got one of the most religious of men at the head of the Government At Geelong the Premier publicly thanked God that he had ousted the late Government Sir JOHN O'SHANASSY Don't you think he ought to have thanked the hon member for Belfast rather ' (Laughter ) Mr LONGMORE-The Premier said ' he thanked God they (the Government) were not Liberals in the fence Mr SERVICE Of Longmore (Laughter ) Mr LONGMORE-If he was not he would not occupy these benches very long Mr GAUNSÛN-The hon member for Ripon and Hampden is smiling now Let him proceed (Laughter ) Mr LONGMORE So much was this Government in favour with God he aun posed-that the hon. member for Warinara bool, in the language of the Premier, " offered his services without money and without price to the God fearing Ministry Again, the Premier had " fought the good fight - why his language almost made one weep for joy- (laughter)-" fought the good fight even unto victory But there was a very heavy phalanx that helped them to fight, and they did not wish to give an of the fruits, of victory to that party Sir JOHN O SHANASSY Hear, hear Stick to that line (Laughter ) Mr TONGMORE-lhe Premier in his Geelong speech went on to say that the principles his Government contended for were fair and honest that they would have nothing corrupt and no class legislation With this God fearing Government in office, there would be no more corrupt proceedings Mr LAURENS -No more Longmore regu labour Mr LONGMORE-The Chief Secretary was very gushing at Hamilton He told the good people there that the present Ministry would have gladly remained in their private state, but that they had been called to office by the universally expressed opinion of the country He (Mr Longmore) could not quite conceive how that hon. gentleman would have gladly remained in private life, for he had always come to the front when he had the chance Mr RAMSAY Don't you remember that you begged of me to take office in the Government, and that I refused to yourself on three occasions ? Mr LONGMORE-The hon member was not likely to be offered office by him again There was not so much known of him just then, but now it had been found that his sympathies were all on the other side Mr RAMSAY-And I held office for three years without pay, which is more than ever you did (Cheers 1 Mr LONGMORE -Now that the country had a Ministry that was above con option the people would surely be satisfied, and it was to be hoped that they would realise all they expected The newspaper that represented the icehouse the present Government wrote the other day that at any rate the administrative acts of the Government were above criticism He (Mr Longmore), however, contended that they were open not only to fair but to severe criticism The Minister of Lands on taking office, boasted that it was the first time the son of a former M water had become a member of the Government The hon gentleman had, however, hardly supported the credit of his father so far as liberal! land legislation was concerned OF ) The hon gentleman was well aware that the Land Act of 1862 had been a complete failure, and that his father got the credit Mr DUFFY appealed to the Speaker on behalf of his father To criticise anything his father had done when he was not presen- to defend himself was not only unfair, but indecent (Hear, hear.) Mr. LONGMORE was only going to say that he was present when the debate on the Land Bill of 1862 took place and when the discussion occurred between the hon gentleman B father and Mr Ireland The latter announced publicly that he had inserted a word in a clause for the purpose of defeating the act Sir JOHN O SHANASSY-The hon. member is quite mistaken The word "assigns' was put in with the consent of every member of the Government after full consideration The discussion took place as to whether conditions should appear on the Crown grant, and the best law authorities were in favour of not putting them on Therefore the conditions were struck out ad- visedly, and the word assigns substituted. The whole Government were satisfied with this arrangement An HON MEMBER -Mr Ireland is dead , let him alone Mr LONGMORE -Yes, he is dead, and the evil he did lives after him Sir JOHN O'SHANASSY -I will not allow him to be maligned of the word " assigns was not put in for the purpose of defeating the act, but for law reform with regard to conditions of title I am a living witness to that fact Mr LONGMORE would not call it in question further but would simply say that the word did defeat the act He defended the then Minister of Lands (Mr C Gavan Duffy) under difficult circumstances butwithregard to his Bon-that gentleman had cut the ground from under his feet by taking away his own power of dealing with lands that were open for selection Mr DUI rv -I have not done so Mr LONGMORE No sooner was the hon. gentleman in office than he abolished the regulations hon. members should understand that these regulations were neces Bau to counteract the el acts of dummyism. Multitudes of reports had been received from Crown lands bailiffs that they believed certain men were dummies but that they could not prove it Mr GAUNSON And you acted on the principle of learning, a man on such action Mr LONGMORE Moreover instances were found of suspected men who transferred their lands immediate! their three years were up to the men for whom they were supposed to be acting, as dummies The Minister of Lands further knew that the House agreed to those regulations by a n won ty of six or eight The hon. member took away from himself the power of delaying i proceedings in cases where a transfer of land was about to take place Mr G AUN SON -ne never any legal power to stop it The judges of the Supreme Court bay so Mr LONGMORE-He had The act gave the Governor power to me a regulations consistent with the net One of the first acts of the Minister was to repeal those regulations, and he would have done so sooner if the banks had not interfered Mr DUn Y Nonsense that is not true Mr LONGMORL-that was an act of administration worthy of all condemnation, and the result would be to give the land wholesale into the hands of capitalists and the banks Mr M INTYRE-V\bj dont you throttle them ' Mr LONGMORE That is about as wise as most of the hon members exclamations Mr M ENTIRE -Is that an explanation Mr LONGMORE-lhe Kerrydale dum mines were dealt with by me a considerable time before I left office A certain time is allowed for appealing but they never thought of appealing I suppose they did not think they would get fair i lay ( ' near hear and laughter ) U they waited for the next Ministry to give them fair play Mr DUrr Y sAnd they got it Mr LONGMORE -The hon. member found with all his desire to upset the proceedings he could not Mr DUFFY -I did not The hon. member has no right to say such a thing He cannot know it to be a fact and it is not a fact Mr LONGMORE-The hon. member saw the advertisement calling upon the owner of Kerrisdale run to show cause why he ran should not be forfeited Mr DUFFY -I postponed it Mr LONGMORE -The hon, member in not, he simply t withdrew it. Perhaps the Age had an effect upon him as ithadaCfct*>d some hon members with reference to the education que lion He brought the station holder before him and forfeited his run Mr S FRASE R -And saved an innocent man from him Mr LONGMORE-If man took a shilling from the lion ment r he would not give him three or four months time before sending him down He found a in in who was supposed to have means of his II defeated the Land Act robbed the people of their territory, station led witnesses to swear falsehoods he found by careful investigation that this man must forfeit his run and he told him he would not take it from him until the 1st of June in case he should suffer m convenience In all seriousness he (Mr Longmore) would kill the hon. member that he was a renegade from liberal principles J! Mr DUiri-Thais not true Mr LONGMORE -He has gone in body and soul to Rene the landed proprietors and capital sts Mr DUriY-That is absolutely untrue Mr LONGMORE-The hon member was quite disgusted with the inquiry Mr DUFFY So was the Arte newspaper, and every one else who heard the evidence Mr LONGMORE-the inquiry brought out the fact that the e men were dummies, and the hon. member's i) s there shall be no more such inquiries, but that the case shall be tried in court of law Mr GAUNSON Quite right too There will then be no underhand practices Mr LONGMOU -The Minister now has not the means to enable him to stop such cases Mr GAUNSON -no never had Mr LONGMORE -At all events I exercised that power Mr GAUNSON -Unlawfully. Mr LONGMORr-It a no matter. lever exceed the power, and the people of the colony were willing that the power should be exercised Mr GAUNSON-To their own injury Mr LONGMORE -I did not wish to once into a discussion as to the legality of what has been done No one has quoted a single authority "1 support of the action of the Government Had we been allowed to meet Parliament and carry on, there would have be in no difficulty fair JOHN O ¡iHANASSY -

Mr. GILLIES-I think the hon member when arguing upon another point has asserted that it is a very difficult thing to draw a line between a strictly legal exercise of authority vested in our Constitution Act and the constitutional exercise of that power (Hear, hear") Sir JOHN O'SHANASSY -No, no Mr GILLIES- Yes and lum speaking within the recollection of several hon. members of this Chamber Sir JOHN O'SHANASSY You are laying down a false proposition about my views Mr GILLIES -The hon member must permit me to make a reference to what I understood him to say.

Mr. GILLIES -It is not false at all. Sir JOHN O'SHANASSY India Mr. GILLIES "Well, really, Mr. Speaker, I think for the credit of this House it is really too bad of the hon. member. I shall be compelled to ask Sir JOHN 0'SF4 NASMYTH rise to a point of order, Mr. GILLIES There is no point of order. Mr. GAUNSON.-You are not to judge. You must sit down. Sir JOHN O'SH ANA SS Sit down, sir; cocky 08 you are, you must take your seat. Laughter ) Mr. Speaker, I have been to a point of order. Mr. GILLIES -I decline to be told to take my seat by the hon. member. Sir JOHN O'SHANASSY. The hon. gentleman must sit down, by the rate of this House, when an hon. member rises to a point of order. Mr. GILLIES There is no point of order Sir JOHN O'SHANASSY The point of order is this, that if on hon. member asserts a thing of on hon. member, which that hon member denies, he has no right to reiterate it. The SPEAKER -The hon. gentlemen was quoting from a statement in Hansard. I do not understand that the hon. gentleman attempted to make a statement, but he was repeating what appeared in the papers and in Hansard. Mr. GILLIES then repeated his assertion with respect to the Governor having acted constitutionally, and said that the course which the Governor had taken was the usual thing to do. He could show dozens of prece- dents. Mr. GAUNSON.-Go back to Charles I Mr. GILLIES said he would not go back 100 years, but would refer to the year 1860. It would be remembered that when the writs were issued for a dissolution of the House of Commons, the writs or the proclamation contained the notice which summoned the new Parliament together. If it is thought desirable to postpone the meeting of Parliament after the general election, it can be prorogued from time to time for five or six months by Her Majesty's Privy Council. Major SMITH Without wearing many of the members' Mr. GILLIES-Certainly. On the 6th July, 1865, the House of Commons was dissolved, and the proclamation issued with the writs called Parliament together on the 15th August. On the latter date several members appeared. and the trade' proclamation was read proroguing Parliament - before any members were sworn in on a Speaker elected -to the 1st November. On the 1st November the same ceremony was gone through, and Parliament was further prorogued to the 23rd November. It was then further pro- rogued to the 28th December, and afterwards to the 1st February, when it met for the despatch of business. (Hear, hear ) That was a case in point. It was asserted by hon. members that because a new Government took office after Parliament had been elected, that that new Government was bound to meet Parliament in the shortest possible time. Sir JOHN O'SHANASSY. Todd 18 the best authority. Mr. GILLIES -What was to be gained by pursuing that course ' Sir JOHN O'SH ANASSY.-That is begging the question. Mr. GILLIES.-I will not beg the question The hon. member spoke the other evening for an hour without a word of interruption, and I am interrupted every sentence. It is intolerable. What is the object of it? Sir JOHN O'SHANASSY. To set you right Mr. GILLIES -I was' not permit it. You are not able to set me right Mr. GAUNSON.-Cock-a-dood'e-doo-oo-oo ' (Laughter.) Mr. GILLIES.-What was to be gained by meeting Parliament at the first appointed date ? He could understand the argument if it were alleged that Parliament could then have met for the despatch of business, but that had not been contended by any member for a moment One hon. member, no doubt, said in a sort of jocular way that the delay kept hon. members out of their sugar, but even from that points view it was a complete mistake, for the House could not have met for the despatch of business on the 6th Marchand therefore could not have dealt with the payment of members question. If the Government had met Parliament on the 9th March it would only have been to enable hon. members to be sworn in Theuauol adjournment for Ministers to go to their constituents would have followed, and no practical good would have resulted A" the prece- dents of the Imperial Parliament were based upon common sense and experience If experience did not prove it useful to do certain things, no precedent was made it were well to consider how everyone of those precedents had been built up His colleague the other evening pointed out one of the first cases which occurred in which a Government after a general election resigned, and the new Government took office while Parliament was not sitting what was the case of Mr (Gladstone's ISlib There had been three of these precedents in England Mr JAMES.-Four during the past 12 years Mr. GILLIES -The precedents parallel to our case were those of 1888 1874, and that of the present year In this, after the general election, Mr. Gladstone was compelled to take office It was very important to note what then happened, and what was the cause of the thing happening The Governor here had power, even after the general election, to issue writs, though the other evening some hon. members denied that Mr GAUNSON -In such a case as this. Mr GILLIES asserted that in this particular case, the Governor had power under the Constitution Act to issue writs This state of things could not possibly arise at home at a", because if a vacancy occurred there after the general election was over the Crown could not issue a writ the writ must be issued by the Speaker InlbMS the Gladstone Government decided that it was the proper thing to allow Parliament to meet on the day first fixed, but with the simple object of having the writs issued, in order that they might at once go before their constituents It vvnaamoatimportantthingforboii members to hear this in mind, for if there had been in Eng and the power the Government contended there was here for the Crown to issue writs when a vacancy occurred after a general election and before the election of Speaker, what would have happened The Gladstone Government would not have called Parliament together then The Gladstone Government called Parliament together simply for the issue of writs for their re- election Mr G AUNbON - When were they issued ? I Mr GILLIES -Immediately Mr GAUNSON-After the time allowed for petitioning' | Mr. GILLIES would make that matter clear when the time came Parliament was a simply cored get her to enable writs to be issued for the election of Ministers. Sir JOHN O'SHANASSY. That controls the whole case. Mr GILLIES agreed that it did control the whole case. May said, page 138 " In 1868 an exceptional course in the opening of Parliament was rendered necessary by peculiar cir- constance Parklands at had been dissolved In November. and went to meet on Thursday, 10th Do cember A week before this time, however, Ministers resigned, and Mr Gladstone was summoned to Windsor to form a new Administration, which was sworn in on the 9th December To live prorogued Parliament at so short a notice would have been highly inconvenient, while without any Ministers in the House of Commons, and without proper consul lition, it vvasnotposslblo to open Parliament in the accustomed manner, with a Queen's speech and al dresses from both Houses A precedent was found in Dccorubor,'1705, when the Rockingham Ministry having come into office during the recess the King in person opened Parliament in a speech, in which he adverted briefly to the troubles then come mencing In the American colonies, but said he had then called Parliament together to give an opportunity of issuing writs This precedent, however, was so far objectionable, as the speech having all the usual solemnities, required addresses in an finer, and was, in fact, the occasion of Pincw'tnoiits and debates A more conv lenient course was therefore taken Instead of a Queen's speech, the Lords Com missionary under the great seal for opening and holding the Parliament had it further in command to acquaint both Houses that place the time when her Majesty had deemed H "gift to call them together, ft v eral v Rcaicics had been caused by the acceptance of office from the Crown, and that it was Her MaJesty s pleasure that an opportunity should now be given in virtue was his and that after a suitable rooms Hey might proceed to the consideration of such a matters us would then be laid before them By this I roger ling, which was merely formal, the necessity of addresses was a v i sided there w Lro no debates, the new writs were issued, and both Houses adjourned It was thus clearly laid down that that was the reason for meeting Parliament on the day first fixed and not to carry out any constitutional principle obliging Ministers to at once meet Parliament the object was simply that the writs might at once be issued There were a number of precedents to show that during the time Parliament was not in session a new Government might hold office and not civil 1 parliament together for months. The Duke of Portland resigned office during a recess A new Government took office and did not meet Parliament on the day D'st fixed but waited several months The Duke of Portland resigned in October 1869 In November follow ing Mr Perceval took office, but did not at once so before his constituents, and did not meet Parliament until the 23rd January Canning died when Parliament was out of season Another Government took office and not only without calling Parliament together, but it held office for a number of months and never met Parliament at all Lord Melbourne resigned on the 30th November, 1844, and Peel took office, but did not think proper to meet the then systems Parliament at oil Ho dissolved that Parliament without having taken his seat in it as a Minister, and met the new Parliament. The gravamen of the charge against the present Government was that it did not meet Parliament on the 9th March There was no constitutional precedent against that course Mr GAUNSON To make that a good precedent, you should have dissolved Parliament Mr GILLIES -No doubt it was strictly within constitutional precedent to dissolve Parliament without meeting Parliament at all in the case of the present Government, the Governor, they believed, Was compelled to issue the writs after the general election, and they went before their constituents, but they felt there was no obligation to call Parliament together for the despatch of business earlier than they did They knew that they could not possibly proceed to the despatch of business on the 9th March There was no advantage to be gained by co" mg Parliament together on that date, but, on the contrary, very much was to be gained by postponing the meeting for a reasonable time, in order that the Government might be prepared with proper measures The Government had been changed with the assertion that the Governor had no right to issue writs under the 28th section of the Constitution Act. ("Hear, hear, from the Opposition ) He was glad to hear the hon. member for South Grant (Mr Lalor) say " hear, hear" to that remark, because he wished to draw attention to a famous resolution in which that hon member desired to set the doctrine up In 1874 a member of the Government resigned The present Attorney General, who, he believed, was then Sol citor General, accepted the office of Attorney- General, and had to vacate his seat, and the Governor issued a writ after the general election and before Parliament met On that occasion the question was raised in Parliament, and it was thought of sufficient importance to refer it to the Committee on Standing Orders, and the hon member for South Grant submitted the following resolution on the question : "That the power of the Governor to cause writ after a general election does not arise until after the election of a Speaker shall have taken place, and then only on the occurrence of any vacancy when there should be no Speaker and the Assembly not in session, or when the Speaker shall be Incapacitated or absent from Victoria. is. (2 Hear, hear, ' from members of the Opposi- tion ). He trusted hon members opposite would not applaud before the proper time came Although the hon member for South Grant proposed that resolution, he was the only solitary member of the committee who voted for it (Hear, hear.) The committ' j, indeed, unanimously voted that the law the hon. member for South Grant proposed was wrong, Mr GAUNSON-Not at all Your amendment was practically that Mr GILLIES -The hon member was quite mistaken When the hon. member for South Grant proposed that what had been done was illegal, the committee decided against him, so that the question raised by the hon member for Ararat at the commencement of this session had been considered before Mr LA LOR, Will the hon member read the resolution arrived at by the committee as to the necessity of altering the law' Mr GILLIES was coming to that, but with reference to the power of the Governor to issue a writ under the circumstances, he did not see how there could be any doubt about that at all The language of the section was perfectly plain, and it was not merely an act of discretion on the part of the Governor but the matter was placed in such a way as to compel the Governor to issue a writ the moment a vacancy occurred. No hon member would challenge that vacancies did occur after the last general elections by the acceptance of office of certain gentlemen, and the Governor was then bound to issue Wilts, and that was the conclusion arrived at by the Standing Orders Committee to which he had just referred. It had also been contended that because the Governor had issued writs on the present occasion he had prevented petitioning to Parliament against the elections He would challenge any hon. member to point out a solitary instance in which office was accepted by a Government after a general election, either before or after the meeting of Parliament, when writs were not immediately issued either by the Governor or the Speaker before the time for petitioning had expired (Hear hear) ] very Governor or Speaker had no amiably issued writs immediately under such circumstances, and it was the case when the hon. member for Geelong took office at the commencement of the last Parliament (Hear, hear) Another objection had been raised that the members of the Government had been sworn in improperly He was rather surprised at that objection being taken The Governor, under the Constitution Act, appointed a committee to swear in hon. members on the assembling of a Parliament and the Speaker had no authority to swear in anyone afterwards unt ' he was also appointed a commissioner hon. members seemed to consider that the members of the Ministry could only be sworn in before the Speaker, which was quite a mistake, because they could have been sworn in before the Governor himself or any commissioner he might apply it as they were members of the Assembly just the same as the other persons elected were members Then it was said that, having been elected after the general election, they should have been introduced between two members up to the table, and sworn in before the Speaker That matter of introducing a member between two other members, and swear it him in at the table, was only followed accordance with a rule of the House of Commons, adopted a century ago Mr LALOR -W horn were Ministers introduced to Mr GILLIES They were introduced to nobody The table had no virtue, and the Speaker had no virtue (Laughter from the Opposition ) We", for the Boke of hon. members opposite, he would assume they had a" the venue on their side There was nothing whatever in the assumption that Ministers ought to have been introduced between two hon. members up to the table, and be sworn before the Speaker Nothing can k1 prevent the members of the Government from coming up to be sworn As members of Part amenities were entitled to be sworn either before the Governor, or such commissioner as he appointed The re reason why the Opposition objected to the procedure of the Government was that they desired to elect their own Spencer He undertook to say that if the Government had not presented themselves to be sworn but allowed the Opposition to appoint their ov a Speaker, as no doubt they would have done with eight members absent, vO'*} little would have been heard about the conduct of the Government in postponing the meeting of 1 all smut, or in berne, re elected at the time they were He confessed he regretted to hear the hon. member for Geelong say the other evening that, in consequence of the course which had been pursued on this occasion, he for one would never repeat the practice if he again had the opportunity of resigning after a general election before Parliament met As far as the material value of the meeting of Parliament itself was concerned nothing had been lost, but a great deal gained He was perfectly satisfied that they were in a position to proceed more dispassionately and quietly in the interests of the country with business than if they had met on the 9th March, to enable members to discuss the conduct of the Government on the motion for the election of the Speaker \- a course which would not only have been inconvenient, but unheard of He was quite convinced that it would be a mistake for any Government, under like circumstances, to meet Parliament earlier than they did Now, if he had been asked to frame acaBoexactl} on all fours with the present, he could not have selected a better one than occurred in Canada in 1878 The Mackenzie Government were in office this year Parliament was prorogued from the 10th May is the 29th July, and it was further prorogue to the 7th September But on the 7th August Parliament was dissolved The writs were issued on the 17th August, and return able on the 21st November the general election happened in the meantime, and after the general election the Mackenzie Government resigned Sir John A. Macdonald took office after the general election and before the meeting of Parliament. The writs for the re election of members were issued on theo*h November, and Parliament was further pro- re used to the 31st December It was again further prorogued to the 8th February, and again further prorogued to the 13th 1 February when the) new Government met Parliament for the first time (Cheers ) The House on lit now to hear no more about the Government having acted uneotistitutionj"y in postponing the meeting of Parliament from the 6th March to the 11th May (Cheers ) Mr RICHARDSON said that it always afforded him great pleasure to listen to the Minister of Railways when a question of practice or constitutional law was under discussion But he ventured to say that not one of the English precedents quoted by the hon gentleman was on all fours with the case now under consideration The case of the Canadian Government was in point, but he desired to ask the hon. gentleman whether he ought not to take into consideration all the circumstances which had led up to the present complaint against the Government One fact the hon "gentleman had entirely overlooked, viz, that him- self and his colleagues insisted before the dissolution that the new Parliament should be summoned to meet by a particular day. After the general election, however, they advised the Governor to turn his back on the advice he received, and appoint Parliament to meet at a later date than they themselves had first insisted on To eight or 10 weeks the country had been governed without a Parliament There was no authority for the actions of the Admuus tration, except that which they received from the Governor himself-none from Parliament The Government claimed that the new writs had been properly issued under the 76th section of the El z toral Act, but reading that section with the 74th he contended that the section depended on by them only applied to the issue of writs after a Speaker had been elected The third of the resolutions passed by the Standing Orders Committee substan daily carried out the proposition of the hon member for Grant (Mr. Lalor) It was as FOLLOWS - "that no writ Bhoiidbo issued by the Spent or until the expiry of the time appointed by lawlor petitioning ' That was substantially and really the crack tice which was intended by the 13th section of the Electoral Act, and indeed that on peared to common sense to be the law itself (The next resolution ran thus - " that the Governor should only issue a writ in the absence of the speaker such as the Speaker would have been entitled to issue " The late Mr G Paton Smith, while discussing the case which occurred in 1874, contended that the Ministry ought not to advise the Governor to issue writs before the meeting of Parliament This Government ought to have regarded the report of the Standing Orders Committee as a final authority, and followed the course that committee recommended It had been asked what would have been gained if the House had met on the 9th March ' Well, no charge would have been raised against the Government The hon. member for Belfast had also pointed out that if Par liament had met then he would have insisted on obtaining certain terms from the new Government, and in default have supported the late Ministry and kept them in office He (Mr Richardson) had no sympathy with a free siding of that kind, but only wanted to know what might have been done. Dr MADDEN It could not have been done Mr RICHARDSON -If the late Government had not retired Dr MADDEN That is another entirely different thing Mr RICHARDSON-In that case the hon. member for Belfast would have been in a position to impose conditions on the new Government before he supported them in their effort to turn out the other Govern- ment Dr MADDEN And then be would have had to retire from public life for the rest of his days Mr RICHARDSON was not justice. mg the notion of the hon member for Bel 1st, army pointing out what could have been done 'The Commissioner of Railways was right when he said that the gravamen of the charged levelled against the Government was their action in connexion with the election of the Speaker If it was true, as he supposed it was from the discussion which had taken place, that the Government postponed the meeting of Parliament, because by so doing" they saw they would be enabled to elect the Speaker, then he must say they had placed the House and the country and themselves in an unworthy position And the Governent were as much to be condemned for r istpon mg Parliament if that was their only reason for doing so, as the Opposition were to be condemned for complaining of their conduct as unconstitutional', because it deprived them of the opportunity of electing their Sr nker Mr GILLIES -That was not the reason at all Mr RICHARDSON-I am pleased to hear the hon. member say that was not the reason Mr GILLI] S -The Govern meat had not determined who they would support for election as Speaker when they are red the date of the meeting of Parliament (Hi i-, hear ) Mr RICHARDSON would accept the hon. gentleman B statement since he said so, but he thought it should be admitted that the Government had determined upon having their own nominee elected to the Speakers chair He had no doubt that the Government had pursued an unwise course, and he could only hope now that they would take steps to secure a uniformity of practice in regard to the matter in dispute in the future Mr GRAy IS desired to explain his position to the House towards the end of the last Parliament it was generally understood that he was to present himself to his constituents for re-election The hon. member for Collingwood (Mr Mirams) about that time however, wrote such an extraordinary letter that he (Mr C Graves) was filled with amazement to find himself again in the House. It was addressed to Mr S Samuel, and ran as follows - " Parliament lion c Melbourne, february i laso "DcirSn -Iitloic I ictelitljour tells, -us find we then to you asking you whether you would contest the seat for LEast If you do not think we all of that offer, there is Delatite which is a Fore seat for you I have sent you a select a n, In which I say we have the choice of several seats to offer you I have named one lucre la in addition Molni Itoilnej andtlcOieiB I beg, of you not to given, any unnecessary trout To but It is 0 Nonnaubv and do take one of the places i tried (Laughter ) Ihcrotlll be no question about but 5th of a 11th Several persons from -vol namely waited upon me, and several telegrams tine also desiring to him v well at they should do and pointing out that Carrington had the best the nee I told them that we v wanted to know their n hid and in any port the man they fired - Yours truly, JAMES Mm.MH In reply to that, however, he (Mr Graves) had ben re-elected He reiterated to his constituents the exact pledges he made when he first stood for Delatite in 1877 He ex pressed himself in favour of an immediate reform of the Upper House by reducing the tea n of ellice from 10 to 9 years by giving the Governor power to dissolve that Chamber under certain conditions, by abolishing the 1 roi city qualification, by reducing" the provinces, and by making the ratepayers roll the elder told basis with regard to his present position it had been said that have no voted against the third Reform Bill 01 he late Mn'Strv, he was bound to take his seat on the side of the present Government In answer to that he would say that when before his constituents he was asked if in the event of his return he would cut upon the then Ministry, the Opposition, or the Collier party paid the following was his reply -' I am exactly of the same politics as when I entered the House, an independent liberal pled ed to a clear and distinct por tital platform, a reasonable protest tioniBt, in favour of realised were being made to pay his share of a nation, against the monopoly and centralisation now going on in Melbourne, in f a our of a reduction or customs duties on necessaries of life and accessories of industry that cannot be produced in the country, thoroughly opposed to the setting of class against class, for freedom from oppression, and having sat for three years in the independent corner I do not intend to leave that position I am not, and never have been an Oppositionist, or direct or in direct follower of Mr Service, and I could not follow his leadership for many reasons Having stated his reasons so clearly, he had not been returned under false pre- tenceS After the elections, he was classed as a Ministerialist, but he immediately wrote to The At gun asking to be called an Independent member, and that was the position he now occupied If the Government bill, with regard to the provisions of which he was perfectly ignorant, was in accord with the pledges he had given, he should give the Government In a cordial support, but not otherwise He was pledged against the Norwegian Boheme, and against the plebiscite, and could vote accordingly, but he did not know whether the Norwegian principle contained in the Government bill was the same as that proposed by Mr E Francis which he considered to be unconstitutional With regard to the I Longmore regulations he had seconded the motion of the hon member for Kara Kara to abolish them and afterwards vote" against them j He thoroughly approved of the abolition of those regulations but he protested against the way they had been abolished as berne, distinctly unconstitutional He had heard a very able debate on the subject of tbcfuilureof Government to call Parliament, and had a ened with interest to the opinions of the 1 in members for Belfast and Ararat As far r his judgment went he considered the i instry had acted strictly within the letter of the law, but totally unconscious onally To people of the colony, he thought would no endorse the action of the Govern- mi it with regard to either of the mt less he had referred to The engi area of construction of railways had been dry SEed, but he ventured to assert that the dismissal would be as distasteful to the you try SB Black Wednesday It was the same thing, only in detail An HON MEMBER That S quite hale.
