Ã€ Cannibal Bald. We note by the Normanton Chronicle that about two months ago a cannibal raid toole place on a small island adjoining the Admir- alty Group on the North East coast ot New Guinea. This may be regarded as a distinct and emphatic protest against Governor Le Hunte in persistently preventing the impor- tation of cattle. The ghosts of that one hundred, will, if they are properly behaved spooks and are up to their, business, haunt the Governor until he alters his meat exclusion policy. Writing seriously, it does seem to us stupendous folly to exclude live bullocks from the British new colony. And for no other reason, as we know, than because Gover- nor Macgregor did not deem the importation wise. No possible loss could result from per mining tick-proof cattle-thatis cattle which have got over the fever-from being landed iu New Guinea. It might uf course not suit the cards of the Port Moresby people who own the three or four hundred head of cattle now there, and from which the settlement de- rives its weekly costly steak, but New Guinea will never be properly colonised on tinned dog.
