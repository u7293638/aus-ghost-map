It could hardly be called recite tion in the familiar sense It was not mere reading, for although he had the manuscript always before him, or rather beneath him, he seldom stopped to study it-not often even glanced at it. But he spoke like an ordinary cultured English gentleman reading aloud to an audience on some subject in which he is deeply interested, and about which he was lies to enrol their interest His voice was clear, but had no threat capacity or variety of sound Yet the effect which was produced by certain passages of his readings was such 13 could hear Hy be surpassed by the most brilliant professional lucifer the closing sentences of the lecture on George In the description of the blind, deaf, insane old man wandering through his rooms and murmuring Milson's pathetic and terrible words 11 bout the darkness the npjropmto appeal from Shakespeare's " King Lear's to "see. not his ghost, oil let it pass all this used to be listened to by audiences as he positively hold their breath to hour or pay word and then when the whole was done, relieved their holdings he peal after peal of applause The unaffected simplicity of the period named was probably one other great chair in Ihm horny fins very happy, too, in dancing sometimes do words of others like recitations erect a bridge of sighs " was most pathetic and touching, even heart piecing There are and there were some of our public men v he might have done wonders in the way of public recitation if only the destinies had forced them to enter the field The late Mr Bright for instance who could have recited Milton as he could p He delighted in leading Milton to his friends, and dull indeed must the friend have been who did not delight in the recitation The late Beau Stanley hear "Mr Blight quote at a dinner given to the American and slavery og tenor, Mr Gamson some 1 nos from a nut Paul, and he cox leased a rapt u your wish that he could hear them even for once, delivered from an English pulpit with such simple and sublime effect We have heard that Mr Irwin was in mously impressed by Mr Gladstone is very of delivering Some Tues- from Hamlet Mr Irving, it should be said by the way, has a very remarkable gift of recitation altogether apart from his gifts as air actor- for, as we have said, acting and recitation are quite different things in art Garrick had great qualities as a reciter, although it use 1 to delight Dr Johnson to set him what we may call puzzles in emphasis and to it is st that he laid the stress upon the wrong word even now and then I ho business of public section tion is one which can give the very highest delight of the very dullest depression to an audience Men like Mr Brandram and Mr Bellew were looked for with the keenest expectation and longing b) vast popular gatherings In this country we have a large proportion of intelligent people who for one reason or another will not go to a theatre Mr Brandram brought hotheads or at all cv cuts he brought the drama to such people, and he thereby rendered them a most valuable service which was undoubtedly well appreciated how man ever enjoyed a wider popularity or were more wet tonic when they came Uti example ought to be followed-that is to say, the men and women with the gift ought to use the gift publicly for the public delight Mr Bnndram became a public and professional rector unwillingly, and only because the conditions of his life at one time compelled him to make use of his marvellous me in cry and his endow- ment of voice and expression as a means of liv echoed j I the conditions which compelled him to this course I were his losses, but were too public gain
