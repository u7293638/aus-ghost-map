EXECUTION. George Worrall, who was convicted on Friday last of the murder of Frederick Fisher, yesterday suffered the dreadful sen- tence of the law. Till about 5 o'clock on the morning of his execution, he persisted in asserting his innocence, when he was at length induced to acknowledge to a gentleman, who had sat up with him during the night, that he, alone had perpetrated the murder, but positively affirmed that it was not his intention at the time to do so. He stated, that on the unhappy day when Fisher met his fate, they were going together with a bottle to get some rum, and in passing the paddock, discovered there was a horse there. Worrall said he jumped over the fence on one side, and Fisher on the other, leaving the bottle outside; that then he seized part of the paling, and made a blow which he intended for the horse, and that he did not know of the deed he had committed till his return from the pursuit, when he saw Fisher lying weltering in his blood ; he added, that on seeing this dreadful spectacle he became con- fused, and was afraid if he made any disclo- sure he should be accused of the murder. This induced him to hide the body among some reeds, but his anxiety increased till he had deposited the body where it was eventually found. He also acknowledged that it was his full intention to hang the two men who were apprehended, in order to save himself, but now he acquitted them, or any other, of having any participation in the crime, and, we believe, he acknowledged the justice of his sentence to the Reverend Gentleman who assisted him in his devotions. His behaviour on the scaffold was manly and becoming, and he seemed absorbed in the contemplation of an awful eternity. The Rev. Gentleman at length took his leave —the executioner adjusted the cap—and in a few moments the drop fell—and the world closed upon this murderer for ever.
