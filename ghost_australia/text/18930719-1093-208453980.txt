MR. JOHN N. BIRKS REPLIES. TO THE EDITOR. Sir—lam not surprised atyourcorrespondent, "Huxley's Ghost No. 2,:> adopting the lawyers' motto "No case, abuse the other side." Abuse of myself I do nob trouble about, nor care to reply to, bub whoever it comes from I simply do as the man did to his donkey when" iD kicked him—attribute it to his ignorance. To the charges he and many others make against me, I can only answer as Paul to his judge, "Neither can they prove the things whereof they accuse me." When any deiinito charge is made, then I may attempt to disprove it, but it is impossible to attempt ttiat wi th the indefinite charges hitherto made. Your correspondent reiterates his false accusations against the labor leaders, and adds other random charges absolutely destitute of truth, and I now chal lenge him to name (even behind his shield of anonymity) a single labor leader in South Australia to whom his accusations will in the slightest degree apply. I almost feel as though I ought to apologise to your readers for taking any notice of such a letter, and in any further communication from the same Eource there must be at any rate some small mnriinum of truth and courtesy or I shall de clixie to notice it. -I am, &c.;, JOHN N. BIRKS.
