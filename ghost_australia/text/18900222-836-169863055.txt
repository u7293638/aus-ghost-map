Consider your position, and try to devise an enduring relief of the poverty of your poorr Ij obtain cheap labor to en able you to increase yoar already vast and cprrnn,tini; wealth js your first ooject of .leaire. Matters have been so managed or allowed to drift that you have become as a people the dependent wage-earners of the world. You raise just food enough to feed about one-third of the people, the remaining two-thirds yon must seek by making coods and selling them to other nations. When they restrict or close their markets, or begin to manufacture lor them-elves, you'people begin to. starve, and you must find fresh customers, even at the cannon's mouth, as yon did in India and China, and are doing elsewhere. You are all alike, politicians and patriots,, you get the useless poor out oi your sight, if yon can ? those ofth-tn who may be a useful reserve of cheap la' or you try to retain at home. J£ven your patriot, John Bright, died worth £700,000 his share of the firm's wealth. How many of his work men died worth £7, or had 7s. for their portion when they were passed service ! I remember some years ago when a dispute arose' with the . Slights' workmen, John was sent to reason with the men. He showed from their wages' 'aheet that in the course of years, 20 or 30 1 think, the wages of someof their worken had risen from 9s. to.Hs. a week, whilst food by means of freetrade, bad been greatly cheapened. Now there the Brights had it, cheap food and cheap labor— still after many years. ? But John Bright', purpose was to content the workmen wnose poBition had been ao magniScently improved that, Instead of, 9s. a week, they had 14s.; to. maintain themselves and their wives and families. How would John have managed with his wife and family on that large rum a week ! If the working men of Australia will observe whab even a working man's friend iu England ' considered enough for his less wealthy friends of the working classes, and compare it with their own earnings here, they will see what the Engl'sh aristocracy and middle clauses would willingly see them re duccd.to, if they couM put away out of their sigbfc for a time and throw on the industry of Australia the hideous reality of hungor «hich isdaiy around them, whilst they then-reives surfeit and waste the surplus wealth filched from the toiling millions of their conn ryinrn. Now, there are good and noble men of sll classes in Great Britain and Ireland who have a. tine .sympathy with their working brethren of the operative classes. The' toilers are striving to help themselves to obtain a fair share of the proceeds of industry. The struggle, as it is carried on. may lead to di stinction.' Mediators have been found in a few instances, but still no permanent remedial in tervention has been ausgested' or. adopted. The statesmen of Eneland meanwhile, urn engaged fa party fights, in straggles for place in helping the Egyptain .laborers, and still more, in relieving the Egyptian bondsmen tint is the gentlemen if ho hoi. I, but do not bear Egyptian bonds. Shekels not shackles are at the bottom of their Egyptian sympathies. They are also busy in converting the Negro, not to Chiistanity, but. into new markots for. loaded cottons and -Bilks, and rum'and beer, both loaded, too, I grievously. suspect — and Birmingham-made goods of the cheaper and baser metals of the earth. Now the politicians, priests, parsons, Vmeenisters,' and .self-dubbed patriots of England, have lately turned their attention to free Aus tralia. Their object is to ritMhe links that bind os. to the happy order of things, which they. have to -rule, over in' I Great Britain, Ireland,' and India, where huager is king an 4 emperor. The country frop which/ under aristocratic rule,- the.bitter i iT i-[ iilllti i and starvation has risf n for centuries, wmch has held Ireland in continual poverty and hunger, accented by occasional famines for 700 years, ?which has had 10 famines in India within 110 years, is now urged to come forth to keep under hor perpetual rule the free men of Aus ?tralasie. And, by whom is this proposed ? Those who lead are Lord Kosebery, an ex Minister of the Crown and chairman of the London County Council, within whose juris diction that enormons mass of hungry children and wretched parents barely exist ; and Lord Carnarvon, an ex-Minister of the Crown, and Uie Lord-Lieutenant of Ireland, a large land monopolist in Wett Australia ; and Cardinal Maoniog has lately joined the league. In ?teadof directing 'their .ability, energy, and Jen wledge of affairs to the work of humauity and statesmanship, which lies before them and. kt, their doors, these gentlemen have started in. pursuit of so-called imperial federation, a' phantom, with less of lubs'anee behind it than Potter's, famous ghost. . Let these men reflect upon.a.piecedent fumi.hed by one of the greatest rulers pf men, the ruler of the Chris. ti(ai world in bis day. it is written of. him ,thaji when he [Gregory the Great) was told ono day^bat a. solitary unknown beggar had been /ound'dead from starvation in . the. streeur of Rome, -he- oxcommunicated himself fur having allowed such a thing to happen in a city under hi* rule.'. For days he abstained from com msnion, shutting himself up' in his silent cell, to make atonement by clears and penance for .his sin of omission towards' ihs.t poor starve): -ing. Bat this Christian prince dM not believe in-' thVsurvival of the fittest,' or the ' unre jitrlcted- play of; competition,'* or in any of the fine-spun theories an-i phrases of the gospel of selfishness as rulers of human life, uyijso oitcn to .'sooth men's/ consciences ' for allowing their fellow-men,- woniea,, and chil. dren to suffer and even to perish of hunger. Be was not afraid of pauperis'ng.the P'ople, as we are.' Are they not M vast numbers already pauperised 'almost;, beyond'., redemp tion ! .To yoor work. ia: j onr own country then,- my loros and mjf fora -cardiiia1; and leave us to ours to avert,' jlijt may be, the evil* of s'arvation hero, . Leave us to try to keep, away the hunger- flendt- froro the chil dren of, our fair'; land ssd; to x*M* strong, brave, 'and powerful nation 'haviSs^n ample range of duty in thlt mw; sphere of action, where w.s nay ktep the peace snd follow, in dustev and:ths arts,' and perfect freedom and the noblest'works of oar race. What Austra JJads desire and will. maintain is the ituht tp develop their national life, as tbsy will, unfettered by restrictions .from abroad, or from any external authority. Kow, what aro the purposes of the league, wbloh betrs the aUurd aams o{ 'Imperial Federation,'', and which is, as .yet, regarded wilh indifTertnoe ab'd contempt by, Australians ! This is Lord Rosebery's account of if: 'Numbers of our critics hare sai3, ' Your aspirations arc all very well, but maokind'doM not fatten on aspir ation*, and we would re greatly gratified if you* would givo us some Information or how you propose to y»ny your aspirations Into effect.' how, geBtleioeo, we havo always re»ls'edany eooh demand; We hare always fait there were great reasons againit tho adoption of any ?peofBo plaa by f the Imperial Federation Ceague.

Bat tbe Privy Council is a body which does no4 lend itself readily to the induaah of a represent taive eTcment, and it wou d require as much modelling to introlnce a really representative colonial element, as cither of tbe .other two bodies I hive mentioned., A fourth party has thought that a ZoUvereih or Customs, oulon, by which we should' be gnarded by » protect ive system'from the products of all other countries, would offer ? the best) method of consolidating the empire. But that is not a practical way of consolidating the empire. If it ever becomes practicable, ft will only be in years to come. The doctrines of freetrade' are far too deeply nuted in this country to leave hope far any general assent to such pro posals as those to which I have alluded. Well, ?n spite. of this attitude on the .part of the Imperial Federation League, they have at last come to the conclusion, to which I confess I came some time ago, as to the practical and real ? form of imperial federation. I, have always held ? that imperial federation was really inaugurated by the colonial conference that took place in 1887.'- His lordship very truly a-ids, ' If no close scheme comes out of these conferences, .and, indeed, if- these con ferences themselves aro found to be of no avail and come to nothing,; then you may be per. fecHycertain that, whatever your views may be or yonr exertions may be, imperial feder ation in any form is an impossible dieam.' And so may it be. ... ' ? ? [to be prAmruiD.]
