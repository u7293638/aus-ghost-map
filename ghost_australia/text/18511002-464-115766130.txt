SUPPOSED CAUSES OF 'THE PAPAL AGGRESSION.' A statement has been presented to the Protestant Bishop of Glouceeter and Bristol, by twenty-four of the Clergy of his diocese, in which they set forth what they conceive to be ' the real causes of the Papal aggres sion.' The chief cause they find in the fact that in some measure ' the Episcopate and parochial Clergy have lost that hold on the affections and respect of the people which thev ouaht to have, and which thev nnn« possessed.' Among the causes, of tbi3 'unhappy change' in the feelings of the people, they mention a lamentable in difference during almost a century and a half', on the part of the parochial Clergy,- to the sacred trust committed to them f the mercenary views and simoniaeal disposal of Church' preferment; laxity in regard to letters testimonial ; the decay of Ecclesiastical discipline ; a want of systematic1 and distinc tive education for the' Clerical office ; the consequent inefficiency of public teaching; service; the decay of Cathedral institutions, and the anomalous position of the Cathedral Clergy ; the inadequacy of the number of the Episcopate, and its isolation from the laity, and even the Clergy ; the vicious principle of government appointments to the Episcopal, and the suppression of the powers of Episcopal confirmation ; the infrequency of parochial confirmation ; the absence of spirituality and discipline. from visitations; the facility of admission to Holy Orders ; the divisions in the Episcopate itself; the want of uniformity in the determination1 or rubical questions. Notwithstanding all elusion, we desire solemnly to declare that, while thus deploring the evils that exist in our own Church, we have no wish to exaggerate them, or to forget that other Churches are suffering under other and greater evils. We believe that the Church of England has neither added to the truth of God, nor taken from it; and that, if she were but allowed to carry out the principles of her formularies, she would present to the world a real (though it may bean fm perfect) likeness of the Primitive Church, as it first rose into life at the decent of the tioly Ghost; a more real likeness of it, we would venture to affirm, than with one exception) any Church now existing on earth.'— John Bull.
