MELBOURNE. (PCOlt QUE own OOnBESPONBENT.) Saturday. xno evidence given to-day before the city coroner was insufficient to clear up the mystery attending the death of Bichard Bale, quartermaster of the R.M.S. Borne. The body of deceased, who was 35 years old, was found floating in the bay alongside the ship yestorday morning. The evi dence, however, showed that the de ceased was seen on Thursday night at Port Melbourne under the influence of liquor, and it is surmised that while trying to board the vessel he fell over board and was drowned. The jury simply returned an open verdict. Some idiotic individual has been playing the ghost in the Essendon district, and the apparition is causing nearly as much alarm as tho Warr narubool firo fiend. He has a skull and cross hones emblazoned phosphorus on a white ground, and this is exhibited in lonely places to old people and children. All sorts of traps have been sot for him, hut he has succeeded in eluding tho vigilance of his would-be captors, and one or two, who have essayed to tackle him single handed have had rather a bad time of it. (The vigilance of the inhabitants of tho district has evidently not gone, far enough.) - - A vigorous effort is to be made by the Labor party to secure representa tion in the municipal councils, as it is recognised that it is only by this means there is a chance of a minimum rate of wage being obtained. It is even contemplated to .attempt to capture the seat in the .city council vacated by Aldorman Stewart, and Mr Barrett, secretary of . the Trades Hall, is mentioned as a likely candi date. - » • Esling scored, another win in the chess tournament this aftoruoon. Ho has "now ""two games to' his credit against three wqn by "Wallace.- The game played-this-afternoon was tho .one partly played last week, and although the Victorian was considered to - have much the stronger position, the Sydney man died hard, and -did not succumb until 5 o'clock.
