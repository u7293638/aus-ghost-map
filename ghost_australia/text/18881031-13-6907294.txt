CANON POTTER ON ROBERT ELSMERE." The following sermon was preached by the Rev. Canon Potter, on Sunday, October 21, at Trinity College Chapel The text was taken from 1 Ihess v 21, "Prove all things, hold fast that which is good " These are not thenordsotanineteenthcen tury philosopher, nor of a sceptical critic, nor of a popular novelist with an Anti Christian , purpose And yet, only that no know them ; so well, he might, perhaps, have thought that they were the words of such a one-for they teach the very lesson which those philosophers, critics, and novelists think that we need so much, for they are always taking for granted that he prove nothing, but that one swallow everything whole Lue not only a ere the words before us not written in the nineteenth century, but they were actually written in the first century, when, according to our critics, the products of the human mind were hill childish -when marvels. were believed all the more easily because they were marvels, and so the Christian miracles, and especially the miracle of the Resurrection were accepted as matter of course, on little evidence or none. Not only so, but the were a before us here victoria) written by a man who himself Observed that he had seen and spoken with Jesus of Nazareth after His death and resurrection, w o stated plainly) in a document whose authenticity no critic doubts (1 Corin think) that not only he but several others (as in me) as 500 at once most of whom were still alive},bud also seen Jesus after His death and resurrection And the most noteworthy point of all is that this very St Paul, as we all know, and as nobody) ventures to deny, is a bitter op patient of the very name of Jesus until the time when he say that he saw him and spoke with Hun, and that ever after he was an active and faithful Christian spending his life, enduring man) suffering, and at last meeting his death, in the endeavour to win men to the same belief in Jesus to which he had been won himself This is the man who tells us to prove all alleged. Weare so familiar however with the his tory of ht Paul that we are apt to lose a good deal of the force of ii w herons a history like it, even if the facts be in the reverse order, provided we are not familiar with it, will strike us more of forcibly We read, for example, not in fact, but in fiction, of an amiable and hardworking clergyman who came to believe that Jesus did not rise, and who gave up his living in consequence, as an honest man should, and who spent the rest of his life, and met with his death, in the endeavour to preach in Christ who had not risen, and to do the best he could with the Gospel so shorn of its power, and as we read our interest is deeply kindled by the novel picture. And when the writer of the story in her own person, or in the person of some of her characters, invites us to be honest and to prove all things, and to throw over what we emit prove, some of us are perhaps ready to take her seriously And when fell) down her book we began to feet, or some of us begin to feel, as it Mrs W Ward and the Germans and the a streets' were too many for us, just as the Squire was too many for poor I Ismere and we are, it may be, ready to confess that we shall have to lay aside our faith in a risen Christ, and try to do our best, as he did with it Christ who has not risen. Before YIP law in) such conclusion, however, from this painful and interesting picture of the nineteenth century, let us just set over against it this other picture of the first cell tur), which is not fiction at all but action ledged fact This picture of one who tells us also that we ought to move all things, and who, before he said, had gone through an experience just the reverse of nostrils mere li we wish to know what sort of effect the conversion of St Paul, and the subsequent events of his life may have had upon his contemporaries, let us try to estimate the effect which the like events happening in our own days would produce upon ourselves Let us suppose them to have happened to some notable and Christian leader amongst our own contemporaries Suppose, for example, that Mr Herbert Spencer should suddenly become a devout Christian, suppose him to be taking every opportunity to speak and write in support of his newly attained convictions, defending and expounding the doctrines of the 1 author hood of God and the eternal Sonship of Christ, the Incarnation and the Resurrection preaching, like St Paul, every where the faith of which he tried once to make havoc, and writing throughout with the same force, the flame, deliberation, and perhaps also with the same characteristic limits of style and reasoning OF before And suppose- him.further.publiclv to allege that his change of belief was due to the fact that he had seen and spoken with Jesus Him self, and not only so, but that he knew several other people who were still alive, and might be consulted, who had seen and spoken with Jesus race, not one li) reticent), but as many as DUO at a time Suppose Mr Herbert Spencer togo all over the world affirming all this openly, and with much persistent repetition, and suppose him to be frequently hooted and pelted by most of roughs, and put in gaol for preaching in the streets, and, last of all, put to death with torture in some Mohumuieduii country for the testimony of Jesus All that would be nothing more than a repetition in the nineteenth century of what actually happened in the first Well, now what want- we think of all that if we find in Mr Herbert Spencer's works an in junction to prove all things, what would we suppose that his conversion and the subsequent events of his life and his death proved Would we believe that he had really seen and

the whole universe of being, was just the same as any man's, then His was an niiouiuloiis event. But it the relation of Jesus to the whole universe of being was" unique, then it is no longer incredible either that he should rise trout the dead, or that He should raise others. Now, such a unique relation Jesus asserts for himself, and He asserts it through the spiritual world. He claims to have assumed humanity in order to reveal to men the luna of the spiritual world. Grant that chum and you have a condition in virtue of which the Resurrection of Jesus is co-ordinated with till the facts and events we know. Grant that dunn and the resurrection of Jesus instead of being contradictory in law and inconsistent with order, exhibits the presence til a bullet older mind of a deeper law. But why believe in any spiritual world at all.' 'Unit question is not raised, indeed, by the book before us. But it is not every one that can stop like Robert Elsmere half-way down an inclined plain. Most men who begin by questioning the Resurrection of Jesus, go on to nil; u there be not) God at all or any soul in man. So we must put the question why, first of all, do we believe in a spiritual world? Because we have the evidence within our selves. If you know anything at all you know that yourself lists, and that your eel! is not your body. Van know that your body is inn state otcoBBUnt change, and) on know that yourself the same all through these changes-) es, and through deeper charges for thought and will change as well as flesh and blood. But every act, either of thought or will, implies the self who thinks and wills, who is not to be confounded with thought and will any more than with flesh and blood, but without whom neither thought nor will is conceivable. That sell is the witness in each man of the spiritual world. And from his knowledge of his own sell, he comes to know of other selves like his own, and from these two kinds of knowledge compared He rises to the knowledge of the one sell on whom all depends all thought and life and feeling, that One "labour delivered move, and have our being." And with this kind of knowledge comes a movement upward, an aspiration alter God, an endeavour to live in the law of (June. And it is the chum of Jesus that He comes to annals iLmt aspiration, and to interpret that law for us, and so to exhibit in one perfect unity the whole universe of Berman it that claim is admitted Chriat'á"posit¡oñ is unique, there is none to be compared with it, his the bond which binds all together and makeshift one. And without such a tions, what after all becomes at all our efforts to establish that uniformity which we cannot but believe in. Without that bond the most we can discover, or hope to discover, is material uniformity, amidst moral and intellectual anomalies of the most bustling and perplexing kind. But grant once the bond of union which the claim of Jesus asserts, and then till such anomalies begin to dis- appear, because the law which explains the HILLS to be innniie'steil. li in him we see the meeting point between the spiritual and the material ; it in Ihm we see the union of the finite and the infinite, and li flesh of the human body which He has taken, " I have power to lay it down and I have power to take it again," there is noting in- tremulously u chum so made. But now, says this writer and others with her, we must reject the Resurrection because it is not in accordance with thereupon rule ota/iriie»if, which has been the appointed instrument of man's training since his and thought began." It is most undoubtedly true that God teaches us by experience, and if experience is to teach us, there must be a law of um. formity in it. but surely no one will say that the materiality of experience is always obvious. On the contrary, the way in which we learn most from experience is by the endeavour to discover a uniformity which is not obvious, and when we have discovered it, then the lesson is learnt. Look at any of the great discoveries of science, and you will find that it was brought about by union deavour to detect it uniformity which was not obvious, and which experience seemed to contradict. The a resurrection of Jesus, when we study it Hist, startles us by its apparent inconsistency with the uniform rule of experience. But when we come to see in Jesus God submitting himself to the conditions of his- ' merit) and lifting humanity with Him out 11 those conditions then she Resurrection of Jesus exhibits in our view a deeper an I wider uniformity than ever he could have dreamt of before How did the Resurrection come to be be bevel looks like this one say) Oh you I now how an) ghost story) comes to be believed Yes we do and he know also the sort of belief that is given to such stones s.
