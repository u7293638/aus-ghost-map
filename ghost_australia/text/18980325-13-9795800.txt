A ROUNDING SPECTRE. j AVOCA, AVcdnc-diiv. During the past few days some individual has been playing ghost, appearing at vario- ous places distant from two to four miles from the town. Already the persons have seen the apparition which they report to be of tall stature, clothed in white, and with a long black beard. He issues suddenly from the darkness, and disappears by means of tremendous leaps and hounds. He is said to jump fences with the greatest of ease. Latterly travellers by the roads in the neighbourhood referred to have taken to carrying firearms with a view of getting a shot at the spectre, but so far no chance has occurred.
