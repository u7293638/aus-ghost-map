AhCJlJEULOOY IN INDIA. From the Globe.) Mr. ConBons'8 progress report of the last operations of of the Arcluuolegy Survey of WA on ern India I resents a number of features of more than usual interest (says the 1 times of India) The work of the season 1889-90 was confined to North Guserat with the object of completing the survey begun in 1936-37 of the archaeological remains in the backyards territory , but in addition to this a detour was made in order to embrace old Buddhist cave recently discovered at IVidsarand Karumba, on the south side of the Bombay Harbour, of which Mr C-OUSCUB Lives a very interesting des ription Palanporo was chosen as the start- ing point of the tour, in order that some additional photographs might be obtained for Dr Burgess for the coming volume on the archaeological remains in that city From Palanporo the party proceeded to Robe, where they found an old stop-work constructed of white marble and bearing a Sanskrit in turn] tion Hard by woo found the ruins of a white in fruit Jam temple, in the vicinity of which is a railway bungalow, into whose outer gateway some old temple columns have been built The material of the temple itself appear to have been carted away by a Goth of a contractor for rails 05 purposes which was the fate also of the ruins at Chand revue At Socotra, four and a half miles away are the ruins of another Jam temple, of which the principal shrine is still standing At Chandra sti, 15 miles north-east of Robe, and almost at the foot of Mount Abu, scarcely anything remains of its early grandeur but a solitary white marble column In all the site was singularly rich in memorials of the dear old days when the marble city Mrttchcd over the plain Afterwards the railway line, and even now beneath the railway bridge may be seen more than 100 cartloads of sculptured fragments and images Bits of the old city will Bills remain but of that magnificent temple described by Sir Charles Colville 60 years ago, and of the 138 images which then adorned it, not a trace exists except in the shape of desecrated and unrecognisable fragments At Bbiln, where the pair had heard of old remains, it was found not only that the temple was no longer in existence, but that its very foundations had been dug out and converted into time, this was found to be the case also at Mundotta and Remains, at both of which places temples were known to have existed At Iiassara, a very old triple shrined team to, dedicated to live Brahma and Vishnu was found. It had once been covered with sculpture, which bore marks of having been maliciously defaced from Diltuat the party journeyed via Waghol to Mougpur through the lassie ground embracing Sankosnr, Punchasur, A wood, end Chander, all rich in legendary lore of the rise of the Cbaurn and blank day castles and the early days of Guzerat history Rich as the country is here in memories, however, the landscape is bare and dreary to 0 degree Nothing breaks the monotony but an occasional flat and dumped hamlet water is scarce and, for the most part, heavily charged, wherever found, with saltpetre, and there is hardly a tree to be seen as far as the eye can reach The phenomenon of the mirage is seen bore to perfection Far away in the distance the great illusory sheet of water shimmers in the hot air, and recedes further and further from the traveller as he advances, resolving itself eventually into misty vapour rising out of the salt plain. lorfiovcral months in the year the extraction of saltpetre is a regular industry hero At Mungpur the only notable relic of earlier days is an old Jama Masjid, which appears to have been con- strue ed out of the materials of still older Hindoo or Jam temples It Lotcsvara, two miles to the east, is a curious well, made in the shape of a Greek cross A fair is held on its margin every year, and it is a noted resort for pilgrims At Sankesvara, an old seat of the Jams, there still remains the courtyard of an old temple, which itself has entirely disappeared, and the brickwork still shows traces of the most delicate geometric patterns, traced on the plaster while still wet At Panchasur, where ' Jye Shoker" was besieged by the army of King Bhuvar 1100 years ago nothing remains of the olden glories but a shabby little shrine which Mr Cousens does not credit with even the ghost of a claim to genuine antiquity Local legend has it that this shrine marks the spot where four of " Jye Blacker's " queens, with the ladies of his court fell upon his funeral pyre and were consumed with him The Village is a modern one of 500 souls, and to the eastward of 11 are a number of prout mounds, 20ft and 30ft high, which would have delighted the heart of the Golden Dustman, they are constructed from the village refuse of centuries At Mandal, where the landscape changes to a shady country with tamarind groves, there is little of note beyond the ruins of some old MueBulnmn temples "A Grainger, next halting-place of Mr COUSOOB'S camps mainly celebrated for its great multi 1 moral rank, the Many Samovar supposed to have been built by feels Raj, and covering an acre and a half of ground Around it were originally DOO free standing shrines, of which 337 only are now left From S ironigam the party went to the odour, where they accomplished the most interesting work of the whole journey-the examination of the old Buddhist cave discovered last December by the Rev J Abbott of the Mahratta Mission, Bombay. Mr Abbott found two groups of caves, one near Karsambla and the other and more extensive group at Isadanr 1 These latter are 16 in number, and are excavated in a long line of cliff looking west on the side of a spur of the grants two miles east of the village the approach is very difficult, and in some cases the interiors have been almost destroyed by the crumbling of a stratum of old red rock (sandstone r) running horizontally through them In one of the caves-No 3,moasnnng 54ft by 20ft Mr Cousens found six rock-cod dragoons They contained dried rice husk and grey ash, but nothing else The largest cave 16 No 7, which measures 48ft 6in by 19ft, and is 11ft high The whole front of the back wall, and parts of the side walls, are decorated with the charges arch and rail and other moulding. Between the cell doors are shallow arches surmounted by a large arch, with a representation of arched Screen work I tanking each arch, and joining its haunches with the adjacent window and door, is a broad band of Buddhist rail Upon this, at intervals, land strutB supporting another moulding above, composed of a series of flat triangles joined in a row, corner to corner, with their sides cut into stops Above the cell doors are sculptured different devices Two have Gala Laiehmi, two have a little lagoon flanked by two little arches, another has three arches in a line, another a large ino hooded serpent whose voluminous folds extend over the adjacent window The widows are all filled with stone lattice- work in different designs One is an imitation of the Buddhist rail, while others are plain cross-barred at right angles, others are filled with cross bars, leaving larger openings which are once filled with two transverse bars like a St Andrew's Cross, while some are interlaced across one another like a bamboo trellis All the doorways have been provided with wooden frames and doors Among the few small sculptured figures in bas relief on the walls are men and women, a lion, an elephant, and two bulls, In addition to those ever the doors There is not, however, a single image of Buddha In the centre of the ceiling of the hall is sculptured in very low relief a lotus, surrounded by numerous buds and leaves, the whole designed to form a medallion or rosette Around the cave, and upon which the cell doors stand, is a raised bench The walls of the cave, and even of those of the cells, have had a thin coat- ing of plaster, similar to those at Ajuntn, and have been painted in various designs and colours, only small fragments of which now remain Upon a panel beside one of the cell doors is a short inscription in the old cave character This has not yet been deciphered There is little of note in any of the other caves in this group with the exception of INO 15, 20ft by 14ft, which contains the only sculp- ture in the caves-a pair of figures, male and female, him high, which are represented standing on a large fish having the proper head, tail, fins, and body of a fish, in place of the commonly occurring makers The costume of the figures is similar to that of those at Kurll, and the woman holds a water-pot with a spout and handle, while the members a cup from which no appears to be about to drink In the other group of caves, those at Karaambla, there is a total absence of all ornament, nor could any discusses be discovered.
