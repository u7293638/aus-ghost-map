CONSECRATION OF THE NEW BURIAL GROUND AT LYMING TON. [From a Correspondent.] On Wednesday last, the 14th instant, many persons of this and adjoining locali ties were attracted to the above township, to witness the ceremony of consecration of the new burial ground presented to the parish by James Cox, Esquire, of Claren don, who, besides, has built and endowed the chapel and school to which the above burial-ground is attached. The introductory service was commenced in the chapel by the Chaplain (the Rev. W. Brickwood), followed by the Very Rev. Archdeacon Reibey, assisted by Miss Cox at the harmonium, and a respectable choral company. The usual requisition was then presented and read by the Arch deacon, signed by the surrounding resi dents; whereupon the Bishop rose and delivered a most impressive address, re minding his hearers that it was not merely a formal ceremony, but that it also should tend to imply a recognition by its visitors of their Christian obligations: that in the words of St. Paul, the bodies of each one were also a temple of the Holy Ghost dedicated to the service of God, and im pressing the importance of the observance in fulfilling their duty both to God, their fellow beings, and the rising generation; and also their awful responsibility in neg lecting the same. The congregation then proceeded to the cemetery, where prayer was again offered. The requisition was again read and signed by the Bishop, confirming the dedication of the burial ground. Part of the 39th Psalm was sung by the congregation and children, who had numerously assembled for the occasion; after which the Bishop pronounced the benediction, and the as sembled friends of early Christian educa tion retired highly delighted.
