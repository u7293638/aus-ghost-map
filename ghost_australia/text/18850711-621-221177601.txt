POETRY. 1 Shoulder to Shoulder f Shoulder to shoulder ! That's royal, that's rational 1 Strange frere it otherwise, strange as inglorious. No. in a cause that is common, ia national, Union is prelude to battle victorious. This is no moment for partisan rivalry. Englishmen know what is due to the day. Connadeehip true in the spirft of chivalry, Shoulder to shoulder, at bay. Out on the firebrands of faction who'd fulminate Each against each when the storm clouds seem gathering. Peace T ar the wrath of the nation will culminate, Dealing swift doom to your pitif ul blathering. Patriot now will forget to be partisan Where or ia what garb soever he stand, Noble oc citizen, rustic or artisan, Each has his place in "the band. Band, for unless we are phalanxed unitedly How shall we prove the old flag still uutakable How shall we fare with the foe who delightedly Looks on a rift where cur walls may be shakable? Valour may keep th#-m inviolate verily, Ay, but lest valour alone should be vain, Close up the ranks, Britons, bravely and cheeriiy, Shoulder to shoulder again ! And if our leaders, who.serry the ranks of us, h Honour the pest and wouid not be kick-d out of it, Wish not the fame-killing scorn but the thanks of us, They— let them harbour no ghost of a doubt of it— They too must stand in the vanguard fraternally, Under the flag, unking feuds of the past ; Stand — 't s our watchword iu war-time eternally — Shoulder to shoulder at latt 1 —London Punch.'
