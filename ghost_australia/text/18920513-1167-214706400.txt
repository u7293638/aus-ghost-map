For lo ! the very stars are gone. Brave Admiral, speak 1 what shall I say ?' ' Why, say,' Sail on 1 sail on I and on I'' ' My men grow mutinous day by day ; My men grow ghastly wan and weak.' The stout mate thought of home ; a spray Of salt wave washed his swarthy cheek. ' What shall I say, brave Adm'ral, say, If we sight naught but seas at dawn!'

Ah, that night Of all dark nights I And then a speck— A light 1 A light!
