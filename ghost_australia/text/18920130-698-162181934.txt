Australian Anniversary Regatta. Patrons of these races had the choice of two places from which to view the -various events — Clark Island and the steamship Cintra, which was anchored off Double Bay, The Cintra was gaily . decorated with flags, and was moreover in splendid order, so that she admirably answered the purpose to which she was put. A fleet of small steamers was kent Diving throughout the day between Circular Quay, the island, and the flag ship, and conveyed about 2000 spectators to the island and 800 to the flagship. The committee was indefatigable in looking after the comfort of its patrons. So far as the races were concerned, they were well contested, and were remarkable for the number of capsizes with which they were attended. Something like eight or ten boats encountered the full force of the fresh nor'-easter which prevailed, . and being unable to resist its strength went down. The luncheon, which was held on the Cintra, was attended by the Mayor (Alderman W. P. Manning), and Mr. J. P. Garvan, M.L.A. In connection with this gathering a silver tantalus liquor stand was presented to Captain Hampton on behalf of the committee of the Australian Anniversary Xtegatta.

This, the principal race, was started at 11 minutes post 3, Ghost and Eannanook going off together. Both appeared to hold their own from the others until off Bradley's, when the Ghost sailed away from the Kannonook, -which was quickly being overhauled by the others. Between Brad ley's and the lightsuip Volunteer worked into third position, while Mantura and Susie gained considerably on the others, the last of which being the Booralie. Ghost led by 15 seconds from the Eannanook round the lightship, followed by Volunteer, Our Tom, Mantura, Latona, and Susie, in the order named. Squaresails were 'carried to Shark Island on the Volunteer, Mantura, Latona, and several of the rear boats, .which were hopelessly beaten. Kannanook dropped out of the race near the Sow and Pigs, ?which gave Volunteer second position. The first time round the flagship Ghost led by three lengths from the Volunteer, followed in order by Mantura, Our Tom, Susie, Latona, Enterprise, and Craigalee. All stood over towards Bradley's from the flagship, when Volunteer passed the Ghost and appeared to have the race won. In going about she shipped a quantity of -water, -which impeded her pro gress so much that when the water was pumped the Ghost had a lead of a minute, which she eventually won by after a very exciting race. After the placed boats came the Susie, Latona, and Craigalee. The Port Jackson Handicap, dingies 18ft and 19ffc.
