"A WARNING. WE have been asked to. intimate to the public that the police' aithorities of the districthave xebelved instructions to enforce the Width if Tires 'Act, 1895. Every man is presumably., acquainted with the law, at least to the extent of being aware of when be is infringing any of the provisions. A greater fallacy scarcely exists, and there are few, if any, of the residents of the fieldswho-have' even the ghost of an idea of what is required in accordance with the Act in question as regards .waggone, drays, ,carts, and lorries. For the benefit of the unenlightened we may explain that the Width of Tires Act does not apply to any vehicle intended solely to carry passengers and thatits principle clause reads as follows :-On and iafter first day of May, 1896, no person engaged in building, con structing,. selling or nhaking vehicles shall build, construct ors make, sell pr hire or offer for sale or hire any vehicle unless the width of the tires of such vehicle shall- be in the following proportion to the asle arms of such v~hicle, nathely : When the diameter of the axle armr is 21n, the width'of thetire shall be Sin 24in ,, ,. ,, 4in 2jin ,, ,, 4in Sin , ,, ,, bin. Another clause forbids' the importation of vebhicles unless the tires be of tpie prescribed width. Any person offending against either of the preceding clauses renders himself liable to a penalty ,not exceeding Â£?5... So that no injustice should be done to .the owners of vehicles with tires not of the prescribed width no person can 'be' prose cuted until'after Jinuary 1;:1899;' fol" usihg any such vehicle upon the public roads. Two yers' .grape has thus bene allowed to .enable. those in possesslon of.vehicles that .Io pnot comply with the requirements of the Act to. make. nbcessary arrangeme3ts to meet its,. provisions. 'The toat ds theg'ldfields have been already so'veiy badly cut up that it is' rather late in the day to enforce. tie Act,.' but it is, perhap, bettei lte than ~i pever.
