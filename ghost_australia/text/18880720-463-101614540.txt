POETRY. WHEN THE SOFT TEAS STEALB SILENTLY. When the soft tear steals silently down from thu eye, Take no note uf its course, nor detect the soft sigh ; From some spring of Bliy sorrow its origin flows, Borne tender remembrauoe that weeps as it goes. Ah ! it is not to say what will bring to the mind The sweet joye departed, the friends left behind : A tune, or a song, or the time of the year, Strikes the key of a&ection;, and moans iu the ear. Through the gay scenes of youth the re membrancer strays, Till mem'ry steps back on old pleasures to gaze; Fleeting shadows they seem that glido calmly away, The remains of past hours, and the ghosts of a day. When we set out in life every thing hai- its charms, Enkindles the fancy, and all the heart warms ; Tis this makes us look on the joys thtt are past With an eye that turns coldly to glance on the last Let the tear, then, flow on, nor mark the full eye, 'Tis the suul's secret off'ring no mortal should spy ; Few hearts are prepared for a rite su divine, When the feelings alone sacrifice at the shrine.
