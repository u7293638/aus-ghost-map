NOTANDA. T'icEnE are a good many things in our railway management that are not quit', clear to the average intellect: inter alia, why are the names of stations generally so placed that the light from the gas-lamps does not fall on them, no that they are ioditinguiost. able at night? Con. No. 1.-Why are tihe names of etations placed where passengers cannot coo them, by day or night, until right ti'reast of them, and when there is barely timre t,, jumnpt out ere the train starts agaiu? Would it oot be bleter if they were put in such positi os that at at a distance of say oue or too hundred yardns passengers could seo the name of thu station and gathe r tleir paclages ready to alight? Con. No. â€¢2.-No doubt very many persons have wono di:red why these things are no; but it falls to omy lot to bring them under the notice of thle thousands who read your paper, in the fond hotpe that omrchow the conuntdrums may be brought within rauge of the colnlinio?nuer. The refusal on the ground of expenseo to send a contingent of our men to help Victoria in her cou tenary celebrations in too small nod insular in its nature to commtend itsoll to Auotralians who have anything likn the real union of the colonies at heart. Much " high falutin " iha been indulged in by both colonies as to the wisdom and advantago of federa tiou; but whenever the thing is approachecd in a practical fashion, we vie with our neighbours in the unmallness, the maninues, andti th pettiness of our motives for holding aloof. If the day should arrive, and there are those who think it is not far distant, when thie men of Australasia will be called upon to stald by health and home, it would be a poor policy fotr the difflrcu't colouies to endeavour to assumen an independent position, fighting as separate nations; and such a course could end only in ruin and disaster. Mir. Phil May, the prince of caricaturists and pencil genius of the Bullotin, has qritted Sydney for "fresh wiedo and pastures now," and in him the jonrnal has lost its bust and brightest spirit. About Mr. hMay's sletches there was always a freshuess and vigor combined with a delicacy very refreshing to look uponl. Lifelil;o in his caricatures, they were seldotm if ever offienive, oven when little poculiari tin, would be hit off, so that the subject himself could hardly fail in being amunoied. The bost effort of lbil puncil, " IIarmony," is a particularly happy and telling picture. Her Most Gracious Majesty thei Queen and P'ope Leo are represonted as playing an instrumncutal duet, her Mfajosty attuning the harp of Erin to his liolinesuu' flute, whilst "poor Paddy over. rore," who has rested his " caubeen" on the harp. standu on the left-haud eaorner in a most comical altitude, wholly unable to grasp the situation--a condition by the way shared by both English and. Irish sympathisers with the homo.rulo party. Twenty-soven goutlemon thirsting to serve their country nro said to have offered themselves as a hole. caret on lho altar of the now railway commission. Theor is soinnething exquisitoly touahing in this, especially when we remember that the offices are to be fat and well paid; at the smoo time no one doubts the beautiful disinterestedncss of the patriots who are willing to sacrilioo themolveos. It would, bo interenting, if not impertinent for the publio to be furnished with a list of the would.bo victims, with niames and addresses in full, so that some idea of fituess and qualification might be arrived at. It was once said of our colony " that whastuovr fails ill Noew South Wales, olo licks theo world for brains." Somo pIeople think the substitution of "oheck" would be more voracious it lona poetical. In any event it wotult seem that ihs importing of a man was a super l1uity wli-s wse have the ready-mnade article on hand ill such quantities. Thle frequent interruption of the cable, ospeoil.ly at a period wheu tlio gravest fearn nro entertninod of a Euiropasu complication, go to show tlro urgent. necessity of a duiplicate or double line betwoon Australia and London. The neod of this has boon so lften and so forcibly doemonstrated that no frenls arguments can be used in its favour. Some four or five years sinue the priopriotors of the Evening Nows. in conjunction with Mr. Henniker IHeaton, addressed a meimo. to our government advocating a duplioato line, but withll a better, ehoapor, and safor routo.t The proposal was listened to, some promises made then quietly shlved; sinceo this nothing has beeon done or orven aerinusly oianidered, and inl thbo face of the most tronuendous possibilities we are loft dopunding upon a roundabout method of communica- - lion liable to brealogo and interruption any day. Such is thei wy our rulers avail themoolvos of bthe means sociono has placed at their disposal l I don't oner a solitary dump about thae upar 'natural, for no doulbt Byron was right in dooming. \---- Tlhat sout nld body oi thel whol Are odds nat ainst oul dio n t sotl iod! soil.

You will find that when from evil motives live scoundrols try to panlm themselves off as ghosts, a revolver bllot hasn a wondrousely sonothliug offot on the tronlrlad spirit, and porhaps produces a real ghost, as hamlet would have done if he had boon lot.

The loader in your Saturday'n insue points out some objecrotions t, to the o-callod Property Tax Bill. Allow me to add another.
