Spirited Idea. Suppose that it is a fact, as cortain spiri tualists claim, that spirits aro acquiring tho power to reappear in bodily form, and to converse, to movo, and to act, just as people do who are not doad, won't tlio' consequences to tho com munity bo rathor astounding ? I don't care so much for tlio thontros, for it may bo convoniont to have Shalcospoaro called on to play tho ghost in "Hamlet," and to got somo other obliging goblin to dothoghost.ofBnnquo in "Macbeth," but suppose, for instanco, tho Democrats in Danb.ury think tliey aro going to run a little short of votos in nil oloction, what is to provont a Domocrntic medium from swooping a drag not through purgatory and snatching out six or sovon hundred dopartod votors. And then siipposo ono of tlioso materi alised ghosts should innko up his mind to beconio a candidate ? All the otlior spoctres -would support him, and ho im'irlif. 1m nlnntnil. flnnrrrn Wnsliin/rfnTi under such circumstances, might run again for tho Presidency, and then wo might have all tlio cemeteries unloading, and all the old politicans that liavo beon resting under tho sod for agos, coming out and striking for fat jobs and sinccuro offices. Politics will bo mournful for tho living statesmen wlion the dead ones begin to hop about. And, besides, , think of tho condition of a man who hns his third or fourth wifo, when his provlous spouses begin to to materialise and como homo again, won't domostic affairs in such a family bocomo animating and oxcitiug undor tho circumstances ? And how agonising it will bo for tho heirs if rich fathers who are dead como around again nnd tako cliargo of their property ! Tlio prospect that opon up as wo contem plate tho consequences of this, materi alisation business is simply awful. Whon a man is onco ronlly dead; lio ought to bocompollodto stay doad until tho earth comes to an end. â€” American Paper.
