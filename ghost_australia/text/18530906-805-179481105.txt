No less than an odious leprosy will humble Nauruan; wherefore by it the only wise God thought meet to alky the valour, dignity, renown, and victories of that famous general of the Syrians, Wc often sec nothing carries us so far from God as those favours he hath imparted to us. Many shall one day repent that they were happy too soon. Many a man cries out, ‘ Oh, that 1 were so rich, so health ful, so quiet, so happy!’ Alas! though thou hndst thy wish for the present, thou shouldest, perhaps, bo a loser in the end. In this life mercy and misery, grief and peace, good and bad, are'blended one with the other, because if we should have nothing hut comfort, earth would he thought heaven.” “ How can he be miserable that hath Christ and all his merits made sure to him; that hath his name written in heaven, yea, that is already in heaven; for where our desires are there ourselves arc. The heavenly-minded live not so much where they live as where they love; that is to say, in Christ. Surely his soul must be brimful of brave thoughts that is able to refresh himself with this meditation—‘God is my father; Christ, the judge, my elder brother; the Holy Ghost my com forter; the angels mine attendance; all the crea tures mine for use; the stock of the Church’s prayers, mine for benefit; the world mine inn; heaven my home. God' is always with me, before roc, within me, overseeing me; I talk with him in prayer, he with me in his Word.’ Sure, if these be onr accustomed thoughts, it cannot but make us happy.”
