At the Bijou. Under the business management of Mr. "Tlrof. Kennedy, tbe Victorian Ope ratic Society has, during the present Eastertide, been presenting Wallace's popular opera, Man tana. me so ciety is all the more deserving of praise in that it is devoting its best efforts 10 augment tbe funds of the Ghttdren's Hospital. This is the sea son of tbe rear, too. at which a Chris tian community can most pertinently have its attention called to the needs of those little ones a helping hand to whom, the world has Christ's assur ance, was also as a helping band to Him. Every care has been taken iu the production of " Maritatia "—an opera tbe harking back to the first production of which iu Victoria cou- jurfc up ghosts of the past in serried ranks— the various roles are capitally filled ; and the whole affair is well managed. Those who delight in the many beauties of Vincent Wallace's work, and who also desire to show th»tir charity, have but two more nights in which to do both.
