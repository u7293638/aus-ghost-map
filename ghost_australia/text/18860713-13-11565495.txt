THE JOURNAL OF THE PRINCES. THE CRUISE OF THE BACCHANTE AUSTRALIAN NOTICES The other day we heard by cable message of the publication of the record of the round voyage made in 1879 1882, by Prince Albert Victor and Prince George o£ Wales. The volumes themselves have now come to hand. They are two bulky tomes, each of nearly 700 pages, well furnished with engravings and with charts, and brought out in the best style as regards paper and binding, by the firm of Messrs. McMillan and Co. The volumes are what they pretend to be- namely, records of travel, and of course, they derive much of their interest from their writers. The style is simple and unpretentious. There are a good many boyish passages, but there is also a surprising mass of solid information in the pages. It was made, it appears, a part of the duty of the young princes to seek information at each port about the place and the people, and they had only to ask to have a store of facts and anecdotes poured upon them, and every part, we are told, has been carefully revised by ex- perts as to facts and figures. The Princes saw a great deal of the world-the West Indies, South America, the Cape, Japan, China, Egypt, the Méditer ranean, A.c. and it is apparent that the place they were most taken with was Australia. The references to these colonies are throughout of the most friendly nature, and graduallj-after other scenes have been visited-they become loving m tone until, on the eve of their londing in Great Britain, the two princes make a joint declaration that, next to England, Australia will ever remain nearest to their hearts Why the voyage was undertaken, and how the book was written, are fully stated in the preface by the Rev John N Dalton, and the few pages in question are so excellent a tésumi of the work as a whole that it ia well to reproduce them. 1 his account of the three years' cruise of H M b Bacchante makes no pretension to literary form buch as it ia, it has been put together at the desire of their Royal High- nesses the Prince and Princess of Wales, who have intrusted the private journals, letters, and other papers of their Bona to me for this purpose 1 hough three j ears have gone by Binee the ship was paid off, it is only within the last lew months that I have been free, or lind leisure to arrange the material tor publication Both princes kept very regular diaries all the time they vv ere away from home , these, written up every evening before turning in, both at sea and ashore, wherever they happened to be staying-whether it waa be neath the roof ot different Government houses or out in the bush, on the Pampas, ni Japanese temples, or Chinese house bouts, whether up the Nile, or beneath their tenta in byria, form naturally the ground work ol the whole. As might nuturally be expected, their pages become much fuller towards the end of the three >curs than thev are at the beginning 'lhose portions especially which cover the time the Princes were in 1 g) pt and Palestine were written out afterwards from rough jottings and notes made on horseback, or during the midday siesta, from what lirugseh Bey or Captain Conder had been telling them when ince to face with the objects visited I have also eira» n largely upon the contents of letters These were often written aynnst time and m haste to catch the mail But suth pussa"es aa 1 have extracted from them I have thought it best to leuve ua they were first penned, however rough they might appear, rather than smooth them down in cold blood , for thus they convey a truer representation ot the immediate impression produced by the place or cirenmstunce de Bcribed \\\ lth the private journals and letters that record the passing sensation of the day or hour, I have embodied a good deal from cer- tain note books in which the Princes entered at their leisure the substance of much which they read concerning the countries visited, or learnt in conversation from those with whom they were specially privileged to be bi ought into contact from time to time. Where Buch entries refer to figures and stn tistics 1 have endeavoured to correct them up to date It would be absurd to imagine that two young men of their respective ages should take in fully all the information given respecting the various places and people the) Buw, as older persons might have done But as these pages will testit), several clear nn pressions were produced on their minds nt euch port, windi will remain, till their d)ing da) , ona foremost among these is the vivid remembrance of Nvhat they saw in Australia, where the interest they evinced in different matters connected with the political and commercial development of that portion of a united and greater Britain was most keen My ovn additions are marked off in Bquare brackets Ihey can readil) be skipped by those who prêter to rend continuously the more descriptive narrative portion ot the tevt.

It wiH be admitted that there could be no better training for the young Pnncea than this discipline and seclusion at sea, alternated by excursiona ashore, which were bonnd to have a great educational effect upon minda at the inquiring and impressionable Btage As our readere will be anxious to arrive at Australia it is unnecessary to accompany the Princes to Barbadoes, or Jamaica, or the Bermudas, or to the Plate, which is called a " South American Australia, ' especially as Mr Dalton Bays the earlier notes of the Princes are of the least value Of the Cape a full account ia given, but upon this occasion we shall also skip that On the voyage from the Cape an accident occurred to the Bacchante In the "roaring forties' the ships company found that their vessel could roll more than a little bit The adventures commenced on April 10,188L "This night we rolled more than we have ever done since we have been m commission All sorts of things were carried away in the cabin, amongst others a stanchion of one of the cots, which sent George rolling on the deck, amid other things that bad fetched away 'something has happened, and a good deal of laughter, were the first sounds that were heard after the crash So no great harm was done ' On April 29 there ia the record -"Rolling heavily, which ia very tr}ing to the temper, cannot read or write, stand, or sit comfort ably Two of the wardroom officers, when walking on the upper deck, went over into the lee scuppers , one broke bia rib, the other damaged his eye It was in the same roll that the port cutter touched water When sitting at meals your chair baa to be lashed to the leg of the table, and you bave to hold the plate in one hand and feed with the other Nothing will re main, anyhow, on the table. In the gun room mess we have now only three cupa un smashed. Certainly, the most stable ship in the world waa not selected for the cruise, and it saya something for the Princes that though they could have chanted vessels, they adhered to the Bacchante throughout It will be observed that in the passages quoted, "George ia spoken ef as the sufferer References such as this-proud allusions to the fact that " George now plays with our second eleven' -show that the most of the work is from the pen of Prince Albert Victor, but, on the other hand, mention that " Eddy led off the cheers, or "Eddy Bpoke in reply, indicate that Prince George is not without hia share m the composition Mr Dalton s additions being in brackets are easily rccog nised, but it ia oiteu difficult to tell which of the Pnncea ia speaking It was while the Bacchante waa greatly miBbehavmg herself in this matter of rolling that the rudder head gave, and it became ne ceasary-the squadron having been lost sight of in the gale-to bear up for Albany, instead of rendezvoumg at Cape Otway And so it chanced that, while all was expectation at Melbourne, and while the admiral and the squadron were anxious!) awaiting the arrival of the missing ship, the young Princes were en joying a scamper at KingGeorge aSound And a capital introduction the Albany adventure waa to Australian life The ship waa not ex pected there, and the Pnncea bud au oppor tunity of seeing a lonely part of the bush as it ia and ita inhabitants as they are, and not as both bush and settlers can be prepared for Ko)al visitors.

After tea found our wuy up across the paddock, to our night quarters and there we slept as soundly as possible (nine in the two rooms), with the windows open and the fires burning Two iron bedsteads have been rigged up in one of the rooma by the care of the good Scotchman who owns the farm, and the rest Bleep on mattresses spread on the floor, with their rugs wrapped round them.

A kangaroo drive on Mr Bowman's estate IB described at length The quickness of the bush horse is thus noticed - " We had lunch in the bush-English park like land, wooded with gum trees and sue oaks, no undergrowth, only rough groas making a fire, and cooking our own meat Mr Bowman showed us how to make bush man's tea, boiling the water first in the billy, putting the tea on the top and then the sugar, and stirring it up with a stick After lunch we rode after more kanguroo on horse back You can ride a kangaroo down after about two miles m the open , we got 1¿ in this way Using kangaroo hounds, about SO or 1)0 more were taken, the dulaclncB and wallabies leap and bound with their tails oft the ground, the kangaroo Beems touBclusasa lever, though really no kanguroo, unless by accident in uneven ground, when going fast, touches the ground with his tail The Uil balances the animal When standing, or moving slowly in act of feeding, the animal has the tail ulwaja touching the ground The Australian horses are very quick to turn, and when the bridle is merely pressed against one side of the neck, or when the slightest hint ia given by the pressure of the knee, they ore round m a second And ltis the same in driving It was quite astonish nig to watch the wa) in which Mr Bow man handled his pair, and whisked the wag gonette in and out and round about stumps and fallen trees, and all over the scrub, and coming home kept up abreast of the gal- loping horsemen.

Every- where there is an all pervading look of cleanness and freshness " " Nothing can be prettier," again we read, " than the outskirts ' The journey to Melbourne was made overland-by coach to Hamilton Iho rolling downs of the Western district re minded the Princes of Wiltshire. The train was taken to Melbourne "Our first atop waa at Ararat, at 1015, whore, while they were watering the en gine, we left the tram, and drove round the town The singing of the British National Anthem on our return (they had an har monium on the platform, and the children divided-the bo) 8 on one Bide of the Biatlon and the girls on the other) was the best we have beard otu where There was a great crowd, and the) were very enthusiastic. Then on to Ballarat, where at 110 we lunched with the major in the station btarted aguin, and only once more pulled uo, at Geelong, where thete was a jolly LngliBh peal of bells in the square church tower by the station, which sounded very home like as they rang We arrived at Melbourne at 4 20 p m Mr Berry, the gre) haired Prime Minister, with the rest of bia Cabinet, met us on the plattorm. After being introduced to each of these, we drove straight wuy up Collins anti Swanston streets to Government house, right through the city, the breadth of the streets and the magnificence ot the public buildings quite surprised us Both sides of the street were lined with people, who all seemed very pleased, and kept cheering away as hard as they could Our first impression is that the buildings Of the town are of darker hue and blacker than those in Adelaide, though much huger Again, of Melbourne we read - lew, it an), cities have ever attained so great a size with such rapidit) , old colonists remember cows tied up to the trees where the Town hall now stands , land then that was thought dear at £1 an acre now realises £500 per square foot, and plots which then were bought for £20 have been sold for 170,000 ihe parks, squares, and gardens are so numerous that with only one thirteenth of the population ot London it occupies very nearly half as great an area, len miles by seven is its nrea, and into it have congre gated one quarter of the population of Vic tona, a country nearly ns large as Great Britain, just in the same way a3 into Loudon are packed one tilth of the inhabitants of England, and as the population of London exceeds that of the whole of Scotland, so that of Melbourne exceeds that ot the whole of bouth Australia. Whether, however, it be for the real advantage of either city thus to draw together to itself so large a proportion of the population may be doubttul The rapidit) of its growth and dev elopement is a Btrikmg proof of what the enterprise of man and the power of wealth can effect even in on* generation Its edifices, under a sky usually clear blue (at middo) I gyptinn, in the even nig Mediterranean), rival in appearance those of the older capitals of Europe-the magiiih cent pile ot the Post office , the gigantic Trea sur), which, when finished, will be larger thuu our own m London , the University, the Parliament houses , the Union and Mel- bourne clubs, the City hull, the Wool Lx chaiige, the viaducts upon the Government railroad lines-all are C)clopean in their architecture, all seem built as if to laet for ever They are chictly constructed of blue- stone and in classic style, and therefore are almost as imperishable us the granite build lugs of Edinburgh Government house reminds us in its out wara appearance, of the Queen's house at Osborne It is built in the same style, and with a square tower 110ft. high, although all the uiterioi arrangements are on u fur more extensive scnli, the ballroom ia, for example, 18ft, longer than the state ballroom at Buck ingham palace As the building stands on high ground it is conspicuous from nearly ev ery part of the city The Ballarat visit was evidently greatly enjojed An engraving ia given from a photo graph of the Princes " in mining rig " Colonel Smith figures largely in the fore ground, but alas-such is the iron) ot fate the name given at the bottom of the en graving to identify Ina figure is that of " Mr Brophy " Another local identity, Mr Ser géant, is, however, all right Sandhurst also made a good impression After chatting about the city, the princes write - After the width of the streets, the three things which every Australian town seems to make good provision for at the very first sturt, are-first, the devotion of larg« open spaces for the public gardens or reserves, when the plan in first laid down '1 hese give an air of wholBomeness and space, and are planted out us recreation groundB and botanical gardens It was the first Governor of the colony (18531854), Mr Latrobe, who was the founder ot theso reserves. He secured the largest und best sites for parks and recreation grounds as lungs for the large cities, that lie foresaw from the very be ginuiug would spring up. Secondly, the binevolent institutions-churches, schools libraries, and hospitals, and tile water supply and the fire brigades. The water, for Instance, at Sandhurst, is brought from the Crusoe reservoir, six miles to the south Aud the third thing we particularly noticed while in Australia was the fine buildings, that seemed to bear more than a due propor- tion to the shops and private residence», t both in large and small towna. Of these the chief were always the banks. Banks lend money, and always require aecurit} , on this they foreclose and all over the country are the stations that belong to this or that bank T he banka set capital afloat through the countr) If the borrower is fortunate ener getic, able, and industrious he paya Ina inte rest wipes off Ina debts, ana blesses the banker If lie ia neither one of them the bank eats him up I hey sometimes close their jaws on the squattera, and eat one of these up aa well squatters with limited capital, borrow money on the security or their station, stock, or wool If they go too far they get embarrassed and the end of em harassment here as m the old country, and all the world over, ia the Bauie.
