THE THEATRE ROYAL. The favorite piece, the " Colleen Bawn," was repeated yesterday evening, with good success. The acting throughout was very clover, and some ot the scenory surpasses any yet sot on a Launceston stage. The sconic efllets of the great water cave, in particular, are really splendid, and the house shook-again with the enthusiastic plaudits of the audience. Mr. Harry Jackson's " Myles Coppaleen" was a most droll and eccentric character, and he kept the house almost in roars of laughter. Miss Kate Wardo's Eiley O'Connor, the Colleen Bawn, was an exquisite piece of acting throughout. Her constancy and deep flow of warm-hearted, impetuous love, were most beautifilly represented. Mr. Vinson ao Danny the Boatman, had a somewhat dis agreeable part to perform, but ho did it well. "Syltvetr Daggerwood" (the mad actor) fol lowed, Mr. Harry Jackson sustaining the prin cipal character with his usual ability. After this followed "Le Dansour Distrait, or the Ghost of the Village," and some of the dancing was excellent.
