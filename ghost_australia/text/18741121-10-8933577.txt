THE MERCURY. SATURDAY MORNING, NOV. St, 1874. Tub report of the Directors of the Main Line Railway, and the report of the meeting of share- holders iu London in September lost, which appeared in The Mercury of Thursday, demand more than a passing notice. With those por- tions of the report of the director», and of what speakers said at the meeting in referenoe to the Company's modo of raising capital, whether by bonds, debentures, or shares, and their arrange- ments for paying interest thoreon, we, in Tas- mania havo legitimately nothing to do. The Chairman of the Board of Directors might, with a little more grace, havo admitted the error in the English press that led' to the Government | of Tasmania interfering as it did. It was, perhaps, to 'be expected that, despite all the protended indifference to tho discussion that had arisen as to how far the Tasmanian Govern- ment wore responsible to the bond-holders and other creditors of the Company, the directors should Beek to escapo tindor a false issue ; and hence we can better understand the assertion of the Chairman, that the comments that had ap- peared in The Mercury were " an unfair play upon tho words of the concession," than we can to what concession Mr. Shkwabd referred. The question of Tasmania's liability should, however, be held definitively settled by the Chairman's ad missions that ' ' the Governmentdid not guarantee the £¡52,500 a year on tho Com pany'n bonds," and that "the Government hud guaranteed the Company a certain amount for doing a certain quantity of work," After snob statements and the Government's explanation in the press of England, intending investors will have. onlY-tliemselv,es_ to_blamo_ should_ihey_ speculato in Tasmanian Main Lino Railway stock uudor any misapprehension as to the nature of security on which they part with their money. On one point, however, the Chairman is so inaccurate in his statement that we can only arrive at the supposition that he has been mis reported. It is not the fact that " in their contract with the Tasmanian Government, the Company nero authorised to raise £050,000 in bauds, mid £400,000 in ordinary shares." The arrangements between the Government and the Company had nothing to do with the Company's mode of raising money. There was some such agreement betweeu the Company and the con | tractors, and we only refer to what the Chairman is reported to have said, to show that the insinua- tion that Government improperly threw difficul- ties in the way of tho Company conveyed in the words, " It was thought that no difficulty would have arisen from this arrangement," does not apply. It may bo said nothiug of the kind was intended, porhap3, but if so, we fail to see the application of the Chairman's remarks. ! The reports are on tho whole satisfactory, and, takon in connection with what the Chairman of tho Board of Directors had previously said in ' public, should allay any feoling of uuoasiness on the part of the Government and people of Tasmania, and satisfy them that while the Com pany rely with confidence-a confidence that will not be abused-on the Government of I Tasmania fulfilling their contract with the Com- pany, the Company on the other hand will make no demand on Government, unless they are | prepared to perform the work in consideration of which the Government gave its guarantee ; or, in the language of the contract, " The obliga- tions of the Governor and Company under this contract aro to be correlative and dependent ; the fulfilment of the obligations of the Governor being dependent upon the fulfilment of tho obligations of the Company, and vice tersa." In speaking of these mutual obligations, the Government of Tasmania, and that portion of its press that judges public questions on their merits, and not, as we have examples of, on the principle of dis- senting from whatever Government say or do, have all along regarded the ornoial test of tho sufficient construction of the railway te be the contract rate of spoed. Neither the Directors nor their Chairman appear to shirk this test, The Chairman spoke of oven a higher spued than the contract one being easy of attainment, and, a very injudicious aggressiveness in one in his position, charged ns with attacking the Company on the point of speed. When ho added that every thing had been said against the line and uothingin its favour, he was, as in several other matters, speaking ex cathedra on matters on which he was grossly and culpably ignorant. If the remarks we made wero Hablo to bo con- sidered an attack on the Company, who is res- ponsible for these remarks Í We wrote on the authority of the Company's own Eugineer, and on the evidence given by that gentleman before aSeU-ctCominitteeof the Assembly, aud on the re- port of that Committee. And on these authorities we wero justified in saying all that we did. Nono can be better pleased than we are to have the assurance of tho Chairman that fears arising from so apparently reliable a source are ground- less, and wo are sure that there is not a colonist in Tasmania who will not rejoice to learn, on the authority of the Chairman of the Board of Directors of tho Tasmanian Main Line Kail way Company, that the Government and the Company are at one as to their mutual obliga- tions ; and that an annual payment of £32,500 nieaus a minimum speed of 23 miles an hour, while a less speed, it is acknowledged, will absolve the Government from its guaran- tee- It is well to know our position ; it is well to know that any differences imagined looniiug in the distance are imaginary, and that, under any possible circumstances, the con- tracting parties know, and admit, their respective obligations. But, above all, is it satisfactory to be, told by and hi the name of the Company, that we are getting a better railway than we contracted for, and that all the advantages ia the shape of safe and sperdy traffic which we desired are to be ours. Should it be so, we shall have . reason to congratulate the Company on acting up to their obligations, and dispelling the doubts caused by their own representatives. Should it unfortunately prove otherwise, the state- ments made at the meeting of shareholders on September 18th, will rise up in judgment against the Company who, it is to be hoped, will have more reason to ask our confidence in the predic- tions of the Chairman, than our belief in his facts, when he speaks of " bricks used instead of timber in many of the bridges, and the larger ? bridgos being built of iron.'' We fear the Chairman has too hastily jumped to conclusions in holding that the "controversy that has been created in Tasmania as to the route of the railway has been set at rest by an engineer appointed by Government who had I reported in favour of the route adopted by the Company ;" and he has, to use his own language, " made an unfair play upon the wording" of the contract, when he said that the " Government had left the choice of the linn to the Company, specifying that the route should pass as near as possible to the centres of population." It is not necessary that we should at present dispute the conclusions of tho Company on this point, and pretty much for the reasons assigned by the directors for not opening the line till it is com- pleted ; reasons similar to those which Govern- ment have Baid have prevented them from an interference that might be premature, and there- fore injurious. The Chairman said: "The directors were advised that it would bo impolitic to open a portion of the line first, as questions might be raised and difficulties interposed that j might as well be avoided ; and it was decided : that the wiser course would be to complete the whole line before it was opened for traffic" Putting aside the legal phase of tho question, we must protest against Mr. Shewakd's facile manner of meeting objections by recklessly attri- buting improper motives to others. It may or may not be the fact that the line originally intended, and which is yet rogarded by many as the contract line, is, as reported by Mr. Grant, impracticable ; but most unquestionably Mr. Sheward has very grossly misrepresented the agitation against the change of route, by attributing it to the disappointment of " land speculators." To speak of the gentlemen in the Brighton, Green Ponds, and other districts, who insist on what is generally believed the contract route being adhered to, as "land speculators," is simply preposterous ; and this and other equally unfounded statements made by that gentleman at the meeting of shareholders, show that he is himself profoundly ignorant on subjects on which he sets himself up as a guide to others, One gentleman at the meeting was able to en- lighten those present by informing them that " politics in the Colony were chiefly confined to local matters. " That our Parliament or Govern- ment should stultify themselves by dealing with the affairs of other countries is not desirable, if it were only that we would not havn lunatic accommodation for such politicians ; but it would be most desirable that those who take it on them to enlighten others about our " local mattors" should take the trouble to make them» selves acquainted with the subject on which they talk, _ TuiîSiNO once more to the llegistrar-General's statistics of New South Wales we find that at the ¡ close of the year 1873 the population of tho colony was estimated at 560,275 persons, of whom 307,320 were males, showing a balance' of 54,383 on the side of the males. The increase in population during the twelvo months was 21,085 souls-a num- ber mainly due to natural increase. The number of marriages celebrated during the same period was 4,384, or nearly 8 to every 1,000 of the population ; as compared with tho preceding year the increase was 459. The number of births registered amounted to 21,444, being au increase of 194 on the previous year. The number of each sex was 10,952 males, and 10,492 females. There were 7,611 deaths re- corded, jy pearly-, 14_to _every__ 1,000 of_pppu;_ latioh ; the increase of totaf deaths on the previous year was 143. The total number of lunatics, &c;, remaining in the various estab- lishments on the 31st of December last, was 1,531 ; and the total charge on the public purpe was £37,090, showing an increase of £4090 on' the previous yoar. Under the designation qf charitable institutions the returns show that there were 40' institutions affording medical and surgical relief.' Among the institutions that were supported with- out assistance from Government we find the City Night Refuge and Soup Kitchen set down. The last-named establishment distributed during the year 70,3OS meals, and afforded shelter ¡u 25,740 cases. The general total receipts of the charitable institutions of the colony for the twelve months amounted to £129,485 ; of which sum £99,173 was from Government ; and £30,312 from voluntary contributions. The information contained in the ecclesiastical returns show that the general total of churches or chapels was 1,021. The number of Sunday-schools was 1,023 ; the number of teachers 6,497 ; children on the registers, 67,586 ; average attendance, 51,474. The schools in connection with the Council of Education numbered 942 ; the number of teachers 1,3S9, of whom S77 were males, and 512 females. The number of children attend- ing the schools was 49,545 males, and 42,758 females, making a total of 02,203, being an increase on the previous year of 3,816. The total amount paid out of the Colonial Treasury towards the support of these schools was £)21,2S5 which included a sum of £1,2S5 from the Clergy and School Estates Keveline Fuud. The total amount expepded on schools under the control of the Council of Education was £176,291. The Supreme and Circuit Courts records show during the year there were 347 committals, of which 327 went to trial ; the result showing 203 convictions and 124 acquittals ; the increase on tho preceding year being 3S coinmittalB, 84 trials, 31 convictions, and 54 acquittals. lu the Courts of Quarter Sessions, there wore 819 committals, of which 667 were sent to trial ; the result showing 444 convictions and 223 acquittals. The Summary Jurisdiction returns show that there were 21.4S4 persons taken into custody, of whom about 70 per cent, were convicted, 5 per cent, committed for trial, and 25 per cent, dis- charged. Out of the total number of convictions, about 61 per cent, were for drunkenness, the number of drunkards being 9,240 ; showing an increase of 1,404 on the preceding year. Examina- tion of the educational status of the prisoners, showed that 43'56 per cent could read and write ; 32*02 per cent, could read only, and 34*42 per cent, were not able cither to read or write. The returns of trade and commerce show an increase in the import trade from Queensland of £79,151 ; South Australia, £65,174 ; and Tasmania, £25,752 ; while from New Zealand there is a de- crease of £12S,001. The New Zealand export trade increased by £50,223 ; while Queensland showed a decrease of £143,614 ; and Tasmania of £1S,949. Under the head of manufactories, we fiud there were in the colony 7,719 manufactories! and works of all descriptions. Tho various manu- factories and machines connected with agriculture numbered 6,333 as against 5,940 in the previous year. In the working of raw materials, in connec- tion with the pastoral interest, there were seven establishments for the manufacture of woollen cloth and tweeds, which articles were produced to the extent of 321,070 yards, showing an increase of 119.S10 yards ou the previous vear. ! The visit of Sir Hercules Robinson to Fiji has caused, most unexpectedly, a rather exciting con- troversy between Sir James Martin, Chief Justice, and the Cabinet 01 that Colony Sir James, w ho appears to be \er\ sensitive on the bump of self esteem, claimed to be "of right" sworn in as administrator of the O on eminent during the absence) of Sir Hercules Robinson at Fin. The Minuter«, howe» er, did not appear to take the same Mew of the matter as the Chief Justice, and hence arose a lengthy disquisition into the merits of the case Holding whatev er opinion oue may as to the consti tutional legality of air James Martin's claim, he certainly does not appear to any great credit in the dispute Puerile \anity is at all times contemptible, even in individuals ot but \er> mediocre ability or position , but, in the present case, where a man of lofty position, and whose profouud legal knowledge was known throughout the Colony, descends to exhibit this petty feeling, it is pitiful as well as contemptible. In reading over the voluminous teamed argument* employed in she contre veray, one can hardly fail to stigmatize it as "Much ado about nothing." It is a pity that the Chief Justice should have so soon cast a blemish over the glory of his newly and deservedly acquired honour. He was *' a man who had risen," and consequently required to use the nicest discrimination in regard to these trifling points of constitutional etiquette, especially when wholly connected with his own egotism. But, though at all times impulsive and headstrong in his character, one cannot but wonder at the ludicrous zeal with which he urged this empty claim of " right," During the course of the dis- pute, au official case in connection with his duty was brought before him. A married women applied for the admission of her husband into a Lunatic Asylum, as he was of unsound mind. Medical certificates in support of this, showing that the individual was a dangerous lunatic, were produced. A certificate of a judge of tho Supreme Court in cases like these is always required by law, and Sir James Martin was officially requested to supply this legal certificate. This was an important matter, and one that required immediate action for the Bafety of the public. But the Chief Justice, losing Bight altogether of his duty, and the actual necessity of at once performing that duty, bridles himself up in his fancied wounded vanity, and writes at the head of the petition :-" It is useless for a judge to certify in this case, as there is neither Governor nor Administrator to sign the order for admission to the Asylum." Now, it is well known that during the Martin Administration, in the absence of the then Governor, numerous orders, &c;, of this kind were made, without any cavil on the part of the Chief Justice, at that time j Premier. On being remonstrated with on such an unwarrantable course as the one he had now taken, he rushed into a vast array of arguments as to the relative powers of the Governor and the Executive, a matter altogether out of the range of the duty he was desired to perform. On the matter being referred to Mr. Justice Hargraves, he took a com- mon sense view of the question, and citing in support; of his views the 4th section of the Magna Charta, which forbids all postponements of justice and right, he performed tbe duty which the Chief Justice had refused to do. In a very able letter on the subject Mr. Justice Hargraves thus writes :-"With every possible respect to the Chief Justice, I am quite satisfied that my only duty as an individual judge of the Supreme Court was either to report upou the matter officially submitted by the Minister to me as a judge, or to resign my judgeship-and this wholly without reference to the " absence of the Governor " from the colony, or to the claim ad- vanced by the Chiof Justice to be in law Adminis- trator of tho Colony, previously to being sworn into such offi'.-o." The action taken by Sir Jamea Martin, throughout the whole farce, of which he was the originator, and leading character, beam, certainly, anything but a manly aspect; and, doubtless, by this time he has arrived at the same conclusion. But cases of this kind, though not so flagrant as the one under consideration, are, by no means, so uncommon. We see actions precisely of a similar kind passing beforo our eyes almost daily; men holding high positions, and of good I abilities, sacrificing their duty before the altar of petty vanity and pique. -, Thf Nrw Go\ minor o» Western Australia - It will be seen by our London telegram this morning, that Mr William Cleaver Francis Robinson, has been appointed Governor of Western Australia, in the room of Mr Weld Mr Robinson was private secretary to Sir Hercules Robinson, in the government of St Kitts and Hong Kong, from 1855 toi SOO, President of Montserrat in 1862, administered the government of Dominica from the 5th of January to the 18th ot October, 180."), and n as appointed Governor and Commander in chief of the ioulkland Islands, on the 2Srd of May, 1806 , and Lerutenant Go*, eruor of Princo Edward Island, a portion of the Dominion of Canada, in 1870, at a salary of ti, "¡00, Alarming Illnlss oi Mr Ch uti is Dwra\ es - The many friends of Mr Charles Degraves will rtgrct to learn that on Thursday morning he had an attack of paralysis of so alarming a nature that the services of Drs Agnew, Bright, Butler, aud Smart were called in One oi other of these gentle men remained, we understand, with M.r Degraves at his residence throughout the day and night, and has been in pretty constant attendance on lum all day yesterday At a late hour last cv enuig Atr Degra\ es w as m any thing but the hopeful condition hi© friendo would ilooirc-- - -' Dfath of Mr Thom ts Sfi f -The many friends of Mr Self of Collins street, in ill regret to hear that he died suddenly yesterday at his residence He has been ailing for some months, but on Thursday last was apparently in much better health than usual In the o\ emng, all the family Bat down to supper, and Mr iself kept them thoroughly amused, hut suddenly held up his hands and complained of a curious sensation m the tips of his fingers His wife became alarmed at his appearance, but he said he « 13 all right He expressed a v. ish, how e\ er, to go to bed, but m the act of doing so, fell down The aerucos of Drs Crowther and Smart were pro cured, but the deceased remained in a comatose state till midday yesterday, when he died Mr Self was 77 ye.irs of age, and had been m the colony 54 years For many j ears be was miller at Luck man s null, Collins street, and was subsequently a corn dealer in a shop opposite Latterly for some years he has been m business as a draper on the premises in which he died He lets es a widow and four children, two sons and two daughters GLtrNORCin Police Court-It wis only the other day that ne complained of the inexplicable retiosnce which prevails at Glenorchy, respecting the sittings of the court there A esterday there vv as another instance of the same thing It was known early hi the week that the court would sit yesterday, and that several cases were set doun for hearing, one of them being a serious oharge against four young men of committing a brutal assault on an old v. oman , but not the least intimation w as given to the press and it was only by the merest occident that n e beard of it It is scarcely necea san to say that a member of our staff w as at once sent there, and his arrival seemed to cause con siderable astomshment to the officials The court has no regular day for sitting, but is held when ev er there are any cases, or w heiiev cr it suits the earn enience of the magistrates , and the consequence is that important coses which are heard there might as nell be tried with closed doors, for all that the public know about them Surely it would not uitiil ver\ much extra work on the Council Clerk if, following the example of other inumci politics, he were instructed by the Wardeu to intimate to the press v, hene\ cr the court is to sit Perhaps ne can scarcely e\pcct such condescension seeing that the desire appears to be to keep the business of the court as secret as possible Allioh>Brii\l Ahsulton vn Old Woman - At the Glenorchy Police Court yesterday, four xmng men, named Willam M Guirc, John Oxlev, Thomas \\\ bite, and Edward Tilyard, were charged with committing a criminal assault on a married woman, named Mary Ann Hancock, about fifty \ears of age The \\\ arden presided, and Mr Moriarty appeared tor the prisoners fho court w as cleared prior to the case being opened The prosecutm. nae unable to ldenüfv White as one of her assailants, and the charge against lum was accordingly withdrawn.
