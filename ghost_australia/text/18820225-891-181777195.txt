AN INSANE GHOST. Tub mystery of an apparently supernatural visitation which has beon exercising the minds of residents of the Oreswiok Road, Ballarat, of late, hds been unraTelled (says the Star). Two young mon courageously rcsolvod to fathom the matter, and accordingly at a late hour on the evening of tho 8th instant, visited tho locality of its peregrinations. They stationed themseves on tho footpath, and after several minutes' delay the ghostly visitant advanced from the sholter of-u tree guard with solemn steps towards them. Not a muscle quivered, not a movement on the part of tho yonng men, and gradually tho unearthly-looking being drew near. At length, within a few feet of the men, the ghost stopped. A deathly silence prevailed, during which the visitant transfixed its g&ze;, and with a sepulchral look slowly en circled the young men with the "unholy circle." An the ghost walked round, the young fellows revolved, seemingly fascinated with tho mag. netiim of its presence. When the circle was completed, one of the men challenged the visitant several times to answer questions con cerning its name, relationship, and object in walking abroad. No replied being vouchsafed, tho interlocutor determined to end the matter. He struck a match, and held it directly in front of tbo visitant's face, disclosing tho featurc-B of a young woman of passable appear ance. This person was clad in a light bluo shawl thrown over her head, and was apparently Insane. The yonng men, satisfied that a rather fleshly visitant was the promenading disturber of tho neighbourhood, left without capt tiring the woman. '
