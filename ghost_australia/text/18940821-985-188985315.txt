EXTRAORDINARY EPIDEMIC IN RUSSIA. A Russian journal describes a pe culiar religious movement in tlie winter of 1891-92 in the province of Kiev, The originator was a Rus sian, given. to drink until the age of 40 years, when he reformed and joined the Stundists, following zeal ously the religious rites of the sect, and often going into a condition of ecstacy. A few years later, he be gan to suffer from hallucinations, among others perceiving extremely pleasant perfumes, which he de clared to be the smell of the Holy Ghost. Then he conceived that he was possessed of the Holy Ghost, and that he was Jesus Ghrist. He obtained numerous peasant followers who sold their possessions, gave up work and looked upon their insane leader as the Saviour of the world, in which there should soon be new revelations; no one should die, and no one should have need to work or to care for the future, for God would care for theiu all. Most of thein suffered from hallucinations j of the sense of smell, perceiving ex- i tremely agreeable odors, which they | described as pertaining to God and , Heaven. Many had a feeling of re- i markable bodily lightness, as if floating in the air, and many others were taken with convulsions, mani festly hysterical. The congregations were always noisy and exalted, some falling to the earth, others jumping, striking themselves on the breast, and shouting inarticulately. Some would imitate conversation; but it consisted of incomprehensible, senseiesssounds, which they believed to be a language spoken somewhere. Most of them were emaciated and anaemic. The epidemic was finally overcome by the authorities; those who were most insane being shut up in asylums, while the hysterical were sent to hospitals and convents.
