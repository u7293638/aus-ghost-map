Cardew; secretary, Mr. Abel Hyde.- The first day's raoing in connection with die summer meeting of the Queensland Turf Olub was held at Eagle Farm yesterday, and lossed off successfully and enjoyably. Tho : nterest taken in the gathering was indicated at quite an early hour in tho day by the number of visitors who wore seen making their way to the course by train, tram, and other conveyanoc. Gradually the numbers swelled until the grandstand and St. Legcr reserves presented a crowded appeoranco, and there was quite a representative and fuhionnble gathering. A vory largo propor tion of those who assombled consisted of ladies, whoso bright coBtumes added in effect to an animated aoene. Many country visitors also' were iu attendance. At this timo of the year the course and its surroundings do not wear a very inviting appearance, and the grass very plainly showed tha want of aoakiug rain. It waa clearly indioated, however, that tho committee had not neglected anything, and, as usual, everything possible was done for the comfort of visitors. The day was rather warm, the heat though being tempored in the afternoon by a ooofing breeze. The programme arranged for tho day consisted of soven races, and these were curried through without mishap or unpleasantness. Kcou interest was centred in the sport, and this was accentuated by the faat that several southern horses were contestants amongst tho fields ih a number of events. Good racing resulted, and there were several closo finishes. Tho sum of £7,114 pussed throuub tha totalisator during the day. On the corresponding day last year the sum registered was £0,375, so that yesterday shows au increase of over £700. Tho betting wus in favuur of the books, aa tho first favour ites were defeated nil ull save two occasions. Speculation was very briBk on the Queensland Cup, which resulted in an easy win for Gold smith, who, on previous running, scarcely seemeel to havo the slightest chance. Backers were vory muoh inclined to favour southern horses, but they suffered disappointment oh three occasions. Hare it may bo remarked that southern riders who hnd come to Bris- bnno specially for ths meeting wero much moro successful than, the visiting horses, as Huxley piloted Goldsmith to victory ih tho Gup, and Callinan scored two wins, having the mounts on Siron and Mulguh in the Doncnster Handicap and tho First Novice Handicap re spectively. The Naval Headquarters Baud werp stationed on the lawu, and, with excel lent mttsio, added a good deal to the harmony of the gathering. The field that went out to contest the Trial Handicap numbered 19 starters. Several of them ut the weights appeared! to have an equal obunce, but baokera disregarded the looal horses and went solidly - for the southern visitor Fluker. "VYirh the large field the books, however, could afford to give liberal odds, and the offer of " 5 to 1 the field" waa only to be expected. Gauntlet was next in favour and then Atlantic, hut against the others long prices wero quoted. Investors,. or rather the majority of them, did not make a very good beginning. Fiuker fluttered them by leading for about 6 furlongs of the journey, when the field olosed on liini. . Atlantic then appeared in front, but the handsome looking, although disappointing Ruby K. had to be reckoned with, and sho, putting iu a very faat run on tho outside, succeeded in winning by half a length. The favourite wus about a head away, third. The owner of Atlantic entered a protest against the winner, fororossing, which was immediately considered by the stewards. They considered it frivolous and dis missed it, and also directed that the £5 lodged as a deposit should be forfeited. From the Flying Handicap, Hector II., Satrap, and Prince Bismarck were withdrawn, ileaving a field of 15 to contest the event. Telegraph and Veronica were made equal favourites at 'the 'odds of 4 'to 1 against, nnd Arnxes was the best supported of the others. Veronica never showed out, hut Telegraph asserted his superiority over tha distance, and also demon strated his ability to carry weight, aa despite the impost of 10 st., he run the distance in the excellent timo of 1 min. 15J- sees. Notre Dame was second after run ning nil oxcellent race, while Araxes was third, both being oloso up to the winner. Tho Queensland Cup was tho next event on tho card, tho scratchings being Musket and Angler. This loft u field of 15 horses to go to the post. Ever since tho probable starters bad been made known tbe chances of the horses had been freely discussed. Boacobel had ruled as favourite froin -the outset; and he cartuinty looked tho pick of tho handicap. He had a light weight, and it was known that he could get the distance. On Saturday, howovor, his supporters were inclined to waver until he won the Album Park Handi cap in good time, aud this re- established their confidence in him. \ When betting started his quotation wns lowest, anil nt starting, time ruled at.o to 1 against. Goldsmith was next in favour, liis price being 6 to 1 ngaiust. Tho reason, however, wus more tho noiifidence of \- his owner than anything brilliant that Gold- smith had done. At Sandgate, a few weeks ago, ho ran very indiff crently, but since then ho had done good work on tho truck, aud his owner backed him for a large atake. Amor and Adnaw found u good deal of support. Amor is admittedly a good mare, and her winning of the Onp last year proved that she could stay. The only doubt was whether she could carry the heavy impost (top weight) over tho long journey. But little was knowu of Aduuw, and ths support accorded to liim waa probably because lie bad tho services of Goiigh 111 ths saddle. Nevermore, Reprobate, and The Guard wero given a chance, nnd among the light weights The Afghan was singled out. The race waa au interesting ouo, although lack ing a close finish. Mr. Kirk got the field uway to a good start, Amor being tha quiokest to move. . Sho did not aat as pacemaker for long, though. a« Master Bernie rushed to the front and set out to make tho pace merry. Past the ataud the first time he led from Drake, Boscobel, and Amor, Goldsmith being near tho rear of the field, ns was Nevermore. There was 110 material alteration to the back where Renrobute made a move and drew up, with the" lender. Past' the 6 furlongs Muster Bernie was going strongly, but the riders of tho others now began to shake their mounts up, and Goldsmith aud Nevermore began to work forward. Still Master Bernie was not overtaken until the straight was resetted. Then Amor, Goldsmith, Meribab, Nevermore, aud Brise-de-nuits appeared ou tbe soono. Amur's victory was shouted, but Goldsmith smothered all opposition, for as tho furlong post wah readied he took command, and leavmgths field, won very easily by four lengths. Amor finished two lengths iu front of Meribali, with Nevermore fourth. Gold smith's win was mi exceedingly popular one, more partioulurly us Mr. Talty (the owuor) rnado no seoret of .his opinion about the horso's ability to win. The Sydney jockey Huxley had tha mount on tho winner, and ho rode a well judged race. Amur's second was aoreditableono, omisidering tho weight, while Merilnhsurprisedmany by securing third placo u very few gavo hiin a "ghost of a ohauoe." Nevermore finished vory1 fast at tho eud, as did the erratio Brise-doa-nuits. Master Bernio's performuiioo, taking liis onudition into consideration, shows what a sterling horse ho is, and it is certain that with judiolous training many first-class evonta would be annexed by him. The favourite ran well to tho straight, but then died away. Reprobate made a bold bid once, and Mist was oloso up with tho front division most of the way, out uono of tho others showed any brilliance. The time for the journey was 3 niinn. 34£ sees., whioh is equal to the time of Amor last year. Aftor the Cup. tho Doncuster Hnndioap for two. year-olds, claimed attention, there being seven starters. Baokoni onoo more supported a southorn visitor, and msrio Mr. Kelso's b.g. Loch Iiookie a warm favourite. This ' calculation was uptet by anhther southerner lit Siren, who won from Bluolight, with the favourite ocoupying third position. Out of a field of 13 starters in tho First Novioo Han dicap, Vivandiere and Rardcoso shared 1)10 honours forprido of plaoe in the . betting at the odds of 4 to 1 against. Mulguh and Ouddalcen wore noxt In demand, 7 to 1 being obtainable abont tbem. Fortune, however, still-refused to favour tho popular fancy, tho race being won by Mutgah from Saturn and Odmua. Having' won the First Novice, Mulgah. was. at oneo withdrawn from tho Selling Race, leavinjg a field of liirie to face the' barrier' in that ovent. Czar had ' tbe lion's' share of the support, and at the" oloso 5 to 4 against was the best offer obtain able about him. Safety was second in favour ut 3 to 1, the next price quoted being 7 to 1. Battler made the pace until the dis tance post was reached, where Czar took command and won by two lengths. The winner was put lip at auction and bought in by his owner for 72 guineas, which, as he was entered to be sold for £40. means a benefit of '' over £30 to the club. From tho December Handicap, the saratahings were Adnaw aud The Afghan, leaving ten to contest the ovent. For the third time during tho day investors pinned their faith to a southern horse, in Golden Ring, and for the third time they Buffered defeat. Golden Ring was quoted at 6 to 4 against, and Athlono was next quoted at 4 to 1.: The result oame as a surprise, the winner turniug up in a rank outsider in Circe, who has the reputation of being- able! to gallop, bat who nos rarely shown auy brilliance in public. Sho won cleverly by a neck from the favourite, aftor the latter had held the leading position all tho way until a short distance from the post. The dividend returned, £11 5s., was the largest paid at the' meoting.

A- tho horses stood at the post Amor had the position on the rails, white next in order were Brise- dos-nuits and Nevermore ; Goldsmith, Master Bernie, aud Boscobel were near the contre, and those on the extreme outside were The Afghan, King, and Mist. The barrier rose to a vory fair start. Amor was the first to break the line, and fol lowing her appeared Drake and Boscobel. A. few yards only had beou covered when Master Bernie rushed to tho head of affairs, nnd as tho straight was reached he was a couplo of lengths ahead of the field. Passing the stand the first timo Master Bernie led from Drake, Boscobol, Amor, Reprobate, Tho Guard, and Mist, with Tho King at the rear. Leaving tbe straight tho order was Master Bernie, Drake, Boscobel, Mist, and Amor, and these jositions wero maintained along the back:.
