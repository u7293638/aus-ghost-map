Myers writes the following to the Spirit of the Times : — '? New ? York i City, May 24; — In1 an interview published last 'Satuiday, by one of your contemporaries, Mr; W.'Gv George is reported as sayingf ;triat,: inhis dpinioni I would not have the ghost of a1 chance with Cummihgs'in'a series of races at the distances Irecently. defeated1 him (George). : He may ;be anxious to explain away his defeat by. at tributing itto a small track,.eto., but I can scarcely understand why he would go so i far as to say that a man whom he claims he can beat easily up to a mile can easily defeat me at such distances as '1000 yards; - About records, I should say that my 1000 yards record was far and away the best in the world, being about 20 yards better than Cuiimings or George has ever shown. As ' to my three-quarter record, I can-say that I have only run the distance twice j once - 'when sick and out of condition, and on May 8, when I defeated George, almost without an effort. I am not at all anxious to crow over my defeat of George, but I would like to say that all the talk about' a'slow track, sharp' corners,- long stride; etc., ? is more or less ' bosh.' My stride is at' least six inches longer than George's; and the slow times returned are entirely due to the fact that George!- either couldn't or wouldn't make the pace faster. In the first two races Twos prepared to run !at least five 'seconds faster, land no one who saw tl& race can doubt this statement. I do not'claim tobe'the fastest sprint runner in the worldi nor could I ever become as fast over a sprint course as several runners I could name, for the simple reason that I am not heavy enough. I ' do claim, how ever; that I can beat any man in the world from 444) yardsto three-quarters of a mile, and I. will' run anybody, anywhere, give : or ?take expenses; any or all of these distances, for from: 2500 ddls to 5000 dols a side; winner to take all1 ' receipts and ' pay ; ex penses;'.' ?'''??
