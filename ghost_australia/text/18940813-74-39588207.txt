COST OF JUSTICE. TO THE EDITOR. SIt,-An economical problem recurs to me again and again, and it is once more before me with strong persistency, and in order to lay its ghost I think it advis able to submit it to others who may feel interested. Our judges, magistrates, and their satellites are appointed to their positions for the administration of justice, and their salaries are provided out of taxes subscribed by the general public. This being so, why is it that anyone requiring justice or protection is called upon to pay a second time for their common rights. The glorious uncertainty of the law, and the heavy fees required to put it in motion, undoubtedly prevent many people from seeking redress where injury is alleged or sustained, and to my mind justice and equity should be within the reach of rich and poor equally without fee or costs. Professional legal assistance should be optional, and at a scale approved by the public and fixed by Parliament.-Yours, etc., OPEN JUSTICE.
