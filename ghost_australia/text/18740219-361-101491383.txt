POETRY. ,SENSATION. flY THE AUTHOR OO 0 IR 0GUT Dr OUT." IN days of yore, whesmen were slow, And simple things wore taught to know, With nederstanding mopk and low, And low VeneratJobn; How olomsy were the, arts designed By ooeophieticated hind To mystify the rural ~iod. And mnake a gr at sensation. Some mask or shoot.and.turnlp ghost, Or awkward conjurocit the most, Was all that geniusethen could boast, By way of agitation, The problem of tbhe nisling pea; The wandering porkors A B 0; The fostone.teller's nSsterle, Comprised tLir stock sensation. Tboh puzzled boor w old scratch his pate, And grinu, and own tlje trick was great, Dut ne'er would he profaneoly prate Of "spirit visitatioi." He loved a ghost, any loved it best When he the goblin could arrest And then apply the cart.whlp test, And give and take sensation. Bot conjurore now alret alllanee With spirits, and the de'il's compliance; raise hnoues.pocuns to a'' science' With vast elaboration. And silly dames and eolemns eools Will leud tboemsoelves the trickstor's tools And sit like gaping gitls in schoole Awaiting a sonsation. Thie export their little wit confuses; His neat machinery he uses; A trumpet sounds, a table cruises SImmeoso tliuir perturbation I A colleague binds the conjuror tight, And then extinguishes the light; Then thiump tbhe audieneoo' left and right, Producing great s6nation,. The Jlmplo dupes of either sex Their little bit of braiti orplex, IDelieving spirits come to vex And hold confabulation. And thus our wiser age we find Defoolod; moro ignorait than the bld, Whose healthy credelce was confloned To rational sensation. The arts, the drama, and the press This ruling prlncpl profess; Iteuligion, too, doth hdly less In this our ge?Jration; Until we sigh a n kuow Those dear old dsy f long ago, When mn e weie 'o ple dull and slow, And lived w out sonsation, -Ornce a Yeek,
