Bainger cc^oluded a serits of lantern lectures and entertainments in aid of the Home Mission Fund. Toe lantern kindly loaned for the occasion by Mr. Thos. Qoooe, of Goolwa, proved an exceptionally good one, and several sets of news including ' Meg and her brother Ben,9 ** Mariey's Ghost,' ' Whittington and his Cat,' etc., were tbiown on the screen and won unstinted 'etpraise, particulaly from the children. The exhibition was interspersed with explanatory remarks and altogether a very enjoyable and instructive evening was spent, and as a result the fionie Mission Fund considerably benefited. Methodist Unitbo Bbbtioks. — The Wesleyua and Primitive Methodist congrega tions again assembled in the Wesleyan Church on Sunday hut, Mr. Menmuir occupy ing Jthe pulpit in the . morning and Rev. W. ' A. Bainger prca^ing in the. evening on ' Christ the bre^d of life.' The church was again crowed to follcapicity, the large con gregation, joining heartily in a most stimulat ing and helpful service. The church was lighted for the first time with the Wellabach incandescoBt burners, whioh gave a light soft yet bnllknfy and proved m every re*pect a most gf atif vlng success. Three lights branch out from each of two centre pieces suspended from the ceilinp, and proved amply sufficient. The. church officials .have since been over whelmed with -x-Dgmtulatkm on th« success of their new departure, . A MoDBfiJf WltLIAM: Teii.— A Berifu Correspondent gives particulars of the very sad accident at a display of expert shooting by Eruger. who shot all eoiU of obj eta off his sister's lead and oat of her hand amidst - the applaase of about 4.000 peop e He had begun mirror sho.liag, - firing backwards over -his shoulder at . an object only the refleetion of wbiiih he saw throuea the gins* and prepared for the so-called William fell shot— aining at a glass ball placed on her head, for this purpose he loaded a cayalry pistol with a large ball cartridge, pointed the weapon backwards over bis shoulder, and pulled the trigger. . Aa awful «sreaai^ told o£ the reeblt, the poor g'vA *t tbe same tinea falling to ground. The ball had bit, her in the mouth and . hod passed out' through tho back of her neck. Inde«cribable eiciteinwat prevailed amongst the audience, aba everVbodv tried to rash on to the Btage, «h*re the unhappy Krnger, the picture of despair, knelt by his dying sister. A surgeon was on the epot at pneeiut lie oonld not save xbe yiwig girl, whodied a few minutes after ;tbi la^at shot 1p4 been fired. - - . .'.:.? Methohist Union. An important meeting ot officials connected with the Wesleyan ami Primitive Methodist Churches of this District was held on Saturday last in the Wesleyan Church in this town. The Rev S. Gray, was appointed chairman and Rev. \V. Bainger./and Mr d , Harvey, secretdrits. The subject for consideration was -Methodist' Uniohyjanjl Uie readjustment of Circuit lwuncl aries in conhjection therewith. The matter being, one of1 great importance, lengthy and thoughtful consideration . was given to the subject and it was finally decided to recom mend to the Federal Council find United Conference the formation of two Circuits to be constituted as follows. (1) StralhalLyn. Woodchester, Belvidere, Langhorne:s Creekj Angas Wains, Mulgundawa, Pinery, Hartley, -Queen's Own Town, and . Sandergrove, with minister in full.connexion to reside at Strath alliyn. (2) Meadows Bull's Creek Prospect Hill, Underwood, Giles' Flat, and Ashbourne, urttli o nunic^r in full rnnrTAvinn M rvsctr-I^ -^#- Meadows, or Bull's Cfeek. It is pointed out that the Strathalby, Circuit would he large,, some of the places only have an occasional service, snd some none at all, so that with a number of efficiept local preachers it can be worked satisfactorily. It was also decided that in the event of Union taking place a portion of the proceeds accruing from sale of properties shall be devoted to assisst ing to build a manse in connection -with the new Circuit. A fine brotherly spirit per^ vaded . the meeting, and it is generally be lieved that whenever Methodist Union is consummated it will result in ah infusion of new life and power'lnto tha Methodist C hurch ia this district. According to the present out-lpok we think that it is probable that this long desired event will be realized by the end of the present century; The India-Rubber Book. — The eyefe boom and the' perfection of the pneumatic tyiu lias broiigl t with it a great increase in the demand for india-rubber. Throughout the tropics rubber gatherers are tuuru active than they -have ever, been before. We he,ir ot emigrants by the hundred flocking to tho Amazon valley, whence comes the most valuable of all rubbers — Para. Benighted chiefs in 'Darkest Africa 'are frst discover ing that their fi rests contain a barter able product much more eas ly obtau e 1 1 tan ivory, and are threatening veoturesomo strangers with death for daring to trespass in jungies which hitherto have been, to all intents and purposes, No Man's L mil. The T~)vbV fit Rnmnn finf^a vnKl.oi* AnllA/trifi -# mnM profitable than hunting for heads. Tho Battach oE Sumatra, the i akalava of Mada gascar, the Buraitm dacoit, the piratical Sulu, and Lanum— all our most notorious ' savages ' have found ont the value of the milky sap, and are exporting the coagulated product, yet still the demand increases, and the price of the better qualities goes up. Ac cording t'J the ' Daily Mail,'' nearly one-third of the world's rubber supply comes from Africa, and it is to the opening up of the Daik Continent that out manufacturers osre their freedom from a severe pinch, and it is on Africa's ability to keep up tLe supply that our freedom from a rubber famine or a great rise in prices depends. Unless there is much, greater activity in constructing railway?, it is difficult to see how the African supply can be greatly increased, or even maintained. The* forests within » sy distance of the coast have moBtly been stripped. Bubber which arrives from. a long distance on the' heads of carriers is generally heated kcdmucli depreciated in value — often, indeed, not worth the cost ofpro- curing it. The Congo State, which ia 1889 exported five tons of rubber, by the aid of its railway exported 1,116 tons in prime con dition in 1896. Railways tapping the great forests of the interior in every direction wouUi undoubtedly enable Africa to keep a inanu factureis going for a considerable period ; bub utiless the native collector can be taught wisdom, the pinch, more or less severe uiusd come eventuuiy, tor even the vast forests of the Dark Continent are not iuextuuetible, ami felled trees cannot bear a sec -nd crop of ruiber. At present prices tbe cultivation of rubber-yielding trees pr,mi»es eplendid profits with a minimum of trouble and ex-' pensc. Should the price of iu -Lser be g/vaily increased, as seems probable, thirii the profit^ of a will-placed plattatiou would be enorm juS ? Tub Biggest Siuf Afloat. — On May 4 the largest ship ever built iu the world was launched at Stettin, Germany, riiesteaimr, named Kaiser Wilhelin der Grosse, ;hus been built after the plans and to the orJtr of the Norideutcher JLloyd Steams'iip Company, and belongs to the highest class of ships. A few particulars will be of interest. Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse is built as a twin- scniW steamer. The length is not less than 6 4 ft. iu the waterlme, and 650 ft. oa deck ; breadth 6G ft. ; depth, viz, from keel to tha upper deck, without decs building-, is 43 ft. ; the ships storage room represents 13,800 tous register; the. displacements 20,000 tous. Passenger accommodation, cargo, and the ship in general has been built after modern experiments, -The ship's body contains 15 watertight compartments, and a long machinery department, in bath, sides of which the niachiuary is placed independent of each . other. Through thesa apartments ther steamer is divided' into eighteen watertight compartments. Besides that the slap has a double bottom. The steamer contains two triple-expansion .machines each wi-h four cranks and four behind each other lying: steam cylinders. Besides two principal machines, the steamer contains no fess than sixty-eight other machines ^for electric light' ing, pumps, &c;), with together 124 steara cylinders. To avoid the reeling and the before concussion the machines are balanced by the well-kdtwn Schlick's system. The . ? l*:Hno {U«1irk«4a nni Toso than. 3n ft(Mk horse-power. They are driven by twelve double and two' single boilers, unJ reauiru daily from 45D to 500 tons of coal. The steamer will have » speed of twenty-two miles per honr. Thepassengeracuonnnodaiiou will be for 400 first- class, 34o second-~las«, 800 third-class passengers.
