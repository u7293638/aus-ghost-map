NORTHERN TERRITORY BOTTLES. "W. A. M." has been edifying the Weekly Christian with an account in nine verses of the empty bottles in the Northern Territory. We sample two of them—not the bottles—bnt the verses :— 'Neath the darksome jungle's shutter, whore the wooddovea flirt and flutter, Where Dame Naturo pours profusion of bounties from her ghostly store There I saw them, vigils keeping, shining hacks for ever peeping From the grass where I beheld them, veritable ghosts of yore; And a voice behind me whispered—" From the fes tive days of yore Empty bottles—nothing moro." SbouM it ever be so fated that white men, by " John" disrated. Should become all isolated from N.T.'s extensive shore, And to wipe na from existence "John" maintained with great persistence, This has always been a China—he read it in his books of yore— ! Woat will show we had a being, and disprove those lying books oi yore 1 j Empty bottles—nothing more.
