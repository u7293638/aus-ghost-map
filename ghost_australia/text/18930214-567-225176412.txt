Bippon as a bowler, aod it appeared likely that he was going to do damage, as be served notices to quit on both, those clever batsmen, Reynolds Bros., in bis first over. Hunt aod M'Lellao, however, got together and made a capital stand, which carried the total past the century. Eventu ally, various bowlers having failed, Melville went on with slow twisters, and secored M'Lellan Ibw. Kot, however, before the retiring batsman had played an excellent, lively innings for -62 with only one blemish, a comparatively easy chance to Bippon, his bowler Hunt played grandly for o0, and might have remained there all day had he not tried to knock the leather off tbe hall when Brimombe pitched it rather short. A. Learmonth " warmed 51 the slows to the tuue of 44 a baker's Â«"<ozen 11 be fore being stomped off one. J. Leannontb batted nicely for 17, when he tried to 44 place a slow and saw bis wicket lose its symmetry, and Grant hit out for 12. The total was 166. As a slow bowler, Melville showed himself a worthy successor to a former skipper of tbe H.C.C. eleven, five wickete falling to his early ones, and Brima- combe, three wickets, kept very straight. For Banks aod law Hardacre batted like a cricketer for 27. Moon, shaping better at Beynolds tempters than neoal, quickly ran up to 36, and G- Bippon placed 12 to his credit.
