Select Poetry. A DAY DREAM. A week now past, and in that week A day of fairest mien, The merry shout at school-boy freak, Gave to my thoughts a dream. I sauntered down, in fancy there, Mr chool-days well-known track; Through sunny fields, and view'd again The school of eight years back. Amid "desertion" there I roved Where then the bubbling mirth, And mused of school-mates well belov'd And hopes that there had birth. And ghosts of these eight years troop'd by With weary burdens fraught Of sad farewells of them that die To those from whom they part. For some, alas! through those few yearsâ€” Of mates that knew our love, Had wearied of this place of tears, And sought for rest above. And all of us that cling to life, Mates in that happy band, Have wandered forth to meet the strife That waits on mortal kind. With hope and love of guileless hearts We met, then went the other day, Trusting to meet and never part Where is eternal day.
