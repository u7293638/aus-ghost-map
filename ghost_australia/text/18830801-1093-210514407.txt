THE DREAMER. • The Dreame* sits in the shadow. While the great world spins and spins, Bearing its burden of sorrows. And joys, and virtues, and sins. The soldier hears the trnmpet. And marches forth to the fight; The mariner spreads hi3 canvas For his good ship's ocean flight ; ■ The milkmaid trips to the meadow, With her dtool and her milking-pail; And rises the hymn of Labor Frotn city, and hill, and vale. But the Dreamer sits In the shadow, To Trim earth's sounds but seem As the murmur of far-off music —And he weaves them into his dream. " Come forth from the shadow, Dreamer, Ana take thy part in the strife!" Cries the soldier, pausing in battle, —And a bullet has found his life. «' Why sit in the shadow. Dreamer V Is heard the mariner's mock —And his ship, that has weathered ahnndred storms, Is split on a harbor rock. " Come forth from the shadow, Dreamer, 1 he maiden merrily sings, —And she hears a word of her father's love That her heart to its centre stings. *' Come forth from the shadow, Dreamer S" Labor was made for all 1" —And with knell of doom on the laborer's head The work of his hands doth fall. But the Dreamer sits in the shadow, The voices to him but seem As the murmur of far-off music —And he weaves them into his dream, Yet ill is it with thee, Dreamer! In the shadow sitting secure^ While the children of toil over earth and sea Must suffer, and weep, and endure, If theirs be the cup of sorrow. They have hope for the anodyne, And through the robe of the darkest cloud The star of love can shine. Though their lives be tales of anguish, Though their ways with thorns be sh-ewed, For a Purpose Eternal they yet are linked In the bonds of brotherhood. Then, Dreamer, come forth from the shadow, Ere thy air-built castles fade, And tny soul is left like a lonely ghost To wail in unending shade! Bat the Dreamer sits in the shadow; To him my words but seem As the murmer of far-off music —And he weaves them into his dream 1 —E. B. Loughran, in the Australasian.
