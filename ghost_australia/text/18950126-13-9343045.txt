j ABOVE THE SPEAKER, j BY TIMOTHKUB. "Tiiiiothoiis placed on high " The last week of the House was A weary time, a weary the, House glazed euch bleary eye ' To sit every day, to sit for twelve, fourteen, | and fifteen hours, to sit in a vitiated atmosphere, is to subdue the strongest. No wonder that at the last one part of the I Assembly would have passed almost any bill, and another port would have dropped almost as) And the exertion is all pure waste When you see a "Puffing Billy,' you see a machine that is not doing its work properly There is a deal in the suggestion, a great deal, that speeches should be limited for it is the unconscionable bores who do all the mischief- the unconscionable bores who are always with a Parliament Kee cr, to the intense suffering of all concerned, were the bores more rampant than during these dog days Members who would not pick a pocket think nothing of stealing their fellow members time If the session is one of 65 day school is a long session that is a day per member, or say eight hours talk for each representative Why, Mr Maloney has had 80 hours and Mr Grey 00 What a change what a sweet and beneficial change that American practice would make under which each member has his time allotted to him and when he has no more unless a fellow member gives up his share to the orator Mr Gray would exhaust his share the first fortnight of the session-and his fellow members would go about sending Imagine the hon. member begging his fellow representatives to surrender their time allowance to him. There is just one line in Canning, "knitegnnder which describes the situation, the line where human nature at last asserts itself in the philanthropist and he exclaims I give thee sixpence Wretch! I will see them d d first 1 One can imagine even the courteous Mr Murray Smith prefixing some adjective c to the announcement of his decision not to give one of the bores so much as five minutes Con Usually this week the House has heard the members it does not want to hear, and has been deprived of hearing the members to whom it would wish to listen The session closes with the Turner Government in power even after their Budget disaster Not often does a. Ministry survive the wreck of its financial proposals-more cape emily if it has to adopt in the main the plans of its opponents for the Patterson policy was the retrenchment and income tax ' scheme of to day That resignation of Mr Turner consequent upon the huff with the labour purry saved him The Opposition commended the pluck of the Premier, and the labour party saw the necessity of abating its demands and altering its tone The sham crisis came on the eve of the real crisis and averted it. If the episode was a stroke of polio, it was the cleverest of nil cases If it was an accident, it was the luckiest of chances The House closes split up into sections The Gov eminent have a steady band of supporters who will go with them almost nil) - where Mr Grose, Mr Gurr, Mr Baker, and others might be called the Anti Patterson section The Labour Corner is only semi friendly-but it plainly sees that more is to be got out of the Turner Government than out of any other There are great potentialities in the Opposition Corner, where the country party arts, and it that party obtained a capable and attractive leader, why, the future-the early future-would belong to it The direct or Patterson Opposition is scant It would be idle to say that Sir James has gained as much with the one crowd during the BOSBIOII as Mr Turner has with the other crowd But Sir James Blevins was one of the men who showed better in action than in counsel the Opposition Corner is bigger than the Government Corner, but the direct Opposition has no show in numbers with the Ministerial benches So far it cannot be said that any great reputations have been foreshadowed among the new members But great reputations come slowly) It was a matter of time before Mr Higinbotham, Sir Graham Berry, and Mr Gillies asserted themselves No one has made such an oratorical splash as did Mr Shiels but then it was a splash There are recruits of whom really sound hopes may be entertained, some Australian colts of good promise, only it is too early to speak the bores, alas I always make their existence known at once The value of one group of new members, a group which seem to promise the most is most unfortunately discounted by the fact that they have taken up the Henry George idea Messrs Irvine, A W White, and Brake are in this combination They have ability), they can talk, they know the country, but this fatal idea crops up with them in all sorts of unexpected places Strange that young men should be captured by an exploded idea,' for the Henry) George doctrine is only a jabbering ghost from an ancient " tomb The bondage can scarcely last But at present these members and others are hampered when they advocate tariff reform for men see Henry George behind the movement And they are crippled in demanding railway relief-for men see Hear) George there also If they could only drop the dolorous re actionary cry of tax the land and join in the joyful and forward appeal of " free the land this group would become a power in Parliament he) might be the pride of the country party Now they are its great em harrassing nt The Trades Hall Corner has more than its quota of young men Many of them. such as Messrs Hamilton and Cook, are full of gush, have ee idea of) the firmest belief in their views and doctrines, and the poorest ideas of their opponents'. All this is natural enough What is astounding is the small ness of the stock of political knowledge with which they have started in life They touch public matters in the jumbled fashion in which Mark Twain edited an agricultural journal, so that often one can only smile at the blunders On) the other day one of their number was " pitching into theGovernmentahurricnne, ashisspeeehwoa described, because the state has ยฃ2,000,000 of the trust funds invested-as though every) penny of the remaining Li 000,000 ought not to have been invested also And then, in imputing conspiracies and motives to the classes, they believe the incredible It is sad to think of their future if they continue as they are they are " boy politicians If the) grow vv mer and net upon their knowledge they will drop out of their places If the) grow wiser and do not act upon their knowledge they become demagogues Odd indeed is the question which has divided and which still divides the new Assembly There was a bitter -unrest among historians and nntiQiinriuna a decade or two back as to the condition of the English peasant in the 10th century, Professor Thorold Rogers It vdingolT Such a dispute could be understood But surely the Victorian Assembly) should know something certain of the condition of the Victorian farmer Is he the man as he should be taxed or is he the man who should be spared " From morn till (dewy) eve, every day and every night, has this issue been more or less de ยก baled Is the farmer a man who works : hand, who is heavily) mortgaged, who has a little to show for his mortgage, who is in doubt as to his future His country party asserts that he Is Or in he a snug and cann) individual, driving his smart buggy and his well led pair when he is abroad and smiling to himself at home when he thinks how he has robbed labour and when taking out a his bunk book he notes the awa Hing growth of " the unearned increment This is the view of the labour group In nine cases out of ten the way to town a Scotchman" really angry) is to assert that Wallace was a shop j lifter and not a patriot And the way to induce the Labour party to allow genuine ยก earnest that, the fight of enthusiasm and conviction is to declare that the former is a victim as against their con Motion that he is an oppressor I The session opened with this strife It closed with it 'drive the mallee holders their freeholds exclaimed the country party) this week 'Give more opportunities, you mean for plundering the people, retorted the Ministerial corner If we only find a Czar here occasionally 1 Such an autocrat would probably invite Mr Trenwith Mr Hancock Mr Prendergast, and their Winds to earn their Heine's during the recess on a village settlement how this would brace up and pull don in the ministry for lViolaoni) How it would improve the liver and the temper of the member for North Melbourne How it would I change the complexion and the Rev WE of the miner r for Richmond I long hot tells of an English Premier who, in answer to the remark that Parliament has! done nothing, n piled with surprise, 1 Him nothing' Hu) have supposed it ! This Parliament therefore, has done Home thing He limit Ministry remains and the Income Tax
