SELECT POETRY. SPOKEN IN ABNGER. 'TwAs but a little word in anger spoke, While proud eyes flashed through bitter burning tears; But oh, I felt that fatal word had broken The cord of love that bound our hearts for yars. The tortured face, that long, wild look of a irrow, Like some pale ghost, must haunt me while I hle; And yet, how bright, how full of joy the morrow, HaId I but breathed one simple word " Forgtve !" I did not hear the tender voice appealing, Nor marked thy-anguish when I cried, "Depart!" Too blind to see. thy pitying glance, reveal ing The generous promptings of thy noble heart. How could I know that faithful hearb was yearning, Thlleugh crushed and wounded to its in most core, To take me.back, like a weary bird return ing, In fear and trembling, when the storm is o'er. " Remember, love, that it may be forever; To see my face no more by night or day. Be calmhn, rash heart, think well before we seover, Recall the angry word and bid me stay." Dead silence fell; the song-birdshushed their singing. "Enough," I proudly cried; " I chose my fate." While even through my maddened brain kept ringing Tho death.knoll of my love-too late, too late ! "Forgive, forgive," I wailed, the wild tears streaming, As, 'mid themoaning trees, I stood alone; "Love, let they kisses wake me from my dreaming." Thy pleading voice, thy tortured face, was gone. That angry woril, I may recall it never; For o'er thy narrow grave rankweeda have grown. " Rlcmembor, love, that it may be forever." Ah, words prophetic! love, had I but known ! "My looks are gray, my eyes are dim with weeping, - rhe face once loved by thee no longer fair! Beneath the daisies thou art calmly sleeping; There a lone woman often kneels in prayer. Ah ! sweetheart mine, thou art so lowly lying, Thou canst not .hear the tearful voice above, That with the light wind evermore is sighing, -" I spoke in anger; oh, forgive me, love ."
