POLITICAL. IT is understood every member of the soli- darity ~ Latour;party will take part in the campaign against the election of the Post- master-General. : , . . ..,.,../, It is thought the Premier will be returned by a larger majority than at the general election, and it is the general opinion that Messrs. A. G. Taylor (journalist) and Foran (gentleman) who have been put-up in oppo- sition, have not the ghost of ashow, as many votes which were previously cast for Labour will be given to the Premier in preference to either of his opponents. It is stated Mr. Taylor comes forward as "an opponent of Mr., Reid's actions and tactics, and to strike an effective blow at Government House con- spirators," In flict, the opposition is looked upon by tho intelligent portion of the com- munity as a huge burlesque. / Another caucus of the solidarity party was , held ; at Parliament House. Alt the members ' of the. 'party were ? present ; and lifter some discussion, which it is understood did not partake of a contentious nature, it was unanimously decided to appoint Mr. M'Gownn tb theleadershlp. With regnard to the re-election of Ministers, it was decided to oppose no one but Mr. Cook, and that the opposition to him should be understood to be an emphatic and official protest against the general impression that in selecting Mr. Cook as one'of his colleagues Mr. Reid had included a "labor " member in his Cabinet. Mr. Cook is, therefore, to be opposed not as Mr. Cook, hut merely as a Minister, whom the solidarity party has thought it worth while to stigmatise as ." bogus," and especi- ally lest anyone should think that in turning him into a Minister of the Crown Mr. Reid had displayed an honest desire to get in touch with the " genuine " labor party. Mr. N. Melville has received a strong invitation to oppose Mr. Cook, hut has declined. Messrs. Brunker, Carruthers and Garrard were elected unopposed. ; '
