A .?acnaouso De.oeroxo.-The Gloen Innoes Guar dion of Saturday last relates an inrtance of one of those pecolior opidemics brought about by persistent study of the scriptures. In this case a rather reso pootablo, and apparently voory intolligont.lookling man, was boharged with being doflaiont of the intolloot necessary to justify him being at largo. HIowevor, the modfial ovidone and the man s own conduct, went to ashow that he was a fit subljoot for being in posoession of his libehorty, and that the only imbohecilo trlit in his eoharaoter was on religion. Acoording to what he essorted, he bhas a conviotion that he is to reeolvo the Inoarnotion, and it is his duty to abstain from servitude until this promise which has been made to him by the Almighty has been fulfilled; he also states that he has fasted for forty days, and that he never colicits food from any one, and moroly eats when it is given to him. Of oourse, it is by no means feasible to snppose that it would be possible for any parson to fast from food for suoh a period, but it is said by those who are acquainuted with this individual that he hoas boon known to fast for a week at a time, On being disoharged from the onurt he immediately took his departure, we presume to the bush again, whore in iall probability he will ulti mately eonoumb to exhaustion for the want of the nooessarios of lifo, and add one more to the number of those-perhaps sincere, but misguided oreatures, who are misled by some powerful delusion in connoo* tion with what they supposed to be religion. ATTo?oo, A'T POo80NINe.- The Bondigo Advoer tisor reports that on Friday afternoon a marinostorer dealer in Mo Ivor-stroot, Sendhnret, named WV. Whitting, attempted to poison himself. Ht is given to drink, and in consequence quarrels between him and bis wife have beeoon frequent. On the afternoon in question, while under the ilnfluence of liquor, he had somosuth'domostio difference, and seizing hold of a phial ontaininog halfa wineglass full of aqua fortis, throotoned to drink it, but his steopdadghter snatched the bottle from him and put it aseide. A few minutes afterwards he again got hold of it, and the stepdaughter, who was in a back room, came out juet in time to soo him drain the last drop of the dreadful poison. tIe immediately sat down and asked for water, and the young girl, with great pro. sonoa of mind, thought of eomoething for ap emetto, and gave him a drink of salt and water, which oaused him to vomit. In the meantime, one of her brothers was sent to the Friendly Societies' disponsary, which waso not far off, and asked for on omotio, stating that his father had swallowed on acold for oloaneing gold. Mr. Blaook, the dispenser, euspooting that the aold was aoq/uafortls, sent the proper remedy, and it was eagerly taken by the misguided man, who had begun to soe hie folly ahd to repent of it. Dr. Hood was also soon in attendance, and eoverything was done to counteraoet the effocts of the poison. List ovening therodtd not appear much hope of his rocovery, and noting under advice he made his will. It seems that he had on former oooaslone, when in drink and paes sion, throatened to take hise lifo in' a elsimilar way. The aqupfortis was used in his trade, and it could not always be Ikeopt out of hise way.

On Thorsday lest, the matter was brought urnlder the notion of the Logislaotive Assombly. On that evening, reports the Argus, Mr. Stowart called the attontion of the minister of lands to the ndvn. tngos given to solootore In Now South Wales, and to the oxodus of formers from Victoria Into that colony and to the desirablonoss of the early Introduction of an amodinog land bill to glve an In?lorousod tre to settlers here. Large numbers of agriculturists were crossing the border into New Sooth Wales, booause the area of land they could takie up hero was too emall for themo, and becauseoo io Now South W?nles they could select 320 aores, and got a grrazing lease over three timos that quantity of lend. In reply, Mr. Caseoy (minister for lands) said he weas aware that a considerable number of persons wore crooeing the border into Now South Waule, but he believed they were not what might be called agricultural settlers, butsimplyeqnatters. ("No.") Thebo area of seleo. lion in New Sooth Wales was only the same as in Victoria, namely, 320 acres; but Now South Wales soleotore wore permitted to tarke up more land under a grazing lieounse. Land, however, taken up under that grazing license could be s'oleoted by anybody olse. The soleotors only had an exclusire right over 320 oacres. The amendingland bill would be introduced as soon as the state of the business por mitted. Tile TUtva Broir Or ?UCle.r,"Y'O ' WLL.-The "claimant" Mauor, whose title to the property of the late Patrick Cody Buokley, has left Wagga WVagga with the intention we believe of assorting his rights to this valuable estate. Several versions of the story of Bunokley's will have gone the rounds of the papers, and the latest is the following, contained in a letter addressed to the editor of the Frooman'e Journal:-I observed in the Empire of July 2ud a paragraph headed as above. I only wish to state, as the next of kin and heir-at-law of the estate, that the whole statement in the said paper is utterly without foundation, as can he proved by many per sons now resident in Virtoria. In the first instanoo, his name was not Patrick Buokley, that was only an assumed name adopted by him in the colony of Vio toria. Both of his parents having died In Ireland previous to his leaving there, he was then adopted by a Mres. Oody, who after the death of bher husband again married a person named Buokloy. His mother did not die in this colony at all she died, as before stated, in the county of Oork, parish of Desert, near Blanden, Ireland, in the year 1823, about two yoeare before he (Patriok Buokloy) loft Ireland for the colonioe. So that it can be plainly ebown that the story of the will is a base fabrication to triolc those rightfully entitled to the estate out of it, if they can. You will greatly oblige by inserting this, as it will show the truth of the case.

MUDneuoUes AeOAULT.-Tho Maitland Mercury of Tuesday states that on Saturday afternoon informa. tion reacohed Senior- sergeant Kerrigan from Mr. p. Green, J.P., that a man was in his oustody at Mount Eeuntly, near Lochinvar, for attempted murder, and requesting that two policemen should be sent out to have the man safely oonfiood in the lookup. Im mediately upon receipt of this information, Bergeant Kerrigan and Mlountod- trooper Gamble started for Mount HIuntly, and on arrival there ascertained the nature of the assault committed. The name of the man in custody is Julius A. Menotory, and the viotim of the outrage is Mr. Walter Groen, son of Mr. Poter Green. The particulars of the outrage, so far as we have boon able to aeoortain, are as follows: slonotery, who is a foreigner, was employed by.Mfr. Green in doing some work, by contract, in connection with his wine-pressing establishmont. On Saturday last, after he had beeoon at work some time, Meoetory initatod a dispute by demurring to certain work he had to perform, alleging tlat it wase not in his agreement; and although Mr. Groeon oifferedrto meet any objection the man might have by paying for any work not in the agreement, Menotory was dissatislled, and in the course of dispute called Mr. Green a liar. Mr. Walter Green, who was standing olose by, upon hearing his father thus addressed, interposed on his behoalf, whereupon the. man attuacked him, and throw him down a cemented underground well or tank, upon the edge of which he was standing. This tank is eleven feeoot deep, twelve feeoot across, and had between eight and nine feet of water in it at the time. As Mr. Green was falling into the tank, Menotory caught hold of him, and jumpod in the water with him. A lifo and death struggle followed in the water. Monotery~, who was the etrongest of the two, kept Mr. Green under the water, and, as alleged, by catching hold of him by the throat nod board, endeavoured to drown him. Neither were able to got out of the well, or tank, and Monotory apnpoared to devote his whole energies to assaulting his victim and keeping him under the water. Mr. Peter Green, unfortunately, was quite unable to render his son any asesistance, owing to hiesleg being broken and having to walk on orutohee. Ho offered his crutch to hise son, but the unfortunate young man could not avail himself of it, being under the water, and prevoented from taling hold of it by Monotory. The situation of affaire was becoming painfully perilous. Mr. Greeoon was loolting at his e ,n being murdered, almost within roaoh of his arm and was utterly powerloess to render help, He coul I have krilled the ruffian with a singlo blow 'of his crutob, but this would probably have involrd the sacrifieoo of his son's life. He could only ory for help, and his crios brought some of his workmen to the scone. Once on risiong to the surface again, however, Mr. W. Groon managed to lay hold of the crutch held out by hise father, and by the aesletanoe of the workmen the rmlan and his intended victim were separated in the wt5.er, just in time to save Mr. Groen's life, and brought to the bank. Mr. Waltar Green was quite oexhausted on being taken out of. the water, and was almost insencibleo Mr. Poter Green had reoeivod some severe wounds on the chest (which was againost the raised brickwork at the edge of the tank) through Monetory, who had hie foot aginst the wallof the tank, tugging violently at Mr. Walter Green while he had hold of his father's orutch. Monetory was at once secured, and Mr. Groon dospatobod a messenger to Seniror-sergeant Kerrigan, who arrivedr shortly before duskc, and took Monetery into canstody, Hes was then escorted into Maitland, and securoly lodged in the lookup at East Maitland, brought up at the temporary court-house, West Maitland, aid charged with having committed an assault with intent to murder. As Mr. Grooeen was unable to: attend, and Bonior-sergeoant Kerrigan was engaged' at a coroner's inquest, prisoner was remanded, on the application of Seaior.constable Maguire, till Thursday next. We heard, yesterday, that' ir.' Peter Greeoon was suffering severely from the wound he had received.
