THE CEADOCK GHOST. \--TO THE EDITOB. Sixâ€” Will yon allow me space to correct Mr. Jones's statement in reference to the Bmelling-aalta or hartshorn that he used Diettv freely instead of hia thumb and knife? wnerj ne uaea me inermometericwaaaippea in the hartshorn. I am prepared to prove that the raps did come when the phosphorus was on the child's hands. At th6 same time Mr. Jones asked a question in French and waB answered correctly, the child knowing nothing about the language. On that terrible occasion the fingernails were used pretty freely at pinching, but it failed to wake her, although the next day black marks were to be seen. Let Mr. Jones rap his knuckles on lampblack and see if it produces the same effect as it did on the little girl's. There ia a great difference between rapping on it and rubbing it on. Mr. Jones did not state what he had in his hand when he slid it under the clothes. Ab it waB a very late hour when the servant girl went to bed the raps were all orer. As for the rapping when Sissy'a brother was in bed with her, Mr. Jones had not the nerve to lie down with her. His letter is composed of untruths, although he found himself completely mastered and is ashamed to own the truth. ' \ lam, Sir, &a;, ' A. SCHL7LTZE, ; Father of the ahfld. Uroonda, July 6.
