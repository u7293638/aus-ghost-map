ANO'THER -GIOST0 ANISHES. For some time Malew, l1, the Isle of Man, has boasted of a ghost haomting its parish church. The spectre was said to walk nightly up the aisle, candle in hand. Eveur the vicar of the parish, tWe Rev. Mr. t'plcer, had to confess that, he saw a mysterious light, moving fronm the doorway end of the churcis to the chancel, and then vanishing. But in place of attributing it to ghosts he searched for a more prosaic explanation and found it. The light comes froan the distant revolving beams of the Langoess Lighthouse. The light cannot be seen from the road, but the church stands on a slightly higher level, and Its windows just catch the rays as they swing slowly round.
