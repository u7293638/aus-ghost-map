CONFIRMATION AT ST. MARY'S CHURCH. On Sunday the Right Reverend Dr. Goold, Archbishop of Melbourne, attended at the above Church to administer the sacrament of confirmation. There was a large attendance, the church being crowded in all parts. The Rev. J. J. McGillicuddy celebrated high mass. After mass, His Grace proceeded to address the congregation. In the course of his exhortation he said he was about to administer one of these splendid gifts which God had placed at their disposal, and assured them that the sacrament of con- tirtation ,was not the least efficacious for their salvation. It was further more indis- pensable that those who had the opportunity of receiving this sacrament should do so.
