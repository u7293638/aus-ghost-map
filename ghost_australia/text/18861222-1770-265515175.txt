Two days after Christmas, Mel's father was unexpectedly called away. Mel, who rule to tbe station with bim, on returning, took the Markey and me into "the cottage," as we called tbe detached roomwhere we bacbelors slept. Mei drew a letter from his pocket, saying: " Bead this." It was from Mis. Crabb, our landlady, who complained to Mel that his friend ME. Tower* owed hex tor a month's lodgiag; and, in addition, he had stolen a travelling nig of ben and that unless tbe money was paid and tbe nig xetoraed within two days, proceedings would be taken. "We haven't been to the station once we came up; tbe two days have npiiwl; what •hall we do !

" What in the name of common sense made you fritter away your month's screw in racquets and hammocks I" demanded Mel. " I wanted to bring something to amuse the girls. Mrs. Crabb knows that I mean to pay her. I always do pay once a month, only not in advance." But about the rug 1" I asked. " This is it." The Matkey lifted it off his bed. " The rug was kept on a conch in my room : bow can it matter to ber whether I use it either here or there 1" said theMarkey in an injured tone of voice. . ."

Mel aaid, " I with the gorsnor would cwme botce," said I went into the to wander kmr I codii rxim tame money. I saw Maiy sitting under the Tine-ocrvered milis, her bead upon ber outspread arms on the rustic table. At tbe moooiigbt rerealed hsr dejected attitude, it occurred to me that if *-1 weetiftamng" wac cheap to Mei, ertcab nae dse was finding that it owt dsar. As I watched, a figure appeared on the path. It was the Marker. Bareheaded, dripping with water, like an apparition, he appeared before tbe girL She lifted her hswL and Etansd, then gave a fearful scream- He sprang forward, but I burned him into the shadow of the meek tree, and calling him a few uncomplimentary names, ordered bint bade to the Poppy can -to mmfart Mary, who kept on toUmg, " He it dead, I saw his gho6t, he has been drowned," Tins madeMe] and me unhappy; we spent the next morning on tbe island abusing tbe Rarkev. " If you must see the giil,oomeaEa man; do something to prove you are not a ghost," said Mel; and that same night the wretch obeyed him. I was on the verandah, trying to cheer Maty, when a figure appeared the other side of ber hammock. As she sat up her eyes dilated with horror. The Maikey put lug band on ber shoulder; and, giving her the most ungfaooly ld« possible, vanished from the verandah. I was paralysed with indignation. Mary was in tears. Again 1'oppy flew to tbe rescue, at whose side of cause was Mel, who enquired anxiously, "the JJarkey't ghost, what did he say T' '-Nothing," sobbed Mary. "Whatdid he dor " He—be kissed me!" " Ob! surely not, you screamed, and I kissed you," said Poppy, trying to improve matteis. " Poppy, yon—you haven't a moustache," came in tiagic tones from the hammock. When Mel and I next saw the Madcey, we bullied bim in earnest. " I thought it the simplest way without speaking to show ber that I wasn't dead," was his sole apology. \- T.iu certainly are a first-class idiot," said Mp^ "you must give me your word not to leave the island until X ^ ^ you; my father will be home to-day, I will send HIE. Crabb her money to-night, and then come I for you." The Marker gave us his word not to leave the island until called for. He borrowed Mel's gun explaining that any report would merely be thought some one duck shooting further down stream. Mr, Moors returned at mid-day. Mel borrowed the money, and .sent it with interest to Mrs. Crabb, but after we returned from the station, it was too late to go for the Marker, : We were saying "good night" to the girls on tbe verandah, whan Maty, suddenly dutching my arm, whispered, "his ghost 1 see, his ghost 1" fiuie enough there stood the Markcy., 1 wae wfld at his breaking bis; wonl. 1 oould fee that Mel bad the game < ^ > lfa£ ^ e ^ o E a f t e a ^ ; for <b fax esBoacsK fix roCTK Ksxrr 9K iiaSr. aas ncnssSes ! sps&qpeE; saS on; i«aa«abae.
