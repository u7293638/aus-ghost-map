A QUADRUPLE EXECUTION AT BANKOK. The culprits were four : an incen diary, sentenced to have his hand-cut off; a murderer, to be ripped open ; the third, a political offender, to be delivered to wild beasts; and the forth, a blasphemer, to have his head burnt off. The executioners made full speed, grinding the axes and sabres, dressing the furnace, and preparing the bellows. The incendiary came first and tendered his wrist, and his hand immediately was seen flying in the air. This multilation did not seem to affect him much, for lie went amongst the crowd to witness the fol lowing executions. The murderer takes a seat on a stone, and whilst I they are cutting into his abdomjn he keeps biting a banana ; the sufferer is then seen to gnash his teeth, and, under horrible convulsions, loses the banana and sinks to rise no more. The traitor to the King meanwhile is looking down a den speaking to the tigers, and recommending them to sharpen their appetites. The executioners seize him, pass a rope under his arms, and lower him slowly into the horrible hole, after which they slowly draw the rope up. Then we hear, says M. Chaulnes, an eye-witness, something like muffled crepitation ; from time to time a human form is seen jerked up; the breaking of the skull aud the thigh bones is distinguishable. The wild beasts are roaring all 'the time, but' no human cry is audible. As for the sacriligious criminal, the executioners tied him on a plank, and placed his head between two coal- pans. They then work the bellows and direct jets of flame on the culprit's head, who continues singing what is supposed to be an impious or blasphemous song. His temples are blistering under the darts of fire, and yet he continues his psalmody. Mean while his body writhes in awful con vulsions, his eyes are bleeding, his bones cracking, and he finally gives up the ghost with a fearful yell.
