BICYCLING IN FRANCE. For little tours in France the bicycle offers almost ideal pleasure. The French interest in cycling amounts to a mania ; the roads are universally good ; France is an old, thickly settled country, abounding at once in the beauties of modern cultivation and the romantic remains of the past ; and, lastly, a tour in France can be better made ' en bicyclette ' than in any way. From Paris through the wine districts and garden of France, to the Atlantic Ocean at the borders of Spain, through the Pass of the Pyrenees and over the mountain spurs of Castile to Madrid, every city is a museum, every village a ghost of other ages. In the level part of France—and France is level through- out, except in the south and east—the pleasures of cycling are without even the alloy of easy but steady mountain climbing. The bicyclist spins along, past country houses and chateaux, past soldiers sitting in the sun, over stone bridges that have seen five centuries, into remnants of forests where the kings of France once hunted deer. He will meet couples riding horseback, couples in dog carts, couples on bicycles. He will see the peasants at their work in the fields ; he will pass vineyards and orchards and eat of the fruit thereof ; and he will rest himself in the quaintest species of cafes, taverns and hotels. Throughout all he will find com- panions of many nationalities, and the poss- ession of a common fad will break the ice of reserve between strangers in a way not to be hoped for by mere tourists on a railroad —Paris Corr.
