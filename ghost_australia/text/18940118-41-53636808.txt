CYCLORAMA. Last night there was another large attendance of spectators at the Cyclorama, and in addition to the beautiful representation of Waterloo and the illusion of Napoleon's ghost there was produced for the second time in Adelaide the wonderful "Fountain of laughing waters." This found very great favour with the patrons, who as the different effects were produced heartily applauded. The glorified shower-bath undergoes many changes of form and colour while the rest of the building is in darkness. Jets rise sometimes to a height of 60 ft., with smaller ones playing round them. The effect is most beautiful where the light plays on the spray at the top of the fountain. Such a fine production as this, despite its formidable name— "Hydatapikilumina"—is well worth seeing, and people anxious to conserve their powers of speech will be quite justified in calling it simply the "Fountain of laughing waters" All this beauty is got out of ordinary cold water, and a sight of the spectacle would make even a hydrophobias forget his natural antipathy.
