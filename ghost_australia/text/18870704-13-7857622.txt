St Marks us approached in the dark nose of a Sunday evening in winter, seems to be away in a mare of narrow streets amongst the westward extensions of the city Low and poor looking houses fence it in May of the Streets are broken up, all of them are very muddy, and in open spaces there are unfinished brick wall and HcatToldings and cities of in) our mind progress Risca dent!) tim co re of a word ing district and has been described recently by advertisement an 1 otherwise, as the centre of some active religious work V mission is in progress at St Mark a A ' missioner is in charge of what the Salvation Army would call the campaign, and the work has been going on from very early morning till late evening every day for a week The " missioner is the Ven.

As the Psalms of the day are begun a slight innovation is observed The minister of the parish, not the tall clergyman, chants the first verse of each Psalm alone, the choir taking up the second 'there does not seem to be much gained by this new arrangement I of the minister had a fair voice it affords him a little opportunity of course, but it would be impertinent as absurd to accuse a clergyman of making or seeking opportunity of personal display) All the ministers and all the members of the choir unredressed well at St Mark's The boys and their surplices seem very well washed, and generally the rendering of the service would be creditable man) church of any fashionable suburb The hymns are not in accord with the other portions of the musical service They are distinct) revival late ; word and not have been w edged with emotional intent I heard two of them on the platform of the Salvation Army a week or two ago They are intended for the whole congregation, and are sung by the whole congregation in slow time and with evident pleasure And there are a good many of them so sung before the service is closed. It is a somewhat singular experience in an Anglican church to listen to a hymn which is really a sacred song with a chorus, and at its close to see a priest mount the pulpit, face right round to the east, and pronounce the words, " in the name of the rather, the Son, and the Holy Ghost, Amen " He does not pronounce the names, however-that comes with music from the choir, nor yet does he bless himself in the usual Roman Catholic fashion, us he repeats what will be admitted to be a portion of the Roman Catholic ritual. He takes from any source what seemeth him good the Roman Catholic Cathedral or the Army) Barracks, It matters not which-and in preaching he will not be as other ministers of his church, that is clear. He had no written sermon and no great Bible ; but, first, he will exhort all who propose to work through the mission to meet and organise, and then, searching out a text from a little pocket Testament, proceeds with what must be considered a very remarkable sermon The text is from the Gospel of St Matthew" The Kingdom of Heaven is like unto a treasure md in a field, the which when a man hath found he fadeth, and for joy thereof goeth and selleth all that he bath and buyers that field " The text opens the way for much practical and simple illustration, upon which the missioner immediately proceeds. He is realistic in her delineation. He will bring " the East," the Scripture country, before his audience He will show the conditions of Ino which rendered the story of the text probable, and then will realise the man himself ploughing In some poor paddock, striking the treasure trove, going straightway about his business of purchase, and securing to him self the field with all its contents It is not exactly) preaching, this portion of the sermon, but plain talk, or Sunday) school or Bible class teaching exceedingly plain and practical, and leading up line upon line, to some evident lesson Clover lately side Tula are thrown out It used to be difficult for Englishmen to travel In the Past., bills the missioner, because all the Eastern peoples had a fixed notion that Englishmen could discover gold or treasure wherever it was held, and perhaps they were not very fat wrong There is a difficulty also about the morality of the transaction with the held of the parable "which, probably is quite justifiable At any rate, it is what mile men out of ten would have done The application of the parable proceeds in more earnest manner in join art a prosperous successful. man, you mean to he Biic.LCS'diil you perform all the labour of your life with mer diligence BY all Every thin., but one small in after one little del I In the brohad firm, intent is loitered over in the most indolent and perfunctory) manner A on any a little attention to it because it has always been minded to your life It is rch "ion You know that if you were as careless over your business as your rely on you would be in the Bud ruptt) Court in a month Now, why, you Inialmas men, you who are thorough in every other respect we) do JOH 11 up to this business of religion at all As he not do it thoroughly or have it altogether' The question was put in hand, plain prac tica) fashion and the sermon would have been more effective perhaps had it been allowed to rent it as a question, for the answers presently BUtgerted did not seem to be b used upon a very clear idea of the binnum in in a notions or methods of roane mug It is not a matter of sentiment that kit p him to his formal w worship not the association of curly and tender memories not usually the lingering belief that the church may be useful some day, some un certain du) when the facts of the world shall show a tendency to slip a u), but rather the irresistible compulsion of fashion It is respectable to go to church, and is not as a Jubilee) Tchovuh to the order filly no less business man' He keeps the poor child, his religion or his church, and feed them over with half minute prayers and infrequent gcnullcxiona and the other with threepenny contributions and meng r o paw tents, because It is considered respectable BOY to do That is the one main bond of attachment to the poor field But what of the treasure! What was it? How, when was it to be found' At this point did the missioner begin to preach. There was no doubt whatever about the treasure, it was the reality of the living Christ buried in whatever poor field of form or doctrine Any man once making that discovery would sell all that he had to elect its purchases And how many had hold a! series ed nil The miBsioncrglanced down the roll of the noble army) of martial rs t rid touched briefly on H rate of the earth at a pr jtl s nut c ml soils these were the in n who had found the tree sun, and their returns showed how dearly they on ed it.

If it be a woman, a Salvation Army captain can act her to hang a tambourine, a Korean Catholic priest can persuade her to give all her goods to the church, and all her life to its convent service, an Anglican missioner can induce her to attend regularly 7 it in communion on winters mornings, and to give all her leisure, doubtless, to good church work We know that the Roman) Catholic Church has over had large success in this way), the im story and sensuousness of its services have had wonderful power over emotional minds, and the Salvation Army at the other extreme line of late years more than shared that success Methodism has also at various times prospered on it, and Anglicanism may, doubtless, if it care to condescend SO much, take now a little share. But plainly it does not seem a good thing to find men of such calibre as Archdeacon Julius bringing himself down to the level of this business. In his sermon he appeared as one who should be writing in the big reviews, not striking oil tract Society leaflets , as a preacher who should be ex- pounding hard matter to educated men, not telling little tales to simple folks and children.
