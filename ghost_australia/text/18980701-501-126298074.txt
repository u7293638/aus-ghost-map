A BLACKMAILER CAUGHT, j A member of tho infamous tribe known as blackmailers last week received his deserts at Nowcastlo. Ho selected for his victim a manager of a bank, and doubtless thought that as tho official occupied a respectable position be would make considerable sacri fices rather than any scandal, though it might bo only imaginary, connected with his name. So lie 'wrote a letter (under a false name) to tho proposed victim, de manding money under a threat of exposure if the demand wns not complied with. There aro men in tho world — people whose nature is weak and who have a fearful dread of being associated with any kind of a scandal involving sensual profligacy — who would havo attempted to make terms with the blackmailer, awl so have become his slavo for life. Not so tho hank manager, however. Ho '.promptly put the letter iu tho hands of the police, and tho latter, laying a trap for thu scoundrel who had written it, soon had him in their clutches. Wlion brought face to face with the judge, all the cowardice in his nature nt once came to the surface, and. he ninde a whining np peal for morey. Fortunately there wiis not tho ghost of a chance of the appeal being effective. And yet some sort of leniency was shown to the scoundrel, for ho was sentenced to only 2J years' imprisonment. Ho should hnve been sentenced to 50 lashes in addition. But comparatively light as the sentence was, : it will probably be a warning to the somewhat numerous body of persons in the colony, whoso dispositions and inclinationsVare similar to that of this despicable convicK^i-'BlackUiailing is n very risky game.
