Grant; of Laggan, records tho following incident on the authority of tho minister who related it to her. Ho wa3 accustomed, eho informs us, " to go forth and meditate at oron; and this solitary walk ho always directed to hi* churchyard, whioh was situated in a shaded spot, on tho banks of a river. There, in a dusky October evening, he took his wonted path, and lingered, leaning on the church yard wall, till it becamo twilight, when ho saw two small lights rise from a spot within, where there was no stone nor memorial of any kind. Ho observed tho course these lights took, and saw them cross tho river and stop at an opposite hamlet. Presently they returned, accompanied by a larger light, which moved on between thom till they ar rived at the place from which tho first two set out, when all three seemed to sink into the earth together. The good man went into the churchyard and throw a few stones on the spot whero the lights disappeared. Next morning ho walked out early, called for the sexton, and showed him the place, asking him if he remembered who was buried there. The man said that, many years ago, he re membered burying in that spot two young children, belonging to a blacksmith on the opposite sido of tho- river, who was now a very old man. Tho pastor returned, and was scarce sat down to breakfast, when a message came to hurry Mm to come over to pray with tho smith, who had been suddenly taken ill, and died next day."-The Ltitufe Eour.
