RODNEY'S APOLOGY. I never yet took up my pen, To write of things sarcastic, But my better feelings have prevailed, I cannot be too drastic. Last week when Rodney wrote about The cricket team extante. It was my first reception as A poetic debutante. I do not strive to emulate World-famed historic sages, Nor did I seek to cause a stir, Per medium of these pages. I merely thought, perchance, to raise A little wild diversion ; Ne'er dreaming I'd be threatened with A water-trough immersion. Mac thinks he got off very well, Because his mite's not quoted ; The scribe, forsooth, was not aware He made one when he wrote it. Johnson says he knows quite well, Who wrote those lines sardonic ; His friendship though, the scribe retains, Pure, unalloyed, platonic. Barrister Jack vows to undertake Dire legal vengeance on me. Great shades ! I'd ten times sooner face The ghost of ancient Ptolemy. He swore to Macon Friday last, His oath he'd take most solemn, He did not know the writer of The verses in this column. Mac knows who writes o'er Rodney's name, " Yes, truly, Jack. I'll swear it. Just question him in Purves' style, And see if he can bear it." Pure jealousy, I've heard them say, Of Johnson's skill at cricket, Caused me to pen sarcastic lines Of his failure at the wicket. Alas ! for me, I cannot well This selfish tale refute ; M y personnel I must conceal, And remain at present, mute. They blame you, Gus, for what to me Is simply adoration ; I trust, indeed, you'll not succumb To this infatuation. 1 Tp Butler, Stokes, and all the team, i Tiiee fine s I do indite, And tr.«,<4 £>1 tnot sarcastic be When next oe'Leir J I Nbrt week, dear sir, with your invite, 1 A fe.w Jjnes I will send, Atxoiii A good-day's picnic to Tiae.wsfl-fcao-wj b<?nd.
