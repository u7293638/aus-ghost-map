The Courier. PUBLISHED DAILY. WEDNESDAY, NOVEMBER l8, 1868. Tue new Parliament formally com- menced its labors yesterday, by the mem- bers assembling in the Legislative As- sembly Chamber, taking the oath, signing the roll, and electing a Speaker. This business is generally dry and uninteresting, except when there happens to be a differ- ence of opinion among hon. members as to the person whom it is desirable to elect to the Speaker's chair. There was none yesterday, and the proceedings seemed a a trifle duller and more uninteresting than usual. The Premier, in a short and some what guarded speech, proposed the late Speaker to the office. Mr. Macalister, in an equally short and guarded speech, seconded the motion, which was thereupon carried by acclamation, and the new Minister for Works delivered the con- gratulatory address on the Speaker taking the chair. This address, too, by-the-way, was not a success. The Speaker tried a little joke to commence with, which did not tell very well, and then he struck out into eulogium and panegyric, evidently prepared beforehand, at which a few hon. members tried to look grave, but the ma- jority did not even attempt to do so. The feeling most prevalent with a con- siderable number of the members evidently was, that as no provision had been made for Mr. Eliott, in the event of his retirement from the office, it would be a great hardship to him, and unkind on the part of hon. members to elect another to the post until such provision was made ; but at the same time that there was no occasion for much bandying of compliments, and therefore the less said about the election the better. This was certainly the tone of Mr. Macalister's speech when seconding the motion for Mr. Eliott's re-election to the Speaker's chair. He (Mr. Macalister) denied that there had ever been any inten- tion on the part of the members of the Opposition to seriously oppose the appoint- ment ; but, from his subsequent remarks, it was pretty clear that this was mainly be- cause Mr. Eliott; had not been provided with a retiring allowance or a comfortable appointment. The increasing age and in- firmities of the Speaker no doubt render it necessary and desirable for the question of his retirement to be entertained, and perhaps the opportunity afforded yesterday of bringing it forward was as favorable as any which could be fouud. At the same time it is a disagreeable subject to discuss in the presence of the person most immediately interested, and more especially in a case like the present. The Speaker is a high-minded gentleman, whose long and faithful service, punctilious dis- charge of his duties, and courteous bearing, have won for him the respect of members on all sides of the House, and to even hint to his face that he was growing too old to continue in harness seemed harsh, and was no doubt painful to all present In return- ing thanks, Mr Eliott mentioned with just pride that " he had presided over twelve sessions of Parliament, and in no single instance had "he been absent from his post, either through sickness or from any other cause." He was the only member present who could truly say that he had been present at every sitting of the House since Queensland possessed a Parliament, and at first sight this would appear to be the best possible proof which could be given of his ability to still continue in the discharge of the duties pertaining to the office. But in reality it is rather a proof of his claims to the consideration of the country for services rendered. The wear and tear of physical and mental power from labor like his must have been ex- cessive, and the wonder is, that at the Speaker's years, he could have borne up under it so long and so well. Now, how- ever, it would not only be false delicacy, but something worse, to defer for any lengthened period the making of such re- compense for his long and arduous labors as will enable him to enjoy, for the remain- der of his days, that rest and quiet which he has so well and fairly earned. "Whether the proposal comes from the present or from some future Government is not a matter of consequence so long as it is made in time-certainly it ought to origi- nate with the Government for the time being, and not with a private member. To be sure the Speaker is the Chair- man and President of the House, and not the servant of the Ministry of the day, but at the same time a subject like this ought not to bo brought forward unless there is every probability of its being earned without much discussion, and a Ministry, whoever they may be, are in the best position for securing this result. Of course there is nothing to prevent a private member bringing forward such a motion at the request of the Ministry, but in that case it is essentially a Government proposal-just as much so in fact as it would be if it was made to the House by a Minister. Neithei is theie anything deiogatorj to either the Speaker or the House in considei mg «uch a question 1 he practice of grant- ing retiring pensions to Speakers for great length of service, or distinguished ability in the discharge of their duties, is as old as the office itself, in its present foi m ; and it has, under such circumstances, been alw ays regarded as alike honorable to tho=e who bestow and to him who ieceives The only possible evil which could arise from such an act would bo for it to come to be regarded as establishing a precedent by which all retiring Speakers w ould be justi- fied in claiming likeconsideiation In the present case, how ev er, there is no danger of any thing of the kind Mr Eliott has special claims to consideration which are not likely to be established as precedents, in this colony at any rate. He is our Gist Speaker, and has held the ofhce for twelve successive sessions, without any interruption, and without a single attempt being made by any section of the members of the three Parliaments, over which he has presided, to propose another candidate for the omce He has been most assi- duous in the discharge of his duties, and his decisions have always been received with respectful deflerence, and accepted as authoritative, even in cases where members have found it necessaiy to question their accuracy In othei words, he has been able to maintain the authority and dignity of the Speaker-a most necessary and essential element to the proper working of a deliberative Assembly of this kind The ofhce of Speaker is the most onerous and important which it is m the power of the House to bestow upon any of its mem- bers it requnes special qualifications which are not often found united m the same peison, when, therefore, the selec- tion proves to be so judicious, and the duties of the office are discharged for so long a time with such general satis- faction as they ha\ e been in the case of Mr Eliott, it is nothing moro than just and proper that his services should be recognised m a substantial manner, either by the granting of a pension or by some ] suitable appointment This is the more defensible from the fact that not only have the Government the opportunity of recog- nising services in the manner indicated, but both under the present and previous Ministries persons have been rewarded in such a manner who have not had one tithe of the claims which are possessed by Mr. Eliott. While therefore heartily joining in the hope that the present Speaker of the As- sembly may for many years to come enjoy the measure of health and strength which has hitherto fallen to his lot, we at the same time concur in the opinión expressed by- Mr. Macalister, yesterday, to the effect that the time has arrived when it is very desirable to make some provision for Mr. Eliott's retirement from the active duties of the office.

tinctly, and, owing to tho hall berne; so largo and ed empty, the echo was perfectly ear splitting, and rendered it impossible, even when quito close to the speaker, to hear two consecutive sentences

evidence showed that the £2000 was a debt owing to the defendants antecedent to the agreement which, it was alleged, nas entered into at the latter end of March to execute the bill of sale That docu ment ets forth that tho consideration consoled of current bils, drawn at date: antecedent to its execution, amounting to over £3500, and goods to the value of ¡£909 19s 8 which K Wilson stated were supplied at the ead of March The onlv other portion of the con ideration men tioncd in the bill of sale being a sum of £¿50 10s, this went to take up a promissory note of the defendants A oenkbai,

and ho fell on the fork, one of the prongs of which entered his body between the legs and passed upwards through his abdomen -for a distanco of some nine inches He lived in fearful agony for three hours, and expired i about 5 o'clock Immediately after the accident, I medical aid was sent for, and Dr Emmelhainz arrived at the »jene of the calamity shortly after 4 o'clock, and did all that was possible to relieve the sufferings of the unfortunate man The wound, however, was such that it could not but have had a fatal result under anv circum stan- cs The deceased was a fine young man, about twenty three vears of age, and was very well connected at home He had purposed pur chasing a farm himself shortly A magisterial enquiry was held yesterday bv Mr A M Francis, J F , of Oxlev Creek, and

Last evening a farewell supper was given to Mr Edward Burrowes by a number of his friends on the occasion of his leaving Brisbane A number of toasts and speeches complimentary to the guest of the evening were given The party broke up at an early hour, but with tho feeling that a very jolly evening had been spent bv all concerned During the week ending November 11, one female and two male patients were received into tho asvlum at Woogaroo , and one malo patient was discharged There are now 136 malo and 57 female patients in the asylum A meeting of tho stewards of the Warwick Christmas Haces was held at Mr Evendcn's Commercial Hotel, to draw up a programme, and decide as to the prizes to be offered Thero were present-Me srs Thornton, Balls, Hud son, Ransome, Daveney, Gill, and the secretary The following programme was decided upon - First Day A Maiden Plate of 20 sovereigns, with a sweep of 10 sovereigns for second horse, Hack Selling Bace of IO sovereigns, Publican's Purse of 1 sovereign each with 20 sovereigns added , Shearer's Purse of 5 sovereigns , and a Hurry Skurry of 5 sovereigns Second Day The Tradesmen s Purse of 10 sovereigns, Christmas Box of 5 sovereigns , Town Plate of 25sov and tho Forced Handicap of 5 sovereigns There are five races to be run for each day, and the added money amounts to £120 -Warwick Examiner, November 14 Mb Dollet, who we (Toowoomba Chronicle) mentioned some time since as having rust m his growing crop, has cut down ah ut one half of it for hay , the remaining portion promises to yield a fan- average crop Mr Teiguson, who owns the adjoining farm, and another neighbor close by, have also had to convert a portion of their wheat into fodder. What remains is ex- pected to give a fair return. The Hamlet's Ghost, with the spurious Count on board put into Somerset (Cape York), on or about the 15th August. On being boarded by the police boat he made inquiries as to whether a frigate had arrived there, and on being answered in the afflirmative became agi- tated and eagerly inquired about her movements, but appeared relieved when told that the vessel was HMS Virago, and that she had left the settlement in January. He remained eight days, and during the whole time kept a bright look out for vessels in the offing. The captain and crew were discharged in consequence of a row between the Count" and the captain, in which revol- vers were drawn. The crew refused to put the captain in irons. It appears that the Count had kept them in awe by threatening to give them twenty-five lashes a piece when he fell in with the Austrian frigate he was always expecting. The Acting P M induced the crew to re-ship under a fresh agreement, all but the captain and steward, who remained behind. While in port the Count was always dressed in the uniform of an Austrian captain of cavalry and wore a sword when on shore. He made a great display of the money he had with him and purposely left bills of exchange lying about his cabin for visitors to see, many of which were filled in for large amounts, and only wanted his signature He succeeded m imposing upon the authorities, taking supplies for his vessel and paying for tbem in bills -which the holders will doubtless discover are about as valuable as drafts upon Aldgate pump. Among those who were swindled are two naturalists, one named Thorpe. The Count bought some stuffed birds, &c;, from tbem, to the amount of about £30, but some slight compunction must have touched him, for contrary to his custom he paid them half cash and half by a bill. He sailed for Batavia on the eighth day, leaving letters for the captain of the Austrian frigate and his bankers in Syd- ney! The frigate was ordered to follow him on to Timor. The captain he has with him is one Austin, late master of the brig Reliance which was wrecked on the Solomon Group. He was picked up and brought into Bowen, whence he shipped as mate on board the Hamlet's Ghost. Two days after she left Somerset, the schooner Captain Cook arrived from Bowen with a war- rant for the arrest of the " Count." -Gladstone Observer. Tobacco gbovving (says tho Melbourne Economist) appears to be rather on the in crease, several tons of leaf have arn red this past week but not all in the best condition, some having been obliged to be p'aced under a healing operation for a day or two to seeuro its keeping This has been the case with a large number of parcels throughout this season, to tho surprise of the manufacturers who, in such a dry winter and spring as wo have had antici pated the leaf arriving in splendid condition A "v ICTOBIAN exchange contains the following re peoting the ncwlv established paper factory -"Since operations were commenced at Mr Ramsden's paper mill, m the beginning of May last, the manufacture lias gono ou continuously, no accident having occurred to interrupt the process It is also worth} of remark that the hands employed at the mill have now acquired the requisito familiarity with the work in which thev are engaged, and such manual dexterity as considerably lessens the cost of the manufac turing process î*o difficulty is now experienced through the inaptitude of the persons employed, and the work goes on as smoothly as in any old establi-hed factory Another improvement is, that the raw material of the manufacture is now supplied m greater abundance, new sources of supply having been discovered-such as the waste hemp, or tow, from the adjoining rope walk, ¿c , rags old rope», sugar bags, and such like waifs of flax and cotton goods, aro moro carefully preserved than they used to be Experiments have been made with native grasses and fibrous plants, which have been so far sue cessful as to show that paper can be made from them, but hitherto the cost of working them up has rendered tbem ineligible as a paper material Another interesting fact in connection with this now industry is, that several native earths have been found valuable as coloring materials Among the products of the mill aro blue orange, vellow, buff, and pink wrapping papers, besides many shades of brown , and several of these colors are produced with nativo materials At present several new-papers in this and the adjoining colonies are being printed on Mr Ramsden s paper, and preparations are being made bv importing an addmonal calen dering machine, to enlarge this branch of the business The colored wrapping papers, we may observe, appear to be of excellent quality, and bag makers who obtain their supplies from Mr Ramsden enjoy the advantage of having their paper cut to any sue they please ' A case of some interest to those addicted to the sport of hunting (says the Argus) was com- menced in the j'uries of four court, on Tuesday. The defendant is Mr. Samuel Waldock, master of the Melbourne hounds, who is sued by a farmer named Dunn, having property near Broadmeadows, for injuries dono to his growing crops and sheep, in the conrse of one or two of the Saturday afternoon hunts, which took place in July and August last. The plaintiff alleges that tho horses trampled down his growing crops, while the hounds were the cause of con- siderable losses amongst his sheep, the total damage being estimated at £125. Though some seventy or eighty persons took part in the hunt, the master of the hounds is the only ono pro- ceeded against, as it is argued that according to a decision of the courts in England, he is re- sponsible for all the damage that may have been done during the hunt. A verdict for tho plain- tiff was returned-damages £5. A SKtECT committee of tho Legislativo Coun- cil of New Zealand, in a report on tho tariff of the colony, distinctly recommend that in any rearrangement of duties the principle of protec- tion to local industry be kept steadily in view. Commenting on this the Otago haily Times re- marks :-" A demand for protection from such a quarter ia a startling fact. In the neighboring colonies that demand has been made by what are termed the masses, and strenuously opposed by the Legislative Councils. If this select com- mittee represents the opinions of the Council on the subject, or if it represent« the opinions of the leading members of our society, than we may expect that the commercial legislation of the colony will be based on protectionist princi- ples ; for it is at the hands of such men that opposition to_those principle« it usually met."
