Meadow Sweet.* In Summer fields the meadow sweet Spreads its white bloom around tha feet Of those who pass in love or play The golden hours of holiday, And heart to answering heart can beat Where grows the simple meadowsweet. Embosomed in some cool retreat The long seed grasses bend to meet The stream that murmurs as it flows Songs of torget me not and rose; The filmy haze of noon tide heat Is faint with scenes of meadow sweet. Ah, love I do you know meadowsweet? Does some pale ghost of passion fleet Adown this dreary lapse of years, So void of love, so full of fears ? Some ancient, far off echo greet The once loved name of meadow sweet ?
