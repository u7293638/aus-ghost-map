Wark can prove eithor of the following statements untrue : — That Sunny Corner requisitioned Mr. Paul to contest ; that 83 Freetraders signed that requisition ; that thare aro over 100 members in the asBO ciation pledged to Mr. Paul ; that there ia only one such aisociation at Sunny Corner; that F. Havenband is not a member of that association ; that 80 Freetrader! of Sunny Corner waited upon Mr. Tonkin and asked him to withdraw, and that ho wna told be had not the ghost of a show; that miserable underhand taotios aro being resorted to by a person at Snnny Corner, and that he is using1 the name of our aisociation to deliberately lying statements ; that proof ot same can be seen by any elector at our addrois.
