When the Etornal gives our embryo Life, 'and the deathless spirit, which man' owns, Spirit of reason and commanding'tonees Be marks the round of years whioh it ehallgo Upon this earth, fitting for bliss or woe. And, thus, if violence a life dethroneeo, The' the clay-house be strewn, or lapp'd in stones, The dislodged spirit wanders to and fro Till its appointed time. The realm of sprites .. Will not receive the unbidden visitor. Then thro' our murky air it vaguely moves, Haunting the guilty till they nelf abhor, And cry that Justice shall enforce her righte; Yet, till it time, thro' air such spirit roves.
