ST. "AUGUSTINE'S JDHURCH, UNLEY, On Saturday afternoon the ceremony of laying the corner-stone of the Church of St. Augustine, at Unley. took place. The afternoon was anything but favourable for the occasion, as a few heavy showers fell prior to the commencement and during a portion of the proceedings. The fact, however, that Lady Edith Fergusson had consented to lay the stone, attracted a large number of spectators to the ground, and around the site an enclosure decorated with bunting was formed for the convenience of those taking an active part in the affair and the accommodation of the ladies. It may be well to state that the idea of erecting a church at Unley was originally entertained in October, 1862, when Bome -steps were taken, such as fenciug the land and preparing plans. For lack of support, owing to many opposing causes, this movement fell through, and operations were for a tune suspended. Towards the close of last year the subject was once more brought forward. The Hon. Thomas English was appointed architect, and a design prepared by Mr. Thomas was finally agreed upon. It is intended for the present to build the nave only, at a cost of about £430. Of this sumj£200 are now in hand, and four gentlemen of the Committee have advanced as a loan 11,6 8 } m \?, f £20() / ThTs loan it is proposed to re- P. a J ofiertories and pew-rents of the church when opened for Divine Service, which, it is contemplated, will be in January next. Meanwhile, for a period of not less than two years, the Rev. Henry Read, M.A., Incumbent of Mitcham, and the Rev W. H. Mudie, of Glen Osmond, have, with the sanction of the Lord Bishop, jointly undertaken to perform Service in the church at least once each Sundav, without stipend, in order that the income of the church may be entirely devoted to the repayment of the debt incurred. - The buiidiDg will be in the early Engl-sh Gothic style, consistingOL nave, chancel, and transept; but as stated abeve only the nave will be at present erected, with seats for about 140 persons. The entrance will be from a neat porch on the south side. The gable end facing the Unley road will be finished with a bell tower and turret reaching to a height of £4 feet, and supported by a centre buttress, with Gothic windows on either side, which gives a somewhat novel and pleasing appearance to the design. The size of the interior of the nave will be 44 feet in length by 20 feet in breadth, with an open boarded ceiling. The chancel end will be ornamented internally with a handsome archway so constructed as to facilitate future extension. Sufficient light will be admitted through double and triple light windows, one on either side of the entrance porch and on the orposite wall. The building is to be executed in Glen Osmond stone, with cement and freestone dressings, and roof of corrugated iron The estimated cost will be £800. and the contract has been taken by Mr. David Deans, of Mitcham. His Excellency the Governor and Lady Edith Fergusson, accompanied by Mr. Morris, arrived about half-past 3 o'clock, and were received by the Lord Bishop, the following clergymen also being in attendance:—Ven. Archdeacon Marryat, Canon Farr, Revs. D. J. H. Ibbetson, J. Pollitt. H. M. Pollitt, H. Reid, H. Howitt. T. Field, W. H. Mudie, A. Honner, and Scott. The clergy assembled at the residence of Mr. C. Day, from whence they walked m procession to the site. The service was commenced by singing the 164th Hymn. Prayers were then offered by the Bishop, and the Rev. W. H. Mudie-tead the lesson from Genesis xxviii. Mr. N.
