ministerialists with what object we must look to the future to disclose -the Viceroy of Egypt was not idle father As in Paris, he was here, there, and everywhere, till one almost fancy d that, like Sir Boyle Roche a bird, he would he in two places at once But it is to be feared that we cut a sorry figure before these wise men of the list Much as we pride ourselves on our national religion as character, we were not above dotting it for the nonce, for when the "\ viceroy took it into my head to pay a Sunday visit to the ' too, as if a now the fish on to designate the Regent a V uk

existence of that violet like modesty which has ever been regarded as the special attribute of our English in aid as M) Lady Vere de Vere has indeed fallen from her high estate when she condescends to demean here If in the eyes of an Egyptian satin, or of his haughty manner, the Commander of the Faithful The tone of modern society is not altogether what it should be We seem to be drifting into a state of morals analogous to those which followed the Restoration It was but the other day, that one of our new satirical journals, the Jotnahaicl, with wonderful audacity, p blushed a remarkable cartoon, which took the town by storm It represented the Prince a Wales, as Hamlet struggling with John Hull who, as Horatio, was veil j holding him back from pursuing the ghost of George the Fourth of whom the p i c was exclaiming, 111 follow thee lheinterenc is obvious, and it is a significant fact that not a single paper has ventured to express its disapproval at a nature which, but a few years since would represent its author to prison The loss of the Prince Consort and the continued seclusion of the Queen from Court have, indeed, told most unfavourably upon the gen lal morals of upper clubs society, or we should not now behold the common spectacle of voting in 1 beautiful vom cb disfiguring their tresses with abominable dyes hiding the roses on their cheeks beneath masses of pearl powder, painting themselves a la Rachel, and with cor wages cut as low as possible, driving to St James s Theatre to witness performances of French plays, in which every feeling of modesty and decency is continually outraged A bad time this to receive a visit from Abdul Aziz, who we doubt not will return to the shores of the Bosphorus glad that he is not as these Chuitmns as that he is

Cremorne, for the r special behoof, to say nothing of that magnificent affair at the Agricultural Hall, where the fear >t mlc sat cheek by level with the bean ihoikU, and where English vulgarity and rudeness obtruded itself in its most forbidding, guise, to the annoy ance of the guests and the scandal of the country w ell was it when the dawning" daylight compelled the break up of the drunken saturnalia Such orgies were a disgrace to our boasted civilisation The Queen and Miss Burdett Coutts were more thoughtful in the exercise of their hospitality They Gave he B's was plenty to eat and drink, but she avoided insulting them by forcing on the company of a inestimable description And as all the Belgians are not drunkards or rather, this display of true womanly consideration was duly appreciated I el man at the Belgians found their way into our workshops and factories, not a few pan ing access to the larger of the city warehouses Here they obtained something of an idea of the true vastness' of our national industry and more than one of the company expressed himself in class of the highest admiration at our wonderful aptittidelor work "It I were not a Belgian, J e said, Two ill

Th"the object of the chamber shall be to look to the interests of both capital and labour in order to bring them into closer union, to give advice in cases of dispute between employers and employed, the study of the principles of political economy, and to examine the laws relating to capital and labour The terms of membership were e fated to be 16 a quarter to be paid in advance if necessary This is something practical, something more deserv -
