THE AXE PALLS. (vide cartoon.) The Policeman came down like a wolf on the fold, And his warrant was good and his bearing was bold ; And the prow of his steamer made stars on the sea When that blue "trap" rolled nightly towards the Fiji ! Like the leaves of the forest when Summer is green The rogues in those islands at sunset were seen : Like the leaves of the forest when Autumn goes past Those rogues on the morrow with fear were aghast ! For Otto Berliner had collared one chap, And fierce was the look on the face of the " trap " ; And the eyes of " levanters " waxed fishy and chill, And their brag at once ceased and for ever grew still. And there stood the king with his nostrils all wide, With a coat to his back and nothing beside ; And the face of his Minister known on our turf Was as cold as the spray of the rock-beating surf. Yea, there stood a figure distorted and pale, With an axe in his hand and a mask for a veil ; And the scamps were all silent, the bombast unblown, The hatchet uplifted, the criminal prone ! And over all floated, as black as the Barb, The ghost of a man in an ominous garb ; And the thing that it held in its shadowy hand Was an omen of awe to the lords of the land ! By cocoanut islands and coppery seas There cometh a cry from the distant Fijis : The voice of levanters â€” the anguish, the moan Of those whom the "peeler" has threatened to " bone." And the rogues of Australia are loud in their wail ; And so are the knaves who'd abscond from their bail ; And the faces of scoundrels triumphant before Are paler than snow through the dread of the Law.
