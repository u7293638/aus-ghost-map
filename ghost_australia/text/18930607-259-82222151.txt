CORRESPONDENCE. [MY do not hold uitntehcs responsible fur the opinions expressed by onr correspondents.) OUH HAND. (7t> tin' Editor of (he J-Jxamhter <0 Tjun-.*.) Sin,-In your issue of Saturday last I was pleased to read of the progress made by the locnl band. I think it a pity lbat the band does not turn out oflencr in public and awaken the town with some of their soul stirring marches, such as the "Kaiser William" played by Uieni oa their last public nppcarnncc on the march. 1 have had the pleasure of listening to the band at several of our outdoor gatheringa, and as a townsman I was proud to think that at lau we can sport a band of our own. How often have we had bands engaged from Tenter field or Toowoomba playing nt our sports or races; the still' prices paid every year would have more than covered ths cost of lirst class tuition for a band of our own. Some weeks ago an article appeared in the Aran* sketching the history of our Ijcal band, pointing out the urgent need of funds and suggesting ways and means whereby the baud could be put on a firm footing and be self-supporting. The plan looked feasible, and many hoped that the gentlemen appealed to would take action ; the ghost refused to wall:; but it is gratifying to read that the bandsmen are determined on progress in spite of every obstacle. Many will 6ay that wc have trouble enough at the present time without bothering about bands Others again, and let us hope the large majority* have a heart above the depression and would gladly assist. Speaking for myself I prefer to take my gruel, singing the while a snatch of the old eong, Wo nyo liAve been provided for and BO wiil wn yet. rather than fold my hands, and mournfully croon that plaintive song, " The Heart Mowed Down."
