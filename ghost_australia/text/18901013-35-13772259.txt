PORT JACKSON AMATEUR SAILING CLUB-The Port Jackson Amateur Sailing Club opened the season of 1300-01 on Saturday afternoon with a series of evolutions, under the direction of their popular commodore, Mr G Hellings, whose flag was hoisted on board the Our loss The steamer Jenny Lind, which was placed at the disposal or numbers and their friends, was fairly well patronised, a large number being of the fair sex, who as usual evinced a lively interest in the proceedings. Mr A J Speer, the hon secretary, was in charge of the steamer, and as usual was most attentive to the visitors. The wind somewhat interfered with the manoeuvres of the fleet, blowing at times very squally between N. E. and N. N E The boats, with the ordinary racing; canvas on, were hardly fitted to carry out the wishes of their commodore with precision Out of a fleet of 18 boats 11 only put in an appearance, two others having carried away some of their gear-the Scylla having lost her rudder, and the Lottie's rigging having started, preventing her taking part The divisions, therefore, were as follows - starboard Our loss (commodore), Montura, Our May, Itogina, Massilia, Isadore and Iverna Port Idnthea (vice commodore), Craigielee, The Ghost, and Imogono. Shortly after 3 p m the Commodore hoisted the first signal, 68 (" Follow me in Uno,") shaping a course from Kirribilli Deacon down to leeward of Garden Island, followed by four of the boats, the others at this time had not put in an appearance, but several could be seen in the distance making their way to the trysting-place The Uno being of ally well kept, the new arrivals dropping into their places when able to do so the Commodore leading them round the " Glad stone," lying in Neutral Bay, and thence on towards Bradley's Head, road where they came about the signal being replaced by 56-" Form two lines astern of commodore and vice commodore " This order did not appear to be very well understood, the majority, with the exception of the Idothea, followed the Commodore in line back to Thrupp's Point, where 58 was again run up, and the boats headed for Clark Island this was very well carried out, and the boats presented a very pretty sight, scudding away off the wind When in midstream 52 was run up-" Form line abreast to starboard of Commodore " , but owing to the strong breeze and choppy sea anything like order was out of the question The boats then heading for the northern shore were kept away towards Neutral Bay, off where IS of 23 was run up bluto Commodore" This was carried out in good style, amidst cheering and waving of hats. 24 was then substituted-" Part Company " the various crafts making the best of their way to their respective sheds, appearing well satisfied with the evolutions
