' ~ ' ' Walked every step of the way,' The , fellow seemed so earnest, so eager, and withal, so moderate/ that I did relent, and quickly summing UP niatters in my own mind, I made this proposition to him : ' W ell; Jex, I will help -you. I'll go with you and attend to the laying out of my own money. I am goiiig up to in order to see what's what, and if it suits my book, I'll keep you and your mates in return for an equal share free of all further expense to me, subject to this con dition : that I can stop supplies at any moment I like; and further, that the cost of food and any other expense I may be put to will be a . first charge on the washings,' ' Agreed. You're a brick, Lippy;;' and he eagerly gripped my hand. 'Now, Jex, show' me where yoii 'iver , He hesitated, but, after consider ing a bit, led the way. The neigh bourhood was a frowsy one, and the penny hash house uninviting in the extreme. Yet there were there a dozen men or so sitting in the sparely furnished « reading room' smoking.. I told her what I was going to ao, and she thanked me in her quiet' unobtrusive way. Upon leaving I slipped a bank note into Mrs. Jexon's hand. At the appointed time Jexon met me at the railway station. His swag - was a light onej. but that wasn't my business. Anyhow, ? .1./ shared my, rugs with .him in- the: car. Arriving at — - we had to negoti- '- ; ate a twenty mile - coach ride, and ' then a walk of two miles brought 'us to the claim. . ? , ... I knew the country, as I had been . , there in the early days, -and, saw but ;,i few .changes.,, . , . ,.v , jexon took me to the -hut. It was' ' noon,, and ; yet there was xio sign of ? work. Oil a fire m the opeii was a. , billy, and, sitting by it ;tw,o hang-dog ^ looking fellows. sm,oking; inside - were three others, equally unprepos- ' sessing, sitting at. a..-: table playiiig ' euchre. They, looked np for a mo ment and resumed their gam6. ? - ' This is. ; a,; hew .'-mate ? T; have' brought. :you— ,an old friend of mine ? who has promised to. help, us,? said Jexoij, in. a pleasant soit of wiay,' his-, j face all smiles. ., I 'We ain't got nothin' to eat, so can't ask ye to 'ave a bite,' ? Wbat.l -Haven't you got a bit of^ gold?' ' ' Gold be - — Where . can we get - ; gold r' Which sounded1, bad for my . venture. ? , . ; , 'And haven't you been trying?* asked Jexon. ' What bloom'in' rot ; you know we can't wOrk 'an'-; we starvin'. Why; we can't even get a drink o' -milk. from the old cocky down yonder.' ? I said nothing, but studied the. ? crowd with some curiosity. ? I learned from Jexon, that the cocky kept a store. I gave him some money to purchase meat and bread, sugar and tea — nothing else. I was goiog to try an experiment. I could live as hard as any one, and naturally ex pected others to do so when neces sary. The food was . procured, and and:the paen tucked.in a pretty good - tightness of fried mutton arid home made bread, moistened with panni kins; of tea. There was no stint, . and I noticed that the cha,ps. had , ' sweet teeth,' for there was a big run on the sugar bag. Jexon gave up his stretcher to me and slept on the floor; it was pretty cold and I- halved my wraps with him. I was shown the claim next morning. To the un initiated there was nothing to see, but that did not disturb me., I wanted, to see the place where the two penny., weights come from. Jexon pointed out a hole in- the drift; I tried several : pansful of stuff and 's got merely colours in' each® I ad ?vised' Jexon to -set- the- others'- opening ! out in the bank. He spoke .to them, and there -was some discussion: ' Let's see your tools,'' . I. said. They were produced, and a. .more discredit able lot of picks ajid sbovels I had noyer s'eeB, -...-i. m \--The -fellows pottered about making some sort of pretence of work, and I went to the hut and put on some working duds; The fellows stared, at me when I went amongst them in moleskins, heavy boots, and big bare arms ready for action. I put in an afternoon's work, and rather liked the look of the country, though I got no prospect. ? ' : That evening I sont for no tucker, and all hands looked glum. We finished the remnants of yesterday's mutton and bread, and 'no one had enough. After that repast I put matters plainly before them :????? * It I was :to find- 'tucker, I must have a fair return in work. I had shown them the way, and they must make an effort. When, I saw them, iii earnest I would provide better tools and quarters, with . heaps .; of grub. It depended entirely on them selves.. If they were men, and acted fair by me, I'd stand by them for. three months ; if they did not, either tlr^y or l would have to clear out. . Finding no gold in a, week, I told Jexon that he had lied to me, and in a servile, apologetic fashion he ad mitted the soft impeachment. ' Never mind,' I said, -1 must try and make the best of it. We must .have better tools and better men.' . ' What will you do then ? ' \- In a day or two I'll tell you ; but I must go into— — - (the nearest town) * and I -leave my few ^..-belongings' in*' your care. I may trust you that much.-' He looked at me . reproachfully. . '' Ybu surely can trust me that much.' ' I . .will do so. I'll hire a horse from our - cocky friend .below, and hope sfco be back in two days.' . ? My, first visit was to 'the mining Iregislrar. From him I heard, that no ;iease .hftd.been, applied for,, ,an^ that, ? no minerisirights had been issued; in the iiames I - indicated. I then ap 'plied- for 800- yards in the river bed, and '50 acres along the banks on either side, ;-paid,.the deposit and tpok Out a miner's right for Jexon. . I- .then purchased , such ? tools as were: required,, together with . axes, eaws, hammers,- etc., and a good sup ply of provisions, to be forwarded the following day. . When I got back to the claim the men were all attentioii, but I. told them nothing. They.iW.ere much, annoyed, you may be sure. ; They were experts, at euchre, and I saw they meant to- take me down; .but they had no money to bet. I bought their interest in the claim for dSlb;- and with Jexon as partner won it baek. . . , , . . That night a' heavy hand moved over ray face, and in another second would have clutched my throat. I J had not. gone to Sleep, fully expecting some such attempt. My right , hand held my revolver and I blazed away, not at the man but up at the crafter. The blaze revealed the fellow's face, I then drove my left into him with all the ? force ? I could. I heard a howl, and then there wias a nice old row. I had slipped out of bed, and as I had turned in standing . I was pre pared. Someone struck a match, and I found them all standing about m' except one, he was lying doubled up, ' for I had hit him below the belt. Jexon at once attempted to smooth matters by insisting that, there had been some mistake. The .others talked big, but having five, shots, I talked back pretty well as I pleased. v Jexon. speaking ? on their behalf, suggested a compromise. Asked what they proposed, they asked for £20 for their interests, a told them I'd see them in Halifax first. , ., ?.* Whtit would I give them then P ' they asked. - . ? ' I have no right'' to give you any-, thing, but to save bother here is that -' £10 note mid What odd silver I have will keep yo'tt' ori ;' the road/ 7 Now clear 'before I ride^ ''for!' 'the police. Jexon, L have not included you, but if ,you.are hoiaesicl^herei is'£2'fpcyoii^. .... . though l'd rather you'd' stay.' : -- They _ took the rhoney, rolled up ' their swags and cleared ^out. That afternbon a trooper called at the camp to enquire if 'all hands had miner's rights. He saw mine and Jexon's, ?' drank a pannikin oftea with us, had ?- a Smoke, and thea followed on the trail of my late ma,tes. Wbat for ? never troubled me. . ' ? ' Now, Jexon, what do you intend doing ? Will you stay with me or surrender your chance here?' He said he'd stay. ^ !. I knew all the old diggings about ' B ? ,' biit .all my' old cronies ha;d * left or wereVdead, though they were ? known, to those I interviewed. I made arrangements with six good' men, who returned with me, bring- ~ ing with them sJl that belonged' to ? them on pack- horses. ' They were of ' the good old' type of gold-digger-— ' strong, hearty, and capable, and ' looked respectable men. And what a change they brought t ' We soon. 11 had a decent camp,' ana better still, a ' big cut opened out and the bottom taken up. It was dry weather and ' we had no difficulty with the water. The yield, upon washing up, was highly satisfactory. ? . Subsequent washings proved just ^ as good. Then, Jexon wanted to go . home. I didn't blame him : for/ he had a good , wife, and his[share would set: them up. He was a spare, weak man, and his heart;. was not in the work. He had £50 in his pocket,' , and I offered £50 for -his share. He, _ . demurred at first, ' because,' he said, you have, been a real friend, and I ought-not to take'a pieriny from you.?» ' Let me owe it to you, 'then. Per-, . haps £50 about Christmas will come , in handy,'' though I .hope- you will . ; have doubled, your £50 l^-, then.' . * ? *-' ^ By enquiring at a well-known.' ^ socialistic. rendezvous, I found Jexon,.'4. and.I am.glad.to say, in a far,greater. ; ; ' degree of ^ cpnafort .th^n I had. ever, seen him. .
