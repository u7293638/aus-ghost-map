THE FORTITUDE VALLEY RACING CLUB SUMMER MEETING. JUDGE: J.D. Heal, Esq. Starter: N. Corrigan, Esq Committee: Messrs. J.H. Fitzgibbon, E. M'Dermott, C. Campbell, A. Wakefield, T.P. Hardy, J. Lloyd. J.A. Evans, S. Pole. W.H. Whitby. Hon. Sec.; Mr. W. Ruddle. On Saturday last the F.V.R.C., which has for two years been slumbering, returned to vitality, and they were fortunate in having a lovely day for their reunion. The fact of the public holiday being proclaimed for Monday, instead of Saturday, waß an untoward circumstance, and one which militated gieatly against the attend* ance, which would otherwise undoubtedly have been a large one. As it was, the number who patronised Eagle Farm was small in the extreme, and not nearly up to what the sport provided warranted that it should be. Inside the enclo sure there were few beyond those immediately in* terested, and the stand wore quite a dreary ap pearance. The grand stand booth was under the supervision of Mr. Ruddle, and an excellent lunch was provided, which, oonaidering the at* tendance, was well patronised. Outside the wanjts of the public were attended to by host Sullivan. There was a nice breeze blowing during the greater part of the day, whioh rendered it a very enjoyable one for race-going, and we were sur prised that more ladies did not avail themselves of so pleasant an afternoon. The Attorney* Qeaeral brought down a party of ladies and gen* tlemen in a well-appointed drag, and this was the only four-in-hand which put in an appear ance. At 12 o'clock a start was made with the trotting race, which was not a whit more interesting than these affaire generally are. Tearaway broke badly on coming into the straight the second time, which put out any chance he may have had, but nothing else ever had a ghost of a show with Shamrock. After this came the Maiden Plate, for whioh Warfaie was supported for most money, though Mr. Fiunie's party were very sweet on Ben Lomond's chance, who, however, was very fret ful, and sweated profusely before starting, and Nancy had ajao a few supporters. The Btart was not a particularly good one, as Ben Lomond got away with a great advantage, whilst Nancy threw her boy, aud went off on her own account. Ben Lomond held his own until turning into the straight, when Warfare drew up to him, and a great finish ensued, the chestnut just get ting his head home first. The Hurdle Race was reduced to » match between Mr. Ricardo's two representatives, and they cantered over the course in company, Panto mime coming in first. There was a good deal of interest taken in the Valley Handicap, though betting was pretty well confined to Proctor and Nabocklish, it being very evident that nothing else had a chance. Each of these bad a good circle of admirers, who carefully watched the operation of saddling, 4c, and we could not help thinking that Proctor in particular showed a very marked improvement in appearance since running here in November. His ribs were nice and bare, and his quarters full and muscular, while his coat shone like satin. Nabocklish, too, looked as fit as hands could make him, and his sup porters were brimful of confidence; but Moorlad did not altogether please the eye, and he looked to be just a little bit overdone ; while Liberty, though in excellent trim bodily, wore a suspicious ap pearance about the understandings. After one false attempt, at which Nabocklish went to the five furlong post before he could be stopped, they were despatched on their journey on pretty even terms. Connors on Proctor, after getting away into a good position drew back, while Nabocklish followed out his cutting-down tactics, and led them away at a merry pace, in hopes of getting the heavy weights in trouble. It was soon evident that Liberty and Moorlad were out of it, though the latter made two or three desperate attempts to reach his hones, and five furlongs from home it was evident that Nabocklißh was compounding. The son of Westminster led into the straight, but he had shot his bolt, for directly Connors moved on Proctor, the chestnut drew up level, and goinp on he won easily. The winner had to undergo the ordeal of a protest, it being alleged that he had crossed Nabocklish. How ever, the stewards decided not to disturb the judge's verdict, and there was, indeed, as far m we could Bee, but little to protest against. Connors rode throughout with great judgment, and notwithstanding that the pace after the first half-mile was pretty severe, he always kept a jealous eye on Nabocklish, and never let him get too far away from him. Sundown won the Separation Stakeu easily. Though Bandy was coming very fast at the finish, and ran with un deniable gameness, he is rather a slow beginner, but is particular busy at the right end of a race, and when he has had a thorough preparation, should give his owner a turn. Five weighed out for the Corinthian, but Inspector, who was very cranky at the post, ended by bucking bis rider off just after the fall of the flag, and the four sped on their way, leaving their late companion to watch them in their flight. Eclipse appeared to be out of it at the half-mile, but Mr. Finnic kept him going, and letting Pastime and Warfare cut one another down, he swooped down on them at the post after getting his pull, and won cleverly. Every body waa glad to Bee Mr. Black get a turn in the Flying Handicap, though Brisbane must have won if she had not run off at the turn for home, as she had a good lead, and was going well within herself, and it was hard lines on Mr. Jost to lose the raoe through a bit of bad luck. Tom Sowerby scored a win with Nabocklish in the Consolation Handicap, which he won all the way; while a Hurry Scurry, won by Barolin, wound up the afternoon's sport. A protest was entered against the winner as being a trained horse, but it was dismissed. However, as Baro lin had been entered for another race at the meeting, and was known to have been in active training for it for some time, we wonder at the stewards approving of him. Below are the details of the running :— The Handicap Troth no Rack of 16 so vs., with a sweep of 1 soy. each from starters ; second bone, 3 soya, from the prize ; third horse to save his stake ; 3 miles.

Nancy threw her rider at the start, and Ben Lomond jumped off with » good lead, Warfare next, and Chester last In this order they ran round the bend and along the back, where War fare ran up to the leader. Ben Lomond shot away again at the nod wall, but Warfare coming again, got on terms with him at the half-distance, and a great race home ended in favour of the chestnut by a head, Chester a bad third.

Stevenson's b.g. Liberty, 6 yean, Bat 41b., (W. Blacklock) 0 Betting: Level money Proctor and Nabock liah, 3 to 1 against Moorlad. After one false attempt they were despatched to a good start, Liberty being quickest on his legs, but Proctor's colours were seen in front as soon as they had settled down, and he led at a slow pace tv'l nearing the half-mile post, where Nabockliah rushed to the front and carried the field along at a rattling pace. Coming past the stand Nabocklish was leading Proctor by several lengths, Moorlad being last. Going round the bend Moorlad made an effort to get up, but failed; at the half-mile post, however, he buc ceeded in passing Liberty, though both of them were evidently out of it Nabockliah still kept in front, and turned into the straight with a slight lead, though Proctor, who had always been handy, was evidently putting in a strong claim. At the half distance Connors got on terms, had Nabocklish in difficulties at once, and going on won easily by three lengths, Moor lad third, ten lengths away. Time, variously taken, from 3min. lljaec. to 3min. 12} sec.

Bandy, who came very fast at the finish, just beat Darkie on the post for Becond place. On being put up to auction the winner waa bought in at £27. The CoRiNTniAN Handicap, of 80 soys., with a sweep of 1 sot. each from starters; second horse 3 sots, from ta* prize; 1 mile and a-quarUr; non- profeseional riders. Mr. J. Jennie's ch.h.

After one falsa start they got away, Inspector throwing his rider before they had got many yards. Warfare led past the stand, with Pastime in close attendance, and Ace of Spades last. At the half-mile post Kclipse seemed to be in trouble, and the light weight was done with. Warfare and Pastime turned into the straight together, both at the whip, and the race seemed for a moment to lie between them, but 100 yards from home Mr. Fionie came with a wet Bail, and, both his opponents being in trouble, he won cleverly; Warfare being placed second, and Pastime third.

Nabocklish, however, was never headed, and won easily, the old gray being second, and Liberty third. A Hurry Scurry of 5 soys., catch weight*, 1 mile and a distance, was won easily by Mr. Skyring's chestnut gelding Barolin, 5 yean. TBE OXLEY JOCKEY CLUB RACES. The meeting of the above club took place, on Monday, and notwithstanding the counter attraction of the regatta, a good number of people found their way to the Rocky Water* holes; during the afternoon, indeed, the pre cincts of the course were quite crowded, and the attendance must have been highly satisfactory to the committee. The racing was on the whole of an interesting character, several of the races having filled well, . and some of the finishes were very close ones. Nancy, who won the Maiden Plate, is a very promising daughter of Sydney Tim WhiiUer, and she won both her races in gt '»d style, sbowjujjr undeniable gaioeoess. Requiem topked. b»]||hSc->< above herself, and though barnattf v wpftacTff 1 ticularly sweet upon her chanco, unable to finish with Naucy, who tJKtj&Mt;^tjK pretty easily. Ben Lonnnd ran inside a post in the Maiden Plate, and though he r<m well up for a mile and a-half in the handicap, he died away at the finish. Eclipse won the Ladies' Pu.n»e» very easily, and this was the only prize whioh fell to Mr. Finnie's lot. Duohess got right away from her field in the i rinoe of Wales Stakes, and won easily, while Inspeotor scored a win in the Consolation, and the Pony Race was easily won by The Swell. The measuring of the ponies caused some amusement, and was not very skilfully performed, as it was very evident that fully half of the field would not have proved within the proscribed limit (fourteen hands) if accurately measured. The committee deserve great oredit for the way in which they have worked up their club ; and of all the horseownsrs who went there I do not think there is one that is not thoroughly satisfied with the treatment he has received. The handicapping was particularly happy and gave every satisfaction ; and the starting, in Mr. Orenier's hands, was aUo well carried out. We understand from the hon. boc. (Sir. Nolan) that it is intended to hold the next meeting of the Oxley Jockey Club on Easter Monday, at which a £50 handicap and other good prizes will be run for. The following are details of the running :— The Maiden Plate of 10 sots. ; for all horse* that never won an adTertised prize ; weight for age ; 11 mile. Mr. P. O'Suliiran's b f.

Blscklock) At the fall of the flag Ben Lomond swerved off the course and ran inside a post Nancy led past the stand, followed by Ace of Spades. A quarter of a mile from home Wheel of Fortune assumed the lead, and at the turn for home looked like a winner, but she was very badly ridden, and allowing the filly to come up' on the inside ; the latter, who came from the whip like a shot out of a gun, won comfortably. A protest was entered against the winner for running inside a post, but, after heuring a good deal of evidence on both Bides, the stewards decided not to interfere with the judge's decision. X cky Watehboles Handicap, of 30 sots., added to a sweep of 1 sot. each from starters ; for all horses, to b« handicapped ; second horse, 5 sots, from the prize ; 2 miles Mr. P. O'SulliTftn's txf.
