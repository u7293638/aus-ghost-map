Dutch, of North Sydney, and E, bert J. Brown, of tho Clarence River, ended in a disgraceful fiasco. The stakes vrera ¿£100 a-side. Mr. J. Davis WHS umpire and Mr. J. Richarde, jun., jadge. Brown won the toss and chose tho southern shore, and the men got away after eeveral attempts, Brown having all tho best of the start. Reaching Uhrs Point, Dutch had come up level with his oppqnent, and both men then made acro-s tor the mile beacon. Before reaching this point, Brown cont nuously jammed Dutch inshore, Eo muon so that Dutch had to ease up ant let his oppo .eut go on and take the outside, or otherwise he would have been on th« sand or have broken his boat on the rocks. Brown, seeing tnis, tried to cross the bow of Dntoh s boat, and as a consequence a foul at euee ensued, in which Brown came out of his boat, and Dutch's boat was injured by the collision. Both uren being in the water a fnw seconds, abuse between them took place, and thea -Dutch made a blow at Brown, who, however, managed to get into his boat and pull away. Dntch, whoso boat waa apparently much damt¿sr¡d, then secured another one that w*s handy, and made off after Brown, who by this time had got a good quarter of a milo nearer the ond of tho courao. Almost immédiat ely Brown's boat then broke in halves, and he waa picked up by a pleasure boat ; while Dutch rov/ed a^ay, and finished the conrso alone. Ibo umpiro having given his decision in favor of Dutch on the foul, Brown en icred a prottst, which was considered at W.trby's Hotel in tho evening. After considerable discussion Brown refused tj withdraw his protost, or to fix a dato to ro-row tho race, not bavins, as ho said, a suit able boat to row in. Thus tho matter now stands ; and,if thern ia anything necessary to bring profes sional rowing into disreputo, or to prevent rowing en thusiasts lending beginners a helping hand, it ia such conduct as this. At a meeting of the Grafton Queen's Birthday Regatta committee, held at tho Freemasons' Hotel on March 24, it waa decided that tho prizo for All Comers in outriggers should be ¿£50. Thero will bo in all eight races on tho programme.
