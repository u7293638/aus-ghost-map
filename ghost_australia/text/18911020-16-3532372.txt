'. WESLEYAN ANNUAL DISTRICT MEETINGS. OPENING SERMON. The official sermon in connection with the South Queensland District Meetings of the Wesleyan Methodist Church was preached last evening in the Albert street Church by the Rev J A- NOLAN The preacher chose for his text the words "But ye shall receive power after the Holy Ghost is come upon you," Acts 1,8 In opening his remarks on the subject he said power was everywhere, and yet everywhere hid itself. It was recognised in the storm winds the breakers, the movements at train or steamer. Some of the most majestic ruin in the old world had been caused loss by age and decay than by the growing of the roots of trees, whose seed had been dropped between the crevices in the walls It were difficult to realise the immense power of sunlight, of volcanoes, or any of the great agencies of nature, and all that could be said was but to give a name for their effects On the cause of those effects they were silent The Bible told something of power It, however, spoke of supernatural power In these days of advanced thought there was a great outcry against the supernatural The miracles of the Bible and the prophecies of Scripture, must be explained away before the present day would accept Christianity), but he thought that if these be not the supernatural to Christianity, then it was a failure What mean cowardly men were the apostles till filled with the Holy Ghost, and what horses they proved themselves afterwards The words of the Gospel intended to convey that the regenerating power to be conferred upon the apostles by the coming of the Holy Ghost would impart a new soul to the dead spirit of man There were many illustrations in the Scripture that the supernatural power mentioned by God was given to man after he had already beloved It was a subsequent event this was what they needed today now feeble they were in their work, though they tried to do it well They had all things that would seem necessary to the carrying out of God s woik-ohurchas, ministers, teachers, money, influence, everything yet how defective their work was compared to what it ought to be Man) were the excuses raised to account for this They were said not to receive credit for their work. He did not think that was the cause they were said to lock numbers and yet how low wore the teachers in the apostolic days Some argued that money, influence, and culture were wanted, but the apostles woolroom, unto fluential and ignorant, and yet thou work was successful Another excuse was that they did not go in for social reform, but the preachers of Christ in the early days were not social reformers Were there not abuses to remedy then as well as now? He considered that Clut- ttamty was itself the great social reformer It was stated that his machine had got out of older, but this was not the fault What was wanted was a greater head of steam, of now or The, other advantages, while not to be despised would follow in the wake of power if St. Paul were to visit them he would probably say, as he said of old, ' Have jo resolved the Holy Ghost?" and many would perhaps answer with truth that they know not that such a blessing was in store for them This Spirit was in store for them, and to obtain it they should open their hearts and receive it as a gift. The minister concluded by expressing the hope that the conference would create a great religious revival through out the country During the evening several hymns were sung, and a sacramental service concluded the proceedings An action for slander has been brought against the Rev J O Keefe, Dean of Yass, claiming £1000 as damages for certain state ments said to have been made by defendant in the course of a sermon A witness deposed that he was in church and Dean O'Keefe charged plaintiff, who is the lookup keeper, with falsifying the books by putting down Prisoners as Roman Catholics who did not belong to that Church, thereby making it appear that in the criminal statistics of the colony Roman Catholics figured largely Defendant had also stated that he had called at the lookup and been ¡ntioducodtotwopusonots who appeared in the records as Roman Catholics, but who professed no religion at all the defence is that the objectionable words were not used. The case has been postponed.
