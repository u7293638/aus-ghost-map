Now I knew there wjgre ghosts in Irish Castle^ but I Bad ad idea that . any «pSrit8, other than those at the bar, were to be found in an Irish hotel. I sprang up and struck a light. I knew a person must have come into my room because the door did not close. I had shoved it as tight as it ?would go, but ope handle was off, and the bottom jammed so that it was im-^ possibteto^htotlt:. Still I was,. also* aware, tfaat no one conld opehrthe door , -without ibaking some noise. The door apparently, however,' had not been touched,and I searched the room with out .finding anything until niy eye caught tlje feeltrbpe. It swayed to and fro with a faint rustle against the -wall-paper as if it had just boen pulled by an unseen hand, and now I remem bered faintly in my dreams that I had beard a bell jingle before I wdce up so suddenly!. 1 said to myself with chat tering teeth, — ~''- .*? (f Here is a Christmas story evidently right into .Jny hand — the Ghostly Visitant knd the Ancient Bell-Hope — its title.' : I remembered the landlord had told me that the hotel had stood upwards of 100 years, and goodness qnl^knowB what may happen in room number seven of a hotel a century old.: I put theJighted candle on the mantle-shelf ?ndjnaafc to bed again. Just as I.W gan to dose, jingle went the bell in the region down stairs, and there was a rustle of the paper lit the top where was fastened the iron triangle that was attached to the wire at one corner and to the thick bell-rope at the other. /I looked to the bell-rope itself, and' it ?was again swaying to ond fro ,4ts if somebody had j ust pulled it This was decidedly uncomfortable,, so I reached over and gave a yank at the beH-rop« myself. and heard the bell jingle in the/ depths' of the hotel In a short tipre there vhs a rap at thft door, nnjron' pulling it partly open 'Bmb' ap pearpd.

I want to eleep, and if they keep on pulling, this bell rope all night, I can't get a wink.' 'Tirsee what I can do, sir,' shid Boots, as he left, and for some time there were no pulls at the bell rope ; but just as I got to sleep again, jingle -went the bell — the Land Commis sioners were thirsty again. ' ' ? Not to make too long a story of it, I may say that the Land Commission kept this jingling up till after mid night, while I tossed from side to side on that bed and tried to. go to sleep.

They never seemed to imagine T there was anybody else in' the hotel but themselves. However, that was their; innings, and I hops they enjoyed it. My own innings came later on. At half- past five there was » tap at my door. ' Time to get up, sir,' «-aid the voice of Boots ; 'the car leaves in an hour.' ' All right,' I answered, and, much as I hated to, I turned out in the cold morning. Then I remembered ray friends of the Land Commission. The hotel was intensively still, bo the first thing I drew on my boots. With that as a preliminary, I walked four times up and down the hall. The first time the tenor, who apparently was a light sleeper, groaned. The second time I walked' that hall the big commissioner in the middle room turned over in bed with a malediction. The fourth walk the man in the further room was awnke. I heard him muttering to himself. Then I went back to the room and poured. some water into the basin, and with the greatest splutter ing that ever was washed my face. ' Good gracious,' I heard the man in the next room say (not tbe tenor, but the big man). Then t began to whistle different tunes, some lively and some grave, and finally broke 'forth into a song, giving, them, the beautiful ' Hail, railing mom, that tips the hills with gold, - , Who-e to*\ fhigera opes 'the gates of daaa a-ay,' &c.; / This glee doesynot actually describe a typical Irish/winter morning, and perhaps thtfib/is the reason why the Je-ndJorfimiBsioner did not like it. .

I thought they did not perhaps c^re for that style of a song, so I gave them ' Five o'clock in the Morning,' but to tell the truth it was more than iialf past that hour. The stout commis missioner pounded loudly against the Wall :. , . ' I say .:' he shouted, ' I say there, don't you know the people want to get some sleep ? What's the meaning of all this row f . O£ course as there were three other persons on this floor, T couldn't be sure that he was addressing his remarks to me, so I said nothing but changed the tune, 'On one dark night o« Lao St. Pirre : De wind 'he blow, blow, blow; ? - !
