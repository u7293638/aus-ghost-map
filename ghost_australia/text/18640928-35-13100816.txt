GHOSTS EVERYWHERE. I \- ??--. ! , .-?-?? 1 From Chambers's Journal) We have had quite a run of ghosts during the last twelve months they have beset us on every side Ghosts at the Pa one office ghosts in the law courts ghosts in the Lord Chancellor s own sanctum , ghosts at the Polytechnic Institution, at the music hall, at the theatres, ghosts in the photographic shop windows, ghosts fitted to adorn or to mystify a carte de visite album The truth is, ingenious men have danced capital modes of applying well known optical laws to the production of what Sir David Brewster would call " natural jungle '-phenomena natural in their production, but almost magical in their effects In, one of the most beautiful of all the sciences, is very rich in capabilities for producing such effects, owing to the brilliant colour and dazzling lustre which rays of light produce under varying circumstances and such are the diversities resulting from the reflection of light from polished surfaces, the transmission through transparent substances, and the localisation by curved lenses and mirrors, that the scientific magician is provided with an amazing variety of working tools for the production of his wonders Mr Pepper, at the Polytechnic, told his auditors that he was about to shew them some curious phenomena dependent on the action of light He made no magical mystery of them, he declared that the phenomena were purely physical or scientific, having nothing whatever to do with disembodied humanity or spirit and machinery of any kind, A curtain drew up in a darkened lecture room A suppose! student or philosopher was seen seated at a table reading, raps and no ses disturbed him and presently a photo of a beautiful wo- ha i appeared, almost ekeing mate brightness the dumb pantomime that passed between the student and the phantom lady was a humble attempt at a drama concerning which we need say nothing, but many little incidents in the drama showed clearly, that though the student was a real man, the lady was only a reflected image She disappeared and reappeared instant in a way which no living woman could have done and yet there were the speaking eyes, the play of features, the movements of hand, and arm, an t figure, which we can associate only with a living person Another phantom was a supposed sculptor, at work upon a bust, the best intensely white and brilliant These two, with the student, went through another bit of pantomime, sufficient to shew that we were looking star actualman personating the student, the reflection of an actual man personating the sculptor, and the reflection of a plaster bust That the last two were only reflected images, became evident by the strange modes in which they suddenly day appeared and reappeared , but such was by the solidity of appearance, and the play of light and shade, that it was with the utmost difficulty the mind was induced to shake off the delusion, especially as the sculptor and the lady were more vivid and distinctly visible three the student "there are living persons behind the audience, said some of the spectators, " whose reflected images we see" "No," said others, "the real persons must be behind the scene, in front of us, but in some way concealed " No, no,' said a third class of philosophers , " the real persons are at the side, and their images are reflected diagonally towards the stage" " No, no, no," said others, who proved to be nearer the mark , " the real persons are below the level of the stage, but between the stage and us , we can hear something like the opening and shutting of a trap-door nearly on a level with the stage But, even supposing" the last theory were correct, what then? How did the shadow or image, the reflection or double, the ghost or phantom of the real person become visible on the stage to the spectators in the lecture room a " There is a convex line, like that used in a photographic camera, which produces a local image at a given number of feet trout the real person ," "there is a concave mirror, not a convex lens, which produces this local image ' " there is neither the one nor the other, but a plain looking glass, which throws a reflection upon some medium or other placed right in front of us ," " we are looking at a misty atmosphere or him, which sends back a reflected image to us as a rainy cloud does a rainbow ," "we are looking at a silvered glass , " we are looking at an ushered glass 'all these were theories or explanations, put forth to explain how the phantoms were produced, let the living persons be posted where they might It was only those who had a pretty clear notion of optical science who saw at once that the real person must be concealed beneath the stage, but near the front of it, that three by facing the audience there is a large sheet of plain unsilvered plate glass, nearly or quite upright, that a very bright light shining on the real person, causes vivid rays to be reflected diago- really upwards upon the front surface of the glass and that this reflection is brought back to the audience by a careful adjustment of position given to the glass There is not needed any focus or localising apparatus whatever, neither convex lens not come ive mirror, If, on a bright sunny day, we look into a plate glass shop window which is rather dark behind, we may see our own figures reflecting very distinctly, we may see another Self, apparently as far behind the glass as we are in front of it The glass 13 unsilvered, and yet the reflection often comes out with remarkable distinctness Now, this is the pith and marrow of all the Ducks ghosts and Pepper ghosts, Sylvester ghosts and Carpenter ghosts, theatre ghosts and lecture-hall ghosts, whatever may be the varying details, reflection from the front surface of an anvil- vered plate of glass is the main cause of the surprising effects produced After it became known that Mr Dircks and Mr Pepper were about to bring out a joint patent, in reference to such very interesting displays as that at the Polytechnic Institution, many persons familiar with the proceedings of the British Association for the Advancement of Science, recalled to mind a certain paper read by Mr Dircks at the Leeds meeting of the Association 111 1866 In that paper, the principle of the ghost is certainly very clearly set forth, although the mechanical details are left for others to work out Knowing what we now know, it seems remarkable how dist nelly Mr Dircks prefigured the whole affair six years ago " we, may suppose a theatre or apartment, arranged as customary when required for dioramic exhibitions a stage being provided, and the spectators placed in a distinct, darkened, and elevated portion of the building The spectators thus situated, may, for example, see on an illuminated stage two or more figures, but without being aware that one or some of them bear a visionary character The peculiarity of this mode of exhibiting spectral appearances, it will be understood, consists in thus associating a living or solid figure with a merely visionary one, and yet the illusion to be so well sustained that the spectator distinguishes no visible difference between the several actors, when properly managed, until the circumstances of the dramatic scene require the visionary figure to fade away, and pass through the furniture and walls of the apartment, or play any similar spectral feat ' Here is the real principle, clear and unmistakeable Mr Dircks states that the thought had occurred to him twenty years earlier, but that it was in 1866 that-ac identally seeing the image of a solid body present a remarkably transparent appear- ance-he framed a series of suggestions as to the mode in which the spectral phenomena might be made interesting and amusing Mr Dircks gave drawings to show how a pretty parlour table exhibition might be made up in this way, with puppets instead of living actors an idea which optical instrument makers may possibly act upon some day or other When the Dircks and Pepper specification was made public in September last, the ingenious mode of putting the suggestion into practice on a large scale was fully set forth, and many who had admired and wondered at the ghosts now wondered that no local case is necessary, no less or concave mirror employed The purpose is described as being, " by a peculiar arrangement of apparatus, to associate on the same stage a phantom or phantoms with a living actor or actors, so that two may act in concert, but the effect being only an optical illusion as respects the phantoms ' In the first place, the spectators, seated on benches as in a theatre or lecture room, see a stage in front of them, suitable for come kind of dramatic performance Between them and the stage is a sunken chamber, the floor five or six feet below the level of the stage This chamber is open at the top, but the opening is concealed from the audience by suitably arranged boards and Screens Behind the sunk chamber, and at the front edge of the stage, is set up a large plate of plain or unsilvered glass, inclining forward a little at the top, and so environed with painted scenery, as to induce the observer to lose sight of the fact, that he is looking at the stage through a glass Living actors, dressed up in any way at pleasure, are in the sunken chamber, with a very strong lime light or other light shining on them from lamps properly placed , the actors and the lamps being equally concealed from the audience by screens. The strong rays from the illuminated figures strike up in a slanting direction against the glass, and are then reflected to the audience The glass has such an inclination given to it, that this reflection shall be visible to the spectators generally. The effect produced, though scientifically plain enough, is practically very surprising Supposing a young actress, dressed as a theatrically beautiful sylph or nymph, to be properly placed in the sunken chamber, and an intense lime-light thins gg career, we m s rector will fe.tMghMi but not knowing that there is any glass there, we seem I to see a brilliant real sylph on the stage. If the actress sylph, the living person in the sunken chamber, smiles or makes any pictures, the phantom sylph on the stage does the suits ; if she sings or speaks, we hear the sounds, and see the lips of the phantom moving. If the light of the lamps is made gradually to go out, the phantom disappears like a dissolving view ; end if a trap-door suddenly but silently closes the top of the sunken chamber, the phantom disappears instantly. If the lady walks away from the sunken chamber, So does the phantom walk away from the stage and then, if an actor, dressed, say in a ma. given, should appear on the stage, he may seem to perform a little drama with the phantom, if distances and lights are properly adjusted. True, he cannot see the phantom himself; but he is guided towards its apparent position by marks, cues, or dues of some kind. If the glass does not extend all across the stage, he may pass from behind to the front of it, or steel tiers, by an opening at the side, without the spectators detect- ing either the glass or the absence of it : and he may thus carry on the details of many a curious dramatic plot with the phantom. If there are two or more actors and actresses in the sunken chamber, and two or more on the visible stage, the by-play may be greatly varied, and the euVct wonderfully increased. If one of the actors in the sunken chamber is a sculptured statue or a plaster bust instead of a living person, a diversity of result follows from combining the phantom of a living being with the phantom of the copy of a living being. All this is not very easy to describe ; but should the reader succeed in catching the general principle, he will be in the right path for comprehending the multitudinous family of ghosts that have lately ap- pealed to our phrenological organ of Marvellousneas. There was, for instance, the "Haunted Man" Lecture, in which two characters none of Dickens's tales "free their hour upon the stage," the one a real man, and the other the phantom of a man, passing and repassing each other, and sitting alternately in the same chair. There was the scene from an Italian story, in which the ghost of a lady appeared in a frame which was a minute before empty. There was the scene, made up from portions of Shakspeare's Tempest, in which Prospero and two other characters were personated by real actors on the real stage ; while Ariel was so in- geniously managed as to be alternately represented by a living actress and the phantom of that same actress, the one really singing two of Ariel's songs, and the other appearing to sing two other songs, while the real lady was singing concealed in the sunken chamber. There were the drama of the "sensation" school at one of the east-end theatres, in which the ghosts of murdered wives appeared to remorseful husbands in a most retributive way and there were the wonders of Canterbury Hall. Then, in the latest version of the Polytechnic GhoB', there are the spectral tempters of Sir Hubert de Burgh, while watching his armour through the night in the chapel ; the diving-bell at the bottom of the sea, where a real diver and a phantom sailor dance a double nautical hornpipe in a most amaz- ing fashion; and the phantom of the veritable Mr. Pepper himself, only eight inches high, reading a lecture ! This last is curious in itself, and optically interesting, for it probably includes the combination of a concave mirror with all the rest of the apparatus ; insomuch that what the spectators actually box is not merely the reflection of a real person, but the reflection of the focused image of that person's com- plexity requiring very carefully adjusted apparatus. Mr. Dircks, in a small book relating to the ghost subject generally, shows how easily the optical phenomena may be applied to the (representation of short dramas, of which he suggestS several-Tho Returned Mariner The Californian Gamblers The Miser and the Money-lenders The j Strange Christmas-box The Duel; The Mil- liner Bewitched; The Gipsy's Promise and others. He shows also how a ghostly hand may be seen writing ; how three spectres may be produced with only one actor; how spectres may be shown with bloody heads or hands and how spectres may be shown as if floating in the air. The Ghosts in the Photograph created some noise about a year and a half ago. During the autumn of 1862, a photographer, whom we will call Mr. Blank was pursuing his professional avocations at Boston in America. According to an account sent by Dr. (say Dash) to one of the magazines devoted to spiritualism, Mr. Blank one day bethought him of taking his own photograph (it was on Sunday, October 5, we are told He was engaged in arranging the chemicals in the studio. Whether he thought Sunday to be a proper day for dealing with spirits, we are not informed ; but having prepared a plate, and placed a chair near the focus of the tenure, by which to adjust it, he proceeded to take his own photograph (card size) by quickly jumping into position, and standing still the required time. The photograph, developed in the usual way, represented Mr, Blank as an active, rather athletic-looking man, standing with his coat off, and the black cloth, used to cover the came, in his hand." Upon the back of this picture, when it came into the hands of Dr. Daish, was written : " This photograph was taken of myself, by myself, on Sunday, when there was not a living soul in the form beside me. The form on my right I recognise BB my cousin, who passed away about twelve years since." The "rain on my right was the sensational part of the whole affair. We are informed that the photograph presented, besides the picture of the photographer himself, the image of a young girl, twelve or thirteen years of age, apparently sitting in the chair ; the outline of the upper part of the body was clearly defined, though dim and shadowy j the chair was distinctly seen through the body and arms, as also was the table, upon which one arm rested; below the waist (which was apparently clothed in a dress with low neck and short sleeves the image faded away into a dim mist, which simply clouded the lower part of the picture. This American Cousin in no way related to the Dun- dreary family-was n wonder, a puzzle, a mystery. Mr. Slack asserted to all that the image resembled his deceased cousin, and that its appearance on the picture was wholly unexpected by him, and startled him much. No sooner did his ghostly photograph become known in Bcston, than the genus multiplied with surprising fertility Numerous photographs made their appearance, each presenting a faint image besides one or more fully-developed character; and each image was declared to be a dead relation of the real sitter. In one there was "the spirit of a lady sitting in a chair, with a white undefined mass of something behind her, like two or three pillows; in another was " a faintly defined form of a young man playing the guitar ;" in another, a female figure with the hair dressed quite plain and Quakerhh, a small white collar about the neck, tied with a dark ribbon, and a close-fitting dress, visible only to the waist;" in another, " a female figure floating in the air ; " in another, two images, one of an old man, and one of a young woman and so forth. All these were irrespective of or subsidiary to the real portrait in each picture and there were persons ready to declare that, in each case, the image represented a deceased relation of the real sitter. Now, we have said that we purposely avoid the mention of names in this matter ; those who are curious on this point may consult the pages of the Spiritual Magazine. It is right, however, to notice what photographers have to say on the subject. Mr. Blank and Dr. Dash ask us to believe that the phantom imagines came upon the photographs by spirit-power, whatever that may be that in some cases the sitter can bring about this result by simply wishing that his dead relatives may appear in the picture ; and that its media for the latter must be a sensitive spiritual medium-loses this strength if he does this more than three or four times in a day. When, however, the American Photographic Society heard of and saw these things, it speedily pronounced them to be " a fraud and gross deception." The truth is, photographers are acquainted with three or four different ways in which secondary images may appear in photographs. In the first place, when a sensitive glass plate has served its turn as a negative-as many paper positives is may be needed having been taken from it-the film of collodion or other prepared surface is removed from it, and it may then be used for a wholly new photograph. But it is found that, unless great care be used, some faint traces of the former picture still remain, and these may appear as a sort of ghostly attendant upon the figure forming the second picture. One photographer, in endeavouring to utilise an old plate which had fulfilled its duty as a negative of the late Prince Consort, could not wholly erase the image, wash or rub as he might ; there was always a faint shaft t of the Prince accompanying any subsequent photograph taken on the same plate. Dr. Phipson relates that a friend of his received at Brussels a box of glass plates, quite new and highly polished, each wrapped in a piece of the It\d<!pen. dance Beige newspaper ; a Jury sat for her photograph, taken on one of these plates, and both the photographer and the lady were astonished to see that her likeness was covered with printed characters, easily to be read-the ghost of a political article, in fact. In this case, atomic rays, as they are now called, had done their work before the glass was exposed to the camera. By another mode of manipulation, a photographer may produce a ghost-like fleet Messieurs; »pij^i»i4krw»a t« rtm*iaiat>Jo»m of the camera only half the time necessary to produce a complete photograph, he slips quickly aside, and the furniture can sedately behind him is then exposed to the action of the light, as a consequence, faint or imperfectly developed photograph of he man appeared, trial parent or traiiBlucent, for the furniture is visible apparently through his body or heal With a little feet, a really surprising effect may be produced in this way As a third variety, one neg hive may be placed in contact with another, and a particular kind of light allowed to pass through it for a time, there results a double picture on the lower negative, one fainter than the other It is known, moreover, to the most scientific lines of photographers, that if the lens in the camera is imperfectly curved at the surfaces, spots of cloudy light may appear in the photograph, having a s mi gives ly sort of effect As a wind up to this Boston enterprise, the editor of the Photographic News allowed his purse to be gently bled, that he might he able to tell his readers what the whole affair meant the Spi itual Magazine announced the sale in London of " spirit photo graphs," in packets containing three pictures, for three shillings and sixpence The packet s were sealed, and were not allowed to be opened until the buyer had paid for them The buyer in this case, an experienced photographer, paid for a packet, brought it home, opened it, and found just what he expected the photographs had each been taken from a negative which had been twice exposed to the camera, for two different Bitters, or at any late had had a double manipulation bestowed upon them Two of them had obviously been taken from imperfectly cleaned old plates and of these two, one contained the veritable picture of Mr. Black, and the faint image of his alleged ye ung ' Cousin ' What the editor thought of his purchase is expressed in terms sufficiently clear and energetic We need say nothing more on this ghostly photographic subject, than that, if a reader will look right and left in Cheapside and some other of our public thoroughfares, he will find in the photographers' windows and show cases many curious and even beautiful " gho t ' effects, without any attempt at spiritualism whatever
