* Above the speaker. j Br TnroTHKOS. " Timotheus placed on high." The Assembly might sit just now for the model House or the good boy Chamber of the empire Federation has made a band of brothers of the members " None are for a party and all are for the state ' though with due regard to the position of the body politic, the hens cannot be continued by the affirmation that the rich man loves the poor man and the poor man loved the great it is in the Assembly as though the Ins had nothing to fight for and the Outs had nothing to hope for When in the National Con- vocation a constitution was sketched which would, it was said bring about and perpetuate this condition of amity, Mr Munro remarked, " It might be all right, but it would be very dull And there is no reason to suppose that the hon. member has varied this opinion after the results of the week Ministers have, however settled down to their places in the comfortable conviction that they will see the next general election, and that the event in question will not occur till March, when no matter what happens comes the blind fury with the abhorred shears and slits the thin spun life the Opposition do not mean to adopt offensive tactics Their policy is to watch and wait Considering that Mr Gillies and Mr Deakin were seven years and a half in office, it will be quite time enough if twelve months hence they are lifting up their heads to look about them and to make calculations that is supposing that both are there to lift up their heads Besides, the long reign of the Coalition kept out of office members whom a host of friends desire should have a chance and these personal friends and well wishers of individual Ministers are on the Opposition benches With this Ministry about him Mr Munro might have been in power 12 months before he was for all that the bulk of the Opposi- turn are As to the corner members who never intended to put in Mr Shiels and Mr M Lean, Mr Duffy, Mr Wheeler nor Sir Frederick Sargood and Mr Simon I Fraser and the others, and who would like nothing better now than to put them out they are pretty well watched and guarded Each man has a ghost at his elbow, the spectre of a labour candidate ready to slip into his seat, and in Parliament, as in the midnight chamber, the presence of a ghost-of an impalpable dread-has a paralysing effect. It cannot be said that a federal debate is going on in the House As it takes two people to constitute a quarrel, so there must be two sides to form a debate, and there is practically only the one side to day The proceedings ore the delivery of a series of addresses on federation, and it must be said of this monologue, as of all other monologues that its tendency is towards monotony It must be admitted, however, that federalists have every right to be astonished by this success Nothing like it has ever been seen before in connection with so big a question Sir Bryan O'Loghlen and Mr M Intyre are like unto Don Quixote and his squire, for if they are sound, then there is something wrong with most others "Look at that terrible clause 52 exclaims Sir Bryan , " it means that all our trades will be driven to New castle and all our farms will be laid desolate Full tilt go knight and squire at the windmill-for this clause is the intercolonial reciprocity which most people think 13 to benefit all " Behold that giant ex claims the knight, " it advances to rob the country of its much prized financial control -and the monster turns out to be the democratic Senate of the United States The anti federalists have only one strong suit to play, and that is to appeal to the farmers Mr McIntyre and Mr Groom led off the same evening but the effort to rouse the settlers is a failure so far as the House 13 concerned Some of the old stock tax advocates responded with cheers, but they were only a handful Mr Highett and Mr Anderson shook confidence in the idea of a farmers' revolt, and not much life was left in the policy after Mr Armytage had read the declaration of the farmers conference for federation Certainly the change in the tone of the House is remarkable When it met two years ago it was all for duties on intercolonial products 1 rue the stock tax was rejected, but, as a set off, there was a clapping on of charges on all farm produce from oats to eggs To suggest that these duties were either use less or impolitic was to expose the rash utterer of such sentiments to dark imputations that liberalism was not in him And now hon. members one 11 nil nil are ready and eager to embrace the sister states and to declare that they are brothers The constituents of Mr Graves are said to believe that an open market will enrich them, honest Mr Ferguson never recollects the time when his farmer voters did not long for federal union Mr Laurens was present at the birth of protection, and the duties, he declares, were aimed at pauper and prison and European labour, and not at our Australian kith and kin How hon. members managed to dissemble their love for the sister states so many Years need not be imagined The times require them to be Australian and Australian the we from pro socialists are the one Speech curiously anticipated, whether in the Council or the Assembly, was that of Mr Service And the question was whether the feelings of the "father of the cause the cause which is about to triumph-would prevail, or the feelings of the creator of the Federal Council which is about to fall through 'the good angel won the day, and so the hon gentleman gave the scheme his blessing But, unconsciously to Mr Service no doubt, the dark angel would seem to have had a finger in the pie in some of the criticisms Mr Trenwith had one of the most attentive audiences of the week, for there with some uncertainty as to how the 'Trades hall would to An alliance with Sir Bryan was possible, but in a few minutes the member for Richmond dispelled any illusion of that kind The Trades Hall was undoubtedly suspicious at first, but the blessed phruBc, " 1 adoration upon a democratic basis, ' Bay as the convention scheme from present con- demnation The break from Sir Bryan was complete But it is doubtful whether the farmers will altogether appreciate some of the Trenwith argument farming land will fall £1 per acre,' said Sir Bryan " And a good thing, Replied Mr Trenwith, "if it does If some of the potato land in the hon. members district would drop £10 an acre, the poor man could have a better chance But Mr Trenwith is likely to be disappointed here The expectation is-and the rule is-that union sends values up, and does not bring them down The unkindest cut Sir Bryan received came, however, from Mr Graves 'the member for Delatite has followed or has acted with Sir Bryan since the eventful day when the ex- Premier and treasurer made him a Minister that the hon. member took a mournful leay 0 of his former chief on this occasion Mr Graves did not say that he thinks Sir Bryan is wrong but he an era, which is much more to the point that the member for Port Fairy ' has misjudged public opinion The education of Mr Hancock is being rapidly proceeded with When the member for Collingwood made his first speech he, is he now explains knew nothing of bank of" Mr Munro has taken him in hand since and has convinced him that the particular institutions with which the Premier is connected do a Imirablc work Still he is sure or at least he was as late as Thursday last, that his constituents would welcome a bill to abolish the ' unlicensed pawnbrokers who keep just outside the criminal law and who he-up to date-be ht ves constitute two-thirds of the bankers Of federation also Mr Hancock knew little, but the speech of Mr Wrixon he says has informed him, and he will now vote for the bill with the Senate knocked out of it in view of this eiihthteiimint it is probably t to I for a few J Trades-hall delegates now and then to go through the Parliamentary course Only it would be somewhat awkward if they were so numerous that instead of learning from teachers they had to be fought by pains and stern events The week ends with the member for Collingwood " hating the sight of a soldier, disliking " the name of a Senate and objecting to the presence of (two thirds of the bankers but another month should tone much of this down The House so far has dealt admirably with its new member of the new order, chaffing him about his doctrines and complimenting him upon his courage in enunciating them, and the good temper of hon. members and their half flattery must be somewhat deacon certing Singlj, there is no doubt the delegate with astounding prejudices and no knowledge of affairs is amusing, and the only question is whether a crowd would not be dangerous " Did you hear Mr. Armytage? asked a Minister of the Crown " No ' " "Well, I like that young man And he made an excellent speech, but he spoilt it by that saying that rather than by e in a republic he would dwell down-right down-with his Satanic Majesty Now, I am a loyalist, you know, but I found Pans very agreeable, I could stand Geneva, and it was a disappointment I could not get to New York and Boston There are republics I could put up very well with, though we do not want one here ' Besides, rather than go to that hot place one would prefer " Balmacedaund Chili " Of course, the young are always too emphatic They do not hedge for any change of opinion Nor do they realise what an old age of re cantings they are preparing for themselves Just now the member for Grant is of an age to scorn the advice " For forms of government let fools contest, Whale or is best administered is best True, there may be more philosophy than patriotism in the verse, but, on the other hand, we administer best what we know best, and so we come to love it best also Again while it is permissible to allude to the Devil by name yet it is scarcely allowable to refer to his customary place of residence by any Saxon epithet And any reference should always be objective and not subjective Thus Mr Array tago should not send himself to the place where the Devil lives , but there is no objection to his sending the republics It would seem as if the last word in the most famous appeal case on record, Paul v A IltyhPneit (name unknown) has yet to be spoken The Melbourne Conference had it, the Sydney Convention,nndnowthe Victorian Assembly It comes up always in connection with the question whether Australians should be asked to forego the right of appeal to the Queen in Council and to take instead an appeal to a Supreme Court of the Federation Mr Armytage argues that Paul was right in using his right of appealing unto Caesar, and that every Englishman is entitled when cast in damages to say, " I am British, and I appeal to the British Throne ' But, says Mr Officer, Paul was a loser by his action, for Agrippa, turning to 1 estus, said, "the man might have been set at liberty if he had not appealed unto Caesar This view represents Paul as erring in judgment, and modern commentators seek to relieve the apostle of this Blur In any case, it is said, Paul was going to Rome for the purposes of his propaganda, and by making the appeal he say ed the church the expenses of his passage Unfortunately, in our case no man who is under sentence of imprisonment or of death is permitted to appeal unto Caesar, and if he appeals as he may, about his civil rights or his property, he must pay his own expenses and give security for his adv cranes costs The difficulty with a writer is how to begin, and with an orator the aw kw hardness is how to and the one does not know how to commence nor the other when to sit down The one desires to open well in order to attract the attention of his readers and the other to, finish effectively in order to leave a good impression on the audience Many a bad captain, says Dana, in Two Years G Before the Mast, saves his character with the crew by finishing the voyage liberally with plum duff, and an orator who has been ineffective e will obtain a consoling cheer if his first sentences are sonorous or epigrammatic In set debates, therefore, the peroration may be looked for it was in great force during the old reform discussion Mr Murray Smith led the way with an address carefully modelled on the classic orations-with exordium, statement, proof, and peroration-and in the latter respect he was eagerly emulated On the fifteenth day, when the subject had long been exhausted, the House was too wearied to listen patiently to another long rehash of old arguments, and attempted-as the worm will turn to put a particular orator down At least," said the victim, "of the House does not want to hear any speech, it will allow me to make my peroration, and placing his hands in his coat tail pocket, he produced the peroration, neatly written on foolscap paper 'the appeal was arrests fibre Each and every hon. member was touched by the recollection of his own labour, and the orator was allowed to percolate, and to earn a shout of satisfaction This time also the peroration have been good If Mr Speaker had only thought of it, one is sure that he would have offered a prize for the best given passage, and would thus have materially added to the interest of a debate which really-as no one knows better than he wants something to enliven it Mr Wrixon was highly successful with a picture of a mighty nation, with a free and well regulated Government resting on the broad foundation of a peoples will-Milton and Tennyson being laid under contribution for thoughts and phrases Dr Pearson made a hit with a prophecy that the rising generation will not look across the waste of blue when they speak of home, but will find in Australia a noble and sufficient father and Mr Derham was neat with a "British to the backbone " point, and Mr Officer was effective with a waving of the Australian flag over the Australian continent One would like to hear Mr Duffy perorate, but if anyone is to go higher than Mr Wrixon it will probably be either Mr Deakin or Mr Shiels If applause counts, Mr Murphy is entitled to high mention for a grand finish His address was rattling throughout, but, like the Tipperary car-driver, he had a gallop left for the avenue "God Save the Queen' has been sung at him in that Assembly, says Mr Murphy, but, for all that " if he fights for any nation it will be the British flag "
