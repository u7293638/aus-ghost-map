The Advertiser MONDAY, OCTOBER 2. The principal subject of discussion when Mr. Nock's Bill again comes before the Assembly will be the clause enacting that all public-houses shall be absolutely closed on Sunday, except against bona Jide travel lers. By the present law a side or {private door may be kept open from 1 to 3 is the afternoon, and from 8 to 10 o'clock in the evening to any thirsty souls, and ail day to travellers. Practically thuo%lMa; the effect xit closing, during church hour*, tie houses of publicans; Who obey the lav as far as they reasonably can, but it is absurd to suppose tint on every Sunday tibe top-room and pador are cleared, and the bar shut up as the dock strikes 8 o'clock. The fact b that some laws are so egregious that it is impossible that they can be enforced, and this is one of them. As enactment utterly forbidding the ?de of any liquor on Sunday might be more tyrannical, but would give the landlord much lees trouble than the ridiculous fiddling regulation that he is only to serve out liquor during two periods of two hours each on the Sabbath, There is great differ- ? eace of opinion as to the principle upon which public-houses are closed du ring church hours. If it is that^peraons may not be kept from church by the at tractions of the pothouse, thenit may fairly he said that mch a bw ia jnftontqafrfit- with that principle of which South Australia is •q proud—non-interference with religion^ We may take it, however, as generally un derstood that the front doors of inns a/d closed on Sunday, that the eyes and ears of the passers-by, of whom the majority will \>e accustomed to the English mode of I keeping Sunday, may not be offended by sights and Bounds of convivial enjoyment; and the house is closed altogether during church hours for the sake of the landlord. Why the State should exercise this care for pubficans, and neglect bakers and house hold servants, it would be ?Kffi*anit to gay; but at any rate the law, if inconsistent, has not worked oppressively or irritatingly. Mr. Nock is dissatisfied with the pre sent arrangement, however, and seeks to forbid absolutely the sale of alcoholic liquors on Sunday except to lodgers, or to travellers who have journeyed at bast firs ; miles. ; Wemustiu>weaquireuponwhatgroonds this weeping change is advocated, and what evidence s^: be* b>o*Al fo^wuf to prove its necessity. W ?*?* dear the wtj ?f inelevaaciea, fa* ahow from what standpoint the CMeitto beargufdi We•?!??*<*H?G?od1&fc-; pl?'8 platorm, forth* danse is aupperfed by n^ who, though as full of monriasnti ments as Joseph Surface, yet take their %uor?rtlaasta>fcindl* SBdmhisjaytaA foetiv* bwther. The? tU protiilltion of public-house drinking on Ifaifay be sought consistently upon Sabbatarian fringe**^t^ proprietors of hake nouses, td&f; and frutt shops might tremble. To support aach a prtniiakni upon any int?l%iUa principle* ? p?noa must $* both a fesWatfarian cad a Gsod rfeav- - p)ar f * or else, without necessarily bsing gitberyhe mast be convinced tint a vast amount of drunkenness takes place at public-houses on Sunday, and that the only way to tare the evil is to dAse these establishments altogether. Now, ] no proof whatever fata bees offend that there is any gnat amount of tHtatt cation on the Sabbath in this colony. ? ifcVffaek and bis friend* bare not aftampted to prodace cay evidence opon ; this point; and as we are not called epos \ to prore a negative, we meet then ban ; aneft?o?withadb%ctda?kl,aodchalkoge , them tbproVetileir case. It does not follow that because now and then a drunken man ; may be wen in the streets, or half ? dozes quietly drinking; in* publie4uM?e, ifc*t we are to plunge into cold water legislation, sad pass a Jaw that wffl be * standing affront and a mdssace to thoaaamfa of men every whit as sober as Mr. Nock or any of bis teUow-workaw in the cause of total abstinence. Not the least objection to the clause ie that each a p*epoflte*o*t atoifotence with personal comfort and the liberty ?f the ?übject woald sever be enforced. Could anything be more absurd than that if James Jones, a resident in a country town ship, called at an inn to snoot the eraniag with his friend, John Smith, who was \- than aa a taareUet ana Bonday ?reaiag; the latter might drink gin hot, and the other could have nothing stronger than gingerbeercold? Bat Mr. Nock's ckoae i? worse than this, for, if enforced, Jones could not visit hie friand at aU; ?ot being a traveller he could not enter the hotel without rendering the landlord liable to a fine of from £5 to £50, 2fcis is only one of many difficulties that would be encountered in the attempt to ' carry out such a law. We have beard the ForbefrM*A??*e AjcttxtdUA** *gwat success, but'there is testimony, on the other hand, to ltt na^na^, pnilnd. a ootaplets failure, and it is sard that there la more heavy drinking in Glasgow ?a Sandays than ever. It is urged that the publicans have as a body stated that they approve of Sunday dosing 'bting made ia*pentjti?fe/' but tiiis statemant is not correct. What they really asid wa? that they would have no objection to each a few, prortding it was applied to cafes and all other places of entertainment. Of course they knew very well that no one out of the iAnatic Asylum would be likely to reconunend sack a measure to the Parliament. When vexatious legislation is protested against, its advocates resort to platitudes about law rasceaftarfy fessript3|g individual liberty, aM wMh great coii6deac? ask a* the fact of being a cttisaa of any covntrjr, however free its institutiotis, does not in- f votve the aacrnfc^ of a portion of individual liberty, where it is for the public good. We fully assent to the somewhat antiquated nrapaaition embodied in this query, but deny that the closing of pubUe-honses on Sunday follows as a corollary. We give up a portion of our liberties, in order that we may preserve the remainder, ?ot seat we may give them away hit by bit, at the demand of every meddlesome enthusiast, however we?^eaning he may be. We do not say fitst we are never to concede mons than we have done; bat we shoal dnotyield on alight or donbtfal groand%and each fresh invasion of onr rights, each irksome restriction of our freedom of asttonjsfcoaid ba steadUy and firmly resisted, till it is proved that there is a great necessity for the unwelcome change, and that it will effect <he objects for which it is intended. Mr. Nock has not afforded such proof, and until he does so he cannot reasonably hope thai any de?beiatiTe aaasmbly <tf intelligent men can adopt his Sunday-dosing clause. Oca teant telegrams via Singapore are full of moment in regard to the ?&ia; of the East. A crisis is ?ride*f}y at hand. An official notification has been made by the Porte that it is willing to treat fat peace with its rebellious feudatory, Servia, but only on condition that its principal for tresses be oocia^ by Torkiafa tra^ ant others be demolished; that the Servian army be reduced from tome 80,000 to 10,000; that Prince Milan be invested wifr hk kiagiy power, in pawnee of the Sultan, as Suzerain, at Constantinople; <hat a railway be constructed, we presume for atmtegiaa parpoees, tiinmgb. the heart of the country; and that the cost of the war be defrayed by an indemnity or in creased tribute. The insolence of this de mand was equalled only by its absurdity. Unless, iadeed, events bad happened whkh have sot been telegraphed, foil of disaster for the Servian arms, it would be rejected indignantly by Servia. Terms more ruth less and degrading could scarcely be en acted if she had been smitten down by the armies of Islam into hopeless defeat.

The ma was running hf^u The skiffcame quite Jieartothe ship, appearing and disappearing at intervals. Now on the top of an immense wave level with the deck of the vessel, the next minute hidden from sight in the billows. The captain, calling to know who was in the boat, was answered in a strong German accent, 'I am John Johnson, from Gloucester, Massachusetts.' He told further that he was bound to Liverpool; that his skiff was named Centennial, and that he had been out 15 days. He fiien asked the captain to compare the reckonings. His i was long. 46 deg., lat, 39deg.; thecaptainV was the same. Johnson? informed the cap-' tarn that he slept by day, and before going to sleep he .took in his rudder-aad took down all bis sails; during sleep hfe craft' drifted with the waves. He was awake at nights, Johnson Jats in the centre of his boat, with a lamp burning before him, exposing tin dial of what seemed to be a compass. The deck afore and aft is covered with canvass, under which, beside the compass and lamp, were several barrels, containing, bo doubt, provisions, water, &c; The captain made* final appeal to him to. . come on board, stating that if he refusal hef would probably regret it .when the vessel was: out of his reach. To tiiis John?ohemphatioalrjr answered,' No, sir; good night,' and throwing bis sails to the wind was soon lost to sight." On Saturday evening the pantomime of "Prince Darling, or the fairy snowdrop," mt produced at the Royal, and caused much enter tainment. There was a large attendance, except in the dress circles, and young and old laughed heartily at the comicalities of the per formers. The piece is supposed to be Aus tralian in its scenes, and with ghosts, sprites, fairies, and magicians, belonging rather to the old world. There come or follow a kangaroo, an emu, aboriginals, and bushmen, m?Hng altogether a peculiar medley. The text is lively, and local hits were introduced, but the meaning was to a great extent lost in the de livery. Mrs. Towers sang well; Misb Daley's fine voice was j often heard, to advantage,aad this young lady had to respond to encores; and the dances were good. Miss Bosa Towers .played Prince Darling with vivacity, and her 'little sister- won great applause and several 'encores by her sprighly intelligent acting and .delivery. Mr. Towers seemed quite at home in •the part of the clown; Mr. Carey was equally efficient as pantaloon;Mr.Brown kept the game ? alive as harlequin; and Miss Dolly Forde was a graceful Columbine. The oilier characters :were fairly rendered, and the piece ran smoothly with the exception of afew hitches, principally iin connection with the Davenport Brothers' jburtasque, which was not a success. The panto- . smhne will be repeated to-night. !
