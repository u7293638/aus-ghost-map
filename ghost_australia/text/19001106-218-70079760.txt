I was strong all at once-desperately strong. And what brought about this change? That simple receipt which I lihnd in my poclket. An deraon had nothing to show tltat tlre money had bceen p:id, and was not my unaided word as good as his? I was foolish enough to believe that I could brave it through, and I grew confident aud quite easy at cllce, "There, Carrie," I said quietly, "I am much better now. The room was too warm, I guess.

She did so, and I started for hopme. You may guess tlhit my slumber that night was not sound nor refreshing. I never passed a more inierable night. "Why. Fred, you look as though you met a legion of ghosts last night," said. Mr. Winston as he came into the office the next morning. "What is the mat-, ter?' "I did not sleep well," I answered4 with a smile. "By the way," continued my employ. yr, "did you write to Anderson as I re uested?" I do not know how I maniaged to re ply, for the question set me shivering from head to foot, and I was so weak that I could scarcely sit in my chair. I imust have answered in the aflirmative, however, for lihe said: "Then we itay look for something from him tomorrow oy next day." Irm mediately afterward lie added: "Why, Fred, you shiver as though you had the ague, and you are sweating like a butch er1 You're ill,maunl Come, jump into my trap, and I'll take you home." I was glad of the chance to get away, and on reaching home I locked myself in. Ah, those were terrible hours I passed, and night brought no relief. -Can you guess what I was meditating? Cow ard that I was, Ihi'ad.resolved on self deo struction. Ibiegin rjiy preparation with .the-me.calhsie- s and deliberation thai I would-have used'ini fhe nnstE?5u--Srâ€¢ transaction. I wrote a short explan tion to Carrie, another for Mr. Winston. a third for my mother. In a fourth en relope I inclosed the receipt to lMr. An derson.. All this accomplished, I went to' my wardrobe and took out moy re volver. Having examined the cartridges-to make sure there would be no failurq, I sat down before the fire and placed the pistol against my forehead. In another second I should have been lifeless, buat just as my finger began to press the trig ger there was a tap on my door. it startled me, and easily concealing my weapon I called out that I could admit no one. "Not me, Fred?" I knew Carrie's voice, and a yearning to look once again into lier loved face nmastered me. Quietly slipping the tell tale letters which I had left on the table into my pocket, I opened the door. "Oh, Fred, you are really ill!".e : claimed Carrie the moment the light fell on my face. "Why did you not send for me? Aren't you better?" "Worse," I answered huskily. "But, Carrie-good. heavens!" As I uttered this exclamatlon I started back and then fp.rard, for hanging across Carrie's arm was my overcoat. Recovering from miy notonislnent, I drew from the pocket $11,750.2:. You have heard about the singular capers of a madman or .the wild antics of those crazed with rum, hut judging from what Cnarri told me and from the appearance of my apartment after it was over I am led to believe that I was far more grotesque. Then 1 asked for an exphlnation. It wIa t?mo simplest thing iqhaginable. Ide gnot know why I had not thought of it beforp. It was simply 4 blulnder of.Car Fie'g fitiler. He had mistaken my coat for his own and had worn it down ,town. never thinking that a fortune was ly-::lg ii, the pocket. - I sent Mr. Anderson his re ceipt, handed the money to Mr. Winston and went on with my duties a wiser and.
