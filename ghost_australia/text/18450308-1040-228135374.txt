SONNETS DEDICATED TO SENATORS. NO. VI. Who'd have thought it? Why, he votes with the opposition! "Least then, a selfish and designing man Hath changed his object when his means are changed." From an unpublished Poem. Vote as thou wilt, D------! on thy brow The mark remains. No Rogue in Shakspere's song Beats step for step more constantly with Wrong, Maugre the seeming of his means, than thou Still pip'st to the old Tune! A Turncoat! How? Just what the "Darlings" of thy factious zeal Were formerly unto the public weal, Are not our Wentworths, Boyds, and Windeyers, now? But what if that old sturdy tyrant—he, Thy Fortune's father,—just were come to see, So much as voting with the Bullock roaster, One of his most peculiar petlings? 'Gad! But he would stare at thee, like Herod mad, And thou at him as thou hadst seen a ghost, sir! A SPIRIT OF THE PAST.
