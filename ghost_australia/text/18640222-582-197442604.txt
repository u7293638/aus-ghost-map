THEATRE ROYAL. - , The novel and attractive nature of the enter tainment- offered on Saturday evening at this place of amasement, induced a very good atten dance, and all appeared highly delighted with the varied and amusing programme placed be fore them.

The en tertainment was announced for repetition to night, and we would recommend all to see the original Pepper's Ghost, to say nothing of the other most amusing portions of the entertain ment-.
