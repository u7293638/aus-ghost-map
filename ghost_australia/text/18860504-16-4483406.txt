VRZBULITY. (Queen.) Mass capacity for belief is practically unlimited Surrounded by mysteries to which science has is yet brought no solu- tion met every where by the great wall of the Unknown-he him clothed all life with the elastic g u ment of Possibility), and " It may be so , we do not know is the four mill i winch confesses his ignorance and accepts its consequences This credulity is of course in exact ratio with this ignorance Tell a child that the old moon is cut up into stirs, and that the new is born if -she each month, and, having no knowledge, it, will believe is it is told Tell a person of ordinary education, not specialize!, that the new star which has lately appeared in the nebula of Andromeda his just burst into being, and that this age has witnessed the mu role of a sudden creation, and that too will be believed But the astronomer, who knows his science, does not trouble himself about the theory of the chopped-up old moon which goes to make the state and as little does he accept that of the sudden creation of a bl rising sun It may be said that astronomy is an exact science, to be verified or disproved According to fixed rules, and that we can- not plead this exactness about those things wherein credulity is chiefly exercised those messages from the unseen-those Intel red ences with the orderly sequence of phenomena, now held as law-that direct in imputation of ciiciiuistmces and materials. which make up the sum of modern marvels the great May Be overshadows the unknown and reduces it to a kind of nebulous hire wherein we see nothing distinctly thus giving room for every kind of grass in a mist on a mountain side, that thing loom- ing huge and dark before you maybe a. horse or a cow, a lock of a house you cannot tell All you know is that you are surrounded by a thick white v Spour, where you can see neither your path not your sur soundings, not yet make out the true ships of the objects which confront you Hence your com opinions have the light each to his own opinion and he who goes in for the cow there) li is is lunch no reason on his side is he who believes in the House and the believers in the lock are neither worse nor better than in the in retainers of the house Verification by a nearer approach and a clearer atmosphere can alone determine the question ; when perhaps the black big object is found to be none of these things, but a far as bush magnified by the man to the size of a house met concealed is to its fine by pipe Where, then, pray, was the wisdom of falling to logged heads over each improvable theory though to be sure the wide mouthed Zany who has opened a bandit H on Skiddaw, or expected to tumble over one of the old gods on Olympus might be reasonably ridiculed and told to leave conjectures to those who had then brains in better keeping and more wholesome ordering Few weeks pass in succession without some story of gross credulity, making those of us who are beyond that elemental sphere smile with pity and wonder combined. Now it is a servant girl who gives her had earned little s givings to the Ruler of the Stars in the back kitchen, on the faith of his promising her a love or, with a horse to ride and a gold chain to wear Now it is a farmer down in the simple West, whose stockyard has been bewitched by a spiteful neighbour and who has to " draw blood" for a counter charm.

That a do gum impossible runs through more sections of thought than into which it was originally founded, and, however, I aw ful for certain topics, it is the most dangerous of all the journal is ever propounded by man for others We find the same credulity in distant The central point of a character the h chit of a life, the one salient virtue of a man, is ignored as if it had not been proved again and again, and a quite different set of qualities are assigned on the flimsiest evidence of appearance A friendship that has expressed itself for years in deeds as well as words, is assumed to have suddenly died out, because a letter has miscarried, or, for want of an address has never been sent The credulous fondness for believing evil shows itself in a thousand ways, and that large hearted man in goodness, unseen and demonstrated, but practically) proved a hundred times, gets to the will like the w cakes in a fray All those who are able to delve deep into another's mind come to tracts of credulity - that is, to beliefs entirely unsupported by evidence which to make them wonder at the folly, and sometimes despair of the advance, of him out) Some believe in thewiikbpiead habit of secret poisoning, and, without the smallest fi action of evidence, in mit in that the Queen's lieges are cleared off the face of the earth, with no more regard to coroner's inquests on the suspicions of friends thin so many i its in a bus Others have Jesuits on the beam, and hold to the creed which places a Jesuit in the centre of every web and the holder of all the reins Some look on dr earns as supernatural warnings and pick up the fragments of then waking impressions as c usefully as if they were solid words bent it in heaven to be their guides and governors And some go in for the special gifts of peers and peeresses, and credit the interpretation given to the juxtaposition of buds and symbols They forget the whole of mi of revolution which must have been before that interpretation can be correct, and they slink your question if ) on ask them do they see honestly believe that some unseen influence shuffled the cards by the hands of the m i npiikitoi and sn watched the age of di imonds which, next to the queen of hearts, betokened one thing to place it by the king of spades-me ming another S G nubléis in lotteries and in the tables are supremely) superstitious in these things and that u seen genius- good or bad, is it may chance-called Luck, is something not to be doubted nor denied Some go in for the mistakes which, done by one by the power of supers and these, are copied by the professed conjurers at so much a head, entrance money A few pessimists new in the downfall of society, and show how all his and order, civilisation and progress, learning and science will be swept away at the bidding of the brutal mob And one credulous di earner holds that the world is dead It died on the first year of this decade, and we are all like so many snake-skins hanging on to a withered branch with skeleton-and leaves Of a robbery, evidently planned and executed within the house, certain credulous mistresses believe that a spirit, or a burglar who came down the chimney, had a hand in it, rather than the favourite servant whom Inspector X suspects A stupid woman, dull in talk and heavy in bearing, who spends half her days in society, is supposed to write all those phenomenally swift-paced books which pass under her name and would be enough for two industrious machines and when those who are not credulous suggest that a "ghost" may be in the library as well as the studio, they are met by reflections less complimentary than explicit It is so much easier to these others to believe a marvel than to find a reasonable explanation Nevertheless, perhaps these very people believe Miss Delia Bacon's theory that Shakspeare was not his own poet, or that other hypothesis put forward in a plausible pamphlet a generation or so ago, that Sir Walter Scott was only the stalking-horse, and his brother the real wizard Give the credulous by nature a hobby to ride, and, whatever their intellectual acquire- ments, they will ride it to death. A comparative m) geologist of this kind sees only one cause, one origin, for all the religions of the world. He cannot accept the blending of many causes, but stops dead, like a pointer who has just sniffed at a partridge and no amount of game commingling on the scene will call him off It is all either dreams or ancestors-either the sun or the night either the elements or ghosts He will not accept this bit and that has to make a general whole, but goes on severely for Unity, and sees nothing else He is able to force all circumstances to his own view, and no dis- crepancies are too great for his acceptance \- no gaps too wide for his jump He is intellectually credulous, because mari owed to one point only, and unable to accept the third dimension length and breadth he knows, but thickness including another side-to that he is blind, and he will not be couched so that he may see He finds a myth in a nursery rhyme and in days to come, when the origin is forgotten, his successors will probably construct a recondite kind of puzzle out often s " Nonsi use verses," to which comparative mythology will fit the key Then the opposing interpreters will call each other hard names, and credulity will laugh as she hoodwinks her followers Meanwhile a calm and wholesome suspension of judgment is the best frame of mind to cultivate, and to believe too rashly is as bad for the brain as to deny too obstinately. Mud can no more retain a shape than granite can run itself into a new mould, and in neither is there life or growth.
