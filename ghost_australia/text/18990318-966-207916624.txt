Truly. Frank Darrel. was a very foolish young gentleman to indulge in so confused'a reverie. Hut lie was only twenty-live, and he was in love—two excuses that cover "the follies of the majority of mortals. Shown into the presence of his goddess, the worshipper <*rf<v,- red -and confused, rather io the surprise of Donna Maria, as she had no notion of the disturbed state of "his heart. 3'o put him at his ease, she sought to induc« speech bv asking him vrhat be wished to see her about. Then Frank became more confused than ever, for he did not reiy well know how to begin. However, as a beginning had to be made, he spoke to the noint and in a brusque way, by reason of his modesty. _ *"! have come to tell you how the ease is getting on," he said hurriedly. •"That is very kind of you." replied Donna Maria, half smiling at his humour, although she secretly wondered what could be rile cause of it. "Has anything been discovered about m.v poor uncle's.murder?" "Xot so much that as aljout the banknotes." "The banknotes?" Donna Marin turned pale and spoke nervously. "Yes: the ten thousand pounds that was stolen from the safe. The money lias bean returned to Captain Manuel." Donna Maria rose suddenly. "It can't be," she cried, malting a step towards the astonished Frank. "I tpy you it can't lie." "But it is, Misf Sandoval. Captain Manuel has the money now in liis jxxwessicn." "Then the assassin of my uncle lias been arrested?" "No, I am sorry to say he has" ."Not arrested?" cried Donha Maria, her colour rising and her eyes sparkling, "and the money returned?" "The money was returned by an unknown man," said Frank, "and he went away after delivering t)lie parcel of notes at Captain Manuel's hotel." "Then that was the assassin* He took the money from my uncle's dead Iwdy. In fact, .1 believe be killed - Mr. Greiit in k order to rob him." *But how can that be?" cried Dan-el, much perplexed. " Mr. Grent left the money in his private safe, and did not-come back to fret it. How could he have been in possession of the money on that night?'"' Maria passed her hand across her forehead and siirhed. "True! true! What am I to do? Oh"—she wrung her hands—"if I could only speak." "You must' speak," said Frank, seizing Ss opportunity, "or else condemn an innocent man." "yAp innocent man. Who?" "Mr.. Frederick Leighbournc. We have found out that he changed some of the notes, so it is just possible that he may be accused of the robbery." "No, no," cried Maria, much agitated, "it cannot be. Mr. Leinlibourne did not take Lliat jnoney out, of tlie safe. I can prove it." "Then do so, and save him from possible arrast." The girj looked wildly round the room, then she ran to the window, sprang back to open the door and close it again; finally she paused before Frank and. seized his hand. The touch thrilled him. "Mr. Darrel," she said hurriedlv. "von are a gentleman, and I trust you." I have kept silent out of fear of the Secret Society, but I shall do so no longer. Mr. lieiglibourne did not take that monev out of the safe, but I can tell you who "did." "Captain. Manuel?" asked Darnel, with a start. "No," she said slowly. "Maria Sandovil." "You! You!" "1—I took the money and gave it to Mr Grent/' CAPTER XML—THE LOCKE I . ' The information was so unexpected and terrible that Frank felt the blood leave bis cheeks. Pale as a ghost he rose from his chair, and looked at Donna Maria with dilated eyes. From her confession he fancied that she must be implicated in the double crime; and a feeling of terror seized him at the idea of the woman lie loved having brought herself within reach of the law. Donna Maria saw his expresJ sion, and, with the swift instinct of her sex, guessed his thoughts. With a haughtv gesture she flung back her head, and her eyes sparkled like stars on a frosty night as she spoke to him. "Oh, don't think I have done auythiug rong!" she cried defiantly. "What I did was at the request of my uncle. Sit down.' Mr. Darrel, and I'll tell you tUe story iii ! detail." She pointed to his chair with a regal gesture, and when he resumed his seat faced him with a wonderfully composed look. She began her confession—as it may be called—tamely enough; but as tfie storv became more dramatic she warmed to her work, and finished with ail the lire, and fury, and gesticulation of her southern nature. Frank, (sympathizing with her quick spirit, was enthralied by her beauty, moved by her eloquence, and felt that here was a wpman to die for. '"When my uncle took leave .of us here to go to Italy," she said, "he callcd me into his study, and after asking me not to reveal what he was about to tell me, made a confession. That I reveal it now is to save an innocent'man from arrest." "True enough, Sliss Sandoval. But the confession?" "Was that when in Lima, ten years ago at which time he married m- aunt—he had becomc entangled with' a certain Association called " "The Peruvian Patriots," interrupted Frank. "L know all about that Society and its green mummies. Go on. please." "Well. -Mr. Grent was bound in some way—I don't know hc-w—to assist, this Society, under penalty of death. lie married, and came to England, and tnougiit he would hear no more about the matter. But this year,. Captain Mann el, with that £10,(100 which belonged to the Peruvian Patriots, came to London, and tailed to see my uncle. In his hands—after reminding him of his conneetio-n with the Society —Manuel p.aced the money and told h;ai to look after it. Mv uncle did so, and kept it in this house. A week before his murder he found on this table a Oreen Image." "Ah! a Green Mummy—the sign of death/' "Preciselv, and with it a letter stating that the money was to be -jiaid over to another member of the Society, called Centa—a man whom my uncle had never seen. Failing this, the letter declared. Mr. Grent would be killed. Now," continued Mnria, "my uncle. was so terrified at tne thought of being secretly assassinated—for he knew the power and recklessness of the Screiety—that he resolved to obey this letter." How did he know that the letter was authentic?" By the Green Image. Only members of he Peruvian- Patriots possess these tombmages, and they are not obtainable in England, or, for the matter of that, in eru either.""* " "fi'in! 1 suppose he was right to believe n the letter? Well, so he resolved to obev it and hand the money over to the myserious Centa?" " "Yes; but he wished to do EO -without etting Manuel know, as he was afraid le.st anuel, enraced r.l the -want of faith shown o him by the Society, might take i he la^v nto his own hands, and assassinate him." Darrel could not help laughing. "Mv ear lady," said he, "I am afraid Mr. Grent ust have been a credulous man. Xhe aw does not countenance wholesale murder this country whatever it may do in P "hit vou forget!" gripd .Donna Maria ngrily. "My ujfcle's forebodings came i s rue. He was murdered by the Society, as t « he token of the Green Mummy left beside j 'fc.jk , ' ; ^r isSIBTBD KY CKCLE TO SAVE HIS tTFE. 3 iym prores: but whether by Manuel or tenia I cannot say." •'Why," said Frank thoughtfully, ''there is something in that: but we'll discuss the point later. Please continue." "Well, Mr. Darrel, my un^Ie determined to take the money up to" the Hank in Fleetstreet and put it in his private safe. Then Sic intended to write a letter to Manuel asking him to call at his rooms in Dukestreet on Saturday afternoon. He designed to tell Manuel that the money was in the Bank, and tiiat if ]io wanted to see it there he could ask Mr. Van:. to show it to him. In the meantime 1 was to go to tile Bank on Saturday morning on the pretence of getting the tickets for the journey— which had been purposely left behind—and get the money." "But how were you to open the safe?" "Why, Mr. Grent gave me his private key." ' "Oil, 1 understand: but," added Darrel, "if you were to take av/ay the money, and Captain Manuel ivas to be told in the afternoon that he could see it in the Safe the whole thing would come out, as the money would not ba there for him to see."' "Xot at ail. You forget that it was Saturday, and Cantain Manuel could not look into the ,- .safe - before , , , Monday , -.-.- morning. — • Xovr, my uncle intended to give the money to Vm.a Ccnta nil on Saturday Sal.iir.1nv nignt „•<,„<\- and then «,, 0gto Italy: so, you see, there was absolutely no danger." "A very pretty plot," said barrel dryly. "So you agreed to assist in it?" Donna Maria flushed red, and responded rather haughtily—"I am from Lima, and I know how terrible is the vengeance of the Peruvian Patriots when they are betrayed. I assisted my uncle to save his life."' "So it fell out as.planned?" " Yes, M r. Grent took the mouev up on Friday, "and placed it in the safe, with Mr. Vass as a witness. Then he went to his rooms and telegraphed to me to do impart.- I went up on Saturday morning oil the pretence of getting the" tickets, and saw Mr. Vass in my uncle's private room. To get.rid of him I asked him for a glass of water. He left the room, and I at once opened the safe with the l;r-y given in me by my uncle. When Mr. Vr.ss returned with the water tiie safe was locked again, and I had the notes in my pocket. In the afternoon I went to Mr. Grent's rooms and gave him the money. Then I s-iid good-bve, and came away. My uncle told me that he bad seen Captain Manuel." "'Yes, I kornr Manuel called: Meek said so; and I- suppose Grent told him to look into the sale on Monday. As a matter of fact, he did not do so until Tuesday or V\ ednefeday, and then Yass discovered the less. But tell me. how' did Mr. Grent hope to pacify Manuel /"' " "By abscnce. He intended to write from Italy, and tell him that lie had given the' money to Centa; and as he proposed to remain abroad fcr some time, lie thought that Manuel's auger would abate, and "he would not wisli to harm hiin when he returned.'" "I see," said-Frank thoughtful]-.-. "I must sav that Mr. Grent provided for his own safety rem^-kably well." ""And all in vain, poor man,"' sicrhed Mana, '-'since he was killed by the Society.'" "I don't believe he was," said Darrel bluntly. "But the Green Image?" • "What about the returned money, Miss Sandoval? Why should the Society instruct Manuel, or Centa, to kill Grout and rob Iris body, then give back the monev to iteelf? That's robbing Peter to pay Paul with a vengeance." " "So it is. I can't understand it at all." "Then again," said Frank, warming, "did you not take two tickcts from tiie'Bank?" "I don't know. Mr. Grent mentioned only one ticket, and it was in an envelope. But now you mention it, Mr. Darrel, the envelope was rather bulky; there might have been two tickcts." "There Were: one for Mr. Grent, the other for Miss Hargone. She had arranged to dope Tilth Grent; at least, she foolqd him into believing so, but instead'of goin"' she sent Julia. Brawn, disguised in tlfift fawn-oloured mantle.' Then Grent was killed." vrhomV asked Maria, much agitated. "I can't say. Perhaps that Ccnta-you speak of got wind that Greut was bolting with the money to Italy, and followed to kill him. But who can tell? It is all .a mystery." "I don't wish to speak ill of the dead," said Maria, with a sigh, "but it seems to me that my uncle was acting very badly. That he should deceive my poor aunt, iviio loved liiin so dearly!" And a tear trickled down her face. Darrel said nothing, but he was cuitc satisfied that he knew'the extent of "Grent's villainy. He bad stolen the £10,000 in surdi a way as tp throw the blame on Vass, and he had intended'to fly to South Aniw icr. with Lydia Hargone, deserting his wife for i woman who had deceived him at the last. 3?ut Providenc<|, which rules all tiling?, had an unknown man. As lie had sown, so had he reaped. "Let me ask you one thing," said Daircl. as he took his leave; "why did you not tell us this before?" "Because, in the first place, I promised my uncle to keep silent; and in the second, he told me that if I spoke the Society— since he hoped to escape it—might kill my aunt. It was for her sake that I kept siltfat." "t-ies! "Lies! Lies!" thought Darrel. "What a liar Grc-nt was." When he got back to town he saw To:-ry and told him the whole story, whereat the detective was much pleased. "Didn't I say that Grent stole the money!" said he, slapping his thigh. "What a plot to get it, the cunning old fox! I'm almost loth to catch and hatig the' man who lolled him." "Tin; hare runs yet on the mountains." said Darrel drily, and took his leave of the jubilant detective to go home and dream of Maria. The interview with her had left him more in love than ever. Next morning he was hardly awake when, Xoitj-, wildly excited, burst into bis bedroom, and executed a kind of wai--dance. "I've found the tramp who robbed the dead body of Julia Brawn," he cried, "and he gave up this locket, which he took from her noek. See! Sec! It is of gold, with letters "G.Y. to J.B.' That is the lover to the lass." , "The lover ot Julia Brawn?" said Darrel, jumping out of bed. "•yes, yes; the man whe o was with her on that night. The rn.an who killed Grent!" But his name—his_ name?" Look at the initials, G.V.— Gustavus Vass. He fi; the murderer!" .
