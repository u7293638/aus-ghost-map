CHURCH INTELLIGENCE. On Sunday morning the Rev. John Gardner, of Victoria, who for many years occupied the puJpit of Chalmers Church, Adelaide, preached from the desk once more to a crowded congre gation. He took as his text the words:-" For our Gospel come not unto you in words only, but also in power and in the Holy Ghost, and in much assurance" (I. Thessalonians, i. 5.) The rev. gentleman preached a powerful sermon on the necessity for personal holiness in a manner which clearly showed that age has Dot dimmed the force and fire which he threw into his work in bygone days. The congregation comprised many of the rev. gentleman's old paiishioners, who at the close of the service met him in the veBtry, and warmly welcomed him to the colony once more.
