THE DUTY ON IMPORTED FRUIT. TO THE EDITOR OF THE ARGUS. Sir-Our attention having been drawn to letter in JVie fronts of the 27th me signed " Sour Grapes, ' purporting to be e answer to a communication of ours upon the above subject in another journal, v shall feel obliged by your allowing t the opportunity of making a few remarks upon that letter, and also upon the duty levied upon imported fruit Your corr spondent states that he had read my letter with considerable interest, and I was ashamed of our selfishness Now Sir, we look upon such an expression as this as a very strange one indeed, an which no man in his proper senses would ever have made use of If "Soi Grapes " was ashamed he could not I much interested None but a move in writing would have used such language, Bruce to be pleased and delighted with the same thing is a utter impossibility ' Sour Grapes' ah says that if that iniquitous individual the consumer had any voice in the matter, there would be some reason your observations ' Now, unluckily for the champion of protection, it so happens the the consumer is the very road that does grumble, because he has to pay in Melbourne Od all for grapes which can be bought in Adelaide for Id This is a nut-although no a cocoanut for ' Sour Grapes to crack who goes on to say that we have not enjoyed so many years the blessings of protection only to have such ridiculous considerations obtruded again on our notice ' Now if, as ' Sour Grapes ' Ima it, protection had proved such a blessing to our own growers it must have been a curse to those in the other colonies Talk about selfishness forsooth, we should like to know by what other name we could call this As to our own selfishness in the matter, anybody may see that to advocate, as we have done, a repeal of the duty on imported fruit we should be giving offence to our own growers and thus be far more likely to injure than benefit ourselves 'The grand object, says "Sour Grapes of our present system is that every one should be protected, and thereby benefited, at the expense of every one else " Really this is too much of a good thing toputupwith but there is more meaning in such an expression as this than the writer is aware of No doubt protection is intended to benefit our own growers, but it has a tendency to run the exporters " If we are to attempt observes ' Sour Grapes,' to supply the conBumerwitu good and cheap articles, what is to become of our chicory mills, our colonial breweries, and other exhilarating and wealth giving institu- tions?" What an absurdity to talk about such things as these, as if they had anything to do with the duty on imported fruit. " Sour Grapes " takes up the cudgels on behalf of the brewers, but he is a poor and sorry champion. So far as the brewers are concerned, it would appear from the late fearful disclosures that they make use of a great variety of poisonous ingredients, to Riv of strength, go, to that exhilarating Beverage colonial squash, and also use enormous quantities of cheap sugar, instead of malt and hops, which are too expensive for them. There is one other passage in Sour Grapes" communication which we cannot refrain from noticing, wherein he says, " If we devote ourselves to legitimate channels of industry, and educate Victoria to a love of cocoanuts, we shall avoid interference with that perfect fiscal system designed by the 'practice hand of M'Culloch ,' but we shall do nothing of the kind Seeing what the love which "Sour Grapes" cherishes for the cocoanut has done for him, we should be unwilling to recommend our customers to do as he bids us, for fear that we should make fools of them all Still we should have no objection in the way of business to sell whole cargoes of cocoa nuts, although we could not recommend them, seeing what an injurious effect they have had upon ' Sour Grapes,' who would in all probability become one of our very best customers since he is so fond of that kind of fruit, but which is only fit for such " milk- sons as he evidently is As to the perfect fiscal policy of M'Culloch and Co. , which he thinks so much of, but of which we think so little, we are bound to admit that it was the 'prentice" hand, and no other, that introduced such a decidedly injurious policy, which is driving trade from our own shores to those of the other colonies, and which will ultimately ruin us if we do not retrace our steps, and do as they are doing, One word more about imported fruit If "SourGrapes"had only shown us the ghost of an argument in favour of protection, we should have said nothing, but he has failed to do so, solely because such a complicated and important subject isfarbeyondhis reach Then, again, if our own growers could produce a sufficient quantity to supply our wants the whole year round, instead of less than half of it, we should have been the very last to advocate the repeal of the import duty , but until they can do this, we contend that it is unfair and oppressive to tax the exporters for supplying us with what we cannot possibly do without, and it seems doubly hard upon them when we consider that for the last five months Victorian grown fruit has been shipped in large quantities to some of the other colonies duty free We could give " Sour Grapes " a dozen more nuts to crack but we think the above will suffice. We are so. HURlEy AND __?_-. 6 Western Market, April 23. [Can it be possible that our correspondents, Messrs. Hurrey and Sons, did not observe that the letter of "Sour Grapes was Â¡lonioal?-13B. A.]
