Two years passed over in utter misery and constant humiliation for me. Drinking, swearing, gambling, racing — fast in every way, George led the life he loved best, and soon got through what money lie bad from his father. Often after a few weeks spent in Auddandor Xhmedin he would come home brimging a troop -of men and fast women rod order me 'to be tnvil and entertain thenr well. liOfhingmy work I was forced to be coldly polite to -|«bple whom I despised and detested, ^jrought, its theywere, hy my uwn' fansband to-my flwnhome.

This spring a hope came to me that before long a sweet wee form would lie in my arms ; little arms would twine round my neck and soft wee lips be pressed to mine. Oh, holiest joy of motherhood ! how wonderful thou art ! What can compare with tiee! Thus the Catholic church makes the mother-heart of Mary the fount of aU love and pity, for she knew the joys and trials of a woman. Yet even this did not soften George, and his 'brutal. Well do I remember his cruel hands wrenching my hair, his blows, curses andeven kicks.

IknewraylilUcone'etkooght1 — his wants — even before he wasconscious of them himself, and- for hfen I made a stand, that alThls property sbotaM not be spent in riotous living. Let me pass by that ecenc. My boy was but a few months old when Bis- father in sulted me ami him vitii the Sastontrage, whioh a woman has to endure on earth ; but there his power exceeded its limit. I simply walked to my room, ana, taldngmy child in my arms, bade the nurse follow me ' to -the nrin cipal hotel in Akaroa since tho polluted house was no longer fit for my babe and me. A f ortnightlater George suoooeded in fore ing an interview on me, -irhenlie'denmnded'a Urge sum of money at raioe, threatening to kill me if I did not oonsent to £ive mmVhat would ruin my child. Fortunately, 'Dr. Claxke was within hearing, having called to ascertainif he could serve main any matter. Ho came when I called, and George imme diately and blankly consented to ' leave for Melbourne at onoc on the receipt of a cheque for 1.1,000, which I gave him. ' Good-bye, George,' I said, holding out my hand. ' Things might have been dif ferent if you. had so willed. I nave'becn a ?good and iaiQifnl wife, and 1 do not 'forget you are the father of my Iwy. Godgrantyon may grow tired of evil and oome home to ns atlaat Good-bye.' He turned and scowled, hut never a -word. Henoe* forward my life ran smoothly. I had a few frtends— my boots, my piano, my paint-box, And Jast and chief est joy of all I hadmy%lessedboy. His sweet voice'chccrcd me; fortnm I grew merry again; for him I sang and danced over the house and upmnd down the -garden paths.
