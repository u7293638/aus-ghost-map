SELECT POETRY. A GERMAN WAR SONG. J The Berlin correspondent of the Times tends the text of the new Bhine song, which, set to an inspiring tone, has fast become the " Marseil laise " of the present war. fie appends the fol lowing translation by Mr Or- Soiling, late of the Woolwich Academy: PIE Wacht AM Bheot.-(THE Shot WATCH.) A roar like thunder strikes the ear, Like clang of arms or breakers near, On for the Bhine, the Gentian Bhine! Who shields thee, my beloved Rhine ? Dear Fatherland, thou needs not fear, Thy Bhineland watch stands firmly here, A hundred thousand bparts beat high, The flash darts forth from ev'ry eye. For Teutons brave, inured by toil. Protect their county's holy soil, pear Fatherland, thou needs not fear, Thy Bhineland watch stands firmly here, The heart may break in agony, Yet Frenchman thou shalt never be. In water rich is Bhinej thy flood, German is, rich in heroes' blood. Pear Fatherland, thou needs not fear, Thy "R&ineland; watch stands firmly here. When heavenwards ascends the eye, Our heroes' ghosts look down from high'; We swear to guard our dear bequest And shield it with the Qerman breast, ' Pear Fatherland, thou needs not fear, Thy Bhineland watch stands firmly here, As long as German blood still glows The German sword strikes mighty blows, And German marksmen Jake their stand, No foe shall tread our native land, Pear Fatherland, thou needs not fear, Thy Bbindand watch stands firmly here. Wetake the pledge, The stream runs by; Our banners proud are wafting high. On for the Bhine, the German Bhiqs! We all die for our native Bhine. Jlence, Fatherland, be of good cheer, Thy Jthineland watch stands firmly here.
