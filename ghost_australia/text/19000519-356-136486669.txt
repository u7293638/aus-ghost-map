PEN-NOTES AND PENC]ILLINGS. THE FAMILY GHOST. MR. CHAMBERLAIN : WE SHALL MAKE THESE AMENDMIENTS IN THE IN TERESTS OF THE EMPIRE. . . 1F ANY AUTONOMOUS COLONY FINDS THE TIE WITH ENGLAND IRKSOME, WE SHALL BE READY TO GRANT IT COMPLETE INDEPENDENCE. THI-l FAMILY GHOST, which the other day threatened to walk to some purpose, as sisted by gentlemen like Mr. Grlffith, La bour member, and others, has now to walk in another sense. The statement by Mr. Chamberlain that England will grant any dissatisfled autonomous colony its Indepen dence whenever it wishes it bas taken all the staich out of its winding-sheet. If there is nothing to frighten, then the occu pation of the frightener is gone, and the ghost becomes merely the ghost of a ghost. Evidently Britannia is not "taking any;" her hair still hangs straight; her lips re main as wiry as ever; her hands are ex tended. so that everyone may see they don't tremble a bit. Clause 74 is going to be much more easily settled as a result of Mr. Cham berlain's declaration, which put into bru tally plain English amounts to this: We are going to have a voice in a constitution which is a contract to which we are an equal party, and if that voice is objected to then we shall decline to go on in the present pleasant relationship. In a word, we, as the party denied the right of con sidering something which we are asked to create, will declare our Independence.
