Certain it it that some what more than two yea's ago, Mr Crookes saw the ghost of a metal in a spectrum, and was thereby incited to search for the substance, and discovered it existing in minute quantities iu iron pyrites. The new inetnl figured as a few grains of black powder in the International Exhibition. At the beginning of the present year it was shown in very small iugo's anil in the form of wire ; since then Messrs Bell Brothers, of Ncwcastlc-on-Yvnc, have suceecdcd in producing it in comparatively large masses. One of their ingots, weighing tte rly 000# grains, nnd more than ten inches ic lengtii, wns exhibited at General Sabine's Couversazlone. The useful- applications oi tkaiiiuiu lime yet to be ascertained, bnt wc hear that oil eminent manufacturing fi.m has taken the question in hand. — Athenaeum.
