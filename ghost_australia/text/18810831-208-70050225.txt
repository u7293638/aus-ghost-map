THE NEW TEXT. -o Altered the Will, the grand, immortal Will God's marvellous Testament of lore to men And must I read the Holy Book again, In doubt what meaning its new phrases fll, And not alone my trembling heart to thrill, With its old benediction,, sweet as when I learned them, moved and awed, as though the pen Of Luke, and John, and Paul, were writing still? They tell me all is on the new-made pages yet Ineeribed by holy men of old, the same, Transmuted at the most in form or name But how can I the dear old words forget? The dearer far because they stand alone, With earth's profaner speech in contrast shown. II. No wiser men, and none of purer heart,. They tell me, can the sun's great eyo discern, More fain the Holy Ghost's intent to learn Than they, of Eant and West, who bare their part in purging the old text with patient art And aim, to make its inward glory burn, And from its chalice, as from sun's bright urn, New streams of ,acred light unclouded starn. Ah, forthe children this may come to pass, BIut , who at tht olden fount nurt, Shall stumble at the modern phrase, alas ! Spare me the hallowed ?ook as writ of old I . coenent to keep th" ungilied gold ! WILLIAM C. RItcK?DsS.
