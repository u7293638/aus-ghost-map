Hey, Diddle, Diddle. Hey, diddle, diddle I The cat and the fiddle, Are getting old.fashioned, I trow, More novel'twoold be for a great wallaby The organ to play with one toe. For the moon to give chase to the man on her face, And the comet to join in the fun. For the evergreen rabbit to weep at the habit Of squatters infesting its run. For the novelist pale to yield up his tale. To the sheep of Bo peep's .woeful verse,. For the ghost of the corner to sit on'Jack' Horner :,. - White Coroner Cats seek a hearse. For small d'gs to giggle when cows give a wriggle, That lans them away past the moon, Is really quitestale, as is also the tale Of the dish making off with that spoon. Now, not to make off with a spoon when there's moon, Is a far more astonishing thing. And to see the moon wriggle-oh, hey diddle, diddle, In that case you really might sing. -E.T.
