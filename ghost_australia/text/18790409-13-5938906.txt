WEDNESDAY. APRIL 9. 1879. From time to time we have called attention to the lessons to be dorivod from the land experience of New Zea- land. Eleven provinces thero have had eleven land systems in operation, and the community, therefore, has had an opportunity of testing theories by com- petitive results, with the outcome that the principles fashionable in Victoria, and to doubt which has been to provoko the Liberal anathema, have been un- equivocally condemned. The same sub ject is dealt with in an article in the current number of the Melbourne Re- view from the pen of Mr. WILLIAJI W. CARLILE, and we aro glad to find that the writer, who has a practical and personal knowledge of the New Zealand situation, is entirely in accord with our- selves, and corroborates to the letter the information and the views which wo have placed before the public. The article is attracting some attention. It has been favourably noticed and largely quoted from by papers which have long upheld, and are indeed partly responsible for, the suicidal land policy of this colony; and it is a matter of some .satisfaction to find the light beginning to break into these dark places. Our land system is shortly to be revised. We devoutly trust that when the time comes it will be found that the New Zealand lesson has been studied and appreciated. No oflenco can be taken this time as regards the quarter from whence the advice proceeds, for the principles which Sir GEOKGE GREY insists upon cannot be jyer se objection- able to democrats anywhere. Our readers are familiar with the tale of what free selection at a nominal price over the entire territory has done for SoutMand and for Nelson. The history of those provinces has been identical with the history of Victoria and New South Wales. Practically the whole land of the colony is thrown into the market ; the alienation is enormous, the price asked renders the land a bargain for pastoral purposes, and to pastoral purposes all but the compara- tively small quantity actually required for agriculture inevitably goes. The most ludicrous results are those shown in New South Wales, where we have Acres. Land alienated . 27,235,102 Land cultivated. 510,530 To obtain the cultivation of one acre our neighbours have sold fifty. The "large estates" of Victoria, the cause of so much heart-burning, are also the direct results of free selection, under which the pastoral occupant is unneces- sarily assailed, and under which he has ready means of defending himself, and will have to the end of the chapter. Free selection at a nominal price has everywhere in Australia and New Zealand stimulated alienation, and has discou- raged rather than assisted settlement, and therefore it is as futile to attack any one class of men for its break- down as it is to rail against a law of nature. The failure lies in the prin- ciple. Southland, Nelson, and Hawke's Bay can show corresponding pictures in New Zealand to those weare familiar with in Australia, but, on the other hand, Mr. CARLILE speaks of tracts of country in certain provinces "gladdened with " the cornfields, the hedgerows, the "kbrowsing cattle, and the cottage homes " of Old England." These results, he informs us, have been attained not by free selection at a nominal price, but by two very different principles, namely " first, the preparation of the land for " settlement before sale ; second, its sale " when sold for full value." Localities of course differ, and the first principle has a far greater value in New Zealand than it has here, because our country is mostly open and easily accessible, whereas in many parts of New Zealand the country is absolutely impenetrable. There can be no resort to bush tracks, and unless roads are made the land is inaccessible and worthless. The plan, however, of making improvements which add to the value of the property has been far too much overlooked here, and Mr. CARLILE may be thanked for bring- ing it under notice. But the second principle is the one which concerns our- selves, namely, the sale of the land for its full value. Mr. CABLILE is full of instances of the high rates obtained from willing purchasers. The Minister is about to throw 120,000 acres on the West Coast on the market, and he esti mates to receive a net sum of £750,000, or over £6 per acre, from the purchasers, and a sale of Crown lands at Wanganui, where £6 per acre was obtained, is men- tioned. Land reformers will find it well worth their -while to go through Mr. CAKLILE'S instances of success, and whoever undertakes the task will find, we think, that in all instances there was no large area available for settlement ; there was an actual demand for land for agricultural purposes, and the supply was kept down so as not to exceed the de- mand, and consequently the agriculturists were prepared to pay a price which put the speculator or the pastoral occupier 1 out of the market. Thus, in Otago free selection oí er the entire territory was abandoned Intending aettlers had to send m their applications to tho Waste Lands Board, and so soon as the Boird thought fit-when demands hid at all lccumulated-a block was fixed upon, the runholdcr received notice, that the area in question was open to the public, und asurvej wis made If there was no competition tho land was handed over to the first applicant at an upset price (now not less than £2 per acre), and if there w is competition for any lot it was put up to auction In this wiy " is population increased, and as capital " accumulated m the hinds of the " w orkmg classes, and as communie îtion " vt ith the interior was pushed on, one " great block of countrj after another ' was conv cited from a waste into a " fanning district, and many m i_mfi " cent blocks not yet so c jin ei tedie " main to undergo the process in the " future lins is the 8)stem which is forcing its way to the front in New /eil ind, md it has much to lecommend it Undu it the pastoral tenant remains undisturbed in his holding until his land is in the nntural course of events required bj the agncultunst He his m most instances 1 complete security of tenuie But if, on the one lund, ho cannot be expelled by T IM, DH W, or II vni y, the state his the comforting 1 nowledge that he cmnot puichase fiom lew, DICK, or H Altin, who hi\e neither the oppoitunitv of levjmg bhek mail on the squatter nor of dcfiauding the Crown Bj this process anj an tigonism between the selector and the pastoral tenant is reduced to a minimum, and each is allow ed and encoui tged to make the best use of the land m his possession The squattei in the back country cm effect impro\e ments with the knowledge thyt his works will not bo interfered with, by worthless men picking out the ejes of his country, and the selector realises that his future depends upon himself, and that ho has no chincL of transferring to the pastoral lord, he pocketing a bonus and disappearing as silently as the Arab If some such sj stem as tins had been adopted here, we should not havo been deprived of any permanent settlement in existence now, but we should h"ve had a good deal less alienation, the million of acres now under cultivation would have been near the seaboard, and the pxs toral occupants would have been locited in the inteiior, whereas this nituial ordei has been m\cited, with disastrous conse quences to all concerned We might not have received so much revenue from land sales in the past (though the land '.old would have fetched a better price), but w e should ha\ e more left for the future One section of the community, however, earned away byan impulse, prefened to legislate with a view to "driving the squattei across the " Murraj," and vindictivene^s has once more íecoiled upon itself It is a note worthy fact that, accoidmg to Mi CVIÏLILF, the Ota_o settlement was pro posed bj the piovincnl s mattes, md the sjstem which best suit-, them is also found best suited to the ¡ copie, and is now suppoi ted by the most advanced agrarian îefoimeio, including such men as Su Gi ou F G m v., Mr STOLT, and Mi Ma AisDitLW How fat the pim can be applied in its entirety to Victoi ia in our piesent circumstances maj be in open question, but though in detail we might have to diftei, we submit with confidence that here, as in Otago, the one guarantee the state can take that the land purchaser LS a bona fi If bust ness man is his readiness to pay a bon i fide business price As Mr MIRAMS told the members of the West Melbourne Reform League on Tuesday ev eiimg that " several public ' men had privately adopted his " theories, it would be interesting to know what his theories are We mean " interesting," of course, in the sense that in this country of surprises we never know from day to day who may rome to the top, and some fine morning we may wake up to find Air Mm vvis and lus disciples busily engaged in giving form and effect to their great disco \ enes In an economic or philosophical point of view, we need hardly say that "interesting" is not the word we should apply to the dabblings of the bon member for Collingwood on the subject of capital or currency Had he addressed the association alluded to on the subject of roll stuffing or abusing the public radways for electioneering purposes, we should have regarded Ins utterances as the opinions of an authority sub- mitted to experts, but when we find bim haranguing on a matter with which he has had no practical con nenon, and of which he evidently possesses no accurate knowledge, we cannot look upon his remarks as pos sessmg any very powerful claim to attention. However, it is impossible to let an address pass by without comment which is said to represent the views of so many budding statesmen. Out of consideration for the rising luminaries who are waiting to give m their "public " adhesion" to the financial gospel of Collingwood, we feel constramed to find out if possible what Mr MIRAMS IS dnvmg at In order that some idea may be formed of the difficulty of the task, wo may draw attention m pass mg to the marvellous process of reasoning whereby this remarkable man manages to rank us amongst his con verts Ho says that we have adopted his view because in a recent article we pointed out that " to everyone engaged " in commercial affairs the immediate " inflation of the currency by means of " borrowed funds is evidently the para " mount question of tho day " From this ho makes the following deductions -1 That in our opinion the country wants currency-not capital. 2 That we (not the mercantile classes) consider its obtainment the paramount question of the day 3 That the want alluded to might be supplied by the issue of a number of printed slips of paper With regard to the first point it is almost unnecessary to observe that currency in the shape of "hard money," as tho Americans call specie (and we never dreamt of any other being wanted), is capital, it being the representative of somebody's ac- cumulations, bearing a universally re cognised exchange value. As for the other two conclusions we need scarcely say that one is, strictly speaking, a misrepresentation, and the other an absurdity. Haying thus indicated that there are hindrances, both as regards reasoning and fact, to be encountered by every student of Mr M ILA Mi, let us seo if by any possibility we can ascertain what he wants. One thing only is clear as far as wo can seo-viz , that he w ishes the Government, or a state bank, which is the same thing, to issue notes to replico the present circulating media Directly wo attempt to get bejond this point our difiiculties begin Are the notes to be convertible or incon- vertible? If the former, where is a profit to come fiom sufiicient in amount to justify us in interfering with the exist mg state of affairs 1 If tho Government notes were to be made exchangeable for com or bullion on demand, there would be no objection to them on the scoio that thej might be created in excess of tho le£itini ite demand, for any attempt at o\er issue would be checked by prompt presentation for payment But then, an bono ? The reserves which tho Go \ernment 01 state bank would be ob- liged to keep to secure the convertibility of ils promises to pay at any moment would so i educe tho profit on the notes kept alloit is to make the game hardly worth the candle To muntam the value of a paper currency it is not sufh cieut that the holders of notes should be sure of ultimate payment They must be ible to procure hard cash whenever their wants or their whims require it, and this ready convertibility can onlv be secured by large reserves of gold. That Mr MIRAM, is not quite ceitain as to the merits of convertibility and lnconveitibihty is, we think, ap- paient from his address He sajs - " As to the objection that people would " not tal e the Government notes, the "reply was that, uithout passing any " stt i7ijail measwc on the si 'ject, ii the " Government said they would receive " the notes in payment of rate.-, and "taxes, theie was no doubt everyone "would receive them, for a man to " receive a note only required to know " that he could pass it on again If the " public weie willing to receive tho " notes of an j small banking lusti " tution, visit not absurd to suppose " that the) would refuse the notes " issued bj the Government with tho " credit of the state behind it ? ' This ma) mean an) thing A portion appears to hint at inconvertibility, while the allusion to existing banks seems to point in the opposite direction. If, however, we turn to another part of the address, we find remarks that are only applicable to an mconvortible papei curiency 'N c are told that there is a popular idea to the effect that whenever a state issues notes its operations in this direction are always carried to excess Is OH, such a proceeding is impossible with con .verüble papei, so we can onlj infer that Mr Mut\vs is alluding to its opposito Assuming fur the nonce that an incon vertible paper currency is wliat Mr Mir .M-> de.su es to see established, how, we would ask, does he propose to guard against abuso 1 He sa) s he desires to see onl) as much issued as tho countr) can absoib (this amount he fixes at about £6,000,000), but he does not tell us how he would ascertain the pioper limit in practice, or how he would pi event its being passed As his avowed object is to make money plentiful and elie q>, it is difficult to see where he should pause If he thinks he can bung down the value of moue) fiom 8 to 5 per cent by the issue of £6,000,000 notes, why not thrust out £12,000,000, and reduce it to 2½, or to £50,000,000, and so put applicants in a position to demand a bonus for borrowing Capitalists who have worked and saved might object to hav e th°ir stock in trade depreciated in this w ay, but then it is ev ident they are contemptible creatuies, incapable of appreciating the glories of a paper millen mum If the onl) safe rule w ere adopted, viz ,that of contracting the issues directly the paper currency sank below the value of a metallic equivalent, the supply of money w ould remam about the same as at present, and therefore we are not at liberty to assume that Mr MIRAMS pro poses to abide by it. What, then, are his plans for prev entmg abuse ? Towards the close of his remarks the accomplished financier of Collingwood let fall some words which suggest that, after all, it may not be a convertible or an inconvertible paper currency that he favours, but a tei dum quid-a sort of bastard mixture " Let the Govern " ment," he sijs, "buy the gold with " its currenc) at a fixed standard pi ice, as " the banks did, and sell the gold for its " notes at a small advance to pay for " the trouble " We do not pretend to see the full beauty of these Mirarme operations, but we certainly should find it difficult to imagine any more simple way whereby the Government might depreciate its own issues It would be sufficient, we imagine, if people were allowed to find out by the aid of their own unassisted genius that our local notes w ere not equal in value to univer sally recognised gold, without going to the trouble of thus proclaiming upon the house top3 that we ourselves hold them m less esteem We are not in a hurry to hear from Mr MIRAMS, but if he will take time for re flection, and then formulate his ideas on this state issue question succinctly, we shall bo happy to subject them to analysis, if only for the benefit of those " public men " w hose natural modesty has not permitted them to acknowledge their discipleslup as yet. In declining the request made by the four members of the Australian cricket team who hold appointments in the public service of New South Wales for the payment of full salary during their absence from the colony, Sir HENRY PARKES has earned perhaps some un popularity, but it can scarcely be denied that he has done right The ap plicants made their claim " in conside " ration of the present and future benefit " we are accredited with having done " to the colonies by the attention we " have drawn to them, both directly and " indirectly, in Great Britain, the United " States of America, and Canada " From the minute written by Sir HENRY PARKES we imagine that the position he takes up is this-that public servants should be rewarded by the Government according to their merits as employees of the state, and not for any benefits which they may have secured for the country in an accidental way. Besides, the ap- plication was of a partial character The team consisted of twelve members, who should share equally both praise and reward. As Sir HENRY PARKES puts it:-"Admitting the service as «'set forth, if any recognition of «'it in the shape of a pecuniary *' grant were considered expedient, *' it appears to the Government that "it should in fairness include the «' whole of the gentlemen who were «. associated together in rendering such " service." But the application came from only four of the team ; and if these we "favoured by receiving full pay for the period during which they were absent from duty, simply because they happened to be in the service of the Government of New South Wales, the transaction could scarcely be regarded as equitable. There was this further objec- tion to the proposal, that the salaries of the applicants were very unequal ranging from only £70 up to £320-so that the sums they would have received would have been quite disproportionate ; and if the recompense was to be made on account of the services rendered by the team in their capacity as cricketers, why should those who did not happen to be in the service be left out in the cold? The whole thing was a mistake from the beginning. If the gentlemen who constituted the Australian Eleven have placed these colonies under an obliga- tion, it should be discharged by grants of public money or by a public sub- scription. But does the obligation exist ? We confess that we cannot see that it does. If the team had set out on their enterprise with the object of benefiting the communities to which they be- longed, and with that end in view had surrendered their incomes, it might be urged on their behalf that compensation was due. The Eleven, however, went to England and America because they loved cricket, and wished to enjoy a pleasant holiday. They got all they desired, and even more. They had a most pleasant tour, they were feted wherever they went, and they also put money in their purse. They played good cricket, and no doubt did credit to Australia, but in a variety of ways they have had their reward. If the Australian colonies have been in- directly benefited in consequence of the interest excited at home by the visit of the cricketers, the re- sult is merely incidental, and fur- nishes no ground upon which to base a claim. We make these remarks in no ungenerous spirit, but in order to cor- rect the extravagant ideas which, seem to prevail in some quarters on the sub- ject. As to the Sydney gentlemen who have been unsuccessful in their appeal to the New South Wales Government, the error into which they fell was quite ex- cusable. So much adulation has been showered upon the team that if any of them have come to regard themselves as benefactors of their country it is only what might have been expected ; and, adopting this view, Mr. GREGORY and his colleagues doubtless felt that they were preferring no unreasonable de- mand. There is one aspect of this matter to which it gives us pleasure to refer. It is refreshing in these days of govern- ment by reform leagues and caucuses to read the energetic protest made by Sir HENRY PARKES against the interference by members of Parliament with the functions of the Executive. It appears that before the application in question was forwarded to the Premier, it was shown to a number of members of the Legislative Assembly, 33 of whom gave their signatures in support of the claim. The reply to this recommendation is a strong remonstrance from Sir HENRY PARKES on behalf of the Cabinet, as follows : " The Government, while disposed at all times to give the most respectful attention to the views of members of Parliament, cannot free themselves from the conviction that they ought not to allow the weight of these names to influence them in dealing with any par- ticular case of the civil servants apart from those considerations of merit and discipline which it is their duty to regard as paramonnt in dealing to the best of their knowledge and judgment with all cases alike. The authority and control of Ministers over the public service would he seriously weakened if ground were afforded for the belief that Parliamen- tary influence could direct a more favourable course of treatment than what in the absence of such influence would be pursued." The soundness of the principle here laid down cannot be disputed. If the pub- lic service is to be conducted efficiently and with fairness to those engaged in it, it must be kept free from parliamentary interference, which weakens legitimate authority, and destroys discipline. Having a due sense of their responsi- bilities, and feeling that they were in the right, Sir HENRY PARKES and his colleagues refused to be influenced by the weight of even 33 votes in the Assembly. In taking this stand they have shown a spirit of firmness and in- dependence for which they will be very generally commended. We havo been favoured with a copy of the correspondence in Messrs. WRIGHT, ORR, and Oo.'s case, together with trans- cripts of the minutes, conditions, instruc- tions, &c;, relating thereto. We have perused these very attentively, but wo do not seo that they throw any fresh light ?upon tho matter. Thoy show that wo were justified in assuming in our lost notice that " everything was correct up " to tho time tho order in council was " issued, and that this order referred to " ' docks ' and ' entrances,' " but thoy do nothing towards clearing up the mystery at- tending tho iasuo of a lease mentioning one dock and one entrance only. Wo havo a .copy of the instructions to the Crown Solicitor, enclosing tho special conditions approved by the Governor in Council and a form of lease ; a direction from Mr. SUTHERLAND, acting for the Crown Sr'J0^_or, to "see that all blanks aro caro " hilly filled up," an order to Mr. BUR- CHETT to " noto and propare," a minute -frovn Mr. BURCHETT forwarding the "draft," and an intimation from Mr. JOHNSON-who appears to havo been the intermediate officer between Mr. SUTHER- LAND and Mr. BURCHETT-to the effect that on tho 30th Septembor, 1870, the ' ' leasopassedtkroughrecordsforsignature " by His Excellency the GOVERNOR." All this seems perfectly in order as far as it goes, but we have no explanation as to ?why the instructions of the Crown Lands .department directing the insertion in tho lease of the special conditions approved by the Governor in Council were not ?complied with. It appears to us that cither Mr. BURCHETT or Mr. JOHNSON is responsible for the discrepancy, and one .or the other should explain how it oc .cun-ed. Mr. BURCHETT forwarded his draft to Mr. JOHNSON on the 7th Septem- ber, 1870. Where is that draft? If it wore produced it might show that Mr. BURCHETT is the culprit, or it might free him from blamo. In the latter case, it would be for Mr. JOHNSON to say why the " leaso passed through records for signature by His Excellency " the GOVERNOR " differed from Mr BuRCirETT's draft Tho thing now líos in a nutsholl, and it would bo a mintaka to stay tho elucidating process at this point Wo aro glad to have been tho moans of extracting information from the parties concornea, which tends to rehovo tho caso of tho suspicious appearances that at ono time appeared very dark in- deed Even now wo cannot understand why it was not given sooner, and that, now it is forthcoming, it is not com- plete Wo aro still awaiting an answor to our question-How did tho conditions approved of by the Governor in Council, which contemplated " docks " and " entráñeos," bring forth a lease íelating only to one of each ?

That the master of the Macedon, having when some ! distance away observed th» obstractior caused by the lighter, and seeing that th< Dawn, to avoid collision with it, had run inte the south bank, and that her stern waa cant ing towards the north bank, should, hav< used additional precautions by going asterr sooner than ho did, and thug reducing the rmk of collision to a minimum The board, therefore, ia of opinion that each Bteamei contributed to the collision.
