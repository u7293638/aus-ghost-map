IN TOWN AND COUNTRY. (By "Rus.") The unenviable pre-eminence of being .the drougbtiest town; in Australasia probably belongs to Birdsville, in Western Queensland. There the rainfall for. 1899 only registered 1.76in. . Mr. Wragge tried, in vain to divert some of his dis- turbances in the direction ,of .that unhappy spot. Neither'ATTpha nor; Beta', Steyn nor Jaubert, could be coaxed., to . thé relief. So, . the furthest-out township of "the dry and distant- Diamantina, and ; within a stone's: throw of the South Australian boraer, still lies and" wilts in -the . furnace-like heat of - the-surrounding desert, rejoicing--in the new name of- HadesviHe^ bestowed upon'it- by its remaining residents. \ .-,,5 t ? ^ : . .. . * *. * . # -.?--r ; There^lS Ä^sUri'rög-pictüre-from á country.con temporary of ,t|ie.battle, ¿of "JKoodoesrand.

Then the. división parted^the in fantry brigades rushing in front of ; the foe'-s posi tion; the cavalry of Porter and Broadwood round ing the flanks.

Country opinion as'to the sarety or otherwise of folk visiting Sydney seems to vary very, 'con siderably,'-and,, in1 some caines, very comically.- Af ter speaking.-of 'the- time of calm we'iiad^enjoyed for so many. ye,ars previously,- a rleader in a- coun try- paper " continues: ""The period of. rest was rudely rdlsturbed* by} therdogs ot, war-in South Af rlc&i; the.bellicose cable ; messages, -and- the-prepara-: tibn ' and -dispatch of -Australian ?contingents. Dove-tailing'- on~* this latter -excitement is the- ap . pearance of the beastly : bubonic; with tts creeping record of ---the- áuick-llmed<and the": quarantined." And we know not .how long the war and the plague will last, nor can we calculate on being spared startling-or saddening developments in con- nection with either. Now, that is all .right, so far as'it goes, and" '.'bellicose" is a^haply, ""delight-; ful.- :But, "later. on|v'the.%ométohat pessimistic -view bf the f-*beaetly j bubonic'' situation is suddenly and radically altered, and the writer bursts forth into av perfect, eulogy of the capital. Says he: "Now the city ähd the country are blessed by na- ture with the purest, of air, and only in the habita- tions of the filthy is there an absence, of pure air. There is, therefore, no possible hope of the plague getting a foothold in either city or country. It is said that many people who had made up their minds to visit the metropolis during the. Easter attractions fear to do so. They need not have the slightest misgivings, for Sydney is far and away the healthiest city in Australia on account of its park lands, ocean and harbor frontage, and perfect sewerage system. This, in spite of the extraordinary assertion in the first paragraph, is indeed .reassuring. Only subscribers who read, the leader and its sub. will perhaps have some little difficulty in deciding what view exactly to take, of matters in, the capital, and whether to re- gard it as a sanatorium or as a pest- house.

From such-places-as Marybor ough and Bundaberg the amounts collected may, considering the bad «season ^and other drawbacks, be. almost- termed astonishing. A Queensland contemporary,-referring-to -the subject, says: '"tJp to á few days ago Maryborough had collected over £775, while Bundaberg showed £557. - But... Charters Towers is-a "long way ahead" bf ' these,' with the very generous amount of £4900, .and. this is Mr. Dawson's electorate! At Gympie, another Labor constituency, the contributions looked very well at £1Í90.

Whilst we never seem to- have -heard- of the especial breed^pf bird, the conundrum appears to be worth somebbuy's while, to attempt solving.

Another point taken- by the ¡"Grazier" is that as, along with other news, any '* abnormal temperatures" are always-wired' to the Sydney, press; therefore, for..many ? months, . in correct information- has-been ; going .through, Sb-j", itained with-the full knowledge, of the. local .officials - from an. incorrect notice, board.

To-rday. (Thursday) he visited the locality out of curiosity, and saw that rat in the same position, though in a* more advanced state pf decomposition. If this can happen, how can we trust our local authorities to fight the threatened attack of plague?" This incident of .deliberately watching the translation andvadvancing decbinposition of that rat is typi cal and eminently characteristic of the average British citizen. Then, after having watched the danger for three dáy3", he sits down and writ.es an indignant and denunciatory letter to the news-, paper, Apparently, no such idea as disposing of. the "fat himself, or even of informing the authofi-v ties bf the menace to public safety lying at their^ doors', ever entered into the writer's head. And it is pretty safe to s.ay .that the majority o£ British citizens would do -exactly av he did. !7lv anyone doubt9 this, let him place a rat In ir»«» r&ost; public street Sydney, . and see how ir any scathing . lette«, viii be in the moirxvw's papers, whilst the untouched animal sïovly décompose».
