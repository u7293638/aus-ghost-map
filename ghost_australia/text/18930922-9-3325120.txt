MjttK IfflUeli rates Palmerston- : Friday, September 22nd. If by clearing the path to political privilege we can make woman happy, v Trtnrnraftls and mothers of New Zealand should be in a high state of exultation at the present moment over the passing of the Woman's Franchise Bill. We are told that the immediate effect of the bill becoming law was to create, a rush to the Returning Officers of women requiring to be included in the list of voters. We are not sure if the bill goes the length, of providing for steward cariaîd ates in time of, election,. ; but if not that extension, of the, Act is sure tomorrow in due course. The thin. end of/lhe^W^^^j^^jU^r^pdk-.Aiid if there's anything further to be ,gpt:we, may be sure "the ladies" will go for it. And how can they $>e'refused 1 New Zealand politics are surely progressive 'if 'they are. anything at: all; and the effect of the new departure will, be' watched, with, much curiosity. For ourselves we do not fancy that lovely woman's entry, into politics, whether she takes an active; or passive part, will, to use article metaphor, "set the Thames on fire." a good sensible woman is a treasure at home, there's no denying, am,) the majority.! of such will probably consent to remain at home, notwithstanding what tempts trains are held out to her to take a leading part stan election contest. If by any stroke of bad luck' women 'on' the whole acquired a yearning to. race round and a run " elections,' the other sex might soon fall into the disposition of the aborigine who makes his wife keep the family pot ii I led and do the laborious work whileAie reposes in the share and discourses sagely blythe why and wherefore of a new 'possums track; up an old gum tree.

There are good , adaptable women whom their sex join hearts in admiring without renivy^iiat they are just the disposition to shudder at the prominence which an election would thrust them into; while as to the remainder we are prepared to wager that ninety per cent, of them would sooner vote for a man any day than; for another woman. If we are right in this assumption we may "rest content that it will be a long day yet before women will have iiiuch'ettVct in Parliamentary elections except as voters.
