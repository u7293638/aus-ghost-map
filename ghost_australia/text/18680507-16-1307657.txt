that the rulo adopted by the Synods in the other colonies was to havo both a clerical and lay secretary and therefore it would bo well at tho beginning to follow thut rulo Tho amendment was then put

in September of last yeal, I said that tho first question which I de sired to Eiibinit for their consultation was whcthei, in the judgment of the Confeierce the tuno had armed when it would be dean able for us to entei upon some foi m of synodical action, with a view to the ordering and government of tho Ohurch ni this dioetso ind, if »o what form of Bjuodical action it would bo desirable to adopt, whethor it should bo bv legislativo onaetment or consensual oom pat , and tho Conference haling expressed a unanimous opinion that the tuno liad arrived for thi adoption of some form of synodical action, it was, aftor oiroful co isidcrution resol»ed that the Svnod to bo convened should bo founded on the basis of voluntary compact, and not on logislatne enactment, and a committee of the Conference was appointed to onquno into and report upon a Constitution for tho Church lu this diocese, which «night be lind beforo the Si nod, wlueh I was requested to convene m tho month of April

communion, held at Lamboth Palace, Soptomber 24 27th, 1867 - " In tho organisation of Synodal order, for tho government of tho Church, tho Diocosau Sjnod appears to bo tho primary and simplest form of such organisation " " By the Diocosau Synod the eo operation of all members of tho body is obtained in Chu-eh action and that acceptance of Church rulis is secured which m tho absence of other law

is, in tho judgment of your committee e scntial to ordu and good government that tho diooeso should bo organized by a Svuod loin com niittie eousidei that it is not at vnnanco with the aueient

periodical, and that the right of eonveiiing spoiial meetings whcnoier they mny be required should be lesen ed to tho Bishop " The committee adds -" J_be ofheo of the Diocesan Sjnod is geneially to make io gulatious not rcpugniiut to those of highci Synods for the ordor and good government of tho Chureh within tho dioeoso, and to promu) gat« tho decisions of tho Provincial Syuo 1 Amongst tho many subjects which will claim the attention of tho Swiod, I, m\ brethren may mention-The sustentation of the elergj and their appointment to their respeotne cures, the organiiation and subdivision of paiiihcs, tho consecration of churches and eometenes , tho compilation or seleetion of a hvmunl for general use in the diocese, tho education of the young, tho supply of the occasional offices of the chuieh such us marrilges and burials , church dues and fees the adoption of somo model ti ust deed, or the appointment of a Boird who, subject to tho control of the Geneial Synod, and to the torms of aiij specific trust may Btand poesrssod of lands or nioner s either granted bj the Crown or given bj mdmdunl nicmbors, for the use and benefit of tho church , the education of the childi eu of the clergy and some provision for those who through infirmity or ago aro no longer able to fulfil the active duties of the ministry It is probuble, mj brethren, with regnrd to some of theso miiiij question", that yon will find it desirable to appoint select eommitties to m i quiro into and report upon them to a futuro sos i Bion of tho Synod, but I would desire moro pir ticulurly to uigo upon your immediute atton tiou, as quostions of tho deepest and most pressing nu] ortuneo to tho progress of religion m tins dioecse, thoso whieh refer to the eon tiuilal inereuso in tho number of tho ckrgj, and tho most di si rabio eourso to bo adopted with a viow to their sustentation, because, whilst I i am poifectly awure that tho work beforo the | bynod is more than it can at all hopo to j grapple with satisfaetoiily in the course of a single Bcssion, yet wo must remember that a I lcrj largo number of souls each rear me pas i sing into eternity, nnd that, nit hough within tho last eight years the number of tue clergy in tho dioceso has been increased nearly Bixfold, yet there aio large districts of the nitcrioi which rarclj, if ever, ino visited'hy tho ministers of any lehgious denomination whatsoever I trust, therefore, that the obtaining the serneosofaddi tional clergymen foi the ministry of tho Church in this diocese tho suppoit of tho clorgi, and the mode of their appointment to fill existing enies winch from tuno to t mo may from cir cumstunces become vacant, and opea up new centres of missionary oxertion in the interior dish lets of tho colon), may bo amongst the subjects which will occupy the earliest alt"nlion of tho Synod It will bo for you, mj brethren, carefully to consider whether, in youl judg mont, it is most desirable that the contributions of the members of tho Chureh for the support of tho clergy should bo cast into ono common fund, or that each clergyman should as at present, bo maintained by the contributions of tho members of tho Chureh residint in tho district in which ho ministers I boliovo, my biethren, thnt in an} colonial dioceso where it is practicable, a system of partial endowments for the Bupport of tho clergy in the dillcreut districts, to bo supplemented by tho voluntary contributions of tho mombers of tho congrega tion to whom thoy mini ter will oicntually be found to be the most dcsirablo and satisfactory expedient To bo entirely supported by volun tary contributions in my judgment places the clergyman in a position of unhealthy depend enco upon tho will of the congregation , whilst, on the other hnnd, it appears to me that the system of entire endowment ia exposed to the danger of rendering the clergy too independent of tho affectionate respeet nnd good will of thoso who are committed to their pastoral supervision, and it will bo my desiro to bring undci the control of the Synod certain portions of land, some of which aro the gift of indiudual mombers of the Church, and others lave beon purchased by mo with funds kindly placed at mj disposal I y English friends Theso lands wo can scarcely expect will for some little time be productivo of any return, and occasionally they are sources of expense when you aro called upon by the owner of an adjoining property for your share of the dividing fence , but with the increase of population and prosperity in the colony, they may, I trust be found hore after a valuable assistance in providing a glebe and partial endowment for the clergy in some districts of the dioceso And here whilst I am speaking of the support of the clergy, it will bo a seasonable opportunity for mo to mention to the Synod the assistance which has been afforded to mj diocese by the Incorporated Society for the Piopagation of the Gospel in the Colonies, Plantations, and Factories of the British h m pire In the year 1865 the clergyman ofliei ating at Maryborough with the Wide Baj dis trict, and Taroom with the Upper Dawson, each received £100 from the venerable society, in part payment of their stipends, and that year, being in England, I obtained from the socie*j, partly in consequence of the depressed condition of the colonj, an increased additional grant of £500 per nanum (in all £700) for three years Ihat augmentation of the society's grant has enabled me to assist in proudmg tho stipends of clergymen for the new districts of Roma and Port Mackay, and has been a valuable aid in preventing, by a temporary assistance, the sad necessity for the withdrawol of the ministering clergy from some of the districts where the commercial depression of the colony rendel ed it almost impossible for the scattered congregotions to supply tho neces sary stipend that grant will expire at the close of the present year, but I huve osked the venerable society for a renewal of tho grant, or of a portion of it and in doing so I have suggested that in future the grant assigned bv tho society to my diocese should be ad ministered by the Hishop, in conjunction with the Standing Committee of tbo Synod To gether with the maintenance of tho clergy, I trust that you, my brothren, will give your care ful attention to a scarcely less important ques tion-that of their appointment to their re spcotivo cures As I said m my opening ud dross to the Conference, it is, in my judgment, very desirable that tho dilleront congregations should havo a voico in the appointment of their clergj, but it isa subject which willrequiro very caieful consideration, and it tliouhl bo well understood thut a eleigjman, when once piesonted to the Bishop, and np pointed by him to a euro his n moral, if not a lelilí, light to ti o ngular quarterly paynunt of the stipend which was ns sured to linn when he was piesentod to tho Bishop for appointmont, and that he eanuot when once appointed, bo íomovodíiom his cuio except upon just cause shown eithoi to the Bishop and to some tiibunul appointed by the Synod and approved bv tho Bishop It will bo tor the S«nod to considei whethei, with a mow to from tuno to time obtaining tho soi vices of clergj men from England, it is dcBiiublo that tho Bishop she ild altogether thiost lnmsolf of tho ie->poii*tbilit« cf tho appoiiiinont of tho clorgy, or whether, by some doliuod Bistora-such, for instance, ns nltorniito presentation to the chile i eut cures of tho diocese, ho should sharo tho re sponsibiht« with tho

lees of the Rov Mr Crojko who is at present assisting Mr Moscly in tho caro of the Ipswich district, und who, if he happily finds that his present desiro to rotuin to ministerial duty is not inconsistent with his hoalth, will, I hope, before long bo able to allow mo to em oil lum amongst tho legulai clergy of my diocese, and so summon lum to take his placo in oin Sjnod , and although Hib Honor is pi eseiit us a mom her of oin bynod, I cannot from nny motives of fulso delicacy Bin ink from noknow lodging tho very «nluublo services of Mr Justice Lutwyche, who, as a layman, has, in the absonco of tho Rev Mr Matthews, lcgulaily conducted tho sen ices in tho Church at Kedron Brook Neither would I forget the kind services of Cap- tain Macarthy and Mr. Drew at Toowong; and of Mr Nicholson at Grovely. I shall hope on some future occasion to bring before the Synod for their approval a few simple rules, with a view to the regular employment of lay agency in my diocese; and here, my reverend brethren, and my brethren of the laity, I cannot refrain from saying that not only in conducting Divine Service in the absence of the clergyman, but in parochial visitation, and in works of charity and mercy, the kind co-operation of lay communi- cant members, and of ladies who are willing to devote some portion of their time to so Christian a work, might, I think, often with great ad- vantage be sought by the clergy. A careful house to house visitation is one of the most important parts of a clergyman's duty. It is a trite but true saying, that a house-going pastor makes a Church- going people. To my mind a well-organised parish almost implies some regular system of lay visitation under the direction of the clergy- man, by which the attention of the pastor may without delay at all times be directed to cases requiring his spiritual ministrations. The school, my brethren, has been regarded as the handmaid of the Church , and in a well-ordered parish, next in importance to the ministrations of the ordained pastor, we may regard the effi- ciency of the teachers of the day and Sunday schools. Some of our daily schools, as at For- titude Valley, South Brisbane,and Toowoomba, are, I am glad to say, assisted by the Board of General Education, but in these it is found necessary, by a practical experience, that there should be an adjustment of the relative position occupied by the inspector appointed by the board and the clergyman of the parish, subject to tho supervision of the Bishop. To others of our schools, as at St John's Spring Hill, and Ipswich, aid has been refused, but it is only fair that I should say that since my return from England our applications for assistance to thoso schools has not been renewed. I have been rather awaiting the meeting of the Synod, and I hope to look to its standing committee, or to a com- mitt specially appointed by the Synod for the purpose, for valuable co-operation. I need scarcely do more than repeat what I have already often said, that it is my earnest desire that there seculur instruction afforded in our schools should be thoroughly efficient; but that, together with efficient secular teaching, we should be allowed to impart a sound religious education to the children of our communion. When the Synod shall have been enabled to make some better provision for the regular payment of the sti- pends of the clergy, and for affording assistance to the more newly settled and widely scattered populations occupying the interior, who are themselves able to do but little towards pro- viding the ministrations of religion, the endow- meun of the See will claim a share of its atten- tion. At present it consists of the capital sum of £6000 provided by the Colonial Bishopric's Council with the assistance of societies in England to which has bcon recently udded £1000 from the contributions of Lnghsh fnonds This capital 6uin of £7000 is, with the sanction of the Colonial Bishopric's Council, invested in first mortgages in the namo of the Bishop and his successors, and lest any lo«s might uccrue to the See, my porsonul estate is liable for the capital amount lhere is also in the hands of trustees a sum of £2200, arising from the subscriptions of friends in the colony, and from tho interest on original subscriptions, «vhich, for a period of six years, has been permitted to accumulate This sura is also invested in mortgages, but from circum Btauces into which I will not now stop to enter, eomo loss will, I fear, accrue to the See When tho S«nod l8 m a position to make on arrange ment for the permanent support of the Bishop, I shall bo glad, with the concurrence of the Colonial Bishopric's Council, to arrange that as opportunity oilers the moneys at present in vt eted m mortgages should be laid out in the pinchase of Government securities, or bo m vested m such way as may bo thought most expedient for the benefit of tho See, and bo brought under the control of tho Sjnod I hopo shoitly to bo able to say that by the kind noss of English fiiends a convenient Seo house has beon pioridcd for the perin ment resideuco of tho Bishop lhoic is at present in my hands i capital sum of £3000, placed at mv disposal bj Lnglish filends together with £600 ««Inch is at prosent lent to two congregations of the clio ceso, us assistanco towards the bull ling of pur sonago houses lho interest of tho C3000 is devoted to the suppoit of thoso Church ot ling land schools to which aid lins hil lied o been io fused by tho Boird of General 1 duealion But I tiust that tho tune is nnfiir di laut when without on) s milico of principle, our schools ma« bo assisted by the boin c1 lins cipitil sum of £3000 will then bo sot flee, und of it 1 pur poso to apply C1000 towuidsitii on lo \ mont of ubishopne forthe neu thorn poldon of tho colonj, £1000 for the benolit of orph m children of meiubeis of tho Chin eli of 1 uglind, C500 towtuds tho purposes of oducation and C500 townids tho endowment of tho archdeiiconiy lho othoi £G00, as it is repaid, «vii! be added ns an augmentation to tho endow uiout of tho Seo of Bi isbano In tho appropriation of tho m ono« s entrusted to mj caio, I trust that I Im«o enden vorod to meet tho wishes of mj Lnglish fi lends, and to consult the best mtorosts of in« diocese lo enable oin blanch of the Catholic Chinch of Christ to longthon hei cords and strengthen hei stakes, that she mnj , in dependence on tho Divmo blessing, fulfil tho pul poses of her mis sion, the Synod ««ill, I trust denso somo moans for the establishment of a church e\ten sion fund, by means of which piovision may bo mado foi tho outfit and p usu^o of eloigjmon, and candid iles foi liol) oiclois coining fioni Lugland, mid for the temnorarj suppoit of olergymon ni tho pooler nuil moi o widely scat tcred portions of the intoiioi Thoie aro, I am smo, mun« members of out Church who aro nt present residing «vhcio, uiihippily, thoy nie not called upon to pro«ido foi the miuistiutious of religion, who would gludlj oontubuto to such a fund And thoso who aro pormitted to enjoj the leguhn sujiply of tho ministrations of our holy religion will study rogurd it as a duty and a privilege, to romeuibor, ni tho enjoj mont of their own spiulual blessings the wants of those lo «vhoin nt present tho opportunities which aro iillúrded to tliem uro, ni the insumable oider nigs of Divine wisdom, denied lind time pel nutted there aro jot othei subjects upon which I should haio beon glad to havo addressed jon but I must not trispass too long upon jour fuibcurauco Tt is ni) earnest piajn that tho same mutual forbcuianco and brotherlv good will ««hieb pervaded the dchbei Dions of our Conference mi) bo««ith us ni) biet In on, now by God's ineii) for tho first timo ass mblod in oin Synod Guided by the spirit of love und faith, muí piuco, may our delibeiiitions tend to render our beloved Church moto and moro olh Clent in cunying out the great woik for which abo was appointed bv our Lord-nanni«, the perfecting of tho saints, tho «vork of tho ministry tho edifying of tho bod) of Chi ist On the motion of Mr Justico Ldtw\ohi , seconded bj tho Hoi J Matthuvs, thoaddiess wus ordered fo bo printed STANDIVO 01IDIR3 On tho motion of tho Rev J Bliss, seconded b) the Rev 1 G Moiiehm, tho following gentlemen weic elected to frntno standing oideis for the Synod, namoi«-Tho Venerable Arch deacon Glennie Roi j R Moffitt Mr Justice lut wyebo, J Douglas, L A Bonni) s, and tho movor.
