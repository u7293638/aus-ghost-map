LITERATURE. EVENING. M.I.C. Gray are the shades on the mountain sides, The river beneath them calm and blue; From a rift in the ranges the sun peeps through, Gilding the sails as our fleet boat glides. Thore are miles and miles of the brown sand beaob, Kissed by the ripples all stiver-sheened, GjolLng the land sinoe tho hot sou beamed, And sotting In ailvor the river reaoh. Full thousands of blfd√ü in the green shrubs fly, Seeking for prey in tho fallen leaves; The braiichca, tossed by tho ovening breeze, fPltng up their arms to the clouded sky. Tho smokes from the oamp fires twist and twirl, Rising like ghosts in their trailing shrouds; They loao themselves in tho changing clouds That far in the heavens above us whirl. Themantle of night is drawing around, Btuddod with stars and a sllvei'moon; Grim eilenoa will gather around us soon, As all tn the thraldom of night is bound.
