"Our burdens become lighter when we have a friend besido us. And 1 am your friend, and you have bought from my gratitude all a woman can be stow." It was plain speaking and' spoken in all sincerity. Barton felt the truth of the woman, and he was moved to his inmost soul. " Good Heavens !" he said, " if I only dare with such a. past to bang like a mill-stone " round my neck." Then with with a sort of fury in his voice : " Yon do not know what yon say. Listen. I don't know myself. My past is but a hideous dream, with every hellish phantom dancing in mockery through my mind. I am the sport of a fiend. One moment I seem to grasp some recollection and cling to it like a drowning sailor to a slippery rock, and again a new idea springs tip equally vivid and equally tangible, and the two cannot he trne. "What is it all, yon will say. I don't know, can't know — and no one hut one man can lielpmc and lie wont. Heavens ! if I were to tell yon the experience of the past few months — but no, I will not. God preserve your memory, Miss Marsden. With it goes life." They walked on in silence, both bent on their own thoughts. " You will not let me help you," she said at last. "Ah, it's not fair," (with a little ghost of a smile.) " I would if I dare," recovering himself ; "hut the secret of my unhappy fancy must be bonic by myself to the grave. That will come to finish all or explain all." He dare say no more, and he turned away without another word. Tlio lady walked on pondering all these strange tilings in her heart. What forms of self-sacrifice presented themselves before her mind we cannot tell, hut we can imagine the wide bounds of a true woman's self -martyrdom. CHAPTER XXI. Melbourne's madness. Melbourne was mad — stark, raving, ' 'Kcw' ' mad. The mania for speculating in real estate had seized on the whole population like an epidemic disease. The people had been long prosperous and the capital of the country had marvellously increased, but had not increased in any such proportion as the sanguine wishes of the Victorians had supposed. Legislation had brought people from all parts to the great city. These people had to find dwell ing -places, and buildings were run up in every direction to accommodate them. Of courso this naturally caused a tremendous advance in the price of city and suburban property, and when large prices wore paid for a few allotments, men of the Wallace type could easily create a "boom "by pur chasing at a price ten times over the highest value. Owners of property thought that they had become millionaires without the least trouble on their part, and others rushed madly into speculation with the hope of sharing in unexpected development. Many of the banks were bitten by the tarantula and actually forced the money on their customers or even on strangers. Building societies hardly know what to do with the money which flowed into them from all sides, and no one but a fool would stand iiside and allow all this wealth to glide past him without making a clutch to seize some of it. What a rattling, roaring time it was ! Everyone was to be rich; everyone was to have his own house and his own vine and fig-tree, and Victoria was to become the garden of Eden — barring the innocence— of the nineteenth century. Wallace was at the head of everything, and indeed — hardly understanding what was to 6uch a largo extent the work of his own hand or head — was inclined to believe in the reality of it all. At one time he did believe in a half-hearted way and went on rejoicing. Then he recollected the very small basis on which it all rested, and determined to make his hay while the sun was shining. Again he was drawn in. Rome syndicate or other had to be formed, and what chance was there of doing any good unless "Sir William" was known to have a " hand in it." He bought and he sold, hut it was all 011 paper. Men bought for paper and incurred liabilities that they could never meet if they lived to the age of Methuselah, and then sold for paper to men as reckless and foolish as themselves. Whatever coin was going was supplied by banks which suddenly sprung up into mushroom existence with the times. Wallace's companies tooki new lease of life, and he added to their number until thev were beyond even his comprehensive glance. His Style of living became even more ostentatious than ever. His Toorak mansion was enlarged so that it rivalled the palace of a sovereign. His wife, Lady Wallace, was the leader of society. Nothing could be done in town or country without her at the head of C, and certainly she filled the position of "Lady Bountiful " to admiration. She was a good woman, and good women are too rare. Wallace and Lumsden were again closetted together in the office of the former just when the madness was at its height. They were both perfectly well aw.u-.: that the climax had been reached, and that if they were to he safe they must realise gradually. But that was easier said than done. Paper has to mature no matter how good it may he. The conference had been long and anxious. The two men looked, haggard and weary. They had summoned a spirit from the vasty deep, and had forgotten the Abracadabra which could control him. There were many things to be carefully considered — many con tingencies to he anticipated. They had suc ceeded in quadruplying their assets, but they had been forced into incurring liabilities much greater, and some of these had to be . met substantially in cash, or the fabric they had taken such trouble in building would eome tumbling about their ears like a house of cards. " I don't see what we can do," said Lums den, throwing himself back into his chair. " That confounded bill of Hampton's must be met by hook or crook, and the Victoria will require 6olid mahogany." " That doesn't matter in itself," said Wal lace, " if we could only sec- beyond. There is upwards of £100,000 in value in that safe that could be turned into sovereigns or as' good as sovereigns in half an hour." "The deuco there is!" said his friend. "What in the name of common -sense have you been humbugg'ng about, then, with enough in hand to float us for a genera- ' Tiro very small considerations. P'r-t, I have only a claim on somo twelve or fifteen thousand of it, and second, although tho rest is not my own and may be called for any moment, I have made use of it already for an' advance when the ' Mcrcatorial ' re quired one." " On my honor, it will have to go for the same purpose again, so far as I can see," said Lumsden. "It hasn't been long back," replied Wal lace; "but I suppose that doesn't matter. Oil the smaller sum I have something of a claim. It is the savings of a couple of miners who gave it to mo for investment, and I thought I couldn't do better than invest it in- our " Financial.' They- have been well enough contented with their dividends up to the present at any rate.". Both the men laughed heartily at tho thought of the high dividends, and then Lumsden said : - " You haven't told mo where the rest came from." " Well, there is a bit of a mystery about that I can't get at the bottom of. It was left here by the Indian — prince ho said ho was — for safe keeping. You met him I think in Toorak one evening. Ho lias drawn upon mo twice or three times, hut only for com paratively small sums, from Duncdin and Laiuiccston, but that is all I have to ledger against him since I10 brought the stuff ono evening with something like secrecy. He told mo ho would give mo fair notice before he withdrew it. I don't know why he said so, hut at any rate I trusted to receiving notice and have mado good use of the treasure — indeed, if things six months ago hadn't taken a decent turn I half fancy I should have mado a permanent loan of it, but there was 110 necessity, and I don't think there is any now. We can always have time to turn about after recoiling liis notico." " It will have to go to the vaults of tho 'Commercial' to-morrow, I think," said Lumsden. "Things aren't over bright in the south, I can tell you. Tho Saving's Bank deposits hardly keep us afloat, and Carney has been 'booming' it up too loud. We were both dipped in a couple of speculations pretty heavily, and ready money is over scarce with us." "Hang Carney and you both!" cried Wallace in a rage. " You'll spoil the wholo thing by your folly. Tho bottom I tell you every day is knocked clean outof the ' boom,' and will soon bo ' devi! take the hindmost,' and tho hindmost I tell you again will .cpmo an eternal smash. If we can spin through for a few months we 6hall come out with fly ing colors and full bags, but if yon and Carney play tlic deuco now we'll be blown sky- high. Can't you have a little hit of common-sense?" " Oh, a very few thousands will keep us Equare all round, so long as the people bring in their savings and the borrowers pay up their dues. I can always shut up the direc tors, and the auditors darn't quick. Very, little of tho ready money will be enough, and you can let us have it now." "Well, you know how I .stand with all these companies. We have bled the 'Mer- catorial ' almost dry of cash. I have been disappointed, I tell you at once, in many of my expectations, but I am sure with time wo coidd pull straight, but we'll want time and nothing else will do. Time will steady matters, and tho margin of profit wo count on will bring us in straight. There is enough and more than enough to do it, but we may turn out tbo ' donkey between two stools.' Ono thing is certain, you must have no more speculation. You have had quite enough of it, and it is as well for you to keep in mind that any further speculations you indulge in will be at your own risk, and your chance of making anything from them is of tho smallest. The bottom is out of the 'boom,' I tell you." — " I'll take your word for it. The road out of the present state of affairs- must run through your safe. There is nothing else for it, because to realise now would be madness, and these bills must be met or there will be ruin all round." " You are right enough there, and I doubt I see some trouble ahead with the 'Mer- catorial.' Once ever there is a breath of suspicion the crash will come and nothing on earth will stop it. If we can keep straight, as I said before, we can manage in a couple of months and make splendid profits as well. Time is all we want, and we must have that at any price. Now, this is what I shall do. This Halim Haki left, the money with 1110 on the solo condition that lie would have it when it was demanded. He made the law- papers devilishly secure for himself, I pro mise you. I hardly thought he would have had the nousc to do bo but he did. lie did not, however, bind my bands as regards using it, and tbo whole consequently will go to tho vaults of the bank as security for an advance to meet those bills, but oil the condition that it is kept intact until redeemed. Darn tbo money ! — I don't know that it has benefitted me mucli. I always looked back to it when I speculated, and the temporary possession made me cut my fingers to the bone unless it turns up trumps now — at any rate there is enough to pull us through for the present, and if we get our pegs in all straight there will be easy going in the future." " Don't be suro of that, old man. The whole city has been bitten, and if one of these institutions goes down the whole bag of tricks will be scattered in eternal smash. Egad, I shake in my shoes myself. Between Carney and myself there is hardly a penny-piece 111 our concern. Tho safe is full of bogus securities, and any minute we, may have a blow up. I have a few thousands .laid by if the worst comes to the worst, but not enough to make things"domestic hum as I always like them. ' Phiz ' is a rare old stuff, but dreadfully expensive." "Well, of course, I can't be sure of it. but we both have the reputation of millions and we can live on that for a short tune even if times are bad. What we want, as I said before, is to feud off pressing creditors. Our bills are maturing with frightful rapidity and must be met or everything is blown. Now, this Indian money will give us a show I shall have it in tho ' Commercial ' in a day or so and you can draw on me. How much will do you? You will have to make it as little as you can possibly do with, because it is risky — mighty risky, I tell you." "I must have £10,000 at the very least. You had better run over and see bow we stand and then you can judge." "That s useless. I know well enough how you stand generally." " What do you think will be the result of it all ?" " What do I think ? Why, man, I know it will next door to ruin Victoria lock, stock and barrel. That don't matter, however, if we can pull through ourselves. On my con science, Lumsden." " Of course you mean as much as there is of it." " To be sure I do — to be sure I do. I was going to say something else. But I shall say that on my conscience or the partial coil- science I wouldn't like to be in your shoes if there is an eternal smash. The old women of the south will wipe you out with their dishe'outs." Lumsden shuffled a hit uneasily on his chair at the omen. "All right, man," said he; "bnt let me tell you while the old women arc at work with me the men will be lynching you, and Egad, I don't know what I should prefer if I had a say in the matter." "Pooh! Pooh! man, we arc in Victoria and firing in the Victorian age of the nine teenth century." "Faith," said Lumsden, rising, "only for that safe over there and what'.- in it I should relish a change of quarters and wouldn't hotlicr about tho ago. You shouldn't jest in such serious subjects, Wallace. An infernal old woman did bring mo to hook tho other day, and I had to shell out. Gad ! she gave mo a fine taste, and now your mentioning tho beldames brought' her to mind. Good-bye, old man, I'll see you to-morrow early." " Be here as early as possible after ten. Haki's money mnst go, and we must make tho most of the time wo have. Be sure and come to our hop to-night. We must show a a hold fac-o 110 matter how things tun. Good bye ! for tho present." The two men separated and Lumsden went his way. Wallace remained the last man in tho office, and did hot leave until long after his accustomed hour. Tho gambler waa calculating the chances of tho dice. CHAPTER XXII. THE ball AT TOORAK. "Chisel hurst," tho Toorak mansion of Sir William Wallace, was the scene of much fuss and gay disturbance on the evening of the eventful ball, - The road was thronged with carriages draivn up in lino waiting with what patience they could their turn to drive up and leave their fair occupants at the bril liantly lighted, door, of this hospitable man sion. Tlio gates, grounds and house blazed with electric light, fonntains flashed and gleamed with rainbow lines, skilfully thrown upon tliem by carefully designed lights ; while inside the hall the most wonderful arrangement of ferns and flowers converted the stately house into a fairy palace. At tho top of the first reception-room stood Lady Marion and Sir William Wallace, smiling and chatting, beaming with welcome as they received tlieir many guests and addressed to them tho few society phrases and nppropriato chit-chat which was all that could bo inter changed in so great, a crowd. Edith had grown weary of it some half hour previously and withdrew to an iimer 'drawing-room, "where the warm light fell from rose-colored globes and the scented air, the waving palms and ferns, the sweet heavy "scent of rare and beautiful flowers all helped to lull the senses to a dreaming delight which tho slow music of tho distant ball room only deepened instead of rousing. Edith found herself for a few moments alone, and, drawing near to one of tho largo bay- windows half shaded by the soft, velvety curtains, she drew tho blind and gazed out at tho soft moonlit heavens. " Ah, heaven," she murmured, " liow lovely, how peaceful the night ! and here how happy the faces around me. Ah, me ! shall I over know happiness or peace again. Why can I not still this eager longing for one step, this mad, insane desire to hoar the sound of ono voice, to feel tlio touch of ono strong hand grasping .mine with kindness. Yes ! that is just it, with kindness it is and nothing else — yet I thought the last week or so ho looked with more gentleness ; he spoke with something of tenderness, of regret when ho said that he should have soon to toko a journey with the prince. Ah, that prince, what a dark, mysterious being ho is — ono glance of his piercing eyes is enough to send a shiver right through to my very soul. Is ho George Barton's evil genius, as ho somo- timcs seems to intimate ? What is the con nection between them ? I fear — I fear it is him I have to thank for the state of George's mind towards me. A glance from him and George seems to retreat within himself some where miles and miles from me — and yet is not love the greatest power in the world ! I feci as if, my love for George would bo strong enough to surround him like a child — to slay any other power that would approach to liarm hira,. Ah me, what a wild, foolish girl I am — and ho cares nothing — nothing — " She clasped her hands suddenly, and wrung them in her torture of mind as the strength and hopelessness of her love forced itself on her attention. "A deep sigh near her mado her turn sharply round to discover the object of her thoughts standing a little behind gazing out at the night with a dreaming, far away air as if ho was only half alive. "Mr. Barton, I thought you were danc ing!" cried Edith, scarcely knowing in her confusion what she said. " Dancing, dancing — what have I to do with dancing ; that belonged to — to what— something or somewhere that I can't lay hold of in my mind do what I will — somo time or place in my fife, and yet was it my life ?" "Mr. Barton, you talk-strangely at times, and..ypt when action is necessary you are quick enough, as I am never tired of remem bering," she added in a soft and winning tone. It seemed to touch Barton into lifo for a moment. Advancing a step ho took her hand in a warm clasp. "Nay, Miss Marsden, you think too much of so simple a thing ; but I cannot say much about it since it has brought mo the friend ship and sympathy of so siveet a woman as yourself, and I am so rough and plain a man that I cannot express to you all I wish to say." " Yes, my friendship is yours, if that is of any use to you — friends in this world are not so plentiful I find, arid in society it is a word of a hollow sound ; yet friendship, pure and single- hearted, and kind thought never yet harmed anyone, and my fife is so lonely a one, in spite of appearances, and will bo al ways so, that my friends are few and far be tween. A faction of friendship, therefore, is not likely to be broken on my part — hands 011't?" she added, with a short laugh which verged very nigh to tears. Once more their hands met in a long clasp. "Thanks, Miss Marsden — Edith may I say for once. This is, indeed, a thing to prize — a true, warm-hearted little friend; but I forget I came to ask, at your sistor's desire, if you will honor me with this , waltz. I feel as if I danced, and yet I am not cer tain !" lie cried, in an irritated kind of way, "but vou are so gentle that if I don't shape well you will pardon me, I know," and Irawing the hand he still hold through his ann, he inarched off to the ball-room in the half-absent manner wliich seemed one of his chief characteristics. The softest and dreamiest of waltzes winded through the ball-room, and Edith icon found herself floating round in Georgo Barton's arms in the rythmic motion so dear to all true lovers of tho ball-room. Her step md George's harmonized well together. The lancers thinned off couple after couple, but Edith and her companion kept on. Many an admiring glaneo followed them ; she was so graceful and Barton so tall, and their danc ing expressed the very poetry of motion. But as Kingsley says, " Good times and bad times and nil times soon come to an end," md so at last did the waltz. With the look of dreaming happiness still on her faco, she let Barton lead her to one of tho dimly lighted conservatories in silence and stand fanning her for a few moments ere he broke the silence. "Thank you, my little friend; it seems that I did dance once somewhere, though 'pon my honor I can't say where. But you possess a great amount of electric force, I fancy, for I always feel a certain defiance of fate or something when I am near you. A strange fact. I cannot explain even to my self what I moan. A strange man I know myself to be — a queer- friend for you, little one, undone you'll tire of before long if I mistake not." " Never Geor:e — Mr. Barton I mean — I shall not change as long as there is life in me at all ; but I wish, oh, I wish I could help you to rM '.ember what you wish, hut I feel strangely depressed to-night, and I thought I heard more than one anxious tone in the groups of talking people that we passed going to tho ball- room." What is in the air— do you feel it?"— (To be continued.) W. H. 13 ,
