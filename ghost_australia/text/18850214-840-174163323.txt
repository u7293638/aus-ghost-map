A correspondent of the English Mechanic Bays, in reference to.a question being dlsciissod in that journal : — I 'boo Ihoro U some difference of opinion about:tho. relativo capabilities of the bioyclo (with a good rider) and tho horso, so if it ia deemed worth while, it may bo advisablo to expose tho bearings of tho matter. The fastest horse may, for tho purposo of this argument, be taken as the winner of tho Derby, and, not to go into fraotiona, it may bo been run in'2 mins.'43 sees. Against this wo will ^-ut Cortis'a record of a milo on a racing path in 2 mins. 42 soca. — less, then two-fifths of a second. Honco tho fastest horso is about half as fast again as tho bioyolo for that distance.' Diophantes and Galopin aro each credited with running tho Rowley milo in 1 min. 45 sacs., and that is 17 yards over the mile. I think that puts what is vulgarly oalled a s luelcher on tho notion that the fastest bicyclist can boat the fastest horso at short distances ; but tho case ia quito altered whon wo increaso tho distance. Whereabouts such a horso as Isonomy or St. Simon would begin to uomo back to the bicyclist I havo no data to bhow ; but I should think that at tho end of six miles the bioyclist would begin to fool quito easy, and at the ond of 20 miles would bo ahead, or at least lovol. I supposo such horseo as ono might find in tho Belhus stud could do -10 miles, with an occasional easy, on, say, thrco ilays a w'eek ; ? but I am quito sure flint no hunting man who loved his mount would oxpect it to do more. Now 40 miles in a day is child's play to oven a second rate bicyclist ; henco the notion that a hor-e would havo' tho best of it in long dis tances is set aside. ... Tho running mutch for sGOO a sido for 150 yards, between Scott nnd Mr. Uhrs' blackboy, camo off as arranged in Laudiborough streot, Normanton, and ro-ultqd :in an easy win for tho latter by six yards; time 15J sees. Tho blackboy was also backed by his master to clenr a foot 10 inches in a running high jump, but tho stako was forfeited, for tho reason it ib understood that running matches for big amounts aro on the tapia.
