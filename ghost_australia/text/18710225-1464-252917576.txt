Ha! Ha! Ha! Well, as far as he was individually concerned, he did not care what the Press said. It was our duty to do the best we could, according to our judgment. We were always obliged to the Press for supplying us with l'easons or facts, but we acted upon our own convictions of what ,vas right. Yon James Martin. Ha, ha, ha ! — This is rather good, too, from one who has, to say the least, considered the propriety of starting a protectionist paper, and who has supported sundry comic papers devoted to the interests of his own party. Why if this kind of clap-trap is indulged in again, the Assembly need not be surprised to see the ghost of the "Laughing Jackass" grin its contempt at the small silliness of such assertions. "Always obliged to the press for supplying us with reasons and facts" says Von James, apparently not seeing that this is doing about all the work. He might have said reasons and brains. Von James ought to know that in the necessity of things, and as a rule, given two men of equal talents, one engaged as Editor of a daily newspaper, and another as a member of an Australian Assembly, the Editor would be the man best able to advise od the policy for a country. His knowledge is of a wider character — his time not nearly all consumed in planuing defeats for those who want to get his screw, or whose screw he wants to get. This screw-hunting is decidedly antagonistic to broad progressive views, rendering those engaged in it totally unfit to be consulted on matters affecting the vital interests of the colony ; though a singular feature of the malady is that the patient is totally unconscious of its characteristics, and speaks and acts as if he could see as far and clearly as those placed in more elevated and less hampered positions.
