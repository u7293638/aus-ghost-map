To tho Editor of "The Herald." Sir.— I request once more Just a little of your valuable spaco to give a certain line of reas oning on this matter of spirits tbat may en tertain spiritualists. It Is well known to all men, without going to any authorities on the subject, that all life on this earth, whether In tho vegetable or animal kingdoms, Is com posed of one and the self-same substanco, and imbued by ono common energy. Tho energy of life, In which eloctrieity plays a very large part. For Instance, a man eats a cabbage, or sheep, or a fish, and they become part of bis body; a man falls Into tho sea, and Is eaten hy a shark, and he bocornes'part of tho shark. The same energy also porvsdes tbo whole, and tho only dlffcrcnco lies in the mechanism, and not lo the energy. How would "Spiritist" like to say that bo could seo tbo ghost of a cab- bago when tt is cut by tho gardener, or the ghost of sheep when It ts killed by the but cher, or tho ghost of a fish, when it is draggud from the water. If he can seo the ghost ot a man when ho dies, he ought to be able to see tho ghosts of all other forms of life, when they die. What is man? An animal, walking at the bottom of a deep sea (GO miles or so deep) of a fluid called air, and nothing more. His bodily construction with every bone, muscle and fibre In It, is .nlmllar to that of ' nil the other ani mals, ami is Imbued with tho self-samo energy. He (s aubfect to the same diseases, and Is rAverned by the same natural laws as all the rest! A man once said; "The only difference between me, find my dog is. that I am the big ger rasdM'ot tbe two." If any man differs from me In his lines of thought ho may bo ono of tho best men In the world for all tbat. I nover make my arguments personal, but a manv Dcniilo fall into this error.— I am.
