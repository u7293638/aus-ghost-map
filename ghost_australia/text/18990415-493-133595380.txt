THE BEAUTIES OP TIIE SOITT,.' ' I The temple itself is the heart of ' man ; Christ is the high priest who from thence sends up the 'incense of prayers, and joins them to his own intercession and presents all together to his Father ; and the Holy Ghost, by his indwelling, hath also consecrated it as part of his temple; and God dwells in our heart by faith, and Christ by His Spirit, and the Spirit by his purities ; so that we are also cabinets of the mysterious Trinity; and what is this short of Heaven itself, but an infancy is short of manhood, and letters of words? The same state of life it is, but not of the same age. It is Heaven in a looking glass dark, and yet time, representing tho beauties of the soul, and the graces of God, and the images of His eternal glory, by the reality of a- special presence.'
