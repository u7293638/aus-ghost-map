Why, there is uot « sljigle modern Church— net one of 'those' whicl ?bftv'A.s^parated them'selvea- ifronx the great com; .rnpnity of ..Christendom,... which is ; bo .-united in uame, which has such uniojipf sentiment and faiti; arrio'ngst its own mombera as to have aufficienv iuiH«e.nce to command the respect of those wh(V diifer from them. It would b-j the greatest as* gumption in the world for anr bnmnn triKnnai ?»ny nationalvChwreh to undertake this. Ami what are we to say to individual reformers, or men who collect together a certain little knot of followers— m«n who create division, who are contradicted by those about them, who cause nothing but dissension wherever they extend their . preaching— what, are they to arrogate unto thwmaelyes the high privilege and offica of Runamoning beforo their tribunal the Church of Chriat, condemn its teachers, and undertake to guide them ? The iJw, to the minds of those who understand the immensity of Christendom as a whole, appears the moat absurd and foolish cuac c*n oe conceived : nettucr can any warrant orauthority be found for it anywhere. In the next place, do we find our blessed Saviour indi cating to his apostles that in. after times the Church would go wrong, and that in cast» of it doing so there would be a power and authority fcKaet it rght? I have never found in the Bibl« one single text that lent itself to «u«h a supposition. On the contrary, the great desire, the great idea of our Saviour was unity of faith, to unite all mankind in ooe faith under Him, their true Shepherd, that they might all receive from Him the words of eternal life, and that, thus united in peace, aud mutual love, they might all advance together in on? compact body to eternal life. There ia one Gad, one Heaven, one faith, one baptism ; everything ia Christianity speaks of uniiy. We tind that our Saviour' established his Church to be the laat tribuual —the great and all- decisive authority iu matters appertaining to faith and religious truth. He waid to his apostles, 'You, are1 the litfht of the world ; you are th« salt of the earth,' We nowhere find that He indicates that the Church or the teaching body wh-lcb. He estab lished would ev-f-r fail or go wrong. What tri bunal could he establish which would be superior to one he had already established? Of coura ?, so Jong as He hatb.' withdrawn Himself into; Heaven, we cannot expect his personal presence '! or .guidance. He has to guide us by men ; but i« it to be suppled that He would appoint one body of men to teach what w*s right and have another body in r--,serye to judge and s t tbt:m riylit ? To the first body of men whom Ha sent to preach and teach He. promised the Holy Ghost, ami also that he would be with them to tke end of the world.
