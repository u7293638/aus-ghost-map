H r S bbyiob explained that the reason th a t the. banqoet had been so hurriedly prepared was H ia tM r Justice Kerfcrd was to icarc for Melbourne ion the ifollowing morning. Any hastiness, would, he .was sure, be .amply. compensated for by. the fa c t that H is Honor was Able; to he presentw ith.them . ■ f-, •• » lir N . J . ?B*6wh proposed “ Success to .-the FederolCouncil of Australasia." H is h e a rt was in th e question :of rfodcratiom and he deemed ita h ig h : honor that he had to propose th at toast (hat evening, i t was in a great measure h is own.choice th at he .was cot a member of the Couoril; indeed it was because he felt th a t the Prem ier should be present to m eet the Prem iers from tho-othevcolonies. Mr Douglas had desired to waive his claims inhiafM r.B row n’s) favor, but h e had; notoccupied the .position fur; th e ires bod which h e had mentioned. H e regretted, th at three of the principal co)o»ie8,had n ot jo in ed the union, b u t h e felt satisfied th a t th is first meeting would inaugurate a federation of the whole of the colonies. In time to come he hoped the question of the free interchange of products between the whole of the colonies would occupy th e attention of the Council. He advised m aderationatfirst, and remarked th at iLe Council would lift the^views of the colonists o ut of the narrow; local, and parochial grooves in which a t present they too frequently ran. (Cheers.) , ^Mx 8 xbvici, who was reoeirod with cheers; said that he did not feel a t all ia form to rep'y. for he had caught a severe cold since the'previous day. l i e had therefore arranged with M r Douglas to respond, ' M r D ouolas, who was received with sheers, remarked th at perhaps his own •pinion did not coincide with those which, were ’ expressed oa the previous dayv- H ii view was that for a time this . fede-' ration was a great union, b ut he had no doubt .that in course of time it would be a greater union atill. His opinion was th at it would,lead to something aimilar to the United States of America. (No, n o ) H e w as expressing merely his own opinion. Since the time that he^ had a r ­ rived in Australia he had noticed - tho progress which the colonies had made, and he felt oertain that a republic was the deatiny, of the Australasias.. These colonies were gradually forming themselves into a great empire, and it would not be long before they would be dissatisfied with being governed .h r a bit of an island in the northern' hemisphere called G n a t Britain. (O h!) W hy, it was all nonsense. (Renewed cries of "O h .") I t was not a ghost ; it was a fact. (M r K kbfbbd : W hat a rc you going to gain by it P) I t was not so much a,Question of that tort. I t would m a k e s man feel that, he was not dependentTbut that he was a part of a g reat nation of his own. He did not say th a t we should seperate in an improper manxmr —not like the United Slates—hnt i t would be a separation of a friendly ebaracier. There was no donbt about this, th a t the day would come as noon ae th ere was an European war, when the colonies, united as they are, would hare to consider th a t . great question, and when th e Federation would hare to take i t into consideration. (M r S bkticb : D id n 't we have to do th a t with th e Soudan P) The Soudan ! The Soudan w as a piece of humbug, an ignisfaistut, a piece of buncombe not worth considers* tioa. I t was done simply to perform w hat could have beei done far m ere •aaUy without it. This was not a new idea of his. Forty years ago lie drank th e toast of “ The Australasian Republic,'' and hs would drink it again before be died. (M r GairriTH : No.) H e didn’t care who said “ no *' Things were drifting th a t way. The people whom they were e d u ­ cating around them would, by-acd-bye, not know Englano’s Queen except by h istory; they would not know anything about G reat Britain. These were only hie owd private views. He agteed with w hat Lad besa aaid yesterday, and in the Council itself he would not eiy w hat he h ad said that night. B ut they had m et together entirely in a social way, an d a wsan than had a right to express his own private opinion. M r Gb if n t h remarked th at he would propose the toast of " T he ^Legislature, for, although it was not re p u b lic a n ,h a d quite as much freedom • a any republic could have. (Cheers.) Nobody could help heiag struck w ith’tbe youthful enthusiasm of M r Douglas, but he could eee no reason why they should leaisn ia their allegianoe to the M other Country. I t was qnhopossible,that euch fc lime as M r Douglas had indicated would come when A ustralian wonld forget Great Britain, but he did not think gt would come within his time. The statesman of England endeavoured a* kaueh aa possible to meet the viewa o f the •oloaiste. and the only reason why some* -times they did not succeed was because th e colonies themselves were so frequently a t crosi-pirpoaes. One peculiarity about the legislature here w as that Ihe Council was permitted to amend «»oney hills. If such a thing w are pro* posed ia any of the other colonies it would be considered flat blasphemy. L ast session the Queensland Oounoil sent back the Appropriation Bitl, and he had no doubt th at it w ould be oeasidered a curiosity to the end o f time • n the Parliamentary history of Queensland. (Laughter). M r G b lu bu w d (President o f the legislative Counoil) thought th a t in re>. gam to what M r Griffith had aaid, the Legislative Council of other colonies might well take example from th a t of this •oloay. M r A. D obson (Speaker of th e As- l eembly) returned thanks for th e Lower 'M oult. H o was afraid th a tth o so who did not know M r Donglaa so w ell as he did had taken his remarks too seriously, feller all ho was sure th a t it w as only * ■oka.. M r Douglas, he was inclined to Slunk, opposed more for the sake of ^opposition than anything else. (Cheers ) He pointed out th a t M r G riffith had eomewbat exaggerated the relatioas beaween the Legislative Council and the Mouse of Assembly in this colony. . M r B bbbt, who was received with •cheers, proposed the judges, coupled with 'Xt)$ names of U r Aeling-Cbief Justice Giblin, M r Justice Kerferd, and M r .'Justice W nafordsley. He th o u g h t that federation was to strengthen ra th e r than rtpw eaken tho relations betw een thc»o Uolohles and lhe M other Country. 'What? -*«ver ynisht -be the future h istory of the ^CustfalasUn colonies, there could be no q uestion. 4hat a t - present th e y were ^thbronghly loyal to Great B ritain. (Loud Cokaers.)
