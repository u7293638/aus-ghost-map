THE LATE FIRE AT BALLAARAT. 'The Ballaural Times gives the followinVj additional memoraudare3pe-!ting tha- lnte fire on tho Alain road : — 'We have nothing to. add to the account- of Friday ? night's firo which -appeared in tlie- ' I'l^ids of-Satu'Way. The spot wa3 visited by most of tlje citizens in tlje oOurae of Saturday, and {he utter destruction' of ti& houses and their contents testified to the fierceness^of tho con flagration. -She-despoiled owners of the premises wero ? to be seeu searching among, the ruins for any remnant of the pnperty that might havo' escaped, but nothing was found. ,Tho only olyect that retained even a semblancs of their original appearance were certain articles of hardware. On the spot where Mr. Broolce'a shop had stood tb ore were ghosts of ironmongery dis cernible— shovels^ buckets, axe's, A:c, which wero recognisable in spite of the effects of tho fire.

We' are' glad to' Team that a fund is being raised for .tlie benefit of the suffer ers by the (ire. A few gentlemen determined upon 'taking such a step almost before the fire had bean ex tinguished, and on Saturday morning they commenced colincti -g subcriptions. A considerable sum was raised in the course of the day. Twenty di.tinct properties havo been burnt or pulled down to stay tha fire, ?' ' ?' '
