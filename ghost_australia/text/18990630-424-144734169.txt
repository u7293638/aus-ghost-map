A REPENTANT GHOST. M So you actually believe in ghosts ?' re marked Charlie Beavers, interrogatively, with an amount of flippancy in his tone, and au amused smile on bis ratber boyish lace, to bis elder aad more sedate friend Kobeit Porder, as they aat together in the former's comfortable bachelor rooms ooe evening towards tbe close of the laat mouth of the year, discusaiog a choice blend of whisky (judiciously commingled with potass), aud blowing curly bluo wreaths from unim peachable cigars. '* I am bound to believe iu them/7 replied the other iu all seriousuess. '* Wbat 't Do you mean to say that you bave seen one ' Decidedly ; I may say I almost owe my wife to a Spook.' 'Come.

You uuderstand r*' ' Perfectly,'* Htid Charlie, all eaeerness for the recital. ' Go ahead, I'll be as mum as I a-a-a what's its usme.' ' Well, you must know before 1 secured (tbroueb tbe influence of my fatbsr-iu-law; my preseut positioa as manager of tbe bauk here, 1 was pursaiug tbe calling of aa Accountant in Csrcbester. After three years' hard labour I began to leel my feet aad think 1 might veuture to ask a certain yeung lady to share my future lot. I was tolerably sure tbat 1 should meet witb no rebuff from my darling, but there was a stern pareut to be reckoned with. ' I had msde tbe acquaintance of Mr. Matthew Turnover, bead of tbe respected and old crusted banking-house of Turnover Bro tbers, and Cbeckwell. through ordiuarv busiuess intercourse and we became in timaou quite iutimate terms. I frequently spent my Sun days at his charmiug residence iu the park He bad au ouly daughter, Eleanor. The rest you will readily understand. Well, I put tbe momentous question to the dear girl aod achieved the success 1 plead guilty to have beeu vain euougb to anticipate. ' Then followed tbe inevitable interview with papa. He eviaced oe surprise when 1 told him my tale, as many fathers do after being themselves the prinac movers in bringing two impressionable young peaple together. He was straightforward enough. Told ma, al though he bad certainly cherished more ambi tious views for bis ouly child, it was not his in leuthm te try ta enforce his ideas if they were likely to interfere with bis daugh ter's happiness. Still, he was Louud to consider the impertaot ques tion of ways aud means, aud though be admitted 1 had made rapid and substautial progress iu my profession— if such it could be called— heat the same time did not consider tbe income 1 was tbeu earning sufficiently large to jus: ify me in taking upou myself tbe res ponsibility of a wile aofl probable contingencies. ' He wouud up by saying : ' ' Although Eleauor, as you know, is au ouly child, she will not// materially beaefit through me on her marriage, as it is my fixed intention to withdraw no sum of consequence from tbe bank. My share of the profits— ex- cept so much of it as I require to live upon — remains iu the concern until my time comes lor quitting this world, tbeu, of course, Eleanor * ill inherit what 1 shall leave behind me. But, God be thanked, I am well and hearty, and may leasonaoiy looa torwara co ten or uiieen years iouger of useful life. My advice thereforo to you, is go ou workiug as you have dooe hither to, aud, in three years say, you cau broach : tbe subject again, and if Eily should be still in the same oiind regarding yourself, why we may perhaps ste if matters cannot be arranged. It; inc meantime, there will he- at all events ou my part — no difference io our friendship ; there's my hand upou it.' 11 You may guess I did uot fee! extravagantly jubilant over the arrangement. Three yearc seemed ao awful long time to wait But I ha:l tbe fullest faith in Eleanor's coBstaucy. How t *er, 1 will get ob to the finish; I don't wish to l-ore you with too mauy personal details. ' Al-out eight months had gone by, wben one d' y ia tbe middle of December, Mr. Turnover hastily eatered my unpretentioas office. The old gentleman appeared greatly agitated, aud it was sjme moments attar being seated tbat he was able to speak. ' 1 aoxiously inquired if be were ill, or was auy thing wrong st home r '? ' No — uo one ill,' he said, slowly. ? Tbe bauk has beeu robbed.' Kobbt-d : 1 exclaimed. ? rbew : H«ie the thieves beeu caught Y '* 1 You don't understand. The robbeiy is from inside.

' ' Ay [ Tbe smootb-tougued hypocrite,' said Mr. Turnover, with considerable empba--i« ' And he's got a good tweoly-four hours' start He was away oo short leave/ ' * Wbat is tbe amount ?' I at-ked.

I want you te come to the bank aod go through the books — bis books, you know —as expeditiously as possible. Wn wish to ke- p tbe affair secret— that is, aa loug as possible. Will you come ?' ' Aud Mr. Turnover regarded me anxiously ' Then thinking, perhaps, I seemed to hesi tate, he added, significantly, ' It may be wortL yi-ur while.' 1 an at yonr service, Mr. Turnover,' 1 in atsntly replied. *Whea do you wish me to be gio ?' «* ?

Tfutb to tell, sn idea flashed across my mind that I might decide to ask a favour of him io return after tb- present aunoying business was over and don- witb. *' My future father in-law rose frura his » at, saying : ' * I am very pleased you bave consented to belp me so readily, because we can rely upoa your discretion aod absolute aileoce,' 1 bowrd.

By this time, although the night was cold outoide, tbe room I was working' i in begau, by reasoo of tbe many gas jets burn ing, to grow uncomfortably warm.
