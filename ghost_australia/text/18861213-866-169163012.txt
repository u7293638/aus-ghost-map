> -JhB EOl'.-OE OF i n s TASMAKUN 1 MTS MEREDITH. Sib,—So after a*l tbe widow of oui and foremost statesman, Cfaerlei Meredith, to go without her mosey. Judge Dobn eaid firrt that abauieter may not buy out interests uuder tb< ;r fuU value. Then after a tiansaciion of the lind is covered tip, pnd it to me appears dear, tbe lady must go without remedy. TVhat ate we to say to tbifi ? Never haB proceedings at the Supreme Court caused 6uch dibBatii* or awakened eudi indignation, bow things seem* to stand with tbe public in re'ercnce to civil law. A lot of land sharks called barristers fasten themselves on their "clients,” and suck out their life’s blood. Tbe one will not split upon the other, or even take op a that treads on his brother’s toes, and should a case find its way into the court the judge, as he ascends to his chair, puts on, with bis wig, a pair of colored spectacles, id so cau see nothing that does not ma'reify the beauties and excellence of the lone-go wnedfratemity. Poor Mrs Meredith, the wife of old Charley! Could the ghost of the old warrior ascend the tribune once mote how would his fiery cloqrence ru g again. Judge DobBon has beard it before in terrible scathing sounds 5 for the two used to sit on opposite benches. Let — entreat Sir Lambert to interest bimselt behalf of tbe widow of bis once Fa liamen- tsry co-werker. Let me implore that the lady ittu may aasm have ___ . .her . . ____ In the name Ctod has justice flown away from the island I Shades of Charley anso, and diffuse thy spiritual essence among tee mbs of tbe law. Tbe last appeal must be to tbe public. Has the pubUc^notbing — aay P—Yours, etc. MOILER.
