Man and his Distinguishing Features, \- Br J. D. K. To: all bnt the acceptors of the short account given by Moses, ihe Jewish legislator, the origin of man Is inexplicable. They know not whether he sprang from a ehin^el-tree, jelly-fish, 'or monlssy, or . • dropped from heaven, Eke Diana, the - goddess of/the Ephesians. Darwin; Sahnond, Huxley, and Haecfcal, the great preachers of evolution, have formulated theories, but SQ itisuijjng to common sense tiiat they, have been-compelled * to modify, and in some instances to leave them take their place "with "other ghosts of not blessed .memory in the history of'hjasty speculation." ... The theory-that finds the .origin of man. "primordial slime" is'as- absurd-as the . assertion of the naturalist Lamarck, that' the longing of the animal brought it fins " J tb swim in the sea, -and wings to fly in ..the/ heavens," and tin til sometfcmg better is produced the majority of men'will acquiesce in the theory, which' connects the origin of man with an Almighty creative power, for "no gospel of dirt" as" Carlyle says, " teaching . , that inetf h£ve de^iid^^m~fn>gi!i through V- monkeys; can Bet it amde." > -.-.. f. • .. ,-j. Turning from -the origin -to 'ilbe positidn . taken by'man in-the MimM'w^rld a greater' / ; * ' oneness of opinion is perceptible, for with? universal consent man takes dis place at the. v .. head of all animal existence. Sbakspeare's . unique utterances. when he inakcs ilamiet' say, ".What a piece of work is man ! how noble -in reason I bow ufinite in-faciiliy! in form and moving how expressed and-jadmir-> able ! in action how like an angel 1 in &ppre-; . hension how- like a god l the beaHty ^ the' world! the paragonof animals !" arenot the . '- mere product of his exuberant imagination,; . . but-facts presented in their best form, and • T to which the learned are willing, for the - ; most part, to assent. • - - • Man's .distinguishing features are many. The least noticeable is .the£ut that fee«an . live on the flesh of beasts, or fish, or- on herbs, i.-e., he can become^camiYorpus, pisci- •. ' . vorous, or* herbivorous^ utd be can exist in ; v < " every clime, for man is to be found froth the bleak and barren shore, of. Fu^o to 'the ^"farthest .Qna^^^^^ff^fZ.^ itself, wher^ falling gt^^lyj Ifte^^^ goes out," and this embn^ & i&npmWr;«-d ranging from a heat which makes the spirit: ' of wine boil, to that which makes mbreary " / freeze. • •- - - . . ' Man's bands, or the .faculty of opposing, the thumb to the other fingers,.so. is to seize upon the most minute-, objects,-' and erect ' - posture are also *3istinguishiiig features. I think it is Ovid who, adverting to the hitter, sayB—"While other creatures totheearth v .. . looked down, he (Jove) gaye to man a front" 1 - sublime, and raised his noble view tw kcn; ^ the starry skies." .. ... . -. But these are' jipt the greatest.featores. His abibtyto»d^thira»elf to tbe_conditions . of his eristence, provide. himself with food, shelter, weapons^of^^ttack and defence, and solve the problems which surround him, is greater; for if the inort hnm^ of t^ apes— 1 . the juost intelligent gorilla that the woods can furnish—be taken;..it cannot neither e sunk nor raised above nor below the ape" : tandard ; but if the lowest human beings " n this continent be taken—the abongihes— nd by , patience the chfldren can be imensely improved by a secular, moral, And : eporter who visited Point Macleay Aboriginal Missionlast month, '* of lihe 'somewhat sullen look that uncultivated aboriginal \- children -almost invariably bear, there'. in the faces of the^miMi oh-trained boys . nd girls an added brightness and vivacity made all' the" difference between the and the savage." Through the ^development of big intellectual powers inan -can -not only scan the heavens, but .tell - how the stars will move - age to Age—even when -to a moment the comfets will return from their farjourneying in space. He can make the lightning: subservient to. his - .purposes, descend into' the strata of the earth, and - read their records";" gaze at" the" goigeous flower, the handsome shell, and the magnificent rainbow, and. trace their gloiy to one source, the fountain of earth's material beauty—the sun; and he. can stand on the seashore, and while the waves are chasing each other, breaking .in solemn layB and casting np their silvery spray, he can explain some of the -mysteries of the ocean, and see -the great conserver of animal and vegetable Ufe on the planet, the source of its r fertilising showers, rivulets! -and rivers. Another, but not the last or least, diBtin- : . guisbing feature is' the power of articulate speech Which'is f^uliv.'jto'^W^'shd'oneof' the most important aids' ih "the' use and development of his nnderitancling. It plays. an important part in - education* -commerce, and government, for by : it mfkn instructs, persuades, and commands his fellows ; and - gives proof of hiB greatest distinguishing feature which is the clement in bis nature, difficult to iMtlat&> or ^define, ''but, which enters, penetrates,: and " blends with his whole physicaIchaTacter 1 **.an"d'ha8 connected . with it an insatiable aspiration for something nobler and pnrer. It. is this imma-._ terial, insatiable element or soul, however . - defined, that constitutes' the distinctive peculiarity of man. " Give the ox his fodder, and the ass his thistle, and they are content. But give a 'shoeblack half the universe, and he. will not be content without .the other half." Snch ate some of man's distinguishing features, and if remembered-and allowed to have their due effect through life, youth will develop into , true manhood, and when the weight of years shall press upon the outer humanity, " an ^d aigipMi Mi ujnd bright, and lovely u *fl3jpla&d; nijit, ilwBiniwiil such to the grew."
