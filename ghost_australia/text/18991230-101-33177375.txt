ENTERTAINMENTS. "LITTLE RED RIDING HOOD." In producing"Little Rcd Riding Hood ' for their Christmas pantomime season Messrs. Jones and Lawrence have provided a play for the most part of the traditional order, with rather more than a flavour of musical burlesque. The concluding act of three is given over entirely to specialty turns, while the time honoured harle- quinade is omitted. Harlequinades have ever possessed charm for both juveniles and children of a larger growth at Christ- mastide, and though a clown, pantaloon, harlequinade and columbine are missing in "Little Bed Hiding Hood," burlesque ant Ctomimic business of a legitimately aorousjiature abounds. Last Saturday's audience in Cremorm Gardens was a very large one, eztn seating accommodation in the aisles having to be provided. The younger folks to whom a pantomime appeals most as an en- tertainment were poorly represented, but each and all of those present may be ex- pected to advertise well the merits of the production, and attracting, as it deserves to do, large audiences the play should ex- perience a run of several weeks, and im- prove upon the record of a fortnight for any one piece in Perth." With the view to .attaining a íuH measufoofsuccess, Messrs ' Jones and Lawrence effected a re- engage ^ent of theeervioes pf Miss Lottie MOOR and Mr. Albert Bellman, the two cleve) ^sketch artistes now so well -known to th« frequenter* ^of Cremorne. The servioei .Iso of the Parleys, a trio of patftomimisti and specialty artistes, recently with thc Flying Jordan?, were secured. Thu ;? trio were seen, to a disadvantage in th< . circus" tent performance of the Jordans baton a stage proper, nuder the condi . tàons of the Cremorneçantomime, they ar< r' afforded the fullest opportunities for UM display ef tfieir novel specialties, and lh< : nndemable recalls accorded them on Satur , day night should be all- sufficient testimony to their undonbted abilities. "Miss Lotti« ; Moore was cast for the title rôle of th« production. Mr. Bellman taking tho par! of the Baron de Web*, while the Ferles . Brothers, Will and Guy,' filled tb< s -chantara of Clod and Bosey Kate, twc .-; rustics. The provision of most of tin comic business rests in the bands of tb< ' Varley Brothers, though the characters o! fuck (the Forest King), Dame Hood : Wiggle Waggle, and Billy Hood, con v ^tribute to that end in no small degree ^.fäverylJodyV net/t Little Bed Biding gf Hood, the Baron de Wolf, and Biding ^i&tmjife; faithful beau, Jack, are tbt V, more .sentimental characters in the plot ^/;of ';the pantomime, which tells simplj SÍ tire old familiar fairy tale. Leealised an« ^ adapted by a local pressman, who prefen ? p to remain incog., the pantomime has run : X ming through it veins of humorous hits, and , plays upon the names of- public mea, tbt t «nain lode of unobjectionable satire in if jclnoing references galore to political and anunicuí>al incidente, and love taps al y.

The punning perpe- trated in the rhyming was also clever. » ' The adaptation .of the original lines of th« ~. .ftantoniime has been done well. and ' brightly, the localising is thoroughly up to . Í date, and, in respect particularly to the ^ ;^aç|o^X*ve Just Had a Wire to Say-So," ¿ Jbetween Bed Biding Hood, Jack, and Baron de Wolf, in the.second act, this is specially ; the case. < # Miss Lottie Moore filled the rSU of Little > Bed Biding Hood as though, born to the ^ :; pairt.

The ^ gifted little lady accompanied ber last song '/ with a dance, and concluded by giving hex " own ^ G ver " specialty, the audience insist >; ins on a repefation of the feat. Mr. Albert \- Bellman made himself at home thoroughly : . as the villain of the pb*y, the Baron de V: Wolf, described in the bill se a blood- -thirsty monster. His scenes with Bed ; Biding Hood were made the more interest Jl: lng by reason of. Mr. Bellman's affectation of the cruel nature of the bold bad animal intent on harming the little giri. In one of these scenes, however, the adaptation of Í .^the nantomime plot provided fo.r an inter :' "lode in the form of a duet between Miss ~ " Moore and - Mr. Bellmen. This wee the u iifieti " When a man and amajden begin to TWO©,** the kissing by-play beug very amus ; îng.

Mr. Ted Button, OB Devaetino, the Wolf's lieu- tenant, had not much to do other than to look foolish and act promptly in obedience to hiß master's orders, and this he did well. Wiggle Waggle, brother of Bed Siding Hood, was impersonated by Mr. A. Hyman, and very funny he made the character. Fuck was a character intended to carica- ture a well-known public man, and this was done to an extent. Introducing a speech burlesquing a number of public ut- terances of members of the Ministry, with repetitions of interruptions that, according to Hjansard, will be handed down as political history, Mr. Harry Gray essayed to create laughter* each time he spoke, and did so. As a diminutive policeman, wearing clothes several sizeB too large, Mr. Gray was most ridiculous. He was responsible for the song "The Peaceful Policeman," which satirised the duties of the Tocal police force. Miss Florrie Banger found a congenial part in the impersonation of Billy Hood, a larrikin. Her song, " I'm king of the bottle oh! push" was received so favour- ably that an extra verse was demanded, j The Lennon Brothers, Ted and Bert, filled the parts of the First Ghost and Second Ghost respectively, and attired in quaint and skeletonic dresses, performed their light duties creditably. The old favourite, Mr. Joe Cowan, fairly revelled in the part of Dame Hood. The liberties he took with other characters, his own quaint mannerisms and original by-play ensured success for Mr. Cowan. Mr. Harry Carle- ton had but a brief appearance to make as Granny. Miss Celia Gbiloni appeared as Queen Frolic in the prologue, Miss Jessie Thornton as Felicia the Fairy Queen, Miss Amy Thornton as Buttercup (the Queen's attendant). Miss Stella Bangeres Ast&cia; (another fairy), and Miss Farley as Ze netta. In the third scene in Act I. the Farley Brothers gave the duet "At the Hotel Where Wo Live," and in the secoud scene (a prison) in Act II. their duet, "Prison Beforms"-a skit on the move- ment to improve the conditions in prisons -mado a big hit. In the concluding act the three7 Farleys gave a mandolin and banjo trio to march time, and followed by an eccentric dabee. Messrs. Carleton and Sutton rendered one of their inimitable song and dance turns, the patter which followed being very mirth-j>rovoking. An absence of vulgarity-is the Characteristic of this "double's" business. Mr. Harry Gray, in the extravagant costume of Puck, repeated his first Cremorne success, tiie laughing song, "So did I," and could not escape two encores. The * Sisters . Thornton and Miss May Marlow gavo a neat dance, which -was recalled. Chief of all the "festivities at tho Wolf's castle," the concluding scene, was Mr. Bellman's song, in the guise of Father Christmas, entitled, " Good Old Father Christmas.*' In. this the singer concluded the choruB of each verse by producing front., his bag of gifts appropriate presents for children, the aged and infirm, the goldfields separationiete, and His Excellency the Governor, to whom references were made in tho verses of tho song. The idea was an excellent one, and Mr. Bellman made the most of the opportunities^ the song presented. The references to'Her Majesty's representative are, however, open to question, and upon the whole at least onevof the number might be excised with- out sacrificing the humour of the piece. The full strength of the company was not on Saturday night called into requisition ia the presentation of variety turns in the last, act, tho clever Lennans, Miss Stella Banger, and Miss Marlow individually being missed. In subsequent performances, however, these artistes will appear. The mounting; dressing, and stage management of tho pantomime call for more than passing notice. The minor characters, in addition to the stars to whom special reference is made above, were all dressed with due regard to effectiveness, and the three new cloths by Mr. Charles Basing, used in several of the scenes, assisted in the same direction. The arrangement of a march by a number of children. Bed Biding Hood's playmates,, was creditable. To Mr. Harry Fitzmaurice, apart from the performers, is due ' special praise for his untiring energy, with the object of staging a pantomime worthy of appreciation. The tedium of long re- hearsals and heavy work in arranging the minutest details in regard to the produc- tion culminated in Mr. Fiizmaurioe's suc- cessful presentation of the pantomime, the stage management of which left nothing to be desired. Mr. James Stewart com- petently arranged most-of tho music for the pantomime, and led bis orchestra without a hitch. The pantomime was re-, peated each evening during the week.
