"ONWARD AND UPWARD." I FOOTSCRA~, SATURDAY, MAY 6; I885. f The Borough Position. As there is'no fundation whatever for the glarinig mis-statements made tinie after time by a journal emanating from Williamstown, we:felt inclined at first to bsimply content' ourselves with !a; denial of them. This course, however; seems to have emboldened theiBoough'. traducers, as the falsehoods:h've been reiterated with- v,ilful and "malicious persistency,, and arei calculated to' damage: the ' municipal. 'credit an'd. seriously depreciate: the, value, of prbo peiy. We. are iunwilling to, attach weight :or .importance-' tor; anything commig 'from such a source, 'and know it could do little' harm if confined io the Borough, but when wesee thelike malversions appear i ina imetropolitan daily, it is time to /place; facts:bfoie our readers and-the public, that iwill lay; bare: the falsehood of the vindictive allegations, and show how little. their authors, are,to be relied on;,:In oirder to. clearly and. completely'iconvict beyond doubt or quibble, we have taken the: Borough tbalance sheets for the, ast ten years, and give the result of our researches' ina tablulafti?formii so. that the most simple-minded or obtuse, will understand the. financial positioir each year of the decade. The figures are the "wob`' fdfIMessrs. Irving, Youell, ."Orr, Aitchison, and' the - present Town Clerk, aand are certified as'correct by- these gentlemen, also by Messrs. Schild, Langwill, White head, Slade, and' the various Govern ment auditors, so that none but those proof and conviction will doubt them. To show that'it is pretty evidenit -the Borough, like nearly everyother muni cipal body, has been in debt-since it has .:been in existence,, and that our :liability' has- not':nearly, increased in proportion with our- ability to payr we take the balance sheet for 1875. In it w~ifind that the year commenced with, a bank overdraft of. -6856 z6s. 7d.. in .,addition ;to ~other outstanding, accounts, carried forward from 1874'? and wound 'up with a' bank overdraft of :19go5 75S 6d'"" A glances" i atthe' table will show that the latter;, amount was not .the actual indebtedness? minds loans, but i that "it. ,'amounted ~'to 398c 13s: 2d.,and that with-t only an. income of, 2276 i8s. from a general 'n'd `special r~at?of i's. 6d: inh the `pound to meet it. In x884 the. bank overdraft andd other- debts, minus loans; was£?5?87 7 os sod., : and the general and specialrrates at :Is. 6d.- in the pound gave' £437 s., so that, while the income from that source had more than doubled,ithesum owed wads lessened: It muist. also' be borne in mniiid that in 1875 and the.. years previous, tolls were in force, and'in the latter- year our shlire from the . main road toll fund:was £1484 -5s,. d.: in addition to sibsidy, while the Shire of Braybrook paid one-half of the cost df miaintenlance.: Now there is no toll fund,--and- we .have-to- maintain-the Swaimp road, less small annual grant from? Government, from our own resources.-.-Coiing ifto Kilie " table annexed let readers take the figures and see for themselves if the financial coni ditiionii isasdesperate as. stated ,'tr Gs ^ep B ink :,Liabiliy in.
