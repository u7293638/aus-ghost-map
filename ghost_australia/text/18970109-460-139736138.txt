FIVE LINKS IX A GOLDEN CHAIN. 4 CFBWOS br C. R cp'-anF/iV. ! 'To Titu«. mine own for, 'trot'} son after the i eemraoD faith; grace, mere-y, and peace, front God ; the Father and the Lord Jt=ut Christ oar Saviour." ; —Titus, L, t. j Among the friends of Pad, Titos was one of the most useful and one of the best beloved. Paul was the ajnetle to the Gentiles, and Titus was a Gen tile, I should suppose that both his parents were : Gentiles, and in this respect he differed from Timothy, whose mother was a Jewess. Timothy would " well serve as a preacher to the circum ' eirion, bat Titus would be a man after Paul's heart ' as a preacher to the Gentiles. He seems to have been a mas of great c-ommonsense; so that, when Paul had anything difficult to be done, be sent ; Titus. When the collection was to be made at f C'orintb on behalf of the poor t—nts at Jerusalem, Paul sent Tins to stir the members up, and with him another brother to take charge ol the contri butions. Titus appeals to have been a man of business capacity and strict probity, as weil as a 1 man who could" order the church aright and i preach the gospel with power. Paul was, on one occasion, comforted by the coming of Titus. At another time be was sad because Titus was not . where he had hoped to meet with him. Though ! we know little about him from the Acts of the ' Apostles, or anywhere else, be appears to have • been in every way one of the ablest of the cem • pan ions of Paul, arid the apostle takes care to men tion him over and over again in his Epistles to the ■ GaUtians and to the Corinthian.-, rendering | honour to whom honour is due. It is a great pity when eminent men forget those who help them, and it is a sad sign when any of us do not ; gratefully feel bow much we owe to our coad j juters. What can any servant of God. do unless be ; has kind friends to bear him up by their prayers and their help t Paul did not forget to mention lend ana helper. Titus. bis friend ! Dear brethren, in this particular verse, which : I have chosen fur my text, it seems to me that, ■ Paul has brought together five points in which he j was one with Titus. It is a great blessing when , Christian men are in union with each other, and i when they are willing to talk about the bonds ; that unite them. The more we can promote true ' unity among Christian men the beper. " First > pure, thai peaceable," must be our motto; first, ! the truth; afterwards, unity in the truth. We : must not be content with merely contending for I the faith; we most next fight the battles of life, and do all we can to note the points in which ! true Christians are agreed, 1 desire, at this time, j to "stir up your pure minds by way of rem em { brance," to refresh your memories in regard to all 1 the love that we have borne to one another in the days and years that are now past, and to exhort, you to a still closer union in heart unto the glory of God. There are five things in which Paul seems to roe to bring out clearly bis union with Titus; 1 might call than "Five links in a golden chain." I dull only briefly speak of each of the five, aid try to apply than to ourselves. 1\. First, Paul says of himself and Titus that there was a close relationship between them: "Titus, mine own son." This was a very close relationship; not that Titus was Paul's son after the flesh, for there was no natural relationship between them at all. Pro bably, in the early part of their lives tbev had been total strangers to one another; but now Paul views Titus as his son. We know, beloved, many of us, that the grace of God creates relationships of a very near and tender kind, relationships which will endure through life, relationships which will outlast death, ana lie, perhaps, even more strong and vivid in eternity than they are here. Cp yonder, where they neither many nor are given in marriage, 1 should think that the relationships which come of the flesh will, to a large degree, be merged in their celestial condition; but there, the sonshlp of Titus towards Paul is even stronger than it was when they twain were hoe below. How oomfs that sonshipf It comes often, through God-biasing a ministry to the conversion of a soul. Henceforth, he who has spoken the Word with power to the heart bears to Mm who baa heard it the relationship of a father to a son. There are many in this place to whom 1 stand in this most hallowed relationship. You recognise it I know, and I desire to express my intense and fervent low to the mmy of you who htw been bom unto God by fhe preaching ofthe Wbrd here. I <b not know of ant thing Sit has more greatly comforted roe during the last week or two, in th( time of jtnrp contention for the faith, than the reception of so Jn*nv letters from persons of whom I hive neret befort heard, toying, "You donot « sash a W « ' <\--. .i «-*.* as! wr:te tad sessS *»«: a - _• "... .;, :,~ lt a * =strrtt tc zr+ \ ." ^~,.Ve El',-17 «SfW^4 €Ttr M V.-.. ..,_ t? », '• r_ 6*dfc M6 tS* »K«S««_. ».

Then the apostle, wisi-inp to show- res] wxi the anion between himsed ar.d Tuts, neat ttentioDed that tfcev were brethren by a e nunc® ! faith: "litis, roy true sen after the cunimon : faith." j Yes, beloved, and oar faith is t c mrn-.r.. It i is the same faith in two respect,; first, .xcatee t we bdkve the same troths; and. se<**U;. be; I cause we believe them with ";iht pre- i'r;s .?..c._ ! We who are rightly members of tuts TatKscac .e iCaureh have believed the same truths; no dispsite or discuaa'® amoa? us about the ! fundamentals of our faith. To ns, uere i- one ! God—Father, Son, and Holy Ghost. To tK, there ■ is ws Mediator—Jesus Christ the Saviour. _ We | believe in the electron of arrece by the Ihviive Father; we beKcve in the vicarious satvfiee of I the Eternal Son; we bdieve iu the regener-iiinc wort cf the Holy Spirit, and in the need of it in the case of everv livinfr man, and woman, and , 1 child. We believe in "one L-?rd. one faiti^ one j ! baptism." I fed intensely eraieful for this units j cl faith. A church divided in its doctrine -wisst j ' can it do? If it fans to spend it- rtrencth :n >-®- : tinual debate, what feme has it with which to • eonioer u.e world? But kifiwiikr. as we u • »xow. f ' tiiat the Scriptures are our iiri-rrimr pud!., that j ' tbe Hily Spirit is the jnfatlibie Ejplainer of t the Scriptures, we come to e r e c- mm-.;; t- 1 tit !■•; learn what we are to rcoivc, tr -i we t--'> ivp it j with one common anointiEc. 'itu the an j-.uting j of the Spirit of God. i This unity of the faith if -r- .' tt* tfciurt in i which we ought continually t.v rej.=;<e, I boi>e j ; that I love ail Christians; yet 1 car®,! lielo »>tut 1 . that, when I sit down and talk w;;h a ' .-vtr.t: wh- j briier^s tbe doctrines of grace, I feci myself aj crest deal more at borne ri.£r. I do or.r u I ari | writh one who does not believe them. \\\ nere there 1 ! if the onirv of the faith there seems f, a 1 i music which creates harmony, and tiiat hs-Tnoriy is delightful to the renewed spirit. Go-i greet. ' dear friends, that none of may err from the faith; but that we may !>e steadfast, imm -cable, firrnlv fixed in our belief of the irrc-.. i <1^ tnnc~ j of the go?i»e!, for this is the way ia which we arc r made trolv one. j Tr<en. Paul says tliat l:e and Tiros were one j "after lite common faith;" tl^at is, the or.c- faith; ; was believed by them in the same way. There | ■ is only one faith worth having; Paul calls it, in 1 ; tbe first verse, "the faith of Goo's elect." It U j real faith, cordial faith, childlike faith, God \ given faith. It is not a faith that springs out of j human nature unaided by tbe Holy Ghost: but it , is precious faith, faith which is t!,e gift of CoJ, ■ and the work of the Holy Spirit. Now, if we !* j Jieve only intellectually, we do not enter into : sympatl-v with one another as we do when wo both believe spiritually, with heart and sevj. ; fn>m the very depths of our being. Beloved. I i I trust that I can say of myself, and of >01; also, i that we have received faith as a gift fre.m God; here, then, is another sac-red tic binding us ' together. Vou have that jewel of faith gleaming ' on vour bosom, and here are others who hate the ! same precious jem, so by that very fact vou arc | drawn to -each other. Your faith and my taiui, | if they are both true faith, are "the common 1 faith." 1 may have very little faith, and you 1 may have the full assurance of understanding; j but vour faith and mine are of the same sort. Your faith may be but as a grain of mustard seed, aid your* friend's faith may have grown into a tree; but it is the same faith: it clings to Oic same Christ, and will produce the same eternal re sults in tbe salvation of the souL Come, then, let us spiritually shake hands again over this second point. First, we are closely related to one another; secondly, we possess a common mi to which is a wonderful bond of union between us. III. Carefully note the third link, it is this: IVc have a mutual benediction, for Paul wishes for Titus, "Grace, mercy, and peace." This ,is just what Titus would have wished for Paul if be had been Bending him a benediction: and I wish to you. beloved, "Grace, mercy, and peace," and I think you are in your hearts wish ing for me also, "Grace, mercy, and peace." We all alike need these three choice favours. First, we need "grace" to help. I know how it is with the weak believer; he sees some brave Christian doing mighty works for God, and be says, "Oh, I wish that 1 were like him. Oh, that 1 were as strong as he is!" and he gets the notion that this more prominent worker has no fainting fits or weakness such aa he has. Oh, no! he sup poses that his brother's head is bathed in everlast ing sunshine, and that bis heart is continually flooded with rivers of delight. That shows, my friend, that you are greatly mistaken, tor the moat eminent saint has no more grace to give away than the least in the family of God baa. I sometimes Wish that I could disabuse the minds of our doer trembling friends, Miss Much-afraid and Mr. r«e spondency, of the ideas they have concerning some of us to whom thmr look up with esteem. 1 am not going to let you Into all our secrets; but, believe me, our heads ache as much as yours, and oar eyes are sometimes as wet with tears aa ever yours are, ay, and our hearts gets quite as heavy as your* do. "Yes," you say, "very likely, but thai, somehow or other, you are stronger than we are." Just so, but suppose you have to cany fifty pounds weight, and you can carry that, and no more; well, you have strength enough for your task. If toother piar, has to carry a hundred pounds weight, and he ^saai Aidf anA tIA flMM liA Am (n avails niu ox nuoni, mm be riOf hi* family.

Tib» I. Paul wishes -. jy~d merry. I reminded you. in our reading. tbit Pin!, in writing to 2 chordi, says, "Glare re so tfiq. and pewee"; bat when he writis to- v ir he eiyi, "Grace-. mercy, and peace." ft i'. is if though c.itiifters needed more merry ii.se ti.rIr people do. an-. it if my firm rooririie-i tLit tie mart eminent is their i-dke-. and the m- t* remarkable fs their UMefulneK in the eerrj. c cf God. the more merer d' they require. Brethren, how cat we meet oar res-ponstbilities unlets ve KESUaiir cry, "Is rd. hare merry upon ®f if: w eta we deal faithfully with the souls com Kitted so o«r charge. and be dear of the blood cf all men, cokse the lord shall hare merer upon uf, and upon us beyond all others? ill of as. then, need mercy. I do; do not rsrt? Fc«s are only a plain man. with a family growing op arotsid you; but too uct-d merrt' for" ytwr sins as the bead of the household. Periapt yon an? «en« ftenl or.v 2 domestic serrant. my sister: but yon n«d merer even in that kurable calling of yours. You. periapf. dear friend, are very rich, oh, you need nroofc taertyf And yoa, on the ether band, are wry }«j7T. I ana sore that yoo tteed meter. Scsce of yon are in Ml health: yoa need meter lest rag tboold perrert that strength to an evil purpofe. Cttbers of tou are rery sickly: yoa may well cry for mercy, that yoa nay bear up under roar many pain? and depressions of spirit. We all need mercy; so that is anotbet point in which we are one. Toe third word of sfce fere-diction is "peace" to ccrsfcrt. I hope that many of as kn- w what peace of wasc-ieiK-e means, wfat peace with Cod means, and what peace with man means. If God has given as His peace, it is a treasure of untold value, "the fear: of great price." To be at peace with God is fetter tian to be a millionaire, or Czar .-f all the K iisrizs. Peace of mind, rest fulness of heart, -ruin of spirit, deliverance from care, from qaamdiiog. frctn oerr,f»iaining—1 know that 1 want that kind of peace, and yon want it. too. do y-»j cot? Yoa need it in your utruly, in your husi tiess. sc yoor own harts. Well." then, here we meet again, having tbi? same want of peace: sutd. when we get it, we meet once more in finding the same cdicioos enji-yment of it. I wish to yoa. beloved, now and henceforth, grace, mercy, and peace: and I believe that yc.n wish the same to me. and herein again we join our hands, and bless God that we fee! true union of heart. IV. Cjsc the neat part of my subject, which is rr.- re weighty still, I must sjy but little. It is this—"Grace, mercy, and peace, from God the Fitter sac tire Is-ri Jc-us fYirist." That is, we are one in the source cf every hles- tng. Ali rc-i cemcs to cs fn-rn G->1 the Father, thr ugh the one Mediator, the Lord jestis Christ our Sa vie or. 1 lore to think of this—that ail tl.e gTace. merry, and fe.ee ttat come to you. and all the grace, mercy, and p-eace that come to me, r vrce frcm the heart of Cod. How many waggons there are upon the r.-ad of grace, and ail of tLero heavily laden. Oae ftops at that brother's d-x^. and another waits at this sister's gate; but they si stared from cae st» t. Lrjot cm the side of tlie wagrc.ns. and yen will see the name of the tan-e proprietor cm "every cue- "The chariots of God *r* twertv tliOUiwiMi," but - they are all thfc LotdV; *1 that whatever grate, mercy, and p»eaer come to us at ail, eir.tr from the same place. Get to the very ! ur^.lii: n of this troth, and yon will 6ee '.hat we who believe all eat bread baked in the sax? oven, our clothes come out of the same wardrobe, the water that we drink comes from the same rock, aye, and the shoes that we wear were made by the tsame migmy Worker who t*A> Moses eav to Israel of old, "Thy shoe? shit-J !«■ ir»D and 1.ra^; and as thy. days, so shall thv strvngth ler." Yoa have rr^t anything that is worth Imce bat what your Father gave to you; and v--ur Fatter is my Father, ar.d the iiand tiiat pvirsetii the L-lesaing to y.'ti 1 a.-eih _llie Uessing to tie aad to the wbole fatiiii; of l^iievers. These hk-^inge nut only rorne from the same roari-v, i.u : thee all come by the same channel: "the I.'/ni Jesw Cliritt." There is the sacred blood-mark on every covenant blessing, whet iter j-'U have it, or your brother has it, or eouie Christian far away in India gets it. It all comes b> the ?ame divinely- ap.iioin'.t'd channel—the man, the G .d, Christ deeus < ur Is rd. I do not know ik.v. y. U feel at«ut this mailer, but it seems to me a?" if this ought to bind us very closely together. I recollect when first I left my grandfather, with when; 1 had been brought up as a little child, how crieved 1 was to part irotn him; it was the great sc -row of my little life. Grandfather seemed very sC'tTy, I--., atid we had 2 cry t.gether; he did not quite kiiiw what to say 10 me, but he said, "Sow child, to-night, when the n-.oon shines, and you k>ok at it, don't forget that it is the sane moon your grandfather will he looking at;'' and for t ears, as a chiid. I used to love the- tnoon because I thougiit thai my grandfather's eyes and my own soiut-iit-w met there on the misn. How much letter it is to think that you, dear friend, going right away to Australia, are looking to the Saviour, v-hile ue are doing the same thing iiere, and so our eyes meet: You go to God at the mercy-scat in prayer, and tliat is just where we go, so, after all. we pray at the same sacred spot, and our |>etitiuns meet at the gieat throne of mercy. Thus we are made to feel our blesed union in Christ. Some pjoople say that they try to recollect other r-eop«!c; but if jou rc-ally love them, vou will not "try" to recollect them, you will not be able to keep from remembering them. Their image will come up before your mind's eye; you cannot avoid it, and you will not wish to'avoid it. Bo, dear friend?, we will not say that we will try to re member each other while we are parted a while; but every blesifcg that comes to us shall remind us that it comes from our Father, through Jesus Cnriet our Mediator, ami so we shall feel that we are truly 01*. V. Then to close, there is one more point of union, ami that lis in oyr common relationship to our Lord Jesus Christ. See how Paid puts it, "The Lord Jesus Christ our Saviour." I must dwell briefly upon every word of this title. First, Jesus is Lord to all His pieople, and equally to be obeyed by them all, and adored by them all. it is important that, with bowed knee re verent lore, we call Him Lord and God. We put our finger into the print of the nails, and Urn wound in His ride, confessing that He is and mimt be real man, but, at the same moment, we ay with Thomas, **My Lord and ray God." X cannot pre* tend to have any union with the nun who cannot from his heart say that. If thou dost not count Christ to be God, well go thy way, my fellow man, and I will go mine: but thy way ami my way cannot be the same. We know that this is the Christ of God, and he who does not know it needs to be taught of God the very first principles of the Gospel. So, you see, we have a true unity in the lordship of Christ; we desire, as one tn««y to be obedient to all His commands, and to worship Him as "very God of very God." Then ctmes the next word, "the Lord Jesus Christ." That will come pver again when I speak of the word "Saviour," so 1 mas on to the follow ing word, "the Lord Jesus Christ-" He is, to all of us who believe, the Anointed One, so anointed that every word that Jecua Christ has spoken is to us infallibly inspired. We beUerHntomL not only ss men say they do to-day; but w* believe ^ ,mJ *«» that which He spoke by His immired apostles. We cannot eepsnte between Christ and the truth He cameto ^ V0lkJl* ***« t* do? r£^fU attempt to do so. He is to ua the „i God, as Prophet, Priest, and King, and we ®?.jj _*ii,offices far which He bears^Sit ,tith rfy uoif UIBi axolntlng; do we not, toy brethren? T know that we do; as brethren in one common faith, we re joice in the common Christ, whose anointing has Mien upon us, too. Though we are but as the Skirts of the garment of our Great High Priest, yet the holy oil upon His head has come down (sen to ua, as it la written, "Ye have an unction from the Sidy One." ralSl "P0?** totter writes, "The Lord 1^. •&**£!* Sonwtiinei in the Bible we "lata yon is bun in the of Darhl ..*..7 whkh H Christ the Lord."
