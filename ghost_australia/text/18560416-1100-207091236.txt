FREEDOM IN FRANCE. Nothing is too great—nothing is too little—for the paternal care of Louis Napoleon. His con sideration for the public welfare is greater than was the anxiety of the fox for the geese. No ribaldry from the press must corrupt his loving suyects, No extravagant notions, opposed to the? general good, must disgrace the public tnfcatre. Even the dead are subject to his bene ficial regulations. And the soul of an offending poet is as carefully guarded as his body. It appears, by late newspapers, that not only is Victor Hugo banished from France; but the managers of all the theatres in that country are prohibited, under pain of penalties, from acting his plays upon the stage ! But this is not all. The "strong government" of France is not only afraid of an absent poet; it trembles at the dead body of an aged woman. The mother of Cau3si dere, the republican, dies. " On the day of her " funeral, the police enter the house of the dead, " and in the gray of the early morning, compel " the corpse to be carried hastily and along bye " ways to final earth. And wherefore ? Why, be " cause it is feared that oratioDs might be made at " the grave of that old woman ; and these speeches " might have been as an arrowy flame directed " against the imperial purple. Hence, strength " of government hurried on the funeral, and " dumbfounded the orators." At present, we are afraid, France has gained but little by her alliance with a free country. How strange, that the power, which is to over throw despotism in the north, shakes and totters at the ghost of a dead republican in the west!
