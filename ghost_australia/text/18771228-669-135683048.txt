Rochester is famous as the place where the Lox sisters startled the world with ghostly sounds. - The ?echoes: of the raps heard in a mysterious cellar in the city of Rochester nearly 30 years; ago have ?.?been1 echoing round the world over since that timo,, and are still:: marching on; , Of course ghostly visitors in Rochester are more demonstrative than they are :in,almost:any other place. ; The ra])s are louder, morci. demonstrative ; and, as the head-quartors of the great army- of spirits is located there,-: the materialisation must of course, be: vvclli- djveloped. ... . ..When I-Ieenan. appeared, therefore, 'on the night ..in: question1 he ? was am uscu lai:, and frisky ghost.

Such duffers as Tom Crib, Tom Sayens, Boridigo, Bill Pool, and 'i-om Tlyor would not under any circumstances allow the. XJenieia Boy to apjiear before a.
