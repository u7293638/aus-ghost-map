LIFE IN THE EAST. By Captain Abmstbong. Chapter XXVI.- (Continued). (JHAPTEU Affray"""' -7 Lieutenant Ebwin was as pleased and delighted as his former kind protector, who swore he would have known him anywhere, and tucking up the sleeve of his shirt, Bill smiled as he beheld the confused and indistinct remains of the anchor he had punctured on the arm "Well, Bill," observed Lieutenant Elwin, " your preservation, after I beheld you knocked on the head and thrown overboard, amazes me " "Faith, sir, I was knocked on the head sure enough, to say nothing of a half a dozen gashes the villains gave me with their knives, but, you see, when knocked overboard, I pitched into one of the press alongside, there were half a dozen dead bodies there already, and they broke my fall. I suppose I was insensible, and did not recover till the villains were pulling off from the burning ship They were pitching the dead bodies overboard, and I was dragged up by the leg, and was on the point of following the others, when I recovered sufficiently to catch the pirate by the throat with such for co-the clutch of death-that they could not separate us for a moment, and then come round shot from the pursuing frigate, dashing the water right over the stern of the prone Why they spared me I don't know, but they did, and, having a wonderfully fast boat, we only out of the five es caped. I saw the Ocean Queen blazing away in the distance, but did not know that the shin pursuing us had sent her boats to her, for seven long years I remained a slave to those pirates, the Misses, but at last an opportunity of escape presented itself. An American gun brig gave chase to a press, I was aboard, but the pros ran away from her. Watching my oppor thirty, I jumped overboard, and escaped the three musket shots and arrows the villains fired at me. It was a wild chance of liberty or death, but I swam on towards the brig, raising my arm and shouting, and when at the last gasp, I was seen and rescued. "I served two years in that brig, and was very well treated. At last we returned to New York, and having received some money for my services, I shipped for England, but misfortunes still pursued means were wrecked on the west coast of Newfoundland in a dense fog "The second mate, myself, and four others only, reached the land, out of a crew of sixteen, and fifty four ill fated passengers, and we only owed our lives to being washed overboard on the foremast " We made our way to Halifax, and there I entered on a seaman aboard the Lord Melville, Falmouth packet, she having lost several of her seamen in her passage out In her I armed at Falmouth, thence went to Plymouth to look after my wife, whom I left there very well and comfortable when I shipped in the Ocean Queen, but she, thinking mo dead, had either married or gone off with a soldier to the Crimea I shipped, shortly after this, in the S-frigate, Captain Gobert, and since we came here I tried to gain some tidings of my wife, but without success So, sir, you see misfortune still attends me, but thank God, you are alive and well, and I hope we shall take this here place, it's cost ing our brave fellows ashore misery and hard- ship enough, while we're lying idle with as fine a fleet as ever sailed upon the ocean " "Patience, Bill," said Erwin, with a smile, " when they come to loggerheads at home, they will let us take this stronghold at present they are wasting their breath m useless negociations at Vienna, and Austria is sending out Ministers with lollypops-thoy are fond of sweets ยก but John Bull will got very angry by and bye, and then he will show his horns in right earnest Now, I want to ask you if you remember off what part of the coast of England you picked me up in the boat " " It wasn't off the English coast, sir, we picked you up, 'was off Bantry Bay, in Ireland. The boat was a fishing punt, and had the name of Thomas Dermot I remember it well roughly painted on its stern, und hurled from Castle Town We had thoughts of running into Bun try Bay, having sprung our main boom, and stood close in for the land, but the weather getting thick we hauled our wind, and in the fog came against the boat you were in The captain, poor Captain Randal-you remember sir, I daresay, kind hearted man as ever lived he took the greatest care of you, wrote down in his book all the particulars of the finding you, for he said you were some gentleman's child, your garments were so neat and fine, and when he got you other clothes in Canton, he locked the others carefully up , but God help us, he and my poor messmates met a miserable death, and I suppose the old ship after burning went to the bottom I remember when you best recovered after coming amongst us, you did nothing but cry after your mother, and you called yourself Eddy Shaw " " Shaw '" exclaimed both his listeners with great surprise "I have no remembrance of that name, Bill, said Lieutenant Elwin. "My Christi m nume Edgar, seemed to stick to my money), but of the name of Shaw I have no remembrance " "I remember it well, sir," said Bill Hours ghan, " because I came from Bantry myself My family hailed from there, and when you said your name was Shaw, I was struck with it, for there's an old and wealthy family called Shaw, that live near Bantu, the Shows of Kilgerr When I first left home I was about seventeen or eighteen, do I remember well all about Ban try and I know when you were picked up, and said your name was Eddy Shaw, I thought of the Shaws o' Kilgerrun, and fancied you might be one of them, and told Captain Randal what I thought, so he put it down in his book, and he intended when he got home to make inquiries, but all was lost in the Ocean Queen " After some further questions and convert tion, very satisfactory to Lieutenant Erwin, Bill Houlaghan was rowed back to his shin, his pocketbook restored, and a munificent present from Lord Courtland, who expressed a wish to have him in his yacht, but under the then exist in circumstances that could not be still considering how very important Bill Ilouloghan'o statement of the picking up at sea of the child the date and year, he. would be, he proposed seeing Captain Gobert, and obtaining the per mission that Bill Houlighan's account of the event should be made before proper witnesses, so that, should any accident occur to Bill, has statement would still be of service to Lieutenant Erwin At the same time Lord Courtland declared he would write to his solicitor, to make inquiries in Bantry about the Shaws of Kilkerran Chapter XXVII. Dtraisa the period that the events in the last chapter were taking place, our fair heroines were waiting at Batoum till they could procure a vessel to take and land them on the coast of Circassia. At length they found a Greek zone, of some eighty or ninety tons, manned by a pa drone and eight Greek sailors The accommodation onboard the noted, considering. the kind of vessel, was tolerably good She was of a light draught of water, usually plying in the Sea of Azof, from Taganrog to Kertch She was then bound to the lastmentioned place, but the commander agreed to land his passengers on the coast of Circassia, near some port It was at this period, early in November, usually a stormy and wild season in the Black Sea, though so far south and east as Batoum and the coast of Circassia, the weather is much less severe than at Sebastopol, or on the coast of the Crimea The little cabin of the note was given upon tirely to the two millions and a young Greek girl Ivan Gortsare had hired to attend on them, and who was quite willing to go into any part of the world with them With a fair wind, such as was then blowing their voyage was not expected to exceed three days The morning they left Batoum was fine and clear, the wind off shore, and the waters consequently smooth The two girls kept on deck regarding the singularly wild but picturesque shore along which they sailed " How very fortunate," said Julia Fitzharding to her beloved companion, " that the forts along this coast were destroyed, or we should never have been able to effect a landing If we fall into the power of your countrymen, Catherine it will be terrible We should be separated from your mother, and heaven only knows when we should see her again She must be in great anxiety about us, now this terrible war has broken out " " I fear, indeed, she is doubly anxious on that account," Catherine Warhondorft replied " How I long to throw myself into her arms after these long years of absence The eight of these lofty mountains with the snow capped summits, reminds me so forcibly of our childhood These are the same mighty mountains that we used, Julia, to gaze upon with so much awe and reverence from our early home ' " I can never look upon mountains, ' remarked Julia, " without a feeling of reverence and awe They always strikers powerfully" Towards evening the breeze freshened, and the sky became overcast Ivan had been very curious during the day, and observing that the Greek padiono kept further off the land as the night came on, he demanded the reason " Why," said the captain, " you said you did not wish to meet any Russian vessels of war Soukuni Kalch is still in their hands, and I know they have a war steamer and two bags cruising off the coast, and they would overhaul me if seen I fear nothing, if you don't ' Ivan Gortsaro made no answer, but he did not like the man's manner, it was not so humble and obsequious as before leaving By team He know well the Greeks are never to be trusted He was also surprised to hear that Soukum Kalch was still in the possession of Russia for he believed that the three fortresses of Soukum Kaleh, Sotcha, and houses, were either destroyed or abandoned, and that Anapa alone remained capable of defence He did not retire to his couch till very late and was awoke early in the morning by a considerable bustle on deck. The two girls were also aroused, and almost immediately afterwards the loud boom of a cannon caused them to spring from their berths, and hastily attire themselves Gortearo was on deck first It was daylight and quite calm Not three miles from them lay two vessels, distant from each other about a mile or so The scene was lying motionless upon the water, and all her crew were congregated in her bows, anxiously observing the two vessels "What is the matter ?" demanded Gortsuro "Why do you regard those two vessels so, and what was the gun fired for "Don't you see that ship on the starboard bow ' She is an English corvette, ' said the Greek patrons, " and the other is a Russian man of war brig I know her she belongs to Sotcha, and carries eighteen guns, and is full of men She fired the gun, and hoisted Russian colors I hope she will take that English corvette " ' Why do you hope that asked his companion ' Vi eil, returned the padrone, " I mu) veil turn to tell you now After I find you, I am bound to Anapa, with articles that are contraband of war, for the Russians If that is a gash corvettes were to overhaul us, he would seize vessel and cargo us a prize " Ivan had suspected something of the sort but as long as they landed him and his fun charges, he could not be injured by their nefarious traffic The men were now very busy getting out hugo sweeps to urge the zero onwards, and in the direction of the shore, which was about three leagues distant Just then the young ladies came on deck, and looked anxiously around them But the moment the Princess eyes res ed upon the English corvette, she caught Julia by the arm exclaiming Oh' Julia that is the Medora My heart tells me it is Julia turned round with a start and an exclamation of intense joy and looking eagerly at the hip, which was h ng with her broadside to ware's whom, he acted- The Medora, Yes, thank God that he is here Iv 11 God there was stand up near and on hearing the name of the Medora, remained fixed to the deck He was rather near sighted, and did not make out the icshI as distinctly as the ship keen sight of the girls, but there she undoubtedly was, lying gracefully) upon the slumbering ocean under topgallant sails, and only a mile or so from her formidable antagonist -the Russian brig Idisoovor mounting eighteen eight pounders, and onohunurcd and ten men With the patron's glass, linen fortune readily recognised the Medora ' She will surely," he exclaimed, never attempt a contest with the Russian ' CutLcinie heard those words and for the first time looked at the Russian brig,, turning pale as she did so It was not a larger vessel to look at than the Medora, and both girls turned to Gortsaro, anxiously asking him why he seemed to four that the Russian bug would be too much for the night, if they did engage He was evidently ounces), but merely replied, 1 In the first place she is a vessel of war, heavily) armed, and full of men The Medora is only a yacht, certainly well armed, and no doubt with a gallant crow, but the odds are too great One thing is certain, the yacht can run from his antagonist when she likes." "Ah," said the Princess, emphatically, that Henry Fitzharding will never do." " No," responded Julia, with a flushed cheek and a flashing eye, " the Medora will never owes her safety to flight. My brother will fight her to the last " "You are Fitzharding's orator, no doubt of that," said Gortsaro, looking at the high-spirited girl with a serious expression of countenance During this short dialogue the sence, under four heavy sweeps, was beginning to gather way, and the Greek padrone called their attention to the Russian brig by observing, " She has caught a breeze, and is closing fast upon the English corvette " As he spoke a wreath of smoke burst out from the side of the brig, and the roar of her cannon pealed over the deep All eyes became fixed upon the Medora, whose guns us yet breathed no defiance to her foot Catherine Warhcndorff hardly breathed, so intensely did she feel, but watched the Medora with a boat- ing heart 'thy graceful yacht caught the breeze her yards were braced sharp up, and crossing the bows of the Russian brig, she poured a well directed broadside into her, bringing down her fore-topmast with all it hampor upon her deck. She appeared to create a slight confusion amongst the crew of the Russian vessel, though she returned the fire, as the Medora stood on the same tack the breeze freshening As she sailed on she passed within a quarter of a mile of the zones, only then just catching the breeze At that instant some of the crew of the meteor caught sight of the smoke of a steamer coming out from the land 'The padrone declared it was the war vessel belonging to Soukum Kuleh "This is a small steamer," he remarked, " but she carries four heavy guns " " Good heavens '" exclaimed Julia in a low voice to Catherine, " this will be fearful odds against the Medora, she may now fairly withdraw from the contest " But the Medora seemed to have no such intention, for having repaired some damage to her rigging, she tacked, and this time pulled so close to the women, who had caught the wind, and payed out to the westward, that those on board must evidently have recognised the ladies, for a loud cheer saluted their ears, and the agitated girls behold a man spring upon the bulwarks and wave his hat in the and the padrone of the notes thou sand " That vessel is not a man of war, what can she be ?" addressing Iv in Gortsaro " who is an English yacht," answered the Russian, but it seems she is quite enough for the brig " Both vessels again crossed each other, at five launch in yards, and both poured in a broadside What effect the Russian discharge had upon the Medora, those in the notes could not see, but one of her sails or masts appeared injured, while the broadside of the Modern completely crippled her antagonist, bringing down her foremast altogether But the meteor was rapidly widening her distance, setting all the sail she had to a strong westerly breeze The girls, with cugcrand anxious hearts, kept their eyes on the Medora, which, leaving her crippled but still formidable antagonist lying, clearing away the wreck of her mast and yards, was evidently preparing to receive the steamer, which was rapidly closing with her coming out from the storms between the acts and the yacht Deeply us they deplored the course taken by the seven, neither they nor Ivan Uortsuro could alter it The padrone was anxious to get away, until Gortauro himself felt rather Homrous of leading both the yacht and the Russian war vessels. They were now nearly four miles away, when a fresh cannonade between the Medora and the steamer took place This continued nearly as long as they kept in sight, but the breeze became very fresh, and a thick mist came suddenly on, which had the vessels from all on board the noted "Oh this is dreadful' observed Catherine to Julio in a desponding tone, " we are left in a fearful uncertainty as to the fate of the Medora What can she do against a war stir over -"' " Oh, much may be done, dear Cuthcrmo, with the court of and energy Heim possess b, ii steamer may be crippled, you know My) brother came out into this box were prepared for anything that might occur, and I feel satisfied he would not wait for this steamer to come up with him if he had not good hopes and expectations of doubting her " "You are a dear, good soul, Julia ; you it was keep up my Hugging spirits I never knew your cour also fail, under all our li sale, but once " 1 Ah," said Julia, "I was overpowered their, I confess, whilst on the voyage from Gibraltar to Constantinople I am way a expected at all events, 1 hoped- thatBomo event, some unlooked for cause, would lead to a discovery of the wo wore, that Ltun Gortsuio might relent or alter his vious, and permit tina ardently wished for discovery to take place , but no such an out happened , so that, when we parted at Constantinople without scarcely a shadow of hope no man ing my heart sank, I confes, and despair seized me for the moment But listen ' Hark ' I do not hear any more firing " continued John, " God said Henry itw\ disable the stop mer ; if so, he will follow us " " iii and if she disable him," said the princess in a despairing tone, " what will become of him and used Alas' misfortune seems to pursue us still " "say not so, dear Catherine," answered Ju'iu, throwing her arms round her iuchJ'b neck , I have every hope and confi came in the bravery and skill of Henry Recollect, if the electors is only a yacht, Henry is a thorough seaman, accustomed to pin) and has faced worse odds and overcome them Mr Bernard, also, is an old and tried seaman, and almost all the men on board an old man of war's men, and would Adit to the last, both for the honor and glory of thou Fair, as well as from love to their com- murder Ah' Cuthennc, always hope Does no Kozlay says-We are born in hope, we pass our childhood in hope, hope governs our whole existence, and not till the beating of the bom t shall cease, will its benign influence leave us Culhormo Balled sadly as Gortsuio joined them, saying- ' How very singular this strange meeting with the Medora , I trust she may got away from her antagonist Sho completely crippled the brig, her metal is evidently heavier She may do so to the steamer ยก our patrons eiivB she is but a poor sailor, though her guns are heavy " " Would it not," asked the young Princess, " have been practicable to have contained, and witnessed how the contest ended We are in a dreadful state of uncertainty Mr. Fitzharding evidently recognised as with his glasses, at tracted no doubt by scoring females on board this leteo." " That he recognised you, I have no doubt answered Ivan thoughtfully, " and that he would have boarded us had we remained, and succeeded in beating off his antagonists, butthopidrono, I am sorry to say, is not to be depended on He is a kind of contrabandist-canying to Anapa goods which, if found in the noted by English or French cruisers, would 'lose him his craft and his cargo I did not know this when I engaged him, but I suspected it yesterday, hearing some words between him and one of his crew " "But are you sure," inquired Ciithouuo War Heindorff, " that he will fulfil his contract, and land us where he agreed ?" " I trust he will," said Gortsaio thoughtfully, , " if he refuses, I regret to say we are in his power " & The girls looked very serious, but, he o thou companion, they saw no way of compelling the Greek to fulfil his contract Towards sunset the mist cleared off, and all looked back in the direction where they supposed the contest to have taken place One vessel only was to be seen-a lof y rigged ship, carrying royals Catherine Wuihoudoril a and Julia Fitzhardings hearts bout with increased hope lins vessel was following in their work , it must be the Medora It was certainly not a steamer, and the Russian vessel could not carry royals after the damage she had received The Greek voice, like almost all those vessels, was an extraordinary fast craft, and the patrons, who suspected the vessel following was the English yacht, carried every stitch of canvass he could With anxious hearts, us the gloom of night came on, and the mist again spreading times over the deep the maidens road ed to then berths, not to sleep, in truth, for their thoughts were too busy), and their minds too anxious concerning the morrow As the claim made, Gortsaro hurried on deck -the horizon was clear, and he saw at a glance that the Greek spacious intended to betray him, for right before them was Anson, and right astern was the Medora, then within two miles of them. Ivan Gortsaro was now exceedingly perplexed He discovered, when too late, that a crooked policy will not always succeed His wavering botweoniiLjht and wrong had now, he foaled, brought trouble on them all, and, in the end, most probably d feet all his projects He looked at the Medora, which, under colour of canvass, was tearing through the water He looked at the hotel, she was flying through the white crested waves carrying more canvas than she evidently well could bear, for it tunes also buried her sharp bows in the seas, and trembled under the pleasure of her canvas The Greek captain and his cr w were most anxiously watching the coming up of thol'ng hell Yacht, and certainly, if they had had six or seven more miles to run, they must be ever taken ; but him Gol t cure saw the port, ramparts, and forts of Anupu, much nearer than that, and he felt convinced the port would be guided long before the Medora could come up As he watched the ) right, a wreath of smoke curled out from her bows, and then the loud boom of her Bhotless gun pealed over the deep "Hall said Ivan Gortsaro, they despair of overtaking us, so much the better At present it would not do " He then walked over to the Greek, who Booraod pleased and said-" She cannot overtake us now, signor " " You have broken your contract, and will put me to inconvenience," said Ivan, angrily, to the Greek captain , " you are running into Anapa " I am," replied the Creole, TrliUfc also said I do" You don't know your own mind, you said last night that you did not wish that Fug half yacht to overt like us Had I attempted to make a landing on the coast with this wind and sea it would be dangerous, in fact scarcely possible, and I should have been overtaken by that yacht, who must have some government officers in her, or who pursue mc p You can probably tell me the reason " Gortsaro certainly could he did not wish to be overtaken by the Medora, for that would do but the plans ugi cod on by the Circassian chiefs -not that he entertained the slightest doubts about out here not fulfill the conditions to quirEd for the liberation of the princess and the two girls, but it would prove to to this that he himself had outstepped the hunts of his in structions, and that in his Ruxton) to undo the mischief he had formerly actor died, he had, in fact, partly broken his oath and saith to the chiefs, hothcrcfoio did not wish to be overtaken by the Medora The delay at Batoum, and the Midorus being forced so much to the eastward by the terrible storm that raged after her depur turn from Bulucluvu, had led to their strange meeting Catherine and Julia were both caused by the young Greek attendant, with the intelligence that the relish ship was following them " Oh, thank God odd lined both, standing up with their hearts beating with joy and no new ed hope "Then the Medora," continued Julia, "has beaten all her foes, and Han), dour Hurry, is safe and well, or she would not be following us " In less than ten minutes they were on deck, and their gaze a tenth le ted on the Medora, which, under every stitch of crime insoluble, was overhauling filling fast, she was not two miles listen, but the part of Vnapa was within a mile of them, its foils bustling with fuss ' Goodness ' exclaimed Catherine, we are running into a harbor with the Russian flag flying over the forts Oh, Julia' this he Vnnpa, do you not remember it? Took, there is the very mole flora who co who stepped on board the steamer when we left Circnssin " Gortsaio now approached there he looked very) anxious and unas) I suppose," he remarked, ' 10in both reasons for first place, but no one here will recognise either of yOU, this rascally Greek has betrayed his trust, but I pray you have no fear, for I have the means of defeating,' this unexpected event His b) St Ivan, the Lower House has opened fire upon the Medora" and, and ushoepokotho words, the loud roar of the cannon from the outer fort, echoed from the lofty ones along the rocky shore All eyes were upon the Medora, which gives full) bore up in the wind , as a second and third gun was fired, they could see the main royal and its mast knocked into the air, and full, but still the by adit pa) ed away on the other tuck without firing shot- which would, indeed, have been a useless bravado, the English ensign floated out bolJl) from her work, as gun after gun was in ed without effect the mole and quays were crowded with eager gazers, wondering at the single Iufehsh ship approaching so daringly) from the forts for us far as those could distinguish, not another such was in sight There was not a single armed vessel at that time in port-two large steamers having sailed three days previously for Eortah and Taganrog. There was no time for conversation or coffee tion upon their situation, for the meteor ran in and anchored within the piers. CHAPTER XXVIII. Tkk meteor find scarcely swung to her anchors when a custom-house boat, with two officers of the customs and an individual in military attire, pulled up alongside. The officers and the Greek patrons in mediately entered into an animated conversation while the military mdmduul walked up to Ivan Gortsaie, who was alone upon dock. After looking at him from head to foot, he said in rather an imperious tone" A passenger I suppose '" " My daughters, an attendant, and myself are passengers in this vessel," returned Ivan Goff- safe "You are Russians wind of ore your passport ?>, and what is you business in this piece ?" Gortsaro had expected those questions, and he tilling a huge, clasped pocket book from his post, he opened it and selected a folded clean, and without a word handed it to the government officer, who, sounding the first few lines, turned the page, looked at the signature, and then uttered an exclamation of surprise , but he gave back the document, saying "When you and your family are settled on shore, you will have to attend at the ooininnmluut'b. Where are you ordered to in this quarter '" "It was not my intention to land here," said Gortsore " My mission is amongst the Cir- cassias ; i intended to penetrate into the war district, under the guise of an Armenian merchant " "Whutiesaol was that pursued you to the entrance of the harbor, and so audaciously by Naval the guns of our forts ? It is not a vessel of war, for we could see with our glasses that her complement of men is small and she does not carry a pennant." " I fancy she is an English yacht " "A yacht '" exclaimed the Russian officer in exceeding surprise, and curling his long, bushy, grizzly moustachios. " St Ivan ' n yacht in the Black Sea in winter, and in time of war, those islanders are beauties in some things. But why did she pursue this zo co'" "I do not know that she pushed the notes," said line Gortsuio. Just then the two i custom house officers come up, and added sing the Government official, said, " Only think, Captain iรบckouioff, that Jiiighsh vessel is a pleasure yacht, and had its ally the audacity, the hardihood, to attack the Czar's 16 gun brig, and, tina Greek patrons says, completely applied for , he says too that the steamer from Soukum Knleh must have engaged her, for he saw her coming out, but a mist prevented his witnessing the result." " The result '" reported Captain Kiekomofl, in a Mixed and passionate tone "Did we not see the yacht uninjured. Here is some decep- tion , she must be a sloop of war, and lima hour men concealed, and is reconnoitring this port. lliOBO cursed islanders will get a hot reception if they come here " " Where do you intend to put up?" inquired the captain, turning to him Gortauro. "Are you acquainted with the town of The person addressed hesitated a moment, and then said, "I have been here before. I shall put up at the Hotel of the Grand Duke Constantine." "Very well," remarked Captain Eiokomofl, and entering the boat with the Custom-house officers, pulled away from the motor. " So far," muttered shortage, worry safe " In less than an hour, he and his two supposed daughters were comfortably established in the hotel, which, standing on a rising ground, over' looked the harbor, the two forts, and the wide expanse of water beyond. "It seems, dour Cuthouno," observed Julia Fitzharding, as they sat in the wall Stood chamber of the hotel, gazing over the dark waters of the Euxine, "that we are likely to escape the danger apprehended from our being obliged to enter a Russian garrison town " " The document t, constituting him a secret agent," Sophie Catherine, " has saved us from suspicion at present, but, still, holds only been questioned by a subordinate officer. Suppose the Governor or Commandant of this place should take it into his head, before we are able to leave, to examine Ivan more strictly, and request to see his letter of instruction, appointing him a mission amongst the Circassian, no would be puzzled what to say; awaken only a brass iron, and we should surely be discovered not to be his daughters Our situation, I think, is perilous." Ivan Gortsnro, when he returned from a visit to the Commandant's, o messenger having been sent, ordering him to go there, looked pale, and his manner was agitated. " You look vexed, Ivan," remarked Cuthouno, kindly, "find any thing unpleasant occurred at the Commandant's?" "I cannot conceal it from you, Princess," said the Russian, lady seriously ; who always, when by themselves, Btylod Catherine Wnrlion dorll-Piinccsa " What has occurred, then-does the Commandant suspect anything wrong ?" "No, madam, no, but, though you were too young, to remember him, this Governor of Anupa remembered mc instant I confess I was on founded when I beheld him, he hesitantly voiced at the general's place in St. Petersburg, and was one of the general's aide de camps in his lust camping!! in Giriussia " "Who is he, in a" naked Either mo War horrors, rather startled.

Such, however, was the fact, Bird Gort- says, " but your mother spurred his offers and proposals, and I believe from that time, he be made a bitter enemy, and secretly was a spy upon all your lamented father's transactions in the Caucasus " Button is," interrupted Julie Fitzhardinge, who had listened anxiously, " what passed in your interview with Count Alexander Zou books." "I will do so," answered Ivan. When I received the summons, I proceeded to the Commandant's house, unfortunately without asking who he was-if I had, I should not have been taken so much by surprise I was shown into a saloon where, sitting at a table, with wine and refreshments on it, was a tall, powerful looking man He lifted up his head and with a start and no doubt a change of color, I beheld Count Alexander Zouboski " " ' He exclaimed the Count, looking at me, evidently) as surprised as myself, ' what is it you, turn Goitsure? How is this? I understand from some one I saw lately, that you were employed in England, and here you are, and I understand with two charming, beautiful daughters You are a widower, I suppose, as I have not heard that you brought a wife with you " Both Catherine and Julia colored to the temples " The Count looked at me keenly as he spoke.
