THE CYCLOfiAMjL The management at this well-known and popu lar pleasure resort, opposite the Redfern Railway Station, is always well to the front in providing fresh novelties for patrons, consequently at this Christmas season a bis U*t is offered, and most, despite all counter attractions, form a decided draw. Some of the special featurea of the bill are as follow: Extraordinary transformations, the Daylight Ghost, the Mysterious Caldron, the Topsy-turvy Chamber, the Mystics, the Lady Blown to Atoms, and the cinematograph. Throughout the day and night explanatory lec tures of the great picture, Jerusalem, are given, and visitors are invited to a new hall adjoining the Cyclorama, where the most bewildering trans formations and iliustion* are shown. It is a Us show, and well worth patronising.
