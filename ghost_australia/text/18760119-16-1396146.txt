OUR LONDON LETTER. [FROM OUR OWN CORRESPONDENT.] November 20, 1875. THE CUE IT FOODS AND Turill RESULTS IUL long and heavy subscription lists in the London papers will give you some faint notion of the extent of the calamitous floods from which we have been recently suffering in different parts of the country It seems curious (as is, indeed admitted even by engineering authorities that an old settled land like this which, for so many centuries has had the benefit of local government, should have been left exposed to a form of destruction such as we only look for in portions of the earth but recently reclaimed from the hands of nature Nevertheless, the fact remains, that in many parts of England there has been a destruction of property exceed- ing that which, within living memory), back over occurred before from a sudden cause On the Upper 1 barnes, and especially on the sea them into, hundreds of people have been washed out of their holdings At 'W moser, and Eton, and the surrounding neighborhood, the cellars and ground floors of all the lower lying tenements have been deluged, and much distress and disease have resulted Not has propose) still nearer the capital escaped I took a walk last Sunday through 1 Giblin I fields and the adjacent market gardens, and came upon a 1 inevitable Eight Although the flood in this suburb had considerably subsided, one vast sheet of water lay upon the entire landscape, admitting only of people picking their way along the more elevated yet cut up and greatly damaged roadways, just emerged. from the outspread like In some fluids all the crops of vegetables were covered by it in two to three feet of water, and in others, orchard trees in thousands looked as if trying to live (black and leafless as they were, in the night of a deluge, the extent of which the eye filled to grasp there can be no doubt that much of this wretched state of things is life but able to the now 'I haines cab instant be tween Blackfriars Bridge and the Houses of Parliament The ni cry of the river on the northern bank is so much contracted by this other Av leo noble w o k, that the escape of w enter on an ebb tide is disastrously) impeded at periods when the tides are higher than usual It is a new illustration of Horses vigorous words ' a matter am capellas fruits lamen attitude seemed - though } oil may arise out alone with a pitch for k, she will nevertheless c and b test on ) on and, as Nature made, in the long ages gone by), this t iv II bed for herself, she does not care so to he summarily (ejected by a lot of pick and shin el non, laid on even by eminent engineers Public meetings and deputations to Bounds of Works have been the order of the day, and the best opinions non incline to giving the southern side of the river an cubical ment as well as the northern But even this BULC,OSIIOII diavvsdonn protests- from many even of the dum aged p ii ties His what finger s, as he may be counted by hundreds along that bank even as far as from Lambeth Palace the Prime) Budge, tremble at the impending, distills men in their business, and insist on being saved from these parade in deluges in billie other way) He) will insist on bricks without straw, and think that local Bom ds are cut into the) task proposed to them In the midst of the discussions, j to possess, and protests, a loss controller, in the shape of aiiastioiionneil correspondent of The I Times, BlnkcH in with prediction lb it, inasmuch as on the 15th of next month the moon will be one area to the cavill than she has been for many years it will only require a westerly wind at the same time to bring upon us a fine voice sounds tion than any we have yet known As nothing effectual can be done in the ineiiiwliilu, no must of course take what comes and make the best of it and MCI as MR value ning from our own to move distant and still gives troubles, UIIIILH on the CollllllLIlt have anything, but a cheering aspect telegrams and letters of speen!

(November 2 two men, David Jeroilaw and Joseph Golding, partners in business in Dehmcoy Street, New York, quarrelled about a business matter, and locked themselves up in a small room, about 10 by 15 feet, to settle their altercation with pistols Each had a seven chambered revolver, and they fired at each other several times The police hearing the shots demanded admittance, and upon receiving no reply broke open the door. They found Golding lying on the Door dead, with the revolver in his hand, three chambers being emptied Jeroslavv was also lying on the floor with his revolver clenched in his hand. He was evidently dying Five chambers of his revolver had been discharged Jeroslavv was removed to Bellevue Hospital in an ambulance, but died while on the way.
