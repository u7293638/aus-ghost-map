A GIIOST THAT DID NOT '"FIZZ." The London Spectator publishes a letter from "A Galloway Man," who teolls the fol lowing story :-A little knot of townsmen were wont to prolong their drinking.bouto, and when there was no law closing public houses at II p.m. in Scotland, these edlerauts extoeded not seldom far on into the morning hours. To try to check the doings of the topers on one occasion at the hour when Ihe couple of candles had nearly expended (there was no gasin our town in those days) a spectre of human build, but robedin white and carry. ing a lantern under the enveloping sheet so as to prod:co a diffused red light, stalked solemnly into the gloomy room, and stopped in what was hoped would bea terror-stricken silence. As gravely as if he rose to meet some mourner, one of the tipsy crew stood upon his feet. Forming a bubble of saliva on his lip, he poised it on the tip of his middle finger, projecting it towards the supposed emissary of terror in a way that most boys un'erstand and occasionally practise when in vulgareet mood. The swaying drunkard shot the moisture hard at the glimmering sheet and figure, with the one remark Scottice, "Ye're a gude while eet, or ye' l have fizzed." There is no use adding that the little plot was a failure.
