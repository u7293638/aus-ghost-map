THE VICTORIAN AMATEUR TURF CLUB MEETING. I From our Special Correspondent.! [By Telegraph.] Melbourne, March 12. At Caulfield on Saturday afternoon there is bound .to be some good sport. The Oak leigh Handicap will be the great event of the day, and for this I expect to see a large field. Mr. Barnard commenced with Malua at 10 st. 2 lb., and gave Fryingp&n; the same weight, but neither will start, and as Blink Bonney bad quite her share at 9 St. 6 lb., she will repair to the stable. On paper Xantippe, St. Lawrence, Gymkhana, and The Ghost look best. The Steeplechase may go to Tand sticker or Deceiver, and for the South Yarra Handicap Meteor, Miles, and Country Boy look best. There is no betting. The following horses are left in the V.A.T.C. Races to be run on Saturday Criterion Stakes.—Lady Claudia, Melo dious, First Prince, Arsenal, Merenda.
