The Headington Hill Flock. TO THE EDITOR OF THE QUEENSLANDER. SIR,—It is gratifying to some of us old sheep men to hear of the Hon. Mr. Perkins's just and graceful tribute of praise paid to the memory of the late Mr. Davenport. Reading a few weeks ago your description of the Headington Hill flocks, without mention being made of the head manager who selected tho country and planned the improvements that have so greatly contributed to bring the "Fisher Hocks" to the perfection they have attained in Queensland, was like feuding of Labnn's flocks with Jacob left out, or of the battle of Waterloo without the Duke of Wel lington and Napoleon. The late Mr. George Davenport and his successful land-selecting forms a portion of Queensland history ; his extensive farming operations and artificial feed ing of stock have long since been described. If Mr. Davenport lived now, probably he would be one of the first extensive stockowners to prove the value of the silo system in preserving fodder, because he was always ready to adopt and to explain the best means of improvement adapted to the land and the climate, and to the animals depending upon his active manage ment. Mr. Davenport's system of extensive farming and production of artificial food for stock ciin and will be carried out to an immense extent in time to come, upon the large expanses of the Darling Downs. I once sold a flock of wethers to Mr. Daven port, and meeting him some considerable time nftov the Rale I inquired how they hod turned out. The reply w;w, "Very well, but I think some of their ghosts arc haunting my paddocks still." The fact was a few .if the *hcop being aged did not fatten readily, and this was his cheery way of expressing himself.
