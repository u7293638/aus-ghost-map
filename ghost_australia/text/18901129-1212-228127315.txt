J[ i , Both were enveloped m long loosecloaks, that completely hid their forms • the smjifler and the yoilinger looking of the twd had the hood dj-awn over her jhead, buc the other wore a neat close-fitting bonnet, "which made her round comely face apj^ear rounder and , rosier. ! 1 '^Miss Hilda, deajt, sure and it's cold for tou to be out hepe. Come along in, my dearie, where there's a warm firj; aud nice hot tea awaitinjg you,' she said eoaxingly, and laid a firpi but kinllly hand on her companion's ar^i. j j The girl lifted her bowed h!ead, disclosing a face perfectly [iiovelv in its delicate fragile pallor ; sgre at violet-bued eyes gleamed from beaeajfli long dark lashes, and soft tendrils ôr purq golden i hair, escaping from the velvet fur^edged hood, fell in pretty disorder upon her snowy brow. ! ! She did not look at the woman, only at the leafless trees—covered now by a fine white powder—aud ijhe distant range of grey mountains, whpse tops, ]were Ijarelr visible through the haze rapidly enfolding them.

A little later, in the handsome dining hall, two peuphf were standing in clos 1 converse ; L6rd Sylvester, the youn^ master of Eagle's Cliff, and bis mother, ; till nobe' looking woman, witli fine regu lar features, and skin of alabaster white ness. ! Her eyes—piercing eyes they -. were, of darkest grey—Vested thoughtfully ujjoil the fire ; lier face wore an expression of subdued sorrow'—of patient suffering.

' Ten long years have we been absent now—time enougli, to forget : but the instant 1 crossed the 1 threshold of this place I felt; all the oldj horror—all tbe tigouy return.' ' Poor mothejr !' the man answered,) looking at her with a gentle compassion^ ' If I bad known past memories wouldi rise up from tliKr graves, I would not! have enireated you to come home, f ami sorry, now, we ciame.' Ladv Sylvester forcod a vogue sinile to her lips, and her eyes met bis lov ingly. [ ' You are a good boy, Maurice, and I am glad, for vour sake, I yielded.

The door had opened quietly, and a pirl, voung, fair, and dazzfingly She looked at them au instant beauti ful, stood on the threshold- wonderingly, and then a light laugh rippled over her rosy lips, an|l she moved gracefully forward. j ' How solemn !you both soém Î' she said with a merry pout, living her hands oil her mother's chill ones. ' What terrible scheme have y«u been plotting ? I might hare been a ghost, you appeared «o scared. ' You are not pnlike one in that white thing,' Maurice answered. ' Turn round, sprite, and let me get a good view of you.' i [; The girl lauglied again, hut turned slowlv| round, giving jfier mother time to recover from her nervous start. It was the same sweet face yrhieh had appeared at the carriage-window, only much softer and brighter now, in its frame of golden hair. Her dress, of snojwy clinging silk, was cut low at the shapely throat, rerealing the milk- white skin ;[ the short sleeves left the prettv arms bare to the elbow. last. You {look very well,' Maurice said at '"I only ho^ie Eagle's Cliff will not disagree Iwith jou.' As if it would !' she answered acornfullr. ' I adore the old place, and ball never be j happy until I hare thoroughly ransacked every nook and corner. « >4 ' ' ' - ! Lady Sjl rester started and her eyes grew dark with . whe old haunting look. She had been . pale before, but now an ashen hue overspread fièrcheek ; even her lips became livid. Clasping ' j i , ' * .

' There are some parts quite unsafe for any ione to enter, sad it would make me ill to know you were running in danger. IPromise, Cicely.' Cicely Beemed surprised at her mother's vehemence, but [gave tbe desired promise. Further conveisation was put to an end by the entrance of the butler with the soup. ' By the way, when did Blair say he was coming ?';Maurice asked later, as they at alone )at dessert. 'This week ?' -Cicely coloured J and her eyes drooped shyly.
