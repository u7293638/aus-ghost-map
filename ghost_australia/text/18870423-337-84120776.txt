CHESS. " Savoir la Marche est chote trhs unle t Jouer le Jeu, c*est le fruit du Genie, ROUSSEAU-" Epitre k Marot." I see that the Chess Championship gold medal of the Brisbane Chess Club has been awarded to Julius Jacobsen, who I believe was a county cheBs champion in England before he earne out to Queensland a few years back. Jacobsen won both the Chess- Tourna ment and handicap matches, but only accepted the prize for the former. The tournament dragged out to a tedious length, all the games not being finished by competitors who saw they had no-cltfMi$e of victory, and a dead feeling of apathy has since benumbed the Chess Club, which looks like giving up its living ghost at this, its first crisis. The attendance at the club meetings is now inyariably small. It is to be regretted that Brisbane chess players, who are really quite a numerous body, do not exert themselves to organise a living club. There should be no difficulty, by co-operation, in providing a club room to be set apart for indulgence in this intellectual pastime, and if players would only evince individual interest in the movement, a strong find influential club could soon be formed. The gold medal presented to Jacobsen is a pretty trinket of chaste and elegant design. The medal is heart-shaped and environed by a prettily worked solid ring. The obverse bears the inscription: " Julius Jacobsen, Chess Championship, Brisbane Chess Club; President, Mr. Justice Mein." On the reverse is a very pretty design of ; a chewb^rd. The medal is the workmanship of 3Â£. Beal, a private goldsmith. So lax has become the interest of members of the Brisbane Chess Club, that no formal club presentation was made of the medal, which was handed to the winnep privately by orde^ of $10, ?ub committee.
