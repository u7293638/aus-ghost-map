CLARENCE RIVER JOCKEY CLUB'S ANNUAL I MEET, 1871.. . I Dnvirn.EBs ono of the principnt reasons which con- tributed to tho large compnny being present on Thurs- day nnd Fridny last, July 20th and 21st, nt tho Clarence River Jockey Club's meet, 1871, was tho fact thut it followed in closo proximity to the Agricultural Society's Show, nnd thus induced many of the visitors who came to town ostensibly to be present at tho latter to patronise tho former, and to others, enabling them to " KUI two birds with one stine," as thc adage runs. However, the interest manifested by the general publio in this year's meet, «ns not diminished in the slightest degreo from that of former years. The various routes to the course-more particularly those »iii Doblo and Pound streets-on both days were scenes of bewilder- ing excitement nnd bustle, contrasted to the usual monotonous routine of ordinary daily traffic ; these lines of routo were traversed by horsemen, pedes- trians buggies, and other vehicles, shrouded in clouds of dun, an accompaniment to their progress io tho course-an unpleasant, though natural concomitant to thedry weather experienced of late. The weather was delightfully fine on both days, very pleasant in its efTects in more than one respect, chiefly, of course, the success cf the meet and also its hygeinn properties combined with that exercise inieparably connected with riding, were apparent to the most superficial observer tn tho rosy lint it imprinted on the cheeks of I the many blooming maidens present. The usual number of publicans' booths and fruiterers' stalls, and a larger number of the " Pop it down Gent's 1 " tables, tonk up their positions on tho course with the some object-doiog business. Tho " Pop it down Gents ! " fraternity were vicing one with the other in ceaseless ((clamour upon the fairness and certainty with which ¿hey showered tho "gifts of Fortune on all who were alive to their fjVn interest«, and practically cxejft I pliBed this trait of character by liberally patronising' [them. That much abused lady "Aunt Sally".; also figured conspicuously in her tawdry habiliments. The police, under the superintendence of Mr. Sub Inspector WJIIOHT, were active "and vigilant in the performance of their duties, which we are happy to soy were not onëfbus. The good order that prevailed and the absence of\ intoxication on both dnys¿ characteristics of our annual race meets, being hot less thnrt usual.
