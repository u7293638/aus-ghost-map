HT0MESOF A CATAND AHEN. Mus. A . W. Brooks, of East Eliot, in the State of Maine, has a cat 13 years old, for which she has been vainly offered $50. This learned pussy will stand up at the word of command, bow slowly or quickly as directed, walk around the room 011 her hind legs only, dance, turn somersaults,*go through the motions of holding a jewsharp in her mouth with one paw and playing on it with the other, mew when ordered to speak, kiss her paw to visitors, hold a saucer of milk on her forelegs, and lap the milk, and stand 011 her hind feet, and will; her forepaws catch bits of bread or meat thrown to her, like a base-ball player. Her kitten, a year old, will turn somersaults. The same lady has a hen which always wipes her feet on the mat on entering the house, and if asked, 41 How do you get your living, biddy?" will scratch on the floor, look to see if she has scratched out anything, and then look at the questioner to sec if the answer is correct. This hen despises the wooden, chalk, and porcelain cheats which some people palm off 011 hens for nest eggs, tumbling them out of her nest as often as they are put in.— American Paper.

For thee is spread Its soft, purple cmerlet; Moth, art thou sped ? —Dint as a ghost he flies Through the night mysteries." —Miss Hutchinson.
