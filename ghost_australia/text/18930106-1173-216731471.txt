A TALK WlT H ^l DIVER, " I'M no\ going to tell you about ghosts nder water,-corpses sittiug upright in the tate-rooms of steamers, with books on their ' nees, as if they had been reading when hey were drowned, because I haven't seen uch. Nor has any other diver. You can't ee anything in a sunken vessel. If anyone ells you such stories he's not a diver— xcept that he dives away from the truth." " Is there any skill required in the act of Uvitfg—I mean getting down to the object on twbich you a re to work !"'

The dress weighs a diver his shoes weigh twenty pounds eitv 'Then he has on his chest and back weight's ot pounds each.* In addition to this, the helinet aud collar are heavy. The dress consists of. two layers of duck with a layer of rubber between them. To the top part of the dress a collar of copper is affixed, and to this>the helmet is firmly screwed after it has been placed over the diver's head. . The helmet: is large enough to allow a. space of three inches around the • head, . and there are , three tubes through which the air reaches the interior of the jhelmet.. Before the diver goes down, a weighted line is sunk to the spot he is t6 reach below. The life line is tied around his waist, and to his helmet is attached the hosa through which the air is pumped inco-they helmet.. The diver goes down the weighted line, the hose and the life line being runout As he descends. As he moves about below* those above must regulate the life line and hose, and should be ready, to pull him up as soon as they get the signal—a sharp tug at) the line. Some people fancy there's a rushing sound, or a noise like thunder^ made by tlie air passing from the hose into the Tiel; met. But that's nonsense. . You don't heajp any sound except the strokes of the pumpi "If those above are watchful for any danger signal, and, when they get the signal, haul tbe diver up promptly, do they usually land^bimsafe atidsound ?" < '' Usually not. If adiver's careful .about* Jus work, nothing, should happen.; -but if anything does happen, if; is usually all pvejL with him. A.tuj* on the line ineai>s death,! especially if hes down deep.
