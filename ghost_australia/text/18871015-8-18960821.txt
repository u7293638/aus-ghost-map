The Ghostly Companion of a j Minister's Graveyard Walk. j , A Methodist minister, lately a resident of Hamil- ton county, Ohio, who has been visiting friends in our city, relates the following thrilling episode in hia life, which occurred while ho was stopping in Van Wert, Ohio: " It waa on a beautiful moonlight evening in June, and the atmosphere was just about as sultry as it has been at any time during the present ' Bummer. I was enjoying myself in the company of some relatives who lived about three milos from Van Wert, on the old Wilshiro road. At a late hour I arose to go, bui my friends insisted that I should remain for the night, as my way would be very lonesome. It was suggested that some ghost anight appear to me at the cemetery or some in- dividual might rob me. This was a beautiful country burying ground, and was situatod about midway on my route. I was quite amused at their artful method of persuasion and laughed vocifer- ously. Tt was very ridiculous to rae, indeed, that there should be a rattling of dry bones or the apparition of a spirit in a modern cemetery. The people of to-day had made too much advancement, as I thought, for such idle fancies as that. " Thus I proceeded on my way with no thought of danger-indifferent to the warnings that had just been given me. As I div>w near to the ceme- tery, however, and began to see the tull, white shafts of marble looming up among the cvurifreens my imagination was stretched to its utmost capacity, and, I confess, I was a fit subject for acrroi ID seemed as it all the spook stories to .which I had listened in my childhood chased each other in quick succession through my brain, and iho very chinup of the crickets or the incessant song of the whippoorwill intensified the loneliness of this little nooit of eaith The long line of dark trees that threw such strange shadows across the fields and the mellow light that foil from the moon Upon eveiy grotesque stump or stately monument only ser\ ed to intensify my loneliness " I aim ed at last at the corner of the cemetery, and oh, 1 on 01 ' njfht in the very centro of this field of dead men's bones, and from the shadow of a blond new tomb-stone, I saw a tall, black creature me and stand eiect The appaution seemed m the distance like .1 hugu coipso clothed in a robe of sackcloth The di cary cye3 weie sunken deep in their sockets, and the few irregular snags that served for teeth weie pressed like fangs a^aniot the thin und wiiukled lips This monster gared a moment in all directions, then with a steady measured movement, it made directly for me I stopped and gared upon the creature and started back bewildered, but at once regaining my senses I concluded to piocced, and, if possible, to put on the appearance of unconcern As I pro- ceeded the spectto proceeded also, and, as certainly as I live xn the piesent moment, it seemed as if wo ?would both meet at the same point in the road After going a short distance I slackened my pace in order to let the mysterious something have all the room in front of me it might desire, and in a few moments I congratulated myself on being about twenty feet m the rear " Contrary to my anticipations, there was no con vei sation opened between us, but in a sti ange ghost- like manner, the long withered form moved ahead of mo until it leached a little old, abandoned buiy ing ground at the right of the load This spot w is fai more desolate than the new cemeteiy, foi it had become entirely neglected, and at the late hour of the night appealed as an mtoi minable thicket, so completely weie the weeds, bushes, biiar»and trees tangled and netted together Into tins uncanny place my ghostly terrifier passed and disappeared I have nevei undei stood the nature of tin«« ippari tion up to the piesent time, and I am perfectly willing to gue my n une to any one who would be inclined to doubt the occiuience "-Washington Letter in Cincinnati Enquirer
