^ SliorJ Story, BUMSTEAD'S DOG BT JAKES OREKWWOOD. I have no antipathy fot the canine kind. X have kept a dog1 myself, and so valued its compnnioo.-hip that tho tax on him was ?always j^iid, if not with cheerful willingness, \- 'with uuf'ifling punctuality. Iain not indis posed ti agree With the poet who fays'* It is . pood to near the honest watch-dog1 bark.' But theio ia a wide difference between simple b.irifiDjET and a fiffnl yelping, varied at frequent intervab=witb a wailing whine, as. though the wretched animal was suffering agonies through colio, or some other internal flument. Hr5** ; Bad enough to listen to in the daytime; ' bat in the dead stillness of , night to be help |«rvv: leasly subjected to the dreadful iufliotion LJj.

Jt depends, of course, on the degree nf hs^. .. exasperation, and, as the deed Co which I was goaded may from a hninanitarian point of 3f;f view appear so atrocious as to merit any amount of punishment that ensued on it, it may t-e us well for me to explain the emmm stances of tho ca*e. h j; My i cadence at the time was in a suburb *, °' London delightfully- picturesque— espeoi ? ^ ally during the summer months — but rather jgV' , lonely.

A shaggy, ugly beast, with a grcut moist mouth, which was always- ajar shoeing his teeth. 'It is aoapital fellow for kctping g«ari,' remarked my T»eW neigh bour the first day he came. 4 No fear * pf ibipyit* pitting in the baok way while he SjTr. : is about. By Jove. '*ir, he scent them a \- quarter of almile off, and he lets you know it p.. ? too.' There was so misdescription in the last* mentioned respect. . He let tsa know almost ! unceasingly from half -past tan at nutht, j ? vh« n he' was turned loose in the baok garden, j k until within aa hour of daylight next morn ing* We were previously unaware of nocturnal marauders prowling around, but . accoiding to that half-bred collie's account . ? there **. ere scores of them, and it was a miraclc tliat our premises had not been ran Backed, and we ourselves murdered in our bed-, months ago. * Did you not hear him?* the gentleman »*xt door gaily inquired, and when I rather ruefully responded that there could be no possibility uf a mistake about that, ' and iton-fk-d thnt I supposed it was being j ttr.tuy-j to the phice made him keep it up i- so l.c MnJ:ngly assured me that that had l.olLing :o do whli it.

I baa to go to London daily to attend to my business, but I no longer £ad any heart for it. My appetite failed me, the hue of health forsook my cheeks, I was really ill. My friends, of oourse, observed it and my wife insisted on my consulting our dootor. He examined me, and pronounced my ailment to [ be indigestion. He was right inone.senee, but he little knew what it was I donldnot digest. \- It would 'have been a comfort to me if I oould in any way have made reparation. The poorfellow4eed abd gone was beyond reach of eartldy betitif, but he znight have relatives. It didnot fellow that because he was an out cast wretch, in rags and not over honest, that there Tfas not somebody who loved and oared for him — perhaps who depended oh him. An aged mother, maybe, or a yonnger sister or brother. If I oould find out any thing about him and his belonging*, I might at least endeavor to do some good in this direction. For days and weeks I searched1 tho local newspapers, * Dead Body Found ' some account of the hapless red-haired youth , and perhaps of his people who attended at the inquest. But nothing of the kind appeared in print, and weeks and months passed, and my bnr -dened -conscience Still m&de; my' life a~mli»eiy . At last matters came to a climax. As I have already said, 1 had to attend everyday to office duties in London, and now and then was tfctained until such a late hour fb&t; the last trains were gone. On such ocpabions. if the weather was bad, I took a cab, but if the weather .was fiuo, I presetted ^ %o 'walk to Bave ctfb {are.* This 'lae$ was the .tiase one. night. in the eatly part 1 of the spring of the present year. My residence beinc north of Islington and zny .jfflafee of business in High Holborn, I founa it oonveniont to go through certain narrow ways as a fhort out to the main road. It was seldom that my victim Was out of my mind, but it happened that I was not then thinking about him when — the neighbouring church of Olerkenwell bad just tolled out twelve o'clock — a ghost appeared to me 1 It was in a dark and dingy street, and without a moment's warning he rose out of his grave, as it were, and confronted me. He was draped in white from head to foot, his form was lank- his face long and narrow, bis nose Roman, and his hair fiery-red. I recognised him on the instant with a gasping cry. I shrank back, and would have turned and run, bat my legs refused. I could only back away from the awful spectre, while, with a hideous griuning visage, it still came at me. At last it spoke : ' Dr»n*t bo alarmed, guv*nor. Have you got such a thing, as a lucifcr match to givei mcf' It was not a sepulchral voice, and why he wanted a match he indicated in earthly fash ion by exhibiting a pipe filled with tobacco, but unlit. * Who who are you ?' I demanded. * I works at the hake'us what ypu just now see me come out of,' replied- the ghost. * Were you ever— ever at Fiiucmey?' I ventured. 4 1 desf- ay/ he answered lightly, * I was mooching about a lot beforo I came across this liere j-'b at the bA'ccV/ * But trfl me ibis. Did you ever climb a. paling at FintAJey and .-teal a piece of *tcak out of a back garden ?' * Course I did,' lie replied, grinning, 1 and much good it did me.' * Bid you good 1 J)o you mean to say that you ate it, and that — — ' . ? I mean to say I didn't eat it,' he inter rupted me, ' I intended to. There was a chap he run after me, and I got into a burn to get out of his way, and there I fell aslefep, and wheh I woke up, blest if the nits : had a t. found my bit of steak and ate the lot. But you haven't told me whether you have gpb a luciijer match or not.' 1 1 have ji'ot got a match,* I exclained, taking liim- W both hands in away that for the moment seemed to al-irm him, * but I have got half -a- crown, and you can buy as many as you please with it. Be kind to rats ever after thi% baker, for they saved your I believed that hn thonght I was intoxi cated. So I wa«, with joy. 1 never walked beine morfe' blithely ? fmtii Holborn to Fiinchiy before or since, and I went to bid and slept like a top, though Buuis'eid's dog was sing ing the old tunc in the ba'dc garden.
