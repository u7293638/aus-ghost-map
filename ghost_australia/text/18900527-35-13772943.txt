It would not been too much to any that recently the young King of Spain caused a more widespread interest than any other living child There was always something interesting in so boyish n Majesty, and this interest was greatly increased through his illness and the political situation His infantile Majesty is by no means the first of child monarchs, history can show many examples, and the Bible prophecies ill to the land whose king is a child the truth of this saying bccomoacloarwhou it is considered what struggles and dissensions have over arisen when only a child filled the throne, with, port haps, Borne intriguing relative for Recent There have been many child king from that greatest of all who I was born. at Belhlihorn, Knifton the Jews," and who) disturbed Herod and all 1 crush them with him, down to-»hall wosay TomCanlv, who«ohiatory Mark I wain has a gracefully told in his be human tale of the Prince and the Pauper " The history of our own country can boast of many child kings although in tar 1er ago there was not much opportunity for them to thrive, asunder the " good old plan " the weakest and to go to the wall, so unions Blood a poor chance Edward the Confessor did not reign as an infant, but still there is to be seen among! these quaint carvings in his chance in v estimates Abbey, a representation of homage being paid to him in the arms of his mother a bon St Edward died, we know that the claims of the Weak Edgar -"Atheling were soon set aside in favour of the sturdy Harold, who, again, was soon ousted by the sturdier William the Conqueror Strength again pre- | vailed over weakness in trio persons of King John and Prince Arthur, who proved know the words of the poor That they should take who have the power, And they should keep who can Another boy King proceeded John, and civil war and misery ovorilowcdiho land Ihorowna ii peculiarity attached to Hourly Ill's coronation there was no crown! his father had shortly before lost it in the tv nah, so that the ceremony had to be performed with his mother's bracelet, which must have been much lighter for his poor little head than the great heavy crown Another scene in English history connected with a baby Prince is that famous one, when the long-limbed Edward confronted the troubling Welsh Ainbnsaadors with a Prince who could not speak x "3, of English This was the first Prince of Wales, and his reign can hardly be called a glorious one Although he was a grown man, he noted as a child, and at last paid the usual penalty for his weakness in Berkeley Castle, where one night " were heard the shrieks of an agonising King " An unfortunate child King was Richard li, who followed not in the footsteps of his brave sir, the Black 1 race His seems to have been a weak character, but he once showed a spirit of his father's soul when in that brave and ready way he found the savage mob on Blackheath, indignant at the death of their leader, Was Tv for, whose fall, at the hand of Lord Mayor Walworth, placed the danger in the city arms Contrast his conduct bore with that which Shakespeare tells of him after his return from Ireland When he ought to be concocting active measures against the quick-moving Bolingbroke, all he does is to invite his friends to sit down, and tell sad stories of the death of Ningchow some have been deposed, some years in war, some haunted by the ghosts they have deported, some poisoned by their way as some sleeping killed, and murdered, for within the hollow crown that rounds the mortal temples of a King, Keeps Death his court " Henry V, " Madcap Hal, was young when he began to reign, but he did not behave as a baby on the contrary, he became the most perfect, chivalrous type in English history The French King soon found out his mistake, when he had sent the short, youthful Monarch that insulting present of tennis balls After a man g the greater part of Prince Henry died in his prime, it seems that the traditional ill luck befell him for marry - ing a French Prince's Strange it is, but all our Sovereigns were unlucky who married French wives Edward li, Richard II, Henry 11, Charles I none of those were fortunate in fact all died violent deaths Evil days settled on England when Henry VI was King, his very birth was signalised with misfortune Bravo Talbot died, La Perelle steadily gained victory on victory, and noon all the hard-won territory in 1 race was lost. Misfortune gloomed more darkly at home, too, and ere long; the White Rose seemed of the same colour as the Red from the blood that was shed Brave Margaret fought on against hope for her work husband, but had at last to succumb, when Kingmaker Warwick was slain, and ere long poor saintly Henry fall a prey to Yorkist daggers But the York at had a murdered king to bewail as well as the Lines than, for who has not heard of the two little princes in the tower slain by the cruel uncle, after being torn from their mother's arms in the Sanctuary of Westminster Here is truly one more instance of weakness succumbing That awful midnight murder, The secret burial under the stair- case, how it has thrilled our young blood? Can Shakespeare really have so much maligned the "crook back" King-' We must remember that Blessed Thomas M oro write a life of the same Monarch, and that his account is not an hit more Untiring than Shakespeare's how, considering that Moore was able to get many facts from Bishop Morton, who had personally known Richard, and surely would not tell a totally different story to the true one, it seems fairly reasonable to assume that the popular account of Richard is the correct one Our next boy Sovereign was the son of "Bluff King Hal," and he savours much of the type of the " good young man that died " His delight was to baton to sermon, he could sit for hours and hear Mnator Latimer hold forth It must have been very easy for the boy King to follow his bent for it was a preaching ago, and " Hot Gospellors " abounded There was something sensational in a sermon thon-piont} of allusions to the bottom less pit, and other stirring matters, The language was not over studied either provided it was forcible the preacher was contented If rumour had not, the young King's early death was due to poison administered by Northumberland He had been betrothed to the infant daughter of James V of Scotland, she who afterwards was to be famous for beauty and misfortune Cardinal Benton disapproved, and war broke out between the two countries The disgraceful flight at Solway Moss killed James before Henry t lil died, but Scotland had to suffer more for this broken match, and Protector Somerset gained a victory at Pinkie Clough Truly might the Scotch end, "the match liked as well, but we like not the wooing " ltwillbonoticcd that all thoLngllahoo} Kmgahavobeou unfortunate- to glance at Scotland a moment. In her history we at once see a prominent child Queen, fumed for her misfortune from her entry into this world, even to her leaving it, from Linlithgow Palace to r Fotheringay Castle, one Bones of mishaps and wool As poor James V lay very sick, almost at death's door from the disgraceful flight of his army at Galway Most, news was brought that a child had been born to him Having eagerly enquired whether it was a boy or girl, and being told that it was the latter, he heaved a deep sigh, and said, "Ah, well the crown came with a lass and I suppose it will go with a Ina " Poor Mary's life was sad enough in all conscience, scarcely w added ere she was a widow, obliged to leave France, dangers on her way to Scotland, her miserable life there all squabbles and confusion, the " booby Darnley," the vile Bothwell, the traitor Mornv, her cruel hypocritical cousin, and all her woes only. ending on a head man's block Poor Mary does not seem to have had much time for wlckoduo»»-»ho had so much sorrow Consider France for an instant Behold hap- less Lorna and Marie Antoinette falling; on their knees and saying, " We are too young to reign " " Too young, indeed," echoed Carlyle, still, not too young to pay the penalty for the centuries of oppression and misery of France.
