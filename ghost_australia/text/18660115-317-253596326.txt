Mr Bowwasi eame forward aod was received with applause. He would not, after the able exposition given hy big colleague, touch tra the Constitutions! question, but would confine himself to the Tariff, which was the gr§nd fea'ure of flic policy of the M'Culhicli Administration. He contended that that Adniaiatration were fighting f«>r the amelioration of the condition of tne working men; of a class that under former legislation contributed X2 or 13 more per annum to fbe State than any other cUss. The M'Culloch administration had not only redneed the gold doty, hat also lessened the coat of the miner's right from £1 to Si.

With regard to Mr Levi, he Mid he almost •earned to mention hb nune in that re*i triable commanlty. He referred to htm «tiric*Uy as a banker, and said thst be wu no(bln« better than a " shent per shent" pawnbroker.
