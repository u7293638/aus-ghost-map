victoria Amateur Turf Club. Fine weather favoured tbe occasion of the Bracelet Meeting of the Vict< . Amateur Turf Club, which passed off! pleasantly at Caulfield on Saturday last. Before noon visitors began to wena tactx way to the course, and before the first race was run, there was a fairly good attendance, which was further increased as the day advanced. The coarse was in excellent order, and as several noticeable improve- J ments have been made since the last meeting at Caulfield, the course presented a very at- I tractive appearance. The racing arrangements were carried out with the clnb's customary completeness, and a start was made with the Hurdle Race, which resulted in an easy win for Merri, who figured very differently to what he did at Elstern wick Park recently, j The Victoria Gold Cup resulted in a hollow victory for Fickle, and The Ghost easily ; disposed of his thirty opponents in the Ladies' Trophy. The Steeplechase proved one of the best races of the season, and re- ; suited in Stampede defeating Fickle after a most exciting finish. The afternoon's sport , terminated with the Richmond Handicap, which fell to Black Diamond, with ; Primus second, and Lyons Lady third. Daring this race Duenna blundered and fell, causmg Lesbia to fall over her. O'Brien, who rode the former, got off with a very , slight injury, but Burton, who rode Lesbi3, ; received a severe shaking, and, on the ; recommendation of Dr. Wilkie, was re moved to the Alfred HospitaL Appended are the results: — Handicap Hurdle Race, of 75 sovb. added to a sweepstakes of 2 sovs. each for acceptors.

Footmauand Blaze Away were the quickest on their legs at the start, but aft? r crossing the first hurdle Merri was taken . to the front, and led. round the turn and ' past the stand, attended by Tantaliser, who ' was just clear of Discount and Musidora ; then came Midnight, Footman, and Concord, ; while Blaze Away was hopelessly in the rear, j Ascending the hiU, Merri stiff held possession i of the lead, half-a-dozen lengths in advance \ of Tantaliser and Musidora, who were i racing sjde by side just clear of Concord I and Footman. Along the back the positions were unaltered, but as they n eared the j sod wall Discount fell back beaten, and ! Concord joined Musidora in her pursuit of j Merri. The latter, however, was going with great ease, and entering the straight full of running, cantered in an easy winner by half- a-dozen lengths from Concord. Musidora who was eased in the last few strides was ! third, Midnight fourth, Tantaliser next, and Blaze Away last. Time 3min. 37ieec.

The trio were sent away to a good start, Gilderoy at once going to tbe front, fol lowed by Fickle, whilst Black Jacket was last. This order was preserved past the sod wall and round the turn. At the first fence" in front of the stand Black Jacket baulked and took no further part in the race. Rounding the turn, Fickle joined Gilderoy, and the pair ran together to the fence on the hill, where the last-named re fused, and though he was subsequently induced to negotiate the obstacle, Fickle had, in the meantime, assumed such a loug lead that he cantered in alone.

Duenna and The Ghost, 100 to 8 agst Oopj. don, 100 to 7 agst Countryman, 14 to 1 each agst Stafford and Honora. Without any delay the lot were sent away to what appeared to be a good start As they neared the sod wall Honora and Aimee on the outside, and Countryman Stafford, and Leporello in the centre, held leading, positions. Rounding the ' turn Countryman retired, and the Ghost, who was well npt made a forward move, and disposing of the leaders, entered the straight with Honors and Aimee at his girths. Below the distance The Ghost drew to the front, and though Duenna and Primus came with a great rush, they could not reach the Caulfield horse, who won very easily by a length from Primus. Duenna was third. Middlemarch fourth, Stafford fifth, and the others finishing in a cluster, whipped in by Fleurette. Time, Imin. 20sec.

L-tuh'iiu 0 Betting : 2 to I agst Fame, 4 to 1 agst Fickle, 5 to 1 agst Stampede. Pride was the quickest on his legs at the start, but soon afterwards Yanco was taken to the front, and showed the way to the first fence, where he ran round. At this obstacle the favourite also refused, Holyrood refused, and Fame was got oven on the second attempt. Pride in the meantime assumed the lead, and led over the sod wall, closely followed by Stampede and Fickle ; t hen came Starlight, Australian Court, Deceiver, Katunga, Banyenong, Helpmate, Doris, and Fame, with Hands Down last. Entering the straight, Pride held his advantage, and though he struck heavily at the fence in the straight, he showed the way past the stand, followed by Banyenong and Starlight As they rounded the torn, Pride, Starlight, and Fickle were all together, but at the fence on the hill the last-named took the lead. At the fence at the dip, Doris came to grief. Along the back stretch, Stampede passed Fickle and B&nyenong;, and assumed com mand, Pride being fourth, and Starlight next, while Hands Down was hopelessly out of it. At the sod wall, Fame, who had regained his position, made strenuous efforts to cut down the leaders, but she soon was done with, and Stampede, Fickle, and Pride raced together over the succeeding obstacle, where Pride came down. After crossing the tog fence, Fickle drew to the front, and though he swung out wide, and took Stampede with him, the latter ran a most deternained race, and by dint of hard riding, got home a clever winner by a neck from Fickle. Australian Court was third, and Deceiver fourth. Time, 4mm. Slsec. Richmond Handicap, of 50 sovs. One mile. Mr J. Pafceraoo's bl g Block Diamond, aged, Tst 51b Dobson 1 Hon W.
