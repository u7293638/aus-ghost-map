Putricia. By. C. KENNETT BURROW, "Cham ber's Journal." "I could never make out why, in the name of wonder, you were christened Patricia." "It was supposed to be feminine for Pat- rick, I think. But please don't waste your time in worrying over my name, Mr. Shove." ■' And please (always Tie careful, Miss O'Neill, to pronounce uny name with the ' o' long, and not as though it rhymed with ' love.' You sate it very prettily, then. My difficulty about your name is that on© wouldn't know what to call you if one wanted to shorten it." * " Pat," said Miss O'Neill. " But Pat'a a man's name. Wouldn't Patry be belter ?" " No," she said ; " and anyway it doesn't matter, does it ?" " It might some day," I said, and looked at her with what I intended to be a very meaning glance. " Well," said ehe. " there'll be plenty of time for you to maße up your mind." " That doesn't sound-kind. I don't know what you meaiTby 'it. Pat." " Rlcia," she added. " I may call you Patricia ?" " If it will pleasef you." "Of course it will please me. But you? 1 ' " I don't mind in the least." " You're a very indifferent person, Mlsa O'Neill." " Well," one said, " you can't expect mo to be interested In my own name." " Or mine," I added. " I know you atmost as well ao my name." " And think a* little of me, I firmly be lieve." " You're a silly boy. What do you* want me to do ? An Ito go down on miy knees to you ?" " That would be very nice. I think. Bet ter still : you might allow me to kneel." " That would certainly not be nice. Men always look foolish when they kneel to a woman." " How do you know ?" I eaitcfl. for I was certain Patricia h".d never been to a theatre in her life, not even In Dublin. " Do you suppose, Larry, that you're the only who ever wanted to kneel to me ?" " I Blvould Hko to suoposp It. Patr'cU." "Would you, indeed ?" ©aid abe. and swept me a ourteey. Then she sat flown to the olano, end. txjrnlnp her fp.ee toward* me. rang : * " O, Larry, me dear, ye're the nicest «t: boys ; But sure, Larry, that Isn't all. ; x Ye must turn out yer toes in an iligant pose. And never say die till ye fall '." There were several verses in this foolish oong, and she went through them all. When she had finished, Patricia bowed to me again, and glided out of the room, smiling with unruffled innocence*. " Patricia," thought I, " you're the most tantalising of oreatures, and the sweetest. One moment you seem to love me, and the next you're as far away aa the moon. What a pity we know each other so well ! It doesn't give me a fair chance." It was November, but fine and clear and not at all cold. I waiked Into Ballyclosher after lurch to post my letters and to buy some little things for Patricia. She made no scruple to uee my services. I remember In one shop, where they sold everything, I found some floe Irish clay-pipes, and bought two dozen of them ; these I carried back In great triumph, packed in a little he*. Patricia begged one of them, to blow soap bubblee she said ; but I never saw her on gaged in that charming occupation. After this I took my gun, and, calling tho two seders, Mar 3 and Nlmrod, and little Willie Donnell to beat for me, I went over the turnip-flelds to the wood. I care noth ing for the wholesale daughter of a big aiiftot, but I love the chances of a casual excursion with the dogs. If you woiit to get away from yourself, tnere is nothing like it, in my judgment. When your finger is on the trigger, and the dogs, head dowa>, are making a line just ahead of ycu. there is no room for auythlng el«e ; an abstracted person could not even walk over a turnip fleld without coining to grief. Mar 3 raised a small covey of partridges, and, by unusual gocd luck for me, I killed, with both barrels. This put me in a good humour with myself, and on we went. I can't say that Willie Donnell was a good beater, and he had a silly way of shouting " Mark" shrilly when an innocent thrush or blackbird rose ; but he meant so well and ai reared to enjoy the work so muJh that I had not the heart to send him back. We had worked half up the wood, and I had a couple of brace of pheasants to my credit, when Mars ran back, wagging his tall violently. " Set, hang ycu !" I shout ed. " Oh, Mr. Shove,'* said a voice, " shame on you to swear at the poor doggie bscaiiae he goea to meet a friend." I turned, and there was Patricia, calmly walking along through the dead leaves. " Well," I said. " a dog shouldn't run away from his duty even for you. I could forgive a man for It. What do you want out here, Patricia ?" _ " Oh, I just heard the firing, and thought I'd come to see whether you Gould ehoot." " Of course I can shoot." " You all say that. My cousin Archie O'Neill said so, but the birds he brought home were a week dead, and came from, Carmore." " Well, my birds are still warm," I said : and I called Willie Donnell--to show lhem to her. She looked at them and nodded. " I can shoot, you know," she said. " Indeed !" saiil I. " Perhaps you would like to show me how well you do It, now?" " You don't believo me ; but I can." " I'll believe anything you tell me, Pat ricia." - *** " Ah, Larry," ehe said, " you're a good creature, and I wouldn't deceive you for the world. Give me the gun." I handed it to her, and she looked to see tbat the cartridges were all right. I confessed to rtyself that she handled the tfcing in a business-like way, and not as moot girl* do, as though they were afraid it xnigot go off unexpectedly. I sat down on (he trunk of a tree and looked at Patricia. " Sit down," I said, " and get your nerv<»3 under control, and think what you'd like to shoot at." She etood before me with the gun on her shoulder, part of the barrel being hidden by >er loose hair ; I felt that my guv was happy.  " What do you think I'd shoot at but a bird ?" " Oh, come !" I said. She turned scornfully on her heel, and called the dogs. I followed, watching her sure etep on that uneven ground with de light. Suddenly Mars stopped dead, head down, tail steady. " Mark," I whispered. In a moment a cock pheasant rose and rock eted up into the bare brancheE. Patricia sighted with the utmost coolness, fixed, and the bird fell. " Bravo !" said I. " 1 should have miss ed .that. Considering that my gun's far too long for you. it was magnificent." " You forget," she said, " that I'm a big girl." ■ ■ \ " How could I forget with you standing there before me ? If I live to be as old as Biddy Maguire, I'll remember how you look at this moment, Patricia. Ah, child." I added (I felt that I might call her child, being four years her senior), " if you'd only believe how you're always before me, night and day." She bluVhed and turned her dark eyes aside : I think her breath caught. At that moment Willie Donnell shouted, ana an other bird was up. Patricia fired, and missed. " The other barrel," I cried. " Larry, it isn't loaded," said ehe, look ing at me with ,the prettiest penitence. " You're a nice sportswoman," sai# I. ■ " You should have loaded It for me." " Well, I admit that. But what ma.le you miss ? It was an easier shot than the other." " You were talking to me," ehe said. . " Patricia, put down that stupid gun, nnd nit here by me; it's as warm &g; epring. We've shot enough for to-day,-and Willie Donnell can go back with the dogs." " I must be going in," Rhe said. " Nonsense," said I ; " sit down, child, and make me happy." " Oh, if that make you happy " and she sat down on a tree-trunk, and look ed across the fields to the mountain« that rose green and gray beyond. " You could make me happy for ever, Patricia, if you liked." " Indeed," said she. Then she turned *er face to me and laughed softly. "You think I could," she went on ; " but #hat can a girl d». even a big girl ? 'Tis easy talking, Larry." " Give me your hands," said I, " and I'll tell you." _ '■ She gave me her ungloved fcann, and I held them for * time without speaking, look ins, into her wonderful, deep eyes. She met my gaze «s steadily as a child. " Patricia, you can love me," I said at last. , " I do love you, Larry." ! I shook my head. ' " That's not the way I mean ; you must love me as I love you." " And how's that ?" she asked. " So much that the eight of you makes me sick with happiness ; to hold your hand 6, Jiko this, is heaven, arttf to kiss you would be a kind of absolution." , " I don't think I love you like that. But you may kiss me, Larry, if you like. You ueod to kiss m« when I was a little girl, and now I'm only a little girl grown up. ' " You must kiss me as well." * :. " Yes," oh* said. •' So we kissed, and for a moment I had, my arm about her. Then she was on her reet, crimson as some of the dead leaves under her. " I didn't mean that kind of kiss !" she cried. " I'm sorry," said I. "You should have itold me the kind you meant. My dear. If you knew my heart you would forgive me." She stood looking on the ground, kicking a little hole in it with the toe of her shoe. She was not seally angry—l could see that ; fcut I could not be sure what her trembling lips meant, or why her eyelashes* were heavy .with tears. I did not realise then what the first lover's kiss symbolises to such a girl as Patricia, a girl compounded of fire and pride and utter nobleness of blood. After a time she gave me her right hand again and said quietly, " I forgive you." I stooped and touched her fingers with my lips—not a lover's kles, but one of simple reverence. As we walked back to the house (I was her father's guest) we hardly spoke at all. But 'that evening, as the old man nodded in his chair after our ueual game orrchess, we together again. '.•"To-morrow," I said, "you're going to take me to Cashel, aren't you ?" ? v " You must see Cashel," she said. jg-" Ot course, and If to-morrow's fine " " We'll drive there," she said, " and have lunch in the ruins." -"Beautiful !" said f. - r>" But it may be too cold.** :...•" There are rugs," I said.., ' " It may rain." V "There are umbrellas and mackiulothoß. Xet it be Caahel to- morrow, whatever hap pens, Patricia." She promised: and wLen I,went to ted I sat up for a long time, and eniokod. one of my new clays, thinking blissruWy of Cashel and the long dri.-e there and bnok. Jt was 2 o'clock before I was asleep ; ray Tooxd. was co fall of smoke that I couid hard ly sco across it. •■ 'The morning was fine, and at 11 o'clock llhe car was ready and we eet out. The country through which we drove was beau tiful ; but all my eyes were for Patricia ; only now and then did I realise how fair a land it was. Holy Cross Abbey, by the ;water-side, a haunt of ancient peace if ever there was one, stuck in my memory ; but I can recall little else until we reached 'Caehol. Patricia had been very silent. but occasionally she gave me her eyes in a [way that made my heart thump ; I could not be quite sure Just what she meant. As we walked up the steep reproach to the gray ruins that crown the abrupt Rock of Cashel ehe became her old self again, 'and we raced each other to the top. It was a dead heat, although Patricia protested that she won ; but when I aeked her what price she wanted, ehe only glanced at me again with that new look of here. We wandered about the ruins and the grave yard until It was time for lynch, which we ©pread upon the grass-tufted floor of what had once beon a room, now roofless aud with a sheer droy on one side*to a kind of courtyard below. We made the place, which we 6eemed to have entirely to our eelves, echo with our laughter, 'and the old cathedral looked down upon us not unkind ly, like a ripe old man fimlllne at youth. Patricia had hod the forethought to put a bottle of- champagne in the backet • but for the reason, as ehe said, that she did -aot care for wine, only one glaso. But 1 coon overcame her scruples and handed her a bumper. health 1" 101"'" ' Mld ' " y°U mUBt drink my " I will, Larry, with all my heart " " Do you mean that ?" ,'7, dO,'" Z' c Eaid> &nl; drank' with a very . et y inclination towards aw. Then fc he lilied again and handed the ?'a«s to me. "Your health, Patricia," said I, "with an my love, and may you see what a jewel i am and secure me while you have the chance !" And I dr.ank to the last drop and turned the glass upside down. "You're a jewel, Indeed," said ehe, " and will make some girl happy." " It's you or no one, Patricia. I've found you, and I'll look no farther." "Oh, Larry, why wouldn't come one tlse do for you as well ?" " Because you are you, aud there isn't any one-ylße in the world." '' That's a good reason," she eaid. ' It's so good that I wonder you can hesi ; rate !" cried I. " Have some cold chicken, Larry." «♦ '"^ the chl<*en," I Mid ; but I took v an the same, and we got on to less dan | gerous ground, and became children Juet as we had been in the old days. After lunch vi& wandered about aguln spending the afternoon in that hand-iu-hand rainillarlty which is bo sweet, and yet, to one in my undefined position, no bitterly disquieting. But I was blindly happy, teH jng her absurd stories that I might hear her laugh, and sad ones that I might see her eyes fill with pity"; and she, on her part, told me a hundred little things about her celf that seemed to make me free of her in ,ger life. At last, when it was nearly dtwk, we stumbled upon King Cormac's Chapel. I have no idea who King Cormac was, but. I know that bis chapel was extraordinarily dark and damp.and gloomy, and that v.c seemed suddenly shut away from all the light and sweetness of the world. How ever, we proceeded cautiously, and after a time reached an arched embrasure with a projecting stone base from which the pl! \--lars sprang. Here we sat down In a stieuce that made Patricia shiver. " King Cormac's Chapel," I said "la l'ke a prison." " It makes me cold," Patricia answered. ..There. was a high window opposite, through which I saw a patch of evening sky there was Just light enough for me to diß tinguteh Patricia's face dimly. "Well," I «ald. "this has been a great d nvyJ? r, me\ P£ trlcla- I>ve h*d you all to fIM ! cV lx hou"' But what'«» that when I want to have you all my life." She drew closer to me and touched my rand. * ' Larry, dear, what does it feel like here" —and she laid her hand upon her heart when you love so much as that ?" At that moment I heard a sound like th 4 closing of a door, but I took no hoed of it. It feels," I said, " as if another life were in you. And," I continued, " I can't bear it any longer. My spirit's all in the dark. Just as my body Is in thla black chapel. Let s go aw^y and gf>t into the world again and perhaps it will teach me to forget " I took her arm, and led her to the door she saying nothing, but I heard her breath ing. I put out my .hand and pushed against the grated door/ It was locked, l was, not in the least afraid for myself ; indeed, I think I inwardly blessed King Cormac: but I did not krow how Patricia might take it. "\Vait a moment. Larry," she said as I fumbled with the lock. «™ W*t "Vif, 1 walt>" x Mld- " We>re Prl6°n ers ; the thing's locked."/ -J^ Of, ked !"vßh^ cried" T*l*ll «he laughed and took my hand. " You can take care of me,".- she said • In a minute you may shout; but first I must tell you something." A pang struck through my heart. " I think I love you a little, Larry '♦ ' I believe that, but a little's no good Don't play with me, Patricia." She drew herself up and took my face be tween her hands and kissed me. All the blood in my body seemed to run to meet ttat kiss. " Will that do ? Is that love enough ?" " Pat," I cried, "do you mean it ? Is it true ?" " Would I lie to you, Larry ?" " God bless King Cormac," I said, and took her In my arms. " I knew it yesterday, Larry." " Then God bless yesterday as well." " Are you happy now, Larry ?" 41 Don't," I said. " This is no place for making love, Pat—'tis a king's chapel. Where's your reverence, child ?" " King Cormac's dead," she said. " Yea, but he might have a ghost.'* " I'd love to see- it." ■" I'd rather see the caretaker," I said, ard with that shouted at the top of my voice. After five minutes of this exercise we heard a shuffling of feet and saw the swaying light- of a lantern. A frightereJ face appeared at the other side of toe grat ing. " What's that at all ?" asked a shaking Voice. " Ach, sure, I didn't know ye were there.*' "What, indeed! I didn't know ye were there." " You might have looked, any way." " Sure, I did look, but divil a soul could I see." He opened the door, and let us forth, full of eloquent apologies. " There's a car waitin' at the bottom ay the hi!' ; maybe that's yours, sor ?" " Maybe it is," I said, and made him hap py with holf-a-crown. As I have already said, I don't know who King Cormac was ; I prefer that he should remain a myth to me ; but I never look at Patricia'without blessing his chapel and hit* name.
