Spectres Sai a Fix. Two Jokers of Fairfield. A party of Fairfield fishermen, voyaging down George's River in one of Mr. Laity's boats,, recently decided to camp for the night in an empty house which has the re putation of being haunted. Two humourists of the crowd, resolving to give their com panions a. startling experience, secretly stole away from the moin body in order to con ceal themselves in the housed and personate ghosts. It unfortunately chanced that the trapdoor of a cellar was open when the two adventurers arrived ; and', in the darkness, one of them fell through, and, clutching his companion, dragged him down too. When the other fishermen came, they were horrified by the sounds of blood-curdling groanings- and lamentations, and fled incon tinently. Mustering up courage byand bye, however, some of the fishermen returned with lights and fouud their two comrades in the- cellar, from which they were unable to extricate themselves ; and one of them, having, hurt his ankle, was moaning pitiably. The pair of jokers were helped out of their unpleasant situa tion, and will probably for the future ab stain from similar exploits. ,
