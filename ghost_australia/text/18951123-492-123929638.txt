Rochefoucauld Annotated. "Self-love," says Rochefoucauld, "is the chief of flatterers," and the aphorist takes the assurance out of self-love. Properly read, he makes use self-interested, not less humane. "The clemency of princes is often clap- trap," yet it is better to be wisely element from a selfish motive than cruel from a motive not at all less selfish. "Sincerity is rare, and is commonly a trap for the confidence of others," but that is no reason why a man should not be sincere. "Judged by its effects, love is more akin to hatred than to friendship," is an aphorism out of which lovers can scarcely find a way of escape. "True love is like ghosts, we all speak of them, but few have ever seen them," indeed only about fourteen per cent. But is it not plain that la Rochefoucauld traitly excludes "true love" from the love whose effects are akin to those of hatred? "Some ingrates are less culpable than their benefactors," is true, and is at the opposite pole from cynicism. "To say that one never flirts is to flirt"- pretty often. "We cosily forget our fruits when they are only known to ourselves," is a good maxim for confessors, and something of an argument for auricular confession.
