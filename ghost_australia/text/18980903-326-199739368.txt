THE BENDIGO GHOST SCARE. An extraordinary circumstance in con nection with., the prevailing ghost scare was reported to the police on Thursday night. Constable Owens was called to the house, of the young man Johnson, who was arrested on Tuesday night while masquerading in female attire in quest of the "ghost," and found a young woman named Sarah Skilbeek apparently in a state of collapse. Johnson's parents said that the girl had been coming to the house about 8 o'clock, and when she was within 20 yards of the gate a figure in white came from behind her and capered in front of her." She threw a stone at it, and was immediately struck on the mouth and knocked senseless. Her screams had been heard, and young Johnson rushed out, just in time to see a figure in white flit up the street and vanish over a fence. The girl was carried into the house by a neighbor, who was attracted to the scene, and a doctor was sent for. The constable could get no statement from the girl her- self. He examined the fence over which the ghost was alleged to have gone, and found it to be quite 7ft. high and one to which he would be willing to give a runaway a start of minutes. Moreover, the vegetation inside bore no marks. The spot is said to be the same as that at which Mrs. Johnson was frighened some nights ago.
