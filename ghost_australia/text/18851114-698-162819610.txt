The flagship— the Colwyn, Captain Robertson, a magnificent vessel, was crowded with visitors. The Stockton band played all day for dancing, and fully 500 persons were on board. The committee deserve great praise for the arrangements. The Newcastle and Stockton wharves were alive with spectators, and the continuous traffic by the steamers from the harbour made a scene of busy life. There were jxo accidents of any importance, a few capsizes occurred, but those immediately interested only got a ducking. Everything passed off in a satisfactory manner, all the races starting punctually, and no hitches took phioo. The following are the results: — Race for Yoaths under 18 years of age, pulling pair of sculls in light dingies.— Fly, J. Torpey, 1st; Rose, G. Towns, 2nd; Unknown, J. Owens, 3rd; Terror (A.

Owing to the start having taken place near Scott's Point, up the harbour, it was hardly discernible from the flagship, but it ib believed to have been a good one. The race was good throughout, and each crew pulled pluckily, but the N. R. C. had the best of the game, winning by a couple of lengths, the Shamrock about six lAngflm behind Shy Lad. A protest was entered by the Shamrock, on account of alleged fouling by the other two boats. Race for All-comers who have never won an advertised first pnee, pulling pair of sculls, with coxswain, in working watermen's skiffs.— Rose, H. Palmer, 1 ; Adeline, H. Gib son, 2 ; Violet, T.

Spears, 1 minute; Alone, W. Skelton, 2 minutes; Maggie B. Lloyd, 6 minutes. This was the largest number that had started at any regatta here. Just after rounding the lightship the Alone carried away her mast, lost her chance, and was towed back. Star led the first time round, followed by Difcky Sam, Saucy Jack, Maggie, Flor ence May, and the rest all together. Very little alteration took place in the second round, except that Star was evi dently leading by several lengths, and Dicky Sam and Myra close up. The race resulted in Star winning by 10 lengths, dead heat between Myra and Dicky Sam for second place, and Saucy Jack a good third. This was considered the crack event of the day.
