C4ORRESPONDENCE. A COltitECOTIN. (To the Alitor of" the Gilpp?ealmd Timed.) S1tI,--Your subtleader of the 29th ult. with refereuce to the holidays has been brought under moy notice only today, and while approving of its tenor in general, I beg leave to take exception to the assertion therein contained that the Commnlercial Association "is dead." bMaybe the fact that the association, nout having any hurning questlons to dideaus, had neot been before the publio of late, Ioas led you to that erroneous opinion, but let tme assure you that its memn hers, though comparatively smallt in tunuber, are wide awake and observant, as may be found presently. It is to be regretted that businessmen of Sale do not see it to their advantage to join the association in full aumbera, and thereby to strengthen its in. loenueo materially, for the time is coming when united and energetio action will be re quired in order to conserro til erocmcercial interests of the town. In the meantime tiose businessmen who at present are members of the association intend to persevere, and not to give up the ghost.-Yours, etc., A bEJMBllER S.O.A. 212194,
