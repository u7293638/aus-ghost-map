MIELBOURNE ITEMS. (FROM OUR OWN CORIRESPONDEXT). June 18. The discreditahble seen that occurred in the City Court last Friday, when Mr David Gaulnson.gave his tonlgu a little too much license, furnishes a justilication for the action of his late Parliamenrrrry eonstituents-n-uppo ing that they needed one-in decliining to again return him to tile Legislative Asseombly. For, it must he obvious to the dulle.t intellect that a man is not lit to he entrusted with the impnr tant task of fralning laws, who hna so profound n contempt for them wh-in made as Mr GOtmton exhibited on t :o day named. Thero can be very little doubt that hitn gornerl condluct in the Houtoe very omatlriatly infllenced tihe voting at the last ge.wrarl Icction, and that his failure to gain a seat was prin cipally owing to the fact that the in" tferrts of tire district wonld ho better served by another person. It io, per. irepo, a ftrtunsto circturIrastance for Mr Gaunnon that his cli.nt d nrtt inew things in a simi:ar' light.
