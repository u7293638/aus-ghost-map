ECHOE&'oF MELBOURNE CL^ir^rasrTHHiGHOSTyzrrrr!::::-: The symptona which betoken the ap proach of each Parliamentary session in Victoria have already begun to develop ?themselves. The Treasury is daily besieged by deputations of ' sturdy beggars,' sent f roui all parts of the country to urge the claims^pf 'itheiK''respeotiyeJdis-i tricts upon the GoVernmeni-T The various'' ?decentralisation Teagues; are^the ??? motive1 ;power in those raids upon the State coffers. ' Unfortunately, instead of talcing a ^ide and statesman like view- of the ?question, the '? decentralisers' have 'initiated a scramble for the public money, :and narrowed down their demands to the 'establishment of local^railway workshops,, the building:of 'public qfficepXari'd' increased/: subsidies! »to'kithe fc'charitable1'' ^institu1'-- ?tions within their several dis tricts.

'Wheri members of the Legislature can ,be brought to see how much theirpwri position' would be exalted were Parliament relieved of the numerous petty questions that now engross the larger portion of its time, and left to deal only withjlarcje issues involving the general interests of the colony, the de centralisation question will assume proper proportions. True, many honourable mem bers would find their occupation gone. Their periodical visits to the Ministerial offices would no longer be required, and tthey would no longer be able to gain fame fay 'orating' on the 'gross wrongs' of a porter at the Ballyracket 'Jfanotipn'Statrqn removed for insubordination, nor tio point out how the welfare of- 'the'! colony was'' b'eing imperilled by the neglect of, the.
