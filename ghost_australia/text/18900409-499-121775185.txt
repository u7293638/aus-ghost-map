GBIFFO y. SMITH. A SIMPLE 8t-aOOBZBB. At Jfoley's Hall on Saturday night lost Guffo and Young Smith met to fight to a finish for £10 a-eidDond the gate. The oontcat did not last very long, as it was obvious to all present that Griffo waa in grim earneat, ard meant to mako short worS of the now iippirunc to mho nonorn.

Griffo fought splendidly, and had his man anyhow in a few seoonds. He doalt a won derful amount of pnniahmont in a vory short epaoe of time, and Smith had not a shadow of a ohanoe with him, being outclassed in all parts of the game. Tho flght was a genuine ono, and pleasod the epootatora better thtn a ten or twelve round fake; and those who oaw Griffo perform will go again to see him. It is oleao, honoat fighting that draws tho money, not limp, hollow frauds, of whioh tho publio have had far too muoh recently. Aftor tho fight Griffo and Chitty Byan boxed ail ficit clnea rounds, both lada showing great oloror cess and quiokneBS.
