A PEEP AT BENARES. ] ? (From the Sunday Magazine.) Benares is said to have been famous 26 centuries ago, Before Babylon, Tyre, and Athens had attained their super annoy And now, while these and other ancient cities no and low in the dust, Benares still remains, and she still receives homage from the thousands who flock to her faces and long for publication from her waters The city is situated on the northern bank of the Ganges, and was anciently called a nihilist, a word which is said to be taken from the names of two streams, the "V armies and the Asia, which severally (low into the Ganges to the north and youth of the city The Vaianu is commonly called Lorna, and it contains consider able quantity of water interning season, but the Asi 18 new ax s a small stream. Others say that a certain Rajah Burns, who in former times ruled over Benares, gave it its name Another name, however, which is much used for the city by the natives is ICisi, the splendid" Dr Shernng, in his wonderful work on the Sacred City, tells us that it is really composed of three parts, Benares, the most ancient and the most northern part, Kfisi, the central portion, where most of the temples are, and Kcdor the newer suburb, towards the south-west, and that there is a tendency in the city to shift its quarters in a south-westerly direction I had had a great longing to see this, the sacred city of the Hindoos, and to v fitness for mx self the scenes on the holy river Ganges, the temple?, and the ghosts so, being on a visit to) Calcutta, we, a small mission party, ladies and gentlemen, resolved to press for ward by rail to Bo- flames On the evening of March 8 we started, to avoiding all night, and timing at our destination in the afternoon of the following dux During the first part of the night the mosquitoes, those Eastern torments, were x ory troublesome, but eventually we slept very comfortable on our railway coaches Dung the next morning we had an opportunity of seeing the country through which we were passing It was mostly flat, with a few hills, while ricefields, trees stripped of her es, and poppa s, which are cultivated for opium, diversified the scenery We changed trains at one station, called Mogul sara, wherever took tiffin The first view of Benares is very imposing This wonderful city, whose measured Ion gilt along the banks of the river, by silver, is said to be barely three miles, and its nxeiagodopth not more than one, possesses a thousand Hindoo temples and 333 Mahomedan mosques, besides shrines and idols and images innumerable These temples are not, cannot so, crowded as they are not so small a space, nearly so extensive of as those of Southern India, especially those at liraxalurand Trichinopoly, but for grandeur and exquisite carving they far exceed them Imagine, then, if possible, such a city with its temples and those wonderful ghost, or flights of steps which lead down to the river suddenly bursting upon one's view, and the thrill of intense emotion which passes through the beholder who remembers that this is the great centre of Hinduism, as well as the spot at which the founder of Buddhism commenced his mission in Asia Vc happened to arrive, too, just at the time when preparations were being made for one of the festivals, so that the river was gay, and its banks (thronged with pleasure-seekers On our arrival at the railway-station, which is built on the south side of the river, we took games, as the vehicles there are called, and drove in these across the Ganges ox or a bridge of boats, and so came to the north side, on which the principal part of Bonnies is erected Our host, who was exceedingly kind during the whole of our visit in taking us to see various places of interest, proposed our descending from our ghan lies on our way to his house to visit the Buddiusticnl remains which are visible from the 6th" Ghost road, on which revolvers travelling, and with are to be found euiioflyon the summit of the banks of a tank known as Bakoruyit fund The principal parts of these re- mains are built on terrace held upon the walls of Taeavy stone, which run by the sides of the fund. The building itself, originally a Buddhist temple, is now in the possession of Mussul- man, so that the dome is of Mahomedan con instruction, and on the top of a court, and is a Mahomedan Idargah or place of prayer The ground is strewn all around With stones, many of which are carved with curious and elegant devices, and must be of a vast antiquity I spoke of the festival for which the people were preparing at the time of our entrance into Benares, it was to be held at night on the Ganges, and was but one of the 40 Hindu and Mahomedan Melas [hold every year in Benares This we were told, was the Burwa Mangel Mein, held on the cover on the Tuesday after what is called the Holy festival VCe thought we should like to witness this sight, so proceeded, at about 9 pm from our host's house in the canteen to the city we were greatly impressed with everything we saw, the river's bank seemed to be crowded with human beings, dusky themselves in hue, but dressed in gay merits of many colours, and we proceeded down one of the many ghosts through this mass of humanity to the river's brink, and stepped into a gaily caparisoned boat, where we were received by a Hindoo baboo, who had invited several of the English, residents to see the stomachs, who had provided lemonade, champagne, cakes, and ices for his guests This gentleman, short in stature, was dressed in a long blue velvet coat and white trousers, and wore a bluecap with, a triangular tail suspended from the back, while on his eve as he had dark-coloured spectacles I must confess I was not charged with his appearance. The boat itself looked very gay with its yellow and red flags, cloths, etc and music enlivened us as we entered soon we were surrounded by other boats, some of which were more gaudily attired than ours, that of the Rajah of Benares having a marble top, and another boat an immense peacock with spread tail at its low Several of the boats had lower stones surmounted by higher ones, which were covered with richly coloured canopies, and on which sat or squatted natives in every variety of dress or undress Our boat was propelled by a paddle which was worked by men, as on a treadmill, some changing with others as these were weary, and for some hours we were taken up and down the river, getting of course, a magnificent view of the city by Bight, with its various temples and ghosts, and its crowds of people At the burning shot dead bodies were being continued, so that their ashes might mingle with the waters of the holy river. After midnight two Nautch girls came on board each accompanied by four men, who made most amusing features as they followed up the dancing girl with rude music and singing, one man, entirely clad in yellow, and beating a tom-tom, was particularly entertaining He would burn and then give a grunt, as his whole body seemed to perform what he was playing with his hands The girls were beautifully dressed, and sometimes sang is (they danced, going up to one and another of the party assembled It was impossible to look on them without pity, brought up to a life of debauchery, and dedicated to the service of those temples, which really means of the priests of these temples. Those for many years were the only girls who were allowed to learn to read and write, and thus arose the feeling which. still largely exists, that it is a disgrace for a girl to be able to " press a style upon a palm-leaf " Christianity and Eastern civilisation are altering these things now, and the day is passing away when the nautch girl alone of her sex in India may be educated It seemed a long time before your boat was paddled up to shore, and we were able to get off, and it was 2 a m of Wednesday before we reached our house, very tired and weary The festival Itself continued until the evening of Wednesday It was originally called the Buddhism Mangal (Budh, Wednesday), which has now been corrupted to Birriwa Mangal 'The people had just before this been celebrating [the Holy held, which is said to be noted for its obscenity. Many of them wear coloured cloths, and discharge red water on people passing in the streets We particularly noticed the cloths of those on whom this great water had been discharged on the day after the Burwn JMangal festival, when we again went out sight-seeing It was 8 o'clock in the morning before we felt sufficiently rested to return to the city, and by that time the sun was insufferably hot The first object of interest which. we then visited was the old observatory, erected by Rajah Jay Smith, which is situated on the summit of the Marylands Gh'it 'The Rajah Jay Smb. was a man who was particularly fond of the mathematical sciences, and he elected five observe stones, one at each of those towns, Delhi, Bonaies, Mathura, Oujcm, and Jovpour, and his instruments, all of stone and lime are some of them of immense size, and so strong as to last for ages, and yet of such delicate adjustment as to be of the same use now as when they were elected Ve saw these wonderful instruments, but the scorching sun soon drove us down the steps by which xv o had mounted to them Underneath the observatory was a large room, where, as two were told, the Rajah of Jeypore is wont to entertain his friends One end of the room is screened off by a pul - slab, behind which were the poor women of the Zenana. Outside the building was a narrow passage, between it and the houses opposite, and on the window ledges of those houses monkeys no doubt greatly rex ered wore enjoy ing (themselves On the top of the what we noticed a very told sarcasm, or devotee, looking filthy and wizened in the extreme. The smalls around were most disgusting Oh, 'how terribly hot the sun was as we descended to the waters edge and walked along its banks I While our host went off to fetch us a boat we stood under a shed, glad of even this little shelter, and watched the bathers performing their morning ablutions in the holy Ganges One old woman crabbed herself, head and all, with sand, and then dipped in the water, while others scoffed themselves with mud in the muddy stream Taking our boat, we again went down the air or, so as to get a daylight view of the city. How thronged it was dirt and gorgeousness were wonderfully mended But the one great impression on one's mind was this What a power Hinduism is yet in the land, and what multitudes are held yet in its deadly grip . while the gentlemen went to look at the Nepalese temple, the sculpture of which was too obscene for us Indies to look at, but which is a picturesque object and different from all other shrines in the city, two ladies remained in the boat and received sunday salaries and greetings from the Rajah of Benares, who was floating down the river in a boat similar to our own Presently we thought we would go on shore and visit the wonderful well of salvation, " Mamkarnika," famous in Hindu mythology I cannot refrain from introducing home the story of the origin of this well, as translated by Dr Shcmng from the Iutsi-Khanda " the rod "Vishnu," so goes the tale, " dug this well with his discus and labour water filled it with the perspiration from his own body, and gave it the name of Cliukia Pushkanni He then proceeded to its north side and began to practise asceticism In the meantime the god "vluViudev a armed, and looking into the well beheld in it the beauty of a hundred millions of arms, with which he was so enraptured that he at once broke out into loud praises of Vishnu, and, in his joy, declared that whatever gilt he would ask of him he would grant Gratified at the offer. Vishnu replied that his request was that Mahadoxa should always reside with him Maidens. hearing this, felt greatly flattered by it, and his body shook with delight. From the violence of the motion an carring, called Jluni kanaka, fell from his car into the well. From this circumstance, Mantova gave the well the name of Mantkarnika. Among the epithets applied to it are those of JAIuktxkshctrn, 4 seat of liberation,' and I urnasuohukaran, a complete source of felicity.' Mantova further decreed that it should be the chief and the most efficacious among places of pilgrimage" How sad that these deluded idolaters know not of the fountain opened in the House of David for sin and uncleanness, and so must now out for themselves cisterns of filth and abomination which they would fain believe will cleanse their souls.
