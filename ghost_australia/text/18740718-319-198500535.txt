; . . . . POLITICS. — "TV ' i. "The writ for the election of a member of Parliament to represent Collingwood, - in; Ithe place of Mr. JohnEverard, resigned,' was issued on Wednesday. - The date of nomiria. " tion is fixed for the 23rdinst. ; polling, 29th i and return of writ, 4tli August. We learn that a telegram has been re- ceived from the Agent-General to .the effect that there is a teolmical difficulty in placing the Victorian loan for £1,500,000 Upon the London market without the debentures. TheStockExchange rules prohibit operations 'where theso are not to hand. The ar rangement of placing the loan, on the market by telegram will hot, therefore, bo carried out. The message from Mr. Micliie states that the condition of the money market is still favorable, and likely to continue so foe some time to come, The subject of 50lb. rails, as used on the Maryborough and other light lines, versus 60ld. rails, as recommended by Mr. Greene, the resident engineer, and approved of by Mr. Wells, the Acting Engineer-in Chief, and Mr. W atson, occupied the attention of the House for a couple of hours on 16th inst. The discussion was brought on by a oontin- gent notice of motion, moved by Mr. Long- more, on going into committee of supply, expressing an opinion that it was not ad visable to increase the weight of rails to be used in the construction of light lines. He descanted on this subject at some length, contending that the 50 lb. rails would carry the engines that had a bearing weight of four tons to the wheel, and that the country could not afford a more expensive kind of line, for increased weight of rails meant wider cuttings, closer sleepers, and other extras. Mr. Gillies replied that there was no intention of putting the heavy engines, on the light lines, even if 60lb. rails were adopted. He produced a report from Mr. A. Wells, Acting Engineer-in-Chief, who ap proved of Mr. Greene's recommendation that 60 lb. rails should be used, as they would last twice as long as the 50lb. rails. The House negatived Mr. Longmore's motion. The Elections and Qualifications Committee have disposed of one portion of the petition by Mr. M'Cormick against the. return of Mr. Godfrey as a member for East Bourke,1 viz., that portion relating to the treating. They have found that at tlie last general oloction refreshments were supplied to tlie electors by Mr. Godfrey, his agents or friends, but they were given unconditionally, and with out influencing tho election, and consc- ' quently were no offence against tlio statute. The petitioner then urged a sorutiny, and plaims to havo certain electors struck off tho roll because they treated '"the - electors. A list of Jabout thirty electors alleged to have so offended was handed to tlio committee, aud the evidence alrendy adduced in support of the treating by the Bitting member was relied on as being double-edged. The committee dc- cidod that as far as Patk. M'Gann, IS. Elms and John Williams wero concerned, the al legation of treating was proved, and tlioy re quired witnesses to "bo produced as to other cases on which: no evidence had been given by Tuesday next. They found that F. R. Godfrey, Thomas Wilson, Thomas Colcougb, Thomas Langford, James Langford, Joseph Sidebottom, Robert Sidobottom, Samuol Sidebottom,' and Michael Dcegan had nob ibeen guilty of treating. ' On ICth inst., in the House, tho Attorney- General was asked what steps tho Govern ment intended to take in reference to the committal of Air. Casey, surgeon, by Mr. Coroner Candler, in consequence of some ' dispute which occurred some days ago .be tween these gentlemen at an inquest. Air. Kerferd stated that he had seen a statement of the matter in the papers, but it had not been brought officially under his notice. Shouldthis be done, ho informed the House tlint a board would be appointed to investi gate the circumstances.

" The -Ballarat Star has the following.gosalp -respecting the Grenville -election "At a meeting of the most influential-residents aiid politicians ' day forenoon, it was decided not to tdlow- il Mr. Lock a walk-over for the vacant seat for Grenviile. It was decided, to send requisi tions to Sir John O'Shanassy and Mr. Wil son, ex-M.L.A.'s, the latter having been defeated, at Ararat atthe last general elec tion. - We understand that both gentlemen have expressed their willingness-to contest the election if guaranteed support, and it rests . .with them to decide who will oppose -Mr. Lock. Our Smythesdale correspondent writes: — 'When Mr. R. H. Lock an nounced himself a candidate for tho vacant aeat in Grenviile, a good many in this quarter inclined to think that, from the existing com- hiuationof circumstances, ho would be allowed a walk-over. It would seem now, however, that there is .every probability of there be!ng some more candidates in the field. Sir John O'Shanassy is freely, mentioned as certain to cbmc .forward, and on Tuesday evening an acquaintance informed me that be himself was then in correspondence with Mr. Richard Baker. to, ascertain whether he would stand. With regard to Sir John O'Shanassy 'a cLanco it is .but fair to wai;n him that he has no t what is popularly termed "the ghost of a show." Mr. Look's chances arc splendid, should they not be spoilt by some unfore seen circumstances. There are many here who ..would support Sir John O'Shanassy against any other candidate but Mr. Lock ; hut there is a strong feeling that Mr. Lock has a claim upon the district against all comers.'"
