A GHOST STORY. The chief topic of conversation in Camperdown recently has been the reported appearance of a " ghost" in a house situated in Manifold-street The present tenant, a bachelor, is reported to have actually seen the " visitor from another world." The gentleman in question returned from the metroDolis one mght by the last train, and duly retired to rest. He was very tired, and was sound asleep in a few miuutes. He awoke during the night with a sort of " uncanny" feeling about him, and on looking down to tbe foot of the bed he saw (or fancied he saw) a man sitting on it. Thinking for a moment that someone was playing a practical joke on him, he kicked out vigorously at the visitor, and to his horror his foot passed through the figure without meeting any obstacle. Thoroughly roused, he promptly sat upright in tbe bed, but there waa nothing to be seen. Thinking it was a dream he lay down agun, but in a few minutes tbe apparition was again visible. Without waiting to make further discoveries tbe earthly occupant of the room gathered up his clothes and made about the quickest time on record from the house to the shelter of a hostelry some hundreds of yards away. The shock to his system was so great that he has since found it necessary to go to the seaside for change ot air. This is the account which has caused so much stir in Camperdown. It is now proposed to attempt to unravel the seeming myetery, and numbers of persons have volunteered to sleep in the room reported to be haunted, in order to prove that the " ghost" exists only in imagination. It may stated that eome ot the former tenants have testified to noises, &c.;, but they have generally attributed them to the love of Bom* friends for playiug a practical joke. The idea of the house being haunted is generally ridiculed ; but there seems to be a desire on the part of some people to clear up the mystery.â€”C amperdown Chronicle.
