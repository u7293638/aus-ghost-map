! WHEN THE WAH IS OVER. Fancy the kind of ghost implied in n haunted typewriter ! lt is a " clipping " idea, ab Delinda's gossip might say. Ile is the spirit of Hatclmrds Who once a mouth, besides writing to llclindn, clips extracts from old and current books. Tile reading of to-day is mostly by way of extracts. If there were a eensor of extracts, the read inn, might bc almost educational, Hut thc titbitity publications are lowering the re- ceptive capacity of thc reading public, and making sustained intellectual effort almost impossible. When thc war ia over, and its sequel conflicts at an end, we shall wipe out all the bitty " fi ivvlc," and settle down to literature and philosophy, our lamps well trimmed for fifty years of intellectual peace.
