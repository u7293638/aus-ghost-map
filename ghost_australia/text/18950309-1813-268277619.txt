IShori -Story, A LIVE GHOST. \- w ' There he isThere she isThere they are!' These outcries were not fragments of u conjugation hut the exhumations of a joj ous crowd wlii'li leaned oyer the sidus, of the Campania, as she - steamed a 1 owly to her -dock, and the mass of humanity waiting upon the pier .became gradually iudiridualized. Tom Stuart listened with a paugof loneliness none the less keen because it was unreasonable. He had informed nobody of his return. Yet his heart was heavy with the knowledge that one of those eager wel comes would be for liim, thong he had wandered so much farther than any of these other, travellers.. - . ' Two years before, he had rushed, away in hot desperation of a lovers* quarrel. But in 'darkest Africa' death's every-day neighborhood had taught him many lessons; and part of that stern teaching had been the translating of what seemed the dignified selfassertion of his abrupt departure in a cruel injustice toward the girl who loved him. For of course Mabel loved bim; else why shouid «he have promised her beauty and her fortune to him, penniless Tom Stuart, who possessed only a paint-brush for future reliance? It was'her money, or rather bis lack of money, whiuh had mudubim so easily, offended when Van JEyck toutiuued to haunt, her steps after the announcement af. their engagement. He had been jealous, Ishe had-, been. resentful; they -had quarrelled, andwithin three (lays he had joined an expedition fitted out by a couple of wealthy yonng fellows of his acquaintance, who were inspired with the craze for African exploration prevalent among the youthful millionaire 'unemployed.' \- V Good God! ho w long were those two years! • Through what a lifetime of monotonous marches-and dreary watches he-had .^dreamed; of the letters from her which he was icon-, vinced he should find when his party got ; bark to Zanzibar, where ;civilisation and the mail service - ended. • Was itnot.one ofher half-tender, half-mocking assertions, in the first glad days of their engagement, (hat a woman must naturally prefertoaskfoigiveness of the man she -loved, rather than to bestow her forgiveness upon him ?-. • Bat, though dozens of letters --awaited his friends,: there had been nothing'for him,— -nothing! He was entirely fceroft of family r; ties, and was of no social or financial importance. -Only, to Mabel had he desired to cable' news of bis safety; and her anxiety was obviously not incapable of further endurance. ; In the midst of the joyful- messages sent home by his comrades, Tom Stuart liad maintained the silence of hin disappointment. Nor had he wished to break it through all the many weeks which «re. required even nowadays to bring a traveller from' Zanzibar to New York, until this foolish longing for a welcome overtook him as he arrived, unexpected and -unrecognized, among the liappy meetings upon the Cunard pier. Yet not quite unrecognised. While he .whs accounting to a customs inspector for-his portfolio of- African sketches, be became awiirebf an oddly amazc-d stare fixed . upon- trim,J- and -recollected the perpetrator thereof to bo a former acquaintancc. 'Halloo, Jackson !' he exclaimed genially. • Hia offered hand was accepted hesitatingly. ' Tom Stuart ?' Jackson stammered, with an uncertain smile. '* Beg your pardon. I— I thought you were dead.' • ' Never more alive,' Tom'declared, struggling against an absurd disnlayatthe quality of this first greeting. ' You look splendidly,' Jackson continued, with growing cordiality: ' I ' heard thatthe expedition had returned l; eafely to Zanzibar a month ago. But there was a rumor of your death Boon after your depart- \- ore.' ' I am happy to be able to contradict ihe rumor,' Tom said, cynically; ' though I dare say most people will have' forgotten both me and my demise, if the rumor is two years old. You should he proud of your very retentive memory,'Jackson' - '•".-• With this utterance of anatural if unjustifiable resentment he stalked away into"a cab, . and was driven up town. ' " New Yoik was as dirty, dustyj^and deserted as it usually is early in August, arid Tom's remembrance of African' heat became more liudly before he arrived, porspiring and perplexed, at his club. ' He had never been a prominent member of thatagreeublo institii-: tion, but he had frequented it for many years, and, should everybody he knew be out of the city, he relied forlornly upou recoguitjoni'rom the servants. The hall porter, however, proved to be a uew- comcr, who replied to Tom's inquiry for a room with the formula, ' Only club mem- \- burs recived, sir.' - ' You will find my name on the books, -• Thomas Stuart.' ' The porter drew a careful finger up the . -column belonging to the letter S; Then he confronted Tom dumbly, divided between' amazement and indignation. ' Well?' Tom demanded, a-ehillof suspicion stealing down his spine,—not a plesaut chill, : even in August. ' The Thomas Stuart on this list is dead.' 'Don't you see that I am alivo?' cried Tom. ' Yes,' the other admitted, sharply; 'bat •I don't see that you "are Thomas 'Stuart.; Hero is the star opposite the gent s 'name.' • ' . • ; ' Call one of the old servants.
