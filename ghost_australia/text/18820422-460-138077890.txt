ORIGINAL POETRY. ONCE MORE. "INTERMISSA DIU BELLA." I had not thought again to be A dreamer of such dreams as these. The springtime is no more for me; My summer died beyond the seas. From what untimely source begin These stirrings of the life within? I had not thought again to taste The bitter sweet, the joyous pain. I deemed that I had trodden waste, Beyond the power of sun or rain, The soil that grew the passion fruit;-- Then, whence this blossom underfoot? I had not thought again to see Beyond the homely pale of truth;-- The lights and shapes of witchery, That glorify the skies of youth, I only knew as perished things;-- Whence, then, this flash of angel wings! How spend the day, yet save the hours? I had my day; the hours are fled. How eat the fruit, yet hold the flowers? I ate the fruit; the flowers are dead. Oh, what divine or fiendish art Hath twined fresh tendrils round my heart? I said, 'tis good to be alone, No alien hand to urge or check. I said, my spirit is my own, To loose or bind, to save or wreck. I trod on Love, called Reason lord; Lo, whence this subtle silken cord? Oh, who shall tell if this be strength Re-risen, or ghost of old defect! The truth of manhood come at length, Or weakness born of purpose wrecked? I only know it is the whole Arch-craving of a hungry soul. I only know that all the hordes Of buried hopes and jealousies Are risen again and crossing swords, And that 'twas but an armistice, A breathing time 'twixt strife and strife, Which I had deemed a peace for life. Oh, who shall tell where duty lies-- To urge, repress, advance, or stay? To grasp at Good in Beauty's guise, Or brush the pretty lure away, Ere doubtful war of hopes and fears Consume the hoarded strength of years? J. BRUNTON STEPHENS.
