A Haunted Oallery. HuitE is tho mysterious haunted gallery | connecting tho old ' Queen's apartments' j with the royal chapol. Tho gallery is j liuunted, it is said, by tho shridking ghost' of Quean Catherine Howard. Tho Queen was a fascinating, deceitful, de lightful little creature, who had been sadly neglected in her youth and corrupted by debasing companionship, but full of tho dolight of life nnd shrinking sensi tively from evory touch of pain. Yesterday she had been the petted toy of hor cruel husband ; to-day slio was doomed to tho fearful fato that awaited Harry's discarded wives. In tho horror of her position, surrounded by rough and I brutal soldiers of tho King's guard, sho \ found a momentary chance of oacape, and rushing through tho long gallery, ran to seek her husband, who was at that moment hearing mass in tho chapel, to cling to his knees, to soften with hor tears that heart of adamant. Tho guords at thoir utmost speed followed the poor distracted creature. Just as sho reached tho King's closot thoy overtook her and dragged iter back, her rrenzted screams resounding through tho palace. The gallery is now used as a kind of lumber room, but still the shrioks of the agonised Queon are to be heard at times. Anyhow, in Ernest Law's interesting volume, ' Humptt n Court in Tudor Times,' there is recent testimony to that effect.
