T C SIMONS then delivered his address as retiring president as follows - IHV URTlttlNO lltlSlDrNT'l AlVtVtlltSS After a brief glance at the initiation and development of Methodism in Australasia, the speaker proceeded - W. meet to day under circumstances which in my judgment are of except sonal interest and the question to which I desire to direct your thoughts is the position of the Australasian Wesleyan Methodist Church and the re ation which it bears to the Universal Church of Christ and to the world. But the question arises to-day in a manner and certainly to an extent which it has not hitherto assumed-Do we meet as the representatives of voluntary Christian so active or as the representatives of a connection of churches which by voluntary action have become a federated Christian Church -a true branch of the Catholic Church of Christ with all its rights responsible s and obligations to Christ and to the world I presume the unanimous reply by this audience would lie-Wo meet as a true and real Christian Church and I take it that reply would be echoed throughout the < Christian communities of our land And yet I am not sure that this would be so I am convinced that large numbers of members and adherents of our own Church both here and in England have no correct conception of their Church ' relation to Methodism or of the re] union of Methodism to the Universal Church of Christ And there is another class who positively refuse to acknowledge that the Methodist Church or indeed any non Episcopal Church throughout the world has any right to be recognised as a true Church of Christ, or that its ministers have any scriptural claim to be ministers of Christ and that therefore its Christian ordinances or Sacraments are invalid and worse than that are sinful in the sight of God After Christ's resurrection He directed the 11 disciples to go into all the world and preach the Gospel to the whole creation " F ram this it would seem as if the duty of preaching-of making disciples-was to be theirs exclusively, notwithstanding the 70 had previously been so engaged they were to be witnesses of Christ s life. and especially of His resurrection They were also to be invested with extraordinary and miraculous powers These were conferred upon them on the day of Pentecost the first distinct association of Christians after Christ's ascension was the gathering together of about 120 ' who waited in Jerusalem for the promise of the rather that they should be baptised with the Holy Ghost not many days hence " The inauguration of the Church was at and by the descent of the Holy Ghost on the day of Pentecost, when the "all who were with one accord in one place, were baptised with the Holy (Ghost. And not the apostles only, but all the 120 ' brethren " no distinction being made between the apostles and others After Pentecost the organisation of the converts was of a very simple kind The Christian Church presented a striking contrast to the Jewish Church Peter's sermon resulted in the addition of 3000 to the new religion I bee added to the apostles and brethren assembled at Pentecost-" continued steadfastly in the apostles' teaching and fellow- ship in the breaking of bread and the prayers." A further statement is that all that believed were together and had all things common And day by day, continuing stedfastly with one accord in the temple and breaking bread at home they did take their food with gladness and singleness of heart, trailing God and having favour with all the people vi hat exactly is meant in the brief record is not quite clear, and for a full exposition of the passage I must refer to the various commentators In the early Church the apostles occupied the most prominent position but we have no evidence that there was any such marked difference in authority between them and some of the converts as is sometimes supposed The apostles abode in Jerusalem while persecution following the death of Stephen scattered the Church They soon be came itinerants visiting some of the Christian communities in different parts, who had been gathered together through the preaching of the scattered brethren preaching the Gospel confirming the believers and establishing churches What the form or order of government of these churches or what the institution is which the converts were required to conform or to which they had to submit, we are not informed Two things only seem plain-that is, that baptism was required as the badge of membership and the Lord's Supper was partaken in every congregation but we have no evidence that these were administered solely by the apostles it does not seem possible for the apostles to have personally baptised the 1000 converts at Pentecost Philip baptised the converts at Samaria. He also baptised the eunuch Ananias baptised Said Paul thanks God that he had only baptised a few persons at Corinth declaring, " Christ sent me not to baptise but to preach the Gospel " No definite constitution was given by Christ to the Church Progressive revelation has characterised God's dealings with man, and the same method appears in regard to the Christian Church Principles are laid down by Christ, but the application of them was left to the apostles and to the followers of Christ It was left for others and other ages to formulate doctrines and define discipline And to-day, as from the very incep- tion of the Church, we are not bound necessarily to follow any precedent, except so far as it may be seen to be scriptural and apostolic Adaptation, and not uniformity characterised the primitive Church Truth must be held with tenacious grip but this is perfectly consistent with variation of ecclesiastical regulations and revision as to the methods of presenting truth The first appointment of officers in the Church was the letting apart the seven who were to attend to the care of the widows and to other duties, so that the apostles might continue steadfastly in prayer and in the ministry of the Word What were the presse duties of these brave officers of the Church is not clear There is no scriptural authority for calling them deacons " nor is it at all certain that the modern idea that they were set apart to mere secular duties is correct. The term itself originally means a minister, and was not restricted to any kind of ministration Some, at least, of the Leven popularly called deacons-were engaged in the work of preaching and publicly addressing the people as notably Stephen and Philip We next find orders coming into prominence They were clearly a different order, or at any rate occupied a different position to the deacons When S they were first appointed, and how, we have no information That they must have been appointed and emigrated to their office by the apostles is manifest, and that they had most important duties allotted to them is evident for we find them associated with the apostles in the direction and government of the Church They sat with the apostles in the first council in Jerusalem Some of the apostles used the term ' elder" applying to themselves John describes himself as "the elder unto the elect lady" or the elder to the beloved Gains " Peter, addressing the churches of Asia Minor, writes " The elders who are among you I exhort, who am a fellow-elder" 1 Here are called by the names "presbyters," "bishops," " overseers," and these terms were undoubtedly used indifferently to describe the same persons, or to designate the same office As to the form of worship, we have sought information in the New Testament Diversity necessarily resulted from the circumstances of the time and place it here persecution raged, secrecy was necessary Private dwellings obscure neighbourhoods, caves and places of sepulture had to be used for worship while the worship itself must have often been of an informal and quiet character Apostolic Christianity had no sacerdotal days it had no hereditary order, as had the Jewish Church All Christians were a " holy priesthood " Every believer, if so inclined, was at liberty, according to his gifts and graces, to take part in the public services of the church, if he could do so to the edification of the Assembly, and without creating disorder The only exception to this was that women were forbidden to take part in the public service, the apostolic Christian Church was a family, of which Christ was the Head He was and is the Prophet and High Priest of and for entire humanity-the Mediator for all mankind Leaving the primitive and apostolic Church of the first century, we pass over the ages, and at the end of 1800 ears we inquire What is the Christian Church of to-day ? Restricting ray remarks to the Protestant Church, how enormous and striking are the differences between the primitive Church and that of the nineteenth century ' W heelier these are in the main such only as naturally arise from the changes in the world during these centuries, and are adapted to the new and ever-varying conditions of rain and circumstances, or whether as some believe Christianity, as it existed and was taught by the apostles, in its power, its appliances, and its spirituality, has been lost, or at any rate largely diminished, I shall not attempt to determine I am, however, compelled to inquire Is it or is it not true that a large portion of the Christian world have so far departed from Christ's authority as that they are virtually without the sacraments which He has ordained, and are deceiving themselves with the erroneous belief that they are true Churches of God, while they are outside, and are left to the on covenanted" morale of Almighty God whatever that may mean? It is claimed that Christ founded His Church in the sense of a visible society that there is a great continuous body-the Catholic Church here it is, none can overlook its visible existence, let us say, from the time when Christianity emerged out of the gloom of the aub apostolic age down to the period of the Reform ation" But the question to be-decided is, What is the nature and character of this " anccoMlon" With the claims of the Korean Catholic Church I do not propose to deal, but those of the Anglican Church, as distinguished from those of the Reformed Church in England and as belonging to one section of that Church, must be briefly stated Dr Hook says "The Church of England maintains the apostolical succession in the preface to her ordina- tion service Those are said to be in apostolical succession who have been sent to labour in the Lord's vineyard b) bishops who were lacerated by bishops who were consecrated by those who, in their turn, were consecrated by others, and those by others, until the derived authority is traced to the apostles, and through them to the Great head of the Church. The apostolical succession of the ministry is essential to the right administration of the holy sacraments The clergy of the Church of England can trace their connection with the apostles by banks, not one of which is wanting, from the times of St. Paul and St. Peter to our own " Canon Liddon argues " Upon a true succession depends the validity of the Eucharist- one chief means of communion with our Lord " " The bishop alone can transmit ministerial power to others " He is the " one teacher within its limits 11, his diocese. In the eye of the Church all the clergy are his substitutes " ' Non-episcopal bodies may have a true baptism, supposing the matter and words of the sacrament to be truly administered " " That which in our belief, and to our sorrow, the non-Episcopal communities lack, is participation in those privileges which depend upon a ministry duly authorised by Christ our Lord and in particular the precious sacrament of His body and blood " What, then, according to these " High Church " claim, is essential to a true Church, and to the validity of Christ's sacraments y The reply is that there can be no true Church to-day which has not a ministry which is ordained by a bishop who is able to trace back his ecclesiastical lineage through other bishops through all the ages to the apostles themselves that "a ministry not episcopal received in invalidating is to say, falls outside the covenanted security " and that, whatever there may be that is scriptural or pious or spiritual m non-bpiscopal Churches, they can have no true ministers and no valid sacraments. YV that answer have we to make to this Are we willing to accept this dictum? Aro me, as a portion of the L Church of C hast, content as ministers to regard our echos, or to be regarded as "Korah, Dachau, and Abram." and as people to be left to the uncover named" "grace" of God? Or do we believe that ourselves, and other non-Epucopal Churches, are true Churches, and that we are true ministers of Jesus Christ I Our reply must necessarily take up over very wide ground, and must, from the nature of the case, be fragmentary and brief 1 must, however, refer you to the very condensed reference to the Church of the apostles which I have already presented to you, and must pens at once to the consideration of the Anglican chain of apostolical succession It will be admitted that Christ founded a Church, in the sense of a visible society," which He clearly designed to be perpetual In the beginning discipleship preceded unification Reception into the brotherhood of Christ's Church was accompanied with some outward sign and pledge of fealty, the converts before Pentecost were disciples only, save the apostles. The converts at and after Pentecost were recognised u members of the Church by their being baptised The Church of England at the Reformation adopted the well-known definition, " I he visible Church of Christ is a congregation of faithful men in which the pure Word of God is preached, and the sacraments duly administered according to Christ's ordinance in all those things that of necessity are requisite to the same " We have next to inquire whether there is any scriptural evidence for the claim of what is called Apostolical Sue cession " What were the qualifications, what the powers of the apostles ? Had they any successors " They were " messengers" sent forth by Christ with a definite ruuMuue. They were His ambassadors to the race which He came to seek and to save. They were restricted in their number, and were called "the Twelve " They were the personal attendants upon Christ, and thus were instructed by Him They were gifted with plenary authority as teachers in regard to faith and morals They had the power of working miracles, and they were witnesses to the facts of the life, teachings, and resurrection of Christ, Now, was it possible that they could have successors i If the twelve apostles were ambassadors, it is evident they could not transmit their powers to others If they were witnesses, that was a qualification which could not be transmitted Whatever else may or may not have been the qualifications of an apostle, it is certain that he must be a personal witness Matthias was elected to fill the vacancy of Judas because he was " a witness with uses r , the apostles of the resurrec- tion " Paul the apostle, born out of due time, was called by Christ, who said to him " For to this end have I appeared unto thee, to appoint thee a minister, and a witness both of the things wherein thou hast seen Me and of the things wherein I will appear unto thee " The apostles had and could have had noauceessor» It is contended that although in their extraordinary qualifications the apostles could have no successors, yet that they were empowered to commit and transmit to others the ordinary gifts which they possessed, and that they did so transmit these gifts and powers to and through special officers who are called "bishops," and that through this order the gifts and powers of the apostles are possessed and exercised to-day by daly consecrated bishop Is there any scriptural evidence of this? Is there evidence of the existence of such an "order" in the records of the Newlesta ment ? We reply Two orders only of ministers are mentioned in the New testament deacons and elders, called indifferently presbytery," "bishops," overseers "-they were different names for the same office As we have seen Peter, though an apostle, calls himself your fellow-elder." John speaks of himself M an elder Paul, when addressing the elders at Ephesus, and committing the care of the Churches to them, exhorts them take heed unto yourselves and to all the flock, in which the Holy Ghost hath made you bishops " Here the same persons are described as elders (presbyters), overseen, bishops, the terms are convertible it is attempted to be shown that Timothy and Titus were bishops in the modern Anglican sense In reply, it may be noted that neither Timothy nor causes called a " bishop" or "presbyter," timothy was to watch in all things, endure afflictions, "do the work of an evangelist, fulfil thy ministry" the late Bishop Lightfoot, one of the ablest scholars of the day, says : "It is the conception of a later age which representa- Timothy as Bishop of Ephesus, and li tug as Bishop of Crete St Paul's own language implies that the position they held was temporary 1 The word bishop {rptsetpu») is never in the New Testament used to signify the office of over- sight over ministers, but only over the flock" of Christ 2. Bishops and elders or presbyters are terms which in the New Testament are common and convertible, meaning the same office This is admitted by all parties i Bishops and pres- bytery are described as possessing the same qualifications, receiving the same ordination, and discharging the same duties. 4 Presbyterian with the apostles on equal terms at the first council in Jerusalem. Had there existed any such order as bishop! in the modern sense, it is inconceivable that they should not have been mentioned 1 timing from Scripture to ecclesiastical history, what is its evidence on this question of undoubtedly Scripture alone can decide the question at Is the still we do not refuse to look at tradition-for in such early ecclesiastical history largely in Jerome (cir 300) says, "In the beginning the churches were I governed by the common council of presbytery ' I " We may show that anciently bishops and presbyters were the same hut by degrees that the plant of discontent might be rooted, al) care was transferred to one The bishops who are put over them should know that they are greater than the presbyters rather by custom than at the appointment of the Lord." On the passage in the teaching of the apostles? , " F feet, therefore for yourselves bishops and deacons worthy of the Lord,' Ac, Bishop Lightfoot says " When our author wrote, ' bishop ' still remained a synonym for 'presbytery,' and the episcopal office, properly so called, had not been constituted in the district in which he lived" Cranmer, Whltpft, Hooker, and others agree with this It will not be necessary to discuss the question as to whether the Apostle Peter was Bishop of Rome, and that he ordained his successor, and from him all the bishops (or popes) are descended in direct line there is no scriptural and very doubtful authority for believing that Peter ever was in Rome, or ever presided over the Church in that city If that could be proved which it cannot-ecclesiastical authority is divided as to who succeeded him But assume, for argument sake, that the first succession of the bishops of Rome were settled yet the frequent subsequent irregularities must have broken many links in the chain (Some of these irregularities were here detailed) It is, however, argued that these irregularities oven plurality of popes at the same time do not invalidate the succession of ordinations, because one who is not a rightful pope may be a true bishop suppose this to be true in Lorrie cases, yet when a pope is excommunicated and deprived of all his ecclesiastical rights, and he is no longer a bishop, if in spite of that he continued to exercise the rights of ordination, such ordination must be invalid, and all subsequent ordinations through that succession must be worthless But further, Gregory XVI was deposed by the Council of Constance, and was declared to be, and to have been for years no bishop yet Henty Chicbeloy, Archbishop of Canterbury, was in 141 ordained by him, and he ordained English bishops and archbishops for 22 years Alexander III wasonooftwo rival Popes who for 20 years reigned at the same time he was three times driven out of Rome, and died in exile in 1180 In 1874 he consecrated Richard Archbishop of Canterbury, who continued to confer ordination for nine years Only the exigencies of time and space prevent many such additional facts as these. Now, by what conceivable theory can orders communicated in cases like these be valid? A Pope is formally deposed by a Plenary Council ho 11 sometimes excommunicated, and declared not to have been a legal Pope during the whole of his popedom or anti-popedom yet during the whole of the time he has been conferring episcopal orders Since such lapses and breaks have frequently occurred in the ' uninterrupted succession," at many different periods in the history of the Church, it is abundantly evident that there is not a single bishop priest, or deacon in the Anglican Church who can trace his " spiritual descent to the apostles " The case becomes still stronger when we look at another phase of the question Baptism is necessary to church membership , but, so far as can be ascertained. Archbishop Tillotson was never baptised, nor did he receive deacon'! or priest's orders by episcopal ord nation Baptism by non-epiacopally ordained ministers II by the Anglican! regarded as invalid, yet the celebrated Bishop Butler was baptised by a non-episcopal minister How could the ordinations of such prelates be valid F I have made no reference to the immoral character of many of the popes as invalidating their every relates! act Can it be conceivable that the Holy Spirit would convey the influence! through a channel of such moral pollution as must have been if that channel has been through the bishops and popes of Rome i Let those believe it who can , I cannot But it is held by some Anglican authorities that the line of apostolical succession does not need to be traced through Rome, but comes from the apostles directly through the ancient British Church that, in fact, the Church of England is not an offshoot from the Roman Catholic Church at the Reformation, but is an original Church, of and from the apostles I am inclined to hold this view, and think there is abundant evidence to show that the British Church in the original of the present English Churches that though it submitted sometimes per- force-to the Church of Rome and largely adopted its doctrines and discipline, yet it was never a vassal it continually resisted many. of the claims made upon it, and at the Reformation did not separate and form a new Church, but simply thrust out the Church against whose usurpation it had protested and to which it had never voluntarily submitted but this is a subject too large to be more than incidentally mentioned the identity of ' presbytery" and "bishops" during the apostolic age is not now disputed but we have to inquire when did Episcopacy, in the modem sense, arise, and how Did the nature " bishop," as an order differing from and superior to press tors, take place during the lives of the apostles or did it occur later? Bishop I Lightfoot recognises that germs of Erisco pacy me to be found in the original Church at Jerusalem, and that from this centre the system spread throughout the Roman empire The Canadian epistles (cir 100), the Clementine homilies, and the Apostolic constitutions say that James was the first Bishop of Jerusalem These documents are of very doubtful authority The Clementine and Constitution are probably of the third century or some of them later It is argued that James presided over the first council at Jerusalem but this would prove no more than that by common consent he was elected as president for the purposes of order Clearly he was no localised diocesan Gal ii, f, will show that he was an itinerant, and had a mission to those of the ' circumcision in general, and, as he says in his epistle, " to the twelve tribes scattered abroad " It is argued that there is evidence to prove that from the apostles' times bishops alone exercised the right of ordination, confirmation, and other acts, which showed that they were a distinct and higher order than pres- byers Is this so " that originally the right of ordination was exercised by presbytery is evident. St Paul, though an apostle, received his credentials! as an accredited minister from Antioch Those who laid hands upon him and Barnabas are called ' ' prophets and teach era "There is no evidence that they themselves had received any ordination-mostlikely not- vetthevlaidtheir hands upon Paul and Barnabas, and sent them on their mission When some called in question the validity of his claim to apostle ship, Paul appealed to the effects of his ministry as his credentials. " If I be not an apostle to orders, I am to you for the fruit of mine apostleship are 50 in the Lord " That ordination by presbyters in scriptural is plain from 1 him by , 14, where Paul writes to Timothy, Neglect not the gift that is in thee, which was given thee by prophecy with the laying on of the hands of the presbytery " And there is no discrepancy between this and the statement in i Tim 4, 7, where Paul exhorts him to stir up the gift of God which is in thee through the laying on of my hands " This shows the apostle was associated with others in the laying on of hands, and three others were the presbytery Firtnillian year. 220), Bishop of Cujtarea, makes this emphatic declara- tion, "All power and grace are established in the Church where the elders preside who possess the power both of baptising and of imposition of hands, and of ordaining leviathans words explain this when he says, " In the ecclesiastical courts approved elders reside, not distinguished by their opulence, but worth of character " Lutychius, Patriarch of Alexandria, expressly affirmed "that the 12 presbytery constituted by Mark upon the vacancy of the See did choose out of their number one to be head over the rest, and the other eleven did lay their hands upon him and blessed him, and made him their patriarch." The conclusions to which we are brought may be stated as follows, viz - 1\. That something like diocesan bishops gradually grew up during the latter part of the second century, and during the third century the presiding presbytery, by that time exclusively called bishops, were recognised as a separate order, and this has continued with the F pis copal Churches to the present time 1. While antiquity may be fairly pleaded for diocesan Episcopacy, no tariff ctent argument has been adduced to show that it was ordained by Christ or He apostles, or that it is essential to a true Church, or necessary to the validity of Christian ordinances. J Diocesan Episcopacy is of ancient, but not of apostolic authority an early, but not the earliest form of church order But " an uninterrupted succession of babies from the time of the apostles to the present is not only without Scripture warrant, but is also without evidence to support it, and is rendered absolutely impossible through irregularities and breaks which have taken place so frequently in the consecration of Romish popes and English prelates 4 As a mode of church order and government, pts company had a high claim to be recognised because of its antiquity and its adaptability to certain states and conditions of Christendom but the demand of the Anglican clergy, that it only in the true order, without which there can be no real Church, and no valid sacrament!, is not supported by evidence from Scripture, or ecclesiastical or other his- tory-is, in fact, impious and absurd a There is a true apostolical succession, a succession which does not depend upon any mere act of a bishop, or any number of bishops, a succession of apostolic doctrine, discipline, zeal, and devotion and this exists in all the branches of the Catholic Church where these characteristics are found, whether the church order be Episcopalian, or Presbyterian, or Connexional, or Congregational A chain is no stronger than its weakest link We have tested this chain of apos- to heal succession." and have found that the very first link Peter or the apostles milling. Along the chain, every here and there, links are broken or are missing. It is neither fastened to the " Rock, Christ Jesus," nor are all its links welded one to the other. Scriptural, apostolic ally, and historically it is defective and worthless " 1 he uninterrupted succession is a fable "What is the position of the Methodist Church and its relation to the Catholic Church of Christ? John Wesley began his public life at a High Church- man, holding the Divine right of Episcopacy, the sacerdotal theory of episcopal ordained clergymen, and baptismal regeneration. He was suddenly called to face the problem of lay preaching. Spite of the first shock to his ecclesiasticism, he not only admitted the scriptural validity of preaching on the part of un- | ordained men, but used them in his widely-scattered societies, and made their employment a most important part of his system It is not too much to say that but for its la) (or local) preacher Methodism could never have been what it in to-day and, further, that it can never retain its position without the continued employment and generous recognition of this most valuable and scriptural agency Adopting great fire gular'ties of church order yet Mr J Seeley never could persuade himself that he was separating from the Church He declared over and over again that he would only leave the Church of England when driven out He remained to his death an Episcopalian and a clergyman of the Church of England Yet he acknowledges that the Methodists, were being driven out " in the most cruel manner " be early as 1740 he was con y inced that in the primitive Church bishops and priests (or presbytery) wore the same order, and that originally every ( Christian Church was made pondent of all others From this he reached the conclusion that he, as a presbytery, had a scriptural right to ordain, and be accordingly exercised that right (in 17M) in regard to his societies in America, calling those whom he ordained superin- tendents," which he acknowledged to be the same as bishops both the town being ecclesiastically synonymous with "presbyter" He thus laid the foundation of the Methodist Episcopal! Church of America Before his death he went still further and ordained some of his preachers in Lett and as presbytery A final stop was his executing the deed of declaration (in 1784), by which the conference was legally defined, its powers and duties set forth, and its perpetuation provided for constituting, in fact, an act of separation from the Anglican Church which was to take effect after his death -After Mr Wesley s death there followed the demand for the administration of the sacra- ments, the holding public worship in " church hours," resulting in the Plan of Pacification in 179 the ordination of ministers by the imposition of hands by press byers in 1835, and, as was reasonable the usages and responsibilities of a branch of the Catholic Church Sin his development was the natural and necessary evolution from the principles which Mr Wesley finally held and which were loyally accepted by his " societies U first all the variables of the Methodist societies were regarded by Mr Wesley as members of the Church of England, and their reception into or exclusion from his societies did not interfere with their Church membership Most it not all of them had been baptised in the Church of England, and were more or less identified with it Three generations have passed since Mr Wesley's death At least two of these have never been associated with any Church but Methodism In no sense can they be regarded as members of any other denomination than it and to-day have to do with the fact that there are tens of thousands who regard the Methodist Church as their ecclesi- astical and we trust spiritual home in the Methodist " Connexion in a position to afford them this home v Are we able to offer to them the ministra- tions and sacraments of Christ's Church ? or are we acting towards them under false pretences, professing to be a Scriptural Church, and conforming to Christ's laws while all the time we are usurpers and deceivers of the people If what I have previously proved it true, we can answer these questions without hesitation The non-episcopal character of Methodist Church government and of the ordination of its ministers in no degree whatever invalidates its claims to be a branch of the one "Catholic and Apostolic Church of Christ It rightly claims to be " a congregation of faithful men in which the pure Word of God is preached, and the sacraments duly ad ministered according to Christ's ordinance in all things that of necessity areroquuitototho same " It has the four marks of the Church of the Apostles It holds and formulates the Apostles' teaching," it maintains Christian brotherly fellowship, it is steadfast in its observance of the breaking of bread in the I ord's Supper, and it enjoins and practices the duty of prayer Difference of opinion will exist as to the precise Church order and organisation which is maintained amongst us but I presume that there is no doubt that we possess all the essentials I have mentioned of a true Church The Methodist Church exhibits the marks of the Apostolic Church The orders of its ministers are scriptural its discipline will bear the scrutiny of severest criticism, its right to exist is abundantly evidenced by its usefulness to the world. Our answer to those who examine us in this Have we not power to adapt our ecclesiastical organisation undid the Apostles andpnmi five Christians ? Has the Anglican or the Roman such a prerogative as that they alone can so depart from primitive and apostolic usage, or that they can claim a divine right for Episcopacy ? Personating the Church which for the moment I represent-our final answer to, ' said not an apostle Are not ye my work in the Lord ? If to others I am not an apostle yet at least I 2in to you for the seal of mine apostleship are ye in the Lord" What is the future to be? is the prayer of the world's Redeemer ever to be answered, " That they may all be one even as thou Father, art in Me and I in Thee that they also may be in us that the world may believe that Thou didst send Me" Not so long at the divided sections of the Christian Church are hostile to each other not so long as the Anglican Episcopalian un- churches the non-episcopal denominations, and the non-episcopal sections, in their turn, remain divided from each other not so long as mere difference of Church government and discipline divide the members of the Methodist family into separate and antagonistic camps, instead of merging their differences and uniting as one phalanx of the army of God against sin, and for the promotion of holiness not so long as conditions of membership that neither Chnatnor His Apostles insisted upon are demanded as tests by any section of the Catholic Church not until Episcopalian and Presbyterian and Congregationalist and Methodist agree to shake hands, and to accept each other's orders " of ministry as scriptural and valid, and to join in one grand army of the living God I venture to assert my belief that the extreme and unscriptural claims of the Anglican clergy regarding the so-called uninterrupted apostolical succession" and the Divine right of 1- episcopacy, and their refusal to acknowledge as true ministers of Christ those who have not received Episcopal ordination, is to-day, more than any single fact, responsible for the divisions of Protestant Christendom and that next to that, the divided-and in many respects antagonistic-positions acquired and maintained towards each other by the Methodist Churches stand in the way of the fulfilment of the prayer of the Redeemer. If I have said nothing respecting the spiritual character and work of the church and its organisation, it it not because I under- rate its importance, but because the recognition of Its importance makes it unnecessary to an audience like this-to dwell upon it All that I could say to you respecting the need of a renewed baptism of Pentecost-and more goes without saying Brethren, I feel that we meet to-day under the yy eight of most solemn responsibilities as a true branch of the " One Catholic and Apostolic Church of Christ, the deliberations and decisions of the conference must have a wide and important influence not only upon those who are members and adherents of Methodism, but upon the practical Christianity of our land Brethren, we are face to face with sin and vice, with intemperance and sensuality, with worldliness and luxury, with agnosticism and secularism, with indifference and want of spirituality, with the substitution of call is for conversion, with greed for gain and with grinding poverty, with a brood of evils which are certainly gathering strength from year to year What are we doing to fight this legion ' What are we doing to reach the masses and permeate share with the Christianity of Christ ' What is the Methodist Church doing' God for bad that I should disparage the multitudes amongst us who, in various ways, are loyally and devotedly working for the salvation of men, for the good of the world, for the glory of God, never perhaps, in numbers, in devotedness and effectiveness, have they been exceeded, if e healed But are we satisfied ' Let us review our position let us look out intelligently upon the divided those who profess to be Christians let us see if we cannot, by wise and heaven directed legislation help to heal some at least of those divisions let us strive to gather into and consolidate the numbers who, in our own section of the Church, stand upon the outskirts Bad bring them into our ranks, where they can effectually promote their own religious life and take their places on the side of Christ as his servants and soldiers The voting for president then took place, with the following result -dev W Clarke 3, Rev.

There were many matters which would demand the attention and best judgment of the conference He referred to the all-important question which affected the basis of church member in, their work in the Pacific, and the proposed new mission to New Guinea He was sure that though on these and other important questions they could not hope to be of one mind, they would be of one heart. He was glad that their unity was so complete and so thorough The question uppermost in the minds of men in the political world to-day was that of federation, and such a federation as was contemplated was the devout wish of every patriotic Australian. That federation they had been drastically, they were bound together by the bonds of their church constitution and by the common purpose of spreading Scriptural holiness throughout the land (Applause ).
