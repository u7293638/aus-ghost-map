GRAKD EIFLE MATCH. -ro THB EDITOR OP THE EEGISTSB. Sir— An you inserted my laet growl I am induced to fiwour you with another. I thought fteiNaiianal Bifle Association was got up for «ha onnnnmaompnt of volunteers, and there fore ribscribed to its funds. To my surprise and disgust, and that of every other volunteer except the Free Bines, I find that there is not the ghost of a chance for any volunteer r-winning more than one prize j the others will be taken by those few who are wealthy enough $o purchase weapons superior to the Enfields, I although they may be worse shots. Again, the I volunteer prize is to be shot for in any position, I which I do not think right, as many cannot j afford to buy ammunition for private practice, I and therefore should be allowed to fire for at I least one prize in the position taught them by I their instructors. I hope this list of prizes I trill be reconsidered and altered, as it is mani festly unfair to those who, like myself, have spent some -£25 in cash and an immense I amount of time in perfecting themselves in the use of the Government weapon, and who are not inclined to lay out £25 more in the pur chase of a superior one. I am, Sir, Sec., JOHN SMALL.
