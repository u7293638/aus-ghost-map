The production of the drama of 'The Cor-'1 sicaa Brothers'' by the management at the Hpyal at this dull season of v tho theateical' year , was the ; . result .. of a /very happy thought;! and it seems -: likely . that thei piece will, catvj the ; management veiy . comfortably into tho .'Easter holidays. It has been splendidly mpuntb'd, ancj.in; this respeot leaves nothing whatevor to be wished; for. . Were I to say; I had not seen it .very much bettor acted, I - should ? certainly be trespassing very nearly on the confines of truth 1 I like Mr Vincent's '.Brothers only itt some parts. His groat fault;', is that .'he fails' to draw any. dislinction; between Fabienand Louis. He' endows ; b6th . with the same: life ; nelthbr with' a life aiid! character of his own.' Thus the 'islander,' Fabien, is asi polished, an individual, ininus the white' tiej patont ? leather boots and kids,- as the Louisi who like, a good and dutiful young fool poui'3 out his heart's blood for the sake of a woman who daesn't care a rush for, fiim, and whose conduct, to say the least of it,; is rather shady.- It is in the last aot that Mr Vincent is seen to tho best advantage ; for hero ho throws off the apathetio listlessness which marked his acting in' the two first acts.'
