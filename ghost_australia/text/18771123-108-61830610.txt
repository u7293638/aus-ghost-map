0 * PORTFOLIO. When we think of God's,right to?,exact obedience and'then ?think, ofj ou?r, works, low, ought we to rejoice wh.en .e read. in the Bible, or, arc. toild by..the voice of God's priet iib the service of HisChureh, "'that ifiany .ian sin, we have an advocate i?ith the Father, Jesuc s Christ the'righteous, anid:Ie is thile propitiatiou for. our, sius:(' to. knowithat if ?we have, faith in Christ, and really. strive to obey Him in all things, H-isinflite merits will fill up,.all the im perfections of our service; and that the Hol0y Spirit,is ever ready to assist the true believer, and faithful follower, of: Christ. But let us recollect, whilst we thus rejoice in these thirigs, that they are the privileges of the'real. Christian, and that sincerity, the real downright intention and endea vour to obey, is as necessary now as it ever was, as it always will and must be. Imperfect obedience, the fruit of sincere faith, will be accepted and rewarded with a great reward; but deliberate disobe dience, deliberate rejection of one of the least of Christ's. commands, known and acknowledged as Hiis, will be punished. The religion of Christ is a religion merci fully suited to a fallen nature, and, to a certain extent, mercifully indulgent to that weakness of human nature which it alone can strengthen. It isnot a licence to sin-God forbid that we should so blas pheme-it is not a religion for hypocrisy, no, nor even for coldness, but for sincerity, for warm affection for God and man, for constant prayer and hearty endeavour. And though in many things we offend all, yet is our religion,a thing of power. All of us may receive power to come nearer, far nearer, to exact and perfect obedience to the will of God than was ever possible for man without that full measure of the presence of the Holy Ghost which Christ purchased for his Church.-R?ev. T. K. Arnold.
