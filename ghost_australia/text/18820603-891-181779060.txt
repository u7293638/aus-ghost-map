HINTS ON ETIQUETTE. 'Excuse me, gentlemen I' said a young lady, < ^ entering oar annctnm,' bat which oae of you ai J"ia the society editor ?' * ;i ■.■f. .'.We don't keep one on this paper, Miis,' :- : ie t&id; the horse cxitic, ' bat the whole gang take ,s a orack at that style of journalistic labour once a'while. Is there anything we can do for '. yon T * I was goiog to ask/ said the girl, 'if it would be too much trouble for you to giro me . ..come hints as to the proper way to receivo .-J goeets at a wedding, how the sopper Bhould be served, and so forth ? 1 Yon wan't to know what if en riggle and ^ rechercby, as the French bhj?' remarked the hone man. 'We can give you tbo correct . pointer* Are you the blushing bride f* ; ' Yes, sir,'said the girl in a rather weak t - .voice;, 'that is—* '-J/,.'Oh, I understand!' said the hone editor. j 4I appreciate your feelings. I was once young., . and pashful myself. Now, about this wedding 1 the receiving part is easy. After the' nuptial I ceremony is concluded, yon and Mike— I : ' But his name ida't :Hike I' said the: young lady; 4;hUname iBrrr -i .;; -■■ ; 'Ohl.Ilraovr.all abont that/ said the equine journalist. ■ ';Of course hia name is Adalbert, or fleginald, > or soma otber dry goods clerk boneense,: bat in giving advice ' we always allude to tbesuoker us Mike, and call tho bride Hannah. It saves time. Now, after you and Mike, lire married, you want to jog, along home and plant yourself at tho back ond of the •parlour." Better havo a floral boll, or some thing like that, to stand under, because it is | considered tbe correct thing, and makes a better toot, ensemblo, as the French say. Then tho. guests they, get in line, and go by yon in a slow walk—a kind of we- bnried*him<sadly*&t;>dead* of night clip—and you shako hands with eaoh one and say "Thank?," awfully, and they look' at you and Hike as if you were a couple of prize cattle, and feel Borry for you.*' •* * And tho supper V said the young lady. \- * Oh, yes; the sapper! "Well, at some wed* dings thoyfred in the dining , room, and at others each guest sits on a chair and has his lunch brought to him. Now, I always advise* tho use of chopped feed at weddings—bring'on the bam and sand riches and iee cream at; the same time. They can't eat the-sandwiches first, you know, because if they do tho cream will melt, and if they throw in the cream : to start with, the sandwiches will act like Bahquo's ghost—" they will not get down!" *.. And the horse reporter winked vigorously at the dramatio critic in order to attract tho attention of that person to his able joke.. But the critic was trying to smoke a cigar that the advance agent of tho While had given him, and he' did not look. 'Of course/ continued the. bio*, .grapber of Goldsmith's Haid,.'it ..would be better if you could givo .each guest a box' stall and throw the feed in early in the evening, but this is not often practicable, so you had better keop oa the old racket i' ' I am sure I am very thankful, 6ir, for . the" interest yon have taken in this matter/ said tho girl,,'and I shall follow your advice.; Which is the way downstairs, please?* :'There'are two .ways/, replied the hotte. reporter, 'you can jump down the hatchway or 'take, the stairs. Utir elevator never runs.'— 'Jraencan-Jraper.
