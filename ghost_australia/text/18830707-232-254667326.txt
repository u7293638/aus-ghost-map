" FAITHLESS LILT. Oh I my Lily's proved false, and my poor heart broke, I roam up and down like a ghost, man; When I think of my rival, I'm ready to choke The sneaking young scamp—he's a postman 1 I loved Uly fair, with her eyes violet blue, And her lips they were ever my boast, man, So bewitchingly shaped and so ruby in hue— Never meant to be kissed by a postman 1 Her rich golden hair was a picture to see, It was nature's gift, free from all cost, man; Her ankle was neat as an ankle could be— May her foot kick .that rascally postman! Oh. Lily, sweet darling! how could yon so stray? You've been wayward, and now I'm a lost maj Twas a " bob™ you misspent on that fatal day When you advertised straight'ior a postman. B.M.K.
