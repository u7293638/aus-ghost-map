The Advertiser THURSDAY, AUGUST 22, 1878. PROCEEDINGS IS PARLIAMENT. WEDNESDAY, AUGUST 21. In the legislative Council A message was received from the House of Assembly notifying that they had agreed to the Council's amendments in the Copyright Bill. A motion was agreed to Car the MjoanuaflSK of the Council till Tuesday nest, through the continued absence of tbe Chief Seenkary in Victoria. I*«ve of absence was scanted to tits Hon. W. Duffield Cor a fortnight, on tne sroandof 01 -health. TOu> OouneU adjoorned at BJBS tiUTaeslay nest. In the House of Assembly— A fortnight's leave of absence was granted to Mr. Bright. air. Wabd's motion far a reform of the con stitution of tbe Legislative Oouaoil was de bated, and Uie debate adjourned for a month. Motions for school returns, report on the management of the Vletorian consolidated fund. Customs retains, and a polling place at Stirling East were agreed to. Tke Kensington and Norwood Boundaries Bill was read a. second time and passed Mroogh Committee. The House adjourned at 3.45 pjn. till nest day. Mb. Wabd was once more to the fore on Wednesday in the Aasembiy, when ha in troduced his motion for reforming the Upper House by *"?I'"tr ** liable to dis solution in the same way as the Assembly is. The honorable member did not com mence his address in a hopeful spirit. Success within anythiur like a brief period was more than he expected, bat he was anriou? to place hie acheme before the country while tie 20,000 electora of whom be has agdbesn in so calm and conciliatory a spirit are engaged inoon tidering which four men out of those who .- re soliciting their suffrages they wOl in trust with their interests in these critical times. While Mr. W«A took it for granted, and perhaps not unreasonably, that tbe ABsemUy would not adopt his «*fif i be deprecated the hostility with wbjcb car tain writers treated any project proposed by him. Who those writers are we of course are unable to ny, bat we will presume die hon. gentle man did not refer to us. We treat every legislative proposition upon its merit*, and should certainly not be prujodiosd against any ucheme becaoae it originated with tbe senior member for Giunencha. air. Ward is one of the great delight* of journalistic existence in this colony Though be is not a man either of infinite jest or infinite variety, yet there is such a daring extravagance in many of bis utterances, so grotesque eelf-appradation pervading bis pa'lk deportment, and in the attitude be assumes in debate, so sublime a superiority to any weak deference to great men ordinarily acknowledged as authorities upon the subjects regarding which he discoones, that he really forms quite a psychological study. The Assembly would sometimes LeduilwitboutMr.Ward,forthoughttisnot ; always that the members can langa with him, he seldom foils to giro them abao dant occasion to laugh at him. We notice that now a little of the bitterness with which he has been accostomed to regard the daily Proas of Sooth Australia is transferred to Adam Smith and John Stuart MOL Mr. Ward was at them again on Wednesday, when he ■areas- ; tically suggested that these two deceased gentlemen did not write for South Aus tralia, and that we should be able to devise a remedy for our constitutional troubles without reference to either of diem. Pro bably our constitutional reformers will not consult Adam Smith upon the question of I^egislative Council reform, as it hardly faQs within the scope of the works by which the great political economist is beat known. Mr. Ward's scheme for preventing dead locks and bringing the tipper House more into harmony with tbe wishes of tbe people ac expressed through the popular branch of the Legislature has the merit of sim plicity. The Assembly is dissolved when it misconducts itself, and why should sot the Council be treated in a similar manner ? Unfortunately Mr. Ward in taking this ground exhibits a considerable amount of inconsistency. Comparing bis past speeches \ respecting tbe conductor tbe Upper House with his address on Wednesday the con clusion is irresistibly forced upon us that, to use a homely phrase, " his talk isn't hang together." But a few mouths ago, in Par liament and out of it, he asserted with all the fiery vehemence of which he is capable that the great question at issue was whether the twenty thouaa&d; electors should prevail over tbe forty thousand. Now if this really is the question, it is uot simply tbe Upper House but also its constituency that is to be eofl^uetwl or reformed. What on earth would be the use of sending Councillors to their electors because of disagreements with the As sembly if those electors side with their representatives and return them to renew the warfare? The fact is, however, that the Upper Rouse constituency wQI rarely or never be found at issue with the mote numerous electorate; the evil has been that the Councillors have been practically irresponsible towards those who elected them, bave turned a deaf ear to their remonstrances, and treated their petitions with ridicule and contumely. That these members of tbe Upper House should feel that the* owe some respect to the voice of the country, and that for con tinued obstructiveness a day of reckoning must come, would tend to improve the relations existing between the two Cham bers and prevent wanton or foolish hindrance* to wise and necessary legis lation. Thb object, however, might be attained without resorting to so whole sale and sweeping a scheme as that of dissolving the Upper House whenever it may be at issue with a Ministry com manding a majority in the other branch of tbe Legislature. To carry out the objects of. « bicameral system it is essential that the two Chambers should be different in their constitution; that one should sot be merely or almost a reflex of the other. The members of the House that is to check hasty legislation and keep cool whik storms are raging about them, need to have a longer and a securer tenure wf their seats than is enjoyed by the representatives of manhood suffrage. The Second Chamber is designed to gin the people, when it is desirable, time to think, aai it would be altogether incon sistent with this principle to give a Minis try power to tend the Council to the country whenever it was opposed to the popular wish of the boor. Without expressing unqualified approval of the Government scheme for refimning the Council, few people will fail to admit that it is infinitely more moderate, reasonable, and practicable than that <rf the member for Gnmeracha. Mr. Ward has not yet forgiven the Council for iu treatment of Sir Henry last session which led to the break-up of Urn Coltoa Ministry. That conduct, said Mr. Ward "in a fair and unexaggerating spirit," and not with any party feeling, was "treasonable is the bjgheatdegiwa." In taking the conduct of the public business out of the hand* of the Chief Secretary the Councillor, wen «guilty of as absolute act of treason—a* much an act of treason as if be were that day to plant the standard of rebellion in King William-street." We need hardly say that this glorious rhadMaoatade threw tbe House into convulsions of laughter. The Attorney-OeaeraL in his pleasant way, suggested that the "nnex aggerating" orator should try the standard busiaeasand see what Che result waul 1 be. Loyal as the citizens ere, they would wel come auch an entertaining spectacle. Mr. Ward may safely oaks die eKMtimeat; it would be vastly diverting, aatd the can eaqoenees would not be very aerioas to tke country or even to himself.

His Lordship Dr. Reynolds officiated on the occasion. The young lady who made her pro fession is the daughter of Mr. P. McNamara, J.P., Anama. A large number of the clergy, including the Right ver. Abbot Alcock. O.S. B., the Revs. F. Byrne, V.G., Archdeacon Russell, Tappeiner, S.J., Ryan, Church, Byrne, Hennessy, and O'Sullivan, and many of the leading members of the Catholic laity were present. After the religious ceremony the nuns hospitably entertained His Lordship and the clergy and laity who witnessed the pro ceedings. The Wallaroo Times of August 12 men >■ Hods that" a man named John Pells, commonly known as 'Happy Jack' was brought into TTadiiut on Monday evening by Messrs. Hall mod Henderson, farmers, of Green's Plains, ha ■■ Slaving been found by them on the road about -■one or five miles from Kadina, suffering from injuries received in a quarrel. Pells had been brought np at the Police Court, Kartina, in ' the morning and fined for drunkenness. He was proceeding to Green's Plains, accom panied by his wife in a waggon driven by a man named Tom Harrop. It appears that on the way a dispute arose and a quarrel ensued, when Pells was thrown oat of the waggon or ■ otherwiso illtreated. The unfortunate fellow, who was suffering excruciating pain, was taken to Giflney's Hotel, where he was attended to by Dr. Go?se, who, after mating a careful utmiiii.. tinn, ordered him to be sent to the Wallaroo n«^r" ■■ from a rupture of the bladder caused by a kick. Harrop has been arrested, and was brought to Kaflina yesterday afternoon. On making in -quiries we learn that there is little hope enter tained of Pells'recovery. Harrop will bsbrought <\- *rp at the Police Court, Kadina, to-day, charged Trith the assault." An accident of a curious but serious nature occurred on the premises occupied by Mr. .Alex. Hay, jeweller, and Mr. G. H. M«mtn g> photographer, King William-street, on Tuesday might, August 21. On Wednesday morning on futnrilig his shop Mr. Hay was surprised to find the place cempletely flooded with water,and on . making enquiries he found tint Mr. M?ntiing whose rooms are situated above the shop, had been having them renovated. On Tuesday even ing Mr. Manning left a woman cleaning up the premises. In the "dark room" there is a tap and sink. The woman, it appears, when leaving left this tap running, and the plug-hole became stopped up with dirt. The water \- soon made its way over the sides of the sink and on to die floor, which it penetrated through -in large quantities. The damage sustained by Mr. Hay is considerable. A large case stocked with silver and electroplated good were saturated from top to bottom, whilst the counter cases, which contained a large assortment of gold and \- silver watches, earrings, and brooches were per fectly swamped. The exact amount of the loss lias not yet been estimated, as it chiefly depends on Hie labor which will be entailed in cleaning and repairing the different articles. Mr. Man ning's damage was trifling beyond the incon venience of tie soaked carpets and floors. Respecting the defence of the Australian \- colonies the London correspondent of the Mel bourne-Age, telegraphing on August 16, says: — " **Sir William Jervois, on his return to England, \- after he had concluded his inspection of the Australian colonies for the purpose of suggest ing an o?ifagnt defence scheme, was consulted ' by the Ti«ip?™i Government as to his views upon tbe Australian defence question. Sir -William Jervois has intimated to the Imperial Government that no Australian system of de fence by land can be made complete unless \- some central inlaid locality, connected with the capitals of Victoria, South Australia, and New South Wales, by railway, be chosen as the site for an arsenal, hi which all monitions of war, with the exception of, perhaps, guns, \- could be manufactured, and where all necessary material could be stored. It is understood that Wentworth, on the River Darling, has been recommended for the purpose of a central depot, and the suitability of its position is based upon the fact that it is the point at which the Victorian, South Australian and New South Wales railway extensions will meet. If the Australian Governments agree to the proposal. R is believed that the Imperial Go vernment will also give their assent to its adoption." Hie anniversary services of the Wesleyaa Church, Wallaroo Mines, were held on Bnnday -and Monday, August 18 and 19. On Bnnday sermons were preached by the Rev&fW.; Dimwit, ->S. T. Withington. and D. O'DonueU, of Norwood. The fPallarao Times states that -'the -services were well attended, especially in the evening, when the church' was filled to over flowing. On Monday, at half- past 4 o'clock, a pubfic tea was held, which was well patronised by *r?~i« from the difierent churches. The pubbo mentmg was commenced by the Rev. J. W. Monlanfl giving out the hymn, 'My God, the spring of all my joys.' The Rev. S. T. Withington engaged in prayer, after which he introduced Captain Anthony to preside over -tbe mnrtang. The Chairman having made * few remarks, Mr. White read the Treasurer's leport, from which it appeared that the income bad been £153 4s. Bd_; expenditure, £138 7s. lOd. During the year £50 bad been paid off the principal. The present debt on the church was £538 3s. 4d. The meeting was then addressed by the Bev. J. W. Mooiand, on the "Church's prosperity;" and by the Rev. W. Diment on "Successes and failures.'' The Bev. D. O'Donnell then spoke for an hour with fervid eloquence on *• Chris tianity and its triumphs;'' and at its close re ■aervpd the merited plaudits of the meeting. During the evening the choir rendered selections of music. Tbe usual votes of thanks having been passed, the Bev. S. T. Withingtoa closed -the nweting by pronouncing the benediction." A large and influential meeting of farmers was held at the house of Mr. J. Meen, Yan yarrie, on August 12, to take into consideration -which route for tbe proposed Pkhirichi and Terowie railway would benefit the greater number of farmers. Mr. ft. Brumby, who took the chair, said the meeting was called on account -of the deputation sent by theMorchard pesple *o wait upon the Commissioner of Public Works, urging the Government to take the line through their township. He felt gratified at seeing so many farmers present, as ft showed the interest they took in the matter. He be lieved the line through Enrelia would be of far more bawfit to the majority of farmers than the one via Morchard. as there were thoasands of acres of splendid agricultural land lying to the east and north-east of Yanyarrie which would •oon be open for selection. Mr. King moved— "That it is the opinion of this meeting tha tte proposed railway from Terowie to Picbi xicbi Ktuwia take the eastern side o ■the range, as it would serve tbe greate number of farmers." Seconded by Mr. Hoare. Mr. ;McNangbton, who supported the mottoa, ctated that tbe whole of the Hundred of Tan yarrie was taken np at a high figure in the -expectation that a railway would come within « short distance, while the greater part of the Hundred of Coomooroo was taken up at £1 per Mn. The motion was carried unanimously. Mr.{McXaughton moved—-"That a deputation^ consisting of Messrs. Brumby, Ghrimes, and King, be requested to attend the meeting held «t Walloway on August 14."

" This is scarcely the season," says the Soulh-EaslernSUcr, aat which newspaper readers «zpect to meet with snake stories, nor agricul turalists to receive injuries from the progeny of that wise one who eo excited the curiosity of Mother Eve as to make her eat the forbidden fruit and 4?nfa«l upon mankind the necessity of incurring tailors' bilk; yet even in these chill ing days of August his enakesliip has mani fested himaolf, end that to a resident of this district in a painful manner. la the hot weather which succeeded last harvesting opera tion* Mr. E. Boneham, of Kalangadoo, became aware that a haystack upon bis premises har bored a snake, and several ineffectual attempts wexe made to dislodge the reptile. As time wore on and wintry weather prevailed nnHiing snore was thought of the matter. On Thurs day, August 15, however, Mr. W. T. Bone bam, « young man about 19 years of age, and son of the proprietor, was in the act of witting out a portion of the Btaek for forage purposes when he was suddenly bitten on his ten knee by the snake. Mr. Boneham, eeiL, who wag at once informed of the ciremnstance, MMDediately tied a tight bandage above the vo?na, aade an incision into the flesh where it *** ?een bitten, sucked the poison, exploded a lew grains of gunpowder upon the c^flftd P??«e> ana with as little delay as possible drove ™*?n ttto Gambierton and consulted Dr. **—?*• 3** marks of the fangs of the snake atthewound,but the proper remedies having been applud the patient was soon out rf danger. He is not expected to Buffer any farther inconvenience fcam tns mishap, but Dr. Jaetoon recommends that in all cases of snake bite ihe bitten flesh should be cut cWout We regret to say that the snake which bit Mr •K"«m*W™, jun-, madrgonrt its retreat." "We know of no more disgraceful act of negligence," aaya the Smth-Easterx. Star, "than that of the Government of South Australia ia leaving a shipping port like Bivoli Bay, with a township at each aid, so long without tele graphic flfuffwinninatinn. At every recurrence of stormy weather the safety of the shipping at Bivoli Bay is a matter of the greatest anxiety, and as, aince the settlement of an agricultural population on the reclaimed lands about Millicent the port has become one of embar kation for a considerable number of travellers to the city, the want of knowledge as to the arrival and departure of the steamers is a cause of great inconvenience. A corres pondent has sent us some particulars of the annoyance caused to about 19 passengers who arrived at the Biy Jan the 9th inst., intending to take their pas sages for Adelaide on the strength of an announcement that the Coorong would leave on that day, but who were kept waiting until Tuesday without any information as to the whereabout* of the mining steamer. Certainly the manager of the Company is not fees from blame, but there would have been nocanse for complaint if the 15 miles between Greytown and MObcent had been bridged by the electric wire. We fancy that since the invention of the tele graph no such absurdity has before existed as that of constructing a railway to a port be fore connecting that port with the telegraph system of the country, and yet this is the case with Bivoli Bay. The platelayers are at work on the line of railway, the tenders for goods sheds have been accepted, and as yet there is no sign of a telegraph. It is true that a sum of £200 has been placed upon the estimates fora Post and Telegraph Station at Bivoli Bay. but our so-called progressive Government has proved itself so remarkably dilatory in any really important works outside of the immediate vicinity of Adelaide that a telegraph message will not probably be able to reach Bivoli Bay tmtfl the train is running. 9' A meeting in connection with the Glad stone Corporation was held at Martin's Hotel, Gladstone, on August 19. It was largely at tended. Mr. J. J. Bonrcar. who took tbe chair, said the ™«ring was the outgrowth of a pre vious one, when be with Messrs.

They had bad more difficulties to con tend with than many expected, and their success bad been greater than they bad er pected themselves, for out of 90 resident rate payers in the two townships they had obtained 68 signatures, and considering the influence that bad been brought to bear against them, they bad done welL They had secure 1 the signatures of 29 non-resident ratepayers, bo that they had done all that the Act required, and a Corporation was only a matter of time. The Chairman concurred, and said their object that night was to nominate a Mayor and Councillors. He pointed out that in the first instance the affirmation of the ratepayers was all that was required ; of course at a future date there would be the usual voting by ballot. Mr. J.B. Jones proposed Mr. Washington Moorhouse, the father of the township, as Mayor. This was not seconded. Mr. Marriott proposed, and Mr. Hudson seconded, Mr. Alfred Catt.
