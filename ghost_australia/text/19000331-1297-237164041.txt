Are thoy crying in vain ? Oh, Britain! On lowering pinions A fiend from the nethermost hell Is scourging your fairest dominions, Is scouring through city and dell. Look up from the Bpolls you examlno, ' Tho laurel you flaunt in your hand! Awaken! The famine! Tho famine Is eating tbo heart of tho land! No trumpets and bugles aro walling The fate of tho slain, of tho slain; No streamers and ribbons are trailing; No tendorness softens tbo pain.
