THE SHIPS AND THE MEN. [The first shot ol the war has been fired.] SMOKE and flame, and the thunder of guns, from the battleships' array. Hark to the baik of the'dogs of war as it echoes from far away To the distant towns where the men are mute and the women and chi'dren pray. Loud, louder, louder still you may hear the echoes grow, Till tho bells of old South reverberate with a murmur hoarse and low, As they did when the English guns roared out, a hundred years ago. The ghosts of the past have heard the note that tells of the coming fray ; They have wakened out of their long, long slue.]), and cast their shrouds away— They have risen out. of their quiet graves as they will on the Judgment Day. Gliosis of admirals dead am' one, strange weather beaten forms, That bear the scars of a hundred fights, and the tan of a thousand storms, With their tarnished lace and epaulettes, and their tattered uniforms. Watching the far horizon line witli a fixed and wondering stare At the sight of their ships with their stunted spars and their mastheads gaunt and bare— Masts where never a sail has bent—but the starry flag is there. And still as the smoke wreaths blow away like a meteor shining through, It flames triumphant against the sky tho dear old flag they knew With the blood-red stripes on the field of white, and the stars in the field of blue, Waves as it ever shall wave in the cause of liberty. Though we trust no more our wooden walls to proudly sweep the sea— We have changed our ships, but tho men in the ships are the men they used to be.
