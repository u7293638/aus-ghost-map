O&c; haïmes Jttommg gerald» FRIDAY, NOVEMBER 27, 1868. A lettes which appeared in our journal of the 25th instant, signed "A Printer's Son," discloses a process by which sums of money are extracted which seem to be out of proportion to the service rendered. This, however, is not the chief suggestion which it presents. If people perform a service, and distinctly state the terms on which it is to be effected, it is a matter outside the pub- lic cognisance. The idea of an agency is, if well worked out, worth the working. We suppose that it is the destiny of the unhappy to be more or less the prey of others. A man yvould assign avyay his estate if that were the only means by which he could escape fiom starvation. He would forestall his earn- ings for any length of time if it were the only visible method by yvhich he could acquire employment. Ke yvould pay any amount of interest for a loan if this were the only means by which he could be saved from utter ruin. It is, however, hard to be under so fierce a pressure. The mind revolts from bargains yvith an extravagant advantage on one side, and unreasonable sacrifices on the other. A transaction is not just because it is legal, and people may have no fair right to do yvhat it may be in their power to enforce. Such is the universal feeling of men, and it is right for society to look with extreme jealousy on everything that would expose to such a serious amount of moral danger and suffering. A system of following up persons in employment yveek after week to take from them a proportion of their wages in payment for the intro- duction presents no very pleasing picture of social dependence, and in many cases might either suggest the repudiation of a bargain or its fulfilment by means inconsistent yvith honesty. The hardship of so serious a charge is, however, greatly enhanced by the insecurity of the " value received." In the case of our correspondent, the premium was paid in about six weeks, and amounted to nearly |half the salary received during that time. There yvas no security, of course, for the continuance of the employment. So large a recompense for so small a service puts in a strong light both the necessities of the applicant and the nature of a system yvhich could not, under any aspect, justify such a charge. If people choose to employ agents to procure them servants, it yvould be yvorth while to understand on yvhat terms this interference is° afforded. In the instance yve refer to, the employer was quite unaware of the amount his servant had paid in order to obtain em plo} ment, and felt the indignation yvhich would be experienced by any generous mind that it | should have been necessary to make so i great a sacrifice. No honourable employer i can regaid yvith indifference the yvelfare of those he takes into his service, or yvhether | their resources are unfairly burdened with liabilities incurred in the hour of difficulty aiid under ihe influence of depression. An agency conducted on just principles and under disinterested inspection might be very useful to society. There are institutions for all kinds of vagabondism end misery. Have the honest and industrious no claim on sympathy and help ? The numberless agencies that are established in various parts of the world for transacting business betyveen people yvho are strangers to each other, and bring- ing them together, shows that this is a real want of society. Any institution, conducted in the spirit of our savings' banks, which could facilitate the distribution of labour and the settlement of people who are embarrassed from no fault ot their own, would be mo3t benignant in its influence. Every now and then we hear of persons yvho have been yvan ? dering about the streets searching for employ- ment-unknown to any-yvithout the means of competition yvith others, subsiding at last into deep and inextricable misery. The circum- stances of colonial society are peculiar, and expose the stranger to these vicissitudes. Most persons on yvhose early life the smiles of for- tune were not decided and permanent have, some time or other, felt the desolation of being one too many in the universe ;-of looking all around for a friendly countenance, and seeing none but suspicious faces or averted eyes; I asking the same question and receiving the ! same ansyver from day to day ;-yvaiting yvith | aching head and palpitating heart for the oft repeated reply-No. Such is ' the fate of many an industrious and well- deserving person in some portion of his life. Per- haps a short experience of the kind is the most effective means of impressing lessons, if not of contentment, at least of caution, and teaching khovv perilous it is to give up a certain for an uncertain good. It may be necessary to open the heart with sym- pathy towards those who have to struggle yvith similar misfortunes, and who feel the bitter pang of net being anywhere recognised and being nowhere yvanted. The case of Madame Rachel has shewn, however, that services must be real, and that no imposition must be attempted on the weak and credulous by false repre- sentations. We have seen advertisements in ibis colony, ere now, offering to negotiate matrimonial affairs. There was a tinge of philanthropy in the prospectus. There are others who profess to manipulate the head, and, by its physical developments, to tell the moral and intellectual tendencies of the subject, and so direct his steps. All these departments of industry may perhaps have their excuse, if not their vindication. It is difficult for science, or for law, to fix the precise instant when pretensions on the one side, and credulity on the other, arrive at the exact point of fraud. In the remarkable judgment given recently in the case of Home, who pretended to procure intercourse yvith the invisible world, and so established his heirship to a very large sum of money, the reality of his spiritual feats was not I in question. His case did not turn upon the quality of spirits, but upon the clear fact that he had, for a purpose essentially selfish, imposed upon a yveak understanding, and so extracted gifts for yvhich no legal equivalent could be pretended. The relations of the parties with the present world yvere perfectly clear and unmistakable relations of a cheat and a fool, and it was upon this that the Vice-Chancellor founded his de- cision. We do not put in comparison the selling of an introduction to an employment which is real-from which wages are actually taken - and selling communication yvith the invisible world But there is evidently an opening for much evil. It may be a matter of reasonable surprise to some that the Protectionists of this colony have made no attempt to impose a pro- tective duty upon wheat. It seems an object just fitted to receive the assistance of their friendly arm. It is here in a sickly con- dition, and requires support. How is it that yve should be dependent in a great degree upon foreign supplies for the very " staff of life ? " Is it not rather shameful for us, when yve are able to produce the grain here, to be importing, and paying large sums of money year after year to other groyvers for it ? A few days ago we under- took to show yvhat a miserable crop yvheat was here in a general way. We pointed out that for a series of years the average had never exceeded 16A- bushels per acre, but had often been far below 10 bushels. The badness of the case, however, is not that which usually deters the Protectionist from offering his assistance ; indeed, it brings him the sooner to the succour of the labouring industry. He is a true knight ; the worse the case the more prodigal is he of aid. It would matter to him nothing that Heaven does not appear tn favour the maturing of wheat in this region-he is here, and it is a principle with him that no national family should be beholden to another national family for its bread corn-that is enough for him. Supposing that the farmer is able to obtain but a slight yield for the seed soivn, and that,a raiser of bread corn across the border may he able to undersell him at his oyvn door, is not this just the case for a protective duty? Surely it would be the greatest injustice, since the farmer has under- taken, for the benefit of the colony, to supply the community with wheat, to allow any foreign competitor to interfere yvith him. An import duty must undoubtedly be imposed upon all foreign wheat, sufficiently high to balance the inequality in Heaven's gifts, or any little differences, in skill and perseverance, there may be between the tyvo groyvers; and thus our farmer will be encouraged by finding a pleasant distinction made between his intentions and his services, and the grate- ful impression will be forced upon him, that he is not scurvily treated to a payment by results. It is difficult to conceive in what yvay the farmers of Neyv South Wales have got on without Protection. They have certainly been reduced to great shifts, but their operations must prove most conclusively the want of a protective duty, since the cultivation of wheat and maize appears to be giving way to products better Buited to the land. But this surely must be a mistaken policy. Should we not produce sufficient yvheat for the colonial i loaf, damper, and dumpling? In the absence of this duty what is it that [ vye see ? Men driven to the growth of crops l that can be produced without fear of ' rivalry. We observe men, who tried in vain lo get . a profitable return from maize at 2s. 3d. a bushel, turning in despair to the sugar-cane, and those who have striven pertinaciously to raise yvheat on the seaboard obliged to curry it inland, and localise its culture with reference to its special preferences. It may have been nolicetl also by persons yvho interest them- selves in such matters, that several of the most enterprising farmers have been at pains to cul- tivate more carefully, and to invest money in expensive machinery, and to manure their lands for the purpose of putting themselves in a better position to meet wheat growers from other States ; but it is easy to see that all this expenditure and trouble might have been saved them, had a barrier been raised against the inundation of grain at present allowed. Although our yield per acre is small in New South Wales, yve could certainly groyv enough to supply our yvants, provided farmers could get such remuneration for growing it as might be devised by an im- port duty, and yvhile eating the produce of our own soil, we . should have the additional satisfaction of knowing that we were not employing foreign labour, as we do at present. If foreign labour should be submitted to restriction and taxes ? in manufactured articles, why should not« that yvhich is represented in the production of yvheat? That any one else can bring wheat a distance of several hundred miles and offer it at the market price which rules in Sydney, is proof positive that they are more favourably circumstanced for growing it than are our farmers. The inequality, conse- quently, should be righted by a duty, to prevent our paying money ayvay toyvards the support of labourers in foreign parts. Some- times we have a surplus and are exporters, as we were last year to England, yvhere yve found a good market, the English having been foolish enough to throw down their protective barriers. If yve deem it necessary to refer to the shifts to which the farmers of New South Wales are put by the absence of an import duty, what shall be said of the effects produced on the farmers of England yvhen the Corn Laws were abolished ? It yvould be to describe a revolu- tion. The farm routine and apparatus were changed to accommodate the exigencies of a new system. The agricultural pace yvas changed and quickened. Men of science yvere called in to consult as to yvhat yvas to be done ; and the consultation ended in the institution of the agricultural chemist and the agricultural engineer and machinist. Farmers were obliged to study the physical conditions of the elements they yvorked with ; the cropping of the land yvas a problem to be solved, the invention of machinery to economise human power was also a problem to be solved, and the fertilisation of impoverished soil was a third problem to be solved. It occurred to the . farmer that although he could make no more than an acre of his acre superficially, he could extend his inherit- ance by deepening the staple, and accord- ingly he introduced the steam-engine to his fields, and broke up the soil to double and treble the depth it had been stirred before, and greyv crops of grain and cattle food before yvhich he stood aghast. While in this state of highly wrought excitability he called upon his landlord to extend his lease, to provide roads and railways, to drain the land, to erect commodious homesteads, and to do aJl necessary to be done to give security to his investment, and effect to the pro- gressive measures taken by himself. He was driven to do all this to balance the difference between the price of labour in Russia and England, and to compensate certain disad- vantages under which he lay with respect to the wheat-grower of America. His effort has been to lower the cost of production, and to increase the yield. These objects have been attained to the admiration of the world ; but at what price to himself !

50th (Queen's Own) Regiment, proved highly successful The weather being favourable and the light sufficient for social intercourse, a large audience was attracted to the ground, those present numbering about 11,000 persons. A largo platform, with music stands lit with lamps, was erected on an elevation, a little to the south-east of the fountain, and this was surrounded by a dense throng some time before the time appointed for the oponing of the programme/ The selections were well diversified and more than usually choice, including Mendelssohn's Wedding March in "Midsummer Night's Dream," the overture to "Semiramide," Coote's lancers " The Cure," an extract from "L'Africaine," Gassner's valse "The Half Hundred," and by special request, a portion of "Il Trovatore," with anvil accompaniment, and "Miserere" with song, and Gassner's galop "The Cackling Hens." Mr. Gassner, the talented bandmaster, composed for the occasion a musical pot-pourri, entitled " The Night Mare and Council of War, or Don Quixote and Sancho Panza " This is supposed to have reference to certain civic proceed- ings and shortcomings, the music being adapted to charac- terise the events. Thence we had the election represented by drums, drums and bugles, and the brass band, answering each other from opposite directions; a dream of knighthood by the soft strains of the reed band, "Let us be happy together" by brass band in distance, interrupted by night- mare, the Unveiling of Captain Cook's Statue (brass band marching), and then following the "Rogues March," the "Dead March in Saul," with a touch of "Robert Le Diable" and "Mephistopheles," "Rule Britannia" with the madman's interruption, "Hearts of Oak" and "Rule Britannia " with a break- down, "Tho Red Cross Knight," "Down among tho dead men." the Council of War with great squabbling therein, and "Here's a health to all good lasses." The composer has succeeded in producing some remarkably telling effects, especially of the ludicrous class, but perhaps the most noticeable part of the arrangement is the ingenious use of the Dead March in "Saul" in a F minor waltz time, which changes into F major as it merges into the Mephistopheles waltz. The band was enthusiastically cheered as the programme was passed through The proceeds of the concert (a fee having been requested at each entrance to the ground) are to be devoted h in aid of the funds of the School of Industry, and as few attended without giving a contribution, the friends of the institution must owe a debt of gratitude to Colonel Waddy and the officers the regiment for permitting the band to appear on this occasion, and also to Mr. Gassner, who, in regard to this as well as to other concerts in aid of chari- table institutions, has not only cheerfully lent his assist- ance, but exerted himself zealously to obtain success.

When I affirm that the river had risen nearly thirty feet in less than two hours, I think that most people will agree with me in thinking that there has been a kind of celestial cata- ract somewhere up the river, or that the basin of the Macintyre has been tilted up by an earthquake, and the water thus cast to the lower side. It must have come down like a great wall, and with frightful force, for Mr Simpson's new washpool at Trigamon (the next station up the river), though considered a substantial one, was carried clean away in a moment, not even a trace of its where abouts being left, and were it not for the great courage and exertions of Mr. J. C. Higginson, the superintendent, a fine flock of sheep would have been swept away too.
