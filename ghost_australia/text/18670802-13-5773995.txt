HAMLET. TO THE EDITOR OF THE ARGUS. Sir,—Will you permit to an old scholar (whose opinion may not be valued by any- body at all) two words on the letter of Mr. James Smith ? His opponents seem not quite in harmony with themselves, or with each other, and I am unwilling to increase the complication. Both sanity and flightiness are compatible with refinement and with roughness ; but individuality of character (short of madness), so congenial to the dra matic post, is apt to be lost in civilisation. The admirable clearness of Mr. Montgomery's tapestry-scene with Ophelia still leaves open the question of intermittent madness, and meets not Mr. Smith's exaction of an indi- viduality more robust. This must be sought elsewhere. It is no disparagement to Mr. Montgomery that his portraiture of Hamlet displays not the excellence he never aimed at. I dissent from my accomplished and much esteemed friend, Mr. James Smith. Hamlet , gives (to me, at least) every conceivable proof of sanity. He tests and audits the details of the ghost's statement, bears them in his powerful memory, but exacts more and better proof of their truth than even the visit of a spirit ; thus indirectly confirming the parable of Dives and Lazarus in its doctrine of the insufficiency of such a visitation. And the crowning proof of his sanity is that very sportiveness noticed by my friend. In the heart of the madman is ever gloom, in his eye suspicion, from his soul Fear never relaxed her grasp. But sport is even as bloom upon the cheek of a young athlete, and to have cheerful images at ready command is the best proof and lasting attribute of radical and inherent sanity.—I have the honour to be, yours respectfully. RICHARD BIRNIE.
