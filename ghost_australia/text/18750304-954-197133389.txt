' First, when the Alexandrine version seems to them correct they quote it literatim et verbatim. 'Second, when dissatisfied with the work of the Seventy they amend it, and make their quotations according to the original Hebrew. 11 Third, when they would point out more clearly in what sense they adduce such and such a declaration of the holy books, they paraphrase it in quoting it.' It is then the Holy Ghost mho by their month quotes Himself, 'modifying at the same time the expressions which He had previously dictated to the prophets of His ancient people. Compare for example Micah v. 2 with Mat. ii. 6, Malachi iii. 1 with Mat. xi. 10, Mark i. 2 and Luke vii. 27, &c.;' — Your obedient servant, Credo. February 14, 1875. ?
