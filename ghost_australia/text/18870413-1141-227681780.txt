Wrestling. To the Athletic Editor of the Sportemem. Sir,— Permit me to make a few remarxs on « An Old Amateur's " letter in the Sportsmast of 23rd March. In toe first j>1aoe he knows he does not know what he is writing about when ne Ei&tee; itonnor was laying oaoe oa uiuiMMt. Why, Connor got £60 to £40 against himself. He also states that " good men, when wrestling, act coolly." Why, I could get anv two bush- men to catch a hold and prop themselves like two crossbeams, and keep there till they would drop with exhaustion, waiting an oppor tunity to get a hold, like in toe Keating v. Thomas match. Connor and Christol made plenty of play ; whereas Cannon and Dinnie, in the. Collar-and- elbow style, were told several times by the judge to wrestle, it being all on toe defensive. He also states,- "Can- non is a superior wrestler to Connor. I nave spoken to all toe wrestlers in Melbourne abont the match, and they openly state that Cannon had not the "ghost of a show" from the beginning. If "Old Amateur" is disap pointed at Connor's victory and thinks Can non a better man, let him back his opinion. He also states that " Connor is afraid to meet tw » or three men now in this oolony in all- round wrestling. Connor will meet any man either in this colony or any other in six styles, Connor to name three styles and the other three, and surely that ought to be enough of stylea. The fact is that 44 Old Amateur" and a great many more are disappointed at Connor e victory. Now, Connor has what no other wrestler has— an unbeaten record, having won 108 matches. " Old Amateur" Bhowe very poor knowledge of wrestlers when he does not think much of Cannon and Christol. Both have beaten the best men of America and France, juid Connor beat both of them. Hoping you will publish toe above few remarks,— l ours, Ac., « WRBSTLBH.
