WE8TRALIAN NOTES.* Mems. from Menzies. [Br Jo. M .J Antipodes Bent. The miners in the MenzieB Gold Estates .shaft are gradually leaving Menzies on their downward route. They are now approaching 200 yards from Menzies level, or 600 feat deep. The manager thinks it probable that a shaft 800 feet in depth will he required to strike the reef. This is a deep speculation, and suggests the question —" What might not deep sinking in South Australia reveal in suitable or favorable localities ?

During Sir John Forrest's late tour through the northern goldfields—Mount Margaret, Mount Leonora, etc.—the ghosts of his exploring days were vividly brought before him. At a picnic in his honor, on the summit of Mount Malcolm, some interesting reminiscences of exploration incidents were recounted by him to his interested hearers. " In 1869 Mr. John Forrest, explorer, was on the top of Mount Malcolm gazing on a monotonous stretch of desert as far as the eye could reach—a waterless waste—monarch of all he sur veyed. In 1899, Sir John Forrest, P.C., etc., Premier of Westralia (30 years after wards), waB on the top of Mount Malcolm gazing on an exhilarated party—a lemon ade picnic—master of all he essayed and " king of the sandgropers dry lond." Coolgabdie Exhibition. During the first four weeks since the opening of the exhibition nearly 25,000 persons have visited this attractive show. Mew exhibits are Btill arriving, and more are still expected. Additional interest has been supplied to the mineralogical bays by a case of sparkling specimens from the Carnage Mine, Siberia. Three-hundred weight of stone from this mine dollied lately, yielded 131 ounces of gold. This mine was bartered one time for the enor mous sum of £5. We beg to call tbe attention of our readers to Mr. G-. E. Morgan's advertise ment, which appears in another column, would advise our readers and the public generally to call and inspect the magni ficent stock on hand. Every variety of tombstone is now on view, whilst the best possible workmanship is guaranteed. We would also call attention to the fact that Mr. Morgan has always contributed most liberally to our charitable institutions, and we trust that fact will not be overlooked when anything in the line of monumental masonry is required. The " Philadelphia Becord " tells of a railway engineer named William Blue, who was master of locomotive No. 2. One of the flues in the boiler of his pet engine blew out and he was stalled, blocking the main line. His report to the division superin tendent was unwittingly as follows: " En gine two blew out a flue. What'll I do ?— BUI Blue." In twenty minutes Bill got this answer: "Bill Blue: Tou plug the flue in engine two and pull her through in time to get out of the way of twenty-two."
