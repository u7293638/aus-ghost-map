l'IUÎtsENIlMENTS. ALMOST every one lins somo belief, greater or loss, in presentiments; tiwi evotj' one, u it linn t exception, munt hnvo known many easts in «.liiclt piosonl ¡menta have como true. How and ivlij' tliia is I hnvo noY'cr seen c.iplnincd stttis fnctorilj'; nwl it thcrefoic seems utmost a duly to try to supply this needed explanation. Whether it will scorn satisfactory to others, of courso I do not know. The old simile of the cloud pnssing over n | landsciipc on a sununcr day is. Uko most old similes, n useful one. I employ it now to inulto elenr Yvlitit I mean, auppo.se you aro sitting in a lontn.nt some distance from tho YYÎIIIIOYV, on u bright afternoon ; if suddenly the light socms to go out of everything-the narden without to lose ila beauty, tho colours of pictures nnd furniture «'itliin to fnilo und grow dull though Hiero is no causo not nally to be scon for this chungo, j'oti know quite well «lint it is ; you aro sure that, if you got up to go lo tho YYimlow and look nt tho sky, you «ill seo that n cloutl lins just hidden tho sun You ure quite cortnin of this, beenuso it has so often, to your knowledge, happened before; though you can givo no proof, from the objects you can see without moving, that this is the causo- oxcept that you cannot think oí any other. Presentiments t li ii fc como truo uro generally of this tinturo-of presentiments that do not come true I need hnrtlly spoult ; they are, as a rule, caused by tho simplo faut that you aro not well, and that your spirits aro consequently loiv. Hut in renl prcpenlitncnts there is most nannlly a «ant of porfoct honesty, You sny to yourself, " J hnvo such anti such causes for being linppj, yet I nin not hnppy, Í fenr some ovil, mid Yet hnvo in renlity no cnuso for fearing it. This in n prcsetitiment." You uro not telling yourself the truth ; you havo somo euttso for fenring evil, though you will not nvoiv it. Some omi han promised j'ou his aid; but when bo promised there was u look upon his faeo ii li ich you did uni like ; it ia a thing too vnguc to tell nny olio olae, nnd so you ignoro it to youisolf ; but It is there, und it spoils your happiness. Sometimes, indeed, this is not exnetly n Yvnnt of honesty to yourself; it is- according to a thoory of l)icliens's-a forgetting of first impressions.'This applies especially to tho caso just instanced, of n mnwyou cannot-or ought not to-entirely trust. Dickens snid that ho found that his llrst impression of a man was nlwnys right ; that if ho instinctively disliked liitu, and wits then won by his conversation or manner to liko him, in _ the end ho always found tlint his original mistrust was justified. During his middle stugoof confidence, then, ho probably had a lurking feeling, which-wlton the man turnod out badly-ho irould look back upon as a proHonfcimont. (Uy-thc-Yvny, DickonB does not, I think, tcLl us whether ni« theory «as complete whother, that is, if he first liked a man and then afterwards disliked him, ho generally ended as he begun-revenant a ses prcmiresnmeurs). There is, it mnj bo noticed, in '' Nicholas Niikleby," and, I fane), in one or two others of Dickens books, a curious sort of reversed presentiment-an omen drawn from an apparent utter abseuco ot any presentiment He makes Halpli Nnklchy remember, during the walk homo on his last eiening on curtli, how often men lune bein noticed to bo extremely niLrry u few hours boliuo then death-almost un natural]) meiry, pLrbnps I he use he maltes of this superstition is \orj fino-Dickens' death scenes me almost always striking-but it is prolmbly a nure superstition If «ego to the great stoichouso el typical (nets about human mittlre-bliukcsroro-I do not think that «o shall find any continuation of it, on tim other bund, all it member instances m lus tragedies ot snd premonition lulhlled-'but thou uoulilst not think how ill all's hue, about mj hoait " Closely connected «ith this subject i«, of courso (hut nt foroYYiiiumg di cn ins It is said that u soctetj »us formed nt Cambndgc some ft» ycttrs agoto osnimm us fut as posible into the cYitlence of nil dream stones and of all ¿host stoi as , that theio «us m this society a strong secptnnl pin ty , und that (ho result of their iuu8tie,iitionB «as «hut may roughly bo stulid thus- the) found insuflicieiit the eittlci co for nil the ghost stones into which they inqnned, except only thoso (ninth ninny ttoultl cnll dream sti ries) ot people appearing lo their relations or fnonds at or about tho moment of dentil Tor many tales of this sort there «tis, it «ns saul, oudenco «Inch nny unpiijudiced iiiind must acknowledge to be itinelusiYo-any mind, that I«, of eighteen or nu oteen, nnd not ptuetieed m ero s examina- tion, foi this society YYHS, I nnngme, composed ol uudergi ntl untes only I 13ut this piirtictilni form of presentiment-n diouin ivnruing-hnppeus to be 0110 «Inch is cn turn, by natural accident, to bo constantly ocelli ring lins lins no doubt been proied bt lore , hut it is some sntisluetit n to SIIOYV onco neilin ' bj figures," thnl it «otdtl really beYery odd and quito contrary lo tho kui tit nYernge«, if deaths «ero not pictly fitquonlly told in ilicnin« lo go into tho matter cmefully, taking the evict population of Great Brituin und the exact porcentngos required (ns Inr ns the) uro nsceitiunnblo) would muko n icrj pretty sum-I do not quito know in «lint rulo of niitlnnetic-«Inch Inm hnppj to tccotntiund to tho attention t f the Dr Bucht s «hose " joung gentle non' IIUYO Intel) rctuintd to them , but n much rougher calculation YYIII nnsYYer nil practical purposes. lite population of tho Un i ted Kingdom «ns, in 1871 according to the census then tnkon, 31 8o7 338 , awl, ns YVO mai fanly assume that it has increased 150,000 sonco that lune «o «ill call it 12,000,000 Of these, probably tit least a half ni o dreamers -pt opio whodienm cither freqtiontly ot rutel), babies, of course, cannot bo supposed to dream intelligibly, though, en raYoiche, I think chil dien rather older (Iren n more, and more vividly, thau grown up people Of these sixteen million dreamers some dream regttlnily eiery nighr, others Yoiy ruiLly indeed, but it«ill probably bo ei needed that of people YY ho dream tit nil tbonieragodrcnm quite once in ten nights (Hutt they remember theso ti rea in s is not nthi meei, only that, it one of them comes true, it then returns to thou momo!) ) Hits giYes one million si\ hundred dteains per night in longland, ¡scotland Ii eland, an) the Channel Islands iioii there uro cei tain people-gcncrnlly of ex- citable mid vivid imagination-«huso usions nre ncYcr of the piostue fi Ik they know m this YYoild, but mo etthci ot dénions oi fabulous beings, or pcrhups of scener) or ollie i imper- sonal things ihtso peoplo aro, howevir, I imn"ine, n small muiorit) , and it is mero genc lostty «Inch makes mc limit tho dreams about nctunl existent beings to one hull of tho total number And ot these dreams about persons I think it may bo ticBUined-through it is of com se, impossible to piolo it-that, at the xery least, 1 per cent aro dreams ot death.
