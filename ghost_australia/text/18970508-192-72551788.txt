Mr. Rol Marden, who has been away: for several weeks on sick-leave in the Bathjurst district, returned home last week greatly improved in health. Two local Justices of the Peace appear to do all the Court business there is to be done in Windsor just now. The remainder seldom, if ever, put in an appearance. The speotacle of a cart load of Victorian* grown cauliflowers being sold through'the streets in Windsor this week was much commented upon. They were beauties, too. An ex-Oouncil-clerk of Windsor is a familiar figure in Melbourne just now. He has had an exciting career, having held an officer's rank in the Franco-German war. He draws a pension from the German Government. We have at the GAZETTE office a copy of the " Sydney Gazette" for 1804, on which is inscribed the name of John Batman, the founder of Victoria, who resided in Parra matta from the date of his birth there (1600) until 1820. <. ) A Windsor lady owns a valuable set of early Australian papers - the first 12 volumes of the 44 Sydney Gazette," tpe pioneer journal of this continent.

Dickson's farm, where it Wab pulled up, without, however, having donb any damage. Complaints are made regarding the noisy conduct in whiel/some of the H.A. College students, indulge whenever they visit Wind* sor, particularly at night. One naturally expbcts a lot of young fellows like they are to possesB a suberabundance of vitality, but they should know where to draw the line. The second'annual Cinderella Dance in connection with St. Matthew's R. C. Church bids fair to be quite as successful as last year's event. The Committee, with Mr. W. C. Barker at the head of affairs, are working energetically, and there is little ftoribt but that the attendance will be very large. The New-street44 ghost" is again scaring! people almost tb death. An occupant of! this haunted house was aroused one night rebently by a peremptory ordier to leave the place. As he awoke he saw the form of a one-time Windsor resident, long since dead, bending over his bed, and from whom the voice issued. The concert to be held in the Richmond School of Arts-fchis Friday night, in aid of the building fund of St. Monica's R. C. Ohtirch, Should be worth .going some dis tance to hear. A glance at the programme shows that all the performers are tip-top sawyers, and among them is one of Aus tralia's greatest cantraltos! Miss Constanoe Evelyn. On Saturday last Mr. Farrell, of Wind sor-road, accompanied by his little boy, was driving to town with a harrow in the dray. Near the Fitzroy bridge the horse stopped suddenly, and the boy, who was standing up, was thrown backwards. He came into contact with one of the harrow - tines, which inflicted a nasty wound, neces sitating medical attendance. The sewer which crosses George-street from the Park water-hole has been cleaned cut during the week by a number of men, under the direction of Mr. P. Motteram. Many of the pipes were found to have been absolutely choked up by a solid mass of earth and of fibrous roots from the trees growing on the fringe of the water- hole. Little wonder, under the circumstances, that the surplus water oould not get away, . Mr. Arthur Corn well; whohatf i>Â«en laid up for a couple of weeks with rheumatics, is about again. Mr. H. Campbell, from Camden, brother of Mr. F. Campbell is on a brief Visit to Windsor, " doing" the show.

The fateful scythe of Father Time has been busy in the town and district; young ahd old have gone to their last resting place in great numbers during the present year ; and if the death-rate for the remain der of the year is as alarmingly large, 1897 will be a mournful year. Some queer stories are being told of a " ghost" which has made its appearance in a house in New-street. : There is a long standing belief among the superstitions that this particular house is haunted, for different people , who have resided there declare that they have encountered the apparition. A shocking example of bad taste was exhibited in town this week. As a funeral procession was wending its way to the Church of England cemetery, a carter kept his team going alongside the orttege, and his intermittent admonishments to the horses were a source of annnoyahce to the mourners. This Sunday, and en the Sunday follow ing, public addresses will be delivered in the Windsor School of Arts by an " Evan gelist of the Catholic Apostolic Church."

Angelo J. Viney Railway Hotel, Windsor, proprietor. Estab. ished 10 years, f By advertisement in anoiher column, it will be seen that the Elton Family appear in the School-room, New-street, this Friday and Saturday evenings. This company is highly spoken of by the country press. The proprietor, Mr. Elton, is a really talented man, and with his accomplished wife, sisters-in-law, and young sons, pro vides an entertainment which is unique and varied. A frequent cause of complaint among those who, desiring a quiet hour at evening, avail themselves of the privileges afforded by the local School of Arts, is that all the embryo larrikinism of Windsor-and it seems to be a big assortment-do congre gate outside the building, making noisy and objectionable remarks and indulging in much unnecessary horse-play, to the infinite annoyance of the peace of paper loving persons inside. Attention is directed to Mr. D, Holland's advertisement in this issue. Sickness, especially colds, are very preva lent in the district at present. The usual large number of spielers, , pick-pockets, and other undesirable gentry were present at the Show yesterday. Mr and Mrs P.

Mr. A. Gf Walker, son of Hon W. Walker, has been playing in a cricket match with a Western Australian fifteen against Giffen's Australian eleven at Kalgoorlie, Western Australia recently, and scored well with the bat. It is reported th&t; Mr C. Cross, of Caddai, who is regarded as one of the best rough riders in the Hawkesbury, met with severe injuries to one of his legs the other day. If such is the case, it is hardly likely that he will ride the demon buck-jumper at the Show this Friday afternoon. The* several exhibits at the Shew, -of articles made from common corn-husks will serve to prove that there is a use for every thing if the people only have brains enongh to note the fact. One of the best exhibits in this line was a " flop" hat, made out of corn-husks by Mrs. W. C. Barker. J It is really time that the Council dicL something in the direction of opening up an outlet for the water which accumulates in front of what is known as Key's premises, in George-street, and where the occupants were nearly flooded out a few days*} ago when a heavy shower fell. It is unfair that the grievances of taxpayers should be neglected in this fashion. It is rumoured that there is a Crown Jewel pony to be at the Show, and that it will be entered against the bucking horse which is to oome from up-country. This pony is a dreadful animal to buck, and will also kick when one is off his back. There is only one man who has ever been able to keep on his back out of about twenty who have tried to ride him. He has not been ridden for about six months. Another young Hawkesbury native has succumbed to tjphoid fever in West Aus tralia. Mr. J. B. Nowlan (son of Mr. M.
