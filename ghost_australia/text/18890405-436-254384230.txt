This being the state of things, the undertaker hastily picked up the bones, placed them in an urn, and . re-interred them. The same night the son dreamed that he saw his father in great displeasure, and awakening, from his dream, he fell, asleep again to have it repeated.

One of his acquaintances suggested that perhaps his father's spirit objected to being removed .; another hinted, that, more likely, all the bones hai not been cillected ; and tbis last bint led to a search and to the finding of a bone which had escaped notice. It was at once interred yrith tho rest in the urn ; and since that night the son's slumbers have been undisturbed, the ghost, hU grievance settled, appearing no more.
