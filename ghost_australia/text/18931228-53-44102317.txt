UNEASY CONSCIENCES. Conjuring up Ghosts. No one will be more surprised than Broken Hill people to read this from the Australasian of Saturday last :— "The feeling is gaining ground in well informed circles that Broken Hill will in the near future be the centre of another great struggle for supremacy between the miners and mineowners. It is asserted that this feeling is so strong in some quarters that prepara- tions are being made privately to avert a catastrophe, that would far more dis- astrously affect the miners than the shareholders. Another strike would probably result in one or two of the mines being permanently closed down." The Australasian is an organ of the mineowners, whose consciences are apparently so uneasy that ghosts are conjured up at every turn. "Another great struggle for supremacy" is spoken of. When an earlier struggle "for supremacy" took place the Australasian does not say. A Narracoorte correspondent tele- graphed:—The news of the Oxley tragedy created a painful sensation here, Oxley and his family having resided here for 14 years. He was an exemplary man, and in every way an affectionate husband and father and faithful servant, who had been em- ployed on Mr. Magarey's station for a number of years. He was an active member of the Church of England and a Sunday school teacher, and took an interest in temperance affairs, being a Son of Temperance. He had recently, received legacies amounting to £2000, and left Narracoorte three weeks ago to better himself. He was married 11 years ago to Miss Emma Holmes, his murdered wife. He had £1400 locked up in the National Bank and £200 in the Savings Bank. Boys' trou. suits, 10s. 6d. H. H. Hart
