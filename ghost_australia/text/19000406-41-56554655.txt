'Idle Thoughts of an Idle F-1- low,'' tells a different tab from that which is usually heard. He says, 'Poor rats! They seem to exist so that cats and dogs may gain credit for killing them, and chemists make a fortune by inventing spe cialities in poison for their destruction. And yet there is a fascination about them. There is a weirdness and uncanniness attaching to them. They are so cunning, so strong, so terrible in their numbers, 'so cruel, so secret. They swarm in deserted houses, where the broken casements hang rotting to the crum bling walls, and the doors swing creaking en their rusty hinges. They know the sink ing ship, and leave her, no one knows how or whither. They whisper to each other in their hiding-places, how a doom will fall upon the hall and a great name die forgot ten. They do fearful deed's in ghastly char nel-houses. No tale of horror is complete without the rats. In stories of ghosts and murderers they scamper through the echo ing rooms, and the gnawing of their teeth is heard in the wainscot, and their gleaming eyespeer through the holes in the worm-eaten tapestry, and thev scream in shrill, Tin earthly notes in the dead of night, while the moaning wind sweeps' sobbing round the ruined turret towers, and passes wail ing like a woman through the chambers bare and tenantless. And dying prisoners, tn their loathsome dungeons, see, througn the iiorrid gloom, their smaU red eyes, like glittering coals; hear, in death-like silence, the rush of their claw-like feet, and start up shrie'tring in the darkness, and waitch through the awful night.'
