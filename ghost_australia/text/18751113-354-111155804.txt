I !. Selected Poetry. ON THE TBKBACB. The stately lady, the grave, calm man, Stood on the terrace together ; 'Mid tbo bright rose thickets the revellers strayed, From lawn to fountain the children played, And hidden music sweet melodies made, At the fete in the summer weather. With careless, languid courtesy, She bent to hear him apeak Of the newest book and the latest play, Of the keenest move in the statesman's fray, Of the freshest topic of the day, Or the marvel of the week. Lightly with his practised tongue, He touched on all and ouch. With here a uneer and there a jest, And now a grave word as to attest, ? 'I give you the foam on the topâ€” the rest No passing hand can reach.' Yet once, ah me, how long ago ! Ench one was all to tho other ; When every whispered word of his Woke her young heart to a dream of bliss. Does the ghost of tint love's trembling kiss Still lingering round them hover ? The measure of the music changed ; On the summer breeze there stole A low, sweet, simple, homely air, Such as one listens to everywhere. To tho two who lounged on the terrace there It ipoke as to heart and soul. Her proud head drooped, his low voice ceased ; For a moment in thought they stood. Young, eager, fearless, happy and true. As when no cold wisdom claimed her duo, When love was fresh and hope was new, At the tryst in the solemn wood. A vivid flush on the stern bronzed face, A tear in the large blue eyes, Than buck to the world and its talk again, Custom closed oh ill o'er the instant's pain, For thought was a folly and memory vain, Iu the path that Before them lies.
