STORYTELLER. IN MALE ATTIRE. A ROMANCE OF THE DAY. By JOSEPH HATTON, Author of "By Order of the Czar," &c.; CHAPTER XXXIX.—On Board an Atlantic Liner; a Strange Meeting. From the storm and stress of a wild ex-<*> perience ashore to the calm of a pleasant deck-cabin on board a Cunard, liner ; Ai'nat a change ! It seemed to Zella years since che had waved her hand to dear old Dankea and his comrades at the Red Horse Forks, though it was less than two weeks. . . , She hardly knew 'herself, as she lay on ti*Jr pillow, watching the sea through the.port tjholes, between the. passing of'passengers and sailors going to and fro, and listening to the. steady boat of the distant screw. Coining on board at the last moment, she had gone straight to "her room, which had been transferred from Zella Brunnen to Philip ..Grey. . . . She had taken the cabin,iii tho name of Zella Brunnen, with tho understanding that Philip should occupy it, in oase Miss Brunnen had to delay her journey until the line's next sailing. Jt was-in this way, that 'Miss Zella Brunnen's name crtme to be inserted on the list of pas sengers. . .-. As Philip Grey she saw the steward, and made .arrangements with him that, he was never to disturb her under any circumstances';, that she required a great deal of rest; -would go down. to meals or have them brought to her, as she felt in clined ; ■ that, whether she appeared at tab* or'deElrpd to be served 1n her room, was a matter for herself ; jhat he was to leave her severely, alone, unless she rang for him ; thatj if these arrangements were carefully fulfilled, there would be ten dollars for him at the end of the voyage ; and that tfcwe were five dollars for him now, to keep his memory fresh. "All right, sir," he had said ; " I won't never disturb you." . Then she unpacked her cabin luggage, and got into her berth. She had not to climb into it, as she had had to do at Blind Man's Drift ; and there were other soothing dif ferences, such as clean sheets, perfumed with.eau-de-Cologne, close at her elbow an electric lamp, and within reach a bell to summon a good fairy in the shape of her steward, commanding every luxury that hu man ingenuity could think of for first-class passengers on an ocean steamer. . It seemed to her that she had had no real xest for years and years ;-yet the time she ihad sallied forth from Chicago, a mission ary of justice, could .be counted by jmonths only. . . .She thought of many things, and realised, without quite understanding why, that Bhe had found the loss of her lover less and less hard to (bear. Occupa tion is the surest antidote to Borrow. It is not how many years we live that nnakes age, but how much we do in. the time. Who shall fathom the anind of woman ? Zella had seen so much of the rough and disagreeable side of men's lives ibeyond the borders of civilisation that she felt cjirious to note what change there might foe under the influence .of polite society. Moreover, she had coime to like herself as Philip Grey. If the shadow of iher great loss ihad not fallen upon her spirits, there is no knowing how she might have received the more thair significant attentions of a very pretty woman ,at the Windsor, in New York, where she had stayed two days as Philip Grey, while she had rooms at the Gileey (House as Zella Brunnen. It was from- the Gilsey House that she (had wired her 'Chicago friends of her de parture for Liverpool. Nor was she en hour too early in doing go ; for the latest telegrams and letters she found awaiting her " there declared the intention of Old Glencoe and Mr. IStorey- both to look her up. She had kept them contented with a letter writ ten on /board the train, posted in New York by the coloured attendant, in.which she ihad* stated her intention of spending a week or so with her (relatives, the Grunelsone, who had a place on the Hudson. One thing that afflicted Zella a: good deal was the amount of diplomatic lying she ihad •found necessary to play her part of Philip Grey successfully. She satisfied her con science by likening herself to en actress on the stage, speaking lines and occupying situations set down for her ; as well as the justification -of the cause in which she- was engaged. Now that iher mission was ful filled, ihowever, she was obliged to confess to herself, being aft honest woman, that to con tinue the acting of a falsehood was more or aess fay way of a freak or en act of vanity, or out of a desire foT adventure—" some thing in the blood of a soldier's daughter," she argued, " brought up on the frontier, Amidst the excitement of 'foattle, murder, and sudden death.' " •Who, indeed, shall ; fathom the motives of a -woman, if she cannot fathom them her self ? There might be "a touch of curiosity as well as vanity, an underlying current of the degeneracy, that governs genius, accord- Ing to a great authority, in Zella's growing attachment to male attire ; who knows ? " As a rule,, she did iiot care much for women' They did not care much for her. She was too -pretty for them, too clever, too un conventional/ and too much admired by the . men for a popular career among women. It was worth something, she thought, to be plear of them on board ship ; not to have to sit in their drawing-room, to have a free hand, to be equally at home with either man or woman with whom common courtesy might compel her to converse. . . . So there she was, en route for Europe—Zolia Brunnen, behind the effective mask of ■Philip Gray. " And now that she was fairly rested and settling down to the voyage, she unpacked her Bmall portfolio, and read the letters she had found awaiting her at the Gilsey House. First, there was Storey, repeating his coun sels to be observed by a young unattended woman on a voyage to Europe. She smiled as she thought of the grim experience of the samo young woman in the mining camps of Platts Valley, and wondered what ho would think of her, when the story of the death of Abner Dlgges, thief and murderer, should come out, as it assuredly would, one of the3e .flays, however long Old Prudent and her $ther friends might succeed in keeping it back. Second, there was a letter from £>onald Malcolm Glencoe, written in a stiff, formal hand, informing her, in mighty firm sentences, of the good progress of Mistress Bridget O'Hagan towards recovery ; of the devotion of all concerned in maintaining tbo proper and efficient management of Park side ; and the individual and collective soli citude of tlie entire household for her safe . and comfortable journey across the sea, and her happy return. . ." You'll. understand,. my dexr child," he wrote, "that the heart of Parks ide :is wi l . ye. 'Tls not in the nature of Parkside to be demonstrative. It. has, individually and collectively, a deep affection for ye. It behoves ye, therefore, to.gie us information cattcerning your happiness, or otherwise, that we may joy wi' ye, or .sorrow. But, after what ye have suffered, it canna be in the decrees of Providence to afflict ye fur ther. That Is our hope and faith. , .... As for our deer Mistress O'Hagan, wl' her fine .nature, though iTlsh, -we have been solicitous for her recovery, and it glee me no end of satisfaction to report her comv.&?. lescence. She receives visitors in her chamber. 'As her strength is not sufficient for more than two hours a-day In an arm chair. 'But she is quite iher old self ; just as ilriah as iher discretion and lovable In stincts will permit. ... She clften talks of you, and remembers everything in your 'girlish Ihistary, though a kind (Providence has softened the blow of our dear Ned "Glover's death to her, to the extent that eke does-not knew the manner of it, save as it might -toe in the way of Nature.;... . We, your friends of Parkside, keep your choir empty at tue table. .Wihen I say empty, it Is filled to'all of tis ; for we think of ye sitting there, wi' your ?w«et iaice, and when we leave the room we just .bow to the empty chair, and the undersigned heaves a daily sigh for .the days when yell be there In tact again, as ye still are in spirit to all of us. . . . Mr. Amos Storey has called twice, and once his good lady, which we take es a nice condescension on her part ; though we are a proud community. Nevertheless, !Mrs. Storey toeing one of tine upper classes of the city, and. "what they call a leader in society, and our pride, nor yours, dear child, punning in that direction, we are fain to regard her visit as a special honour. IMr. Storey has "been more than kind in his inquiries after Mistress O'Hagan; and one evening he 6at quite a time and had a crack afoout ell manner at subjects, not forgetting our Zella, and recalling inci dents honourable and sweet in his know ledge of you. . . . We look forward to hear from ye ; and it will foe just a delight bo have your impressions of the Great Baby lon, which has merits of its own and' is vest, I have no doubt* though I have never seen it ; but of all the cities of. the "wide, wide world that would orepay man or woman la journey across the seas to investigate, it's Edinburgh, the classic capitol of the land of Burns end Scott, and the Athens of the modern world, ye ken. .... 80, God Ibless ye ! . ... Your servant amd friend,—-MAUCOLM GflJENCOgk'' Zella read the kindly Scotchman's letter, smiling through her tears at the memories it arou?ed. They seemed to belong to a far back distance of time, much of her adven turous life being crowded into so jfhort a period She' folded the screed up and re placed it in her wrKing-case ; and drew forth a still more characteristic epistle, beaming with Irish love and sentiment.. It was a scratchy scrawl from Bridget O'Ha gan herself, which Zella read over again,* •for the second time, puzzling out the bad spelling and the good .heart of it in some what the following terms :■— "Ay ye plaze, my dear Zella, swate col leen, I'm betther. It was a baa time I was 'avin', me darlint; but wusb whin yed gone, and I not havin' the privilidge to bless ye, and ask the Howly Mother's protection for ye. And the loneliness ay it all, and the mourning ; and me that wake who shud been strong, goin' off infer a faint .;- me, as was nivver customed to the likes ; but the Blessed Virgin and the Swate Savyet they kep me, and they've kep you safe, awl you none the wuss foekase "ay yer'Drave heart and the mettle you got from yer noble father, that he was a great soldier ; and it was cheerin' to me to know as you was not takin' on, as most -wimmin wud, at the untimely death of the dear feller. And shure, whin Im well enuff to be about I'll be afther seem' tho pallia, myself, in regard ay that villin Dlgges, as imbriide his hands with his blvd. I niver thinks ay it but me heart bleeds the more for you than him, ay course, for hes in Abram's busim, and thfc angels is watehin' over his luv, which Is you, my .dear. It takes me days to write this, not bein' kustomed to sittin, but I am sittin' up doin' ay it, and from time to time. Ould Glencoe and the bar- tinder's widdei and the Senltor, they all siads ther foes xispee'e, likewise his good lady. And its O that I was wid ye, me" darlint, and we'd cross the chanl ana make • tracks for .Connemiara and tho dear ould land. God cay it ! tho' I'm afeared they'd all be gone to hlvvin, the bhoys as I knowd. But it ain't no gud tmnk in' ay it. But ye won't let thim thavln Saxons, savin' the raimiry ay Misther Glover, stale yer heart from Amirlky and Chicago and Parkside, and yer dear ould Merrikan muther that luya you wuss than . if ye was truly* her ovn. It's a decayvin' city, that same Lundun, with traps for the unwari and willins, blarney for young and purty gels ; but I trust ye, me darlint, strong in ycr virchu, tho I kno yeve no rasn to trust thim Saxon Nights, if such thejf be, similar tho different to thim as Tom Moore, ay 'saintly mimry made the ballad ay that yeve heard me spake, and that ye giv me hints in the resytin avit. So, now, I think yeve got all the noos ther is, tho its not much, bekase there aint nawthin gone on widout ye ; and wid an ould womans blessin, and may the swate saints presarv and kape ye, I remane, yer luvin respectful friend-. and" muther,— Bridget O'Hagan." Zella fold-ed the missives up and replaced them in her portfolio, Intending, on a later day, to answer them, and have the letters mailed from Queonstovvn. She would have plenty of time. It was long since she had had so much leisure as was now bafore her. Until the second day out she had occu pied herself mostly in resting, reading old letters, and looking at one or two new books, alone in her room. It was not until the morning of the second day that both she and Mr. Hiram Dexter met t with an equal surprise in the first and unconnected list of passengers. He was no less startled to read there the name of Miss Zella Brun- nen than she was to come upon the entry , of " Mr. Hiram Dexter and servant." Now ' she was indeed confirmed In the wisdom of maintaining her disguise. She saw in it'tha' compensating hand of Fate. At .the same time, the fact that her name was on the ship's list would compel her to-be extremely | careful to order her life on board so that ; she might not arouse suspicion. Retiring to her room to consider the situation, she recalled minutely her last interview with Dexter, and his baEe and brutal attempt to blacken the. character of Ned Glover. She ' had been so engrossed -with her "mission to .■ Platts Valley ever- since that everything! else bad, more or less, gone out of her memory. She had put on, with her new clothes, such a new Individuality that she -had at times quite forgotten herself. \- It was on the second day out that she •saw, shambling along the deck, an old man, ' who, every now and then, drew himself up, ! stiffened his back, in an effort to make out to himself, or lor the behoor of others, th?t he was nothing like so "old as he might ap pear ; that he was simply tired, or~over worked, or not quite well, or what hot. In epite of his behaviour to her, notwithstand ing his malicious slander of her lover'b good name, she felt sorry for him. She remem bered him, during her first days at the Palmer House, bright, alert, optimistic, an old beau. She saw him now—thin and shri velled, his head bent, except when he ap ;peared to raise it with an effort at defiance, though it was really the action of despair. She saw him sitting in his steamer chair, "his legs wrapped up in-a great rug by the attentive Sam, taking no notice of Sam's affectionate care, arranging his cushions, placing the chair at a pleasant angle m the sun, yet with the possibility of a reasonable, shade ; he simply gazed out to sea, as she had found herself from time to time gazing, as one does in mid-Atlantic, wondering at the mystery of it, feeling one'B own little ness, and watching the wake of-the mighty vessel, making its trackless track ovor the paths of thousands of predecessor ships, now and then leaving for a few seconds a trace able impression upon the sea. . . . Un happily for Dexter's peace of mind, added' to his other sins, he had upon his soul the murder of Edwin Glover. His mental condi tion, lowered by drink and sleeplessness under his mad passion for Zella Brunnon, had received a great shock in the announce ment of the death of Ned Glover. While that dark business had been brewing, while he was waiting for news from Abner Diggea, he had set on foot the hideous plot to de stroy Glover's character in the eyes of Zella, which Bridget O'Hagan had so cleverly and courageously frustrated. The. Instruments he had used in this business had degraded him in his pwn estimation, not only as a man, but as*a man of resource and ability. He had found himself, by-and-hy, the play thing of an astute woman of the town, and the dupe of one of her agents. From Dexter the man of affairs he had sunk into Dexter the profligate. • After a youth of work and enterprise, and a manhood of respectability and honour, he had, in his comparative old age, become a creature of passion, a pander to his own vices, a drunkard, and a suborner of murder. ... In his intermittent moods of sanity he realised all this, and it drove him to seek relief in the friendly oblivion that may be found in alcohol, which, in this respect, is rather a good than an evil thing, for what else better than a dreamless sleep can Guilt desire than to be pleasantly, flkna recklessly mad in srmoathetic company, champagne for the presiding genius ? . . . The best antidote, the only antidote, indeed, for the vlleness that Dexter had permitted himself is repentence and penance, con fession, compensation, an austere life de voted to the good of others ; but Dexter had no longer any gift that way. Such intel lectual force as Temained to him crumbled at the touch of-the smallest good resolution. He assuredly had fits of remorse, but they developed to no good purpose; they were lurid lights passing ove? a mental slough of incipient madness. If «ver once there had been a time since the death of Glover when remorse might have been strong enough for repentance and a penitent spirit of. com pensation In the way of good deeds, it was" defeated by a rush to the bottle, the de generate's medium to a lower abyss. . CHAPTER XL.—Hiram Dexter Sees Ghosts. On the third day out Zella; who sat at the purser's table, came within the observation ol Dexter for the first time. .He occupied a seat lit the captain's table, that had hitherto been vacant. She was conscious that he was watching her in a furtive kind of way. He was drinking champagne. Sam was standing behind his <chair. It was evident that he was regarded as a persona grata by the captain and the other passengers.' " Dexter, the millionaire," said the purser to Zella. " " First time lie's been down to dinner. Looks awfully bad, don't he ? It ain't all beer and skittles being a million aire. I can speak.from experience ; I've seen most of them, during my time on the Umbria." "Poor fellow ! he does not, as you say, look as if wealth*agreed with him," Zella replied. . . ..■■''.'. " I have never seen, the man that it did agree with." "No ?" •-'.,.■. ' "• ' " Always some disappointment on hand. "V^brrled with every movement of stocks ; or, with a wife -with a heart-aching desire to' get into society that don't want hex ; or Jhere are sons who behave badly ; or a daughter who won't marry for position. Or, if it's an Englishman* he's dying for a title, becauso his good lady wants it ; an Ameri can, to get the control of a railway or boss a bank, or own the fastest trotter, or some oilier tin-pot thing or another. Never con tented, T assure you ; that's my experience; not to mention that their digestion's out of order, they've got dyspepsia ; always tin leering with doctors. Why, it isn't lon~ since a millicriaire, one of the African crew, chucked himself overboard." " Is that so ?" " Couldn't bear the strain. Got an id?a that he had overrun tho constable ; thought, when he arrived in London, he'd be busted." " Don't say ?" " On the contrary, he was one of the rich est of the African lot. But it must' bfe hard to carry a pile, if you let it bother you ; it would never bother me." " Nor me," said Zella. " But the fact is, the people who could carry improperly, and know how to spend i it tj^l^ltok^^e of the world in general, they never get it. Look at this poor DcxV ter; he's One of the wealthiest nien id America. ... Do you see how he keeps looking this way ?. Seems as if he knew you, or wanted to—-can hardly keep his eyes ~* off you." . ' .'..-..• "Surely," said Zella, "he's looking.to wards a pretty woman at .the next table-? They say he is quite a gallant among tho ladies." ■.->-.- ■ "Used to be/ said the purser. "Pool enough to fall in. love->lth a typewriting girl ; thought he could buy her ; accustomed to buy everything-he wanted; as he couldn't buy her, he took to drink and other women, and has .been going to th-e bad ever since," said the purser. " You don't say !"'said Zella. " Who has been telling you the old gentleman's secrets ?" # . " Uncle Tom,1; said the purser,' laughing; Calls himself -Slam ; but,- if «ver theTe wasi an 'Uncle Tom' out of .Mrs.' Stow*?s T)ookv there he is ; and if you want to know all about •' Massa,' ' 'Iram Dexter,' why, ' gol* , ly,' Uncle Tom will oblige." v Dexter seemed to be inviting all his neigh bours to drink with him. Sam and tho stewards were pa??ing the wine up and down the table, the millionaire raising his glass with a; benevolent greeting all round. Pre sently, he spoke to Sam,-aside, and'Satn< went over to the purser's table, bottle in hand, with " Ma?sa Doxter's complimnnt?, and won't the cjeffYlnien nY la^U-s do hTm the honnoh.to take wine -via him?" ' • The ladies niostlv declined The purser. and several of the men accepted the invita tion. Zella declined. She was not drinking wine to-day. Sam emptied, the bottle, and • fetched another, and with it,' " Massa's com pliments to the' y"oung gen'elman an' hopes hell-give him the pleas'ah ?" " Thank your master," said Zella, " and I must postpone the pleasure until some otler day ; I am not taking wine." Sam, with a puzzled expression in his eyes, poured out a glass of wine, for Zella,- '-■ all the same, as if he liad not heard whr«S she said. He glanced at-her again, "as Ji« filled up other glasses, and returned to his master. - ' . When the dinner was over Zella went to ; her room, and had' coffee brought there. It ■ was a calm, sunny day. She sat with her. cabin door ..open and smoked a cigarette. Dexter, leaning on Sam's arm, passed by, and -Daused for a moment, aB if he wera about to speak to her. Zella looked at him quite unconcernedly, an Jhe went on. f "Tight!" said the purser, standing in the doorway.. "Says he feels sure he knows you, thous-i he can't recall any one of th€ name of Phillip Clrey." ; "Indeed," said Zella. "May I offer yoa a cigaivtte. ?" "Thank you, no; I'm going into the smokeroom. The millionaire is to sit in at a, mild game of poker with a few pals ; he gave them a game in his state-room last night, but he saya he prefers the smoking room. He couldn't get a deck cabin ; wanted the captain's ; but he left It to the la?t minute ; only made up his mind to cross a couple of hours before sailing, Uncle Tom says, and he don't know what he's going to Europe for. Sam evidently thinks.. he's a bit mad ; and everybody else knows he is." -^ "How sad!" said Zella. "The miseries of the rich is the consola tion of 'the poor," said the purser. "So the doctor says, and he ought to know ; lie's as poor as they make 'em." . ; ; Zella closed her door, drew the blinds', over the portholes,, flung herself upon her, couch, and presently -fell asleep, and dreamt that Dexter had drowned himself.  At dusk she wrapped herself up in her ulster and went on deck. Pacing to and fre, in an aimless way on boardship, some to get up an appetite, some by way of-a constitutional, some out-of simple restleasr ' ness, she met Dexter several times. Twice, in the lamplight, she caught sight, of hi 3 face, puckered and anxious ; twice, he saw; hers plainly, and stood still to look at her.- She thought it wise to retire to her cabin. She 'had a light supper sent up to her. After supper she put out her lamp and left the. portholes partly open for the benefit of. the air. The night was warm, and with ari al most silent'sea. On a seat, close by her. cabin, two men sat and talked. Many a queer conversation has tieen overheard' through tftfe portholes of deck cabins. Zella lying upon her couch, might easily have spared herself from the temptation of eaves dropping. She had, indeed, risen to oloSe the ports, when, hearing her name, she paused, more out of self-defence than'froni curiosity. , . ; " ". Philip Grey," said the voice ; " a nice sort of young chap ; the sight of him seems to have sobered Dexter." 1 " How's that 1" said the second voice evi dently that of an American. " Says if ever she had a brother, that's • him." "And who's she ?" asked the American. "He aon't say, but the1 nigger shakes hia head and lifts up his hands, palms out, aa much as to let you -understand that Dsxter's dotty," the Englishman replied. " I guess he didn't seem dotty when he ■ picked up a full to my flush," said the American. \ " He's been wandering about the deck ;' wouldn't have Sam with him ; would go* alone ; and he's Just now told the purser that there's a ghost aboard. The purser, chaffing him, says, 'Man or woman, sir?' And the millionaire, he pulls up straight, and he says, ' The ghost of a man and th? face of a woman he should have married ; but •' And there he stopped ; repeated tho story to the ' but,' and then crept nwayV as if the ghost was after him." " D.T. 1" ejaculated the American. "Think co ?" •■ " Sure so !" " I thought a men was dangerous undo* those circumstances, and had to be re strained 1" " Ain't you ever had —er—so much as-« well, a touch of 'em ?" " Never." " You have always been a sober man?" " 'Mostly." " Then you've escaped a lot of misery. VH sooner sco ghosts than snakes and bottle Imps." " Hope you may never see either," said the Englishman. " Let me offer you an other cigar ?" " Thank you." i Then there 'was a striking of matches*. "Iflawe rat,-along-the beam in my state- i room, last night, just ac Iws turning off the light ; aad I mea terrified to death, tear it wasn't one." i ''iFior fear It wasn't ion* !" said ' the Engliehjman, .with * note.of surprise in the tone of t01.9 Tplca, . -. . ; |f I ehould smile;J.. Wiif/ you don't .tell •me you. don't understand'? Do you think ST wanted it to'; be one of ttiese. other rats ?" "Oh! .1 see," eaid -" the . Englishman, laughing. , ..,■?-■' "I guess youulo," staid .the other; "ain't euch a granger as that, I reckon. Not /one, •to Iblow the gas out?" "No ; not quite such a fool as that," said (he Englishman. ..■■;-. "The purser reckons it was a rat ; they get 'eni once in a. way, along Vhe gaag jjlanke, In dock; actually lie quiet till; eight, and then just invade the snip. He's disturbed them himself, in droves." "i?eally ?" :" Fact, I assure you." "He says so ■?"•-• ' ■ j "On ibis oath." "Then why do they leave toe gang-planks in connection with the shore at uig-/it 1" " Why do they do twenty other Cool things ?" rejoined the American. Then Zella went out once more. upon 'deck. It was a anonlight night. She sat for a few minutes In the shadow of a venti lating ehaft, watching the long white track ,bh€ imoon was making and peopling it with J-'maginary angels, when once more she .hoard her name ; this time her-real naane," jmde the voice of-Dexter. (He wae speaking 10\. the purser. ' ••'Ht^ was taken in the name of Zella Brantien," said,, the purser. '..'.•■■ v " When >was —it—taken"?" -asked "Dexter, . filblwly, as if it twos difficult for him to speak plainly. "Oh, about «. week ago." " And did-rdld —shie—come aboard ?" # " t suppose not. The understanding was that if she could not occupy it, she would transfer if to Mr. Philip Grey, her cousin ; which she did." . "Her cousin !" said Dexter. " And—was it—you—that—er—said Ned Glover was—on board 1" "Me .? No ! I never heard the name, to my knowledge." " No—l suppose—not. Wonderful moon, ain't it ? Do you b'lieve—that Christ walked on the sea ?" . " Oh, yes ; why, of course/ -Don't'you, Mr. Dexter ?" ' ' • ■ " I don't—b'lieye anything—except that I tell, you—again—there's ghosts—on this ship——". " One-of. your countrymen has been telling me there's rats. Some fellows call 'em snakes, some rats, some little black devils ; you cali 'em ghosts, Mr. Dexter. If I was you, I'd see the doctor ; he knows how to deal with such things." " Doctors ain't no—good to me, purser. See., here, you've been kind —to me—l want to give, you—a tip." Then there was a pause, as if Dexter was thrusting something into the purser's hand, _ and as if the purser resisted him.'. " It's your, pocket-book, Mr. Dexter! I couldn't think of it." " ff ou've a wife and fam'ly—you told me so—not too well off. I'd like to make—you happy. Somebody's—got to be made happy. . I know what —you mean. might say— I had given it you when I was drunk—or you took it—when I was dead." "Mr. Dexter,- come along, and let's have a drink with the doctor." "I have written a letter—it's in this .pocket-book.' The letter says—why I give it you—and'-it contains a few thousand —dol- lars—-and a cheque-book, with—the power—; to draw a few—more. If you won't—have', •it, I'll chuck—it. overboard." ! "Oh! Mr. Dexter, don't do that." "Then take it!" ■ " " You are too kind, Mr. Dexter," said the purser,'- evidently taking the pocket-book. " You think — er — I've — er—got—D.T. ? Think—l'm—drunk ?" . "No, Mr. Dexter; I would not be bo jrude." • "I have been drunk. Had 'em, I—dare nay—but I never was soberer than I—am how. : Good night—old chap. I'm going to turn" in now. Where's—my man?" "I'll find him for you, Mr. Dexter," said. the purser ; and 'they went into the gang way. v~ Zella slept badly that night. She lay in bed watching'-the glints of moonlight on the distant vista of sea that she saw occa * eionally. . . Whether it was midnight, or later, she did not know; but it was soon after the striking of bells and the soothing ?'All's well !" ot the watoh, that one of the portholes was gradually eclipsed by a face, with eyes that for a moment seemed luminous. It was the faca of Hiram Dex ter. She shrank back into her berth, and held her breath. It disappeared. She -.Wondered If she toad been dreaming. No ; she felt sure she had not. Dexter had penetrated her disguise, and had been '-re connoitring her cabin. She drew her (blinds, turned on the electric light in a small reading lamp, and wont to sleep, and . awoke no more until lata in the morning. Looking at her' watch, aha found it was 11 o'clock. She dressed and rang the bell. " Bring me some bre&kftast;, steward." " Yes, sir. What'll you have ?" " Coffee and toast, and whatever else is going."
