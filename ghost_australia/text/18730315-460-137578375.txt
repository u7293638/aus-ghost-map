ENTERTAINMENTS. THE THEATRES, &c.; On Monday night, at the Theatre Royal, Mr. Fairclough and Mademoiselle Legrand made their first appearance in Australia as Hamlet and Ophelia respectively. I will 6peak of the lady first. She has a French accent, which, off the Btage, is perhaps neither a fault nor a misfortune. On the stage it is certainly the latter. She has not a sympathetic voice, she cannot sing, and she has neither power, feeling, norsensibUity. It is difficult, therefore, to conjecture why she should ever have thought she could play Ophelia, and it is still more difficult to under stand why anybody else should have per suaded her she could j)lay it It is true that Madame Celeste had a French accent, but it is also true that she balanced tliat stage defect by a degree of power and smrUaalili, which helped one almost to forget her halt ing English. Besides, she never ventured upon Shakspeare. Itis possible Mademoiselle Legrand may have a place in the profession of acting, but it is certainly not in the direc tion of Shakspeare's heroines. It is testing the courtesy of an audience to an uufair ex tent, and it is certainly subjecting the lady to considerable risk, for the management to allow'her to play such a part. Mr. Fairclough's selection of Hamlet as his opening character, of necessity, challenges the criticism of comparison: for we have had some excellent Ham* lets in Melbourne, and among them, I think, the best in tlie world. I c$nj not well conceive a more complete rcalisaj tion of the character than that given us' by Walter Montgomery, and therefore, &lm6st; instinctively, I take his as the gauge o( measurement, by which to estimate thafc oi any other actor. His Hamlet was dreamy^ thoughtful, introspective, and fitfully pas* sionate. In fact, it was the Hamlet of Shak? speale: Nobody BO completely "as Mont* gomery ever helped me to understand th^ Composite nature of Hamlet. His intellect: his pver-eensitiveness, his warmth of affect tion, his burning pa^sionforrevenge, Jus listlessriess, his aptness to 1?e "caught by merely passing trifles/his ptiUosop^ic.leanj ings, and his assumed madn^.wereaUmailq to appear with «n unmistakable distinct) ness. Montgomery"lie* highest prftiBe for all these 'qualltie&. birt^ thought only of' the Print* of Debftjelrk: ^ his Borrows. When I saw him, no place for criticism, because sympathy toot the place .of criticism. ; And,,this, of evoking sympathy, I ta&e; to 'be 'T sufficient test of the highest' abffitjy $ X actor. If fee can but ihtike' an &Mleij;£ forget him, and think only of the dha^al he plays, there is little iear of his givhw unqualified satisfaction. 1N0w.it: in by this test I .have estimated ,M& Fai^u^ and the result is that I find him JxHjeaiL exceedingly painstaking actoi;WWWs%. plied himself to the Study'of kife ati'witli lh earnestness and a conscientious desire^ master its difficulties; which i do Km vita great credit. No commendation c^n be toj. high for the care with whiph he haa-evj. dently analysed the part by whicll^ has elected to be Judg^ 4n iilelfeitiSi He has manifestly apprbached 'it'7%ifli the zeal and assiduity of an itiduft. trious student, eager to develops all capabilities, . He has not failed to,mX sur,e his own conception, of it, with thg ejg».. rience of otters, and to adppt, iii his r<pr| sentation, whatever a judi^bus expeftfiiu^ has pronounced to be auxiliary to' the duction of its legitimate effect He has employed all reachable aids, in the ^ of" elocutionary adornment, ana has' ,c^> culated the effects of . contrast with ait artistic discernment. Hence hisperfotmtoie is a pleasing one. It does not offend; It. does not make one urioomfortableby; de. partures from a well understood con^ctoeap. On. the other hand, it never surprises oiaie into unmeasured admiration. I speak, o£ course, of its effect upon myself, anddon6t forget that feome portions were received by, it may be, a majority of the audience with boisterous applause. But the boisterous: applause of pit and gallery is not the test a really great actor desires to be. judged by. We have had actore in ferior to Mr. Faircloiigh in Melbourne, and they have taken the pit and galleiyty storm; but they did not, therefore, establish, their claim to be regarded as even good actors by competent judges. Of the.lopd demonstrations of approbation manifesto! by the audience on Monday night, the loudest (it is only the truth to say) were not evoked by Mr. Faircloush's best efforts. It is, no doubt, a great temptation to an-actor to obtain by vehemence, that which is denied to the subtler niceties of representation. Jt is so much easier, too, and, considering how preponderating an element vanity isia every man's moral organisation, I can easily understand, if not altogether pardon, an actor who seeks his principal reward in such outbursts. For myself, however, I liked Mr. Fairclough least when he indulged in these demonstrations, and I liked him best as, I perceived how careful he was to avoid merits ing the imputation. of staginess, novr studiously he refrained from recognising the audience, how desirous he seemed to give to the colloquial portions of the text an easy conversational quality, and how well he refrained from mere stalking, striding, and attitudinising. Mr. Fairclough is rather , below the middle height, and of somewhat slight build, but his features have not the ! expression of youth, and he refuses the re | sources of art to communicate the ex j pression. Hence he looks worn, somewhat i haggard, and middle-aged-circumstances [ which do nqt by any means help the illusion He disdains the light flaxen hair which is so I ethnologicaUy appropriate, and to picli ve ) have become accustomed, and he' 'wearsen i bis breast an enormous star which pw®'° 1 stage finery, I thought all modem'MJ» had by this time abandoned. He has fault in the quieter passages of occasionally dropping his voice at the end of a sentence, so that the words become inaudible, ana tie emphasises the letter R somewhat un* necessarily. He has not had the C0F^>,. to discard some of the conventional modes or pronunciation which,-since John Kenwe time, haye been adopted by one actpr arer another. For example; be 'pf&Bttfiees; uj word ''gape'' osif it werespelt" he sounds the "i"in" evil "and "devil the "i" in "ill." Of variable-Wrings, Fairclough adopts some which are "l"® j, able. For example", he say? ? instead of "sweep to jny revenge, _? shaw" instead of "handsaw," troubles" instead of "sea of trou . "groan and sweat" instead ot k and sweat" Ipiperious Cffisar,. - stead of "Imperial Caesar;" -et. poison quite o'erthrowe," instead 0. ^ crows my spirit;" and* instead of ^ such bitter husittess as the day wou to look on/'.he'sayB,And do ****£. as the better day,"&c..; Itisonlydue Jowp, however, to say, that to -some ®®? cosl. readings, his good judgment }®^snever. mended. It is clear,, from thelesB, that he has carefully »ith the purpoae and that he htoMedtis omdarMW, the adoption of theseseveral . ffeU ' <1 diligence which,_ at any ipfo both for his intelligence ® r 'jjrj W His most effective meeting with tlie t&qsk; . scene he was less. was and an undue demonstrati ^. ^t renting Uamlefsregard ftr h* ^ he ina^e'.a.sood. off» *1* scene, , when, instead. cufelonjaiy, With'the conffi® sat down ' opposite to 'the uncle, and savagely p^noun , _ ^ "And 3 worse remains ®ev madea«ooddealtf£JWfi' his toonrier ¥ia . to shoW ' the' '? conflict ehort of conveying tha* effect but the subsequent flCenewith<La *RUi too violent.

Mrs. Steele's Oueen, and Mr. O'BrienVi Pokmius are the newest part of the cast to a Melbourne audience. Mrs.' Steele was most warmly re ceived, ae she deserved to be, and she played the Queen with an impressive dignity which could hardly be distanced. In the closet scene, herrepresentatidn of, the varied emo tions of terror, contrition, and despair was strikingly truthful . Her rich, crisp, distinct voice wis most agreeable to the ear, and her perfect intonation made it something more than an ordinary pleasure to .'listen to her. Mr. O'Brien's Polonius was a judi cious and careful performance, but an occasional inaccuracy in the text, took away to feome extent from its agreeableness. Mr. Ireland played the King well, as he always did. Mr. Appleton played Laertes better than his Wont, and his . wont. was always more than respectable. Mr. Har wood's Ghost was of its customary high degree of merit. Mr. Greville's First Gravedigger was, as it always is, racily humorous, and MissForde's Osric was pretty and graceful without being overdone. The scenery was, as a matter of course, all new, and the general effects were managed with the care which might be expected of the management of the leading theatre in the Auetralias. The tragedy has been repeated each night during the week, and on Monday Mr. Fair clough is to appear in " llichard the Third." It ig to he hoped that the management will perceive their own interest sufficiently to apportion the female parts in this and other pieces with a proper reference to the resources they possess in the stock company. The farce during the week has been " A Case of Pickles," and as the surburban portion of the audience objected to its being used as a playing-in piece, it was used after tlie first three nights as an afterpiece, though really I cannot see the necessity for any thing beyond the tragedy when, "Hamlet" is played. Mr. Rickards has gone to Ballarat, and other places, pending the preparation of Mr. Walch's burlesque-which however should, hi order to have gained all the advantage possible, have been produce^ while the comedy was " in the full tide of its Access. The performances at the Poly technic have been varied by the panorama of the Siege of Paris, and to-night a Danish basso profondd named Valdeinar is still further to vary the entertain ment. The minstrels at St. George's Ilall maintain their popularity, and to-night " An Australian wonder 12 years old " is to sing. The cause of charity has been liberally sup ported on two occasion^" during the week. On Tuesday, the exceedingly pleasantly-varied entertaiumeut .at the Asssmbly-]iaU, St. JUda- aid of the Hospital for Sick Chil «ren, took place. I mentioned last week the refection that was to be provided, I liavek to record this week at it gave the , highest satisfaction. ?
