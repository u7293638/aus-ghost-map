Midnight Surprise. Here is a true story which happened to me last Christmas Eve when living in Bath 'road, Worcester. I was reading a ghost story at-: midnight, when I was suadenly startled by a peculiar'creaking noise in the room. Terror seized me, and I was just about to rush for the dcor when I received a heavy blow on my head. How long I lay stunned I do not know, but when i recovered, my wife, with half'a dozen friends looking on, was bathing my forehead. My face was bruised, and alto gether I must have looked a pitiable right. . On inquiring about the *' ghost," X was told'a large pumpkin, which had been hang* ing directly over my head, had fallen. The bit of tape that supported it was found nibbled in several places. Zt seemed a mouse had gnawed at it (which acconnted for the peculiar noise I heard), until the weight of the pumpkin could not be supported, and it fell on top of me. *
