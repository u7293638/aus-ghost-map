The two priests never met during the 28 years referred to until last week. A dispicable trick was .played a few days ago upon an old resident o I this district, and the fact that he is blind makes it all the more cowardly on the part of the perpe trator.

A sample of the Cadbury's chocolate al leged to have been taken by Dr. Nansen to the Artie Regions, was given us at the Hawkesbury Show, by the representative of the firm, and after three years' travelling through icy regions the sample appeared equal to that quite recently manufactured.
