ROYAL SOCIETY OF VICTORIA. II The monthly meeting of the above society was held last evening in the Society a halt Mr R J, Ellery presided Mr Norman Taylor, the Rev J J. Halley, and Mr C M'Lean were balloted for and elected associates Mr BOSISTO, M L A , read extracts from a voluminous and interesting paper by the Rev. Mr Codrington, with notes by the Rev. Lorimer Fison, on the manners and customs of the Motu natives of the Navigator Islands the subjects dealt with in this paper comprise the Systems of relation Ship, land tenure, relations of the Boxes may nage customs, intercourse between relations by marriage and adoption, the custom of killing the aged and sick, infanticide, the belief of the natives in the east of the soul in dreams, and in ghosts, c It was resolved that the paper he printed and the thanks of the Society be conveyed to Mr Codrington and Mr 1 ison, through Mr Bosisto Mr COSMO NEW RLRY then read the following paper on " Some New Localities for Minerals -" - new locality of zeolites has been found by Mr Norman Taylor at the corporation, quarries, Merri Creek Mr Taylor found fine drives and cry and a, of chocolate and phill parte many of the crystals being 1 larger than any previously discovered Since then Mr Rule has found very fine crystals of dragoman, perfect hexagonal prisms and pjrnrnidB Mr Taylor has given me the following note of the mode of occurrence -"the basalt at the Merri Creek corporation quarries has been erupted in different (Iowa IheBurfaceiavcaicularandpartlj decomposed, passing don nw yards through largely vesicular into dense rudely columnar basalt The cavities in the vehicular parts are coated with carbonate of lime Below this is a very vesicular decomposed basalt, the surface of an older flow In some places it is changed into soap clay s The case tried in many parts are coated with mammillatcd ferrocalcite, and a soft white hydrous dolomite of about the consistence of soft putty It sometimes may be procured in masses several inches in diameter Some of the lumps are covered by a thin crust of hydrous silica The soft maBBCB seem gradually to part with water, and become converted meanness of colo mile An analysis of a died portion have Carbonate of magnesia, 7131 carbonate of line, 23 SO, carbonate of iron, 130, water, 110, total 99 51 in some of the cavities this mineral is in the form of the so called ' rock milk, but that mentioned by Dana is carbonate of lime, not magnesia The water, separated from the solid mineral, contains 1 he, 535, and silica in solution The basalt becomes denser below this to the floor of the top quarry, which seems to be the top of a still lower How in this top quarry are found rarely the fine cry Btalaof aragonite mentioned the ordinary radiating masses of dragoman are common the geodetic minerals begin to occur at the floor of this quarry or ledge , as yet only chocolate and pluUipsite have been identified the basalt they occur in is dense and contains cavities of all sizes, the bottoms of which are covered with a deposit of greenish greasy clip, usually covered with the, crystalline, transparent, oolitic crust (undetermined), but not either of those already found On this occur cale spar and dog tooth Bear in orange brown crystals, and often on them again have been deposited the chocolate and philhpsite, which also line the upper portions of the cavities Sometimes the isolates occur perfectly crystallised on the ends of thin needles of sale spar, a fresh cavity looking as if the needles held glittering drops of dew in suspension The Zeolite often occur together in the same cavity, and seem to have been deposited simul laneouBlj Peculiar lumps generally loaded with fine crystals, occur in many cavities As these dumps are part of the basalt and, the have probably been formed by pressure on the cavities during the cooling of the molten basalt The Zeehan appear to be more numerous where water has percolated through the basalt The water contained in the cavities is highly charged with mineral matter Only a small quantity has yet been obtained for examination lins gave a residue on evaporation equal to 1 percent, consisting of chlorides of calcium, Sodium, and aluminum, with silica and ammonia, and may be looked on as the mother liquor from the crystallization of the Zeehan Another zeolite, stilling, has recently been found, for the first time in Victoria, as a cn 3 falling v em in the mesozoic sandstone near Ceres bridge Barrabool hills Bmdhiemite hydrous antimonial of lead-is another mineral new to us , has been found with the stemming from the Murrindal lead mine" Mr Rule has reported the occurrence of both these minerals Pyrolusito, new to Victoria, is found as the cementing medium of a receipted quartz- conglomerate in the ranges some 15 miles from Moe, Gipps Land The crystals re small, almost microscopic PungBtite, also new, occurring with wolfram and scheelite, is reported by Mr Rule from a reef in a hill near the cemetery, Maldon Scorodite -Some interesting occurrences of this arsenate of iron have been found at Bethanga and Dry Creek, Strathbogie Ranges They are both auriferous The Bethanga specimens are mason of and earthy, and of concretionary formation The Strathbogie Bcorodite is in thin VCIIIB in a large auriferous dyke, these veins being evidently the result of the decomposition of arsenical pyrites in still Some of the replies referred to were produced by Mr Newbery, and were examined by the members present with much interest
