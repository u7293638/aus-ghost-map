BOUDIOR CONFIDEBCES. \---------------------------- (By "PORTIA.") \---------------------------- SYDNEY, Wednesday. The Ladies' Military Bazaar at the Town Hall was begun yesterday. I must say it is one of the most attractive things so far held in Sydney. One hundred and fifty fair ones conduct the sales, and their gowns are designed to represent the Australian Horse, Lancers, Bushmen, Artillery, Gordon High- landers, Naval Brigade, Knights Templars, and Nightingale Brigade. Each lady sells from a bell tent; that is, from a tent like a sugar loaf, only more so, and the idea be- ing novel does a correspondingly large busi- ness. A very interesting exhibition of war trophies is provided in addition--guns, swords, letters, passports, and, oh, such a number of Queen's chocolate boxes. The ad- mission yesterday, the opening day, was 2s 6d, but "on and after," &c.;, it is to be 1s, while you can get a season ticket for 4s 3d. ******************************* Have just read it:-- The heading of the inscription sent on the wreath of the Princess of Wales to rest on the coffin of Mrs. Gladstone ran, "In memory of Mrs. Gladstone." The verse un- derneath read "It is but crossing-with a bated breath, A white set face!-a little strip of sea; To find the loved ones waiting on the shore, More beautiful, more precious, than be- fore." "ALEXANRDRA." ***************************** What pernicious papers some of those specially prepared women's journals are, to be sure! I have one before me, and as I turn over the leaves a feeling of very great loathing takes possession of me, for what after all must be a popular taste. There is a love story of the worst kind, flippant and foolish, a sensational serial ditto, an "as- trological" page, where fortunes are told from handwriting, and a "palmistry" page of much the same character. As for the ad- vertisements, they are just as pernicious "Are you too fat," "Do you require a fine waist," "How to add two inches to your height," "Rosy Cheeks," &c.;, &c.; One advertiser publishes a list of nostrums of the following names:-"Beauty Cream," "Beauty Powder," "Rose Bloom," "Rose lip Salve," "Eyebrow Pencil," "Wrink- line" (for removing wrinkles), "Goldena" (for making red or any other hair golden), "Developer" (for improving the bust), "Anti Corpo" (for reducing corpulency), and "Snow Cream" (for whitening and softening the hands). This is the kind of literature that gets into the hands of young girls, and doesn't do them any good. ************************************** Motor cars are becoming quite common. A little while ago there was but one, and the innovation was sufficient to attract a newspaper paragraph. Then the people that stared as it sped along and the crowds that congregated when it came to a stand- still: Now there are more like a dozen, and nobody takes any special notice of them at all. They fly along the roads, guided in a most miraculous manner, and the crea- tures most startled appear to be the horses, some of them, when they see a motor, snorting and sidling horribly. Truly, peo- ple who are over fifty were born twenty years too early, for it strikes me that the best of the fun of the world is only just coming. ******************************* For instance, have you heard the phono- graph, or talking machine?-I mean a good one. A friend of mine bought one the other day that was good, and by carefully select- ing the, ''records" was able to get up a lit- tle concert. The trumpet, everything de- pends on it, was thirty inches long, and this had to be suspendef from a tripod. I think I am right when I say that a con- tralto lullaby was as good as the original, and quite as powerful; that a banjo solo was so perfect you expected to see the nigger playing it; and that a cornet solo was such a masterpiece as to draw a crowd in the street. Get a bad phonograph, which means a cheap one, and take any "records" offered you, and you will get a sickener, but buy a perfect machine, big trumpet and tripod, and then go to great trouble to get "records" that were good when made, and haven't been worn down since, and you will find everything quite as good as when ac- tually delivered by singer and player. *************************************** Art thou love sick? If so, here is an item of personal interest:----------- A Spanish scientific paper announces that Dr. Martinez Reguera has discovered a spring, the waters of which allay the pangs of one-sided affection. This remarkable well is situated at Alanje, and cases of well-night distracted swains being cured are quoted. Nothing is said as to an ex- tensive demand for the new love-philtre. A cure for unrequited love published in a black-letter book in the reign of Elizabeth seems equally efficacious. Is is as fol- lows: - '"Tye one end of a lope right over a beame, And make a slippe noose at the other ex- treame, Just under the noose lett a buckett be sett, On it lett the lovier moste manfullie gette. ''Righte over his heade lett Ithe snickett be gott --------------- And undere his eare well fastened the knott -- The buckett kicked cleare-lett him take a full swing --- And leave alle the reste of the worke too the stringe!" ************************************ As the Duke of York is coming, coming, coming, a word to say that if the Czar were to come instead no one would ever be able to tell the difference till he spoke. The likeness between them, always a great one, is now extraordinary, till many persons cannot tell one from the other. It is alleged that years ago, when they were both paying a visit to their grandfather, the King of Denmark, a sentry mistook one of them for a ghost. The Duke of York passed him, and he saluted, thinking he was the Czar, who was not then on the throne, by the way. A minute or two after the Czar actually did pass, and the sentry thinking it was a ghost dropped his gun, and ran into the guard room. In order to convince the un- fortnnate fellow of his error the two Princes went to him arm in arm, and explained their relationship. ***************************** I have before me a number of season catalogues issued by the various houses last week, but regret there is nothing I can use. Owing to the way they're got up it would be impossible to convey an adequate idea without pictures, the de- scriptions being meagre in the extreme. It will be remembered that I sent a pretty good list of gowns and hats a short time ago which was intended to show what all the houses are doing in this direction. If it isn't enough anyone desiring a hand- some illustrated catalogue of seasonable gowns and hats with prices has only to write to any of the big houses in New- castle and Sydney to get it by return post. **************************** Her Gracious Majesty is going to be me- morised in regard to Lord Beauchamp attending Mass. The people at the Town Hall the other night are going to ask him to send on that motion of censure they passed on him for what they esteemed bad taste. Though I am only a woman, I can forewrite the Queen's reply--nothing or worse than nothing in the shape of a snub. And for this very matter of fact reason---- the Queen's oath of non-attendance at Mass, &c.;, does not bind either her family or her representatives. She herself must defend the Faith of England, but her Go- vernors can defend what they like. She, like other Sovereigns of the House, must under the Act of Settlement be a Protes- tant, but any or all of her Governors can be Roman Catholics, and never attend any but Roman Catholic Churches during their whole tenure. Lord Gormanston's case should have prevented the heads of the recent meeting acting so foolishly. He was until recently Governor at Tasmania, and a most devout member of the Church of Rome. ************************** We have heard so much of the heoes of war, what of a line in praise of same of the heroes of peace ;----- It doesn't follow that a man or woman must do some deed of daring for all the world to hear about in order to be by na- ture as great and noble as those whose deeds have been recorded and whose names are known the world over. How many wo- men there are who have given up hopes of love with the man of their choice in order to devote their time and strength to their aged parents or invalid brothers and sis- ters. They do not go about shouting for all the world to hear of their sacrifice, but accept the burden in dignified and cheerful silence that sometimes misleads one into thinking that they are not hero- ines after all. Where are fathers, husbands, and brothers daily giving up the things that mean so much in life to them, and doing, in a noble and unostentatious fash- ion, deeds of charity, and renouncing that which perhaps would not seem much in the telling, but which was as sore and bit- ter in the performance as any of the trials of those heroes whom we read about. Life is not all selfishness, though, in the hurry- ing rush of money-getting many good im- pulses are crushed under foot, and so many real heroes brushed aside, that one hardly realises that after all there is much that is earnest and true walking daily side by side with us, taking part in our very existence, and becoming so much a part of our very selves that the good seems only commonplace and unworthy of notice unless it is flaunted about with waving banners bearing the legend : " This is self-sacrifice." ************************************** 'A neat way to help swell the receipts at charitable bazaars was hit upon by Ma- dame Melba. The other day Lord Richard Nevill received four autograph photos of herself for sale at the Melbourne Chil- dren's Hospital Bazaar, and these brought, what do you think ?-- £10 a piece, or £40 in all. Next to Madame having such a good opinion of herself as to think a shil- ling photo with her name on it worth £10, is the endorsement of that opinion by the Melbourne public. By the way, I read that Melba is becoming abnormally stout, and is trying "something" 'to reduce her superabundance. One of her pastimes is electric-yachting on the Thames, a sport that sounds very luxurious, to say the least df it. ********************* Regarding a woman's crown of glory :-------- Women sometimes appear to quite for- get that their hair is their crown of glory, and that if they neglect to keep it nice, no amount of money spent on ele- gant toilettes will make them present a pleasant appearance. Hair may look fluffy and carelessly ar- ranged,'and yet show that it is well cared for. Some faces, indeed, require an appa- rently careless style of hairdressing, but this effect must be brought about with art, and never by neglect. A first-rate tonic for the hair is sun- shine and fresh air. The Greek girls who sat on the city walls and gave their hair a daily sun bath were wise. The modern woman can't exactly follow their example, but at any rate she can refrain from tight- ly braiding her hair at night, and can leave it loose so that the air may get to it. Then when she washes her hair, which in summer should not be less often than once a fortnight, she can sit in a sunny window till it is dry. Sunshine does not dry the scalp as artificial heat is bound to do, but it gives life and vigour to the hair.
