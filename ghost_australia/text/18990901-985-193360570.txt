Popular Superstitions. Several years ago the inmates of a small, respectable dwelling-house in Philadelphia discovered upon the whitewashed wall of one of the rooms the likeness of a human face, which faded and returned again. The neighbours came in to view the wonder. Other faces came and vanished. Crowds thronged the house and street, and accounts of the mystery were printed in the daily papers. It was to no purpose that scientific men insisted that the figures were caused by mouldy growths which came and went to dampness, and that the likeness to the human face-' was imaginary. The house was pronounced by the public to be haqnted, and the owner was unable to find a tenant for it for years.

At first it was declared to be the ghost of a former ownffr, but when the pub lic took bold of the matter it was decided that each spectator saw a different ghost, that of the dead friend for whom he cared most. Many visitors made pilgrimages to inspect this defective pane of glass. Nor is it only the ignorant who are moved by these cheap mysteries.
