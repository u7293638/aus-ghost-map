A Queer Tenure. Various kinds of tenure of house pro- perty are recognised by English law— socage and fiefs, copyhold and leases— but it has been reserved for the Judge of the Whitechapel County Court to dis- cover in his jurisdiction an entirely new one—tenure by ghost. And it seems to be a very substantial one, much more tangible than anything the Psychical Re- search Society has yet been able to dis- cover. There is a house in Brook- street, Ratcliff Highway, which many years ago became honoured with the patronage of a ghost. Whether it was the shade of some sailor who remem- bered the glories of the highway and wished to revive his acquaintanceship with it, or merely what Homer calls a " naked, wandering, melancholy ghost, of no particular respectability, was never discovered ; in fact it was never seen, but as it made plenty of noise, and persisted in dancing hornpipes in clogs, it was supposed to be a relict of a sea- man accustomed to frequent the shee- beens which at one time abounded in the locality. All the inhabitants de- serted it, and for a long time the house was a kind of " No Man's Land," in which, no one would dwell until a daring adventurer named Beesley defied the ghost and his antics and rook up his residence in it. No one ever asked him for rent, and when he died he left to his widow the whole of his estate, con- sisting of the haunted house held on ghost tenure. In due time the lone woman married again—this time to a gentleman named Yates. —London "Tele- graph."
