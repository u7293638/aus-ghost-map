Legendary Fictions of the Irish Celts. (3) This is a booh of "Folk Lore," and is just ; as good as its author and his material can make it. It embraces household stories, legends of the "good people," witchcraft, sorcery, ghosts, and fetches; Ossianic and other early legends; andlegends of the Celtic sainte; with a glossary. It should be explained that Mr. Kennedy has made this collection of old stories so that they might not be lost, but might be, as they here are, available in a complete and handy form. The book is the more mature result of earlier efforts in magazine articles. Every lover of old world and early life stories will relish this book. Some of these stories are rich and rare; and what is more to the point is they contain most reliable information on primitive customs ont of which some of oar most stately institutions have grown up. Irishmen in Australia should get the book. "*
