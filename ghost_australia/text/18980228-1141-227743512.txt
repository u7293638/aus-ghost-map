CAULFIELD. By " POBTHOS." For the benefit of the uninitiated, It may be stated that the sand track next the rails (as a matter of fact, It la a mixture of-iand and ton) is one mile and a quarter and about twenty yards hi circumference, and the tan a few yards short of nine furlongs. " Even time " Is 15 seconds to the furlong. There was only a moderate amount of !oet work recorded last week, all the visiting teams, with the exception of those in charge of Messrs. Dargin and Frost, having deserted " the Heath " in favor of head-quarters. Several of the local Newmarket Han dicap candidates put up fast trial gallops, but nothing very wonderful when "the state of the tracks are taken into consi deration. The course proper was;as fast ea "greased lightning,11 and anything with pretensions to galloping ability epuld " break watches " without any difficulty. Therefore nobody out here (outside the Immediate stable connections) was sur prised when none of our candidates .suc ceeded in obtaining a place in the big sprint race. Orpheline was the nearest to the winner. The Trenton mare finished just behind Resolute; fifth, aud did better than her recent public and private form would have suggested. Fortuuio anaveloce both found them selves outclassed in the Newmarket, hut both ore very fit, and should earn win ning brackets in the near future. Battalion was our only winner last Saturday. As readers of these, notes kuow, iiic chestnut has been doing good work for some time, and had no trouble In silencing the opposition in the Essen- don Stakes. Carrying 9st 91b to victory in the Australian Cup will be a much more difficult task, but one that it is quite on the cards will be accomplished. Ldst ' Thursday morning Battalion executed a serviceable woridiia gallop on the eond, which, havrngheen well watered, was anything but fast. Without being "lmock about,:.VBattalion passed over the last mile and 1 jcl ..-quarter in 2mm 20jsec, and was escorted over the last six furlongs by Lochaber.
