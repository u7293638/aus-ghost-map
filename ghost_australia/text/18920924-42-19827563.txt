Music and the Drama. Gaiety Theatre. At the Gaiety Theatre on Monday night the management presented another programme for the entertainment of their patrons, which proved very acceptable to all present. Considering the attractions elsewhere there was a good atten dance, and judging by the applause which followed the various pieces the aodienoe were well pleased with the efforts made to amuse them. The fantoccini, including the aquarium with its marine wonders, and the Court Minstrels were again the subjeot of much applause, the latter especially provoking great merriment. "Blue Beard" was replaced by the pantomime of " Beauty and the Boast," and the movements of the puppets were so natural and lifelike that they at times almost deceived tbo spectators. The beautiful scenery and the rapidity with whioh it was changed also came in for their share of admiration. During the course of this piece a parody on the popular song " Ta-ra-ra-boom-de-ay" was introduced, and was accorded a hearty round of applause. In the harlequinade division, the comicalities and absurdities of the clown Joe and his mate Cauliflower caused intense amusement. The ghost scene especially was very much enjoyed. The whole entertain ment was much appreciated, and the audience called for encores in several instances, and in eaoh case the request was responded-to. The transformation Boenegwere 08 lovely as before, and the effects produoed may safely challenge comparison with any thing ordinarily seen on the stage. The per formance has been repeated every evening daring the week.
