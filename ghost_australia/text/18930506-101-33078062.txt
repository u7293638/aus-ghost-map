1 1 ? I * j; BIG BUTTER YIELDS. j HOLSTEIN", AND JERSEY COWS. Thé record of over 1,047 pounds of butter in one year from the Jereey cow ' "SignaVa Lily Flag," ia not the largest, «or %3 she the champion,' as the bööt records belong to the Holstem- Friesians. T^ Holsteins have exceeded the Jerseys in the best yearly butter records, and have * Surpassed all other breeds in the prodnc tàonVof milk, winning the prises st the New York Dairy Show atMadisbn-squsre fardes, in t°8M made before the public tar the largest production of milk and , butter competing with Jerseys and G-nern eeye. - The Holstein cow Pieterje Second in a test produced in one day over 112 ponudsof milk. As two pounds of milk eré íabout »one quart, her yield was close Upon $6 quarts of milk in one day (truly au enormous quantity) and her yield fer 31 days was 3,289 pounds, and for one year it was 30,3181>J>onnds, the average being 83|^pounda. This enormonB yield is bquiviptant te over 15,000 quarts in one year,y¿r over 41 quarts for every day in the year. *Eps cow^ DeKel Second uot only yielded 88 popnds of milk in one Jday, but Jits richness may be shown by her butter record of 33 ponnds six ounces of butter In one week. The sd vantages of 4&rge; milk yields with corresponding totter records' cannot be overlooked by mose who value a breed for all that eau he derived from it Nor is the above Geld of milk to be considered sa the ghost possible limit, for a large number nf Holstein cows are pressing Pieterje fer first honors, and may surpass ber. From 10,000 to 20,060 pounds af milk in one yeaf is not now considered remarkable for thejbreedi while all hononr is due to the grand Jersey cow for her record of 1,047 peunds of butter in one year, her large yield ia exceeded by the Holstein cow Pauline Paul; whose record is 1,153 poands of butter iv» one year, or 106 poands more than that of Lilly Flag. Mechthilds, another Holstein row, produced 39 poands lOi oiuices of butter in one week, 1504. poupdl in 39 days, and a fraction over 292 Sianda in 60 days. The yield of milk by lothide is 26,021 pounds in one year, with a butter record ot 28 pounds 2¿ ounces in One week, js a remarkable record for both milk end butter, while Olothlde Second has a «reeord cf 30s pounds of butter in nsW >*B«I^119 pounds Uf onuses bi 30 dayl, 223 pounds Sf canoes in 60 days, Md 820 pounds If ounces in 90 days.

When , eows like De Kol Second can pro duce over 5i pounds of butter a day, and ob^s like Pieterje can yield over 112 g»naas ref milk in one day, it carries the oistein to the front as the best milk and , butterproducing breed known, and farmers . value die milking qualities as highly as ,the; butter producing capacity.-New York/ottmoZo/Commerce. 1 "fjRub your eyes and read this again, 1 Australian farmers.
