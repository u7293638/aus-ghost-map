CHAPTER XXV, "Miss Elise Reynolds as nothing to us,"' said Colonel Thome, faang his- daugnter angrily. "You can't take tne whole world under vour wing. Firstly you befriend, a deserter and now you waist to befriend.ihis. sister. Both are perfect strangers to the) familv." "1'U go and see km: she -is bearing; up., TF J-QU like, and say good-bye. -to her ami assure her of our sympathy," suggested Mrs. " Ponsouby. " "I'll go with vou," put in- Hume: "Oh, no, thank, you-" was the decisive reply. His aunt remembered that -fif.ise. was pretty. She rose at once, and walked towards, the door. Time was short, and it was mjcegsary'ta nip Viola's powers cf. oppositkai in the bud. '" I •Please' do not think, aunt," site?. tne latter, '"that aiythdng ivill .induce rae to leave England to-day, because nothing will. I have made up my mind to remain. Perhaps—win-o knows?—my evidence may prove of use to Stewart Reynolds." '"But it won't- Can't you. see on the. face of it that" it won't?" tnundered her; father. "You shall go! You' shall'leave England to-. day. llie passage is taken, and I command! you to obey me and to go qnietiy and obediently on board the steamship-" "'Do,-dear, gay. yes,, at. once," Jiesocghc her aunt. "A scene like this is- so vfery painful "to me. And yen/know, dear, l am -'ireatened with a weak Iveart." , As every one knew in the family^; thislast remark, was 'one "wbkA. Mrs".

Viola from her purpose to-dare - : r "I ,must remain in Rngbmd," die said, with growing obstjnacj'.' . ' . . * "Then you disobey me. disregard my commands?" angrily demanded faer father, bringing down. his. fist, pn the table.' I am sorry, but—but " "T say, Sis, think it .over. Don't run your head against a. bride -wall- , - Xobodywill thank-you in the end. If you ieel that you'd like- me to' come- too Til gtv as .far as Madeira. I'm.a very onliging. brother,, nmv, 'am I .not?" This , "was said, with a faint efiort -to speak brightly. "I cannot go now. Perhaps .next week," answered Viola. "Next -week!"' echoed her aunt, "Of. course not! The passage money- can't be pa-id again next-week." "I cannot go to-day." . " '•But our remaining behind -will: attract, every one's attention, to us,"'. argued Mrs. Poasonb-y. ; .7 -- - - ""'If .you do not go with your aunt torday to South Afrifg. 1 ^hall'disoTOa and "disiij;- herit you." Colonel Thome, awke o w e calmly now. The -worst was ahout. ta. be> faced, and the knowledge of it induced. 3]im to command his temper. "Then I am disinherited and difO'wrutad. .already," answered Viola, springing, to- her feet, and faring her father squarely: Then she turned sharpy towards ithe aoo-r and left the room. "I. would make her go—if I conJd," thundered her father, savagely. Thereupon Mrs. Poneoniby began tor weep, an(J \- . Hume 1 brought — out has. pipe aojii loadestl it in haste. Viola-locked the door of her racta and threw herself into a chair. -.She wanted time to think ever her next course b£. action. Twenty pounds, was all she jxussetsxi, aid, she was well asvare that twenty pounds goes a very libtfe "way when it has to cover every expense. But to. this •nwtihpr «he only allowed a passing thought. How oooild she help Steiwurt, the man she loved? , mas the estion -w-hich now occupied her mind, e was willing to isuffef anythiag or to do anything for his sake. - "How could they imagine thlafe I should leave him?" she cried, tears <of indignation dtan-din" in her -eySes. "But - th^r <hjDL't underatena." She was quite rigdit, tfaej: did mot "understand," for" Mrs. Ponsonhy . haxl umt en- " ;htsnedany one. regarding her ooatetnplat- . matrimonial "macoeavres, acd she herself had not "rasped the fact that-' Viola had nr.ticipatecl those maacsfsrvres; "by already falling in love with Stewwft. Ko one suspected her lore. . It was her •own joyous, hapny secret, a secret thait rendered life beautiful. Now die felt she, aoodd face the world in arms for bis. dear svk^. To be disowned and dianherited seemed.very small matter ih'her eyes. She .thought -alone of the man she loved, and. haw she'could heJp him: "T knois," she cried, springing to? her feet. "I will 550 to poor Eiise arid confort her. Poor girl! I expect she ia all alda.e. Miss Fiinthaui, and her other old friends, are sure to Stake-time to get «wer the first ehjock of the news before rallying round her "frith tany degree of waa-mth." As-jhar thoughts rushed on a£ headlong pats YsoJa hurriedly dcrnned her witdoo'r clothes. ""We can share our grief together," she added,-with a biave anile. "But he can't -be found guilty. Oh, no, it would be^too cruel to tell him he must die. Tt wB'l never, never end Sn" that!"- Before any. member of her" feinil; r suspected. her intentions she was "walkjni; bria-^ly through the streets towards the Castle-road. There was no that- something of a most dtlirriug nature had occurred, for at every point groups, of excited talkere clustered round their neighbour^ doors. . Gossips were having a grand time, that;-was evident; but there were manv to -ivhom the news was sofamnly painfuL The son of a necentlj' lost friena, who had been to tliem the krodeS; of sjTni>athis«rs manv hours of triaJ^ -lay rmder saisckaoo of murderl It n-as too horrible t» be possible.

AVhy, miss,/^re you not busyivith the packing-up and—-aud—- "No, .Margaret, I am notgoing to Souli- Africa. I want to 6ee Miss Elise. Can I?". "You've heard • what's happened, perh'aps?" The question was asked in a husky whisper. " Ye?: Mr. Stewart is arrested. The old servant could not trust herself to make an answering remark —. she merely Showed Viola into the drawing-room. "Miss Thorne; and she's come to cheer you, iniss," die managed to jerk -out. Another moment aiid the door Vas dosed. - The two girls were alone. "Yes, Elise, I have come' to cheer you, and to be cheered in return," murmured Viola, "for my own heart is breaking." As she said the last word die sank down by the side of Elise arid-clasped hei'hands. ; . "But why are you in great trouble, Jtoo?" "Because it was I who gave Stewart the civilian's, suit in. which he escaped. He catme to our house at Caterham and I did as he a^ked." . "Viola! you—you?" "Yes." "But youlwill not tell any -one, unless it will point to his -innocence?" "No, 1 -would rather die.than say a.word that might tell against him, because — O, Elise, wdl you promise to keep my greatest of all secrets. I feel I must tell you, because then we can ieel for each other so very, very-deeply." . •T think I guess it. Shall I tell you what I think it is?" "Yes." • ' \--- • 'TL'OU love Stewart?'^ "Yes, you are right." ; •"But you have known everything! You knew of Mr. Tomlin's imirder! Oh, was it* wise to love him, dear? Think what it' means, this arrest?" "I know what it means; it means everything to me — everything- But I know he is not guiltv. He could not kill a man in cold blood. "He is incapable of that. You know that it is the case?" " Yes, I do know- it. But the world docs not; neither will the Judge who tries hun, nor the Jurv who gave the verdict. 1 have thought of it, time after time, during the last few weeks, and I know that his chances of acquittal must be small. Don't think me selfish, dear, but I am sorry you are going away, because it is a comfort to me to hear you say that you do not, believe he did it." "Of course be did not! But I am not going away from England to-day. And, oh.Ehse, I have another great trouble. My father is angry -with me, and he has disowned and disinherited me." i "Oh, Viola! how .wicked—how cruel! Where will you go?" "I must have time to think." "Oh, couldn't you stay with me, dear, until—until everything has been decided, and—and the end of the trial is reached? I am all alone!" "Yes, I -will stay with you, Elise, and we .will think and scheme all day about ways and means for finding out who actually , did -—, tlie — , murder." .. . ^ . , , "Ah, theres nothing tfiiat we can do, and w e must be careful not to do luum to Jis But sli<i iv.:s mistalien.
