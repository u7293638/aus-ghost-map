BRITISH AND AMERICAN GOODS IN RUSSIA. An unwilling compliment lias been paid to the excellence of English and American manufactures by a correspondent writing to the Moscow Ilussiehe v aehriehtcn from the regions of the Baikal Sea. Describing the various streams of commerce which run from the coast of China toward the great Siberian mart of Kiachta, antl tlienee spread themselves over the Asiatic provinces of the Russian Empire, the cor respondent alllrins that in spite of the heavy duties levied at the Russian fron tier the manufacturers of Moscow have not the ghost of'a chance against those of Birmingham and Philadelphia. 1; In fact," lie says, " our Moscow manufacturers, by their short lengths, their grossh7 insulli eient measure, and the general wortldcss ness of their goods, have so spoiled their credit in Siberia that the term Muscovite is used as an adjective to imply what is manufactured only to ' sell,' while to de scribe an article as being English or Ame rican is considered a conclusive guarantee for its excellence. The goods sold in the Tnuisbaikal provinces of ^Russia. are cali coes, cottons, cutlery, saddlers' wares, and utensils for the camp and farm, such as, in short, are despatched to all the Bri tish colonial markets. These find their way to Kinciita, via the Manchoorian de serts, and are mainly sold to the people of Oriental Siberia by caravan merchants trading from Pckin. Sea communication with Siberia is of very recent date, but vessels can reach the provinces to which I refer by sailing round the northern coast and up the Lena River, and since your merchants are now aware that in Siberia their wares are well-known and uni versally appreciated, they should hasten to take possessioi: of the vacant market, and endeavor, by maintaining the excel lence of their manufactures, to keep it."
