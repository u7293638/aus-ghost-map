THE SILENT ONES. Their spirits pass and leave no trace behind. But sink to silence, like Uie whisp'ring wind That gently rustles thro' the leafV boughs. Then dies away in faintly-murumr'd toughs. Their vacant places soon again are filled ; j Forgotten the loved tones that once so ! thrilled , Oar' charmed ears — aud now another's voice Cm bid onr souls be sorrowful or rejoice. j Oh. it is rad. and doubly sad to think nx.liltr ure Hmn'tlui lifo-lon? link Of heart to heart ! That leveller, the tomb. Makes no distinction in its common doom. Death plucks them from us, and with scow ling brow Will no invasion of his rights allow. We leave them to the silence — ^lad to turn Where new affections and ambitions burn. And, if their wailing ghosts entreat us, spurn Their haunting' memories — put them away, As hideous blots upon the face of day, Like raven's croak, or moping owlet's scream Or horrid shrieking, heard in ghastly dream. Sweet uncomplaining Spirits ! Silent ones ! Bleep peacefully, while time's swift current runs, Making you even with men's thoughtless sons ! Anon their places miss them — and they fall Into the Silent Gulf : Oblivion's pall Covers their virtues — and their faults aa ?well. And soon not ev'n a stone their names shall tell. But yet 'tis Heaven's mercy to ne all That Silence bury sorrow with the dead. Or there would be no limit to the tear drops shed. F.M.K.
