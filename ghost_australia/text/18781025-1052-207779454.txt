. - V MACBETH.; , . Mr. Tliomas Kenny, a clever essay ist, and who has written ' inbst ably om ' the subject of " Macbeth," I'haract.r- . ' ises it as " a drama of gigantic crime I and terror relieved by. the most mag- . iiincciiL L (.Apicbbioiiy ycc ' marked with great simplicity of general I design. The date. of the production of the piece is set by Furnival at 1605-6, and " we. may take it . for gnmted," says Kenny, ."that it was written in the time of Janie.s the First, who I ascended the throne March, 1603, as it contains ah evident allusion to that '. monarch in act iv. scene I, and .also a I compliraentaiy reference to him in an other jiart. Tlic material for the play ' was found by Shakespeare in Holiii- > shed's History of Scotland, where the story of Macbeth is told at page 168." ' The iVIacbeth and Duncan arc rcpre- ) sented to h.ave been cousins; the- first a valiant gentleman but of cruel dispo- sition, and the latter " so" soft and gentle in his nature th.nt the people wished the inclination and manners of the two to have been so tempered and k interchangeably shared betwixt them that where the one had too much of >' clemency and the other of cruelty, the V main virtue bclwceu these two c.xtrc- mities might have reigned by indifi'er- > cut partitien in them both. The play . all along keeps close to the line of Holinshed, varying from it in scarcely ) ' .any particular except in the noii- appearance in the b.anquct scene of the ' murdered Banquo'.s ghost." L This tragedy has been presented in . Melbourne we believe oftener than any ' other of Shakespeare's works. The ) late G. V. Brooke,. Charles Kcan, Charles Vincent, in their time essayed ' the part, and wc have had other repre- ) sentativcs, from the burly McKean , Buchanan and. James Anderson to the ) little dapper J. B. Howe. But few \ artists have made their Melbourne . in the rSle of the Thane of Caw - ) dor. ' Of tho.sc'who liave.We now call k to mind Air. C. W.
