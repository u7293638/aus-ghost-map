SOUTH AUSTRALIAN JOCKEY CLUB MEETING. Fibst Day. |By Telegraph.] [From our ownj importer. | Melbourne, May 3. The S.A.J.C. had nothing to complain of in the matter of weather on Saturday, but the attendance at Flemington was not equal to the general expectations. When the pro ceedings began there were very few spec tators, but the appearance of the Stand improved later on, and Mr. Barnard seemed satisfied with the receipts at the gates. His Excellency the Governor and suite were present, and there were a good many leading sportsmen from New South Wales in the paddock, bat Adelaide was rather thinly represented, consider ing that it was a South Australian meet ing. The card only contained five races, but there were good fields in the handicaps, and some of the finishes were very exciting. Late scratchings reduced the field in the Hurdle Bane to five, and four of these were supported at short prices. The race was run at a slow pace for a mile, and then Echo, Old Soul, and. Sir Patrick raced together to the turn, where Echo was cannoned against, and the lad on Old Soul taking matters rather easy up the straight, Sir Patrick got away from him and just landed the race by a long neck. Silver King was established favourite for the Leger when the betting opened, but when stripped he looked tucked-up, and as The Broker was cool and hard he became nearly as rood a favourite as Silver King before the fall of the flag. Sandal was also supported, and at one time her backers were in ecstasies, as she led the two colts a merry race to the home turn. Here she collapsed altogether however, and as Silver King had taken a good deal on him self in chasing Sandal, he was net able to resist the challenge of The Broker, who got his head in front at the distance, and won a pretty race by a short neck. The winner was ridden with great judgment by Sanders. After luuch a field of twenty weighed out for the Goodwood Handicap. Most of the com petitors looked very fit when saddled up, and with Topaz out of the way the race would have been regarded as wonderfully open. There was not much change in the betting, save that St. Lawrence hardened and further investments in favour of Lantern shortened his price. They were not kept long at the poBt, and the Btart would have been a good one but for Topaz jumping round the wrong way as the flag fell. This ruined his chance completely, but the accident probably made no difference as far as the actual result of the race was concerned, because lantern Btrode away from bis opponents after going a furlong and spreadeagled them just as be did the lot opposed to him at Oakbank on Easter Mon day. Lord Wilton struggled into second place again, and of the other favourites Iron master and St. Lawrence performed fairly well, but nothing had a chance with the winner. Lantern was not a good horse for the ring, though the owners did not win a large stake, owing to his having a bad passage over from Adelaide. That very smart filly Juanna made an example of Remus and The Teacher in the Sires' Produce Stakes, but South Australians were not equal to follow ing up their successes in the Victorian Handicap, for which eighteen faced the starter. Meander end Meerschaum were favourites, and the former should have won, but he stumbled, and the accident enabled Pyrette to wind up a good day's sport with a clever win for tbe Messrs. Miller. The ring muBt have had a good day, though a few Adelaide men landed fair stakes over Lantern. The following is a description of the run ning:— FI&ST; HURDLE RACE. A handicap sweepstakes of 6 sevs. each lot starters, with ISO sovs. added. About two miles. Mr. A Ferguson's bl.g. Sir Patrick, by Croagh Patrick, 6 yrs., li st. 121b. (Feigusson).. -. Mr. M. P.

Yellow Hammer, 4 yrs., 9 st. (Harden). ... , „ . . Betting—2 to 1 agst. Old Soul, 6 to 2 asst. Echo, 3 to 1 agst. Sir Patrick, 4 to 1 agst. Gasalier, 10 to 1 agst. Yellow Hammer. __ Tbe first horse to move was Yellow Hammer, and he led Old Soul and Echo over tbe first hurdle, when Old Soul took up the running from Echo and Gasalier in the order named. At the distance Old Sonl was just clear of Ecbo and Gasalier, and the three jumped tbe hurdles in front of the Stand almost together, with Sir Patrick and Yellow Hammer lying about sin lengths behind. Bounding the river turn Old Soul ana Echo drew away three lengths from Gasalier and Sir Patrick, hut at the abbatoirs the four were close together, Old Soul still being the most prominent. The favourite kept his advantage over Echo to the hurdle near the turn, when the Ballarat horse was cannoned against, and he dropped back to Gasalier, while Sir Patrick took second place. Entering the straight Sir Patrick was in front, and alter a slashing race home he won by half a length from Old Soul, with Echo half a length behind the second horse. Gasalier waB a good fourth, and Yellow Hammer a bad last. Time, 4 min, 2} sec. ST. LEGER STAKES. A sweepstakes of 20 sovs. each, 5 ft., with 150 added. For three-year-olds. Colts, 8st 10 lb.; fillies, 8 st. 7 lb. The second horse to receive 60 sovs., and the third 25 sovs. out of the stake. One mile and three-quarters and 132 yards. Mr. J. D. Bohertson's ch.c. The Broker, by Golds borough—Melody (Sanders) Mr. W. Branch's b.c. Silver King (Moore) Mr. W. Gordon's c.f. Sandal (Geoghan) .. Betting—6 to 4 agst. Silver King, 6 to 4 agst. The Broker, 4 to 1 agst. Sandal. The three left the post in a very leisurely manner, but aftor cantering to the distance Sandal went to the front and lei The Broker six lengths past the Stand, with Silver King lying last. At the river turn Sandal had increased his lead to eight lengths, but raring along the back stretch The Broker and Silver King abreast began to draw on the ieader, and at the nridge Sandal was only two lengths clear of Silver King, while The Broker had dropped back last, and this order was preserved to the turn, where Sandal sudddenly collapsed, and Silver King entered tbe straight in front. HewaB immediately joined by The Broker, however, and the latter quickly headed him, but Silver King came again under punishment, and after a rattling finish he was only beaten by half a neck. Sandal was a dozen lengths off. Time, 3 min. 211eec GOODWOOD HANDICAP. A sweepstakes of 10 sots. each. h. ft., if declared, with 260 sots, added. For'three-year-olds and up wards.

Pailleroo, 4 yrs., 7 st. 4 lb. (Olds). Mr. J. A. Lang's ch.h. Carbuncle, 4 yrs., 7 st. 3 lb. (Farrell). Mr. J. Whittingham's ch.h. Ironmaster, 6 yrs., 7 st. (Traban). Mr. S. G. Cook's br.f.

Williams). _ Betting—100 to 30 agst. Topaz, 7 to 1 St. Law rence, 8 to 1 Loid Wilton, 10 to 1 Lantern, 13 to 1 each Middleman^), St John, Dnenna, and Uncas, 15 to 1 each Pailleroo, Ironmaster, and The Ghost, 20 to 1 each Bingwood, Hazard, and Marie Louise. There were one or two partial breakaways, and then the flag fell to a good start, but unfortunately for the backers of Topaz he whipped round the wrong way and lost all chance. The first to jump off were St. John and Pailleroo, with Lord Wilton, Umberto, and Lantern next. These five were at the head of affairs for the first furlong, the field being in good order, with the exception of Topaz, who was 150 yards behind everything. After going a furlong Lantern went up to the leaders, and after lying beside St. John to the abattoirs he strode to the front, followed by Umberto, Lord Wilton, Duenna, and Pailleroo, the rest being well packed, with the exception of Topaz whipping in. Passing the sheds Lantern held a commanding lead from Pailleroo, TJmberto, and Lord Wilton, who were together, and as they raced along the bend the big river horse was holding bis own comfortably from Uncas, Pailleroo, Lord Wilton, and Ironmaster, while the colours of St. Lawrence and The Ghost showed prominently at the head of the main body of the field, and Topaz also made a faint run. Lantern continued to stride along in front as they rounded the turn, and here Pail leroo, l.ord Wilton, Ironmaster, St. Lawrence, and The Ghost were at the head of the second lot. But though Lord Wilton and The Ghost drew out from the rest of the field in the straight, neither could reach Lantern, who won with ridiculous ease by three lengths. Lord Wilton beat The Ghost by a neck for second place, and then came Ironmaster close up fourth, with St. Lawrence, Pailleroo, Middlemaroh, Uncas, and Duenna in the order named, the last to pass the post being Kingship. Time, 1 rain. 44 sec. SIRES' PRODUCE STAKES. Of 10 sovs. each, h.ft., with 100 sovs added, and 60 sovs. subscribed by owners of sires.

Meerschaum and Meander, 10 to 1 each Pyrette, Surprise, Ace, and Salvo, 12 to 1 each Manfred, Honora, and Miss Metlin, IE to 1 Stafford. They were at once dispatched to a splendid start, but Pyrette was very quick on ber legs, and at once took a clear lead from Miss Merlin, Surprise, and Honora, with Meander, Derision, and Agnes well up.' They crossed the tan in much the Bame order, but Meander loBt ground through stumbling, and entering the course proper Pyrette was still in command from Honora and Miss Merlin, with Meander coming fast on the inside. From the dis tance to home Meander made up his ground in fine style, but Pyrette was inBt equal to stalling off his challenger, a slashing finish between the pair ending in favour of the mare by a neck. Honora was a length from the second norse, with Miss Merlin a good fourth, the main body being headed by Agnes and Stafford. Time, 43} sec. Melbourne, May 6,9.30 p.m. The second day of the Meeting, which has been postponed till to-day (Saturday), promises to be very successful, and there is a great deal of interest being centred in the Adelaide Cup. For this race there may be twelve or fifteen runners, and five or six horses have |been backed for very heavy stakeB, Conjecture was established first favourite to-day, and this mare has been supported for thousands. On no performance this season can she be pronounced dangerous, but there seems a general feeling that she will appear in her true colours to-morrow for the first time since she ran second to Malua for the last Adelaide Cup. The mystery which has Burrounded Lantern since he won the Goodwood Handicap was cleared away to-day, when the Leviathan backed the horse for the Messrs. Crozier to win something like £10,000. It seems that the gallop with Sardius was not a true index to Lantern's form, and his party think they have a real good thing. Sardius has been driven to 10 to 1 in consequence of the advance of Lantern, but he will nevertheless run well, as Tothill has been in great heart. Britisher is firm at 4 to 1, and there is no abatement in confidence of his backers. Prometheus arrived at Flemington this morning looking well, and both Lord Wilton and Madcap have been befriended for good stakes in the right quarters. Camerine is the only other backed for money, all sorts of prices from 100 to 3 to 100 to 1 being offered, bar the eight mentioned. Conjecture's public form is not good enough to make me think she can win, ana I expect to see the finish fought out by Lantern, Sardius, Lord Wilton, and Britisher. Of this quartette I prefer the chance of Lantern, whose runaway victory in the Goodwood Handicap stamps him one of the most brilliant horses seen in public this season. The betting to-night is—100 to 30 agst. Conjecture, 100 to 25 agst. Britisher, 100 to 25 agst. Lantern, 100 to 10 agst. Lord Wilton, 100 to 10 agBt. Sardius. 100 to 8 agst. Madcap, 100 to 8 agst. Prometheus, 100 to 5 agBt, Camerine. Moore rideB Conjecture; Robertson, Bri tisher ; Nicholson, Lantern; Sanders, Lord Wilton ; O'Brien, Madcap; Trahan, Prome theus ; Wyman or McGrade, Sardius; and Hales{ Camerine. For the minor events my selections are:—Maiden Plate—Hampstead. Nursery Handicap—Joanna, Honeycomb, and Absenal. Selling Hurdles — Don ALONzoor Chatsworth.
