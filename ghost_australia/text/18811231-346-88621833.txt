THE HAUNTED CHAMBER. A room in the priucipal inn of a country .town had the reputation of being haunted.. ( Nobody would sleap in it, and it was there fore shut upj but it so happened that at an flection the1.inn was choke full, and there .Was only the haunted room unoccupied. A gentleman's gamekeeper came to the inn, exceedingly fatigued by a long journey, and wanted a bed. He was informed that unless he chose to occupy the lwuntt-d room ho must seek a bed elsewhere. "Haunted!" exclaimed he; " stuff and nonsense ! I'll sleep in it, ghost of demon have ft look at what haunts it. Accordingly, after fortifying himself with a pipe and tankard, ho took up hiB quarters in the haunted chamber, and retired to rest. He had not lain down many minutes when the bed shook under him most fearfully. He sprang out of bed, struck a light (for he had taken the precaution to place a box of lucifer matches by his bedside), and made a careful examination of the room, but could discover nothing. The courageous fellow would not return to bed, but remained watching for some time. Presently he saw the bed shake violently; the floor was firm; nothing moved but the bed. Determined, if possible, to find out the cause of this bed quake, he looked in the bed, under the bed, and near the bed, and not seeing anything to account for the shaking, which every now and then seemed to seize on the bed, he at last pulled it from the wall. Then the " murder camc out." The signboard of the inn was fastened to the outorwall by a nut and screw, which came through to the back of the bed,aud when the wind swung the sign board to-and-fro the movement was com municated to the bed, causing it to shake in a most -violent manner. The gamekeeper, delighted at having hunted up the ghost, informed the landlord the next morning of the real nature of his unearthly visitor and was handsomely rewarded for rendering a room, hitherto useless, now quito Borvice ablo.
