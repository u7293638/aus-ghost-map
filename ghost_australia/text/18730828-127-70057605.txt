SELECT POETRY. FIRELIGHT VISIONS. Flicker, oh, Firelight, Friend to the friendless, Joy to the joyless, Flicker, oh, Firelight ! Fling thy wild shadows all over the walls, My onl, companions in desolate halls; F' 4 wierd spirits, till all roundmy head S/ over and flutter like ghosts of the dead. etere I see dancing, bright fairy-like feet, To the tune of, remembrance, they spectre-like beat; Here I see, quaffing the wine of the south, My frie}ds--oh, God! were they the friends of sny youth ? Dart my thoughts backward through many a year, Where gladness was once, there is sorrowing here; Mourning for ever the hopes that are dead, And have left but despairing to reign in their stead. Nobles had blended their name with my name, Heroes have blazoned my shield with their fame; Careless, I yielded my youth to disgrace, And endeth with me the renown of -my race, Years that are wasted, how vainly I mourn, While drifting away to the mystical bourne; Mtill in my anguish one solace I claim, Thou friend to the friendless, oh flickering flame ! I Shining alone, with a magical light, like a luminous star in the 4airkness of night, ; ms the remembrance through anguish and strife r Of ,e angel being who brightened my life. Comforh e, darling, and lay thy hand here; ne .on my weary head, come, oh, come near .. 3 Speak to me,darling, in tenderest tqno, And I shall nuonger be wretched and lone, Strange-thou artering thy bridal attire Ah, gono!-'tis a vjon-oh, treacherous fire! Drown in thy flashesthe shadows they cast, I cannot --I willnot-~ar thoughts of the past. Broken vows haunt meo, ah1 broken hearts too, Pallid lips murmur of wordsoft untrue; Cruelly taunting my heart flu of blame, How hatefully bright seem thyhiashes of flame ! Fled, like that phantom, the droe of my youth, Gone is myI happiness, gone is my tath; Lingering lonely, the last of my line,. Oh, deith, wilt thou give sme that :est vwhich is thine 2
