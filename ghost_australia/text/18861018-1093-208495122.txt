THE CAULFIELD MEETING. CUP DAY. [By Telegraph.] [From our Special Reporter,] Melbourne, October 16. * I Cup day this season at Caulfield ha3 turned out a most brilliant success, the attendance beiDg the largest ever known, and the paddocks just as much crowded as on Cup Day at riemington. Being a smaller place, however, the crowd may be roughly calculated at 40,000. The Governor and Lady Loch were present, and there were many stylish equipages in the carriage paddock, showing that while the place is very popular with the masses it is also grow ing in favor with the wealthier classes. The im provements made last season at the cost of nearly £5,000 were much appreciated, but better press accommodation is still needed, especially for telegraphing. The secretary, however, promises greater facilities next year. The weather proved beautifully fine after the rain, a fresh breeze blowing in the middle of the afternoon, and keeping up well till the crowd got home, when light showers fell. The racing was very interesting, especially the two principal events, and there was great cheering when the Adelaide horse, Isonomy, put down the great crack Malua. It was generally sup posed the latter would not start in the Caul field Stakes, but either Mr. Inglis is desirous of picking up the crumbs as well as the big prizes of these meetings, or he wished to show the public how he could ride, as he went out 4 lb, overweight, and lost the race, whereas many are of opinion that had he engaged a professional, and sent him out with just the weight up, Malua would have beaten Isonomy, the only one he [had to fear. IsoDomy was cleverly ridden by Quinn, who did not bore Malua, but pinned him in next the rails in such a way that the rider's boots touched occasionally, and Inglis had cer tainly the worat of the positions, while Quinn with his right arm free was_ swishing his whip down by Isonomy's ribs, but it was only a pretence of flogging. He could have got a lot more out of his horse, if necessary, but it was not required, as he won comfortably by half a length, Sheet Anchor, who looked very well, was beaten badly, as was Grace Darling, who seemed jaded after the race. The Nun ran well, and might have been closer up at the finish. Malua wis considered such a certainty that backers had to plank 0 to 4 on him, and from 5 to 20 to 1 could have been obtained about the others. Mr. Blackler, Mr. Locke, and John Hill were all congratulated, and though very few backed him the Adelaide division were very pleased with Isonomy's success, and he will see a much shorter price for the Melbourne Cup. He is getting into grand fettle, and was not a bit distressed by his run with Malua. For the great event of the day—the Cup—the first knock that backers sustained was the scratch ing of Little John at 10.52 on Saturday morn ing. The mystery surrounding this horse has not yet been cleared up, as some say he wa3 bought by the bookmakers to be reserved for the Melbourne Cup, while others state he was scratched because his owner could not prevail • upon Cracknell to ride him for the Caulfield. I fancy there is some foundation for the first rumor, and that Little John will be a danger ous customer for the big event at Fleming ton. In the paddock Silvermine maintained his pre eminence in the betting, the public having great confidence in his powers _ to achieve a victory, being evidently of opinion they would get a straight run for their money, which they did. Britisher, however, had so many supporters amongst the Ballarat division that he went out nearly <13 good a favorite as Silvermine, 4 to 1 about each being quoted. Boolka having beaten William Tell in a trial was regarded as a moral by his party, and in the rooms the night previous Branch was taking all the money he could get about him, showing that a big commission was going on for the stable, lie call had also good honest support, and was backed for a heap of money, while Ben Bolt had the con fidence of the Caulfieldites, who knew some thing about his private work, but 7 and 8 to 1 were obtainable about either of these. At the Victor.an Club on Friday £2,000 to £SQ0 was offered against Ben Bolt getting a place, but the offer met with no response, It appears the stable got their money on some time ago, and have since been finessing with the horse, whom they did not wish to make a favorite. They worked very cleverly, and have won £50,000 or £60,000 amongst them. Lesbia and St. John came into request at the end, and 6very horse in the race was backed at some price or other. Maroney being scratched, there were 18 horses facing the starter, but some delay was caused through the fractiousness of Millstream and The Levite. Eventually they got away on pretty equal terms, The Levite, Zeno, Islander, and St. John forming the leading division. At the turn Jim Cain fell, and was out of it, his rider escaping unhurt. First Consul, Millstream, Ben Bolt, and Tarpeia formed the next division, but approaching the back _ of the course the changes Bhowed Mentmore in front, then Bonnie Doon, Boolka, The Levite, Britisher, First Consul, St. John, Silvermine, Recall, Ben Bolt, Lesbia, Remus, Tarpeia, these being about 20 lengths between the first and last horses. Hearing the home turn St. John and Britisher were in front, with Silvermine coming up strongly, Ben Bolt running on the outside, and Bonnie Doon, Recall, Lesbia, and Boolka well up. Into the straight Britisher held command, and there were cries of " Britisher wins" till Silvermine came up and challenged him, when there were counter cheers for the favorite, who got his nose in front of Britisher and improved his position a bit. As they came down _ past the stand Robeitson was watching Britisher over his left shoulder, when suddenly with a terrific run O'Brien brought up Ben Bolt on the outside, and in a few strides it was evidently all over, the cry going up " Ben Bolt has won," thus cleverly appropriating the big event by a neck. Robertson was to some extent caught napping, but Silvermine was going at his best, and was in difficulties, while Ben Bolt was as fresh as a daisy, and pulled up quite strong and gay. Britisher cowered a bit when he was finishing with Silvermine, arid might have made a gamer fight. Silvermine was only half a length in front of Britisher, while Recall was a close fourth, Lesbia fifth, St. John sixth, Remus seventh, The Levite eighth, and Tarpeia offi ciated as whipper in. The time—2 min. 42 sec.— has beep beaten by Blink Bonny and Grace Darling, the latter doing the distance in 2 min. 40 sec. Ben Bolt's victory must dispose of Silvermine's chance in the Melbourne Cup, as Ben, with a 10-lb. penalty, meets Silvermine at the same weight—7 st, 10 lb.—and Ben certainly looks the better stayer of the two. He has been backed to win the double by his stable. Ben Bolt is a stout-looking bay, by Newbolt out of Lady Baldwin, and had a vic torious career in Queensland as a two and three year-old. At four years he ran unplaced Beveral times at Randwick, but was third in the Squatters' Handicap, one and a quarter miles, 7 at. 2 lb., won by Oatcake, 0 st. 10 lb.; was third in the Summer Cup, one and a half miles, 6 st. 8 lb., won by Temple, 6 st. 10 lb.; Becond in the Sydney Tattersall's Cup, 2 miles, 6 st. 6 lb., won by Temple, 6 st. 10 lb.; and won the Carrington Stakes, one mile three furlongs, 6 st. 11 lb., in 2 min. 26 sec., with Temple and Burrilda in places. Considerable interest attached to the Nursery Handicap, for two-year-olds, for which Hortense was made favorite at 3 to 1. She performed well, and was only beaten by a short neck, Lady Lovell, the winner, carrying 10 lbs. less. If she had not incurred her penalty in the Foal Stakes last week Hortense could have appropriated the Maribyrnong Plate, as she is the best looking: filly to be seen here. In the Selling Race Toronto beat Honora, Tichborne, and a good field. The Steeplechase was won by Contingent, with Irishman and Havelock in the places. Victor and Sir Samuel fell, and ;, one rider was thrown a terrific purler through the air, but was not much hurt. Lady Carrington went well, and was leading up to the last fence, which she struck heavily, and.shifted her rider, thereby losing her chance. "The winner, a racy looking customer, was lucky to get in at 9 st. 12 lb., as on a previous occasion she ran Becond to Game, and won very comfortably this time. Twenty runners went out for the Windsor Handicap, which was won easily by Don Giovanni, who beat William Tell, Toronto, and others in 1 min, 17 sec. The following are the results of the racing:— SELLING RACE. Of 100 sovs. The winner to be sold for £150. Special weights—2 yrs. 8at., 3 yrs, 9 st. 7 lb., 4 yrs. and upwards 10 at. 7 lb.

Isonomy led away, with Malua and Highland Chief in company, then Retort and others. At the mile-poBt Malua was leading, with Retort, Sheet Anchor, The Nun, and Isonomy as named, and Opal in. the rear. At the back Malua was still leading, and was joined by Highland Chief, The Nun, Isonomy, and Sheet Anchor being the next division. The pace was increased, and Malua eased back a trifle, but still maintained the inside running and was again in the lead at the home turn. Here Isonomy took second place next the favorite, and Grace Darling made her run into third position, but died away again, and The Nun, full of running, took her place. The race, however, had now become a match between Malua and Isonomy, and Quinn making good use of his horse kept command of the Cup winner, and landed Isonomy a victor by half a length amidst immense cheering. The Nun being third three lengths away, and then came Sheet Anchor, Grace Darling, Highland Chief, Young Horatio, Opal, and Retort. Time, 2 min. If sec. NUBSERT HANDICAP.

Firebrace then took command, with Julian Gray, Hortense, Bedouin, and St. Michael in close company, and at the turn for home Firebrace held a two lengths clear lead. At the distance Robertson closed the gap, and brought Lady Lovell up on the out side, while Hortense, next the rails, passed Firebrace, and a good set-to ensued home, Lady Lovell just beating the Adelaide filly by a neck, while Bedouin secured third position, two lengths behind. Then came Firebrace and Julian Gray. Time, 57 sec. THE CAULFIELD CUP. A handicap of 1,500 sovs.; 1,000 of the said sum to go to the first horse, 300 sovs. to the second, and 200 sovs. to the third.

Mr. Watson had some trouble with the field beforehe couldget them away, owing principally to the fractiousnesB of Millstream and the desire of the Levite and Tarpeia to be in front. When the sigDal same at length the flag fell to a fair start, and the 18 runners Bailed away with The Levite, Zeno, Islander, St, John, Britisher, and Boolka the mo3t prominent in the van. At the short turn past the stand Jim Cain fell, but his rider got off unhurt. St. John now assumed the leader ship, with Boolka on his quarters, then Zeno, Levite, Mentmore, Lesbia, and Silver mine in a bunch, with breaks here and there, in which the others could be seen changing places. Up the hill no change of consequence occurred, but at the mile-post the order was Mentmore, Bonnie Doon, Boolka, The Levite, Britisher, First Consul, St. John, Silvermine, Recall, Ben Bolt, Lesbia, Remus, Burrilda, Millstream, Tarpeia, and Islander. At the back turn Bonnie Doon was leading, with Boolka two lengths in front of Britisher, then The Levite, Mentmore, St. John, Remus, Silvermine, Lesbia, First Con sul, Ben Bolt, Zeno, and others. Ap proaching the home turn the rear division tailed off, while the favorites made play to get into good positions, and Ben Bolt's rider, fear ing the chances of another capsize, ran on the outer circle pretty clear of everything else. All the riders were pretty cautious passing the spot where the accident occurred last year, and waited till they had actually got well round the bend for home before they put on the steam for the final struggle home. Britisher was the first to appear in the straight in a good position near the rails, Bonnie Doon, The Levite, Silvermine, and Boolka being his nearest attendants, and Ben Bolt going strongly with them on the outside. Nearing the stand Silvermine gained the lead, and there were great shouts of "the favorite wins." Britisher quailed a bit when he found himself headed, and Robertson felt confident he had the victory in hand, but O'Brien now brought up Ben Bolt on his right hand, and coming with a wet sail in the front of the stand beat the favorite cleverly by a neck, Britisher being a neek behind Silvermine, with Recall well up, fourth, and then came Boolka, Lesbia, St. John, Bemns, The Levite, and others, Islander and Tarpeia.beinglast, Time, 2 min. 42 seh.

Shortly afterwards Sir Samuel came to grief, and Blackthorn fell back beaten, while Contingent and The Irish man came up, and made play with Lady Carrington, who was leading along the back the second time round. She was still in the lead at the last jump, which she struck heavily with her stifles, shifting Kane from the saddle, and losing her chance of coming into the straight. Contingent had a good lead from Irishman, Havelock forging up into third position. In this order they finished, Con tingent leading the second horse by eight lengths easily, and then came Blackthorn, Moonlight, TeraBg, and Brown Eagle, Lady Ashton walking in last.
