TE.UE ECONOMY. TO THE EDITOR, Sirâ€”1. Abolish the volunteers; 2. Sell the Protector; 3. Sell Marble Hill; 4. Bring in a Bill to reduce the in-coming Governor's salary to one-half (the Governor cf Western Australia has more to do than our Governor); 5\. Reduce Ministers' salaries one-half also; 6\. Abolish heads of departments, and let the numercus deputies, acting heads, Secretaries, or chief clerks do the work (they would do it as effectually, if not better); 7\. Abolish " Hansard," and curtail members' speeches to ten minutes at most (the work of the session would not last over two or three months then). The revenue sonn will not pay the interest on our national debt. I am, Sir, &c.;, JOSEPH HUME'S GHOST,
