ROMAN CATHOLIC CATHEDRAL. At the opening of ehe Roman Catholic Cathedral in October last it was announced that the members of thc Hibernian Society had resolved to present the west window. The commission for thc window was placed in the hands of Messrs. John Haidmann, and Son, Manchester, and Messrs. Hard niann and Son's design has now been re- ceived end accepted. The subject is the miracle of thc loaves and fishes as described in the Gospel of St. Mark. In the centre I panel Christ is seen blessing the loaves and fishes ; in the panels on the right St Philip and St. Peter are distributing to the mu - titudes, and on the left St. Andrew and St. Jumes arc engaged in thc same duty. Surmounting thc whole is a design emble- matical of the Holy Ghost. The design has been very carefully worked out, and the window, which is to cost Â£500 complete, will be a great ornament to the Cathedral.
