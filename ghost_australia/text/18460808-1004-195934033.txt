RGUGIOUS MOVEMENT IN GERMANY. Respecting the - great religious movement in Germany, we m«y notice : that at the; tfts'rd sitting of th* <5ett»*ral Assembly of Leipsic, Vorstand, or representatives, were appointed to pronounce upon the-merits <of the bbok of religious itoeditation and edification -^reed ti^dn at tbe second meeting. It"was determined that 'the next council should assemble fn Berlin at the expiration ^ two years, unless unftirseen 'events or tbe ^sajonty of the commonities sfctotdd demand att earlier "cdnvobition; that 'the Tifcrjgjrrnah's gown fdie recerehdt) hitherto in uce, be still worn as tbe dress of the clergy, but that the employment <of «tbe Latin tongue in the service tbe churdt%KobM abfiohftely "cease.

It was eeBsidered rtbMt to prescribe a fixed posture and dspOiltbfffet fat the ccnigfegition. The position and geaerai bearing of the worshippers—-the external es^tWsion of inward religious ideas and feelings- were left free to any point that sesured the ibtoji against the encroaehriaents of superstitiaik All claims to particular seats in the bouse ef Oai were for the time to come annulled. No cepacia! swvice of the church could be vouchsafed as Ik privilege or reward: do individual advantages in the mercy and love of tbe Universal Father pre- Sumptuously granted, or rttore irapieusly soU. Aceident had prevented both Rouge aad Czerski from being present at ell tbe meetioga of the Leipsic assembly; the latter, however^ ar» rived in time to give the sanction of his authority to the proceedings of the fourth sitting, and Ronge himself addressed the assembly on the occasion bf its fifth and Lst deliberation. Although absent, the two chiefs declared IhemsehrtM bctit* fied with all that had been accomplished, and signed all the resolutions at the close of the congrefcs. The Confession of Faith was disemmd in Ate afternoon of the 25th of March, and the debate upon thia all-hnportant point w^s earnest end protracted. It was concluded by the edeptlen of the following resolutions :— 1 First.—That the holy Scriptures i^btfe fctd entirely constitute the foundation of the Chnstiau,' fafth; the comprehension and interpretation of such Scriptures being. freely delivered •over to reason, penetrated end moved bf Christian ptineipK " Secondly—Ai a symbol pf our faith, we adopt the following declaration —* I believe in God the Father, who by His almighty word, cr«at«d the world, and governs it ih wisdom, justice, love. I bdie^in Jesus Christ, tbe Son of-God. our Saviour : I believe In the Holy Ghost, a hofy nniversal ehuYCh 0f Christ, the iorgireajMS of sius, and the life everlasting. Amen.' " We renounce the supremacy of the Pope,'declare ourse'Irtfe free from the hierarchy, end *sibae beforehand all concessions which the hierarchy may hereafter make to bYftrg the liberatsd church Once more tinder its yo'ke. *' Auricular confession is also fcjseted; eslibatty, the intercession pf saints, the adoration of relies and images. Wfeilst, however, aut-lcular confession is abolished, any individual member ef .a congregation may, if he be eo 4nclined, «ommunicata with 'the priest befon p^tt^ieg Pf the =sacrament \ none shall be. constrained to do so. Indulgences are renounte'd, ^and With, them pe- «c ribed fasts, pilgrimages, and^U-sueh institaztiopis of the church as conduce to an unmeaning sactifieation of Works. 'But perfect liberty of coussience fs allowed, free searclvng into an interpretation of holy writ, with noshaeklesofexteraal tyranny or bias. Two aacraments xMily aJte-«ektiowledged—these of Baptism alid the "Lord's Supper, whilst every individual community insulated flock Is not so restricted that it may not retain : Christian ^sages. Baptism • is to-be administered to children, and the'remising sacrament to tbe congregation ia Itfth eltfekitirte. The titter is to bs received in rtvierabtrancs f our Lord and S&eiour;, and the doctrine of (ran* substantiation is wholly:given up. Mafrisge^is regarded as'a holy institutioa, and the : blessing'of -the church as ttecessary to it. 'No prohibitory conditions or restriotions are acksowleged on this head, save those established by law. Tbe ^vst duty of the Christian is believed'and confessed to be that of fnvinrj faith ty works ef ChriitUu love." The conieeration of the priests or maM&ters; of the church was a subject of deep eewsMcMrtlon -at the last meeting held on the 9Stb, Ro^ige being present. Ronge himself insisted, that as 4he Reformation proceeded -on the ^principle, 4hat ^ia congregation dwelt the pewfer end •igftifictney «f the church, it rettaius with tfa^ cCugregation to invest ttieir minlster with authority ; -and by the laying on of hands, as tanght in tn*e. ^Che resolution r paused W^as in > this view.
