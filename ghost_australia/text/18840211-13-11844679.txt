By why incredulous' Is there anything in such an announcement inconsistent with what has already been conveyed to us through other channels of knowledge t Has there not always been progress in nature' Does not the retrospective view of creation through preceding ages of existence disclose very remarkable charges in the economy of the earth and all of them of a progressive, character And has there not besides ever been in the human heart an instinctive yearning after a higher and a purer state, When then we c Jinbuie the knowledge thus gained by observation upon things without with those irrepressible aspirations after Future exa Dence, which are powerfully felt in the soul within, have we not strong indications that a new phase of existence is in sion which this world shall have come to an end' We turn then now to see what are the repre sentations of Scripture on these matters Re valuation assures us that the present scene of things will have completely to chance that the heavens which now are shall be dissolved and that the elements shall melt with fervent heat All of them shall wax old like a garment its o worn out viBture shall they be changed and a new heaven and a new earth shall appear in then place But such mighty revolutions as these do not take place within historic times they are the out come of revolving cons of time-those vast periods which cannot be reckoned by years nor yet by centuries, but which contain within their respective limits the grand but. assist developments of the Umightya counsels I have died these v oat [ erin Is of time ions it is the original word in Scripture and there is no term in English which is atoll fitted to express the idea intended to be tone eyed the best substitutes which should translators em] by 1 such as the will of the age fall very far short of then quisite menning Norm tins nspttthnva the rt v ming translators improved upon timely.
