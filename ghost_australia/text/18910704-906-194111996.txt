Skating Carnival. Another of Mr. Raster's pleasant carnivals was held in the Odd Fellows' Hall, Katoomba, last Tuesday evening. The night was fine and a goodly number attended. The Katoomba Brass Band being specially engaged, played several lively pieces outside previous to the commencing of the Carnival, and when inside they supplied really good music to the skaters. A number of spectators were also present and stayed until a late hour, which proves that they enjoyed themselves. The hall was taste- fully decorated with bunting. In fancy dress there was Twilight, Katoomba Falls, French Peasant, and the Bell Girl, but many of the ladies were in plain dress. Amongst the gents was a really pretty dress, that of Mr. G. Cupples, French Cavillier, The young gentleman must have taken considerable care and have gone to a little expense in getting up the dress, which suited him admirably, and all applauded when it was announced that the judges had named him as the best dressed gentleman in the room.
