If so, it was evident they were not pleased. Vellikett could scarcely have been at home for more than a day or two when he despatched a rider post haste with a hurriedly written note urgently requesting me to come with all convenient speed to Arbarilla. I could not but obey such a summons, and getting the best horse I could find, I made as short a time as possible of the journey, arriving at Arbarilla early in the afternoon on the third day after the receipt the message. To my great relief, the first person to greet me was Bell Flamden, for I had feared some evil had befallen her. She had no idea for what reason Vellikett had sent for me, and in fact had not been aware that he had sent for me at all. He and Phoebe had ridden to an out-station to visit a man of theirs who was sick, and Bell did not expect their return until the evening. After I had been there a fair time, she proposed that we should take fishing lines and go down to the creek to fish, for she said she wished to talk to me and could not do so in the house without the risk of being overheard, and she had to keep up the character of a deaf and dumb girl. I readily complied with her request, and we we sat angling for some time with indifferent success. Suddenly she ceased chattering, and I could extract only monosyllables from her in reply to my remarks. " I suppose," I said at length, " the habit playing dumb girl has become fixed with you, Bell ?" " It has to a great extent, without doubt," she replied, " but it is not for that reason that I have been silent for some time. The fact is, there is something which I particularly wish to say to you, and I am at a loss how to do it. But I must do it. I feel sure, Mr Semper, you will not be very angry with me when I have explained all. I must tell you that I deceived you - that in fact, I have been playing the part of an imposter. I was taken aback, I must say and waited, wondering what was to come. i-p7- ~'jzAzr^r -r-_z,- -r_ " Oi : t~ : :rr.nr5.^rrstid r.t.' she rs tcrasi 'zz^cij. •■I ~ard ;assi' ii iii ^-jrj^nA &Ki;~i it ^iie scn.6: vkj- ;L>i-r zyzz^'A-^i Z-^'j-~ - Sis T"ui -z'-^rzsy-i'- i.y ems frxr: ~hbc. rgzvzziaS. asC t^e ir. ses^i -C Hi. 6 luii. j /iir r."xr-7"''~ si. tl.-& i=—'- di^-d/. s^.iLesud:«^vd f -'"T-r baij;. is c«»s£i.*' -'Ti-r' d T"=£7" i-'j'-'i X J id. i—- ~">bxzzrez. : •■- -: -•^ lit; Sillr- - TFIZw 11-t' ■" I did i-jc a^«: 7 j: i.- - \--;: ^ -cddsrsix/d ia: xis& 25T-S I 5ri=iiii t". 5i4r .li I>-:£ t*f Jj'.

Tony listened to me throughout with wrapt attention. He made no comment in my statement but as soon as I had concluded he showed the letter to his sister and requested her to read it. " Oh, Bell, Bell," she said, when she had finished it -" I should never have suspected you of this. How could you have betrayed what you knew to be a secret ? How can I ever trust you again ?" " Phoebe, my dear, pray allow her make her explanation," said Tony. " I must state first," Bell began in faltering accents, " that after your arrival this afternoon, Mr. Semper, you spoke of Mr. Neplus, and in doing so, made use the words of horrible vindictiveness. It flashed across my mind all of a sudden, that probably his intention might be to do the poor young lady some harm, and l asked you to go to the creek to fish so that I might have the opportunity of letting you know what I had done in the hope that you would be able to afford her some protection. I had begun to attempt to make my confession when I was prevented by the return of Mr Vellikett. I shall have to go back to the time of the arrival of my brother myself at Tenebrie. Very soon afterwards, the news was received of the strange disappearance of Miss Propter. Mr. Neplus appeared to become quite deranged. He gave instant orders for his men to search the country in all directions, and went about raving like a lunatic. At length he said it was all nonsense to suppose that any horse accident could have happened to her, and there could be no doubt she had either run away with someone, or had been abducted. Semper, he observed, left the party previous to her disappearance. I remember now I have noticed some familiarity between them, and chances are he knows what has become of her. Now, you two must go to his station, tell him what you like, he knows you are a pair of imposters - say I have ill-treated you, if you please - I don't care - all I want is information about Miss Propter, and I look to you to obtain it for me. He ordered horses and went with us to within a few miles of Mangarutta, and left us with no further instruction, to proceed on foot to the station, which was easy enough as he had placed us on the road. On parting, particularly addressing himself me, he said, " if you fail, or disobey me, I swear by God, I will destroy you. You are to say that you have walked from Tenebrie. With the looks of a fiend and the wild gestures of a madman, he left us. What could we do ? You know what followed, Mr. Semper. We learned that Miss Propter had gone away with a person of the name of Bonum, and instead of going off to Launceston at once, my brother returned to Tenebrie. I had to submit to being disguised, to being clothed in male attire, to have my hair cut short and dyed, to live with strangers and persons of a class to which I had never been used - though l must say they were very kind to me - and to assume a false character altogether, simply to keep up the deception, I had been commanded to practise on pain of destruction. However, I felt these hardships the less, because I was thus , preserved from returning to the home of a man I hated and dreaded beyond all the dangerous and loathsome creatures on this earth. I had begun to hope that having accomplished the task he had set me, I was free from him, and that my brother would find the means of taking me back to our Tasmanian home, when I was alarmed one afternoon, by the appearance of a man at the saw pits, whom I knew to be in his employ. He managed to stealthily hand me a letter from Neplus, knowing me from the description of my disguise given by my brother. In this letter I was ordered to find out where Bonum had gone with a repetition of the threat of destruction. Neplus knew that I had been removed to this place, and he sent word that he was satisfied so long as I did all I could to discover what he wanted to know. I have not played the spy, I have betrayed no other secret, and what I have done has been to save myself from murder, and probable outrage too horrible for reflection." She paused from exhaustion, and possibly from the contemplation of a fate which might still await her, but Phoebe's indignation was not appeased. " False, treacherous and dangerous girl," she muttered. " Phoebe, my dear," said Tony, " you will excuse me, but the girl has given an explanation." ' Which only shows of what deception she is capable of," returned Phoebe. " I would remind you., Phoebe, my dear," Tony replied, " that no inconsiderable amount of deception has been practised by yourself, and also by my friend Mr. Semper." " But we have given reasons for that," she replied. " She has also given reasons, Phoebe, my dear, and I must say that I myself am not free of a great deception, for which I shall have to render a reason to my friend, Mr Semper. Therefore, Phoebe, as sinners ourselves we should not be too hard on a fellow sinner. It appears to me, Mr Semper, sir, that we must have been caught up in some mad system of complacency. A moment later, there was a rap at the door and a servant announced that Tom, the mailman, desired to see Mr Vellikett on business of the utmost importance. " Send him in here," said Tony. The man entered apparently in a great state of excitement. " Why Tom, my man," observed Tony. " you are a long way before your time on this occasion. You do not usually make your appearance in the morning." " No, Mr Vellikett, I generally stop the night at Rallaby, but I got a fresh horse there and came on to tell you the latest news. " Terrible news, Tom, my man ?" " Yes, it's terrible. Mr Enferne was shot last night." " Really, Tom, my man. By whom ?" " By Mr Neplus, sir. This is the way of it. Two of the men at Mr Enferne's sleep in rooms just behind his own. When they were in bed, they say there was quiet at first, but then in the middle of the night they were woken up by a man screaming for help. They jumped out of bed and ran undressed as they were to the back of the hut and looked in through a small window. There was a fight inside and they saw Mr Enferne struggling with Mr Neplus. The had hardly been there for more than a second, when Neplus whips out a revolver and shoots the other. They saw Neplus leave the hut and heard him riding away towards Tenebrie before they could get around to the front. When they went into the hut, they found Mr. Enferne had been shot through the breast and was quite dead." " Is there any doubt that Neplus was the person," I asked. " Not one out in the world, sir. The men were really sure, you see. Well then, as soon as they saw they could do the poor man no good, they roused up the other men that were sleeping in a hut a little further off, and amongst them they got hold of a horse and Ben Grubb - he neither fears the devil nor Neplus - who started right off to the police station which was about twenty miles away. When I left Tenebrie that morning, Neplus was there as far as I can say, but I expect he'll be too wide awake to admit to it. I saw the dead body of Mr Enferne myself. To all appearances, he was shot dead on the the instant. " Have the men no idea what caused Neplus to shoot that atrocious devil, Tom, my man ?" " Not the least bit, Mr Vellikett. But Enferne had not been to Neplus, nor Neplus to Enferne for a good bit before. They do say that Neplus has not been quite right head since Miss Maggie was lost. I don't know myself. I haven't seen much of him lately, but his men have seen a good reason to be afraid of him. He's a violent man when his temper's up, for all his fancy ways and sweetish talk. I wouldn't like to cross him myself at such times. I suppose now if they take him, his money won't save him from being hanged." " Not if the two men can swear positively that that it was he who fired the shot, Tom, my man." " And that they can, then, so they say. I saw some of them and they declare positive they couldn't make any mistake. There was a good light in the hut, and they could see his face plain and they heard his voice. I wouldn't wonder though that he'll get off by getting three or four to swear that he was somewhere else at the time. He's got out of some big scrapes in his time. He won't spare money, and he's got plenty that will act as tools for him. He's a man I never fancied somehow, for I've seen him so cruel before today to man and beast. There's been great talk too, about his young brother and sister. After this dreadful job, everyone will be apt to think that he murdered them." " There can be no doubt he did," said Phoebe. " Permit me then, Phoebe, my dear, if that is your opinion, to draw your attention to the danger in which another person has been standing from his truculence," said Tony with a significant shake of his head. " Yes, Tony I admit it," and on her fingers she said to Bell, " come and kiss me." The poor girl, looking like a ghost, tottered across the room and embraced her kind and repentant friend. They both burst into tears. " Ah," said Tom, " it's very trying to the nerves, such sudden things as these, gentlemen. But as I was going to say, I met a man on the road going to Tenebrie, and I told him to tell young Smith who looks after my horses there, and has brought the mail on here some times to give me a spell, to come along to Rallaby and here as soon as he could and let you know whether Neplus has been took or not. And now, as I'm pretty well fagged one way or another, I'll be off by your leave and have a lie down." Tom was a sensible fellow, and he could see he was detrop, at the ladies were growing hysterical. I don't know, though, whether it struck him as strange that the deaf and dumb girl should be so much affected. When he had left the room, Tony went to Phoebe and kissed her, and shook hands warmly with Bell. " Let us leave them alone for a while, Mr Semper, sir," whispered Tony " May I ask you," I inquired as we seated ourselves in another room, " what is the deception for which you feel that you will have to render me a reason ?" " Anon, anon, Mr. Semper, sir," he replied. " But touching Neplus, you are aware, I have always held him to be an incarnate fiend. Phoebe, poor dear, was led to say there can be no doubt he murdered his brother and sister. I have told you before, he is certainly guilty. I have deeply deplored my inability to convict him, but now it would appear that the hour of vengeance is approaching. At all events the power of doing evil will be wrested from his hands. I do not think his tools will be induced in this instance to bear false witness, Mr. Semper, sir." To Be Continued.
