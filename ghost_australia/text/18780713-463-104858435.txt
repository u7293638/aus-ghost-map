ROSE, SHAMROCK, THISTLE, AND LEEK. The Rose. — The intestine wars which so long devastated England were carried on under the symbols of the Red and White Roses. The adherents of the House of Lancaster chose the red rose as their mark of distinction, whilst those of York chose the white. This fratri- cidal war continued until the union of the roses by the marriage of Henry VII. with Princess Elizabeth, daughter of Edward IV., in 1486, since which time the rose has continued to be the emblem of England. The Shamrock. — When St. Patrick landed in Ireland to convert the Irish, in 432, tbe pagan inhabitants were ready to stone him. He requested to be heard, and endeavoured to explain God to them as the Trinity in Unity ; but they did not understand him until he plucked a trefoil, or shamrock, from the ground, and said, " Is it not as possible for the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost to be one as for these three leaves to grow upon a single stalk !" "Then," says Brand, "the Irish were convinced, and became converts to Christianity ; and in memory of that event they have ever since worn the shamrock as a badge of honor." The Thistle. — When the Danes in- vaded Scotland, on one occasion they resolved to adopt a stratagem, and in order to prevent the Scots from detect- ing them they marched barefoot. The Danes thought they should reach the camp in a few minutes, when, on a sudden, a man who went forward was wounded by a stout Scotch thistle, so that he could not help crying out loudly with pain. This noise roused the camp : the Scots flew to arms, and the Danes were vanquished. The thistle was after wards adopted as the insignia of Scot- land. The Leek. — On a certain occasion King Cadwallader met a Saxon army. In order to distinguish his men he placed a leek in each of their hats ; and having gained a decisive victory over their enemies, the leek became ever after the badge of the Welsh.
