FACILIS DESCENSUS AVERNI. Two hundred years have since gone by, but still it's not forgot, How artfully sly Titus Oates once worked a popish plot — The innocent, like sheep, to slaughter every day were led, While, to fee the canting ruffian — Oates — a prostrate nation bled. But when the mask was torn away, a fearful vengeanee fell Upon his head, who 'd work'd this direful mockery so well — Perpetual imprisonment, stripes, and pillory then came ; And Titus Oates, scorn'd, loath'd, and shunn'd, expired of grief and shame. A plot there was in New South Wales, which all has turn'd to smoke, Which might have perill'd true men's lives in working out the joke ; And the author of the pleasantry has been exposed to all — Though retribution may be slow, 't will yet upon him fall. The ghost of this conspiracy may glory to rehearse Its author's knavish plans in bungled prose and halting verse : Like the ghost of Hamlet's father, let it shun the light of day, And, with its author, swiftly speed to Hades' shades away ! w As rumour has it, that the Duke of Edinburgh is about to knight several of the leading members of society in the colonies, it is sug gested by many of the inhabitants who are roused out of their early slumbers by the dust bell, that (as we have the Earl of Belmore for Governor) the Chief Magistrate of this city, for inflicting this nuisance, should take the proud title of Sir Charles Bell Mayor Moore.
