A JOCKEY FOR DREAMLAND. TO THE EDITOR. -Yours. &c.;, BRAO'S GHOST. SIR, —Can yon inform me if the jockey, C. Gleeson, who rode Alex to victory in the Sell ing Race and the Flying Handicap at the Miners’ Races on Friday is the same jockey that rode Mr Sam. Cook’s The Sailor Prinoe when he won the Maribyrnong Plate at Flemington in 1892. If so, as it is reported to be diffionlt to obtain a trustworthy and competent horseman to steer Dreamland in tha Melbourne Cap, those in charge of that muob fanoied Ballarat horse might do worse than eecnre (Beeson's services.-
