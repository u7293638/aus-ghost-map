NOBODY'S CHILD. (From the Penny Miscellany.) Chapter XXVIII. - ? BUYING A HUSBAND. Joe, after lhat Tory important, con ' vernation with Patty which recently we have related, returned no more to her father's house. 1 1 He completely hid himself away indeed from all eyes, and 'everyone in the village of St. .Arven and its- sur- rounding neighbourhood was wondering what had become of Nobody's Child. Old Daddy Peter was in a dreadful state of mind,: fearing- thiii Joe's mys , terious disappearance meant mischief towards his master. The old miser inquired evorywhere, sought every way, but not a sight could be. obtained, not a word could hohsar of the lost Foundling. Daddy Peter was about the first to know of Captain Lazonby's return, and then a light broke in upon the old man, and off at once he stumped,, proceeding towards the castle. He had almost reached its gates when suddenly ho uttered a loud ex clamation of Mended satisfaction ; and amazement. There,' before him, leaning' 'against the castle gates, was either ' Joe or his ghost. ' It is too early an hour for ghosts to be abroad, and so it must be1 Joe him self,' thought old. Peter. boldly he advanced, and Joe, btnied seemingly in profound, thought, i stirred not in the least at his old master's; ap proach. ' Oh ! here you are ! I have been hunting everywhere for you, ever since tbat.day at the! gap.' '.,Well,' and 'now yon have found me,' carelessly responded Joe. i', ' Found you ? Yes, certainly I ... have found you — and I should like to know what yon are standing.here for, as if you were glued' to the castle gatc6 ?'' ' Go away, and don't bother me.'' ' Bother you,'1 grumbled old Peter, ' that is a pretty way, isn't it, to talk to your master ?'?' ' You are no longer master of mine.' ' In that case, recollect I owe; you nothing.' ' Very well ! only go away, leave me,' said Joe. '« Yes, I understand ; I am in the way, I have disturbed yon when yon were cogitating over. yoHr. treachery.' ' What treachery ?' ' Oh, you understand me plain enough, my fine fellow,' sneered old Peter. ' Captain Lazonby is going to be married, isn't he, ch ?'?' i * « Well ?' ' Oh, nothing ; only the captain is an artful customer, and if he is going to marry, the Tregarvons are not quite 60 poor as they were, and if they have come into money the castle will not be 6old, and if the castle should not be sold that will be all through your doings, Master Joe.' ' Why, what have I done ?',said Joe, in the most innocent manner possible. Old Peter winked and nodded at a tremendous rate, and scraped away at his battered old snuff-box. ' Oh, I know, I know — yes, yes, Master Joe, you muon't expect to have it all your own way, my lad — poor old Daddy Peter is cunning as you are, my lad — and poor old Daddy Peter has been to Simpson, one of the baronet's grooms, you know, my lad, to ask him' if he did not remember you refusing, in his presence to take that poor unfortun ate sailor to Furze Farm.' ' ' Why what do you mean' ?' cried' Joe ; 'I have already confessed that myself.'' ' *? ' ' ' Veiy good — yes, no doubt, {'but we will have his evidence for all that ?; I know tho law, my lad ; and' when ??it becomes known that you have in' your possession all that tho tailor had nbont him — the letter written by the chaplain, you know, the document proving the decease, in a legal nnd proper, /orm,, and even that little tin box— nh, my lad,' my poor lad, I am' sorry for you.' - ' ' ' Thank you,' carelessly 'said Joo ; ' but what about ?' ' ' * ' ? ' ' What about? Why, you1 'will', be- accused of having killed the' 'sailor in order to rob him, and you will'certainly ,bo hanged, my poor lad.''1 ,' ;' ''' f! Kl ' And what shall lI caro 'for.' that ?' Joe said,' with ' an air., of ? perfect ,in difference. ,, , t- ,__. o/j|/: .,;,-, u '.!) ,'' . ..., Mil .V u\ ,«A-.\' Dadily Peter fairly bounde.l with surprise. ' What do yon say — '' he stammered, ' what does it matter, if you are hanged ? Why, it matters that it will be the 'death' of, you, my lad ; you can't bo quite such -a fool as not to know that.' In'silencphe watched Joe's counten ance for , a minute or two, ; but tho examination enlightened him not in the least as to Joe's fuelings, for Nobody's Child, could, when it suited his purpose, render his features as expressionless as a blank sheet of paper. ' Come, come, Master Joo,' the old man presently said, ?? don't try to de ceive me, you can't do it— I know your real feelings.' Joe -rnised: his ,'eyos,'. fixed them for a moment on iho old' man's face, sadly, smiled,' and then again 'bent his, gaze towards the ground. ,' Look here, my lad,' pnrsned Daddy Peter ; ' if those bits of things that belonged to the sailor are found on you, it will be all over with yon, so jnst take a- friend's advice — give them to me to take care of for yon, and. then no harm can happen to you.' Joo thrust his hand beneath his vest. 'All .right,'.' thought Daddy Peter ; ' the castle will be mine after all, nnd standing in the room where I' was so shamefully treated by- the baronet, I will order him to take himself off, and to leave my property !'' He looked around him every way, made certain, no one was near, and then, extending his trembling hand, cried, eagerly and impatiently — 'Quick, my -lad, give them to me, give them to' me !'' Removing himself from the gates and standing holt upright, and closely con fronting the old miser, Joe said, with drawing empty the hand that he had placed beneath his vest — . 'Daddy Peter, yow are 1 nothing better than an idiot.' ',' An' idiot, am I? And you don't mean to give me ? ' 'Be off with you.'' ; ' . „ ' How dare yon order me about in this sort of way ?'' 'Beware, Daddy Peter, beware ; I amin no mood; to be trifled with.' And there was something in the Foundling's look and manner as he 6aid that which very greatly frightened the old miser, who toddled off as fast as he could go. When, however, he had gone about a hundred yards, he stopped for a mo ment, turned towards Joe, and shouted — ' I'll have you hanged, my fine fel low and I'll come and see you turned off-', , 1 hat said, he wheeled himself round again and continued his rapid way.-, Joe had been anxious to get rid of the old miser because he ,was there 'awaiting tho coming of Dudley Lnz onby, whom, indeed, the Foundling saw approaching him from the castle almost, before Daddy Peter was fairly out of sight and bearing. ? , ' Well, Master Joe, here you are,' said Lazonby ; «' I (have not, I hope, kept you waiting long ?' ' You have seen Lucy Tregarvon ?'' said Joe. ' Oh yes, certainly,' replied the cap tain.- , i ' Ilave told her that you are suddenly become a very wealthy man ?' ', Precisely.' '{ Have entreated her brother's con sent to, ? '' | , ' Our marriage is arranged for this very evening.', ? ,, 1 ' Miss Lucy, believes that ,you have always loved her, and accounts you, no 'doubt, .both good and generous!' 'I You have, exactly guessed it, Ma ster Joe.'^,' , , ? , 'And, she- nowrepents, ? and accuses herself-, that, in, her, thoughts, she' had,, deemed, you cowardly and infamous.' , ' Come, come, enough of this, Master, Joe,',' impatiently cried the captain, who, chafe i as he- might, , felt himsolf com pelled for that time to give the Found ling's tongue free license. . ''' Indexed, ] Lazonby's recent interview withjthe baronet and his, sister has, proved to us, that',the captain, what ever ; harsh , terms , might be applied to hinv could very, tamely endure them all when the wound, they wero,, intended , to inflict was (likely , to fJbo plastered , over with bank7notes. J, „ , , vl ;, , ,., , ? . .'Let us,, pass,',' ( .said- Lazonby,';, tov the real matter in question.1/ , ,,, t , - ,,, _, j 'pl/ani) rpady,'- Joe quietlyiresponded.' , |' Wei], then, that.' tfellow'— Limpy Lnby, I think you call him — has told m; that yon had something to say to m°, n paper to give into my hands.' ' Yes, true, Captain Lazonby ; I have to tell you that I know by what act of infamous treachery yon have repaid confidence and hospitality. In a word, I know all.' ' Very good,' said Lazonby, quietly, and in a tone of the most perfect indiff erence. ' I think,' he added, ' I could guess from whom you have gained your infor mation ; that, however, .is a matter of no consequence ; the really important thing is that proof of which Luby spoko to me.' ' What proof ?' ' That of Captain Tr,egarvon's death.' ' That is not the question. First of all, you must repair the shameful wrong that yon have inflicted on tho sister of the man who esteemed yon, and of whom you called yourself the friend.' ' Yes, yes, Blaster Joe, all shall be repaired, but before proceeding further, you must prove to me that I shall do right in making that reparation.' ' Does not your conscience tell you so ?' demanded the Foundling. ' Master Joe,1' lightly and recklessly returned the captain, ' my conscience is a well- taught child, and speaks not but when it is questioned, and I am by no mean's of an inquisitive turn of.mind. But if you will prove .to me that the baronet's precious uncle will never re turn, this very evening shall see mo — ' ' Joe, interrupting, and with difficulty restraining himself, said — ' But if I had not that proof which you demand ?'' The captain- recoiled: d step, and Joe pnrsned — ' If I had but made rise of that means to lure you back to this place, in order to place yon face to face with your crime, and to tell you that it must bo repaired.' ?' In that case, Master Joe,' cried the captain, ' I shou'd l»e sorely tempted to bestow upon you tb*o hearty thrash ing yon would deservv^Jlut certainly within five minutes I 'should have' taken my place in the boat that brought me hither, and which remains in waiting for me beneath the walls of the castle ; in an hour or so I should be at the railway station, and to-morrow I should be once more in London, where, by the way of parenthesis, I wou'd advise you never to bring your ugly carcase within reach of my riding- whip ' There was a short silence',- and then Lazonby, who had been reflecting, re sumed — ' But come, Joe, all this is a joke, is , not? A trick just to try me ?' Joe did not answer, and the captain, then convinced that he had been serious, was about to vent his rage in a volley of oaths, when Joe at last spoke — ' So then, nothing has power to retain yon here ? Neither her love nor her tears ?' ' Nothing, except money ; for I am reduced almost to my last shilling,'1 said Dudley Lazonby. ' tOh,, you have neither heart nor honour lh'or probity!' Joe exclaimed. ' It was not then her sweet look and lovely smile which dazzled, and caused you so shamefully to deceive that trust ing angel ! Oh, I am loath to believe that — can scarcely bring myself to be lieve it ; it is, though, as I too plainly see, the truth — but enough of words.' ' Enough, and to spnre, Master Joe,' cried the captain. ' That which I now desire is , to ' see you the' lawful husband of poor Lucy Tregarvon ; I know that you are with out honour, almost without human feel ing, and that you must be bought to render justice to your victim — well, I will purchase you !'' He drew forth the document that had been within the little' tin-case, and ex tended it towards the captain, holding it firmly, , and keenly watching 'that 'gentleman's movements, lest ho should attempt to obtain possession of it. 'There,'' exclaimed Joe, 'there is the proof that the uncle of the baronet and his, sister is really dead — is that your price, Captain Dudley Lazonby ?' Lazonby ran his eyes over the .docu ment and saw that it really was that which the Foundling had asserted it to be. ' How, by what chance came this in your possession ?' demanded the' 'cap- tain. ,',' ,. , , |c That has nothing to do with it. , Is this your price ?-» said Joe. i - ' 'Thosoare harsh words,',' muttered. Lazonby, pretending to 'feel quite'jhnrt.' '* , Joe, made an 'indignant gesture. j . ? r ! ' Are you ready to become .her hus band ?' sternly he demanded. ' This very moment,' replied the captain. ' That is well ; on my part, I pledge myself to give this paper into your hands immediately on the close of the marriage ceremony.' 11 But surely, considering the point to which matters have now reached — ' ' You can either accept or' .reject, whichever shall please you best,'! said the Foundling. 'Well, be it as you would 'have it,' shrugged the captain. Joe was moving away. . i ' One word more,' cried Lazonby. ' When that document fell into ! your hands, why did you not, instead of send ing for me, 'deliver it at once to the baronet ?' 'Because ^ Sir Robert Tregarvon would refiise to have ^anything more to do vith yon,' coldly responded Joo. The captain laughed. ' You were, then, ^positively deter mined, Master Joe, that I should 'be. married and settled ?' ' It would appear so.' 'But why:?' ' You pester me,'1 impatiently suid 'Joe; and abruptly turned his back on the captain. Lnzonby walked away, and re-entered the castle. in high spirits, thinking that Nobody's Child' was certainly the strang est animal he bad ever encountered. And Joe, paring slowly backwards .and forwards'withont thn castle walls, was saying to himself — ' What,1 then, is love ? ' It. must be a fever, a madness, a punishment — or angels would not love such monsters.' Yes, that was it, he decided— it was ameans that heaven1 employed to pun ish human beings for their' faults, caus ing that they should not love those by whom they were beloved, and that they should love those by whomv they were detested. So was it with him, so with Patty, so, too, with poor Lucy Tregar von. But what mattered ? presently Lucy would be really and truly a' wife,' that was all he needed then— -the rest would speeedily.fbllow. Chapter XXIX. WAH TO THE KNIFE. An hour later, Dudley Lazonby and Lucy Tregarvon were really and truly husband and wife. In an apartment of the castle they were privately united by the rector of St. Arven, and so secret was the mar riage that it was entirely unknown ex cept to those immediately concerned in its performance, and not in the least suspected by any other member of the baronet's h'onsehold. As there was not one word of the truth in that story cincerning his sud den acquisition of great wealth, which he had' related to the baronet- ; and his sister^ Lazonby was particularly anxious to get into his own hands that legal proof of Captain Tregarvon's decease. His purpose was, to make his own terms with the baronet before yielding to him that precious document,' for otherwise, that portion of her uncle's fortune which Lucy inhciitcd, would be very much smaller than tho 'amount which would fall to her brother. - The barorict : would see himsolf ? com pelled to yield, and quietly, too ; for now that Lazonby was indeed her hus band, fears for what his sister might be made to suffer at the captain's hands, would compel the baronet to silence'. Thus reasoned Lazonby, and was de lighted with himself and all the world.' As soon after the marriage ceremony as he was able to separate himself from the rest, the captain was about to re turn to the spot without tho:'' castle where he had left the ' Foundling, and where he' expected again to find him; Entering at the door of that room at whose balcony we have before seen .Lucy, and which looked down upon an armlet of the sea, 'the captain was about to go out at the other,'1 when 'ho encountered Joe standing and blocking up the\door mj ' '-'''? ' Now,' Master Joe, since yon ? are here, you'of course know that tho mar riage on which ' you had so set' -your heart has been duly solemnised — that is tho correct' word, I believe,' said Laz onby, with 'a derisive laugh. ' ' V Yes,' replied Joe, ' we have time, and sh'al^not be 'disturbed.' ,' ', , He 'closed .and locked 'the, door at ^which he had been'; standing, rarld then. nli',1)'../ / , , i ) ?- \ ' walking over to the opposito one, that also he secured. ' Why, what the deuce are yon about ?' said the somewhat astonished captain. 'I am fastening tho doors, that we may not be interrupted. 'Quito an unnecessary precaution, Master Joe.' ' I think not Captain Lazonby. '! Now for that precious document.' ' There it is.' Joe. placed the paper on a , table just behind .? where ho was standing, and Lazonby advancing a step or two, about to take possession of it. But the Foundling, planting himself firmly between Lazonby and the object of his most earnest. desire, said — ',' Wait, captain, wait.' ''Wait?' echoed Lazonby. ' Yes, we hnvo now perfectly to un derstand each other concerning; our bar gain.' ' What is it you niean ?' cried . tho captain; greatly astonished. .'I mean that you rname was positively necessary to Miss Lucy Tregarvon, be cause your name alone could efface dis honor and repair tho shameful wrong _ you had done her. And as for ' your name, you sold, and I bought it— for one hour.' ' For one hour ?' exclaimed Lazonbj more : +,han ever astonished. \- Now, changing his tone and manner, Joe thundered forth — 'Oh, have you then believed that a woman like to her could be really the wife of such a man as. you — of a man^ for, whom nothing is sacred, neither * ?youth, nor confidence, nor love ? Heaven is:my witness that I have tried every thing in the attempt to draw from your heart one spark of honor or pity ; for I suffered and was ashnmed for her to see yon so . vile and cowardly!- But vainly have I searched in that dry and frozen heart— nothing have I found within it, nothing, nothing ! not so much as that,'' said Joe. as he snapped, his fingeTs— ' no, not so much as that of honesty and humanity .1' Dudley Lazonby started at the Foundling, and knew not what to make of him; never having given Joe credit for much sense, the captain was inclined to believe the little that he had ever possessed had now entirely forsaken him. And indeed Joe was then laboring under a species of madness, to which he had wrought, himself hy incessantly brooding over the tale that had been told to him by Patty. Love has driven crazy many a wiser man than was Joe ;. ; and all. hope of winning Lucy lost to himself, the promptings of his undeveloped . mind iirged him to an act far too extravagant finvthis sober nineteenth century, and which showed that he ought to have been born in the days of ? chivalry anil romance. ^ Though Lucy never could belong to him, yet was it his duty— so he brought himself, to believe— to redress her wrongs — to avengei liRrinjuri(?s. ':My good fellow, what is the matter with yon ?'. demanded the captain. 1 Joe, instead of replying to that .ques tion', said — ' But I was not to be . defeated, for well I felt assured that one way there was by which you might be brought to do justice to the woman you had so infamously betrayed ; I knocked against that iron heart with bags of gold, and at once, to. the sound of metal, metal responded ; now,' added Joe, in a low, stern voice, '.'it is. another thing ; my patience is exhausted, and I am about to kill you !'' Dudley Lazonby recoiled, and glanced rather uneasily from one to the other of the closed doors; ' W^onld you assasinate me ?'' he cried, now feeling quite convinced that Joe was mad. ' No,' Joe loftily said ;' ' it shall be ?a fair' encounter/ a duel.'' That notion appeared so ridiculous to , Lazonby that his momentary fear was gone-and ho was seized with a fit of laughter.- ! 'A.,duel with Nobody's Child!' ho exclaimed. J i ' Precisely,' said Joe. ' That would be too good — in such a case, you poor fool, it is you who .would be the victim.' ' Oh— that, captain, is heaven's sc cret.'1 . . i Having said that, Joe plunged his ,.- hand into his breast, drew forth, two - large, knivo1;, and threw them on to a table. i i ' .\; i , , % ' Now choose,'1 ho'bHed.'v ' : ; ,' '.Why, what tho'dbuco are those) Master Joe ?' j ' Two knives, quite n'e\y, both' alike in the handle, eqnally-'welt' sharpened, . and in every respect precisely alike.' t ' Come, come, Joe, I have had enough ? of this nonsense.'
