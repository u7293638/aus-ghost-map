THURSDAY, NOVE&WER; 19, ISßö. The Legislative Council has now finished with the Licensing Bill, and has returned the measure to the place fiom whence it carno A good deal of interest attached to the question how the measure -would be dealt with, in as much as it is tho first bill presented to the new Council which was likely to bring out any difference of bias in tho two Chambers of the Legislature. Up to date, all Government proposals -which had come before the Upper House vere such as wore sure to command support theie All had been pieviously the sub jeet of long debato, and all weie framed *on constitutional lines But theLicensing Hill contained new mattei, which had provoked a great difierenco of opinion outbide thq Chambers, and it ivas pos sible that a bill Mewed from one stand point in the Assembly might bo viewed from another in the rcfoimed Council, and that radical differences would thus betray themselves But this cqn tingeucy lias not occuned On the contraiy, a íemarkabie similarity be tween the two Houses has been dis closed, a similarity in parties, in debate, and in conclusions In both theie haï o been the Bame groups of teetotal members asking for largo concessions, and asking hi vain, and of representa tivi-s, truo to then old tiaditionS, endeavouring to minimiso state intoi ference, and also endeavouring in -vam ÎVhat tho llefoim Act has given us as a legislative Council would appeal to be an improved Legislativo Assembly-an Upper House which will not dissent from the Lower unless the latter rushes into ov.ces°cs, but which can put the brako on ellecttiaHj when it puts it on at all The old Council was inclined to uso the brako moro frequently than is the piesent IIouso-though allow anco must bemado foi theencumstanco that a reformed Council and a reas n able Assembly caine into eustenco to gethoi-but tho machinery ivas not btiong enough for the tension bo fal as tho Licensing Bill is concerned, tho outcome need not be cavilled at For many misons it is not desirable that there should bo a collision between the two Houses on this subject, and at this juncture, and mainly because, as was seen at M est Melbourne, the issue separates and unites in an oxtraordiuaiy manner-div iding politicians who ought to be lighting side bj side, ami bringing togethei men who li wo no real pim ciples in common Anj liconsing net is a compromise, and a compromise is ad visible just now if only that the issue may not bo an nnpoitaiit factor at the general election Tho licensed iictuallcis had apna rently a belief that tho Council would e\cept "acquitcd nsjhts ' gonuall} fiom the opeiauon of tho new act lho question riiaol was is to vvhethci publichoiii.es now licensed, but which do not comnlj with tho stitutoiy con dition» iib to accommodation, should, 01 should not be c oinptul and tho de ci ion is tint tilt} nie not to bo lho house-v must be e ii u¿ed 01 put m order, 01 then licence is not lenewable But bj a new eliuse the licence with the consent of the Licensing Bench, can be tianefeuel to a pio[ti house ni the same division J lie cffoit made to piovidc tint a thud of the îatepajcis houl 1 vote loi the closing of houses in older to e nstitute a valid poll was also unsuccessful the decision is tobo ic ?rettcd, for it is faiily arguable that pal ticulai houses should not be suppicsse 1 -tlio expense of compensating the owners being thrust upon the state-. unless a stiong local feeling exists upon the sub|Cee The enormous power gn en toa small minont\\-as one sixth of tho \ oters in a district may reduce to tho stitutory muimnm-is one o£ the dangers of the bill, and another is the thiow ng of the compensation upon the stato instead 01 upon the locality 1 ho soundness of the dictum of Lord S \l isiiL rï , that local option shouldmean local compensation is not tobe seriously disputed I he rcspon'-ibihtv of having to bear the pecuniary consequences of their action would niatenally tend to steady the action of the tatepajcis, ?«hilo, ns it is, thej can be wrtuous at other peoples expense The tcetottl section has its own wiy with these two points, ind its members can well aflore! thciefore to allow the minor amendments of tho Council to pass un challenged Hie alterations which ha\o been made aro nil of a piactical character It is admitted that tho disallowed section forbidding a brewer or a wine and spirit merchant to have an interest m a public house could be easily e\aded, and, therefore it is not woith insisting upon Tho re putablo trader would be handicapped by the clause, but any lndilkrent tiader against whom it ma-, bo sup posed to be aimed would hugh at the resttiction Hie anti barmaid claude was expunged, because, as drafted, it was unintelligible Hie shop assist- ants name 04 hours as the pi oper terra for a week's labour behind the counter, and a proposal to so limit the barmaids would probably meet with a fuendlj reception Hie Assembly also objected to single women holding licences, but tho Council has simply lett the le sponsibihty of granting or refusing licences to the feme sote to the "high " class court," which is the " precioua " jewel " of a by no means well favoured measuro While it would bo ungiacions for teetotal members in the Assembly to cavil at the lo« corrections mado by the Council, it would bo folly foi the Ik ensed victuu 'ers to attempt an oppo sition Tho objection of tho ti ade must be, not to tho amendments made by the Council, but to tho provisions which have passed unamended. And the trade could work only bj inducing any two or threo members it can m lluenco to stonewall the measuro, with a view of remitting tho issue to tho constituencies But as tho two Houses have concurred in these proposals, it ia not piobablo that the eleUoiates would materially modify than, and it is ^eiy possiblo that a refusal on tho part of the licensed victuallers to accept tho pailmmentary decision would be utilised to ai ouse a hostile feeling m the community Imitation is the sincerest foi m of flatteiy, and the cittfens of Vittoria ought to feel flatteied that Mr, Uhif nui has just treated the colony of Queensland to a parody of the conflicts between the two Chambeis of the Legislature which ga%o such an un pleasant notoiiety to this c lonya few years back Appaiently nothing could be more gratuitous than the attempt to raise a constitutional stiuggle on so \ery ignoble a question as a "salai} "giab" Had some çreat democratic principio beon involved, or somo popu lar liberty been in danger, theie would havo beon a bettei excuso foi resorting to the extremo stop of a "tack" to an appropriation bill Mr Gummi may havo behe\ed that his colony needed a great historical and paihamentary episode of this kind, in oidor to plate it on an equality with tho big sister states, but he ctitanily chose a íathei shabby incident to " im\ke history " out of Little interest seems to have beon created m the colony itself by Mi Gnin mi's tiny coup d ttat Had the " compromise," which was doubtless patt of the preananged performance, been delayed foi a few dajs, there would have been a stoppage of pay ments from the Treasurj As theatucnl people say, "tho ghost woufd ha\o ia "fused to walk," und theie might lme been a species of national "suspen " sion of payments " of the Victo- rian "deadlock" type No one in tho colony app'ean, \o ha\e been seriously inconvenienced after all, but it is probable that the credit of Queens land in other places has received some what of a shock Now a dajs moro at tention is paid by tho inhabit nits of what might bo called " the loan furnishing "countnos" to colonial politics.

Heb Majesty's Go- vernment will concedo those rights pio udod that the Australian colonies will gimrauteo £50,000 per annum. It is not too much to piedict that the reply of tho Australian colonies will bo unanimous, simple, and emphatic, and will bo smn maiised m the words, "Not hfty thou " sand penco." Now Guinea is now dividod into threo paits. Holland takes about half tho island, and the other half is divided between Germany and Groat Bntnm Holland has hold hei hugo noith western moa for nearly » contuiy, and has not spent £100 per annum for tho fireatox p.ut of the teim It is only, indeed, at this period of her history that, stiircd up by Australian entcipriso, a Dutch explora- tion is talked about. Theio is not a Dutch functionaiy in or about tho island, and tho German Government tloes not pioposo to appoint a functionary either, noi yet to spend a ponny.

Australia nieroly wanted south eastern New Guinea to hold as the Dutch havo hold lho north-westein por- tion in Older to koop other people away, because, as tho centuries roll on, no ono can toll what may happen.
