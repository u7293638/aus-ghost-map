An intendT ing - opponent,' Mr- J.- Hall. T has with drawn .from - the 'unequal contest, an.i it is quite 'on the cards that the third candidate, who*1 has expressed himself as anxious to measure swords with Mr Mason,' will not toe the mark. The latter gentleman is candidly informed by a paper circulating in the constituency that he has not 4 ghost of a chance of ousting /the present member, and no doubt that .worthy journal speaks truth. \Mr Mason:s political % enemies have raised two old bogies â€” his resi dence in Melbourne instead of his elec torate, and also the fact that he has been tlie member for South Gippsland for 29 years. -This last argument is put forward on the score that it is time 'fresh blood' was introduced, but the electors might go very much further and fare g/ great deal worse in il-e choice; of a representative.
