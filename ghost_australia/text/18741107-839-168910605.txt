Exper'i'-' cnce has, however, siric'o. then pointed out to me1, th'o very reverse of What Mr. Xatta's .experiments' 8oom tb.have/poiiite'd qut to him. In his paper lie states' i^-',' t had the good' fortune1'' to 'come across -some fine 'specimens of cubical' pyrites,.

' ! Taking this experi ment as' hiB datuni,.Mr..Latta.iufera the necessity of -roasting tailings for tiie purpose of extracting tho gold therefrom.' ' As a 'scientific man he has grappled with th©: subject in aits proper place, but! tfcontend.-.thathia. inferences ,.are. wrong, because,'; adthittinghis ?'go.od. . fortune''. in ?tins- paTticular- instance ' in coming. across some 'fine ? specimens, of cubical pyrites,' i&c;, . I -think-'it must boitakeh.aB.the exception, not the rule,.fbr I have over and over again tried to ascertain-. the same fact by the-veryf same, means, but with'.a result .the very 1 reverse .'of ' Mr I Latta's. More than that, 'Knowing' 'the' :irh'porfance-' of 'clearing up this: point, :I;:haye .picked' out: specimens of cubical' pyrites, 'ponri'de'd, roasted, ''washed ithem with yacida',' and 'then applied '''the microscope without 'bb'ihg successful' ' ill seeing any -gold. The tendency of all this, [with further-.a'nd gene ral observations,* ' 1iave ' ' 'for'' t some' , time' 'past impressed -me with' .the, opinion Hhat :as: ajrulo gold does not occur in the' pyrites 'itself ; hbr on the faces of the '.deavngeB, .hiit: -rather it goes along. jWith the quartz which 'is associated with it. If the'tlicory for which I here contend ;be cor rect, then tho expensive.- and laborious treatment of roasting the pynfcous.pres-can, under. ordinary ?circumstances, be dispensed with, -'aiid ' merely mechanical appliances ?resorted to!' I have been helpefl to these ctmckis'io'ris' by 'the results ob tained from* operations .carried on'here oh'a' large scaled lately, and t}ie.'.7.anfprn)ation:;,bbt£ined has j^a nioBt valuable ?tendency.' 'A* 'Mr. Denny lias brought oiit .;a, ; machine ' styled a, 'pulverizer.' 'It re'd'uc'o's ' the' refuse' to a ? grea^ef degreoof fineness than/it wns'in when it left the stfimper'ooxes,''and further' it seems to extract tioarlytliowholeofthegold which careful assays had previously, shown these residues to .contain. ThDr)peroentage of gold left behind is so small in comparison tp the amount saved that its vAhie J8'fotuid'tdbe'(at-a]l events at present) not (worth' Considering. This :then shows* that the whole of 'tho gold' ; within -attraction can be extracted without' roasting ;' consequently the goldjs not; 'as Mr; Lattaand'oth'ors'wonld;have it, enveloped in a' cluster of sulphide atoms; I have not given'figures hero because I prefor to show that I base my opinions on an accumu lation of corroborative facts rather than on the evidence of one single experiment, and further, the details for carrying out the latter trials were not 'made with any view to scientific discovery, nor'j;ijy persons accustomed to deal with : scientific experiments. I havo therefore preferred giving a general statement of results which for all practical purposes are sufficient enough.at all oven,ts to show that mechanical appliances can bo constructed 'which ,. will . extract gold; from ? tailipgs, also the probability, almost' amounting! to a certainty, 'that this, metal is'npt enveloped1 in a; substance ^[antagonistic! to' amalgamation j as si.ijphur nncPiiLs compounds are.. ? ;' ' . ,'.',', j Tliis, then, is the result of the, trial^of Bamples ? of tailings on tliis fieldj ' whilst niy previous ex-| perim.ents on samples of ore from other fields. ,lead me to hope that the same facts will be; Established elsewhere.
