PERTH POLICE COURT. (Before Mr G. C. Knight, A.P.M.) THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 16TH. JAMES REID was charged with having been drunk and disorderly in St. George's Terrace on Wednesday evening. The arrest- ing Constable having deposed, to the charge; the prisoner handed in a written statement to the effect that about 9 p.m., on Wednes- day, he picked up a helmet in Murray Street; belonging, he believed, to a policeman who was intoxicated. He took it to the police station, but was ordered to take himself off. Like a fool he then said he would go to the Commissioner of Police, and in consequence of this two constables were told off to follow him, and arrest him, which they did at the Commissioner's gates. Sergeant Claffey said it was quite true that the man brought the helmet, but it was not a policeman's. It was a very old and dilapi- dated article of attire. Detective Connor also gave information about the man's visit. He was drunk at the time, and used bad language. Upon Sergeant Claffey stating the man's record, the latter, who has an impediment in his speech, exclaimed, " You are telling the Magistrate how to act. You are the Magis- trate, you great, long, white ghost, you !" The Bench fined him 5s., or seven days in default, and he was led away threatening what he would do to the Sergeant when he came out of prison.
