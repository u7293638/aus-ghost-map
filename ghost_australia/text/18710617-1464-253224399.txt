( Chorus ) Tow- row-row, &c.; A youth it seem'd, to mirth inclined, ('Tis true he shouldn't do it, ) A shocking wicked note designed — ( Pid . said " he'd make him rue it ") — And sent it with his Boss's seal All by the penny post, sirs, Which, when he read it, turn'd Sir Jeames All white as Hamlet's Ghost, sirs. ( Chorus ) Tow-row-row, &c.; Moral. Long live our gracious Queen, sings 1, Long live our noble Earl, sirs ; And o'er this here bright sunny land, Let Britain's flag unfurl, sirs ; And may all missives harmless be Yot silly folks indites, sirs, As this here foolish gibb'rish scrawl Yot gave Sir Jeames the frights, sirs. ( Chorus ) Tow-row- row, &c.;
