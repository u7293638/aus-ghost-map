Advice to a Theatrical Aspirant. a letter from Clinton, Ky., signed Brutus Booth. Hawkins, aBked the club as a body . whether it would advise a fairly-educated, average-looking young coloured man to take ; the stage for a profession. He could, he stated, take the part of old man, young man, doctor of divinity, or butcher boy, and his imitations of a parrot or a blue-jay were simply immense. All he wanted, he believed, was a little encouragement from his own race. He had worked some at throwing up a bed for a railroad, but he felt more at home behind the footlights. Be queshun am one which kin be an swered right now an' right heah.' said the old man as he softly stood up. I hev bin dar I Dar was a time, when ! fought I could tak the part o Hamlet wid any white 1 man livin'. I used to go round wid my fonghta fixed on ghosts air skulls an' graves an' de King of Jinmark. I dreamed of houses ' an' readin' in de news papers dat I war de greatest actor of de modern, day. I Saw de top round of de ladder of fame right over my head, an' I reached up fur it.. I run de actor biziness two years; doorin' dat period 1 froze to death, starved to death, lost a house an lot, an' foun" dat I was called a fool ten times tor ebery cent I took in. Be only newspaper whichever praised me busted in a week. Bo only boy who eber gave me a .one core died of the measles afore I left the town. Be only honse I ever packed was an ice- house. i know all about foot-lights, wings, legs, sty-borders, traps, right exits an' left go ods, but when the sable mantle of night falls down xipon de y'arth Ize satisfied to sit wid my feet in the oven of de cook-stove an' lot somebody else jump in from de lef' wing an' mop pohrYorick all ober de stage. If dis young nigger keeps at de profeshun of too win' np railroad beds dar am some chance ferhimin de fuchur. If he takes to de atage he needn' hops dat dis club will lend him any money on his undershirts an' stock- ings. â€” Detroit Lime-Kiln Club.
