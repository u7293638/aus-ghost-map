THELONDON wool market. aistbalian news imparts confidence. EUNOUSLY LOW PRICES OBTAINED FOR UNSIGHTLY PARCELS, (our si'kciab lkttek.) I)>"DOX, September 30. — The course of the palic sales siucc last mail has not brought on any features of striking importance or of ny great encouragement to wool growers in tfe matter of improved prices. Well got-up geasy Australian, especially snaity properly prirtod parcels in light ami free condition las held its own and sold with keen compoti. ;ion for both Yorkshire and the United States at full opening rales, the run being most marked, as previously advised, on clips of broad-haired style rather than very line qililMiy. JiLtn y ii iiikii ui-(.iiinui.iuiit;>i, badly skirted or atail unsightly by reason of long keeping in warehouse?-, has been going akabsurdiy low prices, as the annexed figures only too plainly show; for this class the market iias been so irregular that it is almost impossible to quote relatively, but this feature has been prominent- all along un fortunately. I do not Mtpposo it will be much comfort to know that the New Zea land; and Cape wools are selling on an even lower basis for greasy parcels lluui the poor inferior Australian, but it will be some little satisfaction to know that prices lor the latter are comparatively higher than for the pro duce of the otliVr colonic?;. Good souml'Now Zealand merino combing of fully average style has hecn selling freely at O.ld to 7d per lb. it is many years .since tlicy were ad de pressed; the doubtful yield is also acting pre judicially upon the sale. ( Yossbreds have gone better the. past few days, imt the selec tion of fair parcels being small has hail a good deal to do with the improvement iu values. As regards the future of tin; staple, J find a small amount of encouragement from the all but unanimous verdict of the whole of the wool dealers and speculators with whom I have come in to con tact tli is past fortnight, that raw wool is quite cheap enough at to-day's prices. There is no strong desire on ihe - part of any section — except perhaps spinners who have booked orders for yarns at foolishly low rales — for cheaper v.ool, but a cer tain kind of feeling is gaining ground tliat if a rise of >ay Ad to Id per lb. could be established it would be decidedly beneficial, inasmuch us it would cause, the merchants and export cloth houses to place orders, and so imparl a little life and go to the trade. The ghost of " no con fidence" is perhaps not haunting the trade quite so closely, Imt still there is sad lagging behind on the pari of many. Nobody seems to have any idea whcimo the first signs of revival are to be looked for. A current complaint amongst wool-dealers is, ".1 have got plenty of 'cheap' wool, but don't know when; to sell it." The opening of your .Sydney sales this week just as the Adelaide last week), with prices reported fully as high (if not a shade above) London rates, has really hecn received with some degree of pleasure ami t hankfulne.es by those who hold stocks this side, as the fear was strong iu Urn minds of many that, a weaker market might have been experienced on your side than has actually been the ease, if any thing the eflect upon these sales has been beneficial.
