AMUSEMENTS. . THE OPERA. In the notices of the former performances of Weber's masterpiece, " Der Freischutz," during the present season he spoke of the music and the peri motors As in this opera is a far greater degree than ordinary y the libretto is important, it may be interesting to our readers to Biyeau outline of the story on which it is founded and for the information of the curious refer them to a full account to Di Grasse s brochure "810 Galleries Fleischer Dresden is \ Zulu s Acting) Joh mu 1 Friederich Kind was a few student at Leipzig, an advocate at Dresden, and fit in 194 decided 1 myself to literature In 1810 1 E Schultze, who wrote as 11 Larra, und Apel were joint editors of the Gc^pcnsti)bitch, about the same time a publication known to belong to Schultze, or I am, entitled " Monthly Conversations from the Spirit World, ' contained a story which, abridged, reads thus In 1710,111 nBohcinian town, lived George Schmidt, a clerk 18 years old. He was fond of shooting, and consulted a huntsman friend on the best mode of hitting the bull's eye Schmidt consented to accompany him in the night of July 20 to cast bullets, sixty of which would hit whenever they were aimed at, three, exactly like the others, would fail At the stated time the huntsman chow a circle with his cutlass, and found that strange characters he then bade Schmidt deny God and the city At 11 o'clock the coils piled in the centre ignited of their own accord, and the casting: began theyhad to Bush by midnight, or the Bowl claimed both Phantom appeared, and disturbed them I mally one on a black steed rode up, and asked what they wanted They told him, he demanded their bullets, they refused Then the black horseman cast something into the fire, and both fell down half dead from the stench thereof, they remained thus till dawn The hunter had gone through the ordeal before, and rallied first, the clerk could not move The huntsman tan to the village with the bullets, and reported that a man was sick on the road, and disappeared Schmid was brought to the town, and questioned so closely that he confessed the whole He was imprisoned and sentenced to be burnttodeath, but such efforts were made on his behalf that his punishment was changed into shearers prisonment with hard labour From this Acel constructed a. dramatically for the Gapcnstei buch, introducing the chief ranger, wife, daughter-the trial shot- and ends the whole in a tragic way Kind found the drama, met Weber, the two were mutually attracted, and the poet agreed to write a libretto for the musician's opera He con lesses the source upon which he founded the poem, he lays the scene fifty years earlier than Apel, changes some chin acters, introduces Zamiel, leaves out some of the horrors and inserts new ones in the Wolf's Men, lettuces the bullets from 60 to 7, of which one is fallible, and makes everyone happy at the end. The poem at once de- lighted W Weber. He had within the few previous years passed through a critical period of his life, and after a stormy, restless, wandering time found himself settled comfortably with congenial work He had just married a lady, an artist to whom he was passionately attached, and all circumstances combined to place him in a mood on which he might concentrate his power, and give him all possible ancestry 0 to climb to the highest point of musical fame, and after nearly sixty years' trial, " Der I Freischutz " is looked upon as the culminating point of his genius Weber alw a\ s nr Know led read his frontage to Kind and the result of his next work, ' Lurjauthe" which the Berliners inis chievously called Jb'Liiiiiii/nnte, despite its great musical worth failed through the stupidly weal plot in the libretto not within 1 yon ( hey It would be interesting, did space j ed out to trace the history and pr ITEMS of "aJcifreischutz ' inflame where the Friends or Vnbo were various at the sucée s of the occupiers Mcjeibeci Enough to say that, as spoken dialogue could not be permitted at the Academic Royale, so useful centuries were written for the work, and, although done by Berlioz, they were failures, and also that, as it was necessary to introduce extra, spectacle the preface states the music of the du e timents consists 01 dance tunes from 'Oberon' and Prenosa' (operas by ArA abel), to which the author of thoricitatives has added, in miangiugitioi the aches 1 v lthoutchnugmg singleness, the celebrated London for the Pianoforte entitled "Is it ition a la Valse' (likewise be Weber') This was in '55 Imagine the serious parts of Hamlet 01 Julius Caesar record by passages from "Comcdvol Errors,' 01 " twelfth Night' (likewise by Shakespeare) or the poetry of Crainte 1 relieved by Pinafore, (likewise by Gilbert), and the horror, to the musical world and be imagined Four years ago but one of the barbarisms was allowed to disfigure the work Berlioz s instrumentation is marvellous, but it destroys the beauty of the original With pleasure we congratulate the company on the performance last night the part of the gentle Agatha is exactly suited to Miss Elsa May, and the opposite 1 characteristics in the cousin whose gaiety Agatha half armies, harmonise perfectly with Mme Rose Hersee's piquant humour while the tenderly romantic and mystic loving Max stands in excellent contrast with the false re vengeful Caspar andtheothorcharactershtinmosthappily.
