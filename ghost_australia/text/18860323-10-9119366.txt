A LAMP WANTED. \- Singing of the darkest, gloomiest, and most dismal spots in the city is that at the corner of Campbell and Letitia streets on a dark night. To superstitious or weak minded females, the Scrubby burial ground on the one side, associated with ghosts, goblins, and forming such a fine retreat for the more real and more to be feared desperadoes, who sometimes startle the community with their exploits after dark and the domain on the other cast a shade which is truly fearsome. A lady the other night, attempting to find Letitia-street, lost herself and wandered out into the domain. Besides this, the corporation have placed some huge cobbles In such a position at the corner as to catch and overturn any passing vehicle, the driver of which not being able to see them. Such was the fate of a baker's cart a few nights ago. Letters and prayers are before the aldermanic body on the subject, but probably we shall have to wait until somebody's neck is broken or a murder and robbery takes places before we shall get it Yours, etc., > NICE.
