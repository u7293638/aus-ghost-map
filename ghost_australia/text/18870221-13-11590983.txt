MONDAY, FEBRUARY 21, 1887. The policy of working the New Guinea protectorate an thorough sympathy with the New Guinea missionaries has often been urged in these columns It will be a disappointment if the action of the missionaries renders this course to any extent impossible The other day we called attention to the breach between the Hon J DOUGLAS, the Special Commissioner for New Guinea, and the Rev. W. G. LAWES on the subject of land purchases from the natives Mr DOUGLAS thinks that certain areas ought to be purchased from the natives by the Government to be sold afterwards to suitable white settlers, and Mr LAWES is lively and eloquent in attacking the proposition as improper and as a breach of faith This attitude of Mr LAWES seems to have occasioned surprise among even the follow workers of the revel end gentleman The Rev JOSEPH KING, in particular, wrote to us, arguing that he had mistaken Mr L vv is Our correspondent declines to believe that Mr. LAW FS means much more than that there shall be no forced alienation of land by unwarranted occupation or mock purchase The missionary contention, Mr luvo presumes, is that nothing like BATMAN'S bargain with the Corio blacks, of the more recent acquisitions by the French in the New Hebrides, is to be recognised to the judicious introduction of decent settlers of the right stamp, Mr KING assures us, the missionaries would not object Action on their part evidently appears as incredible to him as it seemed not incredible but impolitic to us But, unfortunately, there is no mistake "Y No could wish Mr KING were right His views are identical with our own We agree with him that care must be taken of the natives and then interests all round, but we also agree with him when he writes - If British rule in any form is to be maintained in New Guinea, the ruling power must derive some revenue from the governed fund and however inexpensively governed sufficient revenue cannot be realise 1 unless there be some foreign settlement Human turning views are not likely to prevail at Downing street to such an extent as to make the Fuller Government willing to govern New Guinea solely in the interests of the New Guinean A British colony from which British colonists are excluded would be an anomaly indeed i everyone must see that it British subjects are taxed to support administrators in New Guinea some liberty must be given to the taxpayers to try their own fortune in the land upon which their own money is expended But this paragraph seems to be in hopeless opposition to the views of Mr LAWES when he reminds the Commissioner that the commander promised, " Evil disposed men will not be " allowed to occupy your land, and proceeds to ask, " If hundreds come to " New Guinea, what test can any Govern- " ment employ to distinguish between " the evil and the well disposed t The fellow labourer of Mr L \\.v IS, the Rev JAMES CHAI MI RS, is now in London, and his address to the Royal Colonial Institute proceeds on the same lines as the protest of the Port Moresby resident so that there can be little doubt that a common policy has been agreed upon Uns policy is to put a strained construction on the proclamation of the Commodore who announced the protectorate, and to insist that New Guinea is to be reserved for the Papuans-the white men not to be allowed to acquire holdings Mr CHALMERS speaking to a London audience, quoted the proclama- tion as follows - Whereas it has become essential for the lives and properties of the native inhabitants of New Guinea and for the purpose of pre- seen it in, the occupation of portions of that country by persons whose proceedings, in sanctioned by any lawful authority, might tend to injustice, strife, and bloodshed, and who, under the pretence of legitimate trade and intercourse, might endanger the liberties and possess themselves of the lands of such native inhabitants, that a British protectorate should be established over a certain portion of such country : Now I, James Elphinstone Erskine . . . hereby pro- claim and declare that no acquisition of land, whensoever and howsoever acquired, within the limits of the protectorate, will be recognised by Her Majesty and I do hereby, on behalf of Her Majesty, command and enjoin all persons whom it may concern, to take notice of this proclamation." Mr. CITALJIL'RS calls for men " who will "strictly carry out this truly great " proclamation." He objects to the demand for annexation, for that would be to make white colonisa- tion certain. He says, " Annexation " cannot be asked for on the plea of " the need of land. We need no more " territory while Australia with its wide " areas is still unoccupied, and will be " so for another century." The plea would be plausible if we did not remember that it would have prevented not only the settlement of Fiji, but of New Zealand also. Had the principle been acted upon, New Zealand, the Britain of the South, would to day be the scene of the French convict colony which now clusters about Noumea, for New Zealand was settled exactly under the New Guinea conditions, namely, that white pioneers were on the coast, and that there was a danger of foreign occupation. Of course there was room in Australia at that time for all, and yet the annexation of New Zealand was desirable. Nor, according to this rule, had we any right to go to Tasmania. Mr. LAWES, it will be remembered, quotes to Mr. DOUGLAS and against him a resolution of the Sydney Con- version-" That no acquisition of land " should be permitted in the isles " except for missionary or trading pur " poses," is., for churches and stores, and not for settlers and planters, and he pleads that the resolution ought to be adhered to. It must be admitted, we fear, that the missionaries have made up their minds to check white colonisation, and, in the words of Mr. CHALMERS, to contend in a literal sense for New Guinea " for the New Guineans and the New " Guineans for New Guinea Euro- pears to be warned off the premises. The policy in question was, as we know, much favoured by Sir ARTHUR GORDON and Sir Wit DES VOUX, and to it may be directly traced all the political evils' of the Western Pacific. Sir War. DES VOUX urged the Sydney Convention to pass the resolution in question, and foolish and threatening as it was, it enabled the German firms who have bought land and are working plantations to declare to their Government that they were in danger of being robbed of their possessions. We know what steps the German Government took. It was in effect to place land, natives, and isles in absolute possession of the traders. Mr. CHALMERS hints that things are not going on as he would like them on the German side. It is well to remember how the German side was lost, and to reflect that the Australian side may be lost also. The missionaries will bring powerful influence to bear in Great Britain, and yet, if they succeed in establishing a rule of " Papua for the Papuans "-for the Papuans solely and only-without contact with the white man. the pro- tectorate is not at all likely to be continued by Australia. The Germans will in due course be at liberty to take the other side of the island, and when they do the settlers will be free at Port Moresby, as elsewhere, to form their own land courts, and make their own land bargains. It is surely far better for the missionaries to work with the Special Commissioner, who proposes that HER MAJESTY'S Government shall arbitrate in the matter, buying only such land as the natives can well spare, and selling only for the purposes of honest settlement. The position of the Conservative Ministry in Great Britain is, in many respects, without parallel in modern times. When Lord SALISBURY first took office in July last we ventured to predict that his Ministry, whatever its merits or demerits might be, " would be held down on their seats " by men of both parties, who would condone any blunders or shortcomings in order to prevent Mr. GLADSTONE'S return to office. This seems to have happened. The existing Ministry has been unlucky in many respects. Lord RANDOLPH ChuRCHiLL's withdrawal was a severe blow. . Lord IDDESLEIGH was supposed to have been badly treated by his colleagues, and his sudden and deplor- able death served to place the Ministry in a still more awkward light. Finally, Mr. GOSCHEN, who joined the Cabinet because it was notorious that no one of his intellectual calibre could be found on the Conservative side of the House of Commons, began by meeting with defeat at Liverpool. These and other misfortunes or blunders would, under ordinary circumstances, have weakened any Government whatever. Yet we now see amendments defeated, and the address in reply to the Speech from the Throne carried after a comparatively short debate by an enormous majority. For the first time in the history of the House of Commons the closure has been applied to terminate an important debate. This would appear to have been done under the first of the New Rules of Procedure," introduced in February, 1882, and finally adopted after a long dis cussion in November of that year. Eulo 1 gives the Speaker power-if he judges that such is the " evident wish of the " House to put the question at once. A " bare majority " is sufficient to carry the future, but that majority must be composed of at least 200 members. In 1882, the Conserva- tive party were the strongest opponents of the Procedure Rules, which at that time were supported by Liberals, mainly with a view to getting rid of expected Conservative obstructions to Liberal or Radica:."i,iagislation. Mr. LABOUCHERE, during the November debates on- procedure, hoped that the picture would be used often for party " purposes, and in the interests of speedy " legislation. . When the country " had made up its mind, discussion was " useless and he would give the " Opposition half-an- hour to state their " views, and no more " After lying dormant for four years the first of the new rules has now been used against the Irish Nationalists and their con- federates of whom Mr. LABOUCHERE is about the most prominent, in the House of Commons. The attempt to split the Unionist party has, in fact, signally failed. Symptoms of weakness or distress in the Conservative ranks merely prove to Unionist Liberals that Mr. GLADSTONE'S return is becoming more probable, whereupon they take precautions accordingly The collapse of the Parnell (Hailstone party at Westminster, and the discovery that the Unionist party is still intact in the House of Commons, may be seen in Ireland itself, where resistance to the authority of the law is reported to be increasing As long as there was any prospect of working on the ignorance jealousies, or fears of English political parties, a pretence of moderation was kept up by the Nationalist leaders Mr PARNELL discreetly got out of the way for some months leaving to Mr DILLON and to some of his lieutenants to urge Irish tenants not to pay their rents The pretence of moderation is now of course, dropped One of the archbishops of that exceedingly schismatical body, composed of members of Irish and American secret societies, which still calls itself " the Catholic Church,' recommends the Ii fish in? women not to pay taxes to the British Government Mr G ADS to a Home Rule Bill provided for the payment of a heavy annual tribute from Ireland At any time after the Home Rule Bill had become law Archbishop CROKE. might have been dissatisfied, and advised a stake against taxes since July last man) circumstances have shown what sort of place Ireland would be under an independent Parliament and Executive 'The political excitement and the enthusiasm for the Union which was worked up before the last general election has naturally died away somewhat But nothing has happened to reconcile either the Irish loyalists or the constitutional party in England- and that includes the majority of the " Liberal " party-to Mr GLADSTONE'S surrender to the Irish American conspirator s If such a lesson had been needed, the Conservative Government must have seen by this time the effect of their humane but ill judged exertions to induce land lords to reduce rents in some parts of Ireland in the hope of conciliating" the Nationalist leaders The result has of course been that attempts at conciliation have been lead throughout Ireland as a symptom of weakness The saying of SHIELS, an eminent lush leader, that " my countrymen are the " worst people in the world to run away " from,' hasprovedtrueforthehundiedtli time in the history of the English administration of Ireland The Conservative Government seemed inclined to run away, and the answer to Sir M H BEACH and Sir E BULLER for their interference in persuading landlords to make concessions to their tenants in le spect to judicial rents, is the armed resistance to evictions and Archbishop CROKES letter the rebuke adam listened to the authorities in Dublin by a judge for their connivance at resistance to the officers of the law engaged in executing the decrees of courts of law has also brought matters to a head in Ireland The Government is told that it has no choice in the matter, and that as long as it calls itself a Government it must carry the law out A sharp struggle may, there fore, be looked for between the "QUEEN'S Government and the Nationalists in Ireland The American directors of the Nationalist conspiracy will no doubt order the ' top of murders and outrages, which has been turned off for a few weeks, to be turned on again What effect that policy will have on opinion in England remains to be seen In addition to Parliamentary obstruction, which appears to have failed, the Nationalist weapons are, of course, terror and appeals to humanity In the poorest parts of Ireland, which Englishmen are never able to distinguish from the most thriving, evictions are generally accompanied by distressing scenes The description of them is used to excite compassion among English readers-as notably in the recent Qlenbeigh evictions in the County every, where the tenants had paid no rent for six years, and the property had been long abandoned by the landlord to the mortgagees This was, indeed, a typical and a most valuable Nationalist " case, for the tenants, living rent free, had sunk into the most abject poverty then parish priest went round the south of Ireland begging for them, and the Gleubeigh colliers were as valuable to nationalist orators and writers as a child suffering from some pitiable complaint is to a professional street began the work of carrying on the Government in Ireland in face of the distress caused by the Nationalist movement, and of open resistance to authority stimulated and encouraged by the whole Glad stoman party and their newspapers in England, and by reverend and light reverend members of secret societies in Ireland, is no easy one, notwithstand- ing the large majorities which Lord SALISBURY appeal S to have secured in the British Parliament Our cable messages relate that Queensland has had the nearest escape of not floating" a loan that any Australian colony has experienced for some time back Her proposal was to borrow £2,000,000, at 4 per cent. at par, and the offers made only just covered the amount, and were only just over par, and according to the press statements the banks had to step into avert a failure As usual there nouncement of an Australian loan w is followed by a severe attack in the SI m daul on the borrowing colon) Our London contemporary alleged that the solvency) of Queensland was only maintained by repeated borrowings, and it warned investors to have nothing, to do with the investment accordingly How it comes that the St. indeed should thus play into the hands of the boats" whenever an Australian loan is to be floated is one of the mysteries of the London press, but certain it is that, putting., the articles of our contemporary together a picture is conveyed that Victoria New South Wales, New Zealand South Aus tralia, and Queensland are all getting to the dogs at railway speed No impression could be more fallacious There is a solid future for Australia, and people who know believe that not one of the colonies has more hopeful and more certain prospects than Queensland We have yet to learn particulars, but one obvious explanation of the incident is that too high a minimum was named In January Queensland four per cents were quoted at £100 £101 for retail sales, and yet a minimum of £102 is named for the whole sale transaction The labourer is worthy of his hire It is a missal of to grudge the dealer or the middleman his profit Still we should be disposed to ascribe the episode to some other cause than the usual Standen d commentary Dr JOHNSON once had occasion to dispose of a brewery The incident save us the famous sentence about the artie not being of tubs and oats, but " of the potentiality of amassing woulth.boyonu " the dreams of avarice,"

But when the Messrs GuiNNEss put their brewery upon the market the other day they valued the property at the modest sum of eight millions of pounds, which amount was subscribed fourteen times over

Mr Stagg was in November 1885 defeated for Northwest Manchester Our Adelaide correspondent telegraphs that His Excellency the Governor is about to pay a short visit to South Australia and will arrive at Adelaide by the B.M S Parramatta on Saturday next, probably returning overland on the following Monday or Tuesday His Excellency will be the guest of Sir William Robinson, at Glenelg The damage done by the recent gale at the new Gippsland Lakes entrance was by no means over estimated at first according to the report which Mr 1 Findlay inspector of the Public Works department has furnished as the result of his recent special visit to the works The loss will probably exceed £2 500 and the Minister of Public Works will shortly be called upon to decide v, whether it must be borne by the contractors or by the Government or shared between them The officers of the Public Works department consider that the Government should not be called upon to suffer any loss seeing that it was specially set forth in the conditions of contract that the two rows of piles constituting each of the piers were to be built in cribs or sections and that rubble stone filling was to be put in each crib before the commencement of the pile driving for the next crib Had this course been followed little if any damage would have occurred none of the Tilled cribs having suffered in the slightest degree On the other hand, it is contended that as the inspector of the Public V Works department permitted the pile driving to be continued so far in advance of the stone filling, the Government are to some extent liable Mr Nimmo has decided to pay a visit to the new Lakes entrance and to make a personal investigation so as to enable him to thoroughly understand the question when it comes up for consideration the contractors the officers of the Public Works department and the Minister will confer together on the matter after Mr Nimmo's return to Melbourne The Public Service Board recently insisted on the adoption of a new method of transferring teachers in the service of the education department, on the ground that the eastern previously in vogue was not in accordance with that prescribed in the seventh schedule to the Education Act the classifiers are required by the 62nd section to prepare transfer lists from time to time. I they have hitherto recorded the names on the lists in the order of classification and not according to priority of application It was contended, however, that the former method of preparing the transfer list was illegal the seventh schedule of the act require that transfers shall be made in the order of record The legal interpretation of this is that the names should be recorded in the order of appin, turn and this New is likewise shared by the Premier who holds that the former iiriaiic,cnient was in just to the teachers of the lower grades on the transfer list teachers of higher classified i tion having been able to obtain transfer over their heads The classifiers and officers of the education department consider how ever that the system previously in operation was best calculated to promote the interests of education Although transfer is not regard led is promotion applications for transfer are UBI- illy make it s said to gain advantages that are to the applicants equivalent to promotion and it is urged that the best qualified teacher applying for transfer should have a prior claim for the present however transfers are to be made in the order of record.

It is stated that with the exception of three or four business premises all the buildings in the locality in question have been illegally erected on Crown Linda The work in-, of the drawback branch of the Customs department as recently been raised by the collector of customs (Mr Musgrove) is officially reported as thoroughly satisfactory The difficulty which at first presented itself on account of the delay caused by the new provision of the Drawbacks Act of last session which requires statutory declarations to be made by exporters seeking drawbacks appears to have been overcome by the appointment of several officers of the Customs department as justices of the peace and by the depart- ment linville, agreed to permit accredits 1 agents of business houses to in He the declarations on behalf of their employers before these justices. the most successful feature of the drawbacks branch is the supervision exercised by the two soft too Is experts over gaols intended for exportation The work * performed by them is stated to be characterised by a thoroughness of detail which was absent under the old BJ Hiern and Mr Musgrove is certain that their exertions have already saved the State a considerable sum of money by preventing exorbitant demands for drawback being, made The duties of these officers have been limited to the ni Erection of goods the supervision of the packing being left to subordinates the incorporation of the weighers within the public service is also stated to have enabled Mr Hollick.

The system of education by-law established in Victoria is referred to as being ruinous in its consequences for says the bishop education withoutGod independent' of all religion truly secular in its character teaches men and women to live and die as if Christianity had never existed Bishop Moore speaking to the Catholics of the diocese of Ballarat exhorts them not to admit into their homes newspapers which give offensive details of the divorce courts of this colony infidel and immoral books as many of the novels of the day are pronounced to be also come under his condemnation Bishop Moore expresses his regret that in the interval since his last annual address to his people no change has taken place in the A Octoman Education Act which he describes as a penal law that has so much embittered the minds of the Catholics of this country and has made them discontented subjects of the state the bishop further remarks that the present education system does not satisfy a large portion of non Catholics and that the enormous expenditure which it entails must end in local taxation. The Public Service Association decided in August last to request the Public Service Board to receive a deputation from the association with respect to certain matters of interest to officers of the public service but up to the present time the letter has remained unanswered Considerable irritation has been consequently felt by some members of the association and at the last meeting of that body the matter was pointedly alluded to It has transpired that the letter in question was addressed to Colonel Templeton the chairman of the Public Service Board who regarded it as a communication to himself and not to the Public Service Board Colonel Temple tons colleagues were, however, aware that the letter was received but they dis- claim any responsibility in the matter so that it rests between the association and Colonel Templeton The premises to be erected on the land recently acquired by the Railway department from the Trade Gold mining Company, Ballarat for the accommodation and repair of locomotive engines are to be of a substance in nature The land is at the corner of Corbett and Kid), streets Ballarat, the engine shed will be 25ft long, by 500ft wide Attached to it will be an annexe 78ft by ( Oft, which is intended to be used for repairing purposes The entries will be run into the shed from either end and when in the centre will be placed on turn tables from which they can be backed on to the radial lines carried to all parts of the build use, By this means the whole of the space inside the building will be utilised, provision being;, thus in ide for the accommodation of 60 locomotives.

The Brighton Cup brought out 17 starters Beeswing being established first favourite. The race was a very interesting one the favourite looking like winning till half way up the straight when she was caught by Kohai who defeated her by a head after a fine contest Chucl ster was a good third The annual regatta of the Victorian Rowing Association was carried out on the Albert park Lake on Saturday afternoon One experiment of holding the regatta on the lake instead of on the Saltwater River seemed to be a successful innovation from every point of view. The races throughout were interesting and in some instances very exciting The highly creditable positions taken in the various contests by scullers from Sandhurst and Sydney, and by crews from the Tamar (Launceston) and Warrnambool, added new interest to the contests in which these met the best oarsmen of Melbourne, Geelong, and Ballarat.

The theatre was crowded the members of the brigades sat in the stall seats and their uniforms imparted a very picturesque appearance to that part of the house. The orchestra was occupied by the I Fitzroy District Band, which accompanied the singing of the hymns, under the conductorship of Mr Thomas Tilley After devotional exercises had been led by the Rev G D Buchanan, that gentleman delivered an address on the subject of The Violence of Fire He referred to the antiquity of the system of extinguishing fires which in a crude form existed as far back us civilisation could be traced But although, the quenching of fires had so early and so necessarily received attention, the progress of the invention of apparatus capable of coping with large con migrations had been very slow towards the end of the last century, when the first fire engine was invented to throw a stream of water an inch in diameter to a height of SOft., it was thought that a great deal had been ac- complished After pointing out the extent to which fire brigade organisation in the United States had been perfected, Mr Buchanan passed on to review the qualities that were necessary to make a good fireman and to point out that the same qualities were inestimable in leading a useful and reputable life. The principal of these qualities were v vigilance, zeal, and in rapidity 'The address was brought to a close with the narration of the oft told in cident of John Maynard, the American pilot, who stood at his post at the wheel of a burning vessel until he perished, while all the passengers and crew were saved, as an example of heroism that was entitled to be marked high on the roll of fame the band played Newtons ' In Memoriam, and a collection having been made, and a hymn sung, the Benediction was pronounced Several of the warders at the Pentridge Stockade have lately been charged with sleeping at their posts, some having been discovered asleep by their superior officer I their respective cases are being considered by the Public Service Board, who are calling witnesses from amongst the Pentridge officials One case was so clearly proved that the delinquent has been dismissed, and it is probable that one or two more dismissals will follow The members of the Preston branch of the Fitzroy and Vi littleness Railway League met on Friday evening at the Foresters hall, Preston, for the purpose of forming a deputation to wait on the Railway Commissioners, urging the desirability of the early construction of the line as far as Preston Resolutions to this effect were passed, and the secretary was requested to invite the members of Parliament for the district, as well as the members of the branch leagues, to join in the deputation A strong feeling was expressed against asking the commissioners in any way to make a deviation of the line as at present surveyed, the residents being quite content to have the terminus at North Fitzroy without the extension to Flinders street as claimed by another recently formed league The choir was occupied by Mr Wm Paterson, to whom a vote of thanks was accorded We have been shown at the National Bank of Australasia some large photographs of seven of the banking houses of this city. The originals were enlarged by he London Autotjpe Company from cabinet sized views taken by Foster and Martin, of this city, and were grouped in one large exhibit in the Colonial and Indian exhibition, where, as our London correspondent has told us, they excited general admiration, not merely as examples of this branch of art, but as proofs of the development of civic architecture in the capital of Victoria 'The Associated Banks intend to present this striking exhibit to the Imperial Institute through the Prince of in aid, and it will thus become a permanent attestation of the wealth and solidity of our great financial institutions, which repose upon a basis not less sound, and enjoy a prosperity not less assured in the present, and even more promising in the future, than the oldest and safest in the mother country Nor could anything convey to the eyes of our fellow subjects in Great Britain an impression of this strength and stability more forcibly than this group of enlarged photographs, each of which is no less than 4ft 3in in height, and is as artistic in execution as it is necessarily accurate in detail, allowing for such slight deflections in some of the lines as are occasioned by the curvature of the lens in the camera. As a favourable condition of the atmosphere seems to have been chosen by the operator, the lights and shadows are not too violently contrasted, and the tone is generally harmonious and agreeable The copies just received by the P. and 0 steamer are intended for distribution among the banks According to the French papers, the Prince Imperial left a son behind him, and although it is reported to be the fruit of a secret marriage, such a rumour appears to be generally discredited , but of the child's existence there is no reasonable doubt. On one of the Princes journejBÍrom Chiselhurst to London, there was a young lady with a horn he became suddenly enamoured She was ignorant of his rank, and not displeased with his attentions their acquaintance ripened with the lapse of time and with or without the blessing of the church they eventually lived together as man and wife She was more than once struck by the striking resemblance presented by his face to the photographs of the Prince Im- penal, and remarked it to him but he laughed it off, remarking that others had noticed it too When the time came for him to take his departure for South Africa, he appeared greatly excited but still maintained his incognito, and merely informed his fair companion that he was obliged to leave England for a few months and that he expected it would be the means of opening up a brilliant career for him Nor was it until the news of his death reached London that she discovered who her protector really was In the meantime she gave birth to a son, who has been adopted and is being educated by an English gentleman / c Gaulois supplements theforcgoingparticularsbj the statement that two years ago the child's mother left I noland for Australia, and that she is at this moment keeping a school in Melbourne. The boys parentage is said to be proved by documentary evidence in the possession of his guardian A correspondent of the World, signing himself 'L L , reveals the following secrets as to the latest opera of Mr W. S. Gilbert and Sir Arthur Sullivan -"There is no overture Perhaps there will he though that the piece is in reality a caricature on the old fashioned melodrama, with the virtuous peasant girl, the wicked baronet as., you may take for granted I am not allowed to say I had the surprise will be, but I will tell you that the wicked baronet has to he wicked in consequence of a curse which compete him to commit a crime every day or to die Now, Grossmith, the mild baronet, refuses the title under such conditions and hides himself, leaving Barrington to commit the obligatory crimes He is, however, compelled to take his place, and there in a scene between him and the gallery of his ancestors, which is one of the most original effects known on the stage. The predominant colour of the music is the old English , or instance, the opening chorus of the bridesmaids in gavotte time (L. Hat), and the sailors son a la Dibdin Then come in hornpipe and a madrigal, a sweetly pretty) thing most tastefully invented, with a chaste and gr useful accompaniment. Mr Grossmith s seen and song and the end of the two females belong to that same description the Score continues, moreover, a graceful Bong in waltz time for soprano, a dramatic legend for contralto, a most extraordinary and highly amusing patter trio still very clever double chorus (you Knowbulluun's favourite device officiating two distinct subjects), every tender little duet, a reason, for contralto and baritone, various airs and duets, together no fewer than 21 numbers One of the principal numbers-the principal, in my) humble opinion is the ghost scene above alluded to, serious, solid, the treatment of the orchestra and chorus producing a most weird and solemn effect. I wish to mention a song in three verses, orchestrated in three different ways to give emphasis to the words, in a most vivid manner What will fetch the public is a duet in the second act which you must hear to appreciate it, because to describe its quaintness is not easy. But if there is much serious music and more counterpoint than you would look for in a comic opera there is much of a rollicking character, apparently written in the cruiser ance of PHILLIP spirits.'

The New South Wales Government have received from the agent general some correspondence bearing upon the subject of the destruction of rabbits (reports the Sydney hello) the correspondence includes a letter from Professor Brown, one of the scientific officers of the Agricultural department of the Privy Council, and a letter from Mr James elector, of the Colonial Museum of New Zealand. The following is a portion of Mr Hector's communication -"I think it would be well to ask the agent general to confer with some of the officers of the Canadian Government now in London, with a view of ascertaining what is known as to the nature of a disease that periodically destroy the rabbits in the Canadian backwoods In 1857 8 the Saskatchewan swarmed with rabbits, and the Indians there depended on rabbits largely for their food in the winter time, but during the winter of 1898 9 the rabbits almost entirely disappeared, and I found the backwood Indians stan mg to death in consequence I was told by the hunters and officers of the Hudson Bay Company that about every seven to ten years the rabbits were attacked by a murmur that destroyed them. There was nothing unusual in the severity of the Benson to account for their destruction My impression at the time was that the disease was a fluke or hydatid that attacked the liver, but soon spread to the muscles and other tissues of the rabbit 'J he animals that prey upon the rabbits in that country are the land, the case wolf, the kit fox, and the common for, so that if it is due to the fluke it is probable that it is from one of these animals that the disease is derived " The communication from Professor Brown, of the Privy Council, says -"I beg to inform you that I entertain a strong conviction of the inexpediency of any attempt to introduce a fatal contagious disease among them for the purpose of effecting their destruction In regard to swine fever, it is undoubtedly the case that rabbits may be infected with the disease by innoculation, but there is no evidence of its communicability from rabbit to rabbit by association The same thing may be said of tuberculosis. The introduction of any virulent form of skin disease such as mange or ringworm, would probably aid in the extermination of the rabbits but both diseases are readily communicable to other animals, and the parasite of ringworm might be transferred to man Under the circumstances, I am unable to suggest any measures beyond those which are usually employed, as guns, traps, snares, pitfalls, and the introduction of the smaller carnivora, stoats and weasels have, it , & I BHOMV ' Messrs Dalgety and Company Limited have received information by cable that tenants Tobacco Factory, Virginia, has been totally destroyed by fire, with a very heavy stock A concert will be given by the Metropolitan Liedertafel this evening in the Alexandra 'Theatre Subscribers and friends are particularly requested to take their coupons, and to enter by the doors names on them, and as sufficient ushers will be in at tendance, they are specially urged not to take their seats unattended, in order to avoid errors and annoyance The barrier from the front of the pit will be removed, additional lights will be inserted, and this portion will be called the back stalls The following artists will assist, \ a. -Signora Ciuti, Signorina Rebottaro Signor Lazarus, and Signor Buzzi, and their selections will comprise "Casta Diva,' the 'Shadow Dance " ("Olnorahu), Illuminate Polonaise, bass ma from "Don Carlos, tenor solo, "Mappari tutt amor' ("Martha') duet from "La Traviata " and a concerted selection from " Les Huguenots " The choir of the society will contribute some new part songs and some favourite old ones The orchestra will be led by Mr George Weston His Excellency the Governor has signified his intention of being present on the Melbourne Cricket ground this evening, when the usual weekly fireworks display will be given by Messrs C.
