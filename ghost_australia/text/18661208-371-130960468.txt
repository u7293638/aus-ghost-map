THE MONTHLY POPULAR CONCERTS. TO THE EDITOR. . Sia.— TJ10 -first of -a series of concerts was given ip ,the Town H^ll on Friday, November ifOth, aud I obtained leava frogi His sable Majesty to attend, so j&t; six o'cloc^, .after having put on. sufficient brlins tone to 1 a«t all nighfTl put«the l8addl&.on a'nice little -fiery, dragon, and topk tfee road to thsK^Tti^rp .^-dl, Arnving t^er^ at holf-p$st_s$y«n. \- 'The Itail yas jcomfor^ply .^Ued, ^qjb I managed tp get a seat in - front, and waited^ patiently nntil just after eight, when the, mscninjen taiia ts pounaed on aa irsnjUj su ot % lump, anyhow. * * Mr. Lpder ne^ct came forward ^-1 appjogised ' for it'. T: HeydeCke, who wa^ ta^ep .sudjLmly ill, anisouiU n^ot p-ttend- ' ^ j , /Phe otohestra then pevfortped the pverture Ip ' QJ:efcn' in very .cnuditable manner.; te gpiy thing th^t annoyed me was that tBey seeined anxiOUB-to gec in^ft^t?/ii»u th^ fiddlers kept jmshing one another about until I thought thexe would be a row. Madame Wienbarg was put to sin» the first solo, and she managed to get thiough it some hc~, Vat sae,T7iis no? perfection; from t-ie amount of talk there was about this great Prima Donna from Germany, I expected some ; thing grand, but;! did not see the grand part. Mrs. G. Loder. then sang 'Softly sighs the. voice rf evening,' -from '^Der ^Freiscjiutz,''. and catjed Jpn^l plaudits from .the au^i^nce^ .she did it very juce^y, $nd deserved all the ^.pplanse^shd got. A duet followed, by Ma4ame ~Wie#$axg and -Mr. L-Jder, ' Come, be gay, and hanish sorrow,' also 'from '? Der Fseischuts.' This Was .very well sung, excepting that Madame's voice was not quite powerful enough for Mrs. Lbder's. Next eame a ? *? (band Concert -Stuck',' com posed by 3ir. G. Loder. This ,was performed by ^Ir.^Loder! ^ssistdd by the -ccchestsa/it was1 sC fine piece of i*fteic certainly, but it was far too long, aBd oecskme vesy tinesome; as it was .the last pieoeaa the first piwt. I ^left - before it was 9 *??» anl ^ou^ied to :the Hot^l ^or refreshments. - ? On my retniiu the band were wading .'Qupngh another overture. . The next on tbe'list was -a grand sir -from ' Martha,' by Mr. T. Lake , a gentleman amateur, and of all singing I ever heard, it was about the worsts The geptlemari . p^ sesses ne^t'ier ?-grle, voica, po^r,' art, or - anything else,' the ? sound that did issue from -his. month ^eejued to be pro3hiee tjby'a series of convulsions. I should advise him to retire to soma lonely ^valley, -where he could sing to the bajbbling brook, and then 'he would have to. get very -elose, or else the b~c -k wojitd not kQpw what he was-jsinging about Madsiiive -Wienftirg essayed' another -sang, ?^wi- h little better success than the first. .The. ne%f was a fantasia on the corneta p'ston, by Herr Schrader ; this was dons with . jgreat e?^e and precision. Mr.l James Stratton Scotland, fssay^d tosing one of Sims Bee^es's great songs ..v Coma into the gvdeiu Ma-id^;' this gentlemen -can't sing, 'never could sing.- and never Will able to sing. so I^hou{d-advise--him tp p^rtjiKe a. pis can, and take his stand optside the Town Hall, in the; street, where his shrill cry might be beard - tp .aiv^nt^e, .hts .sluyle iwoulcf just suit Pies.B$-y.' pies all-«t ? Mrs. -Loder «iext:s^ag ' Oh, 'joyous happy ?day ' v^ry prettily. ,sjtd .was [loudly encored, sb at Reserved it. The .second part, conckided with a polka by the bftttd, andj the -third part, opened -with a cr%nd ;** Masonic Waltz.' composed by Mr. Loder. -I-did not see anyrhins? beautiful in it.' TheitjSC*'- Scotland had to show -himself in a Scotch ballad ' Flowers of the Forest.' and 1 from the general style of hi ji, I should think he f had ? been something of the ballad - singer : in his yonng day. Mrs. Loder made up'for his failure to some extent with ' Barney O'Hea,' for she sung, it : in .proper style, and was. again encored. i y Mr. G fappin then made' .His deb,ufc in the good old song. «iThe Ivy $reen. but he had not sufficient power t-- g}l*. the Hail ; this may^be accounted for^y some-extent, from the fact of his having; Wn placing a ,wjnjd iostrox] ment7thr6ngtiootthe;e»etiing. ] _.
