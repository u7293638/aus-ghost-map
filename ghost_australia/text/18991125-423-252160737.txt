Harry Deeper Again. The Orange real live man is well on the warpath with his projected band benefit entertainments, but we're afraid Mr. Deeper is one of those men who will have to die before he is appreciated. No doubt his ghost will have the pleasure of sitting on a bronze or Caleula marble statue some day; but it's present day assistance he is looking for,. and considering the broad scheme he has in hand, the good of the town, not of the individual only, we sincerely hope the town will support him.
