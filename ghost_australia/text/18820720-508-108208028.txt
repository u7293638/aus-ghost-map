In our issue of yesterday Ifc was unavoidably stated that Mr; John Cristy, licensee of theOamQlifc Grove Hotel, Alexandra, was ohsrgeiS \cSth EfeBinf ? liquor to an intoxicated person. The ottarffe «s* f erred against Mr. Cristy was that he allowed ais house to be Conducted by an unlicensed person. As it appeared that the case arose through &misttn.d;«v standing on Mr. Crifity'e part, who, it Seems, thought he could conduct his business by deputy; a prfvflege which he believed to be t enjoyed by others in th« trade, the case was dismissed. The charge against Mr. Dunks, also mentioned in the same, paragraph, was of a precisely similar* nature* eaidjiot for selling drink to a person already tinder tiie inflnenco oi in . toxicants. Patrick Buston, for being drnnk and diEorderly and assaulting the police, was this morning .brought, up in custody at the Central Police Cteurt, and fine*, in the aggregate £2 10s. or in default of patiaant nine days' imprisonment.

Deteotive Williams this morning received a ''valentine.' It was quite a work of act, eKowing a- dirty, black coffin, a tombstone, and at the foot* kneeling and weeping, a woman clothed in white.

Prom & friend I' This has given Williams quite a fit of the chcorf uls. It was stated by some 6£. the speakers atyesterV day's meeting that neither firskclass meat nor bread was expected to be delivered by the contractors to our benevolent institutions*. Exception, however, was taken to this ty other members of the board. I Two sheep lately delivered whole at the Bandwick Institute weighed between them 651b. . The amount of meat eaten weekly at this institution is 270GIhj and bread about 336 loaves a day. 16 was etated that there was no real ' prime' meat in the market of late. We should think not. The meat supplied of late to the Esnflwit* Insti tute is said to be worse than any refuse that could be found in Paddy's Market, lok Grahame, yester day, mentioned the word' robbery 'in connection with this matter, but afterwards withdrew it .Among the. duties of thd -slork and storekeeper at the Eandwick Asylum are iho following t — To fie* that all goods received from the contractors and others are of the stipulated quantity and quality, and ' that they are delivered in accordance with the terms of the contract, if not, the matter to be at {once re ported to the superintendent. According to the statement of Mr. liVi&sfci; the clerk and contractor at the Bandwick Asylum, not an official in that institution dare call their bouI their owny-except the superintendent. Tney are of opinion that the slightest complaint would lead to their instant dismissal. The inquiry of yesterday will consequently ease their mind.
