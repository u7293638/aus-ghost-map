A Qho't in a Copper Mine. It is very seldom in this advanced anil en lightened age that the fcard of man can be excited by the imagined prusuuee of a auper natural being in the locality of their labors to such an extent as to almost cause a panic. But ftom a report which has been tele graphed from B.ayney it would seem that some consternation haa been caused amongst the men at the cocnor mine by the visita tions of a ghost in one of the shafts. The men, they say, hear strange noises, bolls ringing, sighing, groanings, etc, and the miners on going below have their candles extinguished by a supernatural visitor, and some even allege that something occasion ally brushos p.; -t them. The excitement has inspired six of tlic men to such a degree of terror that they have picked up their kits and left. Evidently a current of air pass ing through the workings has been playing a practical joke.
