I watched with or eyes nea-Iy starting from their sockets and my hand* clutching the window Bash. Wm it the final confir mation of that Tiiim ? Was it ' Oh. you are ill! Come, lie on the bed while I do something for you?* I looked into the anriflfas eyes of my wife end my senses cam* back to me. I put her mind at test by assuring her that I wu not ill, but had bran attacked by my old enemy, insomnia, and had been compelled to pus a portion of the night vwy miserably. Thereupon, by assuring her faithfully thit X would consult a physician, Bessie dressed .nd busiedhemelf about h£r household duties. At brrakfait Leo sat dowijso much refreshed from his walk and paitt^c so heartily of the food before him th**. mrheart almost chided me for the fear of the night. It was only in the bosom of my home and surrounded by the happiness of my f«mUy circle, that I ap proached to a disavowal W my presentiment. Alone in my den of an office, I accepted with two-fold fo ce tftfs final vision. I laid it. up in my heart as tbe inevitable, a :d resolved never to mention it to anyone. If it must come, mine should be the only' sorrow of anticipation. I would watch Leo, defend him as I could and hope for the best. The night following my vision he did not return to the house, nor the next, but he same to my offioe oft the afternoon of the third day with livid lips, pale cheeks Mid eyes that fairly buried in their intensity. 'Where in the world have you been?' I cried, observing with no little anxiety his ap pearance and his constained manner. * Nowhere in particular,* he answered evasively. ' About town attending to some buoinese affaire, and *ny time was so taken up that Xtfound it inconvenient to return to the hoofli. They had not worried about me?' I threw a strong accent on the two last words and looked him full in the face. He stood the look for a moment and then gave a petulant cough and turned hwH, ' Of oourae you know that lam old enough to take care of myself. A woman r»nn"t I realise this, sometimes.' * A man is never-old enough, nor wise enough. to shield himself against his fate/ 'Perhapsnot. But age and wisdom will teach him how to make his fate the brighest; how to mould hie life so fortune will have I nothing in store for him hot good things.' I nodded emphatically. * But/ said T, * both age acd wisdom are made the fool* of pawisn A mui w«th all the years of Hethusaieh and all tt>e know ledge of Solomon is as powerless again «t love as a babe in arms.' I felt that I hid made a good point. Then,, replied t oo, * it is useless to com bat lore, no matter how u'worthily placed, ?Knee it is such a conqueror of men!' * Fly from it. Flight is the only If a man loves, if you love, an unworthy peion, go abroad and sink all iwaemb- ance of the past in the sights and scenes of foreign countries.'. He smileg indulgently. * By the law you ha*e laid down it is impos sible for the wiaect patriarch to thield l»fa from life. Then what avails a flight? It only serves to show the man an arrant cowaad.* * ® eaves an unhappy union. It muifin you to forget-' "Sever/ he interrupted in 'a sad voice. ' Memoiy and the ghost of love are twin leeches at the heart of one who loves in vain. * 'I would mther have an tmhaoov maniam timnsuffer and dia of heartbreak.
