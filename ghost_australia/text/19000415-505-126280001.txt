0UE TELEPHONE, Hello ! The Right Hon. G. H. BeH^ pleaae. . i . - . Ri'toh ! .'..= ' Hello, Mr. Reid ! A few -words TBifli you. Now, now ! Can't you let me rest tor a bit ? Rattle up the other chaps, the men Who've got ofiice — and the pay ! It is not good that you ehonld shzmbar would speak with you of the Federal Capital site. Oh, lor1 ! Will that spectre ever haunt ' . ; ' me ? Can't it be laid ? : ; Not just now, we are afraid. It will appear against you . at the Federal Elec tions ? u- Oh ! And even in the dim and distant fotura will, no douht, bob up at intervals to coa-« ? found you ! ^ '?' Confound it ! Having at the Conference in MeJboorne1 made the initial error of allowing Sydney to ~-- '?'?'? be 'barred,' and the Capital fixed at some ? spot 'not less than one hundred miles from Sydney ? ' « - Oh, come off ! ? .- Having been trapped into selling Sydaiey'a ?- -. ? birthright, so to speak, it is rather sur- ???-;?. prising it did not occur to you to make a stipulation . that'trouM at least have got this ' ? colony the Capital well inside Its territory, . ;: instead of (as appears likely) on the border, and nearer' Melbourne than Sydney. Are you listening ? ; . - Oh, yes ! . . Thought you might have fallen asleep again.' -? ? : ? -\': Oh, I heard right enough. But what was \'' ' ' '? the way out that I might have taken, and saved myself from this frightful Federal Capital ghost that gives me no peace ? ? . Well, it wouldn't altogether have saved ? you, but it would have been some set-off,, at any rate, to the 'barring' of Sydney. You admit, of course, that as the agreement now stands Victoria and her friends can pull the Capital nearer Melbourne than. Sydney ? ' . : Yes, yes ; I can't deny that ! ' . That is, when the Capital leaves Mel» : bourne ! - ' Yes ; when it leaves Melbourne — if it eveji dOC3 ! : . ', ' . ' -. What's that? Did you say if it evec doe3 ? No; the telephone's. -buzz.. Buzz — yoa ? .. ??: know; that's -what I was talking about. ?' When will they fix up that new swifcli- T '? board! A-h--h-! ' ? - ? Sighs are of 'no avail ! ' ': I know ! I know— alas ! But tell me what I might have done to have lightened my burden a bit. . ,, . - Well, when they hocussed you, and got you to agree that the Capital should not bo - within 100 miles of Sydney, you should hava ' '' ? ~ said : 'Well, gentlemen, if I must I must - bat, of course, you will allow the choice oi -.the Federal Capital site to be decided by New South Wales (as it is to be in he* territory) acting on -her own ! '? ' ' I see it now : ? And, of course, if that had been conceded there would be no delay, in fixing the Capital ; Melbourne would nop - hold it for so long as under present condi* tions ! . Quite so ! The Federal Parliament (antf not N.S.W.) now has to decide, and havin* got settled at Melbourne, they wall be in aa hurry to shift. When they do, Victoria sji£' - friends are strong enough to vote the Capi* tal nearer Melbourne than Sydney, and thm - ?Melbourne will continue to benefit Ah, if I could only live that period ovei again ! - Yes ; it will probably pan out rather mJ fortunately for you politically, and when you die ? ^~^ Eh ? It will be for Victoria tn oi- or.t -.' .-*~.t™ ' to you ! ? ?******, Ting, ting.
