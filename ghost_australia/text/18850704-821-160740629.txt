TO CORRESPONDENTS. " Dead Heat**—If two men ran a dead beat they divide the first and second prizes in the event of not running off ; sill should they run off the winner takes the first prize and the other man the second. " B. S."—In the Sheffeld Handicap the men are handicapped considerably under the stipulated distance, and we do not know of an instance where anybody has been put behind scratch. " Smoker."—The Ghost now running in Mel bourne is not the horse bred by Mr. Harvey. The Ghost (late Salisbury) was by Tregeagle out of Ada (not the dam of Newatead). " Robert Bossiter."—The Bed Lancer which won the trot is not identical with the steeplechaser of that name. Mr. Watson bought him in Melbourne in May. !
