either by the Assembly or the Council The law officers arc with the Attorney General on this point and recog niBe in the clause a special appropriation Lut tho great question waa that remitted home by Mr Berrys memorandum 31st December 1877, whether the Governoi is justified in signing warrants on the vote of the Lower House alone And the Imperial law officers have endorsed tho position of the Council by affirming that the Governor cannot sign such warrants and that the as Bent of the two HOUBCB of tho Legislature, tho Council and the Assembly is required to make a legal appropriation of the annual votes The customary reservations aro made, to the effect that the Executive has power to meet cases of emergency, in which its action would be sure to commend itself to the ap proxal of tho Parliament The right of the Council to a financial veto is now established by the authorities to whom Ministers and tho Governor appealed The Secretary of State points out that the Ministerial memo

' The present as peet of settlement in those localities (visited by the commission) is that of per mnnency^ but it is doubtful if this will con ticiue to be the case, in consequence of the pecuniary emb irrnssments m which a con siderable number of the selectors are in volved This view of the mattet leads at once to the second branch of the commission a in ouiry, viz , the difficulties of the selectors Generally Bpeakmg the bona lulen of the p-tat majority of the selectors in taking up landlfor settlement does not admit of doubt, but the neceasit) of carrying out within the Íirescnbed time tho improvements on their and which the law requires has involved them m debt, and the drought of the last two seasons has proved so fatal to their crops and their live stock, that they have got little .r no returns from their land to enable them to meet their liabilities The conae pience is that at tho present time many of them con tmue to bo rather deeply in debt to the hanks, to money lending agents, and to storekeepers , and there is much danger that a considerable number of these indebted selectors will not be able ultimately to dis charge their pecuniary obligations In th it case they will lose their land which will thus fall into the hands of their creditors, and pass from these into thcnossosBion of persons -who apply themselves to aggregate extensive areas of land in the form of large private estates. In this way the wiso and beneficent policy of the state, namely, to settle a nume rous yeoman class upon the soil, it is to be feared, will be in a great measure frustrated, and the state will lose both its property in the land and the consideration for which that property was parted with, namely, a settled agricultural population, unless some means be devised for averting this calamity The primary cause of this unfortunate state of things is the very limited capital-some times the absence of capital-with winch selectors enter upon their holdings combined with what is, under auch circumstances, the burdensome character of the conditions of settlement imposed by the Land Act The commission proceed to specif) the remedies or amendments m the land law that the) re commend Under the existing law selectors have a licence for the first three }ears of their occupation, under which they pay to the state 2s per acre per annum, which goes towards the purchase money Ihe unvarying price per acre paid to the state bj selectors being £1, it follows tint at the end of the three j cars, they hav e paid tis per acre, and owe Hs per acre more Under the pre sent law thej tan, if the) have fulfilled the conditions of their licence, demand at the expiration thereof either a Crown grant on payment of the remainder of the purchase money m a lump sum or a seven )ears lease If they choose the latter, they still go on paj ng to the state 2s per acre for the term of the lease, and when it expires they will have paid 2a per acre per annum foi 10 years, or ti per acre, and they are then entitled to the Crown grant without further payment The commission recommend that the period of licence be extended from three to six ) ears If that recommendation be adopted the selectors w ill be relieved to this extent, that they will hav o BIX years instead of three to fulfil the stipulated improvements to the value of ti an acre, and instead of having to pay the state 2s per acre per annum during the first three years they will only have to pay is Under the present law a selector is compelled to rcBide on his selection during the three jearB of the licence, but the com mission recommend a sy stem of registration wider which the selector would bo enabled to absent himself occasionally for a fe« montbB from bia holding without incurring the risk of its forfeiture That system would enable selectors to carn money outside their holdings Again, one of the conditions of the licence is the cultivation of ono acre in every ten As profitable agriculture is im possible m some cases, owing to pecu liantics of soil or climate, tho commission retommend that tho selector bo allowed to act on his own judgment as to whether he should cultivate for agricultural crops or apply his land to grazing purposes As to the term of lease, the commission advise that it be ex tended from seven j ears to 14, in which event the amount payable during its cur rency would be Is per aero per annum instead of 2s In thickly w ooded districts, wbero tho forest is dense, the commis «ion aro in favour of selectors being allowed to hold land at a nominal rent for three years before the begin nmg of the period of licence As to auch lands, the commission furthermore recommend that non resident selectors bo allowed to take them up-in other words, that the residence conditions be waned in such exceptional localities They think, how ever, that non resident selectors should pay a higher price for their land, and put £2 Tv,, "nprovements thereon instead of only £1 worth On the question of financia aid trom the Government to tho selectors the commission state -Of the many thousand selectors in the various districts of the country who are now struggling to make Homes for themselves, considerable numbers \--probably one third-are in danger of losing tlicir lands from inability to pa) their debts A traction under one fifth of the entire num »er of lessees under the preaent act have already put their homesteads m jeopardy by mortgage, and the area thus imperilled is Just Bhort of one fourth of the total number oi acres leased under tho act With regard to the grants issued under the present act, about one third of the entire freehold area «as airead) passed, or is in course of passing, out oi the hands of the original selectors, "nu tho proportion which these traffickers in tlic public lands bear to the whole num uer of grantees is a little less than one third, being 1 474 out of 4,880 Wo w ill now proceed with the commissioners' own wortiB - As matters now stand, the state ?s Muna to tako some Bteps to pre .Äi rfc?e.arfa,a o£ selected land, now bur in li^'e11 debt' from falll"S "»to hands Sîmiîf h."

mortgagee and speculative moneylender, it would give him time to pay off his debt by easy instalments, it would save his portion of the public lands from going to swell the overgrown estates of land monopolista, and the security offered for the accommodation would be the very best, namely, the selectors own lease and title, which in the event of the selector s failure or default, would revert to the state, and bring back igaiu into the public domain the for feited lund By tins means, tina forfeited lund, instead ot being sei/ecl by the private mortgagee and lost to agricultural settle ment,

capital to enter upon an undcitakmg whollj unjustified by the means at their command ' It is their opinion that alienation in fee simple should cease, at least for the present, or, if it ia allowed to continue, that the Btate should not be content with the £1 per acre all round, but should have the lands classified, and make the best possible bargain for them We have simply epitomised the Commissioners' report, and have not repeated objections that have been urged against portions ofitby various writers Some of their suggestions have been embodied by the Government m an Amending Land

ATROCIOUS MURDERS OF POLICE. Considerable sensation has been caused by a murderous attack upon a party of police at Stringybark Creek, near Mansfield. A few months ago Constable Fitzpatrick endea- voured to arrest a young criminal named Daniel Kelly, at Greta, on a charge of horse- stealing. The capture had been effected but a rescue was made by the prisoner’s brother, Edward Kelly, who shot the constable in the wrist. The two Kellys, for whom a reward was offered, have since been at large in the ranges forning the water- shed of the King and Broken Rivers. They appear to have been joined by two confederates, whose names are unknown. Two parties of mounted police were recently despatched in search of them. One of them, numbering four men—Sergeant Kennedy, and Constables Scanlan, Lonigan, and M‘Intyre — camped on Saturday last at Stringybark Creek. No special precautions were thought necessary, because the party supposed they were a long way from Kelly’s whereabouts. About 6 a.m. on Saturday, Kennedy and Scanlon went down the creek to explore, and they stayed away nearly all day. It was M‘Intyre’s duty to cook, and he attended closely to camp duty. During the forenoon some noise was heard, and M‘Intyre went out to have a look, but found nothing. He fired two shots out of his gun at a pair of parrots. This gunshot, he subsequently learned, was heard by Kelly, who must have been on the look- out for the police. About 5 p.m. M‘Intyre was at the fire making the afternoon tea, and Lonigan with him, when they were suddenly surprised with the cry, “ Bail up ; throw up your arms.” They looked up, and saw four armed men close to them. Three carried guns, and Edward Kelly two rifles. Two of the men they did not know, but the fourth was the younger Kelly. The four were on foot. They had approached up the rises, and some flags or rushes had provided them with excellent cover until they got into the camp. M‘Intyre had left his revolver at the tent door, and was totally unarmed. He, there- fore, held up his hands as directed, and faced round. Lonigan started for shelter behind a tree, and at the same time put his hand upon his revolver. But before he had moved two paces Edward Kelly shot him in the temple. He fell at once, and died in a few seconds. Kelly had M‘Intyre searched, und when they found he was unarmed, they let him drop his hands. The men helped themselves to several articles. Kelly talked to M‘Intyre. It was evident that he knew the exact state of the camp, the number of the men, and the descrip- tion of the horses. He asked where the other two were, and said he would put a hole through M‘Intyre if he told a lie. M‘Intyre told him who the two absent men were, and hoped they would not be shot in cold blood. Kelly replied, “ No, I am not a coward. I’ll shoot no man if he holds up his hands.” He told M‘Intyre that the best thing he could do was to advise Kennedy and Scanlan to surrender, for if they showed fight or tried to run away they would be shot. M‘Intyre asked what they would do if he induced his comrades to surrender. Kelly said he would detain them all night, as he wanted a sleep, and let them go next morning without their arms or their horses. M‘Intyre told Kelly that he would induce his comrades to surrender if he would keep his word, but he would rather he shot a thousand times than sell them. He added that one of the two was father of a large family. Kelly said, “ You can depend on us.” Kelly then caught sound of the approach of Kennedy and Scanlan, and the four men concealed themselves, some behind logs, and one in the tent. They made M‘Intyre sit on a log, and Kelly said, “ Mind, I have a rifle for you if you give any alarm.” Kennedy and Scanlan rode into the camp. M‘Intyre went forward, and said, “ Sergeant, I think you had better dismount and sur- render, as you are surrounded.” Kelly at the same time called out, “ Put up your hands.” Kennedy appeared to think it was Lonigan who called out, and that a jest was intended, for he smiled, and put his hand on his re- volver case. He was instantly fired at, but not hit, and Kennedy then realised the hope- lessness of his position, jumped off his horse, and said, “ It’s all right, stop firing.” Scanlan jumped down, and tried to make for a tree, but before he could unsling his rifle, he was shot down, and never spoke. A number of shots were fired. M‘Intyre believing that the men intended to shoot the whole of the party, jumped on Kennedy’s horse, and dashed down the creek. Several shots were fired, but none reached him. His horse, how- ever, was wounded, and after riding a short distance, he had to abandon the animal. He made his way across country to Mansfield, where he arrived on Sunday afternoon. A search party, consist- ing of police and volunteers, at once went out, and recovered the bodies of Scanlan and Lonigan ; but Kennedy was not to be found, nor could any trace of him be discovered. The search w is subsequently renewed with a like result. It is impossible to say what his fate may have been, but while the worst is feared, it is yet thought that the ruffians may only be detaining him as prisoner. Active steps have been taken for the pursuit and capture of the criminals. A large num- ber of police have been despatched to the district, and Superintendent Nicolson has gone up from Melbourne to direct the opera- tions. The task will be one of no ordinary difficulty, for the country, though familiar to the gang, is of an inaccessible nature. They are also known to have friends and con- nexions, probably confederates also, in the mountains, who may communicate to them the movements of the police, and so enable them to avoid discovery for a time A syste- matic pursuit, however, must ultimately result in their capture or destruction, and no effort will be spared to run them down. _____________________________________ THE REVENUE RETURNS 1 he rex enue returns for the quarter endi September 30 have been issued by the Tri sury The total rev enue for the quarter w £1,107,423 17s 7d , showing an increase ov tho corresponding quarter of last year £09,219 5s 5d Upon the 12 months endi September 30,1878, there was an increase, compared with tho previous 12 months, £03,883 6B lOd 'I his apparently satisfactc result, howcv er, vanishes upon investigate for the w hole increase ia considerably mc than accounted for by one item-the retur from the land tax The amount recen from this tax during the past quarter w tl0á,G83 Gs 9d , making the total amou received from this source £153,909 18a 6 Via find that in the Customs reven the past quarter shows a decrease i the corresponding quarter of the pi nous j ear of £ the year of £151,547 17s 8d The decrea on the year has to be reduced to Borne exte by an allowance for wharfage rates trail ferred to the Harbour 'Iruat, and noto li also to be taken of the remissions of du made last session Upon the other hand, ti new dutieB imposed have to be allowed for the Ino Btock and timber duties '1 he decrea on the j cai upon the Customs lev enue may I estimated at about £100 000 The tw o quarte can be compared more closely togethc Upon the following items the revenue hi füllen off -Spirits, £">,57r>, wine, £1,191 tobacco and snuff, £d,122, coffee, opiut rice, malt, dried fruitB, £4,332 , ad valora £17,929, all other articles, £24,482 Upc the two last items allowance muet be mai for remission of duties 'lhere has been » increase of revenue upon beer, £049 , cigar £98S, tea, £2,590, sugar, £3,777, hop £1,277, live Btock, £5,722, wharfago rate £5,407 , and the export duty on timbe £147 The laBt three items cannot 1 taken as legitimate increases on ti quarter of tho previous year The atoe tax was in operation only half the 183 quarter, the wharfage rates do not repr sent au actual increase of revenue, an tho redgum duty was not m force in 1877 i all The net result shows a decrease on til quarter of quite £30,000 On excise and u land rev enue an increase l8 show n on ti: quarter of i92,()84 1(JB 4d , an increase, as w have said, more than accounted for by ti: land tax 1 here is a docrease in the rev enti from succession duties of £12,218 13a 8i Ihe territorial revenue shows an increase < £4,274 13s Gd Auction sales show an ii creobe of £2,838, and receipts towards ti purchase of lands and rents and licence £9,3J3 From pastoral rents there is a redui tion of £7,072 The Public Works give a increase of £10,400, of which £8,041 is due t the railways, and £1,082 to the Yan Year There are now 104 miles of railway ope more than in 1877 The tonnage dues shoi n falling off of £1,003 18s Tho result of close investigation of the returnB shows, m stead of a nominal increase on the quarte of £09,219, an actual deficiency of full, £30,000 _ GOLD AND THE GOLDFIELDS After Bome}ears of dulness, there aroman;

At Sandhurst great confidence IB expressed, as many of the companies which have been long prospecting have reached good stone, and there is every reason to believe that the coming year will Bhow that " Old Bendigo ' has a large reserv e of fresh resources Stawell )8 also confident, though sundry problem» there respecting the payable nature of quartz reefs at great depths aro a long timo being BOIVed The future of that district may bo regarded tis secure, and it may possibly he more brilliant than even the sanguino sup pose In other districts there are also signs of improvement and increased energy, ns if a cloud was passing away and the sun waa about to alune at last. It appears to be cer tam that many of our best miners havo left the colon), and the rising generation does not seem to take very kmdl) to,tho industry, so that should the indications prove to havo been rightly interpreted, there is likely to be a demand for tina kind of work It can only be hoped that the demand will prove to be sufficient to attract back Bomo of those who have left the colon),vvhoinny get higherwages, but cannot lend a verj pleasant life in the heat ni),!

failures which has occurred 111 Great Britain for many years past, that of the City of Glasgow Bank with habt hties amounting to over £10 000 000, and the fact that it was stated to have had close and intimate business relations with Australia and New Zealand gave rise to some fears that we should be sufferers hap pil) twithout any ground, as we are assured that no complications are likely to arise in the colonies other than those incidental to so sudden and important a derangement of fiiiunual affairs in England Nor, as far as we can yet learn, are we likely to bo much affected here by the collapse of so many extensive buameaa firms which has followed thereon The astounding nature of the charges brought igainst the directors and officers of the bank has been severely commented on, as well it might in face of the amount of suffering mid sorrow winch has thus been brought upon so many thousands of helpless and innocent individuals The opening wool sale of the season, alwa) s an important event in these colonies, was held on Wednesday, the 10th inst, at Messrs R Goldsbrough and Co s w ool warehouses, and their large saleroom was crowded to excess Lnghah, Scotch, Continental, and American firms being well reprcaented, m addition to the colonial bu}ers The biddings com menced w lth spirit, and vv ere well maintained, the prices obtained being about equal to those realised at the opening Bale last}ear The catalogue comprised l,8o7 bales grea3) and scoured, and good average greasy ranged up to ll|d per lu Other lots ruled in propor tion and the sale passed off well In all 1 009 bales w ere disposed of that day at auction Since then mimerons public sales have been held, and about 20,000 bales alto gether have been cleared off, and prices have been realised which could scarcely be ex Eected m the present unsettled state of the ome market and European affairs gene rally Rather an amusing correspondence haB found its way to the public press with respect to the best colonial market for vv ool Sydney or Melbourne-which the increased facilities for conveying wool to Sydney through the opening up of new lines of rail way have given rise to, but it is very clear that while homo and foreign bujcr1" enn tinue to come forward hero to operate m Melbourne no market in the colo nies can equal ours, and hitherto that is a peculiarity which Victoria hoB made her ow n Mining matters aro a¿am looking up, and the evidences of this are as profitable as they ought to be satisfactory Some magnificent specimens of auriferous quartz were exhibited a short while ago in Collins street 'Ihey were from the claim of the Queens Birthday Company, Dunolly, and w ere remarkable not only on account of their richness, but also because the gold was shown in a solid form and in fantastic shapes on the surface The colour of the gold was as rich as if it had been smelted, andal together the appearance of the specimens was most attrac tive They were met with 111 the main lode at the 300ft level, in the ordinary course of working, and were about to be sent to the battery, but the manager was prevailed upon to send them to town for the inspection of the Melbourne shareholders This company, though it has paid during the last 12 months £78,000 in dividends to its shareholders, was at one time reduced to so low an ebb as to be unable to get credit for £10 y, orth
