'Tfie old gentleman was never inore amusing,' said Eoohford, as I parjied from him; in the hall. I^When, we mdve, Beatrice,1 I'll ask him to come to Ashmead; the change would do him good.' ' . ; ;' Ask him,- by \all means,' said I, i' and I will second your entreaties. If we can once break the chain of reoui'ring events iii his life we may give him another lease of it. Our intrusion, unwelcome though it ^yas at first, has already roused him into something like gaiety. Miss Rochr ford should be well enough in a fortnight to be moved, for her case looks in every way favourable.' j 'How can I ever repay you for your kindness ?' said Eoohford. .1 knew .; a method by which he could repay me a thousandfold, but I didnot think it wise to mention it at' that moment. Alas! events soon occurred which rendered it impossible for me to ever ask that favour which I prized so highly. On Wednesday afternoon, Major Molineux begged to see me alone. He led the way to his library, carefully closed the door, and; after much prelude, began to talk about his malady. . ' '*' I wish to ask you,' said' he, 'if it is possible for a man to be mad and know that he is mad?' ' There are different kinds of madness,' said I, feeling that I must speak with caution. 'An in sane rilan may have lucid intervals; during which he reviews acts done during the period of his insanity, and condemns them. A man may have an uncontrollable impulse to commit a certain act — as to jump out of a window, for instance-1— and yet be quite conscious of the folly, and even wickedness, of his morbid promptings: I knew a case in India of a ^oldier who was seized TTri+l-i 4iio+ aii/tl-k a m/wlxlA /laaiva 1YJ.UU JUOU OtAViA « , AJAWJUIk/AU. UOOUUi He felt compelled to murder some one very near and dear to him, and at' last deserted in order to do it. Arrived in the town where the ntended victim livedi he atbsolutely had himself tied up by the people of the inn, until the proper authori ties could be sent for to secure him;. Some months afterwards ihebbj ebi of his morbrd'lust' for' blood died, and the man at once recovered. He describes his sufferings while resisting his impulse as terrible.' Surely no devil worse than this could possess a man. And yet he. could hardly be called mad.' ' You give me a few grains of comfort,' said Major Molineux, 'though I, have no such fearful impulse as that which you describe. Every week, from ten o'clock on 1 IT CUUCDUajf UlgUU UliUU UUU \J %JA\J*JX± on -Friday morning, I am the prey to the most bestial and' awful delu sion which it has entered into the mind of man to conceive.
