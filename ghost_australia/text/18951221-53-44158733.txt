"It is hard to say . more." "Yes, indeed. Even I think that is sufficiently crushing.

"No; I can't say you've improved, Jack," she said suddenly. "I'msorry, but I can't." " Perhaps there wasn't room ?" I sug- gested modestly. 'fOh, jes, there washhouses of room. There always ÍB. ' . . in men. I think itt your tie or your moustache, or something. Anyway, you look.quite different." " I'm sorry," I murmured. . " Yes ; it might have been a different sort of différence," she agreed. A shade of pensiveness crossed her face. It passed as the silver trail of a falling stai passes from the blue. - \---.{ : V lf you've done stirring up that old eui " of tea we will go upstairs," sha said.

She pulled ber skirt from her knees and ran ahead of me up the crazy stairs to the top »torey of the house. Outside tte cur- tained door of her room she stopped to «how me, throngh a little window, the beauties of the outlying country : the wonder of the changing river ; the gorgeous variety of tints in the universal green of the trees and t(ra»s; the homely beauty of tbe meek, red roofed houses, and the pale glory of the dim sky. ?'- | "It is claimed for many men that they ! discovered tiie earth," said the little lady. . " That is wrong. They only found it. The. honor of its discovery is with the artists." We wenV into her room, a large apart- ment lighted from above. A modest little l>ed was in a corner, squeeze i away into the mirk ss if rest had but a Bonall part in the; life of its owner. At the head of the bed was a small mirror and other toilette accessories on a white-draped dressing tible ; at its foot stood a desi washstand. In the centre of the rcom sprawled a great yellow 1 easel bearing a canvas. There were other en sels and canvases distributed throughout the'room, and plaster casts and lay figures, all tho usual paraphernalia of the painter's craft added. The little lady snatehrd do^n the large I canvas from the great yellow easel and stood \ it withita face to the wall. Not that,"she said ; V that isa-study in , failures. I will show you something more modest." She went to a stack of pictures in the corner. "See here," she said, hold- ing up a tiny sketch before me ; " ' A Dish of Mischief.' Here's another ; ' Lighten tho Bar'; more modest still Ana here," throwing me an odd glance, compounded of coquetry and laughing doubt, "is a, picture, the subject of which is not modest." . She put her hand on my arm and led me to the centre of the room. Then she gave the picture into my Bands. It was the portrait of a man, strangely resembling myself,* drawn in th» style of the Dutch school, with the light concentrated on the eyes and brows. . "Do you like itt" »he asked me. It is wonderful," I whispered. . " I did it jost-just after that night," she said. I was. troubled at heart, for there, wai à note other than the mocking note of light comedy in her voice. I feared the trend of the" "situation was . toward, perhaps, tragedy!. \- She stood looking up into my face, the light drenching ber from above. She had thrown aside her hat in the parlor below stairs; her hair was brown, .curling crisply about her cars and~forehead in little, twisted tendrils, with a glint of goldon-red in ir. Her ey s w< re brown, too : wistful, laugh- ing, earnest eyes were they, full set in heavy, white lids. - ' "lt seemB so strange that we should meet again like this," she said, "and yet not strange. For our corner of the world is a very little place after alL Yoi have grown very old and manly, and grave, Jack. * I am just beginning to realise that now. I didn't at first. You mustn't think that I meant to be rude to you, Jack. . . . Perhaps I hardly ought to call you Jack?'" "Yes," I. said eagerly. ''Call me .Jack.'" -?-** Thank you, Jack," she murmured beam- ing. " You are a dear old boy. The Same old Jack ! I was sure you wouldn't mind . . , Jacki" . "Yes." ? . . . "Did : . . did it . . . did: I hurt you much, Jack, that night? You know, 1 hadn't thought ot you in that way at all. It came on me io suddenly. And my art wai so much to ros ; to marry m»ant to give it up, you see. . And, then, I .didn't understand myself, and yon were so fierce, and foolish, and wild. I have, wondered, ever, since, that I hal the ccurage to refuse you, Jack . .... . you were such a splendid tempest of a boy." ~ I was filled with contrition and shame. " Pray, - pray do not speak of it," I said. " It isn't fair to yourself. I have no right to listen." "I care not how unfair she be, if only she be fair to . . .' herself ! Eh ? And you have every right tn listen, Jack. -1 give you right, full right Besides, I like to talk about it It is so long ago,-too, and we are BO much older. Surely, it doeanot matter. . . It was such a tender time, such a young time ; a time of dancing blood, Jack. We shall never live it agjdn, nevermore foot it to tba same giddy measure. We are half burnt out now, like bloated candles in the cold dawn. We- haye tainted ova atmos- phere with tiie /consumings of our own The flesh in her cheeks died, leaving them pallid. Her* head drooped and her hands fell list1 essly. " You forgive me, Jack, don't you Î" she said presently. I could not speak. Silence was best I was wrung with vain regret. The po.r little lady! " When you went away that night," she said, "yon took more with you than you knew. Had you come back it might have been all different I cried many nights, thinking of you. It was the thought of your loneliness that made me cry. We had been »nob good chums.* : '. . .- And I was lonely too." £he paused. Half unconsciously I took her hud in mine. " One does not get accustomed to loneli- ness aa to other things." she said. "It ia -ten yea*« ago ; a great time, Jack ; yet my loneliness still has power to hurt me." \- I let fall her band, and turned away, cursing the evil mischance that had betrayed this dear woman to me. There was a tense silence. "They tell - me you- ire married, Jack," she said presently. " It is quite true, I suppose. Why shouldn't it be? . And do you love your wife very, very dearly, Jack !'. She wai turned b alf . from me, her hands busy with the folds of her dress, - I had no words to answer her. Suddenly she uttered a great cry and sank down in a chair, covering her face with her-hands. . ." Oh, I am wicked, wicked ?" she wailed. She sprang up, dry-eyed, trembling, and faced me. "Listen, listen," she said hoarselv, tap Îing my hand. with her fingers. " Listen, 'bis is truth; I hope you do love your wife. Jack ; I hope you do love ber very dearly ; I hope you take her in your arms, to your heart, and kiss her, kiss her always when you meet; I hope you are proud pi her and set her above all women . . . above me! No, no; listen, Jack, listen! Don't try to stop me. You must not go away thinking me worse than I am, This is truth ; this is truth ! Let me con- fess, . . or have I confessed already! ... I love you, Jack, I loved you then, I always loved you, alway« shall love you. I have hungered foi Îou all these years. I can't , keep silent tut we shall not see each other again. It does not matter. And it will be something to remember. The years are very long, very long, and my art is sometimes stale tc me, and the life is gone out of my brain and the cunning from my hand. I am doing Tte) no wrong. Surely I may have my nttk moment ; she has all her life for her verj own. I have been meek, Jack ; I have been even cheerful. I would not hav< spoken now if. .. if .... It's a hard prie» to pay for a little mistake. I was verj young, too. And everything was so pos sible. . . Oh, my God!" She bowed her head on her arm against the walL . "Leave me alone, Jack," she'said "Leave me alone just for a minute. ' I'vr cried against this wall before. I shall bi better presently. It always does me good . ,. And I had meant to be so strong if wi should meet! ... No; don't go away Stand there. I like to know you are stand ing there." It tore my heart to see her. I went np t» her and put my paw on her shoulder.' -Shi caught it in her disengaged hand ant pressed it " Don't cry," I said loutishly. " Fo God's sake don't cry. lhere'«- nothing ii the world worth it" " You're a dear old- boy, Jack," she whU pend. " I shall be aU right io a minute. " The twihght descended on us aUndihi thua' ;'~ .
