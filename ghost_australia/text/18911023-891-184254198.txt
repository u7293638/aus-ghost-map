Religious Records. Clmrclies in Conference. Wesieysn District Meeting. Chairman's Official Sermon. There was a very fair attendance at the Albert street Wesleyan Oharoh on Monday, when the Rev. J. A. Nolan, chairman of the district, delivered the opening address. After singing and prayer, Mr. Nolan announoed as his text the words, "But ye shall receive pewer, after that the Holy Ghost is oome upon yon" (Acts i. 8 ) These words, he said, were the last Testis uttered to His disciples, and they disolosed to them the mystery of power. A number of illustrations were given from nature showing mysterious power, reference bring made to the erapuous at Ilonnt Tar rawera, in New Zealand, and to tha power of the sun. The power whioh the disoiples were to reoeive'was a supernatural power, but the supernatural was an essential of Chriatlanity. That mysterious power made a great ohange in the disoiples. It transformed them from com mon- place "men to heroes, and it alons ac counted for the early trinmpho of Chris tianity. - It was 'he only power which could save sinners. After giving several illustrations of the power whioh was given to tha disciples, Mr. Nolan went on to ahow that it was this power from on high whioh was wanted at the present day. It wag not so mnoh improved methods as the Divine power. -That power ooold be got now by Becking foi' it, and he urged his hsarerB to earnestly pray that the Divine power from on high would descend upon them. A communion service was held at the close of the address, a fair proportion of those present remaining.
