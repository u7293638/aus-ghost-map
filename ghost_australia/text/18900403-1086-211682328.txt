Catholic Missions in Africa. Good new? is coming to us about Lhc progress made by the Catholic missions in Eastern Africa. Tlio' official information is to this effect : . Prince Bismark has instructed Herr von Schlozer, the representive of Prussia . at. the . Yatican, to inform the Holy See that the German empire will henceforth extend its protection to all Catholic missions which may put up settlements in German colonial possessions, whatever religious order may start such settlements. It is to be hoped that Germany, iu her own interest, will ' secure the services of Catholic missionaries in her : colonies situated on the West Coast quite as much as in those situated ou the East Coast of the Dark Continent. Ever since the German flag was first planted in the Cameroons, the Catholic press of the whole world has protested : against the privileges granted in that . territory to the Basle Missionary Society, to the detriment of the Catholic missions, which had been established there long before the empire took over those territories. The j Favfulh informs us that Hen- von ! Schlozer has urged upon the Holy See i that it would be desirable to send out by preference Catholic missions whose members are natives of Gexmauy'. That ought to be an easy thing in Western, quite as much as in Eastern Africa, and the Fathers of the Holy Ghost who years ago offered their services in the Cameroons were decidedly German subjects. It will be for the Catln>liis members of the next German Parlia ment to urge this claim upon the Government more forcibly than has been doue hitherto.
