T'OONGABBIE ELECTIO?L. HOW THE OLD HORSE BEAT THE FAVORIT. The race has been run, and the victory won, By Publican, who had endurance and pace. Red Gum, who was tipped by the "Jour nal," should have been clipped; He was too (h)airy to run a long race. At Toongabbie when they started, Pub lican's friends were down-harted, When they saw Red Gum jump of with the lead; Near Cowwarr it was increasing, withot a chance of decreasing, It was just two to one on the weed. Then they gave Publican some chaff, with two pints of shandy-gaff, When he declared he could yet woin th prize. Then the black Cowwarr nag, with his canvassing brag, For once had sawdust thrown in eyes. For the old horse commenced racing, and Red Gum outpacing, At Glengarry won by three lengthspast the post. And Red Gum with his show, writings posters and blow, Collapsed and cave up the ghost. CHOW CHOW. Toongabbie, August 10th, 1889.
