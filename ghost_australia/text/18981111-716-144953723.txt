If she had appeared to me as a seeker after social elevation, I could have addressed her before this. But, successful in such a .course, I would have at once re duced iny high estimate of her character.' 'It is certainly a matter hedged with dif . Acuities. This is a free country, a wonder ful country ! and its education brings out wortn ana cnaracter at limes, jout: it aiso opens wide the door to adventurers. There 'Certainly is a higher plane of life, even here, is there not?' 'Yes, mother — if you had lived in Solo mon's time, the Queen of Sheba would have come to visit you and neglected the king.' But Mrs. North was in earnest now; her son was the stake, and she loved him too deeply to treat the subject of his destiny lightly. 'And while the social plane,' she contin ued, 'which is established on a high grade, has many of low degree upon it, thrust there by fortune, still, must we not be wary, lest we suffer by sudden folly?' ' 'Mother, you are wise— and good. Surely you can help me in such a case.' 'We will at least be just to the child we are weighing in tfae balance.' 'Even if Diana is great.' said the son. 'But Diana can put many thorns in the pathway where love treads — if she wills— and society generally wills.' 'You are a philosopher and a poet, too,' replied the son, 'and I could not appeal to both in vain.' 'Hush, boy; if you are impertinent I wiU not tell you a plan I hav« in mind.' 'I know your plan already,' he returned, confidentlv. 'And what is it?' 'You will invite Miss Lamont to visit you . when I am away — and your good judgment will guide you. Then I will appear upon the scene at another time;' 'That is a good suggestion. I will act up- . on it/' 'And, mother,' the boy urged, with some thing: the matter of bis voice, 'you will not criticise too hard a young woman whose training has been on a distant sea coast?'' 'I do rigt think, from what I saw, that she needs criticism. She appears a lady born.' The sou arose from his chair, took his mother's hands, kissed her, and said some thing about the usefulness of mothers in -?general. - - As he reached the door be turned and said: 'I will rwturn from Philadelphia Monday and come directly to the house. I am in formed it will be better to bring the insur ance funds direct to the house — there has been information lodged with the city police that some desperate characters are looking around our office. If I send a package up, put it iniffie muniment room and I will have a night watch here.' He closed the door-and was off. The next day a carriage was ? driven . *round the bay, a servant bearing a little note to the cottage of Mrs. Jennie Smith. It read as follows:' My Dear Miss Lamont: : . . :'.? It is my wish to become better acquainted with you, and make it . pleasant for you to attend future assemblies. My son will be away over Sunday . May I send the carriage for you at 2 p. m., and have you to:; lunch; with me alone? I lead a quiet life, and I wish to talk with you in a good oldfashion ed way.

Miss Helen took the book, opened it, and then sat down by the window under the lilies and ran a few pages through her fin gers. 'Now,' said Mrs. North to herself, 'I can see to what extent she is intellectual,' and at the same time she smiled at her own de ceitfulness. Thus far she had been won by h er gentle manner. 'I should like to read this book,' Helen said, almost as bluntly as though speaking to a companion in years and station. 'My dear, it is about commerce — and fields where men study out great national prob lems.' 'Yes, and I would like to read them and study them.' ''But it is about new things— new rail roads and new territories.' 'But it is about the future! To what a wonderful future we are coming. I am so thankful that we may live to see it!' and at this point the girl's face glowed with anima tion 'Yes, child, you will see it.' 'And you, too, I am sure. And your son will. He shows here by a table of progres sions 'that the tonnage of our commerce will soon be the greatest of any of the powers! And here,' she continued, turning over to another chapter, 'he states that great par allels of railroads will soon be built to the Mississippi River into the territories. I be lieve that, too.' 'You do? Why, I don't know anything about such things. Are there no railroads there now?' 'To me,' said the girl warmly, 'there is a glory in being the creator of such a develop ment of one's country. I wish I were a man!' And then she laughed at the hardi hood of a young girl wishing such ungentle things. The expression may have sounded ill to old-fashioned Mrs. North, but the laugh for gave it all. 'Why a man?' she asked of Helen. 'Because — because — oh, there is a weak ness about us. We are lookedupon a good deal as a curiosity. I suppose the wish to to be unsexed is rather immodest, is it not?' 'Not if you simply wish to have greater strength — I think the assertion of a strength which we do not have is unfortunate.' 'Sometimes/ : said Helen thoughtfully, 'I wish I was stronger — not that I wish to do things out of reach, but to do my work better. I often start but upon the street, full of hope and joy at the chance to do something, and as I move along so buoyant ly some man will pass me and by manner remind me that I am but a woman after all. ' 'Then, being a woman,' suggested Mrs. North, 'would it not be better to be less am bitious'1' 'I think so. I often wish I were ugly or feature — so that people would look at me no more than young men.' 'If you have beauty, does it not draw friends to you?' said the elder lady, gently reprimanding the self-assumption of beauty. 'Yes; but don't you think that hard la bor and propriety would bring friends?' . 'Do you find the industrious and the good about you successful .because of their earn estness? Are not many unfortunates wor thy of better things?' ; \ 'Yes,' replied the girl. 'In my daily work lam placed beside faithful workers who are borne dowri-to 'the, very hBartti witfc misfortune. I am happier than they only because I have hope.' . 'And skill,' added Mrs. North. 'My son thinks you have a great future, and takes an interest in your work.' After this experi mental reference the lady watched Helen's '' face very closely.' ? .?????/. But the latter replied at once, without the slightest change of color or accent: ' T f hink he must be, - he seeined so much interested in that painting at the academy. .' Why, the academy has addressed a note to : me casting me to sell it to'them, and also to ; meet - a committee soon to arrange about , qther paintings. . I, half ;bejieve your son has brought some of this about.' 'I think not,' said the tnother, 'because he has told me nothing of it* ' ? 'Apd do sous tell their mothers all about such^snatters! I thought that was confined to daughters.' ??? .'Mine does — but then, there is only one Conrad,'' and the proud woman looked down upon the' floor. ????-? ?..?-:?.!??.? ,. _ .

'But you will love just the same, I did.» 'To love above you would be unfortunate, said Helen, 'and to love beneath us is stall worse— it seems so to me.' Mrs North, of choice, would nothavB ut tered another word. The earnestness of the girl was the guaranty of its truth The sub ject was closed when she remarked: 'But ihe demands of the heart will come some day-and come in power. You will not deny it then. It will come.' Then it was that the little 'dumty maid' opened the door and brought them down to the world of reality and cold chicken, with that remark: 'Lunch is ready.' Wnen late at night the following Monday Conrad North came home, and retired to his room, he found upon the table a little note. He held it up to the light a moment, then broke tne wax seal, and opened it. Ifr'wa* from his mother. My Dear Son— You have a task befor« you. But you will have your mother's pray ers for success.

He rwrnhr**-- had not beon idle / ^y'— ^— ' during a portion of his sickness. He rose from his bed a differ ent person in one respect — he could read a little, aud every day added to bis powers in that direction. His progress was really quite astonishing. His face was paler than before, and his step was still unsteady. But his features ..'_ ?„ ^, longer expressive of vacancy, and his step was not shambling. His white forehead and finely molded mouth and chin gave promise of considerable strength. How often at night he asked after the wel fare of Winnie. This pleased Helen, and her pictures of the girl were at times tinged slightly with the golden hue of affection. It may be stated, also, that the clear-eyed island daughter, with her ' iss,' and 'wass,' and sweet Gaelic accent, also inquired daily for Pinnie. One day Pinnie was feeling unusually de pressed—he felt that he was becoming a bur den to the household. All were glad to see him ao well, and to hear him rattle off ' lit erature'' with more or less readiness. But the fact that he was a non- supporting mem ber of the. group was painful. So, one day, ?when Helen retur^gd from her labor, which still continued, she found a note awaiting her. It was written in boyish script, and read as follows : ? Dear Miss Helen: I thought I ought to get something to do. So I have borrowed a little money of Mrs. Smith, and I have gone over to Mr. Conrad North's to talk with him and see if he knows what I can do. I will hope to be back as soon as you do. ; PINNIE.. Mrs. Smith had gone into the city shop ping, and had not returned, and the maid of all work knew nothing of Piuuie's going. Eight o'clock aid Mrs. Saiith both CAnie, and stiU no Pinnie.'' But atialf-past 8, just as they ?were becoming alarraed, a note came from Mrs. North stating that i'Mr. Pinnie' would remain there over night. ' At.the North castle it had been a dull day. ? The light remark mad«: by Conrad about a threatened raid on the down town office wor ried . Mrs. . North. Being forewarned, of course. Mrs. North felt that there was no real danger. Hovreyer, what may be called the 'feoiinine shadow' hung over her, and her mind refused to dispel tfce glooin. | The huge clock in the hallway had just t struck 2, when the heavy knocker on the | heavy door sent a chill through her slight ! frame. By the time the-nan servant was at the door, ilrs. North was at the head of the ' old-fashioned staircase. The door was open ed. , There stood, a pale, tank, sickly-looking woman in masculine raiment — at least that was what Mrs. 'North suspected. The large, dark eyes looked strangely and steadily upon the doubtful Mr. -Bojiar, who stood for a moment without saying a word, as if wait ing directions from bis mistress. And when Bonar did spring him with a question, he did it carefully, so as not to scare him away in case he were a *eal ghost. 'An' phwat kin I do f er the likes o' yer?' 'Can you tell ma, mister, if Mr. North. lives here!' '?Indade, soor, au' we kin do that,' return ed the. Irishman, without offering the desired information. On the long piazsa, or porch, near tfc» outer door^ , was a bngeT rustic chair. With a stammering word .Binnis almost tumbled -into this, much to the anxiety of the man 'Och, me leddy, the land is sick.': . Mrs. North was by him at that moment, and askedof Pinnie: 'My boy, are you ill!*' '1 have been, Mrs. North, but I am oaly \ so tired now, I walked from the ferry.' 'Bonar will brmg you into the house'— and, as she said this; the sudden thought came into her mind} that* perhaps, tb,i6 had something to do with the threatened bur glary. 'But theu,?-*he reflected in an in ttant, 'that was at the down town office «nd sunely this youth- would notrbo-an-«sant .. insuchwork!' ' , Then she said aloud: 'Ton speak my name, bat I do not remlanber to havfe met I you, do you know me?' ? ''fes, I know you tram the words of Miss Lamont. I came to talk with Mr, North, who can tell me what to do, probably ' : 'Are you the sick person of whom Miss Lamont told us?' ^^ ,[.- To se OoKinniED ... :- ..,.
