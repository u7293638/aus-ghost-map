THE LIGHTHOUSE AT THE ZOO. a Bio habitant feo»«.-Old Map of Central Africa. (Spectator). Few public characters are "at home" to visitors during so many hours of the day as the inmates of the hen-house at the Zoo , who might with justice enter a protest against the incivility of the public, which insists on taking the notice that " 1 he lions will be fed at 1 o'clock ''as a pressing invitation to be ei cotters of the r manners at most times Even the hardened African traveller has been known to win co under the sustained criticism of his black fellow-creatures upon his manner of taking his food and the beasts that were born to rule in the jungles and deserts of an uncivilised world may well complain of a judgment passed on their advance in manners based upon the daily appeal to their primitive o instincts \ of the economy of the hen-house so far differs from the ordinary life of the other inmates of the Zoo that, for an undeserving public which wants excitement and has no time for robbery thou, there is every inducement to continue its visits to a particular to us The cattle this, the anto'opo-housp tim raonhoj-palace, or the natives, proved and the same paper france at any time in the day The pleasant round of comfort citing drinking, dying, or sleeping goes on without var day or long cessation But the life of the go out camping is ordered differently and with greater exactness in the morning, in the hen-house, all is quiet The animals are resting or sleeping, and the only visitors are at tints or photographers whom tim lions oblige ' with a sitting at a cheaper rate than any professional models in the trade No wonder inhow*nuti} characters the old Nubian lion Duke' li an appealed. He has Btriv en with Hercules, carried Una, been vanquished by barmen, and shot by Nimrod He has roared at Dimer, and elton marty as innumerable and now that his grand old lady is shrunk his eye dim, and his road diminished to a poor old lion's plea for an early bone, he still lives on canvas to entertain Audi ocles in his don, or dies, the last of his race, in the desert cavern of some artist's fancy Doubtless he is easier to the old lion than if left to the cruel end which Nature reserves for the last days of the noblest of beasts But we could w ah that some heavy event amid were opened to give him the food he loved best in his last days, and that Mr Briton Btv love would paint him as he is, into the great black mane still h sings like a robe upon his shoulders, and the stiffened limbs still give support to the shrunken yet majestic frame -or form, a lid writer, is, perhaps, a saying which would appeal to the hungry lions equally with the artistic visitors to the Zoo, as loedtug-timo approaches At 2 o'clock p in the animals awake stretch themselves, and yawn, flum- ing the width of their enormous jaws, and rows of gas anning teeth The public grow interested, and the artists desponding When the little boy in I knickerbockers the work on whose easol suggests I the story of Michael Angela's first rusty in sculpture, drops his brushes and runs to the steps at I the back to watch his sitters in action Then follows I the mutual quiet Chewe before dinner-in this case an duly protracted All the beautiful, little creatures, pacing ceaselessly to and fro, noiseless as ghosts, seem to be performing a kind of " grand chain " which becomes faster and faster as their impatience and hunger increase As the howling of the wolves in their distant cages is heard by the lions excitement breaks beyond control, and the roars of the hungry beasts only cease as the truck of food is emptied As a spectacle the night has a certain interest But except for those whose imagination can a picture no other side of animal life in daily cont 5 with man, it is, perhaps, the worst moment to select I in order to appreciate the real character of those most friendly beasts, the lions and tigers at the Zoo I In the early morning hours when their " stump I rooms" have been duly swept and strewn with fresh sawdust, and their toilet-which is always completed in their sleeping chambers-is finished, a the iron doors are opened, and the owners of the different cases come leisurely out to greet the day, each in its humour as the night s sloop or natural temper dictates On the last occasion on which the writer waited on the tigers' levee, it was evident that some disagreement had marked the morning hours The t gress from Hyderabad came out with a rush and greeted the I world with a most forbidding grow 1 She then stood erect like a disturbed ant, switching her 1 tail to and fro, and after examining every corner of the cage summoned her mate with a discontented i dear The tiger then stalked out and endeavoured I to soothe his partner with some commonplace caress, which apparently soothed her ruffled nerves, for after sharpening her claws upon the floor, she lay down, and rolling over on her back, with paws folded on her breast and mouth half open, went most contentedly to sleep. The pair of tiger cubs in in the next cage were still sleeping the long sleep of youth, one making a pillow of the other's shoulder Tigers, it may be observed, do not sleep like cats, | but resemble in all their attitudes of repose the luxurious languor of some petted house-dog, constant rolling over on their backs, and sticking up their paws, with head, upon one side, and ov es half opened I his pair of cubs, now some two years old, are the youngest inhabitants of the house, having been presented by the Maharanee of Odoyporo in 1892 Both cubs, when called by the keeper, can be stroked and petted like cats But no tiger which has yet lived in Regent's Park has been so completely tamed as their neighbour from Turkestan Taking into account the hardships endured by a wild animal in its transport from the distant stopped of Central Asia, across the Caspian Sea then by rail to the Euxine, and finally by ship to England, it is difficult to maintain the belief in the 11 must forfeit) " of the tiger after making the acquaintance of Warsaw When he was a first bought by an English officer, who discovered him in a cage waiting for a pair- I chaser on the eastern shore of the Caspian u Rea, the tiger was already an adept at "tricks " He would pick up and pour over his head a basin of water, aim was as tame as a poodle The animal remembered and recognised his first owner long after he had found a resting-place at the Zoo, though not at so long an interval us that after which the hour in the lower showed its affection for its old keeper Tins Son, which a certain Mr Archer, employed at the Court of Morocco, had brought up like a puppy dog, buying it to be on its bed, and ho grow as great as a mastiff, and no dog could be more recent be to those knew, was sent to the lower, whole, after an interval of seven years, he recognised one John Bull, a servant of his master, who according to Captain John Smith, went with divers of his friends to see the lions, not know me that his old friend was there Yet this rare beast smelt but before he saw him, whining growing and tumbling with such an expression of acquaintance, that, being informed by the keepers how he came, Bull so prevailed that the keepers opened the grate, and Bull went in But no dog could fawn more on his master than the lion on him, kicking his feet and hands, and running to and fro, to the wonder of all the beholders Bull was quite satisfied with this recognition, and managed to get out of the gate but when the lion saw his friend gone, no boast by bellowing, muring, screeching, and howling could express more rage and sorrow neither would he other cat or drink for four whole days afterwards " "Warsaw's" affections have not been put to so severe a test, but hut forbearance may be judged from the fact that he will allow his paws to be pulled out Iwtw over the bars, and his toes to be examined, to see whether his nails want cutting "Jack," the i Indian tiger, rivals 'A Warsaw s" good temper, and a surpasses him in be au- y He shares, with the young Sake to be, the place of honour as the finest creature in the Gardens When he armed, in 1888, as a two-months-old cub he was led by a collar and chain like a big dog, and for some time was lo 1 to and from his cage by his keepers with no other precaution, until his reluctance to be shut up, when he preferred to walk at large, led to Ina permanent imprisonment. A tiger cub from China, which arrived recently in the Gardens, was not less time, rubbing its cheeks against the keeper's hand, purring and setting up its tin I like a friendly cat This club has lost its coat, owing to the hardships he endured before arriving at the Zoo, and lives in private apartments at the back of the house, but the fur is now growing and before long it will take its place among those of mankind who are already introduced to London society Death has left more than one gip among the old inhabitants of the house, and two at least will be replaced with difficulty I be rare snow leopard from Thibet d d not long survive its arrival one of the pumas has died, audits mate is as yet inconsolable while the old jaguar from Comentos, most richly coloured and picturesque of all the great cats is also missing from the ranks But not even at Amsterdam, the head-quarters of the " lion trade" in Europe, is there such a gathering of the feature as in the Society 's Gardens in Regent Park.
