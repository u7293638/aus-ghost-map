THE GHOST LAYED AT THE 1 ; " ROYAL " ' ' 'To the Editor of The Herald. oia,— uu Saturday last the ot.ty and suburbs were posted with startling placards, informing tbe 'public that the " Ghost" would appear that evening nt tlio Theatro Royal, conse quently, hundreds of persons who intended a visit to the other theatres, wore deluded into paying thoir money at tho Koynlj and every portion oflhai" spacious building wsa crowded .by pn audtonoo impatient to behold the groat sight. But it was a delusion, for aftor having kopt tho duped in a stato of suspense for threo hours and a half, daring whioh time a droary five not eomething-or-othcr was performod, only kopt from .being unsupportablo by. tlio oxoollent acting of Mr ond Aire Heir, the great Sullivan appiiarcd at the foot-lights, and told a plausible story about aomo lawyer having sent a ihreatening letter, aud that he (Blarney) fearing to " gat into tho claws of tbe lawyers, was afraid to produce tho Ghost." How Sir, if tlio story is true, why did not tho timid manager toll the public . before lie took their money, for as lawyer's oflires cIobo at noon on Saturdays, ho must have rcooivod tho dreadful missive before ten, or eleron o'clock at night. If (Mr Sullivan oannot afford a full and luoid explanation, I can tell him that ho will forfeit tiie good opinion and confidence of his patrons. Yours respectfully; ; Om oi MAmr who will - war boon pat ' anothbb Visit to tub Rotal. Blarney Castle, Saturday night. : A Death without Tbrrob. — An aged clergyman, resident at Newstead, purchased, some two years ago, the site for his grave in the Newstead Cemetery, and this weok lie lies em ployed tho gravedigger to sink tlio grave to a depth of ton feet. The rev. gentleman thinks it right to make this preparation, as he considers it likely he will die suddenly; owing to his advanced age, and further,1 it will 'prevent the world saying he was unprepared. — Mount Alexander
