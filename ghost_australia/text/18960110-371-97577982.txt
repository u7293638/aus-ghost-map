ABSENT. At a certain school not very far from Halifax, it used to be the daily custom for the scholars to repeat the Apostles Creed, one beginning ' I believe iu God the Father Almighty,' the text going on' Maker of ' heaven and eatth,' and so on torn Â«od torn about, until the creed was conclnded. It was also nsual for the scholars to occupy the same place day after day, so that a boy always repeated exactly the same bit of creed. : This arrangement led to a rather amusing scene one day when one of the popits happened to be absent. The creed was said as usual until they came to the passage, ' I believe in the Holy Ghost,' when the boy whose turn it was io go on hesitated for a minute, and then said, ' Please, sir, him as believes f th' Holy Ghost isn't here to-day.' ? ? ?
