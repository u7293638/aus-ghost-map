Sermon. LOVE ANJ) LAW. (By Db.;Maolajien.) Love is the foundation' of obedience, and obedience is the.guro putepmoand ie-. suit, of love..';, That, ;is true, in regard to the lower forms of love, which may. tench us something' of the operation of the Tiicrhfir. We ' all1 know that love which' is real,, and not simply passion and selfish ness with a mask on, delights most chiefly in knowing and conforming, to the will of the beloved; -and* that .there: is -nothing1 sweeter than to bo commanded by the dear voice and to 'obey, for dear 'love's sake. And you have only to takethat which.is the' experience of every true heait, in a thousand sweet ways in daily life; .and'to' lift it to the higher regions, and to transfer it to the bond that unites us with Jesus Christ, tpVsee 'that- Ho, has, invoked no illusory, but an omnipotent power, when He' has rested the whole force; of His transforming and sanctifying, energy'upon; this one1 principle :: ' If ye ,lpvo '-M e, the Lawgiver, ye will k'eep the commandments of My lawA,'; .-??' i- ; ?; ?-?

When Christ comes into, my heart, then all the obscene) twilightlov ing shapes, that lurked there, and defiled it, .will yanishlikp .ghosts at cock-crowing before, His calm and- pure, presence. He and 'He alone,- entering my hoartby the portals of my love, -will1 coerce my evil and stimulate1 my good, 'And' if I: love1 Him' I shall ke:pp; His commandments. Now, brethreni.'here is a plain.; test, and ,a dpuble- barrelledone, \ which' tries both', bur love; and obedience ; . with a sharp .touchstone :^-;'Tf ye,. loye Me. ye, will .keep My, oommandments.' That implies, first,, that :there is no love 'worth calling so which does not keep His com mandments. All the 'emotional 'and the. mystic and the so-called higher parts, of Christian experience' ' have to be content to submit to. this plaiii test:— Dp they , help;us tp do as Christ \ would ' have us, ana! that because He' would, have us? Love to., Hini that does ,not keep.,His .commandments is., either -spurious, or dangerously feeble., r The trite sign of its - presence in the heart and the noblest of its operations is not to be found1 in ? high pitched expressions of fervid emotion, nor even in the 'sacred1 joys of solitary com munion, but in its making 'us,7 while in the rough struggle of daily life, and sur rounded by trival tasks,, live near Him and. by. Him and for Him and' like Him. If.I.liye so, I loye Him ;- if not, not. Not that. I mean to say ;. that in regard., of -each .individual action of a Christian, man's .life- there/ must.- be the conscious presence of 'reference to the supreme -loye; but1 that each individual' character of which; that referene'e to th« supreme love is the very \ formiatiye. prin ciple and foundation. Thecolo ing matter put in at .the fountain willdye every, drop of the stream j and . they whose inmost hearts are tinged and . tinctured with the sweet love -ot Jesus Christ, - from . their heart will go forth issues of life all colored and moulded thereby. ? TeBt your Christian love by your pratical obedi ence. '' ?'' ' ? , And, on the other hand, there is no obedience worth calling so' which is not the child of love ; and all the multitude of right things which Christians do without that motive are rn.de short work of by the prinoiple. Obedience which is formal,, mechanical, matter-of-course; : without the presence in it of a loving submission of the will ;' obedience which is reluctant, balcu'ated, forced upon us by -dread, imi tated from others—all that is nothing; and Jeaus Christ does not count it as ' obedience at all., . This is a sieve with very small meshes, and. there will be a great deal of rubbish loft, in it after the shaking. ' If ye love Me.keep.My com mandments.' The :keeping-off My com-, mandments which -hasnot' love to Me underlying it is no keeping atall. I can fancy a man saying, 'Kfep His commandments? Woe is me! How am I to keep P' The answer is ' Love.' And I can fancy him saying, 'LoveP' Yes! 'And now am 1 to lover i. cannot gee up love at. the word of command, or!by any voluntary, effort.! And the answer comes again, /Believe!' Trust Christ,, and you will love Him. . Love Him and you do His wjlli: .And; then the question comes again, ' Believe what P.'u And the answer coines, ' Believe ? that He- is the Son of God who died for your Nothing else, will kindle a man's love' than the faithful contemplation and grasp of Christ in that . character and aspeot. Only the redeeming Christ affords a reasonable ground for our love to Him. Hero is a dead Man, dead for nineteen centuries, expecting you and me to have which: will influence our conduct and our character. What right' has He to ex pect thatP There is only one reason able ground upon which I may be called to love Jesus Christ, and that is that He died for me. And such a love towards such a Christ is the only thing which will wield power sufficient ,_ to guido.to coerce, to restrain, to constrain, and i to sustain my weak, wayward, re bellious,- and sluggish will._ AH other emotions ot so-called admiration and: worship and reverence and affection for Jesus Christ are' apt to be tepid j but this one has power and warmth in it. Here is a unique power in the history of the world, that '.not only did Ee make this astounding claim upon all' subsequent generations, but. ihie^f; . the. .rab'sequent .generations.. have responded -to, it, and 'that tof day there. aro millions ,pf men ^ho, , loye Jesus Christ rwith a;-l6ye warm, -per- ? sonal, ! deep, vpowerfulr— the spring of all their goodness and uthe' Lord of , their iliv.es/'1 Why 'do-!they;P '?- 'For -one reason 'only.
