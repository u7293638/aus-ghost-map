THE COLONIAL CHURCH. (From the Morning Chronicle.) In pursuance of a promise given in the course of last session, the Government have introduced a measure for relieving the colonial clergy from certain unjust and oppressive disabilities. -It ■will be remembered that the Archbishop of Canterbury managed to send down to the Com mons, on the 4th of August last, a Bill for the regulation of the Colonial Church, which had been settled in consultation by the Bishops, early in the spring. This Bill was, however, lost, partly on account of its late and unseason able appearance, and partly because of its inhe rent defects. Although the fruit had basked for six months in the sun of episcopal patronage, it was unripe, after all. The measure was per plexed and cumbrous. Careful and minute in its provisions against offence, it offended by its very care and minuteness; and its anxiety to provide against abuse became itself an abuse. It affected to legislate with jealousy, as though it were dealing with some turbulent elements of inchoate schism. It bore the stamp of its parentage—being, on the face of it, a reluctant concession. We regretted its failure only be cause it was opposed on wrong grounds. Some affected to believe that it would create a Colo nial Establishment; and others sought.to per suade the world, though they never could , have persuaded themselves, that it would create a spiritual tyranny. In other quarters, again,, the scheme was criticised, and not unjustly, on the ground of its attempting too much. It . wM thought to be too formal, explicit, and definite. It admitted lay co- operation in Synods; but it prescribed with over-accuracy relations which experience alone can adjust, and it sought , to provide against emergencies, and to meet con tingencies, which are variable, exceptional, and incapable of being ruled antecedently. On its rejection, it was intimated that the Solicitor General would, in the ensuing session, bring; in a measure on the subject, under Government auspices. This measure has been introduced by'Sir Richard Bethell, in a speech as brief and con densed as the scheme which it proposed. On the rejection of the Bill of 1853, we expressed a hope that its successor would be simply of an enabling character ; and our expectations luCre been realised. All that is propossd is to help the Colonial Churches to keep themselves. The Bill simply aims at removing obstructions. The Solicitor- Ganeral, with a legal caution in which we share, is loth to commit himself to the view that the Colonial Churches are even at present debarred from synodical consultation and action. Doubts exist, however, on the subject, or have been conjured up by the sensitive imaginations of those who dread some errors or abuses, of the nature of which we are not very accurately in formed ; and these doubts the Ministerial measure proposes to lay. The thin ghost of praemunire, whatever it may be, which walks Canadian forests or haunts Australian glades is now to be laid for ever. The ChiircRof metropolitan Sydney is really at last to be per mitted to settle questions about curates,' licenses, and the propriety of ordering special prayers for special occasions, without its bishop incurring'a dungeon in the Tower, or the forfeiture of half his goods. It is at last deemed that the tim^ haa come for allowing an Indian prelate and;:hie clergy to consult about missionary without advice from h«1 ' f 7T r.

But, in fact the 25th Henry "VUl. was not directed! against sjtiudioad action in general; and certainly fioft against such synodicat action as is novt demanded for the Church.

The result of the statute has been adverse to all eoclesiitstial action; but its: object "Was only to interdict a particular and temporary itorf of synedieal deliberation, to prevent the xik&gf; from settling canons' to' beN submitted to \- ®om^ and from, promulgating them under Jtaphlf sawctiofts; But can any rational being i *®gpogff that this danger exists any longer ? In 1533, it was very possible and likely that the eterjgy would meet in Synod, and would retain Fapai Supremacy ; and, to forestall this dMg&V; the Act of Submission was passed.
