Thursday, 26th October. Jeremiah xxxvi., 110. â€” ' Holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost' (2 Pet. i. 21); and here we see how it came, bitbybit, to be written down . and the Bible made. Jeremiah had God's message to deliver, but he was not allowed to . enter the temple, so he got. his friend Barach to write down and go and read it.
