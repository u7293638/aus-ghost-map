The news affected ithe Spa:rrerILawk. as it had Aunt Jerusha. - They thrtw up the window and ejected their hea:ds but with no satisfactoryv iesulr. Sam caught up his hat and rushed. do wn the street after Mir Vilas Stanfield, who sprung along in the wake of tho ::uto matice tilbury. at a' college-acquiredi gait. It was ic very nice vehicle; enameinlled in dark green and tupholsterdd in russct leather. In the middle of the. seait dressed in d?irk green and- r'asseti to: Il:tch tile tillmUry' was a very young woman manceuvring the motor as if'her oinly desire was to keep her tlirnofit'a the top of its speed. -.::' Vilas Stanlield could not:overtake it.

He put lhisfingers to his lilis and in creased the strengtli of the.whistle. :, 'She stopped, the wheels of. her:.n r riage on the-very edge of the. decrepit bridge. turning white, too, but not be cause of the dangei'. ' -ih Stantield." she said severely, as lie came up, "may' I -ask :wh'at this menus?". - - "Certainly," he said,-touching his hat; "You can't.cross the bridge:. It's not safe even .for foot passengers. I saw you from my boarding-liouse window. and I came to tell you."' S"Very kind, I'm sure," she'said, with a little toss of her russet feathers, "but I've no wish to have you. save my life a second time. We had enough of that melodramna at Buide;" and she puts her hands on the smotoir hanidles again. He sprang forward, his eyes blazing.' "I'm in dirnest, Miss Waterloo. You' must not cross that bridge, unless: you want to be drowned." "I'm in earnest, too. 1 shall dross that bridge. and I won't lih-eo you sate myy life. The obligation of having you sa e ii ait lnBud is enough." "Very well." he replied, in a hlard, crisp tone; '"I won't save it; tlie';nbut here comes a mi:in iolm -I know. Sam," lie called. "show this lldy'hoi. to ,get icross by the othr .bridge," and resum ing his hat he walkedl.raipidly baclk to ile village. "It's nonsense!" cried Miss Wa?terloo as soon as Vilas Stanfield was out of sight. "Of course I C.an go :over this bridge. I have crossed two this moin ing that were quite as bad." "To tell the truth, now,". said Samn, slowly, "he's about right. .I wouldn't drive our cow over this bridge since the last rain. Why, it ate the mortar right out 'tween the stones. I'll show you the way 'rolunld by the other one." "I lhaven't time," shle said,.glancing down at the tiny watch chatelaine at her ijacket lapel. "I've lost over five minutes now. and a I'm racing anlid must get back to Steepletoni as fast as I clln." And onlice oren takiug the motor. she shot across tie bridge almost to Ilhe ohller side, when there was a waver. a crash. a collapse, and Miss Waterloo ant:il her tilbulry au:liomlobile disalppeared \vili the bridge.
