There be Land Rats and Water Rats. A Mare's Nest. SHADE of Old Vanderdecken, who has brought your uneasy spirit to our peaceful waters in your ship with an unpronounceable name ? Where do you hail from ? What's your cargo ? and what's your business ? Mysterious, to say the least of it. You've got no papers ; and your crew speak a lingo hitherto unknown on this earth ; how- ever, it may be in some other sphere. Stay — a happy thought ! may be your'e only playing a practical joke on us, like the Sandhurst ghost, without a head. Prenez garde, mon brave capi- taine! you might find a shot through your hull that will scatter your cargo of bricks all abroad, and who knows what may turn up underneath — as I remarked before— your'e a mystery, and savour a good deal too much of Paul Clifford and Captain Kidd for my liking. Plain Sailing.
