A young named Henry Bryan, a labourer, living at Mulgrave, was admitted to the Alfred Hospital yesterday, suffering from a severe wound of the foot, which he acci- dentally inflicted upon himself while chop- ping wood. He was in a very weak state from loss of blood when admitted. A verj sudden death occuired at Vi ilhams town on Sntmdaj Air B Groves, builder, was at his workshop apparently in good health, when he was suddenly seized vvlth a fit of apoplexj, and died a few minutes after leinoval to his home He did not speak a w ord after the attack _ho _*erfc»ai Standend states that the fast rain on the blanch railvvaj from the Springs to Vvaligunjah will start on the 7th mat, w hen vv heat und other pioduco maj be for warded to the metiopoliB During the past jeai (states the Albmu Banna) the amount collected at the Albuij Custom house was £26,061, and for the last quartei £0,002 17s Sd During 1877, the sum of £31,009178 Id was received A curious story is related by the AIbury Banner " At an early hour on the morning of the 28th ult a man rushed into the house of a Mrs Everitt on the Albury flat, and announced that he was ' Kelly, the bush ranger.' At this time the only persons in the house were Mrs Everitt and her sister in law, who, naturally enough, were sorne- what alarmed at the announcement. The intruder, after announcing his name, seized hold of one of the two women, and it appears attempted vlolence. Just then, however, the husband came in, and the bushranger ran off. In the meantime the other woman, fearing to be robbed by the man, had carefully secreted several £1 notes in the ashes on the hearth, and there, in the excitement of the moment, they were allowed to remain until they were destroyed .The soi disant bush- ranger is described as having carried two wellington boots in his beolt, one strapped on each side, so arranged as to represent re- voler
