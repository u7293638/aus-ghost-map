THE LADIES' COLUMN The Old Path. The same old path ! Long years have flown Sinco last I trod its way; I scarcely thought-such change I've known To find its marks to day. But still its lovely course I trace, Unchanged, by fence and rill, Through meadow, wood, and briery place, And o'er the verdant hill. And in the valley, far ahead, The evening shadows hold The house to which my footsteps led intwilight hours of old. Who treads the path ?-who dwells there now ? I neither know nor care; I only know no tender brow . And voice await meo there. And that to walk that quiet trail Would give me such deep pain As all my soul could not avail To drive from me again. Alae! I know not where thou art, What time has done with thee 'Tis but the ghost of my young heart Which haunts this place and me.. But I would give my life's best pride, Could this old path once more But lead me, dearest, to thy sidel And to the love of yore l Jons 13.
