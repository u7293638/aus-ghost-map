A Lady Bookmaker. A WRITES bad a chat (he other day with an individual who does a little business for a lady bookmaker. " My employer is a fashion able lady milliner residing not far from Piccadilly," said be, " she is also a lady book maker in a very nice way of business. AH her clicnts are ladies, and I should estimate that she has about sixty ; they go to her place of business ostensibly to see about their dresses ; but more often than not they go for the purpose of backing horses. Any bets my employer doesn't care about taking herself I arrange for her at the clubs. You would be astonished if you knew the number of ladies -some of them mere youngsters too-who lay out their money on horses every race day. Why, I've seen girls of sixteen years of age put £5 on a horse that had no ghost of a chancc of a winning. They do it chiefly through a shopkeeper, such as a hair-dresser and a mantle-maker. I have known a young married lady lose £10 a week regularly for months, while another I came across-an old lady of seventy-made a small fortune in a couple of years. A few of them have 1 infallible'systems of their own, while others club together and plunge heavily. Taking the whole lot together they must lose between them £400 a week sometimes. When a woman takes to betting she acts as if the were in a fever. They're that mad they don't know what they do, and when they lose three or four days running- well, if my employer weren't fairly muscular, she might have to retire from her profession slightly damaged."
