THE CO3LET. A few days ago a correspondent signing himself ' Observer' wrote to us as follows : — 'Before the comet disappears, it would increase mv interest in our illustrious visitor to have the following questions answered, if the elements have been obtained to do so : — ' n. What is the weight of the come; ''. ' b. What is the specific gravity ? 'c. What ivas the maximum velocity at perihelion ? ' d. What has been the length of tail ? ' e. What, angle does the plane of the comet's orbit form with the plane of the Earth's orbit? '/. What distance was the comet from the Earth when passing through the pline of the Earth's orbit before and after perihelion f' We referred his letter to Mr. C. Todd, C.M.G., who has kindly supplied us with the following information : — 'a and b. We possess no data for answering either of these questions. All observations of comets— even the largest — go to sho\v that their mass is infinitesimally smalL The satellites of Jupiter exhibited no signs of disturbed orbita when Lexell's Comet twice passed through their midst, although its own orbit on each occasion was altogether altered. Nor was the earth sensibly disturbed when the same comet came within 1,500,000_ mile3 of its surface. The present comet is probably no exception to the rule, and although when first seen its nucleus was large, apparently globular, and solid, or planetary looking, both before and after the perihelion, it has since altered its form, and is now reduced to a thin streak of light set in its surrounding coma, giving one the idea of an emission of the matter forming the nucleus in two streams into the tail, which has grown in length from about 5° to 20', and is now over 100.000,000 miles long. 1 c. The perihelion passage occurred late on the nigkt of September 17, or early in the morning of the 18th, the distance from the sun being less than any previously known comet, or about 453,000 miles, that is, within about 23,000 miles of the- sun's surface. It must, therefore, have rushed through the coronal or gaseous matter sur rounding the sun with a velocity approach ing 1,000,000 miles an hour, or half round the sun in less than two hours. ' d. The length of the tail has varied from about eight or ten millions to over 100,000,000, and to this must bo added the faint long extended envelope in front of the head towards tho sun, which developed itself in a most remarkable manner between the 3rd and the 7th inst The first time I noticed the formation of this outer en veloco was on the morning of the 3rd, when the nucleus was reduced to a long bright streak, the coma and tail being very bright, and the latter very sharply denned and bright on it3 Eouthern edge and curons or feathery on tho north edge. Surrounding the head, and for some distance to the rear and along the tail, was a fainter envelope forming a margin of considerable breadth. This during the fol lowing forty-eight hours extended to at least 3' from the head, with a pointed termination. ' c. The inclination of the orbit to the plane of the ecliptic is about 38°. '/. At ita ascending node it must have been between 91,000,000 and 92,000,000 miles from the earth. The longitude of the ascend ing node is about 353' 3S', the whole of the orbit, excepting where at perihelion it passes round the sun nearly_ grazing ita sur face, is south of ! the ecliptic; and as the heliocentric longitude of the earth, at the perihelin passage of tho comet waa about 355', the comet must have passed nearly between us and the sun. ' While writing about this comet it may be interesting to compare its orbit, which, by the-by, is only a first rough approximation kindly supplied by Mr. Ellery with the celebrated comets of 1G68, 1843, and 1880.

' Laugier and Mauvais assigned a period of between thirty-five and thirty-six years to the comet of 1843, but Hubbard made it 530 years, and the comet of 1880 has probably a period of thirty-six or thirty-seven years. It will be seen that these four comets have nearly identical orbits, and that all at their perihelion have rushed into dangerous proximitv to the sun— through, in fact, its coronal flames. That they must have suf fered violence for their temerity soems cer tain, and the question arises— Are they one and the same comet, or fragments of tho same body ? If the present comet is identical with that of 1880, it may, as Mr. Tebbutt sug gests, return to us again in a short space, and may perhaps fall into the sun next time. This, however, need cause no apprehension. If the comet of 1880 was identical with that of 1843, it had been reduced to a ghost of its former size. In its physical aspects the pre sent comet far more resembles 1843. Has the latter suffered a, fate similar to that of Beila, and been split into two fragments, the comets of 1880 andl882 being tho components ? 'Examining the nucleus with a spectro scope fixed on to the equatorial, I find it has a somewhat complex spectrum. The three carbon lines come out bright and strong Each band is a bundle of lines, especially the middle one, the central portion of each being brightest.
