DERWENT DISTRICT. The representation of the District of Derwent in the Legislative Council will speedily become vacant, and the present member, Captain Langdon, intimates in our columns to-day that he does not on the present occasion at any rate intend to seek a renewal of the confidence of the electors. This timely notice on the part of Captain Langdon is but in keeping with the consideration which he has at all times shown for his constituency. Family matters require his presence in England, and he is too conscientious to take with him the representation of so important a District, though, had he been so disposed, it is probable he might have done so, as an election will have to take place in November, and Captain Langdon does not leave till some months after that. Few have been longer connected with the public affairs of the Colony than the gentle artin whose present retirement from Parliamentary life is announced. He was for many years a member of the old Legislative Council, and has been in the Parliament of Tasmania continuously from the introduction of responsible Government to the present day. Though never taking a prominent part, he has been indefatigable in his attention to his parliamentary duties and as evidenced by his long public career, enjoyed the confidence of his court iuvDl». That he was always right in the ct>une he took we do not say. We have on several occasions had to differ from him. But his motives were never challenged. He followed his convictions and always acted on principle. Captain Langdon, though leaving Tasmania for a time, does not intend, as too many have done, to altogether withdraw himself from a country with which he has been so long identified. He leaves his sons to manage his business, and intends to return to Tasmania so soon as his engagements in England will permit, which will probably be about two years hence. Those who know Captain Langdon will readily believe that while in England he will allow no opportunity to pass unimproved that will permit his doing any thing for Tasmania, and we think it not improbable that when in the Mother Country he will direct his attention to the question of immigration. Though it has been too much neglected it is to the United Kingdom that we should look for immigrants likely to benefit themselves and the Colony, and if Captain Langdon can bring the advantages of Tasmania before such persons, and induce any flow of emigration to our shores, he will do Tasmania good service. PAHLMMBSTAHY.-Wo understand that an influentially signed requisition is being prepared for presentation to Mr. David Lewis, and requesting that he will consent to his being again nominated as a candidate for the representation of the electoral district of Clarence in the House of Assembly. It will be seen from our advertising columns that Mr. W. H. Cooke, one of the late city candidates, declines nomination.

The parties engaged were two young girls, the representatives, apparently, of two rival factions, who, in the presence of numerous friends of both sides, fought with an ardour and a savage determination to maim or disfigure each other, and who very nearly succeeded, the brutal affair lasting long enough to enable one of the parties to give the other a very severe beating. Two policemen were at last seen in the distance. They must have been aware of what was going on, for the noise was great enough. It is even stated, but for that we do not vouch, that their attention was drawn to the proceedings. At all events they marched on as leisurely as if they had been following the funeral of "Old John Brown." The girls saw danger approaching, and fled to their respective places of abode as the crowd separated, and the two members of the force walked quietly away, hissed by some of the more respectable persons among those who happened to be near.
