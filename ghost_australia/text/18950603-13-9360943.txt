THE UNION OF THE CHURCHES, ' SOME LAST WORDS" BY ARCHBISHOP CARR. A further contribution to the controversy on the Union of the Churches " was given by Archbishop Carr at St Patrick's Cathedral yesterday morning the Feast of Pentecost. the Archbishop took as his text St John the 7, " I will ask for and He will give you another Paraclete that he may abide with you for ever, and before beginning his address made a few remarks in connection with the feast being celebrated The following is a brief summary of the address - I think I might reasonably complain of the tone of Canon Potter's rejoinder if I did not make ample allowance for the difficulties or his position On last Sunday evening, under cover of his noisiest artillery,, he was in full retreat not only from the outposts, but from the first and second lines of his defence. He was driven back by the testimony, not oF Catholic authorities, but what is most aggravating, by the united testimony of bishops, clergymen, and laymen of his own church and by nationalists like Mr Lecky, who at least may be regarded as impartial wit- nesses in such a control errs Canon Potter may affect to disregard the authority of such a writer as " one Dr Child and to minimise the force of the Rev Mr Pocock testimony on the ground that "not one in ten thousand has ever heard" of them. He may try to get rid of Bishop Pcrowne's authoritative statements by saying that he " seems to have fallen asleep and forgotten the Ordinal though he himself declared in the Birmingham Church Congress that "he had read all the great divines of the Church of England with an especial view to this question But I beg to assure Canon Potter that if he set up such silly pleas in England, where these men art 1 known to every scholar, and recognised as of the highest authority in their respective spheres he would be simply laughed out of court I believe I am within the truth in saying, that no Anglican clergy- man of our (lay his so thoroughly investigated the crimes of the Reform tion period as Mr Pocock has done. But the truth seems to be that the learned Canon has been re- siding some cheap control trial works lately, and has not taken the trouble to consider the meaning, or want of meaning of the crude statements he found in them Having abandoned his former lines of defence, Canon Potter did not fallen luck on his list bulwarks mine!), the temporalities of the Church of 1 glared, the Book of Common Prayer, the Ordinal, and the Canons of Canterbury But in his retreat, as often happens, he has over looked many things, he has confused mum, things, and he has lost much of the war material on which he had previously relied In his retreat, too he has fired some random shots, more to keep up an appearance of resistance than to inflict injury on the enemy I am all sincerity, gave Canon Potter credit for possessing a large store of historical knowledge, but he seems bent on discrediting my good opinion of him him doubtful whether I should at all notice his allegation as to Pope St Gregory s repudiation of the title of "Universal Bishop No one with the slightest claim to scholarship would trot out, as the Canon has done, such an exploded fallacy., which only brings discredit upon the controversialist who resorts to it I have already dealt fully with this subject in m> published lecture And hour before the final attack, I wish to notice one more of the Canons missing shots The reference to the Italian Mission in 1 England has lost its tinsel by too frequent use and exposure Some more solid contribution to the continuity theory might be expected from a churchman of Canon Potter's calibre There are some memories connected with the re- establishment of the Catholic Hierarchy in England in 1890, which I would expect the Canon to be one of the last to recall. He hoists of the toleration of church and people which, 10 years after its enactment, graciously permitted an act of Parliament known as the ecclesiastical '1 lies Bill to be repealed But the Canon for flees the foul torrent of obloquy With which the Anglican Church of the day, from the Archbishop of Canterbury down to the most obscure minister, deluged the land. 'The Anglican pulpits rang with wild denunciations of every thing the Catholic holds most sacred. It was the excitement produced by those invectives that placed CardinaL by rai man's life in imminent peril, and consigned to the felon s dock England a most illustrious son, John Henry New muM. from such toleration kind Heaven forfend us! And all the time there was no more Papal aggression on the cart of Pius IX. in re-establishing the Catholic hierarchy in 1860 than there was on the part of it Gregory in 597, a lien The sentry. Augustine to plant the first Italian mission in Cantcrhnr). This establishment of the Catholic hierarchy Canon Potter regards as barring the claim to Catholic continuity, while on the other hand possession, no matter how obtained, seems to him to cons. tute a sufficent title to Anglican continuity. In the eye of the civil law, I admit, the Anglican church must claim continuity with the church of St Augustine Canon Potter thinks that he has found, in the recent debate in the Imperial Parliament on the Welsh Church Disestablishment Hill, a continuation of his temporalities continuity argument. But a little learning is a dangerous thing, and a too cursory perusal of a newspaper report is apt to lead one into serious misapprehend casions The Canon quotes Mr Asquith as controverting the statement of Lord Rosebery), that " if the right of mile feasible and ancient property rests anywhere in these endowments it rests not with the reformers but with the Roman Catholics,' and as denying that any act of Parliament formally " transferred the endow- events of the Church of Rome to the Church of 1 England " But the Gamon forgets that Mr. Asquith contradicts his own continuity The orb) proposing to leave to the Dis- established church only the private endow- ments created since 1701 again, the Canon has quite overlooked the important fact, that one of the strongest contentions of the Government of which Lord Rosebery is the head, completely upsets the continuity theory 'little Mr G Russell said - "Surely the Thirty Nine Articles embodies an entirely different BJ item of theory.) from that which prevailed in the | rr Reformation Church, and I 1 annot convince any sell that the persons to be made gifts to the Church in modi 1 val times would have I cqlioatlicil their land had they 1 now in that as a body the Church was about to rebel against the body of Peter Mr. Balfour, the leader of Her Majesty's Opposition, did not rest the claim of the Anglican body to the old endowments on Knob a foundation as the continuity theory. He- took the shifting but safer line, in which he had been anticipated by Mr. Matthews, of resting the claim on a prescription of 300 years. but the Chancellor of the Exchequer, in a few sledge-hammer sentences pulverised the continuity chums. With keenest irony Sir William Harcourt observed " Some chapters in church history are now entirely omitted. There is one event which in former days was considered of some importance, which has entirely diuaiircarcd. It l8thooiont.»»hiolitieedloba heroines the Protestant Reformation. On reading the defence of the Church Defence Association, you would imagine that Henry VIII. never existed, that Edward VI. was a minor, that Mary Tudor of blessed memory never show ed, and that, Elizabethans or reigned. All these personages, so far as church and state are concerned, have disappeared from the scene, Nothing material happened to the church and state in the sixteenth century, or nothing that mattered par- ticular!). Everything; is just as it was before, and the church of to day is exactly the church of the period before reformation in doctrine, and discipline, and in the whole relation still the state. It is like the axe which had more road and a new handle, but was always the same axe." Having disposed of Canon Potter's Tem political argument, I proceed to examine the complaint, which he advances in the following terms. He says : "If I wanted to know what the Church of Rome thought about herself there would I seek for Information ? Of course, In her on an authoritative texts the creed of Pope Pius, the catechism of the Council of Trent, and the successive definitions of doctrine made by the Papal face." Canon Potter refers me to the preface of the Anglican Ordinal published in 1902, in which these words are found : " It is evident unto men diligently reading the Holy Scripture and ancient authors that from the Apostles' time there have been these orders of ministers In Christ's church, bishops, priests, and deacons." And then he adds that the document goes on to provide for the making, ordaining, and consecrating of bishops, priests, and deacons, and enacts that no one shall hold such office unless he be so made, ordained, or consecrated. As Canon Potter attaches so much importance to the preface and text of the Ordinal, and complains so demonstratively of my over-looking them, I will now devote to them somewhat lengthened consideration. Fortunately, we have the most indisputable evidence of the meaning attached to the words by those who were mainly responsible for the compilation of the Ordinal. Cranmer, Archbishop of Canterbury, the chief author of the Anglican Ordinal, absolutely denied the necessity of episcopal consecration, and maintained that, Both for priests and bishops. Blmplo appointment or election was sufficient. Sandys, afterwards Archbishop of York, absolutely denies the existence of any priesthood in the New Dispensation! except a spiritual one. In these testimonies we have the mind of the compilers of the Ordinal, and their views were consistently held by t< Anglican bishops for more than half a ora- . J tory. We begin with Parker, Elizabeth's Aus t t Archbishop of Canterbury. He deemedeleo«v'M* I don and appointment insolent to waste itself j priesthood or episcopate witiiMI^OidiMU tion or consecration Hammond, commis vary to the Deanery of Arches, an official of M lntgirt Elizabethan Archbishop of Canterbury, and therefore a most excellent witness of the law and theology of the age, gives similar testimony. Hooker felt that a claim to unbroken Apoi local succession would be fatal to the Anglican Church so he declared, " We are not simply without exception to urge a lineal descent from the apostles by continued succession of bishops in every effectual oriana tion The admitted the power of the church to take away the episcopal government for the reason that it existed " by force of custom and not by Divine appointment ' And on the question of orders he expressly said, "there may he some time very just and sufficient reason to allow ordination made without a bishop I could go on calling witness after witness, pile testimony upon testimony, but I would only weary you with the monotony of the et dence 1 he simple truth is that Apostoh cul Succession was treated as a jest ly high Church and low Church, till in the middle of the seventeenth century Dissenters began to dispute the Anglican pretensions to supre mercy, and then there was a sudden rush to the defence of orders that for two genera- tions had been a mockery an 1 a seam Dr Elliot Dean of Bristol, tell us the 25th article repudiates it as a fiction altogether that God has annexed peculiar grace and authority to the imposition of hands Buccssit i y from the apostle s or to any other arbitrary form of ordination whatever Canon Potter says that not one in ten thousand han limit of Mr Pocock Well, he will hardly up at this of Mr 1 Froude who makes the satin accusation against 1 live bethan Aiisrhean bishops in almost the same Words He says - The bishops themselves Died as If the linen their day to be a short one and made the most of their opportunities i while they lasted been Famous dilapidations destruction of woe Is waste of the pro perty of the seas I v I milking lenses each Incuint ent enriching 1 himself and his family at the expense of his s icccoEors this is the substantial history of the Anglican literary hp with a few honourable exceptions for the first "years of Its audience Guion Potter also refers me to the Book of Common Prij el I and in the Order for the Visitation of the back, this direction - Here shall the sick person he met oil to make a Bpconl c wife sion of his his if he and his conscience troubled with ally well lit) matter after which con lesson tic I nest shall absolve him (If c limit It and heartily desire it after this sort Our Lord Jesus Christ who hath kf power to His Church to absolve all sinners who true HE it as I believe in him of His real utility forgive thee Illino offences And I by His authority comes it I ed to me lal solid price from all thy sins in the Nane of the I other, and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost Amen to doubt I find this power claimed by a host of Anglican divines Huon the other hand the line hygiene can describe the foul invective that name from Anglican pulpit, platform, and press against this divine small station and its nlmiiiistrtitmn by theCatlioha Church ' And Cunnii Potter suggests a most decisive proof of the purely verbal character of this continuity He commits himself to this representation of history - '"You time an unbroken on sure sion of Archbishops of Canter! bury all the well He then fired a period Mur ham died and emu and succeeded him Ci miner was burnt and Pole succeeded him 1 one died and I arker Bilccicdel hint 1 ich was consecrated according to the Nicene Cation by three episcopal consecration at least I each was the successor of St Augustine except on one theory which, as he explains requires the " leave of the Pope, for the consecration of a bishop Canon Potter has told us that unqualified submission to the Roman Pontiff is the barrier that separates the Anglican Church from the CatE one or as he would put it, the Roman Church We shall see how far the words I have quoted from him will hear examination in the light of his own statement, and the historic evidence I shall now adduce If the four archbishops mentioned by Canon Potter W arliiun and Pole represented the old, Cramer and Parker the new religion Archbishop Warburn died in 12, at 1 on his deathbed protested his allegiance to the Pope of home But it is with his oath of allegiance to the Holy See I am now concerned, and Mr Pocock does not hesitate to write thus - ' Of course it would be possible to defend the break up. of an oath after it had been made by the altered circumstances of the chance of view of the party who the es the oath Unfortunately in the case of the oath taken by Cnuuicr at his son Bccration there is no loophole of this kind.

Dr Rentoul, moderator of the General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church, delivered a lecture before a very large congregation on " The Catholic Church ' He took his text from Corinthians chapter 12, verses 1, C, b, 12 and 20 -" Now there are diversities of gifts, but the same spirit, and there are diversities of ministra- tions but the same Lord, and there are diversities of working, but the same God, for, as the body is one and hath many men here, so also has Christ Now there are many members but one body " And, again, in Ephesians, chapter 4 verse 4 -"'There is one body and one spirit, and again in Ephesians, the same chapter, verse 16, " The fund ever Christ, from W horn and the body had trained together maketh increase of the body unto the building up of soil in late Like all true thinkers, St Paul saw unity in diversity and diversity in unity in the new eaaentinlB there was unity joining (hrlsUnni! central.) and lot family together 'Hu one hath dirt and of the many motions and ministrations of the one bed) There was no not of uniformity minds by Almighty God in living nature or living Christianity There was inner unity but always outer duncan., and this was seen in the early Christian ohmoh At first there was no definite form of (tot morning at laid down for the Church of Christ The early church adopted the simple model of the Jewish congrega- tion in its weekly worship, and new features were added just as necessity arose, for the Church of Christ had of I way 8 the power of instituting new methods of administration, 'the Lord said, "Wherever two or three are gathered together in My name there am I with them " That was the living Church of Christ One of the Apostles' favourite illustration of this unity in diversity was that human body-one body with many members Wherever Christ Jesus was there was the Catholic Charon In his address to the assembly he replied to Bishop 'Thornton that he rejoiced at all signs and tokens of any closer relationship of the churches of God in Christ it only those signs were real and he ventured to point out that closer relation- ship between the various Protestant churches could come only in terms of mutual respect and full recognition of their common churchmanship. It could never come by one section of Protestant tin istendom, and that the smallest, calling itself the Church, and all others bodies. He pointed out that in the New Neat intent there was no such word as " bodies" in the plural at any time applied to God's Church There is is only body spoken of in the scriptures of food, while there was, at the same time, the word " church " in the singular, honour included all the congregations and that was the one body of Olirmt All the Protestant churches were part of that one body, and, more than that he acknowledged the Roman and Greek Catholic churches as part of that great one Catholic Church Some of their finest linen were given to them by men of the Roman Catholic Church, the man who sang, "Jesus the very thought of Thee with sweetness fills my breast, was nearer to them than they were to any godless, lifeless Presbyterian within their midst they would unite in fellowship with all Christian churches, but would reject the assumption that the Roman Catholic Church was the only Catholic Church. This question had been brought on them by the Pope, who was a good man, and was now apparently on courted by the spread of ritualism and Romanism in the Church of England, It was only fragments of the Pope's wonderful letter that Bishop 1 honiton and Canon Potter had replied to, and had they seen the complete letter is now available their replies would have been very different, The Roman Church did not recognise the ordination of Anglican clergymen, and the Anglican clergymen did not recognise his ordination The one test for all Christians was the New testament, which gave no warrant for episcopacy. There was no hierarchical bishop in the last century, and the church of the second century had no resemblance whatever to modem episcopacy. St Ignatius was the first to use the expression "Catholic Church, and it just meant the general New testament. Church. In the Church of Ignatius there was no altar, no presence except Christ's presence spiritual!), no priest except in so far as every Christian was a priest In fact, there was an utter absence of anything that made the Roman Church distinctive!) women and episcopacy distinctive of episcopate) The Pope in his letter wanted to bring England back to the mother church, and his proposal simply meant absorption.
