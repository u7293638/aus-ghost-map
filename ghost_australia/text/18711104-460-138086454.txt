THE SKETCHER. ? - p -? ?" MAOBI-LAHD. '. (oohtujckd) I By HmxTiSE TE Tawx&A.; -j Concerning tbe Maori theory of tbe'appear* ance of spirits in the daytime, I have known some strange instances myself. These daytime spirits areata}ost always oi an evil.deposition, and while usually invisible themielvw, con trive to make their presence acknowledged in> more unpleasant forms ? than morel visual apparitions. One instance of the violence and mischief of these wandering daylight " kekokekos" I particularly remember. It happened abonta oouple of rammers ago, on ai>ot Deoemberday. v> W aim (a native woman, earning hsrlittle brown baby)abd 'I «et oatinche<nbMifg to> go to the potato-gronnd to fetch nme 'iieir itatoes, land likewise «ome old ones from the . it year's pit*.

The wife of an oldchief of the tribe (or father, that small section of the great, tribe) had long been suffering from some lingering disease. A little spare.woman Parawakatoo. had always been, and doping the -many months of her lying on theflix mats .in the whare she had grown as light and shrivelled up as a mummy. Several times we had been over to see the. old found her the same,; course ; she _ (motionless day .by day.
