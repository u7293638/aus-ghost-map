Fortunately a cart happened to be passing by, in which His Excellency conveyed his daughter honia. Miss Jervois recovered cozuciousueas shortly after her arrival at Govern ment House, and is reported to be making favourable progress. Ccstomo Dctiks.— In anticipation that the Treasurer's Budget speech would indicate sorce alterations in the Customs tariff, an unusual quantity of good3 was cleared from bond during the last few days preceding the day fixed for the financial statement. At the Customs Office in Adelaide for the week ending August 2, £1,202 10s. 9d. was paid; for the succeeding two days, £2,711 5a. 3d. This amount was collected mainly on sparkling wines, spirits, and especially unmanufactured tobacco. A large quantity of the same articles was cleared at the Port, where £3,700 11s. 80\. was paid in dutie s on Monday ; but, as will be seen elsewhere, the alarmists were deceived, as tie Treasurer has no intentisa of touching the Customs in his endeavour to increase the revenue. Sale of City Pbopbhtt. — On Thursday Messrs. Green k Co. sold the block of land, having a frontage of twenty feet to King Wil liam-street, on which the offices of Green & Co. stand, at £260 per foot, subject to the existing lesee, which has about ten years to run. The DrKE of ED»BBEGa's Birthday.— The anniversary of the Duke of Edinburgh's Biithday (Wednesday, Augnst 6) w»s observed as a general holiday throughout the country The weather in town was gloriously fine — being it every respect such as giadd'ecs the hearts 01 those who love to seize the opportunity afforded by the somewhat frequent occurrence of our colonial file days to enjoy themselves in the op«n air. Hud the ' Clerk' who is supposed to regulate the blowing of the wind and the falling of the rain been consulted by holiday-makers on the subject he could not cave complied with their wishes more completely. There were not eo many means of relaxation provided, however, as are generallj presented on these anniver saries, the Exhibition Building grounds, for a wonder, remaining in their work-day quietness. The principal attraction waa the military sports on the Oval, which were largely attended, the Newmarket Kaces, on the Mcrphettville Course, beiig the only other public amusement. The Botanic Gardens, which have now a beautifully fresh appearance, had a large cumber of visitors in the afternoon. In the evening, in additiou to the ordinary representation of Jace Shore's woes at the Theatre Eoyal and of the ghost's vagaries at White's Rooms, au eutertiiument was given at the Town Hail, and a military ball was held at the Town Hall, Norwood. Football — A team of footballers from Geelong paid a visit io South Australia on July 19, staying in the colony about ten days, and playing during that period four matches, against the Norwood, Victorian, and Port Clubs and an associated team, all of which they won. The Geelong men appear to have reached the very acme of football-play, their kicking, running, and marking being almost perfection. Their perfect organization also contributed greatly to their success. The only team that made any stand against the visitors were the Norwoods, our premier club, and the game between them and the Geelongs was one of the most exciting and interesting yet played in the colony. The Glkselo Bailmtat Compact axd Mb. B Boothby. — A special meeting of shareholders in this Company was held on Tnesday. July 22, to consider a claim by Mr. B. Boothby for £2,153 8s. 8d., the balance said to be due to him for engineer's commission on the construction of the line. A w solution was passed, approving the determination of the Di ectors io resist to the utmost the 'extraordinary claim,'' which had never been heard of from February, 187:.' (when Mr. Bootbby accepted the position of engineer and manager, at £300 per aiinnni .salary), until a. ft w days ago. Messrs. Symon atd Bake'well, as solicitors for Mr. B. Bcothby, have obtained judgment by default ajraicsi the Glecelg Itiilwar Company in tne suit broogV:t b;. their client for £2,155 6s. £d , the bahace alleged to be due to him for engineer's conirci«sion oa the conitruc tiou of the line. The ccfendan:.-' solicitor*, having made a mistake in the dite on which picas were to be pat is. oxitted to furuUh tctm, and coEseqaently judgment; ei..^uel as above. We belitve, however, that the judg ment has cow been set sj; *e. Ihfosted Sroci. — The Invercauld has brought a splendid entire, three cows, an I three bulls — the whole having been selected at hoEe with the especial iutention of irc proiirg the stock of this province. The Invercacld possesses a £se rcorsv de?k, and is otherwise peculiarly suitable 'for carrvisg 3tock— a fact whi:h Las beta proved by 'the admirable order in which the animals hi7e arrived. The cattle occupied a large hoa*e over the main hatchway, while the Lsrse is stowed before the fore deckhouse. Mr. Hart pureimftd the Clydesdale at Glasgow, giving a Urge sum for him en acrosT-t of the repetition be possessed of beizg tiie best horse is Seatliai. Hs took third priz* at the Glasgow Show, ar.d also tbird prize at the HignUad Secietj'* Show as a two-ye*r-old. The creature, though of immense size, U per fectly docile, aud when put on board walked round the decks from one side to the other before reachicg the bor. The cattle are in equally good order, aud by breeders will be con sidered a valuable additiou to the stock of the COloLV. As Extraordijuht Hvosn.—Ou Mondsy afternoon. August 4, a young woman named Adelaide Froude, diiughttr ot a railway porter residing at Glanville, was found lying on tue Semaphore Beach in a semi-insensible and ex hausted coLditiou. Upon the police being com municated with, she told an extraordinary and improbable story. She stated that she was iu the service of the Kev. K S Casely, of Adelaide, and that after spending the Sunday at Lome with her parents she returned to town by the S 'JO p m. train. In town she alleged she was met by a young man named Hcrace Grenvilie, a former lover, who rendered her insensible by the application of chloroform, and couvejed htr away iu a cab. When she re covered consciousness *be found herself tossing on the sea in a small boat, and when ber abductor saw that she was awake he again accosted her, and asked her to consent to be his wife. When she refused he row and attempted to attike her, but the boat giving a lurch at the moment he lost his balance and fell into the sea, the oai-s being lost at the same time. She driUtd ashore near Brighton, and -Urted to walk towards the Port, a distance of over twelve miles, acd fell down exhausted at the spot where she was found. In the meantime her father had received a letter, purporting to be signed by Horace Grenville, i-tatiug that he bad ensnared his daughter in a trap. The story appeared to be very impro bable, but the police thought it to be their duty to make enquiry into the matter. A yoang man earned Kae, who left Pert Adelaide for Natal by the schooner Coorong, was supposed to be mixed up in the affair, as Miss Froude was engaged to him. There is no boat missing, neither does any one but the girl know anything about Grenville, who is supposed to be a mythical personage, and whose description, strange to say, tallies in a general way with that of Ka». The girl's statement is therefore dis credited in many particulars, although it has been ascertained that she actually did come to town by the S3Q train, and that she was found 011 the Brighton Beach at 3 a.m. on the following (Monday) morning, when she told a different tale to the man who found her. A medical man h*s reported that she is of exci table temperament and subject to hysterical hallucinations. The schooner Coorong baa called in at Port Pirie, en route for Natal, and Kae bss been communicated with, but he states 'that he can throw no light on the affair, as he had not seen the girl since !) o'clock on the night of the previous Friday. All other scraps of evidence collected show that the girl has been romancing, but nothing wliat ever has as yet transpired which can throw light npon the motives that actuated her in manufacturing this strange fictional record.

H. Angas. They were examiocd by Mr. CLalwin, veterinary surgeon, who uro concced them to be healthy. After being dis infected they were were placed on a pontoon prepared for the purpose, and conveyed to the quarantine station. The pontoon was taken ciose to the land, and the cattle walked ashore ou a sheet stage scarcely wetting their feet, the landing being conducted most successfully. la consequence of the animals arriving before the contractor had finished the election of the neces sary build legs, the arrangements for their recep tion were far from complete, but the works are being urged forward, and every endeavour is being made to render the cattle as comfortable as possible.
