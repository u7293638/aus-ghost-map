Mr. Heydon and WentwÂ©rth. Was it Ajekeemus Waed who told the story of the spirit medium, whose inquiry as to whether a spirit which he had invoked was that of Lindley Mubeay was answered with a solemn '* It are ?' Mr. Heydon's reference in the Legislative Council last night, to the celebrated name of Went woeth was slightly suggestive of that remarkable instance of 'dialogues with the dead.' Mr. Heydon declared that if Wentwoeth were here to-day he would be one of the strongest opponents of Federation, a piece of information which, however, was received with as much irreverent scepticism by most of Mr. Heydon's fellow legislators as, it is to be pre sumed, had been inspired in the case of the gentleman who called up the ghost of the grammarian. In fact, Mr. Heydon was laughed at, as well he might have been, when, with portentous gravity? he asserted that Wentwoexh would have shared each views as his on the subject of Federation. Chabees T.A^ra wondered whether a ghost could laugh. If such a thing l?e i possible Mr. Hexdon-. certainly .gavje ample provocation for it; and one might ^easily believe that the laughter which, reverberated in the Council Oham bejf was heartily echoed by Wejtcwoeth in H|des.- - ';'~ ,'.., '-.'.'''. , . .
