THE OCTOBER QUARTERLIES. The Qitiitcrhj opens with an article about Sir Walter Raleigh which it is a pleasure to read, not because the writer has anything now to say, but because of the appreciative spirit and tone in which the article is written Raleigh, says the TV area, belongs to that select number who are not merely written about by historians, but who have entered into the popular imagination and dwell there is by right " The enigmatic and versatile figure has captivated posterity," writes Stebbing in his biography issued last year And most readers with a spark of romance in them will agree with this writer when he says that we can form the age of Elizabeth to be wanting in many a home which meets as often in the State papers and is yet insignificant, but no effort will con j are away that of the pirate and the courier, the Devon adventurer with his broad west-country accent and his mixture of policy and poetry, whom we see taking the air as on the same high Terrace with Sponsor and Shakespeare, their equal in the quality of his mind " We get in these pages one of those personal portraits of which an historical and literary gallery could be collected from the pages of the Quartet ty The last scene at Westminster is admirably treated 1 We read how Sir Walter, on the fatal morning, " took tobacco, and made no more of his death than if it It had been to take a journey " He sit down in view of the block, near which a fire had been lighted, in being a cold morning, and with imperturbable good humour and present with proceeded to state his case against his enemies "This," says the water in concluding his description, is the high-water mark of human greatness, unequalled by any death scene in Shakespeare " Professor Freoinau's ' History of Sicily " suggests an article, and a j) oper about " The Equatorial Andes and Mountaineering " is based on Whymper's recent book and another It is asserted here that alcohol does not keep out the cold or help the exhausted mountaineer, as was formerly supposed "Homer and Recent Discoveries" is on ox animation in the light of the Sohliemcnn excavations into the question as to whether Homer described a re a state of society and civilisation, or merely pictures thrown back by fancy on the mist of forgotten times "The discussion," says the writer at the close of a careful paper, " might be produced to any length, and would still leave us in wandering mazes lost" Dr Birkbeck Hills book is again drawn on for an article about "Dr Johnson's Letters " Johnson was the last of " the scholars," says the w later. He belonged to the class of Lrosnms Scahgor, and Bentley, and the line in Murphy which describes, him as retiring after the publication of "Rasselas" to me in the Inner Temple " in poverty, total idleness, and the pride of literature " is said to hit him off admirably Like a knight of old, we read, he would from time to time twist a link of his gold chain to supply his pressing needs, but no more and we can almost fancy him to have lived before the age of printing "The Development of Dress is an interesting paper, and there is something road able under the title of Troy oiling Naturalists in the Old World " The question of rapid transit in London is extensively considered, and the operations of Russia in the Pamirs receive attention in a valuable paper under the title " Russia, India, and Afghanistan" The political article, "The new Government," indulges freely in the prophecy that Mr Gladstone is sowing the wind of which his successors are to reap the whirlwind The 1 diitbttrvh gives up its first pages to a review of the non G Curzon's "Persia and the Persian Question," of which subject the writer says that the eloquence of the Greek dramatists and historians combines with the long succession of striking a history events to invest it with into rest Mr Curzon says the reviewer, writes like a master of the not outs connected with the political and commercial destiny of Persia The main interest of the subject, according to his estimate, lies in the value of Persia to the Government of India especially if Afghanistan were to become useless to us from the hostility of its ruler, or from confusion arising through the death or weakness of the Ameer An article about " Morell's Italian Painters " is full of interesting gossip about pictures and painters, and of the business of the art critic, who, like Morclh, must be born and not made. The Duc d Aumalo's recent book furnishes matter for an article on " the Princes of the House of Conde " The book is described as a " noble addition to the history of France " in a paper about Mediterranean Politics" the writer asserts that the magnitude of their interest to Great Britain is indisputable Incidentally it is mentioned that as a fighting Power Franco is unquestionably the most powerful nation in the world at the present moment, but it is extremely improbable that she can ever succeed in her expressed desire of making the western basin of the Mediterranean a French lake The " Memoirs of the Verney family" supply an interesting article on the fortune of this house in the seventeenth century, during the period of the F irhamontarv wars, and in " Marshal Saxe and the Marquis d'Argenson " wo got another study in French history " Population " is the title of an article suggested by the late edition of the " Statesman's Year Book " and other publications, in the course of which the writer shows that it is thovaluabloolemont in the British population which is ready to emigrate and which the colonies are ready to receive We are face to face with the fact, he says that every year sees a heavy drain on our most industrious workers, whilst the lazy, the aimless, and the vicious are left to increase and multiply He concludes with the question, " Can nothing be done to retain within our borders that indispensible part of the community which now leaves our shores in such large numbers to seek elsewhere a happiness and prosperity which, right ly or wrongly, it conceives to bodoniodto it here?" A paper on " Biblical Criticism of the Old Testa- ment " will be found interesting by those who have followed Canon Dnvor's speculations The writer holds very strongly that sacred books that will not bear critical investigation can hardly be regarded as worthy of serious notice. He doubts if a deeply interesting investigation, when once fairly started, can be stopped abruptly by any timid person who may draw a line across the path- way with his umbrella After the number of imaginary death- blow to the Christian faith which have been safely survived, he asks, why should not survival and even improvement be anticipated from a brave and calm handling of the new critical discoveries which have recently been committed to our trust * An article on the " Post Office Savings Bank " tra- verses the history of the movement, which its writer regards as the best form of provision for old age " The Scottish Union " and " A ' Nebulous Hypothesis ' " are the titles of two other articles, that of the latter being suggested by Mr Gladstone's remark that his Government could only be tested by its words and acts, and not while it re- im mod a nebulous hypothesis The 1 English historical Rn tew has articles about Pope Sylvester II, the Church of the Resurrection clerical preferment under the Duke of Now cast on, and Fortune Grogoronns, besides the usual reviews of books Scribner for October has some very elaborately illustrated articles about the " Making of the White City " at Chicago, the pictures being by W T Smedley, whose work is not unknown in this part of the world. The " White City," of course, is the World's Fair, and the article gives a very striking impression of the magnitude of the building operations carried on There are some verses and some stones, among these latter being the third of Octave Thanet "Stories of in Western Town" The reader who is interested in social work will find something to occupy his attention in the sixth article in the series, " The Poor in Great Cities," being Edmund R Spearman's paper on "A School for Street Arabs '' It describes the D'Alembort School, near Paris, where a succession of Parisian papers are boarded, lodged, clothed, and trained to trades, when they go to take their places in society as self-supporting citizens of the State Author such paper deals with " The Education of the Deaf and Dumb " on the principle of what is known as the Combined System-that is, by adopting the method of the Abbe deFEnce, which employs signs and gestures, and that of Samuel Hointcke, who taught through speech Holding that the " written word is only the representation of articulate sound," he undertook to teach his pupils by the motion of the lips There is a paper on romantic painting in French art, and another about the launching of cruisers and battle ships Andrew Lang has a good article about the Home question, written in the light of the recent discoveries, and Dr Slade writes about the first operation under other A curious article called " Thomas Jefferson in Undress " presents the reader with some pages of the diary of the American Constitu shoe-maker, and the paragraphs under the heading of "The Point of View" are as readable as usual Cornhill has a paper about the peerage in China, which reads as grotesque a piece of rending as most descriptions of the customs of the people in that quarter of the globe As a rule, says the writer, it is the heroic ghost who gets the title, because to achieve one the candidate must either take a town from the rebels, or, what is equally efficacious, com- mit suicide when the robins are taking it from him But even a title does not, like a literary degree, protect the holder from indiscriminate bamboo ings, administered on an ignominious portion of his person, adds this playful contributors An article about Mount Etna describes a ramble up the famous volcano The reader who cares to test how far he may have become blind to the pathetic in literature might do worse than read the sketch entitled " A Pair of Lovers " in this number For unaffected natural feeling and truth to nature, or for touching simplicity of moment and story, it would be hard to excel those half-score of pages The serials are continued in this number
