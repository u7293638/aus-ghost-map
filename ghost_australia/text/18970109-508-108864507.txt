LONDON WEEK BY WEEK. (By Emily Soldene.) December 4,1896. Christmas is coming. A week ago we thought it was to be an old-fashioned Christmas, with frost and snow, with jolly snowballing for the boys, with a snow giant in the back yard, with skating and skaters, with manufactured and well worked-up slides on the side walk to catch un- wary old ladies and gentlemen, with crisp bright joyous bells ringing through the dry stimulating air— a nice, old-time Christmas, with burning logs, mulled elderberry wine and a toast in it, the hedges blazing with hips and haws, with Robin redbreasts on every windowsill, and hun- gry sparrows cheeping on every doorstep; with home-gathered sloes in gin, and home-gathered cherries in brandy; with snapdragon and for- feits with baking chestnuts bursting themselves with rage in the hot ashes; with roasting apples “sis-sing” and dangling dangerously at the end of a string, anxious to tumble into the smoking ale with crowds of children huddling round the fire listening, with wide-open mouths and terri- fied eyes, to ancient and true ghost and goblin stories handed down from father to son — a Christmas to be made memorable by unaccus- tomed chilblains, red noses, and frost-bitten wrists. All these delights were anticipated up to Wednesday morning. * * * * Tuesday night people went to bed weary with polishing up their skates, went to bed after a last look at a brilliant star-lighted sky, electric with the sparkling promise of a more than com- mon frosty to-morrow. * * * * Alas and alack! Wednesday morning was a warm, steaming muddle of yellow fog; big drops of rain beat upon the window panes. The rain has rained ever since; all hopes of frost are abandoned; the skaters are overwhelmed with despair— a damp, and slushy, and muddy despair. * * * * For myself, I must confess that in my secret heart I rejoice. I hate the cold weather. Frost and snow and slides are to me abominable. When these glacial conditions exist I invariably, incontinently and against my will, sit down in the face of the people and in the middle of the street. * * * * During the cold weather it was a distinctly comforting thing to read that Mrs. John Mackay, the Californian silver queen, drives about Paris in a sable cloak made of 10,000 finest Russian sable skins, the value of the garment being esti- mated at £3000. * * * * The loveliest sable I ever saw came from China. I had a relative, a member of the Lon- don Missionary Society. He was sent to China to missionise, and had not been gone long when there arrived at the paternal habitat in Soho Square the most precious of garments, the bro- caded wrap of a mandarin, lined with the softest, most beautiful, and nearly black sable. * * * * This was years ago, and, naturally, after see- ing the robe, all of us girls were seized with a wild desire to go a-missioning to China. * * * * Apropos of the recent cold snap, I heard a funny story. A gentleman from Brisbane on a visit to England succumbed to the weather, and in spite of every care and attention died. His friends, mindful of his heretofore environments, thought it would be more in accordance with his own feelings were he cremated instead of being buried, besides the little terra cotta casket con- taining the ashes could without difficulty he sent to his sorrowing widow in Australia. * * * * The cremation took place, and during the pro- cess one of the attendants had occasion to open the door of the crematorium, when a voice was heard from the interior: “For God’s sake, close that door. Don’t you know there’s an infernal draught in this place ?” * * * * The Queen was driving along the Old Windsor road the other day with the outrider on a sleek horse cantering gaily before, when it happened that a donkey-cart— a small, humble vehicle, drawn by a neddy of obscure pedigree— stood right in the way of her Majesty’s impatient steeds. The bystanders and the owner of the moke saw the grey horses and the august equi- page coming, and made frantic efforts to get the ass and cart “out of the gangway” in time. In vain ! * * * * The creature stuck its ground as firmly as if a nail had been driven through each obstinate hoof and into the solid earth below ! Fortu- nately, an officer of the Guards and an intelligent youth from Windsor came on the scene at the critical moment. * * * * Then the officer and the boy took the moke and the cart up bodily, and lifted them clean out of Royalty’s way, just in time! And won the very sweetest smile and bow of thanks from her Majesty. * * * * It has been within the last few days stated pub- licly that her Majesty has become “a teetotaller,” in consequence of “the severe pains in her knees,” which alcohol is supposed to aggravate. * * * * As all the world knows, her Majesty’s favorite beverage has always been Scotch whisky well di- luted; and, as she has been more or less lame for several years, it would have been somewhat sin- gular that she did not become a teetotaller long ago if the statement were true. Castle officials smile in a knowing way at the assertion, and it may be taken that our Sovereign Lady still re- mains faithful to the national beverage of the country she loves so well. * * * * It is more than hinted that “The United King- dom Alliance” started this canard. * * * * Last Friday was a great day at Blenheim. H.R.H., accompanied by his host and the house party, drove off in the sunshine to Burley Wood and Brandon Heath for pheasant shooting. The birds were so plentiful that nearly a thousand brace were bagged; and at mid-day the Princes- ses and other ladies joined the sportsmen, and lunch was served in a tent. * * * * In the evening all the notabilities from far and near came to make their bow at the Duchess of Marlborough’s grand reception, when her Grace received them in the third saloon, resplendent in white velvet trimmed with sable, black velvet, and priceless lace. Diamonds blazed on her head in a coronet, and a pearl and diamond belt was clasped round her waist. The little Duke, in the uniform of the Queen’s Own Oxfordshire Hussars, looked like a midget. * * * * The Princesses were superbly dressed, and her Royal Highness the Princess of Wales made a great show of diamonds. * * * * H.R.H., in his uniform as Colonel of the “Queen’s Own Hussars,” was buttoned up very tightly indeed, and looked as if letting out a reef would have been no end of a comfort to him. * * * * Apropos of diamonds : Great excitement was caused at Clarence House on Tuesday night by the supposed loss of the jewels belonging to the Duch- ess of Saxe-Coburg. Her Royal Highness ar- rived at Clarence House in the evening from her visit to the Queen. The usual large quantity of luggage travelled with her in charge of the la- dies’ maids. In the hurry of unloading, the case containing jewels of the value of several thous- ands of pounds was left behind. * * * * After no end of a rumpus and a fuss— somebody thought of the railway omnibus — off flew a long string of Royal flunkeys, and oh, joy! in an old stable found the “ ’bus,” and under the ’bus seat they found the box, and in the box they found the treasure, and, as I before observed, “Oh joy!” * * * * Talk about the long arm of coincidence. Here’s a strange case. The day after the Royal guests left Marlborough, Sandringham House, the bou- doir of the Princess got on fire, and on Wednesday, about 12.30 p.m., a fire broke out in the Grand Salon at Blenheim. * * * * Smoke was observed coming down through the ceiling, on which is the famous allegorical paint ing by Laguerre, representing the career of the first Duke of Marlborough. The flames were confined to the roof, which was greatly damaged. The massive timbers are ex- tensively charred, and in some places tbe roof is open to the sky. The fire is attributed to a defective flue. It is feared that the ceiling may fall, as pieces of plaster and marble are constantly dropping into the room from the cornice. The duke and duchess were not at home at the time. * * * * “The Life and Letters of Sir Charles Halle” are just out, and are full of entertainment and anec- dote. Charles Halle was born at Hagen, in West- phalia, 1819. His father was musical director of the local concerts, and organist of the principal church. Charles was a prodigy, and at the age of 11 years wielded the baton at the opera per- formances given in the ball-room of the principal hotel. This is what happened at a representation of “Don Giovanni”: In the first act, when the Commendatore steps out of his bouse to chastise Don Giovanni, and gets killed for his pains, in- stead of being accompanied by servants with torches, he only carried a candle, which he let fall when drawing his sword. This unfortunate candle kept burning on the ground in dangerous prox- imity to the side scenes, but nobody perceived it except the dead Commandatore, who, being the director of the company and proprietor of all the scenery, etc., tried in his anxiety, by grunts and whispers, to draw the attention of somebody to the impending danger, and, not succeeding, de- liberately sat up, put the candle put with a wetted finger, and lay down again, dead as before. * * * * Halle tells of the condition of English manners and taste in 1843. Seems to me that up to this — 1896 — no improvement has been made in either. * * * * ‘ I had brought a few letters of introduction with me, one of which was to a most amiable man, a member of Parliament, who a few years later rose to a high position in the Government. I had left the letter at his house with my card, and he called upon me the very next day, was charming, most kind, and, to my great satisfaction, spoke French most fluently. He knew from the letter it was my wish to be heard, and as it so happened that he had a large evening party, two days later, he proposed that I should play a few pieces during the evening, saying that I should meet many in- fluential people, with whom I would certainly be glad to make acquaintance. I accepted readily. When he withdrew he turned back at the door and said, “Might I ask you in what style you play?” I was puzzled, and could not give a clear answer. He next asked. “Do you know Mr. Alexander Dreyschock?” “Yes,” I said, “he is an admirable and powerful pianist.” “Do you play in his style?” “No, I can conscientiously say that my style differs from his.” “Oh, I am so glad,” said my friend, “for he plays so loud, ‘et cela empeche les dames de causer’ ” (and that hinders the ladies talking). I meekly sug- gested that no music at all might perhaps be more to the purpose, but he would not hear of that, insisted upon my coming, and I did go, played two pieces, and can give myself credit for not having “empeche les dames de causer,” nor the gentlemen either.” * * * * Poor dear Australia — always ready to lay votive offerings, also dollars, at the feet of the flamboyant foreigner — does not come in for much notice. But there is a lively sketch of William the Wirer — he revolted even in his babyhood, for this anecdote is dated 1866, and Prince William was nearly, not quite, 8 years old. * * * * “The little Prussian is a lovely boy and very droll. We had a grand scene with him in the Queen’s room this evening; he came in just when I was about going away, and the Queen wanted him to make me a bow; he was too shy, and re- sisted, so she asked him what his mamma would say if she heard he was so impolite, but this had no effect. She, however, insisted upon it, so at last he looked at her, and said, “No, I won’t.” And then it became a hard struggle between them until he gave in, drew himself, up, and made me a deep bow. It was a charming scene, the Prin- cesses and Prince Leopold laughing most heart- ily. * * * * There is a good deal of talk about the coming “girl barrister.” Of course, the mere male prac- titioner does not jump at the chance of dividing his mite with another, and does not hesitate to say so. Whereat an up-to-date young person re- marks: “I don’t see any objection to girls prac- tising in court. We have had lots of old women on the bench; a few young ones at the bar would be quite a nice change.” M’yes! * * * * It is an old-time saying that while the the- atrical manager was busy getting through the Bankruptcy Court, his acting manager was busy buying a public-house. Well, acting managers are still to the fore. * * * * Mr. George Edward.es, for instance, was, as we all recollect, Mr. D’Oyly Carte’s astute manager at the Savoy Theatre, and Mr. William Greet, now in possession of the Lyric Theatre, was Mr. Horace Sedger’s acting manager. Mr. H. T. Brickwell, Mr. Edward Terry’s former manager, is now les- see of the Garrick Theatre, and Mr. Albert Gilmer, now manager of the Princess’s, was at one time its acting manager. Mr. Dana, till comparatively recently lessee of the Duke of York’s Theatre, was Mr. Penley’s acting manager, and Mr. Levenston also served his time, too, in acting management. * * * * “The Kiss of Delilah” was produced at Drury Lane last Friday evening to a packed house. Miss Hilda Spong’s scene was played capitally, in spite of a certain artificiality of manner. * * * * The “Sunday Times” was very cruel. I send you the notice in extenso: “ ‘The Kiss of Delilah’ was over by half-past 10. I have not the space to dwell upon its other merits, and this one so completely overshadowed them that the good- natured critic is well justified in confining himself to it.— E.R.” * * * * “E.R.” stands for Edward Rose. * * * * “Little Eyolf” has gone into the evening bill at the Avenue, and the theatre at every perfor- mance is full to its capacity. “Carados,” of the “Referee,” is a dreadful an- ti-Ibsenite, and writes the following intelligent criticism on Mrs. Pat: — “Mrs. Patrick Campbell played the trivial part of the Rat-Wife, who ap- pears only for a few moments. It is a part in which the hag’s make-up is everything, for the actress has but to stare hard and speak a few lines in a mysterious way. It was only Mrs. Patrick with a dirty face.” * * * * Also, he is not in love with Miss Achurch. “Miss Janet Achurch played the wife, and was admirable in her stormy moments, though she delivered her casual remarks with a rapt air and a glassy look in her eye, which may have been intended to suggest insanity or may have been simply affectation.” * * * * And yet, in spite of these and other thunder- ings, the theatre is full ! * * * * Some few years ago Mr. Michael Gunn, of the Gaiety Theatre, Dublin, and Captain Bainbridge, of the Theatre Royal, Manchester, were partners. Fortune has taken Mr. Gunn by the hand, and Fate has played the captain a sorry trick. Last Saturday night Mr. Gunn formally retired from business, full of honors and money. Last Sun- day one of the weekly papers contained the fol- lowing par : * * * * “If you have a guinea to spare for poor old Dick Bainbridge, who was once among the most flourishing of provincial managers, but is now poor and paralysed, pray send it along to swell the subscriptions being gathered in on his behalf by Mr. C. L. Carson, of the ‘Stage.’ ” * * * * Many a time and oft has Marie Corelli girded at the theatrical critics. Serve them right, and there are signs that at the approaching produc- tion of the dramatised “Sorrows of Satan” many sharp pencils will be extra sharpened and much bitter ink will be spilt. * * * * Mrs. Kendall is quiescent this week, but still is not forgotten— at least, she was not forgotten by the Eccentric Club, who, at their dinner the other night, produced a little play by John le Hay, called “Clothilde, or the Crushed Tart.” Clothilde appeared to be crushed by the villainy of Mr. Robb Harwood, who was espied by John le Hay, as a Scotch retainer with an Irish ac- cent, as he approached from behind “the vine- clad dustbin.” She recovered a bit from her crushing when her cause was espoused by Ed- mund Payne, but was terribly upset when told by J. F. Sheridan in petticoats that her ostler and groom had been engaged in burning the “Referee.” * * * * Poor Dr. Jim ! On Wednesday evening, about half past 8, he was removed from Holloway to a nursing home St. John’s Wood way. Carried on a stretcher to the ambulance, it was remarked how apparently light was the burden the two men bore. “No heavier than a boy,” said one. All communications for the Dr. are to be addressed 30 Old Burlington-street. * * * * The removal did him no harm. He is better in spirits, and his real address is 42 South-street W. * * * * Mr. Beerbohm Tree on Monday last did not set the Hudson on fire with his production of Mr. Gilbert Parker’s new play “Seats of the Mighty.” Miss Kate Rorke as the heroine was good, but ap- peared extremely nervous, and her Spanish dance failed to please. * * * * The New York critics agree in condemning the play as too heavy and involved, the role allotted Mr. Tree affording him only a small scope for his talents. The “Sun” says that the Play follows the book too closely, and needs condensing. The author should have used the pen more and the scissors less. The journal says that a Mr. Tree is wise he will not open a London theatre with “Seats of the Mighty.” Scant praise is given to the other members of the company, whose support, the “Herald” says, was inadequate. * * * * Mr. Bouchier is also in New York. He opened at the Bijou on Monday night in “The Chili Widow.” Mr. Bouchier personally was found to be much improved, but Miss Vanbrugh (Mrs. Bouchier) and the lady members of the cast fail- ed to score, however, apparently because their acting was too artificial. * * * * The “Colonel” is again out of it. A cablegram dated Boston, December 3, says: “Mr. Mapleson announced this afternoon that no more operas would be given in Boston by the Imperial Opera Company, notwithstanding the fortnight’s book- ings at the Boston Theatre. This decision was come to as the result of a strike of the orchestra to-day. When ‘Andre Chenier’ was to be pre- sented, Mr. Mapleson, who already owed a small balance to the orchestra, engaged fifteen more musicians, as the augmentation was required for the performance of the opera. The old orchestra tock this to mean their possible dismissal, and they accordingly demanded 1000dol before they would begin to play. Mr. Mapleson explained the. reason for engaging the extra men, and also his inability to pay 1000dol. The orchestra refused to accept the explanation, or to play, so Mr. Ma- pieson was forced to appear before the curtain and dismiss the audience. The money was retur- ned at the box-office.” * * * * How about the expectant and hungry artists? Who is going to pay the board bill? * * * * Yesterday, at the Lyceum, took place the benefit matinee of the Actors’ Association. Sir Henry was the bright, particular star. He recited with grim force and undoubted effect the weird poem of “The Uncle,” with the musical accompaniment composed by Sir Julius Benedict, and the minds of many wandered back to the time when he made his first “tour de force,” with Hood’s poem, “Eu- gene Aram,” at the Vaudeville. * * * * How many years ago? Well, no matter, some of us, with all its disadvantages, are still glad to be alive. * * * * Scriptural plays are the rage. “The Sign of the Cross,” “The Daughters of Babylon,” “By Babylon’s Waters,” “The Pilgrim’s Progress,” &c.;, and Signor Bovio, an Italian, is writing a se- ries of dramas founded on the “New Testament.” Under these circumstances, it seems odd to have to recollect how very recently your Mr. Walters’s play was refused a licence, and how only a few years back a man cut his throat in New York be- cause he was not allowed to produce a Passion play in San Francisco. * * * * Franky : “I should think you would be ashamed to have your mother put you to bed.” Georgie : “I don’t know why I should. She does the same thing to father.”
