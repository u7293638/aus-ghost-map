That afternoon, when Grace had seen Mrs Carrrithers- depart, "she dressed for -walking. Ever since her companion had -avowed her "intention of giving informa tion to the police Grace’ had felt miser able. She’hadno'liking for Martin—nay she loathed him—hut she shrank" from being accessory-to'his death, and such a -shameful death. " At last she-resolved that, she would 'warn him, and so give him a chance to escape. Perhaps,-far away, in poverty and ob scurity. he might repent. At any rate, he- should have the chance; so, leaving the house, she set riff’to pay her first visit to Old Court Place. Just as-she came-; in sight of the park gates- she saw Dr Grahame’s gig- drive through, and, seeing 'her, the doctor threw the reins to his groom arid sprang out. - • “How is Mrs Barron?” Grace inquired, Anxiously. • " “Much better in health. There is" no Teiufir of the "bad-symptoms, but she is "very much distressed in mind. Mrs Sturt told me she had taken you into her con fidence, so I thought ! would' tell you that she is quite safe' to-day. Mr Baf Ton has gone to’York, and won’t be back -until half-past nine o’clock. I fancy he Went on purpose to avoid me, but ail the same I shall give him a hint, and of course I shall watch Mrs Barron’s sym tcnis until he is out of England. I won’t have any tricks played,” he said, stern ly. X don t. thirik he will do her any in .3ury now,” replied Grace, very gravely. She was thinking'he wouldn’t have the chance. ■“Very likely not, now he knows I am ■on the alert. Well, good afternoon, Miss oturt; and, raising his hat, Dr Gra hame mounted into the gig and drove away, while Grace turned slowly home VArd, resolving to pay Martin a visit about ten o’clock that night. It would be disagreeable going at such an hour, but she would do it; he should have one more chance to repent. Meanwhile Mrs. Carruthers had ar rived in Scorsby, and at once proceeded to the police-station,-where she reques ted an interview with; the superinten dent, and was at once shown into his private room. He was an elderly man with iron grey hair, and keen, inquisitive eyes, which took a rapid survey-of his visitor. “Mr Kitson, T .believe;” she said, bow ing slightly. “Yes, madam.” And he waited for her to-state her business. “Before going any'further, I have a -slight alteration to make in my appear ance, which will,-perhaps, enable you to recogriise me. I know you have seen me some years -ago,” -.she -said, .-..as,; she 1463) . 1 quietly removed iiei- lichnet and veil; then, by a skilful movement, she lifted the mass of it kite hair, and showed un derneath a CiV>p of short curly hair of a reddish gold. • Laying the wig Sn her lap, Mrs Carru thers next removed her blue spectacles; then, taking a piece of sponge out of a small satchel, 'she rubbed the red scar off her cheek, and a further application, of it caused the dark stain to disappear, revealing a delicate white skin. “Good ;gt-acious, Miss Goddard!” ex claimed. the superintendent. She looked quickly at him. “You tire the first person who has re cognised me, as every one else has taken me for my younger sister.
