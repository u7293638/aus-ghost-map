Beat the Slot Machine. He was a guest of the big hotel, and he was leaning against the penny-in-the- slot machine that grinds out " Nancy Lee" and other once popular airs with wheezy accompaniments. Drumming idly on the machine a happy thought struck him. He sidled into the bar and bought a drink with some ice water on the side, and received two, pennies in the change. Walking back to the machine he slipped in one of the pennies and the band played. It proved a diversion. The other penny followed its com panion and another fantastic caprice followed. Then he dropped hi 3 fingers on the glass and put a piece of ice in his mouth to cool his parched gullet. " Wonder if the blamed thing feels as dry as I do," he murmured, and slipped a small piece of ice into the slot in a sort of mild and sym pathetic way that only can be assumed by a maudlin. The piece of ioe slowly melted, ad justed itself to the aperture, and disappeared in the regions below. Then came a watery gargle, a spasmodic shiver, and the intestines of the machine began to work. The ice had melted to the weight of a penny, and in a watery wail came back the familiar strains of "A Life on the Ocean Wave." That settled it. Back be went to the bar and called for ice water. He scooped out the ice and fed it to the machine. Lottie Collins was outdone in " Ta-ra-ra-Boom" minus the kick. Next on the list was "WeWon't Go Home Till Morning." He swindled the slot for five more Bacchanalian airs before his ice gave out, and then he went back and asked the bar keeper for more ice, got it, and invited him out to havo something with him. The pair fed the machine ice for nine solid hours until the con tents of the ice trust wore exhausted. The machine responded with its reportoire until it got waterlogged and careened over to leeward with 4ft. of water in its hold, flying a signal of distress. Then it gave up the ghost in the middle of " Throw Him Down, M'Clusky."â€” Chicago Timet,
