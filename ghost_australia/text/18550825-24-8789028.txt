SIGNS OF THE TIMES.-No little anxiety is experienced just now anent the Heather Bell, a new clipper ship, commanded by Captain Harms worth, late of the Derwent, which is daily ex pected. She was to leave England on the 10th June, and it is anticipated that she will have a quick passage. As a sign of the times, we may mention that heavy bets are pending upon her arrival. Gentlemen are not now content with mere bets of hats-we have heard of more than ' one instance in which a whole case of hats has been staked on the matter, clearly evincing an overstocked market somewhere. LEMONS.-We" have been favoured with what we are compelled to consider a very handsome sample of lemons, grown in the open air at Sandy Bay by Mr. Frodsham.i That the season is a very genial and singularly temperate one, these lemons offer most convincing evidence. We shall be glad to Bee Mr. Frodsham a frequent contri- butor-to our columns. THE BIGAMY: CASE_Yesterday Mr Burgess gave his decision in the case of Mrs Sherwin, charged with bigamy, that the evidence of iden- tity was not complete, and the case was there- fore dismissed. BETHEL.-The Rev. W. Nicolson is expected to conduct the usual Bethel service to-morrow afternoon. EVANGELICAL UNION.-The monthly meeting of the Evangelical Union will take place at Chalmer'B Free Church on Monday evening next. The Rev. Kerr Johnstone Will deliver the address on the subject of-" The Sin against the Holy Ghost."_
