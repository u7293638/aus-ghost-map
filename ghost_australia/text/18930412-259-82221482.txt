SPORTING NOTES. TBY PIEATE.] Fortunatus, the winner of tbe last Newmarket Handicap, was reared as a pel on cow's milk. Old Criterion finished second in the three. mile Steeplechase, won by Albert, at lUudwick on Saturday last. Another ^deeoslfiiicler, Clarence, ran third. Rather a sensation was caused in racing circles ID Sydney and Brisbane last week owing to the meritorious wins ot the Queensland hares Realm iu tbe A. J.C. Autumn Stakesand Sydney Cup. The Town and Country Journal says the w.nner turned up in the Autumn Btakea to tbe surprise of all in Realm, whom Hodson stole such a march with in tbo early part of tbe race that the others oould never Quite moke up, and the son of Archie and Empress was landed a winner, much tohisowner's(Mr.SamHorden'e) delight. It was one of those lucky wins which wc often sec occur in weight for age raoes not truly run. Of the Sydney Cup, ran on Easter Monday, the Mail says Realm stripped one great mass of uiuscle, and bore undeniable evi dence of the care bestowed upon bim by his trainer. He took his preliminary canter with great freedom, and hie friends were justly con fident to the last. For the first part of the journey he was one of the last lot, but kept gradually improving his position until a little more than three furlongs from home, when he raced to the front, and, leaving tiia borses as though tiiey bad been anchored, cleared out and won easily, despite the most gallant efforts on the parts of Camoola and The Admiral, who ran a wonderfully good horse under big great impost. When the home comer was rounded the three that filled the places left the moderate lot that opposed them, and never left them with the ghost of n chance. Mr. Hordern's victory was heartily received, and there cannot be any doubt but that he possesses a great racehorse in the eon ot Archie, and one that should get any distance. He broke upon us as a deoidedly improved animal, for, leaving the paddock comparatively friendless, be won both races tike a racehorse, defeating suobgood performers as Tbe Admiral, Oxide, Marvel, Paris, I'orUcu, and Dncrow, at weiglit lor age." Re*lm, tvho is by Mr. C. E. McDougall's Archie from Mr. B. Mitchell's Empress, was purchased by his present owner from Captain E. F. Sandeman soiue time back foe 1000 guineas.
