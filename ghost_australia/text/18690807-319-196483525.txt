''? ': '-:; Indeed, withofatEUen'a aid, the case waa , ' well, nigh hopeless, arid therefore' it was that he ' thrqw^in^hq scale against her love for Denton the, full weight of his authority, arid piled upbn it, all .the . cpnaiderationB of gratitude and , loyalty he could call to his aid. Without her, how could an old man (however pitiable for his misfortunes), and an old woman, whose. * audacity ip wedding above her station ' had, in ' ; their opinion, deserved all the' misery it, had earned, recommend themselves to the proud ' ' , , ''. '' and well-born folk, with whom, he hoped once more to mix-r-even putting out of consideration that more, Beribus hindrance to hie efforts which for the present he might contrive to keep ont of eight? But, on the other hand; with his bearitiful errand- daughter to beln him. Vinm altered was tho case ! A country-house that was tho casket of such a jewel as Ellen Black-, burn could not fail to be attractive. She had good blood in her veins, and looked and moved like a princess. She would be rich, for he would make her so. With whom, then, among untitled folk at least, might ohe sot form an alliance?: and that once cemented, her hug- , band's kin would stand shoulder to shoulder ? with her own, and help them to keep their place. Thonghts of this kind' had begun to fill the old man's brain from the moment that ho had received the inewa of his nephew's death, and had even taken definite and material shape with re&pect; to his young neighbor, Herbert Stanhope. But at all events he bad quite made ' npbis mind that the propcsale of Jobn Denton eh.ould.be rejected ; for let the young engineer's fnture prosperityl be what it might in his own line, it conld never be of the sort to further the family, popularity. Perhaps in one who had himself sacrificed so much to mere aentiment, this resolve may seem harsh and unnatural; but it: is easier to give way to the softer emotions at eighteen than at sixty-eight, and eisier at all times to disregard the sentiment o$ other people than one's own. ? ? Thus it waa- that Ellen Blp^kburn found small pleasure in |the.Buddep prosperity of her kindred, nnd sighed u»'her: w'oll-fumiDhed ohamberat the wMar-.or for that little room in ithe cottage, though whose latticed window she : : had bo. off/va watched for her lover across the moor,, arid smoothed the tresses, innocent of flower or gem, to welcome him. Still; Bhe was not unconscious of the delights of her new position, nor so plunged in grief (eince she had hope tb mitigate it), as not in some measure to appreciate them. ; The view from her present apartment (even without that beloved figure in the foreground) was not indeed to be compared withthat to which she had so long been accus- ? tomed ; but it bad a beauty and home quiet of its own which pleased her much. Beyond the ' terraoe and the carriage sweep, and separated from'the latter only by a deep.aurik fence, lay a small hut undulating and well-weoded park, with here and there a herd of deer. Upon one aide ? was the village, with its ivied church ? tower, from which tho joy-bells w^ ere o till pealing; ; dreamily ; and oii the other, field after field of ; richest paature-land, with luxuriant hedges (so d'fferent from thej stone walls about Slogan), ?that seemed to grow so near to one another iri the blue distanco. that they enclosed no apaoa atialL-y: tiii ?(.,?: j-. ; ......... -; . . ? ? i , Her^ bedroom opened upon a still mora charming boudoirj from whose windowB, if tho prpa'peot was more reatrioted, it waa hot leas fair; Immediately beneath them lay the well kept garden, a oheaB-board of flowering squares of various hue. -A quaint old arbor, built of i fir-cones, arid ornamented, with , painted glass, , : i opened on what bad once been the boagting- . . green, but- was now in course of alteration into a croquet gifound-U bhange which abe rightly guested had been! made by young Richard for the sake of his betrothed. Beneath the shade 'of those spreading cedars, and on the levelled turf, be had dbubtleea Btood with her,, and shown how all tbinga were to be, under her coming reign. They had paced together the winding walks of the shrubbery beyond, and climbed yonder little hill with its gay pavilion, from which all the fields and , forms : whioh owned him for their master were to be seen. The boudoir itself , had been recently fitted up, and for whom but for this poor girl, of whose very name Bhe wag ignorant,- but whose 'fate— divorced for ever from him she loved — touched her qyea wHh sympathetic tears. .How it wonld vex this poor creature, when Bhe came to hear it, that the ntw Squire had forbidden hi* people to breathe young Richard's name t That had been a bitter speech of her grandfather's, and painful to lioton to ; and although Bhe did - mot/ doubt that hia affection for' her was ? genuine, though ho showed it in auch mistaken .r fashion, it was plain wealth had already mado . him hard and stern ; and might not bin nature keep that mould for the future f She could refuse to be false tb her lovo, but ' ehe could never act in defiance*; of tho old maa.'fli express .. o coinmandment. I ? : , ..,?-,.... ? It did not need, then, the cold bond of death to keep ^afiundor John Denton and herself. But against such thoughts aa these she had a simple charm, that for the present efc least proved effioaoiouB.
