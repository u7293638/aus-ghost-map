TO TirXEDITOA OF THE COURIER: I the "J Sin, Captain Maconochie's premature dissertation upon the penal discipline of this colony, and the erroneous impressions which it may convey to a portion of the ministry and people of England, or rather from the state of political parties, the sinister use which may be made of it, to draw off the attention from more unwelcome subjects, should induce every one to come forward to support Sir John Franklin in his more just view of the subject, particularly those who pledged themselves to his support in their addresses, and more particularly from the very painful circumstances attendant upon Captain Maconochie's dismissal ; a matter involving a most trying situation, in which I think it is the general opinion His Excellency acquitted himself with true dignity, with great urbanity, and with a prompt decision and firmness scarcely to have been expected from his known highly benevolent feelings and goodness of heart. All, therefore, having a stake in their adopted land, or possessing right principles, ought to rally round the ruler under circumstances such as have recently transpired. Before I proceed to analyse Captain Macono- chief summary, which is the only tangible thing as yet presented to the colony, (his book not having yet appeared I may as well inform you that I am a practical colonist of some seventeen 'years standing, not, I believe, an unreflecting or unobservant one and, therefore, so far as my propositions are not inconsistent with good sense and sound reasoning, are, I humbly conceive, entitled to some consideration. We are told that Captain Maconochie has been accustomed to treat subjects of general discussion scientifically, as if such a subject could not be satisfactorily discussed by the plain and dignified rule of right and wrong, or the mare' humble dictates of common sense. To tell the respectable and educated men of this colony, they are a parcel of slave-drivers, is an imputa- tion as unworthy of Captain Maconochie's general character anrTJscientific attainments as it is unfounded, in fact, unsupported by evidence, and as inherently absurd Units very proposition ; there being no fair analogy to be drawn between men temporally in a state of bondage, variously modified, and men and women and their heirs bought and sold for gold into bondage for per- petuity. . I much fear Captain Maconochie has come to this colony prejudiced against the free population, and with excited notions of the ill-usage of the less fortunate part of it. This may speak well for his benevolence, and in this benevolent feeling he has erred only in common with every respectable individual who ever came into it; but a little longer residence, and a little more practical acquaintance with the prisoner population, than Captain, Maconochie has yet had afforded him, has convinced them that their first feelings and impressions were erroneous and I need scarcely remind a gentleman of Captain Maco- nochie's previous life, that benevolence, unless united with justice, becomes a weakness ; a failing likely to lead its possessor into the committal of the grossest absurdities, and the most * erroneous conclusions. I should have forborne to investigate at all the motives which may have in some degree actuated Captain Maconochie in the publication of his first impressions of the penal discipline of this colony, wishing to believe that he has been actuated by benevolent principles only had not their appearance been accompanied by the singular circumstances attending his retirement, and had not his summary involved imputations upon the respectable portion of this community which we have been called upon so recently in- dignantly to repel and which has been so , warmly seconded by Sir John Franklin. Now to the summary : 1.-" Prisoners on their first arrival in the " colony are assigned to private service, at the will of public Board, which endeavours as it best " can to distribute them fairly and equally among " the settlers." It is only necessary to remark upon this, that it is supposed there is no intention to find fault with this system, it being adopted upon the recommendation of the colonists themselves; ] A although in addition to their assignment to pi- ate service, there are some very wholesome and proper regulations regarding convicts of particular character, of which no mention is made in the summary. 2.-" In the assigned service thus entered on " no wages are allowed to be given, nor is any " other moral impulse employed, excepting the " remote hope of indulgence after four, six, or '* eight years." No wages are allowed, and very properly and why because, first, by a jury of their own country they have been declared temporarily in- competent to the management of their own affairs, and therefore this proper gratification when properly controlled, has been denied them, as a check to their vicious career, and in vindication ofthelawsoftheir country. Secondly, in the early partofthecolony wages were allowed and enforced by regulation, but they were practically (not theoretically) found to be highly inimical to their proper and just control, and that the wages instead of acting as the ' moral impulse' which Captain Maconochie would suppose, acted on the contrary as a means of exciting and gratifying their vicious propensities, as pretexts for robbery, as the means of drunkenness, and escape from the colony and instead of being used only for the purposes intended, they were on the contrary applied to every purpose not intended. To say that the prisoner has no other moral impulse, is to arrive at a conclusion, which although Captain Maconochie may not have foreseen, is nevertheless strictly logical, viz. that there can exist no other moral impulses to good and virtuous conduct except the quarterly receipt of so much wages ; no religious, no other qualities existing in the human mind but the one faculty of the acquirement of pelf 1 He must indeed be a bold argumentation and a shallow reasoner, with little knowledge of the human heart, who shall propound such a doctrine as this I To discuss the many moral, religious, and worldly inducements, influencing daily the minds of all men, and equally so that of the prisoner, as they must be obvious and suggest themselves to all, would lead me into a greater length than your columns would allow. I shall merely remark, that Captain Maconochie in \- giving his opinions so hastily to the public, does not seem to have been aware of the extent and depth of this subject, involving no less than the development, education, existing state, condi- tion and constitution, in all its intricate and metaphysical points of view, of the mind of man. 3.-" Until the allotted periods elapse, the " labour imposed is strictly coerced or slave labour; " and although accompanied with a fixed mine " mum amount of physical maintenance and sup " port sufficient to place above want it is yet sub a ject to all the discomforts and moral degrade " tion incident to such a condition." Upon the assertion that convict labour is strictly slave labour, I shall remark, that although I rest this point upon my former observation, that there is no fair analogy between convict labour as modified in this colony, and the perpetual bondage of the Africans, yet I readily admit that the agitation of this point is likely to have a most injurious tendency upon the minds of prisoners placed in their peculiar situation ; but I positively deny from long prac _ that experience that such is the feeling of their condition among the men themselves, and I take ? leave to caution Captain Maconochie, that should I lie imprudently address one of the ' careless' but high-spirited fellows' he describes, he may find that the practical knockdown argument is far more convincing on such a point than the most specious philosophical reasoning I Admitting, however, for the sake of argument, that Captain Maconochie is fight still it must be conceded that it is unattended with moral guilt. Even ture to assert, however, that no master no superintendent, no overseer of any chain gang of road party, ever dared to insinuate to the prisoners under him that they were slaves, (in Cap .' tain Maconochie's acceptation of the term in direct violation of the humane principles which ( pervade all regulations respecting them. In my opinion, these ' careless fellows' would have very ' coolly cut their overseer's throat for such an in- situation, and as for the master his crops and but stock would have been-where ? why, to use a quaint but very significant phrase all over the left!' Will Captain Maconochie tell us what slave (such as he means is forbidden to be struck, and when it was ordained that the slave should be allowed to complain of his master? If then I have in any way shown that convict labour is not strictly slave labour in the African acceptation of the term, or, at all events, putting aside the abstract scntirrjjric view of the subject, that the prisoners themselves and those now re- putably out of temporary bondage, would be indignant at the assertion that they are or had been slaves, what becomes of Captain Macono- chiefs hasty conclusion, that they are incident to all the moral degradation of such a condition ? That their state of bondage has a direct operation upon their minds is true, but it is not true that it is a degrading one it is a good one the effect is this-it is the wedge' which opens their mental faculties to the perception of humility the first step to reformation of character, the pioneer which clears away the rubbish so long encumbering and darkening their moral perceptions this effect the law intended-this just and right effect the people of England expected. In choosing the term ' minimum amount of physical maintenance, Captain Maconochie has, I think, selected a very unfair one, because it conveys an impression contrary to the truth, namely, that the maintenance allowed is barely sufficient for sustenance, whereas every one knows who will read the dietary prescribed, that the quantities allowed are ample, considerably more than the rations enjoyed by the British soldier, and every one knows who has been only a short time in the colony that assigned servants are not confined to the government allowance, but invariably receive as much more as they require Captain Maconochie might not know also, but I will inform him, that the health of many of the gangs has been attributed to the reduced rations allowed to them? some being allowed too much. I allude particularly to a well- written essay by a clever medical officer, and presented to Sir George Arthur some years ago, and which can he readily referred to in the proper quarter. This indirect insinuation that they receive insufficient food is unfounded in fact, as any one who will use his eyes may convince himself, and in addition, as a stimulant to good conduct, they receive in proportion to their usefulness, tea, sugar, and tobacco ; some of my men receiving 21 lbs. of sugar per week, and Jib. of tea each, as much as any free man ever demanded, and I should hope Captain Maconochie will admit it to be enough 1 For a considerable time my servants received 14 lbs. of flour (sifted) per week, until finding they did not consume it, but boarded it and sold it, and applied the money to the most improper uses it was struck off to 12 lbs., which in my neighbourhood is the usual flour ration, and I know they cannot con- sume it without waste. 4.-" The men are lodged in out-houses, six or " eight or more, under a stable roof; they sleep " here on truckle bedsteads, generally without an dressing : the floor is earthen, and often very " soft; they cook and eat in the workplace or in " one immediately adjoining, always in the rough " est manner 3 and they are subject to the most " severe regulations which any master can get on forced on appeal to a magistrate by equally " severe punishments." The first of these statements is incorrect, the men being nearly everywhere divided into separate huts or cottages, and put together according to their own wish and agreement ; some being orderly, cleanly, and decent, others being dirty, filthy, gluttonous, and careless My servants have three cottages ; I never had any other way of management, nor have I ever seen any other, and I believe it to be the general method throughout the country. The necessity, therefore, of their separation into messes, will make it obvious, that a cook to each is out of the question ; moreover, they infinitely prefer cooking it themselves, because the cooks which could be obtained for them out of their own body, are not to their liking, being as careless, filthy, and un- cleanly as many of themselves. Another of the reasons out of the many that might be adduced is, that cooks competent to perform the simple operation of boiling and roasting, (or fricaseeing, if I Captain Maconochie likes) are not to be had I the settlers themselves not being able to procure them. According to his doctrine, then, many of the settlers and their wives being obliged to cook their own food, they must be vicious, from the " moral degradation incident to it ; to wit also, the Highlanders of bonnie Scotland; this, however, we flatly deny to be the case, although Captain Maconochie scientifically asserts it to the contrary I That the food is cooked in the rough- est manner, is a direct misrepresentation, not the less so, that it is, I am quite ready to allow an unintentional one. The roughest manner of cooking meat is to place it on the embers and grill it, the same as the blacks of the country do ; whereas, the prisoners have three modes, roast- ing, boiling, and frying; occasionally they adopt the three just as they like, generally, on the Sunday, roasting, ( I am now speaking of assigned service but they commonly prefer flying, which is the most expensive, because it is the least trouble, (a great point in everything with them, and because it is the most savoury, and next to grilling, medical men assert, it is the most wholesome I ' For these purposes, they have i invariably the requisite utensils given them. Now, the settlers open' boil their meat for the sake of economy, a good old fashion at home ; but these scientific fellows, I can assure my worthy opponent, greatly prefer the most expensive and savoury method of frying and being fully converted long before they came here, to the French revolutionary, philosophical, scientific principle, that " might constitutes right," and that " it is lawful to do and to get whatever we can With safety," never dream of any other application of good doctrine to the gratification of their habitual tastes and passions. Knives and forks, earthen plates, tin plates and dishes, are also invariably given, but the plates are broken, the dishes destroyed, the handles of the knives broken across marrow bones, (and the blades soon follow the fate of their immediate progenitors) the forks broken getting the marrow out, (for Captain Ma | conochie will begin to see these " careless fellows" have a great gout for everything that is good and the iron pots not unfrequently turned into play- things to pitch up and down the chimney by way of amusement, when their stomachs are filled. On this point it only remains for Captain Ma- conochie to tell us how often the most fragile of their utensils are to be renewed, whatsoever punishments are to be resorted to to enforce them to act contrary to their natures, and habits formed from the cradle, and how we are to twist the knotted and gnarled oak of a hundred years, back again into the pliant sapling of five years' growth ? That it is desirable to remedy their had habits in these respects, no one will deny that it is painful to the master's eye, everyone knows who has had practical experience ; but the remedy, I fear, Is beyond Captain Maconochie's reach, as it doubtless would entail, to be effectual, means of the strongest and most severe description, and appliances such as are not, I believe, at the disposal of the British Government. The only truly effectual way is to send the convicts home again, and have them civilized and educated afresh I This, I dare say, Captain Ma- conochie book shortly to appear will tell us how to do scientifically I never had a man who went to his bed without undressing ; nor do I believe, nor did I ever hear of men generally doing so, (it is a pity Captain Maconochie is not a little more accurate in his inquiries ;) on the contrary, so far is the habit of undressing carried, that it is invariably adopted among the prisoners and others, even when on travelling parties, they exchange the stable roof for the canopy of Heaven only, as I myself can testify. As to truckle bedsteads, I, myself, when a bachelor, always slept on one, and even followed it up after marriage, and I can assure Captain Maconochie I never found it to have a morally degrading effect either on myself or my wife. I have often since been much more dis- contented on a far statelier bedstead. The entire free inhabitants of the colony slept on truckle bedsteads in earlier times, and perhaps, by the bye, Captain Maconochie has made a philosophical discovery, " that it is the very reason they were a little vicious prior to Sir George Arthur's administration I" I never found the floors of their huts or cottages " soft," unless newly erected, the treading invariably making it hard and very compact and having enjoyed the ease and comfort of such a floor, I never found or thought it had a tendency to make me vicious, or that it had a morally degrading effect on others. When even- one nearly had no other they were not the less kind, the less cheerful, or the less hospitable 1 As to cooking and eating in the same place, or in one immediately adjoining, two-thirds of the labourers at least of Great Britain, the entire labouring population of Canada and India, and the majority of the free population of the back settlements of America ( U. S., &c.; ) do the same, as did every free settler for a time, who ever came to these colonies; but it was never found to have a degrading effect. This complaint is puerile. ' As to the " Stable Roof," it is so ridiculous a grievance, that I scarce know how to combat it my servants have always had the same description of" roof as myself; if the canopy of Heaven, they had it if of good match, they had it if of sawed timber and shingles, they have it. If Captain Maconochie means the interiors are not highly plastered, gilded, and convicted, he is correct; neither are the best kitchens in England; neither is the kitchen attached to my house, as good a kitchen as the most philosophical gentleman could wish for neither is it necessary, for cleanliness, order, neatness, sobriety, temperance, nor any of the moral attributes so desirable in mankind. In conclusion on this point, the majority of the prisoners themselves readily admit, that they are on the whole, better fed, better lodged, and better clothed than they were at home before they committed crime. With respect to the diaries of the chain gangs, road parties, c, I know that Sir George Arthur, a just as well as a highly benevolent man, took infinite pains to regulate them, that they should be sufficient and wholesome, and that they should be supplied in a regular and comfortable manner. A reference to the documents on the subject vi will sufficiently prove this. In brief, with respect to food, lodging, and clothing, it will be found that the prisoner servant has always had these " moral impulses" increased in quantity and quality, precisely in proportion as they increased with his master, thereby operating as a further moral stimulus to his exertions, which appears to me the only proper, just, and common sense course, unless Captain Maconochie intends the convicts to be served before the master, and has found out a scientific method of " putting the cart before the horse I" With respect to the severity of the regulations for their control, and the facility of obtaining their enforcement, Captain Maconochie living so ' short a time at Government House, with the military barracks within gun-shot, can have had no practical experience of their propriety or impropriety ; he has never laid or watched all night, in the expectation of " a visit from some of his " careless fellows," who, tired of civiliza- tion, have taken to the bush ; has never had his daughters seduced or ravished ; (and God in his mercy avert it though the matter is too serious not to be adverse to his crops burnt, his house "gutted," his stock stolen, and his property "weeded," (pilfered) his peace of mind taken away, never to return in this world ; he seems not to have allowed himself practically to dwell upon this and much more, and what was due to the feelings, education, and families, as well born and well bred as himself; he does not seem to have contemplated how completely these regulations are modified and mitigated, by the distance of many settlers from the arena of justice, the direct loss to the master in all cases, when enforcing discipline, and to have allowed himself entirely to have forgotten that a very short period ago, it was declared that transporta- tion should be entirely abolished, as the penal discipline of these colonies was altogether too lenient II And well does your able contemporary of the Advertiser remark, that " self-interest renders the mass of masters of every description, at least indulgent ones, and prove rather to mischievous beauty than to severity 1" As to the facility of getting them enforced, it is an extremely unpleasant and troublesome business, and it would indeed be absurd to make regulations which could not be enforced. This, I think, logicians call arguing in a circle. 5.-" This is the usual picture in the country " districts; in the towns there is more comfort, " sometimes in the case of a good house-servant there " is too much, consistently with a state of punish " mental but there is much temptation. Not being " allowed wages, yet desirous of procuring indul " gences, the prisoners too often steal to obtain means, " and all fly to linger, whenever they can obtain it, " to DROWN humiliation and care." Captain Maconochie is again much in error, in contrasting the town with the country service, as if he will but take the trouble to walk into the kitchens and back offices of the majority of the townsfolk, (he must not look only at the establishments of the first functionaries of the Government, he will find the servants cooped up, often in very small dirty kitchens, viewing Heaven only perpendicularly from within four walls, or inhaling the miasma of all such con- fined situations, and where the one close confined apartment serves for sleeping as well as eating, infinitely in my humble opinion in a worse pre- I ro dicament than those in the country who at least tH( enjoy sweet air and sunshine, sleeping rooms and eating rooms, and who are not confined to the demoralizing stenches of rum, butcher's offal, and the innumerable etceteras, the invariable adjuncts of back offices in all towns. For my part, I humbly hope I am a civilized man, and a moral one, and sooner than adopt Captain Maconochie's choice of serving in a town, I would much rather have the blue sky of Heaven only for my covering, and a handsome wattle tree for my kitchen for the rest of my days 1 The very able Editor of the Launceston Advertiser well remarks, that as to their stealing from being allowed no wages, " they would steal whether they had wages or not, the result arising from ingrained vice ;" I quite agree with him. I am glad, however, to perceive, that Captain Maconochie seems to think, that the prisoners may obtain more comforts than is " consistent with a state of punishment ;" but he never seems to reflect (that being a quality wherein he does not certainly resemble Galileo,) that the very wages which he' is so anxious to allow, may procure many such comforts as are altogether inconsistent with a state of punishment, and may be put to many iniquitous uses, altogether antagonistic to every species of reformation. If Captain Maconochie would say he would control the wages, he must do it precisely in the. way it is done at present, for all prisoners now receive wages, but which wages are strictly prohibited being laid out in anything else but clothing, and such moderate indulgences as tea, sugar, and tobacco. Had Captain Maconochie borne more in mind this " consistency with a state of pun- ishment," we should not have had to combat so many absurd propositions and had he reflected a little more on this important consideration, he would have hesitated before bringing so grievous a charge as the countenancing of slavery against the people of this colony, there being as much difference between men suffering justly, and men suffering innocently, as between black and white, honesty and dishonesty. What fair analogy, then, can be drawn between men temporarily in a state of bondage, or bound to serve the Crown, and the African slave? Is Captain Maconochie prepared to show that the poor African committed crimes for which he is now suffering a just retribution ? If so, let him beware of the spirit of the righteous Wilberforce, it will haunt him in his dreams I Does not Captain Maconochie know that the majority of the prisoners term themselves Crown servants;" if not; let him put the question to a few of the respectable and wealthy portion of this community, and ask iAenj-(if he thinks the question a prudent one whether, when they were in a state of bondage, they considered themselves as " Slaves," or Crown servants?" I will honestly advise him not 1 The Editor of the Advertiser well says, " the rhapsodies that we have been used to hear on the slavery of the convicts, are based on the fallacy here pointed out," and which I have endeavoured further practically to expose. To attempt to stop drunkenness, by giving it additional means to its better exercise, is certainly as wise as it would be to blow with the mouth against a hurricane to stop its progress, or to take a feather to hew a millstone; give money wages, or any such wages as they could con- vert into money or its equivalent, the means whereby liquor could be obtained, they would " fly to liquor so much the more, " to drown" (here Captain Maconochie is for once right,) humiliation and care, that is, humility and reflec- tion, precisely the first effect desired to be produced on the mind of the prisoner, the first step to reformation of character But here again we should travel into metaphysics, and unless Captain Ma- conochie is an acute phrenologist, I fear that the ghost of Galileo himself, could he scientifically raise it, could not help him to a victory ; the knowledge and power of analysing the human mind having far exceeded the discoveries of his times I \- ' 66" THE TICKET-OF-LEAVE." Here I am at a loss equally with the Advertiser, to comprehend Captain Maconochie. " The absence of recorded vice is certainly tantamount to a record of good conduct, the principle which is acted upon on this point, being precisely that laid down in the l8thcbapterof the book of the Prophet Ezekiel, with a wisdom which I presume no christian man will dispute. I think there is little certainty in procuring it, when the conduct is good, the prisoner being entitled to be heard before a Magistrate, if unjustly deferred by his master, a thing which very few masters indeed would be so unprincipled as to do. It has been found an admirable and very useful intermediate step between bondage and freedom, and all regulations for its control have been carefully framed to make it more effective. These may or may not be improved or amended ; it is a fur subject for consideration. I am quite of opinion " it is often easily lost 1" to sum up the question, Captain Maconochie further says, that when a prisoner becomes free, whether he has exhibited a good or bad character during his bondage, he again mixes with the remainder of society and what remedy, what objection, can there be to this? What just interference can there be bad with a man after expressing his crime and undergoing its punishment? Is it not the same course precisely pursued at the penitentiaries of Sing Sing, Mount Auburn, and Philadelphia, in the United States, the best perhaps devised systems embracing radical reformation now existing and there, let me inform Captain Maconochie, the vital principle of reformation is precisely the same as in the British Penal Colonies, the humbling the prisoner, and moving his mind to careful reflection j and there also, " no wages being allowed, he is prevented from "flyingtoliquor to drown humilia- tion and care, as if these two very effects were a grievance, and not exactly those which the British Legislature was desirous of effecting 1 ! Another charge is, that the British system of transportation involves an uncertainty as to the adequate degree of punishment due to various degrees of crime; so it does, but it is a discovery made long before Captain Maconochie found it out, and a discovery much more easier made than rectified I Even the direct amount of punishment at the Penitentiaries above referred to are more or less uncertain; and why? Because every human mind differs from another; some, are sensitive, some are apathetic, some intelligent, some idiotic, some educated, some under cased, some refined, some british, &c.; &c.; and therefore, silence and solitude, or whatever mode of punishment you adopt, will act in an uncertain degree upon its recipients, in proportion as the mind shall be able or competent to its operation, and in direct degrees of actual suffering, as various as the hidden springs of the mental faculties are complicated and difficult to arrive at. The Americans, however, do not consider this all-important subject, scientifically or philosophically only; hand in hand with every worldly means employed, the inculcation of religious truths occupy the. full centre of their efforts, honestly endeavouring with the highest wisdom to excite the still small voice of conscience, and to raise in the bosom of their culprits that very " humiliation and care" which Captain Macono- chie so much deprecates, the first earthly harbinger of vital reformation, and the germ of future usefulness in this world, and a glorious immortality hereafter The great question whether Great Britain shall abandon her system of transportation, and in its place adopt the American system of penal- tertiaries, involves considerations of a vastness and magnitude not to be fully elucidated by the mind of any one individual, it is a subject for the undivided attention of the Grand Councils of the nation. The first main question here is, the relative situation of the two countries, and the applicability of the two systems in all their bearings to the relative age, habits, geographical position, population and extent of refinement and civilization of the two countries, the one a young one, the other an old one. It will, I conceive, be at once conceded that the punishment of delinquents should in the first instance be made as beneficial to the country against which they have transgressed, as may be consistent with their own ultimate re- formation, in as far as human means can be made to act generally (individually in an exact ratio to mental faculty, I believe to be impossi- ble) upon the present state of mental development hitherto attained. I say present state of mental development, because to strike at the very tap-root of crime, we must resort to universal infantile education of the entire human race. When this most desirable consummation shall come to pass, we know not to what height of intelligence the soul of man may be raised. Then, and then only may we hope to eradicate crime to an extent not believed, and banish a host of sin and sorrow from the world. But to return ; Great Britain then, in bend- ing her system of punishment of delinquents to the highest and most beneficial purposes, in planting colonies in the waste and howling wilderness, and causing it to blossom as the rose, in spreading population, civilization, and the Gospel over the globe, and thus fulfilling the all-wise and beneficent decrees of a most adorable Creator, in extending her commerce, strengthening her fleets, relieving her increasing millions, extending her righteous power, and in a multitude of ways benefitting herself and the world, can certainly only have been directed by that consummate wisdom which could alone be the effect of carrying out decrees and purposes devised by infinite wisdom itself. At the same time that she has not been unmindful of her more unfortunate children, the reformation which has been effected upon hundreds of them in these colonies, who now stand up in triumphant confirmation of the benevolent wisdom evinced in her penal discipline would one have thought, have been sufficiently startlingly evident to every new beholder. For my part, there are many reformed men in these colonies, on whom I would sooner repose confidence for every moral attribute, than on many who arrive free from our native land I Were I to go on to consider the numberless points of view in which this part of the subject Bloy and ought to be considered, before any violent alteration is determined on, I should, I fear, extend beyond the limits of the columns of two of your newspapers ; suffice it in fine to say, that the wide difference there is between men being let loose from their prison-house at Sing Sing, Mount Auburn, or Philadelphia, with every fach ty of livelihood, and change of residence before them in an unpeopled country, and the correspond- ing state of things in an old overburdened country like Great Britain, is of itself a sufficiently weighty consideration for an English Minister to pause before adopting any violent and sudden alterations of a penal system, beneficially exist- ing for centuries, upon the crude suggestions and erroneous first impressions of any gentleman, however scientific, who may have resided amongst us for so short a period as Captain Maconochie. If a penitentiary or two were founded in these colonies on one of the American systems; (there are three,) for the more effectual treatment of such culprits as by our system are found to be almost incorrigible, I believe it would be a great improvement, but I must for- bear touching more upon this point in this letter. %. I must think, that Captain Maconochie will yet see reason to lament, that he too hastily even placed in temporary jeopardy, the peace, good order, and well-being of these colonies, by propounding doctrines eminently fallacious, highly pernicious to uneducated minds, and at direct variance with the known opinions of our most talented rulers, and of nearly all who having had practical experience, had a right to treat of the subject. I hope I need scarcely add, that I have had no intention in what I have said, to wound the feelings of a gentleman in Captain Maconochie's at present painful circumstances, nor do I believe, (certainly not intentionally,) have I exceeded the bounds of fair satirical argument and discussion; my endeavour only has been to expose the entire fallacy of Captain Ma- conochie s " first impressions, and thereby to supply an antidote to my fellow-colonists and the reflecting minds of our honoured Mother Country. I beg to remain, Sir, your very obedient servant, AN OLD COLONIST. Norfolk Plains, 17th Oct. 1836.
