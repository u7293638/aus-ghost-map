SYDNEY WEEK BY WEEK (By Emily Soldene.) How it blew! Turning from King-street into Mac- quarie-street, just as one got past St. James’s — “bang” — it came broadside on. Thank goodness, frilled petticoats after all have their advantages, and their principal advantage is, when the wind blows. * * * * I got to parliament House 11.15. I thought I had taken Time by the forelock, but other people had been struck with the same idea. The place was crammed. I stood aghast. No room, no seat. I saw nothing but the door-step, when a personage, a delightful personage with a white wand, approach- ed and whispered or at least spoke piano, also con fidentially and interrogatively — “Um,” nodded I affirmatively — then open sesame, a nice cosy cor- ner. * * * * You never saw so many women in your life. Such flowers and feathers, and rustling silks, and nodding plumes, and frills, and furbelows, and tip- pets, and capes, and furs, boas, and dear little grebe ducks, and sable and ermine, with an infin- ity of tails cuddling close to pretty throats— smiles —and nods — and distant “How de do’s,” and “Yes; that is Mrs. This!” and “Oh! no; the other is Mrs. That!” * * * * Nothing happening, except the advent of ladies. They simply swarmed. Everybody sat on every- body’s lap, and stood on chairs, and not at all on ceremony. They sat in the seats of the mighty and cf the military. Even the Archbishop’s seat was sat upon — not taken. Oh! no! When his Grace appeared it was vacated. * * * * Then “Oh! what a surprise!” The invalid — the Attorney-General— the dear and Hon. Jack — came on the scene. How the women worried him. “How are you?” “How are you?” “Are you better?” “Are you quite well? “How are you?” “So glad to see you!” said they in the most forward manner. Why didn’t they let the poor man have a moment’s rest? I couldn’t get at him myself — I was blocked. * * * * “How do you do?” said Mr. Mowle, pulling on his white kid gloves. “Very well, thank you,” said I. “Why, I heard you had the measles.” “Measles!” said he. “Not me — grown out of that sort of thing.” * * * * Presently entered Sir John Lackey. He had to push his way through the ladies, but didn’t seem to mind it much. Then, after a bit, Mr. J. J. Calvert, having got through his usual quick change act, read out in a sonorous voice the com- mission. (I do hope that’s right.) * * * * Then the supreme moment arrived, and through the open door came the sound of “God Save the Queen,” the word of command, the rattle of arms, and Black Rod announced “His Excellency the Governor approaches the Council Chamber.” * * * * That was our cue. We all stood up. Enter the Governor and a brilliant suite, all gold and scar- let, and black and silver, and jewels and glitter. We spread our frocks out, and made our obeis- ance to the Representative of Majesty. At least, we would have done so had there been room. * * * * No seats for the military or the navy. The ladies had arrived, and occupied all the positions, and the gallant gentlemen surrendered at discre- tion, and held out — no, I mean, laid down their arms. * * * * The military and aides grouped themselves round, and on the dais. “Who is that splendid big man?” said a lady. “Don’t know,” said I. I was afraid to say it was Colonel Smith, because he might be offended. * * * * We all stood up about five minutes. Then, “My Lords and Gentlemen” — I mean the members of both Houses— headed by the Speaker, and the Premier and Mr. Lyne, entered. Then came the speech. Ther out went the Governor, and the military “jingle- jangle,” “clitter-clatter,” and the suite. Then it was proposed, “This House do now ad- journ till 4 p.m.,” and the “ayes” had it. * * * * Such a crush in the lobbies and the library, and the corridors, and all the places. * * * * “Have you been over the House?” said a voice “No,” said I. “Once in the ladies’ gallery.” “Not in the dining-room?” “No.” Then we went up stairs to the dining-room. Lots of people. Mem- ber for this, member for that, and his sisters and his cousins and his aunts, etc. “Have you seen the other side of this room?” said another voice. “No,” said I. “Come along, then,” said he. “Beautiful view from the balcony.” Then we went the other side of the room, and ——. But we had soda with it. Oh, yes. * * * * When I got into Macquarie-street all the crowd was trooping off, and I had to hurry up. * * * * Last Thursday night the clerk of the weather, with a sense of artistic fitness not always visible in his arrangements, went in for a mise-en-scene entirely suitable to the occasion. There was held at the Town Hall the 21st meeting of the “National Shipwreck Relief Society of N.S.W.” And it rained cats and dogs. * * * * The hall was rammed, crammed, jammed; but this was a free show, you know — nothing to pay, a programme thrown in, and a chance of getting one’s face into the flashlight. * * * * The proceedings were rather preachy and dull, except the music — that was good, too much though, and the lugubrious tempi of that “Faust” selection was enough to aggravate a saint. But a ray of light came when the Governor gracefully rose from the midst of some beautiful floral ar- rangements to propose “the adoption of the an nual report,” and yet another ray when the Right Hon. Georgie, spick and span, fresh from the country and his buggy accident, dropped his eye- glass, and told us in the course of a humorous speech how “the nation which was about to be born” (here Mr. Barton, whose wavy hair is whiter than it used to be, but still most becom- ing, fidgetted a bit) was not only distinguished for its brave life savers, but also for “its scullers, its cricketers, and (pause, and looking round), its politicians,” and begged to second the motion of his Excellency. * * * * Of course the event of the evening was the awarding of the medals for bravery-— saving life, etc. Lady Hampden made the presentations — such a lot of them (25) — and it took no end of a time to dig them out of the crowd. Then when they were disinterred it took the secretary no end of a time to read the cases; then the pins of the medals not working very well it took her Ladyship no end of a time to fasten them on the men’s lappels. * * * * Then fhere was the “certificate of merit”— no end of a size, big enough to furnish a house. The recipients didn’t know what to do with it. They tried to get it under their arm; they held on to the frame, and dangled it sideways; they put it behind them; they held it in front — it cov- ered them up, they couldn’t see the steps — and put their best foot first in a vain effort to find them. Then everyone when half-way down got tapped on the shoulder. They had forgotten the morocco case of the medal. Then they trotted back and fetched it. Then they didn’t know what to do with that; they put it in this pocket and in that. The case was the last straw. * * * * By the time we had got through with about five heroes the Governor was leaning his head on one hand (like when you go into church, drop on your knees, and look through your fingers at the new bonnet of the woman in front of you and wonder “where she got it?” — everybody knows her husband is in such difficulties that — ) and the Admiral yawned, and was dreadfully bored. * * * * “Miss Constance Emily Pratt,” called the sec- retary. Miss Constance Emily Pratt was a pretty girl with a pretty silk blouse, pretty fluffy hair, and a pretty deprecating smile. Her ad- vent made a decided change in the situation. Everybody sat up. The Governor even sat up, and over his face as he adjusted his eyeglass stole that nice amiable expression we all know so well. Everybody leaned forward, even the blasé pressmen were interested, and the Admiral was suddenly radiant. * * * * Well, Miss Pratt got her medal and her certifi- cate, and, bless you, had no trouble with them, for ever so many men rushed forward to help her down the steps, to carry the certificate, and to go back for the case, etc. * * * * There was great rejoicing and cheers over the gold medallists — Jose Figueroa and Percy Regin- aid Higgins, barrister-at-law. But I thought the roof would have fallen when there stepped forward the survivors arid life savers from the Maitland disaster, conspicuous among them being Mr. John Russell and Mrs. Hammond and her baby. * * * * After the presentations we all stood up and sang “God Save the Queen” at the top of our voices. Then we departed, and outside the Town Hall-gates stood a four-horsed waggon, and I wondered, “Was it waiting to take home those certificates of merit.” * * * * If anyone tells you the new markets are going to be a frost don’t you believe it. I walked through on Saturday night. Brilliantly flooded with light, the palace was filled with a multitude. The people swarmed on every floor— upstairs and downstairs it was perpetual motion, a continual movement like colonies of ants, and continual talk filled the air. * * * * On each side of the main corridor are shops. Lots of them marked off — florists, fruiterers, hair- dressers, tailors, jewellers. In many of them were people discussing and arranging this, that, and the other. Among them not a few business and up-to- date looking women. The markets are all right, and don’t you forget it. * * * * The cruise of the Waikare to the islands seems to have been a great success. One of the travellers speaking of the well-known “Sliding Rock” at Apia, says: “The bather sits on the upper part of this rock, and glides through the natural shower gently down into the pool. I can assure you it’s great fun, and at once a novel and exciting ex- perience.” * * * * Now it is well known that travellers are pro- verbially reticent. But I have heard that the real “novelty and exciting experience” of this glide is that the glidist glides down, held firmly (and his possibly and probably erratic course directed and controlled) by a dusky, musky, Samcan beauty, whose full dress is nothing in particular (cut on the bias), and finished off with a scarlet hibiscus bloom, stuck behind the ear, “A Venus in Bronze,” as our friend Burton Dibbs has it. * * * * I have also heard, “O Tusitala,” that this is where the “fun” comes in. * * * * But, of course, this was a long time ago. Quite a year since I was there, and things may be diffe- rent, now. * * * * Races on Saturday. Rather! Arrived just in time to be too late. Arrived in time to hear the people shout “Alemene.” “Alemene,” and to see Mr. Oxenham’s horse romp in; wasn’t that dis- gusting? Of course, I ought to have had a bit on. Never mind; better luck next time. * * * * How delightful and invigorating it all was; the green fresh grass, the tiny nip in the air that made you one moment put your tippet on; the bright warm sun that made you the next moment take it off. * * * * But an awful thing has happened. They have cut the lovely tree, the “Oxenham tree” I call it; cut it down dreadfully. The condition of the old lady in the ancient ballad, who, lingering by the wayside, had her petticoats “cut all round about,” is not a circumstance to it. What a sacrilege. What was it done for? Where is the conserva- tor of the public morals ? No ; I mean of the woods and forests. Where is the man who has done this thing? Let me immortalise him. * * * * How beautiful is the voice of the bulbul — no, the bookie, especially when you go to cash your ticket! How sweet to the musical ear is the ca- dence — the light and shaded— of “2 to 1, bar one,” “10 to 1, bar three,” “5 to 1 on the field,” “10 to 1, bar one,” “4 to 1, bar one,” “10 to 1 on the field,” “10 to 1,” “10 to 1,” “Any price, any price,” “The Chief? 20 to 1, sir; yes.” “Four to 1, bar one.” “The Chief, 20 to 1. In tens? Yes, sir.” “10 to 1 on th’ field.” “Seven to 1, bar one.” “Eight ter 1, bar one.” “Five ter 1, bar one, etc. * * * * We all plunged on Merloolas, and came a crop- per. * * * * “See that quiet looking old gentleman,” said a lady to me. “That’s Mr. Muir. He won the first race with The Tola. He owns North Bri- tish. Shouldn’t wonder if North British weren’t a good thing for the Welter Handicap.” * * * * Well, it was, you see. But we didn’t back it. * * * * Oban was a hot favorite for the Spring Handi cap. “A sure thing.” “A safe thing.” A thing to put your bottom dollar, or anything else rich and rare on. I divided the contents of my purse (with the exception of 4½d and my re- turn tram ticket), put half on Oban and half on Syerla. Just then somebody said something about Blue Metal. “Blue Metal,” said somebody else; “not a ghost of a chance.” Then another somebody else came up with a ticket. “Could only get 20 to 1,” said he. “What about?” said I. “Blue Metal,” said he. “Fools and their money,” said the philosopher. * * * * You should have seen our faces when Blue Metal — But, there, this subject is to me a painful one, and gives me “that tired feeling.” * * * * “Lord,” said a lady, “if I waited for a new frock till my old man brought it off with his gee- gees, I’d be taken up by the police.” * * * * Monday evening I went to the Carnival — the Darlinghurst Rink Carnival. Truth compels me to state it was a very dull carnival, indeed. No fun, no frolic, and, as a carnival, it was like the chairs in the tea-room — it hadn’t a leg to stand upon. * * * * I was disappointed. I expected a gaily light- ed hall, profusely decorated; a fancy- dressed crush and crowd ; horns tooting, trumpets squeaking, tin whistles whistling, drums beating, confetti flying, the crash of a military band, and the gay voices of a mirth-making masked multi- tude. But it was very sedate, only the eternal rolling of the skates, like the boom of the distant sea; round and round they went, graceful and pretty. Some laughing girls in pretty frocks were having a good time. * * * * A good many fancy dresses— Kings and Jockeys — Nurses and Nxxxxrs — Pierrots — Babies — Romps — Soldiers— Sailors — Scotchmen in kilts— High- landers — Naval Officers — Peasants from all coun- tries (including Woolloomooloo) — Snow Storms — Night and Morning — Yanks — Mashers — Cowboys — Sweet Girl Graduates— Scullers — A Crocodile and a Tiger, with practicable tails, walking about arm in arm, smoking cigarettes. * * * * Such a lot of chaperons! They sat close up all round the hall, like birds on a fence in the cold weather. * * * * Now, they don’t have chaperons at “carnival” balls, you know. * * * * Of course it’s different at “ ’er ’op.” * * * * Talking about balls and carnivals, I got a let- ter from a gentleman last week suggesting, as a help for the “Distressed Actors’ Fund,” a “bal masque” at the Town Hall. Admission, one guinea. He is sure it would be an immense suc- cess. “At a ‘bal masque’ one can darnce with anyone; whereas at an ordinary ball — er — rer — er — fella meets his own set and is obliged to darnce with his own gurl, don’t you know.” * * * * The old story — toujours perdrix. * * * * I went into Nicholson’s to see how the Lottie Hyam booking-sheet was getting on. Splendid! Hurry up if you want a good seat. It comes off Saturday, remember! Mr. Nicholson took me up to see the showroom — a magnificent apart- ment— nothing like it in the music trade in Lon- don. * * * * Father (to son, who is engaged to an actress)— “I’m sorry you are going to bring an actress into our family.” Son— “Oh! that’s all right. She isn’t much of a one.” * * * * “What was. Noah supposed to be doing when the animals were going into the ark?” said the teacher. “Taking the tickets, miss,” said the scholar. * * * * Mr. Green — “Now, I’m going to tell you some- thing, Ethel. Do you know that last night, at your party, your sister promised to marry me? I hope you’ll forgive me for taking her away!” Ethel— “Forgive you, Mr. Green! Of course I will. Why, that’s what the party was for!”
