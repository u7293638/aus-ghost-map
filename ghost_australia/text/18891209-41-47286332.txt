Lyons soon had the measure 6f the bowling,! and by fine all- round hitting , the score; mounted: rapidly, Walter Qifien doingJiU' share, -though at a more moOeet rate. , The : century was posted after less than an hour's play. At 117 Giffen wa» inappad. np at the wickets oS Winnall, who bad relieved Delaney, and was troubling the batamen. George Giffen followed. : ? Ha seemed In. rare { trim, and soon had 16 up. Then he failed to j get hold of one, and waa caught at d«ep leg— . 2 for 353. Blinman was badly miaaed by Evan off Winnall, who seemed to trouble; him considerably at first. Lyons also i treated him with respect for a . time, but afterwards' bit out and seat two balls; well over the chains; while' the 'finest hit of : all—one into the furthest oorner— josfc fall short of the boundary. At last, with 195 .on \ the board, Lyons was well caught at mid-off. He made hia runs without giving tha ghost of a chance. Although two or three «! the ? fieldtoen-made 'great efforts to get near, some of Tiis big bits. His score, which was made .' in an hour and three-quarters, included four ? 5\ and nineteen. 4's.

NOBTH AT)BT.ATDS. : The first meeting between these1 oldbs has provided an Interesting game notwithatand ng the vagaries of an umpire who evidently aid not know the rales of crioket Going in first, the Hindmarsh were all gotrid of for 144\. Jarvis and the youngest of the Chittle boroaghfl made a capital start,* *nd the first wicket produced 89, of which Jarvis had iolayed in his Best form for 57. Just before ha was got out Amos clean bowled 'him, but Mr. O'Halloran.did not Bee it. Amosi who' was unauccessfnlwith the ball In the earlier matches, was. bowling well, and he soon sent Albert Chittieborough' back. Then Fred Jams wa* foolishly rnn out. Groves tried an impossible run, Jarvis told him to go back, but Groves came straight- on* the wicket he had left was disarranged, and for some incomprehensible reason Mr. O'Hal loran gave Jarvis out. There was some wrangling on the field, but Jaivis had to leave. Groves and Lesohen each batted well, and took the score to 135, when Leschen left and Z wioket3 down. Rogers then came on again, and he and Amos rattled down the last 6 wickets for 9 runs. The feature of the North Adelaide fielding was the wicket-keeping of Brown. The North Adelaides were confident that they ;could make the runs, but King and Jarvia bowled so well and the field worked eo hard that in a little more than an hour 7 wickets fell for 88 runs. Hill, who went in first, though the youngest member of the team, was the only player who offered any serious resistance, and he carried his bat without giving a chanoe. His play all round was very neat and augured well for his future. Darling also showed fair form. Jarvis's 3 wickets coat 55 runs, while King's 3 cost 32\. Scores :— HIKDMAESH, A. H.
