The, religious. belief of the. abo riginals of Australia. The' natives of Australia can scarce ly be said to have any religion.. It is? merely a vagne belief in evil spirits,., who are- to be propitiated, on- guard- ed against,. Priests, temples,, or re ligious rites — proper, — they, have none... Mrs. Thomson, a Scotchwoman, who- was kept captive amongst the natives, of the Eastern Prince; of "Wales Is land, and who, lived with, them in the capacity of the wife of one of the- men,, (all of whom treated her kindly,, fhoughithe women were very jealous of: her andtreatedher- with much.cruelty) denied that they believed in any Su preme- B'eing,. in the immortality of: the sou,l„ or- in any system- of reward.. or punishment. After death the dead, are changed into Europeans :. " Fall ' down black man, j ump up white man !" was the simple philosophy of this peo ple. A ''-native who was hanged at. Melbourne a few years agp,. consoled! himself with the belief that he would. " jump up white fellow and have lot&. of sixpences." Mrs. Thomson was. supposed to be the g.h.ostof the daugh ter of a man named Pi&quai;, and the? children used to run after her crying " Poor thing !' she is nothing — only a ghost ! " A similar idea prevails northward from the Torres Islands to New Caledonia, and even amongst various negro tribes in Africa. The Australians have no belief in the cre ation of the world. Like the Poly nesians, they believe that everything existed as it is from the beginning. The earth, however at the beginning was covered by water, until Mawe drew up New Zealand by means of an enchanted hook. Of justice and e- quity in the abstract the Australians have no idea. Their only idea in these matters is, that the man is right who is physically or numerically strong enough to risk the vengeance which he has braved by his acts.
