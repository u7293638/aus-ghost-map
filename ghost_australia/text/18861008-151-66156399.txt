SPORTING. BI " GENTAU.." To-morrow the Victoria Amateur Turf Club commences their spring meeting. Great improvement have been made since last meeting, which will "no doubt be ap preciated by the sporting public, if the day turns out fine the receipts will far exceed any previous' guineas' day. The meeting as usual commences with a Maiden Plate, .for special weights, for which I fancy Mennotti, Buckley and Islander, next on the list is the Hurdle Race of 2 miles, a large number have accepted, of whom the best appear to be Ocean, Huntsman and Revenge. The Hunters' Race hao aleo a large entry, I like Abdallah Charcoal, Curiosity, next on the programme is the Foal Stakes, when the Sydney youngsters will test the calibre of our two year olds, who, I am afraid are not a grand lot, for this event I place Yetman, Sumatra, and Bedouin. The Guineas come next, and a small though select field will face the starter, I place them Volcano, Maddelina, Tamarisk, with Gadily as the best outsider. Tile mile tace finishes the days sport, and will bring forth a large field of horses, the victor of Saturday last look to me, in spite of his penalty, as the best thing to back, and, I therefore place them Middlemarch, Hogmanay, and the Ghost. Betting on either of the two cups is very luiet jous at present. Recall has been introduced for the Caulfield Cup to win a large stake, and as the Ballarat stable were hot goods in the 'Cups' of 1885, this horse must be worth a small invest ment. I have no doubt see shall see other candidates introduced into the bett ingi next week, for Tuesday is the pay-up day, and owners will have a pretty shrewd dea by that time as to their probable chances of scoring a win.
