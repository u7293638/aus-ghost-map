The Mayoral Plate. By Nemo. I hope I am in time with a few remarks in reference to the Municipal Show to be held on-the day after ihte races. After giving the " tips" for the races and fop likely winners'-of the separate \- events, I think it only ;right to give ther . j . nwne of the likely .^winner of the blue ribbon in that event. I believe there, arethree competitors for this ribbon (or lobes), and although all three are. horses they wish to become mayorp, whichappears a paradox. How ever, 1 leave rs to the eight good and intelligent judges that are to decide. , ^Thp^colt I,mostly fancy is " Guratej,,r" By 14Chaplain," out, of ''Diocese,"■ and y iOt is^reediiag that will entitle - one of ,,,.them toihe ribbon I cannotseeliowthey ^JBie to.passCurate," for, not",only having . the blood, he shows the breeding. ' r i ,,-Asiotber competitor is -a. really good ' ^..substantial horse, but still* growing, and . if he put on any more'flesh will be too /;• stout for any kind of active work. His * name is " Clinker," %jMScotch Jock," out of a Devon marevTam informed, by the name pf '1 Que^n-v-Bess.'' So T think, taking everything into consideration, Ms blood is good "eqojjgli; for ^honorable mention. I believfe there is no yellow ribbon to be given.on, this occasion, if there^was, I' would say by all means give it /to ^" Clinker," as he. is really a gre*it> favorite :jwith tie: public;^ and 'so tar eb I know well deserving of the public respectia&d; support. T hear'there are , four of the judges out of the eight in favor ; flf Miiij tiid'if sb, of course" he tiaWes first \- j place ind'jgets the blue ribbon, which lie "will not disgrace. • -Tke¥%hird likely competitor is Eome ■ thing "the public -ought to be "fulLiip : His name -is '*Spot,"M:;by1 "Beri^dictj" out of Miss Piggotfc.' He , is not a bad .workinghorHe;.but those of . the: public who. know .him say that he is a real,, deception, without ■ either pace1 or staying qualities. He has, l understahd, ' competedbefore' -on^mSny' occasions, arid .once by: a great' fluke '■ gained Jion'6rs," jind there was ridbbdy'inbre disgusted than the judges who awarded Kim the prize, oil that 'aufepicious1 'occasion, for,, scandalous t : to :ielfite,i after the honors conferred on * hitu'iie'dfagged the bonnie blue ribbon through the mud, and not only mud, but it 'got mixed with rum and slops,. and ' consequently was not fit to be handed, down to posterity. Nor has he proved fit to become worthy of the blue ribbon' again, so l - cannot see [■ where lie has'-the ghost of a show.f V,-V";' J . - Herd -fends' the second lesson on coming, sports.' fi5fcmo^ leadSj other competitors follow. This is nione of your " Jimmie's gone a droving." ■ ? j • ,,,, y
