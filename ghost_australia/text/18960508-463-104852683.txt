POETRY. A OHUJY NIGHT. I rae at the dead of night, 'And went to the lattice alone To look for my mother's ghost Where the ghostly moonlight shone. My; friends had failed one by one, Middle aged, young and old, ^Tdl the ghosts were warmer to me Than my friends that had grown cold, I looked and I saw the ghosta Dotting plain and mound ; They stood in the blank moonlight, Siit no shadow lay on the ground. They spoke without a voice And they^Ieaped without a sound. I called : ' Oh my Mother dear,'— ? I sobbed : ' Ok my Mother kind, ' Make a lonely bed for me And shelter' it' from the Wind.' '' Tell the others not to come To see me night or day ; But I need not tell my friendi To be sure to keep away.' ' My mother 'raised her eyes, ' They were blank and could not eee ; Yet they held me with their stare, While they seemed to look at me. She opened her mouth and spoke, I could not- hear a word; \- While my flesh crept on my bones And every hair was stirred. She knew that I could hot hear The message that she toW, ' '? Whether I had long to wait Or soon should sleep in the mould ; .3 saw -her toss her shadowless hair And wring her hands in the cold. 1 strained to catch her words, And she strained to make me hear ; Sue never a sonnd of word* Fell on my straining ear. - .From midnight to the cockcrow I kept my watch in pain, .While the subtle ghosts grew subtler In the sad eight oo the wane. JFroin midnight to the cockcrow . X watched till all were gone, ? , Some to sleep in the shifting sea And some under turf and stone; Living had failed and dead had failed, '..' And I was indeed alone. ,'. — Christina Bobsetti. .
