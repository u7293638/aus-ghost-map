Johnstone's Bay Sailing Club. A race for all boats (handicapped), any sails, in connection with the Johnstone's Bay Sailing Club, took place on Saturday afternoon, for club prizes of £12, £6, and £2, being first, second, and third respectively. The boats entered, with their time allowances (received at the start), were as follow : Pandora, 19ft, scratch ; O.K. and Cygnet, each 18ft., 1/2 minute behind; Edith, 18ft., 1 1/2 minute ; Maritana, 20ft., 2 minutes ; Bettina, 20ft., 3 minutes ; Nereus, Cynthia, and Grace Darling, each 20ft., 5 1/2 minutes ; Portia, 22ft., and Triton, 22ft., each 5 1/2 minutes; Rosetta, 22ft., and Victor, 20ft., each 6 minutes ; Marvel, 22ft., 7 minutes ; Carlotta and Ghost, each 24ft., 8 1/2 minutes ; Lillian, Violet, and Latona, 22ft., each 9 1/4 minutes ; Volunteer, 24ft., 12 minutes ; Lottie, Mantura, and Enterprise, each 24ft., 12 1/2 minutes. The course was from a flying start in Johnstone's Bay, round Shark Island, thence round the starter's boat, Fort Denison, and back to flagboat moored in Johnstone's Bay. With the exception of the Violet, Ghost, Maritana, and Grace Darling, the others as entered came to the start. At 3.20 p.m. the first flag was lowered for the Pandora, and as their respective times elapsed O. K. and Cygnet, followed by the rest, were des- patched, Edith being some minutes late. All carried racing canvas, and in consequence the fresh north- easter proved a little too strong for many of them. On the work down the harbour, the Portia very quickly outsailed the craft that started on the same limit with her, and more than hoed her own from the fast 24-footers Mantura and Lottie. A new craft, the Enterprise, sailed by G. Holmes, jun., also led the pair to the island. Victor, before squarring away at the beacon, had passed no less than eight of her oppononts, Portia and O. K. being still ahead of her ; the breeze proved too strong for Pandora, this boat retiring early in the race. Before reaching Shark Island the Portia had assumed command of the fleet, followed by the O.K., and the times at the jibe were as follow :-Portia, 4h. 20m. 50s. ; O. K., 4h. 23m. 10s. ; Cygnet, 4h. 23m. 30s. ; Victor, 4h. 23m. 40b. ; Triton, 4h. 25m. ; Carlotta, 4h. 25m. 19a. ; Rosetta, 4h. 25m. 21s ; Bettina, 4h. 25m. 22s. ; Nereus, -111. 25m. 32s. ; Latona, Iii. 27m. ; Enterprise, 4h. 27m. 6s.; Volunteer, 4b. 27m. 15s. ; Marvel, 4h. 2?in. l"o. ; Mantura, du. 27m. 22s. ; Lillian, 4h. 08m. 30s. ; Lottie, 4h. 29m. 59s; Cynthia, ?Hi. 30m. 30s. ; and Edith 3 seconds later. Balloon jibs and topsails were added to the already heavy press of canvas carried, the extra pressure driving them along at a great pace. A good race ensued between the Latona and Enterprise as far as Dawes Point, where the latter obtained the lead of her rival. When off Miller's Point a jibe was neces- sary to enable them to make Johnstone's Bay. The wind at this juncture came rather squally ; the boats, being due before it, began to roll rather dangerously ; the crews were kept low to try and steady them, but with the Enterprise it was of no avail ; in a heavy roll she filled up and capsized. Bettina come on a wind, lowered her sails, and stood by her for a short time, until a steamer came and picked the crow up ; the rest of the fleet got safely through, but before reaching the flagboat, the Volunteer treated her crew to a bath, and the Lillian and O. K. gave up. The order rounding the boat was- Portia, Victor, Mantura, Carlotta, Latona, Rosetta, Lottie, Triton, Marvel, Cygnet, Edith, and Cynthia. On the beat to Fort Denison the Latona passed the Carlotta, and Lottie the Rosetta ; bottom jibs and topsails were set for the run to the finish, the Mantura slowly but surely overhauling the Victor, which had, up to this time, done remark- ably well. When clear of Dawes Point, Mantura set a squaresail, a neck-and-neck race resulting to Miller's Point, where the big boat passed her saucy rival, and the flagboat was passed as follows : Portia, at 5h. 42m. 3s. ; Mantura, 5h. 45m. 38s. ; Victor, 5h. 45m. 57s. ; Latona, 5h. 47m. 21a. ; Car- lotta, 5h. 47m. 39s. ; Triton, 5h. 48m. 24s. ; Lottie, 5h. 48m. 40s. ; Nereus, 5h. 50m. 16a. ; and Marvel, 5h. 55m. The Rosetta capsized off Peacook's Point and the others were not timed, thus the prizes go to Portia, Mantura, and Victor, which were sailed by George Ellis, F. Hopkinson, and George Fletcher, sen., respectively. The steamer Invincible followed the race, having a large number on board. Messrs. G. Trouton, J. F. Dwyer, und IH. Ellis were the officials of the day.
