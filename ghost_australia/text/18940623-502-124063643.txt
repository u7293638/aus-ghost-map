LEi US FORGET. Lot ua forirot Tho memories that bind us foot To our mistakes, outgrown and past ; Tho truBt betrayed, tho tarnished samn, Tho look of scorn, tho blush of shamo, Lot us forget. Let us forget That onoo wo atrovn for nelfinh gain, Regardless nf another's pain ; Tho vaiu rcmorso, tho Ronsa of Ions, The burden of our self made cross, Lot us forgot. Let us forget Tho Blights, tho btings, tho anguished tears That marked tho paths of by-gono years ; Tho bitter cup,- tho dark despair, Tho ono sad hour which nouo might eharo Let ui forgot. Let ns forgot Ail-but tho love, tho graco, tho light That boro us t ? our pre-ent height, ?And haunting ghost 4 of grief and caro The guiso of angel hosts shall wear. Let us forgot. -Ida W. Wheolor.
