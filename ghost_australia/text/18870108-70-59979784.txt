The thirty-seventh intei-colouiul cricket match botweeu'New South Wales aud Victoria was commenced ou 27th December uud con cluded on the 30th on tho Melbourno cricket ground.

An interesting match for tho Graeco-Koman wrestling championship of the world and .£100, bet\vo2U Tom Cuuiiou, a now arrival froin Xinericu, aud WJlljain Miller, the Victorian athlete, took, place on , tho stage of. the Opera House ou Saturday, 18th Dec , in the presence of au overcrowded house. A large aniouut of interest was taken In the matcliVv Miller was a strong favorite from the out set,' ??and when the nieu ap peared on the sta^o stripped;, for the. encounter, the physical superiority of tho -Victoriun was ap parent. Tho match was' commenced at ? thirty tvvo. minutes past 3' o'clock with a lot of head aud arm work;, with alternate body work ou the curpot, tliroughoutwhich C/uiuou forced the play, aud made several ineffectual' attempts to accomplish tho -wrist grip for which Whistler .was.solfamQus.iu- the-arena.. - T-w-ice during tho contest Canuou lifted Miller bodily from the floor uud threw him over his shoulder, but failed iu falling with him to take him ut a disud vuutage. Miller, 'notwithstanding Ins groat weight fell deftly like -a cat, ami in each instance had his opponent in chancery on Touching the carpet. At ten minutes to 4 o'clock Cutmon got a haimnerlock, and suc cojded in turning Miller over, aud «oiug over in Mke manner himself) but neither athlete touched bis shoulders ; but Mr. Clark, who acted as referee, declared a fall without being appealed to, and n considerable ainoniitof noisy dissent, and confusion resulted. Cannon pive up the fall as there evidently were, ho said. 99 out of every 100 agaiust the deci sion of ihe umpire. After a considerable amount of very heavy play, Miller, at 27 minutes past 4 o'clock, succeeded in getting a half Nelson grip, aud turn ing his opponent over on his back. . After nn interval of a quarter of an hour, the contest was resumed, but it was evident from the changed character of the play that somo thin; w-.is wrong. Caution forced the play, and s icsoedtid, in exactly 6 minutes, in gettiug a haimnerlock. and turning Miller quietly over on his back. After the men had retired to their rooms it was found that Miller had, during the first 20 minutes of the match, broken tho eighth rib on tho right side, and, as the bone was protrud ing, Dr. Willmott declared that it was im possible for the match to proceed. Under the circumstances Caunon claimed the match. The proceedings, which terminated shortly before 5 o'c ock, m ere carried out in a very orderly aid futibfuclory manner.
