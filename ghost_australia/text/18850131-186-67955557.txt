; HER ENGAGEMENT RING. Faxxte Gerraid Lad been engaged to be married to young Dr. Harry Raymond, the nephew- of a wealthy New York physician, whose extensive practice was expected, to soon descend to Iiis young relative. Iii the mean time Harry went off on a. l°uy sea voyage with an invalid friend, leaving a betrothal ring on the little white hand of the lovely girl who had promised to be his wife when he returned. The ring was handsome and unique, with , its splendid solitaire, and their combined ini tials in tiny diamonds embedded inside the golden hoop ; and of course Fannie valued it for its beauty as well as for the love for which it was the pledge. But when news came to her that the ship in which her lover sailed had not been heard of for many weeks, and that it was considered lost, having en tered southern latitudes, where a terrific hurricane hod done fearful damage, then the ring became a sacred thing to her as the last gift of the dead. Pate had brought other trials to the poor girl since the loss of her lover. Her father had died, and subsequently her mother's money, upon which they were almost depen dent, had been swallowed upiu a bank fail It became necessary for Fannie to eke out the small remaining inunuc by turning her accomplishments to account. It was then that the thought of parting with the precious ring occurred to her for the first time, although ail her others jewels had gone long since The idea came to her with » sharp pang that was almost an agony, but baring come to her, it became a settled pur pose. 'T need no reminder to keep me true to his memory,' she murmured, while heavy tears overflowed through the long, curling lashes and fell, glittering rivals upon the „ diamond which she raised to her lips and friggfwi itpnin ami again with p' *=**'*' a t ** fer Having made up her mind to the sacrifice, pannie pot ou her drooping hat and tied a black vefl tightly over her fair sensitive face ; then, with rapid steps, she left the house and hastened to the jewelry establishment around the corner, at the window of which she had often stopped to admire the Jw.gyKnjr con tents. 'Ib it your own?1* asked the old man, with a awiAifujr loot in his keen grey eyes at tike young girl, who had made her request in such low and trembling tones. ??Oh, yes,** she answered simply, uncon Eptous of BuspicioiL. *' It was my engage ment ring,' and she colored faintly, then y.^»H ngW.iT- yjth panr^'* thoughts. ' It Is a very valuable one for you,' said the jeweler, slipping it on the first joint of his finger *nA dancing at Fannie's npftt but decidedly shabby raiment. *' The gentleman was rich and so was I then,** rf*p answered nwirtly, t*hwkir\g her rising indignation with the self-control which experience bad blight her. ' The gentleman to whom I was engaged to be married went away on a long voyage ff!kttt was lost at sea,* she said, ** and then my father died and left us poor, so that I have been obliged to sell my jewels. I kept this till 'the last. WHI you please to 6ny it, sir** ' The old man, being a Scotchman, said : ** Umph, nmph I' and polished l»» spec tacles, THHr'iHTfnfT ** Pnir lassie !' Then he told her he would value her ring, pave her a receipt, for which she had not thought of asking, and told her to come hack in. the mnraitig. About ten minutes after Fannie Gerrard jpft. J)agald Bloike'fi store e, yonng 'inn walked up the avenue with lone, rapid strides, watching tlip passers-by and the objects around with a half -curious, half-familiar arid wholly pleased attention. He entered Mr. Bluike's store and drew out bis watch. ** I wish you would be good enough to ex amine thf« watch of mi'**, ' he Baid pleasantly. *' Something has gone wrong with it all of a sudden. No sooner did I arrive at home safe and sound than it became refractory after scrvin' me faithfully through 'hair breadth scapes by flood and field' — especially by flood ? I hope it is not ominous,' And the returned traveller laughed as he handed the timepiece to the old man. 41 Nothing more pT»»TiiTi^T tlmn a broken mainspring,' replied Air. Blaikie, '''Tire, ' We will have it ready for you to-morrow, sir.' And then as he watched the stranger go out, with his youthful, swinging stride, hifi mind recurred to the girl who had told him of the lover ** hist at isea,' f'1^ he sighed over bis work. Harry Raymond had not gone far before be was accosted by the ringing voice of an old friend. ' Hello Raymond, old fellow ! Where in the name of all that's wonderful have you sprung from ? Why, dear boy, everyone be lieves you long since at the bottom of the uea. or blown away by all sorts of simooms, or typhoons, or whatever you call 'em !' ' Blown away as much as you like, old boy,' laughed Raymond, wringing his com panion's hand heartily, ' but not under water yet, as you see. Bat, come — give me some land news, won't you ? This is my finst day in the city, and I haven't seen anyone- 'yet. How is — everybody ?' ** Well, much as usual, I guess. But come over to my rooms, and maybe I ran be more definite.' The young tnaw slipped his arm through Baymond'&tjpid; they sauntered on together. 'Oh, by the way,' said Jack Gordon, speeches, ** you have just turned up in time to be too late for the marriage of an oldaveet heart of yours — Fannie Gerrard. Xl^n^M an old chap with heaps of money, too.' 'What— what did you say?' said Dr. Raymond, clutching the arm that lay on his, and stopping short in the street. *' I said that your old flame, Fannie Gerrard, was married yesterday to old Mr. Roberts, the millionaire. Why, what's the matter? What are you staring at? You look as if you had seen a ghost !' Dr. Raymond drew his hand across his face once or twice before he replied. 11 1 beg your pardon,' he said. 'I have i'ust remembered an important engagement, — I will have to leave you now.' *' Oh, Tni sorry !' Bnt never mind ! Drop in in the evening and have a chat. Good-by, for the present. Delighted to have met And Jack disappeared around a corner, saTOgely randpjnniTifr fojq *'lonfj tongue' and tVnL-iwg all kinds of things of the girl who could so soon forget a fellow like Raymond. Harry Raymond walked on with bent head and downcast eyes. All the animation and brightness were gone from his face — all interest in his surroundings banished by a few careless words. 11 Married !' he repeated — ' married to another, and my heart true to her through all ! Oh, fickle frith Ires heart of woman !' And, with a harsh, bitter laugh he drew his hat over his brow and strode on, he knew not whither, in til night found him jn his own rooms, worn out by fatigue and misery. And so passed the first night of Harry Raymond's return home. When Fannie Gerrard entered the jeweller's shop next morning she was somewhat embarrassed to find a young gentleman talk ing to Mr. Blaikie, withdrew shyly to the other ^n*1 of the counter. The old gentleman, recognizing her at once, to wait upon her. ' I will buy your ring for $150,' he said. ?4 Will you part with it for that?' fnpni-t'a face elbowed her «1 iga-ppoinfrnwut . '* I thought it was worth more than that — intrinsically,' she said. 'Two hundred at least.' The Scotchman shook his head and pressed his lips together, for although he was in terested in the 'puir lassie,' he did not for get Christine Johnstone's precept that 'beez- She looked at the ring with longing eyes, half tempted not to make the sacrifice at all, when she was startled by a voice beside her. 'I will buy during for $500, since the lady is « anxious to obtain a good price for it!6 Well did Fannie Gerrard know that voice, though never before had she beard it ring with i*''1' t^mrtn on h wcorn as it now fell utktii her ear. With a gtj*ifMTg inclination to af*****'!?, which she suppressed to a gasp, she turned and in voluntarily held out both hands, while a look of mingled **n^r^mfJit. delight and love shone inner face. Then, meeting nothing bnt a strange Mffiilft of mMrrafal Irifctwuif'* upon the fruftirpa that littA become to her tJinrr of a saint, nrift where, htthfrto sbe ^*d seen naught bnt glowing tenderness, she drew back as though stung. One piteous look she gave toward the old man, who stood watching his strange patrons with an absorbed interest, then she shnadered, reeled, and would have fallen to the floor had not Mr Blaikie caught her in hi« wifib. He bore her into an adjoining parlor, and calling his daughter, left the far'**wg girl in her care and returned to where Pr. Raymond stood, with a pale, set face, gnawing his mustache. ** Is the young lady better ? I un a physi cian. Can I be of any use professionally *' ' So you are her lover— the lad who was lost at sea.?' said Dugald Bbukic, not noticing the question. 'What do you know about me— or her?' Raymond asked, sharply. '* Enough to know that you have caused sufficient trouble and grief by your absence without breaking the bairn's heart altogether, now that you have come back. Hech, mon,' continued Dugald, falling into broad Scotch, under the influence of excitement, **na lad ever had less cause for cauldne&a; or suspeec Harry Raymond's lip trembled and his face flushed. ' You do not understand,' he said. ' She was my betrothed wife, and I return to find her — married !' ' Married *™ exclaimed Due&ld;, blankly. ' Yes, married to a. wealthy dotard, and anxious to get rid of that ring lest she should be disturbed by unpleasant, associations.' And as he thus expressed this suggestion of his fevered fancy his voice was raised in resentful passion. The bewildered girl heard the words, and standing in the doorway with a face of marble pallor and her slender figure proudly erect, she said : ' You are strangely miwfa».lr.*ji, Mr Ray mond. I am not married, nor ever have been. I wished to sell my ring because I was in absolute need of money. However, it is yours now, without any equivalent !' And with a haughty bend of the head, she would have passed him by ; but Harry end dently turned and caught her in bis arms, and before she could protest, she was seated on the sofa in good old Dugald Blaikie'e parlor with her repentant lover at her feet. 'Oh, forgive me, darling — pray forgive me !' be pleaded. *' I was hastening to find told that yon were recently married ! But I was mad — wicked to doubt you, and throw myself ou your mercy !' And he seized the little hands, nervously clasped together, and covered them with kisses. 'It was my cousin,' she answered reproach fully. ** Ah 1 but I knew naught o! her, and to me, sweetheart, there is bnt one Fannie Gerrard in all the wide world.**
