In a second he was full of schemes of costume. He would igooas this, he would go -as that; his sister must-be Pharaoh's- Daughter; must- be Cotisuelo, must be Lady Jane Grrey. In imagination he tumbled all the centuries .together, and played hop, skip, and jump through history. In the end lie was forced to confess that he did f not know what to do: There came to his aid a practical young man. \ & :j |': l~: [[] \\\, ; L 'The simplest thing jin tthie world,' said G-eorge Miller, with, a superior air, 'You come with me to a man in Bow street ; he will show you colored places ; you can hare a dress made for you, or you can see what he has. I will go with you ; he will charge you ever sio much too much if you let him.' ' And you — have you got your dress V* asked Druihmorid, with a modest air, of this experienced person ? '... ' It is being made/' said he carelesly, ' I am going as OharleB I.' ' I have a message for you as regards that/': said Mrs. Warrener, looking at him in her quiet and humorous way. ' Violet was over here yesterday. She bade metell you you must go to theball as Ronieo.'- ' : All the carelessness went out of the young man's manner in a second. ; \ ' N6 ! ' said he. ' Did she reaUy % It is n6t a joke F 'I have delivered the messacB as 1 fbift* ' '?-. ??'?;,?- ???'? ?' 'By Joyei . Then I must telegraph to them to stop the Charles I. dress— oh, Idon'ticare whether I have to pay for it or not !— in any case \ will go as Romeo.' And then he added quickly, with a flush in his. face, ' Don't you think the joke a gppdvrOne? She was making fun, of course ; but what a joke it will be to sur prise' her P '' i....: . ? '-r forthwith it was arranged that these three should makeup a little party to go tp Bowrstreet ; and on their way thither it almost* seemed as if Mr. Drummond had gone out of his senses. Young Miller -tid not -understand this kind of 'thing. Imaginary ' conversations between dis carded icostumes about the character of their, successive wearers ? Ghosts getting into. &: costumier's repository, and having a tancyidress ball byphosphorescent lignt. He treated such nonsense with impa tience f he would rather have understood clearly what dress. Mr. Drummond pro posed to wear. ? -Theni even in presence of thegrave and puzzled; costumier; also, young Miller, as a shrewd arid practical person, perceived that this, was a matter of business, and not a subject for all manner of whimsical absurdities.

'v ; Qn¥evenirig that Jittle garden in Gam-: bertrell saw a strange 3 sight, j It was neatly dusk j under the cherryrand nipple trees' there was almost ^darkneas; . Arid' ?what; was this iall and ailerit figure, clad irpm head to heel in a cloak of sombre red| witii a, sword thrusting out the cloak, behind, with a.:peak«d black cap coming dow.n on 'the forehead, -and ^hsirsnnv mounted, by ^t tailored feather thatJiere and! therfefbruBn^a^fe le^ey 6f the' tret*1 Wl^at ininii^ oimin^aa'MgVi^^W shadows under the strangely ^ vivid eyes, with cadaverous Qhee^sVr with pointed beard and curled[ jnoustache, ' and with a fiendish grin on his lips? Then a younger .man stepped' down from^he balcony; -and behold the yoiith was bravely iclad in blue 'and .silver, with a cape of velvet hanging .from his shoulders ; and there was ]a soft yellow down on his uppex lip ; and, a look of gay laughter f about his handsome face. He, in turn, was followed by a beautiful : arid, gentle creature, who' wore lier yellow hair in two long plaits behind/ and who appeared in a simple dress of white,-* with its tight sleeves and its satchel touched here and there with bluei strangely enough, as the three 'figures walked here and. there through- the twilight *f the garden, Mephistopheles, Romeo, and Margare'te? spoke the same language, and laughed with the same light laughter. It was their dress- rehearsal ; the solitary spectator being a young lady in the balcony, who said they looked like ghosts, and hoped she should not dream of them that night. The important evening at length ar rived ; and Mr. Miller had arranged -. to dress at James Drummond's house, for he was quite sure that, without his super vision, Mephistopheles would be fount! lacking in fiendish eyebrows and mous tache. James Drummond was not accus tomed to these things.; he was a mere child in the hands of young Miller, who dealt; with this matter in a serious and didactic fashion. The big house in Euston-square was all lit up ; Chinese lanterns were hung along the covered way leadirig_.dowri to the gate i and on the pavement a large number of people had assembled to watch the arrivals descend from the carriages and walk up that lane of dimly- colored light. Inhere was a mur mur, of surprise when a tall gaunt figure in sombre red stalked by ; with a whisper of 'The Devil !' Romeo was a little bewildered ; he was wondering hpw Violet . would be dressed; whether she would be kind or proud /whether she would dance' with many people. He resolved that he would not stay in the room if she danced with any one other than himself ; and he already hated that unknown stranger. Mote brilliant lights ; a sound of dis tant music; some servants, with staring eyes and anxious manner; Mr. Drummond taps young Romeo on the shoulder. ' You are in the way.' He j stands aside ; and two strange creatures go by. ' Thank you,' says one of them cour teously. 'You have allowed two centuries to pass.' F . As vet thev are but encountering the outward ripples of the great whirlpool within. Cleopatra, proud and dusky, with golden ornaments pendant over her forehead, -comes out into the cooler air of the hall ; she is attended by an execu tioner, draped in black, and masked. Whose are these enormous scarlet feathers sweeping back from the cowl? Surely they and the long slashed cloak belong to a High Baron of Germany? There, at the foot of the stairs, Mary Queen of Scots is chatting pleasantly with a tall youth dressed as chef de cuisine ; beside them stands the redoubtable Jean Sans terre, the lights gleaming on his suit of cnain mail, ms nuge snield and battle axe. Harlequin whips by ; the solemn Master of Ravenswood appears with Ophelia on his arm; the mightyhearted Barbarossa and the Pille du Regiment, laughing and talking together, are making for the ball-room. .;.-.. ' ' Art thou not Borneo and a Montague?' At the sound of that well-known voice Pur three strangers turned1 instan taneously; what wonderful vision was this-4riot the. Violet North they knew, but Juliet herself descended in all her beauty from the mooalit balcony — her face a trifle pale, perhaps, but that may have been the reflected light of her robes of white satin — her magnificent black hair looking blacker because voT*this gleaming dress^— her dark eyes full of fire/ an*i light,- arid gladness — the proud/ sweet mouth partly opened in the ex- ; citement of the moment, and just show ing a glimmer of niilkwhite teeth; Young Romeo was altogether overwhelmed/ : blindedj bewildered. What great con-, descension was this;— or was she but toying with him; she the fullgrown woman still fancying that he was but a youth ? There was more of the girl than of the woman, however, in the delight of her face, in the eager fashion in which she insisted on showing them where Lady North was posted. ' Oh, Violet, how lovely1 you look in that dress !' Mrs. Warrener could not help saying, in an undertone. ^ 'Can we get up the stairs?' the girl said. ' Lady North is on the landing. Mr. Drummond, shall we lead the way f' Surely Romeo and Juliet should have gone together. Romeo was rather silent when he saw that beautiful creature in the white satin and pearls pass in with the tall figure in sombre red. ITcr a few seconds the crush on the stairs kept them jammed on and motion less at one: point of the ascent. Violet turned iroundj. Romeo was just beneath ; and she said to lumy with a tender sweet ness— ' :' ? ? ? - ' ? ' ; ? ' ?/ ?' Sow oam-t tkou hither, tell me I and where* ...'. fo»i?. ,-? :, ?.., l':- ,i: --;?'.

HeTiad not asked Violet to dance. : . . They looked in on the wonderful as semblage of picturesque figures^-certain groups of them here and there in motion — a sound of music all through the place — ^the brilliant colors and diverse forms almost bewildering the eye. The fair Juliet, her hand , still on the arm of the tall and sombre Mephistophales, showed him a certain little pink card./ ' I' have notr given away, one dance; yet/f said she. ' Do you wish me to ask you to dance,' he replied. 'Yes.' ' It is Romeo who ought to dance with Juliet.'

'Come,' she said, ' I will take you all round by another way to the balcony* and ' you .will see everything from there. That twill be better than 'fighting' across the room. But perhaps you wish to dance. Mr. Miller ?' . ' . ' No, thank you,' said he gruffly. She would take no notice of his man ner. She said gently— ? — , ' If you will follow usj then^ , we can go round tor the balcony .and have a nice cool place almost to ourselves.

They were a sufficiently handsome couple, these two young people, as they stood there for a moment ' together— the1 slim, square shouldered young fellow in b|ue velvet and silver, with- his fine features all lit up how by a new gratitude and pleasure, and 'tiie tall,: shapely, proud-featured girl, whose hair seemed blacker than iHe raven's wing in contrast with the gleaming white of her dress. After that they j.werfi visible but from time to. time in the whirl . of wonderful shapes and colors that moved to the light, rapid, and harmonious music. _ ? - 'That is the beautiful time of life,' Drummond said to - his sister, as they watched these two go by. ' Youth, health, bright spirits, the joy of living uie uuwau ui.uiorexjr looking at It — ^-ana. yet there is some sadness about .-the spectacle. Not to them, of course ; only to the looker on. They are riot thinking of to-morrow, nor yet of middle age, nor of any doubt or disquiet, Look at them '—don't you wish you could make this moment eternity f Or them, and prolong that delight of rapid motion for ever and ever?' 'I do not,' his sister said promptly. '1 don't know, what yeu. mean, James ; but you are always coupling these two together/ as if they must necessarily marry.' ' Why not ?' said he rather absently. ? ' You know very well ; the notion of a proud, high-spirited girl like Violet marrying a young man like that— who has got no more imagination, or feeling, or mind than a block of- wood- !' ' You are never fair to' young Miller, Sarah ; he is quite as intelligent as most young men ; and he is. far more willing to improve himself than any I know.' it TT~ _1.__)i. _____ TT;-.l_i.- f!J . 'You used to like him well enough.'* 'Yes; because I never dreamed that anything ? serious would, come of that foolish adventure of theirs. But now I am sure he means to marry her if she will let him ; and I think she has a tender, half-romantic interest in him at which she larighs, but which is likely to make mischief.' . - ' That is how you describe marriage ?' said he: \ ? ' / But'atf this moment the two young, people came back — flushed, eager, gay in spirits ; Romeo in . ©special being de lighted, and showing his delight by being anxious to share it. Mrs. Warrener must really go in and dance. The flash ing, by of the different characters was wonderful. Hai she seeri Henry VI IT, go down ? What was this perfume they were burning ? - Then he was anxious that Violet should give him the next dance, and, the next dance, and the next again. But -she re fused. She was not going to desert her friends. When this present dance was over, she invited Mephistopheles' to walk with her through jthe room that they might look at the crowd toge ther ; and Romeo and Margarete followed, the former quite glad and contented now. It is true that he had more rivals than ever. Violet North was known to l-ut few of her stepmotheris-guestjs ; but the appearance of the girl was too striking to escape unnoticed ; . arid there were all an introduction to the beautiful young lady dressed as Juliet. That. young lady was exceedingly courteous to these suc cessive stranger*-; but how could ^she promise them a dance, seeing that her card was full to the very last line 1 t So the night went by, in music/ laughter, .and -gladness.; and' they had; supper all by themselves in that Jittle room, the fair Juliet being queen of the feast ; and, Lady North sat with' thejri for a time, arid said some pretty things, about Margarete'- dress ; and Violet's father looked in on = them, and _aid-to young Miller, 'Well, .sir, been running away with ' any more schoolgirls lately 2' As for the young lady herself, the,, light on lier face was something to look at ; il seemed to one sitting there that youtk had nothing more beautiful to gi?e thj&a; such a night. ; J~: ; ' :, ^ 'What io you think ol ii all f* 8l» «aid to Mr, Drummond, when they ^ren- back into the b^ll-ro6mA to IqqJe oH $X & -low and stately minuet, thai w?^ Wjjc danced by a few expei'ta, « IipnV^' think it la lovelv V f , - ii ,.2 hght.pf it u the datt^-at I see in your faee.

Violet, on the other hand, was pale, concerned, and silent. When Greorgo Miller took Mrs. Warrener away into the room, Violet, left alone with' Mr. Drum tuond, said little, but that little was said, with an unusual earnestness of kindness. He would have been surprised by, it, but that he knew how i anxiously kind she- * always was to her old friends. a He drew her attention to a strange blue light that began to be visible even through: the ruddy awning of the balcony.
