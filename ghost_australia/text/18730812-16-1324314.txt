INTERCOLONIAL NEWS. A TBATEZB accident happened at South Creek the other night, when a guy rope gave way, and one of the poles supporting the trapeze rope swayed. A male performer had a narrow escape from serious injury, being hurled nearly horizontally about sixty feet when he attempted a leap, and by falling from the rope a female received a few bruises. ONE of those disturbances common to seafaring life occurred on Thursday night, 24th July, on board the ship Arden Craig, then lying in the harbor at Newcastle. A row was started in the forecastle between the seamen, and the mate went forward to restore order, but was threatened by the noisy belligerents with violence if he attempted to interfere One of the sailors, a colored man, threatened to take his life if he came in, and was in the act of leaning over his bunk to got a belaying pin to carry his threat into execution when the mate who had an iron roller in his hand, struck the man on the head, inflicting an ugly gash a few inches above the left eye. This was the commencement of a general row. The mate, seeing how matters stood, made for the after cabin, followed by the infuriated seamen, with belaying pins and other implements, which were used as missiles, at the same time threatening to take the lives of the officers and burn the ship. The chief officer made his escape in the ship's boat, gave information to the police, and three of the ringleaders were arrested, and taken to the lock-up On being brought before the local bench next morning, on a charge of disorderly conduct, the man the mate had struck presented an unsightly appearance, the whole, of the left side of his face being covered with clotted blood The three men were sent to the cells for forty eight hours -Maitland Met cary AT the Adelaide Local Court, on Wednesday, July 9, in the unsatisfied judgment case of Ann M'Carthy v Wm Connor, defendant, who seemed rather drunk, lounged easily into the witness box, and the following colloquy took place -Clark "Your name?"

On Wednesday they visited the seams on Stockyard Creek, about a mile north-west the township of Foster, which were discovered by Mr David Hill in December last The weather was fine, so that the trip through the scrub, which is very dense was not an unpleasant one. Mr Carter, who has been here for some time making arrangements for leasing a portion of the ground, on behalf of a party of gentlemen, acted as guide. He had previously exposed the main seam, two feet thick, at two separate places, a couple of hundred yards apart, and opened up the strata so that the formation could be distinctly seen. At one of the places a bench of the seam about two yards square has been stripped, and left bare.
