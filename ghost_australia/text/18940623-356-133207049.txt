A PItIMITIVE PI.OPLE. Tu': people of Aran, on the west coast of Ireland, where there is so much distress at present,.are excep tionally honest, straightforward, and upright in their dealings, and illegiti macy is almost unknown. Most' of tho weddings occur just before Lent. There is no courtship, the young man going straight to the house of an eligiblo girl and asking her to many. him. If refused, he goes elsewhere, and a man has boon known to ask three girls the same evening before he was accepted. A corpse is always led out through the back door, for the Aranitos believe in fairies, banshees, and ghosts. Constunors of Wax Veeuts must be careful to see that they get Bryant and May's only, which are the very best in quality, and 20 per cent. more in quantity than the foreign mado wax vestas.
