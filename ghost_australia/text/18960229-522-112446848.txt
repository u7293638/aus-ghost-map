LETTERS TO THE EDITOR. Bowral Christian Convention. SIR,-In Mr. Guthrie's letter of Saturday, 15th inat. in answer to mine of the previous Saturday, he starts off by oharging me with a display of ignorance, I at once pleao "guilty" to thiB charge, for the more I read and the more I know, the less I seem to know. Mr. Guthrie nest charges me with inventing the term "the Blessing" evidently with a sneer {but how he gets at the sneer I don't know) ; my answer to this charge is " not guilty " for the following reason: The Rev. Allan Webb is the first man I have.ever heard use suoh an expression. Had the rev: gentleman spoken of receiving a manifestation of the spirit whereby ho gained more light and know ledge, there would have been no more misconcep tion. I ha\e heard of several being puzzled over what he called " The Blessing." I heard of one Christian man over seventy years of age, saying he did not understand suoh talk, he had never heard of such a thing before, yet he is a greater reader. I think sir, that Mr. Guthrie oould not have been at the meeting or he would not have written in the manner he has. Now to the main issue. I hold that the receiving of a blessing from the Holy Ghost is not separate ahd distinct from conversion, but a continuation, a progression of the divine life, which begins at con version. The beginning of life is always the most important part of our existence. If any of us have an illness, and we recover from that illness, we say it was a "Blessing," but that blessing is not distinct and separate from our life, it's a continuation, a progression of life. I consider it is'the same , with:' the spiritual life, as I said in my .'first letter, where there is divine life there must be progress.- God through the : medium of the Holy Ghost manifests' Himself to the individual. ' I think it was " Top lady" who said he hai three manifestations of the spirit daring his life. If this is what theBev. Allan Webb meant, it is quite understandable. I believe that men whom God Bets apart to preaoh the goBpel, receive the power of the Holy Ghost in a greater degree than the average Chistrian, and some preachers receive the ministrations-of the spirit more than others. Mr.'Gutlirie says the old man, whioh is the carnal nature, is utterly destroyed and points to Paul's ex perience in Itomans vii, 14-25. Well, I don't find it to be Paul's experience in those verses, for he says "How to perform that which is good I find not. When I would do good evil is present with me." Now, Mr. Editor, I always tbonght the fruits of the spirit were gentleness, meekness, not falsely ac ouaing, from the man in the moon) acaoses me of bad mo tives whioh never entered my head. My reason for not giving my natno for publication is that the sub ject matter of the letter should reoeive attention and not my personality. Hoping I have not trespassed too far on your space, thanking you in anticipation. I ain, &0., A KESIDENT. Orange, lemon, and all citrus fruits can safely be planted in March and April. P. L. C.

He had a crop of beautiful sorghum worth about Â£50, but he ploughed in the whole of it rather than run the risk of letting his cows eat it and die.

BOWRAL ENTERPRISE. - We notice in a recent issue of our Sydney looming contemporary that our energetic .townsman, Mr. Thos.

ST. JUDE'S CHURCH, BOWRAL. We have been permitted to view a very handsome engraved brass tablet erected in the interior of this beautiful church by Mrs. Corbett to the memory of her sister the late Mrs. Mary M.' Sullivan, and Which is placed oil the south wall of the, church in proximity .to the stained glass window, erected by Mrs." Sullivan to the memory of her husband, the late Captain D. H. Sullivan.. The tablet, i3inche?. by 18 inches, stands on an ebony panel and bears the following inscription, "In loving memory of Mary M. Sull van, who died at her home, Burradoo Park, 26th July, 1895," and presents a very pleasing effect, as seen from the northern entrance doors to the church. The tablet was placed in position under the supervision of Mr. G. M. Pugh. LAWN TENNIS.-A match will be played at Moss Vale this Saturday after noon between teams from Bowral and Moss Vale, eight aside.

The Moss Vale team will be chosen from the following: Messrs. Pulling, Throsby, Johnson,' Stevenson, Dymock, and Walker; Misses Nicholson, E. Morrice, J. Morrice, Richardson, Oxley, Llewellen. The Bowral people are very much in debted to Moss Vale for placing their court at the disposal of the visiting team, and the only regret of Bowral is that they cannot reciprocate the kindness, but hope to do so later on. MRS. SHARP'S RELIEF.-A pub lic meeting was held at Mittagong on Monday evening last in connection with the Sharp family relief movement. Aid. ? Drabble (Mayor) in the chair. The meet ing was held for the purpose of ? receiving accounts from collectors and making ar rangements for the expenditure of the money subscribed Many suggestions were thrown out, but it was eventually ^decided to empower a committee to have a two-roomed .weatherboard cottage erec ted upon the site of the late fire.leaving.it to volunteer labor, if forthcoming, to make additions thereto. It was announced that the following moneys had been collected : -Mrs. and Miss Murray, Â£11 4s 6d ; Mesdames Draper and Griffiths, Â£8 4s ; Mesdames Stewart and Middleton, Â£3 2s 6d ; proceeds of concert organised by Mrs. Tooth, Â£10; proceeds of social at Mittagong, Â£5 5s; total Â£%] 16s. GARDEN CALENDER for March appears in this issue. Thorougly reliable. A TOMATO grown at Goulburn weighs 15 ounces, being 13 inches in cir cumference. GRAPE EATING is held responsible for killing an old man near Coonabarra bran and a little girl at Wellington. They ate the skins and seeds. TO CURE CORNS, melt two ounces of gum ammoniac, two ounces of yellow wax, and six drachms of verdigris. Mix well together, and place on the corn with a piece of rag. OLD AGE. - An Englishman, an Irishman, and a Scotchman applied at the Goulburn Police Court last Tuesday for protection. The Englishman was promised a home at Marulan by his sister; the other two will be sent to an asylum. Their ages ranged from 60 to 7a years. DECEASED WIFE'S SISTER.-At present marriage with a deceased wife's sister is lawful in New South Wales (since 1875), Victoria (1872), New Zea land (1880), and Canada (1882), and the issue is legitimate in the colonies. In Great Britain, however, marriage with' a deceased's wife's sister is unlawful, a.nd the children are in consequence illegiti mate there and cannot inherit property by descent, but only by bequest. MUSHROOMS.-It may not be gen erally known that mushrooms can be dried and so preserved for winter use, by first twisting off their stalks, stringing them on coarse thread, or fine twine, and hanging them up in a shed, or, during dry weather, across a clothes line. They soon become black and shrivelled, when they j can be put away into paper bags, or dry bottles, and used when wanted for flavor ing soups, stews, and gravies. DEATH OF THE OLDEST NA TIVE OF THE COLONY. - Mrs. Hannah Hall, relict of James Hawkes bury Hall, formerly ofMacquarie Retreat, Hawkesbury River, died on the 19th instant at the residence of her only sur viving daughter, Brookside, Parramatta River, The deceased lady, who had reached the advanced age of 90 years, was born at Portland Head, on the Haw kesbury River, in November, 1806, and is believed to have been the oldest native of the colony. A DESPERATE BULL.-One day last week a bull belonging to someone un known swam across the Hutt River (says the Auckland Weekly News) and entered a field where seven horses belonging to Gear Company were grazing. He at tacked and killed or badly gored the whole of them. Three were found dead, ripped open, and another desperately in jured on the head, with its chest torn open. The others escaped with wounds in the chest showing they had a narrow escape of being disembowled. The dam age done to the animals will hardly be covered by Â£100. ROYAL AGRICULTURAL SO CIETY OF N.S.W.-Intending exhibi tors at' the approaching grand exhibition of the Royal Agricultural Society of New South Wales are reminded that general entries close on the 2nd of March, and lato entries at double fee will be taken up to the 5th of March. The annual sub scription is one guinea and members are allowed two ladies tickets. These ladies tickets will carry special privileges this year, one being the entry to the galleries in the Centennial Hall on the occasion of the society's grand federal banquet and to all parts of the ground on the day of the official opening, when the Governors of the Australasian colonies will be pre sent. ADVANCE AUSTRALIA.-In these times of general depression it is indeed assuring and pleasant to have to chron icle the advancement of at least one Aus tralian institution. The Citizen's Life Assurance Company, Limited, which is making gigantic strides in the right direc tion.held their annual meeting a few days ! ago and the report placed before the shareholders proved to be perfectly satis factory. The great secrets of the com pany's success, were the reduc [ tion of working expenses by 8.1 per cent and the increase of income by 12 per . sent. The most stringent valuation of their policies was made, in fuct, more so than as ever been attempted by any Life Assurance Company in Australia. Im portant addresses were delivered by Messrs. J. P. Garvan, W. J. Lyne, M.L.A., John See, M.L.A., and Sir W. P. Manning, and the last named gentle man was elected to a seat on the Board. DEBATE.-The debate at the Young Men's Association on Wednesday night under mock parliamentary principle, proved very interesting and instructive. .There was a good attendance of members, and the Rev. J. Penman took the chair at 8 45. The subject, which was introduced by Mr. H. B. Linthorn, was an abstract from a bill favoring the " Abolition of the Upper House, and the introduction of the Referendum." In speaking to his motion Mr. Linthorn strongly favored the doing away with the Legislative Council alto gether, and substituting in its place the Referendum, by which a vote of the elec tors could be taken on any important measure brought forward by Parliament. This mode of procedure was in vogue in Switzerland and was found to be acting very satisfactorily. Mr. Linthorn was supported by Mr. J. Wylie. Messrs. G. Frost, N. E. Litchfield, and H. Foord spoke in opposition, but at the same time favored an elective Upper Chamber. They argued that some check should be kept on the hasty manner in which some bills were rushed through the Assembly. After Mr. Linthorn had replied, a division was called for with the result that a large majoriry favored the doing away with the second Chamber, and substituting the Referendum in its place. MASONIC INSTALLATION.-The annual installation of ofiiccrs of the lodge Jubilee, No. 162 of the United Grand Lodge of New South Wales, took place at Mittagong on Monday evening. The installation was performed by the Right Wor. Bro. Henry E. Vaughan, P.D.G.M., assisted by the Very Wor. Bro. V. BÂ» Riley, D.I.W. The following officers were installed :-Bro. T. Groube, W.M. ; Wor. Bro. W. B. Godfrey, I.P.M.; Bro1. Henry W. Edwards, S.W.; Wor. Bro. John Mealing, J.W.; Bro. John White^ treasurer; Wor. Bro. William Allan, Secretary; Wor. Bro. John Napier, X.G.: Bro. John Taylor, tyler; Bros. Beaven and Kendrick respectively S.D. and J.D. TAKING ADVANTAGE OF LEAF YEAR.-A young lady out Burradoo way is evidently sadly in need of a husband. She wrote a letter to a Bowral young gent, the other day, coached in the terms of a proposal of marriage, in which thff writer offered her heart and hand as a privilege afforded by leap year. It was headed "Old Maid's Terrace," and stated that the sender could cook and be gener ally useful about a house, in fact- do everything and be everything necessary as a useful and loving wife. An early re> ply was required, for if refused the young lady signified her intention of popping the question elsewhere. The recipient of the letter is doing well, in fact he does; not appear to have suffered anything ser ious after reading ils contents. The-, friends of W. R. F., junr., are anxiously awaiting developments, but it is generally hoped that he will not join the benedicts just yet awhile. THE REGENT SHOOTING- ACCI DENT.-Sydney Pember, on remand, wns! charged before Messrs. R. S. Mackenzie, T'. Loveridge, and Gavin George, Ju.P.r yester day with inflicting bodily harm on a boy named Arthur Kerr. The caao arose out of a shooting accident, which happened a couple of weeks baok. From the evidenoa taken it appears that a party of young fel lows went out shooting; coming to a scrub-' near Berriraa they separated, Korr going with Cole, but shortly after, howevor, lie left him to " beat " the scrub botween Colo and Poraber. A little later on, Pombei1 fired at a hare, and Kerr, who was about 4Q; yards away, received some of the contents of the gun in the back. A cry from the in-. jured boy brought the others to bis rescue,, aud he wai immediately removed to a houBo where medical atteudanoe was ob tained. Youug Korr, who had' recovered? sufficiently to attend tho court, d pised shit, tho scrub wns vory thick ; he did not see Pember firing at the haro, no cT d he think Pember had soen hira. Geor e Cc.I , who also gave evidonco, stated tha h ? had often been out shooting with P mb r, and he had always proved himself capab e of oarryiug a gun ; the p->rfcy were ull on friendly terms;, and there was 110 quar e ling whatever in dulged in during the ater.Movi. Ch Nnble, who conducted the case, said he* had further evidence ovidenco to oal', bub did not.think it necessary. Tho Bench must como to-the same conclusion as- the police,, that it was purely an accident. Tha police had boon compelie-l '0 curry through tlia> case, no matter how they disliked d'oing it The Bench immediately discharged thos accused If yon ennnot o1)tiun'"Myfa Teiv"'fn your distriot;, write to D. Mitchell and Co., Clnrenoo-Btrui'f-, Sydney, who will arrnngo for a supply at oneÂ® through the looal storekeeper.-A. RASH LITIGATION. - A case brought before the Full Court on Tuesday last furnished an apt illustraction of the? way in which people sometimes rush into* litigation for comparative trifles, and in volve themselves in heavy costs. A short time since a resident of Nowra sued a. person living in the same township to re cover the sum of Â£5 as compensation for injuries received owing, as he alleged, to the negligent driving of defendant's ser vant. Upon the conclusion of the case his solicitor, for some reason, elected to be non- suited,, but the attorney on the other side objected, and the magistrates found a verdict for the' defendant, with Â£1 5/- costs. On Tues day last the plaintiff applied for a ruler nisi for a prohibition to set aside the de-" cision, and the Chief Justice, after looking into the facts,said that if the rule nisi was; granted the matter might cost Â£xoo before it was determined, and that the costs to plaintiff already as between solicitor and! client- seeing that he had engaged a bar rister-probably exceeded tha amount he originally claimed for compensation Counsel, however, claimed that the rights: to elect to be non-suited was "an inher ent principle of British jurisprudence, at tached to any plaintiff, in any Court,'" and this was the knotty point on which plaintiff had been advised to seek relief' from the appellate Court at the risK of emphasising the paradox, well understood in legal circles, that very often " he who? wins loses." His Honor said he thought applicant was entitled to the rule, but he asked him before tailing it out to count the cost. Mr. Justice Cohen mentioned, the case of ex parte Carmichael, a-ndisaicf that though that was merely a dispute as to the possession of a few books the liti-. gation must have cost Â£&o; or Â£70. Counsel, having accomplished the: mis sion with which he had been entrusted,, said that he would communicate with the parties, or their attorneys, and submit to them the remarks of the Court.-S.
