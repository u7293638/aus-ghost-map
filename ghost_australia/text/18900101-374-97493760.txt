". Sydney, December 31. New South Wales. Dr. Goode, of Orange, defendant in the recent slander action, Davis v. Goode, against whom £200 damages was re turned, was on Saturday-arrested by a BharifTs officer* [for neglecting to pay the costs' of the action, amount ing V-io • over £1000. The doctor is now in . Orange .jail, _ where he has been accommodated in the jailer's private quarters but will be transferred to Bathurst immediately. Goode says the re?son why he will not pay the amount is that by so: doing he would thereby be admitting the justness of the jury's verdict, and that his conscience tells him he is right in the course of action ' he took against the hospital matron. He is determined not to pay a penny, but will remain in jail for the full term. A. good. deal of sympathy is now expressed for the doctor, even by ssme of his opponents, who never ex pected he would be puniseed in such an extreme monner. A sad case of drowning occurred on ofturday at Mr. Charles M'Phellamy's station near Forbes. A son of Mr. Qeorge Halloran, manager of the Bank of New South Wales at Batharst, was on a vihit to Waroo, and went to bathe in the liver, imt in diving struck a log beneath the water, which is supposed to have stunned him for he never rose again. The body was recovered yesterday, and has been forwarded to Bathurst for inter ment. Young Halloran was a splendid swimmer. \- We hear that a thanksgiving service is to be held in the Anglican Chnrch (St. Paul's) (XL the 15th of the present month. | Mr. Cunlifie Lister, who»e„ recent land [ purchases were mentioned last week, is sud to have made £200,000 a year out o f the Manningham Mills for a long time before'the business was converted into a company, when he received a million o f cash for half the concern, retaining the other half in his own hands. . During the last few years Mr. Cunlitfe lister has ^^en /purchasing estates in the North Biding of Yorkshire, and he now owns ;more 'than 40,000 acres In that county, for which he has paid upwards of £850,000. We have delayed writing a leader re viewing the principal incidents of the paat year and prognosticating what is going to happen, in the new one so long that our space has become filled. Nobody, however, knows what the year which opens to-day will bring forth. Most of us have a general idea of the year that is past—it opened in the; midst of aterrible drought.; it closed inone of the grandest seasons ever known in'this district. - A few more sucb afeasons, andtlie people will puBh their way along. For the goodfortnne .we are all thankful to Provi dence, and with reverence express our gratitude.

The weather continues showery, with occasional thunderstorms. Saturday last was most oppressively hot; so was Sunday, but after sundown on the latter day, the clouds came up, and before midnight a steady rain set in which gave relief from the close oppressive atmosphere. By 9 a.m. on Monday, two inches of rain bad fallen. Monday again was cloudy, but with a cool breeze, and in the afternoon a good heavy, shower felL The country in the neighbor hood of Roma is in remarkably good condi tion. Grass and water are plentiful every where. Between Roma and Cbarleyllle there are patches of country which have not; been favored with rain, and the pastures are bare. This is stated of Muckadilla, where it is Baid (the creek is dry. We hope that, so soon as the grapes are gathered, there wilj be a good downpour to give the whole of the oonntry a good soaking. If there is to be a big drought it is hoped that we shall get a fur start, and a chance to provide for it.
