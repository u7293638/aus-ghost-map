ON THE VERGE OF THE GRAVE. A FINAL EXPERIMENT AND ITS ASTOUNDING RESULTS. THE DOCTORS BEWILDERED. INTERESTING INTERVIEWS. (From the " Australian Workman.") On Thursday afternoon our representative made his way to the humble home of Mr. Thomas Jarvis, 45 Crown-lane, Ultimo. He was discovered nursing a two- year-old baby, and his face declared him to be one of the happiest men in Sydney. He was up and about, and was able to answer the knock at the door. Although pale, and bearing still the marks of a critical illness, and a period of pain, It WAS very clear that he was an invalid on the rapid road to convalescence. In reply to the preliminary questions be said "You want to know all about my case ? "Well, I am glad of an opportunity to tell you. The facts may. be of value to those who are stricken as I was." " How long were you suffering ?" " Well, twelve months ago I got so bad that I had to LEAVE OFF WORK, ' / And I have done nothing since then. About five years ago, next Christmas, I met with an accident; I was badly scalded while taking a bath in Pitt-street, Sydney. Since the accident I have been in falling health, and after four years of gradual . development of the malady, I was forced to give up my billet at the Glebe Island." " What were the symptoms ?" " Simply indescribable. The pains were something terrible. They were just about as much as I could bear. They were for all the world like as if a SAW WERE CUTTING MY BONES In two In every part of me. I had no control over my bowels or bladder, and was a nuisance to myself and everyone else. I" I was incessantly shivering and shaking, and could neither eat nor sleep. On the 23rd March last I saw a well- known doctor, and he told me that my case was utterly hopeless. However, he gave me an order to the Director of Charitable Institu- tions." " Did you make use of the order ?" " No I came home and went to bed, and have been pretty well in bed ever since. Five weeks ago I could not walk across the floor in fact, I could not get out of bed. I felt then that it was a ; ALL OVER WITH ME, and only a question of days when I would give up the ghost. My doctor was attending me, and did all he could, by opium and morphia pills, to ease the agony I was in. I was under him for five or six weeks. He came to the conclusion that I was suffering from locomotor ataxia, or progressive loco motor ataxia, a disease of the spinal cord, characterised by peculiar disturbances of gall, and difficulty in co-ordinating voluntary movements. He told me that I might last for ten years, and that I might never got the use of my legs. (Just then the patient kicked his legs about with energy to show that medical opinion is not Infallible.) " Well, just as a drowning man will grasp at a straw, I grasped at an idea conveyed by the advertisement- describing the cure effected in the case of another, boiler maker in England, which I read in the Australian Workman,' by Dr. Williams' Pink Pills for Pale People. I read In the advertisement of a case which seemed to fit my own. I determined to give the Pink Pills a trial, anyway, and I SENT FOR A BOX. of The effect was as marvellous as it was magical. I was able to eat and sleep as though nothing was the matter with me. It was the first appetite and rest I had for many a day. It was incredible. I immediately left the bed and was able to move about. I have taken four boxes of Pink Pills during the past four weeks, and am now taking the fifth box. I CAN WALK ABOUT with the aid of a stick, and am gradually but surely recovering my former vigour and vitality. You see those crutches there They are perfectly new, and I have never used them. They were made for me before I got the Pink Pills, but I was too weak to use them, and now I don't want them. All I want is this stick, and I hope soon to do without It. You see, I am rapidly re- gaining my strength." " He is 100 per cent better," said Mrs. Jarvis, who had come in and taken the baby on her knees. " The Pink Pills have SAVED HIS LIFE, and made another man of him." A friend who called in at this point said that Jarvis looked ten years younger that day than he did a fortnight previously. " I can now," continued Jarvis, " have a cold bath, and all the feeling has come back in my legs. If I keep on going the way I am, I hope to be able to work in a short time. I feel that I shall be well enough to resume work as a boilermaker, and you know I have to be in the very pink of health and strength to work at that trade. I am BETTER TO-DAY than I have been at any time during the past five years. I ascribe all the change and benefit to these Pink Pills. They have saved my life I am in no pain now whatever, and feel like a new man. On the mantelpiece there is a box of OPIUM and MORPHIA pills which the doctor gave me to deaden the excruciating pain. But they can stay where they are, for I no longer need them. Everybody who knows me has been amazed at the change in me. They can hardly believe their eyes. My being about again has caused quite a sensation out here." Having wished Mr. Jarvis continued speed towards recovery, our representative withdrew. , , . . What Mr. Labour Leader M'Gora Knows. Mr. J. S. T. M'Gowen, leader of the Labour Party in the New South Wales Assembly, was also seen in connection with the remarkable case of Thomas Jarvis. He says he has known Jarvis from infancy. He also know that he had to give up his work at Glebe Island abattoirs twelve months ago owing to a malady which he developed. He afterwards heard that Jarvis was bedridden, and that there was little chance of his recovery. He understood Jarvis was refused admission to the Sydney Hospital, as his case had been pronounced incurable. Mr. M'Gowen was, therefore, like everyone else who knew the facts, astounded at the complete recovery of Jarvis. Pink Pills for Pale People Work Wonders in a Suburban Home. INTERVIEW OF THE EX-INVALID. (From the " Australian Courier.") Hearing of a remarkable cure in the suburbs of Sydney, and being anxious to verify the report, we despatched a representative to the residence of the lady in question Mrs. Margaret Layfield, 69 Surrey street, Darlinghurst who, in response to a request for a history of her sickness and recovery, t told the following story, which is given in her own words : " up to the spring of 1891 I was always comparatively healthy, and could carry out my household duties without feeling in the slightest degree fatigued, and would enjoy a sound and restful night's sleep. Then I began to suffer from weakness, and a feeling of depression. I had a fulness and pain at the chest and round the sides ; I was also troubled with palpitation of the heart and a sense of overbearing exhaustion, lost a great deal of sleep in fact, I kept tossing about the bed all night. ' In the morning I woke unrefreshed, and looked at the day before me as one of positive torture. Frequently I had to remain in bed all day, and call in the assistance of a neighbour, being really too weak to do anything. I also had a terribly languid feeling. Having inherited a good constitution, and being always averse to calling in a medical man, I endeavoured to battle through my troubles, trusting that a certain amount of determination would assist me to throw off this terrible nausea Exhausted nature, however, at last gave way, and I was on the eve of sending for a doctor, when a friend drew my attention to a remarkable cure of dyspepsia and nervous debility effected by Dr. Williams' Pink Pills for Pale People. I got some of the pills as an experiment, and at once proceeded to take them in accordance with the printed instructions. After a few days, and before I had completed the first box, I felt a visible improvement, my appetite returned, and once more food agreed with me. I continued taking the pills, and am now happy to relate that I seem as well and strong as ever, and have suffered no more from that terrible indigestion. I feel deeply grateful that chance threw in my way Dr. Williams' Pink Pills, as I tell everyone in fact, I should consider myself a heartless' woman if I did not make this matter public and endeavour to alleviate the troubles of my suffering sisters. " I now feel happy and contented, being restored to health, and can fully appreciate those beautiful lines of the poet Thomson, ' Health is the vital principle of bliss.' " Dr. Williams' Pink Pills for Pale People are not a patent medicine, but are a thoroughly scientific preparation, the result of years of careful study on the part of an eminent Edinburgh University physician. FEMALE WEAKNESS CURED. Mrs. J. H. McMillan, South Finch, One, says : " For seven years I was afflicted with what is generally termed female weakness, and was at times for weeks unable to leave my bed. My friends all thought that I was going into a decline and had consumption. My complexion was sallow, my appetite was almost gone, and I was terribly emaciated ; my head gave me great trouble, and at times the pain was so great that I feared it would affect my reason. I had tried many medicines without avail, and began to despair of recovery, when I was urged to try Dr. Williams' Pink Pills. The result has been marvellous. From a sickly, despairing woman I have been transformed into one full of health and energy, and I feel more thankful than I can say for the wonders Pink Pills have done for me."
