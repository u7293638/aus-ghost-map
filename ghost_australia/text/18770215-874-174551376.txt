THE EASTERN QUESTION. WHAT is it haunts me in my sleep, And makes me from my slumber leap, And tear my hair and howl and weep ?— The Eastern Question. What is it, when I walk the street, Comes like a ghost in winding sheet, And bursts from every friend I meet ?— The Eastern Question. What is it, when I eat my food, Its horrid image will obtrude, And leave me prostrate and subdued ?— The Eastern Question. What is it, when I kiss my kid, Blinks at me with its ghostly lid. And never from my thought is hid ?— The Eastern Question. What is it that, whate'er I do, Falls on me like a clammy dew, And dimB the earth with spectral hue ?— The Eastern Question. What is it that has made me sad ? What is it that has made me bad ? What is it that will drive me mad ?— The Eastern Question. Oh ! thou great power, almighty Press, In mercy make my troubles less, And all about that curse suppress— The Eastern Question.
