SERMON TO THE YOUNG. The Sermon to the Young, as directed by Conference, was pjceached .in life saipe, church, on Sjjn$l£y eVemag; by the,, Rey,. G. B. Richards, President .of Horton. College. •• The rev. gentleman took forhis text Deut. xixft, 47;—?! For it is not; a v^in fchjnjj tor you; bfecaijse.iit is'your life." His introductory remarks Vftference to the last days, of Moses, whose, life had been an earnest and noble one •throughout; identified as it was with the highest .interests of .that great people, thechosen people of God. Tiiey found him" reviewing .the .paths through which the •people , had been led) -and pronouncing liis f^nal and mature judgment while tak- ! ing a solemn leave of Israel. But more,, than that, the words were the words of inspiration,. the woods . of God himself. " it," the service, of God, religion, .piety,, " is not a vain thing, for. yon i becailse .it. is your life.". - The subject then was "theimportance of true piety." The highest blessedness • of the ^present life was not * separate from the life of the world to come., " Godliness. is.profitable unto all things having .promise of J;he life that now-, is, and of that which is to come." He • (the preacher), would endeavor to impress^, upon his young friends the claims of true ; piety, that Which ioncferned equally.the present, and the ffituj-e. The text.su'g r, geste^ that there were .evils of vast jnag-. nitude threatening the life of body andsoulj from which .we; could only, be pre-' ; served by the infiuence of true piety.- In this connection, there Mwas siu, ,and also the consequences of sin, the destruction of all true life, and all that is worthy of life. , Tliere was, perhaps no sin in .the present (lay so, prevalent, and ^o jlestruc-, tive -.as the sin..of Interqperance : .-it a,ifected, all classes,.,<sind;was the causp iof , mor;e crime ,and pwery thananypjie thing belles. He warned. the youpg people ftgaiij^.t the use of intpxicating; flrink.,: Go(l forbid tliat ihe shoulfl say what pome ,. that it.was sip..for a mail to glag^^if T^ine,,pr th'at stimulants h^d not ilieir,proper use,,,., if he w<srp to. ^oj. he should say what he jtb,» be irue, , ,Bflt .when, he .Ronsid?^ ^a., terriblyxesulty m yrhat folloff^dsuch use,,; he -wais justified,..,"in urging', on..all to avoid the sin. As a mat- ' ter - -of prudence'- -.and : • Christian expedi^acy ho lirged them to abstain from it except' in Abases iof.'absolute necessity. The same language ftiight be used in reference to 'drunk«ntiess as lli another case —"consider diligently" what is before thee, and put a knife to thy throat if thou be a man given* to appetite." -In God's name ho warned -those who indulged in the use of intoxicating drinks, the young especially," if there were any present who had acquired the habit, that theyi were; on the precipice of 'ruin: , " Who hath;woe ? who hath sorro w ? who liatli contentions ? who hath babbling? who hath wounds without, cause,? , . who i• hath', redness of eyes ?. They, that tarry riong :at the wine; they.; that: go to iseek mixed wine.- Look not thou 1 upon 'the wine when it is red, when it giVeth liis colour in the cup, wheia it anovetli itself aright.. -At the. la^jt it bateth .like a. ser^ pent andLstingethlike. an adder.",: . It waa possible ; for those young meri now to put away :: .the ; i evil. thing. 1 Another 'Sin- h«r Would refer to, naihely, that ,wliich. was pervadingvall classes, oL the ^community, and^which':was oertainlyi destructive of aelf-TeSpecti peace,-and> comfort, and led to misery and-Tuin. - ? He' spoke -of that* foolish, 'picked.,craving for Iat^e (igiul3s'.' which,.led'' men ito.' despise; honest' com n merce—to, risk' all -.-.they : possessed dfor, the chance of enormous gain. He besought them not- to make- their great concern here-below to amass wealth. . Maiiy*;a man.who resolved to be. iich by. anyineans bade .farewell to^- honesty, and integriity^ In making! these '.remarks • the • preacher observed that he xvas -not speaking again Bt diligence in, business, or imjiroving^^jy'' lawful means. the gifts of .God's pfp^i-"; deuce. HeaUude^ to a^ sacjiand (receiit case; in "Vict9ria-,of ;a m^n, ,whowas flthp. typov ,of a ,very ,large; class .ruined.' and disgraced by - eschewing 'the paths; of ,honesty,;jind .courting : .the gambler's 1 fate., In;.the-'^prds^Of .that individual " It's the.ol^ st'ory^ t^tinginpney ^to make, a good venture with the ' intention,, by-, and-bye.to restore it." . Mr Richards said it waa quite possiblelie was : speaking to - some one who had gone beyond " his ^ means, and he would- speak. words of caution to such. ; Then he should ;like to ; say a word on another matter, .on which' it was-difficult to .speak, and hardly .possible-to speak without giving- oftence ; it cduld. hardly be spoken of even in an' age of open'licentiousness. Various causes were producing their results in offences against virtue and decency, ^proving tljat. therfS :^as no ,vi6e' ^tis ,.s^n-.' suil^pi., ,He:mig)ii spea,k,.o| Jpther jpriip^' of |sih,,but ii^-would be>cpnJtent with ;re- •jninding] them that Dot only in . those 'senses were these and other sins death-, worldn^', but there" Were '' trfilter 1 conse- ' quenfces than thbBO to which' he' had re- ferred;' which-Were- irifinite and eternal^ reducing' men to that' which became second death, '' Where tlieir wPrm dieth' not, iand the, fire is not' quenclied.Wife it theii needful that man borato'love arid serve God should eigerience. tlie^ final ; ex-^ tlnction pf hajpipiness ?

After\Soiiie' r remark^ oji ,th'e question of pterri^l 1 rewards arid punishments; the preacher said the congregation jnust., «ee • thej propriety of the utterance of. the text that " It is no raiij thing.

No doubt -in speaking to the . young on that oocasipii; he was speaking to some ,of high aepifations^ who , desire^ • and intended to. live to some high, "noble> and worthy purpose';- they ,wished so -.to'-' Jive as to leave their, .footprints [on eayth : after they shall have 'gotie; Bfejice.:,, Had; they sii(^i aspiratw^^ T^^heb^oijglit." them to , yield themselves.. to Go^r .'and-i deny.themselves in early life.
