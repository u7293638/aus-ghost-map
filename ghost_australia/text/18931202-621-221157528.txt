A Letter From Uncle Ben. AUNT CONNIE'S PARTY. My dear nieces and nephews.— It is a long time since I wrote a letter to you all, and now I have quite a budget of interesting news. There have been so many new cousins anxious to make themselves known to you through first letters that I did not like to disappoint tbem by putting off the publica tion of their little notes; and for that among _ther reasons, I have not told you before of _he enjoyable party your Aunt Connie gave _ome time ago. Your cousin, Cora Anderson had come to stay a week with us, and as Aunt Connie's birthday had come round, she determined to give a children's party. As we live a few miles out of Melbourne, it was no good sending invitations to those of you who live at a distance, but all those who live within a few miles of our home were invited, though two— Eva and Ruby Stoddart — were unable to come because they were ill with the measles. Well, first we had great fun play ing at "Find the Treasure" and "Thought Reading." Then we had tea, and afterwards played at "Musical Chairs," "Railway Stations," "The Stage Coach" and other games, but the favorite of all was "How the Ghost walks !" It was wonder ful : not even the youngest in the party was a wee bit frightened of the Ghost, who walked so funnily that everyone else fell down laughing. Altogether the party was a great success.
