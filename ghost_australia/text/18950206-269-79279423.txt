The advent; of /Hie- cold weather has, as usual, profoundly modified the habits of the thooamds ot homeless and penniless n»rmtW« who swarm in the capital as in all large ffrfoy Bohemians of various kinds, piwfea&^J beggars, workmen without Employment, are no longer to be eeea dozing away Hif hours - on tfae benches in-the public gardens and squares, as on the daye when the rays of the sun have some warmth in them. All these people have now taken op their winter quarters. MuseumB, churches, and libraries are besieged, Wherever warmth is to be had for nothing, there are to be found crowds of famished wretches. In the museums one sees them gaping stolidly at the pictures near the stoves. But for the watchful eye of the attendants, they would sleep away the lifelong day. Whenever thcp heads nod, however, an authoritative tap on the shoul der warm ih?m that they must leave their shelter and seek the cold streets once more. In the churches also, the beadles keep a sharp look-out on shabby woKhippers, who spend too long a time kfteeling in front of the side chapels. The libraries are pertaps the favourite hauntB. The instant Hie cold appears, moat of the dients attkbeted by these depositaries have some other object than - that of poring over yellow pages, or deciphering hieroglyphics. Has alio, however, when the pseudo-readers so for forget themselves as to give vent to a gentle snoie they are promptly reminded Hud; they ture not in a dormitory. Caught napping aseeond time, they axe inexorably turned out, their place being at once taken by one of the lengthy line always filling up the etainxase in the winter. The money voted by the Municipal Council for bed and soup tickets, though a large sum, does not go for, when spread over the innumerable applicants. A6TBOHG WOXAV. It is thus no wonder that among so many unfortunates, the papers tell us every day of numerous burglaries in and around the capital. But if there were many ladies as bold and as strong as the widow Salasse, there would, no doubt, be a considerable decrease in the ranks of bmgtars. Shortly after retiring to real the other night, she heard a noise as of footsteps in the next room. The clock was just strik ing one. but she unhesitatingly went to see what was the matter, and discov ered a young follow engaged in forcing open » CHpboard. Finding himself surprised, he brandished a crowbar over his head, threaten ing to kill Mme. Falasse if she called for assistance. She calmly said this was the last thing she thought of doing, and advanced upon the intruder. After a short struggle she threw him to the ground, and as he tried to bite her, squeezed his neclc so tightly iha* he lost consciousness. Only then did she summon the police, but the man was in such a deplorable state that he had to be carried to the hospital inBterd of the police station. POLITICS. \- The debate in the Chamber of Beptstaes on the Budget of 1895, has been conducted with remarkable vigoi\r and spirit. The most important speech on the Bide of the Moderate . Republicans was that of the dis tinguished financier M. Leon Say. and the news of the Socialists and were dearly set forth by ML. J^ures.M. Cavagnac, tod tf~ Peletan. As for the Minister of finance, he took up a trimming attitude between Moderates and Badical Socialists, and Ms speech was that of . Minister of In the Roubaix affair, the Ministry had given a sop to the Moderates, and & was now- neceesaty, accord ing to the Minister, to giro something to Hie Radical Socialists, in the hope of propitiating them end rendering them politically amiable -jit Leon Say complained ofthe entrance ofj ^ ravQtessive pnnin^ into the Ministerial fag M augmentationi of the death Mm, which, lie ?i^caated two dmn of cituent-one to whom privi leges were granted, andHw othertreated as pariahs, ana, as such, fit subject* for Minis tettl solution. He w«t»n*»iiwif <w. door, qpewd by Hie Violator to the c'octrines of WBfantian, would never be dpMd but would be continually m wider until, the present fiscal destewyed. In answer to Hie polihViJ trimmers assertion, tluu there was wisdom in avoiding * iiattie with Socialism, iw contended that the effect waa the same, as loog as the fortress eitfftndered, aud it made very little difference whether ft was tataaa by awsailaata, or qaietly delivered np to the enemy. Above all he showed, <*«* the* surrender of the Minister of Finance WW & return to the policy of Republican Concertration, as the Minister would have Hie support of the Radicals and Socialist* pine a certain portion of the Moderate Re publicans. The present majority thus sacri tied, coold not be reconstructed, md the Ministry would henceforth be at the mercy of the Radicals and Socialists, and ft wonld not be long before they conspired to torn it out of office. The Minister's speech in reply, divested °f its elaborate rhetorical was totheeffect, that it was necessary to | the wind out of the Radical Socialists by what was after all a trifling concession, and that the open door could be shut quite as easOyaaitwas opened. The speeches of M. Jaures, M. Cavagnac, and M. Pelefcaa defending Radical Socialist views fn»n diff erent points of Hie compass, but they failed to show what benefit the proletariat would derive from despoiling Hie rich. As in the fitst French Revolution, Hie spoils of Hie confiscation wonld fall not into Hie °f H*e proletarians, hut into those of clever and unscrupulous adventurers. King Humbert's speech recently delivered .t the opening of the Italian Parliament, waa evidently so framed as to give little Mom for Parliamentary controversy. Ring Humbert has virtually permitted his Prime Minister, Signor Crispi, to assume Hie powers of a dictator , in order to carry oat the financial measures that are necessary for the country's welfare and which cannot be accomplished by parliamentary discuss ion. Signor Crispi has henceforth a free hand, and he can cut down expenditure without being hampered by electoral con siderations and bureaucratic exigencies galy in like most European btates, spends tar too much money, and a real-not a Bham-retrenchment is iter sole salvation. To this need of retrenchment eveiyfching must be sacrificed, and this | nor Crispi and King Humbert perfeu.. comprehend. Birithar Franee nor Uermaoj ie particularly delighted at the prospect of 8iguor Gnspi's success; the first, &ea; Italy, free faun debt, would be mueh stroll Hian she is at present; and the because an Italy, engaged in cutting down " - is not an efficient member of the The Temps the other evening published a ybwwiiHijr s article on Hie relations of nngiMid, Russia, and Eruee.
