THE BALLARAT GHOST- The ghostly doings at the Victoria Unity Company says the Courier, have drawn crowds of men, women, and children to the claim every night this week, about the time when churchyards yawn and graves give up their dead. All were animated by a desire to see a ghost, but were doomed to disappoint- ment, for the ghost did not walk. Some of the watchers were armed with missiles for presentation to the embodied spirit, and one enthusiastic ghost hunter, with more gush than sense, had provided himself with a firearm for the purpose of resting the perturbed spirit. Last night there was a crowd, as usual, at the claim, and the shot gun was banged off with great ceremonial, but the ghost, which is variously estimated to be like different things, and from 13 to 31 feet high, and so forth, did not perambulate, The scare, however, having become so thorough among some people, and dreading, the danger of thoughtless youths executing reprehensible practical jokes under cover of the ghostly visitation, the "only original ghost" desires the wholesecret exploded, and the mystery dissipated. He desires to state that he is in, and hopes long to be of, the flesh ; that he intended, when starting the fun, to let some men see how easily gulled they were ; and, that he does not intend to do it again, so that any fresh manifestation - will : be the work of an unauthorised ghost, and an unwarrantable liberty, His only art was that of disguising his voice, and his only assistant was that peculiar twist in some men's minds which makes them look for the supernatural in any circumstance they cannot immediately understand. He works at the mine, and when the credulous of his mates are about, by an alteration of the tones of his voice, and slinging a stone now and then against a building, or anything that will make a sound, does the ghost trick. This thing has been going on for years, but latterly has greatly exercised the minds of the superstitions in the neighborhood, with the result that an amusing joke, unless a stop is put to the way in which some people have taken it up, will deepen into a troublesome affair.
