Smith came up for another dose and got it so quickly and hot that before tho round was completed the towel wus elevated on his behulf. There arc very few lads, in Sydney at least, approaching Griffo's weight who have the ghost of a show with him. President Fulda, of tho California Athletic Club, was slightly wounded, and Junius N. Ferguson, a director in the club, seriously wounded nt San Francisco on February 8 by tho accidental discharge of d shot-gun which a man named Frank Renfree was handling.
