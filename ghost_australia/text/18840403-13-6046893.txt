WELCOME TO BISHOP BARRY. The now Primate of Australia, Dr Barry, Bishop of Sydney, who arrived in Melbourne from England on Monday last, was welcomed last night by a special service held at Christ Church, South Yarra Notwithstanding the very inclement weather the church was crowded to excess, and many who were not ticket holders were unable to obtain admittance. There were no special decorations in the church except on the chancel screen, the pillars and arches of which were vy wreathed with green leaves The attendance of the clergy was very large, numbering in all about 50, including Bishop Moorhouse, of Melbourne, Bishop Thornton, of Ballarat, Bishop Parry, of Perth, the Very Rev H B Macartney, Dean of Melbourne, and the Rev Dr Bromby The sir v vice was conducted by the Key IT V Tucker who was assisted by Rev D I' Powell Archdeacon Street is read the first lesson the 15th chapter of Joshua, and the second lesson -I Corinthians, 5th chapter was read by Archdeacon M Cullagh The special films were the 118th and BOth " Onward, Chris the Soldiers was sang as the processional lights, and the recession in Spain was No 274 J There was a full attendance of the choir, and Mr Stevens presided at the r gun Dr Byiiitv, who based his sermon on Romans in 13, ' We, being many, are one body in Christ, and every one members one of another, said that thought can more naturally occur to the mind of anyone who has just traversed almost the whole breadth of the earth, and everywhere was found centres of English power and influence every where has joined in the dear, familiar worship of our own English Church Many, indeed, and far separated outwardly, are the members, but in the near secret of the higher life they are one body still M hat thought, again, can more naturally meet on the Australian shore one called by God's will to a post which necessitates duty and so much kindly affection not for one only of our churches and colonies but for ally large and various are the developments of out 1 English life and our old 3 English Christianity on the area of this vast continent yet there is an underlying unity which telling lies all the -ctitteicdlnenibersmonebodj mChrislinnit) But w Ittle I naturally follow the suggestion of those personal associations, unit I not also believe that the great subject of the text is one that dominates the thoughts and aspirations of this present age everywhere and that it comes with willie special emphasis to the community in which our lot by God's providence as east Everywhere I seem to see the problems which concern each society as a whole coming to a head, and calling imperiously for solution, arrive in the church and in the state. The time of pure individualism-neccssai} perhaps in its day for the extension of commerce and enterprise of coLonibntton and material progress is passing or past In all phases of human experience men are called to study and to realise the conditions under which each society maybe not in name but in reality one body throbbing with one common life through the whole method of its organisation Anti, so far as one still a Stranger can read the signs of the times here in respect both of civil and lch-iunsltfe it seems plain that the most pressing need felt everywhere IB the need of country which

ecclesiastical and religious life and our own church at least has anticipated that colonial union, for which in things civil the first ten tative approach is being made less for these wide lessons even more than for all) narrower and more personal associations I feel that I cannot speak to you my brethren to night for the last time, on any subject more appropriate) than on the old familiar words of the text 'He, being many, are one body in Christ, and every one members of one another Observe I pray you, two leading principles filling this enunciation by St Paul of the great law of unity The first is shown by its following close on that exhortation which the apostle makes the link between the dog trial and practical teaching of this (it it epistle-the exhorts teaching" of this great epistle-the exhortation of self sacrifice to Co 1- ' I beseech you therefore brethren by the mercies of God that you present your bodies a living sacrifice holy acceptable unto God the principle of

know the second commandment of the love of self sacrifice i for men rises but no degree above the love of sell and only under the shadow of thogteutcr | eoiiiinundment can it have its right vitality and scope ^ es at the root of this law of a unity as of all others lies the one fundamental truth of truths-the relation of the soul to God, which is Himself love and the | exhortation based not on His almighty power or all perfect wisdom but on this | infinite mercy to present ' ourselves souls and bodies as a living sacrifice to Him ISiituiiillj in that most solemn of all bonds of unity before the truly lable ot Our 1 old endeavour bristles absolute self devo- tion to God which fills our hearts and I ours out the homage of our lips ' And the other leading principle in St Pauls declaration lies in the words in Christ We being many are one body in I Christ It is a historical commonplace to remark that, as a matter of fact it was Christianity which first realised in the past | the brotherly Â£1 of man as something more than a philosophical speculation or an iib struction of law Not less, I believe will the | historian of the future have torccoidthat in spite of the grand (hearns of brotherhood which claim to be the new gospels now let so far as men are, al is I but imperfectly one ] body now, they are one body in Christ How we may ask can it be otherwise ' the Gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ gives to the former exhortation a practical reading by revealing the One God our Father in Heaven claim ing and caring for our love and by His J mercy in atonement and grace breaking down that terrible barrier of sm wine' i else would mine both the opening and the acceptance of that sacrifice is possible But it does more than the It is in the true sense at once a religion of 6 x1 and a religion of humanity It shows nan humanity working (together with Garthcu 1 for the salvation of the world it shows as the Son of God true Son of fun-making that humanity to Himself and soliciting all souls directly to them indirectly to each other, it sets forth in His perfect example the harmony of HEIR sacrifice to God and to man, and so it teaches us how to preserve our own true individual nature and yet realise a brotherhood of all the human race AS love is the old command ment from the beginning yet new in the I Lord Jesus Christ and in those who are not, so the unity of that which 13 the grt and of love is made known to us is made possible to us, in him by the words 'in Our at the dream of unity becomes a solid reality, fruitful 111 results of infinite blessing Only

L- 1< it I am warm- nCI..! so lies break But here we speak as Christians. Here we look on humanity as that which Clod made in His own image, and for which Christ died IIPIC tile in which we recognise is the communion of saints-the bit of direct unity through Christ was God by the indwelling of the Holy Spirit 1 There is but one love absolutely universal, and yet intensely personal It is the love of God in Christ in both senses-the love which He bears to us, the reflex love which we bear to Him In the inspiring power of that love ' it in that we acknowledge as a truth that we are " the body in Christ, and by a thousand works of practical so rapidly and beneficence show that we are every one members one of another the truth itself lies I believe the widest application in this its Christian sense for no one can feel the New Testament without secure, that the revelation of God in Jesus Christ touches the whole of human kind nay (so St Paul in the Epistle to the Ephesians seems to indicate), basan even larger reference to all created being "Cod we read, loved the world, our lord "yields life for the world, the Holy) Spirit witnessed even in the work I of bin and n"httou-iioss and judgment In His atonement and His grace Clubs is set forth as the saviour of all men, though specially of those that believe Humanity even in itself, in spite of all its blunders and its sin is let to a Christian a sacred tiling In it a Chris train is above all the s bound to acKnowledge that we are one body of hope is, therefore a unity which we Christians as Christ any should cherish even on the basis of this our common humanity. Whatever tends to the right growth and development of human nature, enriching it by the subordination to it of all the wealth of fore and beauty of the material universe, enlightening it by intellectual progress in discovery of the great truths of nature and man and God, softening it by the culture of imagination in the deeper sense and higher creation of beauty, exalting it by the mond progress which alone di serves the name of an ill station, because it alone binds men together as twin citizens of the common- wealth of mankind in the golden bonds of duty and love, subduing it to reverence by devotion of spirit, soul, and body to the supreme law ruling humanity, and to the service of the supreme righteous- ness whatever, I say, thus subserves the great purpose of God's creation the salvation of humanity, as we Christians understand it, we are bound to support by sympathy and help as a fellow working with God And all who labour in this great cause, even if unhappily they devote themselves resume of its lower elements, as it they overcall in all even if they hold not to the supreme faith of God in Christ, which alone we can acknowledge as having also a dunn on the allegiance of the soul we may recognise as having at least home bond of unity, in virtue of which they are one body, and everyone members one of another" bare I am that we shall never lightly understand the sovereignty of our Master, and shall never lightly enter into His spirit, unless we claim for His service all that improves and elevates humanity, and acknowledge the lower forms of such service as being like His own miracles of bodily healing and beneficence But if there be a bond of common humanity, how much better and closer is the bond of a common Christianity ' What in- a finite difference between the vague service unconscious or half unconsciously she is know n God, and the clear, v iv id, personal allegiance to a living God, having of all ages conversant with main, revealed as acts only one with man in the Lord Jesus Christ. In comparison with that great unhappy gulf of separation, all others within Christianity itself sink to insignificance. We look with shame and sorrow on the divisions, sometimes passing from separation to antagonism, which break up the body of Christendom, and which at least, as much as any other cause, in the victorious progress of Our Lord's kiiigdoinngninstthc deadweight of apathy and ignorance and the positive hostility of sm and unbelief Nor would I desire for one moment to gloss over the reality, even to ei terminate the import of the principles, which historically have been the causes, sometimes real, sometimes ostensible, of then religions divisions But after all, is it not true that on the great articles of the Chins tion Creed-the belief in the Father, the bon- and the Holy Ghost the great body of Christendom is practically at one' Is it not true that it is on the application of these Divine heartiest the individual soul, and the great corporate body which we call the church, that we are at issue with one another' and that even here we find unity of which before we little dreamt in the great causes of struggle against infidelity and sm, und in those heart-searching horns which test the legality of Chris- tum faith through building, or peace tion, or death ' Surely there ought to be, on the basis of a common Christianity, a closer and diviner sense of unity, which, if it cannot yet heard the branches of external unity, still should keep us from "biting and devouring each other, and from playing by such antagonism into the hands of the world and the flesh and the devil, still, in great questions of Christian morality or of Bible teaching to the masses of our people, should rally together as one man all those who rest on the Holy Scriptures as the word of Jesus Christ, still, even if we have from time to time to utter protest against error, even to rebuke those who touch it, should lead us to throw our whole hearts into obedience to the apostolic direction, " Count him not as an enemy, but esteem him as a brother's shall we feel, when (tenth brings us face to face

out, Arotheie Christians here and there rose up the triumph song of the multitudes which no man could number, who has washed their robes in the blood of Jesus Christ, and had Ills name, and His name

rest not only in the open Bible, for which perhaps more than any other Christian ho by our church has ensured the full and systematic study of all her member-, but also in the common worship is handed down by living continuity from the centuries of the past, in which we have joined to night and which has been for ages a standard alike of devotion of practice and of love to me, which it is almost impossible to estimate and in the ancient apostolic government and industry itself comedown to us with the prescription of centuries which when we reformed we refused to abolish SOO years URO Suffer me to remind you that we more than any other body in English Christianity are charged to witness for this truth of truths, let we claim to represent with a claim which I knowing be questioned but which will vindicate itself historically-that ancient church in which once nil 3 nthsh Christianity was united and for which-I will inquire now by whose fault secessions have diverged from the right hand to the left There witness we must bear to those without whether men will hear or forearms against the recognition of a mass of conflicting sects as the true ideal of Christianity. the witness we

respects as in others God grant us 1 English churchmen more and more to realise the truth that we are the body and members one of another It is a great subject of which I know my brethren that I have been able to lay before you but slight. in peru pt Sketch I commend it earnestly to your thoughts But I commend it still more earnestly to yOUr prayers for surely it is in common prayer especially in prayer of mutual intercession that we find our best and truest unity. When St. Paul had exhausted all the wealth of his teaching, he fell back at last on " Finally, brethren, pray for us." And if we see in the New Testa- ment for the deepest conception of unity then, after the study of its direct teaching, we cows ultimately to the great prayer of Divine intercession, "As Thou, Father, art in Me, and I in Thee that they also may be one in us." Therefore, before we part to-night let us pray for each other, and for the whole body of the Church of Christ, If there is a grandnnityihtheburstof one strain from many voices, there is unity even more solemn in the multitudinous silence of secret prayer, which ends every service in the Church in that silence, to night, let us pray, us for all other blessings so for this, that we mu j ponder in thought the great truth, the body of Christ, and that we may show in action the fruits of that thought, and prove me a thousand works of love that we are every one members erect another
