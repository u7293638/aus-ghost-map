EDUCATION. No. 4. [communicated ] *' Going therefore teach ye all nations baptising, them in ths name of the Father and of the Son an^ of the Holy Ghost, teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you ; and be hold I am with you all days even to the consum mation of the world.'' Matt xxriii. 19. In the present article, we purpose reflecting upon the position which the Church, jure divino, holds with resard to education. We have already pretty freely discussed/ the question as to the great importance of giving a thoroughly religious education to the ycung, that they may be prepared to go forth into the world, armed as well against the errors of Heresy and infidelity as against the innumerable dangers' to which the pious Christian must everywhere be exposed, and no where more than in a colony such as the one in which we dwell, where indeed the Almighty Creator hath been profusely boun tiful in bestowing every blessing that man can desire but yet where nevertheless, the temptations to vice and the allurements to sin are perhaps greater than in any other quarter of the globe. In a word, we must bear in mind that this conflict with sin and vice is inevitable, that it cannot be avoided,, and that unto him alone who is ' faithful unto death' will be awarded a ' crown of life.'' Now keeping this- in view what can be of greater moment than early preparing our, children for this ceaseless struggle, which i8 to end only with life, by conferring upon them such an education, such a thoroughly practical religious training as alone can en able them to withstand the constant dangers that must perpetually beset them. Let us now endeavour to review, with all submission to ecclesiastical authority, the position which the church, by right, holds in respect to education. And first the church is the solely appointed channel, the only lawfully constituted means whereby the correct knowledge of divine truths can be conveyed to mankind. The church has existed for more than 1800 years, and her mission from first to last, from the first day of her appointment to the present hour has been; to lead mankind, and to direct bis course through the stormy and turbulent, struggles of this his earthly existence, until guided and supported by her divine aid, be at length arrives at the everlasting mansions' of external joy and never-ending felicity*. Such always has and always will be her holy mission .; this' august mission was con ferred upon the Church by her divine founder when he authoritatively commissioned her to ' teach all nations,' and promised that the full effulgence of the Eternal Spirit of Truth should perpetually reside with her to teach her all truth, and to preserve her to the end of time free from error or the least* semblance thereto. -The' church then alone has the right of instructing mankind, no other body save herself has that right, and hence is she truly and lawfully entitled to the control of all education not only1 religious but also secular, because all education has some reference either directly 6r!indirectly to reli gion* directly when it has an immediate and close'connection with Christianity; indirectly when subservient to religion, it is employed in strengthening the mind and invigorating the 'mental powers. Thus the study of clas sical lore or mathematical science may have no direct r Jerence to religious training,* but indirectly, according to the hands in which iB placed the province of instructing in these Bttbjects, will they have great reference thereto.'in cultivating the mind and preparing end forming the, reason. The mind of, man admits of much, cultivation, it resembles a field which will yield a crop plentiful 61 meagre according to the pains bestowed upon it, just, bo the human intellect will bear iruit in precise proportion to the care which is taken in its culture and the mode in which, that culture is imparted : there fore it is that the Church has ever been on guard, is always on the watch,, and is con tinually insisting, that during the whole time this mental training is in progress, snch a mode of imparting knowledge alone shall be adopted as ?shall in every case, and in connection with every study place the Faith in such a position, on such a lofty pinnacle as may render it clear to the view, and may cause the mind continually to be returning to itj during the whole course ot educational developetnent. Our Lord Jesus' Christ having redeemed us from bin .and blotted out the handwriting that was against us, knowing that the time drew nigh, tliat he should withdraw his visible presence from this earth, and re turn to his eternal Father, established his Church, or in .other words a new dispensa tion a spirituarkingdom, full of power and might, and constautly replenished with supernatural grace, this kingdom was to supersede the old Jewish one, all the types and shadows which that contained, were to pass away and merge in the unearthly glory of this bis new dominion : the members of this universal kingdom or Church are all those without any distinction who have been lawfully united thereunto by baptism ; even those who are wanderiDg in the bye paths of heresy and schism she claims as her cbildreh, rebellious it may be, but still hers, so they have received the holy sacra ment of Baptism duly administered. In this Church our Lord has established a distinct body of chief rulers or bishop-, and in that body one, the Sovereign Pontiff, the Successor ot St. Peter, the head of the Universal Church, to whom he hath given primacy over the whole earth, and the right of ruling and governing the Universal Church; to this body of bishops united and ; obedient to the Successor of the Prince of the Apostles, has our Lord confided the preservation of the Faith — to this body is entrusted the propa gation of the Gospel, and the instructing of all men in all things necessary to salvation — tothis body belongs the 'right of defining ' what' is revealed truth and what is contrary thereto,, of deducing inferences from directly revealed doctrine, and of condemning doc trines at variance with- those inferences — to thtm it appertains to decide whut is s'oUmi and what is unsound in morels, and to pro nounce an authoritative judgment on air systems of educations, as to whether tht y art in accordance with the principles of faith 01 morals, or in opposition to them : in fine, it is by divine appointment, the holy ano exalted mission ot the Bishops of she Church not only to announce to all mankind thi everlasting Gospel of Christ, and to pieao) the eternal truths of salvation to evetv creature, but also to watch over and insptc the morals, religious conduct and training o her children, to advise, to admonish, t« chide, to threaten, and finally if needful, tt denounce — in short in all things acting in accordance with the commands 01*81. Paul, ' Them that sin reprove before all — B- instant in season and out of season ; reprove, entreat, rebuke in all patience and doctrin. ; \--These things speak and exhort, add re jbuke with all authority.' Such then being the -divine authority and mission of th« Church, it follows, that she has an absolute control over the education of her children, and consequently it is, we insist, the bounder, duty of ail sincere Catholics to aid and support the ecclesiastical authorities in this most important matter in every way in their power consistently with their position as I laymen. Let then every assistance be given to the Clergy in their endeavours to promote and advance, a legitimate and adequate system of education— namely a system based on religion, and taking the everlasting words of our holy faith as the foundation upon which all other learning, how extensive soever it may be, must be built.
