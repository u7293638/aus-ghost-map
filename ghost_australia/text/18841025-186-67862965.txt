We found the sexton just opening the doors, and he let us go round with him while lie lighted up, aud then I proposed that we should stand outside anil watch the people come.

The procession was evidently waiting for us, and as fast aa I coold, I sqaeezed a way through the crowd to take my place in front of the bride. She fcmiitw* wheu she caught eight of me, and put out her hand. Then just as I took it every light in the church went out, and I knew Claude had succeeded, in I'fc pip' of turning off the gas. *' Don't be frightened.

' Well, she didn't scream nor Bay she was going to faint, but just held on to my hand tight, and let me lead her out in the dark. We found Claude on the sidewalk, holding tbe door of the carriage open ! and ordering the coachman (who looked as if he thought we were eloping with the bride) to drive to the drug store. We all three got in, and were off before the people in the church had a chance to tViinV of anything else but the darkness into which they had so suddenly been plunged. 'But— but did the electric fluid put out the lights in church ?' asked Miss Lord, after we bod explained to her alwut Tom's shock. 'Ob, no; 1 turned off tbe gas,' said Claude, promptlv.
