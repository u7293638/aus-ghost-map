ÂZAMAT BÂTUK'S DIARY M AMERICA. NEW YORK, APRIL 10. If I was compelled to acknowledge that the women of this city are in face, dress, and general appearance second to probably no women of any other country, tho same cannot be said of New York men. Their distinctive characteristics seem to be smart- ness and politeness ; but tlmre aro but few among them that one could call handsome in the sense in which that word is understood when used avith reference to Italians or Englishmen-the two nations celebrated for the characteristic and handsome features of their men. The excitement of business and the use of strong drinks must in the long run have acted very unfavourably on the constitution of the male population of this city. Almost all the mon are ¿£_n and pale, and if they did not pay so >mucii attteîltion to their "turnout," and had not always their chins so cleanly shaved and their hair so carefully "fixed," I !>-_,. lieve the great majority of them wonj^ joae every vestige of the youthful frf"-Junesa tüey seem still to rossess.

And, assuming that business transactions will some day lose the feverish character they have now, and that strong stimulants will be loss indulged in, the breed is sure to improve, the food, soil, and climate of this country containing apparently all the elements required to pro- duce the strongest and handsomest men. A closer insight into modern English life would also be most beneficial to New York men, both in respect to habits of exeicise, which are so much neglected here, and in the manner of dreBBing, for which English gentle- men, excepting a few old-fashioned eccen- trics, who still cling to the custom of fitting themselves out like parrots, certainly bear the .palm in Europe. The New York swells would then learn that what they consider tobo "showy" and "stylish" is simply as common as these very wouls are. In olden times, when there was in America a considerable excess of men o\ er women, the women commanded au almost unhmttel amount of civihty and attention Courtesy to women became thus a habit, took root throughout the country, was transmitted from generation to generation, and to day the politeness shown by men to women is perfectly striking -low ever oiercrowded may be a horse car, bo\\\e\er tired may be its male passengers returning from a hard day s work, the moment a woman enters, whether she be young or old, ugly or handsome whether she be dressed in silk or -ommon homespun-several men are sure to rise to oifer her a seat Impressing once my ad- miration at this courtesy of American man- ners to an eldeily tentleiuau of a rather practical turn of mind, I was answered, "Yes, it is so, and I wtah our men were not so - polite, for the companies would then bo obliged to run more cars than they do now There is nothing like women to kick up rows, and if they had been frequently left standing, wo would have a car war just as we are ha\ ing a whisky war, and wo would havo beenbettei accommodated " Then, again, Btarmg at women in the streets or following them, as is practised almost all thiough Europe, seems to be un. known here, or at all events tobo done in so discreet a manner as not to be easily notice- able. The same could certainly not be said of Pans, London Berlin, or any of the great European centres, and I am not quite sure that some of the ladies do not find the thing a little oo-crdone here If I havo eyer re- gretted of not being a lady it is since my . armai in New York There is no advantage that the fair se. does not take hero of the masculine branch of humanity A man goes to the theatre, for instance, and is never astonished to find his seat occupied by a nice little lady, or to be asked to lea\e it because some charming specimen of woman- kind is desirous of taking it The consi- deration that tho man piid additional money foi his seat and that the lady didn't, is ne-yei taken into consideration The external polish of manneis having thus by long practice been impirted to almost all classes except the \ery lowest, it became also extended to the intercourse between men almost as much as between men and women Spain is peihaps tho only country where men are as polite towards each other as they aro in New -ork You seo hero nothing of tho stiffness and mistrust of the English, or the silly cercmoniousness pre vailing among the majority of the Trench and Italians, or of the vulgai servility of the Germans But what is reilly ama/ing is the facility they possess for remembering names The moment you aro introduced toa man he takes hold of j oui name, however foreign and unpronounceable it may be, never forgets it, and seldom disfigures it Tho comical mess which the French mako of English names, or the Eng lish of any foreign name, scarcely over occurs hei o lins must bo attributed to the same cause which makes Americans speak foreign languages, when they do speak thom, so remarkably well Tho constant roivturo of -various nationalities m this land and the frequent intercourse with all sorts of not v, ery intelligible foreigners seem to havo broken in tho tongues of tho Amen cans But as a possession of a good weapon does not necessarily imply the skilful use of it so does it seem to be with the supenority of the American tongues, for so far as con versation goes I must avow I do not know of anything poorer than what I find hore All that seems to interest people boro aro monoy and the Go\ eminent the latter topic being alwajs dealt with in very Btrong language, and much moro with reference to tho indi- viduals in oflice than to principles or Bystems Sometimes when a party tots inebriated, they will begin to talk about the great ness of tho Amoncan people-a topic always pleasant to listen to for a chango, especially as tho utterances on such occasions are alwajs strongly flavoured with very fino swearing at overjbody else in the world But cony creation, cmiserte, as it is under, stood among tho Latin race, as the ¡juniUh liehe Plawle» ts of tho Gormans seoms to bo utterly unknown hero The dullest English club going is far moro lively aud moro pleasant to listen to than anything you can get out of ey en your most intellectual fuonds Art, music, literattuo seem to be cultivated somewhere outsido this city, though oveiy body buj s books and pictures and pays high prices for opera tickets On my inquiring how this apparently \ery low atato of intel lectual life was to bo accounted for I was nivaiiablj told that Now York waa chioily a business city, and that if I wanted to form an idea of American culture I had to go to BoBton, tho palladium of American intel- ligence Somo day I will undoubtedly do so but at present I am BtiU trying to find whether thero is not m this etty at least somo cornor where somothmg beyond money matters, murders swindles, and Govornmont officials is discussed Tho levelling of all mon boro before the dollar and the law is somothmg roally amazing Thoy protend to havo an ansto cracy, but superiority of brains, of blood, as understood in Europo, has nothing to do with it Tho families thoy acknowledge to ho tho best families-the " kniekorbockors" as they aro callod hore-aio simply thoso which havo accumulated tho most dollars and most soldom brokon the law. As a con. sequence of such a manner of vievving things you sometimes see a Judge Smith keeping a drinking saloon on the out skirts of Central pork and a General Mitchell managing an hotel (the Brunswick, ino of the best and most fashionable by the way) Tvery occupation is looked uron as a respectable one as long as it turns out the bright dollar and if jou ever attempted to sieak of anjlhin_ concerning superior blood or finei intellect j ou would be imme diately îebul ed with a plain sentence of It should be shown then bj making it pay Dn 1 nig habits are cultivated here on an alarmingly laige scale But there is a re deeming feature to them I don t know how they manage it but keeping in MOW the fabulous amount of liquoi absorl>ed theie is a remarl ablj sm ill amount of disgusting in toxication exhibited in public places and in the streets And what is still more pleasant to notice is that neithei women noi children are in any way connected with drinks that lew women drink at all anything beyond water none are engaged in selling drinks the classical British barmaid being unknown here and the revolting sight of little chil dren going to the next corner pubhebouse to fetch beer or gin for their alieady d-unken parents and lapping with their tongues the fioth of poiBonous hquoi at an age when they ought not to have tasted anything be yond their mother s milk is here never to be seen _xEVi YORK AIRIL 19 When Mr Joseph Arch the president of tho Labourers Union was last fall (as they call autumn here) in America he visited the landing department at Castle garden and wrote a complimentary letter to tho board of commissioners of emigration upon " the most admirable manner in which the whole system is carried on." Whether he gave an account of this institution on his return to England I am unable to tell but had he done so and made the English labourers acquainted with what the legislation of the United States has provided for every man coming here in search of work they would soon have perceived that there was no occa sion for Mr Arch to lose his time in travel ling speech making letter writing and gene ral leadership He would have only to raise tho passage money for the men, if he possibly could do so, and leave every one of them go by himself, for with the support offered the immigrants on this side of the ocean their chance of getting a living is in- comparably greater than it could ever have been at home. Strange as the thing may seem the eminently anti-socialistic Yankees have organised at Castle-garden and on Ward's Island everything that the most ardent socialists could have dreamed of, had the arrangement of affairs in this country been handed over to the ghosts of Robert Owen, Saint Simon and Fourier. The poorest and most ignorant men of every country come here, pay about one dollar and half each, and are cared for provided with lodging and food, attended in sickness, sup plied with work, and forwarded into the interior if they desire And all this is done if not by the state as understood in Europe at all events by what must seem to the emigrants to be a governmental body of officers The stories I heard in England concerning the treatment of emigrants in this country, and the ideas which we have in Europe concern ing the wretched corruption prevailing in all public institutions of the United States, caused me to look with great suspicion both at Castle-garden and Ward 's Island But having visited both places having talked to the inmates and inquired into the manage ment of the business I am compelled to acknowledge that I have never and nowhere seen any establishment approaching these two institutions in usefulness efficiency, and humanity of treatment of those for whom they are intended The explanation of the fact is simple enough Besides the work of the New York commissioners of emigration being unique in its very nature (for there is no place in the world where emigrants flock in such numbers) it has the advantage of having nothing to do with charity Where charity comes into play there is sure to be either humbug or cruelty, most frequently both. A man is saved from starvation upon the condition of his undergoing no end of humiliation, a uselessly stringent discipline, and frequently renouncing everything he lived for or believed in. He must therefore either deceive his soi disant benefactors or submit to greater—because more prolonged— sufferings than death could ever have in flicted on him, while in the present case there is nothing of the kind. Outcasts of every nation come here in search of what Europe has refused them They have no money no knowledge of any kind, and are in tho great majority of cases very stupid. To assist them is as much in the interest of the new country as it is in theirs to be assisted. Left to themselves they would be in a few days after landing reduced to utter destitution, and fall a burden upon tho nation Until 1817 immigration was just as free and uncontrolled here as emigration is in Europe The immigrants were left at the mercy of the "runners," the boarding- house keeper and the captains some of the latter actually selling into bondago tho miserable fellows they brought over on speculation To that year, however, and thanks chiefly to the efforts of Mr Thurlow Weed and Mr Andrew Carrigan, a law was passed for the protection of immigrants and since that time about five and a half millions of men women and children of foreign birth have been protected from ex tortions, supported when sick, provided with employment, and assisted in every possible way, down to the finding out of their friends and relations, forwarding their letters, and writing them when they proved unable to do so themselves—and all that was done without either tho fedeial or the state Government disbursing one dollor i he ships carrying tlie emigrants wero charged two dollars and a half (about 10s ) 1 ead money on their land ing and in this waj the funds necessary for the maintenanco of this admnable nistitu tion weie supplied The navigation com 1 ames included of course this tax in tho 1 assage rates and thus the emigrants aro all members of a vast association for their own support m the new country Since 1870 the amount of head monoy was reducod to ono dollar and p half consequent on the largo Bitrplus which tho board had in its coffeis but the navigation companies did not on that account reduce the passage rates and as the board got into debt after that reduction tho question of returning to tho "idol is already befoio the I "gislature Tho avorago jearly expenditure of the boaid can bo taken in lough figures at half a million dolíais At all cvont8 thore were last jeal 207 -13 mum giants landed fromvanous countuea at the port of New \ ork and paid 101 01 idol and tho boaid was by tho 1st of the ptosont month over lOOOOOdol m debt And as consequent on tho gold panic and tho genoial falling ol of business thero has boon a decrease of about CO per cent m tho influx of emigi ants for tho first quarter of the pre sent year tho mcomo of the hoard must do crease and its debts increase still moro Tho machinery of the board in Castle garden or landing depaitmont is all on closed within a largo rotunda orectod on the spot of tho foimerly celebrated battery llio department has scvoial bureaus each with separate funct'uns The board ing bureau foi instance has to board and inspect all incoming vessels with reforenco to tho number of immigrants then health tho number of births and deaths during the voyage &,c Soveral olh cers of tho boaid

purpose, to assist the new corners during the examination of their baggage by the custom house officials, and to have it properly checked and forwarded to the Ro- tunda Trom the moment the baggage of the immigrant is placed on the barge, the authorities of Castle gorden take entire charge of it, including insurance, and the further forwarding of it to any place named hy the proprietors Thoso who have suffered the extortions of the portera and _'riera, and know how they are all over tho world inclined to disappear with the luggage en trusted to them, will easily realise the benefit which the immigrants, frequently ignorant of the language of the country, derive from this sort of assistance on the part of the landing bureau After having been landed and liberated from all encumbrance, the immigrants are ushered into the Rotunda, passing in single file before the chief clerk of the bureau and a medical oflicer, whose duty it is to ascer- tain if any person aiUtcted with infectious diseases had escaped the quarantine inspoc lion After this they pass to varioua desks, Avhere their age, sex, nationality, trade, desti- nation, Le , are recorded, there bei-ig special cleiks speaking every language under the sun In fact when I first visited the estab- lishment, the aspect of the Rotunda and the indescribable hubbub of all imaginable tongues and dialects caused roe to helieAe myself within the tower of Babel The registration being gone through, an officer ascends a lostrum and calls out the names of those for whom letters or remit- tances have been recen ed or for who LU friends are Avaitmg in the information bureau Tor those who A\ish to communicate with absent friends there are clerks leady to write and forward their letters, and a telegraph com- municating with every point on the globe is in the building Those who wish to proceed into the interior aTe provided with tickets at the lowest possible rates, and themselves as well as their luggage conveyed to the railway station or the steamboat free of charge ThoBe Avho deBtre to leitiaiu in the city pro- ceed to boarding houses specially licensed by the major and kept under the supervision of the board Such of the new cometa ao have no means to go to the boarding house, yet want some rest before proceeding further, aie permitted to remain m the llotunda, where they can purchase plain but good food at very low prices If any of them wish to change foreign monies for United States' currency, there is an exchange office giving the hithest rate of the day If any be sick there is a temporary hospital Avitlnn the enclosure, Avhile graver cases are sent to the Aanous infirmaries on Ward's Island rinally, persons who are not sick and are able to Avork, but find themselves in desti- tute condition, are boarded and lodged m the Rotunda, or on Wards Island, until work can be found for them 'ibis is done through the labour bureau, where all appli- cants for employment aro classified accord mg to their occupations, age, sex, references, A-c , and where all those desirous of engaging servants and workmen are required to give satisfactory recommendations During last jeal o\er 25,000 emigrants both male and female, obtained employment through the instrumentality of this bureau , and all this is done in a quiet, polite, and attentive manner, Avhich a first class passenger seldom meets from the officials at whose mercy he is left But hero does not end the acttvitj of | the hoard The immigrant l8 considered as such for the first live years of his resi- dence in the United States, and during the whole of that period he is at liberty to fall back upon the boaid whenever he be comes sick or unible to obtain occupation After that time he is considered a naturalised citizen, and has to apply for relief to the chanties of the state he resides in The navigation companies are prohibited to bung over cripples and pereons over 60 years of age, unless such as ha-v e friends to take care of them Now and then an individual of such description w ill slip through the hands of the inspectois of landing, and tho com pames are immediately bound in öOOdols for eAerj one of such persons to keep them for five j ears, unlesB they consent to go back to then countrj-, which they seldom do, know- ing from then friends' reports the comfort- able life they can have here if they persist in remaining The Irish, the Germans, and the Swiss seem to be particularly well informed con- cerning the nature of the establishments connected with the board, and pregnant women, for instance, are constantly sent here for confinement by their foreseeing husbands and paramours The hoard never asks any questions as to the legitimacy of the forthcoming child, and a woman of any European country can come here for delivery almost as a matter of course, and the care taken both of her and her baby is equal to the best Ijingm hospitals of the old world As to old peopl» cripples and lunatics, they can never be got rid of if they once succeeded m passing the desk of the inspecting clerk a-id medí cal officer, for the law does not allow of their being sent back by force In some cases oven, the municmal govern ments of Germany and Svvit/etland tried to tako advantage of tho authorities of Cnstlo gaiden, the formel bj sending out the most troublesome of their prostitutes and some of their petty criminals, the latter their paupers, tnd the board had some conespondence on this subject with the consuls ot those couti tries But in the vast number of immigrants }early reaching this port it is utteilj impos Bible to lind out all c ises of imposition so the board justly piefers harbouring a few undeserving persons to refusing the assis tnnce which every immigrant has purchased w hen paj ing hiB passage nionoj In this way the refuges nurseneB, barracks and various infirmaries on Wards Island get moicand more crowded In my next I will ¡,ivo a description of these establishments, con- cluding at picBent with a few rough data concerning the (low of emigration According to the official report of the Board of I migration, tho total number of omi grants landed at this port in 187 ! was from Liverpool and Queenstown, llo" 170 , from Glasgow and Londonderry, 21291 , from I ondon and Ilavre, 10 042 from Bremen and Hamburg d') (id-), and from other ports about 20,000 The comparatively high figuro of emigrants lea\ing fiora Liver- pool is easily accounted for by the fact that people of all countries em birk there, reaching the great port by special ai rangement with the continental agerts of tile gieat steamship companies 'towards the to'al of this number England supplied 32')JO mci, women, and children, Scotland, 8 .520, and Ireland, b'1,745 Ot tho remainder, the greatei portion were Germans, and among the lot vveio one man from Asia, nine from Africa, and five from Australia
