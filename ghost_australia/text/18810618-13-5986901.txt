I CURRENT LITERATURE, Mr Edward Stirling, who has been for ninny 3cara nell known to the public aa tha elnge manager of Drury lane, ima published lia 50 >ears recollections as author, actor, nid manager, under the title of OH Drury Lane (Chatio nnd Wmdus) Like all actor a biognpliiea, theao two volumes are brimful of entertainment The author baa a memory well stored with the traditions of the stace mid Ina own experiences as an actor though ho -eier reached to any eminence in the profession, will be found extreméis interesting He writes in a terse, pointed Et}le, almost too pregnant with matter, and tells a »tors well So full of good things 11 deed is his book, and so closely packed, that it is hard to detach any quotable passages Here is a story of how a gentle man from Dublin expounded tableaux from the antique to a Liverpool audience -' First .tableau- Ajax defying the lightning , music first Group-Lxponent 'A Jack defjmg of the lightning Second Group -' Hercules killing the Nemean lion Lxponent ' Herclaas killing a name lesa lion ' (Considerable merriment in front, accompanied with my anger at the wing, telling the exponent to come off Not he ') Third Group-' Cams Alarma sitting among the ruins of Carthage ' This w as in terpreted, ' Caus Morimes sitting on - referring to the hat- I can t make out what he sat upon, bedad ' House in a roar, down came the curtain, away ran the exponent, I after him Of Macready, who waa distill guished for his imperious manner and vile temper there are several laughable anecdotes Once plas ing m "Lear in tae provinces, the propertj man being told in writing to provide a map for tbe opening scene, where Lear dmdes his kingdom, had read it mop ' At night the tragedy commences, Macready, in full state on the throne, calls for his map, a ' super noble, kneeling, presents the aged king a white curly mop The astounded actor rushed oft the stage, dragging the unfortunate nobleman and his mop with him, actors and audience wild with delight On another occasion, on his return from America, he was pinsing namlet at the Princess s, Cooper benif, Ghost Macreadj was very particular about his dead fathers dress, al wa} s furnish ing it himBelf ' In the scene where Hamlet follows his sire to the ramparts of Elsinore Castle, at the moment when the spirit pro- claims himself Hamlet a buried father, Cooper started and rubbed his neck, proceeding, ' 1 hy falber s spirit, doomed for a certain time to \- ¡(Another jerk of his ghostly bead ) (Aside)- \\\ bat the devil is it' Macreads groaning with rage), ' Go on, Sir 'I can t, 1 m ate up alive bj something,' wriggling and tw isting his body Audience laughing Tra gedian -' Get off, Sir Cooper -' Where s the trap' (to lead to sulphurous flamea), feeling with his foot for it, descends, rubbing his back ' O, remember me Macready, in a towering passion, rushed to the green room when the act drop fell, demanding an explanation ot John for bia strange con- duct 'Ask the cockroaches in sour in fernal armour ' It was discovered on search to bo swarming with cockroaches, never having been unpacked until that night since it was used in America An Irish playbill of tho Theatre Rojal, Kilkenny, is quoted, which announces that on a certain date ' will be performed, bj desire and commind of several respectable people in this learned matrnpohah, ' The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark,' originally written and com po°ed by the celebrated Dan Hajes, of Limerick, and inaatted in Shakspearo s works Hamlet, it is announced, " will, between the acta piaj several solos on the patent bagpipea, which play two tune3 at the same time Ophelia "will intro duce. several favourite airs in character, as ' The Lass of Ktchmoud Hill Le The pirts of the King and Queen, by directions ot the Iie\ Tather O Callaghan will be omitted, as too immoral for any stage ' " The cha ractcrs to be dressed in Roman Bhapes and I the value of the tickets, as usual, will be taken out if required, m candles, bacon, soap, ' butter cheese, potatoes, Lo , as Mr Kearnes wishes in ever} particular to accommodate the public N B -No smoking allowed, or swearing No person whatsoever will bo ad mitted into the boxes without shoes or stock- ing" Some of the pla} bills which Mr Stir ling prints at large are cnrioaities in another kind, as showing how infinitely superior was the cast, even m ordinary pieces, in those palms das b of 40 or 50 years ago than now, when a single star constitutes a company, with a bundle of sticks In the caat of ' London Assurance at Covent garden in 1811, there ia not one name which is not famous among thoae of William Farren, Janus Anderson, Charles Mathews, Harley, r Matthews, Keeley, Meadows, W H Pas ne, Mrs Nesbitt, Madame Vestria, and Mrs Keeley 'What modern playbill can match this array or talent ' As a complete record of the atage of Old Drury, Mr Stirling s book will be invaluable to future historians of the English drama Mr Samuel Butler, the author of Uncon scions Mernot y (David Bogue) a work which is labelled like a sonata, "Op 5, ia a gentleman of an ingenious and original humour, as all who have read his "Op 1 Liuchon are aware, believes he has a ¡,ne\nnce against Mr Darwin, and that he has discovered a new theory of life The grievance and the theory are mixed up in a moat bewildering manner, so that it is very hard to tho non scientific reader to under stand what ib the drift of Mr Butler s pre Bent publication Mr Butler, indeed, has not the (,ift of expoaition Having given much studs to his little book, winch is not without amusement and instruction in its way, we are ab'e to malte out that Mr Darwin is accused of having, in a translation of Dr Krauae's article on hiB grandfather, Erasmus Darwin referred in Borne manner unflattering to Mr Butler s book Evolution, Old and New, thoae unflattering references not having been in the original, though they appear in a transía tion The offence, even as thus explained, does not appear a very heinous one, nor scarcely to warrant the heatedj language which Mr Butler permitB himself to employ The essence of tho charge which Mr Butler has to make against Mr Darwin is that the author of The Origin of Species was more indebted to his grandfather, Erasmua Dim in, to Button, and to Lamarck, who preceded him m the examination of the theory of evolution, than he has cared to acknowledfee Whether this be true or not, all the world-at least the set entifii world-have been long able to judge, and with tho facts which are open to all, it docB not appear that the world is inclined to follow Mr Butler m dens ing to Mr Dartvm bia claim to be considered the true founder of evolution There ia another matter of difference between Mr Butler and Mr Dar- win, which is not personal but scientific, though it is confused with Mr Butler s other differences and his themes in a singular fashion The evolutionists of the Darwinian school hold that species were engendered out of fortuitous ,van. otions of tho individuals, while Mr Butler, who claims Buffon aa the true d13 covcrer of the principle, maintains that variations were engendered by a " sense of need ' To take the familiar instance of the giraffe, the Darwinians proper hold that the long neck was produced, because the short necks were not able to reach their food bo easily as those abnormally or ac cidentally tiffed with necks a few inches longer Gradually the rarities with the longer neckB wore perpetuated, while their rivals perished, and bo in procesa of time the necks got longer and longer, till they became what they aro now. Mr Butler s theory is that the giraffe got his long neck because continually urged by a "sense of need ' to Btrctchit The battle, he maintains, is "of greaterimportancethanappearsatürstaight ' j The qnestion is whether organB are " purpo I sive' or " non purposive." To us it appears j that it is a question rather of metaphysics I han of phyaice To the prolific pens of Mc8"b Henani and Rice weare indebted for three volumes under the title of The Ten Yeara' Tenant, and other stones (Chatto and Windas) The first stoty, which gives the name to the series, is the shortest, but perhaps the best, though on a theme which bas been worn some- what threadbare The idea is of a man who has had imparted to him the secret of the elixir of life, who is 250 )ears old at the opening of the Btors, and has buried some eight or ten wives The inconveniences attendant on perpetual south, or rather perpetual manhood, are humorously described, though in the end thuy become a little wearisome The best scene is that where the hero, who ia overa hundred years old, but has been compelled to disguise him self as a very old man to avoid awkvvaid in quines on the part of the neighbours, in dulges in a fit of antics in b13 own room, believing himself to bo alone " I con tamed m5 self no longer, but, locking the door, I threw my wig up to the ceiling, my crutches on the floor, and I began to dance, the jolly old ale in my heels Oaf It was a relief Tor many days I had been bo carefully watched that there had been no chance of exercise The quiet house, in which the only noise was tho ticking of the cuckoo clock, the aged lady who aat opposite to me all day long, bowed and bent, meditating on the past and future-for to the old there is no present-the old servanta, the old dogs, the old furniture, amid which our married life of 75 sears bad been spent-all these things fell upon m) apinta like lead So that,warmed bs the strongale.behevingmyself free from observation, I shook off all dis- guise, and danced with the agility of a man in his twenties A loud shriek interrupted me I had made a mistake m the room, the beer being in my head, inBtead of my own bedroom I was in our common sittingroom My poor old wife stood before me, pointing with her shrivelled finger, gasping for terror and amazement Ihen her head turned, and she fell headlong to the ground The shock and affright were too much for her, and she never spoke again How he manages to get away and to realise his property, and how he continues to lead other live3 in different parts of the world, make up the rest of the story One half of the three volumes is occupied by Over the Sea with the Sailoi, MesBrs Besant and Rice s last and not most successful of Christmas tales, which appeared only a few weekB ago in .4// i/i» Yeal Round. Mr J B Gough, the temperance lecturer, 13 probably more at home on the platform than in print, yet bia Sunlight and Shadow (Hodder and Stoughton) ia not without en tertamment Written without any evident plan or method, and curiously discursive and disjointed, disfigured with some ghastly wood cuts by American artists, the book is one of the most extraordinary which ever presented itself for review. Its main purpose 13, of courBe, to preach up the doctrine of total I abstinence, and this is done in season and out of season, the subject being introduced with singular ingenuity apropos of almost every topic in which Mr Gough has to discourse, and Mr Gough's topics have an amazing variety, from the ways of London cabmen to the personal appearance of Mr Spurgeon, and the revenues of Sir Wilfred Lawson Mr Gough boa a great lund of anecdote, of which he makes artful use in enlivening, if not enforcing, bia one constant tneme, and though many of bis stones are old, others, gathered from the byewaja of Evangelicalism aud temperance platforms, are as refreshing as ¿oedone, and pleaaanter than that most seductive of imitative vanities Thecoloured preachers Bermon on the ' two texts-Glad Tidings and Hallelujah, ' is full of genuine nigger character, though too long for e\t-act " Some of the negro preaching, observes Mr Gough quaintly, " has a ridiculous side ' The preachers are given to use extravagant phraBes, which are cunouals mispronounced and misplaced, aa he who aaid, when some one threw a brick at him when preaching " Dat man w hat frowed dat brick ia guilty of an act of moral turpentine " Sketches of Army Life in Russia, by Lieu- tenant Greene, USA (Allen and Co.), is full of information on many points connected with the militars organisation of Russia, of which country and her policy Lieutenant Greene is an enthusiastic admirer. Having been on the Russian staff during the late war in Turkey, our author had ample opportuni- ties of judging of the quality of the army and its deeds. Unfortunately, the value of his testimony is a good deal impaired by the strength of his prejudices. Lieutenant Greene, while an ardent sympathiser with Pan- slavism, is a bitter hater of England and of the English Government, and never loses an opportunity of venting his spleen against our country. The hero of his idolatry is Skobeleff, whom he ranks as one of "the five great soldiers of this century," the others being Napoleon, Wellington, Grant, and Moltke. Lieutenant Greene's book will delight all the friends of Russia in England, while it will teach Russians themselves much that they did not know, not only of the valour of their soldiers and the skill of their generals, but of the purity, the earnestness, and the unselfish- ness of the Panslavist party. Siberia in Europe, by Henry Seebohm (John Murray), is a daintily printed and illustrated account of a journey made by two English- men to the north east of Russia and the valley of the river Petchora, in search of rare birds and birds' eggs. It is a book chiefly of intirest to ornithologists, though written in a pleasant, simple atjle, of which the enthueiaam ib very attractive Mr. Seebohm s greatest triumph waa the diacovery of three out of the Bix kinds of birds eggB, which till his viBit were unknown to naturalista The neating of the grey plover, the little atint, and Bewicke a Bwan had been always among the mssteneB of science It was suspected that these birdB bred somewhere in the north- eastward of Russia, but it waa reserved for Mr Seebohm to dis over the exact localities and. to únd the egg3. Three problems yet remain unsolved, and await thf future explorer, for ornithological science knows nothing of the nidation of the knot, the curlew sand piper, and the sanderlmg. Mr Seebohm's triumph ib that he has reduced the number of these problems from six to three Ptcluus /> om h eland, bs Terence M'Grath (C Ii egan Paul and Co ), ia a collection of sketches which have appeared m a London evening paper, representing the most promi- nent tjpes of Irish society, from the "Irish Landlord of the Old School" to the"Gour been Man," or village usurer, They are capitally drawn, with much spirit and colour, though from a point of view which ia not exactly that of the Irish Land League. At the present time, when so much of the public interest is occupied by the Irish question, this little book will be of considerable help in enabling outsiders to understand the leading elementa of the Irish character. Terence M'Grath writes obviously with intimate knowledge of the country and the people, and with abun- dant humour and picturesqueness. Publications Received -The Pontt of Sound, by Edmund Gurney (Smith, Elder, and Co ), is an elaborate treatise on the general elements of musical structure, and the nature, sources, and varieties of musical effect, of which only an expert is able to estimate the value A Manual of Zoology, for the ubo of students, by Henry Alleyne Nichol son, sixth edition (W.
