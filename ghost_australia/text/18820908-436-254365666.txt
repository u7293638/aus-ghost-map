BODY-SNATCHING. A mysterious affair (says an Amcricau paper) occurred at Syracuse, in the United States, the other day. Dr. Hcrvey Kendall, a well-known physician of that city, was found early in tbc morning of the 18th of May lying in a meadow adjacent to the burial-ground of the poor-house with a bullet hole in the centre of his forehead. Near his body were lying two shovels and a satchel. Under his lelt leg was a revolver, all six chambeis of which had been recently tired off. He was still alive when discovered, and was taken to the County Building, when, on divesting him ot his outer wraps, a belt with two pistol-holsters was found buckled round his waist. One of the holsters was empty, but the other contained a revolver fully charged, with the exception of one cartridge. In the satchel was fouud a full kit of tools us&d; by resurrectionistsâ€”consisting of a darklautern, a cart-hook, a brace and bit, a keyhole saw, a bowie knife, a piece of rope, and a bottle of whisky. He died on the following day, but although at times conscious before his death, made no revelation of the mystery. There is no doubt, however, that when he met his death he was preparing to rob a grave in the cemetery ; for on the previous evening Dr. Kurtz, of Syracuse, called on him, and was surprised to find him in a rough suit of clothes, and all his bodysnatching implements piled ready for use. In explanation, he informed Dr. Kurtz that he was going that night to Get what he playfully termed a " bod." Dr. Kendall had long becu known as a professional grave-robber. Several cemeteries have repeatedly been despoiled by him. He was in the habit of taking large doses of morphine. Some persons suppose that under the influence of that drug he destroyed himself on seeing, or imaginiug that he saw, a ghost. Others hold the theory that he was shot by an organised baud of avengers.
