'THE OUP -MATCHES. (BY UPxa?,) . . N?swoAsTLr Fras ELEVeN v. FIsar: ELavxN IRONtlADs, fourth day, Jannuary 20th.-The "not outs," brothers Webb, continued their innings, Tracey and Gilbert being entrusted with the ball. Ciautiou was the order of the day, both batsmnen playing tho' game, and occasionally adding to the total. The bowling, however, was too good to take unwarrantable liberties with, or malkeo runs quifokly from; G. We'b, who showed excellent form, was the first to eucoumb, Tracey bowling him wilth a beauty. The loss of this cleover batsnman's wickot was the cause of a jubilantb aisplay of satisfac. tion on the part of his opponents. Webb made 25. M'Glinchey foillowed, and ap peared anxious, and rather nervous, played altogether too much forward, and only made 8 when he was magnificently cauglht; by Robinson in the slips, a grand catcih, for whioh Robinson doserves great credit. E. Webb was now joined by .Freeomnu, and both men put on a few runs, and things commsnoced to be livelier, until Freeman foella'victim to Traeoy for 5 runs. E. Webb shapod grandly, and next had the com panionumhlip of Allan, but that playor placed his legs where they had no right to be, and as a consequence was given out log before, for ndl, the votoeranu being credited withl tihe wicket. Ryder made 6, and should have .booen caught by Wood at tho.commononemnenl, of his scoro. Chapmani, who by no nmeans played badly, assisted Webb to increase the numbors, and placed a oreditable ) to his namo. I Boag helped by getting 5, andi Morley mnade the same number, inoludilng/ on of the cloanost and grandest hits (olf Tracoy) over soon, and for whichs he was loudly cheeredi on any other ground I wouldhave been ecored for it t Tracoy, not liking sucah freedom to be taken, nearly. bovdlodBonjjainn the nexoit ball E. Wohbb was at last run our he performed a re markably steady and good innings, n'everd once givfg the "ghost of a chance," re talne his poasiton 'frm the oomienceimenpt and made 23. Bewey was the last and the not-out man-nil. Rodgers, who, I am sorry to say, has left the district (for he is a good man) did not bat, consequently the 'Clads performed with ten men. Of the playing, it must be acknowledged that the fielding of the Newcastld Club, with one exception, wasof a high order; but theirgre.t success is mainly attributablo to the superb bowling of the veteran (Tracoy). I must be careful and not offendi for I am told what I intended in my last'notes purely as a great compliment, and which everyone understanding the matter would pronounce as such, has been taken umbrage at. Tracy should have- sense enough to know that I do not think him a' " dog," and that *I would not intentionally hurt. the feelings. even of the animal named. 'Th': quotation I applied was intended for a comdpliment, is familiar almost to every child, and I am truly sorry it was not understood and re ceived in the same spirit id which it was written. Tracey bowled with judgment, varied his pace, twist, and pitch to meet the style's of the different batsmen, and the field worked well up to him; he iarked very little, but Hit most effectively. The Ironclads, contrary to general expectatioi, made only 87. 't was '.thought by good judges. their total would have been con siderably greater as the true and fast wicket, and splendid day was greatly in favour of tall scoring.' The Newecistle Club won by 144 runes. • - . NEWCASTLE COr.Dl.-Firos itlnings. C.

And now a word or two on a matter of extremo importanee, and ono thl?'t is likely, if not at once checked, to eventually do great injury to the cause of the noble graie. I allude to the unorioketlike, 'and uncalled for ro, wks occasionally made by bil:suXon reospealug umpirus, when given oht by those gentlemen. This fault.finding with decisions, and in some cases uncom plimentary terms indulged in, towatrds the Jdges oef the play, has been carried out rthler freely duiring the present season; trulyit is a state of affairs to be deplored, aild it gives menmuich pain toh be 'compelled to allude to it. 'Without doubt it must be hirtful to the feelings of any man ofhonor to hIear remlarks passed as, "I was notout," "I never touched the ball," "I saw the fieldemain catch it on the hop," and such like expressions. .This, no doubt, in many eases is done to satisfy, it m'ay be the pre judices of onlookers, when feelings tending it one direction ate glad to grasp at any excuse' for' theirf avourite losingShi wicket, even to the oxbot~t ofe lbo i?umliro's hdonest bding called into question. Batsmon (and mort especially young onec) just emerging iato nttoriety should be glad to receive .advice from older and more able heads, and niusb be taueght to loolk with respoeob to the gentlemen who.gvoe.their time, and stand 'fur days, in mnany onsoe, under a baking sun, to contrihbute towards tho. eroiketors, acd publio's amusement.': Orlolceters would bo.better thought of,'and much more re-. sipocted by every nright-thliinling man, if they bowed to theli decidions of umi ire. instad of endeavouring to malke behive they Wiare not out, Who, I ask, ..would an unprejudiced publio credit ? The player, whoso whole interest is to stay as long as possible at the wiokets, ind who imay,wlieu' going in to bat have bad an idea he could stay there all day, and by fluky and bad ply au ldonly finds himself hIer do oomcX.atX is disappointed and ohagrined at his failnre, and wishIes to throwrthe bile',i 'on soineone, or the umpire, whose judgmeant, positiou to see, honesty, of purposo .and. desire to harve the game carried out fairly, enaitles his awards to respect and belief. 'There can be but one answer such to a Xqul.y, and that against the batsman. It. may be argued that umpireos should take no notice of whlat is said in the oheat of the momoet and having done tieir duty should trest with contempt the remarks of batsernn and others. True', this is ithe right way of dealing with the imatter fromt one point of view, and itis the one nom carried out by Uyseolf, who, being somewhlatof a veteran at the bInsiness am usod,to hear players, in the Xmost most unblushing manner, de. chulao they 'were disposed of.in erior, when there could not be the shadow of a doubt that they woer, out beyond all rod, mption, "I mnX in a position whore I mu dlemsand:dl of conscience o epeak thbs truth, the truth I therefore speak, imnpugn it whoso list,' and care for no nllss, UXt oll umpXilros are not constitutodl alilke, and some are' extremely stnsitivo. No true man in pleased at heaur ing unkind and auntrathful remarks re. speoting ilh actions, when standing in . position of trnot, and the sooner isle un. whtolsoleo course of conduct is stayoe the better X conduct that is unbcomssing in any m'an styling hinseolf a orloketor,. Where the evil will end, if encouragemnent is given, it is impossible to conceive ! if perslited in, we may expect that no gentlemaun,.. how. ever strong his love for oriaket, will be found oeoupying the unthankful post of umpire a then we may have ong up amongst our juvenile population who in 'numbers visit the orlcbe.t grounds ,and (fropn whom "our'ftut?'e 'rcrloeer&i;' mub come) a growing belief that umpires are, ano a rule, dishonest, as taight from examples set them by their elders, and are to be looked upnn as men to whom, po respect, kindly feeling, thanks, or consideration are due. I write purely in the interests of the game, and trust my remarks may be pro ductive of much good in checking in its infancy a growing evil, and prove bene ficIl to one of the grandest pastimes ever introduced for showing skill, aind providing innocent recreation for the assesoa. It grieves me to say that a gentleman of undoubted integrity and a reai admirer of the sport has been compelled t{ resign his position as onrie of the umpires specially selected for the' Cip matches. 'I did.all in my power to prevent him talkinmr this ex treme course, but so-hurt did',he fiel at the unkind remarlks he avers woer tendeied him, that he resolved to wash, his hands clean of the lbusiuess. Two other gentle mene, I am reliably informed, hav . also expressed their determination to clear out. if again subjected to the insinuiations.an'l fanul.-flnding indulged in towards thom at the du'tset of the Cup contests. :All this is very sad indeed. I have purposely ab stained from mentioning names, in the hope that those who feel' they have erred will endeavour to .do better in the future. "Whoever the cap fits let thewearer takb the lesson to heart and profitbyits read ing. Those who have not transgressed can lay this flattering unction to their souls, "let the galled jade wince; our withers are unwrung." Bu1 I promise, shouild a con tinuation of this business be indulged in, no maltter who the delinquent.may be, I will lay bare the offender's name to public gaze, for I am determined to stamp out, if poe sible, this monstrous thing, being fully corn vinced if allowed to be persisted. in;' cricket, in our city and disrict, must of necessity suffer ' .
