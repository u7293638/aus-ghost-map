The health of Mr W, H. Anderson, the sheriff, is not, we regret to learn, improving, and his condition last night was such as to cause alarm. At about 11 o’clock last night a fire broke out in a small shed at the rear of Mr R. Bradford’s furniture warehouse in Scurt street. Both bri gades were quickly on the spot, and the fire was prevented from spreading to the surround ing building. The shed, which contained a quantity of flock and other material, was de stroyed. The buildings belong to Mr Gibbings, and are insured; and Mr Bradford’s stock is in sured for £400 in the Royal Insurance Company. ; Ic is understood that, although a summons has beeu issued, nothii g lurcher will o© heard of the case iu which Mr VVaisdn, mining manager of t’ie.Suliemau Pasha Company, is charga-i with obstructing the Town Council mine inspector in the execution of his duty. The council feels that there isjio necessity to be. harsh, especially when the direct id and shareholders in the com* pany are residents of! the district who are de voting both rime and money to the important work of developing the resources of the Town. . We are informed that Mr D. Cooke does not intend to comply with the request of a.uumbor of ratepayers to become a cmlidate for the south ward in the City. Council. .

Mr Finlayson, instructed by Messrs fi>«l;er and Pinkerton, appeared for the plaintiff, and Mr Hardy for the defendant. The cause of action, it will be remembered, owing to certain statements furnished by Mr Northey to the paper mentioned, and which contained an accusation of carelessness in refer- ence to the labelling of two bottles of medicine issued to an out-patient at the Ballarat Hos- pital. The bottles purported to contain - one a poisonous eye lotion, and the other a medicine for internal use, and it was alleged that the labels bad been interchanged. The plaintiff was dispenser at the Hospital, and instituted the. action for the purpose of clearing himself from any blame of carelessness. It was proved that the bottles were correctly labelled, and that the statement to the contrary had emanated from the defendant. The amount of damages named was £49 but nominal damages only were sought for. For the defence it was contended that the representative of the journal in which the alleged slander appeared had been called in by the defendant merely as an expert, and bad not been told the matter for publication. His Honor, after hearing the evidence, gave a verdict for the plaintiff for £l0, costs to be taxed. His Honor said that had the plaintiff pressed for special damages, be would have awarded a larger amount.

Our load correspondent writes; * 1 At the meeting of the Balia at*hire Council on Monday I there was so much unnecessary discussion ovor trifling matters—so many relays in making refe rence to ‘I I minutes to settle points which were not actually in dispute, th-*t,. really what was only one hour's business, as may b j seen on reference to the report, took three and a half or neatly four hours to get through. Cr Spiers murmured at times; Cr Uren »l*o appeared dis satisfied, and the president loudly rapped the desk occasionally to suppress spoken whimpers and to have less general noise, but bis eff *rts were very impotent in the direction of expedit ing business,” At the Smythosdale Police Court yesterday the only case set down for bearing was Hyland v Roaoh, for work and labor done, £i t and an order for the amount, and 15* co-ts, was made by the bsneh.

"■ ■ The "disdiissionuf the groat" question of the day (writes the Argus London correspondent) has been enlivened by one or two incidents which hare attracted attention. An unfortu nate though very apposite metaphor u-ed by Lord Salisbury at Hackney last week has bran seized upon t> represent his lordship as st : gma- Using the Russian Government as “awmd'Ora hr bankrupts.” aod it is said that a despatch has-been written by il. de Giers to his ambas sador at Berlin, denouncing Lord Salisbury’s language as an insult. Lord Salisbury took occasion ra-ly in the week t> repudiate the in terpretation which'Ur Gladstone, Mr Trevelyan, and Lord Harrington among others bad put upon bis speech, and we may now hoar less ot the matt-r. Meanwhile, Lord Granville and Lord R. Churchill have fallen foul of eacb other in amnsii.g fashion. The Foreign Minister assailed Lord Salisbury for vouching in his Hackney speech for Lord Randolph Churchill’s hietnrioal . review of the doings of Russia in Central Asia, and said that the loader of the Fourth party was inaccurate from eud to side. Thereupon Lord Randolph retort* iu a column letter t> the Times, nbusingLord Granville through nil the moods aud tenses. The style of the letter is wholly against the writer, and it is a pity that a man of the commanding position of Lord Randolph should descend to the methods of Mr O'Brien and Mr Healy. These outbursts seem to be periodic with the noble lord, a id make many of his warmest friends despair of him. _ A novel present to to Queen.—Her Majesty has accepted from the .Rev, John Thomson, minister of St. John’s Established Church, Hawick, a handsome little plough, manufactured out of swords, dirks, and spea-s, and accom panied by an illuminated address.

This, taken in conjund- ■ tiun with the appointment of working men to tha office of factory inspectors, ought to go a long way at the coming ganoralelectioh.

We ( Echo) are in' receipt of the I ,test fites of the Dublin Daily Express, and the ndverti- ement columns of a single issue supplies ns wi-h some valuable information on this point. The first “ad” expresses a desire for the services of an incumbent for a southern parish at a 'sultry' of t'l'2o per annum, together with twenty acres and a house. The “ nominators” in whose gift this big prize lias seem to'think that a b mhtlar with a'l the money might lapse into unoithodox exuav 'gtnes, and so they grimly conclude the adve- tisement with a notification that preference will b - given t > a married mao I Next comas a ‘‘oslT’ tor an inoumbrnt who is offered no less than £l5O with “ probable additions.” "* Pro b ible a Iditioos” is a great stroke of poliev.

Mr Justice Higinbotham holds very emphatic views on the hearing of divorce cases in "pubic, and contends that the allowing the court to be crowded while “disgusting” testimony is being given in a “disgusting” divorce case, is graa'ly prejudicial to the morality of the community. He speaks almost sorrowfully of the intent look be has observed on the faces of a dense mass of men, boys, and even women while one of the latter sex is in the box. His Honor thinks that 1 this is a milter that should engage the early attmrion of legislators, and that power should br given to the judgejo clear the court in ouch oases.

Mr Lab inchera and the Irish members delivered themselves after their kind, bnt it was not expected thst a Conservative like Mr Lewis would have found it necessary to warn the . husbands of the lidies of the Royal family against taking sides on political questions.
