Twelve clauses,' arid those not 'the most important of the I measure, got through in one' week is assuredly no great feather iri the cap of a Ministry confronted by no organised ''op position. .Some good work has rieverthe-! less been done. , The clauses iri regard to Sunday trading have been passed, and the ridiculous provisions .which ; appeared in ?the- measure on its introduction by 'the Government, 'abolishing' barmaids, have ib'een excised. Henceforth the 'liquor- dis- pensing; syrens,' so dreaded by the. gallant i Colonel Smith, and so disturbing to- the' morals of Messrs. Hall and Gardiner, may possess their imperilled souls in peace.' So many silly propositions were made, ? in , the, shape of - amendments on the original Go vernment proposal prohibiting- the em ployment in licensed houses of any female under the age of 21 years, and some of the ridiculous amendments were rejected by such d very narrow majority, that Mr 1 Kerf erd, wisely withdrew the 'portion of, the bill known as ? ' the bar maid, clause,' and thus saved the, colony from, the ridi-: ' cule which stupidly, restricted legislation. . ; lypuld have caused to attach to Victoria. ?
