A REFLECTION. As we hopelessly moura o'er the days of our youth And seek to recall the bright joys of the past ; Or look back on illusions we then deemed were truth Ere the bright dreams of fauoy by dark clouds o'er <'"..'oatt/ . : Had faded, and taught us man's fate is to sigh. And mourn in the present for hopes that will die. Shall we shrink from reflections, and hopelessly'pray For Lethe's dark waters to wash them away ? Nay,' rather let's gaze thro' tho vista of timo ; t ? . Nor' heed the foul spectres aud ghosts that appear, The light sbadea of follies, grim shadows,of crime,:.. Shrink net from the prospect ; gaze on without fear, ' And though contemplation may cost us a tear, . ;.. It,will teaoh sweet repentance for follies long gone; And to seek in the future tho oast to condone. " " '' ,ยก!i i;,,, , ?/'. . CHARLTON.PARK. ' Corinda, October 30, 1881.,
