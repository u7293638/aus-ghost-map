OUR SERIAL STORY. THE BROTHERS. By SHAN F. BULLOCK, Author of " By Thrasna River," "Ring o' Bushes," &c.;, &c.; [PUBLISHED BY SPECIAL ARRANGEMENT.] (COPYRIGHT). We, Dennis Hayes, and oneself, were on the broad road, which from the shores of Lough Lamar, runs light and straight through the outskirts of Gavan, then crosses the border, and soon is wending for Leek town and the heart of Meath. Hitherto, our way had lain through an arid country a place of "bleak rocky mountains, scrubby bills, and bare voú ages scattered spareley among barren, unsheltered fields i now, once án fat Meath, suddenly all was changed. From a desert we had passed, as it were, to a land of gardens. The hedges sprang thick and tall; the bills stood round and fruitful} the fields lay. dash and soft; here was aiox-cover.-there a cluster of giant poplars, far off stretched .a fir. plantation backed; by the, fight blue of a mountain and the í gb ter azure of the horizon; everywhere . prosperity lay. ! blooding -and fimilingr- on the .'groldeu orchards, the snug farmhouses, " the great wide^preading pastures.*' ''' -'> We were just in the thick of «ll that ; when, suddenly, almost in sight of the white walls of Leek, over the hedgerow on our left rosethe gaunt skeleton of . a house. Like the wreck of "Some high admiral "it lay, forlorn andpitable, its rafters naked: to the sky, its window^ holes empty_ andr moss-grown, its wails cracked and weather-stained ; within and without a placé of weeds and desolation, a home of loneliness and Jgbosts/ Like a plague epot it showed on the comeliness of the country side. The sudderiincon¿ruity of it all was startling, nnd involuntarily î turnedto Demiis. -~ . " What, in heaven's name, does it meanP" saidL "Is-is it haunted or what?' - ? V Without a oword, Dennis stepped across the road, mounted the ditch and stood looking ? ' over t the v hedgerow; Quickly I fol towed ; and there had sight of thee whole forlornness of the place. Here was an^ orchard,tangled; broken ; there » hnggai'd^ empty end disprdei-ed^ between ibeav lay a" garden in^ riotous ruin; a wjitôernêBB ,of tmoked "ïrmfc trees, flaunting -weeds, '.. overgrown paths, fumbled beehives, ^Phe yardwäs meadow .; the outhouses «, long misery :of nroken-walls ar^ hat^^ IT)O£S. -Wpt a bird stirred in - the'empty eaves, not a hoof showed itself on hüí ór field ; right and left, here and there, was only loneli- ness and desolation. ..; ïtora while I stood there looking and wondering i theil, quite suddenly and discordantly, like-the sound of a meadow crake breaking through the stillness of the night, came the harsh voice of Dennis. ? '. . _ - * It get's worse land worse," said he, and slowly wagged hie head; "woree janel worse. Last time 1 came these par!» 'twas-only.. an. - eyesojo^^ like some deserted gravev^'d pt¡ «ther. Ay. It's miserable to cast eyes on it. lt's 'like something you'd ¡dreaui about. An', mau, the pity it is.

Well, cornela way an' Til tell ye," said he: then left the ditch)' took again to the road; in a while clambered over a rusty iron gate and led the way along a narrow track which rájr ihitmgh' the fields and down the slope on whose broad crest stood."the~ruined? house. "The best land in Ii^láníf," moaned Dennis "as he went, his* bairds beneath his coat tails, and Ins " eyes roaming far and near ; "an' it gone to the devil. Look at it, goin* to Waste.

An' there's the trees it was tied to; an' there's the clump he lay hid in, and there's where he fell;- an' there's where sher Never mind ; wait till I come to it," said Dennis, sitting upright ; then took two or three quick puffs and went on. "It's wonderful to the world," said Dennis,;m.that sententious way he had at times, ** indifference there is in people. I often think of jjb. There's av whole ! mile between, every mah, woman an' child iftv every townland; and there's from liere to Mwlingar between every two nations.- Ay, there is that. You're yourself,-an'.

Take us as ye like ; in f armin' in ways o' lookin' at things, in our talk, *in' our songs, an' our habits, we're just as mach -like the English* in these :parts, as a turnip's Hke> carrot. Ay, we are; an' TU hiing ye a proof by.pointin' to the house np there, an' tefiin' about the men "that jised to own it. What happened to them would never ha' happened to one of ourselves'; the way they lived/,.an' spoke, an' dressed,- an' carried on wasn't our way-; an' if you'd meet them out there on the road, you'd tum and look rat .them, an' say to your I self that the blood in them was as j foreign as a Chinaman's. Ye would so ; an'you'd be right. " 'Twas far back, years and years ago, Í that the father o' them came to Meath, an' took the land you're sittin' oh, an* settled down in the big house abovedan' ' gave us all a «quint at his English ways.

They were what you'd call gentleman farmers these kind-that believe in working wi' their eyes an' wits an' keepin' their: hands in their pockets. You'd never find one o' them at the tail of aplougb, or bendin' a hay-fork across his knee, or sittin' down to his dinner at the back ox a ditch. Aw no. That wasn't theil* English way. They knew better ; than that. 'Twas out ^ o' bed 'at daybreak an'- alway through the fields an' the dew; 'twas back to their breakfast,at six, an' out again to set the men to their work ; then 'twas saddle a hôïse an* away with Harry over the land,, roamin' up an* down, here an' there ; an' out after-him'd go Ned, a gun on his arm, a dog at Iiis heels, an' not man nor molts! wi the ghost of a notion where hewasgoin'. "No, sir ; no man could fathom Ned. You'd see Harry on the horse a mile away, ak' you'd know his whereabouts by the laugh an' whistle of him ; but Ned'd come upon ye as sudden as a cat on the stairs, an' him wi' his eyes down, an' them burnin' holes in évevfchípjr he'd Bée.

He d hardly give yo time to light your rp'i$e¡ ; an' If so be you'd anger bim he'd flare out afc ye wi* English oaths that'd make ye gasp like a dyin' fish; But set a woman in Ned's way, be ehe lady or beggarwoman, an''he'd be as soft in the tongue an' bright in the eye as a draper tryin'-tó sell ye a suit o' clothes. Tes : women were Ned's weakness. He liked them, an' he said'he ¿id, an''he told them so; an'Bure, bein* what they are, they listened to his Weather, an' liked bim back. Anyway, one .did, an' it's no I matter about the rest : an' it's about herself I'd now be tellin* ye." ^ (To ie concluded.)
