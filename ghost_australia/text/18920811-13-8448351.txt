THE ELSTERNWICK " GHOST." Complaints have been made to the police that a man who was riding on a pony and whose face was blackened, while he wore a white cloth over himself and the pony, accosted Miss Esther Stewart on Thursday nigh on the Balaclava-road, near the corner of Orrong-road. The young lady, whose parents reside in Loch- street, was riding towards Caulfield in the evening, when the man attempted to seize the reins of her horse, at the same time flashing the light of a bull's-eye lantern in her face. It, however, happened that a buggy was approaching, and the man at once galloped away. The young lady was, of course, terribly frightened, but so far no serious results have occurred, A clue has, it appears, been obtained by the police, who are in hopes of soon being able to effect an arrest.
