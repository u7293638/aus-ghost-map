THOUGHTS IN A MEADOW. \- * O why in this breathing field, this meadow of Maytime, Ashbarry with silvering gusts ; Why, O my soul, must thou still with a sadness behold it Strangely disturbed from far? And why is thy bliss never simple and never entire ? What hinders thee so to be gay? O soul, hadst thou walked on a world hub newly created ; if thou wertthoflrstthat had breathed; Then this brooding arch of! the blue were beautiful merely, Perfect the greenness of grass. But ah, through thine eyes unnumbered . dead ones are peering ; To the windows the phantoms through Those millions of perished women, and poets, and lovers, Gaze where thou gavest and breathe ; And by ghosts is the blowing meadow- land unforgotten ; % Memories deepen the blue. So through tears not our own is the sunset ' strangely pathetic; And splendid with thoughts not ours. So feet we from far-off' hills a soft invitation, A divine beckon and call. At the sudden mysterious touch of a stranger who tremble ; At lightning from eyes in a crowd ; And a child will sorrow at evening bells over meadows, And grieve by the breaking sen. O never alone can we gaze on the blue and the greenness ; Others are gazing and sigh ; And never alone can we listen to twilight music ; Others listen and weep And the woman that sings in the dimness to millions is singing: Not to thee, O my soul, alone.
