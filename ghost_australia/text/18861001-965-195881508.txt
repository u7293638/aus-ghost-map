An Old Story in Terse. He was a guileless college youth, That mirrored modesty and truth ; And sometimes at his musty room His sister called, to chase the gloom. One afternoon, when she was there, Arranging things with'kindly care, As often she had done before, There came a knock upon the door. Our student, sensitive to fears Of thoughtless comrades* laughing jeers, Had only time tq make deposit Of his dear sister in a closet ; Then haste the door to open wide ; His guest unbidden stept inside. He was a cheeiy-faced old man, And with apologies began For calling, and then let him know That more than fifty years ago, When he was in his youthful bloom, He'd occnpied that very room ; So thought he'd take the chance, he said, To see the changes time had made. "The same old window, same old view— Ha, ha I the same old pictures, too 1" And then he tapped them with his cane, And laughed his merry laugh again. " The same old sofa, I declare 1 Dear me! It must be worse for wear. The same old shelves I" And then he came And spied the closet door. " The same Oh, my I" A woman's dress peeped through. Quick as he could he closed it to. -- He shook his head. «• Ah I ah I the same Old game, young man, the same old game 1" " Would yon my reputation slur ? " The youth gasped; " That's my sister, sir!" " Ahl" said the old man, with a sigh, " The same old lie—the same old lie 1" Ah English divine once told of passing a night in a haunted chamber in an English castle. He described how tbo ghost slowly stalked into the chamber, and described the armour which covered the form of the mysterious visitor. " But how did you get rid of this vision I" cried some of those who beard the -story. " Oh, very easily," replied the minister ; " I merely took my subscriptionbook from the table and. the vision quickly faded away." A lady, who was a member of a class studying art, concluded a recitation on Benjaman Haydon by saying that " towards the close of his life he committed suicide. - A lady writer asks : " Why don't bachelors marry ? " That's so— why don't they ? Come tp. think about it, we have not yet seen a bachelor who.wasmarried. It's lamentable, too.
