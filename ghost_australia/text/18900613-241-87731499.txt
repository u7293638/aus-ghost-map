A SINGULAR COURTSHIP. By W. C. P. Oun modern civilisation lhas devised many. novel methods whereby those rwho are matrimonially inclined may secure hus bands 'or wives; but we venture to 'say thiat, amongst thllose :whonm singular acci dehts or matrimonial agencies havdbroduglit .tbgeither, it would be diflicult to"ffind any lwhose fate has been determined byri more remarkable" conjunction of "circumisttances thlii tliiitd(iscribed in the fbllowiiig iiiiirr tiye. Every,link in tliis `singular chain witils -forged by superstitioin, and yet, as things turned out, all ended happily. Many years ago there lived at the little English village of Bakeewell, in Derbyshire, a quiet labouring family of the name of Arnold. The old man and Lis wife had one ds?ghtellt Annie, a briglt-eyed, dark-haired gitl'of 'siteeii. Slf. Â·tiiis gil-lobking; and thoughl possessed of many feminine graces, she could almost do a masculine amount of work,land was therefore a great support to her fatlier a iiil iiibthef. Slie could iiininge fariti work of most sorts, and when thatwas not to be had, slle would find somethling to emdIlo' herin a neigltbding.mine. Neces airily hie canme into contact witli a good many of the roughlir sex; and,: lbeing a good-natured, wa'illing .girl, had. already imade. several qonquests over their suscep-. tile lhearts; but li-d niever yet seeii the one slie.vtidld hlasv lik.ed to iiisarry. In tliose di'ys, suliersitibiei was at its, height, and an'. dillicu?lty that wanted sol'ving was submitted. to the. po?i:si of spells for divinlatioin. Most of the ignOrant imiplicitly beli?ied_ in their ellicacy, aind plractised them to a grealtextent. Annie 'las no exception;inmd, young thoilgh showlas, she had a strong desire to know her fiture fate. Once she Sad even exlorted'c priest wllo passed tlhat way to solve the 'secret'for her, but lie warned her not to tempt the Virgin or piry inito the nikisknowi. Gipsies had told hei" fortfine, hbit ilwnas never fulfilled. All niaiinsei." 'if cllai'nls and incailtations ihad she triedsl, yet without siuccess ibut for all this siCe did hot despair, and placed as murclh trust in every succceding trial Is she had done in tlhis firsl. On St. 'Thlmnas's Eve, slte took the pre scribed but unpoetica l large red onion, and stcck ninl pins in it, according to tile customi. This slhe did by making ia little circle of eight of thenl, and placing tlihe ninltil in the middle, naming it "true love." 'This she put uitler her pillow, and repeated the all-i)owerful ver?e: "Good St. Thoinas, do me sight, Send ile my truie love to night, In his clothes and his Trray. 'lich lie wearetll every day." That night, in hajipy dreams, she saw tile young sifan who was to be lier future I us anld : but tihe features were strange to hle', though lie wore labouring clothes. Ever safter, she looked intently at every fresh face, to discover a likeness to her vision, lbut without success. When New Year's Eve came round, she invited some of her young friends to come and. join in merry homely pastimes. All sorts of curious gamnles thlley layed. and tlie pleasant joke ipassedl freely round in a mannrer that would put to shanme many of the shium, cold. and uncomnfortable recepion.fs of the present day. As a conclusion to the evening's entertainment, Annie brought out at large substantial dish. filled withl what w'as called a cold posset, of her own making. It was imadei of milk, ale, egos, currants, anl spice; anm lastls-, but not least, her anther's e wdding-riig ' :is thrownm in. Tlheni each guest took a lailleful out, and in so doing attempted to catcll the ring. for, wlhoever did so was certain to be mlar ried before the next year was out. Whether Annioe had prepared it tsiitll a charm or not. ciiteain it is thalt she was the lckvonewho fishedsi up thIe ring: and loud were the con gratulations on all stides, for she w'as much ieloved by ller companions. Thees repeated predictions only increatsed lier curiosity, and she lost no opiportunity of further solving her destiny. On St. Valentine's Day. therefore, she peeped tls-ough the keyhole before opening sthe outer door, in the hope of seeing two or more Ispel.sons, in which case she 'wsould have a sweetheart ver\ soon: But better still, She saw a cock and lion, which denotedC according to ])erlbyshire belief, thalt she wvoul lie married before the year was out. Everytlhing seemled to concur in promlising ler s?narrieit felicity that year, and yet, in quisitive girl,' she did niot know who w?'as her sweetheart! Slle was suire it wis sno one shoe had ever seen before, for tihe face in hrcl ilream was totally different fromn any ele could rememlber,. Thus tiie went oil, and she iwas no wiser than ever. 3lidsunmier ]Eve 'had arriied. and she determined to carry out ia boller project ftishan any slte had before attelmpted, to colllirml her forer dreamns. It was one which very fewa girls dare do, and the last one Liit hatud perfornlted it live years before 'was a wild runaway whomn they did not care to emulalte. ]lut Annie w's a -ibrave girl, and dsared to attempt it for her own satisfaction. Hlero pIaceitswire not averse to it, but let her have her own 'wa1y, fore seeing no harm : they placed great trust in tlie girl. and so feared nothing. The chars slit intended to pserform was this: to go o the churchyard at midnighst. and when tihe clock struck twelve, to run a similar nlumber of times round tile cllhurc, repeating: " I sow lielpseed-hliemn seed 1 sow, lie that loves ule best, Comne after tile and mo\v." The ligure of the young woman's lover is then Slupposed to aipear and follow lier. As the timte approached. slse.felt rather nervous ; but iseing a ii'l of good sti'iit, she iniCceld erself upl fortlhe occasion; andil at half--iinst elevin o'clock bade." L (iod-night" to her fatller and inother, witli i ctheeiful hletrt. Altllougll superstitious, she was not afraid, and lhad oftei gonle tit night to etransge milaces where a oma wosuld hlave fearedl to 'nature near. s ut a churcls lsyard it miidniglt is not a very congenial spot, thougil upos this night tle moan sholne brilliantly, and slle could see tle ols chlurech luite llainly in thle distance. Though fi:ndying she sa'sw figures flitltiligihore iind Shiere: as tle moon was temporiarily obscciredl iv the whlite fleecy clouds, SIle 'sent on un lanstcd till lshe re'ached thie little porch, anl the gate creakedl open at her touch. Though she w'as alone, and almost wisling slie lhad not come, hlier curiiosity adl prlide r-sol'ed hers. She waited une'sils till the oli bell clinkeld out its dismal soussd--the thoselly signal of spirit:revelry- sandI tihe ind sl rustled in the treet witt h an eerie sough.
