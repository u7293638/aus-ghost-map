BARNABY PALMS ; THE. MAN W.HO "FELT HIS WAY,'... . . s chaf.'i... That philosopher was an ass. who, .trembling at the peril inherited with his eyes, resolved to avoid nil mischief by putting them out. We know, that in this narrow, gloomy passage, called the world, eyes are, so to speak, edged tools— hurting the wearer. We know that, de- ceived by them, we often sliake mid wonder at a: stalking giant, when, in truth,, the Polyphe mus is only a swaggering mountebank on wooden stilts, — and doff our caps to a. glister ing glory, which, stript of its outside, is more loathsome than an ape. On the other hand, how many, with a wise tjnrrany, use their eyes as the meanest vassals, never suffering tliem to play truant in the summer clouds — to hang on summer flowers — to lose their time with un profitable exhalations, or- to try to spell the mystery of tlie stars ! No ; prudently discie plined, the ocular servants help their masters to dress and undress — to save them from posts and pillars when abroad — to eat their meat — and to take especial care that no shilling be a counterfeit. Alas! though the best philoso phers lack such wisdom, Barnaby Palms was endowed/with it to fulness. Locke has said, that two men looking at a. ruinbow, do not, indeed,-: see the same rainbow- (Two men, looking at one guinea, are, we conceive, quite in another position.) Now, Barnaby never thought of trusting his eyes but with the lowest duties, instinctively keeping them from all de licate embarrassments. In the petty, menial wants of life, Barnaby might employ his eyes ; in the momentous concerns of this world, he winked, and securely — felt his way. At the green age of eighteen, Barnaby pos sessed the ripe fruit of two scorej But the truth is, Barnaby had never been a child. In the nurse's arms, he was a very manikin, show ing an extraordinary precocity in the choice of the ripest apple and the biggest cake. Left as a legacy to an only uncle, the boy flourished, after his " own sweet will," unchecked and un assisted save by the scantily-paid attentions of a well- meaning pedagogue, vegetating some six miles from the Kentish coast. Poor Joshua ! he might Have learned of his scholar — might have sucked worldly wisdom even from- the suckling. "VVe repeat it ; at eighteen Barnaby was a match for grey hairs. Barnaby had a deep respect for his uncle ; in fact, so deep, it all but sank to fear. Thus our hero spared no pains to feel' his. way to the heart of his' relative, who, be it understood, en- joyed the reputation of a wealthy man,— albeit old inhabitants of' the town would sometimes marvel how his wealth had been: acquired. Palms, senior, dwelt in almge dilapidated man sion within gunshot of the sea ; his household consisting of an old man and his daughter, a pretty, gay-hearted lass of eighteen. Old Palms was seated in his oak parlor, steadily employed upon a breakfast, of which beef and Kentish ale, with an incidental drop of white brandy, formed the principal part. Before him sat Barnaby in trim travelling attire. He looked and spoke the creature of humility. Could he have made the transfer, he would, have given his eouI to his uncle 'tis readily as he advanced the mustard. 1 The ; truth is,' Bar naby was about to enter' the world : .hehad drawn on his boots for tlie. great pilgrimage of life. In a few hours and he must feel his way through the crowd of London, being destined to the warehouse of Messrs. Nokes and Styles, mercers, City. Hence the reader may imagine that Barnaby was subdued by the approaching event— that he felt sbme odd twitchings at tlie heart as he stared at the old wainscot, with its every worm-hole familiar to him — that a some thing rose to his throat, as he looked out upon the sea, tumbling and roaring in concert with a January gale— at that sea which had sung his early lullabys — that his heart, like the ocean- .shell, -still responded to the sound. It is reason able to believe— though we cannot substantiate the: fact— that Eome' such emotions rose in the. bosom of the pilgrim. Of this, however, we are certain ; Barnaby looked with the eyes of a devotee towards a small leathern. bag, lying :on the table at tbe right- hand of his uncle ; 'and Barnaby continued1 to gaze at th'e string secur ing the neck, until, abstracted by the appear ance of Patience Mills; who — the . more serious portion of the breakfast consumetl-r-eniere 1 with a dozen' of eggs., / Now, Patience had a . face as i round, . and cheeks as red, as any . pippin, — eyes blue as heaven — and a mouth, as a certain1 young man on the coast avowed, sweet as a honey-comb. Nevertheless, had Patience 'been some snadk'e- dried hag, Baraabjr 'had .not ''yifitdd'h# (T$h' looks less charitable. Patience . replied to. the glance' with ! a giggle, eolacing herielf, when out of hearing, by muttering, "glad- he's' going.' Barnaby looked at his uncle's' fingers; and' then at the bag. Heedless ef 1 the hint,' old' Palms' took an egg. '' ' '' 'i;; - " Come, eat, Barney : eat. .Ye'll have' a cold ride to London : 'thh north wind's ,pdged like a scythe. What Fnot'take eggs'?l .'i.', J, , " "Doat ., on. 'em, - uncle, " /'cried : Barnaby, aroused, like Shylock, from a "dream of money bags.". ' The'fact is, Barnaby had that day de termined to like every' thing's bn'that occasion he wished to 'leave an impression1 of his' meek ness and humility. ' " Quite a weazel at eggs, uncle," .continued -Barnaby, .and .he began to chip the shell, Now.it so happened that Bar naby liad.fallen . upon am egg- which,- on being opened,- emitted conclusive evidence of its an tiquity. Old Palms, instantly perceiving tlie :work:of' time, roared to Barhoby to cast the abomination . out1 of 'the' window.' Barnaby, however; d'etermihed to give an example , of his economy--' of, his .indifference to' petty annoy ance— saii lllce a statue, ; still .holding .the egg between his- finger and thumb — his uncle ap plying .-thet same / instruments" to his own nose, - ' " ' : '.'/ ' " -.i «-Out with it, Barney !'" Barnciy smiled a ! remonstrance; and : handled . / hi' , "spoon. " Zounds . 1 /hepheW-wbyah, .' '.ah', !— you'll never! eat.it?" Barnaby," mistaking the - humor ofr his uncle, nodded knowingly., , | i.-.-nsui':. ' : You will?, M tell yom?tisa:musty'egg--a bad egg — pah ! the egg stinks'!'' ' ' ' / Barnaby looked as tbougn he believed 'lie hail won his uncle's heart foif 'ever, and then complacently made answer,' . " I' don't care for eggs oyer fresh." ;Now, we boldly declare the egg of Barnaby to be a grander subject. for the moralist and the romance-writer than either the egg of Colum bus, the famous roc's egg of .the eastom prin cess, or the egg of Mother Goose. Reader, pause a moment, and reflect on the prosperity of whole hordeB of people, whose success in life is solely attributable -to their participating in the taste of. Barnaby. ' Lpok at his lordship, sparkling with honors, and :paddcd with bank paper! know ye to whathe owes all this ? Oh, doubtlos8-to his high' statesmanlike qualities — his profound1 knowledge — his indefatigable in dustry: Not so, hot so ; the simple story is, lie was wont to confidentially breakfast with the Minister, and on such occasions showed' that he cared notifor eggs. over fresh." shall we stay at courts and' courtiers ? jo from a palace to a workshop there is ever soth'' ductile eater — some omnivorous, obseqajbd""'1 Barney at breakfast, who has made, or looks to make, a figure in the wprld by not caring forhis eggs ' over fresh.' Many are the ways ia which the tale may be told. There is Tom Spangle a handsome, healthy, six-foot animal of two-and ! thirty. He had not a shilling ; now, he rides '' blood and signs cheques. Do you know the secret of the change ? Very well ; he married the ancient, yellow widow of an army-coatrac- tor. Ay, even so : he cared not for his e?e ? ' over fresh.' The avowed taste of Barnaby was not lost upon his uncle. The old man looked tlirou"!; the youth with a thinking eye— an eye that' seemed to read his moral anatomy, and then uttered a long "hem!" at the same time stretching his hand to the money-bag. Invi sible fingers were playing on the heart- strings of Barnaby, whilst, from the corner of his eye / he watched his uncle slowly untie the strip 0f knotted leather which "compressed the god" within." The bag was opened;' its glorious1' contents blazed on the table ; and as they ran? upon the oak, Barnaby instinctively rose to his" feet, standing respectfully uncovered "In the - - presence." "Barney," said old Palms, and reverently,'11 laid his hand upon the gold, " Barney , my 'child' you see the little hoard I've set apart for yoii." ' 'Tlie life-blood of Barnaby tingled irt "his yery', eyes, and liis ears rang with music. " You see ' the few savings and scrapings I have made for /., the child of my brother. For I feared that,1 you, an innocent, unprotected, unassisted.lad would need the aid which money can alone af- ; ford. Barney, I trembled for the softness of- - your heart — the simplicity of your naturei1' Here Barney felt almost in peril1 of 'teari, "Yes, Barney, these were my weak anxieties, ' my foolish fears." Saying which,' the, old man began to return the guineas to the, bag, Dur- 1 ing the operation, not a word was spoken. Barney, scarcely > venturing to breath, stood - with his head bent on his breast,1 and one eye' on the table, silent and subdued. ' The tinkling ' of the gold — the voice of Barney's fortune, was alone audible ; and, as note followed note, the young expectant became possessed as though he listened to angelic trumpets, The bag be-1 ing filled, Palms proceeded to tie: its mouth, '- talking as he leisurely tied. " Barney, I find my fears were the fears of ignorance'. - You need not such a sum as this ; you are already rich in strength — in wisdom." : "I, uncle ?" cried Barnaby, sensitively shrink ing from the compliment, and at thie same time ; —struck by the manner of Pajnis— breaking into a profuse sweat, "I strong? . : I wise ? Oh uncle 1" " Come, Barney, why so modest ?: - I Bay,- strength and wisdom, as the world' 'goes, are yours. Here we've a hundred guineas1 in this little bag ; what then? to a lad of; your' wit they're little worth/ You'll never miss .'em. Now, here," and Palms slid the coin , along -the:, table, "here are five guineas." . :i . " Five 1 uncle!" . "Five. The reward of your skill— of the skill you have shown this morning." 1 " Five guineas ? skill? uncle." "Never doubt it, Barney ; take up.the mo . ney, and never mistrust that head of thine;,- far- well I know, that the fellow who, in -this work,- ing world, cares not for his eggs ' over fresh,' will, in the end, flourish as well though ho begio with five guineas, as with five thou '- sand." The tone and manner of old Palms forbade any reply on tbe part of his nephew, who, ne vertheless, reeeived the eulogy with a sulkiness worthy of the great cynic. Indeed, had. Bar naby pocketed five snow-balls he could not have looked more blank and frozen ; could not have mounted the borrowed horse, ready sad' died, to convey him to London, with more re luctaut leg, with grimmer countenance.' No ,, wonder ; Barnaby thought he had'securely felt , , his way ; now, Barnaby had lost, ninetyrfiva . guineas. ... 1 chap. ii. 1 There is a golden volume yet to be writtea on the first struggles of- forlorn genius in Lon don — magnificent, miserable, ennobling,' de grading London. If all who have suffered would confess their sufferings— would show , tiiemselves in the stark shivering.squalor.nl which they first walked her streets, — would paint the wounds which first bled, in her gar- . rets — what a book might be placed in the hand of pride! — what sustaining sweetness for the faint of spirit. It-is true, the letters might he of blood— the tales, of agony and horror of noble natures looking serenely .with' the hungry fox! knawing their bowels— of misery, dreaming ., of, and wooing death ; and then . how , many r. petty shifts tp mask a haggard, face, with smiles . \- — how many self denials — -how many sacrifices . to hide a nakedness from laughing scorn. Nor . would tne tome he all of wretchedness.- No; beautiful emanations of the human heart— the kindest ministerings of human affections would,,, sweeten and exalt many a sad history... .How often should we find the lowly, comforting, the, . lowly comforting the high — the ignorant giving - lessons to the accomplished,— the , poor -:of .the,' earth aiding and sustaining the richly, endow- ered. ' . . . Barnaby was in London i but not1 — -our hoort hounds as we declare it — not to add to, ,the number of splendid vagabonds, now thrust from: her thresholds to sleep in the market place, fltid. , now dining off plate cheek by jowl with roy loid. , Barnaby was speedily warm, as in wool, -in- tha - house of Messrs Nokes and Styles ; and with the combined wisdom and delicacy of the spider began to feel his way to the foibles of his em- , ployers. Nokes was a man of brass— Styles ,0 string of willows. Assured of this, Barnaby..:; immediately felt the propriety of bowingitoha . one, and bending the other, u, " Look at that lazy brute, — he do esn't, draw , a single pound," remarked the, observing Nokes, as one evening, standing 'at his ware house door he contemplated the progress of,0, , passing waggon. ; ' ,,, - , ' Not half a pound, sir," .Chimed. in Barnaby " and yet, sir, I doubt hot, he eats his, share. of corn and hay. But this it is to, be, as onP hwy''. say, in partnership with those who will pull.j ' " Right, Barnaby," and the countenance of Nokes darkened, as lie watched the easy-go'o , quadruped. " They who will work, may work. Will htt : Styles be here to-day ?' It is our hope that tlie query of Barnaby, _ WW unconsciously coupled with his. profound yiewa of the distribution of labor — that he had iano- cently let fall a spark on the train ot Nokes 9 smothered feelings. If, on the contrary, th® conflagration were premeditated, the nicial W , ccndiary must have glowed at the flattering , proof of his success ; for Nokes was.all hf- - suffocated.
