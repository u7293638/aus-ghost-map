KERRASSU. AN ABORIGINAL SONG The gums in the gully stand gloomy and stark-- A torrent beneath them is leaping; And the wind goes about, like a ghost in the dark, Where a Chief of Wahibbi lies sleeping! He dreams of a battle--of foes of the Past, But he hears not the whooping abroad on the blast, Nor the fall of the feet that are travelling fast. Oh! why dost thou slumber, Kerrassu? They come o'er the hills, in their terrible ire, And speed by the woodlands and water; They look down the hills at the flickering fire, All eager and thirsty for slaughter! Lo! the stormy Moon glares, like a torch from the Vale, And a voice in the cassa* grows wild in its wail, As the cries or the Wanneroo's swell with the gale. Oh! rouse thee, and meet them, Kerrassu! He starts from his sleep, and he clutches his spear; And the Echoes roll backwards in wonder; For a shouting strikes into the hollow woods near, Like the sounds of a gathering thunder! He clambers the ridge with his face to the light; The foes of Wahibbi come full in his sight-- Ha! the waters of Mooki will redden to-night. Go! and glory awaits thee, Kerrassu! Lo! yeelamans splinter, and boomerangs clash, And a spear through the darkness is driven, It whizzes along, like a wandering flash From the heart of a hurricane driven, They turn to the mountains that gloomy-browed band; The rain droppeth down with a moan to the land; And the face of a chieftain lies burried in sand! Oh! the light that was quenched with Kerrassu! To-morrow the Wanneroo dogs will rejoice, And feast, in this desolate valley; But where are his brothers--the friends of his choice? And why art thou absent, Ewalli? Now Silence draws back to the Forest again, And the wind, like a wayfarer, sleeps on the plain; But the cheeks of a warrior bleach in the rain! Oh! where are the mourners, Kerrassu? HENRY KENDALL. * The Native Oak.
