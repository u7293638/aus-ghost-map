History tells us that whenever aa heir to rich s or honour is wanted, a representative usually springs up somewhere..; Penelope was very cautious when Ulysses returned, and her cool reception of her lord was evidently based upon her previous knowledge of claimants. In our own history we know that the imprisoned Earl of Warwick the last male of the House of York, was personated in his lifetime by the baker boy, Lambert Simnel, whose pretensions involved a bloody battle, and the death of six thousand men, including an English earl and a veteran German general. He is.the *' Cockatrice King " of history, as Perkin Warbeck. who pretended to be one of the Princes murdered in the Tower, is the ''.Theatrical King." Of mock dauphins assuniing to be the unhappy prince who died under the torture of Simon the Cobbler, "in the Temple, the adventures of at least thirty have been recorded. One of them, Hervagult, was as great a hero with the populace as Arthur Ort-on himself, and Napoleon Bonaparte incarcerated him as a rogue and vagabond, while he shut up the Bishop of Viviers, his principal supporter—the Mr. • WhaHey of: the ' day—as - a" hopsiess madman. In our own genei-ation, the case : of Thomas Pwis, calling himself Sir Richard Hugh Smyth, is historical. In 1S50 this man. laid claim to a baronetcy and to vast estates at,Bristol; worth £30.000 per annum. His break down in the CIIT! action led to a prosecution for perjury, and he was convicted after a lengthy triaL It is curious to note that the father of the Coleridge who | cross-examined the Tichborne claimant was the presiding judge, and' the impostors counsel was Mr. Bovill, who, as Lord Justice, ; seat the claimant to Newgate for false swearing.

What really is surprising is that the role should have been essayed by au %noraut man of no great natural sharpness, { ' Lambert Simnel is:described by Bacon as | j "a lad of very pregnant parts"'j and Perkm S • Warteck ^viE^^lieaata&i;}}' .;•€>&' .wit|' subtle and crafty^ in education pr^uan^ i ; and in language sk3fuL JS Ptovis was: a- . pulillc^-.lecnirer;- a vskilM.forger;.' andt.liad-| graduated in tliat fine school for dissimulation, a comict establishment.

The sucee^ of Orton would indeed have been a serious matter. It would have gone far to demoralise society, r, for we should have liad impostors with equal assurance -and some measure of ability.
