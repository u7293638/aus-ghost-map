\-- THE HAUNTED TRAIN. The thrilling incideutfi herein narrated oc- j curred many years ago, ait a time when the* .. railway-system was - less developed thaif ifc now is, £*nd might, indeed, be pronouncfed to be in its infancy. Great pains" were taken, -and ;no~ expense spared, by those most directly interested in the prosperity of the line ohwhichj'thdy. occurred'to''prevent • their being noised'abroad. Wo will call the line, then,«if you please, . the 4jnalgamated Counties/- and' the twenty or thirty miles ; especially" concerned the Sea-Const Extension Branch. This branch, whose to minus was! in an important harbour town, which' we will call Ilardaport, was mXich frequented by sea faring- men, and it was fo one'of that class, a daring young fellow, who had 'known' •peril in every sea and in every 'quarter of the globe, that the company were finally inr debled for " the clearing of their line" of a very terrible drawback to the comfort bf safe and quiet travel.

Again the;heads of departments assembled at the Junction Hotel, and with closed doors deliberated as to what steps should be taken to lay this terrible ghost, and to get rid of 'the unpleasant name and reputation which had. already attached .itself to the train,'-and even the line., 1 , • v They had niucli faith, in the guard,'and, in fact, look'ed;to lum^'for thc&final; ;cl.qfcidatibnl of the mystdry.

On one or two occasions of danger, by dint of extraordinary courage an'd' presence of mind, he had saved the lives of ' passengers. Hence it was that, although only a young man, and a much younger servant of the company, he had been placed over the heads of older men, who, as was not unnatural, were rather jealous of his ad vancement. ' Opinions differed as to tho nature of th'e apparition. , . •, , - Twenty ideas were started, and* all abandoned, and the result was, as is not unfrequently the case, nothing definite was decided upon, save to take every precaution and use the utmost vigilance, and each, on the quiet, enjoined the guard to keep his eyes open, and above all things not to let the matter got wind, but to mystify all in quirers rather by silence, or, if needs be, by equivocation or absolute denial. Matters, were at this stage when Frank Gordon, who had left home seven years ago, a young ne'er-do-well, without even a good bye to friend or relation,, to seek his fortune on the ocean, in the bush, or in whatever part of the habitable world by land or sea Iho said fortunes weiv to lje found, or looked for—it was at. this crisis, we say, that Frank Gordon—a fine, strapping, sinewy, bushy bearded young man of five-and-twcnty— stepped ash on: at TIardaport, flush oi' health and strength, but flush of little cist-, save a nugget or two, his three months' pay as mate on board the Osprey—Sir Roger's Osprey, for aught we know— nnd a small rargo of ' curiosities from every quarter of tho globe j for the old folk in the old farmhouse in tlie ! old.
