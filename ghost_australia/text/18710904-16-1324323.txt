THE SUEZ MAIL. QUEENSLAND DELINEATED. (Saturday Review.) This book is written in a lively enough manner, and may be read with interest We would especially commend it to the attention of other University men who are sponding, as our author tells us he did, " the best part of four years at Oxford in a not very studious manner," and who will be found saying with him at the end of their career, " Certainly there are not very many courses open to the average Univoi city man who has not some money to start with it first." The average University men is not peculiar in this Let any other young man spend in luxurious indolence those four years of his life when he can perhaps team the most with the least trouble, and he will find that, with money or without money there will be not many courses open to him If he has money, the best thing he can do with it is to invest it in the Funds, and not to use it as capital till he has acquired experience But with money or without money, the only thing for a man to do is not to lament over the want of an opening, but to set about gaining those habits of industry and that knowledge which alone can fit him for the opening whoever he may find it We can imagine no change more painful than that which is experienced by the average University man when he wakes up and finds that college breakfasts and wines, cricket matches and boat races, are at an end, and that he must now face the world Those among them who have conscientiously devoted themselves to the new fangled athletic sports will perhaps for the best, for they have turned, if not thou minds, at all events Then bodies It is a pity that in these reports cannot be included digging or ploughing matches The interest surely would be quite as great in computing with one's follows in digging a rood of land and dabbling in potatoes us in running a three miles race or in making a high jump With what an introduction would the winner of the grand potato dibbling match enter one of our colonies, and how sure would he be of getting snapped up at once' At please the most suitable career that is open to our University athletes is that of the first letter eat nor We do not know, indeed, if they would do badly in select ing it, for at the price they can run they would get their day's work over in two 01 into boats, and would be sure to be rewarded for their early deliveries by most liberal Cliuslmus boxes Our author, as we infer from the way in which his back ached and his feet blistered, had not had much athletic training of any kind, and, as he himself admits, was about us unfit for colonial life as a man well could be- " I thus knowing nothing about colonial life, and very little about any other, with no idea of any kind of work, and with about as much lit ness for he is in a colony as for living in the moon, turned my thoughts to emigration What my contentions who, my intentions or plans, if I over had uni, I do not remember I bellin of 1 had a floating notion of making my fortune in a gown of! war, without very much exertion, which I oontcinpliitetl spending in an ungrateful country ulta a speedy return ' His friends, us friends will do, assured him of the certainty of finding that occupation in a new continent which did not present itself in the old, and he gladly lent himself to the belief A man who in the town where he has been brought up Finds no opening before him, thinks that in so wide and so remote a place as Australia there must be openings enough It is difficult for him to remember that, wide as Aus truth is, he elm only make trial of some one little corner of it, and that in that same little corner, us in his own town, there will likely enough be more people requiring employment than employment requiring people The one advantage that Australia really affords is the perfect freedom it gives to a man in our mug his broad, At the expense of merely of bodily suffer mg, and without any sense of degradation, an educated man can there become a hewer of wood and a drawer of water If one job fails him, he can turn to another, and like our author has can be a surveyor's map, a photographer's man, a navvy, a shepherd, a sausage milker, or a oondle-maker Nay, even by the aid of the higher education he may, with him, aspire to being either the common crier of the gold diggings or the Bohoohnnstor to a drunken black smith's children. He must expect a rough enough life and low wages, for, us we see by the last Australian papers, " the demand for knock about hands and lamb murders is comparatively and " there are no doubt some men who, in a few years thus spent will acquire that practical knowledge in which they were so sadly deficient If, at the same time, they can by dint of the severest economy have acquired some little capital, they will then be able to secure that we all li and that comfort which they had so foolishly expected to await them on their first landing The greater part of those so called educated men who make for Australia tire in all probability wanting in all those qualities which, whether in the new world of the old, are absolutely required by a man who hopes to acquire wealth At all events all the University and public school men our author came acroSS in Queensland were, without a single exception, hard drinkers - ' I was once shepherding on station belonging to a man who could barely read and write, who could not have done a rule of three sum to save his I/o, and the list of whose shepherds stood as follows Uno Cambridge man, one '1 ninety, Dublin , one ex lieutenant in the army, educated at Rugby, who had carried the Queen's colors (so he said) into the Redan, and buried the dead after wards , one Oxford man (myself) , one old Wiutoiiiiin and two Germans Wo five used to feel bound together by a kind of freemasonry, and use to meet together by the hour and talk Shop under the gum trees "All these men (myself excepted) used to drink frightfully, when they got the chance I did not simply from disinclination and it is owing to that fact that I am born of and writing the present pages About once in three months they would demand, cash, his cheque, and ask leave of absence for a few days, this would be readily granted, and they would re turn at the end of a short period, minus money, and often minus horse, saddle, bridle, clothes, and blankets " then employer, finding that his men would thus go off to drink, himself set up it public house about nine miles off Had Bhephoiils, even if they had intended to go further, were generally " pulled up by this place, and rigidly ud hiring to the bush custom of shouting " soon allowed the greater part of their wages to be turn again, like the rivers, to the place from thence they came All men in the bush out of it her duty are always so opposed to shout,' that is, to treat all those who happen to burn the burnt the BUinotimo" In a few days their money is all spent, and then they return to another spoil of land work and solitude How far our author may be a fair judge of Queensland we cannot pretend to say We should get her, from what he himself admits, that he is not a man who would be likely to succeed in any colony whatever if, however, his account is to be trusted, Queensland has been ub Bhumofully pulled lid may quick meal cure, and has proved a grave, not only to the hopes, but also to the bodies of thousands of hard working Emigrants We can readily be- lieve that a colony which has already attained an unenviable notoriety by his attempt to revive the slave trade should be not unwilling to resort to the most unscrupulous means to entice white cmiginntB also At all events, any one who is tempted to embark for this second Paradise would do well to read our author's statements, and to take some means of to ting their truth 'to turn from these more serious considera- tions to the lighter side of the book, we find plenty of ad venture, and not a few good stones The following one, illustrative of the prevalence of the habit of swearing, is amusing in its way - "When I was teaching the blacksmith's children, then mother mod frequently to be busy among her pots and pans, within hearing of what went on in school.

She was not satisfied until I had explained to her what our present occupation was " The blacksmith's children scarcely made that progress which might have been expected when they had an Oxford man for their tutor But he was not so much answerable for this as the father, who, whether drunk or sober, sadly inter fired with the work of the schoolroom For when he was drunk he acquired the tutors assistance to help him to drink, and when he was sober he required the children's assistance in his smithy to help him to make up for the time he had lost when drinking A good story also is told of two rival doctors, who, when drunk, got into a quarrel One of them in the struggle had his leg broken which the other declined to But The wounded man, however, with the aid of his wife managed to set the limb, and so disappointed his main Drunkenness in Queensland would seem to be rather a recommondation than a disqualification in a medical man "A doctor who did not drum would get very few patients, he would not be able to gain their sympathy Doctors, however, whether drunk or sober, do not seem to flourish in Queensland According to our author, over) man in the bush in his own doctor, and pins his faith to trace infallible romidios-quinine, Holloway's pills, and two ounces of Epsom salts with a pint of water As for a shepherd's life, in which our author spent three of the best years of his life, nothing would seem to be dresser He was often living all alone in a hut some miles away from any other white man, with his solitude broken only once a week by the visit of the overso r with his rations On one occasion, indeed, owing to a continued flood of the river, he was six weeks without seeing a human being We cannot, perhaps give a better idea of the monotony of this part of his life than by stating that he read with positive interest a religious newspaper that was thirteen in mths old At the same time he was in constant an inn lest he should share the fate of some other poor shepherds and be murdered by the blacks On one occasion he was saved by his dog, who woke him up just in time to enable him to anticipate with a nice shot a Biivugo, who with spear and club, was creeping upon him through the long griiBS But more tumble than the black men who after all were only a chance, were (he black spot, which were a certainty The) not only by man in your food, dance between your face and your paper if you are reading, and make the paper itself black, but they poison the slightest sea itch You may have on your hand, crawl into your eyes, ears, nose, and mouth, and, women of all negro vote a peculiar form of eye disease till it be comes some of the most agonising inflictions that can be endured ' 1 excepting that the climate of Queensland is on the whole a fine one, we can see but little to recommend the colony There would seem to be a great scarcity of water, and but little land that admits of cultiva- tion Course mutton and salt beef are cheap enough but utmost even thing else is lory dom the scenes, like that of most parts of Australia, has but little mu lot), and after a few days must become very tedious The following description of travelling in the bush does not at all events reader is very anxious to make trial of it - " Travelling in the bush in Queensland is usually excessive 1) t able work The roads (are dry) tracks winding among the the crew are dry and dust) the race nor) is the name for miles no flowers, no fruit, very little life Nothing but trots, trees, each with three brooches and six leaves on each branch, throwing no Blind except from their trunks, dry waving grass between the trunks, one exactly like the other which stands a few feet oil li on it now and then a kangaroo is to be seen, or an emu, of a flock of parrots , crossing crooks the river here and there by the simple process of going down one bank and up the of her In the middle of the day a suit , dinner, tea, and pipes (Hub only when you are taking it easy) Ilion on again, trees, grass, parrots, do , repeated, until the camping place is reached, horses there unloaded and turned out to wander where they will till morning (is apt to abuse the privilege they are hobbled) , tents, supper, pipes, yarns, and body After four years of hard work and great prive lions in such a country like this, "Oxford George," as our author was called, being assisted by the kindness of friends, managed to return to England The penalty that he has had to pay for the cup) indulgence of his pro nous four years at Oxford upon us to have been unusually heavy ] of us hope that, us his sufferings live certainly helped to adorn a tale, they may also point a moral to other young men who are as careless of the whole of life as they have been of the pleasant summer term that they have just spent in enjoyment at Oxford
