CORRESPONDENCE. THE IATE RACE MEETING. TO TU« ED.TOB OF THE BULLET1 K. Sin,-" Would l)ut mine enemy write a book,' or something to the same purpoit, was wished by somebody fro;* ago ; (.nd so m'glit exclaim , some enemy ot Mr. W. Ruddle-;f behave one. Th's gentleman bas, rn a letter, called public attenii'on to what otherwise would, and should have been a very unimportant matter. Some random shot made by "Nimrod" has lcd Mr. Huddle to attempt to explain bow some friend of his called attention to , tho fact of his dishonoured cheque being in existence, and how afterwards he (Mr. lt.) paid tho amount. But it would have been well if Mr. Huddle bad been candid enough to tell thc public the whole of the matter. He would then have stated that Mr. Buddie's name still stands in tho books of the Club for the amount of £3 12s.-a fact it is outy fair to Çresume that Mr. Ruddie is well aware of. f any remarks by his friends have lcd him to pay off a pori iou of his liability, I hope this i fnenálg hint on my pal t will lead bim TO remit j the balance. By so do:ng ho wili certainly I smooth the way Tor futuro visits to Rockhamp- ton. I must presume that Mr. Ruddle is not fu'ly aware «hat thc amount is still due, but as an old racing man he should know how much ho has paid and how much ho has left unpaid. If not 1 can inform him. I regret to have to notice so unpleasant a . matter, but Mr. Ruddle having b< nsclf called attention to it, I fed bound, ns a mambor of thc old club, to say a word ur on it. In any other place, I have little doubt that strict racing rules would have boen insisted upon, and that before Mr. Ruddie could have entered a horso (much less received the stakes) all debts on tho books of the club muBt bavo been liquidated in full. P id I hope that in future such rules wilt be strictly enforced I here. I am, S¡r, NIMROD'S GHOST. Rockhampton, August 2, 1873.
