GHOS.i'S AND THEIR ORIGIN ( A Sketch ? by A. Jamieson Wbainfobd.)' Much has been said and written on this subject, both true and untrue. 'Tib a com-' mon' arid ancient saying, that ' dead men tell- no tales,' that 'tis the living we .have to fear. But who can prove this assertion' to be'^truer- Proverbial sayings, handea, down -from one generation to. another, are! generally received with the utmost credulity, partly from the firm belief' 'in them ; by our ancestors, and partly from their great ag'e,: and conseqnenti'extreme respectability. Credited by our forefathers, why- should we doubt them? ::.,:?....! ? Most1 ghost Btories originate i in : the, human brain; likewise legends of goblins,', fairy tales, 'etc. These are frequent com panions in the nursery, and very bad com panions' they are. Let those .who cannot understand the feelings of the little folk, shivering ; in their cots* after listening to; some of theabbve1 ghostly narrations— let those,' I 'say, sit up late some wild gusty night, when the wind whistles round the house; rattling the- casements, and moan ing in the chimneys— sit -up late andtell each other -all the weird uncanny tales they can remember or invent ; let them re tire to their separate chambers singly. They will understand then, or if they don't they'ought to. ' ;. !??????: ;,iv/ ;; ? That ? there is occasionally, some f oundn,- . tion for the theory of ghosts,' few iwill attempt to denyv but' that ? 'the 'uncanny' visitants very frequently ? ? derive their supposed existence from the ? fooliah: perpetrators of practical jokes is a fact. ?In: the1 event 'of ^a- locality, or -place of residence ' supposed to' be haunted,! ' a thorough investigation ? : should be made, and if ' possible, any - mystery; connected therewithj '-unravelled; 'This will generally be efficacious. The 'f playing of ghost '?— a common pastime among i' young and: thoughtless: people — is- as - pernicious ' as it is senseless, and highly injurious to the nerves of both youthful' and aged.1 The; extreme mental strain, 'caused! by the sudden appearance of an apparition, has a lasting effect forharm, frequently for life. ' The innate superstitious awe of the super natural inherited by us from our ancestors? has much to do with this.:'- f ..-:'O Tho following anecdote of a : supposed: ghost ift founded upon fact : — A whisper was going the rounds of the village of — - — , — a whisper which afterwards grew into a: bold assertion— that a ghost had been seen somewhere on a lonely road, a quarter of a mile distant ; a road which led to the next village, and which in consequence must be traversed, ghosts or ho ghosts; Several affirmed that they had seen theunwhole-; some visitor, and had been greatly terrified thereby. « However; the descriptive ?? ac counts, differed greatly, except as '.to one particular, to Wit, its enormous height. ?

Dan Burton gave chase and, his long legs giving him the advantage of greater spjeed,, soon overtook the fugitive.

For tunately i in the : foregoing case, '? no great harm was done, but as has been previously ?mentioned, the evil effects of practical jokes are 1 sometimes' lifelong. ' !The follow ing is a vivid illustration of the name. , j .A company of, young people had been ^ spending . an evening in ? telling ? ghost - !stories, and other thrilling narra-' itives of a like Btirring ? ,, nature. As bedtime approached, all confessed . to , feeling rather nervous, with, the exception of one girl.who stoutly maintained that she feared neither their uncanny tales, nor the result they appeared to apprehend. Upon this, certain of the, party laid their heads together, (all in fun) to quail her. high spirit. One of the same, a 'student - of medicine, had in his pbsseBBion. a human skeleton — this was placed in the; young. lady's bed, unknown to her, : where upon all retired for the^ , night. Nbthing occurred to disturb the . rest . of ' of the playful conapirators,!, but^at1 the. morning meal, the victim of the; joke i was'i not. visible. The student, ?; brother of the girl in. question, volunteered'; to knock at her door. Presently, he returned,! 'say- ing he could get no answer. They, forced: the lock : of : the . door ; The girl was sitting up in bed, taking out the skeleton's teeth', and replacing them. She ;waB -a laughing maniac, and never regained! ;herreaso.n. -.'.-. ? : .-?: !

Ireland; clings to the banshee, and many, claim to have heard its melancholy wailings over the lonely heath or moor. ? . . '??'. .'? , ' , It will be found that there are some of 1 every nation possessing firm faith in the power and authenticity of ghosts. Where is there a people entirely incredulous of : the same ? That many of the legends are ? mere fabrications, is beyond doubt— an old castle, . ivy covered and. hoary with age, a well overhung, with trees, and thereby darkly shaded, a fantastical and imagina tive' mind and a ready tongue are all that - needed. But that there is at times a: foundation to uncanny sights and sounds, is a matter 'equally beyond doubt, and in such cases a thorough' investigation should .be made. ??- ;i---?^- ? ... . .; ;?:??:',??
