UNACCOUNTABLE. BY BLUE JACKET. "There are more things in Heaven and Earth, Horatio, than are dreamt of in your philosophy) " Well, that's all the news, I think, Mister South by east's the course, and all the muslin s set ' And the mate departed down the poop ladder, en route for his bunk, leaving me, Peter Williams, second mate, in charge of the middle watch, 12 to 4 and it was to beautiful night, and the Susan Howitt, 1196 tons, was making about six knots, having just picked up a breeze, which we hoped would turn into the S H trades, and thus give us a " leg in " for a 90) days' passage to Calcutta After taking a look at the compass, I started on a pilgrimage round the decks to see that everything was correct, and eventu- all) arrived on the fiVe side, where the look out was piers" up and down Oh! Charlie, a Swede, and a great card in his will), happened to be on duty, and as I passed him 1 tem irked, " Vine 1114ht for ghosts, Charlie," for there was t a sound except the slight noise of the waves under the bows, and in the bright moonlight the capstan, anchor stocks, and bills all stood out clearly on the white decks Charlie looked round with such a scared expression on his face, I laughed, and said I "Surely) you dont believe in bogies, do YOU'' I been shipmates with one, sir " "Come, I say, I knew you were a bit of 11 relic of bygone days, but I never thought you'll been messmates with Vanderdecken What sort of 11 chap was he any how s ' "Its all very well for you young fellows to laugh, sir, but I tell you I seen It ghostly with my own eyes ' 'Well, you must spin me that sum It 11 help pass switch ian!according!},although he required a good deal of pressing, the next time Charlie had the middle watch the ship being by the w met in the trades, and not requiring much attention, I adjourned for ard and squatting on the capstan listened to the following story, in rather broken I big fish - ' 1 shipped in the Marguerite of Karls (rona sir, for voyage to Melbourne, with timber, and a rotten old craft never missed stays Her hull leaked very badly), and all her ropes had been turned end for end, and spliced until there wasn't heard!) a sound fathom in the whole ship However, she sailed very decent, and had a very good passage to instan d \eunha,where we picked up strong westerly winds and started to run our casting down We had a good ten knot j breeze, which gradually) increased, until one night all hands were turned up to take the third reef in the minutes 1 "M) chum has a little chap from Ctelle Mc called him Phnrnoh, because when we used to be wrestling of an evening he would not let his people go, and him and mc was first aloft, and went on to the weather yard unto, him sitting astride on the hard and hanging on to the n either earling the ship was rolling very heavily at the time, and just as the hot sun sang out Haul out to windWard, the rope parted, and I harries fell, and I seen him make quite a Hume in that phosphorus stuff as he struck the water 30ft below are Of course we all came down from aloft but by that time he was miles astern and as there was too heavy a sea running nothing could be done for him and we were sentenced to finish reefing the sail ' Well, we picked up a pilot and came through the Heads-102 dins out-went up the Yarra, and discharged our timber, loaded a general cargo for Mauritius, and cleared out in ten weeks for Port Louis 'there won't nothing particular about that trip, except that a couple of days before getting in we got caught aback with ever) thing set, and all her gear being, as I said, awfully rotten the fore and mizzen topmasts and mum to'g Hunt mnBt was over the side before you could an) 'lines A steamer took US in, and we lit) there months afore we could get new gear, and at last loaded sugar for Melbourne All our original crew had stood by the ship, for a wonder, the reason being, I think, that we was all Swedes, and a more or less family ship, so to speak. " We had bad luck from the start, head winds and strong too, and at last the old man determined to um light down south and pick up these very winds we've got now But luck was against us again, for there weren't no winds , it was all smooth seas and fine weather One night I was at the wheel, and I heard the skipper say to the mate, At this rate well be pretty) close to where that boy Olsen got out last up to morrow night " Next night the wind dropped altogether, and with squared jams we was walking about two knots I was on the look out, Justus I am now, on just such another night bright moonlight when I heard a voice aloft on the foremast Ray, On deck, there I looked up, wondering who on earth was fooling around aloft at that time of night when there wasn't no use for it, when, coming from right where I was looking, 1 heard, ' On deck, there, again, but I couldn't see nobody 1 legged it aft to the mate, and told him He called me a blamed fool for not answering, and came foran! himself Just then On deck, there, was sung out again 'The mate says, 'Hello, there,' and the voice says, ' Stand from under (At sen, when an) thing is being dropped from aloft, the warning is n!wu)scalled out, ' Stand from under ') " ' A), a), says the mate, ' let fall, and the next second being corner s something on deck, right on the main hatch "at) this time, what with all the yelling and being fine weather most of the crew was sleeping on deck all hands was crow(Ted round the hatchway) a looking at the thing I was quite close to it, but I couldn't say what it was like, being in a mortal funk 'He tillite, he sayS, Here, I saw, you on the hatch, w line are you come on board for, an) hour And then, My) God, I believe its Oisena ghost And then he BERTH, ' Did I ever do you uni form'' and the figure made sort of movement which we took to mean ' No. ' And then I axed him, and all the other men " Just then the skipper came up the companion a grow ling at the way the ship was drawing about, and the figure disappeared, and that's all the ) urn, air But I believe Olsen came after the skipper's he, being a part owner of the ship, was responsible for his gear being so bad and causing him to lose his life for the day after we anchored off Sandridge the skipper got three sheets in the wind and went for a drive, and tried to climb a tree with a horse and buggy, and got killed, and-look out, sir, there's the old man on the poop I doubled aft just in time to save getting a jawing us the captain, not hearing any one walking over his head for so long, had come up to see where I was I often used to chaff Charlie about his ghost, until I found it hurt his feelings, he can, try as I would, I never could shake his evidence, as the reporters BU), and he firmly believed he had seen a ghost that night But whether it was that or only from having spun the vam so often since he first in vented it, 1 emit sin, but- what do you ' think, I
