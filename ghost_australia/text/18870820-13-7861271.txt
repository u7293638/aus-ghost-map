V con juror returning from a brilliant campaign could not have been more worthily received At the town hall the General thanked the townspeople for their welcome saying that they had established claims upon him which he could never forget the link between the army and the people was irrefragable For days previously in him the populace had been singing a modified version of the Marseillaise in which Boulanger was "critic has n deliver of his country When Boulanger returns then shall ye conquer With these words ung ing in his ears and the sounds of the favourite Boul mger march while returning, from the rev view the General and ex Minister passed to his new quarters to become once more-for how ion" fresh will see-a private soldier of France These events happening on the eve of the national Jacinth July-caused profound anxiety to the President and the Government in Paris General Boulanger had been ordered to take up his command at this precise moment in order that he might be out of the capital during the celebration of the fete It was thought that his absence would prevent difficulty Unfortunately, the design was discovered to the mob b) M Roche fort an! others And General Boulanger had himself not been able to resist the exhibition of a little pique I ever, asked to breakfast by General 1 error the new Minister of War he ostentatiously declined the Hiv station The fact was duly recorded in the newspapers These incidents had their due weight in the popular leave takings just noted Moreover they increased the popular irritation with the Government, who had thus not only sought to "shunt tits General but had shunted him with undue haste for purposes of their own. The popular on noyance was concentrated upon the President, as being more immediately concerned in removing. Boulanger from the Ministry of War and all sorts of things were threatened when the authorities should make appearance at the review, which is always a leading thing in the celebration of the national fete 1 Hiding what was afloat, the Government did not hesitate to take means to give check to these Schemes. The military authorities, having decided to abolish the regimental bands took occasion to order that no band taking part in the review yesterday should play the Boulanger march For a brief time there was a disposition to keep M Grevy away from Longchamps, on the plea of indisposition, but this would have been a too obvious surrender to the mob, and the idea was abandoned Ministers were, however, in much anxiety on Wednesday night as to the issue of yesterday's events, borne small facts of great significance had come to light for instance, the street bunkers of the little ornaments so popular with the mob on the file day, could find no market for the well known Phrygian cap the bust of the Republic, and tile muna ture of the Bastille On the other hand a roaring trade was done in the cheap pins in 1 ' decorations bearing the figure of General Boulanger since the General left Pins on Friday night more than 200 00) of those small articles had been sent to Clermont 1 errand, Ljoni, Bordeaux I once and I mile and one Paris house alone sold 100 000 to the bankers of the capital latest facts small as they nity appear show the enormous position which General l!oiiltiii(.er has achieved in the popular mind as the representative of the party of revenge The position which General Boulanger has made for himself has further been demonstrated in an unexpected quarter dunn, the truck The new Kouvur Government has been directly assailed by M Boulanger friends in the Chamber The attack on? based ostensibly) upon the fact that the Go- vernment persists! in terms, upon the support of the Light upon the support of the enemies of the I epubhd that is to the preservation of a Republican regime it was pointed out that the Government had utterly failed to censure the authorities of Prittttnj und Normand) who had lately joined in a I pilgrimage to last to pay homage to the Cotillo de Paris and Ministers were likewise by one I for paying too much attention to the new Papal Isniieio, who hospice mortal offence to the Radicals by dealing with same of the Monarchist deputies the leading feature of this debate was a speech by M Clemenceau who is more responsible than any other man for having brought General Boulanger into notoriety One remark which fell from the Radical! leader has produced a great effect in France as indicating that M Clemenceau has now abandoned I the man who has overshadowed him General Boulanger, he declared, had now been sent back to his position in the army, and he must remain there indicating that M Clemenceau has come to the conclusion that the general is a danger to the country and must hereafter not be entrusted with political opportunities The Premier M I officer intervened in the debate to dent witli8omcBhow of indignation that he was governing with the help of the I joists He insisted on having the support of a majority of the republican deputies in the Chamber and failing that he would retire from the conduct of affairs In the division which followed he secured more than this with much Reichstag support, and in consequence his opponents who is 11 chosen their floral of attack with less than the usual skill were badly I eaten 1 his debate was conducted likeable sent contciitiousbiiHincss in the Chamber with an abundance prosperity Andrassy abuse and to mark his sense of the degradation of I arltnmetitarj institutions M I to meet the President sent in his resignation saying that he felt quite unable to cope with the physical necessities of his position. The Chamber, however, unanimously declined to accept the Presidents resignation, and gave Illma vote of confidence, which has enabled him to come back with dignity, having taught the deputies a lesson which they much needed Its influence will be seen, no doubt, but for the moment it may do good The fears in respect of the celebration of the fie yesterday were happily not realised 'The accounts to hand speak of a collision between the Garde de Paris and the people in the neighbourhood of the Louvre in the car part of the day, but give this as the only untoward incident There was the usual demonstration before the statue of Strasburg in the Place de la Concorde, and the review followed in the afternoon The President and Mititsteraattcnded Great precautions had been taken coalfield the President from insult and, lumped), with the best effect At any rate, M Grevy heard nothing more offensive than the cries of the trainers, who found amusement in cheering Boulanger On the other hand, the fact that the President hand, for the that time since his election, to be so carefully guarded in the capital is not a good sign There was much Boulanger music in the evening it the open air bills and elsewhere, but at no time during the day was there any display of hostility to foreigners the state of affairs which has thus sprung up in France naturally) arouses much anxiety throughout Europe It reveals the restless ness of the French people in a new and threatening aspect and induces many capable judges to declare that, with a return of null tar) Strength the Republic will sure the first opportunity of recovering some of its lost prestige. by entering upon a great war It may be noted here that the Government of M Bouvier follows its predecessor in continuing prep rations of a warlike character 1 rue, it is now likely that the scheme for mobilising an array corps for experimental purposes will, after all that has been said of it, be given upon the ground of expense , but on the other hand General Perrin has obtained Parliamentary authority to create certain new era airy regiments, so as to bring up that ann to the strength possessed by Germ n), as well as to continue there organisation of the infantry in the same way. General lesson has successfully contended for making all recruits serve the full term of three years with the colours, thus defeating the committee on the Military Lill, who were anxious to retain the old system, by which a certain proportion of conscripts should be sent back to their homes after serving two years only This last change adds largely to the effectiveness of the army, and it is clear that General Terran, like his immediate predecessor, is bent upon being prepared with a vigorous defence against any attack upon the prairie Unfortunately there is being developed side by side with these preparations a bitter hatred of foreigners among,; the people. The Germans are just now in much reproach throughout France, and it is actually proposed by serious politicians to levy a poll tax on all foreign residents, or a substitute for service in the army which, as aliens, they escape the Berlin correspondent of the 'Times prints a vigorous protest against the attacks which have been made upon German residents in the department of the Nord and elsewhere in view of the celebration of the fete yesterday) the German residents of Paris were requested to close their houses and places of business, and to keep within doors, and upon this advice the North German Gazette, which is inspired by Prince Bismarck, remark is, significant that these warnings "do not seem unwarranted ' Other of the German newspapers go farther, and print poetic eft usions telling France that Germany remains with her hand on the sword hilt, so that we find ourselves all at once transported to the state of affairs which existed for weeks in the early part of the year, when there was dad) talk of war A word, however, must be said for France viz, that the unnecessary harshness of the Stadtholder in the Rhenish provinces and the severe treatment of the Alsatian patriots have goaded her to attempt something like reprisals Of course this is very foolish, but it is also very natural in the circumstances At Leipsic three Alsatians have been tried for treason Klein and his brother in-law Grebert kept the French war office near rated) informed of all the military measures and preparations in the Rhenish provinces of Germany, especially in the fortresses of Metz and Strasburg Klein confessed that he had been in the regular pay of the French since 1886 and Hi tt he had corresponded with the notorious M Schnäbele under an assumed name He Hurd man accused was not connected with any serious intrigues, and was acquitted , but Klein received six years and Grebert five years penal sert tude The trial has had the effect 01 lining the French \Y an Office it as a heavy responsibility for encouraging espionage among German subjects in Alsace Lorraine, and has demon- strated again the generosity of the Imperial Government in releasing Schnabel on a recent occasion In Bulgaria a new turn has been given to live in affairs The Great Sobranje has elected Prince Ferdinand of Saxe Coburg to the throne of the United Provinces in succession to Prince Alexander of Battenberg 'His election was the result of a secret sitting the night, before when it was clearly explained that Prince Alexander found it impossible to return to the country because of the opposition of the Czar and Bismarck ' The nomination of Prince Ferdinand had been expected, since rumours had been in circulation for several days previously that he was the coming man His election was unanimous, and so far the pro KtHsian party have made no hostile sign against him 'The Sobranje has sent a delegate to A Terms to lay their mt nation before the Prince, and to ask him to go immediately to Sophia, on will remember that his name was mentioned as a possible candidate for the throne in the course of last winter, it here he received a travelling delegation 01 Bulgarians at his castle at Lbenthnl The Prince 13 an officer of the Hungarian army, and it is understood that he is personally on very good terms with the Czar It is suggested that he has seek a personal interview with the Emperor Alexander, whom he is prepared to eelieiliatc by making, a Russian mar- riage as well as the more substantial concession III making certain Bimmil officers of rank to take leading positions in the Bulgarian army For these reasons it is thought that Prince 1 Ferdinand has a good chance of succeeding to the vacant throne at ''ode for the moment the lines in press (being without a hint) denounces the Bulgarians for their audacity, and ("declares that Russia will have nothing to say to them until they comply with the Grays conditions, and get rid both of the Government and the 1 agency They fail to see that the acceptance 01 Prince Ferdinand would at once abolish the Regents and it so happened that the election has already resulted in a change of Government M liadosletofl said Colonel ísicolaicft, the Prime Minister and Minister of YY ar respectively have quarrelled 011 different grounds with the Regents brambles" and MutkurolT, and have come to "grief It seems that they had been coquetting with the Prince Bernard of Saxe Yv clear, and had hoped to set him up in opposition to Prince of Ferdinand, who was the candidate of the Regents Being thoroughly defeated 111 the Sobraon, they had no option but to resign office and a Government was formed under the direction of the Chnrtinist leader- Zachary Stefanoff who is notorious for his hatred to I said Happily those internal disputes do not threaten Bonouslj, though it has been suggested that the deposed Yfinisters meditate a coup H et it.
