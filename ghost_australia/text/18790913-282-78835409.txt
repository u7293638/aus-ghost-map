And yet, as 1 have -aid, they lived gaily. They paintid, and admired or orilloieed oaoh other's pictures: they lent and burrowed with eqiul Ireodoni ; they bemoaned their wrongs loudly, and rang and laughed more loudly atill as ihe mood seized them; and any special ill-lortune befalling one of thtir number generallj aroused a display of sympathy which, though it might sot last long, was always a sourcu ol But the American, notwithstanding he had boon in the hoUHO for months had never be como ono- of them.

At this time—jnst as the winter entered with bleak winds and ruins and falls ol powdery enow—there presented liersell among them an arrival whoeo'appearance created a seneation.

Five'of them wore men he had seen before,—artiats'wbo lived in tho llbneo, —bat the sixth was a 'woman whom he'had never seen, ; and whoFe mar vellous beauty held film spell-bound where he stood. She was a woman of twenly-two or ihroe, with an oval fa'oe whose' fairneas wae Ibe lalrness of ivory. She was dark-eyed and low-browod,'and, as she , leaned forward upon the table and looked up at the man who spoke to her, even the bright glow o( the lamp, which burned direolly before hor face, showed rid flaw in either tint' or outline. "Whyehouldwe ask the reason of your return.?" eaid the m?n. "Let ua rejoice that you are here." ; " I will tell jon the reason," she answered, wlthonf lowering her eyes. " I was tired," ." A goad reason," was the'roply. She" pnshod ' her "ohair back and stood upright; her hands' , hung at her sides;;; the men were all looking at her; she" smiled down at Ihem with fall irony.

So it oame about that ono afternoon, a* she oarae out of o studio in whioh 'abe had been- giving l a sit ting, aha found waiting outside for her tlie thinly olad, frail figure of tlie American.

He appeared only rejoioed . and eager. " I felt sure it was yon,", he sUd. "Were you then so buto that I. wonld oome .*" she aaked. "You said you would," he answered. He plaoed her as he wished to paint her, and then sat down to his-work. In a few moments he was completely absorbed in it.. For a long .time he did not speak- at. all.' Tbe utter, silence whiob reigned—-a silence whiob was not only a snspenaion of speooh bnt a suspension of any other thought bo* ynnd bis task—was a new experienco to bor." His cheek flushed, hi? eyes burned dark and. bright; it seemed aa if he soaroely When he turned to look at her . she was conscious euoh time of a sudden thtill of. feeling. More than onoe he paused for several.moments, brush and palette in hand, simply watching her fao*. At ont of theee pu.isoa she herself broke the silence. " Why do you look at mc bo T ' she asked. "Youleeok at mc as il—a's if—" And she broke off with an uneasy little laugh. He'ro.sed.'bim?elf .with a slight start and' ocloured.eensitively, passing his hand aoroas his lorehead. .'.'
