V.R.C. AUTUMN MEETING. [By Telegraph.] fFromonr own ReDorter.l Melbourne, March 12, The third day of the autumn meeting was very close and sultry, still the attendance was fairly good considering the number of people drawn awav bv the cricket match. Svlvauus was the public tancy tor the JNursery iianai cap, but lie was never able to get up to the light weights; Colstoun and 'Vaucluse, the first of the pair giving backers a foretaste of the trouble in store for them. Then came the Newmarket Handicap, and owing to the short time allowed between it and the last lace trainers had great difficulty in getting their horses weighed out in time. In the ring Hyacinth was heavily backed at the last moment by the owner, but the con fidence reposed in Hesperian, Ghost, and Larpent was not weakened. The Ghost was terribly fractious at the post, as -wasTyropean, and they both got off very badly. ? The race, as usual, was most exciting. Totalizator, who was not fancied in consequence of having done badly since arriving in Melbourne, was leading fifty yards from home, but when Hyacinth tackled him he gave way, and Mr. Pearson's horse won a grand race from Euclid and Larpent, the latter of which made his run just too late to be of service. Surrey showed speed, but could not stay. Hesperian could never quite get up. Ghost and Verdure were not dangerous at any part of the race. Mr. Pearson wins over £4,000 on the race, and a lot of books laid the winner, but he was not a good horse for the public. The Town Plate produced a fine field of horses, and the result was another instance of how unlucky are the favourites from Lang's stable. A declaration was made in favour of Pell Mell, but he never got near the front, and Commotion won a fine race from Wellington and Progress. The time was remarkably fast, but as the gong did not sound in this race until the horses had gone 200 yards it was probably incorrect. When the horses returned to weigh Commotion was very coldly received, but Wellington was loudly cheered on Mr. Baldock announcing that it was his last race. Mr. A. K. Finlay has bought him for £1,000 for stud purposes, and he also pays Mr, Baldock £100 a year as long as the horse lives. Solitude was made a great pot for the All- Aged, but she seemed unable to gallop, and Allander won easily, to the great delight of the bookmakers. The Steeplechase was a very fine race, the nine competitors flying their fences beautifully, there being only one mis take made throughout the race. Great Western was thought a moral by Mr. Loughlin's party for the Steeplechase, but he was Deaten by Twilight, who made the pace so merry that she had the big horse dead beaten a mile from home. Lucy ran a great race, and Chrysalis would have done better had Batty not kept her so far behind in the early part of the race. Roebuck ran very badly, being last all the way, and pulling up terribly distressed. Duchess waa backed for pounds, shillings, and pence in the last race, and the way she ran away from her field when Hales let her go shows that the stable had good grounds for fancying her in the last Melbourne Cup. The following is a description of the racing :— SECOND NURSERY HANDICAP. A sweepstakes of 5 sovs. each, h. ft. with 150 added. For two-year-olds. Seven furlongs. Mr. A. K. Finlay*s b.c.

Some time was wasted at the post before Mr. TVatson could get the cavalcade in a line, but when the flag did go down the lot seemed to get away in fair order. As far as could be seen Surrey was the fastest in the early part of the race, and Baron von Mueller and Hesperian also looked well in the centre of the course for half a mile, when Totalizator came to the front, and he led till within 50 yards on the Stand side and Euclid in the centre now madea fine run, and Hyacinth, Euclid, Larpent, and Totalizator passed the Judge's box almost in line, With Hesperian and Cremorne very close up. Hyacinth won by a clear neck, but the Judge was some time in deciding whether Euclid or Larpenfc was second. Totalizator was only a head behind Larpent, and then came Hesperian and Cremorne, closely followed by a batch of about a dozen. Time, 1 min. 16} sec. TOWN PLATE.

At tho sheds Pali Mell, Darebin, Progress, and Wellington Eot on dose terms, but as they came to tho turn tha favourite was beaten, and Commotion drew away again. Coming to the straight Progress, Wel lington, and Uarebin made their effort, but none of them could get on terms with Commotion, who held his own and won easily by two lengths. A grand race for second place between Wellington and Progress ended in favour of the old horse by half a length, and then came Darebin and Bathurst. Time, 3 min. 34 sec ALL-AGED STAKES.

Here Mistaken was beaten, and coming into thc straight Solitude was in trouble. Hales rodo her hard to the finish, but she never had a show with Allander, who won easily by two lengths. Mistaken was a good third. Time, 1 nun. 46i sea STEEPLECHASE. A handicap sweepstake of 10 sovs. each, b. ft, with 300 added.

Great Western and Skylark showed, the way to the first fence, over which they were followed by; Twilight, Lucy, Gazelle, Hieroglyph, Chrysolis, Sissy, and Roebuck, in the order named. Skylark then cleared out and led over the double, with Great Western and Twilight next, and the others in the order given above. No change took ptace until coining to the six fences parallel with the straight, when Twilight supplanted Skylark, and acted as pioneer from Great western, Lucy, and Skylark, with the others following in Indian file, and all fencing grandly. After tha jump following these fences, Twilight stretched out with a commanding lead, and made for the rivoc fence at a cracking pace, with Great Western, Lucy, Gazelle, and Skylark as her nearest attendants, Chrysolis at this time deserting the company of Roebuck, Hieroglyph, and Sissy, and setttai sail in pursuit of the leaders. At the double, Gazelle, who was running second, came down, and left Great Western and Lucy to follow Twilight to the sheds, bat it was evident now that the favourite was tiring, as ho was rapping each successive fence. Two fences from home Chrysolis got on terms with Lucy and Great Western, and she jumped the last fence some six lengths in the rear of Twilight ; but when they landed the last named drew away with the race in hand, though Scobie pulled up at the finish and allowed Chrysolis to get within two lengths. Lucy was third, Great Western fourth, Skylark fifth, Hieroglyph sixth, all close up. Some little distance off came Sissy with Roebuck, who was dead beaten at a mile and a half. Time, 6 min. 52 sec.
