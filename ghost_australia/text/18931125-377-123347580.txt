THE CARCOAR TRAGEDY. Mrs. Phillips, the wife of one of Glassou's victims, and who was nearly done to death by the murderer, has arrived in Sydney. She hovered for days and weeks between life and death, and at one time it was thought the great shooke and the awful wound she received would prove too much for her. The careful nursing end the attention bestowed on her by her Carcoar friends pulled her through, end now she is able to move about. A friend (writes a Sidney correspondent) who has seen her sinoe her arrival in Sydney says she looks very pale -more like a ghost than a human being. Her face is pale and bloodless, and her eyes sanken and lack lustre. It is not tobe wondered at, poor woman. She has had an awful experience, and how she got through it, goodness only koowas. It is thought here that the City Baenk will give her an annuity. Some say thecore poration will be nioe and put her down for Â£800 per annum. It is to be hoped so, for certainly though poor Phillips was unable to defend himself, he did all be could to prevent the bank being robbed, and he lost his life in the defence of the Corporation property.
