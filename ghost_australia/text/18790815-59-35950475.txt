A concert, was giveainfte ereuinff in iSr. 'liver's Btorp. in aid of nm: which proved a financial euccesr. Xbe cpkcer concluded by ? force entitled 'Furnished Department*,' rendered by the Hallett Amateur Dramatic Club. It is only fair to observe that they made an honest attempt at appearing in the character, each ventured to mimic ; but I regret to say that Mr. Trimmer forgot he was nervous with too great a parade at distinctness, and sec all rules of prosody at defiance in endeavoring t'- be original, because distressingly emphatic 'Mr. Windsor talked too flippantly on the tongue, not to speak it profanely and his mal - pronunciation was hardly pardonable. Mr. Ellis in his mono logue looked sfliy rather and spoke bad Latin, bnt upbraided others for murdering the Queen's English. Mr. Smith looked dreamy and bis get up gave him a ghost like appearance. It is with pain I have learned that what re mained of the good things of the day was pro posed to Beset np for aa money consideration. Such a vulgar attempt at making money is to be' deplored to say the least of it ; it shows bad taste, and is not *i all in keeping with those principles of a gentleman, that the pro poses wouidMjave the boldness' to lay claim to. It would be a sorry turning poiut in tea rneet-^ iags if such a pracric«-wa»»untenanced. -lam, Sir,&c;, ? MICE CASStDf.
