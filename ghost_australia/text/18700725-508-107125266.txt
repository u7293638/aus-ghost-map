A Man in a Trance. It is so very seldom that a man dies and comes to life again a snort time afterwards that when a start ling fact similar to this does occur it ie generally worth chronicling. 'It seems,' according to the Colac Observer, 'that a man named Samuel Talbot, a labourer, residing at Colac becoming suddenly indisposed, the servicea of Dr. Kae were called in, and alter the usual medical inspection' the man was ordered to bed, and the doctor departed to obtain the necessary remedies. While away a message was sent to him that Talbot had suddenly shuffled off this mortal coil ; and believing- the statement to be true, though somewhat surprised, he drew out the necesauyeertifioate stetieg the cause of death. The friends of the Bupposed deceased man immediately took the necessary stepa for the funeral, the under taker and the registrar of deaths having been, informed of the mournful event, and no doabt chuckling at the thought that business iri their line was looking up. In the house where Talbot was laid ' straight out upon his bed,' was gathered a number of women, and mourning and lamentation could be heard, the iiisndt weeping for the poor man, and would not be comforted. When lo! Talbot opened his eres, and stared around him with marvellous surprise at the scene which was being enacted in his house. Of course, the women Buremueu, imu covereu uieir laces, lornung fill manner of thoughts about ghosts, and it was after wards found thut Talbot had merely swooned away, and had been in a sort of trance for a number of hours. The undertaker was compelled -to desist making the coffin, the registra. destroyed his certifi oate, and the doctor indulged himself with a hearty good laugh. The joy of the friends can, of course, be.better'imagined than described.'
