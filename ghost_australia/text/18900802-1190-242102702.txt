BIJOU THEATRE. After a week of merriment the laughable comedy of Turned Up is withdrawn, and The Balloon take its place. This comedy takes its title from the fact that a certain Dr. Glynn (Mr. Brough) who believes that he has accidentally poisoned Mrs. Fitzjohn (Miss Romer), the aunt of his intended wife, Grace Wentworth (Miss Emma Temple), and is, besides, persecuted by a far from a romantic widow. Mrs. Rippendale (Mrs. Brough) with whom he has flirted in bygone days, goes off in a balloon, is supposed to have been drowned at sea, and comes back to be greatly fright ened by what he suppose to be the ghost of his victim, and not a little persecuted by a bibulous friend, Aubrey Fitzjohn (Mr. Anson) and the widow aforesaid. This comedy will be preceded by the famous one-act drama of Kerry, in which Mr. Dion Boucicault will play the faithful hero, supported by Mr. Ward, Mr Chichester and Mr. Cathcart with Mrs. Brough and Miss Pattie Browne. * * *
