A TRICK WITH SUGAR. Get some lumps of sugar and dip them for just a moment into a weak collodion solution, such as photographers use. Then expose them to the air for a few days, so that all the ether in the mixture will evaporate, leaving only the thin envelope of collodion behind. Now give your friends at the table some lumps of this sugar for their tea. They will drop them into their cups, and, to their con sternation, the lumps will rise to the surface in a few moments, re fusing to be coaxed down again with taps of the teaspoons. The secret is that the real sagar is melted and only the envelope of collodion remains which, filled the interstices of the lumps. Being much, lighter than was the sugar, this 'ghost' of the lump float on top of the tea. The illusion to the eye is .perfect; but if the spectral lump is taken up between the fingers a slight pressure will des troy its form and leave only a gelatinous mass.
