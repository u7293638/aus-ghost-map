Poetry. BROKEN HEARTS. Pale ghosts of a passionate past come thronging, The feverish folly, the fierce embrace, The vague unrest and the ceaseless longing, The last wild kiss on an upturned face ; Of a heart that cried, and that broke in crying, Of bitter sorrow and blinding tears, When hope lay dead and when love lay dying, And all the folly of bygone years. But now how we smile at the fond love token— And laugh at the sweet words whispered low, We, whose hearts have been broken, broken, Broken ever so long ago. Wild hearts that beat in this great sad city, That sorrow in vain for a lost delight ; Ah ! yet we hear, with a wondering pity, The stifled sob in the lone, dark night. Would ye were even as we are—sorrow Should strike its hardest, but never again Would the sad heart break for a hopeless morrow, Or the face grow weary and white from pain. Oh, calm, like gods, on a world of woe— We, whose hearts have been broken, broken, Broken ever so long ago. At the merry feast, in the light talk after, In dreamy maze of the sensuous valse, Does ever a sob break through the laughter ? Does ever a jarring note ring false ? Who carries their burden of life so lightly ? Who dons so gayly the jester's guise ? Who laughs so loudly as we, who nightly Look laughing back into laughing eyes ? Drink deep, laugh loud, and dance for a token, Your hearts are merry, and none will know That the merry hearts have been broken, broken, Broken ever so long ago. For clash to the merry bells a-ringing, Drowning the sobs and the passionate cry. Ah ! Yet hearken owhile to their sweet, sad singing, Who live and suffer, and laugh and die. But let never a pitying word be spoken, Or a tear be shed, we would have it to, For us whose hearts have been broken, broken, Broken ever so long ago. —London Hawk.
