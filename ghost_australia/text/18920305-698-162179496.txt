This occurs twice in tho year — about March 21, the vernaL equinox iu England, and September 22, the autumnal equiuox. (This, of course', is the reverse iu Australia.) The equi noctial points move backwards about 50 seconds yearly, requiring 25,000 years to accomplish a complete revolution. Tliis is called the precession of the equinoxes, which is said to have been ob served by the ancient astronomers. E. J. D. asks : — 1.

(Eriua). — Conundrums aud puzzles of any sort are not legitimate subjects of investigation, as they are not of public interest, and require too much time aud trouble to aualyse. However, as you arc desirous of ascertaining the solution of the one you quote, which is apparently too much for you, some of our readers may be able to furnish the solution. The question is there fore given : — ' Is there a possibility of kill ing 30 sheep in 15 days and to kill an odd number ou each of the 15 days ? By an odd number you, of course, will understand is meant 1, 3, 5, and 7, &c.; Decidedly, if they are to be killed at that rate of progression, the thing is impossible ; but the question evidently means just an odd number of sheep on each day. Even assuming that, at a cursory inspection' it would appear that it canuot ue aone. However, some or our readers may furnish a solution. M. W. (Bland). — There are several recipes for makuig grape wine, but they are too leugtliy t » be given here, aud it would be best for you t j obtain a book on winemakuig, especially if you want it for commercial purposes. Seud to Mr. ' Maddock, bookseller, George-street. However, the following is a simple recipe for making gra^e wine, 'which may suit your purpose— Put 201b. of ripe, fresh picked, and well selected grapes into :i ? ' stone jar. and pour upon them six quarts boiliug water. When the water has cooled enough, squeeze the grapes well with the hand : cover the jar with a cloth, and let it stand for three days ; then press out the juice, and add 101b. crushed sugar. After it has stood for a week, scum, strain, and bottle it, corking loosely. When the fermcnta iion -is complete, strain it again, and bottle— it, corking tiglftly. Lay the bottles on their side iu a - cool place. F. J. K. (Maugeline).— Re your inquiry respecting the cost of Boring for Water in yonr district, the Canadian pole rig complete, to bore to 2000ft., would cost about £900, to which would require to be added supplementary expenses as per pages 23 to 26 of ' Mayes' Australian Builders' Price Book for 1891 Send to Mr. Maddock, bookseller, George- street, for the work- which will explain the whole affair to you and give you prices. The total cost of plaut, engine, &c.;, &c.;,in fact the outlay without wages, is reckoned at £2000. The author of the book, Mr. Mayes, is one of the boring contractors of the Water Conservation Department, and his calculations are likely to be not far out. As to the probability of the occurrence of artesian water in the Collariudibri district, you should send to Mr. J. W, Boultbee, officer in charge of the Water Conservation Department, 217 Macquarie -street, and ask him to forward you a copy of his report on ' Artesian Boring.' On page 8 you will find the matter exhaustively dealt with. M. J. W. — If the diameter of No. 1 log is 13in. the circumference or ' girt ' is 3'4ft. The quarter girt is 3*4 divided by 4. The square of this is 115G divided by 1600, which multiplied by 28 (the length) gives 20*23 cubic ft. or 20{ cubic ft. „ nearly. If the diameter of No. 2 log is ICiii. the circumference or 'girt' is 4*2 nearly. The quarter girt is therefore 4'2 divided by 4. The square of this is 1761 divided by 1600, which multiplied by 18i't. Gin. (the length) gives 20-01 cubic ft. or 20 cubic- ft. The rule to fiud the volume of l'ouud or uusquared timber is to 11 multiply the square of the uicau quarter girt by the leugrh, and take the product for the volume.' It will be found that this rule gives a less result than the rule for calculating a right circular cylinder, but the rule was probably constructed with the design of making some allow ance for the loss of timber which occurs when the .p'ese is reduced by squaring in the ordinary way. If the piece of timber be not a circular cyliuder, ' the result by this rule will be nearer the truth. Purchase Todhunter's 'Mensuration for Begin ners' from Mr. Maddock, bookseller, George street. Wybung (Noraville). — There are illustrations of Abyssinian tube wells in a descriptive catalogue issued by Messrs. John Danks and Sou, limited, of 391 Bjurke -street, Melbourne, Victoria, aud 3G3 Pitt- street, Sydney, New South Wales. The description of the pumps is too lengthy to be quoted here ; but the firm will be most happy to furnish you with au illustrated catalogue (which is bound) and which contains illustratious and de scriptions of a great variety of hydraulic machinery, and also useful hydraulic information. Should' any further information re the Abyssinian wells be required, the firm state that they will only be too pleased to reply to any letters. The following is an extract from the descr.ption : „ — 'A No. G Abyssinian pump complete costs about £5 5s, and when a man gets handy at put ting them down 15s or £1 will-cover the expense of driving them. Certainly no . one ought to be without a good supply of water in his paddocks iu summer when he can bring it up from a depth of 30ft. for, say, £6 10s. Most of the waterholes one sees are so filthy and impure in summer that it is enough to poison the milk, and to bring disease on aud poison the blood of the animals who drink it. If animals have foiil water, we must expect fluke and pleuro. My cattle will not go even to water holes supplied from springs when they cau get the pure water in the troughs ; aud they drink vastly more of the pure water thau they would of the impure.' Inquirer (Bega).— Common asbestos is worth from 40s to 50a per ton in England. The finer kinds, silky iu lustre and fit to spin and weave, are worth £40 per ton. The common sort is used for engine packing and various other purposes ; the finer kinds are used for weaving into cloth. It will not be found that asbestos improves in sinking like metals, as it is one of the constituents of the rock in which it occurs. If you will send down a sample of your asbestos to Mr. S. S. Vale, assayer, No. 20 Castlereagli-street, he will inform you as to its value. Asbestos or 'Asbestus' (from a Greek word mean ing ' uuconsumable ') is a variety of the amphibole or hornblende family of minerals, aud akiu to treuiolite, actiuolite, and common hornblende. The chemical composition of the whole family is chiefly silica, magnesia, alumina, aud ferrous oxide, but varies consider ably. Those containing mo3t iron are most easily fused. Asbestos consists of fine crys talline, clastic fibres, with a silky lustre, valyiug in colour from white to grey or green, and derives its liame from being specially indestructible by fire. A single fibre of it fuses to a white enamel, but in the mass it is capable of resisting ordinary flame, and has on this account been regarded from ancient times as a most in-* teresting substance. Woven into cloth it foltus a fireproof texture, which, to be purified, requires only to be thrown ill the fife; gloves, napery towels, handkerchiefs, atid even dresses, have beeu woven of it ; and it is said that the ailcients tlsed to wrap the bodies of the dead iu asbestos cloth to keep their ashes separate from those of the surrounding wood pile. Amianthus is the rarest aud mo&t; delicate kind, its fibres being beautifully white, flexible, long, and regularly laid. Common asbestos is not so light, either iu colour or weight, as amianthus, aud is more splin tery, inflexible, and irregular in structure. It fuses with difficulty before the blowpipe into a black scoria. Mountain Leather aud Mountain Cork are other varieties, where the fibres are less flexible and regular than in either of the above. Their colour is brown, or a dirty white. Mountain Leather is in thiu flexible sheets, aud Mouutain Gork is so named from not being unlike common cork, and so light as to swim on water. Mountain Wood is a soft, tough, opaque, brownish ? coloured variety of asbestos, much heavier thau the last, and melting to a black slag before tho blowpipe. J. L.
