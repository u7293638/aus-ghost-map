MUSIC AT THE EXHIBITION, j SPECIAL, ORCHESTRAL CONCERT. The concert hall on Saturday afternoon was crowded in all parts. The programme was an exceptional one, being composed entirely of the works of that remarkable Frenchman Berlioz. The chief attraction was the Symphonie Fantastique (" Episode in the Life of an Artist") written when the composer, who was at the time a pupil at the Paris Conservatoire, was under the influence of a strong passion for the English actress Miss Smithson, Although this was the first performance of this extraordinary work at these concerts, it was not altogether a novelty, having been heard under different circumstances in the Town-hall a few months since I here is in it no room for doubt as to the composer's intentions, as a full programme of the design of each movement is prefixed to the printed score Whether this is altogether an advantage is open to dispute The first three movements, considered as obstruct music only, are so full of beauty and poetry that the studying of the programme to find out the composer's exact intention is apt to detract from the effect of the music produced by them. The following is a brief outline of the story A young musician, of a highly nervous and imaginative temperament, whilst under the influence of a disappointment in love, poisons himself with opium , the dose IS insufficient to prove fatal, but causes a prolonged sleep full of most fantastic dreams The first movement disentitled "Reveries and Passion," and depicts melancholy, frantic love, jealousy, anguish, and despair, here the alec fire, which is associated with the beloved one throughout the work, though subjected to various changes, in first heard, 'the second movement, "In the Ballroom,' in most fascinating and the third, " in the 1 leads, ' is perhaps the finest in the work. It portrays a beautiful summer evenings walk The shepherds are heard signalling with their pipes the rustling sounds of nature breathe peace and quietude, which is, however, disturbed by the appearance of the lady's image which brings with it fear and distrust The sky has grown black and clouded, distant thunder is heard, and then there is an ominous silence This movement may be said partly to recall 111 spirit, though not otherwise, the lovely andante from Beethoven's Pastoral Sim phony Having in his dream killed the beloved one, and been condemned to death, the next two movements must be described as horribly fantastic. The one is "The March to the guillotine and the other " The Witches' Revel most wild 111 conception, in which, after the swift fall of the axe, witches, ghosts, and fiendish appear flock to the funeral Here the beloved one's motif again appears but to use Ber hen's own phrase in a " blackguarded ' condition, its grace and nobility have dis- appeared 'The tolling of funeral bells, a burlesque of " Dies Irae," and a double fugue bring this extraordinary work to an end. It is difficult to overcome the natural feeling of aversion to the subject of the last two move ment, though it is impossible to deny the marvellous power of treatment The portrayal of the bloodthirsty, delirious passion here depicted through the medium of music, whilst it may suit some more d constitutions ia repellent to the ordinary well regulated mind Of the performance we cannot speak too highly This is the most elaborate and difficult music that has 3 el been produced here, or perhaps is ever likely to be The performance may be summed up in one word magnificent The conductor's reading w is masterly in the extreme, and the members of the largely augmented orchestra even surpassed themselves Hearty congratula- tion is due to Mr F H Cowen and the orchestra, with its talented leader, Mr G Weston Special mention should also be made of Mr Morton, who, with the cor anglers, had a very important part to play in the third movement 'the other number on the programme was the overture to the " Carnaval Romain, which has been heard once before This is one of two overtures to the opera " Benvenuto Cellini," the other one bearing the name of the drama 'the principal theme is taken from the carnival scene in the second act It is one of Berlioz, s most captivating compost tions, abound ing in melody and gorgeous in orchestration It is generally played as an entr'acte We cannot do better than close this notice with the following extract from the pen of Mr E Dannreuther -" He stands alone-a colonies with few friends and no direct followers, a marked individuality, original, puissant bizarre, violently one sided, whose influence has been and will again be felt far and wide for good and for land, but cannot rear disciples nor form a school Ilia startling originality rests upon a physical and mental organisation very different from and in some respects superior to that of other eminent masters, a most ardent nervous temperament, a gorgeous imagination incessantly active, heated at times to the verge of mammy , un abnor molly subtle and acute sense of hearing, the keenest intellect of a dissecting, analysing turn, the most violent will, manifesting itself in a spirit of enterprise and daring equalled only by in tenacity of purpose and indefatigable perseverance ' Such was Hector Berlioz, who was born III 1 rence, near Grenoble, on December 11, 1863 and died in Paris on March 9,1809
