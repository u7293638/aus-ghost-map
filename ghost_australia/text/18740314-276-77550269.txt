Such is justice -in Victoria.'- !!i''' ','i'r,.-rr f A great number of our representatives in Parliament are either deaf mutes or obstruc- tionists, who only keep good men out of their places. Mr. McBain of the Wimmera, for instance, in so far as progression, is concerned, might as well be in the Siam Parliament as in the Victorian one; and Mr. McPherson, of Dundas, sits watching for such crumbs as may fall from the Ministerial table. Such men as these should stay at home and legislate for their sheep. ,.
