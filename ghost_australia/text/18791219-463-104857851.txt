POETRY. * AI0NE WITH CONSCIENCE. I Mt alone with my conscience, In a pUoe where fime bad ceased, And we talked of my f onner living In the lan& where the yean increased. And I felt I should have to aaewer The question It pat to me. And to face the answer and question ; Tbroughont'an eternity. Tbe ghosts of forgotten actions Came floating before my sight, And tilings that I thought were dead things 7 ? ' Were ahv« with a terrible might And the vision of all my past li£» Was an awful, thing to face — Alone with my conscience sitting In that solemnly silent place. And I thought of a far-away warning, Of a sorrow that was to be mine, In a land that then was the future, Bat now is the present time. And I thought of my former thinking, Of the judgment day to be, Bat sitting oloae with my conscience Seemed Judgment enough for me ; And X wondered if there was a future To this land beyond the grave ; Bnt no one gave me an answer, And no one came to save. Then I felt that the future was present, And the present would never go by. For it was but the thought of my ;.«ast life Grown into eternity. Then I woke from my timely dreaming, And the vision passed away, *Jtid I knew tiie far-away warning Was a warning of yesterday. And I pray I tnay not forget it. In this land before the grave, . That I may not cry in the future, And no one come to save. And so I have learnt a lesson, Which I ought to have known before, And which, though I learnt it by dreaming, I hope to forget no more. So I sit alone with my conscience, In the place where the years increase, And I try to remember the future In the land where time will cease. And I know the Culture judgment, How dreadful soever it be, That to stt alone with my conscience Will be judgment enough for me.
