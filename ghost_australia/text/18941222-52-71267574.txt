Kisses and- Kissing* The -word " Maa " is Anglo-Saxon, j and may indeed be taken as an in- stance bf bow pléasant Anglo-Saxon can be. The philologist assures us that it" is allied to tbe Gothic " kustus," à proof or test, and to the Latin "gustus," a taste, which suggests the old saying, that "the proof of the pudding is in the preein' o't." That same Gothic " kustus " comes from the verb "ldusan," to choose, from .wbicb one -would imagine that among the Gotbs kissing went by favor. According to Professor Skeat, writ- ing with all the .austerity and scholar- ship of an expert, a kiss is " a gust, a taste, a something choice." Rowena, the beautiful daughter of ÏEengist, thé Saxon, is credited with having introduced kissing into Great Britain ; but had the natives been so utterly unenlightened, the "Romans could scarcely have failed to anticipate her.

Most of these benighted mor ' tais haye not got beyond the low stage of rubbing noses together. Eissing points to ancient discredited , belief in a veritable union of spirits a belief common to all the Aryan people that tbe breath of a man was his soul, his spirit. " Spirit" is " breath," and " ghost " is a "gust "-which possibly accounts for the cold air which ÍB said ío accompany apparitions.
