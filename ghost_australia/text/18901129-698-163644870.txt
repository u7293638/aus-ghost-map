lIlH&lflllsSf; Cricket Gossip. The costinuation of the match between the Belvideres and Warwicks resulted in another day's fielding for the latter, and, as there is onl/ another afternoon for the match, the probability is that they will not have a chance to open their first innings. The Belvi deres simply batted as long as they liked, and when time was called tht score stood at 497 for the !oss of seven wickets. It is worth noting that with die excep tion of Aitken's 0, the lowest score so far is 28, while four of the bats have passed 50, and two the century. Moses made 165, the result of two days' play, and his score stands as the biggest of the season so far. It is apparent that the senior club representatives will have some wonderful batting averages this season, but with so many hundreds knocked up against a weak team like the Warwicks, they will be of very little value. Looking at tne early stage of the game between the University and C&rlton; representative?, it is evident that they did as well as might be expected in meeting with a defeat by eight wickets. It will be remembered that they had only five batsmen available in the first innings, and in the second had to face a deficit of 70 runs. Their second innings was practically a failure, for in spite of the 30 contributed by Lee, and double figures from Barbour, Jones, and Allen, the total reached was only 91, and once more the team was in complete. The Carltons required only 19 runs in the second innings to score a win, but Ormiston was run out and Downee bowled before they were secured. Dowses bowled very well, securing eight wickets for 49 runs, and Garrett took four at the email cost of 24. It looks very much as if the Orientals would win their match against the Sydaeys on the, first innings. They have scored 233 to their opponents' 215, and it is doubtful if the Sydneys will have any time left for their second innings. Cottam batted in splendid form for 69, and his hitting was worth looking at. Clark alse put up a fine total of 62, but the innings neverthe less showed a large number of bare epofe. no lower than four of the batsmen failing to score. Wales was in very good form behind the wickets last Saturday, and unless our selection committee can seo Deane at practice, the chances are all in favour of Wales being included in the intercolonial team Pierce did not cone off with the ball os. Saturday) securing only two of the Oriental wickets for 77 runs* Bruce played a beautiful innings last Saturday -ui ue half of Melbourne against Carlton. Going in first he rattled the bowling about in a very lively manner, playing some splendid cuts and bringing his score up to 154 before he was bowled. M 'II wraith made 71 in the same innings, and at the call of time there were only seven wickete down for 401 runs. Boyle is back hi the cricket field again, and on Satur day he took his place with East Melbourne against Fitzroy. Thr veteran did a little mild bowling, but he has not yet batted. Tr»tt has lost no time in getting himself into form again after his sea trip in anticipation of the intercolo nial match between New South Wales and Victoria. On Saturday he scored 23 not-out for South Melbourne against St. Kilda, but his bowling was not up to the mark, one wicket costing him Zt runs. In the pennant match between Port Melbourne and North Melbourne, E. Bean, bowling for the latter, took seven wickets for 11 runs. He sent down only 79 balls, including eight maiden overs. For the Ports O'Hara took five wickets for 46 runs, and Testro four fcr 29. There was some interesting cricket on the Adelaide Oval on Saturday. Hindmarsh beat North Adelaide by seven wickets. North Adelaide in their second innings made 62. Hindmarsh in' their second innings scored 96 for three wickets. A. H. Jar vis made 51. The match South Adelaide versus Adelaide was con tinued. Adelaide in their second innings had lost seven wickets for 56. Hiscock and Magarey, the not-out men, took the score te 217, when the innings was de clared closed. Magarey scored 100 and Hiscock 62, both net out. The Souths won with three wickets down J. Reedman made 113. The Public Schools Athletic Association have deter mined to offer a challenge trophy for competition amongst the cricket clubs of tho various Public schools daring the present season. Entries close with the hon. secretary, Mr, W. F. M'Manamey, on the 29th instant Some short time bacK v*» cites our Moama ana Echuca correspondent) it appeared as if cricket was about to give up the ghost in this district. Moama, however, made a start, and a club was then forceed in Echuca East by a number of old enthusiasts. A challenge was givea and accepted for a match on Wednesday afternoon, 19th in stant, in the park. There was a good attendance of the public, the weather being fine. P.
