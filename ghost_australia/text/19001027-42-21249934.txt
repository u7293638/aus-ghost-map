STORYTELLER. THE IRON-HEARTED CITY. CHAPTER X. By E. PHILLIPS OPPENHEIM, Author of "Mysterious Mr. Sabin." There followed a time then when the black waters of nethermost London closed over Douglas's head. He struggled and fought to the lest gasp, but in the end the great stream carried hkn away on her bosoon, nnd •ivica scarcely a sdb he watched 0.11 thosa (wonderful1 rose-coloured dreatm? of his fade away into empty spatoe. He was part of the floteam and jetsam of life. ,No one ■would have the work of his brains, and his unskilled •hands failed to earn anything for him save a few dry crusts. Mo had made desperate efforts to win a hearing. Whilst Ills few pence lasted- and his ink-pot was full lie wrote several short Htorios, and leit them ihere and there at the offices of vari ous .magazines. 'He 'had1 no permanent ad dress ; he could call for the reply, he said. •And so lie did, till his coat 'burst, at the seams, and his iboots gave out. Then he gave it up in ■despair. It was his work that was wrong, 'he 'told hiimself. What had seemed well enough to him amongst the Cumberland hills was crude and amateurish .here. He was a fool ever to.'have reckoned ; himself a writer. 'It was the " OPbex" which had imlsled him. He cursed the "Ibex," its editor, and all connected with it. That was at the time .when he.had sunk lowest, when it seemed to him who, only a few days ago, had looked out upon life, a marvellous' panorama of life ana colour, and things beautiful, that death, after, all, was the one thing to be desired. Yet he carried 'himself bravely through those evil days. Every morning Jbe stripped and swam in the Serpentine, stiff enough often after «i night spent out of doors, but ever with that vigorous ■desire for per sonal 'Cleanliness which never left him even, at the.worst. As Boon as his clothes fell Into rags about him he presented the strange appearance of a tramp whose face and hands wore spotless, and who carried himself even till towards.the end with a sort of easy grace, as though he were indeed only mas querading. But there came a time when the luck of the loafer went against him. From .morning to night he tramped the streets, willing to work even till his back was broken, but unable to earn a copper. .The >gnawings of hunger roused something of the wild beast* in him. A fierce light -burned in his eyes, his thin lips, curled into hard, stern lines. He loitered about. the Strand,'and the crowds of theatre-goers in their evening dresses, .borne backwards and forwards in cabs and carriages, and crowd ing the pavements also, stirred in him a clow, passionate anger. The bitter In equalities of life, its flagrant and rank in justices, he seemed for the-'flrst time) to wholly realise. A Banquo amongst the gay stream of people who brushed lightly against him every moment. He lost for the time that admirable gift of sympathetic interest In his follows which had once been his chief trait. His outlook upon life was changed. To the world which had misused him so he showed an altered front. He scowled at the .men, and kept his face turned from the wo men. What had they done, these people, that they should be well dressed and merry, whilst the aching in his bones grew to maj ness, and hunger gnawed at his life strings. One night, with twitching fingers and face drawn white with pain, he turned away from the crowded streets towards Westminster, sanlt into a seat, and picking up the half of a newspaper read the smug little account of a Journalist who 'had spent a few hours, a day perhaps, in the slums. As he read he laughed softly to himself, and then clutch ing the paper in his hands he walked away to the embankment, up Northumberland avenue, and into the' Strand. After a few Inquiries he found the .offices of the news paper, and marched boldly inside. A vast speculation, the enterprise of a millionaire, the "Daily Courier," though it sold for a halfpenny, was housed in a palace. In a Gothic chamber, like the hall of a chapel, hung with electric lights and filled with a, crowd of workers and loungers, Douglas stood clutching the fragment of newspaper still in his hand, looking around for some one to address himself to—a strange figure in his rags, wan, starving, but something of peirsonal distinction still clinging to him. A boy looked over a mahogany partition at him and opened a trap window. " Well 1" he asked sharply. "Do you want papers to sell ? This is the wrong entrance for that, you know." " I want to see some one in authority," Douglas said, " the sub-editor if possible." It was a democratic undertaking, this newspaper, with its vast circulation and mighty staff, and visitors of all sorts dail> crossed its threshold, fi'et this man's coat hung about him in tatters, and his /boots were almost soleless. The boy hesitated. "What business ?" he asked curtly. " I will explain it —to him—in a moment," Douglas answered. "Ifhe is busy, one of the staff will do. lamin no hurry. I can wait." The boy closed the trapdoor and with drew. In a few minutes a yqurig- man, .smartly dressed, with sparse moustache and a pince-nez, came out of a door opposite to Douglas. " Want to see me ?" he Inquired tersely. " I'm an assistant editor." Douglas held out the fragment of paper. " I've just read that," he said. " Picked it up on a seat." The man glanced at it and nodded. " Well ?" " It's badly done," Douglas said bluntly. " The man's only sat down on the outside of the thing and sketched. It isn't real. It couldn't be. No one can write of starva tion who merely sees it written in the faces of other people. No one can write of the homeless who is playing at vagabondage." The assistant editor looked his visitor up and down, and nodded quietly. " Well ?" If this sort of thing i,? likely to interest your readers," Douglp.s said, " give me pen and papor and I will.write of the thing as it is. lam homeless, and starvinp. The loneliness thnt your man writes of so pret tily I will set down in black and white. Man, I am starving now, and I 'will write It clown so that every one who reads shall understand. I have slept under arches an.l on spnts. I have lain (Irearnins with the rain beating in~my.face, and I have seen strange things down in the underneath life where hell Ib. Give me a chance, ,and I will set down "these things for you," as no one has ever set them down before." Douglas gave a little lurch, swayed, and recovered himself with an effort. . The sub editor looked at him with Interest. " Do you drink ?" he asked quietly. " No,".Douglas answered. " I'm faint for want of food, that's all. Give mo pen and ink, and if you can use . what I write, pay me for it. You don't stand to lose anything, and I'm, I'm " The subredltor took a small piece of gold from his pocket and interrupted him; "That's all right," he said. "We'll see what you can dp any way. But you must have something to eat first. Let me give you this on account —now go straight away and get a feed and a glass of ' wine. I'll have a room ready for you when you get back." Douglas drew a little breath." His fingers closed upon the piece of gold. There was a glare in his eyes.which was almost wolfish. He had dared to let his thoughts rest for a moment upon food. He, who was fighting the last grim fight against starvation.. He spoke in a whisper, for his voice was almost gone. "How do you know that I shall come back •■?" "I am content to risk it," the .sub-editor answered, • smiling. . " Gome back in an hour's time.and ask for Mr. Rawlinson." , Douglas staggered out .speechless. There was a sob sticking in his throat and a mist of tears before his eyes.". CHAPTER XI. At midnight a man sat writing at a desk in a corner of a great room full of hanging lights, a hive of industry. All around him was the clicking of typewriters, the monotonous dictation of reporters, the tinkling of telephone bells. When they had set him down here they had asked him whether the noises -would, disturb him, but he onljfsmiled grimly. They .brought him pen and paper, and a box of cigarettes— which he ignored. - Then, they .left him alone, and no saund in the great room was more constant than the scratching of his pen across the paper. As the first page fluttered from his fin gers he bent for a moment his head, and his pen was held in nerveless fingers. Since he had come to London, sanguine, buoyant, light-hearted, this was the first time he had written a line for whitih he expected payment. The irony of it -was born in upon, him with swift, unresisting agony. This was the first fruit of his brain, this passionate rending aside of the curtain, which hung like a shroud before, the grim" horrors of that seething lower world of misery. In his earlier work there had been a "certain delicate fanclfulness, an airy grace of diction and description, a very curious heritage of a man brought up in the narrowest of lines, where .every in fluence had "been a constraint. There was nothing of that in the words which were leaping now hot from his heart. Yet he knew very well that he was writing as a man inspired. .... i • , That was his only pause. Midnight struck, 1 and 2 o'clock; 'but his pen only flew the faster. Many curious glances were cast upon him, the man. .in rags, with the burning eyes, who wrote as though possessed by some_inexorcisable demon. At last Rawlinson came softly to his side and took up a handful of the wet sheets. He was smoking a cigarette, for his own la bours were nearly over, but as he read it burned out between his fingers. He beckoned to another man, and silently passed him some of the sheets. They drew a little on one side. " Wonderful," the other man whispered in a tone of rare enthusiasm. "Who on earth is he 1" ■■•.•• IRawlinson ehook his head. • "No idea. He came here like that— nearly fainted before my eyes—wanted to -write something in (Austin's line—looking as though he could do it, too. I gave, him balf-a-sovereign to. get something to eat and told him to come back. There he's been ever since—nearly three hours. What a study for one of those lurid sketch* es of Forbes's as he. sits now." • " I never read anything like it," the new comer said. " He's a magnificent find. How on earth did a man who can do work like that get into such a state 1" Rawlinson shrugged his shoulders. " Who can tell ? Not drink, I should say. Laziness perhaps, or ill-luck. I only know that to-night he has written his way on to the staff of this-paper." The other man was watching Douglas as though fascinated. "He has written his 'way into greater things," he murmured. "It makes one feel like a hackneyed ' penny-a-liner' * to read work like that." '' " He's about done up," Rawlinson said. " Do you think" I ought to stop him ?" "Not likely. If there's such a thing, in the world as inspiration, he's got it now.' Don't miss a line. Let him write till' he faints, but have some one watch him and, give him a stiff whisky and soda directly he stops." ' .': '■ " I shall" stay myself," Rawlinson said. "It's an off-day to-morrow anyhow.- Come and have a drink." c " ." From.behind and below came the roar of machinery, rolls of wet proofs came flooding into the room at every moment. Now and then a hansom set down a belated reporter, who passed swiftly in to his work, taking off his coat as he went. Outside the spar rows began to chirp, dawn lightened the sky and strange gleams of light stole into the vast room. Then suddenly from Douglas's desk came a sound. Rawlinson rushed up too late to save him. Douglas had swayed for a moment, and then fallen over sideways. He lay upon the ground a huddled heap, white and motion less. They laid him flat upon his back, undid his 'clothing, and sent for a doctor. A window a few yards away was thrown up, and a rush of cold, fresh, air streamed into the room. But, for all they could do, Dou glas never moved, and his face was like the face cf a dead man. Rawlinson stood up, horribly anxious, and gave way to the doctor, who felt his heart, and looked grave. For an hour the peudulum swung backwards and forwards between life and death. Tben the doctor stood up with a sigh of relief. " He'll do now," he said, " but it was a narrow squeak." . ' " Exhaustion ?" Rawlinson asked. ; " Starvation," the doctor answere.l grim ly. ' " The man k#.s been sober all his life, and a careful liver, or he would be dead now. What are you going to do with him? It'll take him a day or two to pull round.1' " Whatever you advise," Rawlinson an swered. ..'.." "Has he any money ?" "You can treat him as fhough he were a millionaire," Rawlinson answered. " Give him every chance. The ' Daily Courier' pays cheerfully." They moved him into y?e private ward of a great hospital, where patients with com plicated disorders and bottomless purses were sometimes treated, but where never before a man had come suffering from star vation. Everything that science and care "ful nursing could do was done for him, and in a few days he astonished them all by sitting up in bed suddenly and demand lug to know what had happened. He lis tened without emotion, he heard the gener ous message from the " Daily Courier" which, a month ago, would have set every pulse in his body tingling with excitement, without comment. He grew rapidly strong er,-but side by side with his physical Jm-, provement came a curious mental lassitude, a weariness of mind which made him con tent to lie and watch.the housetops and the clouds with nev«r a desire to move or to step back once more into life. The old en thusiasms seemed chilled out of him. They showed him his work in print, told him that he had stirred millions of his fellow-crea tures as nothing of the sort had ever done before, that everywhere people were talking of him and his wonderful work. He only smiled faintly and looked once ntore at the clouds. They left paper and pens upon his table. He looked at them without interest/ and they remained untouched. Rawlinson called himself daily to inquire, and one day the doctor sent for him. "Your "protege Is physically all right now," he said. "He is suffering simply from shock. I should, say that he had a fearful time struggling before he went down, and it will be a matter of time before he's himself again." " All right," Rawlinson said. - "Do all you can for him." / " I was going to'suggest," the doctor said, " that one of us puts it delicately to* him that he's a considerable expense to .you. It needs something like that to stir him up. He could put on his hat and walk out of the place to-morrow if he liked." • "Not for the world,'.' Rawlinson answered promptly. "If he was costing us" fifty guineas a week instead of ten,'we should be-perfectly satisfied;. Let him stay till he feels like moving. Then we'll send him to the sea if he'll go." The doctor- laughed. "You're great. people, i?aw.linson," he said. " Not many philanthropists liko you." " It's not philanthropy," the sub- editor answered. "If you asked me to put into £ c. d. what those articles were .worth to us, I couldn't tell you. i?ut I can tell you this- We've paid thousands down more than once for an advertisement which wasn't worth foal* so much as 'tihose few sheets of manu script. We've 'an endless purse, but there s a short supply of what we want to buy—ori ginality. If we come across it, we don t let it go easily, I can tell you." So Douglas was left undistunbed. Then one morning he woke to find his room a bower of roses—roses whose perfiume .and beauty took his breath away. The nurse (who had tended a Prince) .said she haa neyer seen' anything like them before. (Douglas looked at 'them for a while fascin ated, stooped down and bathed his face in the blossoms. 'When he spoke there was a | change. One sense at least was revived in him—his love for things beautiful. ..." Where did they come from ?". he asked. The nurse smiled. . - .,,• " A lady left-them, yesterday," .ehe saiu. "She drove up and stayed 'for. some time ■with t)he doctor. 1 believe tnat she Is com "oouglas m"ade y'no remark. Only the nurse smiled as she -noticed -him linger at little over tiis dressing, and look for the first time., with interest at the clothes whtoh hud been sent in for him. Towards mid-day he grew restless. Early in the afternoon there was a soft tap a)t the door. " May I come in ?" The nurse opened the door. There wae a rupstlo of draperies, and to Douglas it seemed as though the room f. ere suddenly full of wonderful colour. A new life flowed in his veins. It was Emily de Reuss who came Wwardtrhim with outstretched hands. OKAPTE'R X'll. At first he scarcely recognised her.^He hud seen her last in furs, to-day she seemed I'ike a deltaate dream of springtime. She wore a whfte, spotless muslin gown, -whose exquisite simplicity <had -been the triumph of a French artist. 'Her hat, large and drocWng, was a vision of pink roses ana soft cSmy lace. There was a dainty-eug- JSfiS SfioSur' about her throat-only the Sight seemed to discover whei]i she •moved, the 'faint glinting green Ibeneath the transparent folds of "her gown. She came over "to Douglas with out stretched hands, and he was bewildered, for she had not smiled upon him like this once during that long journey to London. "So it is I who have had to come to you," she exclaimed, taking his h~ands in hers. " May I sit down and talk for a little while 1 lam so glad—every one is glad—.that you are better." He laughed a little oddly. • " Every one ? Why, I could count on the fingers of one hand the people with whom I have spoken since I came to London." She nodded. " Yes," she said ; " but to-day you could not count in an hoar the people who know you. You. are very fortunate. You have made a wonderful start. You have got over all your difficulties so easily." "So easily ?" Ho smiled again, and then shuddered. She looked into his face, and she too felt like shuddering. " You do not know," he said. "No one will ever know what it is like—to go under —to be saved as it were by a miracle." " You suffered, I know," she murmured, " but you gained a wonderful experience." " You do not understand," he said In a Iqw tone. "No one will ever understand." "You could have saved yourself so much," she said regretfully, "if you Tiad "kept your promise to come and see me." " I could not," he answered. " I lost your addre33. It went into the Thames .with -rysr- ——-—^ —- .^ v •- pn 'did'eoijji Itjib very night I reached Lon don. '. But for that I should have come and befege§; from you." ' V S^ou would have '-'made me famous," she answOT^d^laughing. •" I should have claim ed the meffTof 'discovering you." ' He looked puzzled. "Of course you know," she said, " how every one has been reading those wonderful articles of yours in the 'Courier.? You are very fortunate. You have made a re putation at one sitting." He shook his head. :. " A fleeting one, I am afraid. I can under stand those articles seeming lifelike; You see, I wrote them almost literally with my .blood. It was my last effort. I wag starv ing, poisoned with horrors, sick to death of the brutality of life." "Things had gone so hardly-with you, then ?" she murmured. He nodded. "From the first. I came to London as an adventurer, it is true. I knew no one, and I had no money. But the editor o£ the "Ibex" had written me kindly, had ac cepted a story, and asked for more. Yet, when I went to see him, he seemed to have forgotten or repented. He would not give me a hearing. Even the story he had ac cepted he told me he could not use for a long time—and I was .relying upon the money for that.. That was the beginning of my ill-luck, and afterwards it. nev<ar < left me." ."-■.. She sat for a moment with, a look in her deep, soft eyes which he could not understand? Afterwards he thought of it, and wondered; It passed.away very soon, and she bent towards him With her face full of sympathy. - '<' ' "It. has left you now,'-' she said softly, " and for ever. . Do you know, I have come to take you fora drive. The doctor says that it will do you good." With a curious sense of unreality he fol lowed her downstairs, and .took the vacant seat in her victoria. It was all so much like* a dream, like one of those wonderful visions which had come to him at times in the days of his homeless wanderings. Surely it was an illusion. The luxurious carriage, 'the great horses, with their silver-mounted har ness, the servants in their smart liveries', and above all, this beautiful woman who leaned back at his side, watching him often with a sort oV gentle curiosity. At lirat he sat still, quite dazed, his senses a little numbed, the feeling of unreality so strong upon him that he was almost tongue-tied. But . presently the life of the streets awakened him. It was all- so fascinating and so beautiful. They were in a part of London of which he had seen little-^-and that little from the gutters. To-day in the bril liant sunshine,' in clothes better than any he had ever worn „before, and side by t;ide with a woman whom every one seemed honoured to kno\v,_he looked upon it with different eyes. They drove along Bond street at a snail's pace, stopped lor a lew minutes at one of the smaller galleries, where she took him in to see a won..lGrful Russian picture about which every one was talking. Fancying that ho looked LireU sue insisted upon tea, and they stopped at some curious little rooms, ana sat tutfcihor at a tiny table drinking ttu. with .-.liced lemons, and eating strawbarries tuui us ho had never seen before. Then on., afrun 10 the park, where they pulled up unuei- the trees, and she waved constantly away tiie friends who would have surrounded L« car riage. One or two would not be denied, and to all of them she introduced Jeason— the young writer^-they had seen that won derful work of his in-the "Daily Courifl"' of course ? He -took no" part in any i-oii- , versation more" than he could help, leaning hack among the cushions with the wins* lace of her parasol close to his cheek, watch ing the faces of the men &ad; women who .streamed by, and the great banks o£ rhododendrons dimly seen ; lower down. through the waving green trees. The mur mur of pleasant conversation fell constantly upon his ears—surely that other world was. part of an evil dream, a relic of his delirium. Heaven and hell could never exist so close together. But by-and-bye when they drove [off she herself brought the truth home to him. . " : " Do you know," she said, " this afternoon I have had an idea. Some day I hope so much that it may come true. Do you mind if I tell it you ? It concerns yourself." '■• Tell me, of course," he said. " You have written so wonderfully of that terrible world beneath—that world whoso burden-we would all give so much to lighten. You have written, so vividly, that every one knows that you yourself have been theie. Presently—not now, of course —but some day, I would have you write of life a3 we see it about us to-day, of the world Beautiful ; and I would" have you illustrate it _as one who has lived in it, drunk of its joys, ever, as one of its happiest children. Think wliat a -wealth of great experience must lie be tween the two extremes ! It is what you would wish for —you, to whom the study of your fellow-creatures is the chosen pursuit of life." He smiled at her thoughtfully. "I do not know," he replied, " but I should think yery few in this world are ever per,- v mitted to pass behind both canopies. -To me it seems impossible that I should have ceased so suddenly to be a denizen of the „ one, and even more impossible that I should ever have caught a glimpse of the othei\" "You will not always say so," she mur mured. " You have everything in your favour now —youth, strength, experience, and reputation." " Even then," he answered, " I doubt whether I still possess'the capacity for.hap piness^ I feel at times as though what had gone before had frozen the blood in my veins." " Your ifriende," she said, "must make up to you for the past. Forgebfulness Is sometimes hardly won, Ibut it Is never aa Impossibility." " iMy Sriends ! My dear lady, 1 never had one in this world." ?he raised her parasol* Her wonderful eyes sought his, her delicately-gloved hand rested for a moment lightly on ihis palm. " And what am I ?" she asked softly. He was only human, and his heart beat the faster for that gentle touch and thp gleam in her eyes. £he was so beautrful', co unlike any other woman with whom he had ever spoken. " Have I any right to 'call you any friend?" be faltered. " ttave you any right," she ans'W«*e<i ■brightly, " to call me anything else I" ■."'7'.l. wofi'der. what makes you so kind to file ?" he Bald. ■ " I liked you from the moment you jump ed into a railway carriage," she replied, '? la (hose' ridiculous clothes; and with, a ■ tface like a ghost.

The ■ .interlude was over. He must go back to ''•>nlB brooding land-of negatives. ■ "It-has been very kind of you to come ..and see me, and to take me out," he said. 'She interrupted the words of farewell jwhich were upon his lips. > '•:•■• "Our'little jaunt is not over yet," she. , remarked, smiling. •• We are going to •* • itave dinner together—you and I alone ; and afterwards I will show you that even a town '■ house^can sometimes boast of a pleasant ! garden. You needn't look at your clothes. -We shall be alone, and you will be very .welcome as you are." They passed in together, and Douglas was -Inclined .to wonder more than ever whether this were not a dream. - Only that his imagination could never have revealed any thing like, this to him. Outside the hall porter's office was a great silver bowl, ■ sprinkled all over with the # afternoon's cards and notes. A footman' with pow • dered hair admitted them, another moved •respectfully 'before 'them, and threw open 4.he door of the room Jo which Emily de •B.euss led him. 'He had only a mixed im • pression of pale ami beautiful statuary drooping flowers with strange perfumes >: and the distant rippling of water ; then he ■found hiniself in a tiny octagonal chamber draped in yellow and white—a woman's dan, cosy, dainty, cool. She made him sit in an easy chair, which seemed to sink be low him almost to ihe ground, and moved Uer3olf to a little writing table. " There is just one message I must send," fine said; " to a stupid house where I am half expected to dine. It will not take a minute." He sat still,-listening mechanically to the sound of her pen scratching across the paper. - A tiny dachshund jumped into his lap, and with a little snort of content curled itself up to sleep. He let his hand wander over its sleek satin coat—the touch or anything seemed to Inspire him with a more complete confidence as to the perma nent and material nature of his surround ings. Meanwhile Emily de Reuss wrote her excuses to a duchess—a dinner party of three weeks' standing—knowing all the . while that she was guilty of,an unpardon able social offence. She sealed her. letter / and touched a bell by her side. . Then she 'came over to him. \- "Now I hrii free," she announced, " for a ■•■;, whole evening. IHow delightful. -What shall we do ?- I am ordering dinner at 8." . Would .you like to look at my Books or play follliaiVls, or sit "here and talk ■?. Thg garden I am going to leave till.afterwards.

The room wae ecclesias tical in shape and architecture, fluted pil lars supported an oak-ibeamed ceiling, and Ht Its upper end was a small organ. But it was its colour scheme 'which was so wonder ful. The great 'cases which came out in wings iuto the room were white. Every thing 'was white—the rugs,'the raised-fres coes on the walls, the chairs and hangings. IShe watched his 'face, and assumed an apologetic -attitude. "It is unusual—and umratfitional, I know," she said, "tout I wanted something •different, and mine is essentially a modern. .library. In this country there is 60 much • to depress one, and one's surroundings after. 'all count for much.

He shook Sback the hair from his head, and forgot that !ha had ever been ill, that he had ever buffered, that he had evei' despaired. For {the love of books was in his Wood, and his .{tongue was loosened. 'For the first time )in Ills life he knew the full delight of a isyiripatfietic listener.
