. - , THE HYING iMONIC. Twb inohlts, thirsting' for truth v and' 'grace, arid shut' up in1 one' 'narrow and almost naked 1 cell, decorated only by a-> rough table; on 'which . were placed tho sculptured image of the Saviour On the cross/ arid ait the foot of the1 cross a real skull from a human body,'' as a daily memorial, of that' awful sentence of death which : God's justice demanded of irian;' when all' communion was broken off by sin. ' ) 1 On the pale and fleshless browof' the skull was written' the divine verdict, "Dust thou Art; and unto dust shalt'thou return." Over the crucifix, hanging on the naked wall, there: was a skilful - copy of the Madonna Rafaello; and on the top of the fraine/'with diabolical perversity of application' to the'Yifgin Mary, there was this inscription—' ' Let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of "grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to" help in time of need." (Heb. iv. 16.) , ' A few books on divinity and ecclesiastical history ; a bedstead in the form of a coffin, and a straw palliasse within it, on which was lying a young but dying monk, in the last' stage of consumption ; — such was the finished picture of that monastic cell. ' ' ' " The victim of the wages of sin was 'possessed- of a noble and intelligent mind; Naturally; lie was kind, sincere, and iipriglit;; of -gentle manners, of superior education, and still simple aud- humble as a 'little child. "'For a1 year lie had been sinking day by day," arid his last hour was hastily approaching. Blameless concerning the moral and spiritual' discipline ' of the- con vent ; zealous as Paul in keeping the ecclesias tical ordinances, foremost in will- worship;" and voluntary humility, and punishing the body, he' was often exhibited by the Superior as a'model; of holiness to the young clergy. The people used to trust with confidence in liis fprayersj; (his mediatorial prayers !) and the' learned; divines saw in Father Egidio a future and; eloquent propagator of the faith of their holy mother, the Roman Catholic Church. Ho was; but twenty-two years of age. : 7 It was on the noon of the 20tli June, 18467 that the monk appointed by the Superior to attend 011 the patients among the monks of the' convent, in(C 0, of the order of St. Francis (in the States of Sardinia), called out hastily at' the door of my cell, saying, " Father Egidio is' dying. A copious effusion" of -the "'lungs' will1 send liiininto the other world. 1 Oh, he will' riot' be touched ; even by one flame - of the 'fire of1 purgatory. "No ! he has always been/so gooda' -folloiver of our most holy patriarch) St. "Francis; -Make haste; 'please, reverend ' father, !you 'are' justdn time to1 give him the holy absolution.
