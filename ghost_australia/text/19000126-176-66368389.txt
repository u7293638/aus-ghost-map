Federal Electorates. NEXT to the war, the little matter of Federation takes up the interest of the people, and the dear old Herald comes out with a leader on the advisability of divid ing thc colony into electorates, because it would be a liad thing for the populous centres to domi nate the tone of the entire bunch of representatives from our colony. Such a result would natui ally fol low the electing our representa tives by the colony as one electo rate, and the result would be that the country districts would be unrepresented, inasmuch as no candidate would have a ghost o£a show who dared to tell the Sydney people anything about the* evils of centralisation, and the unjus tices under which the country labors at the expense of the city. All this is sound argument, and it applies with equal truth totfee Senatorial Elections, can we hope to have the Herald on the side of the country when the time comes for the Parliament to niake its own electoral arrangements. Clause 7 empowers the Federal Parliament to divide the various States up into districts if it is con sidered advisable, and the country^ 4istricts shbuld see'that sîiëh ià done unless they are willing tp allow the Sydney and Newcastle people tojelect Senators for the entire colony.
