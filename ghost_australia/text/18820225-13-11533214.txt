SATURDAY, FEBRUARY 23, 18-, Attempts are made from time to time in the columns of the radical press, to misrepresent the nature of the relations existing between the Constitutional party and the O'Loghlen Administration What purpose it is hoped to secure by the deliberate. falsification of well known facts we d ) not known it do we eva to inquire W a think it advisable, however, in view of the loose and erroneous statements under my nous quarters during the recent election for Boroon dam, to set- forth the real position of affairs An our attitude towards the existing Ministry has, been in nearly all respects identical with that of the Constitution alists general!), it is only necessary to refer to what we and both before and after Sir By ANN O Lot uri v formed his Cabinet in order to show that while, willing to give the Premier and his colleagues a fair trial, we were very far from regarding h in as lea ter of the Constitutional party Before Sir BRYAN was commissioned to form an Administration, we pointed out that after four years of ceaseless agitation, whereby distrust had been engendered and material progress stayed, the great want of the community was an assured person of peace to secure this, a strong and able Government was necessary, and we doubted the ability of the member for West Bourke a to him which an Administration Events proved that we were right in our opinion All the p came out members of the Constitutional party declined to act under Sir BmA\» leadership, and he was compelled to seek colleagues amongst gentlemen who certainly did not occupy the front a tank in political life When the list of the new Cabinet was published we did not hesitate to express our disappointment at the way in which a great opportunity had been misuse I We pointed out that when the new Premier found that the leading u of the party which joined with him in ousting the Berry Ministry did not feel themselves at liberty to join him, he should have returned his commission to HIS Ever II. No. . hands instead of placing himself at the held of a ' scratch team ' With the exception of Mr GAUhsOr,, to whom on public grounds we strongly objected, we had nothing to say againt the new men personally we remarked that they were mostly new to office, and had their spurs to win in administrators, but we expressed our determination to give them fair play Immediately after the Misses elections were over, we in iced on record our views with regard to the position of the Ministry, and the relation in which it stood to the Constitutional party We interpreted the verdict of the country to mean that the new Government was accepted, not on account of its merit'', but as a deliverance from Berryism - 1 The return of the Ministers must have been owing in a great measure to the slip port accorded- by the Constitutionalists and it is hardly necessary to say that in giving it they simply subordinated their personal fed ings to what they considered to be the requirements of the situation They felt that anything would be better than a return at the Berry regime and ft o feel person ed that they were right Here we have the extent of the all ance between the O O'Loghlen Cabinet and the Constitutionalists definitely stated, and it certainly cannot be termed very intimate So far from adopt- ing Sir But of O Loi. III IV and his colleagues as representatives of the party, the Constit tionalists merely accepted them, then, as the lesser of two evils On the same occasion we renewed the promise of fair play a d generous treatment to which we have already alluded in the following words He (Sir Bryan is of course, deserving of a fair trial, and if he loyally adheres to the policy announced which we are told provides for peace prosperity and progress we have no doubt that the Constitutionalists will see that he has an opportunity of developing it. The programme put before the country has much to commend it to public a favour and if the departmental administration be only pure and vigorous, some tools may be accomplished J This, we submit, was a fair beef 4 mJ the conditions of which there was no thing dishonourable to either side We stipulated for peace and good government and promised in return a loyal support against factious opposition / In accordance with that understand ing the Constitutionalists generally has supported the O'Loghlen Cabinet again its opponents They have judged it j its measures and its administrative acts and although it would be absurd to pj tend that all of them have been aW criticism, there have been none it would justify dismissal On the wlp the bills tabled, and the proposal submitted to the Legislature have the in accordance with the requirements the country, and there can hold doubt that Sir BRYAN OLonp has personally greatly raised his; a public estimation by the second ability he has displayed in the copy of Parliamentary business It true that comparatively little was stated last session, but the depression observable between the time owed find the results produced unit attributable to Ministerial shor-OJiigS-i but to the intrigues and objective tactics of persistent office seeker If Sir BE it, and his colleague had proved less efficient than the have shown themselves to be, they who still have had claims upon the forbearance of the Constitutionalists, who to far as we are concerned, could pt s < ignored They have carefully -"freely from all acts and utterances WT to excite class pensions, and set the community by the ears. Aft what we have experienced at the junks of Mr rams and ha Eagleson a » ' merit which would, if necessary, cover a multitude of sins. The administration of the departments has been reasonably vigorous, and except in one case, viz., the Railway department, there is hardly any cause for complaint which may not be ascribed to allowable differences of opinion on the points involved. Mr. BENT certainly has been guilty of many follies, but these may be mostly attributed to the excessive zeal of an un- trained man attempting to regulate a complicated machine by means of an imperfectly organised staff. Patronage, on the whole, has been judiciously dispensed with a view to the public service, and offenders have been called to account with commendable promptitude. In short, we may say that in the Ministerial proceedings an earnest desire is traceable to administer affairs honestly and in the interests of the entire community. While this is the case, Constitu- tionalists can well afford to overlook minor defects and errors. They have not coalesced and formed a party for the purpose of scrambling with their opponents for the spoils of office, but for the maintenance of law and order, equal justice, and righteous rule. So long as these desiderata are secured, it is, or ought to be, a matter of perfect indifference to them who sits on the Treasury bench. We hear, a good deal nowadays about the necessity of substituting a coalition for the present Cabinet. We see no objection to the formation of such a combination when it becomes necessary, but while Sir BRYAN O'LoiiiiLiäN and his colleagues continue as they Lave begun, it appears to us that their dismissal would be an act of pure faction. We are not responsible for their existence as a Ministry, nor are we under any party obligation to endorse these proposals. We simply judge them from day to day on their merits, and we say advisedly that in our opinion they have not yet done anything worthy of political death. In commenting recently on the dia guatingparticularswhtchhad been brought to light by an inspection of the piggeries in the Sandhurst district, we intimated that vi of had our misgivings concerning the state of affairs elsewhere An examination of the piggeries around Melbourne has shown that our suspicions were not altogether groundless We are happy to say that in all the establishments where pig breeding a regular occupation, as also where pigs are left for short periods awaiting conversion into hams and bacon, the arrangements were found to be of a satisfactory nature The animals are kept in well constructed styes, and are nourished on eatable food But before reaching the level of the Sandhurst abominations, We come upon other pig yards where the fattening process is carried on by means of substances which, in our opinion, should not enter into the composition of animals intended for human consumption We read of p 0s kept in boiling down establishments, where the food supply "is principally unsaleable meat, purchased from the 1 metropolitan and suburban butchers, " which has been first boiled down and " the tallow extracted The meat is used with a small quantity of bran and pollard, and so consumed A good deal of tin. unsaleable mott consists of "'trimmings,' ' which may be perfectly sweet and good, but a considerable quantity, especially in summer time, i putrid, and more or less decent posed But bad as this method of feeding pigs may be, it is clean and holes me compared with that which ob t una alBiaybiookand Fisherman's Bend, at which latter place the Emerald hill and Windridge abattoirs are situated At these places pigs wallow in filth, seize greedily on putrid li. tra, tear and devour the wisest and most worthless of the 1 oil it and freely drink a horrible mix sure of blood and garbage Nothing more sickening in its way has come under our notice Weaiotold that none of these pigs are slaughtered on the place Instead of doing this the proprietor limits them off in lots to the Melbourne mar gin for they are in splendid condition vdience the) pass probably into the hands of ham and bacon curers butchers and others and finally into consumption as the best í tar fed bacon Appetising thought The most disgraceful part of the matter is that these filthy practices have been going on, if not with the commission, at least with the com nuance of the municipal authorities, who constitute the local boards of health borne penalty ought to be provided for its flagrant neglect of duty We called attention on Thursday to the cowardly attack which had been made on Mr JAMES SMITH on the eve of his departure for Europe, in connexion with an article contributed by him to The M ;ii. in August last on the authorship of Sin Ksw Ann's plays The reply to our animadversions is to the effect that the book on which the charge of plagiarism is founded only came into the hands of Mr SMITH'S accusers twenty four hours before the accusation was published We think we may be excused if we accept this explanation with considerable hesitation and reserve We have already pointed out that the circumstances surrounding the publication of the charge against Mr. SMITH are sufficiently suspicious to throw doubt on the motives and good faith of his ac camera andtheoxplanationnowvouohsafcd is not likely to remove the feeling of disgust so generally excited by the contemptible conduct of the accusing journal Indeed, if the story now told may be accepted as true, it must increase rather than diminish the indignation of every fair dealing man at the petty and malignant spirit which, according to their own confession, actuated Mr SMITH a accusers The eagerness with which this gross imputation on the literary honesty of a fellow jour n dist must have been welcomed and adopted, and the indecent haste with which it was rushed into print-well wowing that the accused would be unable to an swer it with equal promptitude are skin is dications of the spiteful and unscrupulous. nature of the attack it - would have been too much to expect, perhaps that the accusation should have been said c over to a more convenient season that, in the peculiar circumstances of the cost, a charitable view should have been V " of the supposed plagiarism, and the sporting pressman allowed to enjoy his holiday in peace Such magnanimity is said to be expected in the quarter worn which the attack came where the chance of abusing a " conservative " journalist is too toothsome a morsel to be resisted But even at twenty-four hours' notice it would not have been difficult, nor the desire existed, to give Mr SMITH an opportunity of defending Briseis There is a chivalrous custom in the BOUBO of Commons which is also Practised we believe, in our own Parliament by the better class of members 55\. JJ declares that private notice should be given to a political opponent when an unexpected attack is to be made upon him, so that he may DO ready to his place to meet it In we ordinary course of journalistic con every such a procedure may not be necessary, but when it was known that Mr, Sung left on a very- eve of his departure, the first impulse of a generous antagonist should have been to give him notice of the in tended attack That the accusing journal has been shaped into the suggestion that the public should suspend its judgment until Mr SMITH has been heard in reply is a sufficient proof of an uneasy consciousness that a wrong has been done So far as Mr SMITH is concerned, the appeal for forbearance is wholly unnecessary for the public could not do otherwise than suspend its judgment on the flimsy evidence which has been placed before it On one point, however, judgment will not be suspended In condemnation of the ungenerous manner in which the charge has been brought forward, public opinion he. already been emphatically pronounced We learn by cable this morning that the negotiations which have been proceeding for some time between Great Britain and France for a renewal or revision of the commercial treaty between the two countries have been finally abandoned The French Government now proposes to allow the existing treaty to remain in operation until the 15th May next after which England will be placed amongst the " most favoured nations in the French commercial arrangements Colonial produce imported into France will however be subjected to the general French army" The minimum rate of discount at the L ml of England has been reduced to 5 per cent and that of the llankoflranceto4 percent Onthe30thollast month when the financial crisis was at it. he. lit in France and the settlements on both the Paris Bourse and the Tudor 1 a charge were unsatisfactory the rates were increased to 5 per cent at the Bank of Eng land and to 9 per cent at the Bank of France His Excellency the Governor has returned to town after a brief visit to the it western district accompanied by the Marchioness of Normanby His Excellency left Colac yesterday afternoon by special tram and reached Melbourne at about 7 pm During his late visit to Sydney the Commissioner of Customs devoted considerable attention to the subject of the storage of explosives there With regard to dynamite he found that only a small quantity is kept in a hulk and that the great bulk is stored in small detached and inexpensive wooden buildings on an island in the harbour these buildings stand on the surface rock and if the dynamite in them were exploded little damage would be done Mr Graves was favour ably impressed with the arrangement and will probably recommend the Cabinet to adopt a similar plan here Although an island may not be obtainable there are several spots where dynamite stores would be equally safe As to the explosive powder there is a great difference between the arrangements of the two ports In Sydney the powder is under the control of the Government from the time it leaves the ship until it is issued to the merchants in quantities the maximum of which is prescribed by the act In the meantime the powder is stored in stone magazines on two different islands On one of these islands, Spectacle Island the Government powder is kept and on the other that belonging to private persons Spectacle Island however is not considered a safe place and the magazine at present there is to be moved to a spot on the Parramatta mer In this colony most of the powder is kept in a i rivate hulk and the Government have no supervision over it there is a costly Government powder mat line at 1 Footscray but it is very little used Mr Graves thinks it would be better if the Government here had control over the powder to the same extent as in Sydney. The first of the recent seizures by the Customs department of goods belonging to Chinese and allow ed to have been smuggled was made a month ago and as the law declares that goods seized under such circumstances and not claimed within a mouth may be for felted and as no application relative to the _ particular goods has been made to the department they will probably be worse fed to-day These goods were seized on pre he-. occupied it is supposed by him Kum Lee in Little Bourke street, and their value is about £3 000 Before Mr Graves left for Sydney be ordered that the Customs department should give delivery of no (goods from China unless they had been thoroughly inspected by means of an overhaul of every case In consequence of this order the goods in question were subjected to a close scrutiny On the day before Mr Graves left for Sydney two merchants applied to him for power to amend the manifest so far as these goods were concerned on the ground that come of the cases were entered as on turning goods either free or subject to a low duty whereas they were really highly dutiable Mr Graves declined to grant the request believing that in attempt to commit fraud had been made Subsequent examination of several of the cases in the consignments proved that they had been wrongly entered and that while they were represented to have contained Chinese products classed as merchandise and on which there is little if any duty the) really contained cigars tobacco and such goods A here to-day are improperly entered in a manifest the department may proceed against the ship or against the consignee But as to most of these smuggled goods from China the difficulty is to know who the owners really are the cases bear Chinese names on them but the Chinese are diffident about giving information as to the names The seizures have created a great scare amongst the Chinese implicated in the frauds, and this has partly conduced to the recent numerous seizures of smuggled goods in the country districts It seems that as soon as it was known that the Customs department were on the alert smuggled goods were sent from Melbourne to various places in the country These goods are gradually being gathered in by the Customs department A wrong impression seems to have prevailed as to the goods brought by the Borneo, which was lately wrecked while on a voyage from Europe to Sydney. It was believed by many that her cargo consisted principally of pianos and cement but it seems that it is a highly dutiable cargo, comprising nt r alta, CG cases general merchandise 100 cases beer five cases miscellaneous merchandise, 17 cases cigars 15 cases liqueurs 14 cases glassware 20 cases farm here and 12 cases pianos A Customs officer will be despatched to the wreck which was bought by Messrs W B Jones and 'Son of this city Yesterday a telegram was received stating, that the vessel had disappeared which probably means that she has broken up TI of Railway department has been requested by some of the inhabitants of Haw- thorn and Kew to promote as far as possible an increase in the number of omnibuses plying between the two boroughs from the Hawthorn station This request will be speedily dealt with Yesterday the Railway department de Bpatched water trains from Talbot to Cope Cope Sandhurst to Inglewood, and Shepparton to Numurkah The first two trains are to proceed on to Donald and Wedderburn and Korong Vale and will be supplied with the water from the Talbot and Sandhurst reservoirs At Shepparton the water is obtained from the Goulburn River Each truck is fitted up with three tanks containing 400 gallons each Of course the size of the trains is adjusted to the demand for water in the places to which they are sent Some instances of flagrant deception have been reported to the Water Supply depart in ear. Several Chinese gardeners when called upon by the collectors for the payment of their rates, protested that they had previously satisfied all claims on that account, as could be proved by receipts in their possession The officer demanded an inspection of the documents, and discovered that some person had victimised the holders by falsely representing that they were authorised to receive the money. The discharges given to the Chinese were very clumsily prepared, the usual printed form being copied in Roman characters with ordinary writing ink, and the name of the payees and the amounts were set forth in the handwriting of the receiver The police have been informed of the frauds, and they have been instructed to, if possible detect the offenders A Chinese gardener at Cranswick is to be prosecuted for fraudulently obtaining a supply of water from a Yan Yean main A meter was attached to the service pipe leading to his premises, but the gangers were surprised that the consumption of water was not so great as was to be expected by the owner of a garden The place was watched and one night the accused was observed to disconnect the meter in order to allow the water to pass through the pipes without any registration A few minutes later it was discovered that by this means the whole of the garden was being irrigated An information has been sworn against the occupier, who will be presented for their Reports have been received from other portions of the metropolitan district of similar practices, and in every case where the offender is known he will be prosecuted We have been requested to correct some misstatements which obtained currency during the contest for the Boroondara election, and more particularly on the polling day Mr Walker, after the numbers were declared, stated that himself and his supporters had had to contend against the Government As a matter of fact the Government took no part in the election one way or other Their intervention was not asked for by either candidate and they did not interfere The only member of the Ministry whose name ison theBoroondararoltvoted for Mr Walker As regards the action of the Catholics, we are informed by gentlemen in a position to speak with accuracy that the great majority of that denomination abstained from voting" altogether On the other hand, at least 40 Roman Catholic electors of good standing whose names can be given, polled their votes for Mr Walker They state that they could have found reasonable grounds if they had chosen to seek them for withholding their sup port but they set their personal and depart national feelings aside with the sole object of securing the return of the Constitutional candidate The Roman Catholic voters were under no directions how they should exercise the franchise beyond being advised in some cases if they could not decide as to whom they found least objectionable to refrain from voting These statements we reproduce as they have been given to us, without com- putting ourselves to approval or disapproval as to the course which was pursued Arrangements are being made with the contractors for the unfinished portions of the Dimboola and Donald lines to permit goods trains to be run over the permanent way at once, without waiting for the completion of the works now in hand If the contractors consent, the removal of the grain lying at Dimboola and Donald

The Minister of Railways has instructed the office of his department to proceed with despatch, with the plans for the Mount Wycheproof line. This work will be under- taken without delay, in order that employment may be offered to the farmers who are now in distressed circumstances in consequence of the drought A telegram from the Minister of Water Supply to the Secretary of the department yesterday, intimated that water trams had that day reached Cragie Lea, four miles from Wedderburn, and 18 tanks of water were taken away by the settlers in the vicinity Twenty other trucks will be sent thither to day. The Kilmore justices, Messrs Geoghegan, Dowling, and Crough, have not yet resigned, as requested by the Government in consequence of their action in the Hayes case If no reply is received to the request that they should retire on or before Monday, the Solicitor General will take action to give effect to the resolution of the Cabinet In connexion with the efforts now being made to procure water in the more arid portions of the colony by bonny, water augers are now at work in the following shires -Korong, East Loddon, fat Arnaud, Shepparton, Stawell, Wimmera Marong, Echuca, Lowan, Huntly, and Waranga Others are being sent to Dunmunkle Swan- hill Waranga, and Goulburn Another is at work under the supervision of the Avon Plains 1 Farmers Club They are worked under the control of the local bodies and half the cost of the operations is borne by the Government.
