PRODUCE MARKETS THE people of Dunedin, N.Z, are just now somewhat exercised over the alleged intioduction of the sweating system among certam blanches of in dustiy in that city As to the tiuth or untruth of these allegations the i Otago Witness has lately instituted enquny, and, as a result, publishes a long and circumstantial story of the expel lences of operatives who are driven to accept employment at star vation wages Hood’s “Song of the Shirt” may be taken as a typical rendenng of such expei lences But the evidence furnished to the re porter of the Witness shows that, although the sweating system can only exist wheie there is merciless competition between operatives them selves, or, in other vvoids, in an ovei supphed labor market, yet that this competition, with all its cruelly disastrous consequences, is ically foiced upon them from outside “It is not the manufactuiei’s fault” says one of the vvitnesses, “ they aie so many, and they cut each otliei down so in putting in for big orders, such as Govern ment and i ail way contracts in clothing, that they must -screw wages down to the lowest farthing, because the man who tenders lowest, gets the most work ” Ho mote tenible testimony to the demoralising system can be giv en than that which is included in the statement of the repoiters of the Otago that they had to proceed with the greatest caution lest the meie suspicion of their receiv ing complaints from the half starved victims of the accursed system should result in the boycotting and ■consequent -stai v ation of the com plainants Competition, say the wit nesses, is at the loot of all the mis chief: not the oidmaiy competition of rival tradesmen, but another and less reputable kind, which is the pioduct of unfair and disreputable trickery The strength of a-chain, says an old adage, is the strength of its weakest link, and it appeats that the wages’ 'evel of a w hole army of operatives, of whom the- gieater propoihon aie women and gnls, is the lowest figure to which the ingenuity r of an unscrupulous employer can sink it down. In the relentless competition of the present day the smallest savings in cost of raw material, oi the wages paid in the pro cess of manuf.icture, have to be taken into account. In the clothing business, for instance, as reported at Dunedin, any man who can, no matter how, or by what unfair or dishonorable tactics, save a few pence in the make of a pair of trousers or a coat, has the advan tage of all the members of the trade who have not sunk so low. The few pence on each article when multiplied by the thousands of articles which are included in a big contract, represent a very considerable sum Now, the sweater can enjoy this advantage in either of two ways He can pocket it as surplus profit, and remain in com petition with his more honorable con temporaries on apparently equal toi ms, or, which is the usual thing, he prefers the delight of undercutting them in tenders for woik, and leaving them out in the cold. The others, as shrewd business men, find themselves bound to follow his t ictics or accept commercial defeat, and it is but human nature to prefer the former alternative Tins results in a general and perminent loweiingof the average wage, and in additional keenness of competition Bye and bye, some ingenious and un puncipled employei invents a way in which the already scanty wages mav be screwed down to a point yet lower. The same reasons which operated be fore now operate again to compel the bulk of employers to descend to this second level of meanness and in justice, and so the game goes on There will clearly be no limit to the rapacity of the sweater unless it appeal in the form of absolute starvation, or else desperate revolt on the pait of his victims Society does not want either. The Otago Witness pertinently enquire* — “ Are these nhl world curses to be tllowed to eat their way into the heart of this young community ’ Ihe system, if unchecked, will soon estiblisb a hold over the entire colony If this insidious giowth extends, the physical, sacral, and even moral status of our working class will assuredly deteriorate, and th it will be equivalent to the deterioration of the entile community Starvation wages among women cinnot prevail extensively and the next generation reap no disadvantage. Our greatest danger lies in letting matters go too far foi recoveiy before we take action ” 111 the above query there lies em bodied a consideration of which far too little note is usually taken. Long hours and staivation wages are cruelty to the victim, but they are also a sure precursor of degenerate offspring. And what right have we, any of us, or on any pretence, to exaggerate the necessity w hich dooms the human race : to labor. Far less to be iccessory to the physical degeneration cf those who are to follow 1 And, even if we are | not personally connected viith, or in terested in, the maintenance of a white slavery more ’detestable than the Southern States of America ever knew, what light liavo we, any of us who claim to be Christian*, to stand idly by, knowing all the while that such abominations exist? We aie well assured tint on Bal larat, at least, the sweating system will ' neier tlirnc But we may well have a care that it is not even mtio duced here under the disguise of fur and open competition And in this connection we cannot but hold that the putting out of tailois’, boot makers’, or any other work, the labor of which is to be provided by an n responsible and possibly unscrupulous middleman on such terras as he can squeeze out of impecunious operativ es, is treading on very dangerous giound indeed We aie glad that in a very recent and notable instance the era ployeis showed a ready disposition to act fauly. The operatives there con cerned owe much to the fact that they stand under the shield of a trades’ union. What a pity for the operatives of Dunedin that similar protection is not available for the women and girls who do tailoring and light shoemakers’ I work l Tun electoial struggle in New South Wales was brought to a close on Satur day, with a tesult which had alieady been anticipated. It matters very little whethei the avowed Protection ists aie in a minority of five oi only one, as the parties aie too nearly balanced for either to obtain a decisive upperhand It is, no doubt, true that thePiotectiomsts have greatly strength ened their position since the last general election, w hen Sir Henry Parkes gained a two thuds ma]o nty on the issue of Fiee Tiade, and it may be tiue that the avowed Freetiaders aie no longei a compact and united paity, and are split up into factions in which peisonal feeling foi or against the late Premier is a leading feature Giant mg all this the question lemains what is the new Parliament going to do? Eveiy membei of the new House must be well aware that party Government, under the cn cumstances, is quite im possible The Government will be in, at least, a nominal minority, and this fact will tell against them, while the other side cannot mustei a majonty strong enough to wairant them in stuving to giasp the reins of power It may not be easy to say what, undei the cn cumstances, the newly-elected House will do, but it is by no means difficult to say what legislator, who seek to piomote the welfare of their colony, ought to do. Theie is no leason to suspect that the political feeling of the countiy is not fairly reflected in the avowed punciples of the new members Consequently any fiesh appeal to the electors would, in all likelihood, icpioduce the turmoil and expense of a genet al election with out really nnpioving the position for eithei party If the leaders on bothsides tefuse to listen to reason, we may- see in New South Wales a succession of Ministeiial cusps, aboitive sessions, and appeals to the countiy. The elec tor of New South Wales have canned the reputation of being loyal to their political leader, but it is doubtful tf any loyalty would survive such a strain as this And it is abundantly certain that the interests of the colony would, in the stiuggle, or rather sue cession of struggles, be pushed to the wall So far as we can see, polities have in New South Wales come to a point at which theie is absolutely no thoroughfare, except upon the lines of coalition The apple of discord be tween the great contending pai ties is the question of fiscal policy. Afirt condition to any hopeful coalition must therefoie be that this question must be shelved until public feeling with icgard to it has fm ther npened This done there should be no insuperable difii culty in forming a mixed Cabinet The Queen’s Government must be earned on, and there are many urgent matters, such as amendment of the land laws, Civil Seivice reform, extension of local government, andothei tilings, which not only demand to be dealt with without delay, but can be better and n.bre hopefully undertaken by a coalition government than by any other. If Sit Henry Parkes prove impracticable, it might be possible to show that New South Wales can, at a pinch, get along without him, and the proof would have a salutary effect in more ways than one. Aftei the example of Yic tona neither of the New South Wales political parties can avoid the admission that in one case, at least, coalition Government has pioduced excellent lesults Let them also tiy it Our Melbourne correspondent, writing lust evening, say' —" Now that it is known the P.uhainentarv elections are to tike place about the 29th Match, members arc -bowing considerable disippoiutincnt at the action of the Government in withholding its policy, if it lias one.

On the resolution of the committee of the Asylum being made I known to the Old Colonists’ Association, I nmob indignation was expressed at the “ im pounding” of the money, which had been sent in on the understanding that it should he kept only on the conditions specified in the letter accompanying the cheque. The committee it seems were nnder the impression (indeed they were led to beltere that such was the case by a member of committee) th it the £T7a had been collected at the Charity Sun day service held on the Eastern Oval in November last. But the official letter fiom the association did not say that the money was obtained at such gathering Last night the association! (tinough Mr Dyte, icting secretary) again addressed the committee of the institution on the subject asking for the return of the money as the conditions wh eh accompanied it hid not been complied with Mr Show man contended that the Asylum had no right to drt un the money, ad en qmml whether it was a fact that the crossed cheque for the amount had been rushed off to the bink and i allied almost inimcdi itcly after its receipt, and before it « is known whether the committee would comply with the stipulations A reply in the affiiimtne' was given, and then Mr Show in in said such action was not business like, and moved th it the money be returned to the Old Colonists Assocntiou Mi Coutts seconded the motion, 1 and said he stiongly opposed the action of the committee in keeping money sent in under special conditions which h id not been adheied to In a discussion which followed someone at the table remarked that the money had been obtained by the association under false pretences, and Mi bhoppeo finally brought the debate to a close by pointing out that the motion could not be dealt with until the previous resolution dc taming the money had been lescmded Mr Carey thereupon tabled a notice of motion to this effect, and it will be considered at the \- nextgeneial meeting of the committee A ruffianly occurrence at the gardens on Sunday night was reported to the police e irly yesterday morning by a men named X bonus -Smith Smith is employed at the fruit stall on the lawn, by Messrs J.
