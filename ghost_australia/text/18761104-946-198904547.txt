HARRY ARDEN, OR THE LOST DEEDS. BY MRS. ANNA YOUNG. CHAPTER VI. AN INTRODUCTION TO A FLIRT. ¶ Arden soon wearied of this gossip of the. old main with Whom we left him conversing, so he bowed, and hurried across the wide, grassy common which separated the mansion of Mr Withers from the less pretentious houses in the village. It was covered with flocks of geese, which fluttered and screamed at his approach, until he thought it was no marvel that the uproar made by such insignificant means had once saved Rome. Their noiso served also as an announcement to himself, for Mr Withers, being a man of an inquiring mind,1 came to his door to see whose arrival had aroused those faithful sen tinels. That gentleman advanced at once, with an expression of cordial sur prise, and, offering his hand, said— «- I behold you again sound and in good spirits, my dear sir, in spite of the ordeal of the past nigbt. Keally, you must be a person of iron nerve.' ¶ Withers insisted that he should enter at once,' and tell him of the adventures of tbe'tnigbt ; bnt Arden declined the invitation, and he was compelled to content himself with the prospect of an interview after the morning meal1 was despatched. ? The visitor walked to . and' fro in front of the pretentious, mansion. . , ¶ In a few, moments he .became con scious, that a young head, loaded with glittering flaxen ringlets, was slily put forward every time he crossed in front of the windows of a room which seemed, to be fitted up in an expensive manner. Soon tfie owner of- the head seemed to . gain } trore courage, and she 6tood com posedly before the window, as if uucon scious that, a ,very good- looking yo«ng , man was leisurely promenading in' front' of her. ¶ Arden looked at her, of course, for, sho was pretty, enough to attract notice anywnere, and seemed quite indifferent to his gaze. The young girl was small;, exquisitely formed, and her complexion , was fair and . soft as that of an infant, frith the clearest tint of the ' rose upon her cheeks and lips.' Self will and mirth werejread inthe.expressionpf her mouth, and her nose, slightly turned up, gave an arch expression ? to, her face, ? which was very captivating; : :.,.':: „/.!;.. ¶ Dora Withers, for she it evidently was, glanced coquettislily towards Arden, and .'? seemed by no means 'displeased with the admiring glances' he ventured to cast toward her, as\ho passed 'hear. the window,' at each turn in bis walk. ? ¶ She had stood thus but a few moments, when' a hand belonging to some invisible form suddenly grasped her arm, and drew her, away. Ardon gained an im perfect glance of the person who treated her in this unceremonious' manner, but1 he was quite sure it was not her father, and this impression was confirmed by the sound of the voice which came from the window so distinctly that he could not avoid hearing the words— . ¶ "You incorrigible little flirt, will you never learn discretion ?? Such con duct is unbearable.'' ¶ The;girl passionately answered— ¶ "How dare you, sir! Who gave you leave'to treat methus ?? I will not bear i it! I will inform my father !' ' ¶ "And he will tell you t-hat I have th* right .to Ibbkafteryou, my. pretty ,one. '. The do»r stood ajar,and when I sawhow profitably you wera employed, in ogling that absurd-looking artist, I thought; it best.to put an end to it. ©ora, I warn you I will'have no trifling with this young mani I 'have borne enough, and you oinst learn that something is 4uc to me , .as— — ?' ,..; : ? :? ?/.'.

John was the eldest, and he fared hardly enough until the second brother was able to take his place on the farm.

He possessed shrewd ness, perseverance, and enterprise, and in a few years ho became the partner of the proprietor, and at his death suc ceeded to the business. At the age of thirty he married a young girl who possessed a few thousand dollars, which materially aided him in his efforts to secure the smiles of for tune. Mrs Withers lived scarcely a year, and the fair Dora was left an infant only a few weeks old. The one desire of her father's heart seeme 1 to be to acquire wealth, that this darling of his pride might make hereafter a bril liant marriage. Gold was bis idol, and to; add. fortune to fortune was Mr Wither's ideal of a good match. The young lady was trained to consider wealth the chief consideration of her future settlement, and men's hearts as playthings, to be trifled with at her own pleasure.. , ' ',': At eighteen she was a consummate flirt, and as the daughter of the richest man in Glenfall,'. oonsidered herself above censure, or at least utterly regard less 'of 'it,;,' ,/':.?

His fortune mode, Mr Withers built himself a house after a plan of his own, furnished it in a flashy manner, and took upon himself the otium cum digni-, lif(7fe;J:of'ithe )f position* he? hadachieved.1 Buti'alas ! the man of active habits, and: shrewd calculation, soon found that to' him life was scarcely worth' possessing on; such terms. His faculties rusted,' his mind grew inert, and he might with .truth; have said that all was weariness. Hence originated. his interference; with.; the jgnestsof the Washington House, of which the landlord had so bitterly com plained; for the arrivalbf any educated person at Glenfall was eagerly welcomed as a diversion to the monotony of his existence ; ; and if they were 'at all pre- : seritable he .usually found means to induce them to accept his hospitality. ..'- '; Unusually red in the « face from the rapidity' with' which he had despatched . his breakfast, Withers, again appeared* at the door, and invited his visitor to. enter. : Arden followed hinv acrosSjii ,wide hall, hung with .deer's antlers, and ; furnished with luxurious seats 'for' lounging; for in spite of his, early train-' ing, Mr Withers appreciated the 'dolce far nitnte as much as any man. , They, entered .the very, room by the window! pfj which, he hnd seen' the younggir'l standing, and 'Arden prepared, himself for his most elaborate tow ; but the 'fair vision had vanished, and he sat down feeling rather disappointed .-:;;-.?

I will put myself, in some sense, under the protection of tho law, by getting you, in your capacity of magis trate, to aid me in giving the ruin a thorough investigation. Once assured, that no secret lurking place is concealed about the house, I shall feel quite secure under its shelter.' While ho thus spoke, Withers re covered his usual composure, and readily answered — 'Certainly — command me; I am ready to render you any assistance yon may need, while the sun shines, bat excuse me from any night vigil. I am satisfied the evil reputation of the house must have some foundation; and I decline interfering with its i, spiritual inmates. If it will satisfy you, we will proceed at once to search the old place, but. it will be of no use. Lindorf had a .thorough examination made when he met with snch severe treatment there, but it re sulted in nothing. Let me entreat you, Mr Arden, to give up this mad scheme of yours, and lodge in the village at night. During the day you can surely sketch enough, and return at night-fall, either to my house or the Washington, as may suit your inclinations. best.' The vision of the ringletted head, and the jealous lover, flitted before the mental vision of Arden, arid he.; at once replied-;-. . '/?'??-: :%:??$ 'Thank you.
