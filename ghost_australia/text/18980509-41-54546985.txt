ABUSES AT WEST-TERRACE CEMETERY. Ib the Editor. i-ir— On Monday last a member of my family paid a visit to the West-terrace Cemetery with a few memorial tokens to nlauc oil the craves of mv mother and mv ton. At each grave I bad previously erec ted small creases with a square piece of p!.i«s let in with an inscription. Imagine the £ri?f and pain experienced when this ;»l:us' was toiina to have been smashed and thrown about the block, it makes one's heart ache to know that these little tokens cannot lie left alone. What are those who have charge of thw place doing to allow this sort ot thing to be carried on? If there are not enough men to perform their: duties why not employ more? At times I have seen tbe cemetery crowded, and it liai been more like a public park or place of amusement than the resting-place ot the dead. One never hears of such acts at tbe little nuUide cemeteries. Take the one at Payncbam. for instance. There the curator is a constable, and be is continually on die alert. A notice u posted up nuitioninz the public apiiurt unnecessary loitering. When a funeral takes place at Wret-tcrraeo there is often a scramble to hear and see what is gouig on. and sometimes . relatives and mourner* are not able to get enough room to stand around the grave. The whole matter of .arrangements at the cemetery needs attention. I am, Sir. &c;, ...-..;? DISGUSTED. He (playfully)-Mflcw old are vAl Miss Brown!' Sber-'I cannot tell a fie. I ?
