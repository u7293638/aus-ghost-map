UTRT.TtflTTRirR. (FEOX 0C£ 0W5 00E££EP05SZ3CT.) JimeL The meeting of Parliament on Friday last wai the chief event of the week. Hi* Excellency the Govercor, with something of the pomp and Eplcndour of vice- regal ceremony, came down to the Houses of Legislature about two o'clock, and read to the honourable member* of both chambers the speech, tbe contents of which have been so severely criti cited and commented on eince. The Governor only remained long enough to read the address, and departed in his coach, escorted by a troop of cavalry, com manded by Major Purchas. There was a very large croud stationed in the parliament yaid, and it was evident that the number of those holding loyalist priveleges greatly pre dominated. His Excellency was cheered, and booted se well, and several members of the Ministry a!so received a salute of groans. Some of the minister* stood the tire of pnblic discon tent admirably, puticaUrly Mr. Laogton, whose appearance was hailed with a storm of hisses and greans. Bat Mr. Langton's de meanour, suggestive of the utmost coolness and indifference, very soon silenced tbe expressions of popular dislike. After the reading of the speech in the Council-chamber, the Houses ad journed, and met again at four o'clock, when there was a fall muster of members. The nnmerical ctrengtb of the Opposition was osten tatiously displayed, and they made do secret of their intense satisfaction at the beggarly display of empty benches on tbe Ministerial side of the House. During the delivery of Mr. M*CuHoch's speech his following cheered him to tbe echo, and when be referred tj the 'extraordinary circumstances' under which tbe Ministry had been formed, his remarks were drowned in ap plause. His speech was of very short duration, and tbe adjournment till Tuesday, which be proposed, was passed without any opposition. Judging from what be said, tbe tone of it, sod the manner iu which it was received, it was exceeduuly likely that the debate of next Tues day would be one of very great importance, so far as respects its constitutional asjiect. It is ex - pected that Mr. Fellows will state the case for his partv at crest leaeth. The representation of BnmM HOI, which will shortly be rendered vacant by the resiena tion of Mr. Verdou, will be solicited byMr. Wbiteman. A report was current fora few days that Mr. O'Grady would come forward for the constituency, bat thenmoor has been con tra/iicted, and it is generally thought that Mr. Whueman't return is certain. Mr* O'Grady in all likelihood, will obtain a seat by the retire ment of Mr. L. Burke, tbe member lor KOmore. Tbe result of the election for South Bonrke was a very great surprise to many, aa tbe belief was general that Me Crews had not tbe ghost of a chan.-e. I expect toe election was lost owing to tbe fact, that the friends of Mr. OXJtady ondervalned tbe strength of their opponent. It would appear tbat tbe Cxnstitu tMoal party ia awakening into actual life. Their Associatioa is now fairly and energeti cally at work, and branch societies are being everywhere formed.
