WHY CHILDREN ARE AFRAID. 1500 CHILDREN ANSWER. Professor Maodonald, of tihe Washington Bureau of Education,, 'has been making a scries of extremely interesting investiga tions as to tlie causes wbich arouse Sear in children. His study of fear in the youth- ful subjects was made by distributing hun dreds of lists containing all (manner of causes, such as might excite that emotion. Parents, teachers and other persons — even the little ones tihemselves — marked off such items as the, latter really feared. After reducing all of the replies to a table, it was found the highest number feared thunderstorms, the next highest rep tiles. Then follow, in order, according to the number fearing them, strangers, dark ness, fire, death, domestic animals, disease, wild animalB, water, insects, ghosts, &e.; A comparison of on equal number of boys and girls show that tihe girls feared 1765 things on the list, and the boys 1100 things. The girls exceeded the boys in the fear of everything except water, high places, and strangers. The ra tio of gu-te to boys in the fear of rats and mice was 75 to 13, as might be expected. It was also- ascertained that fear in the Ijoys increases from the seventh to the fifteenth yenr, and then declines, while in girls it increases more steadily- from the fourth to the eighteenth year before di minishing. Tlie fear of thunder and light ning, reptiles, robbers and machinery were found to -increase .with age. A careful study of the circumstances of birth and childhood of what were considered to be the 50 greatest men of modern times disclosed the fact that the average great man was born in a family of six children, not including "half-brothers or half- sisters. It was figured from the data that the chances for greatness in a child are two to one in favor of the older half of the family. . . .
