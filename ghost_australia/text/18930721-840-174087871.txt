Protection Prom Clothes Moths. Itcaumnr, more than 150 years ago, mads qnue extensive xesuarohes, on clothes- moths ; and, observing that they never attacked tho wool and hair on living animals, he inferred that tho natural odor of tho wool, or of the oily matter in it, was distasteful to them. Ho therefore rubbed various garments with tbo wool of (rush pelts, and also wot other garments with tho water in whioh wool has been washed, and found that they wore never attaokerl by moths. He alio exparimcntod with tobacco smoke and tbe odors of spirits ot turpsntino, anil found that beth ol these wore destructive to the moth, but it was neocemuy to close tho rooms very tightly, aud keep the fumes very denes in tbsm for 24 lioura, to obtain Bstisfaatory results. Mr. 0. H. Fcrniild, of thsHatab Experiment Station ot the MaasBobusctta Agricultural College, has alw&yo; found that any matoiial subject to the attacks of moths may be preserved from thetn if packed away with optica of oedar between tho folds. The odor of oedar is so disagreeable to them that thoy will not deposit their eggs where the odor is it all strong. Ghosts of oedar, or alosota finished in the Bams wood, will pro- icot clothing from moths as long as the odor is strong ; but this is lost with ago, and then they are no protection. It mast be remem bered that the odor ol cedar, onmphor, &o.;, only prevents tha moth from laying her eggs en the fabrics ; bnt if the eggs are laid bafora the garments are packed away with oedar, ibe., tha odor will not prevent the hatching of tho eggs nor the destructive work of the larvro afterwards. Clothing may also be protected from moths by packing it in bags made of either atont paper or cotton oloth,if made porfeotly tight, but this mnst bo dono before the moths appear on the wing in the spricg. Wnv in a clover man like a pin ? Beaanss his bead generally prevents him going too far.
