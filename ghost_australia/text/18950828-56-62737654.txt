Tli^Stpryteller. CHAPTER I. (Continued.) ' A nice kettle of fi«h, upon me eoul and conscience !! cried a.newHBoaiet. maki.0KKbJBt on'trWcd wilbou'. coromdny ; and IKeT^ltdent chaplain to tbe English congregation came bustling forward. Anexoellent man was tbo Rev. Tbeopbilua O'Gradv, despite some blemishes for which perhaps ho wai not ahoirother accountable. ^ , -,.; 10 tne race irom.wuion no^sprang ne owoa that love of fun and, tKat spirit of .jest and good-fel'owBhip which bad maae him so popular ; and it certainly oould not be bo deemed bis fault that nature had given to him moie talents fur the stage than the pupil. Ou bad a red scorbutic faoc, a jovial, rollicking manner, an nnotnous brogue, and a very glossy black hat. He camo in now with unusual gravity, treading as it were 0:1 imaginary egg-abeUs, and speaking in a'vbico sulidued to a ^whisper.; -, , Ho went' straight. (o tbo body,..*anil,Uia%t-l- ing down by it, offerod up a* short, but forvrnt prayer; then, addrosain-j tlioso prosoir, hu said — 'This is a terrjbje^businciis,. .Rentlfmign-— a poor fellow.^ sna'ched. , &yriiyxi.; dr T-atboV.VjI^ sbnuld B»y,.makin' awpy^^lb^fiimsolf.^iTtt^e' ei t be r of you* a'. taste Jtf bra n i)y 1-. ^i^att^quiVe upect. Yoo see the uews of it came upon me like a (book; I was' just bavin' sT bit of aorjper ..with me wife — we bad a Limerick ham Vbioh the O'ShaugbVessy's.b'roWht/ over.'

Well, I wm eattn'/me aoppe'r when in comes Tom O'SHa'ugb'6essry, pale ami frifthtened like. ' Oh,' sob ho, 'did you hear the news ? There's a man gone and shot1 himself ; down at dm Kurial.'w ' Oh, the acpursod place 1' sea I — not, meani.n' any thjng ofFensiTe to you, For't6s, foi^I ha^ve always fourT') you quite the gentloman j b^ut it's the abomiioable system T condemn— and so I. got me. hat and down I camo as fast aa np lo-?a ooulri take . me. s But sure, when I left librae, I.hajn't the' ghost of a notion that it was the poor fellow lyin' there; although indeoS; be the way things were goin' yester day, I thought, it likely he'd be makia* a boflionr of himiell.! : , . , ♦ Then, good He^reD,' cried Sir Alan, J wby^didjrou not interfere ? Wash't it joor bounden duty ? — that Is, if you consider you have any duties,' ba added, with*a*iiieer. The Reveredd Theophilua O'Grady drew himself op with dignity. ' Me_cloth ought to protect me from in Bult,' h'o said 1 ' and when you 'speak in that tone you mean to inio.lt me— that you do ; atltb'o earae time it is me 'duty to give you- an explanation, as I may have scandalised you. I did consi^or.jsir^.that it^was me duty to interfere. . I,.wont up to. Colonel Le Marcbant and^ r'eaioned. /with him. I did more — I offered him me house to shelter him. and me purse to get him'a'way ; and he answered me, sir, at all of yon answer your parson when be attempts(.to interfer^^with your pleasures — with contempt, ,'jiir, that you do. Hr. told; me to stand aside »hd-let him pass, that the rope was already round his neck, but that' before he went he would beat the obatinaey pf,tbe/cofo//;. H'8 lystem, he said, had never failed and Dover would fail;. and then, with a laugh that rings in me ear still, be thrust me aside. No apologies, Sir Alan — I only did ino duty; but I accept your excuse. Yes, General, I haver known the Colonel for -years —in different places— -a .sort of paraon'a'ao quaiotanoe, you understand. He was a 'wild bird, Infancy,, jtmt quite the gentlemhn, . Just like the'O'Graays, tie had run through ^very, penny he had, and had come down of late years ^ to. conaortin*. with blaek-legi aod| croupiers huA 4ooh like— :ho pfTepce, Fortes.! He did not go much amobgat'the respectable sort. He wasn't married when I first knew him, 'and I never heard of tne child; and that briugs me to the berryin'. I protest tnoBt pmpbatically, gentlemen, against bis being huddled into a hole like a dead oat or dog. I hear be hasn't left a penny.; I oalled in at 'the Bellevue qb I came along , and there found the Oommistaire of Police busy sealin' the man's trunks ; but he told me in confi dence there wasn't a penny, arid no clue 'to Won (is... The grate was full , of burnt fetters. But, gehtleraen, I don't look up'on'this'as 'an ordinary case of suicide. The man. was an Englishman, a countryman of oar own, and it will be a et^andin' diifrao^ if be gets a'epmmon suicide's funeral. He was,not a suicide— he was a madman — and, as such, I will'on me own responsibility bury him in the ' Ssy metare des Onglays,' i'j you will make a sub ?eription to defray the expenses.' As tbe Reverend Theophilus maSd' this little speech, ^which he flelivered. Well, 'and with much dramatic! ?abt'io'n, the cunning 'of his expression was beyond description, as was also tbe way in whioh he watched tbe effect produced.- It was eminently successful, the company offering large donations, Jibe moat couaiderable beingthat of Sir Alan Harleob. The Reverend Theophilus bad every reason to be pleased with the result of his eloquence, both froBi a philanthropic and worldly point of view, .for the unlooked -lor addition to the household purse, wbioh was never, too well filled by the voluntary contributions of .the ? fluctuating congregation would be very weloome. ' The onjy, difficulty now remaining was to gat the administration to allow the more respectable funeral to take place ; and this Mr. O'Grady' undertook and accomplished, the one condition being that the interment should, be at ni'tflTt and Vinctly.'p'nvate. It surprised Sir Alan that this proviso should so greatly annoy the chaplain. . \--.- These foreigners/ he observed, in bis indignation, 'have no respect for death — don't care 'a snap of your fingers who lives or. dies. Not but that 'they're 'exoollont fellows j and they treat Tme very decently considering I'm an intruder, a .poaoher I. sh'ould'ssy, on their preserves. Tho.'.Vickairo' nij tho ' Curay ' are very -glad 'to seo me,, especially, since I taught, them bow to mako a glass of toddy ; and thoy make if as well as an CVGrady— and that's'sayin' tk great.deal, for our family are supposod to. have a peculiar reoipe for both makin' and drinkin' toddy. And, bp the same token, I was taken for one of them p'-insts tho other day. Ob, it's a grand story /and the ' Curay' alw*ya'makes me tell it — they all delight in fvBo taey do.|. Well.sir, I w»s comin'along ' tli^!Pron|?D9de, wheg. who shonld.l meet, uut a firJfe qSsbfh' woman, all floahoei and, lirealc of. paint ou it very comely face ; and she stops me, and set abe to me, ' Mrs. Washing ton Browne, father.'
