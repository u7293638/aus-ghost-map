AMUSEMENTS. THEATRE ROYAL. The second performance of Pinero a clever and startling comedy "The Gay Lord Quer; -was witnessed by another crowded and enthusiastic audience at the Iheatre^BSjilron Thursday evening. The Comed?"Wsicli has been denounced as im- Jnoraliy a leading English divine, curious ly enough, dismisses the inevitable woman witi? a past in favor of a man whose early life has hot been cast in the mould from which saints are fashioned. Lord Quex lias certainly been "gay," to brand him **lfoe wickedest man in London" is perhaps^ scarcely meting out justice to his fellows in wrong-doing. Be that as it may, lore for a young and innocent girl has reformed him, and from rthe. time the -play opens un to the eurtam talk his .thoughts and mction* are alike blameless. True, he com mits, an indiscretion in consenting to a midnight meeting in tbe boudoir of the ■.

Anthony, and his subsequent treatment of Sophy is prompted by his desire to Aield the repu tation of the duchess—to whom he at least -owes that reparation—and 19 certainly not ■: due to any selfish or ulterior motives. The unexpected climax, in which fee rescues the girl, who lias .wrecked ,-his . prospects of matrimonial happinessl. ■Awfrom an equivocal position is .not aridiont <~4* touch of riobUity, while the absorbing ■deration of Sophy to her foster sister, Tor •"whose sake she is wining to sacrifice both ; fast happiness and her reputation, is heroic aid entirety above censure. :Nalurally, the /.Iritwations border on delicate'ground, but ;-j|the. .comedy was not precisely written for 'the edification of the "young person," ; whose education with regard to the po*s: .'tOides of this wicked world, has, by the ; r way, been fairly well administered to by . modenLictkui. from the standpoint ~: ipf rtgrality- EJatro'if'coniedy-^nay, safe);.,' . compare wit^seores of other plajrs winch .' hare:been-icifc scathingly criticised, while' jn.po?it o&jbonOfcptiO;?, construction, and i jiferajy finish, -it is indubitably and hn / jneassxably their superior.
