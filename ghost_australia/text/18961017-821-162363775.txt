POETRI. AFTER LONG YEARS. Dear heart, and trae. ln the seasons fled, Has ttio world swept by me, and loft me dedflf " Sara the pa&sies; withered I uscdte know? . ■ Are the roses faded of long ago? - ' Do the tapert'giframer tliat lit the feahtff - llaa the pageant passed? Has the mimic eeasodl And, musing here on the sea-be&tcoasb;, , ■ Am I living man or a wandering ghost? Still in the scent of the autumn air " I feel a rapture Hut's like despair; Tho starlight, pale on the sleeping sea, £}"» Harmless, sorrowful joy to me; And, lit by ora or orescent of niitht, Meadow and woodland are brave to sight. Still I bend to the mystio power Of the strange sea-breeze and the breath of flowed And the face of beauty wakes the wraith Of holy passion and knightly faith. But ever I hear an undertone— A subtle, sorrowful, wordless moan; Hie dying note of a funeral bell; TJiofaltoring sigh of a iastfarcwolL And ever I see, through lurid haze. Hie sombre phantoms of other days; In light that's sad as the ruin it f rots— Tuc solemn light of a sun that nets. Ah, never now does youth dream on As it used to dream in the summers gone I For round it dashes tho tide of years Its eyes are darkened with inist of team | Its hopes are sere as the fading grass, And nothing it wished has como to pass. Yet ever, in wayward, passionate power, hike a wind that moans through a ruined towon O'er memory's darkening fields along It rustles tiio fallen leaves of song; And, wild in tlie heart, it wakes tho thrill That nothing but Death can over still.
