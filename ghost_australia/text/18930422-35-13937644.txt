' FUGITIVE NOTES. I Belligerency appears to be a recognised civic principle in the municipal administration of North Sydney. It does not matter what changes occur in the personnel of the council sOld members may pass out and now ones come in, but they fight all the same, and it would appear that they two come to think that fighting is one of their municipal functions The other day in council one alderman is said to have told another bluntly that he was " a blackguard " He had been moved to it by being told by the other that he knew who the alderman's father was The assertion of knowledge on this point provoked the other so much that he rebuked his opponent by a threat of a tumbler of water. The argumentum a I hominem conveyed in threatening to dash half pint of water in another man's face may be convincing for a moment, but it does not lead to finality in the settling of abstruse questions Indeed it is more likely to be only the beginning, and that is why this form of discussion appears to be continuous in some of our councils Something is to be allowed, however, for circumstances Mossman has just broken away, carrying half of the territory with it, and aldermen are irritated Thou, as the presence of gas in a container constitutes what is called a fiery mine," so the continuous presence of gas raided the municipal council fiery-very. . . . a But apart from all these subsidiary to mrs, we must search for the cause of the belligerent character of civic life there in meteorological sources Dr Bevan said in his lecture lately that Tomkinson was the product of the Australian climate How UM taken to task for this, because with some people it is as much treason to revise our beautiful climate as to say a word against our be lutif ill h labour But Dr Bevan was quite right It is the climate does it It is no reflection on the goodness of soil in a paddock to say that it is luxuriantly prolific in weeds Then Harkness proves the fertility And so it is with larrikins It is the glory of the climate that is coming out in them, and it imparts so much grit and go to them that they will go for a mile or anything else in their way, under the necessity of giving vent to the new that is in them. So with aldermen It is the ozone does it That delightful peninsula between the seas is so surcharged with free office, that they labour under an intensity of muscular os element that must have relief And as an alderman may be taken as containing the concentrated force of his warm], it is a happy thing that the municipal council chamber a lords an opportunity for relieving the tension, without any of those disastrous results which might happen if the forces were attempted to be permanently suppressed That is why they say " you're another " and speak about each other s fathers, and threaten to throw tumblers of water at one another I . . A cat's nose has just been found under the floor of a house at Tauranga, in New Zealand, containing " SO unused wax matches, four photographs, and a small book of sacred songs "That is the real "incendiary) rat" at last, traced to his lair, and found with his tools of tr ide around him People have often been disposed to be sceptical about his existence Now there can be no longer doubt on the subject People have professed difficulty in believing how buildings of the least combustible in stern ils and contents, but generally comfortable) insured, have suddenly gone to blazes Sometimes they said that the building spontaneously combusted, and other times that it was the incendiary rat " But neither the one thing nor the other altogether seemed to square with facts, and more particularly people have been disposed to religiously g be at the incendiary rat himself But now that he has been found in New Zealand, his equipment gives a clue to his modus operandi He is a nut with a bundle of matches and a little book of sacred songs The photographs seem superfluous, but they are not They are no doubt the counter for presentments of his wives or sweethearts and show that the rat has a double life, and that in his private or domestic relations he has his affinities and his tenderness like the rest of us. But the hymn book and the burn He of matches That's business With the one he works his way in, and with the other he worked his way out It is only the confidence trick in a respectable way. Nothing like the sacred song book for giving the respectable touch to it It gives character, credit, that means goods stock, a substantial insurance, and then the matches It is not at all to be thought that, thou 'h the rat has been found in New Zealand his habitat is exclusively there No His kith and kin have wandered pretty extensively, and the red tionship may generally be traced b) pretty much the same characteristics, the bundle of matches and the small book of sacred songs . 6 4 6 . It gives one a humiliating sense of the survival clothe hateful old quarrels of ages gone to find the question of Queer V versus Pope raised out of a banquet given at the Mansion House in London That both the Lord Mayor and his assailants are about equally to blame for it does not lessen in the lost the unworthiness of the scene The Lord Mayor, 'Jdciimin Stuart Knill, had pre- sons!) Observed his religious independence and civil rights in refusing to attend public worship in a Protestant temple, and most reason able people applauded or forgave him for it. But he has no right to take the occasion of his official position to obtrude his religious convictions in an ostentatious way on a com- county which has shown its liberality by raising him, a Roman Catholic, to the first position of dignity in a community that is essentially Protestant The ungenerous loss and the bad taste of it must strike any one of proper feelings, and an act like that goes a long way to revive the old roll gums hatreds of which modern people are generally) becoming rather ashamed On the other hand, the excitement that has arisen over his action is about as discreditable to his critics His offending was that at a banquet given to Cardinal Vaughan and other Roman Catholic dignitaries the Lord Mayor proposed the toast of ' The Pope " before that of " The Queen " This is said to be disloyal But there was not need, arily anything disloyal in it, and there can be no rational doubt that existed play was not in the inter tion of the Lord Mayor Mr a Roman Catholic he conscientiously believes that the Pope is Christ's vice gerent on earth, and as a religious man he esteems things spirits is more than things temporal and spiritual authority more than tom pond authority, rendering unto Caesar the things that are Caesar s, and to God the things that are God's Bosnios, it was at a meeting- part liking of an ecclesiastical or religious clear acted Had it been a secular meeting there would have been a disloyal significance and BUggeotivoneBstbatwoulel have made the Lord Mayor s conduct inexcusable As it was, it was but the recognition of an ecclesiastical pro eminence on an ecclesiastical occasion and an English Roman Catholics are indisputably loyalist-so much so that the Irish Catholics regard them in politics with a certain amount of aversion-a little incident like this might have been passed over by Protestants without raising a question of Catholic loyalty, or making it the occasion for a display of the survival of the old and agonising The incident will not shake the foundations of the throne of England nor diminish the lustre of her Majesty's crown But it may with considerable certainty be predicted that it will prevent any other Roman Catholic being created in the Lord Mayer's chair for a generation to come . . . * . What a clumsy way the spirits have of negotiating business * Taney any body hoping to deal, and introducing himself by pitching stones at the other fellow's house It shows such a poverty of invention on the part of the dison bodied spirit that desires to introduce itself to Mrs Hart at Maclean, that one forms a mean idea of the condition of things existing in the spiritualists' land of shades The intentions of the shot may be entirely upright, but how is Mrs Hart to know that and if the unmannerly spirit had any sons, or its writer were not merely doing, they ought to know that such a roundabout way as this is not be for the man or ghost It is only a sample of the stupid way these spirits act, and during the hundreds of years that some of them have been going about in undress, they should surely have found some better way of talking to us in the flesh than I cooking a table or tapping the floor, or writing on slates in such a surreptitious vi say that we can't be BUTO even that it is the spirits at all At the rate they have been going we shall have com- ' munications opened with our cousins; in Mun I sooner than with a community that from their incarnate experiences must know all about our little ways We have been led to believe that this ' cumbrous body of ours is a clog on our intellect- is the aouY'ttes, but if the removal of the incubus 1 leaves us as shiftless as these sports are, one of i Is to see the advance made by) sit I'lling of? this mortal coil Why, the horse or the dust knows better how to make its wishes and wants Known to its master than those big ridiculing creatures We have heard of many eccentric things done by ghosts, but we never heard before of such a stupid ghost as this one, that can think of no better way of telling; its little story to Mr., HIL I than by heaving stones at bor roof.
