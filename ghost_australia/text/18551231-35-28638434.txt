MEMOIRS AND ARCTIC JOURNAL OF LIEUTENANT BBLLOT.* 1 (From the Spectator.) THE celebrity of Joseph René Ballot is a re- markable instance of what character will effect. His aptitude for instruction was great, and he , made hiswáy from a humble position, to early T&nk; in tho French marine; but his acquire , meats and promotion were not of a wonderful , 3dnd ; many, men haye gained more knowledge under greater difficulties, or risen more rapidly ia worldly position, without acquiring a. tithe of . : his distinction. It was not his volunteer zeal in "braving danger or privations, or even his actual death, that produced his wide-spread fame ; :for > anthe noble service ta.'which he belonged, volun ; . -tary exposure to hardship, risk of life, and death! itself, are.too common to challenge more than a passing notice; and not . always that. * Tko cir- cumstance of a foreigner volunteering to assist in a Search 'after Franklin and his companions; no doubt contributed' to 'the social attentions \- .Bellot received; but'a fashion of that kind/is evanescent, and would, go for little on shipboard, when tho first novelty wasover. Bellot, however,' exercised as much influence over the hardy Bhetlanders and Hudson Bay men as.he did among private acquaintance. To influence a nation,; something more than fashion or personal fascination was necessary; and that appears to lave been the assemblage of qualifies which is ?'. called character, and which procures fame and ? regard for men apart from, any great success, or *{ «ven in snite-of failure and misfortune. The ''r -dUtinguishing traits in Bellot appear to have teen, great kindness of heart, and a large sym- pathy - conjoined with great resolution; and it =. Tías this sympathy which made his death ap. . Widely felt as a cbnimön löss. . The life of Bellet, brief as it was, is not without interest, especially for the example it furnishes '..that the institutions or.manners of the French ©fifer a better opening to humble talentthan exists in this country. His father .was a working ,r blacksmith,^with a family of several children. , Bellot would appear to have reoeived his educa- tion at some public school at Rochefort, where .., tis father lived.; for his teacher, " M. Richer, \- .made, such a favourable report of his ca- pacity and intelligence," that the municipality r, granted the boy.a demi- burse at the College oi ' Bochefort. This involved some pinching on the part of his family to pay the additional charges, »light as they would appear to many ; but the i charges were willingly borne, and they were , Tepaidj not : only in after-life, by the assistance 1 .lieuot furnished to his family out of his scanty means, but by an immediate harvest of prizes. In hiß sixteenth year he underwent a successful examination for admission into the Naval School, «nd agaúvreceived assistance from the Roche fort- Municipality ; his family struggling as before to make up the difference.

Belu-, .vas bow on the -\M¡ himself a Bochefort man : ne perished in Wel ? lington Channel, on the 15th August, 1853. It was a habit of Bellot; from an early period .of life,<to keep > a journal, in yrhich he entered . not only his observations but Ms reflections and àôekngs. ? Of the journal whiib be wrote daring Iiis first voyage in the"Älb»t, 1851-'52, the volumes 'before us principally consist. Upon \- sthe voyage itself, the geojr/áphy of the regions .iisited,^or <he mode of life in the Arctic \- fleas/ttey throw little if any absolutely ?new light. Their interest mainly arises from - their autobiographical and \- national character. The French have dot «ttended so much to Polar exploration as some -other nations, and the voyage had for Bellot a freshness it would not have had for an English «saman. It is, however, his own portrait, un- consciously painted, that gives its main interest 4othe journal. Prudent zeal ssd resolute de- termination to do his duty continually appear, Hfiagled with a -little of the Frenchman's self . demonstrativeness, The buoyancy of spirit which makes light of recurring hardships and . dangers, and the firm will that refuses to be j. downcast by physical ailing or unusual perils, but renders -the mind master of the body, fre $¡ quently-occur, BS well as the writer's strong i *''family feelings. With these biographicaltiaits are interwoven pictures of scenery and the usual incidents of an Arctic voyage,' together with ob- servations and .reflections ,on various matters. Exploration in those regions is probably at an «nd for some time to come. The following v ; remark, therefore, has no direct bearing, -though\ strictly correct; _ for nearly i all the great discoveries in those .regions have been made on foot, if not exactly *""by4and¿ It hits a blot in our public system,-a rigid not to say a blind adherenoe to mere t . routine, and an official determination to ignore whatever does not come with an official stamp ; ..though the Hudson Bay Company are not quite *o secret as Bellot supposes, and one Govern ^raent expedition was planned to proceed over '..«the Polar ice. The most erroneous notions ara entertained in \--'Irsnce as to the information possessed by the English Admiralty., Tba HudsonBay Company, which make! » mystery of all ito operations, will not allow anything \- .töjhe published respecting the m saner s of the tribe* . in their territory, their resources, or their mode oí Smelling. Whether it be that the Government ha» . .¡not asked for such information, or has received it in ^ ifo incomplete form, notons of ila naval expeditions îias possessed the means of travelling by land j and it \- is not surprising that each of them hes produced so little, since their season of operations has, of necessity, been always restricted to tko very short time for which they were Eupplied with.... necessaries : besides, even in summer, the»K men, spoiled by a winter passed by . the fireside, . did JjiJBOt accomplish all that might;f »?e been expected of %em. In writing down these reflect ions (os to which Wutors will slsow^ae how far I am in the right-), I Xthink I aV*£ ¿ed by a feeling of hostility Vn rivaJ^vTu'n8n^Ätruok.by tho facts.

' The vessel is describe^ as1 carrying |no intoxicating' 'drinhs ; from which,' however, spirits as a medicine must be excepted, and lucky it was that they were taken. ? Bellet j notes at the beginning that his own health suf- fered from the absence of wine... The excéssive¡ r strain upon the faculties could not be well sup- ported-without some stimulant; especially in! the1 j absence <of sleep. 20th August.-Still now ; but lt is all the «ame tai us how. We have at last found the passage. After having run into the entrance, which was but badly marked; we came upon a chain of flakes which allow us to get to the other side. ' ; This lut navigationis dim cult enough, and requires a sort of knack only to be , acquired by practice, for we move through a fog thick- ened with show. It is at such times that the ice master's duty becomes fatiguing : ours has not closed an eye for thirty-six hours', and will hardly be ai liberty till to-morrow. It appears that tba masters ol the whalers sometimes pats two or three days without rest. Hr.; Leask regrets that he has not n little brandy; and ,I believe that the excitement he hu need of can only be given by that remedy,- at the ex- pense, it is true, of health subsequently. And airain, on the 28th The forecastle prêtante a petition for an extra ration of brandy, although they^re not entitled to it ; but they allege as a pretext that the, provisions are not of anon good quality as respectable English sailors have a right to expect. This petition aloses, in the usual way,' by assurances of the deepest respect. Mr. Kennedy asks my advice, and I think that'they may be satisfied without danger : to refuse, would be to expose ourselves to ill-will on their part, although I am convinced that they have only obeyed a prejudice ; for there is amongst them more fear than liking for spirituous liquors, ; It .became' advisable on other occasions to have recourse to stimulants. Still the fact that a whole ship's, crew could sustain health in the Artic regions'without regular rations of spirits or beer is a strong argument in favour of tem- : perance. It must not be forgotten that the crew were of-strong constitutions, hardened by habit, and accustomed, it would appear, to re*, .frain from stimulants, -as well as to eat largely of animal food, ' , Mr^Kenhedy/wasa veryi religious man as well as a teetotaller.

This morning, I had for the first time a pretty sharp religious discussion with Captain Kennedy. We plied each other iso bardi that we ended in very bad humour. He believes in revelation ; for him the Old and the New Testament sra of the asms authority, and flow direotly from the Deity. This I cannot admit. Alas!, I have?.not faith, and my rebellious reason revolts against what it cannot explain. I admit the New Testament as inspired by the spirit of God; but I do not believe in the Prophets, in the Holy Ghost, or at least ia th« latter otherwise, than as a symbolic: figure. What is to be done? My con- science tells me I am not wrong ; I know, wall; that, in seeking to extraot from all systems what is good in them, I should not be supported in my discussions ; bat, ma foi ! I cannot help that ; I yield la the cur sent of what is passing within me. I ; perceive that in < politics and in religion one has friends only on eondi tion of making certain concessions ; but what I have not, never shall have, nor wish to have, is the spirit of seot : I shall never be aol« to sacrifice, my interests to my sentiments. It is her« I recognise the omnipo- tence of free will-the only real freedom-the only one worthy of man. Why should I attach myself to doctrines which offer me no complete certainty of truth ? No, I will never lie to myself, and my mouth shall never tsy yes when my heart says no. I will ayoid among foreigners, as I do in my own country, putting forward, even my convictions, whenl know well beforehand that few men can be convinced, or will listen to anything but what they like to hear; but when I am questioned I will reply at all hazards in accordance with my conscience. I have hitherto experienced that whatever relates to metaphysics-to abstraot subjects-cannot be demon- strated ; one must believe, or not believe. In short, all I could say may be summed up in one short phrase ; either a man has faith, er he has not.
