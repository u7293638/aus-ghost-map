ALLKTHE HORRORS. .. (From the Daily Ketch.) The ambition frankly avowed by The Fat Boy has in most ages been yielded to by novelists They have wanted to make our blood run cold and they have succeeded But what raises the hair of one central- . tion does not alarm another generation at all. Mr. Saintsbury, in " Tales of Mystery," offers extracts from the curdling romances of Mrs Iíadclülo, Maturin, and Monk Lewis Ihoy frightened our great-great-grandson (it is a shame, as Oldbuck ) says, that we possess no shorter word for an ances- N Cross we have such frequent occasion to Bpu ik _ of), but they would not alarm an infant of to-day Will the time arrive when Sheridan Lo Tann ceases to terrify, and when the " Life and Death of Thrawn Janet," as recounted by Mr Stevenson, will merely provoke a smile When the law yer and the butler are outside Dr Joykll a door, and hear something ouring within, no chad- , der, but we never shudder over poor Mrs Radcliffe's corpses, polls, moukB, draughty passages, Bcarlot curtains, and tout le disablement, as Mr Saintsbury flip Grantly quotes the French idiom What causes this lack of emotion P If we are still agreeably alarmed when the dead Janet walks through the house in the ' Town " and sultry stillness of the black summer midnight, if we look cautiously around as we peruse "Uncle Silas," if, cr hypothesis, we could be frightened, why do the old authors and horrors only bore us" It is certainly not a fair chance that they have no extracts Mr Saintsbury, too, is an unsympathetic, sceptical editor, he is not terrified, he neither believed nor trembles Doubtless the "Mysteries of Udolpho" should be road, late at night, by a waning candle, in some such r castle ns Glamis or Diuivogan they should not be read in a railway carriage, and by way of extracts Yet, with all advantages, the shudder has departed from Mrs Radcliffe Born in 1704 and busy with novels only for seven yours, Mrs Radcliffe Mit a fashion's fashion of which " 1 Benkenstein " in earnest, and "Northanger Abbey " for divorce, are the most permanent fruits Monk Lewis followed the fashion Matunn followed it Byron began a novel of the terrible, only a chapter was finished, but that sketch is worth all that the Radcliffe school ever produced No one who has read it forgets that excellent opens i ing, the dying man, the Asian solitude, the mystic bird with the serpent in his book among the tomlin Mrs Radcliffe's objects are familiar- She always has a vest, black, winds, Italian castle, peoples by bandits She always had an innocent heroine The innocent heroine's candle ^ is constantly blown out in long dark corridors w hero doors clang and voices whisper, and bats flit Them are curtains concealing nameless horrors, them in blood dripping from the walls, there are monks, and oaths, and the Inquisition The heroic constantly faints, or loans for support on things in general Tripod lamps hang from the vaulted roofs and mouth-old courses weeping tears of blood are standing here and there against the wall Yet we feel 1 more than usual calm " In Monk Lewis's book the Bouco appears, hoarse with a bad cold, and does not inspire any emotion but ridicule and contempt All the moving panels and working pictures and secret passages, and wax figures, and the rest of it, are quite played out and obsolete Yot Scott said Mrs Pndcliffo" should never be mentioned without the high respect due to genius," and Mr Saintsbury aces genius in Mation Is the appalling then so evanescent? Is Mr Kip- ling's " End of the Passage " really a feeble piece of f cautiousness, and is there nothing to curdle the blood in Sheridan Le Pine's " Green lea P " Will the day come when the " Talk of the House of Usher " can be dismissed with a weary smile V I literature is so much a matter of fashion, of the sentiment of the, hour, that we cannot answer Then questions In 1820 people were already laughing;?, win to their ancestors had wept over Mackenzie b " Man of Feeling," just us they were shocked, when) their fathers had been deeply impressed, by Mrs Aphra Helm Yet we may urge that Mrs. and child does not do his spiriting well him Flinn] s from the actual supernatural, she explains her horrors away, blue protract the agony, and while something very awful is forever going to occur it not or does occur The fact ounto character of Monk Lewis has suffered from the scepticism of the ago we may say but then he is still awful when he comes to "Thrown Janet " May we not urge that, in the case of Mr Stevenson's story, the affect is produced by an imagination which restores historical fact i Doubt- less, The Black Man, " The accuser of the Brethren ' never haunted a Scotch manto, nor made spoil of a paralytic old housekeeper But it is certain that the Cameronians and their descendants behaved in all this All this was true for them. Mr Stevenson's art makes the people of the parish live before us , who are not the minister so that we can behave in him and skin of his emotions ho produce in our minds the atmosphere and spiritual effects of a night of horror, so that we are reborn into the seventeenth century, info a village among the hills, and we feel what its natives rolf T\o\v mother Mrs Radcliffe nor Monk Lewis nor Maturin can thus call up the past again, and make us Sympathisers will become, of Emulator "the Wanuoror," who, by the way, falls into extreme cold in a moment The whistle of the ape, Major Weir, in "Wandering Willie's late," in more dreadful than all the corpses and veils, and clanging doors of the Castle of Udolpho Nny, Vernon Lee has made a more horrible effect by showing us no ghost (in " The Phantom Lover ") where we expected a ghost than she could have done by turning looeoawholo cemetery of spectres Monk Lewis, Mrs Radcliffe, and the rest, harped too long on one string They weakened expectancy, and Lewis was infinitely too cipher with big Lucifer His Prince of Darkness won not a gentleman Time these Authors have lost their vogue and their grip, but the odd, inexplicable thing is that they once had a grip on readers Perhaps the wolf tings of taste are inexplicable, and perhaps, in a generation Poe and Le Fanu will have lost their spell On the other hand, The Confessions of a Justified Sinner " by the Ettrick Shepherd, note failed to terrify his generation A of the book had the spell and whoever cares to exhume and read it will admit that the Shepherd is still able to " gave you a' gi ne," as he would have said himself But his work would lose nothing by abridgement, and why should not Mr Saintsbury add this curious little masterpiece to " The Pocket Library "
