Some time ago (says the Townsvillc JhtllC' , (iii, of the 12tli iusi.) we slated that the Minnie Young was many days overdue at Townsvillc, and that fears were entertained for her safety. Since that time no news has been received of the missing boat, and it is generally believed that she has foundered at sea. The .\Jinnio Young left Newcastle, Now South Wales, on September 22, under the command of Captain ALTvouzie, with a cargo of coal for Townsvillc. From the lime she cleared her last port no tiding; of her wnor eanouis na\u ueeu luriuicuiuiiig, ami ji< is therefore conjectured that she was lost in tho heavy north-easterly weather Pre vailing about the middle of September. Captain APKenzie was an old identity of Townsvillc, where he leaves many friends to regret his sad fate. , The ship's articles show that there were on board, besides Captaiiq APKenzie, Henry A.

LIZARD. I f.M.S. Lizard, from New Guinea via Queensland ports, en route to Sydney, passed Woolgoolga at 9.30 a.m. yesterday. THE ( ! E R Al A N- A USX HAL I A N LINE. The Krlangen is the' next steamer of the above Jine to arrive from Hamburg. She is due on Thursday. On this voyage she lias departed from her usual custom by coming out via t he Gape of Good Hope instead of through the Suez Canal, and also by making the trip without any passengers. 'The pre sence of the cholera in Hamburg when the steamer sailed induced the company to send her by the longer route in order to save the time which would be lost in quarantine in the Mediterranean, and that (Ids course was justified is shown by tiie tact that .she is onJy a few day:; behind the E-scn, which left Hamburg .several weeks before her. Sailing from i Jainburg on Sept ember 15, t he KHangon proceeded to Antwerp, where she had to undergo live days' quarantine, ami after laking in 2809 tons of gem-rul cargo, went on ' to Dartmouth, which was reached on Sep- ! tember 27. The steamer got a clea.u bill of health at the English port and left' on the j evening of the 27th for the long stretch of ! ocean steaming to Adelaide. | Air. If. \V. Henderson, the general agent I in Australia for the Gerinati-AustrMiun Steamship Company, has been advised by cable from Hamburg that the s.s.

During the run across the Southern Ocean, on November 1 the wind increased to hurricane force, terrific seas breaking completely over the vessel, staving one of the lifeboats ami doing other deck damage. ANOTHER RECORD PASSAGE. Record-breaking seems to ho the order of the. day just now, intercolonial steamers, as well as the large mail steamers, doing some very fast work in matter of steaming. Tho M.M. liner Armand Behic, which arrived yesterday from Noumea, made the passage in two days 16 hours. This is the fastest trip on record, ami oilers a good idea of the straining capabilities of this line M.M. steamer. The average .speed on tiie passage was close on 17 knots per hour. The Armand Jjohie left Noumea at- 5.30 p.m. on Friday, and entered Sydney at 9.30 a.m. yesterday.
