^ - ???^Q^^ii^^E^^^ Threfi Ministries in Huccession nave .now been ejected from office without the formality of a . no-ebnfidence -ie-; bate. The second of the series was the strongest and far the longest-lived Government that South Australiii has ever known.- The third, nieetlne £ar Hament one day and receiving i^ Jdls-i missal the next, flitted across the -jsbll- tical stage 'a transient aid embar rassed phantom.' .Truly, Jt WaBiaioiie' sense but the ghost of a Ministry, an ap parition with no real relation to the ac txtallties i ptlife, a transparent political imposture. - Directly- ft cjj^e into J.he light, It* was seek through; and it' never had a chance of attempting the feat of materialisation. * 'in other words, the Solomon Administration lacked from the outset a substantial unity. Its constitution was' mixed, anomalous, and unstable; between itB heteroge neous particles there .was no natural affinity; their temporary alliance was accidental and fortuitous; and the Min istry naturally tumbled to pieces at the first breath of opposition. It never even attained to such an elementary degree of organic coalescence as to be able to make the same appearance or to speak 'with -the same voice to the two different branches of the Legisla ture. Its Conservative and its Liberal elements had, so to speak, each made a start to swallow the other, and what had been unconsumed on the one side was commended to the Council, while the remains on the other were offered to the Assembly. The Premier and the Chief Secretary, in short, contradict ed each other on matters of Ministerial policy. A pathetic appeal was made for a consideration that had not been earned, but it was in vain. Consulting its own dignity, as well as the coun try's interests, the House of Assembly quickly put an end to a dull and unpro fitable burlesque. Poor Mr. Solomon! To struggle so long for office, to succeed at last, and then to have the prize so promptly snatched from his grasp! It is really hard. After making such political sacrifices, too; after eating so many of one's own words, accepting office from the hands of opponents, and paying the price in the shape of a generous recantation of opinions that nothing now can blot out ! A few members just made a convenience of Mr. Solomon and his party, and not enough remain ed long enough by his side to keep him in. Is it not cruel? And yet if it be asked why the Ministry was unable to maintain more than an ephemeral exis tence the answer is not difficult. To begin with its personnel was sufficient to create distrust. There is noth ing in the state of parties to justify a coalition so extraordinary. It represented no principle, un less that principle be the novel one that the Council is to be con sidered in the formation of a Ministry equally with the popular Chamber. Hitherto the principle of a dual respon sibility has not been recoguised. If the policy of the Administration suits the people's House, that suffices; subject to the conventions of constitutional gov ernment, the Council retains its veto on legislation, but at all events the right to join with the Assembly in moulding the Executive has never been acknowledged. What the diversity of the Solomon Ministry was intended to express may be disputed; but assured ly the team was a bundle of incongrui ties and its policy a tangled- skein of compromise. It could scarcely have looked for a j avorable reception in either House. -It seems at best an oc casion for 'sombre acquiescence,' cer tainly not for Intemperate rapture, when a Conservative leader rising to office has to tell his own party that there is nothing for it but to support and carry Liberal measures entirely foreign to their principles. On the other hand, the dominant Liberal party in .the House could hardly be expected to' rejoice at the advent of a Government -which proposed so little of their policy and, even as to that, was not too se rious. Accordingly Ministers were In a bad way from the start. But defeat might have been averted at least for a time had not the declara tion of Ministerial policy on Tuesday left several members with the unplea sant consciousness that they had been 'sold.' What is known as the 'Grain- ger purchase clause' in the programme of constitutional reform was a pretty fair stroke of business sc far as it went. With only a majority of one, however,. Mr. Solomon could not afford to take any risks at all, and nevertheless be took them. He was expected to offer the ? reduction of the Council qualifica tion to £15 annual value, with a vote both for man and wife: He offered only £20; and that not to be the subject of legislation until next year, the ' only concession for the present being the dual vote on the existing qualification.
