[TfiTTTBf.J John Eaynor,. a young solicitor Iir fair practice, had" known Eupert Messent rather well for a goba many years as a Club" acquaintance.- In timacy,: or even sincere friendship, he- ;;; tween the two young men was quite' out of the' question, owing to the' coraplete dissimilarity of then* tastes* and iliqgOiS^tions;-- kTessfent had run OTWibW had yeirf *^^;e^uhsisted" .niainfy ";;on his' debts.

But*he was: one .of those,, mpn whb never seem, to burn their fingers or to" seriously damage their reputatfo^^ihhagh his r mode of life was no tocretWrayona The fact was he was a man of ex tremeiy fascinating manners and ap pearance, -excelling in all bodily exer cises, clever, well;. read, accustomed to move freely in the best Bcciety, and* not, the.,sort of person' to be ignored or cold-shouldered. - ® Eaynor, on the other hand, wars steady-going and methodical; not want ing in shrewdness and worldly wisdom but1 with very narrow interests and-1 sympathies. He devoted himself- to , his profession, with the single' minded purpose of one day becoming an eminent family solicitor. , This res pectable ambition, prompted him to lose no opportunity of cultivating ac quaintances of good -social* status.- . He always had an eye to business, and He used his club as a means of quxefcly increasing his 'connection;' •" He was -prbbahly aftractod to* M-sssentj in the* first instance, by observing the: deference with which he was- treated by older men than himself. When-he* got .to know him and realised his position,' he still looked upon him a *. a possible client. "With his hahdsom i faee .aad figure, hia geniality, and his accomplishments, he might aspire to manly an heiress. Eaynor often sug gested this to him, wit) the hope of securing professional employment fi r himself, if Messent should take his advice. The latter, however, 3eeme'~ " little; inclined to do so; or, at • ^ . events, he professed to langh at ^ g . notion.

Baybor introduced himself and apologised for Messenfs absence as requested. He repeated his friend s invitation, and Mr. Fabian, with some hesitation, consented to remain.

Even. ^leir -Jiair ' add moustaches and whiskers were the same dark tint, though Mr! Fabian's face was more covered and lie was much less carefully combed and "trimmed. But for all this, Baynor flattered himself he should never him self have been deceived. Mr. Fabian's features were not so refined a3 Mes beht's; his face, too, was lined and careworn and had an expression of habitual dejection. ■: It was quite clear, however, that Mir. Fabian had not led sp pleasant and easy-going a life as Messent. He seemed at very low water, his clothes being bid and shabby, and his linen hone of the cleanest. On seeing him in the street, Raynor had concluded, chiefly from his dress, that he. was nob Messent's equal in. the social scale. He now saw reason to alter his opinion, for though. Mr. Fabian's manners were rough and unpolished, he was unmis takably a -gentleman;. Rinding 'his companion was inclined to be reticent bbbufihiihself,^Rkynorcould not refrain, from putting him a . few leading questions, as he thought, adroitly. But he began to suspect he had given offence by his curiosity when Mr. 'Fabian abruptly arose from his chair, threw bis half-finished cigar . into the grate, and took his departure with scantcerfrniony. .' • iMe^eht'kfifan made an-excusetocome into the loom where Raynor was when Mr. Fabian -had -gone,- ..and expressed j bis astonishment at the exfcr-aovdinary J likeness. Raynor rather pooh-poohed it, feeling irritated at Fabian's abrupt exit. He remained until he had fin ished his cigar, and then, finding it was still early, adjourned to the club for the rest of the evening, leaving word for Mcssentwhere he was in -case he felt, inclined to call round. Messent called upon him the next day at his office, chiefly to ask questions about Mr. Fabian, but partly on busi ness also. He wanted to know what form a marriage settlement usually took, and so on—giving Raynor an opportunity of impressing him with his professional acumen. Raynor dwelt as much as possible on this part of the interview; but Messent seemed much more interested about Mr, Fabian. He [-eagerly listened' to what* little :infor "mationRaynor had gathered concern ing ban,, and seemed as keen as ever iabont fdllowingi-up; theicqnaiStaiice. He announced- his intention of calling upon him,"and mentioned his..address, which Hay nor had not previously known. It was in some suburb, the other side of the water—Wandsworth or Batlersea. . After. ;this Raynor saw nothing re'df Messent for a few weeks. He kept a look out for bim at. the club, i hut-A.newly engaged man can neyet: be depended upon at his old haunts.

" Let me tell in confidence liow I am situated.',' , /$It was a commonplace.story;-which need not'be repeated iii detail. Suffice it to say that Fabian was not; his real; name. He was the soiiof a wealthy Liverpool merchant^ who had disin herited him in consequence of his mar riage with a woman of doubtful an tecedents. Mr. Fabian was not very communicative about himself, and Ray nor imagined that bis relatives had more cause for displeasure than he cared to admit. He confessed he had been subsisting chiefly on charity for some years past, owing, as he de clared, to his inability to earn a living. The present position was that the onlyrrelief he could ob tain was ' a sum of money on con dition of his leaving the country for good.t.,;iJ;^._. r { "Messent advises _ine,".-he; said, .^s<»ntepdtedly,^ '-Jind jie,,. has igiaeiT me.ia^etter to.abroad over^therb, so'£T may as well try inV'^k."

Meanwhile, Raynor mads a point of seeing Messent, who soon succeeded in overcoming his scruples. Messent seemed convinced of Fabian's bona fides and integrity, and showed symptoms of irritation to Bavnor's ■ hesitation. The result was that when next Mr. Fabian called, Raynor readily undertook the trust. Raynor had his doubts whether the money would be forthcoming, but, rather to his surprise, a considerable sum was placed in his hands to distribute in weekly pay ments. Before he had sailed Mr. Fabian authorised Raynor, in case bis wife should grow iuipatent, to take a passage for her and her children by a later steamer. Raynor was a little mystified by this direction, but it at least ahowed that his client had no de sire td desert his belongings. Messent; who seemed completely in fatuated with Fabian, went down to Southampton to see him off, and panted Raynor to go too. But the latter pleaded professional engagements, ana from that time he commenced to make weekly remittances to Mrs. Fabian. The lady acknowledged them-two or three times without comment, and then, rather to Raynor's-surprise requested to he informed of her husband's ad dress. Raynor wrote to her with a direction at Venezuela which would find him, and the next morning, on reaching his office, he was informed that Mrs. Fabian awaited him. She was a vulgar looking, overdressed young woman, with golden hair of1 a very artificial aspect. She appeared in a great state of excitement, and fac costed Raynor fiercely. "Where is my htishand?" she cried. "Did yon not get my letter?" in quired Rsynor, who carefully culti vated professkmal^composure. " Yes. What is the name of the place? I can't read it! Where is it?" demanded Mrs. Fabian, in a breath, producing the letter. Raynor told her quietly where the place was. " Oh, then, he has deserted me If cried Mrs. Fabian, violently. " I sus pected what he was .-upSto, when he: pretended he was obliged to keep hiding from the'bailiffs.;. .So/jie has left the country, has he ?" "There is no question of desertion," said Raynor, anxiously, as the lady showed an inclination to demonstrate her indignation very forcibly. "If you and your children wish to follow him, you can. ^svsdH^-engage-your ^passage _to:morrpw;; by the next steamer."' m _ -S- -'-' "Oh! I'll follow him right endugh,J> fsaid Mrs. Fabian^lafter /a stare of astonishment. " Catch* me letting , him get beyond my reach. I'll follow him, and if I don't like it I'll soon bring him back. Why, you've got. a she added, suddenly -pointing ..to 9ue„Jhe had. jusfc 'opekedj* and held in liis hand. "It is nothing of the kind,'1 turned Baynor. It happened to he a' "letter from' Messent, stating that he'had arranged to get married at a, very-early date, which he named, and asking Raynorto; put himself into communication at once with Mr. Clayport's solicitors, ahout the settlements. " It's my husband's writing, I'll' swear,'' cried the woman; suspiciously. " Very odd, your saying that," said i Raynor, good-humouredly. ".It is ' the writing of a friend of your hus band's, who, strangely enough,': bears a ' most extraordinary resemblance.' , Baynor stopped in his sentence, and never finished it. Likearevela tiori, the suspicion suddenly .flashed across his inind that the likeness her. tween these two men was not ac cidental. A. moment's reflection re vealed to him the humiliating truth that he hal been made the tool of an unscrupulous and designing man. ' The woman seated by his side was I Messenfc's wife, and in order to get I her out of the way and secure him- j ; self from future annoyance, he had j [ sought by subterfuge to procure j Raynor's bond fide testimony to the j existence of a double. The depth i and cunning of the conspiracy Baynor ! could not help admiring,'even while he was tingling with vexation and xer sentment. e "I don't fancy my husband has" .gone, to what's-its-name, after" all,"' said fher^womahiJ who"~safc". watching ; P-; >w/, w-' Baynor»thte^:*Messeht?s letter to
