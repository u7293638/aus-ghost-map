THE GREAT SPIRITUALIST CASE. SOME time ago, the world was much astonished to learn that a Mrs. Lyon, a wealthy widow lady, had made Mr. Hbme, a spiritualist, present of £24,000. Afterwards Mrs. Lyon thought better of the matter, and brought an action to recover money and securities to the value of £60,000, which were improperly obtained from her by Home. Mrs. Lyon alleges that before dying her husband informed her that he believed a change would come in seven years from his death, and that they would meet. This she interpreted .to mean that she would die in 1866, but in that year her views on the point changed in consequence of her becoming acquainted with some spiritualists, who lent her books on spiritualism, and directed her attention to the great medium, Mr. Home, who had jufet opened an " Athenseum" at 72 Sloane street, for the encouragement of the belief. Mrs. Lyon was also advised to become'a subscriber to the institution. On October 3,1666, she went to 72 Sloane street, where Home resided/ She was shown up stairs into a room where he was sitting in company With* table, which, directly after the plaii)tiff .liafl stated the case, began to rap a' message. Home said at bqice that " this was a call for the aphabet." .Home, then, by -means 'of the alphabet applied orally; developed the following message iroijr the spirit? 1 of the deceased Mr. Lyon :-J-''My own beloved 'Jape,—I am.Charles, your beloved husband. : I ; live to bless you, my own precious darling; I am witti you always." I love, love; love you." , Thfe' spirit further added, " I have no power to spe&k; more; but I will never leave you more, my own darling." The plaintiff, who was greatly cheered and.comforted by this intelligence, proposed to reward Mr. Home by a handsome subscription, but having no cheque-book with her she postponed the donation till a second interview, when, amongst other things, the spirit^ interpreted by Home, informed her, " I love, love; iove you. Bevery Calm. I will touch you." These interviews approve to have been worth to Mr. Home, or his Athenaeum, the sjims of £30 and £50. At a thirdinterview between Home atid the, plaintiff&t; plaintiff's house, the spirit, with Horde's assistance, communicated the tidings," IloveDaniel," meaning presUmediy'Mi'.'Home; '' he is to be your son; he is my son—therefore ybprs." The table theh ecstatically kicked up its legs, and the spirit continued, " l am happy, happy. In a little time I will tnike'myself visibleto you; ©h,' do not say that the light of other days is gone. I Bin with ' you," or words to that effect; The defendant, Home, furthferinformed her that it was the will pf .the Spirit that she thotfld adopt him as her son, that a friend of Home's named H«ll should be sent for, and that she should produce stock receipts for the sum of about £24,000. Under the influence, as Mrs. Lyoti alleges, of Home's* spiritual power,ifcnd ; ascendancy, she went, on the 10th of October, 1866,totheBjtnkx>fEnglttnd,and theretransferred the sum of £24,000 stock to Home. Shortly after thisHome, at another interview, assured her that itiwas the spirit'*' will that she should destroy her existing wilJ,and make another will bequeathing everything she possessed to Homeland that a Dr. Hawksley and a Mr- Ruder were to be the attesting witnesses: . The-will to this effect WAS soon of ter wanjls prepared for the .defendant by William M. Wilkinson, a solicitor of Lincoln's-inn-fields, and was executed by the plaintiff, and attested by Mr, Wilkinson and Mr. Hall. There were some extraordinary facts stated in evidence. The next expression of I Mr. Lyon's wishes was that the former will , made by the plaintiff should be burnt, and also that all communications from him (the spirit) ,on business transactions between herself and the defendant were tp be put into the fire. On the 10th of December a further transfer of stock of the value of £6,000 was made to the defendant by order of the spirit, as a present for their son on his birthday. In the meantime Mr. Home had assumed the name of Lyon, and executed a deed poll for the purpose, and advertised the change of name in The Times, Morning Post, and other papers. The next transaction was an assignment to Hbme of a mortgage security for £30,000, held by the plaintiff. This occurred towards the end of January, 1867, and in the course of the transaction, which was somewhat complicated, and oar ried out by Mr. Wilkinson, a «um of £3,500 was borrowed by the plaintiff from Home in order to make up a deficiency iu thestock sold but upon a transfer Of-the mortgage debt.,. On the 2 iBt of Feb ruary this amount was replaced by the plaintiff Jto. the extent of £2,290 Bank Annuities, which were transferred into Home's name. Home left town for Hastings in January, 1867, and afterwards for Torquay sind Plymouth, and during these absences his influence appears to have gradually waned, and from the 19th of March Mrs. Lyon ceased to sigrt'iterijelffn 'Uktfog'io him; :<t xvmr affection it© toother* ?> JNp i particftlar data wrafr/signed by ther; plaintiff Sawliefc bill,: affidavit, pr answer.J^Qrh&r; arriving ;i at the, ^fivic^ippi.ithaf} a)^ ii^ll : beehlmi)6se^1up0n',''ana'maae a dupp by Home, "lit 'May;',1867 r shff tfasindUced to ! flayttee-fa&ts; bef&rb;• 1iter ,r pVesent solicitors, M&itt.; Druce, Sons, and Jackson, who told her that she had~been>gis&ije; imposedupon, and advised her to ins£it|i|;e pro^pdings, to set asidp,the tr^stetions, by i^hicfyfye 'had nis^e pier, so much of her :prop^y to Home, j&efore; aptingupkin ihjfa^vicp fgjon agaiucoQsultedjt^ Are there any .spirjtpjipre that jcpbw.ipe!

' He said he had always boracthe name of Home, and produced .hu parents* marriage certificate/ could not explain the "strange gifti" alluded to in his answer. He* then Said—These peculiar manifestations have occurred to mp fromj my childhoods I speak of the displacement of material objects, seeing of peculiar i visions, taken <to be communications with the spiritual! world. : Gould : not explain how tbey ioccurred. Have seen spirits; have conversed frith them orally.; They have called to me in sound** audible to my: ear, and I have talked i to them. Strange - sounds are* heard like a rapping. It does not indicate who the spirit is. We take it for granted, the same as in the nail of the telegraph*-wire, thkt there is «tn intelligence there at the end of it. The language used ' b^ ^fie spirits is exceedingly beautiful,and elevated. The atphabet is slowlyi called or pointed at, and when ajsoudd.is given that indicates that a letter is- to be taken down. [Preised to give a, demonstration, but de>^ cliued ] Some knocks are very loud, some are very gentle. I could not do it. You can Arrange as you please whether knocks are affirmative or negative. I -suppose spirits are as intelligent as mortal/ for speak Jto them as you speak to. any person, they usually spell their names,: sometimes without any . question being aBked. If you wished' to consult the spirit of a deceased relative, and came to me for-the purpose, I should m>t receive you unless you were introduced by a personal friend. I should do nothing at all; The spirit would come of. its own accord if it wjLshedp It would indicate its presence by rapping sounds or by the voice. I j have no possible power. If they wished to come it would be, made known to you.,. The alphabet is the, common mode. The calling &ach; letter precedes the intimation by the spirit. I have been bodily displaced in, violation of ; the ordinary rules of gravity. (I must protest against it Wmg supposed that I am the only person to whom this has occurred.) Chairs arid tables have begn. moved in the same way. I have found a useful result in spiritualism in convincing those whodbtjot befiev@ In ft, of the (i^gii^f tality of the. foul. It is the intelligence connected with these movements that' would convince unbelievers. It is, invisible intelligence by which; these things are done. Some of the things done hayerather.tjbecharacter of practical jokes? • Yes.. , Tarings knocked abput anjl-kriocked agairist persons? Yes. Thesepractie^ljoWs are one side only of the question. There is another and inore elevated side.:.,'PjeEsprs have on Feme occasion^ received U6efql information. <k>n!t, gi m rally interfere with affairs of earth, predictions,.counsel, andadvipe. They (the spirits) Perspps jhfive.r^paved Have never kpown jthemjgivje information in stock-jobbingmptteps; as to travelling apd.health, it has bjepn done in a few isolated,instances.. They usually try to patchjup feuds. ,,There,aw alL.kinds of spirits, as there are on earth. Beoops consulting spirits might and might not be deceived. They wopld have to use their own reason. If a spirit should come and tell me ,tp; cut my right hand off, itstandsto reason it would be an absurdity, and I, «hould not do it. If I hafl a cancer an,d the spirits told me to go, to a particular doctor, I should ascertain,if,he' was good in that particular bi$i?!ch of science. I am, I suppose, in possession of this .gift at prei«ent. The last manifestation I had I really cen't mention the date of— yes, I have had one within the last fortnight. I have not a very good m^m.ory of what, ocpurs at seances. ' No external phenomena occur to me during sleep. I have no recollection of what happened to me in a trance. I do not claim that, beqause jan affirmative answer .is given, the (identity of the spirit is thereby established. Peculiarity of, dress would identify the spirit ,?. No, it would not be the ghost of a dress; the dress as it was on earth, as itismentioned in the Bible., I do.not speak of feeling the dress. I have not seen a spirit for a very Ipng time. 1 have hfUi too. much .of material things to think of. Could . not say what was the last spirit I was in communication with. Would rather not mention the spirit. It was the relative of pome person herepresert. The name was spelt out by a medium. It is simply from a motive of delicacy that I decline to mention the name. I have been in communication with the spirit of my own wife—not in reference to this suit.
