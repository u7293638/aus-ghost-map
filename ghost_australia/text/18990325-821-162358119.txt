POETBI. "TRAUMEBIE." Thy'face is haunting me perpetually. I would that I might stand upon some shore anil write thy name • And every thought I oyer had of thee upon th( .sand, V • ' And let the waves comes softly up, and wash It all away for evert . .. ■ " ~ * And, then! Oht sure a yearning would come pull ing at my-heart For comfort, and at brain for memory. Every flower-face would cry, ■"Ahi .once thou knew'st a face, 'twas dear to thee,". And every willowy, waving tree must wring thy lithe form standing there Before mine eyes. Then stayl and I will be content to see thee ever, Npr ask for speed) of tlice, nor touch of thy dear lianri. » Thou sweetest ghost!
