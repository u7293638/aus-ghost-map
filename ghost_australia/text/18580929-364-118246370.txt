DENIIIY'S TESTIMAONIAL. (To the Editor of the Goulburn Herald.) SIn,-I come, the shady ghost of Deniehy's testi nonial, summoned forth, invoked by " J. B.," from the dark and gloomy realms, where printers' devils lit around! Buried and embalmed my body was by committeemen, who Heralded and Chronicled forth my bright? and glorious? future, drank to my chalth-and thus I died. Your's, &e.;, EIDOLON. The Shades.
