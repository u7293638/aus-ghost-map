RIDICULOUSLY LOW PRICES FOR SOULS. In an article on the Ghosts of Modern j Spiritism the 'Saturday Review' makes the following amusing references to cur rently believed transactions with the devil in paBt ages:— " The devil of the 17th century be longed to a very inferior type. He ap peared as a hedgehog, as/a black dog, as a man in 'black, and' dealt in the smallest sums. Sixpence seems to have been the amount he usu&h;§r:gave his votaries on receiving what ^they con sidered to be their souls, anct upon one occasion he only gave 4|d. at the conclu sion of a bargain. Considering the im provement that has been effected in the condition of the country gentleman and the agricultural labourer, it iB not too much to say that experiences of this nature cannot be contemplated by the most sanguine and most eager as likely to occur again; the sums which will change hands will have to be far larger, and villages in Somersetshire cannot hope to be similarly favoured when the rise of populous towns is taken into considera tion. When the devil was constantly in the midst of the uninformed and the ig norant, there was nothing for him to do. There would be little -difficulty iu finding him employment at the present time. Instead of cleaving the Eildon hills in three, or building rickety bridges across eountry streams, he might be fitly em ployed in cleansing our rivers, and if his endeavours were attended with success, no one would grudge him a local board or two or a corporation for his pains."
