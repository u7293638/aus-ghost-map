It bad come to thi. ; be, a man fn tbe first bloom of manliood, no longer wished tt live. Ui-graoed by hi» own action,, he had an courage to face the world he knewrather would he leap unbidden into .tor-, nity, and bravo the peril, he knew not.

Now, before wa die, let ut talk a little togather. Moralise by th. <w«et, ellvor light of th. moon. Why do you kill youreelf I I do it because I am haunted by the everlsating shadow of past ill-doings, my dead put as you may .ay. They talk of angels woeplng over lost rinuere ; well, they can weep ovfo me if they have nothing better to do. I can't do any weeping myself. I onoe owned a mansion in yonder avenue. Now I ttand under the .tan without a .hilling in my pocket. I saved eixpenoe to buy poiaon, but it must have .lipped out through a bole In my pocket, and I found I had only a halfpenny left. I knew it was useless to buy any with that—a half-pennyworth ot poieos could never make an end of a tough citizen like me, h I walked up here. 1 have that half-penny left. Til give it to yoa for a loan of your revolver, for bad as tny credit Is, I don't want to die in debt to yoa. I'D pot naturally mean. I'll die first."

Re walked into the restaurant and took his .eat at on. of tb. table.. & waiter came to take his order, but be told him he was waiting for .friend. Left to himself, a flood of painful thought* Oatne OTer him. The presence ol his npw acquaintance had banished them for th. moment, but they returned with redoubled foro. when be was once more alone. Ho r«£titted that he had not carried out hi. tamble intention without delay,and blamed 'tbe chanoe that brought th. other wretched man to tb. earns .pot as himself. While painf.lly musing he took up a paper that (ay before him, the "Daily Telegraph," and among th. " Personals " this caught his sye:- " Clarence U Come boms. All will be forgiven and forgotten. Mother is desperately ill,and aek. for you constantly. —Father." What a wild tumult of joy and eotrow stuged through bis heart. Overcome by tbe tide oi feeling, he laid bis bead down on the table,and tears of penitence streamed from bis eyes. Those tears were not unmanly s they washed away the bitter feeling. ot anguish and despair, and left Clarence Mansfield a stronger and bettet man. Just as he conquered his emotion bis new friend entered. He eaw at a glantx that some new tide in the affairs of men bad turned in hie companion's favour. B< •at down and silently placed a pile of money before Mansfield, and then oidored sapper for both without asking one question. Clarence understood the delicacy that prompted him, .nd, touching hie aim, laid tbe {taper before him silently, indicating the notice. "I am glad, from my heart,"said the stranger warmly, pressing the young-man', band as he spoke. " You see, it was well you followed my advice. You will return, «I course J" " Ves, return, and with God's help try to atone for the part and deserve my father*, mercy. And you V " Me 1 Oh, 111 finish my supper and than go back and finish my work. It is no an for its to live." " Mo, yon ehall not Come with me to Ualston. I shall tell my father when ud how I met you. He employs overa bundled men, and yoa are not too proud to work for another man at prewnt, as you bave no business of your own." ttba only answer Clarence received was a hearty squeeze of the band, and in the plwdng eye. of hie companion he saw tears welliup. —' ' ' ' Next morning saw both men on their iyto Datetoo.
