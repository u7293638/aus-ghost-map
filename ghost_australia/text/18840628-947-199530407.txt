' Primiriff '— as mechanical en-; gineers technically term, it— is not,' how ever, confined to steam 'engines^ Honour able members are subject, to the same con tingency, and olsoi require ,'a , certain, amount of., ''.blowing' off' before they are ready to perform their functions in the Legislature. Major Smith , and Mr. Minims, forjinstorice, whoj in additionto the .'. priming' consequent , on a somewhat lengthened period 'of inaction, doubtless' suffer from a want of the, lubricating oil attaching to Ministerial positions, wero (unable, to make any move towards fprword ;irig the Parliamentary work of : the session until . a large amount of, ' latent power' lhad been expended.

Mr. Mirams^ on the , contrary, , proceeded to conduct his operations against the Ministry according tothe old strategic ., irules. He knows the Government position is not to.be taken by storm, but: must, be, approached cautiously by sap and parallel, until.the proper moment conies for .deliver ing the final assault. His attack, was merely a kind of reconnaissance en 'force, intended to make his opponents sh'b w ,their hand. ; I^or, five mortal hours, by the Assembly, clock, did the honourable member who'wields at will. the fierce democracy pf .Gollirigwood enlarge bri the shortcomings of the;Minis try, and their faults-of ? omission. .Accord ing to their critic, the government had not made the Acting^Governor half; loquaoipus enough, and — liorror of . horrors— had ; not devoted even the, smallest of paragraphs to the report' of thei, Tariff- Commission, evolved, if rumour ,be not . 'sadly at fault, entirely out of the depths b£ Mr. Mirains's. individual consciousness. Looking at Mr. Mirams,' and listening to hiinj it ivas diffi cult to avoid ..speculating ? aB; to when the debate would terminate, if only one half of the people's representatives suffered from flux de couche in an equal degree with that honpurable' gentleman.- ;A11 , things, however, must sponer prjater conieto an end, and so little matter was left for suc ceeding speakers, that it.is not much to be wondered at that the1 frditless debate on the reply to the address terminated on Wednesday. ? :' The ' discussion only sorve^ to show that the Government' is quite .as strong as during last session,1 and that the gentlemen anxious to; depose them, arid ieign in their stead, must for some time to come continue to possess their' souls in peace, and enjoy the : doubtful pleasure of hope deferred. .

New S6uth'! Wales neighbour's, will induce tho other colonies to take up the' agitation with Warmth, and o'ns\ire its ultimate success. The Victorian public' owe a debt of gratitude to their ' honours the judgeS'of the Supreme Court for re sisting the effort of 'the 'solicitors 'to' '.frus- trate the riiain objebt of the Judicature Act; whichr is to render 'the' administration of . thelaW'both cheap arid expeditious; ''The'' 'lower branch of the profession'', are'far irorii ' pleased' at' the prospect Jof .their1 profits suffering a' dimiriUtionVaidstrorigl^ ; object t'o'-thd' rule WhiBh fixes' dpsts ,'pri1 the' 'llow'er scale'-i-as';' if-' therG ':were; Buci','a thing-i as'Jlow law 'cHarges-^unles's'j'-the' judge before whom any case is tried makes a speciai'brder to the contrary. They desired to be entitled to levy tho highest rate in all instances, leaving it discretion ary with ' tjio Court to order the costs to bp on tho lower scalp. How mariy barristers would have thp courage, as arule, to mako this application ? By doing so they woul^' be diminishing their own fees, arid in curring tho ill-will of tho attorrioys into' the bargain, and no man, in . these en lightenod diiys, who owes a' hundred ' guineas, will.be found ready voluntarily to take his bill quickly and write four- score.
