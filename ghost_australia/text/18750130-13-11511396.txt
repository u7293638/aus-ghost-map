TENNYSON Ab A LITERARY ARTISTS There are many more subtle touches of autobiography than most readers of Tenny. son suppose in that delightful lyrical monologue which Will Waterproof addressed to the plump head waiter at The Cock hardly Temple Bar And the same remark might with appositeness be made of the Laureate's writings generally It is well known that a strict and nobly self respecting reserve is one of his strongest personal characteristics In these days of tinsel show, and shabby glitter, and blatant self trumpeting the first of living Englishmen of intellect cultivates a wholesome horror of all vulgar licensing all theatrical posturing in print after the manner of Rousseau and Byron Never can it be said of him, as Curran said of the author of ' Childe Harold that he weeps for the printer and wipes his eyes with the public And in this respect he sets a grand example to all his brethren of the literary republic But, nevertheless it is true even of Jenny son, that he pours forth all himself in his verse insomuch that a keen sighted student would be able to draw up a minute biography of the poet in his own very words But then it would be a purely intellectual biography, exhibiting the growth of as true a poet a mind as ever haunted the thymy slopes of LTymettus or drank inspiration from the sacred fountain of Helidon One chapter of such a self revealed spiritual history would be devoted to tracing through the Laureate s successive editions of his own poems those minute and mar.elloustouches silently made, by which he polishes and heightens the charm of a given production until it has reached the standard of absolute perfection He de Us with a lyric, a sonnet a fragmentary epic however short it may be as Michael Angelo dealt with a statue ' Yes, these are trifles was the re- joinder of the mighty sculptor to the slighting remonstrance of the bluff Pope Julius- these are trifles as your Holiness remarks, but these trifles make perfection, and perfection is no trifle The inner principle of Tennyson's literary art is exactly expressed in this aphoristic sentence To him nothing is trifling that helps in ever so infinitesimal a degree to intensify to enhance or to increase the poetical expression He will change a monosyllable a dozen times or alter the position of a punctuation mark, or strike out the real oz of an emphatic phrase again and again until he is satisfied that no further improvement is possible And all this exquisite literary sculpturing as delicately line as the filagree work of the marble screens in the Palace of the Alhambra-is executed without a hint being dropped to the reader Careless or superficial perusal of Tennyson, of all poets is merely time wasted Dis beauties will not display them selves at a first glance His practical genius is Boy as the Naiads that sported by moon light on the flowery banks of cool Ilissus. To be seen and loved it must be Bought out diligently in the deepest recesses of the MUSCB haunts Only after the continuous study of years can the Laureate's poetical quality be duly and justly appraised, even by the most enthusiastic lover of the higher literature for example Will Waterproof-or in plainer words Alfred Tennyson tongue deprecates the habit too much indulged in by over fastidious poets, of touching up their random rhymes too frequently, until per chance their best things are spoiled - . To make me write my random rhymes, Ere they be half forgotten Nor add and after many times, Till all be ripe and rotten. lot will it be believed he could not keep his own intermeddling hands of that most perfect strain of high hearted intellectual jollity, but must needs go and alter one fine image in it In the first editions for in stance, he likened his retrospective moods to an Old Testament miracles - ' Thro many an hour of 8 immer BUUS. By many pleasant ways Like Hezckloh a, backward runs 2 ho shadow of my days But in the latest edition the familiar simile is dropped, and we have in its place, ' Against its fountain upward runs The current of my days For our own poor part we back Ilczokiah's dial as a poetical image all to nothing against the reverted streamlet But of course the poet himself knows best Again, in the same poem, the "barron commonplaces that first ' break to fall and kindlyJJossm ""subsequently break " in -the same Could poetical tracery be finer' But these are trifles The wholesale Blip pressions alterations reproductions, re visions re writings renovations that could be collected from a careful comparison of the successive volumes of Tennyson as they were issued from the press would furnish matter for a volume almost equal in bulk to the sum of all his minor works. When the now priceless small duodenum appeared from the publishing house of 1 ningham Wilson in 1836, the critics of all creeds fastened on it with eagerness and dealt with it in all manner of styles-from the truculent scalping style of Lockhart to the calmly appreciative style of John Stuart Mill Lytton Bulwer, in the New Monthly, which he then edited, was flippant and impertinent John Wilson, in Blackwood, v aa savagely scornful at one time and deeply admiration struck at another Tennyson winced terribly at all HUB dissecting room business One effect produced on the youthful poet was to induce him to suppress incontinently at least a score 1 The Cabinet Edition of Tennyson's Werke, vols. 14 London H.

A second effect was to incite him to make reprisals on his critics Thus, for instance, Christopher North had applied the term "drivers very emphatically to the following little poem - LOST HOPE. " You east to ground the hope which once was mine But did the while your harsh decree deplore, Embalming with sweet tears the vacant shrine My heart, where hope had been, and was no more So, on an oaken sprout A goodly acorns grow, But winds from heaven shook the corn out, and filled the cup with dow ' And the still more disparaging phrase dismal driven to the following brief money - LOVE, PRIDE, AND FORGETFULNESs " Ere yet my heart was sweet Love s tomb, Love laboured honey busily 1 was the hive and love the bee. My heart the honeycomb One very dark and chilly night Pride carne beneath and held a light The cruel vapours went through all, sweet Love was withered In his cell, Pride took Love s sweets and by a spell Did she) {,0 them Into gall, And memory, though fed by pride, Did was SO thin on gall A while she scarcely lived at all What marvel that she died Y In his second volume, published in 1833, Tennyson retorted on Kit North in this style - TO CHRISTOPHER NORTH You did hue review my days, Crusty Christopher , You did mingle blame and praise. Rusty Christopher When I learnt horn whom It came, I forgave you all the blame, Muity Christopher , I could not forgive the praise F isty Christopher The three foregoing little poems have been most conscientiously expunged from all the subsequent editions of the Laureate's poems A second pleasant passage- of arms was held by the young poets with Mr. Edward Lytton Bulwer This latter gentleman wrote a review of the first volume, of a very scornful kind, in the magazine he edited and a second equally cutting dissection appeared in the same pages, from the same pen on the publication of the second volume "We appeal now to allow partial readers," wrote Mr Bulwer, who are not drunk with the Wordswortlnan pap, whether there be any just cause or reason, beside the rhyme, why the following speci- men of Mr Tennyson's genius should be called poetry 0 DARLING ROOM. I " 9, darling room, toy ! earl's delight, Dear room, the apple of my sight, With thy two couches soft and white, There is no room exquisite, No little room so warm and bright, Wherein to read, wherein to write 2 " For I the Nonnonworth have soon, And Oberwlntcr'a vineyards green , Musical Lurlol, and between the hills to Bingen have I boon, Bingen In Darmstadt where the Rhens Curves towards Koritza woody scene J I of never did there meet my sight, in any town to left or night, A little room so exquisite With two such couches soft and white Not any room so warm and bright, IA thereon to read, wherein to write When, long years afterwards, in 1810, Bulwer published anonymously his satirical New lemon, ' he once more fell foul of Tennyson, of whose genius he really seems to have been a little jealous " No tawdry grace shall womatnsemy pen Ev on in a lot of song men should write for men, Not mine, not mine (O Muse forbid) the boon Of borrowed notes, the mock bird a modish tune, The jingling, medley of purloined conceits Outlining Wordsworth and out glitteringKoats, V here all the airs of patchwork pastoral chime, To drowsy eau In Tonnysonlan rhyme Let school miss Alfred A cut her chaste delight On darling little rooms, so warm and bright. With more to the like effect. In a foot- note to the last line quoted the darling little room, is again mercilessly ridiculed in prose By this time Tennyson's wrath was roused, and he retorted on Bulwer tremor dously in Punch in two poems signed ' ApemantUB, which Bulwer never quite got over the two poems referred to will be found in Punch for February, 1810 But both Bulwer s attack and Tennyson's rejoinder were subsequently rigorously suppressed by the writers Space would fail to indicate however briefly, a fiftieth part of the additions and alterations silently introduced into over his two latest collective editions by the Laureate The library edition put forth only a few years ago as he most sumptuous style of typography is superseded by the modest little cabinet edition of which the first four volumes are now before us We shall content ourselves by quoting one or two beautifully characteristic productions which are now for the first time given to the world. The following poem, for example, is clearly autobiographical It may be mentioned that Swainston the fine seat of the Simeon family in the Isle of Wight neighbours Tennyson's seaside mansion of Farnugford, near 1 Freshwater Bay - IN THE GARDEN AT SWAINSTON Nightingales warbled without, V ithlu was weeping Í jr thee , Shadows of three dead men Walked in the walks with me Shadows of three dead men And thou wast one of the three " Nightingales Bang In his woods, The master was far away , Nightingales warbled and sang Of a passion that lasts but a day, Still in my house, In his coffin, The Prince of Courtesy lay " Two dead men have I known In courtesy like to theo, Two dead men have I loved v Ith a love that ever will be Three dead men have I loved and Thou art last of the three. The next poem is also clearly authoress phical - THE LETTERS " Still on the tower stood the vane, A black y ear gloomed the stagnant air, I peered athwart the chancel pane And saw the altar cold and bare. A crop, of lead was round my foot A band of pain across my brow , ' Cold altar, Heaven and earth shall meet Before you hear my marriage vow I turned and Thamm d a bitter song That mocked the wholesome human heart, And then we met In wrath and wrote,, We met, but only meant to part. Full cold my greeting was and dry , She faintly smiled, she hardly moved , I saw with half uncuiiBClouseyo She wore the colours 1 approved " She took the little Ivory chest, With half a sigh she turned the boy Then raised her head with Ups enmore at, And gave my letters back to me. And gave the trinkets and the rings, My gifts, when gifts of mine could please, As looks a father on the things of his dead son, I looked on these " She told me all her friends had said, I raged against the public liar, She talked as if her love were dead, But in my words were seeds of life ' No more of love , your sor is known 1 never will be twice deceived Henceforth, I trust the man alone, The woman cannot he believed " 'Thro slander, meanest spawn of bells And women s Slander is the worst And you, w horn once I loved so well, Then you my Ule will be accurst." I spoke with heart, and heat, and force, 1 shook her breast with vain alarms Like torrents from a mountain source Vic- rushed into each other's arms. We parted Sweetly gleamed the stars, And sweet the vapour braided blue, j Low 1 recites fal ned the 1 olary bars, 1 As homeward by the church I drew. I Ti- ley as appeared to smile, So fresh they rose In shadowed swells, 'Doric porch,' 1 Bald 'an ' silent aisles, There comes a sound of marriage bells ' It is impossible to resist quoting the brief but pregnant dedicatory poem in which Tennyson lays the tribute of his splendid genius at the feet of his wife Nobler words were never addressed by post to the partner of his life and double of his happiness - _ A DEDICATION ' Dear, near, and true- no truer timo himself Can prove you, the he make you evermore Dearer and nearer, as the rapid of life Shoots to the fall, take this, and pray that he who wrote it, honouring your sweet faith in him, May trust himself, and after praise and scorn, As one who feels the immeasurable world, Attain the wise indifference of the wise, And after Autumn past, if left to pass ills autumn late Booming leafless days Draw toward the long frost, and longest night. Wearing his wisdom lightly, like the fruit in which in our winter woodland looks a flower Of all his productions it might well be supposed, Tennyson would be more chary of altering Ina incomparable "In Memoriam," so faultlessly perfect does it seem to be in its monumental grace and moonhko splendour Yet the successive editions of even time superb series of elegies allow numberless Slight touches of polishing and chiselling It is Michael Angelo's principle carried to the very verge of the over-fastidious in art Thus, to take a few specimens at random, the 58th elegy, as it stands in Present editions, was not given in the first edition. Again, in the weirdly wrought picture of the moonlight streaming into Clevedon Church, the poet apostrophiseD his dead friend - " And in the chancel like a ghost Thy tablet glimmers to the dawn ' This is changed to " And in the dark church like a ghost, As So, again the dashing leaf becomes the ' darkening" leaf, the "sacramental' wine becomes the "sacred" wire the vast G on becomes the "great" don, and the " whispers to the vast of space amongst the world that all is well," becomes whispers to the worlds of space in the deep night Nothing is too minute nothing too insignificant to escape the laureate a restlessly improving hand. Perhaps there never was in all literature a more remarkable illustration of the genuine literary artist than Tennyson affords But his works are precious and will be imperishable. He is-by excellence -the poet of his time All its intellectual unrest its mighty stirrings after the true solutions of the enigmas of life, its irresistible tendency towards philosophic scepticism its wondrous achievements in the domains of science, and art, its magnificent aspirations after a truer and nobler life all these are faithfully mirrored in the poetry of Alfred 'Tennyson for the enthusiastic literary student Ina volumes are a most inspiring and fruitful study 1 very fine of them bears the imprint of the true poet, the consummate artist and the model of English chivalry in the l'Kli century
