Ghosts aud Spirits.. Since it is not only possible that persons can return from another world, but that there are well-authenticated accounts of persons who have done so, must we, then, believe all the cur. rent storiee auout spirits and ghosts f By no means, for there is not one of them out of a thousand worthy of the least credence, or could stand the test of examination. They all, in al most' every case, can be explained in a natural way, even those of the reality of which there appears to be little doubt. Fear and an excited imagination will conjure up imaginnry appari tions and spectres. So will a gloomy aod me lancholy temperament. When the PuriiaiiB, of whom gloom aiid melancholy were the charac teristic qualities, became the dominant power in England in 1649, we read that there was a wide spread fear of ghosts never known before in the laud. Remorse of conscience, for great and un natural crimes will, too, bring up unreal spectres threatening punishment or vengeance. The reaj gho6t8 then, in the past, beyond what a deluded imagination pointed, have been few and far between, aHd they promise to be so in the fu ture. Nor is it necessary that there should - be many ghosts, since we have 'Moses arid the prophets ' to direct and warn us, and do not need the spirit of a Lazarus to come from the ' bosom of Abraham ' to do so. If, however, & genuine ghost should appear to any of us which, after all, is possible to ask, perhaps, the assistance of our prayers, or otherwise to warn ue, wo need hot'feei the least nlarm, particularly so if our conscience be at peace with God, for no ghost, no spirit, no apparition, not even a. fancy, can do us any harm or injury unless by God's permission. â€” Catholic Review.
