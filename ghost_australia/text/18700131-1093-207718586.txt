I AT THE:ARCHER-STREET CHUBOHi"-■ _ My dear young Brothers—It is with un feigned pleasure that we have listened to-night to vour Christian..experience arid .contes.ion -bf ,'faith which you hstye made \beforb many wite messes.; and some of ris remenlberwell the.time. when we stood 'in a jtjonerjl ,in which you stand this evening^ fWe' remem-" ■ jber the.timewhehwema^e'the.vcbhfessibn'bf Ifaith before God and beforeBis people.^he; vows of God were upon us, and as ministers of | Christ we feel 'to-night, deeply humbled when, we look at our ; past' ministerial life,'and yriien we. caH :tb' remembrance'how-many-' of ?thepe_ vows and 'promises which: we made' before .'God and before His people have not been fnlfilled_ and performed as they ought'teTKaye beexu. To address you.1; upon the momentous teorkr.tp which youhaVe devoted yotmelves te-mght-is ;no insignificant task for any one of vu$ especially when weare overwhelmed with asenseof onr own unfaithfulness and unfitness for, .this workT But." the sense' of unfaithfulness, of dereliction; of . duty, of neglect in many'particuiars, must not lead us to lower the standard^of'God's'Wbrd^ for ministerial character aiid 'experience.?"Better, ;for us to.confess our shortcomings iand' humble^ ourselves before God, and- seek tb'&mbrid;:and;to' improve, than to lower God's .strndard/pWe"; sympathise'with you,' mydear brothers'} dn^ the ^position in which'you^are placed to-mghtf fOr iwp know fuH well the path m whichryqu^have ;to, tread,, the work yon have, tot-*d,o. in^theLord's 'vineyard, the' temptations' you,will;he subject" ;to, and 'the'trials which ; terial .life—trials ^at.oth^.'^';s^^geni^ow; ;We sympathise with:you, 'and'.'you have.our. most'earnest ahd' hearty wish thaf God's ;blessr ?ing may rest uponyou. Although there may be difficulties in your yra-jr," there are many i promises' to 'suktain you' amidst' all the' tiiab. of life. It becomes my duty in consequence of the relation in .which .1/s'taiid to this ; Church, to address a few words of advice and encouragement to you, and I' shall'endeavor to ; do so on the .subject of. ministerial faithfidness —not that we are" about to. detain you for any. lengthened period. The remarks we have to make will be plain and practical," and, by God's ; help, I trust they may be of service: to yqu-rto.j j strengthen you in this great work;' Let me re-. 1 mind you of the necessity of faithfulness to' 1 yourself, by which. J mean .the cultivation of. personal religion—personal piety. You have | j said this evening, ' before God and. th's people, 'that you have been*"brought to a saving- ac quaintance with Christe^that . ybu', have been converted to, God. And, "as, has "already been 1 said to" you, thisls the'first qualification for* the i work—personal conversion. - r We , recognise no ' man's claim, to ] the ministry, who'is_ nncon • verted. God never; calls an unconverted ; man. to do His work—he has nov" qual ification— no" fitness—he : cannot ,understand ; the. great truths; of religion—he cannot jdirect i others into the safe path into which -he has not j entered himself.., "We thank God oh your, be half that you kno w what conversion .is, and that iy.ou.are prepared to press it on the acceptancel of • those to whom you preach. T Cultivate that grace that has beenbestowed upon you, and cul tivate and • strengthen all the gifts and graces of | • the^Holy Spirit. You believe in the doctrine-"of j Christian, perfection—-you believe in the doc i trine of maturity in grace. Let me urge "upon ': yon to'seek after this. ; Let it" be the great puiv jsuit of your life to Teach?that; standard, that | ni ark of perfect love, that holiness, that inward i piety, that sanctification!of nature,' thought, and motive which will render yon more useful in the Christian Church, and morehappy ln'the* work of the ministry." , 1 Need I say .to you that you must urge on God's people 'to this state of holiness and 'piotyl?. - We, as- ministers, are called to- -be ' examples—to ■ stand in this respect before our people as those that are in the enjoyment of greater holiness, than those to whom we preach.. We are to urge God's people to press into the Canaan of per , feet love. I trust this will always he "your en •• deavor. Cultivate a spirit ..of holiness and | i piety, and .urge it upon others. .Then let me : say to yon that y ou' are called, upon to be dili gent in your studies; and> whatever knowledge you "may acquire, make it subservient - to itfie great work to' which you' have'devoted your lives. Is there any knowledge you may acqmre that cannot be used in the Christian religion? God expects us to cultivate our powers, im prove our minds, husband our time," thus seek ing to know Him and understand. His worki, that wejrnay be the better able to" expound His Word, and urge upon those to. whom we preach ] the great doctrines' of . our . holy Christianity. You are not only to be diligent students study ing God's Word' aind reading - proper hooks, but to be painstaking in your pulpit preparations." You are to be faithful io yourf selves; ' God holds you" accountable for the ini provement of your minds, and if He has nailed you to this great work he expects you tomiake due preparation for the distribution—shall I say—ot the bread of life. He expects you to provide a portion for all thoke to. whom you minister ; which cannot be 'done by studying J only, but by prayer "and meditation. . We'-are! not to go before His people and give utterance I to sentiments we have not well weighed. He expects us to give them principle's? we have well'weighed and of the 'truth of which we are satisfied. -Prepare, therefore, for the .pulpit. A. man .that" is weak and feeble in the pulpit will be weak elsewhere ; therefore endeavor by properly husbanding your time to prepare for fi.~ nr -+a secure that for which you are called into this ministry. You are also called upon to' cul tivate the spirit of prayer and the gift of j prayer, , for you have to lead the devo tions of God's people—to lead'them, ah, to lead them to God—to lead them to-the foot1 stool of Divine merby—to lead them to -the great_Mediator.; ?ahd if you are; to lead :the devotions' of God's people aright, you must cultivate the spirit of prayer and Uhe gift" of prayer. And our worship in His house should be free from all formality; there must not be the worship of lips only, butalso of hearts.' Be sure that you avoid that homiletic or spas modic style of prayer that is so common in onr day. I mean the preaching to God instead of praying to Him.' He expects us to pray in the great congregation, and to address Himas humble suppliants. , Cultivate that proper style of address to God—simple, plain, humble language—the laugnage of the penitent—the language of-the pinner when infinitely blessed; ;aiidlflt .your prayer be comprehensive hilt noi Iwear^mej; and let there be fervor, earnestness, 'and "faith in all the petitions you offer to God. fTbisiifaithfulness to yourself. For your encour fagembnt'in this duty let me say to you that you hayefprbmises of help in prayer, far supe rioTvlto'any forms of prayer. You have the promised help of the Holy Spirit. "We are not here to condemn all forms of prayer—we do not generally use them in our public worship; but m their-'absence ;y.ou;-.have something far more important andcertainto restupon—the promised help of the Spirit. - Did not the Lord promise His Spirit to the apostles? and the promise is as valid now as it was -when made to them 'and as";sure as the Spirit came: down, and sat upon , the heads of the apostles like .cloven ; ton trues - of fire.: ahd'as sure "as- it came down •upon the first Christians/ so surely will it come •down upou you if you wait upon God in prayer, jnot only,day.by_ day,;but especially yrhen your Iare going,to minister to "the great congregation .. will your . services -, be acceptable, to . God .and"beneficial to'"His' people; "'"You [have to-night declared" before this con jgregatioHitbatyou are paoved by 'the Holy iGhost..;We belie'veyou—that youare moved •by, the, Holy Ghost to take upon yourself this fwork and'oflSce" of the; Christian ministry. It is {well for.ypu that you feel such is the case. You twill havje often in tlie future, to : fall back upon jthis great'truth. : You'will mahy times havlHio Irevert to the.impression received by the indwel-~ fling of tlie Spirit, and yOu will many.times have, jto look back to. this period as well as to past {periods un ' your/ hfe "that_ jyou. niay_ gather 'strength.; and/ encouragement in your future •trials ahd 'discouragements. That Holy Spirit {who has - moved your hearts, to this Christian {work will, we believe; abide, with you. The {Church .believes youare eaUMf-having set. you {apart'for the work of the.ministry by the im- " ■jP'dsiiibri of hands—the hands "of the anhisteni - ,or bishops of this Church. Let me say'"that {while we do not use that; term, we believe that [all true ministers of Jesus Christ 'who have [been -called by- Him -and- have charge of any [portion of "the; Lord's flock, and' administer' .the holy Sacrament, are truly and properly , [bishops in the Christian: Church. You have, ;we say j. been.thusset apart,, and now you have |to be faithful to your Lord—faithful to Him in [your teaching the great truths that He has [commanded. -: And here let me say. that the in-; {spired Book of God is our: book of theology; [we acknowledge "no other source of Divine truth • ibut the-Biblev' This is our standard. Sometimes [men speak of -us as if:: we regarded the writings, {of Wesley, Fletcher, and Benson as on a par •with the t&obings; of Scripture; and they speak [of our creed; But our. creed is in the Bible, [and I urge you to shun every system and doc ;tnhelwbich:canhot[he proved byithe Bible to be {of God. "When we speak of our standard books 'and writers,-.all tha,t we mean is that we believe ■such inen have{ymtten;truths which are in har-; mony'-ritii tke tea&limip; of God's Word/. ;Bre-, jthren, allow me a yrord with you how with regard , |t^t£fia«ni|ati^a-^ speculativejspiritof! the age Has found its way into divine things. [Be. iupon jyour guard against the introduction of novelties into [the /Christian religion. A man {might read a book upon speculative theology .without, injury; but when a man imbibes the {sentiments and becomes speculative himself, {he is-likely to introduce the subject to [the attention of/the congregation .to whom he preaches,- and it is probable- ;he may b'e^the means of creating doubt, and affect-: ing the belief of some individual; and if by; jenunoiattng -any .speculative theology or : dogma^youjihOTld instti into the minds of any of your people that which, led them to doubt, 'and from doubt to unbelief/ and then to Hell, [God - will :deiiiahd their souls at your hands. .{Take care'that Tyou observe the ancient land-" '•marks, that you walk in the eld path, and [take heed tof'-''the'; warnings which you find [ • distinctly written •.•in.:. God's Word, and keepr toT-thegreatfundamental doctrines, of l-our holy'religion." You are' to be faithful in :explaining {these doctrines—such as the de«, ■pravity 'of: the Human heart and the guilt of {man, and""his" "exposure to "punishment/ the iwork -bf the Holy Spirit in : our regeneration, land the justification of the.soul before God by | faith alone in the precious blood of Christ. Thenlet'me/ say a great deal of your minis try, [must be Christ—Christ in His divine.nature in; [opposition to the doctrine which is designed to jrob Him of His gloiy—of His Godhead. . You are to preach Him in His humility, in His in ! carnation, -.in .His suffering,- in His death; and {this is to-be the g^eat aiibjedfe of your ministry. ; All .other/subjects/ seem to converge to this. •Allother doctrines you" will find" to emanate {from this great truth, gnd^.therefore preach j Christ as the. apostles prSiched :Him. [ Take ;Patd- ahdiis sbn_Tlmbthy_as/.exaihples in this {matter—" "We preach Christ crucified." And 'though, other -men may"delight in preaching !other subjects,'the great tbembof yom? ministry 'must be the Lord,of Life and; glory; presenting :Him before the people-as-fhebnly Saviour for .•the sin 'of - the world; 'presenting Him as, the : great High Friestrhqw 'before the- throne of God{ [making intercession for man; and offer Him ad • a Saviour able.to .save to the uttemost-all-that , [comedo' God/by-Him./. Now there are many j other subjects which must be embraced in your |ministry.

If there be wan derers from/ Christ you must try to restore them. If'there be sick in the Church it is your duty to visit them." You are" to be the pastors of His flock. As far as possi ble visit the people committed to your care; you know not the influence you may thereby gain. To, be faithful to your chaTge you. must especially care-for the young—they rill need encouragement from yon, and to be instructed at your ■hands;.. Let them: have a word in your public ininistrations, and let them always have a share in youi prayers in the House of God/ and. let themlhave a smile from you when you meet them in their parents' houses ; and s-3 showithe children that may be committed ^to y-f5ur care that you have an interest in them. IViost ear nestly and devoutly do I pray God to help you in this work—that His grace may be sufficient for you." I trust that there is a bright and_suc cessful future before you. . May the Spirit of God rest upon- you, and may He make you able, preachers of the New Testament. You will shortly have to take our places. May the Great God whom you serve qualify you and fit you to serve His Church, and may the congre gation now present lift up their hearts to God for the descent of His Holy Spirit upon all Christ's ambassadors—that* we..may. _dq the work He has given us to do, and that ministers and people may at last be gathered around His throne.
