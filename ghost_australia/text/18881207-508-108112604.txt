'Some One Iiad Blundered.' An amusing incident: occurred in the Assembly last night during the discussion of 3 point of order. 3Tor some unexplained reason the division bell commenced ringing, and members came trooping in from the re freshment-rooms only to get well laughed at bv those who were in the chamber. Mr. Copeland/fin a jocular strain, moved ' that the ' ghost ' be brought to the bar of the House to explain his conduct; but the ghost, not being inclined to allow himself to be caught, pro bably turned himself into an 'electric current' and vanished into space.
