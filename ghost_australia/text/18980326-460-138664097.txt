MISCELLANEOUS WORKS. The voluriie entitled "Real Ghost Stories" (George Bell and. Sons), which reaches us from George Robertson and Co., is a re print of Mr. Stead's Christmas and New Year annuals, pfjjb^hed six years ago. As sensational .literature it is highly readable, but if Mr. Steafl^ desires to be taken seriously,' his treai&ent; 6f the philosophical side of the subject is hardly adequate. TIi6re"Is"a"great "Heal "t>T "assertion resting a .tendency to make confident dogmatism play the part of reasoning, and confusion instead of dis tinctness in the tteories propounded.

The young lady who has airily assured Mr. Stead that she goes about in her "thought body" clotlied as the fancy takes her, be cause "there ate astral counterparts to all our garments,'!' has not substantiated her statement directly to the author. Her ap parition in hief study is postponed. But her cJaimjB nevertheless gravely admitted fco print on the evidence of others. It is BO with the majority of the eerie collection of experiences! included in tliq book. We are assured.in.the usual manner that they can lH! substantiated- yet they are not. "Real Ghost Stories" is, therefore, reading for recreation more tlian for reflection, aud deliglitfully tbrilling entertainment it will be found by jthose who half-share Mr. j , Stead's vague theories about thje unexplored !
