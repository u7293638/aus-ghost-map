I did not speak now , but I suppose that I looked at the papers very w usefully, for Robert glanced at me with that unused expression which I knew so well and, to my delight, said "Yes, you may if you like, Persis " " Oh, you do ling 1 ' I cried "Now divest yourself of alluvial feelings (if such a thing is possible to join), and trans for in join self into the sea n ei life for the lime " He is failed mc a limousine ipt as he spoke It consisted of some poems, and a short tale I tried to be sev- ore and of life is, but it would not do I got interested in the tide, and sev city and criticism were lost in action action of the story and its author Before I had finished it I became aware that Robert was telling up unmercifully I passed in my leading to remonstrate with him, but he was deaf to my entire lines to let me just read what he wished to destroy.

" It is true, I believe, Robert. I fancy that I could face the most ghastly of ghosts better than I could face debt." " But we are not going to face that," Robert said quickly, almost sharply. "We will at least keep out of that. I will find a way to escape it somehow." " I daresay we shall We won't frighten our senses by conjuring up such 'bogies'. "What do you say, Persons, to making this evening a holiday, as we can do no more until to-morrow ? Shall we have a stroll ?" By allnieans,"Icricddelightcd;so wcAvent for a long ramble through the streets in the I dusk of an early April evening. By 10 the next morning we were at Lincoln's I Inn, searching for Mr. Atkins's offices. We found the name at last, and were ushered into the presence of Mr. Atkins, but not him whom we sought. Much disappointed, have learned that our aunt's old friend had been dead four years, and that the quiet gentlemanly man, our informant, was the deceased Mr. Atkins's nephew, and had succeeded to his uncle's practice. Robert briefly gave his reasons for Avisli ing to see Mr. Atkins, especially with relation to his hope of obtaining, through his interest, some employment. The nephew listened patiently, and asked several questions, all of which Roberts was able to answer satisfactorily. We had also brought with us some of the letters written to our aunt by Mr. Atkins, as further proof of our identity, and which we now produced, upon which Mr. Atkins expressed himself to be quite satisfied that we were the people have professed to be, and told us that his uncle had often spoken of our aunt and of ourselves with expressions of great interest. Roberts. asked Mr. Atkins, a little timidly, whether he could give him any employment in his office, adding that he did not mind what it might be if he could only give satisfaction. Mr. Atkins shook his head. He had no vacancy for a clerk, nor was he likely to have one he had with his uncle's clerks, men who had been with that uncle many years, but who, Mr. Atkins averred, should never leave himself but by their own desire. Although our hopes were destroyed, ave could another)) column Mr-. Atkins for his resolution, which he expressed quietly and firmly, and as though such a thing was a matter of course. But he pondered a little, then turned to Rober"t suddenly, and asked for a specimen of his handwriting. Robert write a few lines, which Mr. Atkins looked at, then rang the bell. An elderly man entered, whom Mr. Atkins tool: apart, showing him Robert's writing. We could not hear what was said, but when the old clerk retired Mr. Atkins told Robert that he could give him partial, if not full employment in law-copying if he liked to undertake it. \- Robert joyfully accepted the offer, and warmly thanked Mr. Atkins, also looked quietly pleased, and told Robert to call the next morning, when he should be initiated into what little it was necessary for him to know relating to his new employment. "Could not I help? I whispered into Robert's ear. Mr. Atkins bears me. "I am afraid not," he said. "Young ladies' writing is not exactly adapted for law-copying ; it is" "All hearts and tails and flourishes, in general, you mean, sir," I interrupted laughingly. Mr. Atkins smiled and bowed. " But I can write almost as legibly as print," I said (I was thinking of the copying I had done for Robert "and I avouIiI practice writing until I succeeded, if you will permit me to make a trial. Mr. Atkins looked a little ministers, but doubtful. " You can try, at any rate," he said " but you will find it very dry work." "I don't think anything dry that you can conquer," I said resolutely. Mr. Atkins regarded me, I thought, with surprise, then smiled at Robert. " Come, Peru's, avo must not, take up Mr-. Atkins's time any longer." We born thanked our new friend, and wished him good morning. He bowed very graciously to me and Robert, and told the latter to call at the same horse sale next, morning. I almost (danced along the streets in triumph at our success. "I can do it with practice, can't 1, Robert? At least 1 will succeed. To think that I shall be able to help earn a living after all I" Robert was as pleased and grateful as I was, only not so demonstrative. I tried to hurry him home so that I might begin to practise. I know that 1 Arroto a clear, legible, and firm hand, entirely distinct, front the usual character- less hieroglyphics of young-laityisiu. I knew that when I had mastered my two ric, is I should do, my help would enable Robert to devote more time to his pursuit of authorship. That day I was so hopeful and happy that I could afford to review the events of our last sad hours at Arbourlaiids, and to calmly think of all the people (some how dear 1) whom we had left behind. How I yearned to see Miss Wolfe and Margot, and poor Maud, avIioiu I pitied most of all, knowing as I did what she must be feeling and suffering on account of Robert. I longed to let them all know of our good luck LUKE well-being, but still determined to wait for their letters first. Then, in the twilight, 1 sat at the window looking into the narrow street and thought of him I recalled him as he had looked and spoken during every meeting throughout our acquaintance, until I came to that last meeting which had been a parting too. The recollection of that always called the blood to my face in a fiery torrent, and, amidst all the strong yearning of my heart for only one sight of his face, one pressure of his hand, I ended by a deep sigh of relief at the thought that I was out of his sight that I was safe from his eyes surprising my poor secret-if they had not already done so. CHAPTER XXV. Timk passed until we were in the middle of June, and still our friends maintained the silence of death. Full of beans, Robert set out every morning to inquire for letters, only to return to share my keen disappointment, which again gradually gave way to the hope of what the morrow might have in store. At last we came to the conclusion that our own letters had miscarried. We would rather believe that Arthur Archer had Avaytaid them, and read them ten times over, than that any one of our friends had forgotten us. " I will write to George Leg and by post," Robert had declared day after day, but I had so far found some pretext for preventing him from putting his resolution into practice. Robert must have written to his friend for references, had have not received ample employment from Mr. Atkins. Robert mastered his work at once; but I mine more slowly, though in the end triumphantly. Between us we managed not only to keep the wolf from the door but to allow Robert time for his own especial work and we had still a few pounds in hand of the money which we had brought with us. 1 used sometimes to wonder amidst all our work (for we both worked hard and amidst our disappointed yearning for tidings of those whom we loved, how it was that we contrived to escape being quite unhappy. In novels such as I had read, the heroine, placed in my circumstances, would have sat all day by the window thinking in mute despair of the absent one, or weeping her eyes blind at her own misfortunes, whereas I keenly enjoyed strolling with Robert before breakfast every fine morning, through the bustle of life and excitement, and among the beauty of fruits and flowers of Covent Garden Market, or in taking long rambles through the city in its Sunday trance, and far out into quaint green suburbs that had once been pretty lonely villages Uko Mtirford, but every now surprised by the encroachments of bricks and mortar. Uno bright Sunday afternoon, as we loitered through Tottenham, I asked Robert why we were not so miserable as I considered that we ought to be under existing circumstances. " because we are together, Persia," he said, looking down upon me lovingly. I squeezed his arm, and returned his look. We said no more, for we understand each other. But not Robert himself knew better than did I how he yearned for news of Maud. I could divine his feelings with respect to her by my own for Mr. Legrand. Nor did either of us forget Miss Wolfcr or Margot. We often talked of them in the twilight, and wondered sadly what they thought of us and our strange flitting. John Weller ave never named. We mutually passed him over in conversation, though not in thought. We had been in London nearly three months, and, with the exception of our visit to Mr Atkins and its fortunate consequences, no occurrence had hitherto marked the tulle. But events generally crowd together. One morning when Robert and I returned from the market we saw Mrs, Grey crying bitterly over her untouched breakfast. She was alone ; so, with a look at Hobart, I went, into the room, and asked in gently if I could do anything for her "No," she said, and curt afresh, but the temptation to cheer herself by speaking of her troubles outweighed the fact of my burn" almost an utter stranger so she told me that her husband's ill health is id prevented him bitterly from causing money independent of the business which did not half keep them, till this morning her other Iotlgu but gone away V owing her money, and that she had a most pressing debt of live ] omits to pay, without a shilling in prospect to any with I said nothing but dr ted up stairs to Robert, to whom I repeated the case "You want to lend her the money, of course, PersisT he said divining 1917 wishes "Yes, Robert" I said hesitatingly "At least, I do not want to do anything imprudent 1101 to urge you to do it ; but I thought that if vic paul hot five pounds 111 scheme for out and lent it would be as blind as it is long " "Yes," said Robert, gravel), if we can afford to go on living hue But I think I hope that we can, and I certainly should not like you to live in less comfortable lodgings than the o Yes, I think we may venture it,' has- ud, deliver ating " Ah, Pel sis, if I hope 11 to}on calculating, instead of generous!) and impulsively helping this poor woman, it is because I wish to be just to }oubcfoio being generous to others " "quite understand yOU, Robert," I cried He fetched the money " Got a receipt for it, Pcisis,' ho stud, as he put it into my hand and I rushed downstairs to Mrs Grey, put the money outhotible before her, and explained that it was on tout paid 111 dv mee She could hardly believe in her Reprieve from hot present pressing anxiety, and did not know how to be grateful enough I took bet Receipt and snatched away from her thanks to rejoin Robert, and we set to work atom dry as dust occupation of cop) ing towards noon Mia Gicy knocked at the door, and put 11 brown paper package into my hands, which had been sent by parcels delivery I took it in with a swelling bent, and!

I mo dumb and cold. In that box, apparently engaged in a most absorbing conversation, were Maud Archer and Mr. Legrand. For a moment the house, the audience, everything swam around me; but the thought of Robert, and the fear lest he, too, had seen what I had seen, enabled me by a strong effort of will to recover myself. I glanced at him and saw that he was unconscious alike of my agitation and its cause. I was afraid that he should see my face, which, however I might try to compose it, he could generally read; therefore I was very thankful! that the curtain drew up, and all took their seats, in the bustle of At night I escaped observation. The last act began, and I knew that Robert would be attending to that too closely to look about him, and I meant, directly the play was ended, to plead headache and hurry mine away. He should be spared a hat I was suffering. I did not know the intensity of my love until I felt the anguish of jealousy which now consumed me, and which, for the time, annihilated all friendship, justice, and common sense. At this distance of time I cannot help pitying myself for the agony I suffered that night, whilst, if possible, I deplore still more that so * mean a passion has power to entirely overthrow reason-as it did mine. I saw the man whom I loved and the woman who was my dearest friend (both of whom I had thought of as far away, and as deeply regretting us) talking earnestly together in a box at a theatre ; upon which I immediately jumped to the sensible and desirable conclusion that both had for- gotten Robert and nie, and were all in all to each other. Now if Roberts had seen them he would have attracted their attention, signed to them to wait for him, and have met them without experiencing a pang of suspicion. He must have had strong proofs of their treachery, or forgetfulness of us, before he would believe aught against them. I thought this as I sat beside him, and I wondered at the difference in disposition between us two, so nearly allied both in blood and in tastes. Was it true that the passions and temperaments of one's ancestors were transmitted unto remote generations? and did I inherit the stormy nature of the Lady Persons whom I was said to resemble so strongly in face and person ? I sat next to a giant of a man, behind whose broad shoulders I could watch, without being myself seen, the two people once dearest in the world to me and Robert. Once? I had not proved that they had forfeited the right to be dearest still, but I asked as though it was so I noticed, with a pang, that Maud had never looked so beautiful. Sim was paler, and I fancied, thinner, and there was a pensive expression in her face which increased its loveliness. I observed, too, that many a glass was levelled at her-ii custom which no glossing conventionality can ever render other than one of odious and innate ill-breeding. Rut Mauri seemed unconscious of all this notice and admiration. Indeed, I doubted if she took any more interest in the performance than I did. Then I looked at him. There he sat, pale, serious, with the half-sad expression that he always had when in repose ; just as she used to look at her two averse together with his house or at Arbourlaiuls. Both had ceased conversing directly the performance recommenced. Although neither apparently cared for the play, each was too thoroughly polite to talk while it went on. They were not alone. I discerned another figure-a lady, who seemed to to wish to conceal herself from view, behind Maud. At last the green curtain descended. I clutched Robert's arm. "Do you mind going now, Robert? I feel faint." " My dear girl, why didn't on speak before?" he said anxiously. He took my hand, and guided me tended ly through the repeated bustle and noise of the audience, until he gained the door. Here I ventured to turn to taken last look at that hated box. They had risen as if preparing to leave, and I noticed with what tender deference Mr. Legranrl seemed to be addressing Aland, who, on her part appeared to reply to him with a manner which implied that a perfect understanding existed between him and her. I turned my head, and, it till my head t full of despair and bitterness, was hurried by Robert into the street. " Stop, we'll have a cab, Persist." "No, no, Robert," 1 cried imperatively, "I can walk quite well. The air revives me. He looked at incautiously. " You have been over-working fit that copying, and you miss the fresh country air. I shall not let you work so hard again ; we must take longer rambles." "I shall be well to-morrow; it was the heat Unit overcame mc. Only I am so sorry to have dragged you away, Robert, before it was all over." " Oh, there is only a farce to come, and I should only have stayed for that upon your account. In fact, I am glad myself to get out of the heat, for my head aches him by much, which is very unusual with me." And when we were in our own room and hail lit our lamp I saw that Robert looked Hushed mut heavy-eyed. " 1 lad be seen them t" I asked myself with terror. Hut 1 soon assured myself that he had not, and neither of us wanting any supper, we said good-night, and I went up to my attic, to give myself up unrestrainedly to thoughts of In richness, despair, Â»elf-liuinihiition. "Should I or should I not tell Hubert?" was the question which all through the night wound up each fresh burst of mental torture, like the refrain of a song. Having decided nothing, I fell asleep when it was nearly time to get up, so that it was later than usual when I went downstairs. But a new shock awaited me, and one which cast even the remembrance of last night into the background. When I entered the room I found Hubert, half dressed, stretched across the hd. He told me in a faint voice that he had tried to get up and dress at the usual hour, biitfelttooilllokeepup. "But I daresay shall be better presently, he said, trying to smile. I had an instinct that he was very ill, that smote me with an indefinable tenor. I made haste to get breakfast, but he could not eat. Then I called in Mrs. Grey, who, after looking at him, said very gravely that he must have a doctor at once. [to a: curious Â».] as
