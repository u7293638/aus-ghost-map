On Thursday evening His Grace, accompanied by the Very Rev; 'the Vicar- General, arrived in Sydney after' a long and laborious Missionary Visitation of three months duration, ? through the Western and South Western Districts of the Archdiocese. Although much fatigued from ? their incessant and arduous pastoral functions, as well as from being nearly broken 'down by the toils and perils attending such long excursions through some of the Avorst mountain roads in the ? Colony, if not in- the British Empire, we are happy- to 'find that the Archbishop and Dr. Gregory are in pretty good health, and in excel lent 'spirits arising from the consciousness of the spiritual harvest of souls made during their late Apostolic travel. Besides the large number 'of the faithful who availed themselves of their ministry to approach the Holy Sacraments : of ?Penance and the Blessed Eucharist, between 800 and 900 persons received the Sacred and Apostolic Imposition of hands, with the sevenfold gifts of the Holy Ghost, imparted by the Sacrament of Confirmation. As liis Grace may in1 all probabi lity give some edifying details of his recent visi tation at. the Meeting of the Society for the Pro pagation of tlie Faith, '? to be held on to-morrow evening in St.. Mary's Seminary at 8 o'clock, we. shall' defer -until our next the particulars of that interesting narrative.
