Twice the quantity of porter already brewed in London in a year would be something like equivalent to the estuary of the Mersey opposite the Pierhead at spring tide. When one of Meux's vats burst, it swept away a whole street houses, inhabitants, and all take an overflow of the Scheldt and that was in 1814, when vats were mere pipkins to what they are now. At Whitbread's, which ranks but third in the trade, there is one of such prodigious dimensions that its twenty-five hoops weigh from one to three tons each, and its contents are 20,000 barrels, being some twenty times the capacity of the Turn of Heidelberg. Barclay's brewery is already ; half the size of Paxton's Plate-glass Palace, and covers upwards of ten acres ; so if the produce of porter be re- gulated by superficial extent of premises, and there is to be double produce next year, the building ought to be fully equal to the Alad- din-like structure in Hyde-park. The firm brew about half-a- million of barrels a year at present, being at the rate of some ten gallons per head, or per month, for every man, woman, and child in London, saying nothing of what the six other great houses turn out.
