VICTORIA AMATEUR TURF CLUB MEETING. FIRST DAY. [By Telegraph.] Melbourne, October 1L [From our Special Reporter.] The first day of the racing carnival of 1885 is not likely to be forgotten for some time, if only on account of the rain. The morning was stormy, but there seemed every chance Of the weather holding up until before the first race, when the rain came down heavily and continued until nearly 4 o'clock. Fortunately for the club the people were on the course before the downpour commenced, so that the attendance was not interfered with, and the receipts were larger than they have heen any previous Guineas day. Despite the wet there were no accidents, and excepting for the long delay at the post in the Great Foal Stakes, everything passed off welL Mr. T. Watson was acting as Starter and he fined all the jockeys £10, while Williamson was suspended for the meeting. Racing began with the Maiden Plate, for which Read'B stable provided a red hot favourite in Jocular, by Emulation out of Gaiety. Nothing else was backed with much spirit, and the books began well, as after looking well to the distance Jocular was very easily beaten at the finish by the Ballarat colt Recall. A good field weighed out for the Hurdle Race, and this time backers were correct in their judgment, as Duration, the favourite, came away in the straight, and won easily, his next dangerous opponent, Mistake, having fallen at the last hurdle.' The fourteen competitors for the Foal Stakes were saddled in the rain, and most of the jockeys ciantered down to the starting-post in their overcoats. The Sydney people made Acme a very warm favourite, but both Maddelina and The Nun carried plenty of money. The start was delayed fully ten minutes, and when at last the signal was given the race was virtually reduced to Acme, Munwyrtina, and The Nun, who were right away from the main body of the field. Between these three there was a very pretty struggle, and Hales had to sit down ana ride hard on Acme before he could shake off .the other two. Once the favourite got infpast the others she held her own cleverly and won with a little in hand by a neck. Maddelina was a length from the dead heat . pair, - but her _ chance was spoilt at the start, as she was left at the post, and could never get through her field until they entered the straight. The good form shown by Acme caused Monte Christo to be made a favourite for the Guineas, but he went so badly in his preliminary that backers of Ringmaster took courage and supported their colt heavily. Dunlop was the only other supported, and he was only befriended in a half-hearted manner, owing to the general opinion that he was short of fast work. The race was run at a good sound pace, and backers of Monte Christo were on good terms with themselves until Robertson took Dunlop to the front at the home turn, when the grey collapsed like a pricked bladder, and was out of the race in a few strides. Dunlop came into the straight "pulling double, but when Ringmaster tackled him at the distance his want of condition told, and Ringmaster drawing away won easily. Dunlop straggled home gallantly under the whip, and saved second place from Eagle Grange. The winner is a small colt to carry Derby weights, but he is a strong little fellow, and made very light of his 8 st. 5 lb. in this race. Directly the betting oh the Hunters' Cup opened Tanglefoot and Narrung were heavily hacked, and before the flag fell the Adelaide horse was in demand, and £500 tp £200 was taken. Abdallah and Spring were the only others supported for money. Gippslander made the running and soon held a lead of 50 yards from Chesterfield and Robert the Devilt all the field jumping splendidly. CroBsmg the treble Robert the Devil took second place, but going along the back stretch Mr. Glasscock began to creep up with Narrung, and at the last fence he was within a length of Gippslander. Both hone and rider were pretty well exhausted, however, and Narrung led into the straight, and though he blundered through the last hurdle he won by six lengths. The winner carried the colours of Mr. Charles Hart, and that gentleman backed him heavily. The followers of Fonlsham's stable served up Sirocco a moral for the Toorak Handicap, and in anticipation of his easy victory they backed him at 100 to 5 for the Caulfield Cup. In the race Sirocco looked well entil the turn, when he died away without being able to make a straggle, and after a good race Mentmore beat the other favourite by a neck, though he had to undergo the ordeal of a protest before getting the race. The following are the results :— MAIDEN PLATE, Of 160 SOTS., added to a sweepstakes of 3 so vs. each. Special weights—3 yra., 7 st. 7 lb.; 4 yrs., 8 st. G lb.; S yrs. and upwards, 8 st. 8 lb.
