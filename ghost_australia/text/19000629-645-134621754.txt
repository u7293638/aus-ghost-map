Nurses in Time of War. Speaking of volunteer nurses in time of war, a soldier says : 'Some of tho nurses aro wise, and some foolish ; some few careless ; most over anxious that their patientB should oat, should rouse- themselves when lethargic, and sleep when inclined to look about and talk ; and all are of opinion that the patient should bo con stantly bathed with water or scent. ' ' Poor fellow 1' one lady was heard to say ,'while tears of compassion stood in her eyes. ' Poor fellow, you are suffering so much I ? it will relievo you if I wash j your face.' ' The young fellow said nothing until his nurse had sponged his face, and then he turned to tho wall with a groan, and muttered : ' ' That's tho ninth lady as has washed my face to-day.' ' Would-be Tenant : 'I like tho house very much, but I hear that it is haunted.' Landlord (rubbing his hands and smiling) : ' My dear madam, I attend to that personally. Tho ghosts only appear to tenants who. do not pay their rent and refuse to move out.'
