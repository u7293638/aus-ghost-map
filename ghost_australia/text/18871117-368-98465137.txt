A Son of RUspeotable Parents. T.uc adjournment of the Assoembly was moved on Wednesday by Mr. O'Mara, to draw attention to the acnotion of the Attorney General in allowing a young man named Pruen. who had been convioted at Bathurst of embezzl ing money from the Railway Department, to go without punishment. It appears that Dr. Cortis, member for Bathurst, interceded for the youth with the Attorney-General and " begged him off" because he was the son of "respectable parents" and was of weak mind. The Attorney-General, in reply to the charge, said that Pruen had not been dealt within an exceptional manner. If another case came be fore him in which the circumstances woro similar he would take the same course in regard to it. In conclusion, Mr. Wise said that if he did not kenow that Mr. O'Mara was playing a gameo and that it was necessary he should occasionally be comao a tool for his party and sacrifice himself to them, he would use stronger language in regard to the hen. member. Mr. O'Mara in reply said there was no kind of cowardice worse than the cowardice of making such insinuations as the Attorney-General had just thrown out. The idea that such a thing had boon done by an Attorney- General was enough (Mr. Abbott thought) to raise the ghost of Sir James Martin. Ultimately the motion for adjournment was negatived without division. -_
