MR GREENWOOD FOR EAST SYDNEY Mr Greenwood addressed a crowded public meeting of the electors of East Sydney last night, in the Temperance Hall Pitt Street. The chair was occupied by Mr. John Weeks (?). The Chairman said that since the introduction of responsible government he had taken his share as a citizen of trying place qualified men in the Legislative Assembly, and, in introducing Mr Greenwood tonight, he was naming a gentleman who would be an honour to the electors of East Sydney and the country at large. (Cheers) Mr Greenwood's qualifications were superior to those of any other candidate yet announced and he felt sure that the intelligent electors of East Sydney would ensure his triumphant election. (Cheers) The members of the late Parliament had proved themselves incompetent to act with advantage to the country and it was therefore the more incumbent that we should now return (?) competent men like Mr Greenwood who would honestly represent us. Should we have intelligence, honesty and independence to represent us or not? (Cheers) Although he differed from Mr Greenwood on some points in the matter of education, he was prepared to give way for are to, be was prepared to give way for the present rather than lose such a man as Mr Greenwood. Mr Greenwood was received with much cheering He said With a profound sense of my responsibility as a candidate for your suffrages, I meet you here tonight to discuss those public affairs which so materially concern the welfare of this country. Parliament has been dissolved because of its inability to carry on the work of government, and it has now become your duty to put an end to the useless, mischievous strife which has for some time barred the progress of legislation.

You have abandoned the whole colony tons army of land sharks and thrown the greatest difficulty possible in the way of bona- fide settlers What is the good of free s Ici tion before survey when all these tasks can be played with the public estate and when a man of moderate affairs city may be mined before the Lands Department can find out who is light and the serious' It may be perfectly time that before this Land Act came into effect it was dull cult for people to get land when they wanted But why was this Because the Government was not equal to its reponsibility, and threw difficulties in the way of survey The best thing to be done by the St. the on coming into i possession of this great estate was to get it accurately surveyed and mapped out in the advance of settlement And that is what might to be done now Let the sun, we vol precede si statement instead of lagging behind to cause endless disputes and litigation when he declines the true boundaries, and let the State spend a fair share of its land revenue in "citing the country and for the settler, and uotiuakean amateur surveyor of every man who wants to make a home for himself in this great country We can turn sell the land at its fair value, instead of sacrificing it upon a mere pretext of settlement, and we can | have township, reservoir, recruit on, and railway reserves w utilise In the people in suitable localities, secured for them by the State instead of having: to be bought back at the i ii v of a hundred times their original cost And for the rest of the land, let it be fear ed on some security of tenure I am tempted districts where no industry can pay except the I pastoral, and instead of getting a rent of 15s per square ' milk, as we did last year for 237 000 square miles of territory, we shall readily get two or three times that amount, on an tone and agricultural settle-, a vv 11 three side by side without hostility, and the , eveline, will receive all it is fairly entitled to from our great public domain [Voice What about the Volunteer land orders ?] I will say a word on that subject I have nothing to say against the Volun- teers I hope we shall never have need of their services The Volunteer land orders would not have done much harm it given according to the % volunteer Land Act When Sir Henry Parkes passed the A volunteer land order system, the Act simply provided that fifty acres of land should be given. Three or five years afterwards Sir John Robertson had to draw up regulations, and if he had not provided by one of these that the laid order could be" transferred there would have been little harm done, because the Volunteer would only have got the land, and the order would not have been marketable property 'Then when this regulation became law there arose a great demand for the orders, and they were used by the squatters to select parts of their runs by it not a remarkable thing that the author of the Land Art # 1861 is also the author of all this mischief How far the changes of which I have spoken are practicable, and cen- sequently capable of being dealt with by legislation is another thing The f fundamental question us to my hut ought to be done with the land by a state has not been much discussed here of late It seems to be almost universally taken for granted that it ought to be converted into private property But there is another theory exactly the reverse of this-that private property in land should not be created where it does not exist, and that private rights in land should be bought up where they do exist, so that the land may be the perpetual inheritance of the whole people (Hear, hear) It must always be remembered that land is not like other property-the creation of man's hat our and skill Many of its valuable properties may be, but the land itself is God's gift to the whole family of sentient creature that have to live upon its produce from genera- tion to generation According to the old Book which I at all events, and not ashamed of quoting, " The profit of the earth is for all the king himself is served by the field ' If you wish to see this theory illustrated, you need only study the land tenures of India and Has in, for instance, and if

great as those that brought England to the brink of revolution before the passing of the Reform Act of 1882 Whatever four members you elect for East Sydney will represent on the average 1306 voters,

political baby in Parliament might approach nearer than this I shall be prepared, if r, turned by you, to urge on this measure of much needed reform On the question of education I suppose that it will be superfluous to go through that after my address the other night But I notice that one of our newspapers recommends me to be true to my principles and stand by my platform, and not forsake it for political c inspirations, when on the other p are of the same paper was my address, in which I stated distinctly that I am not from to insult v me or to divide my self by seeking to enter Parliament

That was a rare virtue amongst politicians and nine tenths of the candidates for Parliament at the present time presented the pitiful space of not knowing what their opinions were because they had not yet found out what was likely to be popular (Cheers ) Some of his friends said they would vote for Greenwood but he does not stand the ghost of a chance " (Laughter) He had confidence enough in the patriotism of the electors to believe that they had higher idea of their duty to the State than that, and that they would vote for Mr Greenwood because he had about to represent them faithfully and well (Cheers) In reply to questions, the candidate said that he was not in favour of dealing with the amendment of the land law in a patchwork sort of way. Some of the recommendations of the free selectors he agreed with, but with others he did not. We wanted a comprehensive measure. He was a free- trader and although a system of bonuses for the establish ment of particular industries was consistent with free trade, he should probably vote against such bonuses, lest they should in the circumstances of the colony be made permanent, and thus develop into protection (Cheers) He did not recognise the justice of a vote being given to the owners of freehold property and not to any other sort of property, and he should be prepared to support any substituted system that would be more equitable. He would vote to put an end to the mischevious results of the present auction system, but not against the principle of auction sales. He was not in favour of payment of members (Cheers ) When the proposal to make a railway to Illawarra was last submitted, the evidence of probable traffic did not warrant the construction of the line. If it could be shown that the traffic would pay within a reasonable time, he would vote for a line to Illawarra, but not otherwise. The motion affirming the fitness of the candidate was carried with acclamation, there being only two hands held up against it. It was announced that Mr Greenwood would speak on the questions of free trade and protection on Saturday night A vote of thanks to the Chairman, and cheers for the Queen, closed the proceedings. .

He had published fully an 1 with care what he desired to say to the electors of West Sydney for he knew perfectly well that there would be a few people who would be so unfair to him as to try and prevent him from being heard, and therefore be had taken another means of placing his views before the people.
