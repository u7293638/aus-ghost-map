THE "GREAT WORLD» IN PRANCE. "UHU PARTIE DE PLAISIR." (PROM TUE VAhh MALL GAZETTE.) A great lady of the aeventeenth century being Btneken with ennui one day her bus band and some friends present suggested a morning with the hawks But she was m no humour for hawks A nde then with a little tilting at rings or at the quintain 'No these diverBionB wero stale A game of bowls or bilboquet then a deal of cards a spell of backgammon? Non messieurs at last said the lady with impatience je n aime pas les plaisirs innocents Tastes havo improv ed since then and when modern French ladies of the world are heard arrang mg a partie de pi usir one may be sure the programme will be wholly and indeed naively innocent Balls c ushes dinners academic speeclica the opera and exhibí tions of all sorts-these are not pleasures but a round of duties m winch ladies aftei the first novelty of them has worn off take no more real delight than soldiers do in a review But a i irtie de plaisir is a day s holiday which 1 reaks in upon the monotony of social obligations with a wondrous fresh ness , it is a piece of truancv to be re merabered with cheerfulness and emo tion through many a dull day sue ceeding In the spring the thing to do is to go to the Petit Trianon and pass a morning in poor Marie Antoinettes model park with its quaint dairy cowhouse and preBbytery then bark back to St Germains in a char \ banc or four m hand dine at the Pavilion Henry IV and drive home to Paris m tho moonlight tho almanac having boen consulted beforehand for this purpose On another day a breakfast in the branches of Robinsons oak at Sceaux should begin the amusement and a visit to St Cloud with return down the river by moonlifeht as be fore should end it lins moonlight is essential foi where no moon is there are no giant shadow s of trees nj silver ripples in the water md no poetising In the winter howev er no plan for a hapi y day is quite complete unlcBS it embrace one or all of these features-1 a tnp down the sewers with the Prefect of the Seine for one s guide 2 a nice ilesh creeping stroll through the Catacombs ¿ a fciance at aspntuahsts or a fortune tellers 4 a dinner at a restau rant and 5 a couple of hours in a loge grillée at some popular theatre renowned for farces or melodramas total 16 hours away from home with no trouble of dressing and pure excitement from first to last Such is the manner of holiday which our acquaint anees the Three Graces of the Taubourg St Germain have resolved to give themselves with M de Sangbleu M Pistache and M de Muguet on leave from Jus hussar regiment acting as their cavabers They have been looking forward to the enjoyment for days and days and if a snowstorm occurred on the appointed morning the ladies would almost cry from disappointment 1 ut luckily everything works propitiously This astonishingly good matured winter contributes a brifeht sun and clear sky M le Préfet Ferdinand Duval has place 1 himself at the service of the party along with M Alnhand the man of mafcic who foi 20 years has been rebuildinfe embellish ing and polishing Pana and truly there are no six gladder people in the capital than those whom a waggonette conveys to the place de la Madeleine under the escott of the two distinguished -ediles and lands near an iron plate in the pavement close to the flower market This plate is a door and leads to the sewers Let no one be flurried at the woid for the sewers of Pans aro the finest and sweetest in the world and since the amiable princesses of the House of Orleans set the example of visiting them every one else has been anxious to do so impelled of course by enthusiasm foi the marvels of science A mau in a flannel shirt and rusty boots reach ing to his thighs lifts the door md the party descend a staircase not too steer) and find themselves on ii plilfoni under i launel much like those of the underground íailivay m London lhere is nothing, to see at first but the enamelled brid s of tho vault glanng clean as porcelain m the gashfeht and a trim car like a third class îailway carnage into vv Inch the party are requested to mount and m which they are home at a slow pace under the rumble of the streets abov cas far as the Plate du Chatelet So far there is really nothnife to inspire terroi and the ladies who had taken ev ery precau tion possible in the way of salts in gold capped smelling bottles and who besides baa judged it necessary to turn pale on reaching the platform find now that science is a smooth decent thing after all Tlio tram car IB drawn by a contnv ance of ropes and of a sower nothing is visible but a canal of rapid eddying waters which flows alon0 the ti am quay and which the party not un natuiully take for a subterraneous branch of the Seine It is as though a pleasmc, îllu Sion bad been Biiatcbed from them when they leam ti at this canal is the sewei and that the shoals of rats they had hoped to see (from afai and safely protected) the mounds of silver spoons drop ed into the drains by hunted thieves the instruments of buiglary feot rid of by the same means and jodiáis who knows a veiy burfelar in the flesh being ] uisued hie ^.lctoi Uueos Jean '\aljeau tlnou0h undeiground Pans and bafllnife the aidour of Ins porseeu tors are all i ictures that mu3t be ex ptinged from then fancy However hope revives for a space when the party are transferred from tho tram into a punt and are paddled undei a vaulting along the nairow pivementsof which booted scaven gera are flitting like ghosts with bufeo besoms in their hands If M Maxime Du camp the lustoriofrraiher of Ians were with the paity or if Prefect Duval weie as communicative as ho might be the ladies would leam with more suipisothan píeosme that after the boots of these scavengois havo been worn six months and aie seomingly good foi nothniL, but to bo castiiitoallaminc, furnace they 1 egin a now and glonous caieer in the shois of fashionable boot niakeis Tho leather being thick al starting the outward rusting they undeigo seasons

confide 1 to gentlemen and in the vv ay of st vrthii" news the ladies learn nothing but this that if a thunderstorm were to broik out ovci head the vault under vv Inch they are glidin" might be filled with ram watei in five minutes And do you mean we should be drowned? asks Mdmc do Rosothe with a slight lump ni bei tlnoat Quite di owned all of us answers the prefect cheerfully but thero aie no thun

scavengers a ready escape into tho streets at tho first approach of dangoi It is fair to state that this ex planation opeiates ns just tho slightest damper on the genoral feeling of i leas tut ness but happily tho end is near Shooting like a dull fish ovei the waters the punt reaches a landiiifestat,c near a Hood gate and lo ! at a signal from M Alphand tins doo 1 gate is closed and the contrary cunonts being thus ched ed thousands upon thou sands of corks use to the surf aco bob about and jostle one another Ono enn seo nothiii" but corks for theso light things act as a cloak to the

cimforting ihilosophy lorms the most fitting of preludes to a walk through the Catacombs which aro entered at tlio Borner d 1 nfor-gloomy but appropriate namo . As every one knows the Catacombs aro disused stone quarries which havo boon adorned m tnio lronch tasto with the skulls and bonoB of all tho Bkelotons dug up from tho city churchyards closod at tho io volution Tho Innocents Comoteiy which Stood whore tho central markets now aro and which was the principal burying placo of Pana during four conturies contributed nearly S 000 000 skeletons and tho victima beheaded under the 1 errol supphod a smaller but not less interesting contingent Hie skulls aro most artistically embedded in tho walls-hero in pyramidal patterns ton at the baso and ono at tho apex thoro in obliges, further on in ovals with u 1 ícturesque framework of shin boneB and in some placcB the shapely devices take the forms of crosses and stars Wherever iden tification was possible brass platea have been inserted to record the names once borne by these ornamental relics and a Frenchman has only to ramble through tho Catacombs to feel that he belongs not only to an artistic but to a thoughtful and considerate people Lach of the persons in the present party has been furnished with an iron candlestick and tallow dip rnd they have been adjured not to get apart from one another-which they vv ould not have been tempted to do in any c ise-for there is a legend of an Englishman who insisted on doing the Cat icombs alone and who having outpaced his guide was found 24 hours afterw ards under the Pan theon more dead than ahv e in every sonso for he fancied himself a skeleton Jo five persons m tlie party the Catacombs have only the fascination of curiosity Being of noble blood they are naturally acquainted with the sites where their ancestors were buried ever since the world began but M Pistache who springs of plebeian Btock has the emotion of feeling that any one of those skulls which aro ogling him may have sat on tlieshoulders of his great grandfather whom he happens to know plied an honest grocery business neal the Innocents quarter Ia it this which stamps a slight hue of melancholy on the tallant joung Frenchmans brow' Any how he has not much appetite for the luncheon which the prefect hospitably giv es to his guests at the Luxembourg and the sadness has not quite left lum all tlie after noon when the party tal e leave of their agreeable host and adjourn to the third item in their _t aitie de plami-o. visit to Baron Iraip the spiritualist medium Vi ho made M 1 rapp a baron and by *vhat secret treaty with tbe evil one he caine to acquire his powei ovei churs and tables aie mjstenes which no one has ventured to fathom but he is much îun after and not the less so as his feminine v îsitors ire per suaded there ia something sulphurous about the man and nev er fail to do penance bj their confessors (orders for having visited bim How ev

is unearthly 1 am sure I shall scream falters Mdme de Mignonnctte putting out her hand to feel that elie is protected on her nght by the Duke de Sangbleu and on her left by M Pistache Is it lealty

Judge of M Pistaches feohiiga when from nght under his nose as it were comes up a sene3 of ghostly raps on tho ma hoganv ' He is a peaceable man is M Pistache who has novel dabbled beforo in the works
