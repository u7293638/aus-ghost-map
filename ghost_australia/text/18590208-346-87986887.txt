: TO THE MINING HOARD ELECTORS.1 \ (Per favor Editor of the Bmdigo Advertiser.) Gentlemen,-I wish, to cull your attention! to three lettors which lately appeared in the Adeer fixer,, two signed "Caution,'' and one "a Digger's (Pesudo) friend to the backbone.'' As I apprehend, all three emanate from the pen of one individual, the . modern Wolsey, w.holin his own opinion, " has served the diggers' better than' his God," and who not bo'ng a Daniel' ..come to judgment-has no right to thurstor foist on the digging community, his griitituous and impertinent idvice. I beg leave to tell him, that'he has mistaken liis vocation, and perhaps being,surrounded by a Lowland mist,and having an intellect "as circumscribed as the orbit of a puddling mill, may not know that the diggers who tire not' sDctling babes:-will not have him at"'any prifi'c, as their guide, philosopher, or friend; , also; he may not be aware of a fact, as'transparfcnt as the sun at noonday that not a man. Jack of tho prtsjiit Board but has been "weighed in the balance and found wanting, and that their only chance of1 re-election is in tho fact of a sufficient number of new men suitable to'the oflic6 riot coming out. Had a few 1 such men as Annearatid Abbott come out they would not have had the ghost of achance. ! Friend " Caution," riot having the gift of second sight, must not'lay the flattering unction to his soul that his dear friend and chieftain will head the poll.. This is decidedly cool and slightly'im pertinent. There are other men perhaps of supe rior education who are animated with as pure a zeal, and who enjoy the confidence of the.diggers, and who have done as good .yeoman service wliose clianoe is equal. Awny with such puerile dictation veto gioss'personalities, and let the plat form speak the merits of the candidate. ONE OF MANY WHO LIVE BY MINING.
