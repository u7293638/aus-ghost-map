THE ADDRESSERS. We have been favoured with several communications, containing farther dis— closures about the Hamilton address; the publication of it, with our remarks, before presentation, had made the addressers quite ashamed of. themselves. They had a meeting at Hamilton, on Monday morning, to concoct something for the Courier, in their own justification. We hope they will attempt it. The Doctor and the Schoolmaster (expectant (Catechist) feel particularly sore: upon the. subject; ) Some otthe wgners have confessed: to. iisthat. they never took the trouble tb read the address, .when'; presented ..t,p...thenvby the i feipn. .cpnstables,.fbr ; signaturer-TPthers have tyldius., that, they did l^ot ,: reflect ?; upon :the disgrace they have: brbuglit upon them- - selves, and the injury. they haye done to the Cploriy byvsigning-a dobunient so cpn . ixkyy. to ,' trutli;. /.' .The-. ;..
