WHAT IS IT? An animal, so singular in its characteristics as to baffle the ingenuity of its exhibiters to classify it, was lately exhibited at the Egyptian Hall. "Open eye" unravelled the mystery, and "classified" not only the animal but its exhibiters, in a letter to the Times-- "Being naturally a bit of a naturalist, and con- sequently anxious to see the 'What is it ?' at the Egyptian Hall in its first wildness, I arose two hours earlier than usual, proceeded thither in a kind of feverish excitement, paid my shilling mag- nanimously, and was shown into the sanctum of 'the wild man of the prairies.' Yes, there 'What is it ?' was, with its keeper, playing 'toss' with an India rubber ball. Oh, ghost of Buffon ! what was my surprise, when at the first glance I found 'What is it ?' to be an old acquaintance-- Hervio Nano, alias Hervey Leech himself ! I will not take up your valuable space by relating how Mister Leech sucked raw flesh and cracked nuts, nor how I volunteered (although 'What is it ?' is very savage with strangers) to go alone into his den, which was refused : but I will tell you how the 'wild man,' finding his hair dress and the fervent expressions of his visitors too warm, shrank into himself and horse-cloth, and went to his kennel to argue with the proprietor on the propriety of return- ing my shilling. The coin was handed back; and I suppose Mr. Leech will take an early departure for the 'wilds of California' again."-Spectator.
