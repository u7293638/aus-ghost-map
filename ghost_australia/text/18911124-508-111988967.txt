A welT-known American actor lately, in a struggle with a San Francisco constable, was reported to have shat his captor, either by aoei dent or design, and to have been arrested accord ingly on a charge of murder, '.' .\i ??'?-. -. ?. ;'. ; The report has given rise to many reminiscen ces, and we are reminded that the^iast time an American actor fired with fatal effect was when John Wilkes Booth shot President Lincoln, at Lord's Theatre, Washingtpn. Master Cop penger, a player, , 'in the Stuart days/' was the only English, actor who ever suffered an ignominious death in England, and he liad been, guilty of nothing worse ttin highway robbery. In France only liwb actors have suffered the extreme penalty «f the law, and neither pf them had killed anybody. .Barrj&res;, a Gascon, who used to .appear at the Theatre Frangais, was executed .for deserting from the army ; and the other offender was also the victim of a barbaront agw, . « ? .

The defenders of Shakspere may breathe again. No less a person than Professor ^airdner— the learned editor of those important hisfeoritcal pub lications, ' ' The Stote jGalendars w — says \ that our mighty William was quite right — that Kichard Crookback did murder those poor little princes in the tower.

Mr. G&irdner; deserves the best wishes indeed of his playgoing countrymen. : A French writer who has token the trouble to ransack files of old newspapers, with a view to finding out what people were doing, in the beginning of tiie last decade of the eighteenth century, has discovered that playgoing. was a chief delight of the Parisians or that day.. It might have been thought that with. the. King, practically » prisoner there would, have been little general inclination to fre quent places of amusement. As all readers of French history know, the theatres were legion, owing to the restrictions which had. just been removed, and which had for so many years secured a prac tical monopoly to two favored houses. So nume rous did the playhouses become that a satirical piece on the subject was produced, under the title ?of;--.? The Thousapd and One Theatres.' The famous English horserider, Astley, had a house in the Faubourg du Temple called 'Astley*a Circus.' Owing to~ the excited state of public opinion at . this idi^, the newly-acquired liberty, of the theatres was a source of considerable embarrassment to the Government. Political satires, thinly veiled, \rere-tha rage, and the flight of the King and his aviest at Yarannes was followed by a whole crop of plays; avowedly based upon that important event, ^.t one house, situated in. the very heart of-tlie aristocratic Faubqurg Sfc ^Srermam,-a mili tary spectacle called 'The Arrival in Paris of the ' Saviours ol their Country ' was given, . and the two men Drouet and Guillaume, -who had been ' instrumental in arresting the Sing, were publicly crowned on the stage with laurels.

John Ljgvey, weii known at one time in the English 1 jJEpvjnees as .an Irish character actor. He was a native of Dublin. He had been a mana ger *f several provincial theatres, and had con siderable reputation as a playwright. As a writer of pantomime, he was especially popular. Fraulein Marie Wilt, a well-known, operatic singer, lately committed suicide by throwing herself from the fourth storey of her hotel in Berlin. She had at one time been prima donna of the Opera House, Vienna. When she made her first appearance in England, about 25 years ago under the name of Vilde, some of the critics com pared, her with Jenny Lind. a55D9tift.f eUpwiug story is told of the leading lady oi A»gustin Daly's Comedy Co., Miss Ada Eehan.
