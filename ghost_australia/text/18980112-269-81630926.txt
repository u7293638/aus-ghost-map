CURBEKT NOTES. BY JUVENTS. Eveiyone knows" that a vco.*y exten sive literature lias grown A*ound_ihe inipoiitant qiiestion : ^What is the cyanide antidote ?" HMherto tiiie chief contributors to our knotv U dge oa this bewildering question have !been chemists, druggists, and otliier scientific* .gentry, "but the en tirely unsatisfaetoiy manner in rwMch these authorities have dealt with the matter has resulted in theologians .tsfciig the field. An enthusiastic fol lower of itlie late lamented Madame Biavat^ky is to the fore with an anti dote, but the does not say whether lie got the information frcmi a -Maiiatma, ihis great mistress, or from a "Cheftn tstiy Made Easy." (Jyow that a lead ing member of a TheosopMcal Society ihas ahtown that he can unbend and take a purely worldly interest in cy anide, it Is very safe 'to assume that tsts PoMew and Better, instead of appear in tlie daily papers : "Sir, re antidote : Let the pa.tient read a chapter of Timo-thy ; then dip him in cold water ; have never known it fail.-Yours, Xi-usSi -Baptist." Or, "Hr,-Tiiie cyanide : Don't -take any. ?-Youas, Total Abstainer-from cyan ide.", Or, "Sir.--To cure cyanide or any other poisoning. Take gin and ginger beer in proportions which can be ascertained by sending three two penny stamps, and a stamped and ad dressed enevlope to 'Cheerful Oheru Ixim.' " Or, "Sir,-On a silver coin I will forward information that will take all terrors from cyan ide, and show how a man can prepare for heaven, *and yet be happy.-Yours, 0 Be Careful .Smith." >T8ie chemists iiave made us a bit sceptical about science ; with Vtiie assistance of the tiieologlacK the average ;=? citizen " wall sjon regard Professors Stokes and t>ewar as frauds, if chemistry sur vives the combined attack there -must be sohletJiing in it.

If these joyful mis creams are not stopped, they will very soon be lighting their pipes with tire pound notes, or shouting tor all hands.
