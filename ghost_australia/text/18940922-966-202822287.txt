We publish i lie following this week :— Yotick could " sc-t the- tahlc in a roar" An<l Tommy Hudson's self can do.n»» more; But didn't Hamlet's father's ghost ene ni^-ht Inspire tbeprince with terror and affright? An i when a traveller arrives by train. Don't he expect yr nr fla>k of wine to drain, And do 'ttax your pi'.ience now and then To be insulted by some drunken men. Arid if oil tria you ahorse engage. And get a spill, O don't you rop.r with rage? THE MAN IN THE MOON. 'Midst enemies both bold and strong Sat Charles the First at table, long Willi calm «ud n.ible face, On trial, and compelled to bear A Cromwell inoe'-, a Bradihaw jeer, And fa'sely tax His Grace. Poor traveller, no royal train, No friei.d his terror "t«j res' rain Or soothe his troubled mind; But when he knew his end was near Ha then embraced b s children dear With loving words and kind. B. S. S. When death rides the storm and the turbulent r.c?an, With terror inspires the poor mariner's h*art; How painful ths trial, how great the commotion, How bitter the tears from his eveballs that sUrt ? When the home of his childhood the traveller reach**!', How unfeigned ths delight as be lesps from the tra'n— How tamest his grey-headed father beseeches The fugitive never t-> leave theui again. And when demagogues muster by scores round a table, A-.d tax their mad brains for some cause of complaint ; How much they resemble tbe builders of Babel, While breaking away from all lawful restraint.
