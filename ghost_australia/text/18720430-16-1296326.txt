nsw causen of england, kan- garoo POINT The ceremony of laying the corner stone of this edifice took place yesterday afternoon, and succeeded in attracting avery large assemblage The proposed church will be erected on one of the most beautiful sites on the Point, immedi- ately adjoining the .National School, and com- manding an extensive view llio building, when erected, will be a handsome addition to our city places of worship, and will supply a want long felt by the Church of England resi dents of Kangaroo Point. It is only designed at present to complete such a portion of tho church as will suit the requirements of the con gregation, leaving to a larger population the task of carrying out tho entire plan Mr R. G. Suter is the architect for the building, and the plans of the edifice as prepared by him were on view at the ground yesterday. The order of architecture chosen is the Gothic, and the church, which will be of cruciform shape, will consist of a nave, transepts, and ohancel. The total length of the church when completed will be 100 feet, but the portion which is now under erection will be only fifty-four feet long with a width of thirty-four foot. Stone from the quarries about Brisbane will be the material used in the construction, and the roof will be of open timbor work. A handsomo bell turret will surmount the front of tho building and take away whatever of dulness the simplicity of the plan might suggest. The cost of the portion of the church to be erected now is estimated at £700 and owing to the exertions of the Building Committee thr greater portion of this sum has boen already raised. We are informed that in oash and promises £580 has been got together, and Mr F Tooth, of Sydney, has intimated his inten- tion of subscribing £100. The erection will therefore start un or fairoi poouniary auspieos thun 13 gonciall} tho case and the congiegation will not hav o to contend with that great bugbear, " a debt on the hml ung " Great

everyone, ho said, deeply sensible of the kindness of His Excellency the Governor in laying tho foaudation stono of this church, which was meant to replace tho simple, unpietontious edifice, which hud for ouch a length of time served as a houso of prayer for the congregation Tho history of Moreton Boy did not extend very far back, but tho old building in which tho congregation had worshipped would al ¡vu) s bo associated with its history The first Church of Imgland m this colouy was a carpenter's ?shop bolougmg to the Government of >'ow South Wale«, which was granted for tho purposo This building was now used as 8t John's School Archdeacon Glennie, who was tho second Church of England Pastor of Bris ' bane, built tho simple church on the Point on a pieeo of land gi anted bj tho then Government Resident, Captain Wickham It was sometimes thrown in the face of tho members of the Church oí England, that, being the wealthiest portion of tho commumtv, they wero unmindful of tho wants oi their clergy and tho honor of their God Ho domed tho truth of this taunt, and enid that nilen properly put before thom the mombcrs of the Church had never been found indifferent to the modest prétendons of their clerav, and neither would the) be found ¡udiuVreut to tho cause of God In this work of raising on earthly tom pie for tho worship of their ¿Inker, they should all join together, andiegard themselves for the purposo as a Chiiitian brotherhood or mutual provident society Ho men it, in phm English, that the members of the Church of England in all parts of the municipality of Bri«bano should help tho members of tho Church m Kangaroo Point in completing their edifice, and the people of Kan garoo Point might afterwards assist m building other churches where they were required Ho trusted, howover, that this building would be completed without resort to tho«o measures concerning which he «ould not sav much that dov, but of which was known ho did not approve He liked amusement ns well as any person, but he did not believe m putting them under the garb of religion Don't let them build up God's Houso bv means of this sort In conclusion he pointed out that honoring tho remembrance of the worthy dead should not bo lost sight of in the adornment of tho interior of God's Temple, and suggested that a stone pulpit, which ho was informed would cost iibout£40, would bo avery suitable memorial of the late Hon Gilbert Eliott, the frst Speaker of the Legislativo Assemblj, who with his late wife had been for such a number of years connected with the Church of lîngland community in Queensland The offertory was thou collected, and amounted to the very handsome sum of £57 17s lOd His LoBDSlliP having pronounced the Bene diction, tbo ceremonv terminated with the sing
