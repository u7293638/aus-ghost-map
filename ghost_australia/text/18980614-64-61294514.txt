j BLACK-MAILING. A mem bor ot too infamous tribe known as blackmailers has just got his deserts at New- castle. Ho selected for his victim a manager of a bank, and doubtless thought that as the official occupied a respectable position he would make considerable sacrifices rather than have any scandal, though lt might be only imaginary, connected with his name. So he wrote a letter (under a false name) to the proposed victim, demanding money under a threat of exposure if the demand was not complied with. There are men in the world -people whose nature is weak and who have a fearful dread of being; associated with any kind of a scandal involving sensual pro- fligacy-who wouldj have attempted to make terms with the blackmailer, and so have become his slave for life. Not 60 the bank manager, however. He promntly put the letter in the hands of the police, and the latter, laying a tran for the scoundrel who had written it, soon nad him in their clutches. When brought face to face with the judge, all the cowardice in his nature at once came to the surface, and he made a whining appeal for mercy. Fortunately there was not the ghost of a chance of the appeals being effec- tive. And yet some sort of leniency was shown to the scoundrel, for he was sentenced to only 2J years' imprisonment. He should have been sentenced to 50 lashes in addition. But comparatively light as the sentence was, it will probably be a warning to the some- what numerous body of persons in the colony whose dispositions and inclinations are similar to that of this despicable convict. Blackmailing is a very risky game.
