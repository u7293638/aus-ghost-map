MUSICAL AND DRAMATIC NOTES. -_ Au article in the Pall Mall Gazette by Mr. George Moore, entitled " Our Dramatic Critics," has for some weeks past been the theme of discussion in London theatrical circles, and of correspondence, long drawn out, in portions of the London press The writer of the article is, of course, the author of A Member's Wife " and other novels, in the latest realistic modern style, which have the doings of stage land for their subject As might be expected, Mr. Moore's article 13 spiteful, smart, and amusing. The first paragraph gives " the full sum in the brief narration of what he has to say, and may be quoted here. He begins -" Like a waiter, the equipment of a dramatic critic is a suit of dress-clothe. He puts them on every night about half-past 6 and goes to the theatre, where he hastens until after 11 to all the actors have to say, he then hastens to a printing office, where, until 2 in the morning, he explains and analyses to the extent of nearly a column a favourable or unfavourable example of a literature which at its highest point equals a second-rate novel, and not in- frequently falls below the level of the Family her aid and the London John na! " Herein the writer alludes in a characteristic way to the personal side of his subject-ovidently believing with Sheridan that " the malice of a good thing is the barb that makes it stick and also touches the key-note which alone gives his article value and interest. Probably none so keenly as the writers for the press deplore the level of much that the mass of play goers admire and demand. We have to go back two centuries and more to find poet c drama the staple enter statement at the playhouse and if the recent failure in London of the revival of "The Stronger "that gloomy impossibility beloved of our forefathers might seem to point to some improvement in the public taste of late years, w 0 have only to glance at the continued acceptance of the most commonplace and stereotyped melodramas to see that, after all, the alleged improvement is but a change from one de- praved taste to another. Now, it has to be remembered that just as " good parts make good actors," so " good plays make good critics." Bernhardt in " Adrienne," or Janet Achurch in A Doll's House," may prove inspiring, but it is not to be thought of that anything of interest should be written of " Monto Christo, Jr," or " The Crimes of Paris " Yet pieces of this character are applauded and preferred by the mass of playgoers, and have thus to be reviewed more or less from the standpoint of popular acceptance by the critics. One of a host of correspondents to the Pall Mall Gazette is not far wrong when he puts the case thus Adelphi dramas, Drury Lane pantomimes, Lesh Farron burlesques, and variety entertainments are the performances which occupy by far the largest number of London stages Without venturing to say a word against these things in themselves, I maintain simply that they no more require criticism than the performances of a street conjurer or a Sunday band on Clapham Common." Thus, so far as Mr. Moore accuses the London critics of being too often more reporters, the answer is that in many cases a report of what is seen and heard is amply sufficient. His contention that the London press as a body opposes with might and main every attempted return to literary drama is far more serious. In support of this charge he instances " Beau Austin," an original comedy " full of wit and poetry," which failed at the Haymarket Theatre a year ago The play was by two of our cleverest writers of prose and verse, namely, Robert Louis Stevenson and W. E Hoile) He adds to this " A Doll's House " a play which has found thousands of admirers throughout the Continent of Europe), "Ghosts," and "HeddaGablor " On this point there can be no doubt that many who differ with Ibsen in the modes of thought and the dramatic treatment of his plays were disappointed on finding in the London press abuse where there should have been criticism The defenant, the 1901 Id, and two 0 or three other journals furnished analysis and explanation Where the mass of we ters pronounced failure, and " longed for such a force as would place their darling Commonplace out of danger "-as Mr Moore puts it. However, on this point it has to be remembered that opinion on this point is at present as much divided as it was 15 years ago in regard to Wagner's operas, and when the battle rages furiously, calm judgment becomes impossible, now as then Ibsen, himself devoted to his art, which he pursues with single-minded indifference to either praise or blame, has lived to see his best plays and his "neat poems accepted as classics throughout Scandinavia and Germany now for 20 years past. His words- were, however, an unknown quantity in London until 10 years ago, and general attention was not drawn to them until " A Doll's House " was staged by Miss Achurch in June, 1889 In Stockholm, 10 years earlier, while the piece was running at the NationalThoabo, the been discussion waxed so hot that social invitations would bear the warning, " You are requested not to mention Ibsen's new play." London passed through the same phase of angry argument about "Nora" two years ago, and this being so, and human nature being what it is, the abuse showered upon a piece entitled to fair criticism need not be quoted by Mr. Moore in proof that the London on tics worship the commonplace" Such evidence may be strong, but it is far from conclusive For the rest, his article has done good, if only by reminding playgoers of how little they have to boast of in the theatrical entertainment of the day, and of the duty of doing all that in them lies to promote a better state of affairs Mr. Kyrie Bellew writes from the Adelphi! Hotel, London, by the last mail, with the express object of informing readers of " Musical and Dramatic Notes " of his ridout movements and future plans. After some preliminary chat, in which he refers to his return visit to Australia as a matter of course, Mr. Bellew continues -" As for our more general news, when Mrs. Potter has concluded her round of visits to her relations and old friends here and elsewhere, we shall sail for South Africa, where we play a six months' season, opening on the 1st February next ensuing. After that, it is our intention, should the state of the country warrant the visit to star South America and Mexico, and in October we re-open in the United States. Now a word about our stay in London. Our not playing this season has simply been due to the fact of there being no suitable theatre that we could got for more than seven or eight weeks at longest. We have now all but signed the lease of the new theatre in course of completion just off Trafalgar square for the end of next year, or for we are now cabling managers in America, for the London season of 1899 Then, in regard to new plays for all parts of the world, including Australia, we recognise the wisdom of increasing our repertoire largely, no matter at what cost of corn and study. Accordingly, chiefly through Mrs Potter's strong Paris influence, we have secured the rights of a new play from Dumas and one from Sardou, also a new Italian play, which is magnificent twill * rouse your fell of hair, as life were in 't 'and has recently been produced in Turin. Mrs. Potter herself intends writing you soon, but has been waiting hitherto to learn whether you received safely her letter, despatched from Bombay at the end of April. She has taken a house in St John's Wood, where she is living with her parents and a brother, quietly resting, and recounting her many adventures 111 foreign parts.

Miss Kemble describes the greater part of Queensland as still in a depressed state owing to the new past labour disputes, and attributes the fact that she " covered expenses with a little over " to the circumstance that she had never visited the northern townships before, and that her name was familiar However, in many of the ports, theatrical matters are in a primitive condition, and the usual street-corner standard of art is currently expressed thus " as she ever played with Dan Barry ? ' No. " " Then who aint no manner of' good " Miss Kemble describes Charters Towers as being " so prosperous you can almost pick up money in the streets" and here, where the stage w IIB erected at one end of a great skating rink, playgoers were expected to bring their own chairs Accordingly, between 7 and 8 o'clock, family detach- ments filed in with chins on their heads, and the appearance of the main street suggested a general exodus of the population With all their goods and chattels Splendid business was done in 1 Townsville also, but at Bundaberg the attitude of the people was that related of the rustics in a certain secluded English village, "I say, Bill, 'ere comes a stringer "I "A stringer Jim, " 'Eavo 'uri a brick at is bloomin' 'ead, tion'" After one more such experience the company struck civilisation once again at Brisbane (10th October), where expenses were covered in spite of the general depression, and the return to Sydney overland pi can read well in crowded houses at Toowoomba At Marwick, however, the company " struck influenza, ' as Miss Kemble expresses it, and thence on to Armidale and Clon- Innes the epidemic was so severe that the mass of the tow people feared to frequent any place of entertainment At Armidale, whilst enjoying the balmy twilight air on the balcony of her hotel, Miss Kemble, for the first time in her life, awoke to and herself famous b means of the town nor ' Seated on a sorry-looking Bosinnnte, the ceaseless clatter in whose cars apparently induced a slumberous meditation, the error authoritatively rang his bell and announced, ' to-night ' to-night to night ' Roll up, roll up, roll up, all of } oz ' Miss Mann Campbell, are now reduced the bow idol of her perfection, will produce 'Di Bill, with all the original lime- light effects, and 11 Stock star artists at the back of her Also, this afternoon, 100 prime wethers, and 100 bullocks rolling fat, of pigs," &c.;, &c.;, Ac Miss Kemble, who relates the story with a humour not to be reproduced in cold type, is looking wonderfully well after her long tom, but expresses herself as glad to be safe home again On Thursday she left for Melbourne, where she appears this evening in a ro vnal of "D' Bill" at the Bijou Theatre, under Messrs Brough and Boucicault's management ABtago -version of "Thereto Baqum" has been produced at Mr Green's ' Independent Theatre," in London, under the licence of the Lord Chamberlain, and has proved so successful that it is to be regularly performed at the Royalty Theatre On this subject a writer in the St James's Gazette says "As I understand it, the object of the Independent Theatre Society is not to get round the censors and produce indecent or immer it plays as some of the opponents of the mov moment pretend Its object really is to produce anti- couviitioual plays The society belles (to use Yola s words) that Lo drama agonise si no morn the sun one to Cayenne II fact she sang it to cadaver Bolton ing this, it seeks to produce plays written by observers or nature instead of those manufactured according to recipe by thorogularpla} wrights It corresponds to the school in art which demands landscapes painted on plain au in place of canvases composed of studios But it cannot be too clearly stated that the censorship question is a side issue, and that the Movement is a rebellion against the petty, tricky conventional work which occupies some, but not all of our theatres, and which, whether by or against his will, seems to more have hitherto marred the work of our most sincere and earnest dramatist, Mr H A Jones There could be no stronger evidence that thomo\cmentaimsat style, not subject, at freedom from cramping form and not liberty to be disgusting, than the fact that the second play produced by the Independent Theatre has been licensed yet this very fact has been dishonestly tortured into an admission or failure when it is really a proof of sUCCeSS Whether Mr Groom's ideal be true or false, he ought to have fair play " In view of the season of Italian opera in Sydney, which will probably form the musical feature of 189.2, it is worth noting that the "cheap prices" to be adopted this month in London by Mr Lodge for similar entertainment at the Shaftesbury Theatre will be, gallery Is Ikl, at 2s 6d, dress circle os and 7s 6d, and stalls 10s 6d Mr Lago s company will consist chiefly (in of Mine Simonsen's) of singers at present unknown save in then on a country-bred ho operas will be "Cav allans Ivusticann for the first time in England Ricci's old opera "Crispies Coman and Mack's "Armida, not performed Within living memory Miss Mnclnt} to has also been engaged, and will probably make her first appearance in Faust," shortly after which it is hoped that Webers Der Freischutz " will be given and that the 'Flying Dutchman' will eventually be revived.

The Birmingham Musical Festival was brought to a successful close on the 10th October The chief item in a an interesting programme was Anton Dvorak's " Requiem," a work of great difficulty and infinite charm, which was performed with great effect The concert also included the Vorsjuol to AVngneVa Parsifal," Beethoven's Seventh Symphony, and Berlioz s " Faust " The attendances throughout the week were very large, and at the meeting of the general committee on Saturday it was shown that the total receipts were ill 169 11s 8d, whilst there was reason to believe that the expenditure would not exceed iOOOO Lord Tennyson's new play is called " Maid Marian " The title in itself is almost sufficient to show the character of the piece Those who have seen Miss Ada Rohan's Rosalind will be able to imagine with what charm she will invest the character of the outlaw's wife, and there can be little doubt that Mr John Drew will make a gallant Robin Hood The play had already been read by Mr Irving, and then it was hoped that Miss Anderson would play in it, but her retirement from the stage prevented the fulfilment of that hope However, all is well that ends well. The Whitehall Review states that Mr Sydney Grundy is at present actively engaged in dramatising Mr Terrell s recent novel, " Lady Belmore," which it may be remembered by its readers, like Wilkie Collins's "Man and Wife," turns upon the strange peculiarities of Scottish marriage law. Mr H Atkinson, The " Australian Orpheus," who was " discovered " by Mr J L Moore during his recent tour in the Antipodes, has been specially engaged by Sir Augustus Harris to give his from workable vocal imitations of humorous musical instruments in the programme of the Promenade Concerts at Covent Garden Miss Clo Graves, in conjunction with Mrs Oscar Beringer, has prepared a dramatic version of her story, " Dragon's Teeth" This new play has been secured by Mr and Mrs Kondut Miss Graves has also completed a one-act play called "The Knave," which has been accepted by Mr Daly Mr Blackmore is said to be collaborating in the preparation of a stage version of his famous story, " Lorna Doone " Mrs Oscar Boringer is contributing to the pages of Woman a series of papers descriptive of her experiences as a theatrical manageress The 24th October is the date now chosen for the production of Mr Pinero's now play, " The Times," at Terry's Miss Fanny Brough will represent a ubiquitous lady journalist
