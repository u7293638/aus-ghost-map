As one mounts the steps -of the famous ' Lygon-street'? building (which1 'by the way isn't in Lygon-street, but jn Victoria-street) he is aware of a legend over the door, ' Trades ..Hall and Literary Institute.' ' We're afraid the second part of the title is a legend in more senses than one. Literary Institute I Why not ? What more . suitable place in Victoria than the Trades Hall 1 Nay, when you come to think of it, is it not a shame that the home of organised Labour, the meeting place of the representatives of a Cause which is an embodied Idea, which draws its chief sustenance and support from Ideas, and which will. ultimately and inevitably, make Earth a Heaven by the sheer momentum of ' Ideas — is it not a shame that such a place is not also a storehouse of those catalogues and in dexes of Ideas we call books : that it is not even a flirting place where one .may while away an hour or two with that moat enchanting and soul-provocative of all sweethearts, Literature : ' that, in fact, it is not a Literary Institute. All statistical and record information bearing on the Labour movement should, be there ; the great works on social questions of every age and country, well translated .and,: where necessary, annotated, should, be there 5 the , .poems of the. world (which; on the whbleV are on our side) should, be there to inspire, to exhort, to encour age, to sweeten or to sadeleh'us. The works of our enemies, too, should be; there, for only by knowing them face* to face, can we realise how really insignificant are their 'armaments and. how scooped-turnip-like their ideas ; works , on his tory, which is a record of the failure of every other social ? theory but ; ours,/ should be there ; works, on philosophy, that great quartz reef which runs from l^prth to , South through Timer and is so richly veihe^. with Despair, should also be in the Hall, to chasten or to warn us. And why not ?

A 'very peculiar communication,' as Chair man, Harris described it, was received from the Plumbers' Union. At least they are officially responsible for it, although we would hardly care to believe' that the bulk of the members of that Union are really responsible for, its con tents. The letter, which was in reply to the Trades Hall circular with reference to. the proposed '? paid' 'organiser,' was as follows :— '\I am in structed by my Society to say that we do not consider' such an officer necessary. There have , been many instances in this, colony .where. agi- tators or organisers, as they aTe sometimes., called, have done more harm than good. Ac . cording to a cutting from the ' Age ' of 6th' of February, ? from the New Zealand letter (en closed), they are not a success -in that colony. We are of opinion that if ,the Trades Hall :0oun cil'gave a little more attention to trade affairs,, '?and a little' less £0 politics, it would be more . beneficial to the1 workers' in 'general, and' all ^that would beiequired.': ; ; ; : o . The J1 Age 'cutting referred to bemoaned the fact,, that Trades Unionism wasgoirig too far in ' its demands, in ,Mapriland,,and that ; agitators were mainly responsible for this : that things ? were coming (tb such a pass that employers would ^certainly, retaliate : that nonsense was, being mouthed about the brotherhood of Labour:*' that agitators had induced, the brassmoulders, v ..who; had a dispute with their employers, to get, up an exaggerated .'list of grievances and de-' mands for the purposes of their case before, .the court under the Arbitration and Conciliation Act : ' arid that such unreasonable demands were made both for higher wages, shorter hoursi and. regulation of apprentices that they'didh't' get all they asked for, although, they, did get far ' better conditions than had existed before. ? ?;-..' It took members some time to. realise what all this' had to do with the question, especially as 'the figures given in the cutting rather strength ened the case for organisation: than otherwise. Therirst feeling was' one of indignation at the Plumbers, an indignation -which would hare been official ly expressed v in no .mincing terms had it not been that reflection suggested to, most present- that the Plumbers, Ws'a wholei did not really : realise what had been done on their be half.. Charity suggested r to. most present that an organised , body of , Plumbers . co.uld hardly condemn organisation ; that a body of workers, splendidly protected' by regulations under an Act of Parliament, could hardly be ignorant of the fact that trade matters and political matters -- are; nowadays and, necessarily synonymous; that1 it was hardly likely that a honourable body of workers should in a time of temporary prosperity so brutally affect to forget both the times |of- their, own , adversity and the other workers who fought for them then ;, and that in fact more than a full belly was surely necessary in order to turn a plumber into' a '.traitor.

They had been in difficulties for years, and now, be cause there was a spurt in 'their line, they act like this. !' It was an insult. He moved :that a deputation from the council wait upon the Plumbers' Union to lay before them the advan tages of appointing a paid organiser and disabuse their minds of statements which were deliberate ; falsehoods that had appeared in ' The Age.' ^Delegate Hoyland (Bricklayers' Labourers)' in seconding the motion, said that as a branch of the building trade, the plumbers should know ? that in no trade is organisation more necessary. If they continue to stand on such foolish ground (namely, that being prosperous themselves, they ' had no duty to assist others) they were cutting their, own throats. Delegate Billson (Bootmakers) pointed out that the Arbitration Act had been the very sal- ' vationof the'Maoriland bootmakers, who three years ? ago were, through the revolution in machinery, in the same position as they are at present in Victoria.

EMPLOYER'S TESTIMONY. , Labour, Member Sangster (Seamen's) . showed convincingly how materially the seamen had benefited by the Maoriland Act. He read an extract from; the ' Sydney Morning Herald 'of an interview with a representative of the NiZ. shipowners named Mills, according to which it appeared that from the employers' point of view it was the most satisfactory, piece of legislation they had everhad; that it prevented expensive struggles, that the shipowners had' organised a society to fight the , seamen, buti since, the Act had dropped it as not necessary, ;and that with reference to the one dispute which had, been settled under the' Act both sides1 were satisfied. THOSE BALLY ' AGITATOES.' Delegate Oawse (Plumbers) explained that his society didn't object tp the Arbitration Act, but to 'agitators.'^ The motion that the letter be sent was passed' at an average meeting and unanimously. -,The delegate 'was understood to , ^express the opinion that a man who didn't want to work eight hours a day didn't want tp work at all.

And, since shortening of hours would enable them to get , work, any s efforts in that direction, whether called '*. agitation ' or not, were justifiable. He regretted the observa .tionof a delegate that many' wanted- money without working. at. all; It-was true that a great many people get money without working at all.
