"RICHRS TAKE WINGS." (From the Boston Times.) It is not only individuals who have suddenly increased in prosperity, and as suddenly gone down into nothingness; there are cities of which the same can be said. Such a one is Pithole City, Pa. Within one month of the completion of the first house, this city had a telegraph office, and a hotel costing the owners 80,000 dollars. In one month there was a daily paper established, and in the next a theatre ; in another month another theatre, and then an academy of music. In six months there were seventy-four hotels and boarding-houses; in the seventh month the city had reached its highest prosperity. It then had about 15,000 inhabitants, elaborate waterworks, & city hall, and an extensive city government. Then occurred the completion of a labour-saving enterprise—the socalled Miller Farm Pipe Line—by which the petroleum was sent off independent of the labouring population. At once 4000 persons were thrown out of employment, while 2000 horses became unless; this was the death-blow te Pithole City. At once the hotels, theatres, and the telegraph office were closed, and the daily paper gave up its ghost, while almost every one packed up his trunk and moved out. Only nine families remained out of a population of 15,000 souls, while the Tailroad from Pithole and Oleopolis runs only one train a day, consisting of a locomotive and a single car, which is usually empty; but the company is obliged to keep running, otherwise the charter for the road wonld be lost. They still hope against hope for that unfortunate city, which, in only seven months, was born, full grown, got sick, and died. Undoubtedly this is a case unparalleled in history, modern or ancient; neither Egypt nor Greece cau give examples of such rapid changes.
