INANE JOCULARITIES. (London Spectator.) There is nothing m the world "Inch produces the sonso of mental nausea more completely, or is more certain to turn the intellectual stomach than the use of certain jocularities of speech with which many people think fit to adorn their conversation. The people who seem to find it impossible to speak of an unmarried man except as "a gay bachelor," with whom the sea is always "the briny" or the "herring- pod," and a horse "a fiery steed," who eternally talk about "Sunday go-to-meeting" clothes, and who have such phrases as "no extra charge," " agitate the tintinabulator," "the noxious weed," "the pipe of peace," "forty wink", and *' braving the elements," for ever on their lips, are capable of producing a sense of disgust in those who care to see language kept bright and clean, which is absolutely intolerable. It is difficult to say whether these cant phrases — that is a per- fectly proper description of them — are more odious when used consciously, or unconsciously — that is, by people who believe them to be funny, and intend that their hearers should consider them funny, or by those who have merely caught them up and repeat them like parrots, and without any intention, good or bad. It our own opinion, the use of "common- form" jocularities is most of offensive in those who thirl, ol thtm as »»it though most p iinful in poisons »rho uso them unconsciously and ia meia methods ot c\pi casing thou meaning Wo feel thnt those, »» ho trj ta lore, a laugh out of such oxpies sioub as "my donuy couch," or "committing inntrinon}," uho squirm into n smilo 13 thoy ask it " theio isn't room for a 1 ttlo one." 01 »vho speak of "japanumg thoir trottcr-casos " might fairly be shot at sight AVhon somo excellent mother of a large ind bon» il_ facetious fnimlj 1 itches up, and uses almost uccon^c ously, Buch phrases as " getting outsido 11 square moal," " the clerk of the »» entlior, * sho's no chickou,"or 'pilton »our»» nrpauit "and »» hen oven the f athel mochnuicillj talks ot "perform- ing lus ablutions," tho BCUSO of p ithos 0» ercomes ull ottioi ladings With such an oihibitiou beioro our ojos, »io eau oui» Icol »HUÍ lacnjMo. min 1, mid pías bj »» ith a» ertod heads As n Hilo, bo»»o»ei, pooplo »vho tako to the uso ot verb li joculai lties, combino the montai standpoint 01 tho'o who trj to bo fuunj »» ith the hollo»» spnghtlmess of mero miitiit on Ibcj have 1 hull-he irte 1 belief that tboj uro bo ng flinn» but at tlio same time, their ctuot rcaso 1 for talking about " maternal relatnos," mid "psDplo of the masculino persuasion," is the fact that the» heir t'nso V» lth »» bom thoj associato doing the sime Hie» sa», "Why this tlniäiioss P " or "A lino day foi "the ducks ' " JUBI as thej saj " Y03 "'0 "-10 ' ' As BO many p»oplo aro locului without reilly me nmg it, it nay bo » 01 th »» lulu to quotJ Bonio o-iranios of tho turns of speech that thoj should ¡1» old lu nil probability thore nro thousnul3 of persons of mo.t cxomplttr» bo'ia» tour, and of excel- lent uioril charictor in other rcspocts, »» I1030 speech is luadscrtoutly stre»\u »»ith tho % arbul ntroct tioa against »»Inch v>o aro p-otcsting, and »vho aro not in any true scnsoa»»aroof tho shocking o\ hibition tho» often make 01 themselves.
