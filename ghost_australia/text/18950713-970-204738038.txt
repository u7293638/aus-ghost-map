The Reformation of J ml as Iscarloi. THE ptoposal of the Kingston "Government to attempt reform among law practftiOhers, coming as it does, from a govelfnfiient whose name is reminist»nt of -the-Arthur will rase, -seems as much like si |oke as anything of which politicians Are«apable, but it should at least serve to tltaeot p4blic attention to ilie absurd syStete which the apathy 6f the rommunity oii the one hand, ^and the arrogance a small section of it . on the other Sss . consumnated. The/lawyer has "appsLrefttty been attached as an added horror to civilization in .most periods "of history, "and even so'far hack a^ the titans .of Le Sage, the attorney had beeenle so important an iniquity*«S to tequire a special devil .to his oW34 legal cheek. But with the making -of jaws—to which there issuo end—he kas become the " joker " in the pa^k of civilizat ion so that no' matter %hat turns up ; he is trumps. He prtirsaes the unfortunate citizen from the cradle to the grave and eyen beyond these points," for he can work up ah elaborate list of charges o\W a -document dealing, with a child still en ventre sa mere, and will shed disaster on the life accumulations of one who has long since been planted underground, by wrangling,over the last testamentary wishes of the dead. He is the prince ^of pauperisera whodfe i bill of costs i? 5 jhis " ~|»atejat '••of ; nobility and who oalls ^11 the TvorldMp to be taxed foTt his special benefit-^. But leaving altogether out of the ^question the lafge indictment which is yet to be brought agaitfst the lawyer on account 'of the Innate villaiuy of his profession and, his various misdeeds, there is ne ^aspect of bim which '^aites g omment. . ; The admission of We pi H awyer into parliament is otte of f hings which seems to proVe' that here is a blind spot ID the public eye t ust as there is, in the optic of the ndividual, a portion of the nerve which certain circumstances does no ffective wort*. The making of law ie thing whieh concerns a member of the legal profession not only as a member of the community, but may, if he is not rigidly, honest and if his judgment is not absolutely unbiassed by his own interests, be made a source of large profit to himself and to his fellows in a gi.il i which is probably the closest monopoly on earlh. So closely is the possible moral weakness of other professions watched that no member of -parliament is allowed to accept an office of profit under the government, government servants are excluded from parliament, abd no one who is pecuniarily interested in a bill before the House is allowed to take part in a vote on the question^ Yet the members of the profession which has a most immoral reputation, are not only allowed to make laws-whose imperfections are their chief source of goin, but are allowed to at the same time draw a Salary from the state and to figlit the state in courts of law. And even if there were no question of collusion- between lawyers in the Legis lature to make-law to suit themselves, the fact still remains that they are the most unfit to-engage in tfre;jPork of embodying the ' public wish into statutes. . The .lawyer is.-.trgiafsl by the- nature- of his . profession!4)ofc $0 balance and to weigh evidence' as is claimed, but to wrest ib. Qe is essentially a partisan *and unless he has the most commanding intellect must depend for success in his wbrk as much upon kite ability to make wrong appear right as on his ability to right the wrong. Further than • that, the remorseless logic of the legal gent, "ap plied to -hi&setf; *»«uy be ra^de to prove that orife half bf Ui^ pfotesRioh must either be so deliberately dishonest that it will for a fee help the wrong doer, or so ignorant of the law which it follows as a speciality that it cannot discern between right s ad wrong when brought under its exiainination. The very best that can be said df the law yer in Parliament is that, - having knowledge of the weakness of statutes through his own and his fellows' ~ Continual-attempts to pull them to pieces, bis advice may be of use on the mere wording of acts and on but on little mote. With constructive legislation he is no bettef 'fitted to deal th&n; the ordinary man of business,;, Yet the South Australian Pa Lament has alwaTs been and is now infested with members of the legal profession to, an "iiDrdinate extent, although it is stiL a notorious fact that in :.he great accom[ lished Reforms of which Soath Australians are proud no mem! er of the legal guild has taken a prominent part. Indeed the joke of expecting lawyers to reform law is only equivalent in hideous funniness to the idea of setting a tailor to f reach the abolition of frivolous fashions, or to the notion of asking a pastry cook to forward a gospel of rational debt-. Its imperfections &re; his mfeaus of livhhood and the lawyet being as impeifect as the ordinary taottal should not be expected te destroy his prop and suppeft-. one "great reform asked for fey. the, public is that the profession of law should be made frets and that the laymafi should be allowed to practise with the chartered shark in counts of justice at fees fixed by the isime description of competition wliich rules the outside world, and tinder regulations which will fall with equal severity on-all alike; Until the 1 head of the Kingston Government proposes to practically abolish llfmielf the reform of law will not eveli have begum PUSTTC SCHOOLS CONCERT.—The c6hcert arranged by Mr. J.

Crs*. B<agcW and Malone with Mr Gn pi R-. Plunkett left Millicent at about 9.30 ft.itt., abd, picking up Or. NitscJike on the way* were joined at Bendelsham by Crs. Gardner and McDonald.

Evidence of this was to be seen iu the sward of grass rising from two to four inches high behind the line of traps. The contractors, Messrs. Gurney and Battye, expected to complete the worst part of the run in about 10 da3's, and it was thought that if the work proceeds as satisfactorily as it lias done hitherto the country will be as effectually cleared as is possible. It was decided to try the new poison " death on rabbits ' in some of the fiats. The change of cattle to the sheep commonage and vice versa was found to have benefitted the stock • on both si'desi The party reached Millicent aba lit 3 JJ.itti after having accomplished a goOd deill of work and had a pleasant diy*s outidg.
