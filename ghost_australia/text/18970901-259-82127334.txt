THE SYDNEY " GHOST." to out last we published an article referring to the experiences of two Sydney constable* with what waa supposed to be a ghost io an empty bouee. Some further information is to hand. It appears that a widow and two child ren had previously oocnpied the house for three months, and recently vacated it. She utterly discredits the etory told by the police. As an explanation, she states ibata small fox-terrier, her property, has been very fond ot climbing to a small attio at the loot of the stairs, whioh is steep, and when she removed to her pre sent residence the dog would sometimes go back to his old house if the door was open, so as be could resume possession of his former lair. One day previous to the eventual night, a lady who lives in the vicinity, and has possession of the keys, lent them to some intending tinants to inspect the house, and on their return the back door bad been left open. Most probably the dog was silting on the step, and when the constables hove in sight he went upstairs. In their endeavour to approach him on tbeir final retiremeat he probably followed them down again. At any rate the dog was away from home that night and returned again on the following morning.
