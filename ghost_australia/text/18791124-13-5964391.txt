It sometimes happens that discussions anse m Puihament outside tho maia stream of business which gu e tho public a cleaier insight into tho m inner in which its pioceedin^s arcbeing conductod than moie regular debates Amongst thom wo may class the somewhat heated interchange of observations and com pliments which took place on Wednos day afternoon in connexion with tho motion which had been standing on the notice paper for some time concerning tho functions oxercised by the Commissioner of Lands and Survey Early m the session Mr GATJI» SON gave notice of his intention to move " That in tbe opinion of this Ilouse, it is againBl the fundamental principles of justice that the Lands department should m con nenon with the forfeiture of land, discharge the anomalous and inconsistent functions of ¡informe«, prosecutors judge, jury and executioner Ihe lion member for Ararat had an opportunity of bringing this motion iorward soon after it had been tabled, when it was partially debated, but since then vanous matters have stood in the way of further action However, on Wednesday last, the oidei of the day foi the resumption of the debate was called on in the usual sequence, when the mover declared his indention-of endeavouring to ascertain the opinion of the Houso on the pro position submitted Of course ho could say very little on the merits of the case, indeed it is not open to any speaker to do so The asseition contained in the resolution is self evident Nothing could possibly be more repugnant to the idea of justice than that a depart- ment-and a department is virtually the Mimstei thereof-should first convince itself, or pretend to convince itself, of a man's guilt as an e\ader of the pro visions of the land law, and thon proj ceed to try, sentence, and deprive him The veiy thought that such a system is allowed to exist in a country peopled by descendants of the English is enough to cause every intelligent man to regard the future of liberty amongst us with some concern Mr LONGMORE naturally enough defends himself by saying that he only does what the law compels lura to do, which, to a ceitam extent, is true enough To the shame of those who, to gam merely per sonal ends, assisted to frame our pie sent ridiculous, iniquitous, and shame- fully wasteful land system, the act un doubtedly arms the hon gentleman with arbitrary powers of a most extravagant kind, and m some measure he is obliged i to use them But it is evident that his obligations need only be temporary if he w ero alive, as every freeman should be, to the " humiliating position " he occupies in " discharging the moon " sistent functions named m the résolu " tion " It is open to Mr LONGMOKE or any Land Minister to propose an alteration m the law, and we have no dpubt that after what has been seen of the present Commissioners administra tion, there would be little difficulty m securing the assent of Parliament to a chango But apart altogether norn the fact that the despotic system of administra tion which exists is objectionable on general grounds, there is reason to be heve that Mr LOI>CMOKL has exagge rated every vice it possesses The Com missioner, as all who have had an oppor tumty of obsen ing him must know, is of a naiiou minded, suspicious disposi tion, alwajs íeady, with 01 without reason, to think the worst of every one Ile is a man, moreover, ot strong pre judices, which he indulges without the slightest regard foi anything but his own jleasure During his Pirlta mentary career he has exhibited a capacity for malignant vindictive ness under the co\ei of privilege, which has excited the wonder of men to whom geniality is not unknown We hav e not the least hesitation in saying that of all the membeis in the Ilouse Ali LOM Mom should have been tho \er3 last to recene the contiol of tho land Ilowevei, he was sent there by that admuable jud^e of tliaract^i Mi lLri\, and the result is just what mi¿ht ha\e been expected He passes over the proper olliceis of his dopait i îcrt, as altogether too respectable and unbending, wo suppose, foi his puiposes, and sunounds himself »ith con0ennl creatuies of his omi Gue me a select committee, sajs Mr Gvu>>,sov, and I will pro\c that the Mimstei for Lmdï has subverted the law, and that he has dnected subordinate officers to lind mon yiûly In othei woids, that Mi LOIVGJIOIL haun" on mfoimation io con ed chosen to an ive at the opinion that eel tain peisons wero dummies, he lias set inquines on foot with expiess ordeis to find grounds in supnoit of his preconceived judgment It it be ob jected that Mr G GUNSON IS such a violent opponent of the Ministry that his asseitioii must be accepted cum gi ano '¡ah , we can only îeply tint what ho asseited is substantially coi îoboiatcd by Mi \OUÎ,G Noone can accuse the lion niembci for kyneton of being an unreasonable or exticmc politician It is true that he sits in the Opposition Comer, but ti at fict in itself, we pitsutuu, is not suffiaeiit to invalidate the testimony of an othei wiso exceptionally trustwoithj man \Miat, then, does Mr YOUM say upon tho subject 1 Ile says that foifeitures aie recommended by Ciown lands bailifls, "who aie the lowest class of " officials m tho service, that some of these officeis-Mi LOIXGMOUL'J special pets- ficquently come to town to bo " closeted with the Mimstei, that then repoitsare coiibideiedby men who, undei the present reign of " liberal terroii°ni, cannot "call their souls then 1 " own," and that, finally, Uie farce is consummated by appeals being adjudi- cated upon by the Minister, who origin ally set matters in train in collusion \vitfi his tame bailiffs. That these, thing« aro dono and permitted in an English community is a consideration which should make every man amongst us hang his head in ohamo. Some people may think it improbable, that any officers in the Government sei vice would consent to become tools in the hands of such a Minister ; hut a man like Mr. LONGMORE will never lack conven.ent instruments to carry out his wishes so long as he has the wheiewitlial to reward their services. Mr. GAUN^ON said on Wednesday-" Seo the promo " tion which had been given to Bailiff " M'LEAN. Because the Minister " could not get tho inspector of " bailiffs, Mr. BLACK, to do his " dil ty work, ho dismissed that " officer, and elevated M'LEAN to " tho position. Tho Minister and " M'LEAN wero closeted together daily " and hourly, and ho believed that " M'LEAN had roeoived a rise of ¿200 " in his salary." Who could doubt In_pecting Bailiff M'LEAN'S zeal, alacrity, discrimination, and sweet reasonableness after tho establishment of such intimate and pleasing relations with his honourable chief 1 Mr. YOUNO lia3 something to say on this point also, and a very nice state of affcirs his re- marks disclose : "As to tho underling of tlio department who went to the Kerang inquiry, he went thither by horse and buggy, but the district surveyor and other members of the board went by coach. He had bia buggy and pair at livery at on hotel for several daya, and sent in a bill for £20 or £25 for the expenses of the irip. When an officer of the depart- ment was required to certify the account, it was brought under the notico of the secre- tary, who left it to be inferred that the bailiff waa a pet of the Minister's, and ought to be M ritten to in a mild manner not to incur like expenditure again. In reply, he sent a letter to say that be had no instructions from the head of the department, but acted in the confidence of the Minister of Lands." Apparently, it virtually comes to this Mr. LONGMORE is in daily and confi- dential communication with a number of irresponsible spies, who furnish him with information which may, or may not, bo true. Having made up his mind what course he will take, in consultation with these delectable creatures, ho orders a terrified department to take any steps that may be necessary to enable him to give effect judicially to the decision he has already arrived at. Wje think it is high time that the com- mittee asked for by Mr. GAUNSON should be granted, in order that tho doings of our agrarian Star Chamber moy be dragged into the light of day. We" trust that the bon. member will not ?Insist from his efforts, either in or out of Parliament, until he has succeeded ia overthrowing the degrading and con- temptible tyranny which has growu out of " liberal " attempts to carry out settlement in defiance of economic law. Knowing the influences which ate at v.oik, we are not surprised at the per sistent attacks made upon the stock depaitment In tho Assembly on Thursday they took a moro definite form than usual The system of in spection was denounced as useless, and our herds, it was said, are endangered by the free admission into the colony o\ er the border of diseased stock The state- ment vihich appeared to create the most alarm in the Houso waa -hut which re lated to the crossing at Wahgunyah of a mob of cattle amongst which pleuro pneumonia was subsequently re ported to have made its appearance Why such an incident should cause so mich anuety is not v ery apparent to those acquainted with the facts If tho disease Vi ere a new one we could under stand the scare j but so far from this being the case, pleuro pneumonia is common to all these colonies, and it is doubtful whether there ia u single herd m Australia entirely free from it Like the maladies which afflict the human race, and take then place year after year m the death returns, pleuro pneumonia is a steady and constant source of mortality amongst our cattle It breaks out here and there from time to time, without any distinct cause, and after making its ap pdarance in this or that herd, dies away without peihaps spreading beyond tho faim or the district in which it occurred A diseased heid would, however, con stitute a distinct centre of contagion, and unhealthy cattle coming to tho bolder should of course be stopped With respect to the Wahgunyah mob thcie is at present no evi dence whatevei of neglect on the pait ot atij oflicer of the department No diseased stock came under the notice of the mspectoi at the crossing place, and accoiding to the local press, the mob m question was apparently healthy when it entei ed the colony, how long ago ia not stated, nor does the date appear to bo know n No report on the subject has icnched the department, and the whole thing may turn out to be a maie s w t \et such is the scato which has talson I ossession of tht, Munster s mind tint because tho chief inspector received an unauthcnticated report with caution, and did notgne waj to panic, Mr BntitY t îlks about the suspension of tho othcul and the sweeping awi} of th" depart mont If he knew as well as others do how often the ciy of " wolf ' has been laired with the ddibeiate purpose of disci editing tho depai tinent, and cn. ltuy mischief, Ins angoi would bo tinned in another dnection The 01 yin of tho whole agitation ia OMdent enough Who bim¿s foi wird these stones ot destiuctive diseases and incompetent inspectors 1 Not the stock owners, who would suffci from such a state of things, but ono of the . embers for Richmond, Mr L L SMITH, piomptcd and inspired by Mi Gi UIVM MJICIILLL, vetennary surgeon 'Mr Mildil IL s hostility lo tho depaitment has been long known The reason of it is no secret to those connected with -tod. matters, and it fully accounts for the peculiar position which ho occupies Although he is employed by tho Go \ernmeut, he has been working against the department for the piomotion of his own puiposes , not, however, with very pronounced success, foi the Cmei Secretaiy has discovered tint IIB actions have "greatly domorahsed "tho department," and ho is «« cordmgly to bo " brought to book. The mgiatitudo of Chief Secretan"» temblé to bear Tor it should bo known that Mi MUGIIELT has exerted litnseu greatly foi the puohc welfare Ho m recently devoted both timo and money to provo tho oxistenco of a disoase amongst the Queensland cattle which ho calls " yellow fever," but which the Stock department does not appear to recognise, and about which Queensland stockowners and inspectors, and Queens- land newspapers also, havo been strangely reticent. Printed circulars descriptive of the " yellow fever " have been dis- tributed far and wide, and the disease IÎ6«Vound its way into Mr. MITCHELL'S correspondence also. Mr. L. L. SMITH opened tho discussion in the As- sembly by reading a letter from Mr. MITCHELL to Inspector Binixs, in which the admission of Mr. JAMES TYSON'S cattlo was reported against. The cattlo wero admitted, howevor, and ono of them died, the cause of death, according to Mr. MITCHELL, being "yollow fever." Mr. MITCHELL also said that " recently " a mob of cattle from Queensland, bo " longing to the same owner, sustained " a loss of over 80 head, near Melbourne, " probably from the same disease." It is curious to noto with regard to these .80 head of cattle which died at Paken- ham, that we were asked at tho time, by a person not unknown to Mr. MITCHELL, to report their death, with the addition that they belonged to a large mob " apparently very much " diseased." Doubting the bona fides of our informant, we took no notice of the communication, but -the report having reached the Stock department an inspector was sent to Pakenham. His investigations showed that the cattle, numbering 500, had como from Mr. TYSON'S station in New South Wales ; that at Caulfield, when ?on'their way to Gipps Land, they had ?" eaten a lot of heath, which brought on ." a sort of black scour which was fatal " to about 80 head. This mortality gave " rise to the rumour that the mob had "pleuro-pneumonia." Other sensational reports have been disposed of in a similar way. To go back to " yellow " fever," it is singular, we repeat, that its existence has been reported by Mr. MITCHELL and by no ono else, aud we have no assurance . that he will adhere to the theory himself, for wo have it on the authority of the Attorney-General that when he was temporarily in charge of the department Mr. MITCHELL sent a telegram from Swan-hill to stop the crossing of cattle, because they were diseased, and that when he got to town he wrote an official report upon which the cattle had to bo admitted. This is the gentleman who tries to frighten the colony with " yellow fever," and Í3 permitted to ." demoralise " the department. That the department is really demoralised there is nothing to show, but it is cer- tainly inviting demoralisation to allow a mischief-maker to continue his con- nexion with it when his tactic3 havo .been exposed. If there is anything radically wrong with the department it should be plainly stated. In the Assembly the state- ments made were of the most vague character. Emboldened by a few im- patient words which fell from the Chief ? Secretary, Mr. L. L. SMITH declared that the inspectors "had been of no " use whatever," but the only ground upcix lyhich he ventured to malee the ..statement was that "not a dozen con " victions" had taken place. Sup- posing this to bo so, does it prove negligence or incapacity1? If .convictions under the act are few, it would seem to indicate that the breaches of its provisions have been few also, for it is incrediblo that systematic neglect can have been practised with such eager fault-finders as Mr. MIT- CHELL on the watch, and with a vigilant press in every corner of the colony. There are, besides, the stock boards, whoso province it is to advise with the inspectors and report tho existence of disease in their districts ; but as far as we are aware,' stock has been tolerably free from disease for some years, and its condition has, on the whole, never been more satisfactory than now. Pleuro-pneumonia, it is true, exists, and it is to be feared always will exist, for it has nover yet been eradicated from any country in which it has once gained a footing. The fact that wo have pleuro-pneumonia and can never get rid of it is, however, a very strong reason why the efficiency of the stock department should be strengthened rather than weakened, so that equally intractablo diseases, which wo are for- tunate enough to be without, may not bo brought in. Mr. Zox, who appeared to sympathise with the alarmists, quoted some startling figures, showing that the losses from diseases in stock in Australia, up to 187-1, had amounted to the enormous sum of ¿£35,000,000, of which scab in sheep accounted for .£20,000,000. The hon. momber ap- peared to forget (and others, perhaps, share in his forgetfulness) that Victoria is indebted lor the extinction of that frightful scourge to the stock depart- ment, and to the regulations which wore suggested and administered by Mr. CUPJI, tho permanent head. To sup- pose that the same department is unable to cope with a few cases of pleuro pneumonia, and the supposititious " yellow fever " of Mr. GRAHAM MITCHELL, is sheer nonsense.
