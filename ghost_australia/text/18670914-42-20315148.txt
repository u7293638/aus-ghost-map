METROPOLITAN SPRING RACE MEETING, 1867. The Derby Day. LOVELY weather, a moderately large attend-<*> ance of spectators, very fair fields of bones, ex-<*> cellent sport, and an absence of everything in the shape of accident, were some of the cha- ! racterieticß of the first day of the Metropolitan Spring Race Meeting—the day on which the I much-coveted " Blue Biband of the Turf in this colony -was contested for. 1 The sport prorided on Saturday was of a very high order, there being a good contest for every one of the five prizes in the programme. The Trial Stakes brought a field of seven to the post'the winner being found in Mr. T. H. Smith's chestnut horse Springbok, the stable companion of Bouqnet, who is in the Metropo litan Stakes.- The Richmond horse, Gratis, was the most fancied for this race, while a large number of people pinned their faith to Butter fly—not so much from any belief that she pos sessed any wonderful speed as from the facts that she was by William Tell and carried a very lightweight. Not a few trusted to old Rarey, with Ashworth up, in the " yellow and black," to pull them through; but the pdor old horse ; that has hitherto been considered indestructible, , broke down badly, although he managed to secure the honour of third place, the favourite beirg second. Springbok, car rying 8 st. 12 lbs., won the race ; cleverly ; and if Bouquet, of the same year, can beat him easily, as is stated, she ' ought to have a chance for the Metropolitan, • seeing she has but 7 st. 7 lbs. to carry. The ' next race was the Derby St. Leger Handicap, : for which there were fourteen subscribers, three \ only of whom came to the post. There has : been but little speculation on this race, except in doubles and trebles, as it was seen from the first that there would be a very small field; \- and in all the doubles and trebles either Sea , gull or Hamblcdon Hill (except a few on Bylong while it was believed he had any chance for the race) were selected to pull off the first event. We never heard of a single wager in which Sir John was backed either right out or ! in a double or treble event; having proved [ such a duffer hitherto, it was thought he had not got the ghost of a chance, notwithstanding the difference in weight, either with Seagull lor Hambledon Hill. It was in fact— ; as a Turf writer recently wrote of another event—a " Bothichild's office to a casual ward" against him. The event proved, how ' ever, that Sir John —who was never in such form as now—was too good, at the weights, for . Seagull, who never had a show for it from the ! fall of the flag, and that Hamblcdon Hill could ! not give him 7 lbs., and travel with him for ! the last two hundred yards of two miles. His ■ owner, the Judge, was warmly congratulated upon his victory. Ist Dkbby, buu 2kd Ssptbhbee, 1865. Mr. Cheeke's br.f. Clove, by Magus, out of Clove (Martineer).

Time—2 mm. 48 sec. j It will be observed that the time of the Derby on Saturday was the best that has yet been made, and it is a significant fact that it was '. half a second less than the last Derby at Epsom, won by Hermit, was run in. 1 The Innkeepers' Stakes brought a field of eight to the post, and the winner was found in Mr. Cobcroft's Paganini—a rank outsider, de ' feating Barebones (the favorite), Archer, and i others. The Epsom Handicap was believed to | be a gift to old Birmingham (Sainsworth and i Lady Kingston having been withdrawn), and |so the event proved. He won it in a canter. j The following is a detailed account of the run i ning :— ; First Bace.—The Trial Stakes of 4 sovereigns ; each, with 40 sovereigns added, for 3 yean and i upwards, which have not won a prize exceeding j 50 sovereigns in value up to time of entrance. : li mile. Mr. T. H. Smith's ch.h. Springbok, 4 years, 8 st. 12 lbs (Ramsay) 1 Mr. W. Towns' b.g. Gratis, 4 years, 8 st. 9 lbs. (Cavanagb) 2 Mr. J. Tait's b.g. Rarey, aged, 9 st. 5 lb. (Ashworth) 3 Mr. George Hall's b.f. Butterfly, by William i Tell, out of Butteifly, 3 yean, 6 st. 12 lbs. : Mr. C. H. Roberts' ch.h. Mickey Free, by Cossack, out of Blue Bonnet, 5 yean, 9 st. 5 lbs. Mr. R. Rouse, jun.'s b.g. Whalebone, aged, I 9 st. 5 lbs. Mr. G. Matthew's bLg. Smuggler, 4 yean, 8 j st. 9 lbs. j Betting: sto 2 against Gratia, 3 to*l against I Butterfly, 4 to 1 each against Springbok and ! Rarey, 5 to 1 against any other. After a couple of attempts, in which Gratis and Whalebone got knocked about a little, an excellent start was effected. The horses sprang away in line, Whalebone showing in front with Springbok and Gratis. Passing' the Stand, Springbok was leading by a couple of lengths, Whalebone second, and the others in a ruck, except Mickey Free, who was last. At the I Rocks, Whalebone went up and took the lead, ; Springbok hanging close ou his quarter, Gratis j running third, Rarey fourth, and the remainder tof the field tailing off. At the far corner, ; Whalebone increased his lead, but Gratis now : began to go up, closely followed by Butterfly, and these two, after a few strides with Whale bone, then took first and Becond places, Springbok lying third, Rarey fourth, and Whalebone beaten off altogether. Opposite : the Trainer's Stand, Butterflr went to the front for a few strides, but Gratis caught her again at the Derby Corner and raced with her neck and neck info the straight, i Springbok three lengths in the rear. In coming ! up between' the rails, Springbok put on the | steam, passed Butterfly, and challenged Gratis, j whose jockey found himself compelled to use i the whip rather vigorously. The bay horse, j however, took his punishment without mending • his pace, and Springbok won hard held, by I about two lengths, Gratis second, Rarey third, i Butterfly fourth, Whalebone fifth, and Smug , gler sixth. ; Time—2 minutes 20 seconds. { Second Bace.—The Derby St. Leger Handicap \ Sweepstakes, of-10 sovereigns each for accep tors, h. ft.; 200 sovereigns added; for 4 yean; 2 miles; second horse 40 sovereigns from the prize. Entrance closed with 14 subscribers. Mr. Chaafens' br.c. Sir John, 7 st. 7 lbs. '.. (Green) 1 Mr. Martin Gibbon's b.c. Hambledon Hill, Sat. (Thompson) 2 Mr. C. B. Fisher's ro.f. Seagull, Bst. 51bs. j Betting: Even on Hambledon Hill, sto 4 \ against Seagull, 4 to 1 against Sir John, offered. The flag fell to a very bod start, Hambledon ' Hill going away with a strong lead, Sir John I second, and Seagull six or eight lengths behind. I At the Derby Corner, Sir John got up within j reach of the Hill, and waited for him, Seagull beiag still a long way in the rear, and the pace being very slow. The horses came up the Straight in the same order, Seagull gradually closing up, and on passing the Stand the Hill was leading, Sir John being two lengths behind him, and about three lengths in . advance of Seagull. The same order was maintained to the Rocks, when the Gull made an effort, and at the far corner passed Sir John, and closed with Hambledon Hill, the pace mending considerably. At the back of the course the Hill got away from Seagull again I and took a lead of about a length, Sir John col- I laring the filly and running neck and neck with i her up to the three-quarter mile post, where : Seagull fell back. At the Derby Corner, Sir John went up in gallant style and closed with the Hill, who kept the lead to the distance post, , and then by dint of flogging raced nearly neck i and neck with the Baronet. The result was ! doubtful up to the last few strides, when Sir ! John won, defeating Hambledon Hill by about ! a length, Seagull nowhere. : Time—3 minutes 46 seconds. , Third Race.—The (Australian) Derby Stakes of 30 soys. each, h. ft., for three yeats; colts, Bst. lOlbs.; fillies, Bst. 51bs.

Betting: 6to 4 against Fireworks, 2to 1 against Little Fish, 4 to 1 each against Van- I derdecken and Glencoe, 6 to 1 against The I Italian, 10 to 1 each against Carnation and I Orlando. The horses got away on pretty equal terms with each other—Fireworks taking a slight lead, Italian second, Glencoe third, and Little Fish fourth. Passing the Stand, Fireworks and Italian were neck-and-neck in front, The Fish : third, Glencoe fourth, Carnation fifth, and Orlando all behind. At the Rocks, Italian took the lead, with Fireworks close up to him; and Vanderdecken, who had been creeping np gradually, in the third best place. The same order was maintained for the next hundred yards, when Vanderdecken passed into second place, Fireworks falling to the rear and keeping company with Orlando. Along the back of the course Italian led by a couple of lengths, Vanderdeken second, Car nation third, Fireworks (about three lengths behind in the fourth place, and Glencoe fifth. Opposite the Trainers' Stand the second and third horses closed up together, and the pace became very hot. At the Derby Corner, Stanley took Fireworks up, with a rush past Carnation and Vanderdecken to Italian's flank, the others falling back. In coming up between the rails, Fireworks headed the Italian, and won easily, hard held; Italian second; Glencoe, who came with a spurt in the last few strides, and Carnation, a dead heat for the third place ; Van derdecken fifth ; Orlando sixth ; and Littls Fish last of all. Time—2 minutes 48 seconds. Fourth Race.—The Innkeepers' Stakes of 7 sovereigns each, with 70 sovereigns added, for 3 years and upwards, which have not won a prize exceeding 100 sovereigns in value up to the time of entrance, a winner of snch a prize thereafter to carry 3 lbs. extra; maidens at start ing allowed 5 lbs.; If mile; second horse 14 sovereigns out of the prize; 11 subscribers.

Betting: 6 to 2 against Barebones, 3to 1 against Archer, 4 to 1 against Emerald, 5 to 1 each against Newington, Duke of Athol,- *nd Paganini. After one fruitless attempt, in which the Duke of Athol had a short gallop on his own account, the horses got away in very good order, Archer springing to the front, but after a few strides giving place to Emerald, who, at the Derby Corner, led by several lengths, with Newington second. Paganini dropped into the background immediately after the start, and re mained behind for some time. Coming up the straight running Emerald had a strong lead, with Newington second, Barebone third, Stumpy fourth, with Archer and Paganini keep ing each other company in the rear. At the Rooks the tail of the field began to close up, with the exception of Paganini, who still held back. At the far corner Emerald still led, bnt was closely pressed by Barebones and Newington, who were well up to the front. At the back of the course Archer put on the steam, but could not catch the leader, who continued to show the way np to the Derby Corner, where Barebones took the lead. Here Paganini was called on, and answered gallantly, coming up at a slashing pace passing all the field, and taking up a good lead. Satanella got up to second place, but Archer came with a rush, and finished with a dead heat with her for second place. Paganini was landed an easy winner. Barebones was fourth, and the rest came straggling in many lengths in the rear. Time—3 minutes 19 seconds. Fifth Race.—The Epsom Handicap of 5 sovereigns each, h. ft., with 50 sovereigns added for 3 years and upwards ; 1 mile ; second horse 10 sovereigns from the prize. 13 subscribers. Mr. G. K. Waldron's b.g. Birmingham, aged; Bst. 61bs (Donnelly) 1 Mr. A. Campbell'b eh.m. Stranger, 6 years ; 7st. 21bs (T. Brown) 2 Mr. W. Towns' b.m. Ludia, 5 years ; Bat. 41bs ... (Cavanagh) 3 Mr. A. Bowman's gr.m. Maritana, 5 years; Bst. Mr. E. Cobcroft's b.f. Miss Coroebns, 4 years; 7st. 61bs. Betting: Even on Birmingham, 3to 1 each against Stranger aud Maritana, 4 to 1 against Ludia, 5 to 1 against Miss Coroebns. After a false start occasioned by Birmingham's anxiety to get away, the horses went off in a ruck, Miss Coroebns showing in the van for a few strides. Stranger, however, soon darted to the front, and took np a good lead, Birmingham second, and Ludia third. At the back of the course Stranger slightly increased her lead, while Ludia fell off. Opposite the stand Birmingham began to make his way to the fore; but when entering the rails Stranger still had the lead, and looked very much like a winner. Coming down the straight, however, Birming ham went up, and at the distance post passed her, winning by about a length, hard held, Stranger second, Ludia a bad third, Miss Coroabus fourth, and Maritana nowhere. Time—l minute 48& seconds.. This was the last of the races on the card, and concluded an excellent day's sport.— S. M. Herald, September 3. Tattebsall's.—The settling on the Derby- Day took place at TattersalTs last night, and so far as we saw went off satisfactorily. After the settling there was some speculation on the forth coming events, the betting being for the most part on the Maiden Plate and Metropolitan. For the former, Fireworks, Carnation, Paganini, Springbok, and North Australian were the most fancied; and for the latter Yattendon main tained his pride of place at 4 to 1, Tim Whiffler coming next at about 6to 1. The offer on any of the remainder was 10 to 1. The running of Sir John And Birmingham, and the stable com panion of the Bouquet (Springbok) on Satur day, brought them more prominently into notice, and it will be observed that they brought good prices in the sweeps that were drawn. Sweeps were drawn on both the Maiden Plates and Metro politan races. In a £2 sweep on the Maiden Plate, which amounted at the finish to £37 55., the following prices were realised :—Fireworks, £12 ; Paganini, £7; Coronation, £6 10s ; North Australian, £6; Springbok, £3; the others being knocked down at the upset price. In another £2 sweep on the Metropolitan, which reached £92, the horses sold as follows:— Yattendon, £19 ; Tim Whiffler, £10; Bouquet, £8 ; Bulgimbar, £7 10s.; Sir John, £7; War wick, £6 10s.; Rainsworth, £6; Birmingham, £6; Rose of Australia, £6; Hambledon Hill, £5 ; Phoebe, £4 10s.; Lady Kingston, £3 155.; Archer, £3 55.; Exile, £3 ; Beatrice, £2 10s. The rooms will be open every night during the week. — Ibid, September 4. Second Day. The races were really excellent. For the Shorts Stranger and Hamlet were equal favorites at 2 to 1 on the field, but Mr. O'Malley's Gu nilda carried off the prize. For the Ladies' Cup, Falcon was the favorite, and was looked upon almost as a certain winner; not more than 6 to 4 could be obtained against him from the bookmakers. Gulnare was the next in favor, and she won the race easily; Rioter, second; Satanella, third ; and the favorite fourth. The Maiden Plate was the next event. Fireworks, of course, was the favorite. After the first three- quarters of a mile the race was between Mr. Taitf s two horses, and Fireworks won by about half a length, the other horses making a poor show i and nearly all distanced. The event of the day was the Great Metropolitan Stake*, with thirty-nine subscribers. Seventeen horses came to the post, and a finer field was seldom seen at Randwick. Yattendon had been first favorite since the closing of the entrances, and np to the time of starting not greater odds than three to 1 could be obtained against him. Tim Whiffler was the next in favor and betting, while nearly every horse that came to the poet had some backers. The race—two miles—was run in 3 minutes 38 6-10 seconds, the fastest on record in the Australian colonies, and the prize was carried off by Mr. De Mestre's Tim Whiffler. Rose of Australia was an excellent second, Bir mingham a good third, and the favorite fourth. The fifth race, the Squatters' Purse, was won by Mr. Towns' 3-year-old horse Orlando. The following is a detailed account of each race :— First Racb.—The Shorts Handicap, of 5 soys. each; three-quarters of a mile. Mr. O'Malley's b.f. Gunilda, 4 years, 7st. lllbs. 1 Mr. W. Town's b.m.

Ivory's gr.g.Busben, 6 years, 7st.2lbs. Betting: 2 to 1 each against Stranger and Hamlet, 3 to 1 Gunilda, and 4 to 1 each against the remainder. After two false starts, in which Gunilda did a little gallop on her own account, the horses were got away on pretty equal terms. Gunilda took the lead, closely followed by Ham let, Ludia, and Maritana, Stranger and the Wallaby being last. At the Rocks Stranger went np amongst the leading horses, and Ludia followed suit. At the Derby Corner Gunilda was still leading easily, Hamlet next, and Stranger and Ludia racing at the top of their speed. In the straight running Ham let was passed, and the event concluded by Gunilda winning easily by four or five lengths, Ludia and Stranger running a dead heat for second place; Hamlet about four lengths behind.

Barebones, aged, 9st. Slbs. Mr. Chaaffe ns br.c. Emerald, 4 years, Bst. 121b. Betting: 6 to 4 against Falcon and Rioter, and 2 to 1 against Gulnare There were three or four false starts before the horses were got away, and when the flag fell Satanella went away to the front, Bare bones close np, Rioter, Gulnare, Emerald, and Falcon bringing up the rear. At the back of the course, Emerald tailed off, the horses keep ing their relative positions, only getting closer together. At the Derby corner, Satanella was still leading, Rioter next, and Faloon third. Barebones now fell off, beaten, and Gulnare put on the steam, and passed ell the horses in coming into the straight running. Falcon was passed by Satanella, and all were brought to the whip. After an excellent race Gulnare came in first by about a length, Rioter second, half a length in advance of Satanella, Falcon fourth, three lengths in the rear of Satanella. Time, 1 mm. 50 6*lo* sec.

Betting: Even on Fireworks against the field; 4to 1 against North Australian; 6to 1 against Paganini. After numerous attempts a tolerable start was at length effected, in which Glencoe went to the front, Fireworks, Carnation,. Newington, North Australian, Springbok, and Paganini, following almost in single file. They kept in this order past the stand to the Rocks, and at the back of the course Glencoe had a very strong lead, the other horses being close together. Fireworks here appeared to fall back, but in coming to the Derby turn he put out, and after passing all the other horses, collared Glencoe. Down the straight running the race was neck and neck between Glencoe and Fireworks, but on nearing the stand, Stanley gave the favorite a little en couragement, and he passed his stable com panion, winning by half a length. Carnation was third, about twenty lengths behind. New* ington fourth. Time, 2 mm. 44 sees.

There was a good deal of bother in getting the horses away, and when the flag fell Archer and Beatrice took the lead at racing speed, the remainder of the horses being all of a heap behind, Yattendon and Tim Whiffler being kept in the rear. At the Derby Corner, the first time round, Beatrice was leading, and Archer fell gradually behind. On passing the Grand Stand the first time, Rainsworth had pushed through the ruck to the front, Beatrice next, Hambleton Hill, Birmingham, and Lady Kingsford close up. On coming up to the Rocks Birmingham passed the leading horses and got a very strong lead by the time the horses had reached the back of the course, Rainsworth next, and Rose of Australia on his flank. The whole field was going at a tremen- dous speed, when, before turning the Derby Corner, Yattendon and Tim Whiffler separated themselves from the mob, and drew towards the leading horses. The excitement became intense as they turned into the straight run- ning. Tim Whiffler now rapidly drew to the front, and, after a gallant struggle, won by about a length and a half, Rose of Australia second, and Birmingham third, about half a length behind the Rose, Yattendon fourth, close up. Time, 3 mm. 38 6.10 sec, fastest two mile race in the colonies. Fifth Race.—The Squatters' Stake* of 6 soys. each, with 60 soys. added, for 3 years and upwards, whioh have not won a prize ex- I ceeding 30 soys. in value up to time of en trance.

On nearing the Rocks Butterfly fell to the rear, Orlando still leading, Eugene next, and Buc caneer third. At the back of the course the black hor.e was let out, and he took up the second running, but at the Derby Corner he fell off beaten. The race was now clearly Or lando's, and he came in a winner by six or seven lengths, Butterfly beating Eugene for second place by about half a length. Both the second and third horses were severely punished. Third Day. The day was beautifully fine, with a cool south-easterly breeze, which rendered the day the most pleasant of tho meeting. For the Craven Plate, although there were fifteen horses entered, twelve of them were scratched, and the race was left to the Rose of Australia, Yatten don, and Tim Whiffler. The races were the best contested and most exciting of the meeting, and, unlike most affairs of the kind, the favorites won in every instance, by which the bookmakers must have lost very heavily. In tbe Craven Stakes there never was a gamer straggle than that between Yattendon and Tim Whiffler ; and, although Tim was beaten by the brown horse, it was no easy con quest, seeing that Mr. De Mestre's horse car ried lllbs. more than on the previous day in the Metropolitan Handicap. The Prince of Wales Stakes was an easy victory for Young Mormon; for, although he was last nearly all the race, he came np when he was'wanted and won by two lengths, hard held. The Italian was the first favorite for the Produce Stakes (mares'), and Glencoe was next in de mand ; the former won by about half a length after a splendid race. In the Bydney Handicap Warwick was the favorite, while Beatrice, Gul nare, and Phoebe had their respective admirers ; bat the result showed that tile old chesnut had not forgotten how to race. The following is a detailed account of each event: — First Race.—The Craven Plate of 100 sovs., for 3 years and upwards ; l¼ mile. 20 subs. Mr. O'Malley's br.h. Yattendon, 6 years, 9st. 8lbs. ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... 1 Mr. E. De Mestre's b.h. Tim Whiffler, 5 years, 9st. 5lbs. ... ... ... ... ... ... 2 Mr. J. Eales junr's. br.m. Rose of Australia, 5 years, 9st. ... ... ... ... ... ... ... 3 Betting: 5 to 4 on Yattendon, 5 to 4 against Tim Whiffler, and 4 to 1 against Rose of Aus- tralia. A good start was effected, and for the first 200 yards the horses raced neck and neck, when Tim Whiffler went to the front, Yatten- don next, and the Rose of Australia next, about a length apart. In this order they passed the Rocks and the back of the course, the distance being a little widened between them. At the trainers' stand the Rose passed Yattendon, and the race became very exciting. At the Derby turn Tim was still leading, Rose next, when Yattendon was let out, and on entering the straight running was abreast of the Whiffler. The pace now was tremendous, and the punish- ers were pretty freely administered to Whiffler, who raced beautifully, but Yattendon passed him, winning by about half a length, Rose of Australia fire lengths in the rear.
