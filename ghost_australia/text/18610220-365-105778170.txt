SYDNEY. S(rone our correspondent.) Friday afternoon. T'ri Assembly has got on very well so far with the land bill, having last night passed the filtoodith clause. There was a hard tussel to make "no house," on account of the cricket match but Mr. Robertson has evidently resolved to submit to no avoidable delays. The amendment on the 15th clause, proposed and carried by MIr. Walsh last night, will be generally accepted as an improvement. It provides that if the land selected and occupied be not surveyed by the Government within twelve months of such selection and oecupation, the selector may forego his choice and demand tihe return of his deposit. This will certainly meet many objections that had been raised with reference to probable litigation and disputes as to boundaries. Thedesira bleness of an ultimate survey is beyond dispute; and as the man who wants land will now be able to pick it out for himself, with the -assurance that his boundaries will be authoritatively defined within a year, there seems no room for the croaking furebod ings that we have heard its reference to this ianrt of the subject. Six months. as originally proposed by Mr. Walsh, would have been too short a period to have given to tihe government. The longer period was adopted at the suggestion and with the con currence of Mr. IRobertson. Our belliwelher, l?edman, bestowed a portion of his tediousness upon the House again last night, in the shape of an amendment to nuthorise seleotors to employ licensed surveyors if they pleased. His rising was the signal for a general clear out -a large number of members seeking safety in flight, just as if a mad dog had been let loose amongss them, with a tin kettle at his tail. Redman can't complain that he doesn't create a sensation. If fencing Forster (as great a Ihumbug as the other) entertains any animosity for his defeat, hie is umply avenged. Redman clears the house like a patient brolke loose with a bad case of small-pox, or a tugitive firom Bed lain with a propensity for biting. Of course his amendmlent failed, and when he shut up the mem bers came in again. Tihe English news, as you will see, is rather favor able to peace at present-but there is no certainty. France advocates the sale of Venetia by Austria, and it is known that Enigland favors that proposal also, while Prussia has no objection to it. For the sake of humanity, it is to be hoped that Austria will submit, otherwvise" there will be terrible work next spring. But then will come the question of rtome ia question full of thorny dilliculties. Sir Alfred Stephen has come back to his berth, and I fancy that Sir John Dickinson will now retire on hiis pension. The mail steamer reached Mel. bourne at six o'clock this morning, so I presume she will be here oil Sulday night. I doefr till to- morrow nay remarks I may have to make about the cricket matlch-excepting simply these: The crowd is not nearly so great as on the similar occasion two years ago; the interest is how ever increasing; but our men are getting unpopular. Your unsuccessful man, itl faet, never is popular. The persistent manner in whicl our side cnlltinues to lose is very unpleasant to betters, no doubt. At the present moment the odds are heavy on thee tlel bournites. I sbhall give no figures, however, as you will know more by telegraph before this comes to Ihand. Intelligenceo has been received hero that three natives, sent by the Governsr of New Caledonia with despatches from Plort do France to KaIala, had been murdeted, aind their despatches burnt by the aborigines, against whom the Governor had since marched with two hundred soldiers. Saturday afternoono. " No IIHouse". yesterday. I don't know at, on tihe whole, there was much reason to regret it, for, with the late hours that are kept, an afternoon on tihe cricket ground is not a great piece of extruva gance. And it is there that tile mnemubers were iecordingly, until'they thought it time to malok for thue Parliament Hlouse, when (no doubt to their grievous annoyanlee) tile domaini entlrancei was locked and they. ad to go round by Maucquario street; thuss just managing to arrive after the Speaker had adjourned for want of a quorum: They were quite excusable. When I sent off my letter yesterday the cricket match was going on biut dully, uud the chance for our mutn was dooniedl ut slight. B But soon nfterwards matters changed. Newcombe ran up a score of 2. antd Ktettle, though Inmed by a ball, scored 9; Gilbert, lowever, making the runs fir him. by agreemenrt. The crowd now increased rapidly, until it swelled to a number as large as that present two years ago, and the ] interest and excitement were very great. Just at this tine a misunderstanding ocenrred: Gilbert was making the runs for Kettle's batting, the latter being lame, and he had just made a run f?r one and had passed the wicket, when Kettle himself, who had turned from his wicket, was put out by Mr. Marshall-acting oi the opinion that, though Gil bert was running ftcr Kittle, the latter mlst be at the stumps befoire tie ball came tp,just as if he were running foir himself. 'lThe Victorian umpire decided against IKottle, whereupon there was a great "sensation," not only amongst tihe cricketers, but in the crowd also, the Srydney people siding with our ment. At first the Victorians went to their teint in a body, and there seemed a chance of breakltitg tip the game; but finally tlhe playing proceeded. E?ttloe was allowed his run, and. I believe, the point is reserved. The Sydney eleven wound up, as I told you by telegraph, wiih a score of 74; and the Victorians went in. There was great applause (not very polite to them) when their first two men were put out without a sigile score. Twenty-six, how ever, were run up before the men adjourned; but four of their best players were then out. The gamue, therefore, as, it opened to-day was as follovis: New South Wales, first innings, 71; Victoria, first innings, 68, second ditto, 26-94. The Victorians had therefhre six mnore wickets to increase their score by; after which New South WVales had to get her second innings. The chances were considered tolerably even. Betting hero was in favour of Sydney, but in Melbourneit was the other way. The day is fine, but hot annd doubtful. Of course the interest in the match is now at culminating point. I shall send the score on Monday. "Their lordships the bishops" have made a dead sat against the Church and School l.ands Bill. Having obtained leave t hbe heard by counsel at the bar ofthe House, the BIishop ofiydney has employed Sir Willitam Manning and Mr. Darvall, and the Arch bishop has secured the services of Mr. Dalley. The windy exhiitiuon was expected to have come off yesterday, if the HIouse had sat. There is the deuce to pay it tile police and gaol departments. Thie inquiry respecting Captain Battye's arrangements has been for some time pro ceeding, and tiat officer is in Sydney to give an anecount thereof. As to the gaol departmenot, the result of inquiries into alleged abuses is, that the sheriff, the governor of the gaol, and the principal turnkey are suspended, and Mr. Inspector Read, the same who ferreted out the Goulburnt-strect brothels, owned by Mr. Hunt, has gone up to tstak charge of the pouol for the present. I will not repeat mere rumours as to the nature of the charges, us this will be made public in a few days. 'Bell's Life' says:-" Cavanagh, one of the two Cockatoo prisoners who recently etfected their ecape from Darlinghurst, was captured on Wednesday in the Kurrtjung mountainsa by the Windsor police. The other prisoner, Clarke, is still at large. We are informed that a most rigid investigation has been instituted, relative to the conduct of the gaol olficials, and that already several suspensions have been made." lTho following is from the ' Freemn's Journal:' "The contract for finishing the addition to St. Mary's Cathedral is progressing most satisfactorily. The roof is now co'.plete, the slating having been finished last week. The western gable of the old building has also been taken down with the gallery, and tihe flooring is being pushed on, so that the whole will be completed by Easter. When opened it will be the largest building in the whole colony, being considerably larger than the hall of the Uni versity. We hope the Catholics of Sydney, when they witness the results of their subscription, will at once begin anew to raise funds to still further enlarge the cathedral by removing the southern wall, and thus enable his grace to carry out his intentions with regard to thie metropolitan church of Sydney." The following is from the 'S. M. Herald:' " Miessrs. Clarke and Ghost have manufactured a very handsome cup from al emu's egg with silver mountin-s, which is to be presented by Mr. Cunning ham of the Commercial Hotel to tihe winling cricket ers at the inter-colonial match. " A carnivorous animal from Tasmania, called by 'the startling name of '" The Australian Devil," is being exhibited here prior to its being sent to Europe. It resembles a bear, but is small, being but eighteen inches in length." Monday afternoon. The following is the complete seors of the cricket match: VICTOBLA. FISFT ImSLmtS. SECOND 1H"I, 1. Brodo c.

The natives were continually burning houses and attaching stragglers. Several had been wounded, and Captain King, of the militia, had been killed. Subsequoently, in constructing a tos redoubt, the natives tired from their rifle pits and wounded eleven 'soldiers, atd billed Captain Strange, of the 65th regiment. Tihe native loss is nncertain, but is supposed to it 17.
