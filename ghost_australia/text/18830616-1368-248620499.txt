; Original Poetry. ' THE DYING BARD. ' (An Allegory.) His hours -were numbered—'twas the last, The aged bard was dying fast; Tho harp he loved lay idly by Arid caught no more his dimming, eye: A youth pas66(J elowly }>y the way And marked the sufferer as he lay, ; And profferpd aid, and asked to bring The cooling water from the spring. He murmured thanks in low reply, But pointed where the harp lay by: "Hast thou a soul for. song," he said, "Ere mortal darkness round me spread," " 'Twould cheer my heart, 'twould ease my ; pain" " To hear that blessed voice again." , With burning soul and eye of fire Thii youth took up thp fallen lyre; Boldly and well he struck the chords, But sorrow trembled in his words; —Called from the past its living ghost . And caused to pasa th' immortal host Whose eong hath kept thb spirit whole, And guards the altars of the soul: He watched,the old bard's kindling eye Aid-thought that yet he.mightnot die; But fainter tones and failing breath Showed nigher drew the step of death; And .soon in palsied cheek was shown A pilgrim to the land unknown. The old bard praise I the strains he loved, And so his wreath of bays removed; Awoke from dreams of vanished joy, And with his cbaplet crowned the boy; And calm in doath before him lay His soul on music borne away. ?
