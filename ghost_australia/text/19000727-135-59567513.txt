Hunting in the East. Among the many strange customs of savage nations, not the least curious are the ceremonious observances in connec tion with the huooting and killing of wild beasts. The boldest native hunters of Britlah India would shudder at the thought of leaving the carcase of a tiger till they had singed off its whiskers to the very roots, without which precaution they believe the ghost of the dead beast would haunt them In their graves. In many parts of Rusalsa the killing of a wolf Is not thought complete without cat ting off the head and right fore-paw. The Laps and Finns, whenever they kill a hear, surround the body with loud lamentations. One hunter then asks the dead beast, " Who killed thee ?' and answer, " A Russian," when all the rest exclaim in chorus, "A cruel deed-a bloody deed I" hoping by this means to divert the bear's resentment from them selves to the imaginary Russian. The tribes of Northern Siberia never kill a Polar bear without extracting its two largest teeth, which, In their belief, is the only safeguard against its coming to life again.
