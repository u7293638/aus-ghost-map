ITALIAN OPERA IN ADELAIDE. TO THE EDITOR. JJJXJJI •Sir—In my former letter I protested against the growing practice of substituting a pianoforte for a sufficient number of stringed instruments in Italian opera orchestras in Adelaide, and I beg you will allow me space for a final reply to " Euterpe " on this subject. I am informed that Italian operas have been produced in Adelaide until very recently with orchestras sufficient for all requirements aud without the infliction of a piano played by the conductor with the left hand while he beats time with the right, which gives an amateur aud second-rate air to tiie whole performance; and I trust, Sir, that you will use your po werful influence to prevent our lapsing back to such barbarous practices, for there is no telling to what extent the evil may grow in the hands of some cheeseparing management who might think the piano alone good enough for the people of Adelaide. " Euterpe" says that more strings in the present orchestra would destroy the harmony. I maintain on the contrary that the harmony is destroyed already by an insufficient; number of strings, and more especially by an almost inaudible bass, and think that the piano is a wretched and contemptible substitute, quite sufficient to raise the ghost of Rossini and to drive Wagner quite altogether mad. I am, Sir, &c.;, OPERA.
