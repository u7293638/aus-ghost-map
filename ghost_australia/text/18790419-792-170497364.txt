SHAMROCK ROSE, THISTLE, AND LEEE. . The Shambock.—When St. Patrick landed in Ireland to convert the Irish, 432, the pagan inhabitants were ready to stone him. He requested; to be heard, and endeavoured to explain God to them as the Trinity in nnity ; but they did not understand him until he plucked a trefoil—shamrock—from the ground, and said, "Is it not as possible for the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost to be one as for these three leaves to grow upon a single stalk 1" " Then," says Brand; " the Irish were convinced, and became converts to Christianity; and, in memory of that event, they have ever since worn the shamrock as a badge of honour." , Thk Rose.—The intestine wart whifch so long devastated England were carried on under the symbols of the Red and White Rose. The adherents of the House of Lancaster chose the red rose as their mark of distinction, while those of York chose the white. This fratricidal war continued until the union of the roses by the marriage of Henry VII. with Princess Elizabeth, daughter of Edward IV., in 1486, since which time the rose has continued to be the emblem of England* The Thistle. -—When the ' Danes invaded Scotland, on one occasion they resolved to adopt a stratagem, and, in order to prevent the Scots from detecting. them, they marched barefoot. The. Danes thonght they should reach thb cAmp in a' few minutes, when, on ft sudden, a man who went forward was wounded by a stout Scotch thistle, so that he could'not help crying out loudly with pain; This noise roused the camp, the Scots flew to arms, and the Danes were vanquished. The thistle was afterwards adopted as the insignia of Scotland. Thb Leek.—On a certain occasion King Cad wall ader met a Saxon army. In order to distinguish his men he placed • leek in eaoh of their hats ; and, having gained a decisive victory over their enemies, the leek became ever after the badge of the Welsh.
