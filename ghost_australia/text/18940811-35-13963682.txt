The entire absence of moral qualities appears to be the poor child's characteris- tic. And now it is proposed to hypnotise him into morality, to direct the current of his idio- syncracies into proper channels by means of that mysterious power which spoke through the lips of the Delphic Oracle, materialised the visions of Jeanne d'Arc, and enables the clair- voyante of to-day to roll off jargon by the ream and put it down to Tennyson. ln a word it is suggested that young Minehan should be mesmer- ised daily till he has assimilated sufficient virtue to keep him straight for the remainder of his life. It seems that growing lads who suffer fiom au obliquity of mor il vision-a sort of congenital mental tv, ist bequeathed them by their parents aro pee uliarly suscoptible to the influence of hypnotism, especially wheu it is alternated with a httlo wholesome hunger and rohoved by nn occa sion ii birching A soro back and un empty stomach will often prompt a wayward child to reflect, oven without tho aid of artificial somnam buliHin But ns tho 1 ittor alono is now much m a oguo among scie itists in tho trontment of moial diseases it might not bo amiss, perhaps, to give it a trial, we are told, aboard the Sobraon. Woll authenticated instances aro on record w bel o tho v* hole nature, not alono of n chipd, but of n grown and hardened criminal, has been changed by judiciouslj - applied suggestion And if suggestion alono is bo potent, what must it bo when backed up with dry broad and a ptout cano ° A couple of cases cited will host illustrate tho cflcc_s ol tho new treatment A boy of «avon kept tue neighbourhood m a Rtato of hijh tcn Mon Ho drank, ho swore, ho smoked, ho stole, and ho told lies with a fino facilitv before which n Katbr would hung his bead abashed Results theso accomplishments ho put wax m Ins fatliei s ¿shoes,, neodles m his mother's, skirts, and glue m his sisters* pockets Tío had a stone for ov-rv. cat und a stiel foL oven do,r over a largo extent of country Having bocu hypnotised every da\ for threo months, tho story goes, ho is now the model lad of the village, krows his t ltPihism r>,s well as the rector, and leads the villaro choir at ill tho Sunda) ecivices Tuen so it is «aid, tin io was a littlo girl of eight w ho was tho impersonation of mnh,rnit j. She was intrirtublo from tho cradle Sho d ho nwako at night till tho house wns hushed m silence, then _-t_t up and diueo on tho exposed portions or the sleeping family b holies Tho way sho be- hm ed towirds h ci hi tie was peculiarly uufeohnir fcdio d c iress the poor attendant till sho got her m tho required position md then butt her with uu naturil violente As tho famil} phvsicmn justly sud, it was tho most unpronustug caso that had como un^cr Ins notice tuting 1 long practice _et, after but ono hvpaotic tranco the moral metamor phosiR was ns «singular as it was sitisf ictory LNo doll v\ is ever subsequently pulled to pieces-the voungtst members of tho household coull sleep on tho floor nil muht wi*hcut fear of raolestation-tho bal -v a s\s«,eni wns no longer punctuated with pin holes. In the face of such evidence it would, of course, be absurd to form any a priori opinion regarding the probable effect of hyp- notism upon young Minehan. The poor boy should be subjected to it at once, and, if the experiment succeeded, a professional mesmer- ist should be employed for the Sobraon. In the Government offices and the Legislature plenty of work could be found for the new official when the training-ship boys had reached a sufficiently high standard of ethical probity to make them a blessing to the community.
