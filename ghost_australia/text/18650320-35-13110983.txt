aro to take in Wednesday tho 4th of January, 18J5 The Emperor is too adroit not to understand how wide an a^ee* mon of goodwill would thus accrue to his son among tho rising generation Hte most striking topic of the week has been tHie issuing, by the Pope, of an encyclical letter, in which his Holiness touches on eighty points, embodying neirly all the funda mental principles of modern society, all of which he con demns as opposed to the existence of the Church and the welfare of nations It would have been impossible for the most ardent and most skilful opponent of the Romish Church, to draw up a more complete and exhaustive bill of indictment against that institution, as the friend of darkness and the enemy of light, than is the singular document to which the Pope has put his sngnnture, and which his ex cited the amazement and indignation of every fraction of tho Liberal party in Europe Even tho avowedly Ultramontane journals evidently do not know what to say about It The official organ of the Roman Government is the only paper which, as yet, has ventured to proiso this solemn re-assertion of all the bigotted, intolerant, and tyrannical claims ever put forth by the Popes from the dark ages to our own time, and which modern Catholics. have been trying so anxiously to persuade the world were no part of tho essential Catholic j doctrine, but temporary errors due to individual aberration, ' and the ignorance and violence of society in the past Even the Monde of this city, tho most thorough-going partisan of Papal infallibility, and who ventured two years ago, a few timed feelers on the expediency of re- establishing the Inquisition, has taken refuge in a short paragraph remarking that, as the document is the utterance of an infallible authority, the letter is to be " accepted, not discussed," and winding up with a burst of enthusiastic " admiration and thankfulness ' in view of " this attitude of the sublime old man," who, amidst trouble and danger, can thus testify his unbounded love for souls, and his boundless confidence in the protection of tho Church by Heaven As the eighty points which tho Pope condemns as " deadly and damnable," include the institution of civii marriage, the enfranchisement of civil lawsuits from clerical jurisdiction, the right of each man to judge of religious truth according to his conscience, and tho duty of the civil authority to protect him in worshipping^ according to his conscience, tho independence of sovereigns in temporal affairs, the idea that any human creature can be saved eternally out of tho pale of tho Church, the notion that science and philosophy can go counter to the teaching of tho Church,-and so on, taking in, as before remarked, all the fundamental axioms on which European life is now based, and nearly all of which are accepted as fully and freely by the majority of Catholics as by Protestants As these eighty points, in fact, are severally and jointly declared by the Pope to be absolutely incompatible with tho salvation of souls, as well as destructive of human society, it is hard to see, in so comprehensive a piece of cursing, any very conclusive evidence of the " infinite love " on which the Monde expatiates so complacently The French, Italian, and German Press are commenting on this astoundingly ill- judged publication in very much. the same terms as their English brethren Tho French Bishops are in dismay, and it is even rumoured that a por- tion of them ire anxious to issue a declaration expressing their dissent from certain of its propositions M Drouyn ¿e Lhuys is also busy, it is Baid, drawing up a reply to certain other parts of the document, under the eye of his Imperial master It is rumoured, moreover, that the Emperor of Russia, on learning the scope of the encyclical letter, instantiv despatched a telegraphic message to tho Tuileries, assuring tho Emperor Napoleon that no might Count on his full and entire adhesion to any and ovory ?measure which he might take as a reply to tho 80 points One of these points being the re assertion of the right of peoples to withdraw their allegianco from scmsmatic princes, which assertion, though it would apply to, England, Prussia, and all the other Protestant States, hypotheticall) to Louis Napoleon, who has helped to separate the greater part of its late dominions from the see of Rome, and more directly to Victor Emmanuel, is yet probably levelled moro directly «gainst Russia as tho "persecutor" of tho Catholic hierarchy in Poland, has probably not exerted any vorv dulcifying influence on the feeling of the Czar in regard to the 79 other obinrgatory paragraphs Though the Emperor Napoleon, tied by the backwardness of the public sentiment of 60 large a portion of the French people on the "subject of the blending of the temporal and spiritual powers in the same hands, as regards Rome, (for it would bo difficult to find a score of Frenchmen oven among the Ultramontane party, who would admit that such a union would be desirable for Franco), will pro- bably cause the forthcoming manifesto of his Mimstcr of .Foreign Affairs to be drawn up in terms of filial deprecation nnd affectionate devotion, he must feel that the Pope has really play ed into his hands m the very way most certain to help hnn Tor, after such a declaration of the utter irre- concilability of the Church
