Rustic Courting. By the way, talking of names, how very characteristic of the rustic sweetheart many are—"lad's love," "none, so pretty," call me-to-you," " jump-up-and-kiss-me," " kiss- me-twice," " cuddle- me-to-you." Here is the language of flowers straight from unsophisticated nature—and what a posy to give to a sweetheart! It would save the bashful tongue-tied rustic much painful composition, and relieve him from a great many perplexing propositions. Courting couples walk out on the heath on Sundays, and it is very curious to watch them. So far as I can make out they, do not talk to each other at all, nor do they seem to derive any enjoyment from the scenery about them. Whenever they pass a bush they pull leaves off, and tear them up abstractedly as they go along. They are generally looking in opposite directions. If they meet another couple—village neighbours all the week— their demeanour is even more ludicrously constrained. The girls look at each other's frocks and hats. The lads ask the most commonplace questions in the most sheepish way imaginable. Then, how awkwardly they part! And what a relief the parting is! Each couple has now at least one remark to make. There is an affectation of breaking up. It almost seems as if conver- sation is to ensue. But self-consciousness again supervenes, and on they go as silent and depressed as ghosts on the banks of the Styx. Yet I suppose they are supremely happy for "your lover is always melan- choly." All the same I feel inclined to knock their heads together, or joy them.— Contemporary Review.
