The Melbourne Cricket Ground caretaker had provided a splendid wicket, and the day I was a perfect one, being fine and cool. There was a record attendance. The toss was anxiously watched, and there was great oy and satisfaction in the Australian camp when it is was known that Giffen had won. The Ans f fealians therefore decided to bat and \- -alike the most of the favourable circum -,- stances. Bruce, the brilliant left, and H. Trott were the first to face the bowling of is Richardson and Peel', which had the effect of keeping down the scoring for some time, both of batsmen playing cautiously. Eventually Mr Bruce opened out, and was cutting and driving in his well known brilliant style when he put one up from Peel in the slips, which * was smartly held by McLaren. Trott in the meantime had given a chance, sp when he made 19. Geo. Giffen joined Trott, and the score mounted slowly but surely, both '" ' "playing the game." OoaasionaUy Trott \- would bit out to a loose one, and would be s cheered for a boundary hit. The score had reached the century when the cunning ' Lancashire man, Briggs, beat Trott, who is ; fired for a well played 42, which took him an hour and 20 minutes to complete. a 'Iredale joined Giffen, and he appeared well set when a fast one from Richard Y ion scattered his timbers 3-8-126. , Giffen, who was then associated with > Gregory, was playing nicely when Peel beat him, and he retired for a well -y played 57. He never gave the ghost of a X chance and was two hours and a quarter w at the wickets. With four good wickets down I tot ISO things were only moderate for the j J Australians, but the next partnership, between Gregory and Darling, put a different complexion on the game. Both men played steadily, and gave no chances. The score is slowly mounted to 282 when stumps were drawn for the day, both batsmen being in the r Mventiss.
