FARMEBS AND SEESD WHEAT. TO THB TTOETOB. Sir — Mr. Jenkin Coles profeBBes to be astonithed that the present Government have not granted assistance to the farmers in the thape of a loan of -seed wheat. In the dis tricts requiring seed wheat it is usual to sow in February or March, and no Bane man would think of Bowing in the middle of July. I once finished eowmg in June,' -and although the crop avenged 10 bushels the part sown in Jane was not worth reaping, and a similar result would follow this season with land sown in July. I may say that owing to crops failing three years in succession, and beine hunted in a bailiff like manner by (he late Commissioner of Grown Lands, this season I have not sown a grain ; yet with 200 acres of fallow, should the present Government offer me the loan of the seedj I would not accept it, as it would be a waste to put it in the ground. This Mr, Coles well knows, but it suits him to appear to thick otherwise. Speaking in the no con fidence debate the hon. (gentleman stated that ia no case had he treated selectors harshly ; yet -strange t3 say the name of Colea is thoroughly deteeted in the northern areas, and I trust the time will never again arrive which will place -the power of eviction in -the hands of one eo cruel and hard-hearted, I noticed the hon, gentleman, wiabiag to appaai funny, quoted poetry at the expense of Mr. Burgoyne. .Allow me to offer him another translation of tre same lineB — Here lies poor Jenkin, yes, here he lies Selectors laugh, but nobody cries. Where he's gone, or how he Tare?, Kobody knows, ana nobody oares. But in the future there are two coala. Beware ! Jenkin, beware ! At one they burn Goals. —I am, &c-;, JENKHFS GHOST.
