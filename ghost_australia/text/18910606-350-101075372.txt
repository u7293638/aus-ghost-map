The ghost of Federation was then put upon the stagej and so entertaining has this novelty been as to hang like a cloud upon the country and , by .its egregious r folly and impudence engage tlio attention of men whose energies might have been otherwise usefully directed.

'' Tlie public riieeting held by Aid. Litton ?on Saturday eyening, last was peculiarly interestingin ? many ways, but:- why {pro fessional pugilists should be employed to keep a Penrith audience in order is a matter that' requires some explanation. . Aid. Litton boasts, of being...a thorough, .democrat,' and we believe, as imost. sensible people of the present day.fhe favours our mode: ofrelection, viz., vote by ballot. Why then should he wish people who have ^ie right" at'all times to vote by ballot to'-say openly-at a public meeting/whether he was still fit to hold the position .of an' alderman. - If -he wished to test the-feelirigs of the ratepayers^he should have resigned and gone up . again for re election. Of course..^ some .- persons; .-.may argue ;that he would be liable to'a penalty of £2$ for so-'doing-by the- Act,--but Aid. Litton' should' know; if the ? ratepayers as- a. b'odydo not; that he is in no way liable, not residing within the municipality. Then again, the result of . the meeting-can in no way be'taken as; the opinion1 of the' people; format the;last-election, 311 yotes could-haye. been polled, butr out of that number 212 were recorded, Mr.'Litton?/receiving1--1x7 of that number.,,,.On Saturday night, not more than 20 per'soris .voted, and of that number one gentleman favorable to Mr; Litton and who held ,up liis;;hand in favor .was[ not allowed to vote: at-last election as.-he- had parted with his interest. The Mayor also had no right to .show himself such a partisan as he.did on Saturday night, and it was? the'fact of his being-in. the chair that caused all:the/trouble, for Mr. R. W. Rei'd. Mr. Litton >vent a lorig way out- of. his way in ?criticising the', action of'the Nepean1 Times, but'Sve- h'ave not time nor space in this issue to reply to;, these as it will.? take ? some' time to search the matter'out. We believe ,y\ye have the cbr^fc fidence of the''residents^of>the district in which we have resided, for nearly 40 years and we also' believe A.ld.*: Litton. has' not .the confidence of the ratepayers of South Ward, and if he. thinks he has:let him. resign and test the matter at the ballot box.
