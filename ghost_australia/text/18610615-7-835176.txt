REEDBEDS CAVALRY. Mr. MAGAREY, pursuant to notice, asked the hon, the Treasurer, Mr. Reynolds, when the Government sent for rifles for the Reedbeds Cavalry, and when they may be expected to arrive? He asked this question because this force had now been organised more than 18 months, and the weapons which they had were of the most unserviceable description, in fact even dangerous. The consequence was that the men could not practice or have an opportunity of competing for the prizes in the forthcoming marches. They were at a complete disadvantage, and if the Government would not give them proper weapons they would have disband. The- TREASURER replied - "By the September (ison) mail, the Governor-in-Chief addressed the Home Government on the subject of the grim old' anus prayed for in address of House of Assembly to Her Majesty, requesting that, if the address were complied with, '400 rifled carbine? for the cavalry volun- steers, and for sergeants of companies might be included. By June mail the Agent-General was apprised of what had been done, and was requested to ascertain, at earliest date, whether the grant would be conceded, and, in event, of its refusal, to forthwith purchase lee of the weapons named, with requisite ammunition, and despatch them to the colony. Under date the 15th January, the Agent-General reported that the grant had been declared, and that he had been in communication with the War Office as to the best de.scripü of carbine, with a view to giving the order. Copy of correspondence was sent. A letter was written in reply by March mail, as it appeared somewhat uncertain whether he would make the purchase without again hearing from this Government." JETTY AT LACEPEDE BAY. Mr. A. BLYTH, pursuant to notice, moved - "That this House will, on Friday, 21st June, resolve itself into a Committee of the whole, for the purpose of consider- ing the motion-' That an Address be presented to His Excellency the Governor-in-Chief, praying His Excellency to cause to be placed on the Estimates the sum of houses. for the purpose of defraying the cost of erection of a jetty at Lacepede Bay. " He need not, he imagined, trouble the House with many remarks in support of the justice of this application. It was, of course, the interest of the province to assist as much as possible in the advancement of all the outports, and especially to retain all the import and export trade belonging to the colony. (Hear, hear.) There had been frequent complaints made to the effect that large quantities of produce was brought over the borders to the settlers in this province, and in this way of course the revenue was made to suffer-, He thought that every movement which might tend to keep . ° . .... 7s ... s... s i s. itw, .ittllllll.^lV settlers iii that locality had contributed IIIIKVIJ ." ..?". revenue, and but little had been spent in public improvements there. They had already petitioned the house during the past session for a jetty, and this would cost 6000., and he thought it should be granted. 1 lure was now a vessel regularly plying between Port Adelaide and Lacepede Bay (the Swallow and she went once a fortnight, and he was informed that she had on board goods from Mosquito Plains This was one of the best harbors along the coast, and it this expenditure was maintained, the trade would be kept more within the province than it was at present. (Hear.) The last time he had come from Melbourne, the captain of Ula steamer had informed him that this was the only safe I my- along the coast, and this was a gentlemen totally unin- terested in any way. He had presented a petition last year which contained important statements. (The hon. member here quoted from the petition.) If other reasons were races sary to be adlueeJ he might state that the steamer Ant made this harbor that to which she ran in stress of weather, or when night came on and darkness prevented her from reaching her have Hit settlers had claims upon the Government and were content if this sum was voted Ila trusted the House would consent to go into Committee (Hear hear ) Mr M YG YRI i seconded the motion the COMMISSION!
