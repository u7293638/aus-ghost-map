SNOBOCRACY IN BUNBURY. To the Editor of The Herald. Sir. — Can you tell me why that half-crown line was drawn on Friday last in connection with the opening ceremony in Bunbury ? It was of- fensive to ninety per cent of the people. This was unfortunately too plain in the case of the Premier's reception as the train came in — not a ghost of a cheer when he raised Ins hat to the people, who would other- wise have given him an ovation, but that their enthusiasm was damped and their feelings hurt by the im- pudently arranged line of demarcation drawn by the promoters. It ap- preciably affected the banquet, too, as the paucity of local people was traceable to the half-crown indignity. Yours, etc., RAG TAG.
