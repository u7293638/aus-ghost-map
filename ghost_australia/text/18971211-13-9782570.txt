A DICTIONARY OF AUSTRAL ENGLISH.' The ordinary man probably imagines that the inn! mg of a mere dictionary is a matter calling for no particular literary value be youd laborious application Just you get together all the words, and then you explain them Just that, and nothing more in the same way the code i bleu need only get together the ingredients of a dish, and then cook it It is perfectly simple ple vided von make sure of all the materials in precisely the right quantity and of pre called the right quality, mix them in precisely the right way apply precisely the right amount of heat for precisely the the length of time, and so forth Similarly the dictionary maker need only be sure that he has found exactly all the words, and omitted none, that he is defining them in such a way as to tell the truth, the whole of bills, and nothing but the truth about then including, that lim scientific, technical, and other statements are unimpeachable, that his pronunciations are properly authenticated that his mythologies are' sound according to the lawn of phonetics, psychology and common sense and that he is expressing himself so lucidly as to be unmistakable and HO tersely that his book may be reasonable in bulk and cowl There is room for more and ICES veracity AMicn the lady asked Johnson how he came to define 'pattern" as The 1 nee of a house,' he answered simply, 'Ignorance, madam, pure ignorance " Of Liddell and Scott's famous Greek Lexicon, the epigram begins - There in a book by I Iel fell mil Scott borne out of a true and some of it a not. There is room, again, for more and less acumen of definition isle the man in the street to define "bore," and he may think himself happy if he can evolve to weary by tedious conversation " But then comes along the new Murray, and adds the neat qualification, "or simply by failure to be interesting" 'The one definition looks quite satisfactory till you get the other V street may perhaps be defined as a road in a town between houses, until someone points out that there need be houses only on one side There is room for more and less defines of expression There is room for the avoidance of fads, idle guesses, and obiter dicta concerning derivation There is, or used to be, room even for a stroke of humour When Johnson defines "Mexico grapher" as a writer of dictionaries, a lmmiless dodge," the latter expression is a piece of gum sarcasm at the popular ignorance of the matter Also, does not every Scotchman know how he defined "oats"' there is, in fact, room for almost all the literary virtues, except imagination imagination has no place in a dictionary, except under the letter Some at least, of this preface may be required to account for the fact that a writer possessed of so vivacious a pen as that of Professor Morris should have devoted himself to the labour of producing a dictionary As a man of letters and a specialist scholar in English, Professor Morris could not but realise that a complete record of Australasian English was imperatively demanded The student of render of the English language in Great Britain of America needs to be told the meaning of many strange terms which are purely Asli allan, and also to be warned of the very different application given in Australasia to terms with which he is familiar in other senses Apart from the fact that over four millions of people speak "Austral English," there is the agreeable fact that Austral literature, from poem and novel down to magazine short story, is advancing greatly in vogue in the Northern Hemisphere On the other side, the student of English in Australasia equally needs to be told the meaning of many words he heard for the first time, to learn the origin of many which he uses freely himself, and to be warned of the peculiar scribes and nuances in which he employs terms otherwise applied and apprehended in the standard tongue A. lexicon which should seize upon the linguistic phenomena up to date, will give a treat worthy account of them, was evidently a vi oth demanded on both sides of the globe His requirement was obvious, but to pay ceive it was one thing, to undertake to meet it was quite another The sheer labour involved in the search for materials and testimony, particularly in the shape of evidential quotation, is somewhat appalling, and only rendered tolerable by enthusiasm for a cause and the elia nee of occasionally making a 'kind' Mcteovu, lexicographical work of local character is apt to prove Bpc emily ung useful It lends itself to the consciousness of the captious critic, who plead venture finds that his pet preposterous etc apology is ignored or tenth pooh poohed, or, mayhap, bring under the delusion that an expression is a colonial pin

Australasian is even more onerous than that of compiling a die beauty of English in general in the last case the words have nearly all been hated and explained and denied in previous Next comes the

to see how the work could have been done better, and, if it is any return to Professor Morris to feel that his labour has resulted in a pronounced success, he is assuredly on titled to that feeling He has performed an extremely useful service, and performed it brilliantly well What is "Austral English"' The dictionary is no dictionary of slang Auutnl Fug fish is not slang but a language There is a certain, though exceedingly small, amount of positive slang peculiar to Australia, and Professor Morris possessed too much good sense to omit that clement from his work for one thing every philologist
