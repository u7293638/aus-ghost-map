The letter was undated and unsigned, but it -w;as^_evidently; jp .the , jsoantfiss's -OBn; writing. A few days later fy$ earl re moved to his new home. He started his modest establishment with two ^men. aad oneuiaa servant. &. gax dener was1 engaged to come once a week to attend'to the lawn sad flowers. When ike earl had paid his hotel bill and a few o&er; expenses; lie jfound *hat apwards of two tbir&B; of lus kundised aad fifty ^pbttads had. gone already;, while more_than two months, of the quarter had yet tp rvm..' Bufethifl did not trouble him. He palcpiated, and rightly, that when once . he; Wad. est&blifcEed; in Laurel Gotfage- he might go on credit for ^ everything he Tfranted±0r several ^abnths to: come. . As .»? matter of fact he was. inun- . dated with offers fipm l^despeople 6f all kinds', so that his on|y difllcnitjr lajr in choosing which of tiiemieshauld patronise, Evgn horses and carriages were pressed pn him, but he decided that for the present? both stable and coach-house should remain empty; - Ho might perhaps have afforded to buy a cheap cob 4£ an opportunity foy doing bo had offered itself ; howevert there would fife time enough to think afcoui such luxu ries by-and-by. Putiniiis matter, as in most others, he was probably actuated by some motive other than appeared on the surface. Joong before the earl had got quietly settled down one carriage after another came flashing up to the little green gate of Laurel Cottage. tTis lordship was at home to everybody that called. Everybody was charmed with his a&bility; and the simple kindliness of his demeanour. 'What delightful manners]1 exclaimed the ladies with one accord. 4 What ease and polished courtesy ! A thorough man of the world, evidently.' Could these fair damei have seen his lordship six weeks previously as he sat behind a long pipe in the coffiee-rppm of the lB.B.,' with his 'brandy-and- water in front of him, what would their thoughts of him have been? Calls, as a matter of course, were wac ceeded by pressing invitations to dinn&r.; But. the earl frankly pleaded his poverty, is fact he almost made a parade of ib before his -newly found 'friends. *Tou say that you live three miles artay. . Pray tell me how I am to reach you when T have neither a hqpf nor a wheel on the premises?' Then of course came offers to send the brougham or other conveyance for him, which equally, as a:Hjafcfcer of course, inycived the Bending of Tijtt» home when the evening: was at an end. For the earl had made up his mind that if people wanted him they must both eend for him and send him back, and before long- this necessity came to be accepted as a Well-understood fact among those whom he honoured with his company. The vicar of the parish was one of the firat to caU at Laurel Cottage. Before leaving he expressed a hope that he should occasion ally see his lordship at church, and his lord ship was good enough to promise that next Sunday morning should find him ill the vicar's pew. It was quite a novel, sensation for the earl to find himself inside a place of worship. The vicar's wife handed him an elegantly-bound large-print prayer-book, which he accepted with, % smile, &ua; & little, bow ; but when he tried to follow the service and find the different places, he got 'tetri bly fogged,' as he afterwards expressed it, and as he wae afraid to let the. people see the dilemma he. was in, h& shut the prayer book up altogether by and by, and tried to put oh the air of a man who was so' thoroughly familiar with the service thi&' the book was rather aaenoumbrance to him than otherwise. 'The places iigedjo be easy enough to find when I was a lad,' he muttered to himself; -but I suppose the Bubric has been . altered since then, and evidently altered for the tftwse,' - He had be,qn rather duTpjoua On his azxzral at Brimley whether some of ;^e rery Tug people of the neighborhood xoighi not .still bear in mind ^o me q| the escapades of his. early VearSj fepid decline %q acknowledge him ; t-ut iiffi uneaemeaa on this score was quickly ,dispelied.

Clem had nailed down a square of' green baize on one part gf $he ?floor, and had hired a couple of chairs and a few 'properties' from Wardour-street. Miss Browne walked across the floor in her slow, stately way, and seated herself on one of the chairs. 'To her 'uie studio was nothing but a dingy, commonplace Toom.

'' .,._,. ? She looked at Tory's picture first. After contemplating it in mlence for a little while, she said softly, and more as if talking to hereeH thap. to Clem, * I £bink that I should like to know Mr, Macer.' Then she. passed, on to Qlejoi's,. picture. But she. had sot looked at it more than half a minute before she discovered that one of_ the two faces depicted in it-was an exact repfoduption of her own*; Sly. Master Clem ' had ' painted her portrait from memory and had stuck it into his pioutre. The warm color mounted to Cecelia's faee, her eyes dropped, and she turned away without a word. , Clem readjusted the coverings, and when he- turned Cecelia1, was sitting in the chair next to Miss Browne's apparently im mejesed infthe pages ^EPtwoH. Olem got his. colorp, brushes, and palette with the view of immeiliately setting to Tlrork. He had already planted his easel on tne spot where he intended it to stand.
