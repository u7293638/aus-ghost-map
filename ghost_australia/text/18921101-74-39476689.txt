THE S.S. HIIMALAYA. In a little more than another month we will have one of the magnificent new liners of the P. and 0. Company in Port Jackson (says the Ausbralian Star), and if the fleet of four steam ships of the Britannia typo which were specially built to commemorate the jubilee of the senior steam- shipping company of the world created a sensation on their arrival, what may fairly be expected of the latest and proudest additions to the fleet which take rank among tka warships of the world ? The " special" of the Pall Mall Budget had a fair opportunity of comparing the Himalaya, the sister ship to the Australla, so soon to arrive in Australian waters, with the premier steamships of the world, and they are only to be found to the pitch of perfectionon the great Atlantic ferry.

In the morning the steamship was under way. and on passing Ramsgato the trumpeter wound out a cheerful invitation to breakfast in the lofty saloon, where some hundreds may feast like one, and with luxurionu comfort-a fine apartment, seggesting the table d'hotel hall in some foreign hotel, the iron beams and girders being disguised in elegant mouldings and reliefs, from the designs of an accomplishod â€¢architeot then on hoard.
