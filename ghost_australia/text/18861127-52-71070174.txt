I have serious doubts as tó^whéther any of tho Americans,'except Ten Erek was íreallytin' eáraost.' Tho lagt named, who competed in the1 .final,' is about.the most ungainly sculler I ba vc over seen ; and.onihia'meritß ho has not ¿the ghost.: of a ohaueö with ?Teemer or Ross. ...... ,1-, : ... ¡.A . c ? V¡"-r j Biuco tho regatta the air is full of challenges, and the ¡back pago of thu london SPORTSMAN hos been for tho last .few! days' quito a curiosity.'^Everyone seems to wish to bavé a go at Mattersonj and Haulan' and" Bubear offor to rows bim for £500 la'sido; whilo Teemer ÍB contented to go fori tho more modest sum of £200 a side., Ten Eyck thu lenirea JPerkina for £200 a sido and tho English champion ship^ but'Perkins is hot disposed to accommodate him. OUI Davo Godwin wantB a start of 15sec over tho cham pionship course from Teemer, but'tho: latt.er will only accord lôsec at tho finish. Not to bo outdone by tho younger school, Harry Kelley, aged 51 (the o;d chap doesn't look 41), is anxious *to tickle any man his own ago for £100 or £200 a aide. ' Hanlañ has challenged ROES buttha wily Wallace says "ho's a bit off color," and won't row just now. Tho Canadian, faute dc mieux, i» now willing to .row Teemer; and perhaps, after all, this lnnylet-.d to business). Wo aro noxt to have a double-seul ling regatta promoted by tho irrepressible "Pegasus," and wo are also promised a fburöiu-ea race between Hanlan, Teemer, Ten Eyck and Hamm, and Ross, Loe, Bubear, and Perkins; so ttiat altogether we ahall have bu&y; times on tho Thames thia autumn. j ! Arnon« the latest oonverts to tho new religion of " Beach worship" is Harry Kelley, who for a long limo " wouldn't stand him at any price." Now, howover, after witnessing accomplished facta, tho veteran agrees that ho is tho greatest sculler tho world has aeon. Speaking of tho now famouB Gaudaur match, Harry, who "showed up" tho i Canadian, told m.ebe never paw aitch an exhibition of pluck in bia lifo aa Beach's on that occasion. Ho of course was in,á. much bottqr position than au.vopo oleo to seo what transpired, and ho Say sthAt Boach turnoi grech-ho was so Í bad-and that when -lié stopped tbo Bo'condtlmc he vomited, which seemed to relievo him and enable him togo on again. ; This wa« new information to mo j and I behove it. Harry Hutchens, tbo colobratod pedestrian, sailed in tho Lusitania for Sidney, to run a serios of matches with Majppe, Hf! is prQtmbjy the moat brilliant sprinter in tho world, and Malone will have his work eut but to beat him.
