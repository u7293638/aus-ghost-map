A Prize Story. IT ENTITLES ITS TELLER TO BE CALLED CHIEF LIAR. ' ? It is related that Mr. Sam M'Curdy, of Louis ville, Ky., was sitting 'neath tho shade of a tree talking to Borne friends, when his atten tion was called to a hen with a brood of young chickens and a large rat that had just omerged from its hole and was quietly re garding the young ohiokens with ths prospect, of a meal in viow. As the rat camo. from the liolo tho houso-cat caught sight of' it. At tho appearanco of its anoient cnomy, tho cat, a Scotch terrier, quietly made for tho place where the rat stood. At this moment a boy named Andy Quaid came upon tho sceno. The chickens were not cognizant of being watched by tho rat, nor did the rat seo tho cat, nor tho feline the dog, who had not - noticed tho coming of tho boy. A littlo ohiclc wandered too nigh and ho was seized by the rat, whioh was in turn pounced upon by tho cat, and the cat was caught in the mouth of the dog. The rat would not cease his hold on the chicken, and the cat, in spito ot the shaking she was getting from the dog, did not let go the rat. It seemed to the boy that the rat was about to escape after a time, and getting a stone he hurled it at the ofllony . The stone struck tho dog right between tho eyes. The terrier released his grip on the cat and fell over dead. It had breathed its last before the cat in turn let go the rat and turned over and died. . The rat did not long survive the onomy, and by the side of the already dead chicken ho laid himself down and gavo up tho ghost. Tho owner of the dog wos so angry at his death that he is said to have come near mak ing the story complete by killing the boy that . killed the dog that-shook the cat that oaught tho rat that bit the chicken in the yard on Clay Street. â€” Louisville Courier Journal.
