"V.R.C. AUTUMN MEETING. Melbourne, March 12. [By Telegraph.] [From our own Reporter.] The third day of the autumn meeting was very close and sultry, still the attendance was fairly good considering the number of people drawn away by the cricket match. Sylvanns was the public fancy for the Nursery Handicap, but ne was never able to set up to the light weightSj Colstoun and Vaucluse, the first of the pair giving backers a foretaste of the trouble in store for them. Then came the Newmarket Handicap, and owing to the short time allowed between it and th last i_ace trainers had great difficulty In getting their horses weighed out in time. In the ring Hyacinth was heavily backed at the last moment by the owner, bat the confidence reposed in Hesperian, Ghost, and Larpent was not weakened. The Ghost was terribly fractious at the post, as wasTvropean, and they both got off very badly. The race, as usual, was most exciting. Totalizator, who was not fancied in consequence of having done badly since arriving in Melbourne, was leading fifty yards from home, bnt when Hyacinth tackled him he gave way, and Mr. Pearson's horse won a grand race from Euclid and Laipent, the latter of which made his run just too late td be of service. Surrey showed speed, but could not stay. Hesperian could never quite get up. Ghost and "Verdure were not dangerous at any part of the race. Mr. Pearson wins over £4,000 on the race, and a lot of books laid the winner, bnt he was not a good horse for the public. The Town Plate produced a fine field of horses, and the result was another instance of how unlucky are the favourites from Lang's stable. A declaration was made in favour of Pell Mell, but he neyer got near the front, and Commotion won a fine race from Wellington and Progress. The time was remarkably fast, but as the gong did not Bound in this race until the horses bad gone 200 yards it was probably incorrect. When the horses returned to weigh Commotion was very coldly received, but Wellington was loudly cheered on Mr. Baldock announcing that it was his last race. Mr. A. K. Finlay has bought him for £L000 for stud purposes, and he also pays Mr. Baldock £100 a year as long as the horse lives. Solitude was made a great pot for the All-Aged, but she seemed unable to gallop, and Allander won easily, to the great delight of the bookmakers. The Steeplechase . was a very fine race, the nine competitors flying their fences beautifully, there being only one mistake made throughout the race. Great Western was thought a moral by Mr. Loughlin's party for the Steeplechase, but he was beaten Dy Twilight, who made tne pace so merry that she had the big horse dead beaten a mile from home. Lucy ran a great race, and Chrysalis would have done better had Batty not kept her so far behind in the early part of the race. Roebuck ran very badly, being last all the way, and pulling np terribly distressed. Duchess was backed for pounds, shillings, and pence in the last race, and the way she ran away from her field when Hales let her go shows that the stable had good grounds for fancying her in the last Melbourne Cup. The following is a description of the racing:— SECOND NURSERY HANDICAP. A sweepstakes of S sovs. each, h. ft. with 150 added. For two-year- olds. Seven furlongs. Mr. A. K. Finlay's b.c.

Some time was wasted at the post before Mr. Watson could get the cavalcade in a line, but when the flag did go down the lot seemed to get away in fair order. As far as could be seen Surrey was the fastest in the early part of the race, and Baron von Mueller and Hesperian also looked well in the centre of the course for half a mile, when Totalizator came to the front, and he led till within 50 yards from home, when Hyacinth headed him. Larpent on the Stand side and Enclid in the centre now made a fine run, and Hyacinth, Euclid, Larpent-, and Totalizator passed the Judge's box almost in line, with Hesperian and Cremorne very close up. Hyacinth won by a clear neck, but the Judge was some time in deciding whether Euclid or Laipent was second. Totalizator was only a head behind Larpent, and then came Hesperian and Cremorne, closely followed by a batch of about a dozen. Time, 1 min. 16£ sec. TOWN PLATE. A sweepstakes of 10 sovs. each, h.ft., withGOO added. For three-year-olds and upwards. Weight for age.

Pell Mell, with whom Mr. Phillips declared to win; 4 to 1 Progress and Wellington ; 6 to 1 Darebin and Sweet William. When the flag fell Commotion made play, with Progress second and Santa Claus third, and they passed the Stand in this order. The leader increased bis advantage to ei^ht lengths rounding the bend, and Progress, Darebm, and Pell Mell went on nest, Salisbury acting as whipper- in. At the sheds Pell Mell, Darebin, Progress, and Wellington got on close terms, but as they came to the turn the favourite was beaten, and Commotion drew away again. Coming to the straight Progress, Wellington, ;and Darebin made their effort, but none of them could get on terms with Commotion, who held his own and wo easily by two "lengths. A grand race for second place between Wellington and Progress ended in favour of the old horse by half a length, and then came Darebin and Bathurst. Time, 3 min. -34 sec. ALL-AGED STAKES. A sweepstakes of 5 sovs. each, 3 ft, with 103 added. For two-year-olds and upwards. Weight for age. One mile. Sir. J. Morrison ns. ch.c. Allander, by King of the Ring—Lady Manners Sutton, 2 yrs.

Betting—3 to 1 against Solitude; 5 to 1 agst. the others. Mistaken made play for 200 yards, when Solitude and Allander drew level, and the three ran stride for stride to the turn. Here Mistaken was beaten, and coming into the straight Solitude was in trouble. Hales rode her hard to the finish, but she never had a show with Allander, who won easily by two lengths. Mistaken was a good third. Time, 1 min. 4C4 sec. STEEPLECHASE. A handicap sweepstake of 10 sovs. each, h. ft., with 300 added. The second horse to receive 50 sovs., and the third 25 sovs. out of the stake. About three miles, over such course and jumps as the Stewards shall direct. e Mr. S. Justin ns. br.m. Twilight, by Panic— Midnight, asied, 11 st. (Scobie) .. .. .. 1 Mr. F. C. Goyder's br.m. Crysolis, aged, 9 st. 7 lb. (Batty) 2 Mr. P. Glenister's bl.m. Lucy, aged, 10 st. 12 lb. (Mclnnes) ..' 3 Messrs. Robertson & Wagner's b.g. GreatWestern, aged, 11 st 3 lb. (Corrigan). Mr. G. Glasscock's b.g. Skylark, 5 yrs., 0 st. (Kilduff). Mr. M. Moian's br.m. Gazelle, aged. 9 st 10 lb.

Betting—6 to 4 agst. Great {Western, 4 to 1 Chiysolis and Lucy, 6 to 1 the others. Great Western and Skylark showed the way to the first fence, over which they were followed by Twilight, Lucy, Gazelle, Hieroglyph, Chrysolis, Sissy, and Boebuck, in the order named. Skylark then cleared out and led over the double, with Great Western and Twilight next and the others in the order given above. No change took place until coming to the six fences parallel with the straight, when Twilight supplanted Skylark, and acted as pioneer from Great Western, Lacy, and Skylark, with the others following in Indian file, and all fencing grandly. After the jump following these fences, Twilight stretched out with a commanding lead, and made for the river fence at a cracking pace, with Great Western, Lucy, Gazelle, and Skylark as her nearest attendants, Chrysolis at this time deserting the company of Boebuck, Hieroglyph, and Sissy, and setting sail in pursuit of the leaders. At the double, Gazelle, who was running second, came down, and left Great Western and Lucy to follow Twilight to the sheds, but it was evident now that the favourite was taring, as he was rapping each successive fence. Two fences from home Chrysolis got on terms with Lucy and Great Western, and she jumped the last fence some six lengths in the rear of Twilight; but when they landed the last named drew away with the race in hand, though Scobie pulled up at the finish and allowed Chrysolis toget within two lengths. Lucy was third. Great Western fourth, Skylark fifth, Hieroglyph sixth, qjl close up. Some little distanoe off came Sissy with Boebuck, who was dead beaten at a mile and a half, ttime, 6 min. 52 sec.
