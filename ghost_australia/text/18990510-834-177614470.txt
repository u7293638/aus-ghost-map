FEDERATION. QUEENSLAND'S POSITION. COMES OUT TOP. (TO ?niK.KIIITOR I). II.-(SA/.K'ITB.) Sik, — In ihe 'Chronicle' of this morn ing there is a most remarkable article re the great question of I-'edcralion. [It tells us what w.is the price of maize, Kc, 30 years ago, though whal thai has lo do with the present uu'ter I can't fathom.] Hut it is its figures which astonish one, for it gives statistics to show to ihe farmers and others that we must not have i-'edcralion, and yet upon Iheslightest examination those very figures prove the splen did position held by Queensland, and show lhat both in exporting and producing, which you will see we, (with our h.ind'ul of people), could control the market. Let the figures speak — Victoria can export to the extent of /14 per head of population : N. S. Wales can export £ 18 per head 1$ population ; Queensland can export £l-) per head of population. Victoria produces average of 6 bushels wheat to acre ; N.S. Wales 10 bumels wheat to acre ; Queensland 17 bushels to acre. Fancy, sir, ' Queensland producing on each acre nearly three limes as much as Victoria can.' Why, sir, the Queensland farmer might as well dread a famine when it rained manna. Add to this power to produce, the 'great territory we hold,' which would enable a larger population to send up the amount for exportation by leaps and bound1:, - and make 'free and open ports the very thing for bountiful Queensland.' Oh, sir ! these bogies with which some try to frighten us out of our wits ,are— What ! Just rags and sawdust ! Just rags and sawdust, if you only pinch them ! and farmers, of all men, are not-frightened by ghosts. The Prophet seeking to ' curse ' Federation has benignly blest it !. Yours, &c;, J. IIervev.
