TALES AND SKETCHES. TAH Rights Keserved.] M4RY fiLWYK'S SECRET. By ALAJf ST. AUBVX, (Author of 'A Fellow- of Trinity,' 4c.) (Concluded.) Rut II.— Chapter III. Tile morning after old llrown's foolish triumph, -Mr. Khryn canie over to the rec tory, and asked lo -see hini for a few minutes alone. He h*4«ome over to ask for the amount of his first quarter's stipend — which was not due for another uianlh. lie was called up to town on business, 3ic explained, and he had not yet received his remittances from abroad. Brown did not receive his tithes in ad vance. He did not, in faex, receive them 'toe \- months after they fell due, nevertheless lie managed to lei Mr. .Ehvyn, who was pro fuse in his thanks, have* the money. \- It is very strange for such a rich man to be so hard up for money,*' the vecusr's wife remarked rather sharply when he to'd her the object of Mr. Hwyn's visit. ~ My dear,'1 Brown said in a tone of mild re proof, ' we are all liable to run out of ready money. Sir. Hwyn lias bad a {.Teat many calls upon him lately in settling iu a new house.' 'lie has not paid them if he Las,' said his wife severely. - He is in debt all over the viHage already.** *? He is {-Ding up to tomi on bnsiness, my dear ; probaWy to receive his remit tances,*' Brown suggested mildly. He al ways pat the best construction on tilings. Whatever tie business was thai took the curate ip to town, he took a packing rase of considerable dimensions, in addition to bis porrmontean, up with liim. The Rector had 'been paying a visit at -h» fnrtlipr end of the narish. on the road to Beestou Junction, and as he flood at the door of a cottage, tbe Fawlcy carriage, with the big packing ease on top, drove by. Mr. Elwrn returned from ton-n in limp for duty the. following Sunday— he left the picking case behind, Brown observed — and iris *' *iwns ** -were more impressive than ever. Tie Hector and lii» wife went to no more dinner parties at the Court ; his in tercourse with his wealthy curate'* family was restricted henceforth to tennis parties, and occasional afternoon tea. Mrs. Hwyn had a nervous constrained manner ; .. she did not get on at all rilii the rectors wife ; she never seemed quite at ease amid ** I'm sun? her husband is a periei*t IWue lward,' Mrs. lirown remai-ked one day when, she had been wiling at file Court. *' I never saw a woman so absolutely frigh ibere ii a cupboard witli an ugly secrcl in it in that house, and that poor broken -pirited riesiturr has got tin' key. By the \\\iiv. lbiH). those blue vases you were talk ioflVabout arc not on lite mantelpiece oi tbe drawing- room.' \- I should think r.dt !' iW Bettor an awerei - Hwyn, if he is a wise man. has \- locked them away. 1 i kould he very --orry careless sen-ants of ii'i might break them anv dav.*' Mr. fclwvii did not jrive bis servant* the opportunity of breaking tl.e beautiful 'Id vuina belo-qsiag to Fawley Coart. He liad it all locked away, he explained '-- Brown the next time he' railed, and was looking roond ihe room as if he missed something; he had put it all away in a place of safely, direetlv he was aware of its value ; even the china in the cabinets he had removed, and stored away with the rest, .iiid »oni!- tmmperv ornaments uf ilo value wore put The Rector did no* rare to visit tile dismantled room when all hi* «]?! friends n cr gone. There was a teapot, in a comer, which Mr. Elum, be noticed one day I..- called. uad overlooked. A delightful 'nlil Vi.r.-cs ter teapot, and he greeted it with a liiti? nod of recognition. ?? Is it of any value r~ Mr. Elwyn a-kc.1, following the direction of his ey,-^. Brown hesitated a moment : be di.lii'i want it to be put away, out of sight with the rest. -?It is Worcester.' be said. 'Old ?' \- V— e-^i ; decidedly old.' Tne next time he went to the Court the ?.Cipot was gone. Mr. F3wvn. as we have before remarked, was not good at visiting, hut his daughter t!ie parish, and did a jrreat deal of work in the schools * and ft'ie was an unwearied sick visitor. The Kcclor used to call her hi- lay cu rate : it seemed to him Dial Mart' Elwyn could ticver do enough in the pan*'). It would have bees unkind to oay Unit sW was not reaily fond of the work, (hat she did it Wider constraint. actnaled 'jy some conscientious motive. The Rector would not have said it for the world, bnt he had 'n« own opinion ; he could Toot have be lieved that a mere sense of duty would ? have urged a. girl to nuch unremitting labour. Hut the strange thing about it was that she did not teem to gel any en eouragamenl at home. Her father i-ted to speak ot her as ** my Quixotic daughter :' and Mrs. Elwyn seemed uneasy and distressed when any reference wa.s made to 'Mary's labouis in the parish. *' ?' She will make a capital clergyman's wife,'1 the Rector said to 1i&c; father one day, when thev happened to come aiTc^s Marj' in t).c vi)la}.-c. The curate smiled, and looked after his daughters retreating figure. '1 don t t'jink Mary will marry a clergyman,' be said significantly. ' .She will probably go Lo India.' .?aid then he told Broun that a -ou of uue or his county neighbour*, who had re c-ently returned fro:ii India on leave, lmd asked h-^ permi-sion to pay his adilrc. se£ to his daughter. ** And you S' Brou~n inquiivd hastily ; he kneiv the voung man ivell, and could not have wished him a better wife. 'IS Oh, I gave him permission to take his -1irtnce. It would be a very gnod match for Mary— and sit? would go to India.'* l*i*o\vn rojieated this convensation to his wife diiectly be got home, tfhc smiled, and snooK ner i)e.4a. it is not going to worE suppose tiim^ have changed since I went comtiii'- I know I asked vbu fir^t, Jcnnv, and your father after.' ' Mrs. lironn smiled and s~ghed. as she recalled those far-off days, and an uuac CYunUihlc itjo^^uie gathered in her kind blue eyes. {-'?he had never regretted the promise she made l,» her father's curate so long ago. Her «*ye» had not shed*many tears since ll.ut n-ii-r lo-beforgotten day. and old liicwn gnl. up liastHy from his cliair, acd ki-dl »iv the tear Ijefore it had iimi; lo falj, ,-jnl his wife of fnrty years blushed like a g'rl again. ? lie Lad asked liar}' fi'st.

' Oh, JkO. you are so mailer -rf fact — a piiis a gin ? ' ** And doesn't know her own mind !** ' Yts, Mar-- Elw-yn knows her own mind,' his wife said sadly.

Tue eng;igeir.cnt was lo be 4 very &hort; one ; Kenneth ForlK's's leave was nearly expired, and prepanu.ions for Llie vreddine were luimed nil. Tlie trous-eau was on a most liberal scale. Its magnini^nie far exceeded anvthins that the Rector's wife had ever seen : »he could not help smiluig as she compari^l it with her ovvn humble trousseau rnat had done such splendid duty through all these forty yeans. There was some of it iji existence still. In spiie of all these grand preparations, the 'bride «*'iwt went about the village with a white frightened face, looking sadder .mil sa Jilor as t lie wedding-day approached. Jflie di-\ not seem to take tbe slightest in tcix^l in her beautiful things : she hated to talk about them. Mr;, lli-own was in the hnu*- when the \vi-i]iling dress iraine home, and the dress maker from a neighbouring town can:e over vvilli it. It required a great de.i] of persuasion to induce Maty to put on the dreaded gitmient. and when she had got ^t oil. and was erownrt with the wreath and veil, and her mother led her before the glass to see the effect, instead of blush ing and smiling 'jack at the lovely image ?''? .-+ ? reflected in it, as a bride-elect is supposed ro' do, she turned away from it with a shudder, and brofce down in an hysterical tit of tveepifig. There was nothing to be done but t« drag off the wedding finery and put everybody out of the room ai quickly as po&ciblc.; ' llyKtciicaJ people «ay eoch ridiculous tilings ; it is never safe to 'ct frtrangers listen lo their ravings. yuickly as Mrs. Brown had been hurried an'4y, siie eaught a tew incoherent words that the girl poured out in her frenzy. She was imploring Kenneth Forbes to re lease tier from her engagement, and Mns. Broira caught, or thought she caught, some wild words about bringing eorrow and shame u^ton him. the nmde up her mind as she hurried house, a little upset and flustered at this uneipacted termination of her visit, that she wouldn't say a. word to her 4in&ana; about what she had overheard : he would not understand that H was merely the nci;?en.se of an hysterical giri :' he would attach some serious importance lo it. Be sides, what could '* sorrow '' and *? shame ' have to do with Starr Elwyn ? Mrs. Krown was uneasy about the girl all day ; she had Tin idea that she was buliled at home, bulled and sat upon : but she cauliln't understand why sjie should break down and utter all that nonsense when she 'put on her wedding gown. It ought to have been a supreme girls. ' -'a -«I'«ne moment to most After tea she went np to the Court to iuquiie after Mary lilwyn. -It -a-as a love'y June evening, and she -too*r4tbe short cut aeiu-,5 the fields and through the shrub bery, instead of going -iy the road surf Ihiju^'ii the lodge gates as she --as ac-! t-ustomrd to do wben the made a. fonnttl call. She reached the middle of the shrub leiy. which at this rime of the waur was densely wooded : the trees were in full leaf, ami there was a thick undergrowth, of fern : the place had been neglected and let run wild during the squire's absence, ami noUiins tad been done to it since Mr. Klwyn came. Mis. Brown had to posh the »oi«^bs aside to lias*, and the underarou-tli was j?o liuek and tangled with fern and brambles that she missed the path. S»o was turning back to retrace her steps, when the sound of voices aires-a-d her. The voicts were quite near, withal a few yards, but the speakers were hidden from her by a thick spreading hedge of yow - she knew the voices an a moment. It tvas Mary Hwyn and her lover. The girl was speaking in an agitated voioe ; she was begging Kenneth to release her from Jier engagement, to put off the wedilin«. \- My darling;' he was saying, - hour can you ask such a thing t is it ]»sllf. after all, that you do not love me, Mary !~ There was an ache in the inardv voice that 'Mrs. Drown could not help catching, and the girl was weeping. It was dread fully embarrassing for the Rector's wile ; she did not know whether to make her presence known, or to steal silently away. While the was still hesitating, the voices diviv nearer. Siie could have touched the s;-ea];er if tbe hel;.f hz6 not been '.i-lwetn. ' It is not that, Kenneth.' Mary was saying. *? Oh. if you only knew ! I can not tell yon the* reason ' now : vou will knon- the reason some dav — %vhv 1 wi-h liie ueJding put oir.

Bat &. few- days later more startling kr nached the Kectory ; the bailiffs were at the Court. The news (spread like wildfire through the village, and every little tradesman In the place crowded np to the great house with his iitt. *Ur Ehryn had not returned, and his -rife was confined to her room. The poor woman was too terrified and overwhelmed vritfl this calamity to see anyone. She wrote a very piteous note to Brown, begging ix'aa to let her hare a few pounds, ' as her husband had left her without any money in the house. He had only paid Hwyn his quarterly stipend a, lew days befiSre he went away, 1-nt he sent the poor woman a fivepound . note, and begged her to communicate with bar husband immediately. . No doubt She did so ; for the next thing le heard was that she and the children had gone away. The bailiffs had stopped . the luggage, but they had let the weeping Woman and her children go. The luggage left behind was all tint Rally belonged, to Mr. Hwyn. Hie furni ture—and the plate — and toe china, the beautiful old china— belonged to the Squire. (Brown tdegAphed at once to Sir G3£9^s lawyer in town to come down with out delay. He came down by the next train. ' ? 'Brown never could be persuaded to tell tiie aeqnel of the miserable etory. lfjs oe£i 'raw ocieny When Sir Giles's lawyer went through the house, the plate safe— the lock of ?which sad teen forced — was found empty! And all the beautiful old china was gone! Brown's 'wretched- egotistical story had aroused toe miserable man's greed ; his -wife had read aright the revelation of the . cupidity it bad awakened in his glittering ' .eyes alight* \- Tie humiliation of poor Brown during that terrible time was dreadf oil His wife declared that he went gray in a week. No 'wonder! It vas he wio had brought Mr. Hwyn into Beeston-Boyal. It was he who gave his old friend, Sir Giles, confi dence to Jet 4ns family place, with its priceless heirlooms, to 'nis wealthy enrate — and it was he who sad helped him to carry them away ! The hag tihi. Brown had assisted to carry, at the risk of his life, and with the sweat of his brow, contained his old friend's family plate ! There was very little left for the bailiffs \- to distrain upon. The poor girl s tronaaean — * -coUartion of W.A. hood* of different j ~vmiV£xsili£S^**and some volumes cf printed ; sermon* Ijy eminent divines.

'The earth bath babbles, as the water has, And they are of them.— Whither are; they vanished V i But they were not all bubbles. Months after, lira. Brown beard by accident that Mary Elwyn was employed as a nurse in i ? a London hospital. Of coarse she found; her out without delay— and of course, eoej wrote to tiie lover that she bad nm away I from in that unreasonable — she always in* { aste upon calling it, that honourable — j .way, and told him her story, and the story ! ' of that Bluebeard cupboard, of which the i unhappy girl 'had the key. The days of Quixotism are not quite j orer. Kenneth Forbes came home from India «o leave toe following year ; and this time he took a wife back with, him. 'Yon were quite right,' he vrote to Mis. Brown on the eve of the wedding. ** If Mary lored me «he had no alternative bat to nm away.3 {The Ec-i]
