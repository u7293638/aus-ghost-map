THEOSOPHY What is theosophy ! Tis a philosophy Meaningless, objectless, blasphemous, vain; Not atheistical, Nor yet deistical— A thing its apostles find hard to explain. A whim of insanity ; Never inanity Like it was heard out of Bedlam before ; Claiming affinity With a divinity — Not the Divinity Christians adore. Nothing devotional, Nothing emotional, Nothing to make sinners feel ill at ease ; But in its vanity Saying, 'Humanity, Do what you will and profess what you please.' What's life? Evolution Is all the solution 'Theosophists to the inquiring -can give. What's death? Hibernation Till re-incarnation Gives the soul a new body in which it may live. Such is theosophy, With its philosophy Fostering belief in ghosts, goblins, and fays. Ancient mythology Or demonology Were just as worthy belief as this craze.
