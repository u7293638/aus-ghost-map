The lion and the Bear. Tyrant o'er millions in thy empire vast, Thy. greedy eyes to other .lands are oast, And while with peace-pretending words you oloak Your plans, your actions all to war provoke. ; To India would you maroh with sword and flame, But never more-while Britain has a name I Britain won India with her heroes' blood, And where her troops unflinchingly have stood 'Gainst all the dusky hordes that fought for home, They still shall stand when Russia's armies come 1 Tyrant of all the Russias, mighty Czar, The British Lion thirsts not for a war, But that stout heart was never known to yield To Boar or other upon the battlefield. Are there no wrongs to right, no desperate needs At home ? Or do you think by warlike deeds To make some land more wretohed than thine own, By plundering it to save thy tottering throne ? Tyrant, thy subjects curse thee, and the words Will lend a sharpness to thy enemies' swords The groans of thousands of ¡Siberian slaves-r The ghosts of thousands from thy viotims' graves, Shall mingle in the conflict, and thy foes Shall be the avengers of thv country's woes !
