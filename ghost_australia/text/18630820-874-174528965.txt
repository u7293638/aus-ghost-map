ANSWERS TO CORRESPONDENTS. NEW CHUM.—Australian trees are, generally speaking, not deciduous. We know, however, one tree, the boot-tree, which is uniformly without leaves during the winter. EDITOR.—Yes, it is true that Mr. KENNY contemplates the issue of a new colonial paper at Bights' Mills, but we cannot tell you anything about his editorial arrangements. HENRIETTA MATILDA.—If you go to the fancy ball as a stage ghost, you will have to wear very gauzy attire. Did yo\i ever see a statuette of Yenus covered up from the flies 1 Perhaps you had. better not. CONSTANT READERS.—You ask whether we consider the famous Cardigan charge at Balaclava as the most intrepid ever made. We answer, Yes; excepting Judge STAWELL'S charge to the jiuy on the recent CLOUGH case. A.X.—At short whist, with eleven trumps lead the highest; with twelve it is immaterial. At long whist ten points make a score, although COLENSO says twenty. You had better write to Bell's Life. HIPPOPHAGIST.—We cannot say whether horse flesh is good eating or not, but we should not mind trying a bit of Macaroni. Horse radish, also, is not positively disagreeable, with an accompaniment of roast beef. BELL'S "Life in London" was never edited by the gentleman recently compensated by the Victorian Parliament, for his trouble ingoing to that city. S.—You are quite right, as a journalist, in speaking ironically of a man's affection for his wife and children. Indeed, he ought to be gratefid to you, for you give him the opportunity of proving, on his and their oaths, that your statements are utterly without foundation. Should he throw away the chance, the inference is clear! S-NCL—R.—If you are ever insulted in the same way again, mention it at once. Accusations are not like Port—they don't improve by keeping. P.O. M'H-L-H-N. — You are quite right. There is a disturbance among the Po-UsTi at home as well as here.
