On Wednesday (New Year's Day) a social gathering assembled at the Hookina Hotel (Mr. 15. Kirwan's) about 5) a.m., and proceeded thence to Yallooloo Water, distant about five miles. The day's sport consisted of singing, dancing, foot-racing, jumping, and a single wicket cricket mutch bctwten the inaiiied and single men of the abovenamed township. About 12 o'clock about 50 persons sat down to luncheon, hospitably provided by Host C. E. Jainiesou. Messrs. W. and H. Finn (violinists) and Simcock and Hurt (organ accordionists) kindly gave their services for the occasion, aud added much to the day's eujoyment. At 3 o'clock p.m. the married men left the carnival group and took their places on the ciickct field, ready to answer to the young bachelors challenge at the before mentioned cricket match. Many of the married ladies came to witness the play and share the honour of their dear husbands ; but, alas! as it proved, only to see their most disastrous defeat, they evidently not standing the ghost of a chance against the " young colts." The play commenced at 3 o'clock p.m., and Mr 0. H. Hart having won the toss decided to send his men to the wickct, and it was not until'5.15 their last wicket fell, Mr. C. H. Hart contributing 17 and Mr. T Darby 12 by first class cricket, Hart never giving a chance during the three-quarters of an hour he was at the wickct. At 5.30 the married men took the willow, but could do little or nothing against the bowling of Hart and Finn, the former bowling splendidly. For the losers Mr. E. Kirwan, sen., did good service in the trundling department. Theficlding was good throughout, Mr. T. Darby especially distinguishin, ,, ,, ,« . j. „ . are slung himself at point.

Booth's i b g Smuggler has gained a good reputation ! through having been a competitor in several i well-contested races in the district, and Mr. j Iiaglcss's b g Tim has a great local repute i for speed and bottom. Tim was the favorite ! at starting, but though he was most pluckily • ridden by Mr. H. McCouvill, jun., he failed j to catch thetfiidge's eye first, Smuggler • (owner up) being tlie winner by two clear lengths, Tim second, Lubra distanced. For the Publicans' Purse four started.
