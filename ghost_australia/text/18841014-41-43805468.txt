SPORTING. THE FORTHCOMING SPRING MRRTTISlft. fBv Telegraph, I IFrom our own Reporter. 1 Newmarket, October la, Morning. It was tolerably fine this morning, and a number- Of horses worked, but only the cinder and tan tracks were fit for use. Morrison sent Dirk JbUttenucK alone, and Creawick led The Broker a -good working gallop of about two , miles. Both these chesunts are in fine form. War rior and Privateer did a mfle and a half at a strong pace, the former going ;very 'nicely; Victress, Plausible. Commotion, Hurricane, Sir Modred, BristoL- and Battalions all did nice work, and the latter must have an out side chance, on Saturday. Conjecture was given a long' canter. She looks very fight and tucked up. Lavingtoh went a mile 'and- a half at top speed, Delatnia bringing him home thB last naif mile. : The colt looks well. Signor, who has grown and improved a great deal, does good work alone,. He looks to be above himself, Bargo ;gall,oped the Derby distance. on the tan, Tremando going with him part of the way.' Despot, Martini-Henri, and The Agent exercised.: ' . . : Melbourne, October 13. S p.m. \- There- is .very little doing at the rjems to- day. rFive to J. is offered on the field' for the Caulfleld Cup; but the only business done was in connection with MartinifHe.nry, who was backed down to 100 to 7, and then receded to 100 to 6. For the Derby, some money was laid against Bargo at 6 to 4, while 100 to 10 was offered bar one. Melbourne, Ootober 13, 11.35 p.m. There was some opposition toBargo for the Derby today ; but the layers did not succeed in driving the colt back much. It seema that' he galloped on the cinder-track thia morning, and a rumour got about that he had not pulled up all right, thia idea being strengthened by his not being out with the rest of Fennelly a string in the afternoon. In the evening the owner of The Broker, who Beems rather fond of sensational wagering, came into the Victorian Club and took £1,000 to £250 four times about Cplatoun for the Caulfield Cup. At the same time he bet £1,000 that he gets a place, and wound up by accepting £1,200 to £800 and £1,000 to £800 about Bargo for the Derby. Afterwards 6 to 4 was offered. on the field for the Derby. For the. Maribyrnong Plate Melodious is in great 'demand, 10 to 1 being wanted, while 7 to 1 was offered about Uralla.
