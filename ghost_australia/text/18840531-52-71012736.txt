Religious Fanatics. (BY TELEGRAPH. FBOM OUB COEEÏSPOUDÏNT.) ADELAIDE, Friday. TTT-_Al _ _1 *1 1 ?«_1_,1 . _«_ WOOD, une " wouia-oe neaier," is now perform ing under the auspices of the Salvation Army, his credit with the " Christian - crusaders," as well as the general public, having reached a low j ebb. The Eev. Mr. Shorthose, .who always accompanies Wood on the platform, has written a violent letter to the local Press, in which he attacks with special virulence the religious journals of the colony. He declares that the light has been brought to them, but they will not receive'it, and they turn away with dazed optics. Wood held an all-night meeting in the Salvation barracks, Light-square, last night. The affair has formed the subject of unfavour able comment to-day1, owing to the number of young people of both sexes who attended the meeting. ADELAIDE, Monday. Wood, the alleged healer, returned to Mel bourne on Saturday. His last attempts at curing were productive of great derision. At the fare well thanksgiving meeting in the Town Hall hera the attendance was small, and the audience far from sympathetic. After he had enu merated a number of alleged cures, Wood tried to give an address on the "Lord's Coming/' but was hissed and yelled down. He was only heard to say that he had cured 3000 souls and bodies in South Australia; a statement which was received with incredulous laughter and jeers. He also affirmed that the Holy Ghost would Bhortly retiro from tho world/ and thoso who had opposed bim from quarters where ho had least expocted opposition would meot an angry God and go to eternal damnation. A man named Chambers then attempted to read a lotter full of improbable, not to say impossible, cures alleged to have been effected by .T. A. Dowie, of Mel bourne, but immediately he began Wood and his assistants abruptly left tho platform.
