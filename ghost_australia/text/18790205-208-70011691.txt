\- (From our ownr Correspodlent.) L; oixno, Dec.-20. Auouther wicked war of Iiggressioln guinist Afgghan istai has been begun, upon the i ost h]ypocriticnl prelexts. It is al?atys iolispensableL to glaze in iquiitous designs with imor orless varnish of dtlceecy, but in tle present case the colouring matter tied is singularly thin.. We wan Ito " rectify" our ' " un scientific frontier," and so by 'hook or crook we fastten a quIrrel upon our innocent ncighbour, in ordsar to bespoil him of the territory we covet. Of course the buccnneering statesmen who perpcetrate this flagitious crime are the loudest and frothiest praters about national " hoLour." The Viceroy of India has issued a proclamation seeking to justify the. commncuement of . this nefarious forvy. lie unmphl is of "the ill-oill aind discourtesy" with which the Aneer has reltid our kindness. Even, for argument's sake, taking Ill this as literal gospel, it would not, warrant the de spatch of a filibustering and plundering expelition against: him. At. the utmost it would only sanction our sending to Coventry the neighbor who had he ihaved so churlishly. Lord Lytton's next charge is that of having "openly tand assiduously attempted, both by olrds and deeds, to stir iI)t religious hatred and war against our Indian Eimpire.' This is as entirely newl co nt in the Vicereplt indictment. If it had any particle of truth in it, and were not obviously thronn in as a mere make-weight, slwhy have we not heard a single syllable about it before? Every conceivable matter of accusation has for mouths past bIxen diligently asked up agninst the Amtcer, to inflame and exasperate the English mind, and not until war against hint has been formally declared have wie this terrible enormity imputed to huli. Thus we actually punish hiti before making known his offence. .Agiin, considering how lonog we have been maissing our troops and bringing up our artillery and warlike supplies close to his borleis, o as-el as tampering with the loyalty of his subjlctts, withl the vowed object of over-awsing and threatening hint, it, requires a hardihood equal to that, of IEsop's wolf inl charging the lamb. with troubling the waters for Lord Lytton to complain that the Aneer lha made, in turn, some poor and feeble defensive preparations. Then comess thle true source of the Viceroy's rage-the real head and front of Slhi, Ali's offending. Tile A?ncer Ihas rejected our Envoi while receiving tie Russian one. fIils Lme. 'lhii is nat outtrlg so intolerable ias only to be fitly expiitedl by rivers of lood. Of ltwo things one:-- ither tle .\raer ras free to rveseie or reject otur Mlission, or Ie Wiass not free. If he ?s?, what becomes of our rooas dll. If he was not, what ieomes of his "indleplendence " tÂ£hat independence, too, le it ob.-served the Ticeroy, in this very proclamation, professes it to In his intlentio to respect. This profession hlie makes inl worts. while by deeds ahe is its the very act of openIly violating it. Could an1y self-eonlnsdiction be morc flagrant or shamecless ? 'Chl option of saying whether lie will or not admit foreign envoys to his capital is ati essential attribute of a sovereign's in dependence; and yet tiwe seek, by thrtusting our envoy upon himo, notle* colis, to stab the very at tributoe we hlypocritially affect to be anxious to guard. Thus proud EInogland is made to appear before the world with the sword in onle hand and a lie in the other. fNor is this dishonourable aspect of the case mended by thel insolent arrogance with which thI Viceroy avers that "the influence of another P'ower in Afghanistan cannoto be tolerated!" Are we to fight for an exclusive aind predominanim t influecee there, while our present complaint is that we'are not treated by its ruler as s well as Russia? No doubt it is a rebuff to our self love'that Slihcre Ali should prefer our rival to uts: but surely it is as un dignified as it is unwise on tlhat account to give'vay to transports of blind nage and jealousy.' If the case llad been exactly reversed, and the Russian nrvoy excluded while ours was admitted, how shoull we have viewed a Russian expedition against Afghalistati ? Any notdid man will be at no loss to answer this question. Let tus thct face the thing -ahlo-y and nationally, auti we shall find that we need nieitlher be frightened fromn our propriety nlor worked up into a twhite hlot with lrassion. A gen ration ago we invaded .fglhanishtu and excited the deep ni d bitter hatred of its people against its, 0as we are now senselessly doing ngain. It is not un naturail, therefore, that they should look with more comllacenc5y ono the Russians, against whlomn tlhey as vet have no suich grudge, than on us, until tat least they find lhat; their norefriends seek to become their masters. " Then we may be pretty sure there will be a strong reronlsion of fieeling at CLabul against the Muscovites. This reaction will come in good time, if by our own rash violence anld weak fretful ness we do not hinder it. Then the Aueer may be glad enough to abandon his present fit of the sulks and to sue again for our good offices. At the worst, he caunot desire to be gobbled np by our "rivals any more than by us ; and, no doubt, at the bottom of his heart lurks the very natural sentiment, "A piague on both your houses." lie must dread the fatal toils woven round his devoted country by botlh of us. 1 lo must deroutly r ish to be the vnssal or the puppet of neither of us. lIe will not consider either of us the disinterestedl champion of-his in dependence. Let its, then, not spoil all by driving him and his subjects complletely into the arms of Russia. 'Why should att ungovernable lust, of forcing things make us play into our ri?il's hands? If we indeed think tlere is real danger of the Anmeer intriguing and plotting behind our backs with tlhe Czar against the pence of India, why cam not we frankly address ourselves to the Czar's Go vercnont, and seek to comlle toe clcar uIderstanding withl it, as Lord Lawrence and Lord IMayo urged, instenld of gloomily brooding over all utanoner of possible or impossible suspicions and timing our blows at a Pritnce who, after Ill, is not the roil foe we dteaid nor the true mark we wish to hit, even if Ito were antll atigonist worthy of our steel.

Lord Beaconsfield as certed'that under the Treaty of Berlin great results had been aecomplished, considering the time which \- had elapsed, and Cyprus would soon' be recognised :as- a most important possession.-In the Commons the Marquis of lartingtoun criticised the Queen's S- -peeeh, : and said lie saw no justification for the !:-f?ghaun .war. Mr. Gladstone followed, aid the C (ehancellor, of the Exchequer amid some cheering, Ssaid d thatere was no foundation for the iaecosation :di'that the Government intended fiou the first to -, pick it quarrel with the Ameer. EJentually the SAddress was agreed to in both Houses. .. :The policy of the Government in coinection with, the war' ans not, however, long left, uiechallenged in both lHouses. In the Commons, Mr. WVitbread, backed by the leaders and main body of the Liberals, moved a vote of censure founded on the evidence con:tained in the official correspondence. Tihe sharp ddbate- to which this gave rise extended over a Snwhole week, and although the Ministerialists were no simteh for their hioirerful assailants in argument, their deficiencies in this respect were :nmply made up by superior riumbers,:if indeed the result of a division can siupply such defects. They had a majority of 101 over their opponents, as was gener ally expected would be the case. It was a slight damper to the Ministerial victory that, on the very day after it was achieved the important constituenicy of Bristol, the capital of the West country, re turned by a very large majority, after a desperate fight in which the Tories, aided by the confederated publicans and Roman Catholics, put forth their whole might, a Liberal of the most advaiced type, and a sworn foe of the war. This and other recent chance elections raise grent doubts whether the M Ministry are nearly as strong in the comitry as they clearly are in the House. T?wo more nights' debate occurred in the same Schamber on the subsidiary question as to how the cost of the war should be defrayed-by the Indian Exchequer only, or by the British, or by both con j o. jintly. The Government proposed to throw the whole burden on India, and in the end they carried their resohition even more triumphantly than before. But some of their own supporters were ashanied of this mean and high-handed proceeding, had'urged them to promiso bye-and-bre to come to the help of the Indian Treasury, which is in any Sthing but a flourishing state. They undertook to do this should the hostilities be unexpectedly pro l onged or extended 'but meanwhile they have got formal sanction for making India pay every farthing of the bill to the end of the chapter. - Of course theOpposition were indignant, and protested loudly against the discreditable shabbiness of makhing the famine-str?cken rybts bear the entire cost of an Im perial war, ordered by proud and rich England, nominally against poor Shore Ali, but virtually aginist the Czar of all the'KRnssias, as part of the 'great 'game she has becin lately playing both in aurope arid in Asia against'that mighty Piotentate. Gieat distress exists in the country, aggravated, if not ciused; by the restless .and turbulent policy of the Ministry, who slrink it al ime of bank and comnirciul failures, and dearth of employment, to lay lc the'new taxes relguired to meet the growing def.ct i day of.reckoninig, however, cannot be I taedoffl fdor ever. . Th' e minor operations beyond our Indian frontier to which the military authorities will confine them ;. ?elves till the spring are proceeding with the kind of successwhich wiea anticipated, and with no more .;interruption from the fierce Hill-men than our ex -. perienced generals should Iare counted ulpn. Our Sline of communication in the Khyber Pass lhas been cut for days together by clouds of marauders which gather and thicken inl exact proportion to the open ings left for their activity. There was much boast ing at the outset about our having won over to our \- side the. Afrmedees and other border tribes. The events of the last few days, when our convoys have been pillaged: and driven back, our small detached ,.parties slaughtered, and our camps alarmed by night, have already dissipated some of this fond self delusion. , Of-course more troops have been ordered up, to clear the avy. It is well; for, before we have done, there may be plenty of rough work found for \- them. HIour soldiers can only keep down their .friends," they. may be safely trusted to manage their enemies. But it will not do for us to be over -confident. A feen early successes may prove.de ceitful ; and the falling back, of the enemy before our advance-about which there has been some foolish '; crowing,:'-may be only a -rave to draw our :forces rlto ?strapp. The I experinces of the Afghan S-ar of 18i0 ought- not to be lost on our commanders, a .lthoth, munhappily, there is a proneness of one ::generation to forget or despise even the sternest -lessons read to its predecessors. \- The Queen and the Royal Family have sustained ' a ?grmatbercavement.- -The Grand Duchess of Hlesse IIarmstadt, :better-known as the Plrincess , Alice, died of diphtheria on Saturday, tie anniversary ,t of the death of the Prine Consort, seventeen years ago.::: Shl nias buried at'Darmstadt on'Wednesday, S-the Prince of Wales anddl'rince Leopold attending \- lier funeral. Her Royal- Highness's children had been sulfring from diphtheria, which indeed carried off one of them in spite of all her tenderest care and personal nursing; and there is no doubt, that beh herself fell a victim to her motherly devotion. How this good Princess matched at her father's death-bed, ministered to the dangerous illness of her eldest brother, aud later still, tended the sick and wounded soldiers of her adopted' country during the Franeo-Germmn -nar, is well known. Her many virtues endeared her to all. She is deeply mournd far and wide. Parliament and . other public bodies have expressed sincere condolence , witd HerMajesty, who bears up bravely under the stroke. SSaturdlay, the 30th ult., being St. Andrew's day, the sons of Caledonia resident in Iondon, and indeed throughout, :the Empire, celebrated the. festival of their patron sabit in their accustomed manner.

T'he grantd.'jury lhowever, has throwii out the bill against them: :' s, December 21. h. 'e Senate is not dyiug game; after ill the' thlratenings of the coaleceed monarchists in that moribund Assembly, their last legislative acts have been devoted to :hanginl the colour of the soldiers'a pantaloons, and improving the nhoeing of cavalry horses. J'Not a word from the great saviours of society. M'essrs. do Broglie and Buffet, about the social peril,' family religion, that the accession to power of millionaire republicans and married churchgoing fathers, was to compromise. The fact is, that screaming farce against the Republic has been played out, and its actors hissed off the stage. It has ever been a problem with French tailors to make 'a pantaloon for their braces "that would never blush." Senator and chemist Kestner pro-. poses to effect this by employing a new colour, ali zarine, in place of madder. The Minister of War neerr bheard of such a dye, but as its use would effect a saving of 15,000,000fr.-more than is required to endow the reformed churches and the synagogues he was prepared to investigate the discovery. Sedan is not a lucky name for the army ; this town sup plies the cloth' to the military clothiers, and great complaints have been current as to its quality; after using it a short time, the troops complained they had "nothing to wear." But how did the military inspectors accept broadcloth below sample? They niot only received, but demanded'us a matter of course, bribes fromnt the manufacturer; and here is how one palm was greased to the tune of 6000fr., said Senator Gridaine, producing a letter from an officer demanding.'said sum. The Minister of Jiustice hiring read the letter, put it in his pocket; soon he will set his furies to work. Turkev and Russia are thus not the only countries whuce back sheesh has to be met as indubitably as death and the tax gatherer. Under tihe second emipire, this cor ruption was hardly concealed ; but at' p'rsent; it is enough to make the snow melt on the cheek of the statue of the Republic on the vestibule of the Champ de tars. Up to the present the inferiority. of the French cavalry horses was considered du? to the animals being fed on the Gascon principle, and to excessive cheese-paring in the price offered for the animals to breeders, which compelled the latter, despite the best patriotism in the world, to prefer English pitr chasers. But money has no odour, or if any at all, not unfragrant. Senator Latour traces the cavalry defects to the horses being badly shod, the conse 'quence of inefficient farriers. The latter, it seems, wrhen their period of service is completed, desire to enter into private life, as rapidly as non-coni missioned ofilcers. For want of a nail, the shoe was lost; for want of a shoe, &e.; Even the rigid Conservatives, those who desire to govern against the will of the nation, commence to. feel that it a down-right bore and loss of valuable time, having to go to Versailles to discharge legisla tive duties: hence it is not improbable the Cham-' bers may h]old their nest Session in Paris. One of the advantages and dangers of thelegislature sitting in the Corps Legislatif was that it: the event of revolution, the representatives could be thrown con-' veniently into the Seine. This prospect is no longer possible, since the nation has learnt to rely on coutys of voting papers, instead of cojups of rifles. Then th'se disturbers of political peace, the Royalists and Bonapartists, having been definitely set aside in favor of the nation itself governing, no revolutions are' henceforth possible, so the services of 3it. Valerien, will be no longer required, to protect the palace of Yersailles with its cannon. Of late, the legislation as well as the administration of the coun try has been conducted, partly in Paris, partly in railway trains, and partly at Versailles. Tihe parlia mentary trains ire accused of being freighted with as many 'soiled doves as legislators. There was a tinme when lcThiers was President, that he would have been impeaclhed had Ihe slept out of Versailles a single night; now the IMarshal never resides in the necropolis of Frmne though bound to do so uccording to the same unrepecled ?ede aud Persian lan.: Neither this death-bed tolerance towardnls the Republic, 'nor a conscience- struck admiration for Thiers, whom they overthrew and persecuted, will save the outgoing Monarclhal senators, from not so much a well-merited defeat, as an execution. The lFrectraders have at last taken time by the forelock, and have held a meeting in the Theatre Ilalien- an establishment which,, after being sold for an insurance otliee. itlhas beenfoumd could not be appropriated for other than musical purosees. 'The, Presidents of the Chambers of Commerce of Paris, Lyotns, and Bordcaux, assisted by other notable, persons, i; "wentini for the firethode ticket," and not a moment too soon, as their rivals were commencing to irave a hold on the country, and seizing the ocea sion of the universal commercial depression to black bdil the foreigu trader. This society must not be confounded with that'specially constituted for con verting the United States to lowered lariffs. It must be confessed the. French' are very apathetic about.the whole business: perhaps they may dis play more icterest when the absorbing question of the Senatorial elections shall Iave been settled next month. Then the Ministry must produce a pro grammce.. Tlie Republiams-dirvided on the ueitiofi -will have to' outbid the Botapartists on liberal commercial treaties, and if the latter woisld orily devote their attention to matters of this sature they would soon iÂ£nd 'it 'hpa better than organising Billingsgate rows ii tlhe Chambers, celebrating political inidses, and feasting at banquets, where the dishes are named after the "'glories" of the bite Empire,' less lMexic acid 'Sedan--too suggestive of the Banquo ghost. Besides the common event of.duelling, sciow balling is the next prominent amusement, in which small as well as moustache boys heartily join ; with these combatants, as rith the sappers, nothitig is sacred ; I noticed them.imprinting "stars"-on 'the equestrian statue of Louis XIV. in the Place de la' Victoire, as alio on the snerameintal Liberty, Equality, and Fraternity, painted in black letters over a communal school. In- some instances snow was made into blocks, and the features of Napolcoii IlI. shaped, by a few master touches of' a knife; then it was as irreverently treated as if it were a Guy Fawkes. ' Many spectators were delighted at the punishment thus indicted on the effigy of the "MIan of Sedan"-as it was baptised. Jules Janin called, in a cholerie moment, Paris "the city of mud", -and which made Victor Hugo his enemy for ever. The caplital is very- muddy now: cities generally are duriog a thaw.
