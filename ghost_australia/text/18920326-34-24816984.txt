THE WINDSOR MURDER. DINHAM VILLA DOOMED. A Liverpool Ghost. LONDON, March 25, 6.15 a.m. Rainhill is still thronged by crowds of people, who have come from all parts of the United Kingdom to look at the scene of the murders which have now been made notorious in every corner of Great Britain. Disorder has prevailed for several days, while every fresh fact made known in connection with Deeming's career of crime has further excited the crowd. The wrath of the rougher portion of the visitors culminated on Thursday in an attack on Dinham Villa, where the victims were buried. The mob stormed the house, and in spite of the efforts to keep them out they swarmed through every room, breaking off relics and other wise wantonly damaging the property, the owner of which has decided to demolish it, as all attempts at letting it would now be fruitless. It is alleged on good authority that Mrs. Deeming was seen in Liverpool at a date subsequent to that on which it is supposed by the police that she and her children were murdered.
