'THE SEVENTY-SEVENTH ANNIVERSARY OF THE COLONY. THE REGATTA. The principal entertainment provided for the thou sands of people who turn out to keep holiday on Anniversary Day, as well as the most popular, is un doubtedly the Regatta. Regattas, though not peculiar to the country, flourish here as they flourish nowhere else, and receive a larger share of public patronage than any other out-of-door entertainment. Judging from the Regatta of Thursday, there is little fear of this entertainment sinking in public estimation. Every point from which a view of the various aquatic contents could be seen was densely crowded by the pleasure-seekers, who had come determined to see the boat-races; while on board the flag- ship the company was much larger, though not less select, than on many previous occa- sions. The splendid Black Ball clipper ship, Queen of the South, now on the berth for London, did duty as flagship, and her fine saloons and spacious decks and roomy cabins were the theme of general remark. Scores of flags of everynation floated from her rigging. The Volunteer Rifle Band played a varied ana excellent selection of music throughout the day, luncheon and liquids of ever}* kind were at hand to refresh the inner man, while the immense number of craft of every size and rig flitting hither and thither upon the water gave an auimation to the scene which was most pleasing to witness? As before remarked, the company on board the ship was very large, and included several members of both branches of our Legislature and some of our most influential citizens. His Excellency the Governor and suite came on board at about one o'clock, and were received with a salute, the Commodore of the Royal Yacht Squadron conducting his Excellency through the ship, At one o'clock an excellent luncheon was served in the saloon, the Hon. W. Walker, commodore of the Royal Sydney Yacht Squadron, in the chair. On the chairman's right was his Excellency Sir John Young, and on his left, Lord John Taylour. After discussing the excellent fare provided, The part)- then returned to the deck to witness the progress of the races. It should not be omitted to mention that the 'tween-decks were cleared fore and aft, and, being decorated with festoons of evergreen, was converted into an immense lunchcon-room. After luncheon was over, the tables were cleared, and the lovers of Terpsichore indulged in their favourite pastime. The weather was all that could be desired — a warm, but not too fervid sun, with a beautiful cool refreshing breeze from the north-east. Both for pull ingand sailing the weather was magnificent. Tlie arrangements on board the ship were excellent, and gave the utmost satisfaction. No accident marred the enjoyment of the day. The starter, Mr. F. AY. Hill, and the umpire, Mir. S. Spain, were assiduous in the performance of their duties, and everything passed off most pleasantly. A detailed account of the racing is appended. First Race. — To start at ten o'clock. All youths under sixteen years of age, pulling a pair of sculls in dingies not exceeding twelve feet on the keel. Course — From flagship round Fort Denison and back to flagsliip.

Murray. I'll Try. Dress — White, with blue cap. Colours — Blue and white. Puller — P. Hayes. Tliis was an easy victory for. Stevenson, in the Hebe. He cut out the work immediately after the start, was never caught, and won 'with ease ; M'Leer, in Alarm, second. Second Race. — To start at half-past ten. All youths under eighteen years of age, pulling two pairs of sculls in light skiffs. Course — From Dawes' Point round Fort Denison, and back to the flagship. First prize, £8 3s. ; second, £3 3s.

Arden, G. Stewart. In tliis race M'Leer and Yates, after a sharp contest in the early part of the race, had it pretty much their ovn way. In coming liome, after rounding Fort Denison, they were evidently pulling at their ease, with Bell and Place (in the Rose) second, Swan third, and Cornstalk last. Third Race. — To start at 11. All bona fide ballast boats under canvas. Course — From their own moor ings in Farm Cove round a boat moored off Manly Beach, back round a boat off Goat Island, and bacx to the flagsliip.

Owlltt*— W. Bayliss. Ernest. Dress — White, and red caps. Colours — Blue and white. Owner — J. Blue. An excellent start was effected with these boats, a id I as they stood across towards the North Shore, acco n panied by the coasters in the fourth race, and a lar^e number of other craft, they presented a very pretty sight. The Day Dawn was the first to show promi nently in the race, and next Colleen Bawn. As they turned down the harbour towards Bradley's Head, Day Dawn appeared to have most speai, but Colleen Bawn had a better wind. It was evident that, barring Accidents, that the race lay between them. When they reached the boat off Manly Beach Colleen Bawn had a strong lead, wliich she held to tlie finish of the. race. Day Dawn defeated the remainder for second place, ana the Orphan Boy was third. Some people had a good deal of faith in Orphan Gill, and the new boat Ernest, but neither of them showed prominently in the race. Fourth Racc. — To start at 11. All vessels bona £de employed in tlie coasting trade within the limits of the colony. Course — From their own ' moorings in Farm Cove round a boat moored off Manly Beach, back round Clark Island, then round boat off Manly Beach, .and back to the flagship. First prize, 30 guineas ; second, 10 guineas. Entrance, two guineas. Peahen. Colour — Daifc blue. Owner — W. Beattie ... 1 Wanderer ? ., .. . r 2 Sheedy .. .. .. .. .. ? ? 3 The Peahen was the favourite for this race, and she won it easily. Owing to the course being almost almost entirely down the harbour, very little was seen of the vessels until they came up the harbour to finally pass tlie sliip, when it was seen that the Peahen led by an immense length. Sheedy was absolutely nowhere. Fifth Race. — To start at a quarter-past eleven. For all pulling dingies not exceeding fifteen feet over all, under canvas. Course — From their own moor ings in Lavender Bay round Goat Island, then round Garden Island, then round flagship and Fort Denison, and back to flagsliip. First prize, £7 7s. ; second, £2 2s.

Owner— ; J. Smail. ; The boats in tiiis race were so close together as they I left Lavender Bay and stood away toward Goat I Island, that no one of them could be made out to have I an advantage. As they passed the flagship, after I rounding the first point, Betsy Eagar had.a lead, which l she continued to ? increase- until the close of the race. The colours of some of the boats in this race were so similar, that it was with great difficulty they could be distinguished. In passing round the 'ship, after rounding Garden Island, Betsy Ea^ar was leading, with Lurline second, and Lisette 'third, which order j ?was maintained to' the finish, Betsy Eagar winning by' j a longdistance. Sixth Race.— To start. at half-post eleven. All amateurs pulling a pair of oars in lignt skiffs. Course | —From flagsliip round Fort Denison, , thence rpund. a. boat moored oft Goat Island and back to the flagship. First prize, £12 12b. ; second, £3 3s. Entranc'e, £1 Is. Star of Australia.

Colours — Pink and white. Pullers — H. M'Leer, P. Marky ? Doib7e% ®'d Conner, in^tke Star of Australia, were the favoil^s for tliis race, and they justified the con fidence nlaceif in them by winning it ; but it was no gift. The tliree boats got away well together, and soon settled into their places. Star of Australia leading and Atldete second. Very little difference in the two leading boats was observed until rounding Fort Denison, when M'Leer and Booker, in Atliletc, put on the steam, got into fust place, and maintained it past the flagship and round the boat moored oft' Goat Island. A desperate struggle for the premier position now took place, resulting in favour of Donnelly and Connor by half a length. Swan nowhere. Seventh Race. — To start at 12. All yachts, centre boards excluded. Time for tonnage, half a minute to the ton, Yaclits to rate as ten tons. Course — To start from their own moorings in Farm Cove round a boat moored off Goat Island, then round a boit moored off Curl Curl, back round flagship, then round Garden Island and back to flagship. Prize, value 60 guineas. Entrance, £3 3s. Xarifa. 31 tons. Dress — White. Colours — Ited and blue. Owner — C. Parbury .. .. ..1 Poii. 17 tons. Dross — White. Colours — Blue and white star. Owner — H. C. Dongar . . ... 2 Julia. 10 tons. Dress — Blue. Colours — Dark Hue and red cross. Owner — R. C. Want. Tlie sailing qualities of the Xarifa and Peri are so well known, that the prize was booked as a gift to the former before slic started, and she fully sustained the confidence placed in her. No sooner had the starting gun fired than the Xarifa came out of the Cove, and ran up past the flagship in pplendid style. The Peri, too, was very much admired as she passed the ship, and many regrets were expressed that the pecu liarity of her build rendered it impossible for her spirited owner to have her lengthened. It is the opinion of many aquatic sportsmen of much experi .-nee, that a lengthening of eight feet by the stem would render the Peri the fastest, as she is now one of the prettiest, yachts in our waters. The Julia started, apparently, to make up the necessary number of competitors, but she did not attempt to go the course. The Xarifa and the Peri turned down the harbour in fine style, the former increasing her lead until lost to view by rounding Bradley's Head. During the afternoon the Xarifa was seen coming up the harbour with mainsail, gaff topsail, square sail, and square topsail exposed to the breeze — a steady strong north easter — and with such a press of canvas waB of course going through the water at great speed. Some sixteen minutes after wards the l'eri appeared, but she was too far astern to reap any advantage from the seven minutes allowed to lier for the difference of tonnage, and the race was brought to a termination without further incident, the Xarifa winning with ten minutes to spare. Eighth Race. — To start fit 12. All second-class yachts of twelve tons and under, centreboards ex cluded. Time for tonnage, half a minute to the ton. Yachts to rate at five tons. Course — From their own moorings in Farm Cove round boat off Goat Island, then round boat moored off Manly Beach, back round flagship, then round Shark Island and back to flag ship. First prize, 20 guineas ; second, § guineas. Entrance, £2 2s. Ida. 9 tons. Dress— Blue, with straw hats. Colours — Blue, with white star. Owner — J.J. Josephson 1 Australian. 6 tons. Dress — White and blue. Colours — 'White and blue, Owner — A. F. Smart . . 2 Why Not. 8 tons. Dress — Blue, with straw liats. Colour — Blue. Owner — J. Nichols. . , . ,dis. Gitana. 8 tons. Dress— Blue, with straw hats. Colours— Red and white. Owner — F. Jackson. This was a very pretty race from start to finish. Tlie yachts of both classes started together, and the course during the early part of the race was the same. Veiy little difference in the positions of the four yachts in this race was observed until they had rounded the boat off Goat Island, and were beating down the har bour, when Why Not had a decided lead, Ida eecond, Gitana third, and the Australian fourth. This order was maintained for a considerable distance, and then Ida gradually gained upon Why Not and passed her. As they came up before the wind towards the ship, Ida had a lead of several lengths, but no sooner was she round under the lee of the ship and had hauled her wind preparatory to beating down to Shark Island, than Why * Not ran close round the ship's stern, and endeavoured to take from the sails of the Ida what little wind they held by passing between her and the ship. There was not room for her to do tliis, and hence a foul ensued, the 'Why Not carrying away the Ida's cross trees and doing other damage. The umpire at once declared it a foul, and disqualified the Why Not. The latter, having got clear of tlie Ida, continued her course, and finally passed the ship first, Ida Becond, Australian third,' and Gitana fourth. The Gitana's position as last boat was attributable to the misfortune of carrying away her peak halyards when near Shark Island, 'early in the race. Ninth Usee. — To start at lialf past 12. Gentle men amateurs pulling a pair of oars in light skiffs. Course, same as No. 0. Prize, value £12 12s, Entrance, £1 Is. Elvira. Dress — Blue and scar ct. Colour — Union Jack. Pullers— A. Crook and H. Fitzhardinge .. 1 Snbrina. Dieee — Magenta and blue. Colours — Ma- genta and blue. Pullere — Q. and C. Deloitto . . 2 A long series of victories by the Deloittcs made thenl the favourites for this race, but they had not the ghost of a chance against Crook and Fitzhardinge. In a similar race at the Hunter's Hill regatta, the Deloittes pulled against the brothers Crook, when the latter were defeated with ease. It appeared, however, that Mr. J . Crook, who pulled the bow oar on that occasion, was too heavy for her, and hence his place was taken yesterday b3- Sir. Fitzhardinge — a lighter weight. The start was a very even one, and the race a very pretty one for some distance. Half way to Fort Denison the Deloittcs were leading by half a length ; but before reaching the island, Crook and Fitzhardinge recovered their lost ground, and took the lead. From this point the race was never in doubt, Crook and Fitzhardinge increasing their lead with every dip of their oars. Tenth Race. — To start at 1. Champion racc, open to all comers, pulling a pair of sculls in light skiff's. Course — From flagship round Goat Island, then round Fort Denison, and back to the flagship. Prize, £21. Entrance, £1 16. The Start. Drese — White with blue sash. Colours White. with bine star. Puller — Richard Green . . 1 Athlete. Dress— White. Colour— White. Puller— J. M'Leer ? 2 This race may veiy easily be described. The Cham pion went away with the lead, was never col lared, and won with the greatest ease— thus reversing the verdict of tlie late contest between the same men at the Woolloomooloo Bay regatta. Eleventh Race. — To start at 2. All bona fide sail ing skiffs, not exceeding twenty-two feet overall, or twenty inches deep. Course — From their own moor ings in Lavender Bay round Fort Denison, back round flagsliip, tlience round Shark Island, and back to flagship. No. fins, centreboards, or false keels allowed. First 'prize, £12 12s. ; second, £3 3s. Entrance, £1 Is. Phoenician. Dress — White. Colour — Light blue. Owner— G. Mulhall .. , . . . ..1 Rebecca. Dress — Blue caps. Colours — Red and blue. Owner— J.

Dress — White. Colour — Blue, with name. Owner— W. Buekland. Ethel. Dress — White, with scarlet caps. Colour — Scarlet, Owner— E. Webb. The Dart having proved herself a very fast boat by winning several recent races, she was regarded as the winner of this one. On this occasion, however, she was unfortunate, and had to be content with the empty honour of third place. After a ^ very pretty race, Phoenician was declared the winner, ana Rebecca second. Twelfth Race.— To start at 2. All open, boats, not exceeding twenty-two feet over all, under -canvas. Course— From their own moorings, in Lavender Bay round Fort DenisoD, back round flagship, thence round light vessel and Sow and Pigp, and back to- the flagship. First prize, £15 £5s. ; second, £5 5b.

Shortly after the ! : start Sibyl cut out the work, got a good start, and held it. Among the remainder several ohnngee took I placc in the couree of the race, the contest eventuating in Sibyl winning, with Laura second, and Thought tliird. . Thirteenth Racc. — To start at 2.

Donnolly. Hickey was the favourite for this race; tlie five men, however, were pretty cquallv matched, and the race from the start down to the l'ort was very good. Before they passed the ship on their way to Goat Island the race was virtually over, llickcy having 1 strong lead, Green second, Connor third, and M'Leer fourth. Thus the race continued to the finish, with the exception that M'Leer dropped out and Donnolly took liis place. Fifteenth Race. — To start at 3. All gentlemen amateurs pulling two pairs of sculls in light skiffs. Course, same as No. G. Prize, value £12 12s, Entrance, £1 Is. Elvira. Dress — Blue and scarlet. Colour — Union Jack. Pullers — A. Crook and H. Fitzhardinge. . . I Snbrina. Dress — Magenta and blue. Colours— Ma- genta and blue. Pullers — Q. and C. Deloitte. Tliis was a very good race from the start to a point about half-way to Fort Denison, when a foul toolc place, and shortly afterwards the Deloittcs gave up, tearing Crook and Fitzhardinge to pull over the course and claim the prize. Sixteenth Race. — To start at half- past 3. All amateurs that have never started in any race, pulling a pair of sculls, yi light skills. Course— Same as Ne. 1\. First piize, 18 8s. ; second, £3 3s. ; tliird, a pair of sculls, presented by Mr. Mark Stephenson. Entrance, £l Is. Swan. Dress — White, with blue cap. Colours— Blue and white. Puller — T.

Dress — Violet and white. Colours — Violet and white. Puller — A. Venables. This event excited but little interest from the fact that the pullers were for the most part unknown. The race was an easy victorv for Colebrook. Seventeenth ilaee. — To start at four. All amateurs pulling two pairs of sculls, in light skills. Course Same as No. 6. First prize, £12 12 ; second, £3 3s. Entrance, £1 Is. Athlete. Dress— White. Colour— White. Pullere— J. M'Leer and J. Bookor .. „ ..1 Star cf Austrah'a. Dress — White. Colours— Blue and white.

The gig was a long unweildy boat, quite unfit for the purpose to wliich she was here applied, and the pro bability- is that the dingy with ordinary smartness would 'have kept out of her way fifteen hours instead of fifteen minutes. The dingy kept the gig at a respectful distance during the allotted time, and the | gun announced tliat the boy had won the prize. I Tliis brought the races to a termination, and the I company now began to leave the ship to return home- | waids. ? ?
