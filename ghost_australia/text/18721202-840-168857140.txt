ONLY A GHOST. By lEENinus tub Deacon. Chapter I. - WHY I CAME TO . IiONDON. I AJt a Ghost. Reader, don't bo alarmed, but nevertheless I repeat, I am a Ghost. -A ghost of 1520 years' standing ; for in tho year 347 I was still a deacon of the Ohuroh oftlio' Holy Cross, at Jerusalem, under tho Blessed Cyril, bishop of tho same. And why am I now 1 in London ? - Why havo I left tho holy shados and the company of blesBed spirits to glide . about this black and by no means saintly city? - Before I disappear into my peaceful abodol will place on record why I lott it, ana who induced mo to commit, bucIi an act of folly. On his release from the flesh and his appcaranco in tho world of spirits, tho Rev. Edward Starch, Rector of Grubbington-injtho-Olay, told me that if I' wished to see primitive Christianity sot forth as in the times when .1 lived, on earth, I had only to go to Great Britain and. listen to the performance of tho ' incomparublo liturgy' thoro usod. ; Of course, as a faithful though unworthy deacon of St. Cyril's Church, I took. a grave und sympathising, interest in all tho holy Churches over the world at all times, and in all countries ; and though I should havo , preferred visiting Jerusalem onoo more, or An tioeh, or Constantinople, I hoard tho spirit of tho Ancient Church was in England, and to England accordingly I went. In London I was told I should find tho true spirit of Primitive Christianity, for- many woro tho epithets of grace liltlSilUll UJJUU IU. J. IIVUIU .U1I£IU-IIIA I.UIII.U UIIU most religious country in the world, and London the city of enlightenment. I heard that all itB inhabitants wore interested in the spread of tho Gospel, and that they considered themselves the most godly people on tho earth. So to London mcthought I would go, to find churches . like the Holy Cross, and bishops like ' St Cyril roigning over oneh. Now, as a ghost, of course I am invisible, but .:, when I wish for information I have tho power of investing myself with tho outward appear-, anco of an intelligent, stranger, und of assuming tho language of tho country in which I am sojourning. People who would naturally bo shy of a Greek-speaking ghost, might, have no objection to impnrt information to a quiet looking stranger dressed in black, and. indulging iu broken English. When no cossary; I : can immediately ? rosumo my invisibility. I need scarcely 'say that this when done suddenly,' and on the im pulse of tho moment, has been productive of much ombarrussmont to my earthly companions, but has relieved me sometimos from positions ' which' might have been slightly /disngreonblo. Ono day then, I found myself in the streets of London, amongst a hurrying crowd, all seemingly too busy to givo u poor ghost tho slightest pur ticlo of information. I ran up against nn elderly gentleman of mild and prepossess ing appearance, whoso .hat I knocked off quito by accident; 'I bo? your pardon, sir,' said I,' returning it to him, 'I am a stranger hero, could you' give me any information on the state of religion in London ?' Religion! you sJiould have soen his face, ho started nt tho word as if ho had been shot. (They didn't shoot in my day, but I heard of such things afterwards.) I was surprised at tho effect the mere pronouncing of the word had in 'the most religious city in the world.' Ho turned and walked with mo up tho street. If ho hud only had tho remotest idea that I was the deacon Ironrousof Jerusalem in the 4lh : century ho would, I feel pcrsuuded, have Hod as fast us his legs would carry him. But he thought I wns only un Intelligent Stranger, and so ho put his arm through mine and walked on. Ho seemed to bo a confiding sort of person, and somehow or other I have always remarked that I possessor a supernatural power for fasci nation, which drew out Iho hearts and brains of thoso I mot with. ' I am a stranger here,' I again said j ' could you give 1110 any information on Iho state of religion in Knjjlund ?' ' Religion,' said my stout friend ; ' humph ! , what's your line ?' 'Line?' what could ho mean ? ' I don't exactly understand your method of expressing yourself,' I replied. ' Eh ? I moan what sort do you affect ?' 'Affect?' said I, 'I did not know religion was a mailer of afl'uctatiou. In my day it was a very real thing, and often cost a man his lifo.' ' Ah, poor things, ovorwork I suppose ; should learn to luke it easy, no use killing oneself for an idea.' 'Idea?' more incomprehensible' still. 'But you huvo not answered my question ubout religion ? ' ' Religion ?' repliod my friond ; ' Ah, y'03 to to sure. Which do you prefer?' ' .' Wltichl' said I in umazoment ; ' why tho Chris! mu religion to bo sure.' - ' Yes, but thoro are such a lot of them,' ro plied my friond. ' High und Low, and Pusoyito nnd Ritualist, nnd Papist and Baptist, and Wes leyini and Methodist, and Calvinist and Indo pendent, und Bible Christians and . . .' ' Stop, stop,' replied I, ' you puzzle me moro than ever; who may you be? are you a deacon ?' hoping I might fiud a kindred spirit iu my new acquaintance. ' My name's Boodlo ; and as to being a Deacon, I'd us soon bo a chimney sweep.' I was astonished. To upeak thus of an ofllco I hud always looked upon us ono of tho chiol'est honours Iho Christian Church' hail to bestow. As for invself, I hud never considered myself worthy to fill it, but hud beon porsuadnd into accepting it by the blessed Cyril himself.- Ho vainly tried to ordain me priest, but I con sidered mysolf too highly honoured already, und nothing would iuduco me to accept thai awful dignity. . For a moment I forgot I wns a ghostV ' I was a doncon onco,' I Buid, 'tho doncori Ironm ...' I stopped in time, 'ono of seven belonging to the Church of Holy Cross, and ? .
