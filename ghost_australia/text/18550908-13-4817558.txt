The loss in the attack of the accounts mentioned in Gcnci in Pelissier's despatch is very serious, and among those hors de combat are said to be a general officer and two colonels. The number is not yet known. An affair of such magnitude as the capturing of fifty-two guns must necessarily be attended with couÂ« siderable loss. The Mamelon Vert, which has just been taken by the French, is to the east, in front of the Malakhoff Tower, or, more properly speaking, of the huge Malakhoff Battery. It commands the CaiceningPoit, the military buildings belonging to it, and the communication by which the garrison of Sebastopol is constantly receiving reinforcements from the army outside. The occupation of this Mamelon, moreover, deprives the Mu Ittkhoir Tower of the support which it received on the eastern side, and which considerably annoyed the French works. The capture of this position, in which the French have established themselves, cannot fail to have very immediate consequences on the fate of the great Malakhoff Battery, on which, in the opinion of military men, the destiny of all the heathen part of Sebastopol depends. The post which the English time taken possession of, and in which they have established themselves, is nobody clearly indicated on the maps of the place; but, in looking at the plans in relief, it will be been that it is nearly on the same line as the Mamelon Vert. The occupation of it will, therefore, permit the English to combine with the French in an attack on the great Malakhoff Battery, the fall of which is now considered as not far distant.
