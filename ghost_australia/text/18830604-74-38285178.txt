MOTHS. TO TIIE EDITOfL SIR,--fr. Wintlo in his interesting article headed " Moths," which appeared in the Ex. s?tlncr som0 time since, oxproessed an opinion that the moths about whom he vrites wore nearly identical with the well-known moth Oik'cticus sandersif. Now, from the description given of thlli moth by Mr. WVintlo a short distance further down, I (liko "Entomologist") would imagine that it belongs to the genus lflriall*dce, of which a type is the ghost moth (Ilepial?s kunmuli). But" Entomologist" com mits an error in stating that the larve of this moth live under the groundl and feed on the roots of vagetables. They do indeed live under the around, but in the roots of vegetables upon wrhich they feed, asd are consequently very dillicult to observe. The wattle moth men tioned hy " Entomologist '" a little furthor down belongs to the allied genus Cossus, andl is called the wood boring moth (Oossus lioui. perela). It is the grub of this moth whicl is eaten, and whlich discharges a liquid which is believed to soften the wood into whllolh it maken its galleries. The moth itself is of a brownish colour, and has greyish wings streaked with block, while tile grub is of a eoddlshll colour, and from tilhe description given of tile moth seen by Mir. W. in his own letter, I should fancy it was closely allied to this ono.-Yours, etc., AOTIolen EaTroocOLOeIw. Launcoston, Juneo 1. P.S.--Mr. W.'s interesting article headed "iMoths" was read with interest by many, and his next communication is eagerly looked for.
