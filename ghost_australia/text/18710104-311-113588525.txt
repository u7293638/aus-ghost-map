MAORI WIFE TAMING. A Maori woman, the wife of the chief Thompson, eloped a short time ago with a Hau-hau. Kitty and her favored lover had travelled as far as Kakamatua, and had been there some weeks when they were discovered by some of Thompson's friends who had been in chase. The Hau-hau, who seems to have tired of the lady, quietly acquiesced in the wishes of the pursuers, who proceeded to tie her with a stout rope, and brought her back to Waitakere, taking three days to do the journey. Kitty, who stoutly resisted, was sadly damaged, and presented rather a melan choly picture on arrival, her treatment by her captors not being such as would meet with the approval of the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. Thompson was de lighted at her return, but Kitty, with many expressions of hatred, refused to have any thing more to do with him, saying he was only the ghost of a man. He retorted by calling her a devil of a woman, and proceeded to exercise his martial authority by giving her a sound thrashing, answering the expos tulations of a pakeha by saying he did it out of pure love and affection. Since then she has been a close prisoner, the monotony of her existence being only relieved by the applica tion at short intervals, of a decent-sized tea tree stick. At night, to prevent her escape, she is securely fastened with rope, and pre sents an appearance more resembling a well trussed chicken than a pretty Maori girl. Her objection to Thompson on the ground that he was only the ghost of a man, was not out of place, as the old fellow is worn to a shadow ; and it is about even betting which event comes off firs— the death of the old man from grief, or that of the woman from the severity of the measures taken by him to retrain her affec tions. —Southern Cross.
