A FOOLISH FREAK. TO THE EDITOR. sra,â€”Alter leaving the Mechanics' this evening, for home, I was surprised to see what appeared, and proved, to be a human figure, clothed with a white sheet, stand ing on the steps of the waiting-room belonging to the old railway station. Annoyed that a person could be so wickedly foolish as to endeavor to frighten pedestrians in this way, I remonstrated with the " apparition," which very quickly and noiselessly vanished through the doorway. After a short interval the party again came towards the steps, but, seemingly afraid of being recognised, shut the door. A peal of laughter, which could only come from female voices, was simultaneously heard. As a light was burning in the adjoining room at the time, the persons occupying that apart ment evidently had a hand in the matter. As a repetition of this might cause persons having weak nerves to be seriously alarmed, would it not be well for a con stable in plain clothes to be stationed at some convenient spot to detect the 6 ghost. - -I am, etc., war. k.
