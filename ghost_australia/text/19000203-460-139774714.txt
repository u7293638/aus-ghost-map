BOWLS. THE CHAMPIONSHIP. By R1NKF.R. In the rirtwrial JTnlwt is given a portrait of Mr. Jan*- 1" ' ! who last Saturday. on the I -.'r? preen, won the jMnpU-liamk-d Clumps" ship (or the second time. The Sinrle-handed Championship of the Vic torian Bowline Association for the season 1900 l Bovr decided, and James Pullar. of camKn d , Las achieved the distinction of winning the 1 t* miership for the second time. It is a long to go through, and it takes a player of the first magnitude to successfully go through to the fimsb. When llie SO entries were received and draw made, I must say I had a great fancv for Harold Ward's fiance, and thought that' Pullar, G. B. Gordon. E. Waugh, J. Spiers. C <J. llevward, W. Kield, L. Waxmati. Reg. Thompson,* J. Bciitley, 1\ llardbam, and ^ *v ; Einis would all occupy a forward position. Scim. ef these did do well, but others dropped out v,r. cailv in the tourney.

Harold Ward agsdnaiowed his superiority, and left off a winner by six points. THE FINAL GAME. After a short interval, J. Pullar and Harold Van] started the .final game. Pullar was the Jjret to score, and four ends showed that Ward bad made four and Pullar a couple. Pullar now was aggressive, and won four ends, making 2, 2, and - two singles. Harold equalised matters by lyiriiig- fire points,-the scores being-Ward,'9;; Pullsr, S. ~ PuUar now 'distinguished himself by i ecoringa fourer, followed by three, and .then,* single, or eight in three ends. Pullar was well placed in the next bead to score again, when Ward, with one of his. fauotas drives, made a! "dead -end'.' of it. This success of Ward's altered. matters considerably, *s in tbe' next end be se- i cored three in one lot, taking bis score to 12.1 At tbe eighteenth end Pullar was 19 to Ward's IS. ] Ward eecured tbree ends, adding four, snd taking j Us score to 17.
