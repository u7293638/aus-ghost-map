Women's Sense of Humour. I think it is an undeniable fact that women do not possess so strong a sense of humour as men do. No doubt wonieu are quick, very quick in many ways ; thus while man may be reasoning out some matter or other, womau, scorning such slow procedure, gives free rein to her instinct (a clear sign of au inferior intellect), and overleaping all premises lands at once ou a conclusion. To her credit be it said, however, that her quick instinctive conclusion is very often as correct as man's more slowly thought-out one. It is, therefore, all the more surprising that her innate quickness should fad woman when it comes to the perception of a joke. I remember ouce hinting to a lady that the fair sex were a little obtuse in this way. Of course she scouted the idea, and scornfully said that if ever they showed obtuseness it would be simply because the so-called joke was very thin ? only the ghost of a joke in fact.
