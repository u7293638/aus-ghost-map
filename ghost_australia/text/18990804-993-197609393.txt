HOUSEHOLD SUFFRAGE. According to the Register, Mr Foster, M.P., has been busily engaged in an attempt to win the Council over to a compromise on the Household Suffrage question and that gentleman on Thursday last made an impassioned appeal to Legislative Councillors to draw the two Houses into closer contact. The best authorities in political circles declare that there is not the ghost ot a chance to pasB the Suffrage Bill as it stands in the Council and the Conservatives of tbe reasonable type both inside and outside of Parliament bave no objection to the suggested Â£15 franchise. The late Hon. Dr. Campbell when last before the Northern electors advocated the Household as a reasonable basis. But what is the good attempting the impossible, and Mr Kingston would advance his cause by a conciliatory spirit. The country party in the House ought to be in a positon to know what the country desires and those gentleman appear to be very definite in their desire to effect a compromise.
