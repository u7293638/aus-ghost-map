THEATRE ROYAL. On Saturday evening " Macbeth" was played at the Royal to a good house. Mr. Carey making stay creditable appearance as the regicide [?] of Cawdor. In delivery he was especially effeottve, aad a large portion ef the enjoyment cf tte play sras owing to bis admirable con ception of the character and exoellent rendering of tiie text. Mr. Osrey has much 1b his favor in a part like ttia. Of a somewhat im posing atstnie aad an imprewive maaaar, he possesses also a vaaoe dear, flexible and in pettsut oomssaad, ao that in even its whbpering* he as heard distinctly ta tte farthest earner cf tte hnnap. In acting, toa, be was always effective aad generally ap propriate Borate orithton might wish to prune off a few exnbetanoes ef style, bat Wee it altogether tte Macbeth of Saturday night wasa fiwfwiiMsm ef essadteahle aerit, aod cspaUe of being matured into something of still higher oxoeQeace.

Mr. HoDoway made a very fair Mandnff, aad, as wdl as tte great usurper, waa honored with a call before tiie curtain at tte close of tte performance. Mr. West played Banquo wall, both ia tho flesh and aa a ghost. Mr. lawless, as Lennox, prattled his portion of tim text without aay apparent conscious ness of the msealng. Miss Ansteed represented Malcolm, aad was at times telling ia delivery, thoogh ahe naturally enough failed to give a sufficiently masculine tone^to the young Prince's spooriiand.dMneanor.

Trhe weird sisters srere sometimes matt at fault in the text, and endeavored now and then to conceal this defect by an indistinct utterance. Some of tiie choruses were good, and tte aoenery in the later meetings of Mac beth witt tte witohes was much Â«^"(nwl. To night " Mammon" will be played.
