A lil//e Hero. As an illustration of the pathetic ho:rors of the great life battle of the nineteenth century it would be difficult to find anything more graphic than a case of juvenile suicide recently reported from Dublin, A well- to-do man with a wife .and four young children went under in the crush of business never to rise again. He ended his despair by ending his life, leaving his widow and family desti tute. The eldest boy, az years old, attempted to take up the fight for bread on behalf of the rest, in which his father bad been worsted, but without success. Then be determined to offer his own life as their ransom from starvation. Here is how the simple-minded little martyr went about it. Mustering up all the money be could, he expended it in articles which are sold along with accident assurance coupons, and with these in his pocket he deliberately drowned himself, leaving the following letter -Dear Mothier,: I spent the four and sixpence half-penny for your benefit, and hope the money it will bring you will help you to for give my rash act. Tell the police to search in the bharbour at Portobello, and when they have found me get them to write a descrip tion of my clothes and what I have in my pockets. They will find a cap that cost 6d and will entitle you to azoo insurance money; pair of suspenders 4Yd, with a coupon on them for .3oo ; a belt, 6d, for Â£Ioo; and papers, one entitling you to Lrooo, and the others to jj5oo each in all A,53,oo. Don't spend too much on my funelal, and mind the money, which will make you ich--Your loving son, Ferdinand De Freyne Rienzi De Courcy. P. S. Good-bye." He did not know that bhis invalidated the insurance policies, and rendered his martyrdom a vain sacrifice to a releatless fate. P. S,-Good bye, Ferdinand, and may your poor little ghost, wherever it may be, never find this out.
