GOULBURN DIOCESAN SYNOD. ADDRESS BY BISHOP CHALMERS. THE RITUALISTIC! CONTROVERSY. A PLEA FOR TOLERATION. GOULBURN, Monday. The first session of the tenth Synod of the Diocese of Goulburn, Church of England, was opened this afternoon, under the presidency of Bishop Chalmers The Bishop delivered an opening address Referring to the war in South Africa, our troops, he said, were fighting side by side with those of the mother country against what we believed to be a crafty and well, planned attempt to oust British rule from South Africa The Church of England population in the diocese in 1691 was again His impression was that there had since been no considerable increase since 1892 the number of clergy had increased by three There were now 131 churches and school churches and 76 public buildings in which divine service was held, and 101 private houses were used for public worship There were in the diocese 34 parsonages 14 schoolhouses and church halls, and in glebe For the 12 months ending last Easter the number of communicants was 1996 . Accommodation was provided in church buildings for 12,242 adults, and there was an average attendance of 11,022 there were 92 Sunday schools with 6120 scholars There were 419 public schools in the 3d parishes of the diocese, and instruction was given by the clergy in 144 public and nine private schools The public school system was to be justly commended for the facilities it afforded for giving religious instruction by ministers and other authorised persons, yet it must be can fessed it largely failed to accomplish the end in view It was a painful thought that large numbers of their children, particularly in the more remote districts where Sunday serious were an impossibility, were growing up with the scantiest knowledge of Christian truth The yearly income of the diocese for the maintenance of the clergy and public worship was £12,8 the signs of the progress that had been made, 16 new churches had been built during the but seven years, also three < burch halls In the same period 5024 persons had received the rite of confirmation During his last visitation of the diocese 1614 perious presented themselves for confirmation, (104 of whom were males The cathedral debt had been reduced by £l96b At the end of last year it stood at 1772 He would suggest that an effort be made by the whole diocese to remove it altogether during the year One family had promised the last thousand of the amount required for this purpose Next session he hoped to be able to announce that the original capital of the Church Society had been nearly doubted The corrupt us literature with which the world teemed, and the popularity it had attained, was a manifest proof that the struggle for Christian purity was to be one of the greatest struggles of our day Referring to diocesan changes, he wished to say that the Rev. P A 1 horns, B A , of Adelaide, would take up the Rev J Glover's work in the cathedral parish, Mr Glover having resigned The recent agitations in the Church seemed to have abated in England The war had turned men's minds to graver issues than disputed points of ceremonial Why should disputes on each questions arise at all Because within the pale of the Church of England ever since the Reformation of the sixteenth century there had been two divergent schools of thought those whose sympathies he would call catholic and those whose sympathies he would call puritan By ' catholic " he did not mean Roman, but that which is primitive, that which the ancient, undivided Church believed and practised By " puritan " he meant that system of religious ideas which came into prominence at the Ref formation and had heldiMplaceevar since in Christian!! thought Attached more or less closely to each of these breed sections was a band of extremists whose loyalty to the Church as c instituted under the Re for mill ion settlement was somewhat open to question One of these birds that was most in touch with the Catholic side had introduced into public worship certain observances sold to be distinctively Roman they had been opposed with great bitterness by extremists on the other side, and the great central body of churchmen on either side his awoke to the sense that unauthorised predicts und Roraeward tendencies should be firmly checked The English episcopate had taken the matter in hand with good effect A few reconcile. ables still set up their private judgment against lawful authority, but the major part of the extremists on the CHUIOUC side had submitted to the godly ad- monition of their bishops He had had some 40 years experience of the various types of churchmen, and he regarded it as simply ludicrous that any water formed man who was not blinded by prejudice should really believe that the Catholic side in the Church of England had any "secret" desire to make the Church Roman they might on occasions emphasise somewhat strongly those Catholic elements which were inherent in the Church's constitution but there they stopped The " Oxford movement, as it was called, may have made its mistakes and had its failures and may still have its excrescences but a movement which the overruling providence of God had made use of to chance the face of the Church of England, that had turned apathy nita earnestness, deadness into life, was at least worthy of men's respect, and should be secure from their suspicious levelling, whatever individual opinions might be as to the methods adopted by some few of its supporters He should regard himself as faithless to the Church's Divine Head if he failed to recognise the quickening power of the Holy Ghost working in it and through it as truly as in any of the spiritual revivals that had preceded it For himself, so long as he had reason to believe that a man was loyal to the Holy Scripture and the Prayer Book he had no desire, nor was it his duty, to pay too closely into that man's personal convictions on questions which were more or less open questions He had too clear a perception of the breadth and tolerance of the Church of England The Church of England wanted no cast-iron un . formerly of thought and devotion such as the Church of Rome sought to enforce under the guise of unity Nor did he think diversity of opinion on secondary matters to be in all cases evil Sometimes such ill. versities were a distinct advantage, and furnished the needed impulse to wholesome improvements If the evangelical " innovations " of one hundred years ago had not been repressed by the strong arm of authority the followers of John Wesley would probably never have separated from the Church Let the Church learn to be tolerant
