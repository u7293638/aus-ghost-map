How It Happened I pray you. pardon me. Elsie, And smile that frown away That dims the light of your lovely face As a thunder cloud the day. I really could not help It \- Before I thought. 'twas donse And those great grey eyes lashed bright and cold. Like an Icicle in the sun. I was thinking of the summers When we were boys and girls, And wandered in the blossoming woods. And the gay winds romped with your curls, And you seemed to me the same little girl I hissed In the alder path. I kissed the little girl's lips, and, alas! I have roused a woman', wrath. There is not so much to pardon- For why were your lips as red? The blonde hair fell in a shower of gold From the proud. provoking head. And the beauty that flashed from the splendid eyes. And played round the tender mouth, Rushed over my soul like a warm sweet wind That blows from the fragrant south. And where, after all, is the harm done? I believe we were made to be gay, And all of youth not given to love Is vainly squandered away. And strewn through life's low labors, Like gold in the desert sands. Are love's swift kisses and sighs and vows And the clasp of clinging hands. And when you are old and lonely. In Memory's magic shrine. You will see on your this and wasted hands, Like gems, these kiases of mine. And when you muse at evening At the sound of some vanished name, The ghost of my kisses shall touch your lips, And kindle your heart to nflame. -John IIay.
