P. R. which " is full of the tragic f locomotion which attaches to the struggle of a brave man, repeatedly warned of his coming death, struggling in vain to report the event which was to prove fatal, and ultimately perishing within the sight of those to whom he had revealed the vision " The story in brief is as follows " Mr. Fleet was third mate on the sailing ship Persian Empire, which left Adelaide for London in 1860 One of the crow, Cleary by name, dreamed before starting that on Christmas morning, as the Persian Empire was passing Cape Horn in 11 heavy gale he was ordered with the rest of his watch to secure a boat hanging in the davits over the side He and another got into the boat when a fearful sea broke over the ship, washing them both out of the boat into the sea, where they were both drowned. The dream made such an impression upon him that he was most reluctant to join the ship, but he ever came his scruples and sailed On Christmas Eve, when they were nearing Cape Horn, Cleary had a repetition of his dream, exact in till its particulars He uttered a terrible cry, and kept muttering, " I know it will come two ' On Christmas Day, exactly as he had foreseen, Cleary and the rest of the watch were ordered to secure a. boat hanging in the davits Cleary flatly refused He said he refused because he knew he would be drowned, that all the circumstances of his dream had come true up to that moment, and if he went into that boat he would die He was taken below to the captain and his refusal to discharge duty was entered in the log Then the chief officer, Douglas, took the pen to sign his name Cleary suddenly looked at him and exclaimed, I will go to my duty, for now I know the other man in my dream ' He told Douglas, as they went on deck, of his dream They got into the boat, and when they were all making tight a heavy sea struck the vessel with such force that the crew would have been washed overboard had they not clung to the mast. The boat was turned cer, and Douglas and Cleary were flung into the sea they swam for a little time and then went down. It was just three months after he had dreamed of it before lowing Adelaide "Here is another thrilling sailor story bearing on the subject of apparitions at the moment of death " A great gust of wind seized the half slackened maintopsail, and sent it fluttering into fragments At the same moment the ship heeled nearly on her beam ends, and above the howling of the gale, we heard a sudden cry of despair I was horrified to see an apprentice, J-- P-, sent whirling headlong from the masthead into the sea Even yet I can see the look of agony stamped on his upturned face, and I can hear the very tones of his heartrending cry, Oh ' Lucy Lucy, as he disappeared for ever in the darkness below " After the storm abated, the captain made a careful note of the exact time of the occurrence, the position of the ship, and the other particulars He seemed struck at my mention of the exclamation I had overheard falling from the poor fellow's lips as he clutched in vain at the yielding air "Ah," he said, that must have been his sister, Lucy V-, to whom he was greatly attached ' The rest of the voyage passed without incident, and as soon as the ship arrived at Liverpool I made my way to the train which was to take me to Manchester ' I was walking idly along the platform when I saw the face of an old gentleman, who, with a young lady on his arm, was elbowing his way through the crowd His resemblance to our lost mate was so striking that I stood and looked at him The young lady's eyes happened suddenly to meet mine Instantly she gave a violent start, uttered a low scream, and exclaiming -' Oh, look, there's the face of my dream ' ' stared at me as if fascinated Her companion gently called her, and half led, half earned her, to the nearest waiting-room As he passed he begged me to come with them and handed me his card " When w 0 wire along the old gentleman explained that the sight of my face had reminded his daughter of a very peculiar and unpleasant dream, to which she still persisted 111 attaching importance He said At the present moment, indeed, we are on our way to discover if the owners of my son's ship have received any news of its arrival.' " I said I am an apprentice of the Co., and have but lately left her lying in the harbour " ' Then,' the young lady cried, I must be right It must be true Twus that piano face I B iw gaping at him as he fell I saw Joo's ship in the midst of a fearful storm, and him clinging to the slippery Bhrouds A bright flash seemed to pass before my eyes, and I saw him falling backwards into the sea I saw your face in the momentary gleam, and I woke perfectly terrified to hear the sound of my own name-" O Lucy ' Lucy "' whispered in my ears " " The expression of my face must have conveyed but too well the meaning of my silence. " ' My God,' cried Mr e, ' is it true, then? Is he dead ? ' " I stammered-' Too true, sir ' Tos ' every word of it I was beside him at the moment, and even tried to save him On comparing notes, we found that the dream took place the very day, allowing for the difference in longitude, even the very hour when the accident occurred !" Here is a sample of the narratives repeated in good faith by the superstitious folk of the remote Shetlands - " One day, in 1836, a fisherman of the name of Grey found that when returning from fishing his boat stopped without any apparent cause. In vain he strained at the oars , it would not move a foot. He looked over the prow, thinking he might have got entangled in seaweed, but the water was clear He thought he might have struck on a biddon shoal, BO rocked the boat She rocked freely, showing there was water under her keel Grey then looked over the stern, and to his horror saw a man, whom he knew had been dead for six months, holding on to the stern post This man was one with whom he had some little quarrel, and Grey besought him to free the boat, saying that he had hoped that death would have cancelled all enmity between them Without replying, the man still hold on, and at last, in despair, Grey took his axe and hacked off the stem post, when the boat at once shot forward The man, however, cried out that Grey and he should meet again in six weeks Grey, in great four, hastened home and told his family and friends of the occurrence In Bit weeks, at the exact time the dead man had named, Grey was found in the morning dead in bed A Bon 01 Robert Gray, who saw the mutilated boat come in, was, at any rate, keeping a sailors' boardinghouse in Antwerp, but there are many in the Shetland Isles who well remember the circumstance, and seeing the boat with the stern post out off " Ghosts take many and various forms, and there are a few pretty terrifying ones in Mr Stead's collection There are diabolical floating faces and mutilated trunks There is a ghost which inflicted the company on an unhappy living fiend for a walk of some duration, wheat enlivened with a long and detailed account of its violent death, and with the spectacle of its body burning from within, outwards union seemed " There are aggressive ghosts which pull off one's bedclothes, or grapple with one in a confusion of material or immaterial There is even a ghost which attacked a railway porter at night accompanied by a ghostly dog, which actually bit the porter in the calf of his leg And there is one which strikes us as the only instance we have yet come across of a ' warm, soft and plump ' ghost-but the poor thing only consisted of a hand and arm But we will conclude with every creepy tale, which shows that a mutilated ghost does not always correspond with a mutilated corpse The apparition may fit itself out, it seems. with the very parts which are missing in the mortal remains, to say nothing of making its presence known by an energetic smack on the back - " About the middle of the first decade of this century, there lived in the little seaport town of Girvan, 111 South Ayrshire, a young man and his sister, they were warmly attached to each other My grandmother, from whom I heard their story, was intimately acquainted with the young woman. The brother followed the precarious and dangerous avoca- tion of the ashes, and our story begins with the loss of his life by the swamping of his boat in a storm. "For a week or two alabaster vaainconsolable her mond dwelt in imagination on the loved form of her brother tossed amongst the weeds and 000 on the bed of the ocean, the food, for fishes and the distant; plane for creeping things.

The corpse, which was much decomposed, had lost the right hand This mutilation made a deep and painful impression on the sister's mind ] " Ev or mill anon she would burst out into a fit of weeping, wringing her own hands, and bewailing the loss of her brother of hind. " This continued for about a week until one night, preparatory to going to bed, she had undressed, but before the had got into bed, overcome by the force of her emotions, she threw her face on the pillow and burst out wearing, and bemoaning the lost round, but scarcely had she done so we hear, with a cry of fear, she sprang from the lied. " her cries soon brought the other inmates of the house to her room, and when questioned she informed them that when she had thrown herself on the bed, she felt someone give her a slap on the kick, as if with the open hand, and that the place where ho was struck was still pricking from the offices of the blow, and put her hand over her shoulder to point out the place where she was struck.
