TELEGRAPHIC INTELLIGENCE. [From the Express.] VICTORIA. Melbourne December 15. (Received at Adelaide Dec. 16.) The gale continues. The Yarra is over its banks. The stores along Flinders- street and fronting river are all flooded. Two thousand (2,000) tons salt in the stores have been destroyed. Great efforts are making to remove the goods, and several firms are offering two pounds (Â£2) per hour for labour. The tide being low, it is expected that the flood will he stall greater, and that further de struction of property will be the result. The railway to (suburbs has ceased running ; and the approach to town down by Princess Bridge is interrupted. At St. -Tilda a house was utterly destroyed. Up the country serious damage has been occasioned to orchards and crops. At Sydney the gale is equally violent, and there is much anticipation of disasters at sea. An eleven have been chosen to play Victoria. The agent for Professor Pepper's Ghost has arrived in Melbourne. The Essex broke away from her moorings, and rim stern on to the Alhambra, which received much injury. The Harbor Master Bays the flood will rise three or four feet yet. He could not land the mails if the steamer was in.
