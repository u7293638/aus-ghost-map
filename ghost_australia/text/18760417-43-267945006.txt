i A SUPERNATURAL VISITATION. ! : rite- . ! hamilton spectator. j A, considerable sensation prevails in the ; neighborhood of Ylacarthur owing to -Ft: j nocturnal presence of ah apparition, which has been â€žsgen by several persons on the es- tate of Mr. Carmichael, at xtarfcoii Hills It appears that four men, working at a job of fencing, were camped about two miles from the head station, when they were alarmed seme three or four nights ago In- seeing a figure draped in while, stalking backwards and forwards in the moonlight" So frightened were they, that they beat a retreat to the station, and communicated the particulars to Ylr. Towart, the overseer, whilst a dog they had with them participated in the alarm, and ran away howling piteously. Next night a party of eight in cluding a policeman from the township, bivouacked in the haunted spot, and five of them were rewarded by getting a sight of the ghost. The news began to spread, and we understand that last night a large party- was to be made up from .Ylacarthur, with a view to solve the mystery if possible. Tra dition states that the locality in question was, many yeai-s ago, the scene of a fatal affray between the early settlers and the aboriginals,, and that in these encounters the blacks came off second best. Of course the supposition is that one of the natives so dis posed of has jumped up " whitefellow " in fulfilment of the aboriginal belief, and hence the astonishment of the nerves of the fencing party by his " counterfeit present ment !" It should be mentioned that the gliost has already one casualty to answer for, inasmuch as one of the interviewists, in his hurry to get a sight of the apparition, was thrown from his horse, and broke his leg. We trust some of those who may have been fortunate enough to have seen the thing, will send us a progress report.
