A VOICE FROM THE TOMB- To MR. G. P. SMITH, M.L.A. (Per favour of Melbourne Punch.) You, a barrister-at-law, a journalist, aud a literate person, to quarrel with the use of the word "advocation," as not belonging to the English language! I am surprised at you. Where were you educated 1 Not in gracious England, I dare engage my word. Neither from Scotland were you stolen ; but, perchance you had your schooling in Berwick at the north; and so the tongue you speak is neither this nor that, but just a rustic dialect. Else you would itnow that, when I wrote, the mother tongue had reached its highest stage of excellence, of strength, of sweetness, and of flexibility: and that "advocation" was then a standard word. Hence I wrote in a tragedy—which, perhaps, is still extant—called " Othello, the Moor of Venice":— '' Alas ! thrice gentle Cassio, My advocation is not now in tune ; My lord is not my lord : nor should I know him, Were he in favour, as in honour, altered."
