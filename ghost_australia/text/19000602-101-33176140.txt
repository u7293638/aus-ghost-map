WHISTLING BULLETS. In: a letter to the "Morning Post," Mr. Battersby says : -"Every man in the way of fire has his own likes and dis- likes. Some men always bob to a bul- let ; others catch theil* breath nt a shell ; othersxdread the patter of a Maxim, It is not a question of timidity or of dead- liness, but of personal antipathy. In- fantry fire is, beyond all question, most fatal, but many pay less he'd to the whispered whistle of the bullet than to any other of the flying forms of death. There is a bird out here, a little brown bird like a brambling, with a note that exactly, mimics the Mauser, and an un- comfortable habit of fluting it in ugly places. The Lee-Metford's note is nearly a third lower, and the Martini has the dull buzz of a laden bee. Be- tween the three there can be no mis- taking, but the Boers hav four or five other rifles harder to recognise. The Mauser's most melodious period is 1,800 yards ; point blank it is nothing but a nasty nasal sneer, but one may be a poor judge of melody at close quarter*. A fiat-nosed or 'dum-dumbed' Mauser pro- bably makes a sound which one attri- | butes to. some unknown rifle, but the queerest note of all comes from a Mauser spinning the wrong way after a ricochet. It is like the coughing of a sick ghost-indescribably curdling. The worst and best of bullet music is . that one always hears it behind one. .
