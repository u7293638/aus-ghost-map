Love's Giiost. Is Love at end ? How did he go ? His coming was full sweet, I know ; But when he went he slipped away And never mused to sav eood dav â€” How could the traitor leave me so? There's something in the Eurnmer, though, That brings the old time back, and, lo ! This phantom that would bar my way is dead Lovc'b ghost. His footfall is as soft as snow, And in his path the lilies blow ; He quenches the just-kindled ray With which I fain would light my way, And bids me newer joys iorjro, This tyrant ghost.
