GHESFORD. The country aftor tho recent rains looks splendid. We had on Tuesday a very heavy downpour, and since then slight shdwera. All aro jubilant nnd are looking forward to n good season. Our debating society has been resting for awhile. Soon wo shall be called upon to discuss a question as to the benefits of machinery, whioh promises to be moat interesting, Bub for tho present fcbu concert which is to take place on Wednesday is taking up all tbo spare timo. It promiaea fco be a splendid one. Thu cantata 'Tho Queen of the Seasons' will be pub on bhe stage, but; it will be considerably altered and improved. A vory pretty waltz has been introduced, and will provo very popular, and the costumes will be pretty and attrac tive. Tho farce is one that will tako with tho audience. The talent is local, but from what wo have seen in other places, wo feel sure, will compare favourably with evun professional. The songs will bo givon by ladiea and genbletuen residing -in bhe diatriab. Tliero will bo a good moon for viuifcors travelling homewards, and if bho weabher is anyway favour aoie wo anticipate a big houso. We have had a ghosb horo lately, It oamo with tho advent of tho bridge repairers, and since they have gone ifc alto haa disappeared. The ghoBt appeared in tho vicinity of tho bridgo near tho cemetery, and wos seen by many. But ib so frightened two or throo young men that thoy ono night loaded a gun and fired j whether they had a good ohargo or woro too nervous to shoot straight wo do not know, but the ghoBt cleared away ' afber making a hideous noiso. Perhaps, hn thoughb thab ifc waa n risky thing, but, apparently, tho shooting wob aucoesBful for the ghost haB boon no more Been. The bridges ovor the Paterson and Allyn havo been repaired ; evidently not muoh beforo tho ropaira wero wanted. Oue now feels safe in riding across them.
