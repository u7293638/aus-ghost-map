' 'Will1 J he grew ? jm flHnlf patient, and arose ' Tfjjl to Question a female who had opened a side door and was walking across the room. His surprise, however, was great when he noticed her manner and garb. She was dressed in rich attire, but in. an absolutely out-oi-date costume, and wrung her hands in a pititul manner — her face etmcing signs ot great distress. Sue walked to the flight of oak stairs, and, quickening her p*ce, disappeared. At that mo ment the steward entered the room and announced that his wife was ready to see him. Dr. Farquhar found his patient dangerously ill, and he was so much engrossed with the case that he forgot, ere he letc the building, to question the steward as to the youn? lady in the curious dress he had seen. On the following day he found his patient much improved, -and remembered to ask the steward about the mysterious \ oung lady. As the Doctor recounted his experience the poor fellow showed unmistakable signs of fear and trembling, and told the Doctor that now he was sure hi a wife would soon die, as tbe spectre was the . spirii of the daughter of an early owner of tee castle who had murdered .her child, and had since appeared as an omen fortelling tne death of an inmate. Dr. Furquhar quickly gave the steward every assurance of his wite's tarn tor the better, an I that he thought she would con tinue to improve, but the cradulous old steward would not hear ot it. - ihe next day the Doctor called at tha Castle, aud was astounded to find that his patient had died soon after he left the place the preceding day. 1'he most etrang« part of the story is to come. After an interval of several years, Dr. Farquhar was well known in London as Sir Walter Farquhar (1796), and could count among his clients and friends certain members of nobility and royalty. One day a lady came io hitu in great distress, ea\ ing her sister was ill, and appeared to be wasting away, j and that on being questioned she was most em- j phi tic in saying she saw a ghost when visiting in Devonshire some weeks before, which had left such an ioipreBsion upon her, that do what she ! would she could no$ shake it off. The lady iurtiier s-id thht the sp ctre appeared at oerry fomeroy Castle, at- wnich tiir Waher started, told his experiences, and requested to see the young lady immediately, whom he found suffering as described. The poor girl appeared greatly relieved to b? speaking to ' some one who shared her unco ml ortable experience, and, it may be adued, soon regained her usual health. \- Sjkes Lumb Farm, near Blackburn, Lanca shire, has a well-known reputation tor being haunted'.

Several parties have asserted that they have seen an old wrinkled woman pass along the xbad which led to the Lumb, but were so afraid that they never dared to question her.
