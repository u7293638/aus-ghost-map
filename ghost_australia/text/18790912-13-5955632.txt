the knovvkJgo we now possess of its disastrous termination Some of tho London journals, bettor nifoimed than their contemporaries with respect to the ferocious character and treacheious tactics of the Afghans, predicted with singular accuracy what has actually happened They prognosticated the murdei of Majoi Ca\a<\\\iu, the pos sible massacre of his companions, ind a general insurrection of the people against Eui opean interference But when the safe arrival of the British envoy in the \m I it's palace was re portea by electnc telegraph, great was the exultation of those who had dcndcd the x)rophets of evil "Asa military " and diplomatic tnumpli, ' said the Morning Post of the 29th of July, " nothing could be more complete than " the entiy of Major CwAfNAKi into " Cabul, and if its brilliancy is at all " man ed it is solely by the reflection " that it should have been necessary to " have recourse to war m ordei to bring " it about ' And the journal ridiculed a statement made a few days pre viously, that 1 vkood Kn w s sub mission to the English had cieated much anger among the Afghan Irrecon cilables, and declared that then recep tion of hundas an evidence of "then " desire to show to the gallant Majoi " that no vindictiveness was entertained " towards him and his attendants ' Unhappily, as we have now mournful reason to know, the Indian Govern ment has been beguiled into a repetí tion of the fatal confidence placed on former occasions in the sincerity and honesty of the Afghan character, and the íesult has been a tragical calamity, which will have to be retriev ed at the coot of another " little war " Against their better judgment, w e be heve, and in deference to the penny w ise and pound foolish criticisms and lemonstrances of the Opposition in the House of Commons, Lord Lvtton and the Supreme Council of India withdrew the troops from Afghanistan before order had been thoroughly re established , and dneclly the restraining influence of a stiong mihtaiv fotce was íemoved, and an opportunity presented itself of striking a vindictive blow at the British in the person of our envoy, it v\as taken advantage of with characteristic craft, treachery, and ferocity by the Afghans That there will be swift and teruble retribution v\ e may be certain , but this will not restore the dead, to lifo, nor lessen the poignant regret which must be felt that no attention should have been paid to the warnings publicly given m England, and possibly in India also, against so hazardous an enterpilao as that of a peaceful mission to "A town of war Yet wild, the people s hearts brimful of fear Next to the affair» of Afghanistan, those of Germany aie entitled to a place among the most remarkable events of the month Prince BisMvrck, having made his peace with the Ultramon tanes and carried his tariff, closed the fusion of the Reichstag with a speech marked by that cj meal bluntness which he is accustomed to exhibit m his more triumphant moods He told the Legislature of the Empire that he would not shrink from dicta toual absolutism if he considered it to be necessary for maintaining the national unity, and he treated the Liberals, fiom whom he has completely severed him self, with scarcely disguised scorn He haß earned the point for which he con tended in the narrower arena of tho Prussian Chamber of Deputies between 18G2 and 18G5, and he is now master of the national finances Out of the proceeds of the customs duties and the taxes on articles of general consumption, 130,000,000 marks, or nearly £7,000,000 sterling, are to be paid into the Imperial treasury, while the overplus is to bo divided among the states in proportion to then population The army is to be in ci eased to the extent of 30,000 men, and as one of the leading journals of Vienna puts it, " a forest of bayonets "will foi m the iron enclosure within " which the Cernían people will crowd " together like a flightened (lock ot " sheep " Protection thus becomes the ally of despotism, as it was in Trance, under the rule of Loais XIV, and the Prince must 1 lugh in his sleeve at the credulity of his new allies, the Tones of Germany, in believing that a tariff, which is ex pected to pour so many millions into the state coffers, can by any possibility be piotective, for the object of protec tion is, of course, to exclude or to mate nally diminish tho importation of foreign manufactures and agricultural produce, whereas Prince Bivmuick's confident expectations of a large re venue from imports clearly denotes his own entire disbelief m the protective operation of the new duties He mast be equally amused by the stupidity of the large majority-one hundred- of the representatives of the people m the German Eeichstag who voted for the third leading of the Tauff Bill, many of them being undei the impres sion that it would confer a substantial benefit on " native industry " In reality, however, the only industry which is likely to derive any advantage from it ia that which is engaged in manufactunng arms of precision, heavy artillery, munitions of war, and army and navy clothing Upon the gieat mass of the people tho additional taxation will press with cruel force, and will augment that bitter discontent which finds expression in the destructive doctnnes of the Socialists Theso agita tors are to be put down, it seems, with a finn and ruthless hand, but the sue cess, or rather failure, of a similai policy pursued towards tho Nihilists bj tho Russian Government is tho reverse of encouraging to tho man of blood and iron m Germany, The master of the nation, to quote the words of tho Satui day Review, "has worked hard and " has done great things Ile has shut oil " Germany commeicially from tho outei " world , ho has secured a large increase " in his enormous army , and he has " killed, or almost killed, the feeble " parliamentary life of his country ' But is this all 5 It it not possible that ho is also laboriously, though neon f-ciously, pavmg tho way for that great socnl convulsion in Germany which Hi im ich Hum , moro than forty years ago, predicted would inevitably take place lftei the reconstitution of the Geimmic Empire, which ho also prophesielf That cataclysm, ho said, would be brought about to a great ex tent by the influence on the public mind of the philosophers, thinkers, and communists of Gerin my, the last he considered as being the most îedoubt able of all " These thiee chons, ho wrote, "will intone a revolutionary * hvmn, which will make the eirtk " tremble, and there will bo enacted m " the 1 atherland a drama, c jmparod "with which the liench Revolution " will appear to have been only an " idyll If it should not be precipi tated by the action of Prince Bismakck, historical analogies must be altogether misleading The debato on the Rcfoini Bill yes terday w is distinguished, if not en livened, by tho fust parliamentary deliverance of Tiofessoi Pluison after his return fioni England The ex ambassadors speech will bo read, wo imagine, with some interest and not a little astonishment It seems as though the visit and the experiences connected with it have wrou0ht a consideiablo change in the lion member In listening to his somewhat halting sentences and contradictory arguments hearers must have found themselves wondering whether the very mddgontlo man before them could bo the burning and shining li0ht of "liberalism who not long ago cut himself adiift from the f i einatme, delights of tuition in ordei to cast in his lot with the fiery jatnots who had determined to save the countiy at so much a month, lor oui own pait, we must confass an inability to follow tho learned professor As far as w o can make out, ho is delighted to find that the Govern ment has carried concession so fai as to modify the exact " counterpart of the " Buti'-h Constitution it submitted last session At the same time he is free to confess that he was not alto gethei satisfied witL the measure he and his ambacsadonal colleague forgot to take home, and that he likes the present scheme still less The only thing that really pleases him is the plebiscite, and as long as this is retained he is prepared to considei himself tolerably hai P3 ft ls *rac that ho went out of his way to quote one or two instances in which it had proved an utter failure, but we suppose that this ls his peculiar method of enjoying himself As to the proposal to constitute a nominee Council, his remarks, although enter taming, were scarcely definite enough to be of much practical utility Last session he expressed himself m favour of an elective second chamber and lie " does not know '' that he îiaâ altered his opinion But while con tmumg to hold that an elective basis for tho Upper House w as the correct thing, he proceeded to show clearly that the double representation which it provided is an absurdity, and the cause of many troubles He then w ent on to expl un that, while believing m the îoire sentativo principle, ho was glad the Ministry had determined to deposo it m favour of nomineeism, although he saw clearly that any attempt to get to gether a decent rommec body in the manner nroposed must prove a com plete and disastrous failure It will be seen that these ideas are a little mixe 1, but theiein, we imagine, they do but resemble tho mind from winch they emanated V\ e feai that the lion gen tleman s visit to the mother countiy lm thoroughly conupted those thorou0k going " hbeial pnnciples with vhick he set out upon his jouiney In strong contrast to the Professors ti sue of contradictions was the straight forward, logical speech of the hon member for Rodney Wo do not think we evei heard Mi G illili to greater advantage During the two houis he occupied the flooi, he fanly rivetted tho lttention of the House, and it was evident that his sledgehammer blows cieated something lil e consteination on the Treasury bench Our space will not pennit us to do anything like justice to the many telling points which the lion gentleman made We would ask our readers to study the deliverance for themselves, as it gives in a convenient form most of the aigu ments adducible aDainst the Ministeual measure V\ e would di aw paiticular attention to tho remarks in which the utter incompatibility of tho jlcbisale with our form of constitutional and lesponsible government is forcibly shown and happily illustrated V hen drawing to a conclusion Mi Gili its read extracts from memoranda prepaied, or at least siDned, by Mr BLrRY on behalf of his Government, m which i willing ness is expressed to negotiate with the Council on the basis of certain mutual concessions which, m the opinion of the Opposition, would now lead to a satisfactory settlement Why, asks the hon member, if the Govern ment is really desirous of bringing tins matter to a conclusion, was not its pre sent bill framed in a way calculated to bring about the compromise which, its leader has stated, would be acceptable Í This is a query which the House would like to have answered, and one, wo feel sure, that the country will not allow to be ignoied Looking at tho debate as fai as it has gone, wo seo that when Mr Binny inferentially piedicted that lion members would find it difficult to say much worth listening to con cei nmg a measure which every ono knows is a bogus affair that can settle nothing, he proved himsolf for once a true piophet The thought that they are simply engaged m shamming lo be busy over important business has acted as a paralysing influence on brain and tongue alike bo utterly im possible have most speakers found it to impart anything like a lively interest to then deliverances that tuo slightest appioach to originality °c .earnestness has been sufficient to create somotliing like a sensation Mr John Duffy was a perfect godsend on one «vening Further on, the bon member for 'Warrnambool succeeded in attract ing attention and eliciting i cheer Towards the conclusion of his speech on Tuesday, Mr Powers gave somo general indications of tho direction m tullich he thought reform should move "jsonerally speaking, the hon gen tiemau, bice Mr Gillils, is favourably disposed towards the changes advo cated by Mr Si R\ io* towards the end of last session Ile would, however, carry matters

that, in giving utterance to tho views express«!, he was speak ing foi himself alone Ho dis tmctly stated tint he did not present himself as the exponent of Opposition opinions, as he li id not ov en so much ns discussed the matters referred to with those sitting around him (Statements made under such circum stances cannot be said to havo mueh political significance, nevertheless, we cannot help thinking that obite> dicta of the sort are better loft unspoken Except m very raro instances, gentlemen can only exercise that sort of parlia montai y influence which all desue to wield, by acting in combina tion The L,reat obstacle which earnest men encounter in endeavouring to secure fait pi ty for their principles, is the difficulty of getting any number of honest people to agree sufficiently well to render concerted action possible All political alliances which rest on something higher th in self interest aro most fragile fabncs, and the more straightforward the contracting parties are the greatei chance is there that the segregating power of con staut differences will overcome the cohesion resulting from party dis cipline-will cuise the centiifugal to rL.0 superior to the centnpetal force Such being the case, wo think that it behoves all politi cians-especially gentlemen like Mr Francis, whose position in public estimation lends w eight to their woids to abstain from any expressions of opinion which may become bones of contention or rocks of offence, unless a deliv ei ance is absolutely called for by tho requirements of personal honoui or the obligations of public duty We submit with all possible respect that so long as gentlemen aie under some soit of tacit or avow ed agreement to act to gether, it is well that they should endeavour to como to a common understanding with regard to im portant questions of policy before making announcements winch aro un called for by tho exigencies of the moment, but which, nevertheless, may seriously hamper and embarrass subse quent action While principles must not bo lost sight of for a moment m public life, it is indisputable that " the *' possible" will claim a largo shaio of attention Nothing, therefoie, should tie lightly said which by chance may have a tendency to discredit any future combination of men that might hereafter be found desirable in the inte rests of the country There is a season for ev erything, according to Solomon, and no one admires outspokenness, m its proper place, moro thoroughly than we do But self restraint m this par ticular is frequently necessary in older to preservo that concerted action with out which nothing of any value can bo achieved in the parliamentary at ena Our present Government meets with as little success in reconciling people outside the colony to its peculiauties in talk and action as it does with regard to people within our uoidcrs New South Wales has been aggrieved by one absurd offer aftet anotlict with icgaid to the boidei duties, and now, as the public will kain from íecent telegiams, there is a prospect of a breach with South Australia in connexion with the new postal contiact Hie remark able featuie of the case is, that protestations are continually on the lips of our A ictonan Ministers of thou noble intentions with regard to the sister colonies Mr Lvlor melts into pathos when ho re proaches Sir Ulnry Pyrkes for for getting that wo speak the same tongue and live under the same Sovereign, and for thinking only of mere money, and Mi Bepry has more than once indicated that his real mission is to establish a federal union But as a matter of fact, as we 1 now, Mr L ylor twice attempted with a foolish cunning to jockey New South Wales, and now wo havo the Premiei of South Australia declaiing, m a phrase which is homely enough,

Rvleich's poem " And should tho world reply, Straight ri\ e the world the he As regards South Austiaha, it must be admitted that she has all along had a substantial grievance with regard to tho new postal contract That colony ia as much interested m the mattei as wo are Her mails como via Suez as well as our own, and wo calculate upon obtauung a very handsome contribution norn her Yet it ia a matter of history that instead of inviting the cordial co operation of the auster colony in the postal negotiations, our Ministers havo treated her with studied neglect She was not asked to express any opinion a3 "to what tenders should be called for One of the two services which were .finally put upon the market would havo ignored Adelaide altogether, and made Melbourne the first and only jport of call, and the reason our Government havo not carried out tina high handed arrangement is not any equitable regard for tho rights of other people, but tho circumstanco that no company would do tho work for them because it involved tho forfeiture of the Adelaide and the Sydney trado Eor many mouths, however, South Aus- tralia did not know but that she was to bo absolutely shut out from the Suez mail contract, and it is only within the last few days that terms have been communicated to her Such treatment of a sister colony is happily without a parallel in Australian history We need not bo at all surprised if tho httlo colony-independent and well to do as it is-should now bo somewhat sus picious of our intentions, and should bo firmly resolved not to submit to our dictation It is understood that South Australia originally claimed to bo a party to the contract, and that she now demurs to a special payment of £2,500 per annum asked from her on account of tho steamer calling at Adelaido Under the old or existing contract aho pays £5,000 pel annum, and that contract is made by Victoria Wo do not know what tho objection could be to a joint contract The mail service is essentially a federal matter, and if we cannot agreo with a friendly neighbour whoso intoicsts arc identical with our own in a simple trans action of tina kind, the prospect of a union with legaul to land, customs, and laws is remote indeed If a mero postal anangement is impossible,it is hypocrisy to talk of federation and of fuendli ness Hie colonies must bo content to figuie before the woild as isolated, greedy, and selfish units, with no umbi tion foi national interests and no desire for an imperial future As to the subsidy of £2,500 per annum, no doubt the demand is a reduction from the present £5,000, moro especially as the one sum is paid for a monthly, and the other is expected for a. foitmghtly ser- vice But the reason for any special contribution has gone It was equit iblo to take such a sum from South Aus tralla ov er and above hei postage fees bo long as Victoria paid fiom £15,000 to £20,000 per annum m addition to her postage fees, but theic is no moral doubt but that, under the new contract, which is to bo peifonned foi less money than the old sei vice was, which is to double the numbei of maila, and which takes in Sydney as well as Adelnde, the balance will be on the other side of the ledger Wo demand no subsidy fiom New South Wales, none from New Zealand, none from Tasmania, and no doubt it is felt to bo unjust to South Australia that that colony should be mulcted because she is supposed to be m our pow ei Ministers will also be aware that the sistei colony is not defenceless as of j ore Circumstances havo altered with the rolling years, and it is undeistood now lo bo quite possiblo for the South Austiahan Government to make a contract with the Onent line, by virtue of which the John Eldci and her sister vessels would sail monthly on regular dates, and would land mails foi overland delivery via Naples Such a service might cost South Australia more than she would havo to pay under the Victorian contract, but people will make sacrifices lather than be slighted or wronged And what we havo to con sider is, that the new service would deprive us to a gi eat e?tent of the Adelaide postages, that the vessels would take mails both from here and from Sjdno}, and that sooner or later they w ould îrjure oui revenue m this direction also Thus we have a very large mteiest at Btake There is no question now whether oui steamers shall journey uti Adelaide or not Our contract with tho P and O Company provides that the call shall be made, and certain impoitaiit post 1 concessions havo been obtained fiom Great Bntain on the same undeistanding, so that the Adelaide visit will havo to be paid w hethei South Austialia establishes a service of her ow n or otherwise On overy ground, therefore, as a matter of ex pediency as well as of justice, we hope to hear that Mimstcis have reconsidered their policy of making a difference between South Austialia and the othei colonies, and that they have " agreed " quickly " with a neighbour

the 2jth September, the second reading would not be taken until then, and lion members would have ampio opportunities of nddreaaing themselves to the subject Professor Pearson s speech took the ITouse to a treat extent bj surprise, for it wa« of a nature that caused the cheers to como prin cipallj from the Opposition aide The main use of the present bill he considered would be that it would lead to
