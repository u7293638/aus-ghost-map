MASSACRE OF A SHIP''S CREW. A CANNIBALISTIC FEAST. Another story of a ship's crew being mas- sacred was brought to Sydney on the 4th inst. by the steamer Moresby, which arrived from New Guinea and island ports. About a month ago the 16 ton cutter Sea Ghost was despatched by the owner, Mr. Tin- dal, of Shortland Island, on a trading cruise in the Solomon Group. The cutter was undor the command of Captain Colohorn, and flew the German flag. When approaching Nusa Island, near Bougainville, the captain was in the rigging, on tho look out for reefs, and did not notice that the natives, who had put out in canoes as usual, had clambered on board in largo numbers. Captain Celohorn was descend- ing the rigging when the natives made tho at- tack. He was surprised, and being unarmed, was soon butchered. Four of the nativo crew made a desperate fight ; but the odds against them were great, and they were overcome. The other two natives of the crew were taken prisoners, but afterwards managed to escape. Meanwhile, the Sea Ghost had been run ashore, and having been looted of everything valuable, was subsequently destroyed. Tho captain's body was thrown overboard, but the remains of the four murdered natives were taken to the village for a cannibalistic feast. The Gorman warship Falke will. In due course, proceed to the island to punish tho natives.
