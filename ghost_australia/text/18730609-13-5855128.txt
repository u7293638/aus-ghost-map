THE APRIL MAGAZINES. No. I. The London Quarterly opens with a ponderous and pedantic article upon the science, study, and various schools of jurisprudence, view ed as a science of ethics When we say that the writer goes back to Socrates and comes down to Professor Lorimer, it will be seen that his dissertation covers an enormously wide field, while the authorities he quotes are formidable in number and tremble m erudition It is quite a relief to turn from the learned jargon of the jurists to the simple doctrine of the Stores -"There is but one formula for morals, and that 15, live harmoniously with nature " The Rev S Baring Gould's works are reviewed with some asperity city, on account of their heterodox character and tendencies especially his assertion that "the religion of English dissenters is, to a greater extent than anyone has supposed a r e vival of ancient Paganism, which has long lain dormant among the English peasantry ' Methodism he traces back to Druidism his notice of a recent work on the ancient stone implements and weapons found in Great Britain, there is a good deal of special pleading employed to prove that not one of these relics of antiquity can be proved to be as old as the Christian era A clever analysis of Middlemaicli has no fault but that of brevity The novel is pronounced to be "perhaps more of a masterpiece than any work from the same hand except Romola, and full justice is done to " George Eliot s" masterly treatment of some of the most momentous psychological problems of the present day There is also an excellent article on the recent translation of Virgil, in which it is shown that the great Mantuan was the father of the pie turesque in poetry, that his hexameter " stands alone as the perfection of metrical form in the modulation of exquisite taste, and that, of all English poets, none has so much the style and spirit of Vngd as Tennyson The writer of a memoir of Napoleon III discards the old maudlin maxim, De mortuis, Le, and paints the dead adventurer in his true colours are pronounces the second Empire a failure, brands its master as an atrocious criminal, and declares that the Emperor was " notoriously profligate privateers, and that his Court was decent only by comparison with that of Isabella of Spain Under these m flounces, ' he goes on to say, " the youth of France grew up eitel v ated and selfish, and the late war showed how little of heroism and chivalry there was among the people " of the Parisians it is observed that they have " something of the spaniel in their nature they love the hand that whips them' An investigation of the Roman Catholic due time of the Holy Ghost, apropos of a recent work by Monseigneur Gaume, although hostile to the work itself, seems to view it with satisfaction as an evidence that the subject is being profoundly studied by every community of Christians, the Roman Catholics included , norn whence the water concludes that now as in the ancient times, the Spirit may be thus preparing to renew the face of the earth " Mr. Edward A Freeman, in the roi I nightly, like the writer referred to above, discards what he calls 'thewrekedsayrng" about the dead, and shows no tenderness for the crimes of the dead Emperor remarking that he knows "nothing more loathsome than the flood of posthumous flattery which burst for that once on the death of the plant" As an indication of thonrabrlrtj of so many people to understand the guilt of a public crime, while they are keen enough to perceive that of a private crime, Mr Freeman views it with anxiety and regret An essay on the relation of witchcraft to non Christian religions, contains some curious particulars with respect to the universality of the belief in the former Mr David Syme, of this city, contributes an article entitled ' Restrictions on Trade, from a Colonial point of view " It is closely plausible, but replete with those fallacies which have been knocked on the head years ago by all the best economists in Europe and America The whole question is surveyed from the producers point of view exclusively and we are invited to believe that the laws of nature-of which unrestricted exchange is manifestly one do not apply to new countries whatever they may do to old We are actually told that the chief object which our colonial Sibthoips have in view in imposing import duties is to put down monopoly by extending the sphere of competition ' A kindly notice of Mr Porter's Studies in the Linton y of Hu, Benaisianee describes them as the work of a new and distinguished master in the great and difficult art of writing prose and as constituting " a singular and interesting addition to literature ' In an essay on Liquor and Licensing," Mr Arthur Arnold asserts that there is a natural alliance between Protestantism and gm ' Cast join thoughts around the world, he says and you will find that the zone of drunkenness is also that of religious liberty and of the sacred Protestant light of private judgment An article on Hegel and the Mathematicians, by Mr Robertson Smith, and reply to it by Dr Stilling are terrible to contemplate, bustling as they do with angels are for moral e , what they may be to lead we do not even venture to conjecture Enough to say, from a superficial glance at their contents, that neither of the centre veisiahsts appears to be able to keep his temper '

occupy a position that is almost, if not altogether unique in periodical literature One of its foremost characteristics is many sided press It does not reflect one phase of thought, but allows free expression to the most antagonistic sentiments If its articles do not obtain assent, they certainly promote collection and encourage inquiry In the piesentniuiibor Mr W R Grey asks, "Isa Christian life feasible in these days'' and meets the question with an explicit no ' '1 valuing that strange book, The Ti me History of Joshua Davidson, as his text, the reviewer proceeds to show that the fate of the Cornish enthusiast, who "simply imitated what would have been Christs conduct all along," would also be that of the Saviour if he were to come again as before Mr Grey Bilja - 'Wo half say one thing, and half believe another We pinch and profess what we do not drink of practising, what we should probably be scouted at and punished for if we did practice and what, in our hearts and our dim bed from thoughts, we suspect it would be wrong to practise " The conclusions finally aimed at by the reviewer to these-that the Christian doctrines of " non resistance almsgiving, improvidence, and communism, are not practicable in these days, and would be decidedly nervous, and therefore obviously wrong" Di Tylor com mences an interesting dissertation on " Primitive Society, chiefly in order, as it would appeal to trace back morality to its source D Acland contributes an essay on Faith and Knowledge, in which he argues that there is nothing in the growth, possession, and progress of the latter to make the former impossible, and assures us that his own faith is a complex union of knowledge and love and does not need or admit logical demonstration Mr J M Ludlow a lecture on Friendly Societies comprehends a considerable amount of information with respect to the entry and operation of these associations in the mother country, some of the most curious of which are the 'Mort cloth

the petition of the articulate senses But we scarcely needed a Dr Carpenter to tell us that The other papers in the current number are Mr Herbert Spencer son Sociology, a memoir of the younger Vane by

understand why the story should be vested in the present number of Fraser Does anybody feel the slightest interest in the whitewashing of a statesman who died 200 years ago Couldn't Mr Palgrave try his hand on the Colfaxes the Caldwell's and the Pomeroy's of our own times?
