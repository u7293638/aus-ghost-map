'The places 'baed to be easy enough to find when1 1 was, a lad,' he1 muttered to himself; 'butyl suppo'se the Kubric has been altered since/then,, and evidently altered for the worse.' He had been rather dubious on his ar rival at Brimley whether some of the very big people of the neighbourhood 'might not still boar in mind some of the esca pades of his early years and decline to acknowledge him.
