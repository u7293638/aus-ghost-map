Mad ?—Mad ! Mad ? Mad! Oh, no, I am not mad ; I hold my memory yet ; My country-home, my boys, my girls ; MAD ?—Then I should forget ! Worn out, not mad ! Oh, God above, Thou knowest my faithfulness ! I spent my uttermost stiength, and now, Behold my lonliness. I served my husband in the place Whereto he staked my life ; Bore many children, cared for them— A toil-bound, unhelped wife ! I nursed the helpless little ones, I planned and toiled for all ; I loved all things—except myself— Love mixed this cup of gall ! How could they think a form so slight Could do and never fail ? They must have seen my fading self— My red lips growing pale ; And when from utter bankruptcy Of strength I lost my poise, They thrust me here with lunatics And all their hideous noise ! Caged ! half-clad in a padded room ! No windows—stifling air Which comes, all letid, from the hall— No old friend anywhere ! One day like all the rest—stone dead ! I, dead and locked away From all I've earned, from all I love, Oh, for one free, bright day ! My God ! words are so poor ! To place Such tyrants over me ! They turn my children, friends, away ! They force insanity ! Mad ! Yes, at intervals, Indeed ! They would grow mad like, me, With nought to love or see ! Oh, let me out, and I will steal Into oblivion's gloom ; Give me wherewith to take my life And creep into my tomb ! I cannot die so slow You fear ! My life may sadden yours ? No ! I will flee the world for you ; God's better world allures. Declare me mad !—But let the sun Shine on my haggard face, Oh, for one moment, unrestrained, To leave this crazy place ! Mad?—mad ! Snakes coil my heart ; Mad ghosts—they stalk about ! Ho keeper !—cage the lunatics ! The lost souls !—they are out !
