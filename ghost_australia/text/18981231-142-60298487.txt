About t;lr'ee o'clock in the morniing, as a man was p:assin, , down Ath,.l-road; Sunderland, in the IIlluin district, he saw a coiuIplete outfit of clothing hanging on some railings. lie thought it a rather stran;ge circus, stanuce, and, being an hottest man, he informe tlihe police at the Hrndonu Police station, and they fetched the clothes. It was a good suit; and in the pockets was discovered a watch and other articles; but in money there was only one half penny. The suit i)wa brought to the Centiril Police Station, and duqring tlie morning' a young man, 19 or 20 years of Rgge, camue up and'clain,(bd them, and they were handed o'er to him. He coultd give no accountihow the clothes came to be in Athol street. All lie kniows is that the only article of .attire he brbught honle was his walking stigo. There is no doubt, however, that 'owing to the heat or somte other cause he undressed himself in' A. thol-street, anud lumi his clothes, as he thought, on the peg in his bedroom. Then he injkthave ivrtlked houhe.-lThe wonder---_ is that he was not seen .|y. someone, because a man attired in a ivalking= stick is not- usually seen in the streets. Perhaps he "vas noticed by some he: fated individual, for he had to walk nearly half ia mile to his housa. If so, they would prol:ably have mistaken him for a ghost, or thought that it wan Venus- or, more correctly, Adonis-- out for a transit, and ther6 is just the possibility that if anyone did see him; the obset ver's condition did not permit him to be dogmatic on anything con nected with vision. Anyhow, it id surely one of the funniest things that has occurred in Sunderland lately.
