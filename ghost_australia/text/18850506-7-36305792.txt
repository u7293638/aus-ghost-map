We quote the following imseage from it: —" For three months *ia>t my firctmistanrx*, in ons-Mjnenofi of personal and domestic affliction, have not been favorable for the preparation d such an address as you sue entitled to c\j?ect from yur retiring moderator, jx-t 1 cannot leave this chair without offering a. few words upon our past fXIK-ricnceE, and our prospects, our hopes, and duties* in the future. The year wJiich has jti.st closcxl has witnessed many changes among us ; in fact, more changes than we have had during any i>revious yfiarof our history. There were four ministerial members present at onr lest annual meeting ivlio are not with us to-day. Tlie vcar had but commenced when nee i.'f Two ministers liave resigned, one of whom has entered on an inviliug field of labor in the FifetcT colony of New South Wales—the other we he;*' en?

Considering onr small number?, so many change; liavo undoubtedly had a disoouragincr vffect npun us, and have thrown a H.im-what heavy burden on those among us who arc in a pi-sition to render help to vacant congregation)l. Hut we have reason to be thankful that to .-ouif extent the breaches in <>ur ranks Live iwen closed. We have among: in* to-day two brethren who have recently en terrd on h:ii>ortaiit spheres of labor, and frtiin whose ability and experience we imve reason to rxi>ec* much.

The system called to teach is one of which aiuid the ci-iitiict <>f oiiiniou we have uo reason to be ashauicd. Tliut the of mun has ? 'liguiatid iv tiie sovereign, fre?-, everlasting luieof 4iod; that it is through the ali-iierfect eacritice ?'Heied by the obedience untt> death of His only-begotten Sou; that tlw.-Mj who leciive Jt^ub are freely justified and become I'artaktrs of the life eternal—these, brielly stated, are the leading features of that system of doctrine which !.?, held among us; aud whilst ue give all credit to brethren in other churches who look at the same truths from a dif ferent btaudpoint, and acknowledge that < ien in icgard to the&e; doctrines we are sin iminded with dift-.culcies on all sides, we niaiutain Uiat, better than any other, our fryfctem interprets the t of tiod, aud is iitted at ouce to meet the re quiioiiunts <>l the sinful boa] and to build U[i the btliever in faith aud holiness. Our f->stem ?f chinch goveniment is al?o calcu lated to draw forth our hearty loyalty. It rejects all notions of priestly authority and faciamcnUil grace, und not only pLixo^ all its uiiiiist?n> in a position <>t equality with each other Lut :dso regards them as {teraons who are to liavo uo dominion over the faith of the dis ciples, but who aiv to be heljJers of their joy. Better than any are acquainted it secures on the one hand the dignity of the Christian ministry and on the ether the rights and liberties of the Christian people," The rev. gentleman next combated the opiuiou that is gaining ground that long pastorates are undesirable, and he reftrrtd to the j ?>???? of the Holy Gkos-t as boiug indispensable to their success as a churdi. lie thtn proceeded:—"There are mauy things, around us aud among us which are calculated to cause usauviety and to stir us up to call upon God for a fresh baptism ?f the Holy Ghost, We have no vidi to take a gloomy view of the state of religion. 'He do nut imagine, as some good C'hristume do, that matters are rapidly enming from bad to worse, and that this is bJund to be the coupe of things till there is a, viable manifestation of -the I?ord from heaven. We sincerely bilieve, notwitbstand ms ccrtriu aifeatances to tie contntry, that the world is jjeUing better, and that tbe kingdom of God is making progress. Yet there are things which are fitted to produce eadnesn in our hearts. There is a widespread alienation on the part of large masses of the people from the ordinances of religion. There lias grown up around us a spirit of luxury and frivolity which has unfitted many for every diing like serious thought on the grave responsibilities of life, and of its issues. It njay-; be ?questioned if eren among Christian people tliere is that earnest endeavor to f-iuictify the day <>f die l^ord which we_ be lieve to be necessary to tbe healthy mainte nance of die spiritual life. There is an in creasing difficulty in obtaining properly qualified persons to work in our SibbaOi mJiools and in other departments of Chris tian cxtatiuii, and there is reason to fear tiiat the number of persons who from time to time are led to avow themselves on tbe Jjord's side is very small. The ehnrch needs t/> ariee and put on strength—to realise wore fully the responsibility under which she lice to lifr great head and to the world; to set herself with renewed fiarnestness to the work giv of humble, ?niist pray?>r for the outpouring; of j tlie spirit of God." Mr, I^yall coneludeJ as follows:—"A pood many of the evangelistic i agencies of Hie present day p.re carried j?n outside the churches and not always in harmony vitb them. "Sow we most heartily rejoice in evei-y case where human souls are converted from the emr of their ways and brought into tte king-loot of God. Yet it is most desirable that th? con verts should become associated with organised churches; diat they should be in fall sympathy with those churches, and that the churches should furnish them with the means of spiritual improvement and of Christian useful ness. Perhaps we have been to blams in too much leaving i>£gressive work to bs done by outside agencies. Perhaps we need to be fahaken somewhat out of our dignity and to be made to feel that our work is not done when we have ministered to the comfort and edification of our own congre gations, but that we niast bestir ourselves for the Balvation of die ignorant, tbe wigoHy, the immoral around us. That church is likely to be mopt prosperous which concerns itself for tlie things of others as well as its earnestness to the rescue of the j?riihing and tlie salvation of the lost. Brethren, the time is short, and oar opportunities for usefulness are being rapidly abridged. 1 cannot retire from this chair with out recalling the great changes which hive taken place since this Presbytery was formed twenty years ago. There are only three here t others who have joined us in the interval !iav*> bwn removed. Ere lung our tim-i f>r work will come to a close. Be it ours to devote ourselves heart and soul t<> the glory of our Lord, and to La>?r according to oar nliility and opjiortunities f I that time when men shall be blessed in Him, snd all natioDs sliall call Him blessed." At the conclusion ?f his address be nominated a* liis successor the Rev.

Starting I rum yuom they had visited Hawker, Gordon, Wilson, and Beltana townships. At die latter place they bad held two meetings, when almost die whole of die people were present. At Rergott Springs Mr. Gray faai preached twice and addressed die Sabbath schooi, whilst Sir. Mitchell spent the ?Sabbath in visiting tile camps of navvies beyond Hergott and delivering die gospel manage. On the Monday both Means.

He had begun regular services, and dented that members of the Presbytery should set apart a day fur paying a visit. The Rev. T. Gray Lad also visited the hundreds of Cogiin and Morgan, had held services in Coglin andalso at Petersburg, and was greatly cheered by the kindly greetings of the people, who were most anxious to nave services as often as lioasible by the ministers of fbeir own church. They had also made & contribution |to the home mission fund. TheC{££Kjnored, and the Rev. J. A. Bckxs seconded, an! it was agreed that die reports of die two brethern be received, and diat tiiey be heartily thanked for die interest diey have shown, and die zeal with which they have undertaken die recent visitation. The Rev. R. Mitchell moved—"That the Sep. 5. Stewart visit Qoorn and neighborhood in the month of June; that die Rev. S. A. Luras visit in the month of July, and diat ether arrangements he left with himself." Agreed. IK THE EVENING a public meeting in connection with the I'ru?bvterv was held in St. Andrew^ Church, Wakefield-Etreet. There was a very Cut attendance, and die Rev. A. Xav (moderator elect) occupied the chair. The meeting having been opened with prayer, the Cbaxbsux delivered a short address, in which he re ferred to the present position of the church, and expressed die hope that increased energy would be thrown into die work dozing- the coming year. The Rev. J. EL Akgbb (cterk-of the Presbytery) then presented the annual {statement, and in dome bo remarked tiist the |ja&t; rear bad been one of the most eventful in the history of die church in South Australia. During diat time diey had lost four nnmstens, the Rev. W. A. Baker by death, die Rev. 3. ¥. Henderson, who had been called to Sydney, and die Revs. J. Mclntyre and W. XS. McQueen through 01 health, but botti of t&e; latter trcre expected to return. They had likewise lost by death die treasurer of the home mission fund and an aged elder of Chalmers Church, Mr. T, G. Brown. Five fresh lricisters had been received into die colony ; an addition bad been made to the stndeiAg-roll, which now tnznibered three; and they had also received on probation die Rev. T. %V. Smythe, who was supplying die church at Koolnnga. efficiently, and who in due coarse would as doubt take a place in fbe ranks. There wereetilla number of vacancies, butthese were regularly supplied, and would prove attractive to some servant Jfmiiy to engage in regular work. The home mission ciamnittee had taken charge of die vacancies, meeting monthly and preparing a plan—a new departure which had worked exceedingly wefl. TLU course nas found to be necessary, not oi.ly because it ensured a regular supply, bat because it enabled die church to guard itself against the inroad of airenturers, who with rat any credentials whatever had Bought to take sane of die churches by storm. Four of die members of the Presbytery attended die con ference in Sydney in July last with very satis factory results.
