It appears that a ball was .held at Worines ley's;Hotel,Dunkeld, on that night, when Saiabo was in the bar of the hotel with a number of young men and boys, who com menced larking with the aborigirial, and he 'was dragged out of the hotel by one of the'iiij. named Prank Shaw, and, when out side' tha other boys knocked him down, and kicked him in the stomach. In the meaning Sambo was found lying in the yard of the hotel, and tlie police removed him to the Hamilton Hospital,- where he was' found to be suffering from a fractured lib; and acute imflanirnatibn of the lungs * and bowels, which resulted in his death. -Two' of, the party named. Middleton and Griffon wore arrested, by the police. The inquest was adjourned, for a week for further evidence. The Bendigo Independent Bays of the victim: — 'Poor Sambo! a more amusing blackfellow never tried, a novel step dance, mimicked a kangaroo, or threw a boomerang, and he will be much ' missed by every person accustomed to travel by railway from Hamilton to Ararat. \ He; was one of the very few aboriginals who are still roaming1 about that district; , soon there will not be one left.' Ourtele -i£ grains state three young men were yester day committed for trial by the Coroner for \ coinplicity in the outrage. Vbey Hard Lines, — A man named Summers was convicted of robbery - in company at the Criminal Court, Mel' bourne, in December last, and sentenced to five years' imprisonment with three lash ings of 25 each. The first of these the prisoner has undergone, and was to have received the second instalment : last week; but as he is now supposed to be innocent of the crime for which he was convicted, no further punishment will be dealt out until his case has been fully considered. Mr! Hodges, the Chinese interpreter, took the^ matter up, with the result that he has ? secured the conviction of a man named Doiiovan, who has made a declaration of Summers's innocence. Summers has made a similar declaration, and the ? particulars have been laid before the Executive with a view to obtaining Summers's release. AFloubishing Society.— An Agctele gratri states that the annual report of the Equitable Life Assurance Society of New York, whose branch offloe in Sydney has Just been opened shows premiums for the year amounting to 10,727,547 dollars.'

Valetta on 14th Feb. '- He preached his final sermon in 'England at Westminster * Abbey on 10th Feb., before a crowded con gregation. There has been a prompt arid generous response to Dean Bradley's1 appeal for subscriptions to replace the 2000' volumes that Dr. Barry lost through the ' foundering of the Simla. The bench of' bishops'marked their sympathy by a joint contribution of £200. The amount ' re ceived, added to the £500 for which the library was insured, will amply repair the loss sustained so' far as the books are con cerned. .Of course, the loss of the bishop's manuscripts and private notes' is irre ' parable.. It is stated that not the least valuable part off Dr. Barry's new library will consist of carefully-selected volumes which he will owe' to her Majesty's thoughtful and gracious generosity.' Bishop Barry will reach Adelaide to-day. Colonial Defences. — Recent news from England states that when the Army ' estimates are under discussion.

The Launceston Baths. — Tlie con struction of the new baths is progressing but slowly, chiefly owing to the' Marine Board not having supplied the sand for the bottom of the bath. The row of piles on the right hand side is completed; and the row on the left hand side nearly so. The third row of piles the workmen ' have not been able to proceed with, as an ' opening must be left to allow the punts to bring the sand through'.' This, however, will shortly be remedied, and work will once irioro be. in full' 'swing. ', The dimensions of the sides of the bath, as marked on 'the original plan, have been slightly altered. Owing to the extremely rocky nature of ground, it was found necessary to narrow the baths about 13ft., which, however,' has been,1 if anything, more than made up in the length, arid the superficial measure ment will bo over 8000 square feet. The baths will be divided into parts— a' larger and smaller — the latter of which will be used by the ' great unwashed,' who will probably be admitted free or charged merely a nominal sum'; The larger division will be- well- fitted up and inade very com fortable, and it is hoped that the cold water- loving community will be able to enjoy the use of it .about ,tho end of October next, by which time it is ex pected the baths will be -finished'. -. - . '? Teebible Explosion op Dynamite— A telegram from Cape Town -. states :— A terrible dynamite explosion occurred on tlie diamond fields at J6beers, near Eim bdrley, onthe afternoon of thelOth January. Eleven out of fourteen magazines' blew up, causing immense damage throughout the; fotax camps. The cause of the, explosion is at present unknown. The loss is estimated at 33 tons of dynamite, '7 tons of loose pdwder,300,000 or 400,000 loose cartridges', arid a large quantity of mineral- oils. Throe persons were killed, and others are missing. Fragments of the bodies- wore found scattered about the Veldt A Stubbobn Defendant.— Mr. John Lyons was on 28th Jult. summoned, at the ?Police Court for having failed to pay £1 Is fee due for' his steam-engine having been inspected by Mr. J. Lowes, Inspector of Steam- engines. Mr. E.J H. ' Dix had applied 'for the, money about a dozen times, but without avail. The defendant's contention was that because Mr. Lowes had not taken the engine' to pieces and examined' each part, it had not been, pro perly inspected. Mr. Lowes. : stated that he had inspected the engine, as '.was his rule in all such eases, arid it1 was not necessary to take the engine' to pieces to. grant a certificate/ The- defendant was very stubborn ' about . this point; and . did not seem to bo riiore convinced; when the Bench ordered him to pay the amount claimed, with costs.'. ?' Professor Tolmaqtte. — Thb Professor' was again brought up at : the'Police Court on 28th ult, on remand, on the charge of being of unsound mind. Mr; Superin tendent Coulter stated to; the Bench that the Professor had been examined by Dr. Thompson, who said that his- mind was decidedly unhinged, but he thought it iriight be only teriiporary.. Dr. Thompson was willing to admit him into the Hospital for a time, which would probably do away with the necessity, for sending hiinto the New Norfolk Asylum. The Professor, however, refused most strenuously' to go to the Hospital. ? Mr. Coulter therefore asked for a further remand of one week, for other medical examination, which was granted. Professor Tolmaque seemed, if anything, to be in a worse state of mind than ever, arid addressedthe Bench in very excited tones, asking, on what evidence the doctor had arrived at the conclusion that he was insane. He became so excited that the Police Magistrate had to order his removal from the Court..- ?

' .' ;' . , '. , ' QUAEREL AmONOST NEIGHBOURS.', — A summons, arising out of a quarrel between two neigiibours living at Turner's Marsh occupied the attention of the Court on 28th ult. for about an hour and a half. . The defendant, a '.sloyenly-lookirig fellow of about 18 years of age, named John Collins, was charged byi.Mrs.1 Eliza Wallace with having Svourided eight , pigs, belonging to her liusbandl Itf.'appeared thai there was a side fence, between the parties, half of which was kept in repair by one ,, owner, aid half % the other. , The pigs got into the land owned by' the defendant's father, by going under the part of tne fence be longing to him. ,!Mrs. Wallace's attention was called to the pig3 by their squealing, and on going up,to theni sawthe defendant .brutally sticking them with a pitchfork. He pierced two of them tlirough the eyes, so that they died .from:, tlie effects. The other pigs were also wounded severely. The* . husband and son of the complainant were preserit when the pigs were wounded.,' The husband is an old m'an, and the son a siinple-looking young fellow, and neither of them offered any resistance to the defendant. The defen dant's version of the L affair, as given by his father and sister, was very different and was to the effect that the defendant's family did not own a pitchfork. Their part of the fence was in good order, but the com plairiant's'was not. The sister of the de fendant, a little girl about twelve years of age, fenced with -Mr.. Collins in cross examination in_J;he niost old'fashionod manner. When 'asked how she remem bered the date, she said it was because she looked at the almanac on that day, because she wanted to remember the day in case her father or brother were ''pulled.'' When asked what she meant by ' pulled,' she explained that she thought some of her people would be shot. The ohild had evi dently been schooled as to what evidence she should give. The whole family aie well known, arid both the defendant: and another sister have previously distinguished th'emselves in ; the witness-box, and, it -is most deplorable, that,, children should be brought up with an utter disregard to the . truth. The Bench found the defendant guilty, the fine,' damage, costs, etc., amounting to £4 16s 6d. ? ; An Unfeeling Fatheb. — A labouring man named Albert Edward Bird was sum moned at the Police Court on Saturday for having failed to contribute towards the support of his three children— two little girls.and aboy. The children have been taken care of by a Mrs. Hughes, a very respectable woman, who has done her best ,for the children, and for whom they have evidently a great affection. Mrs. Hughes took the children at the beginning of the year, their mother having died in the previous September. Bird has generally been backward in his payments, and seems at the best a very indifferent father. He is at present £4. 10s in arrears, and he stated to the Bench, his, reason for not obeying the order' of the Court was that he was at work on a job and could not get his moriey until it was finished. ,? The Police Magistrate said that he ? considered him a worthless fellow, and he had not the slightest confidence in his promises. Mrs. Hughes stated that the defendant had kicked the. . eldest . girl . about shamefully; arid that orione occasion .two men inter fered to prevent him beating the little boy in the street; Bird was allowed by the magistrates until Monday to find the money, but as he failed to comply with the order he was sentenced to six months' hard labour. .

An Extraordinary Case. — A very ex traordinary case was reported to the de tective police on 26th ult., says. the Mel bo|urne Age. Amongst the passengers by the steamer Waihora, which arrived late on! Tuesday night from New Zealand, were a 'Mr; Maririaduke Clarke and his wife. On the steamer arriving at the wharf it was found that Mrs. Clarke was extremely ill^ and Mr. Clarke, seeing that it was im possible to procure lodgings owing to tho late hour at which the steamer arrived,, went on shore to find a doctor. Prioi* to' do^ng this, however,1 he called '; the stewardess of the boat, and having eX-T plained' to her the seriousness of Mrs. Clarke's ' condition, told her that a large quantity of valuables in Mrs. Clarke'^ cabin also required looking after.' Mr. Cljarkewent onshore, and after an absence pfl some time returned1 to find that his wife was dead; that slie had been stripped of 'her jeivelryi and' that a sum of £90 in gold; of which she was possessed/was missing^ Heat once made inquiries, arid . after some time the ; stewardess handed to '? hiin twogold rings and an empty purse, stating that the whole of Mrs. Clarke's' wearing apparel had been throwd ' over board, although for what reason was not stkted: The gold, however, was missing, arid Mr. Clarke, feeling that- the case- was one which required inquiry, reported thS matter to the detectives. The Melbourne Age of Saturday lost, 29th ult. says : —The account published yesterday of the death of a Mrs. Clarke on board the New Zealand steamer Waihora has been called into Question' by the officers of the vessel. Tliey state that Mrs. Clarke and her four children were steerage passengers, andem barked at Napier. ' Mrs; Clarke was carried on board in a dying condition; and was accompanied by her sister-in-law as far as Duriedin, where her husband joined her. She was treated with great kindness by tho captain and officers, and' everything was done to relieve her sufferings. Although dying of consumption, she waB also suffer ing severely from dysentery, and after her death her clothes were, by her husband's' wish and in his presence, thrown into tho river, as he did not wish theih to be seen. Mrs. Clarke died in hat husband's arms, and it was': not until after death' thatftie left the ship in search of- a doctor. The: stewardess (Mrs. Duproe) states that after .Mrs; Clarke's death the rings which she had upon her fingers were' given ; to;Mr. Clarke, as also was ^an empty purse found in|her dress pocket. The version of the affair given -yesterday was obtained at the detective -office from a written complaint made to the police by Mr. Clarke. [ ' ; ? A SERyiOE'OF Song will be 'given1 at ^t.

Upon the sympathy of such friends, much , riiore than upon a chance crowd gathered by eccentric and profane antics, the'permanency and usefulness ., of these new' reformers will rest.

To say- that, the Christian churches of 'the land have riot ... attempted to reaoh' all classes, that they, have never succeeded, and that the Salya- ?:' tion Army has succeeded, is to make a .re markable statement.

' Glen'obe. — A correspondent writes :— . On, Sunday, last the anniversary services in connection with the Glenore 'Wesleyan Sunday-school were held, when able ser monstwere preached by the Rev. Mr. Cock of::Beaconsfield, to largo ? congregations. . . ':.- Special hymns for the. occasion were sung by' the children, the Misses Badcock ' efficiently presiding at the organ. On Monday | a. tea-meeting was held in the sphool- rponi, at-which a large number of persous were present. After tea, a report read: by the Superintendent showed the number of children on the .books to be forty three, the average attendance being good. The Treasurer's report showed a slight balance in hand from last year. The pro ceeds of,; the present anniversary and tea meeting amounted to JB12 16s. During the year the school has purchased a new cabinet organ, ; which has greatly enlivened the services. When I sent my last communica tion, the farmers in this district were nearly commencing harvest. Now harvest and threshing is all over. From what I can learn, the yield is rather below medium. It is true that a few fields, under exceptionally favourable conditions, .have yielded an. average, of ,40 bushels per acre of wheat.but I. hay e .heard ? of , other .fielder which have yielded. about eight bushels, after fallow and manure. I see -some of the 'early birds' 'are preparing for the early wheat sowing. The recent rain was, very accept; able,°but farmers imagine they want a little more.. . ,' ?'MisS' .Crowther. — This 'lady, whp' is mentioned 'elsewhere as 'having met witha severe accident at Longford, through having been thrown out of a buggy, is, we are sorry to sn,y, still in a state . of uncpn scipusness; and in a very critical condition.

Crowther was in attendance during Monday night;' and left town on Tucdday evening again for Longford; and Dr. Mason was also in attendance. As a. rule, 48 hours after a severe concussion . of the brain a, medicai'man can tell whether it is likely to prove fatal or not. ; The worst feature in Miss 'Crowther's case is the dilation of the eye-balls; but up to the -time- of -our I going to 'press no further ': news' had ; reabhed towii of her condition.

Thureau, the Government geologist,- has been here for some, days past for thepur-| pose of examining the extensive and little; known district iletwcen here and the -Speci- men Beef, with which he, appears to have already been favourably impressed by sur- - face examinations made.. His labours have, however; been hampere'dby the non-arrival' of his instruments, etc., which were ex pected to be forwarded after .him from' Launceston' by,. the Devon more ' than a week' ago, .but up to the, present have, neither turned up nor- ban Mr.' Thureau.' ascertani their whereabouts. If they are lost it will bo a serious matter, , as Mr. Thureau informs me that apart from their money valve one instrument, an English one, cannot be replaced in the , colonies.' Pending! their arrival, Mr. Thurijau is unable to proceed with his work, and his report, which will be looked for within-/ terestbymany outside Wai-atah, appears to bo indefinitely postponed. Mr. Thureau/ has. on previous visits expressed' his appre ciation of the comprehensive and economical manner- in which the vast deposits -of the Mount Bischoff Co.'s mine are; being' developed by' their able manager, and I am justified in stating that with regard to the. Mount Bischoff district Mr., Thureau is of ? opinion future operations will reveal other deposits of other ores which are at present' inaccessible through the dense scrub, or are overlaid, by beds of lava. ; I StreetJ Accident.— Thtrsday evening an old man, an inmate , of the1 Invalid , Depot, was walking along St. .

It is very generally agreod; that the tides are the lowest which have been seen, for years in this port.' A' strange incident, wluch Was to. a certain oxtent' a very , amusing one, occurred to ,',the, s.s.'.Corinna on Wednesday last.. ''When .the. tide was iout the ? steamer : sunk , into ' the mud, arid the suction was' so great that when the tide rose to the level at which jit should have floated the'steamer, it failed to do. so, and' continue1 d prising', while the' steamer' remained' stuck fast. As the water rose about two feet above the line, at which it should have, floated, the. steamer, the hydraulio power, became so, -great .that it tore the steamer from its mud sucker, and 'the consequence was; that when the'vossel was free, it rose with a sudden bound to its floating level, the result - being that many loose articles on deck were thrown about, while several persons oa deck were nearly overturned.
