VICTORIA AMATEUR TURF CLUB SPRING MEETING. SECOND DAY.—Saturday, Oct. 16. Stewards—Messrs. H. Smith, A. R. Black wood, James Grice, C. D. O'Halloran, and M. CShanassy. Handicapper—Mr. E. T. Barnard. Judge—Mr. G. Vowles. Starter —Mr. G. Watson. Secretary—Mr. N. R. D. ^The Caulfield Cap of 1886 has not been without its sensational features. Fortu nately they "were of a different character to that which caused such a thriU of horror to run through the Australian community last October. They were chiefly confined to betting transactions in connexion with the race. Ben BoRseemed to be regarded by the trainers and watchere as the horse among those backed by the public which could not I win, and this feeling seemed to pervade the tine, for he was one they never left off pep pering, with what result the _ sequel will Bbow. The running on the Guineas day did not give much of an inkling as to the pro babilities in the great event, except perhaps , that it proved tne only three year old engaged, First Consul, was a* colt possessed of more than ordinary calibre. SHvermine had been asked *evertd ^per tinent questions, and had answered tnem all so satisfactorily that his f nends were more sanguine than ever.. The party connect^ with Ben Bolt were in no way dismayed, tor their horse had done everything he had been asked in a manner which rather increased the confidence of his fnends, though as the large commissions in his favour had, been worked some weeks previously, ^prirein the market waa not affected- Boolka had a strong body of followers, whenrdhal upon judgment and trying tackle of Mr. S. Miller, there was an air of raysteiy enrrounding Little John which was not dispersed nntd he waa struck out, just before 11 o clock on I the morning of the race, when loud and deep nllf»ibgmn« were showered upon the brads, of those who had been instrumental in having Mm withdrawn. The weather during the day was dull and gloomy, but only a few drops of rain fell, and visitors badjhe satisfaction of witnessing .a goodday ssport at Caulfield without the"di8agreeable ar«m paniment of the antery element crowd Mean to assemble about noon, and before the time for the first race arrived it became evident that the attendance would surpass anything ever previously seen at Caulfield. The trains kept pouring m theu living freight, and hundreds of vehicles lined ! the roads leading to the course, the drive being one of foe pleasantest features of the day. His Excellency the Governor drove Ms own four-in-hand, which was occupied by the Gaveminent-Wse party, ^d twoor three other weU- appomted ^cfaea wereTOn spicuous on the Balaclava road. The cours never presented a more animatedappear ance nor was the track ever in better condi tion.'except, perhaps, next the rails, where it was a trifle softer than in the centreofthe course. In the grand stand enclosure there was a very large gathering, and when a race was bcinjf run the stand and the lawn wefo crammed. The fiat was never -ell .. •• -1, Thai ' ,r- '•!

Nor could any fault fa found with him. when he was stripped, ana, despite the extra 41b., his snpporters felt con fident he would land their money. Close at hand, his relative Sheet Anchor had cleared' a^ ring for himself by lashing out most vigorously as his cuatodiap removed' his clotheB and rubbed him over prepara tory to adjusting the saddle. His jockey who had piloted him to victory in the Melbourne Cpp had been chosen to ride him to-day, but few imagined him equal to the task of beating Malua. Yet he was in grand, health and condition, the extraordinary muscnlar development of hiB quarters being the theme of admiration. Grace Darling, his doughty opponent in last year's Melbourne Cap, also looked bright and well, and there was no more thoroughly-trained animal than' Isonomy in the paddock. The South Aus tralians naturally enough expressed doubta/ respecting the colt'B ability to beat Malua, but nevertheless they supported him tor; a goodly sum. The followers of the King-! ston stable were in the Bame predicament.] With Malua out of the way they would' have freely supported The Nun, but his presence prevented them investing on theirj filly, who, by the bye, has improved in a remarkable degree Tasmania was repre-.' sented by Highland Chief and Yonng Horatio, the former a much-improved horse, ana the latter just the cut of a hurdle* racer. Opal, a very fine son of Wellington/ and The Gem, but exceedingly wide in front, was as good-looking as anything/ present, but, as he was known to be troubled! with the slows, he was only engaged in a forlorn hope when opposed to such horses as) Malua and Co., nor was Retort considered in the slightest degree dangerous. The favourite! was narrowly watched aB he took his prelimi nary, which was in every way satisfactory,! and on the fiag falling he was one of the first to move from the mark. Always first or/ second, he entered the straight bo full of running that his success was regarded as certain, but Mr. Inglis unwisely hugged the rails, where the ground was much softer than' on the outside. Still he was going so well at the distance that he just took an easy at him, and then Qninn brought up Isonomy with a well-timed rush, and Mr. Inglis: had to commence in earnest on the' crack. Isonomy crowded him towards, the rails, so that Mr. Inglis could not use his' whip, and amid intense excitement the! favourite was beaten cleverly, and the book-1 makers cheered vociferously. The Nun: seemed to be going better than either at the finish, and bad Sheet Anchor been able to get through when O'Brien made his effort,' the finish would have been even more sensa tional than it was. Grace Darling also made a fast run at the finish. The victory of Isonomy at once caused him to be asked for in connexion with the Melbourne Cup, for which he advanced to 100 to 8. Isonomy, who Is a strapping fine bay colt with plenty of powpr all through,was bred by Mr. William' Bladder, and he is by Winterlakefrom Ruby,; the'dam of Sardius. He is engaged in the Melbourne Cup at 7et 121b., a weigh which i should . not prevent him from playing, a prominent part in the contest which, takes place shortly at Flemington. It must have been eminently satisfactory, to see 18 of the 20 numbered on the card for/ the Nursery Handicap face Mr. Watson.; Notwithstanding that Hortense had top weight she wad selected as the good thing of the party, and this in the face of a rumour that daring the morning she had got away from her boy ; but though this was true no ill effects were observable, and she left the paddock a strong favourite. Epicurean, f Lady Lovell, and others were also supported! by their respective partisans, but not to any*! thing like the same extent as Hortense. Mr.i Watson was net very happy in the start, and! Hortense, instead of getting off in front, as' she did in the Foal Stakes, was left lengths! behind. Firebrace made the pace a cracker ri but he died away when Bedouin challenged1 him in the straight, and for a moment Mr. j Pearson's colt raised the hopes of his sup-f porters; but he in turn was challenged byi Lady Lovell, and though Hortense by this: time had made up a deal of her lost ground' and was fast overhauling the leaders,! she could never reach Lady Lovell, whom' Robertson landed a very clever winner.) JL>ady Lovell, who was bred in New South' Wales by Mr. Frank Reynolds, is by The/ Drummer from the Tasmanian-bred mare Paradigm, by Peter Wilkins from Reflection'; by Lugar. By the withdrawal of Little John'' and Maroney the Cup field was reduced to 18. j No horse created a more favourable impress sion than Silvermine. whose blade coat shone/ like satin aB he was middled outside the en-i closure, and notwithstanding the compnL; sory cessation from work a few weeks pre-' vions, he presented the appearance of a well*! t—!-.-J "-r^e.
