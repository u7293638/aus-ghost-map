THE HOLY GHOST FLOWEB. A Bemapkablo Bloom.' The Holy Gliosi; flower, or Flor del Es- piritu Santo, is found in tho region of tho Isthmus' of Panama. It seoms to tlirivo in low, marshy spots, and springs up from decayed logs or from crevices in the rooks. Tho larger and older bulbs frequently send up tho leaf stalks Oft. or 7ft. in height, and from these, whioh aro joined, broad lanceolated loaves are thrown out in pairs. Tlio plant is an annual, and in Juno, July and August tlio flower, stalks start up from tho baso of tho bulb, devoting all their energies to tho formation of tho buds. Tho buds aro arranged on the stalks much like those of tho hyacinth, tlio usual number for a well-grown stalk to bear boing from twelve to fifteen. The leaves aro vory pale green in colour, as though in harmony with tho delicato purity of tho blossom. Tho blossom is of alabnster whiteness, much like tho old-Btylo English pulpit. This, of itself, is strikingly curious,, but it fades into insignificanco when ono looks into tho contro of that strange blossom, for tliore, nestling in its vory heart, is tlio perfect imago of a dove. It requires no imagination to seo it. No one could mistake it for anything else, for no human Bkill could fashion its shape moro perfectly, no artist eould adorn it with more elegant tints, and no perfumor could ondow it with a' moro dolicate fragranco. Right in tho cup of tho blossom, with tho suow-wliite canopy about it, rests this wondrouB image, its dolicatoly-moulded wings drooping, half-oxtondod, at its sido, its gold-tinted head bont slightly forward, and its tiny, oriinson-tipped bill almoBt touching its snowy breast. -An obsorver wlio saw it in its native homo, says : " Just as tho -figure of tho idovo itsolf is there, boyond dispute, so does-an oxprossion por- vado tho imago â€” an expression that oven the most careless cannot fail to notice, tho incarnation of humility and spiritual purity." 1_
