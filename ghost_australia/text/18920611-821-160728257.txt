In the first place he would like to express his obligation to all the ministers on the platform who bad come to extend to him such a hearty welcome. It showed that ail the Churches were one, although there might be differences of opinion. They aU preached the one Christ-the Christ who had been at the back of all progress, and who bad been tbe inspirer of all noble deeds that men had performed, tiie speaker dis coursed on the words, " I believe in God the Father Almighty, and in Jesus Christ, His Son, Our Lord. .... I believe in tbe Holy Ghost, the Holy Catholic Church." Be bad never lived in denomi national! sni, but believed in tbe Holy Catholic Church-the Holy Universal Church-outside his own denomination. It had always been his lot to work in harmony with all branches of the Church. He trnstedthatin coming to South Anstraliahewonld be able to live in the best amity, and hoped that his brethren would always find him ready to assist them in the good work which they all had at heart The work of the Church was not in meeting once or twice on SnndayB to hear sermons or sing hymns. Neither was it a Society formutual congratulations. If the Church of Christ meant anything at ill it was a Society where every one helped each and all. ThÂ» business of the Church was to Imitate Christ and to help humanity on to that goal towards which all their attention should be ever turned. During tbe evening the choir rendered several anthems, and closed the meeting with the Doxology.
