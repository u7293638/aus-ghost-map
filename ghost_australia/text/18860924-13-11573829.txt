NEW SOUTH WALES. ?-? ?_> (sort OUR ColtRE-rOND-NT. SYDNEY. Star. IS. I The Customs Duties Bill his been read a second time the Legislative Council by the large majority of 23 to I Not that there was a single member value liked the bill or spoke in its favour Several deplored the breaking up of the free trade system, and condemned its being done in opposition to the promises of the Premier and without any declared wish on the part of the country, but they would not take the responsibility of rejecting the measure The fact is that, though they like the Customs Hill little, they like the Land 'Tax Bill less, and they are prepared to accept the one if by so doing they can defeat the other. Not that the Customs Bill is set out of danger, because the seventh clause may p issibl) be amended. It alters the criminal law of the country by making an importer liable for a false declaration by one of his subordinates, This was strongly objected to in the Assembly, and the Premier made a sort of promise to have it recon battered, but he made it in a way which had mu ed of evasion, and, of course, the promise was evaded He might, however, have saved his honour, for he has a compact majority that will vote an) thing The question before the Council is whether they will swallow this clause or run the risk of losing the bill. Mr. Burke), who, by his intellectual superiority, generally leads the House is for taking a the cided course, but up to the present he has spoken in vain, because he listening to per ample members to vote against what they conceive to be their private interests A chamber of revision must consist of men, and wherever we have men they must have interests unit these in terests they cannot forget that the) an passing laws a It is natural that in our legislative Council there should be many gentlemen possessing large landed property, and their feeling in this matter seems to be that though protection is fell], still, if the people like to be befooled and to raise the revenue by indirect taxation, every penny) so must d easts the necessity for direct taxation On the other hand there are those who contend that no such consequence will follow, that the more money the Government gets the more it will spend, and that the only way to colored retrenchment will be to refuse revenue Certainly Retrenchment has not begun yet to any very definite extent A return recently put before the Legislative Council shows that in six years our revenue has grown from four and a half to seven and a half millions, but the expenditure has grown to eight and it quarter millions, and in nine out of seven successive j ears the expenditure has' been more than the income of the year The revenue was of course run up in the land sales to squatters under the operation of Sir John Robertson s land law The land BJICS have been stopped, but the rate of expenditure created has not been stopped, and rather than retrench the Government is making up by new taxation that it no longer gets by selling land The Council wants to bring the expenditure down to something like what it was five years ago, but the Government shows no inclination whatever to adopt any such course On the contrary, it has proposed and carried a railway programme that will not only in volve new loans, but more taxation to meet the new debt, though there is not a ghost of a chance of any but the city extension line paying 4 per cent on the expenditure, but the plans were all approved either without division or by very large majorities Hardly a single line would have been taken on its merits by itself, but there were a sufficient number grouped to carry them all It has become a matter of common remark that it is easier to carry a large railway policy^hanaamallone. Of course there were objectors, but they were members whose constituents were already provided for the Munster a recommendation of each line was brief and perfunctory in the highest degree He knew they were safe, and that the less he said the smaller was the opening for comments No proof whatever was offered that the existing traffic would support a railway, and the claims rested on the new settlement and cultivation that would result. In the lucky district-, there have been enthusiastic rejoicings Ministers have been printed to the skies, the opposing members have been burnt in effigy), and the price of land has gone up The duty of repentance has not let been fixed Mr Garrett, who has come back from 1 England in full vigour has made an attempt to defeat the Speaker on his ruling about continuous sittings He might as well have attempted to pull down the moon The first decision, whether right or wrong, was arrived at by a party vote, and as parties have not changed since, Mr Garrett's attempt to get the question reconsidered on its merits was simply a waste of time The first section of the Homebush Waratah line has been opened this week, though with out any formalities it is part of the line that will join Sydney) to Newcastle, and has an interest for Victoria because it completes the link between Melbourne and Brisbane A tsoiueluture duty, should a talked of line from Forbes to Werris Creek be carried out, it will be possible to go from Melbourne to Brisbane without passing through Sydney at all, but for the present the route lies through the metropolis The section just opened has a distinct suburban value, and makes accessible a very healthy and picturesque part of the metropolitan county, which has hitherto been kept back for want of facilities of transit The ground rises to an elevation of 600ft above sea level, and the whole district has long been celebrated for orchards and oranges Lucky) speculators, amongst whom is it fair sprinkling of members of Parliament, have picked up all the choice spots near the stations and for ten miles along the line the land is being rushed into the market Whether, however, it will all be sold at the expected profit, especially after so much has just been alienated on the Illawarra line, is somewhat doubtful The latter was very much sought after by artisans and it is they who give the best prices. The land on the Hornsby) line will be more in request for family residences of a superior order. The Government itself is also a seller, having held back a large part of the 1 lead of Mars Common till this new line had made it accessible Our protectionists have been so much on couraged by the assistance rendered to them by the present Government that they have formed a new organisation, intended to be bigger and more potent than any other and at a meeting held last night it was stated boldly that we must not only have as much protection as i lists in Victoria, but more, and that the Government of the country ought to be more in the hands of the natives Mr O'Sullivan stated that there were already 100 members in the House favourable to a tax on the imported agricultural produce, and that at the next election he or 60 protect houses would be returned he also hazarded the prediction that as within the next four weeks Sir Henry) 1 arkes would leave New South Wales for Great Britain The farewell banquet to Sir John Robert- son was not attended by more than 40 persons, which was thought to be rather a small number, but the company made up for that deficiency by enthusiasm Of course there was no political significance in the de luoitslratiou Mr Dalley, who took the chair, was the man who carried through the Legislative Council the bill that repealed Sir John Robertson's land law, and after having shown as a legislator what a fiasco free select i tion had been he could not call for bumpers in honour of the father of free selection, so he directed on his personal merits But a farewell to a great politician without any re- fi fence to his politics was necessarily a some what weak allan- and Sir John Robertson's own speech was a remarkably poor one for the occasion 11s talked about his accident, spoke of the ten that had been associated with him, and regretted that the colony had fallen on bad time There was no attempt at a review of his work, no giant e forward at coming questions the colony has lost during the week one of its millionaires-Mr. Thomas Walker of Yaralla, for many years president of the Bank of New South Wales. He died worth a million and a quarter, the probate duty on which, under the new 5 per cent tax, will give the Government a sum of Ui2 000 The bulk of his property goes to his daughter, a lady who is of age, but still un- married The sum of £100,000 is left to found a convalescent hospital on a portion of his estate on the Parramatta River set apart for the purpose, and £20,000 is distributed in charities at the discretion of his executors Mr. Walker was originally a merchant, prospered in the good times, took care of what he made, was prudent in his investments, and always lived well within his income. He married late in life, and lost his wife a few years afterwards he lived comfortably but plainly on his estate at Yaralla, his habits being abstemious, not from pe seriousness, but on dietetic grounds. He rarely entertained, but was very fond of reading and the conversation of intelligent people He took no public part in politics, but occasionally burst out with a letter to one of the papers. He was a stout freetrader, and belonged to the old school of political economists, and was a determined opponent of the attempt to force agriculture by bribing people into it. He was liberal in his private benefactions, but his income of late years must have been very large and he could hardly have spent more than a tenth part of it Another old identity has also passed away in the person of Mr James Byrnes, of Parramatta, who was one of the early settlers in that historic township He came to the colony when a child, his father being a soldier in the 102nd Regiment He had been a successful merchant, but in the bad times lost what he had made he was returned to Parliament several times, and was twice Minister for Works. in his old age he accepted the situation of valuator to the Railway department, which he held up to some time in the present year he lived to be 81 years old 'The city has been again attacked by one of those outrages on a defenceless woman, of which we have previously had two or three. There are whispers that the girl's statements may have to be somewhat modified, but the doctor's examination leaves no doubt whatever that she was brutally used Those who know something of what goes on in the dark and in secret places tell us that such things happen not infrequently, and certain it is that the men who manage to live while idling about, and who fall into the sins of idleness, are only too numerous
