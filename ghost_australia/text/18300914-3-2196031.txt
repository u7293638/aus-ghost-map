Select Poetry NIGHT PIECE, TO JULIA. [By HERRICK.] Her eyes the glow-worm lends thee, The shooting stars attend thee, And the elves also, Whose little eyes glow Like the sparks of fire, befriend thee. No will o' th' wisp mislight thee ; Nor snake nor slow-worm bite thee ; But on thy way, Not making a stay, Since ghost there is none to affright thee. Then let not the dark thee cumber ; What though the moon does slumber, The stars of the night Will lend thee their light, Like tapers clear without number. Then, Julia, let me woo thee, Thus, thus to come unto thee, And when I shall meet Thy silv'ry feet, My soul I'll pour into thee.
