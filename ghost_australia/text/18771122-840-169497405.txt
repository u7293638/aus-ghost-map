THE BELLS. To the Editob. — Sib, — Most residonts in Brisbane are, I suppose, aware that tho bells for which they subscribed aru in the ship Deoapolia and may, boforo long, bo hung in tho bolfry of St. John's Church ; and, doubtless, hundreds anticipate tho ploasinfr and cherrv music of thoso bolls, reviving, as they will to many per sons, a orowd of memories of the past — ohequorod memories they may bo, but not the less profi table. Now, sir, thoro aro three things connected with thoso bells, which I venture to think, ro quiro airing a little, viz. : — 1\. They aro not quito paid for, or rather tho oommittoo has not received the whole of tho money disbursed, and although an outsider, I talte tho liberty ot stating this, that those .who nre ablo and willing to give may know that thoir gifts will be acceptable. 2\. — I am told that the Municipal Council will not allow tho belfry to bo covered with wood, and that, theroforo, galvanised iron will be used, to the risk, as eomo think, of having a ' vari ation' iu tho muBic whioh is not in the con tract. Now wood could be made to look much better than the iron, and therefore, -would be no detriment to even ' a first-class seotion.' 3\. — It is said that there are a few persons in Brisbane who will try to prevent the bells being rung. I could not have believed that any personcould havo so little appreciation of music, finA nin wJlIinf* +n lir\nn tlinf fLnwn nMmf Via Hull out lYJJMUg LU Wjyu bUUI/ t/Uti£tl U1UBI/ UO some mistake. Apologising for intrusion upon your space. — Yours, &c;, A LOVER OF 'THE BELLS.' Brisbane, 2lBt November, 1877. [The bolfry is covered with wood, and tho Municipal Counoil has not taken any aotion in matter. It will be time enough to defend the ringing when somebody tries to prevent it. It is easy enough to raise ghosts in order to lay them again, but it iB a waste of timo and power. — Ed.]
