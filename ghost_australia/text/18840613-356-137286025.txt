WOMEN'S VOTES. AT a Women's Rights meeting at Hampstead (quite a rosewater and drawing room affair), a Mrs. WESTLAKE movedâ€”" That in the opinion of this meeting the coming Reform Bill, to be satisfactory, should include provisions for extending the franchise to duly qualified women householders." She contended that the claim of women householders was at least equal to that of the 2,000,000 male who were admitted to the franchise by the new Reform Bill, and protested against the continued inclusion of women in the category of minors, criminals, lunatics, and idiots. There is very little doubt that women as well as ghosts decide many elections, but is not the present system of " Women reigning and male voters governing," by far the more convenient system of suffrage ? Suppose the ladies had a vote, and disagreed with their hus- bands as to which candidate was worthy of support.. Why many fami- lies would be disfranchised by husband and wife voting oppositely ; and in those households where the kitchen poker and the flat-iron were the most conclusive arguments, there would in- deed be trouble. But the worst evil is the last. What would the husbands think if handsome young candidates for parliamentary honours called with blandishments on their consorts during the canvass? The lords and masters would have to stay away from work, and wait for the would be M.P. with "a dog and a double-barrelled gun." No, no. Let the women mind the kye, the kitchen, and the spinning wheel, while the men win the bread and elect the legislators. A little hint from the ladies goes far to govern the votes, however.
