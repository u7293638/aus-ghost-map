Flotsam and Jetsam. Ode to the Mosquito. J. V. CHENEY. COULD thorns and thistles sprout a lung Through which their sharpness might be sung; Were nettles like a baby born To yell from darkness till tho morn; Were Hade* housed In one small thing, Could oiu-ses buzz abont and sing, Hot taper torments serenade With whinea on flying Add—a played ; Had slivers w'ugs and heinous heart To act the true rttsissln's part ; Did evil batpb itself through flies, Avernian atoms in disguise— Thou murd'rous mote of midnight air, Straight could I plaoe ye then and there. Whence sally thy ferocious flock As slowly my rheumatio olock Goes hobbling through the solemn hours ? Whence come thoae pricking powers, Minute, atilettoed villaniee, To sap the vitals of mine ease? What mighty midge, in conscience' stead. Disturbs the refuge of my bed, Or nausea on infernal route To drain life's very fluid out? ' O water-risen dip'tral devil, Thon starved wizen runt of revel; O empty wickedness with wings, Thou iugeot-lmp equipped with at—gs ; O awl for flesh of human kind, '■ ■ Gaunt gimlet with a miner's mind ; Thou pestilence ou pinions gray, Thou embryo eagle mad for prey— What still mora cussed can I say, Thou hornet's ghost tiirried t'other way*
