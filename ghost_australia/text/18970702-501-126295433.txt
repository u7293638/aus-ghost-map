A Brigand Guillotined A Paris correspondent of the Daily Telegraph say's that on Tuesday, May 11, M.Deibler guillotined a Corsican brigand; named Manaccia, at Bastia. The guil lotine was taken, from the out-house of the local theatre at 2 a.m., and was put up on the Place d'Armes in the presence of a large crowd, kept bnck by formi dable contingents of troops and gend armes. Manaccia was sound asleep and snoring heavily when M. Arrighi, acting for the Procureur-General, ordered him to be aroused. The bandit bounded from his iron cot at the dreadful sum mons, and then fell back half dazed as he saw the cell crowded with people, and realised that his hour had come. Dr. Saliceti, attached to the prison, gave him a glass of Chartreuse, which he eagerly drank, and then plaintively exclaimed, ' It is not possible. The President' of the Republic cannot have rejected my appeal for pardon, for T killed' nobody. I am innocent of the crime of murder, I tell you all.' M. Deibler and his men next appeared, nnd the bandit allowed himself to he manacled without resisting. He then heard Mass, and listened to the exhortations of Abbe Risterucci, the prison chaplain, who urged him to re pentance. Shortly after four o'clock the condemned man was put into a vehicle by Deibler's men, and conveyed to the Place d'Armes. Manaccia was as pale as a ghost as he emerged from the huge van, refusing the help of Deib ler and the chaplain. After a long, l*;iiiAitaji iwn nu nut guiiivsisiiiCj ctiiu c* glance at the crowd assembled to see him die, the bandit was put down on the bascule, and his head was soon off. Brothers of Mercy, cowled and girdled, recited the prayers for the dead around the guillotine, and nfterwards carried the remains to the cemetery. M, Deibler and his men do not seem to have been molested by anybody.
