RAILWAY NEGLECT. TO THE EDITOR. Sir—On Monday evening last the driver of tbe engine from the_ Port never sounded the whistle on approaching the level crossing at. Bowden. I was very near to him at the time, and called the attention of a lady to the fact; nor did he sound the whistle before stopping at the Morphett-street crossing. I called the same lady's attention to it, and also several others who were in the carriage at the time. I also •poke to the person who took the tickets about It, and he seemed to treat the matter very cavalierly, but before I left the platform he came to me and said he hoped I would take no farther notice of it, as the driver was a new hand. Feeling then that I did not desire to injure the driver, and supposing it would be a warning not to commit the same thing again, I refrained from mentioning the matter, hut am Induced to do so now because I saw last evening again a level crossing passed by a train without •▼en a ghost of a warning given. I know not if the engine was driven by the same person or not, neither is that of any moment. The lives of the public are not to be placed in jeopardy by careless drivers, and I leave you, Mr. Editor, to deal with this matter as you deem best for the tiuhlic welfare. I am, Sir, &c.;, PEEVENTION.
