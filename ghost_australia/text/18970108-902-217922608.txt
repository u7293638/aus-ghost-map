OSSIAN. The ghost of Ossian has appeared at Crieff ! But, after the manner of ghosts, it made no revelation. The farmer and his 'man ' who were privileged to see the ghost had not even the courage of Hamlet to call on the ghost to wait till they came up to it. They fled to Crieff to tell their experiences to the wondering crowd. It was in the ' Sma' Glen,' a favourite drive from Crieff for the visitors to the hydropathic, that the ghost appeared. The farmer and his man were with a flock of sheep, and when near Ossian's grave they saw a dark shadow rise out of the ground and spread itself out into a cloud of smoke. And after that another dark shaft shot out of the ground with a hissing sound, and the brave men could stand no more. They fled at their best speed to Crieff. What became of the sheep we are not told, and it is only to be hoped that none of them were missing after the terrible apparition had run its course. Ordinary people, who are not gifted with the rich imagination of the Celt, might wonder whether the two had been employing the long summer evenings in reading ' The Arabian Nights,' for the way in which the dark shaft shot out of the ground, and then spread out in smoke, is precisely like the way in which genii used to spring out of the ground in ancient Persia ; and in that case it is plain that the farmer and his man have missed a fortune at the very least by not waiting to see the development of the cloud of smoke. Some people have been unkind enough to suggest that it was market night when the ghost of Ossian appeared, but it is well known that the ghost of Ossian has long since ceased to observe any distinction between a market night and any other, and, besides, market nights are now periods not of hilarity but of sober sadness for the Scotch farmers.
