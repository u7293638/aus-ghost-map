CIfA"l'TtIl IV. A wienrand ghott-like scen-e was presented npon that lonely beach under the bright moon light as 1)a-h dropped upon his knees on the swet sand, and leaned over tle pale, stark face of thie dead girl. Even while he knelt beside her it seemed as though those sequisitely-forme t lips wuld part, and from the peally teeth wouhl cnne a sweet voice, asking, "Where am It' Jnstinctively he bruhied the damp hair n-i-le, and laid his h: el, on the fair fore, head. It ewas cold-icy cold, and a chill ran through his frame as thonugh he had laid his warmn hwl upon a statue carved out of ie. With a heavy sigh, he arose to his feet and stepped over and glanced at the mnlliun he had stricken to the earth. Kneeling, he Flaced: his hand over the manaC heart. ITe lived ; and, with the muttered remark: "It is hard to :i'l such saoundrels." Dash re turned i td olnteilni!ated the white feure of the Whileo le gazed his eye fell ulan an ohije: that glittered like a epolk of tire. A closer in- plction prove.J that it was a brilliant jewel that gliateled ultnot the girl's linger. 1ie stooped, as though ahout to remove it, when a nervousi repuls:on caused hin to start back and e'claim: " No; I cannot rob the dead !" Then his eyes fell nupla two other jewels that sparkled in the girls ears. " What shall I do? If I leave these jewels glittering upon that girls person and go for assistance, ome other vandal like yon scanmp may conme along and possess himself of them," he muttered. After reflecting a moment, lh added : "I will remave them and hold them for the friends of the dsad girl." Daslh was mlnro succe;sful than the robber had been, andI had but little ditliculty i re moving the jewels.

Inseticivelyhe turne:d, as though to run "I sneman n harmnn, bat i mnst protect my self," hie nidttredt, ad with a cat-like step lhe moved away. After proecedinga short distance he a.eeonded the hIank that lined the beach, nod mtosing stealithily alon, retraced his steps to a point opposite to where Ce the dy fa'r. IIe had bItt just time t- conceal himself when a party of four mnen, carrying a lantlern with them, reached the sist where the white tigure Inv.

"There has been foul murder here,"said one of the men, as lie held hli lanttnl down over the face of the dead girl. "It has been a doubldo murder," cried an othler of the men, as Ils eye fell upon the forn of the maln. "No, by thunder! This fellow live," he added, after a moment, as ihe felt the wourwIed nlan's pullse. "Yes; I live," came the response in feeble tone'. "What has happenet ?" asked the ment in choru, a; they gathered round. "Give me a drink tir't; I amt dying of tlhirk." One of the newcomers had a flask with him, and put it to the nman's lip;. The latter drank, and seemed greatly re vived, when he said : "A terrible crime has just been committed lefere mly eyes." "STell albount it, qutoek ! There may yet be a chance to capture the assassin." T' lle ftl preltende I to b very muchl over coant by tin terrltle scone he had witnessed, and alo? to feel had from tle effiects of the blow ie h:ad re -c?ved ; but taking another good pull from thie lask, ie said : "I was walking along the lenela, when I raw a struggle going on in a Inat alittle off the ,hore be.wecen a man and a woman. Thle man finally seized an oar and struck the girl a blow Io tile Iack of tthe head,and shl fell overboart, when the man sailed away." " And this is the girl that was mnatered?" " Yes; I recovered the bodoty after an hiner's labour, and- had just suoeeeded in hauling it ashore, when the aasasiin returned. Ife as saunlted me, and a struggle followed, but with the same oar with wllieh he crushed in the skull of the girl lie laid me out, then robbed the body of the girl of several valuable jewel", and escaped." Dash heard the Wtiole story, and would have rushed downt and denied it; but, alas ! circnm stances were against hitm. The girl's head had been clrshed by a blud geon, anld lie really had the jewels on his per i,on, althoilghl for no unlawfuil prpose.
