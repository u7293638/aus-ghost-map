A GHOSTLY SOCIETY. LonnDox is to have one more intel lectual society-the new one to be devoted to the promotion of psycho logical research. The members are to recount their dreams and the ef'oct of them retrospectively or lrospoc tively, wha~t communications in their time they may have received from the othler worid through supernatural agents, ghostly or otlherlwise. The conditions and qualifications ofmem bership are not too exacting; men with the welkest possible inte3eoot will be freely enrolled and " no ques tions asked." But they must believe in ghosts and apparitions, extend their mental vieiou beyond the boundary lines of this contemptible little globe, and thus in theirday and generation add to the sum of human knowledge and research in an un explored region which, up to. the present, like the North Pole, resolutely refuses to reveal itself to human ken and become the subject of human in vestigation.
