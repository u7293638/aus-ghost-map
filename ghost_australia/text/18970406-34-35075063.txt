ELECTRIC LIGHT FOR UNLEY. At a meeting of the Unley Town Council on Monday evening Councillor Trathan movedâ€” "That the town clerk be instructed to proceed to Victoria and Sydney for the purpose of ob- taining information in the matter of electric lighting of the town of Unley." This was seconded by Councillor Jones, but Councillor Ellis took exception to it and proposed that the consideration of the question be ad- journed for three months. He argued that this was not the proper time to bring up this matter. The council had as many expenses as it could possibly cope with owing to the damage done by the recent floods. The roads were in a very bad state. Besides this the services of the surveyor could with great difficulty be dispensed with at present. Then again the ratepayers of Goodwood ward were agitating for separation, and it would not be right to put them to any unnecessary expense which the absence of the town clerk would entail. Councillor Nixon seconded the amendment, which was supported by Councillor Moule. Councillor Trathan replied that it was highly necessary to get this information, and no more satisfactory way could be proposed than to send the town clerk, who knew exactly what they wanted. There was not the ghost of a chance of getting any satisfactory system of lighting from the Gas Company, and the light they had was not nearly so good as it should be. He had been assured that if a general poll of the ratepayers were taken his action would be supported by a large majority. Councillor Ellis contended that no action should be agreed upon until after a poll. The amendment,however, was defeated, and the original motion carried by four votes to three.
