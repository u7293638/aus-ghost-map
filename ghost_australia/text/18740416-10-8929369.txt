HAMILTON RACES. 'i' TO' THE EDITOR OF THE MERCURY. ) I Stand-In reading the report of the Hamilton races ] in your issue of to-day, I noticed a very grave error, which 'if not refuted, would lead the public to suppose that the stewards acted most unfairly and i unjustly in awarding stakes not honestly won. Mr. W. Langdon's (not Longland's) Monte Christo jumped the second hurdle, Nimrod and the other 1 horses balking Although I was not on the course, li was on the bank immediately above the second fence,' and within about fifty yards of it, a position which gave me a clear view of the jump ; had a flag ' been there, Monte would have knocked it down, The race was the reverse of being a fast one, but from the beautiful style of Monte's jumping it was easy to perceive that the doughty Nimrod had not the ghost of a chance, the winner was hard held throughout, and came in in a canter. I am, jour^voryJtruly, A CORRESPONDENT.
