ENGLISH GOSSIP. (BY OUR SPECIAL. 00_-E_fO_T>__T.) LONDON, MAY 1. The Queen returned last night from Grasse. She had a very rough passage across the Channel, but she is a good sailor the Prince Consort was emphatically not- and landed in excellent health and spirits. She made herself exceedingly popular at the Riviera by appearing much in public, and being most gracious all round. Of course, her Highland and Hindoo servants were highly attractive to the local globe vouches. Why should her Majesty, by the way, reserve all her suavity for the Highlands or foreign watering places ? To put the matter quite plainly and bluntly, she is not liked in London, because she lots Londoners know that she does not like them. I have often been in London crowds when the Queen was passing by, and have never heard a word of enthusiasm about her among the poorer class. On the other hand, everybody is fond of the Prince of Wales. A few days ago a celebrated London character passed away. She was an apple woman, who all her life had sat by her basket in Piccadilly, and her life had indeed been a long one, for she was 104 at the date of her death. She was, therefore, a grown woman when the battle of Trafalgar was fought, and she might have sold pippins and nuts to Nelson and Collingwood. When she was born New South Wales was a tiny penal settlement, and she was a woman rather advanced in life before railways, gas, telegraphs, photographs, and Alan two steamers were known. And yet, probably, as long as she could get a good price for her apples she never thought about these things. I remember a very old woman in the country who, when disturbed, used to say, " Now then, are the French coming P " She had retained the phrase from the time of the wars with Napoleon. One is struck with the wail of melancholy and despair that pervades the new literature which comes to as from the north and east of Europe the dramas of Ibsen and the novels of Tolstoi. To Ibsen, in particular, Swinburne's lines about " the lilies and longings of virtue, and the roses and raptures of view" would have no meaning. Virtue is nauseous to him, but then vice has no charms. The Ibsenito philosophy may be summed up in a few leading propositions. Stupid people are occasionally good and occasionally happy ; wise people are never good and never happy. Whenever a woman thinks at all He thinks outrageously. Marriage is a mistake, but so also is free love All this philosophy is prominent in " Hedda Gabler," which was played for five nights last week at the Vindonllc It is a play not so full of the hospital and the charnel house as " Ghosts," but nearly as horrible and quite as sod Hedda is a young lady who has lost all traces of morality, and merely retained a vogue passion for a. sthchoisni She marries a worthy man for his money, and li to him before the honeymoon is over She then gathers round her a number of people whom justly because she montes to adultery and suicide, and in other ways wrecks their happiness Finally she shoots herself with a pistol, Some very careful to do it in a becoming and in? athletic way Now, strange to say, such a monster of wickedness is meant to fascinate the audience , more strange, she actually does so She is more hideously wicked than the Queen in Shakspeare's ghastly tragedy of ' Titus Andronicus," yet somehow we cannot loathe her. The dramatist has almost made us by impassive with her at any rate she does not disgust us Victor Hugo also caused us to sympathise with Lucretia Borgia, but then his Lucro tin was not altogether bad, and Hedda Gabler has not a redeeming point in her character There must be real power in a dramatist who can so turn to pay - turvy all one's feelings , but whether the topsy fairness is a wholesome experience may well be doubted I may add that the part of Hedda was wonderfully well acted by Miss Elizabeth Robins, a young actress v. whose performance in this play quite astonished even his warmest admirers She should have a great future before her Mr Dion Boucicault's "Formosa" was produced during the long run of victories obtaine 1 by the Oxford crew between 1869 and 1878 It is a play full of absurdities The Oxford crew are trained by a retired prize-fighter, whose method of teaching the art of rowing is at once original and popular He makes the crow seat themselves Aspendale on a. fallen tree, and swing backwards and forwards, pretending to row, but having no oars in their heads When by coaching of the kind they have become accomplished oarsmen, the scene changes to London The Oxford stroke now chooses as eligible training quarters the villa of a lady belonging to the demi-monde Excited by these manly preparations for the race the Oxford coxswin-played by an actress-is seized with a passion for athleticism So ' be a very obvious shortages boxing lessons, shrieks prettily and faints On the eve of the boat race the Oxford stroke is carried off to a sponging house, but he is bravely and generously rescued by the C unbridgo crew with fire escapes at the dead of night Now all is ready for the boat-race, whereon the Oxford stroke towards his rescuers by beating them hollow Finally the prize-fighter and his wife discover that "Formosa the lady of the demi-monde is their daughter, weep over her, and recall her to the paths of virtue Absurd as it is, " Tonnosa " had a rather long run To lion it was first put on the stage, but I doubt whether the public will send it again However, the experiment is to be tried, and " Formosa " will shortly be revived at Drury Lane Mrs Langtry has been engaged to play the principal part Miss Ellen Ferry 9 am on the stage as soon as she was able to toddle, and, therefore, one would think that she not or know what " stage fright " was Once, indeed, I saw her show wonderful presence of mind under most embarrassing circum stances Acting in the part of Portia, she was coming to the front of the stage to deliver an important speech, when the tram of her dress caught in a piece of furniture and pulled her back again The accident was the more likely to make him nervous because the long dried-out train looked particularly ludicrous Yet she did not show the slightest sign of trepidation, but calmly delivered the speech where she stood, and delivered it, too, with great effect, that go di the time she was busily engaged in disentangling her train Ivovcrtholcsa oven who suffers at times from stage fright, and in borne " Rermnisconocs " which are appearing in the Aero Renew, she describes it as like nothing else in the world " You are standing there apparently quite well, and in your light mind, when you suddenly feel as if your tongue had become dislocated and was lying powerless in your mouth Cold shivers begin to creep downwards from the nape of your neck and all up you at the same time, until they seem to meet in the small of your back About this time you feel as if a centipede-all of whose feet had been carefully iced - had begun to run about in the roots of your hair Your next agreeable sensation is the break- ing out of a cold perspiration all over you Then you feel as though somebody had cut the muscles at the back of your knees , your mouth begins slowly to op 2, without giving utterance to a tongio sound, and your eyes seem inclined to jump out of your head over the foot- lights At this period it is as well to get off the stage as quickly as possible You are far beyond the hope of any human help" Once, when she was acting at the Royally, she was seized with high flight in its severest form " I had," she says, last sense and strength enough to drag myself off the stage and seize li book, with which, after a few minutes I reappeared, and ignorant bush read my part " A solemn statement has appeared in one of the papers to the effect that, in a certain aquarium a bar it has grown into a herring A canary is just as likely to grow into a blackbird Yet in many directions the old lines drawn by naturalists be tween species are fast disappearing About 40 species of moths inhabiting North China and Siberia have recently been proved to be one and the same special with local variations the Swedish naturalists refuse to recognise the common divisions of trout into brown trout, sea trout, bull trout, and lake trout Brown trout and sea trout will freely breed together, and their offers are equally prolific In foot, a sea trout is merely a brown trout that has taken to migratory habits In like manner a luke trout is a common trout which has become addicted to cannibalism Again, the "land-locked salmon" is no longer believed in All the specimens examined at the Natural History Museum have proved to be trout, and not salmon If those views-and they are those of our most eminent lohthyologists-aro correct, you may still have migratory salitwnuUc in Australia, produced, not from imported eggs, but by a chance of habits in the fish From India has just come a wonderful collection of antelopes' horns It is thought that 40 or 50 years hence this collection will have become most valuable, because the horns of antelopes in India are fast deteriorating in size The reason for this deterioration is not perhaps generally known, nor would it be readily guessed Sportsmen are always anxious to shoot antelopes with fine horns as trophies of the close Thus towel and fewer of the older antelopes, with fully-developed horns, are left alive, and the younger trucks with small horn') chiefly propagate the species The offspring of these young antelopes are imperfectly homes, and their offspring, of course, have still less power of producing his horns In the some way nations of human beings in which men habitually marry very young gradually become beardless or nearly so Among the heads are some remarkably fine specimens of the wild sheep Cona pah) This sheep was accurately described by Marco Polo in his book of times, but nobody believed in it till a very few years ago, when the sheep itself was found in Central Asia I was at Newmarket on Wednesday, where a most distinguished company had assembled to see the race for the Two Thousand Guineas The Prince of Wales was there with Prince Christian and the Duke of Cambridge So also were pro sent the Dukes of Portland, St Albans, Wellington, and Beaufort, and the Dowager Duchess of Manchester and Montrose The latter was accompanied by her husband, Mr H Milner, who is about 40 years younger than his wife I was greatly struck with the winner, Lord Along- ton- Common, who is a son of the celebrated Isonomy Common has an immense stride, and such on easy gliding land of action that it is difficult to see how fast he is moving the great St. Simon had exactly the same sort of gallop, and so indeed have nearly all species of wolves Mr Hurlbort is an American gentleman who two or three years ago visited Ireland He was warmly received by the landlord party, and outrageously crammed by them An Irish landlord, taking up the role of the Cretan prophet, once assured me that " the Irish landlords are the " something est -" hors on the face of the earth, barring the Irish tenants " At any rate, an honest inquirer into Irish agrarian troubles ought at least to listen to the Sea on both sides This Mr Hulrbertdid not do, and his book on "Ireland under Coercion " is full of ludicrous misstatements. But the book exactly suited the Times, which gave Mr Herbert a laudatory review of several columns l long, and bestowed unstinted praise on his veracity and impartiality After the preseason of his book Sir Hurlbort took a somewhat distinguished position in London society and journalism He was under stood to investigating the dynamite conspiracy, and Aamo a welcome guest at the dinner tables of pi minent Unionists, like Lord Rothschild and the D of Westminster About a fortnight ago an action was heard wit was brought by certain actress against Mr Hurl- bert, who is a married man, for breach of promise of marriage She knew him as " Wilfred I Murray," and there had certainly been a I atson between them Now in the course of of her evidence she stated that she had received from him pictures and letters of the most disgusting nature The letters were one hundred and fifty in number Mr Hurlbert s defeat of was the most extraordinary ever heard in a court of justice he declared that he was the victim of a vile conspiracy Wilfred Murray was a man employed in the Secret investigations, who had the power of exactly imitating his handwriting This man and the plaintiff had pi ttted together to levy blackmail and for this purpoFO Murra) find forged all the letters in the witness-box Mr Htirltoit swore positively that the letters were not lue This being so Mr llurlbcrt must certainly be regarded as the most unfortunate of mankind He could not pro- ducts ' Vvilfrod Murray ' nor anybody) who know -cm, or know his handwriting He could not show any undoubted specimens of Alumny s handwriting He could not call an expert to prove the forgery, for he admitted that the handwriting was exactly similar to his own He could not explain why 150 letters had been forged when a dozen would is n.o. 1 even sufficient, nor why the forger, while he was about it, had not sense to sort in one or more of the letters a promise of marriage Finally, he could not deny that at one time he had in his possession, certain pictures of the kind indicated Moi cover the letters contained French phrases which he was in the habit of using and wore dated from places which he had visited If therefore " With Murray" did not stand to Mr Herbert in the same relation as subsisted between Mrs Harris and Mrs Gramp the stars in their courses had fought against the defendant in the end the jury found that there had been no promise of marriage -as, indeed, was evident-but pronounced no opinion on the authorship of the letters Mr Hurlbcrt has now left for the United States for the purpose of of finding Wilfred Murray " It is to be hoped that he will be successful The Royal Naval Exhibition will be opened to-morrow by the Prince of Wales I was at the private view yesterday, and was confirmed in my previous impression that the exhibition would be the most interesting seen in London for many years There is a full-sized model of the Victory and in the cockpit the scene of the death of Nelson is reproduced by means of wax figures These am by Mr J Tussaud, a descendant of the celebrated Madame Tussaud, and I have never seen more successful work in that material In another part of the exhibition may be seen the breeches and stockings worn by Nelson at Trafalgar, and stained with his blood There is a small bone in the ground where to the delight of both adults and children, daily combats will take place between two models of 1 battleships and a torpedo boat The torpedo boat makes across the lake at great speed, and the b battleships sunk it-or appear to do so with their quick firing guns There is an immense display of naval guns, from the smallest size to the gigantic 10-ton Van strong This gun is regarded by almost every officer in the English Navy with extreme disfavour The weapon they like best is the 12-ton gun, which discharges the projectiles weighing 30lbs and this they consider quite heavy enough The motto of the exhib tion consists of the words with which the old notice- of war began, The navy whereon under the good providence of God the wealth safety, and strength of the kingdom chiefly depend " A very funny sight was to be seen a day or two ago at Westminster There was a rel -minus ceremony in the Abbey at which the Archbishop of Canterbury presided.
