GENERAL EXTRACTS. An article in the New York To lining of December 15th, on the mission of General Schenck, is noticeable for the moderation of the spirit in which the old grievance, the Alabama difficulty, is discussed Our New York contemporary say 8 : " It is understood that, with the appointment of General Schenck as Minister to England, the Administration recedes from its position of insisting that the negotiations shall take place in Washington With the sailing of our new envoy, which ought not to be delayed a day longer than is requisite for his confirmation and the preparation of his instructions, the considerations which have formerly induced the Government to insist that future negotiations shall take place at Washington pass out of sight There can be no doubt of the judgment and discretion with which General Schenck Â» 11 execute every commission with which he may be chary,.-!, He will make none other than a just and honourable treaty and any treaty he makes will meet with a favourable reception at the hands of the Senate and the country A better arrangement can probably V C ' t in London than would be possible in Washington 'the British Minister would be hampered by the strict instructions which are a tradition of the English Foreign Office, and by constant apprehension of a jealous public feeling at home If the negotiations are conducted in London, the Cabinet must decide with full knowledge of all circumstances touching the American demands, and can determine, better than could any ambassador, just how much of national pride and prejudice can safely be sacrificed for the purpose of remedying a great wrong and averting a great danger Besides, if an arrangement be consummated between General Schenck and the British Ministry, the whole Government and its supporters in Parliament will be at once rallied in solid phalanx to the defence and maintenance of the measure The work once done would be done finally, and a prompt ratification at Washington would quiet for over this vexing and perilous controversy There are many reasons why an effort should at this time be made to arrive at a term of this dormant war between the United States and England It we can judge anything from the outgoings of prominent organs of public opinion, and from the more cautious and more authorised utterances of public men, it would really seem that the time has come when the English Government is ready to meet us in the discussion of the Alabama claims on a basis compatible with our rights and honour That this anticipation is shared by the Administration seems to us to be indicated by the appointment of General Schenck He would not be offered, nor would he accept the mission to England as a term of honourable and gilded exile He would not be sent, nor would he go, except under the assurance that a reasonable prospect exists of finally putting to rest this harassing and unwholesome quarrel " The following amusing account of the ex-Emperor's retirement at Wilhelmshoho is given by the New York To these -" Last spring it was thought he could not survive the year.

There is a vote of want of confidence in Mr. Gladstone us helmsman for a stormy time being passed silently through England, and unless that vote can be recalled or cancelled it will be more fatal than any vote of the House of Commons. Stutosinon smile very justly at noisy meetings of nobodies hold in Trafalgar-square, but those meetings are symptoms of an unrest, a dissatisfaction which, though it may be as yet only dissatisfaction, reaches far higher in the electorate than the attorney who just now makes himself the mouthpiece of the mob. The desire is not for war-many of the most discontented are most anxious to avoid war nor is there any scheme of military reform which has caught or is likely to catch the public fancy ; but there is a deep, half angry longing for a Government which shall be strong abroad, which 'can give Bismarck as good as he brings,' upon which allies can implicitly depend, and which must be treated by every Cabinets of Europe as an equal power." Judging from a description given in a recent number of the Nea York- Training of the character of life in Memphis, residence in that city would appear not to be favourable to one's chances of tongo ii ty. " There," says the Tribune, " the pistol is as common in the hands of men at the post-prandial toothpick as other pUoasMberctaelitUo irascible man is alike arbitrator and exeautionor-thoro disagreement is adjusted by discharges, and a pellet of lead cures the favor of indignation thorn, if a man owes you and will not pay, insults you, and will not apologise, is exclusive of and will not drink whiskey with you, gets the better of you in argument and offensively boasts of it, cheats or is cheated by you at cards or billiards or nine pins, and is noisy about the little irregularity, everything is made serene by sending the disagreeable person to the cemetery. And it must be understood that the Memphis potato demands the very highest peppering. whose pulling is there considered effeminate. Caning and unwinding are milky-aqueous expedients. Posting is no more serious than boys' play. The true chevalier of Memphis is like the giant in the nursery rhyme he is always smelling blood, and always declaring that he will have some. He surpasses in nicety of honour the most minute of historical swaggerers-ho will cavil not to the ninth only, but to the ninety-ninth part of a hair. Ah, what a cheerful, serene, delicious town to reside in ! There is, indeed, the drawback, that although one may be nicely reduced to a donation body,' it may not always be in OIIO'H own quarrel. The little balls have a way of coming round the corner and lodging in the wrong bosom, while the blackguard whose business it is to be shot disgracefully runs away. The pis- tokens of Memphis, it must be acknowledged, are a little arbitrary and indiscriminate.

that poor scamp and broken-down rowdy, Pierre Bonaparte, which make the man look on the whole, rather better than one might have expected Pierre writes to the Emperor on the 19th March, 1867, asking permission to man the woman who was the mother of his children He acknowledges with touching native that it had not originally entered into his intention to impose on himself the ceremony of marriage, but he is ready to undergo it in order to make his children legitimate he added the expression of ' a painful reflections grumble because the Emperor will not allow him to be come a member of the
