FAITHFUL UNTO DEATH. By wintry sun's declining glow A wanderer found, Modelled in freshly-fallen snow, A curious mound. Was it tho humor of the storm, Or Nature's jest, -To mimic thus a fowl's plump form - i And roundod nest ? , -Not so, — for when tho snowy mask Ho brushed aside, A duck sat patient o'er her task There— as she died. Huddled benoath tho downy breast Sweet treasures lay, Which sho with anxious caro had pressod That cruel day. And braved long hours the blinding flakes, The wild wind's moan, And crushing cold, — all for their Bakes, Her nestling own. i No mato to cheer with voice or food; — The laBt friend gone, — Sole guardians of a numerous brood,— She still sat on : Nor ever in that bosom stirred i Of doubt a ghost, " But, mother-like, tho simple bird Died at her post. Rest well, fond martyr, lovo endowed, With lovo content; The whitest snow shall build thy shroud And monument.
