JEEMS KAYE'S CONVERSA ZIONE. I am, yours,—JEEMS KAYE (in the Baili[?]). Dear Bailie, —We held an annual conver [?]z[?]one in the kithen o’oor S:ra'bungo resi dence Hogmanay. As it wis getting late Betty says, “Bairns, ye had better awa tas yer beds. Jeem», ye usually address a few. words o' advice on the last day .o' the year; jist .say swa'. 1 an’ we'll a' be quiet. Whist, bairns, an* pay attention: noe Jeema. “Bairns," says I, taking a sip:'o’ toddy, this is the last time your a*ul<l faither 'll see you “ This year, ye mean,” says Be'ty. : “ Ay, sy, of course—l nia jist cornin’ tae that this year, brims. ’ When ye wauken to morrow the knell' will have struck——" “ Wha struck ye wi’ a mell.Mr Kaye?” says Mr Meiklejohu—he's a mason, an'a wee deaf. “The knell. Mr Meiklejohn, the knell— there's naebody speaking abuot mells—the knell will have Btruck, an' ye’ll a’ be ushered intse —intae——” " Oblivion," suggested Mr M'Cunn. “No,.that's no’ the word,” says I; “ intae— intae—hucb, nevermind—to- morrow we’ll torn owera new leaf, an’ we'll a' be ayear aulder— a source o' rejoicin’ tae you young aneßj but, alas, alas 1 •" . “What are ye saying aboot lassies?'' says Betty., “ Tut, tutl it wis poetry; ye've put it a' oot ■my heid noo. I. wis going tae gie ye a few words o' advice: Aye be contented an' thankfu' for your privileges; for they are tuony; born in the maist enlightened country in the world— the land o’ Wallace, an' Bruce, an’ John Knox, an' Jeems.Martiu, an' the Schule Brod, ye ha’e naetbing tae be ashamed o' onyway. While being tbankfu' for your privileges, never be envious, and be wishing for things ye ha’e nae need for. I’ll tell ye a story aboot.that. A travelling menagerie once visited Kilbrachan; the collection, though smi' had one Vvera big elephant. Trade wie bad, .an’ the show wis seined by a sheriff .officer for debt. Taeiaise money the proprietor ri-ffltd the elephant at sixpence a ticket, an’ a Kilbarchan weaver wis the fortunate winner; so he put a string roon its neck an’ led it awa’ behind him quite prood. When be got hame be couldna get a boose tae pit it iu; it couldmf go intae the washing boose or the coal cellar, or ony ither place, so ns be didna ken what tae dae wi’t, be jist took it doon the Klmalcolm ro id an' wandered it. That wis an instance o’ a. man getting what be had nae need for. Noo bairns, there'll be use purridge the morn; so, Betty, gie thorn a bit sbortbreid tae eßt in below the claes, an’ let them rin nwa'." The bairns were in bed, Bn' we were n’ sit ting roond the fire wi' oor noses nearly meeting, an’ the gnsscrewed doon tae mak’ us maircosy like, an' Mr Pinkerton was telling us a ghost Story— “ Weel, ye see, the ghost says tae my grand father— Here a terrible smash o’ crystal made us s' jump a:.' look roon; a’ tbe glesses r.n' decan ters, on' tbe platen wi' tbe finnan baddies, were lying on the fliur, Being the owner o' the glasses I Wis speechless; but the rest no’ b ing nffeclit in their pockets, could epeak bravely. “Spiritualism,”says Mr Meiklejohn. “ I doot it'a dynamite,” says Mr M'Citnn. ” Or an earthquake, ' says Mr Pinkerton. “Jist some freak o’ nature,” says I, ns we gathered up tbe fragments, “it's nonsense tae try tae account for everything in this worl’, I believe Borne o' ye tramped on the eu* o' tbe tablecloth an’ drew it doon. Gang on wi’ yer story, Mr Pinkerton.” “ We>T es wis saying, the ghost said tao my grandfather”— Crash went the glesses. again, an' a fearfu’, piercin'ciy wis heard; in fao', tbe folk abio tell’t me the n> zt day they thoebt I bad mur dered some o'my weans. We a'jumped up and held on by tbe backs o' oor chairs, when, tae oor great consternation, a ghost stood in the middle o' tbe floor. It had on a white niglitgoon, an’ nae troosars that I could see, an' its face wis jist tbe colour o' the electric liobt. It walked slowly nwer tae me, an' gaed me a clap on the back, an' says, “ Aba 1 my auld cockalorum.” “ Gracious gnidnes*," says Mr M’Cuun, “I never heard tbe like o' this." “It bates a’," says I, “ca'in 1 me—an elder— an auld cockalorum." The ladies were feotiu' one by one, an' Mr Pinkerton got tbe decanter an’ began to pour water on them. “ Tak care that no' the wrang ane ye ha'e got," Bays I. ” Aha !" says the ghost, makiug n dash at tbe decanter. This made them a' tin in below the table, or up on tho dresser, while Mr Pinkerton got intae tbe presß amang the pole an’ goblets, an’ brandishing a fryingpan he declared he wid brain the first body cam' near him. Then jist, I suppose,, by way o'imitatin’ him, oor auld black cat jumped up on the shelf, an' flew aboot, knocking doon asbete an' sugar bowls at such a rate that it roused my bluid, an’ I made a dash at the ghost, but I flipped up an’ fell headlurg. For tbe meeoit a’ the breath ee med out o’ my body; I’m stoot, as ye ken, Bailie, an’ a tummel on the grun's nae better than it's caed at the best o’ times—far less on a Hogmanay nicht! “There's anither ane fented,” I heard Mr M'Cunn say, as I lay prostrate. I thought tae myeel’, I'm no ane o' yer fentin’kin’; in fac’, fechtin's mair in my heid the noo, I'm Bure, than tentin'. Cryin’ "I'll get tae the bottom o’ a' this," seized a stnoothin'-irou off the mantelpiece an' mad a rin at the ghost, when a gaed a lood craw like a peacock, and grippit me by the ebautber, an’ tore off its nicht shirt. Noo wha wis this but a young sailor lad—a mate, nae less -mate o' the “ Queen o’ the See," or the *' Q seen o’ the Shaws,” or something like that. We a’ emerged frae our hiding places; and after I bad got my breath an’ a glass o’ toddy I took him tae task gae strongly; but as he promised tae buy anew set'o’ cheenfe, an' tak' us a’ tae tbe pantomime the next nicht, I didna Buy owre much. Ye see, Bailie, l>e whiles brings me a slick o' thick tobacco, and Batty wis telling me she thocht he wis after oor Jennet, so as son-in lawa are no' sSe easy got a baud o'i}ooadays,T thocht it best tae let on it wiana a bad joke; only I warned bim never tro ca’ me " an auld cockalorum” again. Bailie, w'ishin’ you a’ tbe compliments o’ the season,
