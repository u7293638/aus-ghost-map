VERBAL INSPIRATION. To the Editor of T/ie Church of England, Messenqer. Sir — A friend who like myself had been listening to our Bishop's admirable lecture on Wednesday remarked to me yesterday, ' What will the upholders of verbal inspiration say to his teaching?' ' What can they say ?' I replied ; 'I believe in verbal inspiration myself, and I see nothing in the Bishop's views to oppose it.' After I got home I turned up Gaussen's Theopneustia, and found the following passage, which I submit expresses nothing different from what we heard at St. Pauls : — ' This miraculous operation of the Holy Ghost had not the sacred writers for its object .... but its objects were the holy books themselves . . . whether the writers recite the mysteries of a past more ancient than the creation . . . . or relate what tliey remember, or repeat contemporary narratives, or make extracts from uninspired documents, their writing is inspired, their narratives are directed from above.' — Faithfully yours, Cbedo. Melbourne, 15th September, 1877.
