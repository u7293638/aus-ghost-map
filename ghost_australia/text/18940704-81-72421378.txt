ORIGINAL. POETRY. The Richmond Heroes. [BY D. R. CAMPBELL.] THE HOUSE is closed, the work is done, Now to their homes the heroes run, Where anxious friends impatient wait To hear what they have to relate. Of mighty works that they have done, Of Bills destroyed and billets won. Could we but hear Tom Ewing tell How Christos cause before him fell, When he in eloquence more grand A listening Senate did command, And proved to them without a doubt That proud Sir George should be turned out, And Federation Parkes sent in: That warrior bold and juggler keen, Who scared away the Fenian host With old Kiama's awful ghost: And with his Treason Felony Bill Their inmost soul with fear did fill; Who to your noble Patriots gave Three hundred pounds a year, to save Them from devouring pangs of want; While they in sapient speeches rant, A handsome sum to them made sure From the hard earnings of the poor. Could we but witness Alston's pride When Perry through the streets shall ride, And Lismore with great bludgeon men Shall hail their hero back again, But rarely doth this hero speak, Except to challenge Paddy Crick. Could we but see the nickel plate When Bairdie Bruce will meet his fate, When angry men will to him say, Woeful the day you went away To hide yourself in some dark room; When bold assaults presaging doom To progress and to thrift were made, And yet you would not lend your aid. Were you afraid to give your vote Or was it by Sir Henry taught? Then will he plead that they are men, If so it will be past our ken, For men will ever manly be, And from Duty's call will never flee.
