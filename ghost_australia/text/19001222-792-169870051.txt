When he had got fairly on the bridge he took off Ms hat and spoke to himself alotld. There was 110 one near him to hear, and his ejaculation was almost ia.prayer. "Thank God that I've lived to see the Old place once morel- j. To think of it! -There's! St. — Mary's - and - -- St. Munchin's,. and the" old ladies' almshouses, and th» Castle Barracks.

"Katherine, will you ' — secret —-- a - thing I'm wanting to tell 'you P it's weighing on my heart." "Of course I will, asthore." "I believe that man is Michael Carrol.'

An'the v ice, Katherine, when this man speaks son.Ktime it has a sound of—of fifteen years ago 5" Here poor Ellen's apron was at her eyes again, and her sister spok> u lit tie angrily, "It's forgotten fifte.;*i years ago ought to be with you .ong ago, Ellen McCarthy!

"Maybe at last I'll see the dav that you'll grow out of your folly, Ellen McCarthy, but just now you're enough to try the patience of a saint," and the good woman fiounced out of the little shop. "Old grass grows green," as Danny persisted in calling him, had certainly purchased and paid for the Clare Farm, but Considine must have made a promise of secrecy as to the name of the purchaser, for he only winked slyly when asked about it. When told Doint blank that the man from Australia was suspected to be no other than Michael Carrol, Considine grinned, but added that he wouldn't swear the man's name was not Carrol, and so Christmas Eve came, and Ellen McCarthy was very busy attending to the children's purchases in her little "huxterV shop, as were termed such little places of business as Ellen's. Somehow the children of the neighbourhood had a great deal more money to Bpend that day than was usual with them, and Ellen reaped the ben«ht of it. She guessed that a good maov of the pennies and sixpences she trr-k across the counter were Christmas toxos" from "old grass grows green," but she took no notice. The day was n'wftys a sad one with her, for she had her yearly vigil before her, and. somehow she expected more from it this yew +han she_ had ever hoped for before The man from Australia went into Limerick that night, and did a little business for himself. For one thing, he bought a new razor, and was particular about its being in perfect order, Then he made a visit to a clothier's, and bought some garments that took some time to select, as if he was trying to match some pattern or other. At last he was suited, and carried MB parcol home in the twilight. When I say home, I mean to the cottage of Mrs. Braban, where he still slept. ^ Then he went dawn to St. John's, and said his prayers with humble thankfulneas. in the little chapel where the Child Christ already lay by the altar in His Crib of greenery. He was not surprised to recognise Ellen McCarthy kneeling at a little distance from him, for he knew well what a deep hold religion had in her true heart. When the man rose and went out there was a joy beyond words in his own heart, and his step was light, as if ten years had been lifted from his head. Not so lightly did Ellen make her way turf fire and recalled that terrible night of her bitter loss. Her wheel was put away in a corner, the firelight flickering on it now and then, making the rolls of freshly-caTded ihly-caTded wool — 1 that shie Jiad laid across the spindle look up -white aud soft snow. But Eflen was not looking at her wheels she was gazing at the red tarf and thSaM&g; of >r dwd lover and the man sbe could not heln still blaming for - bis - s; ttpajm. death. - - - ' "Thev were dressed exact! ictly alito tbat day," she thought sadly; ;.

It was twelve ooiook 'clock When wnen Ellen jkhou left tom her hut and went out info the green yard. It was a "bright flight right, with a sky as clear « a littl£tende^y to frost could make it. +•>« poor woman turned When the round the back of her dwelling she could see th® wooden cross where her lover's blood had been spilled so long^o gleaming white^ the corner, and she saw the long grass wave as the breeze passed It when she knelt by the gate. She knelt with bowed head and prayed with sincere heart. They might laugh at her, poor soul, but all those years she had believed as she believed now that Tom would know of her re- .membrance, — and be -- glad that — she - 1 -- had never called another man husband, but " been faithful to him. Superstition? What is superstition but a belief that the unepiritual mind can never comprehendP 1 ... Ellen must have knelt there an hour when she felt a waft as of wind passing over her bowed head, and lifting hcv loose hair. Looking up, she saw before her, standing at the cross, with one hand up it, "Tom Carrol." The light was full on his face, only the hat shaded it a little, and it was the face of her dead lover, only older-looking and far happier than she lad ever seen Tom look before. She recognised the c6at that he had worn that terrible day, and the necktie with the shamrocks, but there was no blood on tlienil Rising weakly from her knees, she stretched cut her arms to the vision, mid cried out, "Tom! Oh Tom, at last you have come!" and then she would have fallen at the foot of the cross among the grass her own hands had kept so green had it n<5f. been that the arms of "the ghost" enfolded her ere she fell. When Ellen came to her senses she was in her chair by her own fire, and the stranger was kneeling at her Bide, No, not the stranger, but Tom Carroll, her own Tom, who was not dead at all, but a living and loving man. It was some time before she could realise the truth, and she listened. to Tom's explanation as one in a dream. "How you came to take me for Mike is a puzzle to me," he said, "but of course the great cut he got in the forehead and the blood made all the differonce. There was always a great likeness, you know, darling." "Yes," she said, "but your prayerbook was in Ins pocket, and that settled it with us. We never had one thought but that it was you. ' Besides, Tom, I never would have believed that you would have run away and left me for all those years." "You could -never judge what the most loving man would do when hte saw the gallows staring him in the face, my darling Ellen. I thought it was my blow that killed him, and when I saw him stretched fhere the murderer's dread caught me. I could scarcely tell how I got to the ship in Liverpool, for I was like a madman. As for the prayer-book, Ellen, we went to St. John's before we got drinking that night, and poor Michafel had the loan of my prayer-book. Oh, Ellen, Ellen! How I massed those fifteen years craving for the sight of you and of the old home where the grass grows green! I got gold from the first, but I was too big B coward to venture back. At laBt the craving mastered me, and rope or no rcpfe, I said I'd see old Ireland once more. I was afraid ^ you'd be dead or married. Ellen, but I thank Ood you're neither!" "But I'm an old woman, Tom!" "And I'm an old man! Oh, my dprling, there's plenty of time yet to be happy before we go to join poor Mike. And sure he has forgiven me that blow, for my repentance was for his murder that., thank God. did not lie on my head after all. Come across now to your sister and let us tell her he good news. Many a happy day M he'll be with you a,t Clare Farm yet, s lease God!", t That at least was. tKe happiest Christ- g mas that ever either Tom Carrol or Ellen eyer .spent.
