Extraordinary Accident and its Itcsult. The Wagga Advertiser says:—Many- of our readers will remember that Mr. W. Beeson met with an accident some eight months since through falling heavily to the ■ ground whilst engaged in his tanyard, re sulting in a painful injury to his jaw. Having his pipe in . his mouth at the time, it was broken, and not finding the amber stem he thought that he must have swallowed it, or that it was embedded in his jaw. The doctor's efforts, however, led him to think that the injury to his jaw was not due to this cause ; but the fact remains that after the lapse of such a long time— fully eight months—he succeeded on Tues day last in taking the amber mouthpiece from his jaw, thus relieving himself of pain which at times was severe. The amber was in a perfect state, of preservation. There is a new game in Paris. , Tired of all old and threadbare amusements, an actress inaugurated a " Polymorphous fete." The ballroom was turned into, a funeral chamber, and people all came dressed as ghosts, hobgoblins, or phantoms. Coffins were placed about the room, around whicli these cheerful individuals played hide-and seek, puss in the corner, and similar games. A supper was afterwards served 011 a table composed of coffins piled one on the other. There is something awfully cheerful'about this kind of sport.' V.
