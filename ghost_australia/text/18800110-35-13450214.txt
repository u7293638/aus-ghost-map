THE HILL END GOLD-FIELD. (BY OUR OWN REPORTER III. The earlier days of Hill End mining, those that witnessed the beginning of the Hawkins' Hill rush, seem to us, in these latter day developments of crushings, whose richness is calculated by pennyweights to the ton, to have been a period flushed with romance To the few not bitten with the gold fever, it must have scorned an upsetting of the proper order of things, a mild return to the enchantments of the Arabian Nights, that men and women should be raised in a month from squalid poverty to affluence, that ground concealing pockets of gold rivalling the riches of Aladdin's p ditto should be offered for sale for a mere song, that as the fever spreads, company after company (mere bubble) floated gaily) upwards on the mere mention of Haw kins' Hill, and that while steady hardworking men toiled for a bare subsistence, many an improvident scamp dropped upon what would with care he we made him independent then followed the period when big yields were at their biggest, when easily earned gold was squandered like water, and when the public were too much under fortune s glamour to distinguish between genuine investments and those bubble companies which only bunched few designing rogues and nearly destroyed public confidence in mining speculations the third act in the drama was played when fold (gave out at shallow levels and when the deceptive nature of the bubbles became so p urfully evident The curtain was rung down, and though recent news from the Star of Peace and Krohmann's Amalgamated Companies give hope that it will be again raised, the old scenes form so distinctive a drama and are so completely cups valued into one picture, when they will repay retrospection Among the newest and best managed claims on the Hill was Paxton's, which was taken up at the latter end of 1866, and first worked in February, 1867 Four men began to work it at first, but its extent was eight men's ground, 122 feet along the line of reef, by a depth of 300 yards It was taken up in consequence of rich yields in Rawsthorne's claim, but for 18 months the owners were unrewarded for their enterprise, and shaft after shaft was sunk without any payable reef being struck One of these shafts are down 120 feet, and as ventilation was necessary it occurred to the partners that they might come up about 20 feet and drive to another shaft for air, the mere connection of the two serving as every miner knows, to establish a constant current One of the original shareholders one night, or more strictly speaking, one morning i (since it was after midnight), as he went down to do hen shift of work noticed something glitter in the roof of A the drive With a faint hope and expectation of a turnf fortune, he and his mate put in " a copper," that is a tiny blast of powder, and dislodged a piece of quartz, barred with a streak of gold as thick as a kate blade 1 following up the search, they discovered imbedded in the blue rock three narrow v coins of quartz, each gold-bearing still one was only as thick as a shilling, and the other was like a knife blade, and one of Mr P ixton's partners was positive that it would not pay How delightfully was his opinion falsified when this very stone subsequently v yielded 800 oz of gold to the ton Each shift was able to get out half a bucketful of this stone, that is about a cwt n week-some- thing like weekly income of £800 to be divided between four men This continued for some time, and then the vessel "stringers" began to thicken As they did so they became poorer. and developed into years several inches thick, getting, finally, too poor to follow The party then sank, and got payable A veins in the snow, water to. a considerable period went about. 5 o? to the ton, and which were worked profitably in other claims Paxton's party drove south alone; these veins (called the East workings) to the boundary, and then work paid them pretty well, while to the north, towards the Star of Peace boundary it was poor enough "Mr Paxton suspected that they were not on the proper line, and they drove to the westward until they cut three veins that gold was being got Horn in the next claim (called Paxton's) veins they fairly ran told There were the hanging wall vein the middleman, and the footwall vein, varying from six inches totally mJacs in match, and there v ems p-of in the whole length of the claim, AV are we worked down to a depth of 266 feet The veriest tyro in mining can understand this richness when he learns that two tons of the substance (it would be a mistake to call it stone taken from the middle vein, yielded 12 30 o? of gold that is nearly £17,000 worth At this time ten weeks work fielded the bharcholOcis £12,460 worth of the precious metal, and the eight weeks following gave their £28 000 The next crushing went to the rule of £6900, and the following list of crushings may prove interesting - 1870-71 to, 214 tons went (337 oz 16 dw s Se ember 3, 775 tons went 243 oz 18 dwts best mber 1", 00 tons went 3-yo..

The men at Paxton is used to talk of the Hawkins Hill ghost, which haunted] an oil tunnel in the Hill whose opening was near the track followed by those going to and from the mine Mysterious warning sounds and ghostly lights vi ere went to issue from this cavern, and after vainly endeavouring to solve the mystery, the miners all accepted the supernatural theory and in variably put the best leg forward in passing this entrance to Avernus AUSTINS not all, for there was a quick - witted Irishman who determined to look at the innate of the cavern, but he ghost or devil and one moonless me that when all was black as a woman's mouth, Pat removed his boots and stole into the tunnel As he crept along the rough drive the adventurer heard ghostly thuds and groans as though the " mucked homed one were trouncing some poor soul delivered into his power and with his heart in his mouth he thought of retreat But no ' having come so far, ' shining " (whether whisk, or not, doth not appear) egged him on, and as the sound increased, he saw the glimmer of a light, which issued from behind a set con ahead, and convinced them that every thing was natural, Put stole up and looked in there, in a corner, was seated a man, pounding away at a big mortar, while the flicker of a candle, stuck to the wall by a dab of clay, show ed pickle bottle three parts full of gold The pounder a sailing millan, better known than trusted, who worked in a neighbouring rich claim, p used moment to give an unearthly howl, and Pat was just going to rush in and secure him, when a second man came forward and throw into the mod tar a number of specimens, which by the candlelight glittered as if spanDled Two to one seemed too long odds so Pat, in high "leo it his discovery, stole away Next day he disclosed the secret, and planned a laid upon the, but when he and his friends- timed tho of the birds had flown, thou li, of court no one had told them that AulgmlA operating, the plant was springs The other story told how a sergeant of police induced a claimholders to takE unt a vi in r mt to sea ch. t to day telling, of a mysterious person who had purchased a house between HillEndandTambiiooin lhebtinngei did nothing, Yet had plenty of money, and was known to send away 1 large quantities of gold and as the pounding of specimens waging on hero nightly, the sergeant holed by a well-planned raid to pounce upon the of once and his customers together A Billilli st detective helped to lay the snare, and one mid- night the w mine was doned But the force had been beforehand v milk them, for he AVIS quite alone, and though his mouth was full of valuable specimens half-pounded, ho rai used with a foot to six ankle he got them, and as the officers could not prove that he had acquired them in an illegal manner, they had to one of biting their nails Such are the reminiscences of old identities of Hill End, and the most welcome news that one could now afford many a man in Sydney would be that the mines were in such a state that gold mining was likely to flourish again,
