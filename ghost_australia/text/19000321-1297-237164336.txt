THE TRANSVAAL WAR NOTES FROM ENGLAND. (FROM OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT.) LONDON, February 9. THE MEN WITO DIED. Gentlemen, stand for a silent toast, To bo drunk with drooping bead; The incn avlio died at a falling post. Who avon the least, and who gave- the most — To our brave, defeated dead. Ghosts of tlio slain call out to-night From their graves across the sea: "Soldiers slain in a losing light — 'A. wild attack on a mountain height, Or a hopeless charge — aro we. : 5 Soldiers crossing a ford In Rood, . Or led to a false attack; Dragging our guns through seas of mud, Dark'ning tho earth with our heart's best blood, As wo fought our passage back. Soldiers marched through tho sunliurut (lay, "Marched through the cold, chill night Walking asleep; In tho morning grey lu front of the trenches brought to bnyc With an unseen foo to light. Soldiers — pawns of tho Gen'rals' game, Yot with lives to lose or live — Done to dentil on a Held of shame; .Wo gave our lives for our country's name- Wo had nothing more to give." Gontlomon, drlnlc with uplifted head, Proud though tho worst Is faced; Gentlemen, hero's to our honored deari, The men who fought and the rpen who bled— Defeated but'uot disgraced!
