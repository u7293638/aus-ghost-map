;- ^MR.-PRrCE ANT) SPIRITISM:.1 » . • .TO THE EDnOfi. Snt,—It is rather strange that the lecture of.theBev. Mr; Price has been allowed to pass without comments - Saying read your report,!I :am sure many will agree'with. me iu saying that he did not handle his subject so" masterly "as was to be expected from a person holding the high position of Presi dent of the Independent denomination. Take, for instance, his attempt to explain away the acconnt of Saul's interview with the witch of Endor, which differs entirely irom the Bible record, and which I maintain is as correct and truthful as any other part of holy writ. In fact, a miracle was wrought in bringing up Samuel which astonished the witch beiself. I am utterly confounded that administer should state that the plain Bible .record was untrue. Then, what about the ISaints who arose and appeared unto many fat the crucifixion ? and the prophecy re specting the latter dayB, when the Almighty "promised to ponr ont His spirit on all flesh, " and your sons and your daughters shall prophecy, and your young men shall see visions andyonr old men shall dreamdreams," which time St. Peter declared, commenced with . the descent of the Holy Ghost; and hundreds of others which will readily occur to.those who are conversant with the Bible. I do not know whether John Wesley's mind was disordered or not (I have known some of .his followers who were rather queer), but I do.believe that what is stated in the Bible is not to be explained away by Mr Price or any other man. I am not a believer in modern or progressive spiritism, but I think it.will work its own destruction .without in volving the Bible in its fall, and the rev. lecturer will find Bible narratives harder to be demolished than, widows cottages. -II am. &c.;, . ,;;Geelonij,'Julj: 18th; 1874., , . -
