HYDE PARK BARRACKS. Poor old Tim Lane has given up the ghost, and has been succeeded by (the lather-in-law of Mr. Councillor Macdermott,) Lieutenant Small, late of the 51st Regiment. We all remember the affair at a Government Ballâ€”but Sir George evidently believes in the old example of Eton, "sera munquam est ad bonos mores via." We cannot pass over the late Governor of the Gaol without observing that his uncouth manners were neither to be attributed to his head nor his heart. Tim was a kind man though many doubt- less will observe he had a 'quere way of showing it.' We are however better informed than to sup- pose all the bustle and loud talking which he so frequently displayed, was the result of a want of sympathy to those unfortunates under his charge. Mr. Lane's heart has frequently bled at the lash, while his tongue would seem to gloat on the punishment.
