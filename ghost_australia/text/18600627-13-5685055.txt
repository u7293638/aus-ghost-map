A PROTECTIONISTS FALLACIES. (FROM THE BENDIGO ADVERTISER, JUNE 25.1 let go, as no other subject < moment, we take the opportunity of looking into the statements of the pamphleteer. Perhaps the occasion is not inopportune, as the subject has at last been forced upon the attention of the Assembly, and a debate has actually taken place, in which Mr. Embling made a speech in favour of protection of two hours' duration ' For the offence-for it is a grave offence against common sense Mr Embling finds a precedent in the instance of Lord George Bentinck, who spoke for four hours in the House of Commons on the same side of the question Mr. Michie talks about ghosts, and the incredulity of people in the degenerate age Will the learned gentleman persist in his statements After having heard the speech of Mr Embling ' Are there not ghosts still haunting us in the political world' What but an incorporeal spiritualism of some kind or another can have reproduced on earth tile fallacies of a Bentinck in the person of an Enabling? Are not the disembodied spirits of error as migratory as living human beings " And, finding no resting-place in the world in which they lived, cannot Mr Michie conceive the possibility of a phantom following the advice Idr Dickens gives to ghosts in general, by abandoning a confined residence in some close piece of furniture, to seek the free and exhilarating atmosphere of a country like this' By rushed from home, or all but proscribed in every enlightened country, where can a ghost of this kind have a chance unless it be in Australia ' But the ghost being here, it must be treated with all the respect due to its antecedents It -w 11 be of no use hitting it with a poker Mr Dickens, in several instances, bears testimony to the indestructible nature" of apparitions of this kind They require advice, not harsh treatment Leave them alone and be friendly with them, and they go away without frightening anybody, or done any injury And so we shall deal tenderly with the pamphlet before us The writer starts with the idea that it is desirable to inquire into the causes of the present unexampled depression, and to provide immediate measures to foster the industrial interests of the colony " In support of this he proceeds to review the past history of the colony To begin with, the writer asserts that prior to the discovery of the gold fields the population were " entirely dependent on the progress of the squatting interest. The rates of wages were low in comparison with the present, but all necessaries and comforts of life could be procured at a corresponding rate In fact, the small amount of those days could be turned to much better account than the larger amount now a days ' Anybody who is really conversant with the various phases of colonial prosperity will recognize at once the absurdity of these statements There was quite as much, and so on more, fluctuation in the condition of the people before the gold discoveries than there has been since Many amongst us remember when unemployed workmen organized and walked about Melbourne in procession, demanding "bread or blood ' Sheep worth half a crown a head one year were perhaps worth 20s or days. a year afterwards Wheat and grain of all descriptions were equally valuable in price. Landed property, even in Melbourne, might be had for less than a years rental at one time, while a few years afterwards it increased enormously in Action. The rates of wages varied also The laws of supply and demand were as applicable then as they are now, Wages fell and rose, and labour, like other commodities, fluctuated So that whatever argument is intended to be founded upon the altered condition of things, does not apply to the present period more than to any previous condition through which the colony has passed The ghost might have come with the same pale face and lachrymose expression in 1847 There was a great deal more depression then, and, if we mistake not, the system of ad valorem duties was then in full operation, yet people thus " protected went about the streets destitute " The people then, says the water, "were contented with the progress they were making, and the yearly profits derived from the squatting interest left large bal innes for investment in the colony ' No assertion can be more void of truth if applied to a particular period of our history. The early squatters, almost to a man, were ruined For years, as everybody knows, the squatters were little better than agents for the merchants who supplied them "That instability which characterize your present condition was then unknown ' Why, there is no fact more remarkable in colonial history by than the instability of affairs prior to the gold disco; try The price of produce and the value of property depended upon mere chance A bad harvest brought starvation A fall in the price of wool beggared the squatter. It is free trade and free inter course with other parts of the world that have given stability When we lived under a sort of system of supplying ourselves we were always in want Now that we have attracted attention, and opened our ports freely to all comers, the commercial world keeps an eye on us, and is only too glad to anticipate our wants We owe this to free trade. The only security we have for continued stability in the prices of produce and other necessaries of life, is the facility with which our requirements may he supplied from abroad. If all that we grow doubled in price to morrow, what better would the colony be, Supposing that we consume it all What anchor should we be, as a nation, if we ate bread of our own making at 6s a loaf, instead of using foreign flour, say at Is 2 Is there any housekeeper in the country who could not confute Sir Embling on this point' But it is from such presumptions the author of the pamphlet, and those who think with him, draw their conclusions If we do a thing ourselves it must be done cheaply. That is the grand idea Let us make our own cloth, our own leather, our own tools, no matter what the cost look at the advantage of encouraging colonial industry The consumer has nothing to do with the business. His happy lot is to pay. It is of no consequence to this class of political economists that what one man gains another loses It is clear to them that if Jones the bootmaker pays Brown the tailor an extra pound or two for his clothes, the colony is so much the richer, because the money has been transferred from the pocket of Jones to the pocket of Brown. Still clearer is it that if, by a counter transaction, Brown the tailor also pays Jones the bootmaker an extra, price for boots, they make a mutual profit out of the transaction, and both grow richer This logic is irresistible. It comes upon us with all the force which one may suppose to attach to a resurrection of the dead-a true and inscrutable ghost theory dead and buried long ago, yet still taunting us to puzzle small brains and make a great noise of nothingness. Parliament only laughs at the apparition, but why not exercise it I
