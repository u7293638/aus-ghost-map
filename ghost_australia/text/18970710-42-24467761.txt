With the Cape York Prospecting Party.-XIII. Being an Account of a, Trip from Cape York to the Carron Range, with Various Peninsular Sidelights. The Cape York Aboriginals.—A Short Ac count of Their Customs, &c;, with a Few Words of Their Different Dialects. Economies of Life. By M.W.S. Nature in Cape York is kind enough to Nature's children. She has given them an ample supply of such food as they require, and leaves then only the slight trouble of collecting It. Around tW eeaat-nne from Newcaatto fc«]r to Om Jardlne *lv«r there la edible frott of a dot«a varieties) ripening »wy month of the year. Then la flan in ta» aea id plenty—turde, stingaree, dxgonr, mullet, Ac; scrub tuifc«y* aboiia* in every i«teh of aonib. and walUrtriea and baadlcoota gtvc a fair meat supply ; jrama are alao tottttd in great number* and rarletlea. Wnen QUa country carried tnousand* of a popola tiok they were- atronc, healthy, and well fed, and the aoureea of supply have in no yUm diminished whh the decreaalnc in habitants. It can be easily understood that those conditions should generate a disinclination for -work and an utter want of effort or knowledge whereby to grow inde pendent of the local food supply of Nature. And the fact that the Cape York natives, in common with their kindred all over Aus tralia, are the laziest, most improvident, most utterly stagnant and mentally unde veloped race of humanity is the fault of their surroundings more than of themselves. Man Is almost exclusively shaped by en vironment, and we are, as those natives are, merely what Nature and the pressure of life around us has forced us to be. It seems to us, after 2000 years of the misery of work drilled Into us, Injected Into our blood, woven Into every fibre of our lives the most extraordinary thing in the world that the Australian natives will not take kindly to it at the first go. it would be a much more extraordinary thing if they did. The animals require holes in the ground or nests In the trees, but the native humanity Is not in need of that small effort. Nature evidently meant men and women to wear some fragment of covering, otherwise #he would have supplied them with some differ ently disposed or exposed organisms, but the inherent delicacy which makes most people adopt that suggestion of Nature is not present in the Cape York people, so they are spared the trouble of even a fig leaf covering. They may be forced into clothes, they may be compelled to work, they may be starved into making some effort to live otherwise than by fruits and fish and fowl, but it Is against every beat of their heart, every thought of their mind, every inclination inborn in them for ages without number.

And they look oa thaw " story stones" wtth reverence mixed whh a regret that they knew nothing to-day of the stories those stoaea are telling. I have sees the boys picking them up and, carefully inspecting a number of them, select one which they keep. Neither in conforma tion of lines nor shape of stone is there any similarity between the samples chosen by different boys. It is, I suppose, a part of the let-us-make-belleve charac teristics of humanity—each sees what he wants to see la things which show nothing at all to anyone else. Down on the Daeie " story-etones" of a similar kind have the same legendary character. The native's forehead is receding because of the constant looking upward into the trees for sugarbags. That is one reason. Another is that the mothers press back the foreheads of their infants to bring their heads as near as possible to the aboriginal beauty type. There may be other reasons, but there is only one reason for the pointed, prominent chin. Ask any native where such-and-such a place is, and he points it out to you with his chin. Just make the attempt yourself, and you will be able to form some idea of the facial development this national habit leads to. There is no tribal restriction as to the number ot wives a man may have. The more he has the easier biß lot will be. The only trouble is the paying for them, the pommelling of them, and, if they are pretty, exercising a Btrict supervision over their relations with unauthorised admirers. Five is considered a very large number of wives, and the owner of them is generally the wealthiest and most powerful man in the tribe. But he get* gray at an early age. There are more zhosts in the Torres Straits islands and the Cape York Peninsula than would restock the ghostly manors and ruined castles of England and Ireland. Mostly every native has seen a ghost, or at least been acquainted with a man who had eeen one. The ghost family seems to be the same all the world over in form, colour, and peculiarities. The Peninsular ghosts have been white from all ages. They could not very well have been blue or black, even green or red, though a variation that might be tried with good results did not attract the spooks from the plain, ghastly white in which they have attired themselves since the death of Abel. I think Abel was the first ghost, and ac he had it all in his own hands, I am inclined to pity Cain. In concluding these general remarks about the Cape York natives, I take the liberty of expressing an opinion as to their worldly future. Mine may be a mistaken opinion, but it ia sincere, and ie not the result of a passing and very petty impulse to say something because other people are saying something. The Australian natives are of a race that I believe Nature never meant to survive. They have not one element of survival in them, and that they should dis appear before the white race points rather to their own weakness than to white cruelty or injustice. If the white race had not come along, some progressive Eastern race would have been here before now, and the Australian aboriginal would have been long extinct. It ie utterly useless for us to try to bring them along with us In our breakneck rush to our finite goal ; they will die on the road every one, leaving not a trace and scarcely a memory of their existence behind. Time and time this has been proved. Under the pressure of civili sation the hearts of the white races have been squeezed nearly dry of sympathy and charity and almost of humanity, but in spite of this—or the stronger because of it —we look with regret and pity on the race dying out before our eyes, dying as our own brothers and sisters are dying, under our feet. And more than one turne aside and tries to do something for them. And from many comes the sympathetic query : What can we do for them ? The few answers are varied and contradictory. I, in answer to such a question, should regretfully feel compelled to reply : Nothing. Let them alone. Let them be as they are. All your experimenting will not alter the result. And the best of your efforts cannot make them as contented and as happy as when they live on the food that Nature gives them, and spend their lives as they have spent them from ages beyond our ken. Peed them ft they are absolutely hungry, but not otherwise ; your luxuries are no benefit to them phyeically and morally. Yen would gather them into districts, con fine them within certain limits, and put a man to watch their goings and their com ings ; you would kill them all the quicker thereby. But don't forget, with your sym pathy and your coddHng, that they are venomous, and that they can sting to death ; nor blame those who resent their bite. . Let them be ! Let them be ! They are only going quicker than we out of a certainly miserable life to a doubtfully miserable one. Names and locations of the Cape York tribes forty years ago :— 1\. Andcoyomo: Odcupied the country around the mouths of the Kennedy and Escape Rivers, Newcastle Bay. 2\. Oudung: Occupied the littoral from Cliff Head (north of Newcastle Bay) to Cape York. 3\. Kockierugo : Occupied the country in land from the two preceding tribes to the Western waters. 4\. Ooomukadynia : Occupied the littoral from Cape York to the Small River, south of Red Island. 5\. Yadigan : Occupied the coast south of the Small River to south of the Jardine River, Vrilya Point. 6\. Yantigan, kindred to Yadigan : Occu pied the centre and tast of the Peninsula down to the Richardson Ranges, the Yadi gan language, considerably "burred," being spoken down to Temple Bay. Another language appears on the western coast at the mouth of the Batavia River. Of the above tribes the most numerous was the Yadigan, though it was split up into several factions, who lived very well apart. The Gudungs had a large and friendly island connection, Naurapi, Kow- rarega, &c.; The other coast tribes were generally at war with the islands. The following are the approximate numbers of the above tribes to-day. The location is opposite Red Island, and the language spoken Yadigan, with variations:—An dooyomo, 2 men, 1 woman ; Gudung, none ; Kockierugo, 3 men ; Goomukadynia, 1 man, 2 women ; Yadigan and Yantigan, about 15 men and same number of women. The males belong to the Native-Police, or work, when they take the humour, getting turtle shell or beche-de-mer, or doing chance work on Thursday Island. This is to pro vide " luxuries" (rum, and clothes, and sometimes flour), as there is any amount of native food. The women, when young, are generally taken as servants to Thurs day Island, and then given to one of the police boys or sent back to the mainland, where they try to earn the luxuries they had a taste of by very questionable methods. There are very few children born, and in a short time the race will be extinct. (To be continued.)
