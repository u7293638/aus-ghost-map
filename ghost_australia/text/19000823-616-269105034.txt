A SPECTllE HAND. GHOSTS AT HAMPTON COURT PALACE. The ghosts which are' saul to frequent the precincts of Hamp ton;,Court Palace are more or ■■loss-known by reputation, but thei: rumblings have been pro miscuous and uncertain. Great iuteiest in their movements has, however, been newly aroused by the grange experience under gone j by an artist who, during the pst few weeks, has been visitiig certain rooms of the palace for the purpose of sketch ing tli3 old Flemish tapestry on the walls. Wlnle engaged in', the. Guard Watching Chamber . in broad daylight this ■.gentleman, Mr. Haynes, of Surbiton, positively asserts that a spectre hand, white and delicate and richly jewelled, has persistently intruded be tween him; and- the tapestry. At first he unagined the disturb ing element must be one of the many hards so beautifully in scribed oh the tapestry, but the limb, he says, moved slowly from one stage to another, and pointed downwards. Mr. Haynes was much agitated, and told /several friends of this curious visitation. They,, not unnaturally, perhaps, advised him to dismiss the subject from his mind and return to the ehahihewaxid liis woi-k.. Eut the hand reappeared be fore his startled eyes; and on the last appearance of the- phan tom the artist made a hurried sketch of the outstretched hand, the rough outline of which de picts a\ brilliant marquise ring on the forefinger. The effect of these continued visits of the supernatural, on Mr. Haynes is very visible; he is unnerved, and he bus suspended his sketching. \ These amthe plain facts, but there is, it would seem, a weird and historic connection between this hand; and' the hand of the Queen Catherine Howard, one of the wives of King Henry Till.
