SATURDAY, NOVEMBER 30, 1878. Major SMITH gave the explanation on Thursday of the threats which, from the first, havo been interwoven with the Ministerial addresses on the subject of constitutional reform. The allusions to a policy of violence havo been too persistent not to have had somo settled cause. In the first place, we had Sir BRYAN O'LOGHLEN'S referonce to an unfortunate necessity which might arise of transporting the members of the Council across the Murray, and placing the Governor on board a steamer in the bay. The Chief Secretary has dwelt upon the embassy as the last effort at peaceable settlement, as if the next effort was not to be of a peaceable character. Professor PEARSON-after his nomination to his post on the embassy- spoke in the same strain. His words aro worth recalling : "There were times when generals were obliged to proclaim what was called martial law, but which waa really the absence of all law-times when the commander of a for- tress destroyed houses and abolished civil law ; and times when means had to be adopted by statesmen which at other times they would not even dare to contémplate, and which had to be resorted to simply be- cause the safety of all men depended upon them. No extreme revolutionary means, however, would be resorted to until every . other possible expedient was tried instead." ? And now we have Major SMITH re- ferring to tho 'ilast appeal," and then of " the plunge into civil strife." There can be no mistake about tho meaning of this militant member of the Ministry One of his sentences is -"Tho reason " vvhj the Government intended to "send homo was that they felt " that they had no right to plunge " political parties into civil strife " until thoy had made one last appeal ' And, so as to bo intelligible to tho meanest mind, tho hon gentleman in dulged m repetition, and proceeded to add, that "if they resulted to oxtiemomeasures " first, the Imperial Government might " s>ay, ' Why did you not como to us ? " ' \ ou had no right to plunge the '"country into civil strife, and create " ' suffering and distress until you carno " ' to us ' The same tono runs tin ougli all the addiesses Tust, the einbassj If that fails-andMmistcis aie beginning to regard failure as possible-then m tnnidation and violence Vi hat vv o aro specially indebted to Major SMIIII for is the knowledge of the mechanism of tho plan Anothei and final deadlock is to bo deliberately brought about by tacking tho Ministerial Rofoun Bill to the Appropriation Bill of the yen, in which form, of course, no lefoun bill would ever pass, because, if a Co istt tution Act can bo foiced upon the Council m this mannei, the whole lcgis lation of tho session can be passed as schedules of the Supply Bill lhere would be no need of one House reform bills tho Council would be swept av\aj bj the proceeding which ob tamed the measure lhat the tack would be successful m bunging about the anarchy, the stufe, and tho \ îolence which Ministers aflect to deprc cate, but which they would be the last to mention if thoy did not gloat over, may be admitted In the Iii it place, the Governor would have to bo deilt with Each and every Govcuioi has specific instructions to consent to no buch tack as that of which Major SMITH has made mention The consent of Governors to the tariff, the Darling, and tho payment of mein bers tacks, was obtained, because more 01 less plausible arguments weie adduced that the procedure adopted was m ac cordance with ordinary parliamentary practice, but the most partisan of Attorney Generals could not advise a Governoi that the union of leform and supply was no tack, and the weakest of Governors could not but see that he was befooled if such advice should bo given As one consequence of the tack, the Goveinor must be put on board the steamer in the bay I he Council would have to be driven out of then Chamber, and whether tho representatives were sent across the Murray 01 not, would depend perhaps upon their subniLssiveness A Supreme Coui t process might still stay the admimstiation of affans undei refoini auspices, and, consequently, the judges must be got ud of Of course, an emevtc of this description could not take place under the British flag, and that would hav c to bo hauled down-as we aro reminded by Professor PEARSON other colonies hauled it down a hundred years ago All this may seem ex; travagant, but it is the natuiil and legitimate outcome of the plan pro pounded by Major SMITH on the floor of the House, amid tho cheers of his colleagues The tack of tho Rofoun Bill to the Appropriation Bill could have no othei result Ncithei tho Governoi noi the Council would 01 could consent to tho procedure, and the anarchy Mr BLURY dcpiocates must follow on tho adoption of any such course as surely as the daylight accom pames the sun Of course, v\ e shall be told that nothing of the sort is intended But acts must have their consequences, and if they shudder at the consequences, why do Ministers talk of i evolutionary acts 1 E\ en if they are not serious, and aro bpeaknig with the tongue m tho cheek, then conduct is without excuse Their following in the country may be excited and woikcd up to a pitch of passion until it becomes diihcult to restrain them There ai e inclined planes down which no men should be set travelling, and there are contingencies which no honest and loyal statesman will so much as indicate to the crowd. Why Mr. BERRY should cry havoc, and let loose the gallant Major at this juncture, it is not for us to say. The Chief Secretary invariably professes an earnest desire to come to terms within the colony, but no man at once sane and honest seeks to reconcile parties by attempts to inflame the passions of the public. The hon gentloman must bo well aware tliat such utterances as those of Pio fessor PEARSON, capped by the deck matron of the Minister of Education, are directly calculated to stir up stiife, and to excite a clamoui in which the still small voice of reason shall be lost foi ever That tho latest and most official of the fulminations will be sue cessful even as a party movement, we may very well doubt One of the last things we believe the majority of the Ministerial members desire is revolution If the embassy were to fail, the bulk of the men who now give a reluctant sup Dort to tho project would in all human probability refuse to follow the Govern ment a step further on tho downward path And if wo havo estimated the views and the position of these gentle men accuiately, then the dislike and the distrust of the mission home will be increased and not diminished by Thuis day s official admission that, so far as Ministers are concerned, the force behind the embassy is violence The question, " AVhat next 1 ' has been an anxious one, and it has been answ ered Mr CASEY is not satisfied with any prorjosals that havo yet emanated from tho Legislative Council on the subject of reform, noi is he willing that the " embassy " should go home to make us ridiculous in tho eyes of England and "a very scorn and deiision " to our fellow colonists m every part of the world It is impossible to say by what motives each opponent of the proposed " wild goose chase " is actuated We doubt not they are of a praiseworthy character as they tend to a praise worthy object But we may be sure that m Mr CASEY'S case no feeling of jealousy can possibly have any influence He hunsolf, by grace of the Chief Secretary, enjoyed avery pleasant trip at the publie expense not long ago, and if he hurried back a little pre- maturely, he cannot lay the blame of his unnecessary haste to his friend and patron His appointment as commis sioner to the Pans Exhibition afforded him boundless opportunities of dis tu-guishuig himself, of which, despite the naturi! bashfulness of hw disposition hLwasiiotslowtoavadhirasclf He basked in the smiles of Royalty,was honoured by the presence of the loveliest Princess m Christendom at a wine tasting, and electrified London and Paris alike bytlio sumptuousness of his entertainments All these things, together with tho general wonder "how he ever cams " there,' made Mi CASEY a sensation in the two principal capitals of the old world, and maybe said to havo given him quito a Turopoin leputation Naturally he wishes his benefactor to enjoy the sime advantages-to havo n" opportunity of grasping II B H tlio Punce of WAILS by the hand, of lotting a most gracious Puncess seo wheiem tme lefinemciit consists, of astonishing the lively Parisians and more slow going Londoncis by his democratic magnili cenco and prodigality, and of makin ' his namo familiar as a household wold in the mouths of daz/lcd grmdets Undci the cn cumstanccs, weinup admit that Mr CASLYS opposition c innot bj any possibility be even tm0ed by em 3 But there is the fact-ho does not think th it Messrs Bl RP\ and PL vusof should start upon then tiavels as the lepiesentatives of 13 membors and 13,310 voters (wo quote Mr COOIEKS hguies), and soonei than tint they should feel themselves undei any compulsion to stitt, ho kindly undeitook on Thursday ev enwg to show them a solution of the leform diiliuilty which would rendel then migration unnecessarj On the pre ?nous daj ho had given notice of his intention to move a soi les of lesolutions which, if adopted, w ould have pledged the tw o Iiouses to be bound by the practice of the Imperial Pailianient with lenard to appropriation bills, and ni the event of disputes, to allow the Govenioi to act as the final aibitrator PIOVLSIOU was also made for dissolutions of either or both Houses undei ceitun circumstances , but it is not necessaiy that we should go into furthei pirti culais The hon gentleman had not an opportunity of formallj submitting his scheme, but he dwelt upon its beauties m tho couise of a speech on the Councils proposals Non, theie appears to us something alike simple and foolish about the main ideas con tamed in tho plan of settlement sub nutted The first of the resolutions nins as follows -" Resolved that the Leins " lative Council and Legislativo As " sembly be bound to adhere to the " practice and procedure of the Imperial " Parliament Nothing could be moie charming But who is to bind them Ï If they weie only content to do what Mr GVSLY. suggests of their own accord, we should havo peace and quietness, constitutional rule, steady piogross, and generil content But no one know s better than the hon member for Manduiang that the Assembly, no mitta what it may say to the contiarj, will no moio consent to confine its operations within the limits of tho Im penal practice than it will think of considenng the public interests on!)

Slack had been reported by the Master in Equity for throw ing a paper weight at Mr J F Anderson during the taxation of the costs in Slack v Atkinson. For this contempt, Mr Justice Molesworth, on the 6th November, sentenced Slack to two months imprisonment. On the 8th November Slack went to the Equity Court to make an application but Mr Justice Molesworth refused to hear him unless he surrendered. He did surrender, and he was taken into custody by the deputy sheriff. At a later period of the day he was brought before the Court to make his application. There was no warrant in court for his detention, and Mr Justice Molesworth told him he might leave, and Slack left the court. A war rant was, however, drawn up on the original order for two months imprisonment. Under this warrant Slack was arrested on the 13th November and lodged in gaol. It was con tended in his behalf that the imprisonment on the 8th November was for the same offence as that for which the warrant was issued, that as he had been discharged from that imprisonment he could not be punished twice for the same offence, and therefore he ought now to be set at liberty. The answer to this was that the imprisonment on the 8th No vember was not for the same contempt as that under the warrant, but if it were, still there was no power in any judge to release him from tho sentence of two months impri sonment.That sentence having been passed only the Executive could release from it, and a judge had no more power to discharge him than had the sheriff or a warder of the gaol. After hearing the arguments, the Chief Jus tice said they must reserve judgment till Tuesday, and the habeas was extended till that day. Hie weekly meeting of the executive com mutee of the Juvenile Exhibition waa held yesterday afternoon, at the offices, 5 Collins street weat, Mr D Beath in the chair A letter waa read from the Muuater

pressed by young peoplo to exhibit was brought under the notice of the meeting, giMtig everj encouragement to the committee to proceed with their labours Mr H II Budd, solicitor, renewed his application at the City Police Court yesterday morning that the man Martin Wiberg, at present on remand for stealing 5,000 aove reigns from the treasure room of the H M S S Avoca, during the passage of that vessel between Sydney and Melbourne m August 1877, should bo liberated on bail, pending the arm al of Elliston, formerly chief officer of Hint vessel, who is at present in custody m England, on suspicion of having been the principal pcrpetrator-of the offence Mr Budd also asked that in the event of Viberg being admitted to bail, the sov ereigns which were found in his posses sion and on his selection m Gipps Land at the time of his arrest, should bo restored to him Superintendent \Y inch on behalf of the police, opposed the application in bbth instances, on the ground that such a course uii^ht tend to defeat the ends of justice, especially as the sov ereigns found in Wibcrg s possession formed a portion of the proceeds of the robbery Mr Panton, P M , who pre sided on the Bench, refused to grant the ap plication An interesting case was brought under the notice of the City Bench yesterday morning when an intelligent looking lad, about 10 jcar8 of ago, named Henry tari, who was stated to be the step brother of a well known actress, was brought up as a neglected child Some time ago the lad was left an orphan, mid by his mothers will a sum of JUJOO VI as bequeathed to him which is now out on mortgage Ile was placed under the guardianship of Mr Wright, a grocer inQueensberry street Carlton.although before her death his mother frequently expressed a wiBhthat he should be placed under the care of Mr Iry, a relativo of hera, residing at Bulli, New South Wales, who had offered,to educate the lad and give him a comfortable home It appears, however, that the charge of tho lad fell into other hands, and ho was ultimately placed under the control of Mr Wright The lad hau on several occasions run away from Mr Wright, and was in the habit of stopping with a respcctablo artisan and his wife at St Kilda, who appel rto have been acquainted with his parents, and from whom he rccciv ed the adiantages of a comfortable home At the court yesterday, Mr Wright being the lawful guardian of the lad claimed the right of taking chargo of him, but the boy steadfastly refused to go home with his foster parent Mr Panton, P M , suggested that, as the lad had found a comfortable home with the person who had taken chargo of him at St Kilda, he should be allowed to remain there Mr Wright however, objected to such a proceeding and the case was cv entuolly adjourned for a week, in order that the lad s relatives at Bulli Now South Wales, might be communicated with A moBt cowardly and brutal assault was committed at an early hour yesterday morn ing upon Constable Brennan, by a larrikin named James Corrigan It appears that at about lam, Constable Brennan, who was on duty m Swanston street, received infor mntion that another constable was being illuBed by a number of roughs in A Beckett street Brennan at once went to the spot indicated, and observed a crowd of larri- kins and loose women creating a dis turi ia n ce at tho corner ot Stewart and A Beckett streets but did not seo any constable there He dispersed the mob, and amongst others ho pushed Corngan aside and ordered him to go home Corrigan became somewhat abusive but the crowd having dis persed, Constable Brennan proceeded in tho direction of Swanston street, in older to resume duty Un arming at tho corner of A Beckett-street, he again carno upon Cor rigan and another man, and upon the con Btable again advising them to go home, Corrigan suddenly rushed at Brennan and stabbed lum with a knife m three pi ices in a most brutal manner Tho conatablo at once closed with tho rufliarli and with the assistance of a nifcht watchman, named Daley, handcuffed him and took lum to the city watchhouso On arm al nt the watch house Brennan was bleeding copiously from the wounds he received at the hands of Corrigan, and Constable Ratigan had him conveyed to the Melbourne Hospital with all possible speed On being examined by tho resident medical officer it was found that Brennan had received a sei ere wound on the breast, nearly an inch in depth, and two other woundg of a more or lesa serious nature under the shoulder blado and in the ribs Corrigan was brought before the City Bench jesterday morning and on the application of Superiu tendent Winch was remanded for a week, by w Inch time it is expected that Constable Brennan will have so far recovered as to be enabled to appear

Aramac under the charge of Mr Nathaniel Buchanan, the Queensland ox plorer, for the Northern Territory, where Messrs Travers and Gibson have taken up some 23,000 square miles of pastoral and grazing country The journey-some 1,100 miles-has been accomplished most pros- perously, and with scarcely any loss of cattle the fact is of interest to graziers, as it de monstrates the possibility of stocking largo stations in the Northern Terntorj from Queensland Mr Buchanan telegraphed his arrival near Katharine Wators a day or two ago The Ytcloiian Independent writes - ' rho political situation

passage on the ethnology of the Afghans is sayB the Sydney Edio, from the unpublished sheets of a work by Mr Talboys Wheeler -"To all appearance the Afghans are of Jewish origin , not Jews of the ortho dox t}pe, the outcome of Jerusalem and the Temple worship, but Jews of the old, turbu lent, stiff necked type, who revolted at Shcchem against Rehoboam, and setup golden calves at Bethel and Dan Th» Afghans claim to bo descendants of Saul, the son of Kish They are divided into tribes, clans, and families They distribute conquered lands by lot, perform the. ceremony of the scapegoat, and build shrines on high places Their features are unmistakably Jewish , but their language, is not. Heb tew, not anytUiuj akjn to Hebrew It ia conjectured that they ure the descendants of tho -ten tribes whom tho King of Assyria carried away to the city of the Medea , but the looa of all tracea of
