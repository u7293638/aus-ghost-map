LITERARY REGISTER. THE "ASSOCIATION" IN COUNCIL. A PARODY. The big Squatter stood up, like a jack in the box, And his chummies were kindling with thoughts of their flocks; And the show of their souls was like sheep in the sun, When the blue skies seem spanning some New England run. Like a flight of macaws, when the maize is in cob, The Council were seen at their favourite job; Like a flight of macaws, which the settler has shot at, They soon will be driven from the work they're so hot at. For the murmurs of Hate fill the homes of the poor, And doom the "sheep-Counts" to be Solons no more; And the ears of the senator tingle and burn, And they hope there'll be gullibles still to "return!" And there sat the Doctor's PET* Ajax all grim, But seemed he not now what the Darlings knew him; And the ghost of his New Zealand spec. made him "yell," And "execrate" all who love Justice too well! And there sat the windy wee Wit of the Law, With much froth, many sneers, and clenched fists full of straw; And the scribes of the Press were like anglers with bad luck, And the half dozen gallery martyrs did sad look. And the Botany Bay folk are loud in their scorn, And the wolf of his sheep's woolly clothing is shorn; And the schemes of the Squatters, unequalled of man, Will—go to the Devil!—and the Squatters, too, can!
