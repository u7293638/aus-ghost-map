' Woodman. Spare the 'free.' (To the Editor of tho ' Illawarra Mercury.'') Sir, â€” I was much pleased at the remarks reported in your columns as having been made at the last mooting of the Dapto Council, by Alder man John Brown, respecting an application made to that body for permission t6 cut down smno green trees growing on the side of the main road near Ghost Bridge. Mr. Brown very properly said that too much tree-cutting having already taken place in this district, efforts should rather be made to grow more than to destroy tho few now remaining. In these remarks that gentleman uttered a most unportaht truth. The district is suffering severely, and has been for years, from the wholesale destruction of its trees and shrubs that lias already taken placc, and will do so until ! at ' least a fair portion of the land so denuded of its primeval grand foliage shall again be planted and studded with trees, which will at once beautify tho country, and afford shelter to stock from the scorching rays of the sun in summer, and the bleating blasts of winter winds and rains. And tho ; different Municipal Councils wou'd be sotting a i good example, worthy of imitation by all the land ; owners in the district, were they to plant rows of ? suitable trees along cither side of the main road ; and other principal thoroughfares within their ; respective boundaries, as opportunity might offer. Such work is done by public bodies in many parts 1 of America and on the continent of Europe and i in other parts of the world, and why not be done { here l But however far off may be the time when ISl our different Councils will undertake and carry ? out so noblo and useful a work as the planting of * suitable trees along the sides of our principal ! roads, let us hope they will carefully protect and !Hf| preserve all trees now growing in such places lp against being damaged or destroyed in any way or pS for auy purposes whatever. pi SHADE.
