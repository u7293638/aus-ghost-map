Piogiess»-the taxing bill being under consideration- ' there was an equality of votes, when tho Chairman, contrary to the usual rule in favour of an opportunity for further discussion, gave his casting voto in favour of reporting progress, and then under similar circum- stances, gave his casting vote as Speaker against the Premier's motion, asking leave to sit again next day, and in favour of the Opposition amendment, that tho House proceed to the next order of the day. As the next order of the day would have followed as a matter of course, the amendment was virtually against sitting again at all, and the Opposition claimed the vote of the Speaker as having "kicked tho Bill out of tho House." The Government then adopted a course not approved of by their supporters. The Opposition had, amongst other matters raised during their desultory discussions, claimed that the places of two members who had been absent during the session should be filled up before the taxation proposals were proceeded with. These seats were those of Mr. Fysh, the late Premier and member for East Hobart, who was still in England, and Mr. Gayer, the member for Queenborough, who had been for some months in Melbourne. Though ministers might havo pushed on their business and remedied the result of the chanco Opposition victory by renewing the motion for going into Committee on the bill which contained their taxation scheme, they preferred the other alternative and asked for an ad- journment till the 2nd December that the friends of the absent members might be consulted with the view of obtaining their resignations. Even this, though they had clamoured for it, the Opposition resisted, hut the adjournment was agreed to and the íesiguations of both seats were at once obtained. Writ3 were forthwith issued, and the elections -were held on November 20th. For East Hobart, Mr. J. S. Dodds, barrister, whose efforts to obtain a seat in the House of Assembly had been twice before defeated, and Mr. Bussell Young, the city solicitor, a former representative for Franklin (Huon), were nominated. For Queenborough the Hon. T. D. Chapman, member for Buckingham in the Legislative Council, and Dr. E. L. Crowther, who has twice before unsuccessfully contested the same seat, wore the candidates. Though au attempt was made to identify the Government scheme of taxation with these elections, it is not questioned that both were contested on purely personal grounds, entirety, irres- pective of that scheme. Both Dr. Crowther and Mr. Dodds were returned by largo majorities, and both joined the ranlcs of the Opposition when the House resumed i<3 sittiugs on the appointed day. The fato of the Giblin Ministry was Bealed, as this gave tho Opposition a majority of one ; and, after some further delay, through indecision on the part of the Opposition, a call of the House was made for December 17th, to consider a motion of want of confidence in the Government proposals, notice of which was given by Mr. Reibey, the Opposition leader. On that day the Government proposals were rejected by IG votes to 14, one of their supporters boingabsent, not prepared for a further ruse of the Opposition, who slunk in silence to the division, declining debate.. The fate of the Ministry met with little sympathy,' from the lack of energy they had shown in pushing through their taxation proposals -a dilatoriness which has, in fact, led many to question how far they^ were really sincere in their desire to carry a land tax. Though the public voice was with them, Ministers dallied with their _ proposals, and nil but invited that opposition in the House which their opponents found could not be aroused in tho country generally. On the day following the want of confidence motion, Ministers tendered their resignations, mid after some .manoeuvring, the mover of the vote gave up the at- tempt to form a Ministry ; but, accepting office under him whom he recommended to be sent for, we have the following as our new Ministry : Premier (without a portfolio) Mr. W, L. CROWTHER Colonial Secretary. Mr. REIHEV Colonial Treasurer. Mr. DAVID LEWIS Attorney-Geneial. Mr. J. S DODDS Minister of Lands. Mr. C. O'KKILI.Y The now mon were sworn in on Dacomher 20, on which day both Houses adjourned till the 2Sth Janu- ary. The Assembly passed supplies amounting to £50,000, and purposed adjourning till April, as tho now Ministry wished ; hut the Council, not quite so facile, postponed tho consideration of the supply reso- lution till tho 20th January, not being disposed to favour this Ministry more than any Administration had ever boen favoured. The constitution of the now Ministry is perplexing. Messrs. Crowther, Reibej-, and O'Reilly formed a part of tho Reihey Ministry that preceded that of Mr. Giblin just resigned. Mr. O'Reilly, in so far as he has decided opinions, has always supported an income-tax. Messrs. Reihey and Crowther havo boxed the compass of political opinion. There is not a policy or principle for raising revenue, or administering the affairs of the Colony, which they have not in turns advocated and con- demned, according as the exigencies of party warfare seemed to thom to demand. Consequently at this moment the Colony is in a state of qomplete ignorance and has not even an idea as to what tile new proposals for raising rovenuo to meet the railway liability may be. Ministers have declared by their votes their disapproval of the land tax. But they promised no substitute. In fact they purposely abstained on tho want of confidence motion from debating the question sp that they might not bo trammelled by pledges. Mr. Lewis, tho Treasurer, a gentleman new to office, has been remarkable, if for anything, for the elasticity or unsettle 1 character of his opinions, while tho Attorney-General is new to Pailiamentary as well as official life, his only public' act having boon his voto on the want qf confidence motion. As a x'ery yonng man his views will be those of his colleagues. Perplexing n3 the financial position is, tho aspect of affairs in another direction, seriously alfecting the honour and interest of the Colony, is -still loss re- asoning, Two of tho now Ministers havo been the undisguised advocates of the Main Line Railway Com- pany against tho Colony, tho Premier having boen even suspected of being its locognised Parliamentary agent; a third gentleman hus shown slrongproclivilies in tho same direction, and, singularly enough, the very day the late Ministers left office, that same day not.co of an action by tho company wai served against the Colony for a sum of £28,000 odd, being interest for the time the Evandale j'unction was tho Northern point of train sorvice, and for consequential damage. The claim is laughed at outside the railway circle, and it is feit the company will not dare to go iutq to Court, but that the present pioceediugs are in the hope of ex- tracting some concession fiom pliant friends. For- tunately, Parliament will li.vvo a voice jn any arrange- ment embracing a p.iyraent of money. Writs vvpre issued on December 23rd, for the re-olec-tlon of the new Ministers, as required by law. Tho pei iod of nomi- nation in each case being from the 27th December, until the 2nd January, and the daj- of polling in the event of a contest, the 7th .Tanuat j'. No opposition is however being offered to the return of either of the eaudidates. On December 24 the seat for the George Town electorate vas also declared vacant, thiough the resignation of Captain Gilnioie, who has accepted au office of emolument under the Grown-the Warden ship of the Launceston Marino Board. The Main Line Railway and its company has con- tinued during this year to occupy moio than its fair share of public attention. The details of the question ni e intimately mixed with the doings of the political world, hut vye speak of them by themselves to preserve con- tinuity, When vye entered upon tho year, an arrange- ment had been entered into, the Government, recog- nising the useful woiU done by the railway, having made certain payments to it on loan, but without prejudice to the matters in dispute. To Batlsfy Ministers how far the legal advico they had acted on was sound, a case had also been privately submitted by the Government for the joint opinion of the Attorney- General for England, Mr. Benjamin, Q. C, and Mr. Cyril Dodd. To this the company were not parties. Matters remained in thia^poaitio», the Railway Service being performod with regularity ant} freedom from accident, until the end of January, when ve v;eio startled by a tempest raised once moie bj' the indiscretion of the Local Manager, Mr. Grant, who without any previous intimation of his intention to the other pai ties concerned, gave to the public, through the pioss, an unfinished correspondence iii which he had been engaged with the Government. In the first place Mr. Grant had written to Ministers intimating that the powly.appointod directory of the company 'proposed Bending out a deputation to the Colony commissioned to'settle all disputes betvyeou the colony mid tho company, and as a formal matter pf oourtosy asked if it would bo agreeable for Ministers to receive the deputation. Ministers replied that they were not only willing, but most anxious to reçoive any proposals for an adjustment of disputes, but, inju- diciously travelling boj'ond the ¡inmediato issue, and referring to the very obnoxious and needlessly ofteiwi ve manner in which he had conducted previous correspon- dence with thennolves and their predecessors,suggested that any futuro négociations would be moro likely tq effect an amicable adjustment of the dispute if they could be oanduoted by the contending parties without his" intervention; 'luis brought the intercourse to a premature conclusion. Mr. Grant, in addition to regarding tho hinfas a personal »feront, unwarrantably jumped to a further conclusion, that in s¡¡glit¡ng ulm individually, Ministers meant also lo decline meeting the deputation, and tli3 result was a "tempest in a teapot" amongst tho newspaper Press of the Colonj'. This was apparently Mr. Grant's object in making tlio unfinished correspondence pre- maturely public. .Ho wished to make it the grouui^of accusation against Ministers, and so tho correspondence dropped until the middle of Februarj' when Mr. Grant again"coinmuuicated with the Government, forwarding copies ot certain'resolutions passed by the London Directorate rciterntinr; tho incorrect statement that tho line was open for traffic on March, 15, 1870, and charging tho Qovernmcm) with default. Mr. ürant again, in courso of his loiters, throw out hints abqut tho desirability of tho attendance of tho 'depu- tation, adding, however, now a request that ho might bo ablo, when he informed his directors of tho willing- ness of tho Government to receive tho deputation, to add that all disputes that could not be arranged by negotiation might be settled by arbitration in a fair and friondly spirit. Tho Colonial Secretary on behalf n? til« Government, replied to Mr. Grant that tho Government were ns ready ns ever to rocoivo tho deputation, though they hr.d no power to do an on the now basils ho liad Buigoa'roií. ' As a furtiior step the Govern- ment tirdd ¡>f 'Mr. 'tirant's" tortuous wav«, fnrwardfid n letter tlirbugh fho Crown Agents iii London;, to the Director;, intimnting tbolr wish flint t)ie matter should be settle^, ¡pul pxnressiug tbcîv xyilliiignoàs to.r'ecelvo a deputation with tins object. Mr," Grant's riait conci- liatory (!) Btop was the circulation in the colo'ny of a report of the directors of the company prepaiod to b,á submitted to a meeting of shareholders to bo held on the 18th Februarj', and which, literally bristled with mis-statements of fact» and untruths. This was back'd up by an equally conciliatory (?) stop on the part of the Directors in London who, by similar mis-statements and untruths in a letter they addressed to tho Secretary of State for tho Colonies, at ¿ho timo lyl,«} our £300,000 loan was being placed in tho iiiarlîot;, sojjghj; to. d^ipn the credit of tho'colony, and to prevent tho floating of the proposed loan. Both theio courses "proved futile. ' Dir.

'Tho result of tho Directors' stop was a curt intimation from the Secretary of Stato that he had- no jmlsriiotiuu in the matter at all, and the creation of a wide-spread feeling of indignation at such a cowardly attempt at coercion, Many who were previously inclined to symp.ithiso with the company, denounced ns nofar iqus tj.is r.ttempt of the Directors which could only have "Boen" intended cither to so cripple the Colony as to make Government agrco to on" terms with the company, or to vent their spit» on- the Colony becautio Governmont.insisted on the company fulfilling its'con- tract obligations. Foiled in their attempt to draw the Secretary of State into a local dispute, the dipctorg with more success sought the aid of the Committee of the Stock exchange, one at least of whose members w as intimately associated with the Company, and by a species of conspiracy it was hoped to defeat the floating of our loan as if the Gov ernment were in de fault to its recognised creditors In May, further correspondence show ed that the Deputation was still purclj lijphothetical, and nil Mi Grmta arsu ments in connection with it Bimpl) BO much bounce The opinion of r Mr Llo)d upon a case submitted b) the Company waa also brought to light, but proved to be a series of legal platitudes begging tho whole question and based upon n mistaken assumption that the objections to the uno were based upon matters non essential and of minor importance only Hie Company however having now raised an additional £100 000 for the express purpose of putting the Railway and plant in good workin" c-der, seemed to be nctm" as it the possession of funds tavo them immunity from the fulfilment of their obligations and justified them in being more unreasonable than ev ei in dealing with tho Government ilieir defiance was hovvevoi, misplaced, and, as piobably founded upon a hope that the colony would by the aid of tho StockLxchango, be placed hoi s rft combat hy the failuio to float it3 loan, pioved to bo decidedlj premature, when within a few daj s of a very n{,gressiv e speech by the chairman of tbo company at a meeting of shareholders, combated m a letter to Mc Tines by Mr I)sb, the wholo of the loan was taken up at a price at aid above the fixed minimum, though the company vveio not without their consolation Hie committee of the Stock Exchang» persisted in refusing to quote the loan, tho only effect beinD to weaken confidence in the integrity of the Stock Exchange Here ngom the company feigned conciliation and a further correspondence between the Gol eminent and the companj ic3ultcd in the long looked for and long talked rf deputatun leaving Lindon by the San riancisco Mail Mi Grant in another leii0thj leltci, onclo'inj, one to himself from the Seciefmy of the Company sought to re open the question w lth tho Government himself but in anticipation of the v îsit of the deputation, tho C ilonial Secietnry on their behalf declined further correspondence Mr Grant al°o applied for a copj of the opinion of the Engh«h Kwjoi3 to whom tho Go ei nment had submitted n case and which was at this timo understood to have been leceivcd but wis informed that it could not bo placed at the disposal of til» companj w ltliout the authority of Parlament Mr Grant was thereupon asked by tho Government to allow Air Higinbothum, late Lu"iueer ni Chief of the Victorian Railwajs who 1ml been appuntcd bj them to act in the matter of the arbitration of tolls and com pensation, to leportunon the then state oí the line ni conjunction with the Lnyneei m Chief of this colony so that, being in possession of the nceessaiy detailed information upon the point, thej might be able when the deputation arrived to deal promotly with all ques tions nt issue This Mr Gi ant refuser!

There is no declamation, but only intenso and natural display of fooling, oven in tho most emotional passages, mid in such soenoä as that in which ho givo3 tho direction to tho First Actor, Mr. Creswiek's voico is like a beautifully attuned lyre, entrancing to tho ear in tho exquisite modulation of its pevfect elocution. Tho other parts were enacted with much ability, and the performance was a grand ono from hegiuning to end. Tho audience woro most enthusiastic in their demostrations of approval.

P. HENNESSY.-The intelligence that the lion. John Popo Hennessy, at present Governor of Hong Kong, will probably bo tho successor of Sir Hercules Robinson in tho Governorship of New South Wales, 8ays tho Brisbane, Courier, ia not likely to bo generally received just now with much satisfaction, in that colony. Tho peoplo of the parent Australian colony would scarcely consider it at any time a compliment that they should havo lo receive as Governor a gentleman who is certainly a junior in tho rank of Colonial Govornors, and who comes direct from tho rulo of rather potty and incon- siderable Crown colonies. But, in addition to this, Mr. Hennessy was known in English politics as mi ultra-Tory who did not signalise liiinsolf by any tbiug in particular except fluency of spoceh and fidelity to his patrons, which has in due time re- ceived ample reward ; and as people cannot help but make comparisons between lum and the vory able and popular man whom ho is to succeed, it is to bo feared that on his first coming the new Governor will not profit thoroby. Another thing also will just at present havo an unfavorable inlliionco on his re- ception should Now South Wales bo his destination -namoi)', tho sympathy shown by him, whilo Governor of thoWindwntd Islands, for tho negroes, and in Hong Kong for tho Chinese. We beliovo bo lins satisfied the Imperial Government that in both casca ho was in tho light ; but, right or wrong, his roputntion in this rogard would not help lum much just now in Sydney.

It is now reported Unit Hie rust lins made its appearance in the Lancefield district, and is extend- ing toward Rochford. A few good-crops have been gathered, but, unfortunately, they aro exceptions ; tho reports from the Wimmera district continuo among the best. It is now recognised that tho early orop of potatoes in the Western district will bo a light olio, tlirco tqns to the aero hcing'very' usual ; and rain would causo second growth. Tho later potatoes however, may still bo vastly benefited by copious rains."
