COMPETITIVE DESIGNS FOR PUBLIC BUILDINGS. I -h TO THE EDITOR OF THE HERALD. I SIR-I note with some astonishment a letter appearing in this morning's issue from Mr Lilly, a well known architect in this city, and, I believe, a Fellow of the Royal Institute of British Architects (one of the highest degrees in the profession), and his opinion should have some weight on the subject of public competition. Mr Ellis advocates that all designs and details for public buildings now in the hands of the Government Architect or his officers should be collected, and placed in proper indexed order, for easy reference, and open for the inspection of any intending competitor by appointment "I have been under the impression that this most proper and necessary action on the part of the Minister for Works, when calling for competitive designs for public buildings of importance, was to bring out the best available talent and new ideas. But if Mr. Ellis' suggestion is carried out it will tend to make the profession mere copyist, and perpetuate what is now sought to be abolished, viz , one set of ideas which, how ever good, is objectionable on Principle, and unfair not only to architects as a body, as to the general public, who have to pay for these buildings and naturally expect that the best available talent IS procured. I thoroughly endorse the opinions expressed by " Ghost" in the letter following, and trust that in future we shall have competitions settled on a fair basis. I am, c, JAMES TOSH.
