New South Wales. [FROM OUR OWN CORRESPONDENT.] Sydney, 15th October. The political world here has been very much surprised by some changes that have been brought about in the Ministry, the loss of Sir George Innes was expected 1 by ill when it be. came known that Judge Hargrave had resigned, and even as soon as the resignation was stated to be likely But the access to the Treasury benches were not expected. The portfolio of Mines has rested unhold ever since Mr B iker's conscience or sense of decency some say one and some the others urged him to resign, and the generally received opinion was that as soon as the member for Curio it could get whitewashed he would be brought back with flying colours and a Ministerial flourish of trumpets Whether it is that the in- very bad disclosed so much that this cannot be done, or whether ultu r crusts are at work, it is certain that it has been resolved that the ex Munster be thrown over, and accordingly a new Chorister has been sworn in In choosing Dr Heinrick, a thick and thin supporter, a shrewd man and keen debate, the Ministry showed sound sense, and though both Mr Fletcher, the member for Newcastle, and Mr Cameron, the member for West Sydney, who is now Chairman of Committees, had been named as likely, neither would have brought that assistance to the Cabinet that Dr. Renwick ensures The next surprise was the filling up of Sir George Innes's position as Minister for Justice by the selection of Mr Foster, the (number for Newtown He was a member of the Government this Government threw out ; he has Mt during the present Parliament on the Opposition cross benches, and Ina vigorously opposed the Ministry on many occasions, so that it is id due to ed him an "independent supporter, as has now been done no excuse Moreover, it is known that he tried at the beginning of the session to form the " third party which was to oust the Ministry since the Opposition proper was so disorganised as tu but saw in it an Ministerial supporters are wroth at being paid over, and the Opposition annoy ed and spiteful at losing one of their best men, while moderate men from all parts of the House consider the ap must meet a tribute to ability with all put), not one in the long debate of India) is ung nujthuiL, but commendation to say of the gentleman who now forms the junior member of thoCibiuut The elections will come off cut), and no oppose the is expected to order of the hon gentlemen who have visited their hints As showing how unexpected was Mr Foster b taking lillico, it may he mentioned that on the very morning he was sworn in it was reported on apparently excellent authority that Ali Suttor, the Poatiuustir Gentiles, was to go back to his old price is Minister for Justin, and that Mr John Davies, CMG, is to be given his old portfolio in the postoffice Some telegraphic correspondents got hold of this, and sent it far and wide through the country Despite these diocesan political matters, the Assembly has not had a very lively week Tuesday v. 19 occupied by 1 vil, irons attack by Mr G H find (List badly) on the land laws of the colony, and tender idly on the land policy of the Government The debate was long and somewhat dreary, but it will, perhaps, not be without good effect It, at all events, has placed Mr Reid still more promising itly forward in opposition, and shown how little able Mr Hopkins is to defend anything connected with his department Wednesday was fully occupied by discussion of the Licensing Bill 111 committee, a few more clauses being disposed of It should have come on again at once on 'Illina day, but Mr. Fergusson moved the adjourn-, ment of the House on the question of the propriety of selling so much land by auction A lengthy debate and some severe criticism of the reckless manner in which we 110 disposing of our real estate was the result, after which the Licensing Bill again came on, and the House discussed a few more cIiiubcj till midnight was reached! Friday night was spent entirely in discussing the appointment of Mr Foster above mentioned, with occasional digressions 111 reference to those of Dr Renwick and Sir George Innes The most notable feature was the onslaught of Mr Cameron, who said Sir Henry Parkes, who had ever been the apostle of faithfulness to party, had forfeited all claim to fidelity by taking a colleague from the Opposi- tion. As Mr Cameron, instead of occupying his usual soft directly behind Sir Henry, went and sat on the verge of the ginger ly, probably be meant what he said The Church of England Synod is now sitting, and the attendance of dignitaries is in imposing one Every afternoon the broad-cloth decked father's meet, and discuss matters of high moment, such as the wording of prayers, the connection with the English mother Church, and the light of manage with a deceased wife's sister, but they do not see to make machine greBB Resolutions and amendments galore are moved, and, as a rule, negatived, but the actual work done as yet is trifling However, they have time before them, and are not likely to wish to abridge their holiday Smallpox news is fortunately scarce The papers is live almost entirely discontinued publishing the all progressing satisfactorily telegrams from the quarantine station, where Brok people no longer here The horrors of the black hole of the 1 anyway will never exist again in New South Wales, nor will the truth ever be known Dr. Walsh refuses to speak for reasons best known to him self, and the brutally treated Hughes, after taking plenty of time (?) to consider, appears to have made up his mind that he had better hold his tongue 1 each day the Treasury is besieged with 1 amounts for compensation, and each day their worrying brings the hon.

Promises of exhibits have been received from most of our own principal wool-growers, as well as from those in Victoria and Tasmania. We understand that it is the intention of the committee to have the wool judged by experts, and as far as possible to introduce the Continental system of making awards-that is, judging both as to quality and value per fleece. Should it be the wish of any two or more competitors in any class to appeal to English experts, or to the London wool market, for reverpion or confirma- tion of the awards, arrangements will be made by the society for having this done, and for a detailed report on each exhibit so submitted. Intending exhibitors should, if possible, forward their fleeces in cases, not in bags ; but it must be understood that the society will provide show cases, and that all wool will be exhibited in the! society's cases. AS at all wool-shows, fleeces will be exhibited as received from the grower, so that intending exhibitors should be careful to fold their fleeces as they wish them to be placed before the judges- rolled in lengths of, sly, 18in., and tied with ribbon or string. A piece of coloured ribbon carefully tied round the fleeces adds wonderfully to the attractive appearance of a wool show. The agricultural returns for Great Britain and Ireland, for the year ended 4th June last, give the number of cattle at 5,911 D24, being a decrease of 522 on the number of the previous year and the number of sheep fit 24,582,151 i a decrease of 77 per cent on the previous year.
