POETRY. 'IT'S THE THING YOU LEAVE UNDONE.' It isn't the thiriR you do, dear; It'cs \hn thin^ you've left undone Which gives you a bit of a heartache At. thH BetliD(j of tho bud. - The tender word forgotten, The letter you did not write, The flower you might hsvciBfiit, dear, Are your tmunting ghosts to-night. The ffcone you might have lifted * Out of Â« brother's way, The hit of hemtsorne counsel You were burrii'd too much to say ( Thu loving touch of tbo hand, dear, The gentle nnd winsome tune Th~fc you hud no timo or thought for, Wiih troubles enough of your own, For life is nil too short, dear, ? And Rf rrow ib nil to great To suffer our slow companion 'J h'ir, Urries until too lute j And it'n not the thing you di, deiir, Ii'b the thing you leave undone Which givpfl you a bit of a heartache At thi! Butting of tho sun.
