TO THE MOST REV. DR. MANNING, ARCHBISHOP INPAR2IB VS. (Hy favour of the Herald.) juoï.sioî.011-About three OLCI twenty years since, I received from you a note and copy of your sermon on " An apostolic Ministry," and not long afterwards poor Perceval t(niphevv of the assassinated Cabinet Minister was in con 'stint correspondence with me on the subject of in published CEtay an Ordination followed by ess is a on Extreme Junction and Taxation until the very week before he suddenly terminated his commence At that epoch you were a Archdeacon of Chichester, and he one of the Queen's domestic chaplains, and author of a volume on " Avosloho of Succession But now you are at one point in the Northern iHeimephero, and I am nearly vertical point in the Southern reject your voice has reached me, by means of navigation, and an account of a lecture by you at K.ensington I am laid up by an accident, supported by pillows, and writing with my knees for a desk, whilst you, peradventure, at this date (December 1st) have started for Home, for the 'proposed CLcumenical and what will be the result thereof Y, he can dare vaccinate J As usual, a Caledonian soothsayer, formerly an octane- rating Itcturer, along with a deceased friend of mine (Rev. E Tottenham) has sounded forth his blast, as " Alter p pa cabin accidentals elections said," and as his Equawling par- takes very much of the tone of children s brass trumpets, no doubt you will allow what he says to sound amongst children piping in the market places, and only smile at this " Artery and, unelected By making these remarks, OF preliminary you will I do not doubt pective that my design is not to assist the papal syllabus itself, but rather to discuss, by permission of u v editorial friends, what is publicly reported as your own explanation and defence thereof Here, in Australia, who are quite removed from the "uproar' and excitement v herewith you say nearly all Europe is disturbed, on account thereof. Whereby what you have Bald, m cx I put nation can be more accurately weighed As the mouthpiece, for the Sovereign Bishop at Rome, and on behalf of his Holiness, you speak thus "Your progress means divorce, I'm into in Christian marriage Year pri)£;>ie»B mains secular education, I maintain that education is intrinsically and necessarily Christian You maintain that it is a good thing for men to think as they live, and propagate what errors they please, by preaching, I say it is throwing heresies broadcast amongst the nations You say I have no authority over all Christendom , whilst I claim, as the Vicar of the Good Shepherd, to be supreme interpreter of the Christian belief You tell me that I ought to submit my self and the Romagna torn tory to the King of Italy, whereas I say that I am liberated from all Euljtction to civil rulers, that Jesus has made me not subject to any man on earth, king . or otherwise, and that on His behalf and in His name, 1 claim to be King of Kings and Lord of Lords " I take it that those five articles, thus quoted, fairly give what you have uttered at kensington 1 purpose discuss- ing three of them, the first three, at this letter to you and it God restore me to my customary good health again, in about He weeks or two months, by the same channel as this, in by intention is to di CUES the last two of the five articles quoted 1 Jw None says, by mouth of yourself,-" Your pro RTces uieHne divorce, I mains am Christian marriage Were I such a bibhopolist as the Caledonian prophets, I might [ taj, your Holiness cannot have read my essay upon mart many, of you could not thus mistake the matter But as that would not be to discuss, but to foreclose discussion, and belittle short of apetitiopnncipu, I abstain from such course, and at once join IESUO with your own proposition a. First of all it must not be forgotten that in one respect there can be no divorce allow able by God, that is to say, so long as the nuptial vow, given by the contracting UBI ties in the sight of God and his Church, is not broken on either side (or known to be broken), there can be no divorce without deadly tin I do not trouble myself about Lord Chancellor Campbell a Act, or any other national acts or decrees, I simply declare here what is the undoubted and revealed will of God, and if any obstinately reject such initiation, theirs is the bin and none of it none b Henery divorce may be granted mensa either on the one hand, for causes deemed adequate, by civilians and by civil jurisprudence, where one party formally makes affidavits in support of the prayer for a decree, but a divorce vii eulo II Hartmann may not, and must not, issue by my Civil Court of judicature, on the other hand, except upon a proven, and not a merely suspected, case of unfaith JulneEB und breach of the nuptial vow How, then, can j au ignore this diff rence, and call your assertion a just declaration against the Civil rights of the Civil subjects of European Clowns-or the Crown of England in particular ? e. For the reasons are obvious why there should be di grits and differences of judicial sentences of divorce Utter mci ropatibility of temper may cause a occu lir Judge in on Ecclesiastical Court to grant the decree prayed for and allow alimony , castaways in an ordinary Police Court a Justice of the Ft age may order an allowance per month upon proved wife discs now and can any man say there is any Bill in so doing, I Let him say so, and I will show him his error by BUie warranty of Holy Scripture Again, and in addition to incompatibility, which justifies a divorce a mensa, there may be habitual cruelly and brutally, that will, lv custom and Civil jurist Prudence justify a decree a theme as well as a n thousand is not that according to the law of ii(-btcoUfniES, i of the revealed will of God i If any man will my third is in in so doing, I will show him his error by Euro- warranty of Holy Scripture In these three ways-then, by reason of carnal unfaith- fulness, of incompatibility of temper, and of habitual entity the woman may sue for and obtain in a decree of Wrestle separation-J e , divorce and would you forbid and hinder the woman tbcbO remedies ? I say nothing at but what may justify the man's seeking to put away his wife, because he, by common law, ordinarily bag whole control of the purse, and is alone liable for punishment for debts punishments which affect not the body of the wife but if she can be proven guilty of carnal unfaithfulness, few can you deny to him, or condemn him for obtaining, a secular decree of separation r Nothing in God's Holy Word forbids such penalty upon unfaithfulness to God, on either side, and unfaithfulness to the other , what mean you, then, by such an assertion as this ?-' Your progress means divorce ' Of course I have nothing to say on behalf of any Civil marriages by sea captains, or registrars, or justices of the peace, and such like they are not authorised by God to save the !iuptnu\Wc8Bing or to administer the nuptial vow, or to unite any couple by junction of hands, and prayer for the Holy Ghost Hence such "marriages" being nothing but Civil contracts, and call relating to the leailinialinng of suffering (if any) and succession to reply, they ceremony life in this world, I will have no concern with evulaBlinp life So they are excluded from the issue raised by your rticle-oxoludod, to It is all considerations of Holy Matrimony. 22 But, in the second place, you say for 910 None Is Your progress means secular education " Here, again, To do ""'^^"u'Butt, and duly eliminate improper £10 I arsenic ' aliens of year proposition Some things are so widely Fft ,r' 80 Cü")ni(jn '" Mahommedans, Inh less, Jews and the ""v-"1^,118 reading, tightening, writing, and Lcicrurhy- shifts? km kind, 01 potentate could wilfully a less or 1 roll """"and" of all classes of their suit LIB charged, withe , ] F"? to the, whole? common- wealth to denounce am.
