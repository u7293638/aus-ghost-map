" Don'tr let it worry yori," he said "as cheerfully as he could.

CHAPER II. On the following Wednesday morn-, ing, after Job had. finished at the police court, doling out fine OF imprisonment to the various offenders against the majesty of the law in Bradley, he pro ceeded to his private parlor. His manner bespoke great agitation which he essayed to calm with a .glass^of water, into which he poured a. liberafi dose of brandy from a decanter kept in the sideboard drawer. : He was, presently followed by Mr. Fielding. "He's -here," said the chief. "I instructed Merritt to send him'npstairs in two minutes. Wybrow is on the watch, and he'll manage it. He and a pal of his have Shadowed: Morrison ever since he left the Grand yesterday, bat he has never given tbem an opportunity, and this is our last-shot." Job's only comment was to empty the glass and put the bottle away. There was no doubt his nerves wanted steadying, as he fairly jumped when the whistle in the speaking-tube was blown. " Halloo!" said Fielding, answering it. " Now, sir, he's on his way op. For goodness sake keep cool, till you see how the land lies." Again the whistle blew. " Merritt says he has met wrifh an accident, and been knocked down the staira. and he is coming up with him. Do just as I told you, and when I come out, leave it to tne" So saying he slipped under the table, the handsome cloth of which, descend ing to the floor, completely hid him. In a minute or two there came a knock at the door, and, in reply to Job's direction, the hall-keeper entered, leading by tbe arm an elderly man, fashionably dressed, but just how look ing rather disheveled and -pale as a ghost. . . " This genelman, y'r wushop, said as how heJiadan app'intment with you, so I sent bim upstairs, and just as he werelturning the second corner a man named Wybrow as Mr. Fielding engaged to clean windows was coming down with his ladder on his shoulder. He says' he slipped, and in foiling, knocked this genelman down. I heard th9 noiseandran up, but found* Wybrow had picked v himself up and was seeing to r this\ genelman, but he seems a bifcdazed-like still." "Dear,, dear.. Here, give him a drink of this," said Job, producing the brandy-bottle.. " Thanks," said the injured man, after a short time. " I feel better now, bat it quite knocked the senses out of me for. a minute or two." "I think "he'll rdo now, Merritt, thank you," said the mayor, on which the hall-keeper withdrew. Just then the whistle was blown again, and a voice from the lower regions informed Job that it was " all right ; there were twelve." It cost him a struggle to preserve' his composure, and he held the tube to his ear for some few seconds after the mouth at the other end had been re moved, with the double purpose of steadying himself and allowing his .visitor to make an investigation of his pockets which he slapped, felt in, and turned out one after another, an expression of. dismay gradually growing upon his face, ) " You wrote-me a letter," said Job loftily, taking courage as the unavail ing search proceeded, " Yes, I did," replied the other, uiakingldesperate raid on his pockets. " Will you please explain what von mean ? You say you have some letters of mine "So l had V~ cried Morrison, livid with rage arid fear. " I had tbem half an- hour ago. I've been robbed of tfaem. But make no iniBtake. Either I have that money or to-morrow those lettera shall be in the bands " " Ob, indeed I" said Fielding, as he darted from wonder the table and blew thrice sharply down the speaking-tube. Then placing himself**between tbe visitor and the door, he continued: Now you have to deal with we ; the case is in my hands!" Soon there was a sound of heavy footsteps crossing the vestibule, fol lowed by a knock at the door. ' "Stay, onteide, DawMns ; I'll call j ou when I want you." " Yery good, sir," replied the voice outside, ; '. . ? Now, sir, let me introdace myself. I am . the-;, cbief-constable - of this borongb. 1 His worship haB banded me a letter .from you . demanding money. He tells me that you have no letters of 1 his; or that, if yon have, he has no objection to your making them public. If you have any,jproduce them. No, of course you can't. I give you two minates to make up yourmind ; .either, clear out of here,-or I will 'charge you and pnt you in the cells on ' my own responsibility." Seeing he was in the toils, Morrison . made the best of it,-and picked op Bis .hat as a preliminary to departing. - . ; ^ i? Sergeant Dawkins/' said- Fielding to-" that official, who had come in joiB|rer tohiscall, "see this person off by the .next train to London, and "report to me on your return." "Very good, sir," responded Daw kins. " Oh, beg pardon, sir, but here's a letter for you ; it's just been banded in. Now, sir," turning to Morrison, " will you come with me ?" and they went out of the room. " Thank heaven for that J" said Jobj as Fielding shot the bolt in the door ; " now let's see that they are all here." With feverish haste and trembling hands he tore open the large official looking envelope which Dawkins had handed in, disclosing some old and partly- faded letters. The sight of these brought up many a tender memory to their worshipful writer, and for some minutes Fielding maintained, a respect ful silence as he pretended to study the wood carving of the handsome over- j mantel. " They're all here; twelve of them," said Job at length ; "and now to put them beyond the possibility of further mischief," he added, with a sigh, as he i tore them into small pieces and watched them burn in the grate, taming over the blackened fragments with the poker j till no trace remained. " It was . touch and go air," said ; Fielding. " I'm sorry it had to come j to that j but'Tim couldn't get a look j in, and so he was driven to knocking j him down the stairs with the ladder, and he was only just in time to locate and abstract the packet before Merritt came up. As you say, it's dead against the law-in fact, it's pure larceny,-but desperate cases require desperate reme dies. And now I hope you'll support Tim's application for a license.".
