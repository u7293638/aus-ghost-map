MR. FOSTER, M.P. Mr. Foster in politics is one of those that would take an extremely astute individual to follow. In his own opinion he evidently imagines he was born to lead. Not being content to follow the Ministerial, Country, or Labor Parties he started or at least tried to start an abortion of a party under his own leadership, which was designated the " Liberal Union." The renegades and out casts from all other parties in their endeavors to see who should be first jostled knocked each other about and very soon found out that he who will not at some time of his political career be satisfied to follow, is not now—nor ever has been—or likely to be, the one to lead. Therefore Mr. Foster stands alone in all in his glory, an office-seeker without the ghost of a chance of success. Rumor says that he offered to take the Hon. the Government Whipship gratis when Mr. O'Loughlin was appointed, but rumor may be wrong. His attitude and lukewarmness on the totali zator is a question of history. There is nothing more easy than to be absent when the person in charge of a Bill is called on to move its first or second readings. However as the North at present is deficient of men who are in a position to spare the time and money to contest the district, he has under present circumstances every chance of being returned. But if a good sound local man came forward, then I am of the opinion that R. W. Foster would have the pleasure of retiring from political life. —From the Orroroo Enterprise.
