THE GHOST. — ^ — [For the Herald. by F.J.E] A friend of the wife had turned up. A nice, lively girl, and they sat up rather late on the first night. Finally they went to bed. She upstairs to the strangers' room, while hubby and spouse adjourned to conjugal quarters on the first floor. He had just blown out the light, when there was a rapid knocking at the door, and—" Foor goodness sake let me come in, there is a ghost in my room." They got up, and Nellie (this was the friend's name) bounded in; very airily dressed, and minus slippers and stockings. It was an urgent case evidently. Hubbie at once decided to settle matters with a poker, but his faithful better half wouldn't hear of it. There might, after all be ghosts, and, "George dear. It'd kill me to lose you.'" So George stood inactive. Just then there was a noise of footsteps in the street, and the watchman passed. A lucky idea! Hubbie went up to the window, the wife holding on to him in case he might still think of fighting the ghost single-handed. Alas ; the watch- man didn't believe in disturbing ghosts. He was paid for looking after the shops, but he'd see him further for anything out- side of this. So they sat up and talked about the ghost. Nellie was sure it was a ghost. She had heard him snore in the most ghostly fashion, then heave a sigh, groan, and finally scratch the floor. A mistake? Why! she hadn't even been to sleep. At daybreak a friend passed. They hailed him, and he volunteered at once to interview the ghost. Cautiously the party went upstairs. The door was opened, but despite the most diligent search no ghost or any trace of him was found. Nonplussed, they stared at each other. While "Spot" the faithful hound, with downcast eyes, stole down the stairs unheeded. The ghost is still an unex- plained matter with them.
