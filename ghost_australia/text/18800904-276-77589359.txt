BETWEEN JOT AND SORROW. BXTTTEEN joy and Borrow, AB 'twixt day and morrow, I lay for a space; And I heard, BO lying, My old Grief Bigbing, From her far-off place. I said,"Thou art over; And where drpams hover . Thou hoverest now; In the land of thy dwelling What waters are welling, And blossoms what hough ? Old tears are its rivers, The wind that there,quivers Ts breath of old sighs; Wrtck-strewn are the shores there, And^suhset endure3 there Through infinite skies. But all there is quiet; There no wave makes riot On the waif-cumbered coasts, Where thou movest banished, But not quite vanished- . A ghost among ghoBts." 'Fhuip Bourke Marston iri the Athenasum.
