THE PRESBYTERY AND THE CON MISSION OF FAITH. TO THE EDITOR or TUB'A110U3. SIR-The last question I shall ask of Mr. Thomson will have re i rence to original sin It has been incidentally alluded to, but now Islnllisk Mr Hit linton it he believes the following to be fact-, - God made man after His own image, and therefore per evil good and bob He placed him a garden wherein there grew an apple, to which for some occult reason He had imparted such mysterious power that the very act of eating it endured the 'pier with a knowledge of good and evil The the was not in any way guarded, but the fruit was made especially tempting in order to discover it this perfect creature would be so imperfect as to transgress n positive command, even though God knew beforehand what was to be the result, and had prepared a hell of fire for this perfect creature to be tormented in for ever, as it duly proportioned til statement for idle curiosity. God fully intended time man should be good and holy, and so he would have been, but that a wicked spirit whom God, for some unknown purpose, suffered to prowl about the garden, proved too much for His purpose, and persuaded the woman to eat of the apple, while she in turn persuaded. the man. In this story it is plain that man is not in the least responsible. Was the innocence and simplicity of a newly made man a match for the cunning and craft of the prince of evil i And besides, whatever man did was the outcome, of his nature, which nature God had just given him Supposing, however, that man had been responsible, what would have been the natural sequence? Surely, he should have been destroyed, there and then. To keep him in existence for an eternity of torment, because he had eaten an apple, could not consent in any way with the character of a God of mere) But much worse than that remains We are told that God suffered the guilty pair to propagate their kind, and though it would have been easy to stay the stream of unutter- able and infinite torture at its very fountain, God was pleased to permit these two wretched creatures to cover all the world with no) made of ill starred descendants, all of them so tainted by the eating of an apple that they became wholly devoted to evil Thus there are born into the world every year at the present time some 10 or 20 millions of babies who must go to perdition, inasmuch as they will be brought up in religions that cannot save them, and will never hear of the Christian religion, which can Mr. 'Thomson tells us that the wicked go to perdition for their Bin, but they cannot avoid sir, for this original sin of Adam's has painted them so us to make them " utterly indisposed to all good, and wholly inclined to all evil " To show that I am not exaggerating, I shall quote the very words of the Confession of Faith (Chap VI.; - "L Ourflrst parents hollis seduced by the subtlety and temptation of Satan, sinned in eating the forbidden fruit This, their sin God was pleased according to His wise and holy counsel, to permit, having purposed to order it to His own glory " 2 by this sin they fell from their original righteousness and communion vi HU God, and so became dead in sin, and wholly defect in all the faculties and parts of soul and body 'J They being the root of all mankind, the guilt of this sin was imputed, and the same death in sin and corrupted nature of m eyed to all their posterity, descending from them by ordinary generation "1 From this original corruption, whereby we are utterly indisposed, disabled, and made opposite to all good, and holy) inclined to all evil, do proceed all actual transgressions 0 Ki cry EUI both original and actual, being a transgression of the righteous law of God, and can trace their unto, doth in its own nature bring guilt upon the winner, vi hereby he is bound over to the wrath of God, and curse of the law, and so made his feet to death, with all miseries, spiritual, temporal, and eternal This then is that monstrous doctrine of original sin that lies at the root of the Presbyterian faith. Does Mr Thomas believe it is Does he believe that because Adam ate an apple the whole human race is utterly in- disposed to good, and wholly inclined to evil'' Does be not see that if that were the case there could be no individual responsibility for guilt' Iden crime committed is only the sequence of Adam's transgression. Here Mr 'thomson must feel himself in a dilemma. He tells us that men go to everlasting perdition for having committed Bin, But they, poor creatures, could not help themselves , long before they were dreamt of Adam had determined for them their characters, and rendered them incapable of good and " wholly inclined to all evil " To punish them therefore would be wrong. They could not help what they did Mr Thomson will no doubt allow that this is a terrible doctrine, but defend it by saying that he finds it in the Bible If he does, I am ready to meet him In his last letter he says, among much witty but irrelevant matter, that there are no such doctrines in the Confession of Faith as I find there. However, I have quoted the exact words of that document on all occasions, and your readers will be able to perceive the evasive nature of his statement, and I need not discuss it Though this w my last question, I can find in the Confession of Faith at least a dozen others to which Mr Thomson could no more land answers than he has to those I have already asked him However, I have carried the matter as far as I need for the present, and shall only ask space for two more letters, in which I shall deal with much broader issues Yours, i.s., ALEXANDER SUTHERLAND. Nov. 21. TO THE EDITOR OF THE ARGUS Sir -It the Confession is to be condemned to the pillory for teaching the eternal punishment of the wicked, I wish to stand there along with it. I do so because I see that the Confession has already with it in this shame a heavenly companion, whom I have known for long to be the lover of my soul The Scriptures as a whole, and especially the words of Christ himself, teach that doctrine as plainly as words can teach us) tiling "the same terms are used to express the external existence of God of Christ, of the Holy Ghost the endless duration of the happiness of the saints, and the endless duration of the sufferings of the lost Equally plain are such phrases as bottomless pit unquenchable fire, tile wrath of the lamb in the day) of judgment wh it weighs with me as much as anything is the animus of the Bible and of Christ against the wick 1 in all parts of Scripture they are to God objects of opposition, hostility) duple sure condemnation, wrath, determination to overthrow the goodness of God toward them is in Scripture, the effect of John, Julienne slowness to wrath, unwilliiikn>'us til it any) should perish mere) eternal punishment of the wicked is nowhere Scriptures difficulty to its saints the thing which tried the faith of the righteous was that God should be slow to punish the wicked Right through the Bible to the Apocalypse runs their cry, "Howlong O Lord and the last e see of them is their souls under the altar in heaven crying ' How long, O Lord wilt thou not avenge our blood on them who dwell on the earth So utter!) opposed is the spirit of our universities to the spirit of God in the saints of God. Of course men can prove anything they life from the Bible. 1 nut is not due to the double fucedness of the Bible but to men a pot or of self deception the question is this-When universalist are left to them selves and time has passed and they among their own Bert express themselves in phrases natural to themselves dothevusethewords do the) imitate the manner of scripture on this subject' Had thieving the Whole to write would they have used us actual terms' would they have shown 1 its animus and purpose.

Mr Sutherlands symmetry seems to be of the kind which makes no exertions, still less sacrifices sell, for its object Does nothing but tal! a much Does nothing and then makes things even by declaring there is no danger, an 1 bitterly denouncing as cruel and hard those who say there is terrible danger Divide the world into two portions by the line of this belief in the eternal punishment of the wicked Put on the one side those who practically ignore the danger and those who boldly deny) it Put on the other side those who seriously believe it, and live under the shadow and sorrow of it Then 1 bill, on this side you will find Jesus Christ and His apostles, you will find all the Catholic "saints and doctors, you will find all (the Protestant martyrs, reformers, revivalists all the philanthropists of the type of Wilberforce, and Howard, and the Earl of Shaftesbury On this side you will find the praying mothers on the other the bad boys the mid- night gentry, the shedding of blood, and Mr W Worldly Wiseman to keep them in countenance There are two wayS of being liberal and charitable The one is to give away your own, the other is to give away what is your neighbours, or Gods A j that one kind of liberality increases the other diminishes Out single congregation in Edinburgh gives £3,000 a year to help weaker congregations, and other thousands to missions They are a people who have been taught to dread eternal life.
