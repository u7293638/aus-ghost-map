I should like to seethe doum&ncrd; of this little farce, Henri, my boy, and to know how this nymph of the foot l-gfatshan snddenty developed into a virtuous Bi-itish matron. Where hes she been lately?' Do you know?' .No. There was a terrible sSr about her at Vienna;- She was wanted in some police case. I never knew, quite «hat about.

Mrs. Paul Challis ! It seems incredible.' * I am inclined to think your eyes have played you false, Henri.' ' Tney could not. If I were doubtful I could indentify her at once by a mark on her neck. I saw it before I spoke.' 'Amark?' ' Yes — a scar. I was present when she got it. Our knowledge of each other dated from that hour.' ' ' How did she get it r, ' Running between two fellows who were fighting — people said about her any way, the sword, or whatever the was that one of them held, caught her across the neck, and for a minute every one though she was killed. It was at the Opera House in Brussels. How the quarrel had arose no one seemed quite to know, and she would never teUi I was hanging about the place, as I used to be very fond of doing, and it was into my aims she fell. The wound was bad, but not dangerous, and she will carry the scar to her dying day. It looks like a white line in her dark skin, and I saw it as she turned her head just now. She always used to weac her hair low to cover it. She had it put higher up to day.' ' ' ' Feeling safe, I suppose, Ifs a queer affair, Henri. I'd advise you to* keep your fingers out of it for the future, my boy.' ' I intend to, I can assure you. Fay is too determined and unscrupulous a a woman to offend seriously. bheshaH go unharmed for me. The Nemesis she defies wQl overtake her some time, if she does not mind, without my help.' Dolores had such a scar as had been described — a thin white line, extending across the side of her neck. Thejwound had been gived when she was quite a child, she told her husband by falling through a window. It had been a mercy that she was not killed, and only the most skilful surgery had made the Tfittylr as sligKt as it was. It seemed as though the little white line hail some feeling in. it, as they were driving back through the Bois, after the uncomfortable incident at the cafe, for she put up her' hand to it more than once. ?* Does your head ache, dear ?' her husband asked. ' So that old ecar on my neck has taken a fit cf burning and pricking. It docs sometimes. I suppose I am ner vous, but it seems as though- I could fed the edge of the glass as it cat when I fell with my head through it. Ugh!' She shuddered as she spoke, with a face that was white even to the lips, and he looked at her in ahum. '? My darling, you are ill,' he said. ' No, I don't think I am,' she replied, forcing a smile. I do feel sick and cold. I think I was 'frightened just now, and then the other night. What a dreadful thing to be mistaken for another person, and such a person. Oh, Paul, I— ??Ton xthalB, dear f* ' I was going to Bay I was afraid that yon thought it was not a migfofa*, and that I ? ' wMy darling Doleres, don't cry,' Cap tain Chaliis eaid, for she had broken down in her faH-pring speech, and burst into bitter weeping. ' What a notion to take into your head !' ' Bat I Baw it in your face. Paul, when that young- man spoke to me. I saw the terror, the horrible fear that it mirht be true.'' The fear had been there, indeed, but he would not have her 'know it if he could help it ' My darling; don't tike fancies,' he said. 'Both parties acknowledged their mistake, and if they had not, do you think I -wonld take anyone's word against yours ? Yon had only to say to me, ' Paul, it is a Ke !' and though all the world swore it, I would stand up and hurl the falsehood back into the teeth of the ufcterers of it.' ' And will you always trust me so, Paul — always believe in me, even in the face of such slanders as these few days ? in Paris have brought against me?' 'TiU I die , my littte wife. My life and my faith injron will end together, I flunk.'. She nestled closer to his side, and stole her hand into his. ** Take me away from Paris,' she said ' I am so sorry we ever eame here.' ' Are yon tired of it^ dear ?' ' Not of Paris ; bat if I am so like this woman who seems to have been known here, it may all happen again. Take me home, Paul; and ask your mother to forgive you and love me. .1 want rest and a borne where I can be a better and braver woman.' *? Mylsrling, we will leave Paris to morrow if you life, but I would rattier not go back to England just yet. I. want all the idle gossip to be quite blown over Before I introduce my beau tiful wife, and I wasitfe hear apiece of news which Iain hourly expecting be- . fore I turn my face homewards again.' ^Newsr 'Tea, dear.' -Whatisitf' He hesitated a moment, with an odd for the acquaintance had been made at the house ofa. mutual friend where Agnes had been . visiting, bnt he was perfectly satisfied from what he heard from others, and froai Paul himself who wrote ast-ing his consent. Then had followed the visit to Mrs. Challis — that lady, being in Yorkshire for a time, bad taken the opportunity of going to Went Vale and introducing herself She had taken Agnes to town with her, and ber son was to fee the young lady's escort back. To be continued. mile playing about the comers of his mouth. ' It is nothing disagreeable, I can see,' she said. ' Won't you tell me?' ' I want to hear that Miss Daibtree, my tonnes Jiancee, has consoled herself for my desertion,' he replied, with an uneasy little laugh. ' The world looks upon me ss a heartless monster, and the young lady as a martyr ; but I aru hour ly expecting to hear that she has found consolation for the blow I inflicted on her vanity. I don't think it went deep er.' ' I hope it didn't I shouldn't like to think of any woman suffering because of me. How could you do it ? Mrs. Trent used to say she was very beau tiful.' ' So she was in one style — not like you. How could I love yon, do you want to know ? I could no more fell you than fly like yonder bird. It was fate, destiny, kismet. Call it what you like ; but it was to be. It was a case of witchcraft, I think. It was yoor enn bewitched me see, I couldna help mysel,' lassie.' There was no „ question of Dolores leaving Paris the next day1. She was really ilL Her nerves' had been un strung, thedoctor whom Captain Challis called in in his alarm said; two or three days rest would set her to rights.
