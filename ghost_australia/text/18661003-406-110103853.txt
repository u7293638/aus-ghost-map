General Jiyon, * late of the Confederate ar^^' according to the Pall Mall Gazette, is said to bare discovered another lost city in Mexico, in the district called by the Indians Metaltaloyuca, situated about 100 miles westof TurpaU, in the state of Vera Cruz, lrees, hundreds of years old; arte growing amidst zketfuins. Tfe walls of niany houses standing, and on them are paintings and other ornaments, and carved doorways and images abou&d; in ev6ry. strefet. TherS ate Several temples, and a statuette was found, upon the reverse of whicli was,a cross. The doors of the houses are generally closed with huge blocks of stpne, and there are other indications that tbe abandonment of the city was due to a preconcerted movement. A curious story has been going the round of the New Zealand^ papers, whence it has been transferred to the columns of some Victorian journals. As the tile runs, a Nvw Zealand colonist on his way to Melbourne, purchased from a fellow- passenger a piece of crystal, which, oxl being placed in the hands ot a lapidary in this city, proved to be a diamond of inestimable value. This precious gem the {man is said to be now carrying about -New Zealand. Unhappily, a letter in the dispels the illusion. Nothing is known m Melbourne of this antipodian Eoh-i- noor. Loed Beougham osr Continental Aefaibs . —At a, meeting of the House of Eords^ Lord Brougham said: r—" Whatever be our proceedings at home; I cannot look to the Continent without the utmost horror,, and indeed astonishment at such a state of cruel and general war among Christian men, arid m the nineteenth century. Thousands and tens of thousands are gathered together to murder one another, if en are applying them selves to invent new modes of, destruction; and new ways of destroying each other's lives. The whole of Europe is set face to face hi conflict, and all have only tlie clioice o£ murder- or slaughter of being the wrong doers or the victims. It, is frightful to con template this fury of Christian nations in our advanced age of civilisation! Of all the guilty nations we must confess Austria has the least to answer for. She lias acted wholly in self-defence,' and is blameless, except perhaps at the beginning in the a#air ? I^cbies, but all her late conduct and her great losses have been-in defensive war. But she has succumbed, and gives up Venetia. Now, tbe kingdom of Italy has no right whatever to the least, extension of her terri tory, nor to a single acre more than she gained before tbe peace of Villafranca. The Venetians, on the other hand,- had an! ample right to be supported in throwing oft a foreign yoke; and all must rejoice in what ever has helped them to gain their indepen dence. But this is a wholly different matter from the Italian kingdom extending its terri tory. I lately reminded you of the saying that a bystander sees more of the game than the players. Here we have a bystander who hot on]y sees more of«it, but who is supposed to be bent upon taking part in its result, whichever party gains, whichever loses. But the feeling in Prance is so universal, and so strong for peace and against war, that we may trust to its effect upon her rulers, and "that it will prevent them from anything which can throw difficulties in- the way of- the Con ference which must now be held for-settling the rights and "the claims of all parties, and1, it is devoutly to be hoped, for establishing a general peace." A Gentle Hint.—At a concert which took place lately, a gentleman in the audience rose up just as the third piece in the programme had been performed, and said, u Mr Con ductor, will youloblige me, sir, by requesting your vocalists either to sing louder, or to sing in whispers, as there is a conversation going on close by where I sit, that is conducted in such a" loud tone as to h i n dermy enjoyment 6t the music. I prefer certain]^ jobear the concert; but if I cannot be so privileged, I desire to hear the conservation."
