AUSTS1LI1S, At BioM Hill Broken Hill, November 3. George Thyer committed suicide by hang ing himself in the Southern Cross Hotel this morning. He 'arrived at the Hill yes terday, and stayed at the hotel. He was very quiet all day, and had tea at the usual hour. Shortly afterwards he went to bed, and was discovered this morning attired in underpants and a singlet, hang ing by a strap to the footrail of the bed.

My life has been a wreck. I have nothing to live for: now, and could not marry my poor to drag her into misery. I had thought I could settle down now, but I had no hope.
