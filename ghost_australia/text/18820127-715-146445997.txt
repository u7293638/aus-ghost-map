Bishop Reynolds at Border Town. , - (FROM QUA OWN CORRESPONDENT.), January 25. We lave been honored by*a ?'visit-fro rn the Bight Reverend C . - A. Reynolds, D.D., Lord Bishop (R.C.*) of Adelaide, who-arrived here on/Mjpnday^Jast in a <smveyance, drawn by four horses, from Gaston, sent especially to meet his Lord ship by Mrs. B. J. Jones of the Border Town Hotel. He arrived here at about 6.30, Accompanied by the R«v. Father O'Ueil, of Benola, and was welcomed on his arrival ^by a few members of his ? Church. Had the notice of his visit been lonfrer no -doubt there would have befen a rough larger mtister, but as it was, few, except those in the town and its iniine l-diate-environs, could have known any thing about his visit. On Tuesday morriingthere was-confes sion and mass at 9 a.m.j and those who - were about to present themselves for con firmation-partook of the holy communion. At 11 o'clock his Lordship delivered .* very heartfelt and impressive address to the assembled congregation, in. which he pointed ont the paramountimportance of attention to religious thought andJduties. It was not absolutely necessary to have a church building. Habits of pious thought and devotional practices shontd'~be culti vated in each one's breast, in each one's home. Every one should <iaily bring himself before .the, tribunal <»f his ow'u conscience. How many could stand the searchings of that stern monitor i But too many thrust its warnings aside, think ing that some chance would save them hereafter. This wasjjot as itought tojbe. Everyone should seek their Creator in humbleness and - con triteness pf heart; not with the feeling but too pre valent in .human hearts that we are no worse than our neighbors, and that it will all come right in the end. His Lordship iiiBtenced ihe parable of the prodigal son as typical of the spirit of true humility and sincere repentance .wUTTrwhich ,"vref |K($ildi ap proach thej Alaugh^yi ^3; s^osreiiiow all approaches ^in~this spiHt frd\il<f Be sbre - toWmetbyour merciful jjEtedeemer more "than-half-way." ffi°> idno rrminflrfl hifi hearers that there was m> Jjetter.refuge from the' cares, trials, troufclea and vicissi tudes of this' life than a firm-reliance on ihe gSodnieBr TrfDiviire Providence.
