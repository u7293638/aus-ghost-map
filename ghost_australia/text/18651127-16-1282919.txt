(From the Some Kews, September 20.) Tun most magnificent September within ro colloclion has fairly cleared London of all who aro ablo lo leave it, and although two millions sind a half of human beings still inhabit the metropolis, the west end squares and streets exhibit a desolation that íb said to be depressing. I uso the qualifying phrase, for though tee usual address heads my letter, it is written from a village in the Highlands of Scotland. A per- son would hardly consider that ho had com- plied with the ordinary customs of 6ociety, and litted 1 iinself to be received in the Balooiib in winter, if ho had not during tho autumn buried himself somewhere out of the noise of car- riages, and tho reach of the postman. I have run, as has been said, into the regions of those who call themselves aborigines, and who make a slight mistake in their pedigree, as happens in tho case of many peoplo who do wear trousers.

declare that one of their own craft must and shall be chosen, and, as they are the large majority, they will have their way. I hope that it will be a long time before they are called upon for a decision, but as tho subject is one of homo talk, I am entitlod to mention it. Thoro has existed for many yoars in England n vory small, voluntary association of philan- thropic individuals, called tho Aborigines Pro- tection Society. It is well known by name in all tho colonios, and by its notion in somo of thom. Tho society nuinbors very fow persons, but it maintains all tho paraphernalia of a. largo body ¡ it collects information, kcops up au ox tonsivo correspondons with tho colonies, issuos printed voports, addresses, and manifestoes, and holds an annual public mooting, Uko other bono votent institutions, generally at Exeter-hall. Tho object of tbo society is plainly avowed in its title-to protect aboriginal tribes against tho encroachments of tho white man. It is based upon tho assumption that the contact of tho white man with tho aboriginal man, which ought to bring improvement and prosperity, brings, on the contrary, nothing but wrong, and wretchedness, and cruelty ; and it wholly excludes all recognition of tho inevitable law of gradual absorption and ultimate ex- tinction of the weaker by tho stronger, tho barbarous by tho civilised, which governs all human progress. If the Aborigines Protection Society were to set itself against colonisation, and endoavor to persuade mankind to forego all future enterprises and conquests, and to live to tho end of tho world on tbo one natal spot, making the rood of earth which once supported its man maintain countless generations as accu- mulating ages rolled on, the said Society would be taking a very absurd line of conduct, but it would at least have tho advantage of reasoning consistently on wrong principles. Or, if it ad- mitted colonisation as a necessity growing out of the expansion of population, and addressed itsolf to the better regulation of tho process, so that the advancing steps of tho white man should be everywhere guided by justice and humanity, the Sooioty would be jus- tified in their labors by the highest sanctions of morality ; although tho interference of an or- ganised body of any kind in matters of ' such grave social and political importance would bo still open to serious objections. But the Abori- gines Protection Society does not adopt either of these courses. It assumes tho function of advisor to all distressed tribes, and wo aro com- pelled to add that, with tho best possible inten- tions, it gives the unfortunate natives the worst possible advice. Instead of seeking to ameliorate the inevitable evils coincident to colonisation, it devotes itself to the extremely dangerous function of counselling tho natives how to avert, overcóme, or correct them. It speaks a language to tho natives which tho natives can hardly avoid interpreting to tho disadvantage of the whites, and tho obvious result of its meddling is that it invariably succeeds in impressing upon tho native a keener sense of his wrongs than he bad before, and in inflaming tho hostility between tho two races, which it is tho duty of all philan- thropists to endeavor to soften and abate. A late address of this Society to tho Maoris of Now Zealand affords a rcmai'lmblc illustration of the mischievous tendency of its proceedings. In this address, tho Maoris aro advised not to soil or lease thoir land, and, by woy of preclud- ing tho possibility of such transactions, they aro urged to pass a native law prohibiting indi- viduals from parting with their property, oven when thoy wish to do so ! Thoy aro rcoom monded also to encourage mavnagos for tbo sako of increasing the race, to culti- vate the wisdom of the serpent and the harmlossnoss of the dovo (which tho Aborigines Protection Society ovidently thinks it a vory easy thing to do), and to establish a printing press for the purpose of " printing thoir own thoughts." All this is vory silly and childish, and botrays a total want of practical knowledge and ooiumon sonso ; but it is also calculated to load tho poor pcoplo lo whom it is nddrossod hito fresh troubles, to render their situation moro doplorablo than over by inspiring thom with fnlso vloivs and falso hopes, and to increaso a hundredfold the difficulties of a poaoo ful and cquitnblo sottloment botivoen tho colo- nists and tho natives. l'or theso reasons, it is vory dosirable that tho real status and character of tho Aborigines Protection Socioty should bo niado known amongst the Maoris, and that, above all things, thoy should not be allowed to sup- pose that it ropresonts the opinions of tho poople of England, or oven of any appreciable section of them.
