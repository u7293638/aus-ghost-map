TUBF NOTES. [By Uipi-arion.1I BmsiiANE, August 25. The Treasurer's proposed tax of 2j per cent on all monies passing through Hie totalise tor will crippln tlie clubs throughout the colony, and it it docs not extinguish racing will lower the standard o( the sport hy reducing prizes, curtailing entries, hindering improvements, discouratrinc buyers (and breeders. If such a tax be legitimate, and, except in the amount to be levied, the proposal does not meet with much opposition, there can be no reason why the percentage should be so much higher than that imposed upon other gambling profits — the dividend tax, for instance, and B3j per cent on profits, which is what the 2} per cent all round upon investments amounts to, strikes one as exorbitant and unnecessary. A levy of half the amount would bring into the Treasury con siderably more than £0000 per annum, which Sir Thomas estimates as the revenue from the tax. Last year, at Eagle Farm alone, some £80,000 passed through] the totalisator, and 2J per cent upon this would have brought in £2000. At Breakfast Creek the average annual investment in 0m in.ichine may be reckoned at over £50,000, which would give a return to the Treasury of £1250. Some £G0,O00, at the lowest estimate, must be put through an nually at Charters Towers, which would benefit the Treasury to the amount oi £1500. £30,100 is an under, rather than an over estiiiiai*; ul uie &uui; imuBieu at uouparou during tlie year, which means a return of nearly £800; so that from Hrislisine and Char ters Towers alone the pioposrd :!- per , cut would bring in a revenue of over Ci'iOIWii \\-™r. Taking Pole's Turf Guide for lBni-'IJ ;isa f'uirly accurate return of the moetings held during the year, we lind no less a number than 150 indexed and reported ; at most, if not at all, ot these the totalisator is used, and the invest ments range from £10,000 per annum down to £100, or thereabouts. It is not a high estimate to 6et down investments at these 150 meetings at £'.10,000, which would yield the Traasury more than £0000 or a total of £12,000 a year, li.y reducing the tax one half Sir Thomas would obtain the £0000 he requires (see budget speech.)

Hut is not the name of this Club a ruitnomer ? not a single item in the Iprogramme being for. uatcur riders. If the Club called itself an Experimental Turf Club or a (Supplementary Ilacing Club it would be more appropriate. An Amateur Turf Club without the amateur or pro vision for him Reenis as absurd at Hamlnt, witli the Prince of Denmark and the ghost also left out. Klymas and M.L.A. (by Archie— Mona Lee), 2 years, left last week for Sj-pnoy, in charge of their trainer, J. Stone. Tlie joofeoys, W. Stone and J. I''uniuhar6on, accompany the party. Kl.vraas is deeply engaged at the Hawkesbury and Randwick spring meetings, and M.L.A. may start at Sydney Tattersall's on Saturday in the 2-j'oar-ofd stake*. ltockliumpton Tattorsall'b handiuappcr lumped the weight on Urn Soutliorn horses Prime Minister, Uolmdil, Edna, TW, and Belle, mxl none hiive aaocpted j the 'contents,' indeed, for all handicaps are very few. Mr. Hastings tells mo ' Iio 'ill go Nortli no more; | the company down South may be better, but be Kets a show there.' Prime Minister is a groat ' horse when well, but lie has done nothing in public to justify the welter weight put upon him at Kocltliumpton. The Bundaberg inaro, Edna, had no morcy shown her, at 9 st. 12 11). and 9 St. 18 Ib,, for, allowing that the company is only modcrato, Edna herself is only a moderate marc, and the notion of hor being able to givo the lump of weight she is asked .to ooncode to horses like Young Sardonyx, Buckingham, Bouquet, Zingara, Nir Thomas, and Priority, three or four of whom would probably beat her at oven weights, is a strange one. Tbe meeting comes oil the wook after next. I There Moms to have been first-oloHS raoing t at Gympic, so far as close and exciting finishes { Ro ; but (he attendance, says the local papers, ' was very poor, as indued might be guessed by | tho totdigator investments, wbJob earns to less than £900 during tb« two days. Ihe tuns el the meeting seems to have been the threeyear old Cyclone, who in xaid to be hy Euclid out of Cecilia (I am open, however, to correction on this point), and who pulled off three of the four races he was engaged in, Cecil, by Euclid — Coiilin, ran a fairly good hornr to win the Spring Handicap, hut as Coronella (,'ftvc him nearly 9 Kt. and a beating, o\er a mile, on the second day, 1'edley'n black golding can hardly be ^reckoned a champion. Mr. Powers' recent purchase, ltainbow, liy Magcnlut— Satirist mare, seems to have run er ratically, with n tendency to go off nt a tangent in nearly all his races, hut whon ho could be kept straight he miuinged to vustain his rcpnliitinn, nnd win neilitnlil.y. It would be interesting to know wlinl H 0'r ilniu of that useful, mill, perhaps, mm' limn m-HiiI, .'.'elding, ltoiciivven. who rnn m well t uoiI'iImuI the meeting.
