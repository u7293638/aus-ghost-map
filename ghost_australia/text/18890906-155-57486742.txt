AN IRATE POET. - Never, sinco the days of Pope and Do?nis, Ihas rniything quite so savage appeared .l literaturo as Mr. ltobert Browning's littli ode, "'To Edward Fitzgerald," published in the last 1â‚¬d/urssse. Mr. Aldis Wright, in his "Life and Letters" of the translator of OmaA Khayyamt, had most incautiously admtted a hasty sentence of tho geuial "Fitz," which ran: "hIrs. lrowlrig's death is ratht a relief to meno, I must say: no more Aurora Loigha, thank God! A woman of real genius 1 know; but what is the upshot of it all I She and her sex had beotter mind the kitchen and the children; and oerhps the ]poor. Except in such things as little' novels, they only devote themselves to what meol do much better, leaving that wlhichb men doworso or not at all." Mr.. rowning, it seems, lighted on this unlucky passago-never of courep, meant for the public eye-and blazot forth into the subjoined volcanic verses: To EuvwAio FITRoErAT.no I chance upon ras new book yestcrtay; I ene d it, anid, whore my singaer tay 'Twixt ingo and suncut Jluge, these worns I rcad- ore s.ix or seven at rmoot--and losrnslI thereby That you, Fitzagenld, whom by t?ar and eye ' he never knew, " thank God ay wife was dealt.'

ItrsirerT hnowvtss. Toto're an?r?ise! Should a great poet thus,. or a fretfnl phrase, avenge the dead uporn the dead, by tolling him who wns the "best rivned" of LordyTennyson, and author, in the wayof translation, of the "one thing done divinely well," that his ghost is nrot good enough to spit at 9 Mr. Aldlis Wright iar ccr. teinly tiuch to answer for.
