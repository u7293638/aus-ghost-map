THE LAST MOMENTS AND BURIAL OF CAPTAIN GIFFARD. 'London Globe.' The 'Krentz Zritueg' gives the following des- cription of the last moments and burial of prod Captain. Giffard under the head of Lower Danube. June 12:— 'We have received interesting dates from Odessa of the 2nd ,of June. On that day, at three p.m., the interment of Captain Giffard, of the Tiger, took place. By order of General Osten- Sacken, the whole crow, prisoners of war, as well as the Governor General Annemkoff, with the other. military authorities, attended the funeral. A Russian battalion in parade order formed an escort to the coffin. and fired the usual vollies over the grave. Nearly the whole population was afoot, and followed the procession. Tins sturdy General Osten-Sacken look the deepest interest in the fate of the captain during his illness. A little before his death, Giffard called the crew around his bed, and said—‘Lads, you owe your lives to my being wounded : this hin- dered me from blowing up the ship. Farewell! Greet our dear England for me when you see , it. After these words he asked for a gin's a of lemonade, and turned his face from the sailors to the other side, and gave up the ghost.’ Captain Giffard’s Widow. —The widow of the lamented Captain Giffard visited Odessa; in the Vesuvius, under the, safeguard of a flag of truce. She was permitted to land, accompanied by Captain Powell, and remained there 21 hours collecting, par- ticulars of her husband's dying moments, which were those of a hero meeting his death in his coun- try's cause.' The crew of the Tiger, .on seeing a British naval uniform pass their place of confine- ment, were about hailing the wearer with a British cheer, thinking their moment of deliverance from captivity had arrived, but were very judiciously silenced in time by a sign from Captain Powell.
