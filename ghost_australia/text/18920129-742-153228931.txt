CHRISTIAN CONFERENCE. bis,— ?Jft' the conference now sitting, per mit me to offer a few thoughts suggested by your notice of it in yesterday's issue. Has it ever occurred to you what an extraordinary sight it must be to the angels to see a com pany ef God's childen gathered together to ask for the outpouring of tbe Holy Spirit i upon them ? Do they not know that the ! Holy Ghoet was shed forth at Pentecost, and being so 6ent forth, is to-day upon the earth an ignored and grieved spirit I What mar such an object, and thus present united testi mony to a practical denial of the presence of the Holy Ghost upon the earth. That such is the aspect Godward must be apparent to every intellicent honest soul, and blessing out of such a gathering can only legitimately be looked for in proportion as individual true souls arc confounded at all they see and bear. Trusting that in the cause of truth you will kindly pive this a place in a our columns, and thereby enlighten some.—' Your*, etc., A Believer in Hebbews n.} 6.
