He appeared to. be laboring for the maintenance of a policy in which he.had^not himself . the sUghtest faith. He was evidently the' advocate of dobtrines with which, whether as* ' a 'philosopher ^ oir;* states man, 'h* ? had '; -no 'Sympathy.' He did not' ' even - maintain - the /attention, much; less excite the enthusiasm ..of -those who _sat( behind him. The House rapidly thinned during the delivery of his riot' over-lengthened speech.. The Attorney-Xxerieral followed hiin, arid with| great simplicity and some force disposed of the: new1 riddles which the right hon. gentleman had given to the ^Committee to solve. .Then came ,a battle -jof the lawyers, in which Br. Ball, Sir ^Rburidcll Palmer. Mr. Walpole, and Mr^ 'SulUvan.'-'joine'd issue.' The ! discussion1 afterwards took' *'; s6mewhat more general turn. Mr. Gladstone reviewed: the discussion! (with great firmness i-of j -judgment and vigor of expression; but Mr.. :I)isiaeli^ rousing himself jfrom his comparative', apathy in the earlier; part- of 'the' evening,' concluded- -the' debate/ with a passionate declamation, in which he reiterated,- but in- a somewhat modified sense, his-. previous, paradoxes,., and 5 endeavored ? to bv§rwhelm his political, antagonist by, ascrib ing to Tiim the utterance^of principle.s'' whi'chj in their' logical applicatibh, worild ? involve (England 'arid Scotland, aV-well- as Ireland,-' '* in general tfuin, and 'an /entire dissolution of the bonds ' of society.' ' A ;few, quiet; words of ex-. jdanation,and-orrectiQP.fr9m Mr. Gladstone *ook the Btdng outor, this fiprce ;iiivective; and. Ithe Committee, resbUed on 'the disesfeablish^ ment clause' of the Bill by a: majority of 323. i On Monday the {Joritmittee was; resumedj and ;Mr. Disraeli being absent in- consequence of. an jattack of gout, hts-'phwsi was supplied by Mr. iGathorne.HardyyiWhp.was unusually measured in his opposition, and strove, not always effec jtually, tor keep his -friends in order. ' Three ipoints were discussed, and decided i the first, ithat the Bill- should come into~. force; so far as ;it8rdisestablishing clause was' concerned, on the list ©f -January, 187LfMr, Pisraeli's amendment : would have- made it 1S72, but after a brief debate it was rejected by'a majority of 107. The j section relating to the constitution and pbwers j of the 'Commisfeibriers 'having- been postponed, ithat which, comprehends -the Idisendowment I clauses came on for. discussion., -Those clauses, i too, were carried with only verbal amend i ments by a majority of '10 *. Thte Uom i nuttee ' then ~ advanced to the cbmpensa i tioii ( clauses, and the first great ques j tibn' ?'- of debate ; was . whether the com? ' pensation to be given to holder^; of benefices : should be diminished by deducting from their : annual imcome fhe salaries they had been ; accustomed to give to permanent curates. i Bla'ny appeals' were made- to the compassionate : generosity of the ; , Jdommittee on -behalf . of : curateB.by members who did not seem to under j stand, that the clause they were discussing had ; relation, riot to the. interest of curates, but to ! those 'of incumberitk.1;:'-'Tlie Attoriey-General ' for Ireland, ? ;the' ' 'SbucitoivGeneral, ? and Mfc Gladstone, :placed:- thej matter: in the. clearest light, and the jesult wa» that the, deduction proposed to be 'insisted on was refused by, a majority of '98 votes. ' Theposltion taken up by KTf. Disraeli on I^idayn^ght' is' likely- to have very serious results -for himself-' as/* party leader. I* will aliehatfl for Mm th'e support of the influential JHigh Church clergy,: whose , spe -cud, abhorrence is . the doctrine pi ' phe .royal supremacy;, of which the, right 'hon. /gentleman hsfs become so 'enamored. : jAs '!a -body, J they supported him at the late ; general election, They 'are now toldbj] their- -leader'., in ???. Par- liament that without its head the Church of England would have neither purity of doctrine, nor decorum of worship, nor a salutary disci pline, nor wise government. All these spiritual privileges, ''-so venerable- and so legitimate,' are secured to the Church by the authority and power jof the Queen, and by nothing else. This, and this alone, isthe rock on which the Church is. founded, the guarantee that the gates of hell stiail not' prevail against her. ' 'Even, to think of a.Conservative High Churchman reading this, almost, nays thef Pall Mall ?Gazette, takes away one's breath. . Hitherto he has j held that by an inscrutable decree of Providepce, .these perni cious doctrines' were permitted1 to be - held by men like Lor4 Weitbufy'of'Lord Cairns, but-fco have them' openly preached by the political leader whom, with, some -misgivings, he has been accustomed te follow, must be an utterly unexpected blew. A politician who maintains that the Queen-is the Anglican Pope, and that .the best, possible condition for the Church is to be under, the absolute control of the State, will do well tit 'make' rip his mind to dispense' with sacerdotal support. ' : ? : =' . . v ..: .;. '- - LaBt night (Thursday) the House resumed the consideration of clause 14, and was occupied with it seme hours. The divisions in the course of 'the evening Were' marked 'by the usual majorities of 100 to 115 on the side of the GoverninentV and if any -supporter of the 'Ministry felt: cbinpunction in supporting , the terms of compensation proposed by the Bill, it .would be more than dispelled upon due consi deration. ' Irish rectors arid Irish curates will he secured in the enjoyment of such incomes as 'they have hitherto received;' - arid this is no slight matter; but it is scarcely necessary, to add that the Free Irish Episcopal Church of the future will be neither poor in ..wealth nor weak in sprrit.. .The landholders of Ireland are Pro testant, and it cannot be supposed that the Irish gentry will be slack to support the minis ters of the communion to which they belong. The. Ghuroh. body will be endowed with chyrches, with ecclesiastical residences, and .with commutations, arid the reconstruction of the IrishChurch will enable its governing Com mittee or Trustees to promote the claims of merit and of zeal in a degree little inferior ikt that hitherto possible under the or ganization of the Irish Establishment.' The amendments still to be debated refer to the constitution of the' neV Church body, the^rate of commutation for life incomes, the disposition of the glebes and churches, the permanent en dowment for maintenance of 'worship, as pro posed by Mr. Disraeli, the date from which grivate endowments 'are to be preserved for the hurch, ' the redemption ' of the tithe-rent' charge,' the Regiwm Donum, and Maynooth com pensations, and the' application of the surplus, which Mr.Whalley desires to,see used for the redemption of the National Debt. The chief ooauicts will arise nponthe disposal of the glebe 'lands, whioh Sir George Jenkrnson would hand over entire, with all churches and schools, to1 -the newOhuTch body 5 and as to the private - endowments, the same member proposing to fix the year 1560 as the date from which private, endowments shall belong to the Church. Mr., Disraeli would have all lands devised by Royal grant or ? statute since the ! second year bf Elizabeth transferred to the Church body. There are thus materials for at least half a dozen more evenings'' debate in Committee. On the third reading Captain Archdall is to . move the extension of ^he BUI to England and Scot land — a move in Which ^sbme of the Conserva tive, journals seem to see much ground_for hops. . -The unsatisfactory condition and inefficieht service's of the House of Lords has come up for i discussion sooner than was , expected. Early in ;the sessipn a member of the Lower House called attention1 W the objectionable -mode of electing1 the Scotch and Irish representative peers — a virtual inpnopoly in thethands of the Duke of Buccleugh and Lord . Derby respectively-— and Mr^ Gladstone replied that it was one of the questions of the future. Then the ' energetic .Marquis of- Salisbury has endeavored more , equally te divide -the 'initiative of legislation between the, two. Houses, and has got a joint Comriiittee to consider'the: subject. Earl Rus seH, having no particular work to do, and being averse 1 to ? be consigned to .'dumb forgetful ness,' has revived the subject of life peers, with the view of .reinforcing their lordships' . House. ? 'The . Whig yetera^ , aepproirig- to the plan _ pro posed by hirii *ori 'the 9th instan't, in » Bill submitted to the ' Lords j would give to -the Crown power to create life Peerages to '-a. -limited number of persons possessed of certain, defined qualifications.; -The number of these creations he would.restrict to 28 at . any one time, arid to four in any one year; Thus it would take seven years' from the passuig of the Act to make up the total addition to the number bf peers authorised tpbe created undent— an interval exceeding the prpbahle duratioii of any single AflministratibiL - Lord Russell's Bill' de fines the different classes from which, life1 Peers ? are to be taken.

LjSwe has been able to surprise the House of Commons and the couritry. His budget is unique and' ingenious. In- his financial speech on the 8th the right hon. gentleman 'acted his part with consummate skill. First he told hi? lugubrious', pfory.. The' receipts . for the' year; were estimated ai,t' £72,8 0,000; and ? the expen diture at £68;223,O00. -Thus a ^nominal balanoe of £4,632,000; was' exhibited after allowing for £2,261,000, the- economies of the year. But, alas ! the surplus no -sooner appeared 'as a phantom than it vanished.' £4,600,000 is re quired- to raieet the extra t»st of the Abyssinian ?war i and Pairing ; this huge . amount , off, , ithere.' was left the mere ghost of a surplus in ithe shape of £32,000. The House being thus reduced to the depths of financial woe, the Chancellor, of, the Exchequer had recourse to ' his ? ^Parliamentary magic' - ' to raise its : -? spirits. ? The . xesulti : is, ; pithily in dicated 'in j.P«mcA's j cartoon iMs waek :— Professor Bob : — ' There is no' deception — the bag is .empty. Hey, prfesto, pass ! (Pro duces the eggl);, Sarpliis 1 ! !' Professor Ben : ** Why. we could ia' done that-^— (Pauses)— -if we'd only thought' on it'.'; The operation: is highly ingenious, and is probably due in part to Mr. Gladstone's .financial cunning.. Mr. lib we proposes to transfer' the collection bf a number of taxes from parish Officers to the s Excise ; to change most of the assessed taxes -into licence duties j ' aiid to xollect early next year not only the .entire twelvemonth's ^income- tax, but the extra portion in arrears. Between January and April; it will be'^a 'fat', quarler, and the charges ' will fall : heavily on the taxpayers. Out't of t^;iaTringeni!enfr'-'XO«ies: stn anti cipated surplus of 4B3,3a)jOOO,i by means of; -which Mr. Lowe is able to offer the country some considerable boons. ,' In the first place, the Chancellor of the Exchequer proposes to remit one penny in the income tax, which- will be reduced from sixpence to fivepence. _ Next, Mr. -Lowe proposes to abolish the remaining one shilling duty on. corn',- arrowroot, and other fari naceous articles, which yields . £900,000 to the revenue. The fixe insurance duty, which pre sents an obstacle to the,, forethought of the people, in 'providing'' against calamity,- is to be abolished. Taxes bn locomotion are to be re vised' and -reduced, i The- cab grievance will now be at an end, and ojanibus fares 'may .be sub stantially, reduced, ;; The, licence to sell tea, iyhich is ustually associated ' with tobacco, : &c.; , is properly/abandoned, 'though it ;may not prove 'to' jbe- anyJi greats advantage. The other ' -remissions oi * i- taxation, though vmsM,):, remove, objectionable ' imposts, and help - to sknpljfy our . financial system. 'Ed., estimated surpluB^of £442,000 is left ; and should' he have a' prosperous financial year, and a further large reduction of expenditure, the Chancellor ofithe: Exchequer will in 1870 be iatble-to do, some thing; even., more effectual. ? The jpreajeut 'budget is open to obvious criticisiru The .country ;has .to 'pay for the boons granted, and the question ia whether they are worth.the cbst. We cant eat T;he 'cakb and have it, and people are, on the whole;- satisfied with the bargain. Of jcourse. the, budget. will pass without sub stantial alteration, spite pf Mr. .Lowe's some what brusque and offensive way of putting down opposition. ; . ' . The organization and working of Congrega tional .Churches has of late been exciting a good deal of attention, and has beenthe subject of much criticism.;; The old methods of admission of : church members have, -to a great extent, fallen out;of use. '.** Experience' letters, and, to a less ' extent, diaconal visitations to can didates 'a'T6 'things - 'of - the past. Still the* system l . ? ? even a - thus.: modified does not iappear;.to ; work , weJLr It is complained that an increasing number of earnest and iealous CJhristians is to be . f bund outside the Church L boundary, and- that ' Church meet ings' arer so generally : inane and: badly at tended that they are of small;? yalue.-. The question consequently has. arisen whether the present system of 'membership amongst Con gregationalistB 5s either Scriptural or beneficial; whetheSr in- accordance : with the principles of equity the congregation -as well as the Church ought not- to havjB a 'voice in the disbursement . pf common funds. ( to, .-which' they .contribute; and whether the responsibility of sitting down to the .Lord's supper ought riot to he left to Hie 'individual^ conscience- rather than be. de cided by what is designated '? the. Church.' Others, riot, an influential section, are in favor jof throwing down the Church barriers alto gether, and makibg either seatholders in a place 'of worship, or those who attend ttie ? communion 'the 'depository- -of- executive power. Of course I am not going to trouble your readers with a«y ; expression of : opinion qa so delicate and important a subject. ' I refer to it as one of the chief signs of the times, and as a proof that Congregationalism, ;like every other form of Church, fellowship, is .being put in the. critical crucible, and will have to be judged, hot, by old traditions, but by its inherent soundness and adaptation to 'the wants ' of the age. A paper on the question is to be read at the Baptist Reunion meeting next week, andit has been discussed at several recent country associations. -The: Rev. Enoch Mellpr, as President of the 'V^est Riding Congregatibnal TTnion,' made' it iihe other week the subject of his inaugural address. He ? pomted . . but. two extremesj both of which were 'perilous enpugh, and perhaps equally fatal.' The one extreme he denominated the absolutely open | system of ' admission into churcheB, and the other the. rigorous system. The Board, of Congregational Ministers have, I believe* had the question under consideration at several . successive meetings; The utmost dif ference of opinion seems to have been expressed, and the Board have been unable to come' to any unanimous conclusion. In 'some few Independent Churches ' the artificial- barrier has already been . thrown down; iii many others financial matters are made a common interest to Church andCongrega tion, whilst in most the copgregation is allowp -j to,have a veto in the selection of the jpsks*jOr_ Perhaps we are only at the beginning'of a great controversy on the subject. ? r : .
