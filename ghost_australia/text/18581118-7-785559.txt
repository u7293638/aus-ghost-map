EAST TORRENS INSTITUTE.-A lecture on " Ghosts, Spectral Illusions, and Prophetic Dreams " was delivered last night by Dr. Campbell, at the Ken- sington Institute, to a respectable but not very numerous auditory. The lecture was prefaced by a performance on the pianoforte by Miss Rowe-" The Last Rose of summer," with variations -which was excellently playe Â», and loudly applauded. The lecturer introduced the va- rious theories of scientific and learned men with refer- ence to what were generally termed spectral illusions, and quoted many eminent names as supporters of h J opinion that these appearances were not mere delusions of the material sense, hut absolute spiritual mani- festations. Some amusing representations of spectral figures exhibited by the aid of the magic lantern, suc- ceeded the lecture, and the proceedings of the evening wem brought to a termination by some very agreeable music and singing, in which Miss Rowe, Mr. Gouge, and another gentleman took a part. Everybody seemed to be well pleased with the entertainment.
