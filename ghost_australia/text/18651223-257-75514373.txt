THE KINDER AND BERTH AND CASS. This case was one connected with the mysterious death of Mr. Henry Kinder, principal teller of the City bank in Sydney. A Mr. Bertraud, wbo used to practice as a dentist for a short time in DrUlanc, under the came Of tslieH, was arrested in connection with the affjir, together with lire. Bertrand aud Mrs. Cinder. The preliminary examination lasted between fire and six days, and all (he prisoners are committed for trie). Tbe following evidence of some of the witnesses give a general idea of the nature of the case. I- was, we may premise, first presumed that Kinder, the dt'e-.-.wd, died of a wound inflicted in a eUte of temporary insanity, but subsequent investiga tion led to the wrest of Henry Louis Betrand, 25, den tist, and Mrs. Kinder. SO, find Mrs. Betrand, 21, on a charge of murder. The evidence at the Police Court is very voluminous, but we extract the following : — j Ilarriet Kcrr deposed : I am a married v.-omaa, and | ?iUtcrto Bertnibi!, ihe prisoner; I arrived f.-cm Mel- j lijurne ab-iin dis v.ce!is ago, imd went to live at his house in Wyn.-.ard-sijuare ; shortly after I arrived he .-pike uf Mrs. K-in.i'r, r.ad «-id be withed to make Lc-r I Im wife -tint he ivulnil to div»rce fium '.As prssciil ] wife ; lie e-.iid lie- w vi-.-y mucli in love with thi* psr «n : I said I «vas very mu:b suiyrised, as in hia let !--s iti me he =ii-i he -..?,-; linn; h?.™ily w-th V.ia (rife; I arg-wl wil'.i b:m. a-.i'l ?.i:. 1 thii uit-:-r being niuniei for ! tliit-e yca-h he sh ?--.-!! t!.!ak of hi-.ter thing? ; I hs.1 j ?livor-e ; oi.-oat p. v:--': :-::-:r.v-.i-.U, or five or sis (lavs, !
