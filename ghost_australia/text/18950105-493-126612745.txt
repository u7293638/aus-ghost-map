A Ghost Story. | A weird story is reported from a quiet little village on the slopes of tlie Mendips. Among the inhabitants rumours had been circulated (says the Daily. Telegraph) that a ghostly apparition was to be seen after nightfall in the footway leading to the rural graveyard, and so gruesome were the tales told concern ing the spectre that the path in question i became deserted. At length the village ! patriarch started the theory that his grand- I father had informed him, when a boy, that it ! had taken ' thirteen persons and a woman' j to ' lay the spirit' of an old squire for 150 ; years in the Red Sea, that the time was ex- ; pired, and that he had returned again, j Matters had reached this crisis when ' a local roysterer, after his daily pere- | grination, and having dined not wisely ] but too well, so far forgot himself as to \ endeavonr to reach his home by the dreaded path. The following is the account he gave ( of his experience that night : â€” ' I were a coom just to the churchyard, when from under the gert chestnut tree thui- coomed the most horrible site I ever seed. 'Twur a tall figgur, and his face and hands were a shining just like a box of damp matches, and patches on him seemed to be all o' a-flame. It frightened I mainlce ; me hair was as stiff as brissols, and I should have bolted, only my^ legs wouldn't run. I war sober enuif now, and he coomed towards I, and not a sound did liur make, and when hur weer coomed quite close, he spoke in a terrible tone the words, ' Show me to my grave !' At that I found me feetj and. hands too, and I went for'n,. and I found he was a main solid speerit ; and didn't he holler for mercy, to be sure !' The victor of ' this midnight encounter is now the hero of -, the district around, and- he carries in. his pocket a rubber tennis-shoe as a trophy of his victory. The ghost has been confined io his I house with a severe attack of influenza..
