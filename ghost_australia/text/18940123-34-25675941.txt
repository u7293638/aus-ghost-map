LONDON TABLE TALK. [From our Special Correspondent.] LONDON, December 15, 1893. It is an agreeable reflection that any mad- <*> man or fanatic sufficiently anxious for revenge or notoriety to be regardless of consequences can by purchasing a saucepan, a pound of nails, and four "penn'orth" of chemicals, any day and anywhere, treat us to just snob a murderous outrage as the one somewhat unsuc cessfully carried out in Paris last Saturday. The police, indeed, are of opinion that before many weeks hare passed a holocaust of the i same Bort will be attempted in London. They put down both this explosion and the one at Barcelona to the written and spoken incite ments to murder of leading Anarchists, and they urge that there will be no safety for the j civilised world while sach mischierone licence j continues. In this cry even the Radical j press now joins. The Daily News says:— "The nice distinction between deeds and words, or at any rate between some deeds I and come words, is breaking down under the j weight of these abominable crimes. If it is wrong to murder innocent crowds wholesale, it cannot be right to extol the deed in Dbe name of 'social regeneration.' The propa ganda of these horrors must be checked.* The Istra of every civilised State would maSe short work of a journal devoted to the professional interests of the burglar and the footpad. A society of philosophic Thugs would hardly be tolerated in our midst. It seems absurd to tolerate the filthy sheets that are the organs of infinitely more dangerous criminals than either. Anarchy as a political creed, at any rote as a political organisation, has no« reached the anti-eocial ■tage, and mere adherence to is should entail the penalties provided, or to be provided, by law. Other forms of murderous conspiracy are not allowed to take the name of Theory in vain. If we continue the privilege to this one, it will be impossible to deny it to the rest. There will come a time when the advocacy of child murder will be simply a view on the question of population, and when every wretch who is cangbt plotting arson will claim that he is only trying an experiment in foel for the roasting of pigs. Anarchism is no longer an opinion; it is simply an incitement to crime." One of the worst effects of these abominable crimes is the discredit they bring-on innocent people. Neither Socialists nor Radicals have the faintest sympathy with the Anarchists. Yet as a ted-hot Tory had the im pudence to say to me on Sunday, " both will set blamed. I reckon. 51 went on this abandoned pereon, " that the Paris blow up will win us both Brighton and Accrington. A strong point of our free and independent electors is that few of them are good at distinc tions. An Anarchist and a Socialist mean mnch the came thing to them. Both are noisy persons who ' gas' in the park on Suud&ysabottt; * busting 1 up everything, and require to be kept in order." The bomb-thrower, Vafllant, proves to be a man of the worst character, who was known to be an Anarchist of she most dangerous class, and was supposed to be tmderoloae polios surveillance. That such a wretch should under any pretence have been able to get tnto the Legislative Chamber evidences that the French method of dealing with known criminals is by no means bo perfect as the world supposed. It would, one may venture to assert, be impossible for a rogue of VaU lautfa calibre to effect an entry to the strangers' gallery at Westminster. Vaillant belongs to the wolf genus of convict. A man named Marcband whose wife, marriage cer tificate, name, and furniture, the bomb thrower calmly annexed some time ago, says i Vaillant is the blackest scoundrel and the! bravest fellow he ever knew. He was' often j reduced to famine, and yet he was keen on money making. ~ Marchand, directly he heard of the explosion, divined the author and. said, and still says, that' it most have been done for money. If there! had been no money hanging to it Vaillant would not have ran die risk, but for money he would da anything. Where be Wandered was in not having studied the interior of the Palais- j Bourbon. He also blundered when wounded] in not crying out for help. Instead he first I tried to get out, and then hid himself. Shortly] after the explosion, as Dr. Bourgade was crossd ing one of the lobbies, he saw a man leaning against a door with blood streaming; bom hiai face. When, however, die doctor bade him go | into the hall to have his wounds dressed be said, "Thanks, but it is a mere scratch. Tta off home now to get it seen to." "You won't be able to leave hefe for at feast two hours," said the doctor, "all the doors tea closed, and none can pus out till the police have examined them." "In that case,** said the man calmly, " I will avail myself of your kindness." This was Vaillant THe polios reoo?nised Vaulant as their man the instant they "placed" him, and he, seeing tbe game was up, out short the inquisitor con temptuously—"Yes, I am an Anarchist and proud of it. Ton are quite right, I did the deed. I -wanted to make a fricasstt of those sacre* deputies." "Whsft have Hie deputies done to youT "To me personally nothing, bat tney are the sort of ama&e; whom one should get rid of." On Monday morning the Minister of Justice visited Vaillant (can you imagine our Home Secretary or Attorney-General calling tin a freshly-caged dynamiter 1) at the Hotel Diem and asked—" Why did yon commit this crime?" "It is useless to toy and explain to you," re plied the criminal shortly; "yon are a —■ — bourgeois and couldn't understand." The Minister thereupon ignominionsly retreated. A few leading pressmen were also privileged to enjoy a stare at the notoriety of the hour. Mrs. Crawford, of tiie Daily Ifcws, saw him under guard at the prison of la Santa. "At die hospital he was sitting up in a room at the end of the St. Landry ward. One of his hands was in a sling. His nose being much swollen and bound with stioking plaster it was bard to jadge of his physiognomy. butJie was astonish ingly well dressed for a man who earned only very slender and precarious wages, and in spite of his disfigurement impressed me as intelli gent. He has very strange eyes. They havea variety of expressions, which show dis crepancies and oontrasts in the character. Their firet look is hard, sharp, sus picions, and reading. When he has taken stock of the person he has seen for the first time they assume & wholly d ifierent look. He has at times the gaze of a visionary, and again looks as cunning as a weak and wild animal in the habit of being pursued or hungering for prey. He has a strong neck and a fine oheet and broad shoulders. Two policemen walked up and down the room where he was under treatment. He had been visited by a Juge d'ln?tmction, who gave orders that nobody was to be allowed to speak to him except strictly on hospital business. His wife has not yet asked to see him. She is believed not to have known of bis plan for drawing attention to himself by bomb-throwing." The same correspondent says?—"AH the time that Vaillant was under surveillance for his last penal offence he was organising revo lutionary meetings and lectures, and bad set up an Anarchist society at Choisy la-Boi under the name of the Society of Philosophical Studies. The mayor was asked by him to lend the ootrocQ-room at the mayoralty, but refused, because there was a rule to allow none but reeularly authorised societies to use it. He, however, lent him an outbuilding. The lectures were for rustics of tne suburbs of Paris. Doubtless Vaillant wanted to become an electoral aeent, and in this way to rue in the world. He was very clever in gaining inftaeooe, and is the summer season making money as a pedlar in connec tion with his lectures. He organised a band of plausible talkers to give village leotnres on all kinds of subjects about which rustics might like to be wsll informed. One I of the band, as a herald, preceded the others on a cycle which he had stolen. When I things were made ready for them VaiUant and his lecturers arrived. If he was to talk of fer mentation, he had a microscope with vaccines i or anti-microbe powders to eeU. He cleared I ope day with his band £20 in a turn ronnd Tillages south of Paris. The lectures were on the microbes of the mouth and nostrils, which were shown on the field of the microscope, and oh anti-septic mouth-washes and snuffs. ! Peasants, terrified at the organisms revealed to them, bought freely the wares offered. Vail laut's movements do not seem to have been in any way hampered by the surveillance exer cised over him, and he breathed threatenings and slaughter against society at Anarchist meetings. Vet here is his police record : — * Auguate Virillant, son of Auguste Vaillant and Josephine Bouyer, die-einkor, "sentenced for the first time for shop-lifting to six days, atCbarlenlle, 27th May, 1878, at the age of sixteen ; sentenced to three days for begging at Marseilles on the 14th De cember, 187S; sentenced at Algiers on the 24th April, 1879, to three months for steal ing ; sentenced at Marseilles to one month for theft on the 19th September, 1878. A factory workman and noted thief. He has sinoe been ■11 over South America.' Vaillant was not a man to take anyone into his confidence. He was always starting schemes. A fortnight ago he seems to have had a scheme for collecting Socialists and Revolutionists under his banner, perhaps to sell them or their votes. To this end be gave up his situation in a fancy leather factory, and advertised in the JtevdUe that he wanted to found a popular library, to further which aim he appealed to < Sooialiat authors and scientific men. He only asked them to eead copies of their writings. A police agent was sent to find out what his real motive was, and went to Vailiantfe home to see him there. He was instructed to go as an Anarchist workman. They convened some time on the subject, VaiUant saying that he wanted to be able to manipulate at will every Anarchist of the district of Petitpoufc" It is pointed out by a Paris correspondent that it was a singularly easy business for VaiUant to obtain aooeaa to the gallery of the T%. French Chamber, from which he dropped In* home-made bomb. Not only is no pass z6> quired, but practically no asrveillaiioe h exercised over those frequenting the .galleries. So hut indeed have the authorities been3n the matter that it is said to have been the habit for come time past for homeless .persons to quit their usual quarters in the Born de Boulogne in dirty weather and Bleep in ibis gallery during die sittings of the Chamber. A man carrying a parcel would not txwrtw the object of any suspicion, as visitors were in the habit of taking food into the gallery and holding a sort of picnic amongst themselves. Such a state of things is a. marvellous contrast to the rules and regulations in force at our own Honsn nnd indeed at any other legislative building. Apropos of tie Anarchist scars in Spain and in connection with that most gumsome exploit of the "mad dogs of society,'' the bomb-throwing at the liyceo Theatre, Barce lona, a good eoory is going round. A formerly well-known cricketer, whom we may dub Mr. A. EL Smith, was travelling in sunny Spain with his wife, and was at Barcelona snout ate time of the recent explosion. His relatives, wbo had received no news of the wanderers for some time, became very anxious about Mr. Smith and his wife when the telegraphic account of the Lyceo outraee was pub lished, and induced the Foreign Office ■ to wire to the authorities at Barce lona to make enquiries. The initial telegram was sent somewhat in this form—"Arthur Smith, British subject, in Barcelona during late outrages. Kindly make enquiries ana wire result." A few hours later the teptr came-^-" Thomas Smith is in Barcelona. He is being closely watched." And againafintte later came a farther telegraphic report bom Barcelona, the which puzzled the F.O. people not a little—"The man Smith attempted *o leave Barcelona last night; is now in custody." Later on the F.O waa in no^l of a' telegram from **«• Smith hitnSelf—^ "Owing to your confounded telegram have ■: spent 24 hours in Spanish gaeL What xjtt earth do you mean V And the F.O. answered never a word to the angry man.

In "John Ingerfietd" Mr. Jerome K. Jerome deserts the new humor and sells at simple story of old London in George TO,'* time with a good deal of refinement and nice feeling. It is a very Blight tale, mereiy relatiog how a man and woman who have married for convenience sake are by virtue o£ working together for the side poor brought to love and understand one another. "Ths> Woman of the Saeter" v alw a eenous effort— ' a Notee ghost story and decidedly creepy. Oai the other hand "Variety Fatten" belongs to. Mr. Jerome's more familiar manner.

Moreover Mr. McCarthy tails to handle the Boiagobey eohool of mystery adroitly. Tbe story makes easy reading lika all' his books, but it doesn't stir one's pulaai or even absorb one particularly. "The Die. tator" was a far more successful effort.

The Bev> Henry CnbbwbU, whose three "volumes of fiction' make their appearance aa regularly each December as Christmas itself, lias just put in an appearance. His annual tiovel this time is called "Broken Fortune?," and like its dozen predecessors it is quite readable. Nevertheless I don't suppose the book will ever reach a second edition or a cheap reissue. None of Mr. Cressn-ell's other -works have: and yet some of them, notably "Incognito" and "AModem Greek Heroine," were far above the average. Mr. Cresswell is a oosandram. In making the writing of three vol novels, which never get beyond the library pablio, pay, be has achieved the apparently impossible. "Dodo," in her 6s. drees, is selling like "remnants" at Whiteley's on a "big bar puss" day, and Mr. K.emahan's gruesome " Book of Strange Bins" also seems in great demand. I regret to cay I fear many people buy the latter in the hope of discovering im proper stories therein. In this happily they are disappointed. Mr. Eernahan trenches occasionally on the cerulean, but like most of his morbid tribe he bates calling a epade a spade. In Buchanan's "The Charlatan, 7' now in . preparation at the Haymarket Theatre, Mr. Tree will play a hypnotist. It is the nee to which he puts his mesmeric power which forms the leading motive of the piece. , • Mr. Henry Elmore Frith, eon of the B. A., came very badly oot of. a breach of promise ' ease brought against him last week by Miss Florence O'Keef a. Mr. Frith is an actor now ' appropriately enough playing villain in a piece called "Lured to Ruin." In 18S5 he and Miss OJ^eefe were travelling in the same company. They fell in love, and Frith proposed marriage. After this the pair actually passed as man and wife, Mr. Frith being good enough to draw and spend both their salaries. This went on till 1892 when Mr. Frithdeeerted Missp'Eeefe and refused to provide for'her. The jury gave the lady £180. On dtt that despite his great age Verdi is at work on a new opera, the subject being the favorite cob of '"Borneo and Juliet." The choice his librettist considers most un fortunate, h being very unlikely the aged maestro can equal (much Ibsb surpass} Gounod's popular work on the Bame subject.
