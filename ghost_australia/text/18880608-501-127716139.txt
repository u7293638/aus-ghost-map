Hoes the Hone Require Winkers t The horse comes into the world with his five senses in full vigour. His ears are so arranged that they can be turned to catch a sound in any direction. His nose is large and he can scent a friend or enemy a great way off. His mouth is so made that he can tell what be is eating better than you or I can. His feelings are as delicate us the touch of a blind man, and his eyes are bo placed in his head that he may have a large field of vision. And yet his master, man, who does not like to be deprived of any of his senses, shows a laok of even horse sense when he nuts winkers on him and drives him. Why should not a horso see anything approaching in the rear as well as from the front f Why not put wink ers on him when you ride him or turn him out to graze? Why not hinder the proper exercise of his hearing, smell, or taste 1 The horse is the only animal save the mule that is so treated. Per haps his (the mule's) heels might be leathered with more propriety, Winkers cover the most handsome features of the horse. What is prettier than the full hazel eye of a horse 1 Can a horse reason f We say yes. Then oannot he oome to a better conclu sion when' his eyes are not obstructed 1 The horse should see the whip in the driver's band and know when all the members of the family are seated. . If he can't see the whip he soon learns to hear the driver pull it from the whip socket. More horses run away because they cannot see, but hear the ghost, than if they could see and hear it too, as seeing often dispels all fear.
