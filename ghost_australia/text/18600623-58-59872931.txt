To state that the horses fell ioto their ranks with the order and regularity of a troop of cavalry, would le merely to use a trite but appropriate simile withal. There was little wheeling and turning about, and the warning "published in the last Calendar had evidently produced a ' most salutary effect on the juvenile jockeys. At any rate, so anxious were they to obey the orders of the starter, that there was no necessity f.r remonstrance, much less for tbe reading of the riot act." At the first attempt they get away,, forming a line so compact that the people on the stands and carriages contd not distinguish the leaders, and, indeed, the jockeys in the race, as they deployed across the' fl it, wire puzzled in this respect, so rapidly were positions continually shifted. Tho silken jackets tattled in the wind, and sounded itt a distat.ee like the rolling of shingles on the beach. As nearly aa we could ascertain, Gibraltar, Athos, Man at-Arms. Wallace, May Morning, Confectioner, Jason, Mudllc. de Chantilly, formed the van, and before reaching the Bushes hill tho lot spilt Into three divisions, the la«t of all being Gamester; Newcastle, Simple Simon, and Muts'ni, who wore several lengths' ia ibo rear. As they approached the Now Stand, Confec- tioner, palling hard, was in freiit, arid on making tho lura of tho lands, he held a load of about half a-doien lengths, Man-at-Arms going on sjcor.d, Kemunoraior third,onlho the lower ground, with Gibraltar and Clydesdale on tba upper ground, Mndlle do Chantilly and May Morning next. On reaching tho »ito of the Duke's stand the Brooch mare was beaten, and only Vinn at-Arms and Hemunerator wore left with the ghost of a chaoce of catching the fa- vourite, whom little Grimshaw f..und it difficult to hold. The horse swerved from the middle of the coarse on io tho lower ground, and seemed bout upon bolting over the ropes; Grimshaw, however, managed to kc<p his bead in the right direction, and tho horse won with tho utmost oaso by four lengths. Two lengths between tho second and third. Clydesdale and Gibraltar finished, side by aide, next, and close under the judge's chair.
