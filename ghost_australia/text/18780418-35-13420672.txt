THE CLOSING OF PUBLIC-HOUSES ON SUNDAYS. TO THE EDITOR. OF THE HERALD. sin, Having for three days acted in the capacity of canvasser for signatures to the petition against the opening of the Public Library and Museum, and conferred with some of my brother collectors, I think we have made a discovery that is not generally known to the authorities We were all particularly struck with the almost unanimous cry for a petition to close the public-houses on the Sunday, and that proceeding from the lowest classes of the working-men When entering a large factory and confronting ten, fifteen, or twenty workmen, you could almost tell at a glance how many signatures would be recorded by the general appearance of the men , the best " put on " generally approved of the closing of the Library and Museum on Sunday, and the " seed) looking" clamoured for their rights to see the same opened Those who signed the petition said little about an) other petition, but the astonishment of us all was, at those who had all the appearance of being good friends of the publicans, imploring us to get up a petition to close the public-houses on the Olinda) s, and they would sign it twenty times if we wished I do not know what effect this anomaly bad on my brother collectors, but it appeared to me that these poor men were acting on motives of expediency they seem to be aware of the evil of Sunday) drinking, but also aware of their own weakness to resist temptation, and would be glad to see the " little side door '' locked against them, so that their thoughts might, in spite of them, be turned in a different direction J.

The poor dog regarded the moving bone TV lth an amaze- ment which found expression in erect ears and a tail gradually thrust between his hind legs, and be coming convinced, as Mr Romanes supposes that it was but the ghost of a bone, incontinently fled howl ing dismally. On the whole, the JSeic lost Times considers that the dog behaved much more sensibly than many men would havedoneundernsimilarbehef 1 In all probability, the journal says, " had Mr Romanes ever seen a piece of roast beef in the act of cruising unassisted around the table, he would in stantly have asked it preposterous questions, and would subsequently have let his hair grow long and have become a confirmed Spiritualist His intelligent dog did none of these mines, but as soon as he deemed that he had seen a spiritual bone, he refused to have anything more to do with it and continued to wear his hair of the usual length, and to cling, to that faith in which he was educated Mr Romanes was not yet satisfied however He took a pipe, got some soap and water, and began to blow bubbles along the floor It took some time to connective terrier that the" airy nothings were not a new kind of particularly dangerous rat, but presently he put his pan on one, and it of course collapsed He tried a second and it likewise vanished, and then, recollections of the ghostly bone overwhelming him again he cried Still Mr Romanes M IS not satis bed He proceeded to " make faces at his x victim, and the grimaces he made were so hideously ugly that we are told the dog mis- took him for the worst ghost he had ever seen, at here upon he erect under the sofa and tried to die Love ears of dogs will sympathise with the poor little terrier and if Mr Romanes continues his mv delegations will hardly regret to hear that he has had to deal with a larger dog which pursues a more spirited policy, with regard to ghosts -The Evening Standard FOREIGN AND COLONIAL TRADE - At the Royal Colonial Institute, the Duke of Manchester in the chair, the hon secretary, Mr Frederick Young, in the author's unavoidable absence through sudden in- disposition, read a paper by Dr. Forbes Watson, Director of the Indian Museum on "The Character of the Colonial and Indian Trade of England con- trasted with her Foreign Trade Our colonial trade was, he said, distinguished from our foreign trade by certain. characteristics which considerably enhanced the importance it already possessed Dr "Watson grouped the colonies as 1, trading and military stations, 2, plantation colonies, 3, agricultural, pastoral, and mining Taking first these last, such as Australia, Canada, and the Cope, he found that while English trade with the United States, our best foreign customer, would be £2 66 per head, that with Canada was three fold greater, with Australia seven fold greater, and that with a colonist at the Cape fifteen fold greater In the plantation colonies, such as the West Indies Ceylon, and Mauritius, the trade per white inhabitant amounted to £310, of which she was English In the case of the trading stations, such as Hongkong, Singapore, and Manila, the few European residents were but the intermediaries of a vast trade with the adjacent foreign countries so that the amount of total trade for each white inhabitant was £10,000, of which £2000 was English The returns for 1876 placed India ahead of every other country in the absorption of British produce and merchandise, whereas in 1869 it ranked third only, standing behind the United States and Germany He stated that between 1869 and 1876 the exports of British home produce to the British possessions had increased £17,000,000, while the exports to foreign countries sank £6,000,000 Foremost among the leading export trades of England, constituting about one third of the whole, was the cotton trade, and in 1876 the British possessions absorbed 40 per cent more cotton manufactures than in 1869 In 1872 the colonial demand for our cotton wares rose to two-fifths of our whale export, while against its increase during the -Kt years of £0,300,000 we had to set a falling off in the foreign demand amounting to £4,500,000 Similar observations applied to most of the other trades, the foreign demand being either stationary or declining, while the exports to the British possessions were rapidly rising -EA-Ft-L DYNAMITE ACCIDENT -A fearful catastrophe has occurred at Parma in a tiller officer and SIN men were trying to uproot an old horse chestnut tree with dy manner in the public promenade, when, owing to the officer's carelessness an explosion ensued, killing six. persons, and wounding 63 Among the killed are the officer, two soldiers, and two children Among the seriously wounded are four noblemen and several gentlemen who were out for their afternoon walk and attracted to the spot from curiosity to see the experiment Some of them are not expected to juries,
