SALVATION ARMF WEEK OF SELFDENIAL total for AUSTRALASIA, £25,350. THE WORLD'S 'RECORD BEATEN. NEW ZEALAND HEADS THE POLL. ' It won't do. I can raise a better song any day of the week in Melbourne ; and I've yet to learn that Sydney is willing to take a back seat to Melbourne. (Cheers.) Now, then, you up in the top shelf thero— (laughter) — among the gods, why don't you sing. If you don't, I won't tell you what's inside these papers.' (Cries of 'Oh.') It was Com mandant Booth who spoke. His auditors were Salvationists, drawn from the city and all the suburbs around (writes tho Sydney Daily Telegraph of October 27. ) They crowded me i/entcnary iiaii jrora cue noor lite rally to the ceiling. There was scarcely standing room in either of the galleries. Everybody was more or less excited, and the enthusiasm which was engendered knew no bounds. Themeetiug had been called to hear tho official results of the self-denial effort declared. The totals had been kept a profound secret. Even the officers were not taken into confi dence, and expectancy was written on every face. The officers of the leading corps and divisions, as well as of the colonies, had invoked a keen spirit of rivalry by challenging each other to head the poll. Punctually at 8 o'clock a whistle sounded. Everybody seemed to know the signal and rose to his or her feet. It announced the advent of tho Commandant and Mrs. Booth, who were greeted with deafening cheers, musical honors, and the waving of handker chiefs. They were preceded on to the platform by seven officers dressed in white duck suits, with ascarlet sash, showing in large white letters across their breasts the names of the seven colo nies of Australasia, i'heir appearance caused a mild sensation. Colonel Peart(Victoria), Colonel Estill, and Mrs. Estill also occupied prominent seats. Colonel Peart opened the proceedings by announcing a hymn entitled 'March on,' which ho declared to be 'tho grandest song in tho book.' Major Braham followed with prayer, until he was interrupted by the com mandant, who, with his concertina, commenced a pretty refrain, 'I heard of a Saviour whose love was so great.' Then Colonel Estill prayed. He thanked God for 'the totals which the Commandant was going to announce,' and for the partial restoration to health of Mrs. Booth. ' Now, what's the matter with you Sydney people,' shouted the Commandant, as he took charge of the meeting. 'You seoin to be on pins and needles.' (Laughter.) Then he went on to say that he reckoned tho Sydney soldiers were honored in being the first to hoar the territorial totals announced. These things were usually~3one at the headquarters in Melbourne. For that night the head quarters were in Sydney, as ho had the conceit to believe that the headquarters of the Salvation Army in Australasia were : under his hat. (Laughter and cheers. ) As j the constituted director of the Army in Aus- i tralasia and the representative of their beloved General — (cheers)— he was thero to give the j record of the latest battle fought for God and , humanity under tlie Southern Cross. He did so with mingled feelings of wonder and praise. He was not a novice in the Army. Born in its ranks he had been privileged to be a participator in some of its brightest achieve ments. (Cheers.) He rose to speak, there fore, not as the scribes did merely, but as one with some degree of authority. Some people did not know the 6ecrot of tho power of the Salvation Army. Next to God and the Holy Ghost, it lay' in tho fact that the Army had gone,back to the creed of the Founder of Christianity, The cross was their : attraction. ('Hallelujah,' 'Glory,' and cries of 'Fire a volley.') Self-denial week represented not merely the principle of grasp and cadge, as some of their enemies said. It j represented the principle of self-denial. The . movement had been started in England some 10 or 11 years ago, when the Army had little but its wits and devotion to depend upon. It bectan m a small way, and the result the first j'oar was about Jt2, 000. Last year the total throughout the worid was not far short of £GO,000 — ; (applause) — of which Australia had con- | tributod 17,000 sovereigns. Woe to them if ' they had not done as weil this year. (Laughter and cheers.) Tho amount of toil put into the effort this year had been enough to make the angels shout for joy. Some of the wonwu had been at it when asleep— (laughter)— and very much at it when awake. (Clicers.) It ! was the hardest cross in the world to be a beggar — to go round from door to door like the rag and bones man— (laughter)— [ and to push and push ; for God know it took j an awful lot of push to squeeze a threepenny bit out of some people. (Laughter.) Ono girl, under exceptional circumstances, had collected £4 15s. 'God bless the girl.' If it hadn't boon wicked ho would have likod to kiss her when she told him — (laughter)— but Brace he had been married his wife claimed all the kisses he could coin. (Great laughter and Mrs. Booth, ' Don't enlarge on tho subject.') Ho knew the character of the Army soldiers in England, Canada, Africa, and ou the Continent of Europe; but for devotion forgoing at it without being pressed, for guing at it with a shout, and sticking to it with glorious enthusiasm, he had never met tho like of the Salvationists in Australasia— (deafening cheers)— and, added the Comman dant, with a significant nod, 'I've told the Genera! no in this week's dispatches.' In fact, he had told him to make haste and get through his work on the other side, and come out to Australia and see tho real Salvationist. (Great cheering.)
