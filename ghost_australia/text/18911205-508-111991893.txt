Bojtiert Louis Stevenson. \- Mt:. Robert Louis Stevenson — ^the author of **.Hyde and Jekyll ' — ^^says he will live -and die in his Samoan paradise. It is a heritable dreamland where the novelist live&V; His home is two miles from Apia, on- the island of Upolu ; and the site of the house ;was, when he bought -it, a virgin forest, through'' which the foot had never trod. ?:? The house faces on the sea ; about it are VtheV great leaves of the cocoanut, palm, and bread fruit trees ; witMn it is all that civilisation can furnish to minister to .'creature comfort. One who visited Stevenson there two months ago says: ?« He- iscstill very thin and fragile j Ms shoulders are bent, and Ms chest seems hollow. ? But- his voice is *? strong and hearty, and Ms grasp .firm. His com plexion has lost its deathly whiteness, and is now a healthy bronze. He still wears his hair long, and Ms delicate effeminate mouth is shaded by a drooping moustache. Hi* eyes, too. seem to be half closed and dreatny^ andri^i^db^with arslow, languid drawL' , He believes he has found a safe haven -from consumption at the island of TJpolu,:a.ndi hopes to live to a ripe old age. He hfes. no thought or care' for affairs on the other side of the globe. If there should be 'a massacre of Europeans at Samoa because of the heavy taxes imposed on the natives, he has no fear of personal ?injury;, for he believes that the natives re spect and trust him. He may use his spare time: in writing another book. In, fact he has already a deal of manuscript ready for the printer. But he has no desire ever to change his locus, and with his wife and mother -he will dream a way existence amid the ghosts with which his fancy has peopled his house and its surroundings.
