Thus it was I had been so far spared the necessity of addressing him. ' ; ????*.. ? In the middle of an oracular condem nation, of Parnell from the rector, Minna appeared. I stood up and held out my hand just for the pleasure of touching hers, and upon my movement the gem among landed ' proprietors flung himself un couthly out , of his arm chair, and with a savage glare, at me took the hand mine had lightly touched into his own massive palm with a disgusting air of proprietor ship. Without apparently notioing his gesture, I approached and offered my arm to Mrs. Halliday. But for Garnet's insufferable presence, the dinner would have been an exceed ingly pleasant one. The rector was a bit of a bore, especially upon the subject of politics, but Mrs. Halliday's fluent small, talk was agreeable enough in its way ; then the wine was excellent, and either the rector's wife or her cook a genuine artist. ? Opposite to me sat Minna with her clown lover beside her, the only ad dition to her morning attire being several rows of tiny pearls round her throat, with crimson flowers in her hair and collar. Whenever my attention was engaged with Mrs. Halliday or the rector, I noticed that Garnet took advantage of the oppor tunity to whisper something into the ear of his betrothed. Each of these con fiden tial whispers was followed by a soft ex plosion of laughter from Minna, unlike laughter in genera], very pretty and en gaging to hear and behold. I never could catch Garnet's observations, but was struck wiih the singular anomaly of a man of his build and temper being able to whisper at all. One of his remarks I know referred satirically to me, because Minna was just beginning to laugh in her thoroughly appreciative and hearty way, when suddenly she looked quickly at me, coloured, and her face grew grave. ' I could plainly see that her answer was a rebuke'.',' ' ' ? ' ? '.? ?'?'.?' !'

One could detoot from the responsive movements of her feet that she longed to whirl round the room under the influence of 'Tausend und eine Naoht.' ' Can you waltz, Laurence ?' she asked eagerly. ? The amiable and witty Laurence by way of reply gave vent to a graceful grunt and flung himself into a ohair beside her. He stretched his hand up to take posses sion of hers, but she moved away with a gesture of very frank repugnance, and she looked over at me. I was seated near the piano, talking to Mrs. Halliday, who intercepted Minna'a glance of quaintly veiled appeal— 'I. know you are dying ? to dance, Minna,' cried Mrs. Halliday, coming to -her help generously, 'arid.T am aure.Mfc Sheridan ..will- have no objebtioh to carry outyour unorthodox fancy.'
