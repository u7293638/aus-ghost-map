Her form, a little above middle height, was trig and sturdy ; and her rotund, fair face rather pleasing, with its fresh colour, bright, dark eyes, and chestnut hair. She was ready dressed for a journey, and, at sight -of Mrs. Alfinghftm, uttered an ei-ilainatiou \- of dismay. Mrs. Allingham raised one -white hand in quick protest. 1 Mot a word, Brigitta ! she cried, half authori tatively, half amusedly. 'I have Aot forgotten that we leave for Heidelberg this afternoon; so don't waste time in dreadful predictions, but hand me my bonnet, and tell me everything'! 'there is to tell. What of Miss Beauchamp F Ie ] she ready f ' . ? ' To her gloves and the shawl on her arm, .mistress/ answered the woman j hurrying about, and gathering up the various articles scattered on tables and chairs; 'and, mistress, we shall loeetlietra — ' Mrs. Allingham composedly interrupted her, knotting the strings of 'her handsome travelling bonnet with swift but tasteful hand. * Never mind the train, Brigitta,' she said. 'But tell me what yonr sharp eyeB and oars have discovered. Do £hey still call mo 'the lady from Leipsic?'' You are sure there are no doubts ?' * As Bure as I live, mistress ! I Lave told- you so every day since we got here. And, then, why should there be doubts ? Isn't your name andLeipsic on the book together ?' ' Pate, Brigitta., fate ! One never knows how it finger is g»ing to turn !' ' 'Well, I know that fate is for you this time., mistress. No one will ever follow us to the Black sorest from Baden. When they hunt, ior Mrs. Allingham they'll go to lieipsie !' Mrs. Allingham smiled, took her gloVes, and put another question. ? 'Miss Beauchanip and Mrs. Jeffries t' ane asked. * Where are they ? Down in Miss Beauchamp's room ?* * Yes, mistress j and Miss Bcauchauip is send ing a long message to Lucy by Amelia; while Mrs. Jeffries stands with her back to themi off by the window, ready to cry.' The satisfied smile on Mrs. Allingham's lips gave place to a momentary expression scorn. The next instant she asked sharply, fixing her wonderful eyes keenly on Brigitta's face. * What Mrid.of m^ssagefe, Brigitta ?' The woman laughed. * Nothing to trouble you, mistress, dear. She ia going to travel with you and visit you, and re main abroad a. long time, studying Gecnian and painting, and so on, and so oiu And more than that, mistress, slio eent w«rd that her new maid — Brigitta — does weH- and is gentl6, tastof ul and obedient.' ' A very good message- Brigitta. We could not have manufactured a better ourselves;. And be sure you keep a close watch over her mail. Remember all letters must pass through my hands.* Brigitta showed her glittering white teeth in response, crying quic.fcly- significantly s ' Never fear me, inirirass. I don't go through life with my eyes shut- It wouldn't do for us castle servants to do tha t, would it mistress ?' ' Hardly.* % With what equally mea ning answer Mrs Ailing* ham glanced at heir wai ch, took her shawl and eachel from Brigitta, a ad then- honied the woman back to Nina. She was following a minute later, when she escounted Doctor Jeffries ascending the stairs. 'We are a little late, X am afraid?* he ex plained, ? and Mrs. Jcffrie&i; desired me to come and meet you/ Then, gi^sing her no time to reply, he added, in quick, cautiously lowered tones : * Mrs. Allingham, I'm the most miserable' man on earth. I feel like ai monster of wicked' ness. I wish to Heaven there nad been someone else upon whom Sir feobert could have laid this terrible burden. It half breads my heart to look at that poor deceived girL SA xatBer put my hand into the fire than do what I am doing'.' 'Doctor!' cried Mrs. Allingiham, in shocked tones of expostulation. ' Oh, I know I'm doing right I' cried tiie dector dragging out his handkerchief, and wiping hia thi ckly-bedewed brow. ' It ie nofc that. It is the misery of being the one to lead her into — ' The words failed on his lips. There was a moment's silence. The 'next Mrs. Allingham's ciianning voice asked sadly, sympa thetically : . . 'Have you tested her to-day, Doctor' P Per haps — ?' The doctor waved his' fat little hand despair ingly. 'No hope ! No liopo I'fcfl sighed. 'She's as fixed in that dreadful point as the£ub in the heavens. Nothing will conviace ^lier thit Lady Beauchamp has not been attempting Bet life, and., that, too, in the face of the face that .she does not improve in health at Baden. The«-I«ord. help us all ! What a trial it is/ Again there was a brief silence. Agp&l; Mrs. AUis^ham's charming' voice brake ffe ' Well, Doctor V she muTmured, sadlyv inters rogatively.. , .
