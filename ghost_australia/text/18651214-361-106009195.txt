, MISCELLANEOUS. TIE FENTA~s.--TI'is organisation begins to show itself stronger and bolder every day. On tlhe one hand it is rerorted that Liverpool is a centre of operation, and that here is is sup ported by men of education and influence, while in Ireland reports oFFenian doings are continually turning up. A Waterford corres pondent of the Clolnmel Chronicle says :-"At every corner there is to be found thle regular street-ballad singer braying forth .The Bold Fonian lpy.' At every cornier one is met with some.sensational story of 200, 500, 1000 or 2000, according to thie esaggerative powers of the narrator-Fenians twho were drilling the previous night at KIilbarry Bog, or some other waste." The Cork correspondent of Saunderoe ', 3ros Letter says: - ' Since the terminition of the Americean war every steam lhipswhich arrives off Cork IHarbour, 'on her homeward voyage from New York or Boston, lands on these shores large nusobers of young men who had served in the Republican army, who carry revolver pistols, rifled guns'daggers, and short swords, whlichl they- openly exposo in their pelambulations through the city of Cork. They spoke without any reserve an nouicing that ships are preparing to bring over 50,000 well disciplined Fenians fully armed, whoo would be met hlera by 100,000 well-drilled men, who would drive the Blritishi army into the sea. This brought a smile onsthe faces of the listiners, until one of tihe fellows to the horror of the ladies, produced from ai belt rosud his -waist a five barrelled revolver, and the other, drawing aside the sltirt: of .his coat;, disclosed a short sword dangling .at Iis side." As a check to Fenianism it is reeorded thiat at Dundalk, "The Rev. Father L'Gitili, O.O.,-in an eloquent sermon on Sunday last, donounced the parties who hld been the nicans of ensnaring the deluded y6itlis into the iuifshes of Fenianism. In tle course of thi' reverend gentleman's address le said heilad been informed of tihe party who dared to administer the.oath of disloyalty, and tlhat.if lhe-. would not come forward le would put thb officers of justice upon his track." -Liverpsool Alblion,.September . 11. THiE QUtEE.-In an article on the (Queen's continued scclusion, the Saturday Reviero says as follows:-Among many .proofs of the pro fouild respect whichis felt for the reigning sovereign may be'counted extreme unwilling ness to offer censure, criticism, .and.adi'ice. Thlose who are most.fully convinced .of the inexpediency of a piirtial habdication are never theless .reluctant to, tender.. any suggestion whichl mighlt seeon unpalatable or intrusive. To a gieat extent it is true that, in common estimatidon; as by legal ruli, the.Queeu can do no wroog. The credit which has been earned has not;yet been exhausted by long retirement from p-ulic life. Excess in fidelity andm earnest feeling .woild readily be excused if it were checked at last; but. the nation. may in time become tired of monotonous grief, and tombs enough have :been built. Aking or a queen is only Jife tenant of.an estate, with a moral right in the roversipner to imipacliiintet of waste. Ifthe dues.are allorwed to fill into disotitudc, thiy may niot hereafter be easily resumeri L i It is true that levees and drawing roomls a n'bt institutions of the highlest im portance, aid. that they are probably more tediousto the principal performers than to the crowded:l guests ,but a geiural who despises salutes, or a bishop wiho loses temper at the sight of a whiute neck-clotlh, is not more anuo mnalous ini his tastes than a king who dislikes the obeisances of his subjects. For several years viriotus mOembiers of the royal family Ihave hÂ·beon cmployl to receive the homago which eloeigs exclus'ively to tilme person of the Queen. It.is imnpossible to deny that a peeress, a lady ilayoress, or a sax doll might dischargo thu maltrial duty of'standing,in the corner of a room ihuile gentlenitan or ladies defile past in uin'ont'ed splendor oftattire. But the essence of the tiansaetion is the aclinowledgment that the Queen is tlhe head of society,. owing recip. rocal duties to those who 'come to offer their respectful siulutiutions. Except under the pressure of heavy aftliotion, the Queen has set an admirable example to privileged idlers who attemlpt to chidat the community of a trivial coinsideration fdr 'their abundant wages. Young officers who shirk parades, and young peers who slirke select committees, ought not to be able to .ollege, in precedient or excuse, thu eccentricities of a nobler character in a more dignified station. It is the duty of a Queen to go to a drawing-room as it is tlo duty ofa'curate to go to church. The losses whlichl sadden lifo scarcely justify the disuse of pleasure, and they can never cxcuse tihe abandonment of oflicial functions. LoUis NAPOLEON AND AI.
