SPORTING NOT US. THE TURK. MELBOURNE CUP DAY. [BY THE " NOVICE."] Cup Day, looked forward to by thousands ox person* ia all parts of Australasia, has again come around, and tlia oxcitemcnt earned by the running of this, now historical, event is as great as evor. In fact, greater interest appears to be taken from year to year in the Cup race, and all from the wealthy squattor and ininn-owner to the parcels' boy in a draper's shop must speculate according, and at times above their means. Almostas much money is speculated in up-country districts, and especially in Sandhurst, upon this race as there is in Molbourno for weeks prior to the running. This year is 110 exception to the rule, and the local bookmakers, who ply their avocations under the Verandah have been kept continually pencilling wsgers both "straight out" and in "doubles." The latter method of putting on a few pounds generally suits the layer of the odds, hut upon the present occasion it must bj a very lank outsider to win the Cup ' to givo the bookmakers " a skinner." With the great gun Nordenfeldt nearly every other horse in the race has been doubled, and judging by reports from the knowing ones, our local bookies will have to pay over. Saturday's racing opened badly for tlio layers, three first favorites out of tho six winning, whilst a second favorite, in Trenton, put an additional few pounds in the pub'ic'a pockets. To-day's racing will be the most open for some time past, the Cup in particular attracting the greatest atten tion. Since tho win of Nordenfeldt for the Derby, this horse has become a groat favorite and backed to win a great quantity of money. The running of Sheet Anchor in the Melbourno Stakes caused an inquiry for the horse, and nothing more than Â£15 to 1 was offered. Tho race in my opinion is an open one, and I venture to place Sheet Anchor, 1; Trenton, 2; St. John, 3. RAILWAY STAKES.-Cyclops, 1; Winchester, 2.

Our Melbourne correspondent writes:-The only horse scratched for the Melbourne Cup to day was Honoydew, so that there sire still thirty eight horses left in, and the anticipation so freely indulged in that the Oaulfield disaster would con siderably reduce the Melbourne Cup field has very little chance of being realized. It looks on the contrary as if the number of starters will be equal if not superior to that of any previous year. The greatest number i3 thirty- three, which was tho uumber in 1875, 1.876 and 1SS1. Last year only twsnty- fonr faced the starter. There are so many certain winners this year, that the tipsters are likely to ba more confounded than ever, but I am inclined to fancy that Stornaway, Kit Nubbles or First Chester will bo tho hero of the year. The following "are the probable starters and ridersBlink Bonny, Blair; *Lord Wilton, -; Tom Brown, Gainsforth; Trenton, Robertson; Kit Nubbles, Burton; Coriolanus, Moore; Sheet Anchor, M.

Sullivan, was as follows:-Cup-5 to 1 Nordenfeldt, G to 1 Trenton, 8 to 1 Despot, 10 to 1 Liverpool, 12 to 1 Brown and Rose, 20 to 25 to 1 others. |BT ELECTRIC TELEGRAPH.

MANDERS' SPORTING TELEGRAMS. (From Albert S. Manders, Telegraphic Agent.) MELBOURNE, 2nd November. The early morning was showery and gallops at Flemington merged into useful exercise. Liver pool, Trenton, and one or two others in the Cnp were there, but it was only those who had the minor distances to face who were put through use ful extenders. There are so many attractions and engagements for general turfites to-day in the matter of horse and fox terrier sales, pedestrianism, and general EBttlinu over last week's racing that, there was nothing doing of real worth at J3owes' this morn ing. For the Oup, Nordenfeldt still holds premierposi tion at 5 to 1, Trenton at a point more, with Despot and Liverpool next in demand. If any changes in the betting at all it will be with Blink Bonny or Brown and Rose. TIPS FOR TO-MORROW. RAILWAY STAKES.-Gasburner, Cyclops, Per chance.
