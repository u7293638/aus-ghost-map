WHAT JUDGE BOOTHBY THINKS.. Y.. Guess we thought we'd .got things all right,and valid, ""With'' out Imperial Act to J>atch up all flaws,' ' ' 1 That much-wished-for boon, roukd which we all rallied^ Twould defy even Boothhyito smash up our.laws ; • : '• " " But H.B. T. , "" ; ; ' . r Strangways, he' ' r : ; ! Saysjthat's all gammon;, for there aint no A.G/1 .:■> What! There aint no A. G. ? that's a curious,go, :it| Says Boothhyv the Judge—I must have time to think, And if, on reflection, I find that it's'so, '* ' ' •/ From doing my duty-you'll not fihdme shrink;1 .1 Let Boucaut, J. P. "Who says he's A. G. .)• ,. -. Come straightway befbre me, and show if he be. Now, 'though Boucaut, J. P. , has left bffhis wideiawa&e;, And wears a bell-topper, by no means so cheap, As becoming his rank; still he's not one to;quake. ?. You must still get up early to catch' him asleep. * ' So J.-P.,- J Boucaut h'e i-: / •" i u Says I'm hanged if I go—send a .Tipstaff for me.. .,■I. Judge Boothby" says he never heard in his, life," ( Of proceedings so clearly illegal, and bad, ' And Stow, Q.

So Boothby, B. , ij : Said that'he ' ' Would commit the whole lot; if a Tipstaff had he ! ■ The Tipstaff, however, not being forthcoming, His Honor proceeded to lay down; the law ; ' ■{ « And whenhe got blown, "Strangy" took up the running; ; Between, them they managed some pretty tall jaw; ' •! Says Boothby Bi J ■ • ; , In this cplom'e ,, , .;r. . I'm really ashamed to live, says he ! Unhappy colonists your course is fraught , . With dangers which you really cannot know; To put ,it very,shortly/' everything is nought," No 'Court; Attorney-General, or Stow ! ; .... _ Says Boothby B. • * r / v " A-.- • There's realty v % Only one valid man in the place, and that's me ! Now Parliament's met there must be a " scrimmage/': The extinguished A.
