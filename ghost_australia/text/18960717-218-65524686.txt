A DETECTIVE'S REMIN IS EN C ES. No. 7. A WIFE'S DEVOTION. B 11. T. CAssoN. Published by arrangement with Ward, Lock, and Bowden. [ALLM aIGisS nIESEVED. I had got tired of going to Blackpool for my holidays, and one summer, now more than twenty years since, I ventured to propose that we should try the country for once, instead of a crowded bathing-place. "The country? Why, I should be buried alive! It's all very well for you, with your fishing and ratting, rabbiting and sparrow-shooting, to propose the country; but I'm not going, and that's flat!" " Very well, then you will most certainly stay at home, for I am going to Ingleton, and I shall not stand the extra expense of two separate lodgings." Maria did not reply; to use a favourite expression of hers, she was completely flabbergasted at the idea that I should have the courage to say such a thing as that. The subject was not again mooted till I had actually got leave of absence for, three weeks; then I quietly told Maria to get ready for going away next day, if she wanted an outing that summer. After all, my wife is 'cute enough to know when it's no use to " kick " against any of my notions, and on the following morning she had everything ready, like a sensible woman. I had written to a friend at Ingleton, asking him to procure me two furnished rooms, but he had rented for a .month a small cottage about three miles from the town, at so reasonable a figure that I was greatly pleased. My friend, who was, I may here mention, the sergeant of police from a largo York shire town, on sick leave, met us at the station with a trap, and drove us to our new abode. I was sure Maria would have some fault to find with the house, and I was right. " What a dismal, solitary place to live in; I shall tire of it in a week. How far is it to the nearest house ?" " Not so far; only about three hundred yards," replied the sergeant. He did not .say that the nearest house was "To Let," or Maria might have been nasty, and bent on going back home. My friend had got the larder well provisioned, in accordance with my request, and after Maria had had a good "knife and fork tea" she was more cheerful. Next morning we were up early, bent on a walk up the valley to the Gingle Pot, and as our house was on the way, we had not more than a mile and a half to walk. Maria was not in the best of humour, and when we passed the "nearest house," and saw that it was empty, her bad temper showed itself. She point-blank refused to descend with me into Weathercote Cave, saying that if it were such dangerous places I had come to see, the pleasure would hbe all my own. I didn't wish to be selfish, and so returned home much sooner than I had intended. In the evening we walked down to the village, and in criticis ing the dresses of the lady visitors Maria spent a " good time." Presently we met the sergeant. " A, Mrs Smart, I am pleased to inform you.that you will have a neighbour to morrow. A lady has taken the house next yours. for a permanency. She seems in trouble, poor thing., ..r: --?r? ... . sharity to go and see her sometimes." "Of course I wilL Is .the house furnished -" No, she brings- her_ ow.,Lundrstand ytliythere she is: He walked forward to meet a lady-like woman, apparently about thirty, who smiled, but so sadly, that I felt sure she had some secret grief. The sergeant brought her forward to us, saying "Mrs Grey, let me introduce you to your nearest neighbours, that is, when you get settled." " You are a stranger here," said I; " have you come far?" "I was never here before, and I have come from Cumberland. I have been fortunate in obtaining a house at some distance from all others, for I have a nephew, who' is morbidly sensitive of strangers, and it is for his sake I wish to be lonely. He is dumb and his, mind is weak, but he is not an idiot." " Oh, how sad !" exclaimed Maria; " and is he always with you F" SAlways; there is no one to care for him, or me." " Where are you going to stay till you get settled ?" I asked. "At one of the hotels, although it will be expensive," replied Mrs Grey. I looked at Maria, and she guessed what I meant, for Maria is not without brains. " You can come and stay with us, and welcome,Mrs Grey; we have two bedrooms more than we require, and you will also be near your future home." She expressed her gratitude so warmly that Maria was quite taken with her, and with the aid of a light cart we got her luggage from the station, and took her home. She stayed with us a week, and before the end of that time a van load of furniture came from Lancaster, and Maria helped her new friend to arrange it. The night before she left to fetch her nephew, she said at the supper table " Mrs Smart, you have been very good to a desolate woman, and I shall ever cherish adeep feeling of gratitude towards you both. I have something to say which will, I greatly fear, offend you, but I can not help it. When I come back, and get into my new house, you must never come to see me; our pleasant intercourse must end here." "not come to see you? " said Maria, in surprise; "whynot? I was thinking of asking Samuel to let me stay here a few weeks after he goes back, my health his improved so much since Ihave been here." S"For the saske of my niephew ?I must decline all intercourse with every one after he comes. My life belongs to him, my every thought and care. He cannot bear a strange face; it makes him wild with suffering and terror. You must never come to the cottage, and not only so, you must try to keep. others away, so long as you stay here. You will do this for my Marla promised, but, as she told me afterwards, she was bitterly disappointed. She had taken such ileasure in helping 'Mrs Grey to arrange her home, and had looked forward to spending many delight ful hours with her, an4 now she was shut out-dismissed. As for me, I thought the wonman very foolish. It did not seem to me justifiable to devote her whole life to her.nephew, to shut herself out from intercourse from all her friends, for a child who. could never appreciate her sacrifice, or make any return for her immolation upon the altar of duty. Iunt Mrs Grey spoke in a tono that did not admit of argument, so arisa, like a sen- I sible woman, promised to do as she wished. , Thank you, Mrs Smart; ny life sorrow no one can ever share, no one can ever lighten; only pray for me that iny strength, may endure as long as the necessity for it exists. There will never be any freedom for me but in death." Next morning she left us, and a week passed by with the cottage up the valley standing empty, waiting for its occupants. Then one morning, as I sauntered up the valley for a walk before breakfast, 1 noticed smoke coming from the chimney of the cottage, and as I got nearer I saw a pile of packing cases in the front garden, and guessed that Mrs Grey and her nephew had arrived. As I stopped, the lady her self came to the door and said, " Good morning." "When did you come, and how?" I asked. "Maria had been on the look- out for you every day." "We came last night. I could not bring Willie in the train, he would have been too terrified. We came in a carriage." At that moment a terrible sound, some thing between a scream and a roar, came from the silent house, and without a word, but with a ghastly face from which all light and peace and pleasure had vanished, she floew back into the house. I stood for a few moments wondering what the horrid noise could have been, and presently I heard it again, but it got fainter and then ceased. Were these frightful sounds for ever in her ears, and probably still more frightful sights before her eyes? I met her next day in the village. She was walking rapidly, but stopped on seeing me. m' I am pleased to see you out, Mrs Grey," I said. " 1 am obliged to come," she answered. "I must buy our food; but I am never easy a minute when I am away. I am in constant terror." I told her how pleased Mrs Smart would be to do any errand for her in the village, if she would call at our house, and she said there were days when she would be glad of help in that way, when it was utterly im possible for her to leave her charge, even if they had not a mouthful to eat in the house; so I promised her that I would myself go down to the village if Maria could not, even d tay.--. . ' But I wishf' I said, "that yon,would allow either Maria or I to come to your house every day, if only to inquire for you.' How frightened the poor woman seemed, to be sure ! "No, Mr Smart, you must not do that!" and as she trembled with apprehension I reassured her. " What would you do, Mrs Grey, if you were taken ill?" " Oh, Mr Smart, don't hint at the possi bility of such a thing. .I dare not." " Indeed, I hope you will not, but think what might happen. It is not right, not safe, for your nephew's sake, and yours." At last she agreed that Maria might go to the cottage every day if she thought proper when Mrs Grey did not come down the valley past our house, and with- this I was forced to be content. "There is some mystery about that cottage," I said to myself on my way home. "But it is nothing dishonourable, of that I am as certain as it is possible to be without knowing her secret." Well, there was no sign of our mysterious friend next day, and after tea Maria set off up the valley to see her. She left me reading a Liverpool paper, a long account of the capture of a gang of coiners being too interesting to let me go part of the way with her, as Maria hinted she would like me to do. It seemed as though only a few minutes had passed when Maria came back, looking so scared that I guessed she had been startled in a more than usually serious way. " Oh, Sam, there is something up there altogether wrong. I saw nothing of Mrs Grey about the garden, and knocked at the front door, and I suppose she did not hear me, so I knocked harder. Such a fright I got! Something set up such a horrid scream I thought a madman had got loose. I would have run away, but I seemed paralysed. Then she came to the door, and seemed as much frightened as me. She said she would hang a cloth out of her bedroom window when that child had a fit on him, and if I did not see the signal I must return home without seeing her. What do you think of it all, Sam?" I did not know what to think, and told her so. Somehow or other I began to fancy there -t 0;- kfd.;..d,1 all this mystery, and yet for Mrs Grey's sae ar n ----- try to fathom it. The good people of Ingleton, with all due deference to their foeelingrs-n inveterate, gossips, and the ladies were soon curious about'the new tenants of the cottage. I did my best to keep folks away from the place, and was in the main successful; but some there were, more daring or more inquisitive, who wished to see for themselves. They knocked at the closed door, and if no one opened it a louder knock was sure to invoke the roaring sound that had startled me on the morning of Airs Grey's arrival, and there was some thing so savage, so beastly, so terrifying in the awful sound, that no one had courage to try it again. Even the village boys, the most daring of young Vandals, went past the cottage in their rambles up the valley without attempting to enter the garden gate, and no one in the neighborhood was brave enough to pass it after dark. Unlike most wonders, it did not die out in the conventional nine days; there was so much of mystery, of curiosity, of fear, connected with the whole subject that people could not forget or push it aside, and in a neigh borhood where every inhabitant was inti mately acquainted with the minutest family affairs and concerns of every one else, where nothing of importance came to crowd the hoso Cottage mystery out of mind, speculation ran rife, and day by day the story grew. Every one seemed a self constituted spy upon the poor creature; the fact that she had a secret, and chose to keep it, was a personal injury, and all felt justified in doing their best to force it from her. Knowing our friendship for the lonely woman, and aware that my wife was the only one in whom Mrs Grey had reposed any confidence, folks flocked to us with tales and rumors till Maria was nearly wild with anger. Of course we did not believe any of the half-whispered tales the gossips brought us; but we had nothing to urge against them. One day the village post master button-holed me as I was passing, and told me that Mrs Grey received a large number of letters, and a post-office order for £3 every week; but I surprised him by telling him he was liable to get into trouble by telling office secrets. Then the butcher confided to me.the strange intelligence that he "Never knew anybody eat so much meat as that delicate little woman up at Rose Cottage. Why she buys twice as much as you, M]r Smart ! " But my holiday expired, and I was obliged to return home. Maria decided to stay for a month or six weeks longer, and promised to keep me well-informed as to the welfare of our friend, for whom my wife had conceived a strong feeling of regard. IMaria, contrary to her usual custom, wrote me long letters, full of news about Mrs Grey, and I will give the purport of them, Maria behing too prone to ramble from her 'subject. "Sometimes," said my wife, "as I pass her gate in the morning, Mrs Grey comes out, and talks to me for a few minutes, but always with one ear towards the house, listening. Now and then she seems more peaceful and blight, though the shadow never leaves her sweet face, and the frightened look never dies out of her eyes. At other times she looks so weak and worn that it almost seems as if a puff of wind would carry her away. Idon't believe she is more than thirty, but she is beginning to look fifty, and her hair is sprinkled with grey. I tell hoer she is killing herself; that she should have some one to help her; and I have reminded her that little Willie would be left to the world's mercy if she should die. But it is all breath wasted. She says there is nothing else to be done that she must do her duty as long as she can, trusting that God will take care of the boy when her work is ended. One day she came to me with a hapdkerchief tied round her head, and said she had a l;egdache; but as we stood together I saw a tiny drop of blood show through the linen, and I made heg take it off. She resisted, saying it was nothing; she had fallen down, and hit her head against a sharp corner. But when she removed - the bandage I saw a long, ugly cut on her temple, and a large discolored bruise beside it. She tried to laugh it off, and said it would soon be all right. Going down to market one morning earlier than usual I met her, accompanied by her boy, and strange as you will think it, there does not seem the least bit of shyness about him. He is a lovely child, and I don't wonder that his aunt is devoted to him. But how she can say be is shy beats me altogether." This part of one of Maria's letters deepened the mystery. Was it possible the cottage had another inmate besides Mrs Grey and the boy? That would ac count for the consumption of meat, and for her desire to keep folks away. If this was the solution of the mystery, the other inmate must be an adult; could it be her husband ? Maria stayed at Ingleton till the end of October, when the weather became too cold for her, and she came home. But she corresponded regularly with Mrs Grey, who seemed to have got into smoother water after the departure of the summer visitors from the neighborhood, the village people having tired of gossip and conjec ture about the inmates of the cottage. Summer came round again, and .Maria eagerly looked forward to a meeting with her friend. I never knew my wife to be taken with any one before. May was scarcely in ore she wanted to be off, and I managed to getthree days' leave to take her to her summer residence. It was a lovely morning, the first after our arrival, when we started up the valley, to call on Mrs Grey, Maria beilg frill of the anticipations aroused by the expected meeting. But on reaching the cottage we found the windows closed, and everPthing as silent as the grave. .."Shall I knock? ". I said to Maria. " Better not; she knew we were coming, and the signal would have been out of the window if she were at liberty to come to us. We will come again after dinner." I agreed, but feeling a presentiment that something was wrong, decided to enter the cottage if no response to our summons were then obtained. Before dinner I walked down to the village, and was startled by the butcher, as I passed his shop, coming to the door and telling me that Mrs Grey had not been there since Saturday. It was now Wednesday; four days had elapsed since she had been seen in the village, and I went back to Maria, feeling more disposed than ever to think that all was not right. At three o'clock we set out, and twenty minutes easy walking took us to. the cottage. I looked as eagerly as Maria for signs of life, but there were none. I knocked loudly at the door, but there was no re sponse. Going round to the back, I found the kitchen window partly open, and got in, opening the door to let in Maria. -. All was silent, and she clung to my arm, trembling, likea leaf. " Something has happened, Sam I Where can Mrs Grey be ? " I did not care to speak aloud, thinking that awful roar would follow; a noise that I knew long ago did not proceed from the throat of little Willie. There was no sign of either Mrs Grey or the child down stairs, and, Maria following timidly in my wake, I went upstairs. The first door we came to I opened. It was, or rather had been, Mrs Grey's bedroom. Upon her chair lay her mantle, and her little black hat; on a table was her work-basket, with a coat of Willie's she had been mending. But the bed had not been slept in; it was as neat and smooth as when she made it. I called Maria's attention to it, and she turned white as a ghost (she believes in ghosts; I don't), and she nodded without speaking; she was too much frightened. .. "Maria," I said,." I begin : to fear that either something very serious -hashap-: pened, and we shall find evidence .of. it-in one of the other two bedrooms, or..thet whole family has slipped away as quietly as they came among us, and we shall never hear anything more of them." "I'll never believe that!" said Maria, in ?i8',e,· u Sht would have left me some must be in the house." " Well, we will see; but I wish you had not come." A faint warning cry reached our ears as [ spoke; it came from the next room. " That is Willie," said Maria. Softly and gently I opened the door. " My God !" cried Maria. She had caught sight of her friend, lying at full length on the carpet. " Stand back, Maria, this is no sight for you." But she had also seen a little convulsed figure, rigid and foaming at the mouth; it was the boy, and lifting him in her arms she carried him downstairs. The room bore witness to a fearful struggle, the window sash was torn and smashed, chairs and other furniture broken, while blood stains were.everywhere-on the floor and ruined furniture, on the wallsand window. Mrs Grey had been murdered by the man she had .shielded-that was now my opinion. Taking the child with us, we hurried down the valley, and being overtaken by a farmer going to the village I sent a mes sage to the police. " The poor child seems dying of fright,", said Maria. " He must have witnessed the whole horrible sight." He was conscious, but would not open his eyes, and quivered and trembled in a pitiable way at every sound and movement. Maria, although she has never had any children of- her own, gently roeeked and petted him until he grow quieter. The sergeant of police called on me on his way up to the cottage, and together, we searched the house. Not the slightest clue to the mystery of the presence of a man in the house could we find. What had become of all the letters she had received? Had the murderer destroyed them, and removed every vestige of evidence that might bring him to justice ? In a drawer in her work table, pushed behind, and evidently not seen, was one brief letter, written in a mnanly,:handsomo hand to "Dear Alice," and signed, "Your loving husband, James Baker." If that was her name, Grey must have been an assumed name. Not a farthing in money was found either in the possession of the victim, or in the house; he had evidently taken it with him in his flight, and as the alternative to a funeral at the expense of the parish, Maria had urged me to find the money. I had agreed to do this, and had given orders to the local undertaker, when a letter con taining a .£10 note was received by the sergeant, the sender not giving his or her name. I guessed it was the same friend or relative as had sent MIrs Grey the post office order for £3 every week. The in quost resulted in a verdict of "Wilful murder against somen person unknown," and there being not the slightest clue to him, there seemed little chanceof his being brought to justice. MIaria and I followed the poor woman to the grave. As Ilooked upon her face for the last time I mentally registered a vow to track her murderer, if possible. Her thin, toil-worn hands were clasped upon her quiet breast; the sad, pale face, for all its sunken lines, wore acalm and peaceful look. Her release had come, her burden was lifted; her mission was ended, and at last she could rest. Under the soft waves of her hair, which had grown nearly white since the previous autumn, was a terrible wound, her death blow. Full descriptions of mother and child were given in the papers, if by chance her friends might recognise her and communi cate with us; but all our inquiries were fruitless. She appeared as unknown and friendless as if she had fallen from the clouds. Ten days after she was buried the child she had loved so well followed her. He clung to Maria passionately, never letting her out of his sight when awake, and nearly going into convulsions if any one else approached or touched him, but the frail body grew daily weaker, and when the little life went out we all rejoiced that he too had found rest. I felt sure that Willie was MIrs Grey's own child; she had had some powerful motive for saying he was her nephew. Maria did not wish to stay at Ingleton after this, but before going home I.went to the cottage, alone,:to have another search. I don't know what prompted me to do this, for the sergeant and-I-had twice, ran sacked every room, and found nothing. _ The furniture remained unmolested;:the landlord claimed it for rent he declaredto, be owing, and he had.tried to let the cot tage as a furnished-residenoe -for summer visitors, but-no one eared to live.there,-. Again I turned over every room, very. article, and was going. away. disappointed when I caught sight of the :corner. of..a piece of paper at the edge of the carpet, near the fireplace. Pulling it. out, I found it was a letter, which ran :as fol lows: " DEAa SIsrnx,-I have succeeded in getting the money you require, and .here with send it to you, hoping your husband will continue to improve. But do consider the risk you run -in trying-to leave the country. -I know .your, present life must be very miserable ;.always haunted.by the fear that your husband's hiding- place.may, be discovered., The detectiveslhave not in the least relaxed.their vigilance,.for-.not.a single male stranger comes -here.unper ceived.: Father is as bitter as ever, and. if he even fancied yon kneorwhere James was he would stop your allowance. --.I shall-be in great suspense until-i read the news of your safe arrival in America., If I could only persuade you to leave the man who. has. made yourlife a misery. Do think of all you are giving up for a mat who does not care a-jot for you. But there, Alice, I: do not wish to grieve. you, for -we may niever meet again. It, is nearly six, and father will be here directly. Good-bye, dear sister. May God keep you wherever you go. Your loving sister, KATa." 14 ' It was exactly.as I .had- expected. Thea murdered woman had paid the penalty of devotion to a villain with her life. What crime had he committed? I could not re member any James Baker in our Gazestte for any serious offence. Was that his real name ? There was no address atthe top of the letter, nor any envelope to show the postmark. There was nodate even'on the letter, showing that the greatest possible precautions had.been taken to prevent dis covery. - " On arriving at home I searched the hack numbers of the Gazette, and at lasthit upon a likely case. Some weeks. before Mrs Grey came to.Ingleton e heavy forgery had been committediby the cashier of a branch bank in one of.the outlying suburbs of the Metropolis. The forger had absconded, and was supposed to have escaped from the country. But the man's name was not Baker; it was James Adamson. \--I lost no time in seeing our chief, after reaching home, and, as 1 expected, he packed me off to London to tell all I knew to the Scotland Yard authorities. There I learnt who Mrs Grey really- was--the daughter.of a manager of the bank-where James Adamson was at first a clerk. -She had been attracted by his handsome face, and been persuaded by him to agree to a secret marriage. She continued to reside at home, where her husband wrote her letters, signing himself James Baker. Three months had not elapsed after her marriage when the forgery was committed, and then the young wife left her home to fly the country with her husband, "The fear of detection - seems ,to have touched his brain," said Kate Millard to me, at an interview I contrived to obtain with her. "But he was no longer mad when he murdered -poor Alice, and were I a man, I would track him, if he. is on earth." \- - It was Kate who had sent the £10 note, to defray the funeral expenses of her sister. She dared not openly acknowledge her: relationship to the murdered woman. Notwithstanding the increased vigilance, of the detectives, not the slightest trace could be obtained of the fugitive, and had it not been for Maria, I should in time have forgotten the affair. - we started -for. ourannual holidaythen she wouldr'. wonder if ,we are to :ave an' adventure this year.? Ever since that notable year at Ingleton Maria and I went to a fresh 'place every year. .This year we had decided to try the Devonshire.coast, Maria's mother .having. been. a native of that country. I. fixed upon Bude as our head-quarters, and-we greatly enjoyed our brief sojourn in that old-fashioned fishing village. One fine day,I set off for. a walk to Holsworthy, a small town about eight miles inland.- I had been told there was a fine old church there, and I have always had a liking for ancient .buildings. W-When I reached the little sleepy town,the boys were pouring out of.the school, and turning into the churchyard I was followed -.by the schoolmaster, a grave, sad-looking, man, whose face indicated that the.cares of- this world were not unknown to him. He un locked the church door, and -I followed him inside. I was in hopes he would, act as guide, and .tell. me the history of some-of the marble and-brass, tablets on.the walls, but he went straight to the organ;-, and began playing..- Never in my life have' I heard " Vital Spark", played as- he played it. - Presently he, began it .again, and accompanied himself in a rich tenor- voice. Just as he finished a -boy, entered- the. church, and stood listening. . "He'll play.the '.Dead March' next,'! whispered the boy. - He comes hero eyery day at noon, and.always. plays the, same two things." ' The boy was right. The -solemn--tones of the funeral dirge rolled through-the church, and the capabilities of the organ were shown to.the utmost.. Then the . schoolmaster - came- out:. as silently as he had; entered. He-walked with his :head down,.and, his ,eyes:fled upon the floor, and.did not seem-to see either the-boy or me. But he left the keys in the door. ' - "He. knows I shall lock, the--door-: feyther's parish clerk," said the boy: - Iwent to the Holsworthy.Arms to dine;, .and overrsome ham:and eggs astked the landlor4 a few questions about the sehool master. "Yes, he is rather queer, but we are all usedto him, now. He is a capitalteacher; gives all his mind to the children, and: brings them on wonderful. He's music mad: never so happy, if he can be happy, as when he is at the organ. Folks think he applied for the school so as to get to the organ when he- liked. : He -came- here about seven or eight years since,- and stayed with me for a month. Then he took lodgings with a- tailor in the town, till the old schoolmaster died, and he.got the place." I had told Maria that I might not-be back at Buds that night, and in the even. ing again wandered into the church, hear ing the organ as I passed. " Strange l" I thought, "that he should be so fond of those two pieces." "'Vital Spark," but with a female voice nos. join ing in the duet, echoed through the church. I waited till I heard them move, and then, not wishing to be thought rude, went out. At supper I asked my landlord if the schoolmastor had a- sister or other female relative residing with him. "No; but I can guess why you ask. Yon heard him singing with Fanny Loder. They are sweethearts, and will get married some day. Hler father has hinted that there is no need to put it off any longer, for they've been courting four years, but IMr Fonton doesn't seem in much of a hurry." Before six next morning I was fishing in the Torridge, having been told that the river was well worth a trial. I had taken a book with me to while away the time, not being an adopt with the fly. I had caught four fine trout, and was fixing my bait when Iheard a splashnot far off,and in another moment saw a man struggling in the river. There had been heavy rain a few days previous, and the stream was full. I saw at once that the man could not swim, and throwing off my coat and boots, I ran some distance ahead, and then plunged in. A swirl caused by abend in the river brought himinear my side of the bank, and I had little difficulty in reaching him. It was the schoolmaster I The sudden immersion and his struggles had exhausted.him, and it was with great difficulty I got him landed,: .the bank being rather high. - For:several minutes he lay insensible on the grass, but fortunately I had brought my brandy flask with me, and a draught from that revived him. When he opened his eyes, heseemed .so.frightened that I fancied he must have been nearer drowning than I had thought; his countenance appeared to be convulsed with some strange horror, and he trembled like a man I once saw hung in Kirkdale Gaol. SCome, Mr Fenton, you must get home as quick as you can, and ichange your clothes," and I helped him up. Leaning heavily on my arm, and still trembling, we walked slowly to Holsworthy, and having given him into the care of the old woman who kept house for him, I wont back for my rod, which I had left on the river bank. .Having got it, I thought I might as well take.that of the schoolmaster,, otherwise it might disappear. But there was no sign of any rod; it had probably fallen in to.the water with its owner. I-was re tracing my steps when I spied a small book in the grass. It proved to be a copy of Shelley's Poems. On the fly-leaf were the following verses - "-Thou'rt gone, dear wife, and I am left \- 'Without thy love to cheer me; Earth seems of all its joys bereft, Now thou no more are nearno. Thou'rt gone, and yet thou liv'st enshrined Where Death can ne'er efface thee Around my heart-strings fondly twined There I can ever trace thee. " Oft in the visions of the night - Enraptured, I behold thee; And though thou seem'st an angel bright, To my heart again I fold thee. Oh, may thy spirit, pure and blest, Through life thus guard and guide me; And when in slumber sweet I rest, Dearest, then watch beside me." Opposite to the lines quoted, on the inside cover of the book, a name had been scratched out. I always carry with me a small pocket magnifying glass, and after some trouble I made out the name, and was thereby much excited. For the name was " Alice Millard." Fool that I was not to have suspected it before! This schoolmaster, Mr Charles Fenton, was really James Adamson, the murderer of his angel wife, the woman who had endured a martyrdom for his sake. .Her sister had told me of his musical gifts, and also that'ho had been trained as a schoolmaster, but not liking the profession had. got a clerkship in a bank. Kate Millard had no photo of the forger to assist me in tracking him, but she had described h.im, and but that his dark brown hair had ,turnedgrey, the description was sufficiently accurate to make me sure that I had run the murderer to earth. But I would make sure before committing myself. The little schoolhouse was within the school walls, and thither I went. " Mr Fenton is too ill, and cannot see anybody," said the old woman, but before I could say anything he came to the door. " Come in, sir; I have to thank you for saving my life.
