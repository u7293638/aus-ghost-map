Gilbert , pale* grave, and -worn with suffering and .trial, with the. silver threads already mingling with the brown curls,' which Were once her pridb lo sec ; and Blanche her girlish gaity softened by hor great sorrow into gontlo loving womanhood, were once more sido by side. How they had both hoped and prayed for this meeting. How each suffering heart yearned for one moment's sight of the face most loved on earth ; and now they had met, it was as with the shadow of an open grave between them. ? Gilbert looked upon her unchanged loveliness, and forgot ' everything ' that hfld passed since the day they parted in, mistaken rage on his part, and sicken ing despair on hers; forgot , that the ' world was before him to work and snffer in, and that she was. the envied posses eot of a princely fortune. He remeria bered nothing save that she was there,, loved and lovely as over ; that to hor gentle lips had been confided his dead wife's last words of him, and he silently held out his hands. ' ? And Blanche. What did she feel in the moments that elapsed before the silent action ? That she saw before her the actual, real figure of Gilbert Ber ! tram,; she did riot doubt ; but the sud den revulsion of feeling almost over , powered her. She, too, thought of tho death that she had witnessed on that sunny summer day ; and Marion's gen tle face seemed to vise befoi'e her like a vision. There was none to stand between , them now — none to ? separate tho tried hearts so long severed — and withouta word she answered the' mute appeal, and. ^sprang. : into i, the arms stretched out 'to'erffold her.' . '??' . .'?:ti ' Blanche !' ? 'Gilbert!' \ : . Not ? another ? word was spoken, and Mr Acton silently closed the door, and sought the room of the lively Fanchette, feeling such a meeting too sacred to be intruded upon. ? Chapter XXVII. .

The bustling little Fanchette hurried off to the apartment of her lodger, anil informed her of the fact that the gentle man had left the young lady with Ma dame, and was sitting with her old. far ther beside her ironing stove. ' And talking, to him just like an old friend,' she said, delighted, ' and my father is so pleased and happy.'' . . Pauline was too pre-occupied to heed much of what. Fanchette was saying. - , 'How have they met ?' she asked herself.. '' As. long parted lovers or only 'as common acquaintances would ?' She made all possible baste and joined' Mr Acton, who was,.as Fanchetto said', making himself agreeable to; tho old man. He looked up as she entered. ?; ;' Well, Madame Lannay,' he said,, 'what do you mean by frightening honest1 folk in this manner ?? Where did he come from ?' ' I don't know,' she replied. 'He appeared here suddenly about two hours since. I was as much frightened, as you, I can assure you.1' ? .

He reached the Place Vert, and stopped a moment to look at some fine engravings in the handsome shop at one of its corners. ' They will not have had time to .tell her yet, ' he said to himself. , ' I must loiter a bit. ' .. The shop had a side window, looking into a narrow alley, for foot passengers only, and he stepped into the entrance of it to see more closely a water-colour drawing which attracted his eye. He had scarce stood there a minute when a loud exclamation startled him, and turning round, he saw Walter, the well remembered servant of Blanche, stand ing a few feet from him. He was very glad to see the faithful fellow, and making a step forward, he held out his hand.

He walked quickly up' tothe terrified Walter, and, slapping him smartly on the baclt, said, 'lam no ghost, man j does that feel like it ? Why, Walter, have you no word of welcome for mo; ?''i ' That's a mortal slap, I'll be bound,'' said the terror-stricken Walter to 'him f self, and he ventured a look into the ?face that bent overhim.

' 1 would not have' any harm befall Miss Blanche for all the world.1' ' I will, ' replied Gilbert, and so say ing he hastened across the Place Vert, meeting Pauline on her way to fetch him, leading his little boy by the hand. Upon the joyous meeting between the mother and her long lost son, none of the party intruded. A long time passed before either of them were sufficiently composed to join; Pauline and Blanche :i the drawing toom, and when they did ?so the reunion was a eilemVone; all ;feeling;too. much: for words. Pauline had returned home for - her father and the little igirl, 'and the 'party that .sat down to dinner in Blanche's spacious saloon was exactly what she1 ;had so long desired, !but scarcely hoped: to see. Pauline,; too, i was very quiet; :she alonoof all assembled there had cause' for i sorrow, lit 'was :. her husband -who1 had iwrought rtheir : former sorrow, and; sent them .scatteredinto the world ; 'and' it^iffas his Bandwiich wasraboutlto^bring) xesh^ misery upon her sister's loving heart, and once more destroy the hap .pinessi she was again enjoying. Dinner over, Gilbert oxcused himself on the plea of businessj and hastily quitting the house, he walko3 to the lodging occupied by Madame Lannny. He remembered tho words of Pauline, that tho doctor who had attended her could tell something abodt her husband, and he resolved to find him and fathom : the dark mystery that surrounded this nian^to. the uttermost. The door was opened by tho cheerful Panchette, who readily gave the re quired information, and he started at : once for that gentleman's house, which was ih-a retired street at tho bottom of the Grand Place. It was dark when ho emerged from tho house, but there was a flush upon his cheek, and . a light as of. triumph in his eye. \ '' I have the missing link at last,', ho said to himself.

We must carefully look to our own; forces before we engage in battle with so formidable;a foe.' 'Gould we not have them arrested as swindlers and forgers ?'' said Gilbert. ' My dear sir, Hubert Lannay and his friend are old'hands,' replied Mr Acton. ' Were they arrested now, you would find no proof of ;their- crime ; and what witness have you to prove you really ob served them when you did.' ' True, true,' said Gilbert. ' I -was alone, but the attack on my life ?' 'Again I say, no. witnesses; the gipsies did not see 'the shot frrod.' ' True again,' Gilbert- said. 'What shall we do ?' ' Catch them in their own net,' Mr Acton replied. 'Tell Miss de Cressey as much as is absolutely necessary she should know, and then 'go back to Eeardon and wait.' 'I wrote to. the gipsy 'Pharos,' Gilbert said, 'from Goblentz, desiring him to let -me know where to ' find him' on my return, in case he is wanted.' 'Wanted ;' exclaimed' the lawyer. 'Of course he will be wanted. It's a; fine case ! a'fine case,' he repeated, pro fessional zeal for a moment overcoming all private feeling on the subject. 'There is 'but- one drawback.'' ' What is that '?' Gilbert asked. 'Poor Madame Lannay,' he replied. 'You lieed not fear for her,' said; Gilbert. ';She is prepared for the1 iworst. It was from her I learned a igredt deal of 'what I'have now told lyOU.'' ?-:????? j ' (Shall rwe tetufii 'moW ??'-? ' said' ' tW lawyer. 'The sooner we are back ''ihj England all of us the better.', ' Will you speak to Blanche* on this most painful subject ?' Gilbert asked as they turned to go. 'If yon- wish it, certainly,' was the reply, ' but surely you have the right now to speak to her respecting her ? affairs. I am not wrong in supposing so, I trust.' ' Ican.hardlyanBwer that question,' Gilbert replied. ' Our meeting1 this morning was so unexpected, so overpowering that I hardly, know what passed. That Blanche forgives me, loves me, I can have no doubt ; butwhether the heiress of Roar don will think it expedient.to link her self for life to a.. penniless. widower is: anotbor matter.'1 ' My dear sir, yotrnced have no fears' on that score,' replied Mr Acton, smil ingly. ' The heiress of Eeardon, amidi all her wealth, and splendour, is just the; same simple hearted charming Blanche; de Cressey that she was years ago. : X 'am quite surecould we read her thoughts; at thismoment, that she is .planning all! sorts of improvements .and .alterations; in ..lliat , palace -of hers, for ithe .comfort of i its future master. ,If.

Her father also -wished to accompany her, beiDg already weary of the qniet time he had spent wish his daughterarid her guests. ? Jffe was'very glad to see her again ; . but his mind, perverted and vitiated by a course of dissipation and unnatural and artificial life, craved strong excite-' ment, and he was more wearied with the monotony of this one evening than he would 'have been with nights at the ' gaming table or ale house. .
