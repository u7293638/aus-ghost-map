TO THE KDTTOR. Sirâ€” 'Shakspeare's Ghost' works as hard as, or perhaps harder, for his living than Mr. . Tomktnson does for his. His remarks are not gracious or generous. However. I believe him to be an honourable and generous man, especially when he is not offended. Since writing my first letter I have learnt with regret that Douglas has not much in his own favour to ask the favours of the public of South Australia. Although the Rev. Mr. Parsons is a gen tleman 1 hardly know, 1 do think he is deserving of the respect that every clergyman ought to have, and in this painful case he most assuredly has taken the position of a Christian gentleman. Mr. Tomkinson's remarks have neverthe less, I am sure, done good ; and to give him his due, his letter of yesterday was really good. . I am, Sir, &c;, SHAKSPEARE'S GHOST. Adelaide, June 2.
