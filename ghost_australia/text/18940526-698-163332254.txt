The shops at Christmas are full of pretty things, not so much to attract customers, but to celebrate Christmas in the correct fashion. The butchers, perhaps,, take the foremost rank in decoration. They have garlands and flowers in pots ; their prime beef is gam shed with mottoes, ' and their mutton is smothered in mistletoe. The shades of the Druids must feel quite at home if they walK down Helstone streets before Christmas, and it must recall to them their ancient groves, where their silver knives -gleamed among shining leaves and .wax-like berries, and the white robed victim was marched off solemnly to die. Would they now still look round fora victim to offer during these midnight nights ? But perhaps in this our nineteenth century they would find that many would willingly step forth to offer themselves up, glad to leave a world made less joyous by the enfeebled faith of the old race of human beiDgR. But' Helstone, as a town, . had no fin ''» sleek ideas. The pastrycooks had made Christmas cakes centred by Father Christmas in cot ou wool and white sugar atd adorned with holly leaves and berries. Their makers were sure of customers, for they held out the inducement of possibly winning the whole 'structure, if only a sixpenny share were taken. The meeting of the Druids could not have been more solemn than these evening assemblies in a ; little upper room, where the members came together to draw lots for one of these huge Christmas cikee. Men, women, and children sat round in breathless expectation till the prizewinner was declared, and Father Christmas with all his snow and ice sugar was carried off, encircled by one pair of happy arms,, whilst the Unsuccessful retired poorer by a sixpence by the faith, in -their luck. Besides cake lotteries, .there were carts full of holly and mistletoe . that had lumbered in. from the country, and were r -now reaping sixpences' with easy carelessness, the owners thereof every year making the same eolemu declaration that this season holly berries were scarce and mistletoe had to be hunted for as for lost treasure. The florists, too, were gay with choice hot-house flowers, which might be yours at exorbitant prices, for tradesmen think that at Christmas everybody's purse is open and every heart is warm. But, above all, the petty joys and the petty sorrows, and the great joys and the great sorrows, the Cathedral towered calm and unbending, judging impartially the various actions of the pigmies at its. feet. Impartially? Is there impartial human, judg ment ? Inez had resolved to obey her husband. Even Hetty was not to guess that anything was the matter. Sometimes it seemed impossible to the . young wife that anyone' should ignore Basil was Amhappy, and that she had been the cause of it. Surely it must be written on her forehead in fiery letters, and all the world must read them as they passed by. ? .. ...... In time, all would came right— must come r&ht; ; hut till then ehe had her part to perform and her courage had not yet failed. : .. This was the resolve she constantly made when she was left alone with Hetty. .She tried to imagine that they were still girls together. She talked of old timer, When her aunt had first tried to tame her unruly spirits, bnt even then Hetty often trod on forbidden ground, and said that if Inez had never been 'cent to school t^ua^O!uU^Tj?,|^pe Tight, .^p^'^ez^ shook hei; heap, ? . ? ,- . , ? i*^ -?'?'' -w r/-; ?'' ^'' T ,.. \, 'No; ,1 learnt fnejeaom there..

'But* dear Inez, jthose worn-out myths, as you call them, do ,niake,.8aintB, 8uph,as Mrs.. Whltewbod, for instance.' The young- wife's, eyes kindled.

I can't atgue as you' do, Inez, but a saint is— is. well— Mrs. Whitevood !' Inez's upper lip-curled, slightly., . . . . 'If I used ,, those ..terms or believed in then I . should call; her p-a sinnsr ; but I don't. We are all made in; a fashion which we cannot alter.' . . ' Well, dariing, jou snail think as you' like. I know you can never do anything.. ,tbat. is not noble. Is that another nieamngJessTwqrd,?' and. Hetty laughed, -adding, '- Well, you alioiv'ine to cill Basil noble, don't you ? I)o you know, Inez, he seems to me more like au old. . preux chevalier than anyone else I could uanie. He could not hurt a fly.'' ; ' Not .unless he- thought U right. But even Basil does not know that all this is an abstract question, dependent-on climate, .character, idiosyncrasy.' '1 wouldn't mind, being wrong with him,'. said Hetty softly. , . ' Buj;,ithat-is not right aud true. We must .'not. we inus_t ucff, take our jJreed |rbm ,thQ?e we love. We need not say a word' against it, but to adopt it because of them. Oh,, no, Hetty, surely. that would be dis honourable. ^Besides I could not do so now.' ' Why not ? .How. happy. I should be if —if you thought as th^yflo,— Basil and his mother.' ' Oh no,'- noj ' that would mean — — Hetty, that would ruin all our lives if I thought as you do. ' ' I cguldnt.' Jletty had acquired a gentle per sistency which in old days she had been too much under rule to cultivate. ' ? ' Inez began to walk up and down the room. It was a habit she.'. had lately, adopted. Hetty did not like to see it. Tne Doctor had talked of nerves,' and cer tainly there/were signs that Inez's originally strong nerves were failing her. \ r . . ' ' Basil was Iongerjaway than he .expected, and then he wrote a line'to say that .Tip' :had .told his mother they shpuld-ali cOme.dojtfn b'efore ; Christinas, .which . was at hiand.!. Would Jpe? get- everything ready for the journey? He would come home early on the 23rd, and they should go on by the afternoon train. The letter was short, . but it began ' My darling,' and ended '...Your loving husband.'* He had written so before., he knew, and he had not changed, but something indescribable had gone out of the letters now — audlnezkaew.it. The day he ca,mehome, Inez longed inexpressibly to be alone. r She had not. slept ^.11 night, and Hetty saw hQw'jpaleshe was 'when the Bisterspet at break fast, for she came down now as usual. The weather was dull and cheerless, a little drizzle had begun, blotting out even the outlines of the opposite houses ; only the fire . looked cheerful and blazed away as if bent on disregardihg^th'e effects of the atmosphere. ' You look tired, dear ! What will Basil say to me?' said Hetty. ??-- . ?' / 'Packing up aud putting aways^re tiring,'.' was the excuse. 'You must do nothing'1 this morning. 1*11 finish - off.' ! ?' ? -:;' ' ? ' '???-??? But it is not easy to do nothing when the mind is feveriphly , aptive and continually oil. the stretch. Inez was now living a strange artificial life— she called it her probation— and fahefsaid to herself if she were brave and courageous* sh'e'woiUd'cbme out of it just as one reaches the, .end; . off even, a long black tunnel, and then the sunshine would appear as something more beautiful than ever before. At 12 oMock the cab drewivp and Inez ran down stairs. There was something almost unearthly about her beauty now. She appeared so unconscious' of it, aud her eyes-*had a strange expression of appeal and yearning} which-Basil might have seen had his. mind not been utterly taken up with something else. * This time, perhaps because of the uupoetical hour or because of the unexpected result, of .many ? thoughts, Basil only hastily kissed his wife and began; at once to look after his possessions. Then Hetty came down and they had all to iunch before start ing. These proceedings were so ordinary, jo matter of-fact, that it seemed absurd 'to suspect any tragedy of life. ??????? ? When* 'everything was ready ' there' were five minutes nto spare before starting. Hetty had con siderately ileft the two alone, little guessing that they were glad of her presence. They had neither of them yet faced this new life ; the shadow was still between them whether, they believed or dis believed in ghoBts. - . ? - '* Oh, Inez, dear; I want you to know before I tell my mother,' said Basil suddenly. 'To know?' ? ? -\ ' That I have sent in my resignation; I have thrown up the work. ? It's not as if you would ever requiremoney. Your grandfather has eo amply pro vided £or yout' ..-??? ?. The' pale i cheeks became crimson. This was the first decided-step Basil had taken because of that. 'Oh; Basil; but you liked it so much— we likedit''-, . - ;? . ' No— I — I. don't seem to care about it much. With my allowance and your income there is really no need to work so hard.' ? ' But you iike-the work— it is good to work.' . -. .- She spokenow as a parent might to her unwise child. : She 'had such a high sense of the blessedness of work. Baal could not be happy.: If he were-: — '-. Thexab drove up' to the .door — it was the one Inez had ordered. There was a 'sound of the maid's foot - ? steps bringing down the luggage— all ordinary sounds : that made life joyous where.there is happiness within ? the home; Inez felt hurtat Basil's having taken this step without consulting her— hurt; too, at the mention of her income apart from his, but «he bit her lip to prevent herself Baying this. ' Work is good of course. I shall find something else, but the old groove was too difficult for me. Don't you understand that one must lay new foun- . dation8 ? ? It's more than human strength can do— to keep on arbefore.' ' I thought you were strong,' she said. She did not mean to be galling, but this remark roused the devil in Basil's breast. Perhaps evil, had not 'had its right share of temptation in his character; there had not been enough, of the devil in him to fight the Devil. ; . but now the strong man felt shaken by this new power of passionate anger -against the wife he loves bo much; the woman-he had married for love, and for nothing eke. ??...??' ? ' No, I am not strong. :. I have to learn that les son,' hesaid angrily. --? ' . :? 'The tab is~atithe door, ?ma'am,'- said thenaat maid, and the next -period of time became a blank to ?. both of them, only they knew they were out in a storm, a.storni which has no equal In the physical world, tiah storm of angry fjassion lashing itself with fury against the being which is nearest to our Life. -? : .- All the 'while Hetty was as an '.angel, forcing a silence upon them and tilling up the empty space with gentle nothings, the soft nothings which fil) up hideous- spaces of life, and -whose authors are die - guised- blessings.: ...?.-?_?..?;., . - _ .. - .

It was only when the others had retired that Basil' knocked softly at his 'mother's door. ' Come into the library, mother ; the fire is alight and we can haVe a chat,'' he said. '???-? , All before this had been merely surface talk. Her 'mother's heart bounded with joy. ? . *' Won't Inez be sitting up?' she saidj trying to 1 be fair 'to the young wife, who certainly looked ill and who spoke so little. - ? ? ; 'Oh,' no. She won't wait Cor me.' Mary could not tell why or wherefore, but she knew as they sat by the fire that her boy was more hers uga'in than he had been since his marriage. He had come home, and ahe was again first, with him. Strange perversity of .the human heart ! .Instead of experiencing the 'intense joj 'she had expected to. feel, her heart gave a throb of pain. D0. this joy for her mean pain for Basil? Then her joy was paid for too highly ; she must not accept it ; ' she must of her \- own free will choose the second plan against which she had previously -co strangely, rebelled. With her highly sensitive conscience ehe said to herself : ' Suppose thiaahould be my punishment. Suppose God should teach me any sin in this way,' and she shuddered at the new perspective. ? ? Basil felt almost young again sifting there by his mother.- The familiar room with its books and its cheerful old fashionedness belonged to the past life, n?t to this black nightmare perio I of existenca.

ChrUtmas Eve was a day full of. business and ex 'citemeht for any woman who was the head of a household.- Hetty too was claimed by various J 'friends and for church decorations. I^ater on the . , girls at. the Deanery came to carry off their friends . fora family gathering. A married friend, seemed . in their eyes, quite a r-ava avis. They had admired .Inez so much' before her marriage, and now they wanted to see if she were changed. ' ?' She looks ill. Then, she is so quiet. She always was quiet. She doesn't talk much about her husband ? ' These were some of the comments they made. Hetty, on the contrary, had grown years younger, and she was merrier. - Life was now for her free as aft, though, of cour»e,:like other mortals, she bad her . hours of regret. One of these swept over her as she and Inez came out of the Deanery at 7 o'clock on Christmas Eve. They were raising the bells; jjre-. sehtly the joyous peals would scatter far and wide , the news—' Peace on earth, peace on' earthj good will towards man.' . . - .. ' ' Inez, dear, do you hear the bid bells ? We must stop aud hear the peal begin. What a lovely night ; there is only a little fog.

It is the best, the highest, ' duty left to give pleasure to those, we love.' ;Hetty went up to the front door, her arm still in- - that of Inez. Their footsteps sounded ghostly, forjno one was in the Close, the tide of life having, all flowed towards High-street, where the shops were so gay. Here only a lamp burnt dimly, and ' the bare branches swayed rhythmically, as if in sympathy with the life and joy of Christmas folk. The hell sounded hollow' and jarring, but suddenly, as they waited, the whole, peal struck up and the beautiful bells Bent their various' notes far and wide in niad.joy and exuberant exaltation. They were alive, for now else could they speak so passionately. They searched all the hearts of the passers-by and mingled with their joy 6 and sorrows, and flung down the challenge to their faith or uii faith. .' ' \ ' ?? ' Oh! ' exclaimed Hetty, enraptured, 'is it not lovely ?' ' - At that moment the old charwoman opened the door, and like a ghost stared at the visitors. ' O Lor, Miss Hetty, it's you. Come in, do, but there's only my bit of fire in the house.' As she shut the door, her guttering tallow candle made hideous efforts 1o light. up the gloomy, empty pas sage. ? ' I wanted to hear the bells from the old place,' slid Hetty. ?:??? ' It's a poor place now for a bride. Why, Mrs. Whitewood, you dp look sadly, and this house isn't cheerful as. when it was full. The folk talk of ghosts, but I tell them it's rats. A caretaker can't believe _all that, rubbish; can she, Miss? It wouldn't do. : But the other night I could a-swom I heard steps in this passage, aud someone falling.' -.r ' It was foolish— he ? ' Inez finished to her . self, ' he never fell.' .
