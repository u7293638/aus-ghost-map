BALLARAT. (FROM OUR OWN CORRESPONDENT.) THURSDAY EVENING. Owing to the Dowling Forest races to-day the Corner was deserted, and scarcely any business was done. The only sales reported were Black Horse United at £4 10s and South Birthday at 8s , 7s , 9s There was no change worth noting in any other stock Olio Black Horse United Company have declared another dividend of 3s , payable next week 'The Trunk Lead Company. Haddon, have also declared another dividend oils The misunderstanding between Mr Bannister and the Executive Committee of the Juvenile Industrial Exhibition was the subject of discussion last night by the committee, the result being that, while the committee were of opinion that Mr Bannister had made statements which he believed to be true at the time, there was really no foundation for them As to the reduction of the fares for excursionists, that had never been authorised by the committee, although both Mr Bannister and the chairman asserted that they believed the reduction had been authorised verbally-but no one could recollect who the proposer or seconder was However, as Mr Bannister had erred in this respect and had made several arrangements with outlying districts at what he supposed to be authorised reduced fares, the committee, rather than repudiate his acts, confirmed them, but ducted in all future cases that the original prices should be adhered to Mr Bannister expressed regret that the misunderstanding should have occurred, and that he should have committed the error he did, but assured the committee he had been solely guided in his nets in the best interests of the Exhibition-an assurance which was quite unnecessary, as the committee well know the great amount of enthusiasm he has shown, and the immense efforts he has made to carry the project through successfully A vote to that effect was passed to Mr Bannister He stated to the committee that while in Melbourne that day he had seen a large number of the gentlemen who had taken an interest in pro motingthese excursion trains, and they had all Bgrecdto nay the rates (6d for juveniles, and la foradults)onginallyfixedbythecommittee, and he hoped there would be no more trouble over the matter, but that all would work to gether to make the Exhibition a success The children from Hawthorn, Collingwood, and Fitzroy would be in Ballarat on Friday, Saturday and Monday next respectively, and the Chief Secretary had promised to be present on the following Wednesday Mr Berry had asked him to invite His Excellency to be present also, which invitation he had no doubt would be accepted but it would be accepted only on the ground that the Vice I regal visit was to be a strictly private one, entirely divested of any public ceremony The complaint of Mr James Bull against a J female teacher at the state school No 33, for that she barbarously punished his son, by keeping him confined in a cellar under the floor of the school from 3 o'clock on Tuesday afternoon till 9 o'clock the same night, was inquired into to-day by the chairman and the correspondent of the city board of advice, before Mr Armstrong, the head teacher, and, like most of these cases, it was found to have been grossly exaggerated and misrepresented So far from the place of confinement having been a cellar, it is not even under the floor of the school, it is a recess under the raised Beats The boy was sent there for some five or ten minutes just before the close of the school, and the teachers, in the hurry of of closing, forgot all about him This treatment of boys, Mr Bull said, was common Mr Armstrong and his assistants said it was only the second case on record at the school, and Mr Armstrong said it was entirely opposed to his wishes Mr Bull complained that the teachers frightened the children by telling them that ghosts and devils dwelt in the recess The teachers positively deny that anything of the kind was ever said The female teacher stated that as soon as she heard of the result of her forgetfulness she at once went to Mr Bull to explain to him how it occurred, and to express her regret for it, but he met her only with coarse abuse, vile language, and direct insults, and would not listen to reason Mr Armstrong also waited on Mr Bull to assure him that the confinement of his body up to 9 o'clock at night was never intended as a punishment, and that the teacher had forgotten that she had placed him there, but Mr Bull did not behave with ordinary civility to him either He seemed determined to have revenge in some shape or other Mr Bull did not attend the inquiry, but sent his wife to do duty for him, a fact that did not escape the attention of the members of the board of advice, as be Bent no apology for his non attendance Mrs Bull, on being asked if she had anything to state further than had been elucidated replied that she had understood her boy had been put up the chimney, and the boy, being called in, was asked if it was true he had ever been put up the chimney He said at once "No" Mrs Bull said, except the present case, she never had any occasion to be dissatisfied with the treatment of her child Mr Armstrong told the board of advice that, owing to the boy being apparently of weak intellect, and very dull, he had taken special care of him himself, and had directed his assistants to do the same he was quite sure that no one could regret the forgetful ness of the assistant in this matter more than she did herself The members of the board of advice seem to be perfectly satisfied that the confinement for so long a time was never intended as a punishment, but arose from the forgetfulness of the teacher that the statements put forward by Mr Bull were mostly erroneous, and that his conduct seemed to be marked by a spirit of vindictiveness, which the facts did not warrant It is likely that their report will be sent to the department, whatever ltmay be The farm of the late Mr John Sharkey, at Bungaree, consisting of 320 acres of fine land, realised the great price at auction yesterday of £11 per acre. The somewhat mysterious death of an old man named William Anderson, farmer at Bungaree, formed the subject of a magisterial inquiry yesterday before Mr Bacchus, J V It is alleged that in going home with his wife on Monday night he must have been the worse for liquor, and have fallen out of the cart and broken his neck The result of the inquiry was that death was the result of accident
