THE MUNDOORAN MURDER. A CORiREsPONDEN to the Empire, writing from Gulgong, on the 30th December, says:- 'On the 13th November the skeleton of a woman supposed to have been murdered near Mundooran was brought into. Gulgong. On the following day the dis trict coroner T. A. Browne,;Esq., held an inquiry, when the following depositions -weretaken. They were not.piablishid on uibhicgrounds : Miles:Burns deposed; I am sergeant of police, stationed at Mundooran. On Thursday, 7th December I went to a mountain close to a place called Bidden, in company with a young man named Richardson. We then went to a cave in the side of a mountain, and in the cave I saw a human skull. I went round to the other side of the cave where I saw' li& maii bones, On Suinday, 10th December, I went there again in company with several men, and I, pyt the bones in, a, box. When I got there, there was C. W. King with the bones. There was a quantity of stones placed upon the clot thing and bones. *The cave where the .bones weret foundwas about sixteen feet long"."The body ;I believe, .had been placed across tliev :.e' I arrive at that: conclusion because 1 observed the 'hand-s were' oaonoside 6f the ca're and the fedt on the ether Thi cave is, open': at one end. ,;,There is a crevice at one end; where I believe the body to ha ve been put in. Thif has been filled up with loose stones.. We had to omemove these beforie the body could be got out The cave isveriy low, in'the'iiddlil and narrow at theend where the bones wvere ,I brought the bones to `the police campGulgonig.

The boties were thode'of 'a eia'Ieo of: full age, andminost of 'them disjointed. 'There was clothing attached1.' I discovered portions of ciemis& istays, 'petticoat, and'colou\ l print dress round the legs. .A stockitig almost complete was upon one' leg with an elastic garter fastened..' The boots were, elastic sides and much worn. There was a large hole over: the left eyebrow.

Froni the ogeneral 'appearanco, of the f acture I am of opinionf tbiatit took' place - shot tly;,befoiro death. On the .parietal bone of the left sido and its in ferior part there wais a fiacture similar in chianactor, but soinewvhat smaller. Either of these. wounds- would have caused death. The right hand wis cleuched and the last joint of the middle ;finge i sing. Friom the appearance, this was re' nsoved immediatoly aftert'death, or-at the moment of -death.
