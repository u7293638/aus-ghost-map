[?] At St. Andrew's Cathedral, during the Exhibition season, choral services will be held on Mondays, Thursdays, and Fridays, at 7 o'clock in the evening. His Excellency the Governor, accompanied by the Colonial Secretary, on Tuesday, visited the Government Printing Office. Ok Saturday afternoon a very pleasant and success * . ? ? ? j a ? ^ ? ? i ? t*_j ? T- ? 1 ? lul picnic was given at oanunugua.ni, ooiauy r-ay, uy the members of the German Club to the officers of H.I.M.S. Bismarck, now in this port. We learn ths.t in future when the mails received by Use steamers of the San Francisco, Suez, and Torres Straits services are ready for delivery to the public from the General Post Office, a flag will be hoisted on the building, bearing in addition to the letter ' D,' the distinguishing flag of the service. Mb. James Campbell, who for many years carried on business in Morpeth and represented the constitu ency for several years in the Legislative Assembly, died suddenly on Tuesday night at hie residence in the township of Robertson, in the Wingecarribbee district* The immediate cause of death is said to have been fatty degeneration of the heart. Ok Monday evening his Excellency the Governor, Lord Augustus Loftus, entertained the undermentioned at dinner at Government House-.— Mr. and Mrs. Des V/niiT. Tnni and Ladv PhiDDs. Commodore and Mrs. Wilson, Colonel Halketfc, Mr. and Mrs. Labertouche and daughters, Lieutenant Loftus, Mr. Bloxsome, and the following officers of H.M.S. Wolverene: Lieu tenant Matchwin, Lieutenant Corbett, Mr. Keppell, and Mr. Garbett. It is gratifying to observe that the trustees of the National Park have got into harness, and that the neceeary steps are being taken to define the boundaries prior to enclosing the people's domain. The park, however, can not be of much value to the public until means of access to it are provided. A railway to it might have the great advantage of adding new suburbs to Sydney, and would incidentally make provision for a large population now badly off in the matter of com munication. At a meeting of the committee of the New South Wales Cricket Association held on Monday at Tattereall's Hotel — Mr. R. Teece in the chair — Messrs. Murdoch, Gibson, and C. Bannerman were appointed as a selection committee to pick the New South Wales eleven in the approaching intercolonial match. Mr. Murdoch was also appointed to represent the associa tion in selecting the Australian team, in conjunction with a representative to be nominated by the Victorian Association, and a third person, who is to act in the capacity of referee. The inquest on the fire at Munro's confectioner's hop, situated at 477, George- street South, which was postponed from last week, was held at the City Coroner's office, and concluded on Wednesday morning, when the jury returned a verdict to the effect that the premises were wilfully 6et on fire by some person or persons unknown. The jury added, 'We are of opinion that the declaration made by Alexander Munro, before a magistrate, as to the value of his stock at the time of the fire, is totally at variance with the evidence adduced before us.' His Worship the Mayor, accompanied by the aldermen and some of the principal officers of the City Council, paid an official visit to H. I. G. M. S. Bismarck, on the 25th ultimo. The vessel was profusely decorated with bunting on the occasion, and the visitors were received at the gangway by Captain Deinhard and his officers and a guard of honour. After an inspection of the vessel throughout, Captain Deinhard hospitably entertained his Worship and Ms party in the main saloon, and expressed the pleasure he felt in receiving the .city representatives. On Tuesday evening, a meeting on the educational question was held in the Public Hall, St, Leonards, presided over by Mr. G. Lucas. Resolutions were passed affirming that the Public Schools Act should be amended by withdrawing from the Council of Educa tion power to certify new Denominational schools, that the Ssripture lessons should bo retained, and that education should be compulsory and free. The Revds. Dr. Steel, J. C. Kirby, C. Waters, and Mr. Cameron, M.L.A., were among the speakers. We have been requested to draw attention to the fact that the Australian Fox-terrier Club, which was established in Melbourne about two years ago, will hold its second show of fox-terriers, by permission of the committee of the National Agricultural Society of Victoria, at the society s annual show, bt. Kilda Jioad, Melbourne, on the 5th, 6th, and 7th of Novem ber next. The club, although formed in Melbourne, has already several Sydney members, and as the entries are only open to members of the club, and they close on the 25th instant, early application will be necessary. Fubtheh arrangements have been made by the Rail way Department for the convenience of visitors from the country to the Exhibition. The excursion tickets for use in the mail trains have hitherto been confined to persons living remote from the railway, it being con sidered that as they must arrive by the mail CDacb.es, often after long and toilsome journeys, they had i a preferent claim to the limited accommodation at . the disposal of the authorities. Whether from shearing or the badness of the roads, there has not been much j passenger traffic from the far interior, and the depart ment has therefore determined to make the mail trains available to the whole public by excursion tickets to the extent of the accommodation at command. A meeting of ex-scholars of Christ's Hospital, London (called by advertisement), took place at Wil liains s .aieiropoman uotei, jvmg-sireei, on ju.onu»jr evening. The proceedings for the most part were of a conversational character, having the twofold object of introducing new members and increasing, by subscrip tions, the f uiids of the Australian Benevolent Society of Blues. Although the meeting was well advertised, only a few of those concerned attended, and it stands adjourned until the 13th instant, when it is hoped there will be a full attendance. The business on that occa sion will be for the nomination of a trustee and other office-bearers for the year 1879-80, and the revision of the society's rules will betaken into consideration. The Eidge Park (s.), from Adelaide, arrived early Monday on morning, and amongst her passengers were II miners, under contract to work at the Waratah Coal Company's mine, Newcastle. In order that the men should not be tampered with by the representatives of the Miners' Association, arrangements were made for the transhipment of the men at Sydney Heads and their conveyance to their destination. Accordingly, the Waratah ? (s.) was waiting the arrival or the Ridge Park. She received the miners at Sydney Heads, and steamed to Newcastle. We learn by telegraph that on their arrival at Newcastle the men were at once conveyed to the company's works and that the number now employed thereat is 110. The weekly meeting of the Metropolitan Transit Commissioners was held on 26th ultimo at the offices in Phillip-street. There were present — His Worship the Mayor (chairman), Mr. Chapman, and Mr. -E. Fosbery, and the usual routine business was transacted. The only extraordinary episode was the attendance of a deputation of cabmen who, on behalf of the members of that vocation, objected to some pro posed innovations in the traffic regulations. First and most important is the system by which a cabman is required to proffer to every fare a printed slip showing the fare rates and regulations under which he works ; but no tenable argument against this was brought. They next objected to the regulation touching the vehicles they provide as substitutes in case of accident to their cabs ; but on this point it appeared that there had been some misapprehension, and that the rule made by the Commissioners was a perfectly fair one. We noticed a few days ago a constitutional question that had been raised in the Assembly of Queensland, where a bill to amend the Bills or Exchange Act had passed from the Council to the Asembly, but had been challenged there by an objection, which implied that trade bills could not be introduced in the Upper House. The objection was founded on a standing order of the House of Commons, by which, as the Speaker was dis posed to think, the case was governed. A decision, however, was not immediately given ; and after further inquiry it has been found that in England trade bills are initiated in the House of Lords and passed by the House of Commons, notwithstanding the standing order. The bill has therefore been allowed to pass. It might have been allowed to pass without any demur if there had only been a candid acknowledgment of the fact that there is nothing in the Constitution Act to pre vent its passing, or to make the treatment of trade b^ differ from that of any other class of measures mo bills excepted. ' n^ It will be well for ladies who visit the Garri Palace to guard their pockets from being picked ?n best way for them to do this is to leave at home in m? 6 custody all their valuables, except those they think d sirableto be worn for personal adornment On Wednesda morning a man named Palmer, who is well known to to police of South Australia, and a man named Wilson, we sentenced to six months' hard labour for being in th! Garden Palace with intent to commit a felony. Deteciiv J. Camphin arrested the prisoners. He said that, from information he had received, he kept his eye'unon them, and before long saw them fumbling with ladies' dresEee. He saw Palmer put one of his hands into the pocket of a lady's dress, but without obtaining any thing. Detective Doyle, of Adelaide, was present to say something as to Palmer's character, but the Bench held that his evidence was not required. A few days ago his Worship the Mayor paid an official visit to the German man-of-war ship Bismarck and on Tuesday, at 11 a.m., the captain and officers of that vessel returned his visit. The tower of the Town Hall was gaily decked with flags, conspicuous among them being the Union Jack and the red, -white, and black banner of Germany, and this little compliment seemed to please the visitors very much. They were conducted over the building, shown, the great hall, and finally taken to the Mayor's room, where a light refection had been laid. The Mayor, in a few happy remarks, proposed the healths of Captain Dein hardt and the officers of the Bismarck, and Captain Deinhardt, after acknowledging the toast and expressing delight at the hospitality accorded to his officers and himself here, gave the toast of the Mayor and alder men of Sydney. His Worship briefly responded, and after a little chat the visitors made their adieux. To morrow his Worship the Mayor will pay an official visit to the Austrian warship Heligoland, to give its captain and officers a formal welcome to Sydney. To the general public it may be a matter of surprise that so much clean water is allowed to run to waste, as is to be seen flowing from the tunnel along College etreet. This, water is, however, only the drainings from the sides and top of the tunnel, the tunnel end being closed for repairs. During the late rains it be came evident that a serious leak existed, and that much damage as well as loss of water might arise unless a remedy was applied. A dam was thrown round the mouth of the tunnel, and the masonry uncovered, when it was found that a piece of ironbark had been used as a stone in the wall, and the pressure from behind had thrust it into the tunnel, causing it to leak. The whole was then taken down, and is being rebuilt in cement, at a coEt to the Corporation of over £200. The water now flowing down College-street has a certain amount of interest attaching to it, as in an account of the boring of the tunnel by the convicts, under Mr. Busby's superintendence, it is mentioned that ' the city ob tained a very tolerable supply of water from the drip pings of the sides and top of the tunnel, long before it had pierced to the Lachlan swamps.' The Btream now running is identical with that referred to. The drawing for the prizes offered by the Sydney United Omnibus Company in connection with their butt-ticket system took place yesterday morning, at the company's office, in King-street. The tickets from which the butts had been taken, numbering one and a-quarter million, were placed in a revolving barrel, the dimensions of 'which were five feet by four feet six inches, and the barrel was turned frequently so as to have the tickets well mixed. The drawing was done by his Worship the Mayor (llr. C. J. Roberts), 11 tickets being taken by him from the barrel, which was revolved after each ticket was drawn, and as the tickets were taken the prizes were allotted. The following is the list of the winning numbers — A76836O, £20; A861816, £10; A017415, £5 ; A193892, £5'; A173354, £2 ; A445587, £2, A676855, £2j A617710, £1 ; A291851, £1; A874142 £1 ; A980563, £1. Un Thursday some of the prizes were claimed. The £20 prize has fallen to Mr. Thomas M'Farlane, manufacturing jeweller, 147, Pitt-street. A £2 prize has been won by J. Blundell, Lambert-street, Camperdown ; and £1 by John Cobb, locomotive foreman Government railways. The International Exhibition may certainly be termed a ' Peace Congress.' It is gratifying to notice the amicable feeling which unites all nations on our shores. A few days ago we chronicled the reunion on board the German frigate Bismarck. On Saturday evening Captain Mathieu, in return for Captain Deinbardt's soiree, entertained that gallant officer and staff at a dinner on board the Rhin. Com modore Wilson, Commander Bridge, the captain of the Austrian troop-ship Heligoland, the Commissioner for Austria, the French Consul, the Commander and officers of the Beautemps Beaupre, and several other distinguished guests, responded to Captain Mathieu s invitation, and assisted him to do the honours of bis hospitable ship to the guests of the evening. The chef de cuisine of the Rhin prepared one of his most exquisite menus. At the close of the repast, Hie following toasts were proposed :— ' The Sovereigns and Naval Officers whose flags fly at the present moment over the waters at Port Jackson.' Commodore Wilson, in responding, proposed Captain Matliieu's health, ana thanked him for the cordiality of the eutertainieut. About 3 o'clock, on Saturday afternoon, as the 6teamer Woniora was coming up the harbour, the cap tain saw a boat floating bottom up off Bradley s am. He went and picked it up, righted it, and found w a the sail was set, and fast. There were in the boat wo ladies' hats, bags containing fruit and other article., leading to the belief that a party had been out picnic ing. The Woniora then towed the boat up to Joan son's Bay, where the captain had it moored. The same night he reported the matter to the Water Police, ana a boat's crew was dispatched to make inquiries, i-m ascertained that a party of three ladies and four g tlemen had been out boating, and that the w had been capsized off Bradley's Head.

I Ok Tuesday a friendly rawing match took place I ktween men of the German ship Bismarck and men I of H.M. S, Wolverene, in cutters. The contest excited I a considerable amount of interest, not alone amongst I tie various war ships now in harbour, but also I amongst people on shore who became acquainted I mth what was going on, and assembled in considerable I numbers on the points overlooking the course of the I boats. The cutter of the Wolverene was manned by a I crew of ten, including Mr. Banyard, the coxswain, I while the Bismarck was represented by a crew of twelve. I The race was for £24, and the course was from Farm I Cove, around the City of Sydney (lying in Lavender I Bay), around Pinchgut, back and around the City of I Sydney again, and back to Farm Cove. The boats got I away well together, but unfortunately one of the Wol I verene's crew, named Henry Tuffnell, snapped his oar I at the start, and as there were no spare oars in the I boat, and he could render his shipmates no help, in I fiat spirit which bas often characterised a British I man-of-war's man, he determined that he would be no I obstruction to them, and at once jumped overboard, I thus leaving a crew of only nine British seamen I ijaimt the dozen Germans. Notwithstanding this I disadvantage, however, the Wolverene's cutter went ? ahead, gradually gaining on her competitor from the ? start, and coming in a winner by about twelve lengths. I The plucky fellow who jumped overboard from the I 'Wolverene's cutter, was picked up by a waterman's I tet- Y ? One of the new tramway motors was running with I me of the new American cars all Sunday last, ? until a late hour at night. The car was largely ? patronised, and -with the engine attracted as much ? attention as it has on a week day.

A labge number of members of the Australian Mutual Provident Society was present at the special meeting, in the new head offices, Pitt-street, for the pur pose of receiving the report of the sixth .quinquennial investigation of the affairs and profits of the society. The Hon. John Smith, C.M.G., M.L.C., presided. The whole of the directors were present, and also Mr. Arthur S. King, of the local board of directors in Melbourne. The chairman gave an ample review of the actuary's report, explaining many parts of it, and pointing to interesting cases in the history of the society, in which its prosperity had afforded to members extraordinary advantages. He showed that in thirty years the Mutual Provident had outstripped all kindred societies in the amount of new business, and that only two of the British offices excelled it in total annual revenue — namely, the Stan dard and Scottish Widows' Fund. The meeting was enthusiastic in its approbation of the 6tate of the society's affairs and of the report. Having recorded its thanks to the chairman and directors for their un tiring exertions in the interests of the society, and also to the actuary and officers generally (whose ser vices it was intended to recognize by bonus), the meet ing almost by acclamation passed a resolution request ing the directors to place the sum of £1000 at the disposal of the Hon. John Smith, as a recognition by his fellow members of the valuable services he had long rendered to the society. Some of the bonus certificates have been issued and the whole will be forwarded to members in the course of the present week. They set forth only the reversionary value, but a table accom panies each certificate, by which the cash value can be estimated. Uxdee date of September 30, our Groulburn Biver correspondent writes : — Lecture : Last night the Rev. J. S. Laing, of Muswellbrook, delivered a lecture in the Denman School of Arts ; subject, ' Central Africa.' Mr. W. F. Parker, P.M., occupied the chair. The lecture was very interesting as well as instructive. The rev. lecturer treated his subject in a most able manner, giving a graphic sketch of the explorations and discoveries of Captain Burton, Captain Speke, Livingstone, and Stanley. The audience (a large one) appeared highly [satisfied, 6howing their approval in the usual manner. I hope we may soon have the pleasure of again hearing the Rev. Mr. Laing at Den man. To-morrow night he lectures in Muswellbrook on the education question. — Accident: A lad, aged about eight years, son of Mr. Meyers, of Sandy Hollow, met with an' accident last week. It appears that while playing with an axe he chopped two of his toes off, besides inflicting a terrible gash on his big toe. The poor little fellow came running home to his mother, bringing two of his toes in his hand. I hear that under Dr. Grigeon he is doiug well. — The Weather and Crops : Once more we are getting fine weather, which, is a great blessing after the heavy rains we had of late. The country is looking beautiful, grass and herbage in abundance. But I am very sorry to say that the farmers' plague, the dreaded rust, has again made its appearance in this locality, several paddocks having already turned quite red. It is very dis couraging to agriculturists, after spending their time and money in preparing the land, sowing, &c;, and just when there is promise of a good return for their labour the rust appears, and in a few days all hope of a crop is at an end. For the last 16 years every wet season we have had the rust in this district ; still, farmers always hope for better next year — hope that some remedy may be discovered to prevent rust. A deputation, consisting of Aldermen Larkin, MGrath, Bennett, Sparkes, and Mr. Pidcock, of the borough of Camperdown, was introduced to the Colo nial Secretary, the Hon. Sir Henry Parkes, on Tuesday, by Mr. John Lucas, M.L.A. The interview had re ference to the Missenden Road. It appeared from the statement of Mr. Lucas that when Camperdown was incorporated the borough was made to include within its boundary the University and affiliated colleges, which were assessed at £104 a year. Under the Muni cipalities Act, which passed subsequently, the University and colleges were excluded from the borough, and thus ihe borough lost the revenue referred to. It was pointed out that this road is a thoroughfare from the Pyrmont Bridge Road, crosses the Parramatta Road, and over it are carried heavy loads of stone for New town, Enmore, and neighbouring localities. On this account it cost as much to keep in repair as was re quired for the repair of the remainder of the streets of the borough. Mr. Lucas stated that it had cost £2000 within the last few years ; whilst the municipality (whose total revenue from assessment was only about £800 a year) was deprived of rates from one side of the road. From 18(38 to 1S79 the loss of revenue by the exclusion of the University and colleges from the borough was £1638, which, with interest at the rate of 5 per cent, for half the period, would bring the loss to £2032. He suggested that it should be ascertained by some competent person how much the borough was entitled to in the way of compensation. Sir Henry Parkes pro mised to have the matter investigated as soon as was possible, and to consult his colleagues about it. The case, he said, had some novel features, and he should not wish to act without consultation and de liberation on the subject. As he understood it, the borough of Camperdown did not wish the University and colleges to go scot-free. Mr. Lucas explained that if the Government relieved them from assessment, the Government ehould compensate the borough. Thank ing the Colonial Secretary for his courtesy, the depu tation retired. Among ihe many useful and elegant exhibits at the Garden Palace may be mentioned the case shown by Messrs. Chapman, Sous, and Co., of Charterhouso-ba.ilJing-s, Aldersgate, London, through their agents, Messrs. Moss and Co., of Pitt-street, in this city. Chief among the articles in the case is a patent liqueur frame, designated the ' Jani tor,' and the name is most appropriate. The 'Janitor'' carefully guards the liquors contained in. four handsome cut-glass bottles — and supplies a want that has been long felt. The great objection experienced in the use of ordinary liquor frames has been the lack of a plan for securing the potent contents of bottles containing wines, spirits, liqueurs, or cordials. It is well-known by housekeepers that the liquors in these bottles are apt to gradually and mysteriously disappear. A lady housekeeper once marked her liqueur bottles daily, and noted the 'evaporation' with 'surprise, as it was arranged that none of the contents should be drunk by the family. Surreptitiously all the liquor vanished, and not one of the servants could explain the mystery ! There will be no disappearance or 'evaporation' where the 'Janitor' is used. It is simple in design, and is thus described by the manufacturers : — Each stand is fitted with four bottles, having a handle in the centre, from which ex tend four arms, -with a disc at the end of each, which, when locked, fits over the tops of the bottles, thus fixing them in such a way that it is a perfect impossibility to remove them from the stand until they are unlocked, which is accom plished by simply turning the key in the usual way, and he handle, by means of a spring, then partially revolves, and the bottles arc released. The system of locking is equally simple, the lock being a spring one ; by turning the handle back to its original posi tion, it catches in the lock, and is thus secured. The '* Janitor ' in Coromandel, walnut, or olive wood, with gilt or nickel corners, is a handsome sideboard ornament, and the purchaser soon saves the first outlay. Bottles contain ing perfume, &c.;, can be secured in the same manner. Another invention of Messrs. Chapman, Sons, and Co., in cluded in the Exhibition cabinet, is the ' Surprise ' sta tionery case, a registered arrangement combining ink bottles and stand, envelope box, drawer for stamps, pen tray, &c.; The tops of the inkstands are moved by means of springs, and the invention is likely to meet with approbation for its handiness and compactness. The lovers of scientific entertainment have, as usual, had a great treat this week in Professor Pepper's lectures at the School of Arts. Everything that this clever exponent of popular science does is well worth witnessing, and he has a clear and plain method of explaining his experiments which makes them additionally attractive. It is possible that, to some persons, his explanations of natural or scientific phenomena may not be so clear as were those by Mr. Severn, whose name will be recollected, but the reason is not hard to find. Professor Pepper assumes a certain amount of knowledge of these matters in his audience, and therefore does not always go down to the elements of physical science. To those who have mastered these elements everything is, however, most interesting ; and even to those who have not, the experi ments themselves should prove as amusing as they are attractive. His last production is the illusion which he calls ' Metempsychosis.' To describe it would be almost impossible, and to explain it would be utterly out of the question, for all who Baw it were equally mystified and de lighted with the sight. When the curtain draws up, the back of the stage is seen to be empty. The Professor's son comes forward, and announces to the audience that he cannot account for his father's absence. Shortly afterwards, in the vacant space at the back of the stage, the firm of the Professor is seen gradually to assume shape out of ' airy nothing,' and there he stands in propria persona; there is no doubt of that, for he walks forward, and takes his place at the front of the stage to commence his portion of the entertainment — a lecture it can scarcely be called, for it consists of a scries of humorous remarks, apt quotations, amusing banter, and useful information, combined, all compressed into small compass, but presented in the most attractive form. The Metempsychosis illusion is certainly one of the mo^t clever things overproduced here, and among the wonderful illusions produced are these: — A basket, filled with oranges, is hung up at the back of the stage. Full in the eight of the audience the fruit is seen to change into pots of marmalade. A pedestal with nothing on it is seen suddenly to bear an empty glass globe, on the top of which is a cat. The cat then vanishes, and the globe is full of water and g;old-fisli. A string of sausages is seen to change, by some occult principle of analysis, into a live dog. Illustrations are given of the Darwinian theory by means of some very amusing changes, but the most wonderful transformation of all is that of the Professor's assistant, Epaminondas, into a charming young lady — Miss Octavia Lane, who, to prove that she is human, and not a spiritual being, comes forward and sings a song very sweetly. Then there is a miraculous growth of flowers upon an empty flower- pot, and the Ghost of Banquo is shown, the illusion in which is perfect, while the Professor's recitation of the speech of Macbeth is given with a great deal of dramatic effect. ?
