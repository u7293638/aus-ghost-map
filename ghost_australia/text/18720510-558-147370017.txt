. A SCOTCH GHOST. . Much uneasiness is at present caused in Edinburgh by a ghost who has appeared, it is stated, in various quarters of the city. Thfi latest information, according to the Edinburgh Courant, has reference to his descent in the open space in front of Holy rood Palace, where he caused much alarm. Tho ghost is described as a very tall figure, draped from heatl to foot in white, the face clear as if covered with a phosphorescent substance, but the features undistinguish able. The apparition has been seen by many people. Sometimes it walks calmly about, but at other times it gives the most terrific jumps. A gentleman of high re spectability, and who is at the head of a well known establishment in Princes street, was mush annoyed the other evening by tho ghost springing from the side of the road in a lonely part of Fountainbridge, aud stand ing right in front of him. The gentleman raised his walking stick in self defence; tho ghost gar/:ed at Mm earnestly for a few seconds, and then at a single bound went off about a. dozen yards along the street, and disappeared liko a Hash of lightning. Some people suppose that an unprincipled poison is merely personating a ghost, but this is a far more uncomfortable view of the matter than the hypethenig that the ghost is genuine; a real ;gbost is trying to the nerves, but nob dangerous; you may poke a walking stick thri mgh a phantom, but a : substantial ghost is a serious nuisance.
