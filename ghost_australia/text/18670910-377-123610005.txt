When the fire was st the foot of (Chancery-lane it came dangerously near those rat-haunted moofs, and the court-yards where lawyere .ghosts pase and eonsult in moonlit nighlts.

The lady who was initiated into Freemasonry was Mrs. St.. Leger, daughter of Lord Doosreile. It was about the year 1739, on the occasion oft ledge being held at Lord Doneraile's house, that hii, daughter soecreted herself in an adjoining room that was then under repair, and havring extracted a brik from a thin wall, heard and saw all that transpired in giving the trst two degrees of Freemasonry. Afterwards beeom ing alarmed at what she had illegally been. witness of, she attempted to mnake her escape tbhrough the lodgeroom, bute was prevented from doing so by the tyler at the door. At first, it is stated, some of thle members were for laying violent hands upon her, but her brother, who happened to be a member of the lodge, interfered, and suggested that she should be initiated and become a member, so that she might be bound to secresy for the future. This was done, and history informs us tlhat her suhsequent life showed that she was deeply imprgsed wath the beauties of Freemasonry, and carried out to the fullest extent the briglhtest jewel which adorns it, and that is charity. lHer hland was always open to the distressed, particu larly to Masons, and site died full of years, amidst the rc?r?elt of all lwho lad the happinees of knowing her.
