A POET'S PRIVILEGE. Mr. Rurtyard Kipling, m his Last Rhyme of True Thomas, whioh appoars In To- day, loaves the see for n while end singB of the glorioue privilegea of the poet. He evidently viewa with little favor the grunting of mere mundane titles to literary men. He takes as his text a pneaagc from a daily paper: oomplnlning of the injustice done to literature in that its leaders are not even knighted, while prominent savants, lawyors, nrtistB and engineers win ennoblement by the Orowh. The King of Scotland seeks True Thomas, the Minstrel, to dub him "a belted knight, And all for the songs ho made. " Tlio old harper spurns the honor : — " And what should X do wi' blazon and bolt— \\\T koop and hold and seizin and fee— And. what should X do wi' page and squire That am a King In my own countrie T " For Isenil East and I send XVest, And X solid far as my will may flee, By dawn and dusk and the drinking rain, And syno my Semilogs return to mo. . " They come wi' news o' the groanin' oartb, They come wi' news o' tho voarin' sea, Wi' word n' Spirit and Ghost and Flesh, And Man, that is between the Three."' Then, after humbling the Kiug, True Thomas makes for him the "triple song," until tho king is a child in his hands. Tho ballad ends thus finely . . " Sloop ye or wake," Trno Thomas said, " That Bit so still, that muse so long, Sleep ye or wake— till the sleep o' death I irow ye'll not forget my song. " I ha' liarplt ye down to the hongos o' hell And up to the throne o' Ood: most hie; I lia' darkened your soul wi' the l.usto' Blood; And— ye— wod— make— a Knight o' mo 1"
