What is this About Gibraltar? THKEK is something inexplicable in the discussion nrhich has been raised with regard to the retention by Great Britian of Gibraltar. We are almost inclined to ask, have any proposals been made, or are negociations in progress upon this matter ? If Earl Russell were . in the Cabinet such an idea might not be preposterous, because be took the opportunity of a revolution in Greece to give up the Ionian Island; and now, while the Spaniards arc in a state of political convulsion, the question is mooted whether Â«ve shall not'surrender to them that mighty fortress rock upon which we have expended millions of money, and down whose slopes English blood has flowed in many a desperate battle. We have defended Gibraltar against four tremendous Beiges; we hare defied itro nations from its heights; we hare crowded its waters in times of war with our Royal and merchant fleetB; it is envied by every other State of Europe; it has been _ improved into an impregnable stronghold and an useful harbour; and why on earth are we to abandon it simply because the sight of our flag is offensive to Spain f If to Spain, why not yield Hong- Kong to conciliate the Chinese Empire; British India, to satisfy the native chiefs; Cerlon, to propitiate the ghosts ot the Kings of Kandy; the Mauritius, as a compliment to France; and Malta, because our presence there is a sort of double insult to Italy and Asia ?
