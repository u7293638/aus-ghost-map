Sub hobart town letter ^B {.orom our own Correspondent.) '^?10 Christmas holidays of 18S0 will long bo ^^Wl in remombrauce by those whoso hopes of ^m interrupted season of enjoyment were; so ?Jely dashed to the ground by the appalling :«ccidenls, particulai-s of which will have reached ;lou by telegram beforo this letter finds spaeo in ?'our columns. Your readers can' moro easily Hmagjne than I cau describe tlie gloom which ?ns east over tho town when the sad wind-up At tlio children's sports in tho Domain became ' Wnown. AVhata scene on such a festive occasion. :-J|'hB, crushed and mangled forms of little jP'itildreu drawn from beneath tho fallen pavilion. I2he cries of rojoicing and innocent glee turned ?to moans of anguish and bitter lamentation. MXha dead and mangled body of the young man, ^tn, luoniont ago so full of lifo and energy. The ^^»we-struck faces of the lookers on. Tho line of ^^M.bs conveying the little sufferers to the ^^?tospital. Al this, I say, can bo more easily ^^Biagined than described. ^^B'X'lie gale which threw down the pavilion was ^^?q severost ever experienced here. Giant ^^Hvbs of trees were torn off like match-wood, ^^^Kuks of three chimneys united were blown ^^^Bf, and vehicles containing passengers capsized ^^^Mf children's toys. Portions of rooting werb ^^Hpped off, and walls and fences thrown down ^^^Bh irresistible force, Tho fruit trees in many I^^H-dens have been literally stripped, and enter ^HPhat street you may, evidence of the destructive } ?Rejects of the gale meets the eye on every hand., Wit is possible that we have not yet heard tho HI last of accidents, as one or two boating exour flj auras .'have not since been heard of. Hj The excursionists to Port Arthur deserved the. H punishment they received. Aware that rough HJ weathor was in store, Captain Oapurn advised Wji.UonL to agree to a trip down channel. But ?llthiij 'they would not hear of, and the captain H| gayoSvay. The after experience of the passen H :^c'rs taught them a lesson which they will not ?^ doubt remombor for a lifetime. The cabin was I crowded to suffocation with ladies drenched I Kifd bedraggled, enduring all tho wretchedness I oflsea sickness, and on deck tho forms were H +ti;Wn from side to side to the danger of lifs H ,-i.ikl limb as the vessel rolled, and the miserable H plssengers wero drenched by the water which HJ continually swept over the side. B /Those who kept indoors during the day, and H vbited the Theatre in tho evening, had the best B ol the. holiday on Boxing Day. The name of J. K a Williamson has become a household word, ?','. Jid whenever we hear the name mentioned wo I ??.??'/?link' of 'Struck Oil' and 'Pinafore.' .. In ?^?nte of tho inclemency of the weather there was HHJ good attendance on the opening night, and I HHjKpectto beo crowded houses 'during tho season. ^Bflesara J. W. Dodge and Oo. have been making HKjctive arrangements which are likely to tnnko ^Wlhe Theatre more than usually attractive for P^lome time to come, .and in' opening with the ¥??? A AVilliamson's they have madp a great , hit. I f ' 'iced hardly say that the performance gave un L -bounded satisfaction, and that Mr' and, Mrs r 'WiUiamson received a very hearty welcome. L The ' ghost' has been at his cowardly , work B| ayain, and really some prompt action should be H taken by the proper authorities to put down a Btiinvctice which has already caused much Hfuuffering and evil. I have no doubt that the V Vxascal will be bowled out some day. and then if f Jhe is not tarred and feathered he will escape his I deserts. ... : ..-'? . : ; .. I His Excellency Sir J. H. Lefroy, Lady Lefroy, I Mid Miss Lefroy attended the , annual gathering I of the Associated Sunday- schools of the dissent I ing bodies, held as usual at the Melville-street I 'Wesloyan Church on the morning of Boxing I Day, and his Excellency took, advantage of tho r occasion to make some practical remarks in his I 1 usual happy stylo upon the importance and j value of the work which Sundny-school teachers 1 are called upon to perform. The interest evinced by Sir J. H. Lefroy and the members of ' his 'family in the social welfare of the people ' whom ho has been called upon to govern, has !^ already made him the most popular Governor we have had for many years past; ??? The interest lie manifests is always shown so unobtrusively, and is so free from anything like patronage.tlmt . lie wins the hearts of the people wherever he i goes. He has repeatedly shown also by acts of L thoughtful, kindness, as .when he sent the K draught boards and:piecesto the old men at the ? Invalid Depot last week, that he is earnest in bv ''uts expressed desire to serve 'the people.' Hi Jtay he remuin long With us is the fervent wisli ^m of many. ''? ?'?'..; ?? :, ?:?'.. ?. . .??.''? ?
