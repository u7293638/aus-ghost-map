The Education of Nervous Children. It is difficult to exaggerate the evil that may be worked upon a nervous child by tho tales of ghosts, robbers, bogies, or policemen, with which many children are continuously indulged. The inculca tion of the precepts of religion also too often becomes the means by which terrifying ideas are implanted in the infant mind, much to the disturbance of that peacefulaess during the hours of rest which is essen tial to its normal development. It is pitiful to k think of the number of children who instead of m dropping into dreamless slumber look forward to m bedtime as a time of terror, bury their faces in the bedclothes, and only when exhausted fall asleep, haunted by 'visions of a constant all-seeing eye, by dread of unending torments for each unforgiven, maybe forgotten, little fault, and by fear of light ning and other natural phenomena which they have been taught are instruments of wrath. From all such thoughts the developing brain should be pro tected. But later on, when education, as it is now understood, begins, the child among whose ancestors neuroses have prevailed requires even more protec tion, for every influence is often brought to bear to disturb his mental equilibrium.
