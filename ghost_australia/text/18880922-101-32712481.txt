DEATH OF A FAMOUS FORTUNE- TELLER. A once famous and even fashionable for- tune-teller, Mother Moreau, has lately died in Paris. She attained the height of no- toriety in the days of the Empire, when she was consulted not only by tho cocottes but also by tho cocodettes, as the society boauties of thc time were called. Her rooms wore usually thronged in the afternoon, when her fashionable customers came to have their fortunes told, or rather to consult her in their affairs of commingled business and pleasure. Madamo Moreau was a skilful cartotnan cienne, and bor masterly manipulation of the cards' must have, enabled her to realise a consid√©rai le income. Just as in ordinary prosaic professional life, Madame Moreau bad formally taken over the premises and practice of an equally prophetic predecessor, Madame Lenormand, who, in her day was a veritable Witch of Endor, and even preceded modern spiritualists in evoking phantoms from the vasty depths of the nether regions, or in enabling customer to have comfortable and profitable talks with the ghosts of their grandmothers. The deceased cartomancienne, who did not profess to dabble in the " Black Art" like her notorious predecessor, and confined herself strictly to the cards, died in ber seventy-first year.
