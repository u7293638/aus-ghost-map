AMUSEMENTS. The "Williamsons repeated their clever perform- nncen in Struck Oil " aud " The Chinese Question " at the Theatre Royal last night, and, as usual, delighted their audience. They will again Jap- pear lo-mcrht. Tho play of " Lisa Eccles" was repeated last even ing at tho Queen's Theatre, when the clover imper sonations of Messrs. Baker and Farron in the prin cipal parts gave great satisfaction. The same pro gramme holds good for to-night. Professor Pepper has certainly hit the popular taste with his startling ghostly illusions ami scien tific experiments. Last night his entertainment in cluded " Fisher's Ghost," K Metempsychosis," "Ancient and Modern Statuary," and other marvels, which sent his audicucc away, after a couple of hours, thoroughly satisfied with the manner in which lliev lmd been amused. Burton's Circus continues to be a favourite place of resort. Last night the programme was an excellent one, and will ho repealed this evening. ' I lie Caramlim Company's concert at the Protestant Ball last evening was well worthy of the clever artistes who comprise it. Solos, duetts, trio?, and glees followed each other in quick succession, and iu almost every instanco loud applause followed. Another concert will lie given to-night.
