READING IN BED. The Globe begins an article with the words - Of course we are all agreed that reading in bed is pernicious.' My dear old Globe (comments Dr Gordon Stables), we are nothing of the sort. By the crimson hood of my tnga, no. If my opinion is wortn a penny piece, then you shall have it, and, to use a somewhat common phrase, I have the courage of my convictions. I am turned 50. I have read in railway carriages, read on the sofa, and read in bed all my life ; I read myself to sleep, or nearly to sleep, every night. Yet my eyesight is splendid. I can read the smallest type without spectacles by the light of the moon or a prisoner's dip. My constitution has not been shattered, and I assure you I have never been burned to d< j ath in bed. Why should you be burned to deat'i in bed, I wonder ? What nonsense Your caudle is on a table by your bedside. If you do drop off, and the candle does burn itself out, what is the harm ? Oh 5 dear, oh, dear, what a lot of old wives there are in the world ! But the truth is, that unless a man is a navvy, a tiller of the soil, or toiler of the deep, and can drop off as soon as his head touches the pillow, it is goad for bis brain health to read in bed. If there is the ghost of a chance of his beginning to think after "lying down, the book or magazine must at once be had recourse to. This ke^ps the mind on an even keel tili tbÂ« waves of sleep begin to waft the soul to dreamland. Let him, just before this, put out the candle, and a good night's rest will be his guerdon. To think in bed is selfmurder ; to read in bed is life. In this advice lie sense and science combined.
