&a; Asmsisg £*ory. 1 Comes from Port Jackson, and it is to the following effect:—It appears that a few nights ago a boat was employed to take some new mattrasses to one of the vessels down the harbour, and while on the journey one of the said mattrasses fell into the water, and at the time was not missed. Some time latter in the evening a second boat was engaged to take an officer over to one of the ships in " Farm Cove," and all going along quietly in the still night, and when some distance from the land the lost mattrasses was pulled against, unknown to the occupants of the boat, completely stopping its progress. The boatman pulled on, but could not go ahead, and on looking around to see the cause the white ends of the mattrass showed themselves rising above the bows of the boat, and the waterman becoming so scared at the sight, plunged into the sea, and made back for the land as fast as ever mail swain, leaving his passenger to shift for himself as best as he could. The passenger, on seeing the boatman leave him so suddenly without anj warning, and thinking something very dreadful was about to happen, at once followed suit and made for the land. We have had more than one sensational ghost story of late recorded in the papers, which, no doubt was the cause of the above. On the boat being picked up the mattrass was also found, and many a good laugh has taken place over the matter.— Tooicoombu Chronicle.
