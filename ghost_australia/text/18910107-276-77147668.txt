A COORONG LEGEND * BEING A SHORT STORY TOLD LONGWAYS. When stars are reflected on Tilley's grey swamp, And luminous fungi light up the old camp - The camp and the home of the heroes of yore, In the days of the ibis and turkey-before Game fled from the sound of the white man's gun, Before the long Salt Creek reflected the sun, When a wide-spreading ring encircled, the moon, Telling that torrents of rain would fall soon, With watery Mars quite close to her rim - When the aky was clear and the the earth was dim, And the hummooks loomed high and the cloudlets were low, And the earthquake seemed rending Earth's bowels below ; And the surf of old Ocean was lashing the shore With huge tidal waves that resembled the Bore When the tide is advancing to old Tsien Tang, Upward repelling the river to Chang. + When the ignis falnus shines to decoy, Without a distinction, man, maiden, or boy, And lure him or her to a grave in the reed: When dlngoes howl and the postman speeds, And Allan, of Broadford, a horse-shoe nails In front of his hut when he hears the mails: Of the sable spectres as midnight nears, Shadowy men with long shadowy spears, Marching along when the bushmen snore, To a shadowy sea on a shadowy shore: 0ver the hummocks and over the strands To where Cantara's neat dwelling-house stands, With its door ever open and cupboard as free To those lost in the scrub or wrecked on the sea, With a " Welcome, ye lost ones" from a kind hearted boss, For gloomy Coorong has a Pope's "Man of Ross:"++ And once a year, as the legend tells, When, as related, a tempest swells, The Tilley Swamp darkies forsake their lone graves, The lubras beating their toms, and the brakes, Each one armed with a shadowy spear To hold their annual corroboree near. § Now, Lucindale hunters who lose your way Beating for game on those hummocks so grey, Never lose sight of the telegraph-posts, For if you fall in with the blackfellows' ghosts Holding corroboree on yonder dark plain You will never get back to see Kingston again, Dark will your doom be and darksome the tale The postman will tell you in the Royal Mail. §§ GRASSIE * Carlyle said that it required as much skill to lengthen a story as to shorten it. \+ When the sea and the river meet at flood tide at Tsien Tang, a tidal bore or wave is raised 40 feet high, in which many Chinese boats are swamped and their crews drowned, but such is the redundancy of population in China that the lost ones are seldom missed or enquired after. ++ The Man of Ross, celebrated by Pope for his hospitality. § The aborigines believed that after death Weering [Charon] would permit them to return to the earth, and hold a corroboree once a year. § § The Royal Mail Hotel, where Host Reid dispenses good tales, trumpeters, and toddy.
