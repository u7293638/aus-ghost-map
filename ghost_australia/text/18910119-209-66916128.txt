RATS. AND THEIR ANTICS. The number of ghost stories end mysterious manifestations that have been traced to the eccentricities of the ordinary house rat,'and the disasters that have been put down to these mis chief loving rodents, is legion. What might have developed into a weird and sensational ghostly recital has been discovered in the storeroom at Swan's Commercial Stores, Bairnsdalo, anld re veals a peculiar forml of amusement of which the rat is apparently passion ately fond. All snight long a peculiar musical creakincg noise may be heard at the storeroom outer door, accompan ied by a whirling buzz anmd regular heats. The cause of this commotion was for some weeks a problem which puzzled many, but by the oxerciao of a considerable amount of patience Mr. Swan's manager was ouentled to solve the mystery. Mr ~1'Dowell was as tonished to see a dozen rate, all appar ently well fed upon the go:,d things available in the storo, leap at regular intervals upon the wheel of a perambu lator which hangs suspended from the ceiling. Each rat would add by his leap to the velocity of the revolving wheel, and after a time six or soves retolutions would be indulged in be fore the next rat took his leap. The wheel in its movement made a peculiar creak, which appeared to lend addi tional delight to the rata' morry-go routnd in mid air. How long this pastime was kept going could not be known, but the rats probably kept it up till daylight each morning, ad journing at intervals, of course, for re freshments. The entertainment is still running, and its " last nights" will probably not he announced until this particular perambulator is re moved for active service out of doors. -" Daily News."
