The locals were completely outmatched in every department of the game. A fair number of spectators aurned. up -to 'witaees the match, :but wig "to 'oth`er attractions` it'wass not - so well attended as anticipated. The visitors were .Messre Heath and Daley and Chrisp and Cox. TLe local team was represented by Messrs Grover and Worrell and Gault and Townsend.
