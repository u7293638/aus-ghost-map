ALL HIS EYE. LIKE a ghost sad and sear He crept ia on us here; Then he sat down and heaved a deep sigh, And a handkerchief blue From his pocket he drew, And brushed a big tear from his eye; Oh, my I It was awful to hear that youth sigh. Next he made a grimace, As he stared in our face, While his lips uttered moan after moan ; Then he started and said, " Oh I I wish I were dead, For the peace of my life it has flown, Ochone! May your artist for ever be blown." Then we said to him, "Youth, Come and tell us the truth, The cause of your grief aud your moan, And why you do say In that horrible way, ' May your artist for ever be blown ;' Don't groan, But tell us the cause of your moan." Then he howled in his chair, And he tugged at his hair, Till we thought he'd have pulled off his head. Then loud rang his cry, " Oh my, 'tis the eye That glares out of Fisher so dread," He said, " And I wish that I slept with the dead, '' For wherever I go That optic will glow, A hideous and horrible spark ; Yes, glow like a coal, In the depths of my soul, And haunt me in daylight and dark ; And mark, That optic will drive me mad, stark." He ceased, and grew white, Then made off in a fright; But he left his caubeen on the floor. When we looked round to see What had startled him, we Saw Fisher's dread eye at 'he door!
