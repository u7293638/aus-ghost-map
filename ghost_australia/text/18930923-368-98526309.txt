SHYiNG HORSES ARE NEAR SIGHTkD, " Why it is that shying in horses sholtid be set down to an ugly disposition I don't know," said a prominent veterioary surgeon, "It must be because horsemen don't know what else to lay it to. The fact is it is seldom met with unless the horse is near sighted, Of all animals the horse is the most gentle, aind even timid. He sees a strange, object, and his susceptible mind magnifies it into a monster that is going to destriy him. A piece of white paper in the roadside at night is a ghost, and an old waggon in the ditch is a dragon. Every horseman knows that if you drive the animal close to the dreadful object the animal cools down at once. It had been unable to discern the object dis tinctly from a distance." ,-.
