BY THE IRG?O OF GIRCUM STANCES. Only n woman's face!. Yes, but m. very striking one. At least, so it appeared to colonel Ferrers as it dawnedi suddenly on his vision. The deep red of her :hair .ivas' f'.the hue that Romney loved to paint l e~ complexion was of that peculiai trans parency which often' accompanies :liir of that particular color.

At last it was se tied that each wivuld adhe're;to tlil oc? view, but -that. her' husbiand; Sir John Lauder,'would call ii order to piut ihers: even-more strongly. "; : =i Later, when Ferrers went to lunch at' his club. he looi?ed up Si; John Lauder in Burke and Debrett, but without find ing him. "Have you ever.come across a Sir John Lauder, or do you know the name?" said he to a friend. "Sir John Lauder?" replied the other. It was that useful and omniscient per son; Gordon itelrose. "Wasn't he the man who was made a Jubilee baronet. partly because he was boss of the Green Ray Line and partly because he had been N.P. for Smokeboroughi for Lord knows how long?" "No doubt you are right." "Well, then, I can tell you this. I-Ie is enormously wealthy, much advanced in the sere and yellow, and has been mar ried three times." "Three times?" "Yes. I notice that men who make large fortunes by what are facdtliously known as their talents, genius, and powers of organisatidn generally run through several wives pretty quick. The fact is that lovely woman undoubtedly thrives best when she has her own way, and I expect that these men who shape the world to suit their own ends rule their wives with such a rod of iron that the poor dears die off like flies through sheer exasperation at never getting the last word. By-the-by, what's this story that I hear of your stopping a runaway horse in the Row this morning? Wrho was the lady?" "Well, she happened to be Lady Lauder." - "Phew .... I see .... People have been speculating whether you will marry her?" "It is really very good of them to con cern themselves with my affairs,'! said FeirTers, w'ho wavered between an im pulse to laugh and a keen desire to do some violent personal injury to some body. "Well, you will be able to satisfy them on that head now." "Yes .,... It is a pity. A. romance manque. ;.. And yet, who knows?" "Do not let your imagination run away w'ith you," said Ferrers, rather sternly bringing dow7n a heavy hand on the little man's shoulder with a grip that made him wince. "It is not healthy." And with these words, which may or many not have concealed a warning, he released Ielhose and left the roonm., "Now, confound him," thought the latter, "his fingers are like iron, and my shoulder will ache for a week. And why should.he be so angry if he were not epris with her, I should like to know?" This was a question which Feirers would have found it hard to. answer truthfully. Sir John Lauder catled and proved to be a large man with a florid face and white hair. Ferrers classified hint as solemn, seventy, prosy. practical. The visitor, held forth on the subject of the great service .which Ferrers had ren dpred; precisely as if he were moving a resolution in the House of Commons. Only in the latter case he might have been howled at, ?nd F?rrers had 'to en dure ln'silence 'The speechl concluded with a;i:lproposal that F?errers should confer th!"e';benefit of his friendship on the Lauder family, and cement the al liance: hy, dining with them.,, n ' :whlena t, r ge. pompous, and sonmewhat.overearing ; elderly' gentle mian?spost?ively' insists.on your;: adopt ihn'a.cburse'bf action wehich ,you feel a i;d ilad munholy lonrging to embark ori; mthough you kilow that it is ahbout the: imost lprtdent thiig :thit :youf can do, .'.the e -nnd mai b'eo ..predicted iiithout requiring any assistance' from :a ghost come from the grave for 'the purpose:, ; :.. . : ' \- in'dus course: Ferersa dined aith the Lauders.

Per haps, moreover, if IMrs t'drid-Chaid had not taken so much trduble to "lnterfere," as Colonel rterrers styled"her': conduct, it might have been: more effective as a check. The result of long repression, proximity, and the feeble goading of his sister axs that passion took the bit be tween his teeth, and Henry Ferrers was carried away by the wild rush of his emnotion, just as Lady Lauder had beea by her steed in Hyde Park. SAt times he remembered the husband, at whose table he had sat, and who had trusted him as a ftriend, and to whose friendship he meditated suchl a fearful betrayal. Heanwhiile the fortress had as yet given no sign of alarm and defence. He soothed himself 'with the fancy that there had been nothing in his condict to cause fear- or indignation to the most faithful spouse. At other times he in-. sisted to himself that she loved him even as he loved iher, and that it thi?eir mutu:al passion lay the excuse for---- He did not 'dare to formu late his thoughts. Then there were other moments when the supreme dignity and modesty of her demeanor made him denounce as sacrilege the mere idea of any ev-il in connection with The great devil Opportunity brought matters to the climnax as usual, Itrs Orre-Chard gave a ball to finish up the Doncaster week. Colonel Ferrers and Lady Lauder danced together, fell more in love wilth each other, and sat out ill the conservatory. There he told bler of his love for her, how he had loved her from the very first moment, and she "O shame, O sorrow.. and O womankind"- did not repulse him. On the contrary, she avowed a mutual feeling, adding that she knew it .vns very wicked of'her, but that it wans a fact that she jiad been very mnuch attracted by him from the day when ha saved her life. He pressed upon het attention the \- considarttion of tile date, "Whe r we lleave here," he said, "let us go stligliht to Loundnn, and then "Oh, dear'. no," she crled witi Vivacity.
