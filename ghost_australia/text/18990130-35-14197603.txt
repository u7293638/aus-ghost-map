A DAY ON THE HARBOUR. BY AN ONLOOKER, Even at the farther end of the earth the wandering Australian is unable to escape a car tam gentle irony about this harbour I say the Australian advisedly, for though that piece of water is Sydney's very own all Australians share the pride of possession There is a story of a Sydney man dining peacefully with a pleasant party in one of the oUowa' quaint rooms at Pembroke Among the classic associations of Cambridge he might have surely been safe from any reference to the everlasting subject-until a very modern young lady of Newnham asked him sweetly across the table if it were true that ship- masters, as they approached our coast, exhibited signals to the effect that they had already seen the harbour and appreciated it highly It is recorded that the victim hastened to explain that this attempt to escape the inevitable interviewer had indeed been tried, but a service of fleet pilot-cut- ters had been established to waylay these guileful skippers on the neighbouring high, seas with the necessary question and BO defeat the scheme No, we did not excavate the harbour ourselves, and if we ask the visitor what he thinks of it we do so because he expects that little attention, because we like to observe that air of preserving superiority which he assumes when the expected question is put to him, and because he takes himself so seriously But our harbour is our pearl all the same The wandering Australian remembers its wordless charm, and his absent fancy know its fascination Take ally UkelastThursday-Anniversary Day A typical Australian day in January, with a warm sun, a crisp breeze, wavelets with a sparkling ripple, and thousands of Sydney's citizens afloat and ashore to witness the annual regatta, which for over 60 years has been the characteristic feature of the national holiday It was a happy inspiration that made Anniversary Day a holiday to be celebrated as a harbour festival As such it dates from a time when Sydney was Australia, and even to day there is something about it re- miniscent of old Sydney, and the life afloat and ashore of the days when William the Fourth was King For this Anniversary Day Regatta dates from the closing years of that forgotten era One of the most familiar pictures of old Sydney shows the aspect of the harbour on regatta day, with the men and women of the time in their dresses of a bygone fashion and unspeakable hats of a lost generation, as their crowds fringed the various points to watch the aquatic carnival Sydney has changed since those old days The background of the familiar engraving shows wooded hills where there are now thickly populated suburbs the line of the harbour is altered by waterside residences, and the sweeping sea wall of the Botanic Gardens and the great flag ship of last Thursday would have considerably astonished some of those who knew the sailing ships and paddle steamers of the time when that sketch was made Ironclads ride at anchor in Farm Cove where -wooden warships used to strain at their cables, and Garden Island, seas, has changed its old ture aspect But many things have changed since then besides the aspect of the city and the dress of the people Sydney to-day has multitudinous holiday attractions to compete with the ever great event of the year, and to their distracting influences is due the falling off of late years in the popularity of the regatta The people began to go out to races, picnics, the mountains and the seaside, and to sports of all kinds, and seemed to forget for awhile the water carnival of the year But one thing remained always un- changed, and that Was the harbour itself. It was always there, biding its time and waiting its turn again It came on Thursday, arriving, as our American cousins say, with both feet It was emphatically Sydney's harbour day, and a revival, if not an eclipse, of the glories of the past That long water stretch, with its thousand inlets and points and curves is an ideal play-ground for the people at any time, but the stranger who saw it last Thursday may be satisfied to has seen it at its best He saw the crowded sails, the flying white wings as they flashed down the bay in the sun, the ships gray with flags, the people on the water and along the shore line, and more than this we are not able to show him. But it is only those who live along the harbour's fringe, and who frequently drive in its depths, or swim and float on its surface, who know it in all its moods and phases of beauty It has a mood for every hour of the day, our harbour In the pale hush of dawn before the first breath of day sings lightly flute like in the eucalyptus leaves, and when the faint flush of early colour poetises the scene, it has a character of crepuscular mystery like a passage in verse by Verlaine, or a fresco by Puvis de Chavonnoo As the light gathers one sees that the morning mists fringe the distant prospect like airy curtains, lending a suggestion of a veiled contrast with the long, quiet bay, reflecting the still trees and the sky's dimmed pearl, as it lies like a quiet river deep down through interlacing branches Then slowly the distant mist curtains furl and rise, and distant point and island, the forms of ships, the towers of the city, and the long vistas of distance swim successively into v now is the palms and fringing beaches of an island mirage take shape and swirl in theneat-haze of a Topical sea By this time the harbour lies shining in the sun like the polished surface of a Roman lady's mirror, reflecting sky and cloud, and rock and tree, and the ropes and spars of tall ships, and here and there an island or a Martello tower, or a bit of archaic settlement that might have been copied from the originals that line the Mediterranean shore us ancient defences against the corsair Algennes That is Sydney harbour in outline as it may be seen any January morning in the year An hour or tt\ o on Anniversary Day transformed it into a busy scene of life and movement, and the stranger we imagined just now would have been puzzled to match in his travelled experience the beauty of the picture that presented itself when the proceedings of the day were at all on their way Swift white wings cutting the air like the flight of a swallow, and stately yachts with their balloon jib displaying acreages of snowy canvas as they bore down towards the flagship with graceful and majestic motion, crowded the scene wherever the eye rested, making ceaselessly changing pictures and varieties of unstudied yet effective composition and grouping There are, of course, fine aquatic Eights to be seen elsewhere We do not compete with Cowes, for instance, except in the beauty of natural surroundings The interest of an Oxford and Cambridge boatrace is, of course, something unique of its kind, as is the scene on the Thames when the ownership of the blue ribbon for the year is decided, or at Henley on its own particular day Perhaps in the history of aquatics there never was anything more successful as a spectacle than the contests between the old Venetian guards, when gondolas, manned by rowers in the picturesque events of their orders, competed with each other for the historic event of the year But our harbour on regatta day depends for its spectacular effect on no particular historical or medieval association, but only on the effect on the eye as the white wings skim athwart the blue It is as a picture that we prefer to regard it, and nothing more The stranger may recall, if he please, such a scene as that which meets the eye from beautiful Capriwhon the fishing boat flotilla rounds Sorrento, or beats up the bay at evening past Ischia, or round the sweep of that ghost haunted coast-line towards the distant Vesuvius There is a rosy mist in the air and on the sons, romantic in the distance as those of the old classic voyagers who consecrated every headland with a story, and to whose charmed ears the Sirona Whose rocks are courageously Shown in the neighbourhood did not always lift up alluring voices in vain But it is not the fisher- man's sails one sees, and the rosy mist is not that of (the evening The eye is trimmed with far coming fancies , it sees rather the airy fleets of the Greek wanderers who built the ruined Possum whose columns can almost be seen away to the right, the Roman [galleys, the Saracenic adventurers, and the scores of other famed voyagers whose keels but these waters from the beginning of time. But it is fancy that makes the picture. The stranger who can recall the scene on the Inland Sea in the early morning when the Japanese mosquito fleet drops down with the wind, the pleated sails catching the first glow of the sunrise, has a memory picture worth the while of any lover of the picturesque to treasure and remember and no one who has seen the Arab boats put out to meet the mail steamer from Suez, laden with wild-eyed Oriental hucksters and golden oranges, and shaking their tattered sails between the brown of the desert and the blue of the bright sea, will not lightly forget the effect of that magical colour and contrast. From the hills above Hongkong our stranger may have looked out across the yellow China Sea, dotted in the far and near distance with the strange Bails and stranger archaic shapes of those old-world junks, and he may remember the scene as one of the most curious and picturesque that the seascape of East or West can furnish. There are few things finer in this way, though, than a fleet of pearlers lightly skimming the horizon in the neighbourhood of Torres Straits, But even the recollection of all those things or any one of them, unique as some of them are in their way, and picturesque as they are all, will not succeed in effacing the impression left by a view of Sydney Harbour on such an occasion as this last celebration of Anniversary Day, which we hope is to mark the revival of the annual regatta and its popularity as a national institution, and bring back again the aquatic glories of the past.
