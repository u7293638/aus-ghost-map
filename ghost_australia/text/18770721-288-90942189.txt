-%0rimg |ta* SPORTING IN ENGLAND. TBy Weston.1 The Tvoist enemies of the turf couid hardly have suggested action more calcu lated to serve their side of the question than tbe rcotion of Mr. Alexander, which has been recently carried at a meeting of the J octey Club. The Turf Senate has reduced tbe minimum weight in handicaps from 5 st. 7 lbs. to 4 st. 7 lbs. As the meetings are private, the majority who carried this ill advised alteration escape the criticism they undoubtedly merit. Lord Hard ?wicke has given notice, and Sir John Astley seconds, that the -weight sLall be restored to 5 st. 7 lbs., and those best informed now regard the late change as good as reversed. To turn to racing. The Newmarket Craven was a meet ing of great interest. The feature, per haps, of.it was the great form of Peter Rice's select stable, which carried off the Sale Stakes, and .Newmarket Handicap with Hidalgo, the Bushes Handicap with Polly Perkins, and the Free Handicap with Nitocris, while their representative got within half a length of Grey Friar for ihe Three-Y ear-Old Biennial. The most unac countable thing in the race, and more especi ally viewed by the light of later performances, was the runniDg of Warren Hastings and Silvio, so utterly inconsistent with their two-year-old form. Both Matthew Dawson and Charlie Rayner were firm that the running of their colts was not within 21 lbs. of their true form. In the home- trial Silvio had cantered home in front of Skv lark, and Skylark easily defeated Coltness. F. -Archer out of seven races on the Craven Thursday brought home six winners, and he is said to have eclipsed all his past doings by the way he steered Belle of Sutherland home a neck in front of Con stance and Conquest for a maiden plate. The highest class two- year-old was un doubtedly Salute, and this filly as well as Hidalgo were bred by Lady Emily Peel at the Bonehill stud. The Epsom Spring Meeting which fol lowed, commencing on April 24, is held to be the most successful which has been wit nessed on the- Downs. Fine weather and a great concourse rewarded Mr. Dorling. The victory of Julius Gaesar in the City and Suburban was most popular, as he had been the public's favorite all through the piece. Robert Peck was confident that the issue rested between Julius Caesar and Touchet alone, and he won with quite a stone in hand. Twelve months ago Robert Peck said — ' I shall be first and second for the Derby, but if Hayhoe has made no mistake with the Mineral Colt he will slip me 'up.' The issue was Mineral Colt— Kisber, ? 1, Forerunner 2, Julius Caesar 3. A remarkable instance of thorough knowledge. The winner of the City and Suburban is by St. Albons — Julie. Peck purchased him from Lord Aylesford for 3,300 guineas, and subsequently sold him to Mr' Gee, Of Dewhurst for 5,000 guineas. Subjoined are particulars of the aace. : . : .

After a long delayat the post the colors of Julius Caesar were for a few strides seen in front, but he was immediately pulled back, and Tas$el went on with the lead, -with Bonchuioh,. Volturno, Snail, and Warren Hastings j the next lot being Chaplet, Bondsman, Chypre, Touchet, Don Carlos, Hes per, and the Voltella Colt, Julius Caesar/ being in the centre, while, in the rear ; were Balbriggan and Cheetah. As they ,^v' went past the mile-post the leading horses closed up, and Warren Hastings, witk Volturno, began to tail off. Coming round Tattenham Corner Tassel was running in, company with . Chaplet, . Bonchurcn, and Bondsman, followed . by Touchet, Snail,. Hesper, Don Carlos, St. Leger, and Julius Cseear. Balbriggan, who was running through his horses, began to show in th* leading division, and before getting fairly* into the 'straight Tassel began to give way. The running on the rails was. taken \ip by Touchst, who in company with Snail was at the head of affairs. Chaplet here was beaten, as were Bonds man and Bonchurch $ but well up with the leaders on the whip hand were Margarita, John Day, and Hesper, who was pulling double, and on the inside were St. Leger and Don Carlos, this pair being almost in a line with the leaders, Julius Cassar treading: - on their heels in the centre of the course ;.. and to this lot the race was confined. As they approached the distance St. Leger and Don Carlos were done with and Snail ran up to Touchef s head, the pair now beings waited on by Julius Caesar to the Bell, where the latter rushed to the front and won in a canter by six length; three-quarters of a length separated Touchet from Bal hriggan ; Snail fourth, in front of Hesper,. John Day, Ghost, Cartridge, Chypre, St^ Leger, Warrior, Rosbach, and Cheetah ; the last lot being the Votella colt, James Pigg,. Tassel, Dr. Gully, and Warren Hastings. In the two-year-old the Eussley stable was invincible, 'and La Merveille, by Blair Athol out of pauldon, who won the Hyde Park Plate, is probably the fastest two year-old stripped this season. Her stable companion, Grace, was tried to be con siderably inferior to her- but the Nor thampton winners Hudibras and Preciosa could never extend Grace. The Great Metropolitan was not re markable for either quantity or quality. Of the half- dozen that contested it none but old Lilian possessed high credentials, and; her appearance was so liked that she was installed first favorite, John Day and Nor wich of the others being the ones farcied. The issue was left to this trio, John Day winning easily. The details are . as follow: — GEEAT MBTEOPOI.ITA.K STAKES. Of 25 sovs. each, with 200 added. About two a nd a quarter miles. Mr. {A.
