-:- I AN, ANTIQUATED POST-OFFICE I REGULATION. TO THE EDITOR OF THE MERCURY I Smart posted a letter of some family importance in time for the Tamar this week, but on taking up your issue of yesterday after breakfast, judge my surprise when I saw a notice that it had been detained for additional postage, and found on enquiry that the startling sum of one penny was due. In my case it matters very little, but, Sir, there are many cases which under similar circumstances would amount to positive injury and hardship. Surely the latter could have been forwarded and our paternal Government would have collected the penny with any fine for the omission. You Tasmanians get the name of being slow on our side of the straits, but this is about the slowest transaction I have heard of, for since I have been your visitor I have no reason to complain of even the appearance of lack of energy in any line, but more particularly in ministering to the comfort of your guests. My object in writing to you will be gained if you can induce your Post Master General to alter this obnoxious rule, in case he call up the ghost of Rowland Hill, which even in those spiritual times might not be agreeable to that gentleman. Yours truly, DAVID H. VALANTINE. Rock Hotel, Hobart J. Town, March 12th, 1873. [With so many evidences as we have of the desire of the present permanent head of the Post Office department, we can only express our surprise that the obnoxious regulation has not long ago given place to a practice such as that suggested by our correspondent.
