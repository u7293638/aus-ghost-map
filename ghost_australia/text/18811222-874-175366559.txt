Theatrical Reminiscences. (AFTER TOMHOOD—CONSIDERABLY.) *' I bsmembeb ! I remember 1 when I went upon the stage, A baby actor too was I, just thirteen years of age ; Once I was carried on a bier, remember it I can, But now I carry off the beer, since I have grown a man. I patronised a barber too, who barberously would smile, And say, ''my boy," you put on aire," in quitea "barefaced "style I set my life upon a " cast," as Hamlet I could shine, Though not fine as a "super," I looked quite superfine. The manager once hit me right upon my shaven chops, Because I t called him names and said, that my line wiurit props; I pegged his pardon on my knees, onkneesy at his huff— He swore he'd put me in the "flies," but wasn't fly enough. He often muddled my poor brain, such nonsense he would talk; " Pros " only knowtruemisery, when "ghosts refuse to walk Big partshe'dgive andtitt!ecash,andtellus we were cracked. And if we dared to ask for more, he wouldn't let us act. So there and then I made a vow, that I would make a name, And mount the ladder till l rt ached the pinnacle of fame; I studied Hamlet, Ingomar, and also read King Lear, Bought wardrobe, ne w and second-hand, and started my career^ I leased a theatre where I thought a fortune would be made,, "Billed" Hamlet for the opening night, which danetily I played; Asd in the morning, candid-like, the papers did confess My conception was a different one to that liked by the press. Result—l ye made my fiualbow, the public will not' * part," And in Australia won't support true histrionic art. Farewell to the stage, 'tis a, dazzling delusion, Farewell 1 yes a loving-farewell to the press ; Farewell to rehearsals and all the confusion, To spangles, make up, and the atrical dresB.
