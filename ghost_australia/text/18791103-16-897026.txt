Appointment of Municipal Valuer. TO THE EDITOR OF THE BRISBANE COURIER. SIR,—In your issue of Saturday you have only considered it necessary to insert a very short paragraph on the above subject, although the settlement of the question has been deemed by the council of sufficient importance to necessitate their holding two special meetings, in addition to the first ordinary meeting ; and if my infor- mation is correct, the ultimate result given by you is not absolutely correct, the appointment having been made on a majority of 10 to 2, and not 11 to 1. I was told at the beginning of my candidature that it would beo utterly useless—it was even as strongly put as " if an angel from heaven were to stand he wouldn't have the ghost of a chance ;" and yet, when each alderman had to vote for two candidates, I scored 6, and the successful candidate only 8 votes. This surely was so nearly a victory as to be worthy of being recorded. Had my six supporters only stuck to me at the last voting, and had one of them happened to be his worship the Mayor, why I should now be the successful candidate. I am not intimately acquainted with racing rules, but isn't it customary in a field of ten to record the positions of others besides the first horse ? The second horse saves his stakes, does'nt he ? My position as second in this race would at all events seem to indicate some justification for having entered into the competition.—Yours, &c.;, ÆNEAS WALKER.
