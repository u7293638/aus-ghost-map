GOLD. Sub-Inspector Brooke, of the Queensland police, has reported that whilst patrolling he came on a lot of Chinese working on alluvial gold with very good prospects. It is about 16 miles from the present Nor manby diggings, and is nearer to Cooktown. There were also likely looking reefs in the vicinity. The Chinese have not any miner's right amongst them. Msany of the South India gold mines continues to yield well; the quantities of gold raised and sent to England are con siderable, and the latestnews is reassuring. Such yields as 2 ozs., 3 ozs, and 5 oas per ton from thick persistent roofs are not un common. Mr. John Taylor, the well known mining engineer, after a careful survey, stated at a meeting lately held in London, at which Sir Charles Tennant, Bart., M.P., presided that one vein now being worked is "7 feet wide and averages 4 ozs per ton all the way" Captain Plummer, in reference to the works under his control, is of" opinion that his company will open out one of the most extensive gold mines in the world." Italian work men are now employed in most of the mines, and rock drills and the beat machinery procurable have boon introduced: The remarkable yields from the South India mines have greatly agitated the share-market; the shares have risen largely in price, but honest work is being done, and honest work alone will prove the value of perhaps the most ancient gold mines in the world. The gold yields of the Sandhurst gold field for the week ending April 10 (says the Bendigo Advertliser) reached 2500 ozs, which is fair for the off week. Lansell's 180 mine keeps its position as leader, with a fine return of 701 ozs. The other principal returns were :-Shenandoah, 220 ozs ; No. 20 Tribute, 118 ozs; Lady Barkly, 156 ozs ; Frederick the Great, 145 ozs ; Bruhn's a"i ozs; hercules, 122 ozs; Golden Pyke, 118 ozs. There was only one dividend, New Beehive (is), £1500. As " Ghost Wednesday" happens next veek, the calls are heavy-£-8,096 10s.
