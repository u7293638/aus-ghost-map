Dr. Douglas, who has been here relieving Dr. Kennedy for the last six months, left for Adelaide by the last train. He was a general favorite, and prior to his departure was presented by the townspeople with a handsome gold watch-chain. Dr. Kennedy has benefited greatly by* his well-earned holiday, and has come back quite bright and cheerful. Mr. Gillen, S.M., of Alice Springs, arrived here to-day en route for Adelaide. M.C. Johnston, of Ulamurta, has just arrived with seven native pri soners, en route for the Port Augusta Gaol, to where they have been committed for a period of six months. The prisoners travelled over f-00 miles before reaching Oodnadatta, and among. them is the noto rious Aribi, who has given so much trouble to the police to capture. A peculiarity in connection with four of the other prisoners is that the Government was instrumental in providing them for the first time with any clothing. On the whole the prisoners presented a very lamentable and a some what revolting appearance. Great praise is due to Constable Johnston for having so successfully accomplished his arduous undertaking of bringing the prisoners safely to Oodnn.datta. PORT AUGUSTA, May 17.

Baker, and the school children, after which supper was partaken of. NOARLUNGA, May 20. -The. new blood infused into t'he Noar lunga Board of Auvice by the election of Dr. Hone has given general satisfaction, and although the services rendered to the parents attending the school by the retir ing member (Mr. Wm, Holly) are not to be lightly or thanklessly passed over, yet the, number of votes cast, and the mild ex citement caused in this neighborhood by the contested election betokens the -increas- ing interest which is being taken in edu cational matters generally in the district. ? Arbor Day thie year will Jse held earlier than usual, and will not be so much of a show day as in past years, on account of the inauguration of a ''Visiting Day' after the annual examination in August next. This season it will be necessary to hold the Arbor Day. early in June if the tree planting is to be the success which it has been in previous years. The anniversary of ? the Wesleyan Sun day-school was celebrated on Sunday, and crowded congregations attended the three services conducted by the Rev. Mr. Mor timer. After t'he tea meeting on Monday, which was well patronised, a service of songj^entitled 'The Californian nugget,' was given in a satisfactory manner by the Sunday-school children, in conjunction with the Bible-class and teachers. .

BAROSSA, May 21 Fif ty men were given employment at the Barossa reservoir last week, and it is pro bable a much larger number will be re quired shortly. The Menzies Barossa mine has gone into liquidation, with the result that Messrs. J. Martin & Co. have purchased the entire plant.

An enjoyable dance was held in bhe Port Victor Institute on Friday night, when the Winter Social Circle met to open the win ter season. The building trade is at present at a standstill, and work generally is scarce, only the district council providing employ ment for a few men. A number 6f smart young fishermen have been examined by the doctor for the Naval Reserve, and will be enrolled at an early date. Miss White, who for several years has acted as honorary organist at the Anglican Church at Port Victor, having resigned, Miss Lindsay has undertaken the duties. Miss Lindsay's father for many years was a lay reader and an earnest worker in con nection with St. Augustine's Anglican Church at Port Victor. The marram grass planted by tfhe Rail way Department at the gap at Port Elliot is not the unqualified success that it has been at Normanville and elsewhere. It does not seem to thrive well, 'probably owing to the exposed position. A lew splintered pieces of timber have come ashore along the coast, probably from the Loeh Sloy wreck, but nothing of any value. ? The wool for shipment at Port Victor is still stuck up up. the river, the small depth of water making it impossible - for the barges to come down with their freight.. The large area under wattle cultivation in the district will shortly absorb a large number of hands stripping bark for the coming bark season. This industry is a leading feature in the products of the dis trict. An application was recently made for the erection of a boatshed and boat-jetty oppo site the Custom-House at Port Victor, but the reserve having recently been levelled and planted at great expense to the rate payers, and all obstacles to the yjew re moved, the application, very properly, was not entertained. It is- proposed to erect a new store for the life-savmg apparatus near the railway line and Custom-House at Port Victor, pro viding the existing shed on the lifeboat jetty can be disposed of in connection with the new baths. Tina would be a great ad vantage, and facilitate considerably the transport of the life-saying gear in any direc tion in the event of disaster. Considerable delay mupt necessarily occur in getting the gear to the mainland for transport by van or rail in its present situation, and as sav ing tune is the essential feature in connec tion with the life-saving apparatus, it is hoped the negotiations will be eatisfao NURIOOTPA,May 18. On Saturday evening the annual meeting connected ynbla i .the recreation park- was held at Simon's -HPtel, Th^president, Mr. L.
