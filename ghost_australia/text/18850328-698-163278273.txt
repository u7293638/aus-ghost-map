FICTION. The Luck of the Darrells. By James Payn, Author of 'By Pioxi,'' CifilTOS'S YbAB,' &C;, &C; Chapteb XIV. ? PBEMONITOBY. The Colonel was not in the drawing-room when Hester reached it, a dratatataase that was sot surprising, since there was little time to ?pare for his- dressing for dinner, a ceremcay which In rareiy dispensed with even when they wee quite ak-x-e; u»d yet his absence disturbed her. She vat ocJy Testraicei, indeed, fcrom the consciousness that it would give him aancyanee, fxcm goiqg up to his room at ones to make iiurnirtes, for that something was wrong with him c&e; felt certain. Her Buspieioig, for indeed be looked ? ill enough, took the direction of dl healh. She had heard him sav, in days when he no doubt meant it, that health was tha greatest of blessings ; if so, he ought to have been a happy nap, ftr, like many who live what the doctors call ' unwholesome lives,' he had known but little illness. She could npt coacdvp, of course, of a time having arrived to him when he could gladly have sacrificed bis magnificent ccc* tihjtTos for that resignation which is sometimes found even in the wearable, aad bartered his ewe of body for peace of mind. Hester imparted her fears to nurse Arkell, who made light of them. She had just met her master on the stairs, who had greeted her with his usual fcinflnwui and the smiling face, which, little guessing who had seen him without that mask, he had pnt on as eoon bb he entered his own door. As to any serious misfcrtone having happened to him, that, she was firmly convinced, could only occur to one of his race at -the seaside. She did net understand that, though ' inland far ' they might be, the Darrclls had the eame cause to fear the sea of trouble aa other people, and far less what very dirty weather some folks met vita upon racecourses. No, so, tie Colonel wa3 all right, fho would warrant it, ttough, maybe, he uas tirei with the long drive in the duet and heat. Hester did not believe it ; and yet such is the power of sym pathy, if only it be genuine, no matter from what humblest source it tpringe, (Lat tbe old woman's words and com panknsbip were not without their comfort. 'What was much mere reassuring, however, was the sight of her father himself. When, after a somewhat longer toilet than usual, he made hiB appearance in the drawing room, save tor a little paleness, there was not a. trace of the trouble that had lately eat upon the handeome face. The tone fa which he naked what the had been doing with her # self in his absence was so pleasant and cheery tbat it dis pelled half her apprehensions at onca. Still what she bad bo lately eeen had made too strong an impression upon her to be ignored. , . ' Dear papa, what has been the matter ??' she faid. 'The matter, my child r1' His tone had astonish ment in it, but W6S not, she fancied, without a tinge of annoy ance. . ? ? 41 Why you looked eo ill just now, or at least I thought eo, as you sat 02 the drag.'* . . ....._. ' How came you to eee me F* ' be inquired quicKiy. ' 1 was in Mrs. Brabazon's carnage, and when we were blocked in Piccadilly you passed within a few feet of us, and we all observed how pale and distrait you were looking.' ' ' All of you V who were the all ?** he aaktd with a light laugh.' 'If is inoet- gratifying to hear of more than two persons taking an interest in one's looks.** ?, ? ? -..-:?. ** But indeed, papa, you made me quite miserable,''- per- EiEted Hester. 'You were staring straight before you, cutting vour own daughter dead, and with a cigar in your mouth that was not even alight.' 11 1 am very sorry ; nothing was farther from' my intention than to cnt.yoa ; bat the truth is I was tired -and bored to death with the. noise and racket. I am all right now, but it's a warning. I will never go down to the Derby— J-y road — again. I am getting too old for it.' ?;-? ;??''?? ' ' Pooh ! nonsense ! think of my dear young papa talking, like that!' ? , ? , ,. She was getting thoroughly reassured; ' his natural, manner and the bantering tone he ordinarily used to her had returned *© hinj. Sine little gaessed^rhat an eifort they cost * him; ehe little dreamt, as she covered the, supposed con valescent with her artless careesee^that every kies was a stab s ' Come, here is dinner,'1 Jtetsid, with an air of satisfac tion* as the man announced it. 'You must take my arm, mks, to show jou have fo'rgiyen me -and I was very high up, you must allow — for overlooking you in FiceMUlyv I, hope you have your usual splendid appetite.' . . ' 1 have got it now,' she answeredVin a tone half earnest and half gay, ' though ten mmuten ago I felt as if I should never care for food again. You don't know what it is, to see the ghost of your own papa, eir.' „. .'?'; ' What spoils my appetite. quite as much, my dear, 1b a Derby luncheon. You don't know what it is to eat too much lobster-salad on a coach -roof, with Jour plate on your knee. Like the gentleman in the old song, 'I can ' eat but JitUe meat,' I fear, to-day.'' . 'Oh! papa, I «m bo sorry.' : ' On the other hand, dear,' he continued playfully, ' I am very thirsty, and, to continue the ditty, ' do think that I c&n; drink with any that wears a hood ; ' is we will join in the extravagance of a little champagne.' It was indeed, necessary that the Colonel should excuse himself for eating, for he felt as if a moreel of food would have gone nigh to choke him. while on the other band he had never before stood in such urgent need of a stimulant. The exhilarating liquid — which rarely fails to supply our immediate wants, but, like a money-lender, generally de ' matde a pretty high rate of interest for the accommodation —bad the effect described. His talk was cheerful and bright throughout the meal, and not till they had reached the drawing-room again did he refer to tbat unfortunate rencontre in Piccadilly, the impression of which he was * desirous enough to remove from bis daughter's mind. ' You Lave not yet told me, by-the-by,' be observed in cheerful tones, ' who were your companions in the carriage besides Mrs. Brabazon ; I suppose it was lady Jane, who. is always eager to escape from her mother and the family chariot.' ' No, it was not Lady Jane,' returned Hester gravely, ' though it was another friend of yours. I don't think you would easily gueBs bis name.' 41 It was some gentleman, flben, was it? Not old Sir Archibald, surely. I must really take Mrs. Brabaum to task if she exposes you to the fascinations of such a gay Lothario.' ' It was not an eld gentleman at alL It was Mr. Digby Mason.' ? ' Digby Mason P Do von mean to tell me that he was driving in the park wiUfjou ? ' aaid the Colonel, knitting his brows. ' He was in his aunt's carrispe, papa, and I could scarcely turn him out of it,' Hester answered, laughing. 'I cannot say, however, that I much enjoyed his society.' ' I dare eay not. I should not think you two were very sympathetic * And what did he eay when, as you tell me, you all observed that I was looking eo — so bored and head achy.' 'Not a word.' The Colonel unconeciously uttered a sigh of relief. ' He saw that I was distressed about you, and therefore no doubt forebore to remark on the subject.' 41 1 don't think Mrs. Brabazon should have brought him with her,' observed the Colonel discontentedly. I ' I don't think Mrs. Brabazon had much choice in the ; matter,' replied Hester. ' It struck ms that his aunt stands ) rather in fear of him.' . As her. father was evidently an- i noyed, Hester did not think it necessary to inform him that . . Mr. Mason had actually paid, a visit to the house before they itavted. ' Well, and before that, how did you spend your morn ing ? Did your cousin come according to promise ? ' ' Oh, yes, papa ! and I do so want to tell you about her. ' Whatever her -parents may be like, Lam quite sure Maria 1 Eoitoni»«KoodfitL I never was more taken with anyone 1 of my age before. She is full of tenderness and good feeling. I cannot eay how kind and friendly vas hex manner — how eager she was that I should come down to Sbingleton, or rather to Medbury Castle, where they live. Of course, as I told her, that is out of the^queetion ; but I do hope you will not put your veto against our being friends.' ** Heaven forbid, my child, that I should oppose you in any opportunity of making friends,' said the Colonel earnestly. ' There is so knowing how scon, or how much, you may need one.' ; In her delight at having so euiry obtained a permission of which «he hid her doubts, the gravity of her father's tone escaped Hester's attention. *' What a good dear papa you are ! I suppose it's quite tKeleM,' she added coaxingly, *? to suggest tbat perhaps in time 1 may Le tbe means of reconciliation between yon and ? »' ' Quits useless, my dear, and out of the question,' he in terrupted. Hid '.one was decisive enough, but without the bitterness that had heretofore accompanied it wbea speak ing of the same subject. ' So far from preventing you from cultivating your cousin's acquaintance,' he went on, \- 1 wouia encourage it. cut as tor ner parents, your recon ciliation with them, if it takes place— mind, I do not forbid it— must needs be after I am dead and gone.' Hester looked up at him in amazement and even in alarm. That her father should have spoken of a reconciliation with tbe BattaoB as a thii/g not impossible, at however distant a date, or not to be forbidden, was astounding to her; the leference to hie own decease, to which he had sever before alluded, filled her with vague foreboding. 'Oh, papa, do not talk like that.' 'Why eo, my child P Death comes no nearer to us be cause we mention him, nor even because we call for him. It is only right that white I am with you 3 on should know my views as to your fata re conduct, sbould 1 be taken from you. f ou might have in agiued, for example, that it would have been contrary to my wishes tbat you should hold any com munication with your cousin's family.' ' I did imagine it, papaj' said Hester gravely. ' Just so. It is well. then, that I have srxiken. and eince I aai upon the subject— a disagreeable one no doubt to yon, my carling, but we must talk of disagreeable things some tunes it seems,1' here he sighed, for this unhappy fact had only recently presented itself to his own mind, ' I would say, that should you find yourself fatherless, Philip Lang ton is tie man that will supply my place.' ' Never, never !' exclaimed Hester pessionately ; 'there is no one on earth that can do that. There is no one like my dear papa.'.' '? There are much belter men, my dear,1' was the grave reply, ' though indeed -there are none that love you as I love you. At least,' be added with a smile, ' tit pie«-nt, I should eay there is no one.' 'Nor ever will be,' murmured the girl earnestly, ' there never can be.' . ' 'Well, perhaps not,' raid the Colonel, stroking his daughter's shapely -head caressingly, »? no cue to love.ypu in tbe Rams fashion. There' is nothing like a' father's love, except what you have never known, poor dear, a mother's, lam glad to think that I shall have no rival, my darling. Let it,be ? Eclipse firsfi and Ihe rest nowhere,' by all means. Oiily there must be a second in every race, and in this case remember that it must be Philip, lie is the firmcBt friend I have, «nd the very soul of honour.1' 1 *' I like him very much, papa,' said Hester earnestly.

'Not tbat I wish you, my dear, to become Lady Plan tagenet, for a'mdmeat, or rather I should ssylor three months, which one'might reasonably hope would see tbe end of him. -Well, as Sir Archibaid cannot be relied upon as being, ao to speak, 4 scratched' for the Matrimonial Kace, of course no one can' be, so far as age is concerned, far lees a man not quite perhaps in his prtmiere jeuneste like me,' said the Colonel, twirling his mouttaches gallantly, ** but one m the prime of his maturity like Philip Langton.'S' ? / ' It is not perhaps Ms years,' *afd Hester reflectlveTy; ' that makes tbs think- Mr. Langton is much older than you, papa ; .it is not only that he locks, as nurse Arkell put it,, 'ae steady as ; old .time,' but as steadfast; one feels tbat nothiug could change him. I have no recollection of him having been other than he it now. As to having been in love at any period of hu existence, I cannot im agine such a state of things. , He is one of the beet of men, but bom to be an old bachelor.' ' And ypt Philip Langton is a married man,' said the Colonel gravely. *' Married ! Mr. Langton married ! Papa, you must be joking.' *' It is quite true, my dear, and, I am sorry to say, not at all a joking matter. Indeed it is a subject so sad and painful that 1 should never have mentioned it to you bad I not been speaking of possibilities. With this fact in your possession you will be relieved of all embarrassment in dealing with him, and it will be also less difficult to do eo, for in the secret which I have just disclosed bee the key to his character.' Hester listened in amazement, not only at the informa tion itself , bat at the gravity and earnestness of the tone with which it was imparted— a tone so foreign to her father's lips that she felt it to be dictated by somtthing beeida the subject, however serious, which formed its topic. The vague alarm which had seized her at the be ginning of their talk now once more took posBeEgjen of her. That he bad not hitherto revealed to her his friend's secret did not at all surprise her ; she was thankful for such confidences as her father reposed in her, but without feeling them her due. But why should he tell her now, and after eo long a silence ? ' When Philip Langton was a very young man, my dear — and if you had seen him then, you would have said that he was not only capable of falling in love, but of in- j spiring it — he married a girl no older than yourself and as * fair to look upon. That woman is alive now. I saw her 10 months ago ; a creature hardly recognisable as a woman, reeling from the doors of a gioshop.' M Oh, .papa, how terrible !' 'Yes, and she waaworae than a drunkard: she disgraced Bnd deserted him.' j *'Poor man!' murmured Hester pitifully; then, after a . pause, she added, ** Poor woman !' j ' Do not think that he cast her off and left her to starve,** j said the Colonel earnestly and with emotion. 'Philip \ Langton is not as other men. She has drained his purse, I as she did his honour, to the dregs. It is a subject there { is no need to speak of farther,' added the Colonel, 'but '. it was necessary that you should know it. Now you will understand him better.'' Hester did not «peak ; her eyes were full of tears. It seemed to her that there had never been so sad a siory. 'You must not distress yonraelf about it,' he continued with an attempt at iiieerfolneas. ' We have most of us our troubles, more or leas ; beside*, this happened so keg ago tbat yoo might as weH weep for the masetae of St. Bartholomew. Come, you must be very tired after your I short night, as I am after my long day. Kiss me, v^ j child, and go to bed.'1 - ] The Colonel pressed her to his heart in a long embrace, I and they parted witkoat another word. In some respects ] the evening h&d; heeu a painful one to Hester, yet she felt j that *he had never^ learned fo much of her father's cha racter before. It had never, indeed, seemed to her that anjtbirg was wanting1 in him. She was loyal for that, but she bad not hitherto suspected the existence in him of such deep and serious feelicge. It was probable, how ever, that they were more transitory than she gave him credit for ; for though the Colonel continued game time after his daughter left him plunged in thought, be pre sently rose and let himself quietly out of the front door and repaired to the ' Pick,' where, in spite of his supposed fatigue, he remained till far into the morning. As the toper after a debauch is all the more inclined for his favourite vice, or, as the phrase goes, ' to take a bone of I the dog that bit him,' »o it is with the gambler : aiid the very fact of his having lost heavily on tbe race course induced the Colonel to play higher than usual at the ciub
