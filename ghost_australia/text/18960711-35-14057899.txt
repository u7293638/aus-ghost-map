SCENE IN THE CATHEDRAL. The Cathedral of the Assumption is very small, so that very few people could witness the actual ceremony of the coronation To the numerous re- presentatives of the foreign press it was only found possible to allot less than a dozen places. The Times correspondent received one of them On a platform facing the high altar were the thrones of the Emperor and Empress surmounted by a canopy, and to the right of the Imperial throne, likewise under a canon, was the throne of the Empress Dowager The throne of the Emperor is covered with plaques of gold in which are set many large roughly-cut jewels, mostly rubies, emeralds, and turquoises to the number, it is said, of nearly 2000 It is usually called the Throne of the Tear Michael, the first ruler of the Romanoff dynasty, but according to the old records it belongs to an earlier period, had, ing been sent as a present by a Shah of Persia to Ivan the terrible the throne of the young Empress, covered with plaques of ivory beautifully carved in bas-relief, was a gift of Pope Paul II to the Tsar Ivan III on the occasion of his marriage with the meter of the lost Byzantine Emperor The Empress Dowager's throne, not unlike that of the Empire in general appearance, is that of the Tsar Alexis, father of Peter the Great, It is ornamented with nearly 1000 diamonds and over 1200 rubies, together with many turquoises and pearls, while from the back n e an eagle of solid gold and statuettes in the same metal of St Peter and St Nicholas the miracle worker the place assigned our correspondent was directly behind the Lrnpross's throne and on a slightly higher level, so that he could see plainly all that took part on the door and could even look into the sanctuary through the great doors of the iconoclast He writes - The Emperor holds himself erect, and shows in all his movements a great deal of quiet dignity, while his face which at some moments strikingly resembles that of his cousin the Duke of York, wears habitually a kindly sympathetic expression He wears the uniform of a colonel of the Preobroz husky Infantry Regiment, with the red Cordon of Alexander Narski and the plain Collar of St Andrew The Empress, as was s handsome, is to-day looking magnificent in a new dress of silver brocade out in the ancient fashion, her beautiful brown hair, dressed most simply without jewellery or other orna- ment falling in two long thick ringlets on her white shoulders She looks bright and cheerful, and in all her movements displays an easy grace and dignified composure On reaching the great door of the monastic the r Majesties kneel three times, venerate the holy irons, and ascend to the dais where they are gracefully received by the Empress Dowager At last the great personages who took part in the procession have found the r appointed places, and it would be difficult to imagine a more brilliant as some) Among foreign royalties I observe the Queen of Greece the Duke and Duchess of Connaught, the Duke and Duchess and Hereditary Prince of Coburg Prince Henry of Pi Russia, the Grand Duke of Hesse the Prince of Naples, the Crown Prince of Sweden the Prince and Princess of Roumania the Prince of Montenegro, the Duke of Sparta, and Princes George and Nicholas of Greece also Prime Ferdinand of Bulgaria In the small space rest TI el for the diplomatic corps are all the Ambassadors and Ministers Plenipotentiary On the opposite side I notice the Bishop of Peterborough, in full canonicals, occupying the place of honour among the foreign ecclesiastics, and near him a venerable Metropolitan of the Armenian Church Before proceeding to the coronation ceremony the Emu error, on the invitation of the Metropolitan of St Petersburg, reads aloud in a clear, unfaltering voice, from a richly bound volume held by his Eminence, the Orthodox Creed, and the Metropolitan thereupon invokes on his Majesty the blessing of the Holy Spirit Then comes the ceremony of rolling, which is performed with the assistance of the Metropolitan First the ordinary Collar of St Andrew is taken off in order to be replaced by the diamond Holkar of the Order and a magnificent mantle of State is placed on the Imperial boulders, while the Metropolitan pronounces with great solemnity the words, " In the name of the Father, of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost Amen" The Emperor then leans forward and the Metropolitan first rms the mystic rite of placing his hands in the form of a car on the Impanel head All is now ready for the most important port of the ceremony His Majesty, taking the great crown from the Metropolitan, puts it on with his own hands and sits down on the throne, holding in his right hand the sceptre and in his left the globe or dominion After sitting thus in state for a few minutes he stands up again and proceeds to crown his august spouse, who comes forward and kneels before him First be touches her forehead with his own crown, and then he puts on her head the little crown, which is at once attached to her hair by four ladies in waiting In like manner her Majesty is invested with a mantle of gold brocade and ermine resembling in all respects that of her august spouse Thus crowned cud invested, they sit in state while a proto-dtacon reads in a rough sten- torian voice the interminably long list of titles belonging to the Imperator and Autocrat of All the Kunst, and the emir chants a prayer invoking long life and happiness for the possessor of the bills The whole catholic bows three times by way of congratulation, while the awa loss of the Imperial Family and the foreign Princes go up to the day and express their good males to the Emperor, Empress, and Empress Dowager in a less impersonal fashion the near relations embracing aid the others kissing hand.

There remains the equally important rite of anointing with the holy oil, but meanwhile mass has to be celebrated and it lasts nearly an hour I was assured by an official of the Holy Synod, who happened to be standing by me, that of high dignt times there were no fewer than 60, all gorgeously arrayed in new vestments of rich gold brocade, looking very impressive in their beards and high mitres and still more picturesque when during mass they removed their head ROT and allow LH their long wavy hair to fall down over their shoulders " Every one of those ecclesiastical costumes," this period my friend of the Holy in nod, " is quite new and cost 10,000 troubles" I have heard Russian church music hundreds of time?, but never anything so thrilling as this, the deep bass voices of adult singers building marvellously with the ever soft, gentle voices of the little red robed choristers standing before the iconoclast Involuntarily I remembered the beautiful angelic choirs of J>a Angelico The only in irl ed peculiarity in this service is that at one moment the Emperor kneels and tends aloud a short special prayer, after which clergy and audience kneel, the Emperor alone standing, and a somewhat longer prayer is recited in a faltering voice by the aged Metropolitan As a preparation for the ceremony of appointment the Governor of Moscow lays down from the steps of the data to the great doors of the icouostase u crimson volt or carpet and a cloth of gold The great doors open, and two crispness, accompanied by proto-diacons, come forward and announce that the time has come for the celebration of the mystic rite The Emperor rose from his throne, hands his sword to one of his assistants, and descends the steps, followed by the Empress and accompanied by the highest Court dignitaries, of whom about 50 are required for holding up their Majesties' mantles Before the high altar the Metropolitan of Moscow, holding the t serious amphora of the holy christ, anoint i his Majesty on the forehead, eyes, nostrils, ears, lips, and breast, pronouncing the words " the seal of the gift of the Holy Spirit," and another Metropolitan, Monsignor of Kieff, wipes the parts touched by his colleague Then the Empress advances and is likewise anointed, but only on the forehead Again all the bells of the Kremlin are rung and another, salute of 101 guns is fired Here ends the mystical rite of the appointment There remains the administering of the Sacrament, which is celebrated with great pomp and with one peculiarity The Ltnpoior receives the elements separately-immediately before the altar whereas the Empress communicates outside the great doors in the usual manner of the laity As soon as their Majesties have returned to their thrones the rest of the Communion service is celebrated, and the choir chants with wondrous sweetness " Many years, many ye tra, many years " The I emperor resumes the crown, sceptre, and globe, and all present offer respectfully their congratulations by bowing three times The magnificent ceremony is at an end
