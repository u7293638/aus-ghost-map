LANGLEY. (FROM our OWN CORRESPONDENT. ) Wednesday. Within the last few days there has been some excitement here over a "ghost" which has appeared on several occasions. Last Sunday night, at about 9 o'clock, it was Been in" Mr Mitchell's Langley Paddock, and to cross the road and enter a belt of scrub in Mr Gardner's property. Several neighbours were immediately on the scene, and although the scrub was surrounded and a thorough search made, ho trace of the "spirit^' was found. I understand that it has also been seen oh the Barfold Bridge and at the Green 'Bill Cemetery, on both occasions late at night. Next time it pays us a . visit the residents intend to be ready to welcome it, and shouldit turn out to be -anybody playing a practical joke he will reoeivea rather warm reception. ^Harvesting is being vigorously proceeded with, most of the crops having now been cut. Notwithstanding the prevailing dullness, far fewer men are to be seen travelling the TOade this harvest,.
