CHINESE ATROCITIES AND MIS SIONARIES. To the Editor. Sir— Does it not seesn almost wrong that missionaries should be permitted to go to such savage countries as. China? The Chinese, having such, old- established, be liofc nnrl cirpli' a UiitrpA nf foreigners, seem to bitterly resen't interference m religious matters. * Surely even before the present crisis missionary zeal, besides causing ter rible massacres' of the converts and their instructors, has ..involved results costing numbers of other lives. Are there not sometimes selfishness and heedlessness in religious zeal? The answer invariably qnoted is that of the concluding verse ol Matthew 28— 'Go ye therefore and teach all nations, baptizing t^em in the name of the Father,' and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost. Teaching them to observe all thinffs whatsoever I Tiave commanded you. AndTlo! I am with you ahvay,even unto the end of the world. Amen/' Now this par ticular verse is regarded by some eminent critics as unauthentic. If this be so, what a terrible responsibility these good and self-saerineing people assume, and with re gard to China, what good have they done? ; I am, Sir, &c;, , CUIBONO?
