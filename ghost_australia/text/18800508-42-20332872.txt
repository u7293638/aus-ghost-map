LITERATURE Selected Poetry. Fra Luigi's Marriage. "A SAD strange tale it is, and long to tell: Would 't weary you to hear it, sir? It fell To mo alone to witness how he wed, Young Fra Luigi. Years he has been dead, Yet it doth seem but little while ago. I loved him. That is how I came to know What no one knew but me. " Twas on a day When all roads out of Rome were bright and gay With daisies and anemones ; tho spring Tlirilled every little lark und thrush to sing; Bo full the sunlit air of bloom aud song, An hour seemed just a magic moment long. You know the grand Basilica they call Paolo Santo, past tho city wall? 'Twas there. " The tale is strange, almost I fear Lest it seem false unto your foreigu ear. But you may trust it, sir. I loved him so I knew what she who bore him did not know. The day—this spring day full of song and bloOJB— I hear those larks yet. einging in the broom — Had been for months appointed as the day Whon ho—his frlond Andrea, too-should lay Him worldly garni outs at the altar down And tiko the Benedictiuo cowl and gown. Perhaps you'vo seen that service, sir ? "Nay? Then You'd like to hoar how they make monks of men. I've not forgotten it. I loved him so Kucli thing that happened on that day I know As it were yesterday." "A monk? Youiaid Your tale was how tho Fra Luifii wed." Ay, so it is." " Did take the church as bride T That is no secret marvellous to hide liehind thy phrase." " Nay, no such empty phrase Above my tale its idle shelter lays. The Fr.i Luigi's bride had face more fair Than any blossom in that spring-time air. I stood that day the nearest to her side; And well the face of Fra Lingi's bride I knew, for I had sorved her'hoimo when she First gladdoned it by her sweet infancy. Stern sat tho Abbot in his snow-white chair, Between the violet nmrblo pillars fair. Tho columns of rod jwrphyry shonu aud gleamed Beneath the yellow <iuivoiiiig rays that streamed From myriad ta|>ers making light so fast The gorgeous Baldacchino scarce did caat A shadow on the altar underneath, Or on the faces cold and still as death Of all the Benedictine brothers placed In solemn circles which the altar faced. Tho priest*' robes bl.ized with scarlet and with gold ; The swinging censers flashed with gems untold, And music wildly sorrowful and slow All down tho shadowed aisles went echoing low. As men who walked with heaven full in sight, Their faces lit with supernatural light, Luigi and Andrea came aud knolt. Tho silence like a datkuess could be felt In which their voices rang out young and clear Taking the vows so terriblo to hear, Obedience and poverty till death, And chastity in every act and breath ; Between tho vows sweet-chantod prayers wore taid That they might keop tliow vows till they were dead: Ah me ! I think the good Uod sorrowed then To aeo uiich bunions laid on mortal men. Next cumo tho ki»s of peace. In ovory oye Sprang tears, as, gliding slow and noiselessly Liko ghosts, tho lioncdictiucs ono by ono Embraced and kissed each novice. "All was done Now, kivo that last, most dreadful, sight of all— The dying to the world. Ono gold-wrought pall Of black the acolytes laid on tho ground. The music sank to lower, sadder, sound. Another pall was lifted high to spread Abovo the bodies. " With a joyous troad Luigi came to lay him down. Oue glance He lifted—oh, what sped the fatal chaneo? What cruel fate his ardent eyes did guide Unto her face who had been born his bride? 1 saw the glance. 1 Baw the quick blood mount Hor cheek as well as his, No man may count How swift love's motion in a vein can be; Light is a laggard, by its ecstasy. 'Twas but a glauco :—I said this tale was strange- Might seem to you but idle—such a change Did poes upon their facos, his and hers, As comes upon tho sen when sudden stirs A mighty wind. More ghastly now and white Thau he were dead, Luigi's face. " Tho rite Wont on. The pall upon their forms was dropped. Uigid they lay, as if their heart* had stopped: Tho candles (lickerod down: the light grow dim : Tho singers chanted low, a funeral hymn ; Tho mothers' sobs broke on the stifled air; For living sons lay worse than lifelws there. At last the pall was lifted. Now commands To rise in name of God wero read. With hands Unsteady in his joy, th« Abbot pressed Their biown,[and with his benediction bles«»d Tho n«w-born men. "Triumphant now and loud Tho Mass went on. The new-made brothers bowed And knelt in prayer beaido tho rect. At last Tho tedious Jla*a was done. With eyes downcast Slow-moving, one by one, tho nunki arose. Tho silent threshold of their cloibier close They ailont crossed. Luigi did not rise. Thinking him rapt in prayer, with reverent eyes Ami hands ciotsscd on hit) breast, the brother noxt Stood waiting—waited long ; at length, perplexed, He bent him down, and gently on kjs arm Laid hand: awe-stricken, in a quioJr alarm, Upon his knees ho fell ; Luigi'a head lie lifted. It fell back. " 'The man is dead '.' lie cried. The monks in wild confusion bore The body swittl} thiougli tho cloister door. Koine women shrieked and fainted ; and tho crowd Went surging from tho church with murmurs loud. Noun taw but me ono white and anguished face, Kaii- ,is a broken lily in ita gr.ico— Luigi's bride. With klow unfaltering feet And a composure, deathly calm ami sweet, Mio walked the long and columned aisles, nor boro More heavily than »ho had borne before Upon her father's arm.
