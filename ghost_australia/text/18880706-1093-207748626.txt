COMMERCIAL. Advertiser and Chronicle Offioee, Thursday evening, July 5, Money Mabkex, Business is much interrupted by the break in the cable, which was . as_ unexpected as it is ij unfortunate. The ghost of. a ohauce that the 1 misfortune isnot the act,-of God,"but" of the ; Queen'senemies, intensifies the anxietyrthatia ,! felt in regard to it'apd just; gives everybody ' that excuse for not completing busineBB trans- ' actions, which always brings about a dull market, whenever, it iB.ayaitable,. In the event of war money would at ;pnqe rie .deare?, and bo would moBt of; our-bp.hwbdijiea, qf import, whilst our Bt»plg)ex]>&&jWohiapossibly; be considerably reduced-iri value, higher freights would rule, insurances* would be very much increased by ''war risks," and any rise, in wheat Bay, at ljomp Vorild be msconnted by the coat, of ',getyhg'( it. these. Wqol would BuSer: in pjrice, too, and taking. a broad view of the whole question wa doubt ; whether, from a pounds, shillings, and pence ? point of yiew, it would mot be muchbetter for ; South AuBtralia to pray for .peace iri'qur time ; rather than for "the old cry of a hloqdy war. I Writing of wool suggeBtB; the .'question of the ! '88 leases which were aoldi last week, The i purchasers of these leases will, as Boon- as they ; get possession, help to improve trade, for jnubh I labor will" be employed apd iaany improve- j ments will be effected.. The-original' holders f of the leases,^who; have got the country back \ again will be able to sab to work with their, im-s provements at once, and we have certainly a i "right to lookjformuch assistance to our "labqr market from this source. The value ofjthe j pastoral industry to Australasia is fre- i quently very much-underrated, especially j in South Australia, ' where of late , yearB:the agricultural interest has been domi riant, According tplate returns thepe are 9ti,.009,0Q0 Bheep in Australasia, ad it is reason able to' assume that wheri :f®e results ^ of the lambing are, added", there, j will "be 100,000,000 sheep, -The wool df this large flockwill be worth on an average; say £20,000,000 a. year, and every, rise or fall of Id, a.pound will make a difference of over £2,000,000, These;are big figures, and Bhow most ; conclusively, that whilst we are thankfal for golden harvests the "golden fleece" is still the fit emblem of these favored lands. 'By how. many could this number be increased if South; Australia were stocked up, arid this iB. boim'd to >coma before many years are over. Mr, Stock has given a notice of motion imthe Houbb- which is. in the right direction,- and which has been frequently advocated' in these columns. He wants, to place, the Sayings Bank .in a position to lend inore of its money on mortgage, and it is' to be hoped that he will emphasise the necessity for lending in &mall; sums, so that holdem of small properties may be able to pro cure loans without the enormous expenses for commissions and legal charges to which they are now frequently put. A small borrower in a greedy agent's bands has to pay a fearful interest for the money he gets when the in cidental charges are taken into account. "Will Mr. Stock rise superior to the instincts of the lawyer, and show himself a disinterested member of Parliament? It is to be hoped so. The Bank of Adelaide is at laBt about to blossom out with a London agency, and with branches in the other colonies. The; Bank of Sonth Australia has already sought a shave of the business of the other colonies, so we 'shall now have no purely local bank confining its buBinesB to South Australia, The experiment of having all the eggs in one basket has not answered, Ebeadstdets Market, There is not much business doing in wheat.

Oldham & Son report on July 5: —Money.—So far as mortgage investments are concerned but little has been done during the past week. Suitable- securities are not coming forward in anything like the number required or expected," consequently funds are accumulating, and .there is abundance in the the. market awaiting investment on Al free hold mortgages. Our returns this week show .a falling off- consequent on so few securities coming to hand; the prin cipal business doing of late being the arranging of renewals of those mortgages current and now falling in, which is numerous cases are arranged at lower rates of interest. The breaking of the cable has not up to the present interfered to any extent with monetary, affairs, although it has caused inconvenience in commercial circles by7 the non-receipt of messages as' to the tone of the different markets, thereby causing a certain amount-of speculation to be indulged in. Interest rates remain unchanged, the majority of loans of late arranged being at 6 per cent, Land.—The past week has been dull and threatening, sd far as the weather is conoerned, with but little rain falling, the latter now being wanted in many placeB. But few farming.-properties are now changinghands. Therehas,however,beenagreat demand for land in the hundred of Wokurna during the past few weeks, and we know of several leases having been disposed of at very Batisfactory.priceB,. ^ This is mainly due to the Beetaldo waterworks, ..the main :from which now runs through thehundred, and thereby overcomes the great-drawback- to' that part of the country. City properties and good private dwelling-houses are still being enquired fori and sales continually, take place. Melbourne capitalists are still in the market, and shortly we expect to hear of some very satisfactory sales of suburban syndicate land. Insolvency.
