The Molong: Seat. The following appears in the Australian Stab of Tuesday last: — Molong, Tuesday. — Tbcro is considerable amusement here over free-trader M'Kcnna, the Coroner and Re turning-officer, challenging Dr. Uoss, M.L.A., to resign. It is a wonder the freetraders ore not natinfied. as thev have been beaten everv election for tbe last 13 or 15 years. The Coroner objects to Dr. Ross' ' History of the Molong Hospital,' which appeared in the Mou-no Anous some time back, and invites the doctor to settle the matter at tbe ballot box. The idea is very funny, and is treated by the protectionists with contempt. 'There is not a ghost of ft ebance ci the freetraders ever winning the Molong seat, which has always been a protectionist one, and since the land tax cams into eiistenco It is plain thut at the next general eleation protection will have ft 10 to 1 majority over free-trade. [We suppose ' M'Kcnua,' neanis Kinna.— Ed. Auqus.]
