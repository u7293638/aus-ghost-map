THE TOWN OF BABYVILLE. It's the dearest town, the fairest town, the prettiest town to me, Of all the towns in all the lands, this side or 'cross the sea; It's sunshine there, and moonshine there, and starshine all the time, And it's never cold, and none get old, in its lovely summer clime: There's never a ghost or goblin there, and sin was never known, And no one ever felt a pang or heard a neigh bour groan, And the birds sing alway, night and day-in fact, they're never still. In this airy. fairy, darling place; the Town of Babyville. The shops are full of sweetmeats, and they're sold for just a song, The hobby horses in the streets are free the whole day long: The band plays every afternoon, there's fire works every night, And all the babies toddle out to see the glorious sight. You kIiss them as you meet the'm, and they kiss you when you go, And clap their hands, and laugh with glee, to see you at their show; The doctor died last summer, and is resting o'er the hill. For none get sick, they haven't time, in the Town of Babyville. -"Bradford Observer.".
