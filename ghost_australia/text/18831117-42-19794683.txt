THE CUP DAY. The meeting was brought to a conclusion on Saturday, and though the attendance of the public was not so large as on the preceding day. yet it was still very considerable for the second day of the meeting, and the results of the takings both at the gates and at the totalisators cannot fail to be satisfactory to the club. His Excellency the Governor and suite again graced the course with their presence, remaining till after the Selling Race had been decided. The racing throughout tho day was interesting and exciting, for though thero was only one close finish—namely, in the Brisbane Handi cap—yet, with the exception of tho Mares' Produce Stakes, not one of the events could be considered as a foregone conclusion, as the non-favourites hod, except in the Cup and Produce Stakes, a bit tho best of it The only thing which occurred to mar a most pleasant day's sport was the accident to Mr. James Williams in the Ladies' Bracelet Race, who came into collision with the quarter-mile post, breaking it clean off, and receiving such injuries to his leg and knee as will probably confine him to his bed for some weeks. It must bo esteemed fortunate that the accident resulted in nothing worse, for, as far as can be gleaned from those best en titled to credence, Mr.Williaras.on Emblem, was following on the track of Lucilla and Kettle breeks, with another horse slightly ahead on his outside. Emblem, who was pulling two double, was coming up fast, when it was said that the rider of the horse in question called out to Mr. Williams that he would be on the post, and instead of keeping his proper track, or even pulling out, was the cause of this unfor tunate accident. The riding of the amateur jockeys was of the most eccentric description, crossings and recrossings having occurred beyond number, and a little knowledge must indeed be esteemed a dangerous thing when amateurs in the pigskin try to put into prac tice all tho artifices of the turf which are at any rate only resorted to by professional jockeys of a rather shady reputation. If these occurrences had not taken place, the race itself would have been a great success, for the whole nine horses coloured on the card came to the post, and the welter weights put a set on the much - fancied My Love and Adamantea, leaving Blazeaway to win easily from Inglesides, his opponent in tho Hurdle Race, the third place being filled by the lightly-weighted Kettlebreeks. The dia mond bracelet thus goes to Mrs. Callaghan, the ruby bracelet to Miss M'Donald, and the neat and suggestive third bracelet—gold with platina bit and horseshoe clasp—to Mrs. Power. Curiously enough, Blazeaway was so little fancied by the public that his backers received £11 for their investment of 10s. The first race of the day—the Marcs' Produce Stakes—was started punctually to time, and though it was regarded a certainty for the Derby winner, yet out of a total of 510 tickets no less than i4O were taken on Capitulator, who was thought to have a better chance over a railo and aqtiarter, and had besides the advantage of Watty Black lock in the saddle. Tickets to the number of 76 were also taken on Oliveria, but neither had the ghost of a show with Wheatmeat, who, moving like a piece of machinery, won just as he liked by half-a-dozen lengths. The next race, the Brisbane Handicap, brought eight horses to the post, the most fancied being Gipsy King, Satirist, and Adventure in tho order named. First Water, 7st. 10lb., who was spotted as the probable winner when the weight* appeared, was an absentee. Mr. Finnic also declined to statt Goldfinder, •Jut. 81b., and the fortunes of the all yellow were entrusted to Runaway, who, even with only Gat. 121b., proved unworthy of confidence. Gipsy King bolted, as on the previous clay, and Satirist apparently had matters all his own way, coming up the straight pulling hard, but on being tackled by Pilot, who came with a sudden run, he chucked it up in the most unmistakable style as soon as he was nsked to try, leaving his opponent to win by half-a-length. This is not the fimt by many times that he has proved himself a veritable coward, for though he possesses rare pace he invariably shows the white feather when the whips come out, and leaves his backers in the hole. The dividend paid by the totalisator on this ovent was the best of the day, each Pilot ticket receiving £20175. The incidents of the Ladies' Bracelet Race have been already touched upon, and on its conclusion little time wa3 lost in weighing out the riders for the Prince of Wales Cup. Six horses only came up to time, the absentees being Hippy, Fairy Queen, Vestal, Gipsy King, Capitulator, and Oliveiia. Tho Cup candidates paraded as usual on the lawn, and none were more admired than Wheatmeat and Rioter, who both looked in the pink of condition. Mus Medora had suspicious-looking bandages on, while . Hamlet appeared in far from good condition. The result of the race was never in doubt, for Wheatmeat, who was admirably ridden by young Devaney, came to tho front when asked, Bettled Rioter in a few strides, and won with the greatest ease in 3min. 44sec, a task which ho probably could have accom plished with another 141b. on his back. Legacy, who was ridden by Sullivan instead of C. .Jones, showed to no greater advantage than in the Purse, while the running of Medusa was even worse. It is certainly the worst month in the year for marcs, and to the pro verbial fickleness of the sex the failure of tho sometime cracks must be assigned. Hamlet, who finished a good fourth, ran remark ably well considering his condition, and though under no circumstances could he have beaten Wheatmeat at the weights, yet a distance of ground is evidently his forte, and he will doubtless see a better day. The large number of 118 C tickets were taken on this event—393 on Wheatmeat, 311 on Rioter, 172 on Legacy, 117 on Medusa, 114 on Miss Medora, and 79 on Hamlet. The Wheatmeat tickets returned £1 78., so that the odds were about 7 to 4 against his winning. The Selling Race only produced five starters by far the most fancied being Mr. Jost's Khedive, who was to be sold for £10, and con sequently had tho feather weight of Ost. 131b. in the saddle. King of the Ring was also a good deal fancied, but Khedive ran off the course and the King stood no chance with Kettlebreeks, who won easily at the finish. There were nothing like so many entries as usual for the Forced Handicap, only nine sub mitting their names to che handicapper, who weighted them aa follows :— Of these the pen was quickly passed through the names of Goldfinder, Rioter, My Love, Wheatmeat, and Kettlebreeks, leaving only Legacy, Vestal, Blazeaway, and Pilot to face the starter. Of these Legacy was at once made a great favourite, but the good thing did not come off, as Vestal, who was well and patiently ridden by Brightwell, won comfort ably with something in hand, in 2rain. 17sec. After the conclusion of the Selling Race, Kettlebreeks, the winner, and Satirist were submitted to auction by Mr. Savory, but no satisfactory offers being received, both were passed in. The following are the details of the racing :— Mares' Produce Stakkb. a sweepstakes of 7 BOVB. each from starters, 100 soys. added; for then throe-yoar-olds; colts.

Gipsy King then went to the front, but bolted soon afterwards, leaving Hippy with the lead. At the half-mile post Satirist showed in front with a slight lead of Hippy and Ad venture. Coming round the turn for home Satirist increased his lead, and coming up the straight looked all over a winner, when Pilot, who had been grcdually passing his horses, came with a great ruah, and catching Satirist in the last few yards won by half a length.

At the half-mile the top weights were disposed of, and at the quarter- mile Emblem, who was going great guns, was cannoned by another against the post with great force, knocking it down and severely injuring Mr. Williams. At the turn for home Blazeaway put in his claim, and was never headed, winning easily from Inglesidea and Kettlebreeks, who were second and third, My Love fourth, the pony Lucilla being fifth, and Pastime last.

At the hulf-raile post Miss Medora, Legacy, and Medusa were leading, Wheatmcat still being lost. Coming round the turn Rioter came up, pulling double, and passing the stand the first time was slightly in front, with Miss Medora and Legacy his immediate attendants. This order continued till the back of the course, when Miss Medora was beaten, and Wheatrneat commenced to draw up to the leaders, passing Legacy at the half- mile post, and raced Rioter for tho lead. At the turn for home Rioter was beaten, and Whoatmeat, drawing away, won easily by six length*l, Rioter being second and Legacy third ; Ham let, close up, fourth. Time, 3min. 44see.
