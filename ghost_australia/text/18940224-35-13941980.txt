I OLD WORLD GOSSIP. (FB01I OUlt COttlLESrONDENT.) LONDON, JAV. 19. Politically this ha« boon a doai week Thore has boon a little »peoch-nmking, espe- cially from Unionist platforms, but the great majority of our politician» aro dis- posed to rest, and bo thankful for their Bhort holiday There w a oortam faint gbmraor of interest a« to how far tho Lord« will maul the Parish Counoil« Bill, but a« a matter of fuot everybody is tired of the long-drawn-out controversies of the prosont «esnion, the moro particularly because it is recognised that tho very beginning of next session will seo the recommencement of party warfare on a scale which must almost mcvitably drive things to a crisis We shall, perhaps, not liavo to wait for tbo great moasiircs which the Government havo promised to bring tin« about Before all must como the Budget, and I doubt whothcr a Budgot has over been anticipated with greater intorest and curiosity Uneasy, indood, must ho the head of tne Chancellor of the Exchequer just now I havo in a previous lot'or pointed out tlio difficulties which Sir William Harcourt has to encouuter, but, worao than tins, he now kaows boyond n doubt from overwhelming pnvato and publio loprcsoutations which have boen mado to him that bo is oxpeeted to overcome all theso difhoultie« at a bound by tho production of n Budgot moro rovolutionnrv thun ativ thing which ha« been heard of »ince the great Budgets of 3Ir Gladstone's primo When Sir William Harcourt was first mado Chancellor of the Ex- chequer, everybody laughed, becauso among tho many gifts of tho " doughty knight" nobody had thought of ineliidiujr tho mastery of financo His last year's Budgot, tho main- spring of whioh was tho addition of a penny to the locomo tax, waa hardly n stroke of goulus but now comes hi« opportunity Tlio Radicals have demanded nothing less than a remodelling of the succession duties a graduated lnromo tax, and a taxation of land values to tnke the plnco of grants in aid of 1 «al rat>s-a pro- gramme whioh I behovo after somo little inquiry, w ould bo ovca populur with n large sootion of tlio middle class, which is usually conservative It is a gterantio task, howovor, fully worthy to take raak with tho other gigantic undertakings of tho present Govcrnmenr, and the question is, "Will Sir William ho equal t» It?" 51 Waddington did not long «urvivo hi« resig- nation of the po^ of Ambassador at tlio Court of St James's If tho truth must be told, ho ha« been in Ins last vears somew hat of a hunted mun Solong a« an) thing like genuino good foelrag prevailed between England and Tramo ho wa« a thoroughly trusted servant of tho Tionoh Re- public and many were the services which ho ren- dered in smoothing over causes of diplomutio irri- tation between tho two countries But the absurd Anglophobia which has tor- mented our neighbours of late yoars made him tho victim of suspicions an irri- tating us they wore ill-founded M Wad- dington was not morolv an Englishman by descent, but, as I took occasion to point out at the time of his lesignatiou, he had about him tho ap- pearance tho bealing, and the general manner« of a typical Briton Powerfully built, with a sonor- ous voice and a free, vigorous carriage, he might huve been taken at any timo foi what, to all intent« and purpose« ho actually wa«, an English gentleman, trained according to the athletic ideal« of our Pnbho schools and Uni vusittcs His rather formal manaor and measured (.peech, tho nbsenco of emotion and gesticulation, tho vory out of lu« moustache and muttou-ohop whiskers woro Eng- lish r ithcr than Trench Yet, outsido his love of athletics, I behove ho was m his «) mpathic« a Trcuchmou to the backbone At leist m private conversation ho was never tired of upholding Trench a« agaiast English ideals in mtelleottml and social matter«, and ho was especially proud of his own country'« pre-emincuoa in the fino arts It i« quito certain that ho uever took nnything but a Trench view of tho great cause of diplo ?íatic rivalry between the two countries-the occupation of Egypt But tho moro fact of his Lnerlish associations mode him a constant target of ill-niturcd asporaions by tlio Chauvinist« of the Trench cnpital, and he was praotically driven into resigning his post at St James'« Tortunately, there is no need to at tributo his somewhat prema- turo death directly to cansos of mental irritation To outward appoarunco, at all events, ho was not a man who worued much, nnd it is known that for somo timo past ho has been suflering from dia- betes But his end carno much sooner than wa« expeoted There is a renewed movoineat on foot just now for the preservation of tho old city churches, many of which havo bo much interest from an anti- quarian point of MOW Tbo danger which threatens their oventual extermination lies in the fact that thoy havo no congregations-a drawback even to such rcspeotablo edifices It l« not so long ago that I dropped into one of tho larger chnrche« on a Sunday-a church with 600 or 700 eittmgs and found the attendance to consist of five person« bcsido tho pewopouor, aud those fivo pi rsons, for all I kno », may have consisted of officials or dopcadanta of tho church This wa« ut a time, perhaps, when tho city is moro than ordinarily deseited, but tho congregation, after all, was not vorj luuoh below tho average A oonsus was takor ou two succeisive Sundays in tho course of last year of 12 out of the "¡0 or 60 city ohurohc« 1 ho largest congregation wa« 45, and tho lowest 10 It is, of course, a «implo mooker) that tho Church Sorvico should, Sunday after Sunday, bo gono through undor such conditions, and it is felt to bo a orusl scandal that the olorgy inon who "minister" to theso infinitesimal coagregotions «heuld, in many cases, draw largo stipends, whilo tho men who aro slavinc: dar after day in tlio crow dod slums of the oatt aud south of London ate scarcely paid enough to keep «km and bono togetlior Some of the hardest worked of the London clergy, indeed, could not live at all but for their privnto purse« oi tlio assistanco of fricada The city is vory slow to moyo in such mattera, but oven amoag city mon thcro is a widespread feeling that tho scandal has e/ono far enough, and it is a remarkable indication of the desperate fashioa in vvhioh we ohng to our old institutions that a tooioty should havo sprung into existence which lights ngainst every reform, oven when it originates withm tho Church itself Tram nu architectural point of view, of coiiiso, the churohes are interesting, bo- onun« tho nnmo of Wren is associated with vory many of thom , but somo aro ugly and uninter- esting enough to mont their doom on this account alono Those which are worth keeping might, «o the reformers think-according to the plan already adopted in some cases-be pulled down and re ereoted m crowded districts, where thoy would bo of uso, or oven in tho more distant suburbs, whoro "city mon" now dwell, for tho benefit of whoso forefather« tho churches woro built, at a timo when tbo merchants and big tradesmen of London were not too proud to dwell over thoir shops or bosido their warehouses A good man) book« havo been written dealing with almost ovory branoh of British trado and commerce Perhaps nomo obliging goatleman of original rcsoaroh will one day bo good enough to traoe tho rise and progress of tho " rings " which in these day« constitute in the eye« of the average householder the moat remarkable, not to s») tho most terrifying, feature of our businoss life It ia now two moaths sinco tho great coal striko ended, and yet it is a fact that coal« in London remain nt famine prices-a good 10 per cent abovo what they ought to bo If you ask your coal merchant what is tho explanation of it, ho replies mysteriously that it ia due to the " after olleot« " of the strike Auk the unfortunate patcr famihaa who findB 33« or 34s a ton rather too much to pav for so-called Wallsend-w hioh ho know« is not Wallsend or anything like it-and he murmur« confidently, though net quito resignedly, "the Bing " Thero is a coal ring, just as there is a moat ring and a fish ring In the glut of English meat during tho drought of last summer, when the farmers were glad almost to give their sheep and cattle awav/ to anyone who asked for thom, the butchers' ring in London managed, for the Baku of tho principle, I suppose, to provent moat from dropping a halfpenny in tho pound, although tons of beof aud mutton wcro goiug bad in tho Central Meat Market, which tho poor con- sumer would havo boon glad enough of if he could havo obtained it at rcnxonnble prices The fish ring has a particularly long and successful history The prioo at whioh fish is hold aron m the po.roet suburbs of London, compared with the price it fetches at the coa&L; towns, is propostorous Taking ono thins* with another, it is as dear as moat The Baroness Burdott-Coutta years ago entered into conflict with the fish ring, and is supposed to havo spent something like £60,000 m a vam attempt to got for tho London poer fish at roally loasonablo prioes The mídalo olass householder in London ofton gets ovor tho difficulty to seme oxtent bj becoming Ins own purvoyor on a small soalo nnd lmving peda of fish sent him direot from Grimsby «r Great Yar- mouth This of course means u good deal of VA asto Ho cannot import his coals on a similar scale, and he-and still moro tho working man, who has to buy his coals by tho hundredweight suffers accordingly. In the present caso the ring uro mainly holding «n from a suspicion that when the " R.sebory truce " is endod thoro muy be fresh troubles, and if BO tho publio will probably got coals cheap again just as tho oold weather goes and there is loss need of them A dinner of the Thirteen Club took place last Saturday, which had, at all ovont«, tho attraction «f u great deal of eccentricity in its arrangements The Tlnrteon Club was formed some years ago for the purpose of upsetting the minor sort of popular superstitions , but of late not muoh has boon heard of it Tho publicity giren to the proceedings at tho dinner, however, along with their extremely original charaoter, has re- awakened public interest in the dub There wcro 13 tables, at each of which 13 duieis sat down Tho knives and forks were all crossed, tho salt-cellars were in tho shape of cofhns, with grarodiggors' shovols for Bpoons, and bronzo e&gics; of that unlucky bird, tho pea- cock, decrated the room The guests passed into the dining-room under a ladder, and as many crosB-eyed waiters as woro t» be pot togethor cross-oyos being proverbially ill-omened-waitod on tho chairman and tho principal guests Green, being the unluoky colour, was largoly displayed, oven grcon ncoktios being worn , and thero wero death's-heads and skeletons everywhere, even in the buttonholes of tho conviva To break a looking glass brings one seven years of ill-luck, so overy diner had a small mirror before him, winch he broke after dinner, while instead of Inking wino togothor the company spilled salt with one another Thero aro a, good many people who thimk that, in theso days of general incredulity, the Thirteen Club mi_»ht as well leave us a small remnant of these old-fashioned fancies However, it must bo admitted that theso small superstitions are \ ery widely spread evoa yet, not only among servant girls and pagob.ys, lint among maturo mon of the world It ii well known that the late Mr Parnell practically regulated Ins lifo by such minute observances Ho would no moro sign a dooumont to whioh there would ho only 13 muses than ho would think »f sitting down with 12 other pooplo, or »f commouoiag an im- portant enterprise ou a Friday Ho would oven, I um told, count the numbor of people entering a room, in ordor that he might not by anj accident be the thirteenth Thor» used to bo n member of Farhamcat, a lawyer, who would novor give notico of a resolution for Triday, although Friday pei haps is tho chief " private members' " day, and thero is a certaia distinguished raan«f letters who can never bo induced to begin a novel on a Trisluy Ho did so «nee against his own conviotions, and tho novel was, «f cauiso, a failure ' It was originally intended that tho Thirteen Club should dine ou a Friday, but they had to alter their arrangements I know a capable barrister, oao of the most prosaic men m tho world, most people w.uld think, who cannot heir eve. to see a c.uplo of quill pons crossed, and, if thoy are within his reach, will norvously uncross them , and ovorybody must havo in his acquuiatanco scores of pe.plo who belicvo, or half believe, that the advent of a black cat brings luok, or that a sturablo upstairs portends imp.rta.t cnsequeiiLes Tho London shooklaoK still spits for luck on tho first pi.nny he cams ia the day, and I havo heard of servants in the country giving their mistresses notion because tho household dog howled at uncanny times Of course, if you ask educated peoplo whether they really believe in these omens, tiley will answer " No " in an uneasy way, but they will still coatinue to aot qiuto as if did One or two of tho intending guests at the Thirteen Club shirked ¡r.ing at tho last moment, and moro than one went undor tho fateful ladder with a whtte face and an obviously quiokcned pulse A nowplay, callod " Tho Charlatan," has been produced by Mr Beerbohm Tree at tho Hay- market. It is by Mr Robert Buchanan, and is up to date at all events m one respect It deals with the prevailing thcosophical and spiritualistio crazes, the Charlatan being a theos.phio marvel maker wh», by means of his trickery, wins tho affections of the heroine of tho play away fr.m her betr.thed Tho piece is, by general c.nsent, well acted , bnt there is a good deal of difference of opini.n as t» its merit« as a play The de- nouement is certainly unsatisfactory and rather leeble A now experiment m theatrical enterprise is being tried at the Opera Cemique A " Taree Svndicnto, Limited," has been formed, which premises to make a specialty of a partikular kind of cirnmutio entertainment which geaorally draws good audiences if only it has navclry and " go " enough This can hardly be Bald to bo tho caso with tho threo-aot farce tried this week, called " Uncle's Ghost " This, significantly enough, also deal, with spiritualism, tho very substantial ghost «f Undo be ng raised by tho orthodox means adopted at the regulation seance It now only remains for Mr W S Gilbert to write a comic opura dealing with thcosophy and spiritualism, as ho did with tho testhetia craze, to keop the London theatre-goer amply amused, or, at all events, occupied with the d.mg. of Mr Stead aad his friends
