A Kalgoorlie-Boulder Tramway. THERE is a strong party of capitalists in London prepared to construct an electric tramway between Kalgoorlie and the Boulder, and for some time Mr N. Ksenan, the solicitor, has been endeavouring to obtain the consent of the Government for the laying of the rails. We understand that Mr John Davies, the general manager of railways, is opposed to any concession being granted on the ground that it will interfere with the railway now in course of construction between Kalgoorlie and the Boulder by way of Mt Charlotte. As the proposed tramway would run direct from the • Kalgoorlie railway station to the Boulder townsite there is not much chance of it seriously affecting the railway, and as threepenny fares are proposed it is obvious that the promoters are more sanguine than the ordinary run of Britishers who have money to invest in these fields. A private Act of Parliament would, of course, be necessary, and if the Government were opposed to it the promoters would not have a ghost of a chance of obtaining the concession. With regard to the Kalgoorlie-Boulder railway, there can be no doubt that its construction was both expedient and necessary. Because of this the Government were justified in builiing the line without first obtaining the sanction of Parliament, and if they find that the line is insufficient for the passen traffic, or unsuitable because of its circuitous route, they could either build a tramway out of the public puree or hand the concession over to the Municipality of Kalgoorlie and the people o£ the Boulder. We do not favor private enterprise ia railway or tramway construction, and in face of the fact that Kalgoorlie and the Boulder will in a few days be joined by a railway, it would be as well if the subject of the tramway were left in abeyance for the present. Leather money circulated in Russia so recently as the time of Peter the Great.
