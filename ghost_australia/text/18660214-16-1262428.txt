Arrival.—A steamer by the South Passage at 4.30 p.m. The Bayswater was to an anchor under the Cape this morning ; but at 2.20 p.m. she got under weigh, and worked into the bay. The steamer reported in sight to the south- east this forenoon was a vessel leaving by the South Passage. She is most probably the Lady Bowen. Departure.—Cawarra, s., for Sydney, at 7.15 a.m. IPSWICH STEAMERS.-The Ipswich, from the A.S.N. Co.'s wharf, at 7 o'clock ; tho Settler, from Raff's wharf, at 8 o'clock ; and the Emu, from the Q.S.N. Co.'s wharf, at half-past 8 o'clock this morning. The Lady Young, s., leaves for Sydney at 7 o'clock this evening. The Diamond, s., went down to the bay yes- terday, and returned late in the evening. When she left the bay the Bayswater, ship, from Kep- pel Bay, was visible working up to the anchor- age. The Helen S. Page, barque, was alongside the Great Victoria, s.s., transhipping coals, and the Platypus, s.s., was also at that vessel re- ceiving railway plant. The Gem, schooner, was at Luggage Point, and the Pioneer at the bal- lasting quarry, and barque City of Melbourne was lying near Bulimba. The Gem, schooner, went down the river yesterday to load timber at Coochie Mudloo. She will take a cargo of sawn cedar from the mills of Mr. Smith on the Logan River. Mr. E. Monk, the shipwright and boat builder of South Brisbane, will launch the schooner yacht Hamlet's Ghost from his yard to-day, at high water. The Hamlet's Ghost is the property of the Hon. G. Harris, and has been for some time undergoing alterations and improvements under the superintendence of Mr. Monk. The Nowra, paddle steamer, which was im- ported from Sydney, some time ago, by Captain Smith, has changed hands recently for the sum, we believe, of £2100. Messrs. J. and G. Harris are the purchasers, and they intend to employ her forthwith in the bay and river trade. Cap- tain Major, of the Amy, s.s., who is well and favorably known on the river, from the length- ened period he has held command of her, has been appointed to the Nowra by her new owners ; and he will doubtless sustain the repu- tation he has so well earned as a steady and efficient master. We learn from Captain Bolt that the fire which broke out in the galley of his ship, the Earl Russell, on Sunday night, has caused only a trifling amount of damage, namely, the burn- ing of a few boards in the galley roof. The fire originated through the carelessness of the cook in not cleansing the flue of the stove. Captain Bolt has desired us to express his thanks to the gentlemen who so promptly came to his assistance on the occasion. From Captain Yeo we learn that he fell in with tho Tiparn Lightship, about 3 o'clock on Saturday afternoon. She had broken from her moorings at daylight on Thursday morning, and since then had been adrift. Sho had been living the distress signal, and two or threo vessels had passed within a few miles of her, but the signal was not observed, or was taken no notice of. Although sho had been drifting for three days, she was only about five miles from her original position when the steamer carno up. As soon ai Captain Yeo ascertained the nature of the accident that had befallen her, ho cast anchor, and the steamer immediately afterwards had some damage dono to her larboard quarter by swinging to her anchor and cJming into colli- sion with the light- vessel, Car>tnin Yeo lost no timo in towing tho light-vessel hack to her former position.-,S.
