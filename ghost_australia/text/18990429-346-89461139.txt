'■ To -vff.} How to Ah<::-:P-7.u:." Candle I"V.vf.::.—The candle power of a light may be- ^-certair.ed in the f(iHc>-.v:r:g i:;r.r>ner :—Take a white paper disc, ana vnfike a grea«e spot in the middle of it. If this paper be held between the eye and a light, the grease sp*t v.-ill be lighter than the paper which is free from grease, and if the light be between the eye and the paper, the grease spot will be the darker. The rays r.f light passing through the grease spot are the cause of this. Xow. when the light ok either side of the parer is of frjual intensity, the grease spot is in visible, and by moving lights of different intensities on either side until the spot be c-nies invisible, the relative intensity -»i such lights is calculated. Thus : If a candle be placed ou 0:10 side and a lamp on the ether. ai;d their positions be altered until the spot is invisible, their relative intensity mr.y he computed by ascertaining 'he distance of each iron";.the diss. Then, by the " law o: Inverse .Sncarc-.=," which tells us that l: the intensity c.-f" light varies inversely as the S'i^aie of the d'stance:" if the caudle were .found to Vie one foot from the ilisc and the. law>}>. to be three feet, it would follow that the- light ."if the lamp wa~ Kin- times as powerful as that -f the caudle ; or. if >he l?tap 'were four feet distant, 115 times as powerful, and s.<> ou. alv.'ays remen-berine to square the distance.
