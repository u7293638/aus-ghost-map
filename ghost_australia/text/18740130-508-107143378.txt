' O, dear mamma, 1 have iiotkibg to do with' them !' cried Isabel, .amused. ' This Dr. Jttornaywe met one' day at, the Kearneys, at Korth Shore ; and certainly it is very old, 1 .don't know that 1 have thought of him. from ?Stoat day to this, but Miss Terry's song brought Kim quite before me. hie voice and his look and all.' ' ' 'Is he handsome?' half whispered 'Amelia Jolly.^rho hal risen, cuying she must prepare for her ride hone. ' Jlfib, Issy, is be handsome? , because once I saw— ? — ' , 5That MisB Jolly eaw.aid nrt transpire, for her brother interrupted her '% urging {expe dition, and Kate offered to help her to dress,. rather in a fit of perversity^ and because poor Tom had came up in the last vaim hope of . having a few words. ;,' Soon the sound of the . horseB' feet were heard clattering down_the road. The rest of the party stood in .the verandah looking at Jthe 4-rilliant. .unspeakably calm light from . tbe stars. Bats we're whirling, heavily in rapid flight around their heads. The clustering passion-flowers waved gently , to and fro. Mr. Farrant, Miss Terry, and Sate, went out to take a turn';' Isabel remained where she was. It was very quiet. , But the song echoed still in her ear. It was the first really good music elie had ever heard. . Something within was . stirred — something she could not express -weighed upon her, partly pain, partly pleasure She strove to rally herself, feeling half ashamed ' at the new emotion ; and, when presently her father came into the room, and finding no one there, stepped out to where1 she was, she put her arm into his, and stooping kissed his hand. ' ' What is it, child? What ails ye P' he ? asked, struck with something unsual about his child.- ?- ? ' 'Nothing 1 nothing at all, daddy ! 1 have been thinking ; that's alL' 'Thinking, truly! Don't doit, issy dear. Take my1 advice, and 'never be-wthat1 you call ' thinking.' Action is tbe thing.. Thinking is the ruin of half the men and three .parts of the ?women.' . '???''. 'Is it? Well, but bow can one help it, after hearing muBic ?' ' What has inuBic to do with thinking, eh, . girl? Bless yon, music is the best of all things to set one off, lead one to battle or anything — just the contrary of ' thinking.' By the way — there has been a terrible row again about that girl, Nelly. It seems Venn is sweet upon nor.1 ' Venn! -O papa, don't let him have her !' 'Why not? A capital good thing for her.' ' I can't bear him. Besides she is promised already.' . 'Gammon! Promised! She hasn't two ideas in her head, and yet for the sake of a pair of innocent blue eyes and a sweet voice, all the men in the place are making the m selves fools about her ! They say she ran away from her step-mother, and was found in Lynch's hut. Tae Macleans are furious.' ?- ' That woman does treat her miserably. 1 ?wish you would let Lynch marry her. He is very fond ef her papa.'' ' I'll grant no such a favour to him. He . deserves a .flogging at this moment, for an insolent, sulky brute as be is. Now, Issy, don't be encouraging such ,: notion, for I am poz— send for the ijiri, ' and tell lier to be Bteady and marry Venn. It is the best thing she can do.'' * So saying, they overtook the others, and Isabel was startled by one of her brothers jjnmping. out upon her from a bush. ? Passing an arm round h^r waist, he, considering that he had been silent enough, began a whole string of stories of alarms about bushrangers and ghosts. Mr. Warrant entered pleasantly into the strain, and told hi6 wonders too ;'till he laughingly declared, he muBtgo at once, or he should be afraid to ride1 home. Offers to remain the night were pressed upon him, but he persisted in being obliged to go,. Willie, charmed by 'bis stories, wa6. «o polite as to fetch his horse, and then go a little way to open tbe gate for him. He returned rubbing his bands in glee. ' A jolly fellow, isn't be P' O Willie! exclaimed Ms Bisters, ia horror at the epithet. ? ' I wonder does he come here courtinp ?'? the boy_ said, which set Kate off; and brought, upon himself a scolding, from Isabel, and a gentle reprimand from Miss Terry. The prayer-bell ringing, they all went in by the ?window. Ohaitee IV VINE LODGE. ' Really, my dear John,' said Miss Herbert, a morning or two after the visit from the Lang, ville party, ?? I think you osght to call on Mr ? Tesey, eh ?' 'Hem,' said Mr. Herbert, twisting his moustache, and then stretching himself after a diligent perusal of the Sgн Herald. J never pay morning visits;' he added pre sently. ? 'An, but you should. You ought to come forward here and take yonr proper place v besides, these are strangers and gentlefolks, and as we are, it eeenis, to. meet them at the Langs, it would be but civil, I do think, eh? ' ' They are not much in our style, I fancy; but, however, I IiaVe nothing very particular to do to-day, so shall we both ride there ?' Miss Herbert readily consented 'to accom pany him, and they were soon on their wuy to Vine Lodge. . * ; . t.' BtB' , vf**?
