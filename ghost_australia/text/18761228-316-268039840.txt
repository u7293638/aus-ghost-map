Seated at his parlour table he ordered his wife and children out of the room and addressed himself to business. While clamf^.L^^ 'lL^^f^irl^liiru thing that seemed to cling clammily to the skin like the caress of a naked oyster. Thoughtfully setting down the result of his addition so far as he had proceeded with it, he turned about and looked up. " I beg your pardon, sir,' said he, but you have not the advantage of my ac- : ', , „, , . ," Why, \ • Jake, replied - , , • the , appanUon- 1 i ' iav « " scribe-" don t you know me i I confess that your countenance is familiar," returned my friend, " but I cannot at this moment recall your name. 1 never forget a face, but names I cannot remember." , Jake , . !" rumbled the i i spectre j- j- with i., se- P»lohral dignity, a ook ol displeasure j crawling across his pallid feature*, joure , y(JU my wonl L ^ quite Be. rious.

The disembodied party sank uninvited \ f ^ spread out hi6 ^ees »nd blankly at a Dutch clock wuli an air of weariness and profound discouragement. Perceiving that his guest was making himself tolerably comfortable, my friend turned again to his figures, and silence reigned supreme. The fire in the g«te binned noiselessly witbia ^ ^ li ,, lt , c0 " 1 f ^ 2 r swung its pendulum with studied exactness, like one who is determined to do his precise duty and shun responsibility ; the cat assumed an attitude ot intelligent neutrality. Finally the spectre trained his pale eyes upon his host, pulled in a long breath, and remarked : "Jake, I'm yur dead father. I come back to have a talk with ye 'bout the way things is agoin' on. I want to know 'f you think it's right notter recognise yur dead parent ?" " It is a little rough on you, dear," replied the son without looking up, " but the fact'is that [7 and 3 are 10, and 2 are 12, and 6 are 18] it is so long since you have been akout [and 3 off are 15] that I had kind of forgotten, and [2 into 4 goes twice, and 7 into 6 you can't] you know how it is yourself. May I be permitted to again inquire the precise nature of your present business ?" " Well, yes—if you won't talk anything but shop, 1 s'pose I must come to ibe p'int. I say! you don't keep anything to drink 'bout yer, do yej Jake V" " 14 from 23 are 9—I'll get you something when we. feet done. Please explain | how we can serve one another." i " Jake, I done everything for you, and!j you ain't done nothin 3 for me s'nee I died. I want a monument bigger'n Dave Broderick's, with an eppytapii in gilt letters, by Joaquin Miller. I can't git into any kind o' society till I have 'em. . You've no idee how exclusive they are where I am." The dutiful son laid down his pencil, and effected a stiffly vertical attitude. He was all attention : '. ' " Anything else to-daly•'? ,, he iasked— rather sneeringly, I grieve to state. " " No-o-o, I don't think of any&ing; special,'' drawled (he ghost refledasray ; '"I'd like to have an' iron, fence around it to keep the cows off, but I s'pose tliat's included." : "Of course! And a gravel walk, and a lot of alabone shells, and feesb posies daily; a marblfe angel or two for company, and anything else, that'will add to your comfort Have you any dthei extremely reasonable'.request to make of me?" " Yes—since 3"ou mention & I want you to contest iriy wili. Horace Hawes is having liis'n contested?^ " My fine friend. you'3id hot make any will." • ' " That ain't o' no consequence. Yon forge me a good Wafi&ctaxt;^st tliat." " With pleasure, eir ; but Siat will be extra. Now indulge me in : ojde question. You spoke of the society whereyou reside. Where do you reside V" The Duteh clock pounded clamorously upon its bronze gong a comitless jnultitude of "hours ; tiie glowing coals iell like an avalanche through (he grate, spilling all over the eat, who exalted lier voice in a squawk like the de&ihw;&U; of a stack pig, and dashed aitrighted tliroiigh Hie window. A smell of scorching for per- Vaded the place, and under cover of It the aged spectre walked into tlie mirror: vanishing like a dream.
