THE ALL-ENGLAND ELEVEN T NE\T SOUTH WALES AND VICTORIA. (.IromOie Herald of friday0 Those who visited the Albert Ground yesterday must have coma to the conclusion before the stumps were drawn that the English team were tough cus- tomers to deal with Their defeat m the recent match against eighteen of kew South Wales no doubt tarnished their reputation in some degree, but their play on Thursday against the combined forces of this colony and Victona is a pretty strong proof that they are not to be estimated too cheaply The weather for two days pnor to the match, was fine, and the wicket« were m very good order The fielding ground had been well rolled, until it ap- peared as level as a hilliard table The attendance during the forenoon was comparatively meagre, and not up to the standard attendance of an intercolonial match , but dunng the afternoon the public arrived in considerable numbers, until they mcreised to something like 5800 Dunng the night a northerly wind set in, and when the game commenced, the temperature, even m the shade, was most oppressive The covered terrace afforded a welcome shelter to a great many people, but even there everj body was complaining of the heat In the Grand Stand there was a verj tolerable attendance, the fair sex making a strong muster The N ew South Wales Artillery Band were present on the ground, and played a se- lection of music during the day, although the majo rity of spectators would have preferred to hear the German Band As a description of the play will take up a considerable space, it will perhaps be better to forego a descnption of the amusements to *ie found on the ground outside the great event The following is a list of the players, viz - ALL-ENOLAND ELEVE"! Messrs W G Grace Messrs Gilbert G F Grace M'Intyre Jupp Lillywhite Greenwood Bush Humphery Southerton Oscroft Boult (umpire) THF COMBINED TEAM N S.Wales Victona. Messrs Thompson Messrs Cosstick Coates Cooper Hewitt Conway D Gregory Gibson Oliver Carr Pocock Loughnan Lawrence Tindall Bannerman Mr R Dnver, umpire. the play-first day. Messrs. W. G. Grace and Coates tossed fer the choice, and the English captain having been fortu- nate enough to win, decided on taking the wickets first The fifteen appeared in the field at a quarter past twelve o'clock, and were well received. W. G. Grace and Jupp were the first to face the bowling, Cosstick taking the first over at the southern end, the only result being a single each to the bats Coates commenced at the northern end, and Grace hit the first to the off for a double. Pocock at longstop let the last ball get to the fence, and four were added to the score for byes. Two maiden overs followed, and two singles off Coss- tick brought the score up to 19. Five singles and a double were scored from the following nine overs, and in the succeeding delivery from Sam, the great W. G.'s off stump was taken, amid considerable uproar Greenwood joined Jupp, the score then standing at 1-9-17. The over passed without scoring, and in the next six the runs went up to 20, both men playing steadily and the field wide awake. Green wood got a chance at Cossuck's next over, and made a very nice tip out of the reach of the long-stop for 4 Several singles were subsequently pit together , and Greenwood brought the score up to 30 with another tip for 4 behind the wicket For a long time after this the runs came so slowly that it would be I only wearisome to go into details, and, therefore, it would be sufficient to say that Greenwood and Jupp ran up the score by careful play to 50, when Conway relieved Cosstick at the bowling, Tindall, having pre- viously taken the ball from Coates at the other wicket Conway did not appear to be well on, and Jupp put his third ball in the slips and scored 3, D Gregory letting it get past A m iden over from Tindall followed, and in Conway^ next Greenwood got the last ball away to square-leg for a double Jupp scored along leg hit fore off Tindall and Greenwood again got Conwaj away to square-leg for 2 A | Single by Jupp off the Newtown bowler brought the score up to 60, and the spectators testified their ad- miration of the play in a most demonstrative manner. J ust before 2 o'clock Jupp added 2 to the score for a pretty rio to long-leg-off off Conway, and after a maiden had been bowled, the bell rang for luncheon, and the players retired. The game was resumed about an hour afterwards, Gibson taking the wicket in the place of Hewitt, and Cosstick relieving Con- way with fhe ball. It w83 anticipated that the ad- journment for luncheon would make a difference in the game, and the result justified such an anticipa- tion. Jupp, liter a fine innings for 24, was clean | bowled by Cosstick, and returned to the Pavilion, where he received around of applause. G.F.Grace j joined Greenwood, and almost immediately opened I his innings with asquare-leg hit for four (70 up), and | a hit to long-on for a similar figure off Cosatick. A pretty tip behind the wicket Ij Greenwood off > Cnïstfeit, find a ' fencer" to the off bj G I" off the Yorkahircirjun, with sei oral single«, b-ought tha flgur» up to 80 A few mmutej after the numbers went up, G F again let out at Coates, and sent him to the fence for 4, but the la»t of the over was a shaver Two singles were obtained off Cosstick's nett delivery, but Coates having bowled a milden, barn sent Greenwood's wicket down, and he letired for a well earned 28 3-28-88 Itmaj be as well to state here that the official score of Jupp and Gi een woods runs does not correspond with the figures taken bj the members of the Pi ess, who, on com- paring notes found that Greenwood had made 28 and Jupp 24 We therefore give oui own score Humphrey followed Jupp, and G F brought the score up to 90 with a square-leg hit off Coates for a double, followed b\ a tip to long-leg for four Huniphrej got a single off Cosstick, and Coates then disposed of Humphrey bj taking his middle stump (4-195) Oscroft, who joined G F , commenced with a tip for a single to short-leg off Co ite«, and made a cut for a similar figuie off Cos stick who, in his next over, took G F 'a off stump, (o 26-07 ) Grace plaj ed verj freeh, but his big hits, tor "he most part, were flukey Gilbert, who was pvidentlj suffering to some extentfrom the mjurj to his ankle received in the Bin le wicket match, went to the vacant crease, hut was not very long there when Coates enticed bim out with a judgment ball which got amongst the timbers (b-0-102 ) Ap- pearances were now dectdedlj in favour of the rest of the English team going out rapidlj , but the best batting display of the day was j et to come M'Intj re was the next man in, Oscroft having previocslj made a single off Coates, and a tip to long leg for four, off Cosstick "Sam," not liking the appearance of things, put in i teazer to Oscroft in the next over, which took his wicket (7-7 104) Lillj white fol- lowed, and the knowing ones now offered to make wigers us to the probnbilitj of the Eleven getting be^ ond 120, but it was soon evident that the hopefuls were holloaing before thej were out of the wood M'Intjre, after makmp his double, got on to Coates, sending the second ball to square leg for four. He gave a chance to Conwaj in the slip3 off the next ball, which was missed-the catch being a very low one A couple of singles by M'Intjre brought the score up to 110 A few minutes Inter M'Intyre, who was batting steadilj, with- out giving a ghost of a chance, again got an opening off the Yorkshireman, aad sent his last ball awaj for a pretty cut to the fence For the next nine overs nothing worth recording occurred, etcept that the score mcrea-ed to 120 M'Intyre subse- quently made a single and a square leg hit for four off Coates, and a hit for a quartette off Cosstick, which, with another single by Lillywlute, brought the figure up to 130 Another breik occurred soon after this, for when the score had been increased to 145 (M'Intyre haung mide two more fourers off Cosstick), Tindall, who had relieved Coates, took Lill j white's off stump 8 10 145 Bush was the ne\t man in, and be commenced with a single off Tindall In the same over M'Intjre puta balito the on and Bush to all appearance was run out, but when Gibson appealed, Boult, the English umpire, a tomshed everjbodj by giving it not out In the next over from Cosstick, M'Intjre got the third away to long-leg for four, and 1j0 i\ent up, the spectators applauding lustily. A couple of maidens followed, and M'IntjTe, after scoring a single off Tindall, I drove a ball from Conway (who had just relieved Co«stick) to the fence for four In the next over from Tindall, Bush, who hid not done anj thing to express his gratitude for the second life accorded to him by Boult, gave a catch to Thompson at long off, which Nat, nothing loth, accepted (9-l-lo7 ) Southerton was the last man in, but he did not shine at the wicket He however rendered good service b> keeping his timbers up, giving an opportunity of scoring to M Intjre, who was not slow to avail him- self of the chance whenever he got it " Mac"brought the «core up to 160 by a prettj cut for 4 off Con w ij 's, and in the next over from Tindall made a prettj cut for two, and a long leg hit for four to the fence 170 now went up, and thtre it stopped, for Souther ton in attempting a good square-leg hit, was nicelj caught by Carr M Intjre, after one of the finest piec°s of cncket ever witnessed on the Albert Ground, ciri led his bit out for E5, and on returning to the pa\ ilion was received with a burst of cheers The fielding of the combined team on the whole was very good-Cooper, Lawrence, Binnerman, and Oliver getting most of the work The wicket-keep ing of Hewett and Gibson was well up to the mark, and Pocock, although he let one or two bj at the commencement of the innings, wbs all there as long ptop for the rest of the daj Cosstick, Coates, and Tindall bowled excellenth, but Conway was not well on to the wicket Before giving the scoie, we may mention that in consequence of the voluntary retire- ment of Shendan from the New South Wales repre- sentatives, Oliver took his place I After ten minutes for refreshment which after the intense heat of the day was much needed, the Eleven took the field, and Nat Thompson and Dive Gregory appeared at the wickets to lead off for the combined team Southerton and Lillj white took the bowling Tbi, pur were bowling well, and verj few runs were obtained, both bitsmen plajmg steadily In thir- teen overs only eleven were scored, and in the next over from Lillj white Thompson went out to meet a ball, which be missed, and Bush bid his wicket down in a trtce 1-6-11 Gibson followed, and took the rest of the over, when the stumps were drawn We are unible to spire room for the description of the plaj on Fndaj and Saturdaj (the second and third daj s), but append the complete score of the match, as published bj the S M Hei aid of yestei daj, Monday - Al.t-Evcr.AND First linings W G Grace 1511131 b Cosrtick » Topp 11111121411111312 b Coarticlr 24 Greenwood 411121:42:41 b Costick 23 G F Grace 44111441 4 b Cosrticlc 36 Humphrey 1 b Cottes 1 Oscroft, 1114 b Coutick 7 Gilbert b Costes 0 M Intyre 341U41144U414I4141241 not out Si Lillywhite 1313111 b Tindall 10 Binti 1 o Thompson b Tindall 1 1 Soullierton c Carr b Conway 0 Byes 6 leg bye 1 wide 1 no ball 1 9 Tot«! ~ 17Ô Wickets fell thus -1 for 17 2 for 62, 3 for 88, 4 for 95, 5 for 97, b for 102, 7 for 104, 8 for 14o, 9 for lo7, 10 for 170 The Combined ATJSTn.Ai.iA> Team First lut mgs N Thompson 2211 at Buan b Lillywhite. 6 D Gregory 111214 runout 10 Gibson 1111111111111111 c andb Lillywhite le C Bannerman b Southerton 0 li B Cooper, 111131211111111 c Boah b Southerton l8 C Lawrence e Jupp b Lillywhite 0 C Oliver 13 b Lillywhite 4 Carr o Bush b Lillywhite 0 Conway 11111111 b Southerton 8 rococ*. 1221 b Lillywhite 6 Cosjticlt. 12114 rt.
