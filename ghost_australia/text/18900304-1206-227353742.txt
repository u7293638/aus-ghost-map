An Ocean Tragedy. \- Bt W. CLARK RUSSELL. CHAPTER XVIil. IS SHE THE "SHAKE?" IT iras not to prove a gale, though it would have been hard to guess what lay behind that dirty jumble of white and livid terraces which had been stealthilycreeping all the morning zenithwards. The clouds scattered to the rush of the wind, the sun with a brightened disk leapt from one flying vaporous edge to another, daroJing out the snows of the dissolving seas tall the eye reeled from the glare of die brilliant foam and the sharp and lovely sparkle of the pare dark blue between. Indeed, before long the wind steadied down into a noble sailing breeze with a piebald sky of warm and cheerful weather steadily swinging into the south- east, as though the whole heaven revolved from one quarter to another like a panorama on a cylinder. Wilfrid looked his wishes, but said nothing. He hung apart in a fashion that was the same as telling me to keep ofij nor had he anything to say to Miss Jennings. Finn easily interpreting his master's face, piled cloths on the yacht till it seemed as though another rag would blow the whole lofty white fabric of canvas, tapering spar, and rigging clean over the bows. We fled along in thunder, and to every curtsy of the vessel's head the water recoiled in a roar of spume as far as the jibboom end, to speed aft as fast, you would have thought, as the eye could follow it, the swell washing to the counter as if to help her. We held on in this way for some tame, when suddenly Wilfrid, who had come to a stand at the weather rail and was looking ahead, bawled with the note of a shriek in his voice, "Look ! " and out sprang his long arm pointing directly on a line with our bowsprit. " Ay, there she is, sure enough ! " cried I, as I caught sight, to a floating lift of the deck at that moment, of the pesrlish gleam of canvas of a milky brilliance slanting past the soft whiteness of a head of sea against the marble look of the sky there, where the sun-touched clouds were going down to the ocean edge in a crowd with a vein of violet here and there amongst them. I glanced at Wilfrid, not knowing what sort of mood this first glimpse of the yacht would put into him, but there was no alteration of face. His countenance had set into an iron hard expression ; methought resolution could never show more grimly stubborn. Miss Jennings came to the side to look. " There is little to be seen as yet," said I to her, " but we shall be heaving her hull up very soon. She 1b taking it quietly." Finn stood near ; I took bis glass from him and levelled it. " Why, 'tis merely ambling with her, captain," said I ; " gaff topsails down and no hint of squaresaQ that I can make out. The cloud we axe pmlring astern should puzzle her. D'ye think Captain Fidler will recognise this vessel ? " "Why, yes, sir ; bound to it," he answered ; "we aren't like the Shark, you know ; our figure-head alone is as good as naming us. Then our sheer of bow 'ud sarve like a sign-post to Fidler. Back this by our square rig and he'd have to ha* fallen dark to mistake," meaning by dark, blind. "Is the Shark to be as easfly recognised ? " asked Miss Jennings, who stood close by me, occasionally laying her hand upon my arm to steady herself and put- ting the other to her lips to speak, for the breeze rang with a scream in it at times over the rail in a manner to sweep the words out of her mouth as though her syllables were the smoke of a cigarette. Finn shook bis long head. "Lay me close aboard, miss," said he, and HI tell you the Shark from another craft ; bnt there's nothen distinct about her as there is with us. She's black without gilt like a great many others, of a slaving pattern, long, low, without spring forrads or aft, with apple sides like others again. But," said he after a pause, during which he had taken a look through his telescope at the glistening fragment hovering like a butterfly over the bow, "though Idon't want to say too much, sir, I'd be willing to lay down a good bit of money on the chance of yonder chap proving the Shark. Time, place, all sarcumstances point her out." "True," said I ; "but there are many . Jiooners afloat." "Ay, sir ; but such a coincidence as that, your honour," said he pointing, " aits to far on the wexge of what's likely to fit it to sarve as part of a man's reckonings." "I agree with Captain Finn," said Miss Laura ; "besides, I fed here that it is the vessel we are pursuing." She .laid her hand upon her bosom and turned to cross the deck where her chair was. I assisted her to her seat withja peep out of the corner of my eyes at Wilfrid, but there was no encouragement in his £ace ; so, posting myself forward of the companion for the shelter of it, I lighted a cigar and puffed away in silence tin the luncheon bell rang. Wilfrid did not come to table. Whenlxetarnedondecka&er; lingering nearly an JxMir below, partly with the wish put «on» heart into Miss Jennings, »rho was pitifullydejected and nervous, and partly fcéâiiseXlM had aloogspefi in the open air and gueased that for some time yet there would lie little enough of the nehootier showing to worth îoakras at-rt say when I returned I found my couan at the rail with his arms tigLtly clasped on hk breast rtaring fixedly ahead, with a face jgrim, indeed, with the iwms| contraction of d* brows, butas collected in tbe deterrof It as can be imagjwxi i the iSgftffc of ^Qk schooner ahead had gathered all his faculties and wandering fancies and imaginations into a bunch, so to speak, and his mind as you saw it in his eyes, in the set of his lips, in the resolved and contained posture of his body, was as steady as that of the sanest man aboard us. It was without wonder, however, that I perceived we had risen the yacht to the line of her rail, when I noticed that she stall kept under Bhorb canvas whilst the Bride was bursting through the surges to the impulse now even of the lower studdingsaiL I took Finn's glass from him and made out a very handsome schooner, loftily sparred with an immense head to her mn.nma.ilj the boom of which hung far over her quarter, whilst she swang in graceful floating leapings from hollow to ridgo with the round of her stern lifting black and flashing off each melting brow that underran her. We had, indeed, come up with, her hand over hand, but then it would be almost the wont point of sailing for a fore-and-aft vessel, whilst we were carrying in our square rig alone pretty nearly the same surface of canvas that she had abroad. She was too far off as yet, even with the aid of the glass, to distinguish her people. "What do you think, Finn, now?" said I, turning to him. He stood close beside me with his long face working with anxiety, and straining' his sight till I thought he would shoot his eyes out of their sockets. "If die ain't the Shark," said he, " she's the Hying Dutchman. I had but one doubt. Tonder craft's boats are white, and my notion, but I couldn't swear to him, was that the 'Shark's boats were blue. I've been forrards amongst the men, a few of whom are acquainted with Lord Wmterton's yacht, and one of 'em says her boats was blue, whilst th'others are willing to bet their lives that they are white." " But the cut of her as she shows yonder proves her the Stark, you think ? " " I do, sir," he answered emphatically. "Well,"said I, fetching a deep breath, "after this hang me if I don't burn my book and agree with your mate, old Jacob Crimp, to believe in ghosts." I levelled the glass again and uttered an exclamation as I got the lenses to bear upon her. "By thunder, Finn! yes, they look to have the scent of us now. See! there goes her gaff topsail !" Wilfrid caught my words. " What are they doing Ï " he roared, bursting out in a mad way from his rapt iron-like silence, "making sail, d'ye say?" and he came running up to us with an odd thrusting forward of his head as though straining to determine what was scarce more than a blur to his short sight. He snatched the glass from my hand. " Tes," he shouted, "and there goes her squaresail. By every saint, Finn, there's an end of my doubts," and he closed the glass with a ringing of the tubes as he telescoped them that would have made you think tbe thing was in pieces in hiB hands. " Shall I signal her fo heave to, your honour ? "-exclaimed Finn, speaking with a doubtful eye as if measuring the distance. "Ay, at once,"cried Wilfrid, "but"— he cast a look at the gaff end—" she'll not see your colours there," pointing vehemently. " I'll run 'em up at the fore. Sir Wilfrid ; they'll blow out plain there with the t'gallant halliards let go." " Do as you will, only you must make her know my meaning," cried my cousin, and he wait with an impetuous stride right aft and resumed Mb former sentinel posture. Miss Jennings came timidly up to me. " She is the Shark, then ? " she said in a low voice. " All who know her axe agreed, Finn says, saving here and there a doubt about the colour of her boats," 1 answered. She had a sailor's eye for sea effects, and instantly noticed that the schooner ahead had broadened her show of canvas. "Do they suspect who we are?" she exclaimed, talking as though she were musing. " Ko doubt the Bride is recognised, and they will run away if they can. She looked at Wilfrid. " I do not like to speak to him," she exclaimed. " He's killing Hope-Kennedy over and over again," said I ; " his wife is before him, too, and he is haranguing her. Bless us, what a wonderful thing human imagination is ! " Up went tbe signal flags forward in a string of balls, aman tugged, the bunting broke and streamed out in its variety of lustrous colours, every flag stiff as a sheet of horn handpainted, with the light of the sky pastit showing through. I caught myself breathing short and hard whilst waiting for what was to follow this summons to the running craft. We had been crushing through it after her with the speed of a steamer, and, supposing her indeed to be the Shark, had literally verified Wilfrid's boast that the Bride could sail two feet to -her one. But qow she had broadened her wings there was a threat of considerable tediousness in the "Do you suppose they have made out what yacht we are?" I asked Finn. "likely as not, sir.. I shall think so for sartin if they don't shorten sail on reading that bunting up there. A stranger 'ud be willing enough to speak us. Why not! TSs understand able that Fidler should have kept hisxags small in the face of the muck that was crawling in the nor'rad this morning. He's got nothen to chase, and was always a careful man, so. I've heard, and I tell ye, sir," said be ina subdued way, speaking with his eyes fixed cm Miss Jennings, who stood close with a white foce, "that the sight of his easy canvas is almost the same to me as seeing of her ladyship a sitting there," levelling his haiiy filler at the yacht, "for, fond as she was of thewater; let anything of a breeze come and she was always for having Sir Wilfrid ndnoe saiL" He put die to his eye as he spoke. "Hiîlol" e exclaimed in an instant, "they're hoisting a colour. There it goes—there it blows. Oh my precious eyes 1 What Is It} what is it? he rambled, talking to bimcAlf and working into the glass as though he would drive an eye «dean through it. "Why, Mr. Monson," he bawled, " I'm Field Marshal the Duke o' Wellington, sir, if she han't hoisted Dutch colours." \- I snatched the glass from his hand, and sure enough made out the Batavian horizontal tri-colour streaming from the peaksignal halliards like a fragment of rainbow against the lustrous curve of the mainsaiL " Wilfrid," I shouted, addressing him as he stood right aft, Miss Laura and I and the skipper being groupeda little forward of the main rigging, "they've hoisted Dutch colours. She's a Hollander, not the Shark!" and I fetched something like a breath of relief, for it was a condition of suspense that you wanted to see and end to one fashion or another as quickly as possible. He approached us slowly, took the glass from my hand in silence and after a steady inspection turned to Finn. "She's the Shark," he said, with a Serce snap in his manner that was like letting fly a pistol at the skipper. "Tour honour thinks so? ' "Don't you?" " Then Dutch colours, Sir Wilfrid " " A device, a trick ! What could confirm one's suspicion more , than yonder display of a foreign ensign? She's the Shade, I tell you, and that colour's a stratagem. What do you say, Charles ? " " I'm blest if I know what to think," said I. "If she's the Shosk, why has she taken it so leisurely, only just now setting her squaresail and gaff topsail though we have been in sight for a long time, crowding down upon her under a press that should awhile since have excited their suspicions ? No need for them to hoist Dutch colours. If Fidler thinks he is chased, why don't he haul his wind instead of keeping that fore-and-aft concern almost dead before it, as if he didn't know on which side ta carry his main boom?" " She's the Shark I " thundered Wilfrid, " the flag she is flying is a lie. Finn," he cried in a voice so savagely imperious, so confoundedly menacing, that I saw Miss Laura shrink, whilst the poor skipper gave a hop as though he had touched something red-hot ; " are we overhauling that vessel!" "Tes, Sir Wilfrid." "How long will it take us to come within gunshot of her f " Finn scratched the back of his head. " Mr. Monson, sir," said he, addressing me, "that gun 'ull throw about threequarters of a mile, I allow." " Call it a mile," said L My cousin, with his nostrils distended to the widest, his respiration hysteric, his whole body on the move, and with that raised look in his face I have formerly described, stared at Finn as though he would slay him with his gaze. The skipper scratched tie back of his head again. "Well, your honour, if yon schooner holds as she is and this here breeze don't take ofij we ought to be within gunshot," here he produced a silver watch of the size and shape of an apple, "in three hours' time, making it about half-past five." " How far is she distant now ? " "Betwixt three and four mile, Sir Wilfrid." " Get your gun ready. " "A blank shot, your honour?" " A blank devil and be damned to you. Load with ball. Who's your gunner ? " " We shall have to manage amongst us, Sir Wilfrid," turning a face of alarm upon me. I was about to remonstrate, but there was an expression in the eye that my cousin bent on me at that instant that caused me to take Miss Jennings' hand as an invitation to her to cross the deck and walk. "Charles," said he, "you told me that yon knew something about gunnery. Will you handle that weapon yonder for me?" "Wilf, it is madness," said L What! plump, a shot into a craft that may not be the vessel you want! or, which in my opinion is just as bad, fire at with a chance of sinking a yacht with a lady aboard— that lady your wife—the woman whom you have embarked on this extraordinary adventure to rescue?" My blood rose with my words. I dared not trust myself to reason with him. I crossed the deck with Miss Laura, and when we faced round I spied Wilfrid marching forwards with Finn, and presently he was by the side of the gun gesticulating vehemently to a body of seamen who had collected round the piece. Our signals were kept flying at the fore, whilst with the naked eye one'could behold the minute spot of colour steadfast at the schooner's peak. Onwards she held her course, swarming steadily forward in long gliding curtsyings over each frothing surge that chased her, a most shapely and beautiful figure with a long flash of her low black wet side coming off the line of foam like a lift of dull sunshine, whilst on high soared the stretches of her sails with something of the airiness of a dragon-fly's wing in the milk-white softness of their spaces .against the cloudy distance beyond. The time passed, Wilfrid remained forward. He stood upon one of the anchors swaying with folded arms to the movement of the yacht, stiff as a handspike, his face fixedly directed at the schooner ahead. The sailotB hung about, chewing hard, spitting much, saying things to one another past the hairy backs of their hands; here and there a whiskered face looking stupid with a sort of dull wonder that was like an inane smile; but the fact is, from Cutbill down to the youngest hand all the seameq were puzzled, excited and uneasy. The state of my cousin's mind showed plainly to the least penetrating of those nautical eyes. 2To man amongst them could imagine what wild directions would be delivered, and though I made no doubt the gun would be let fly when the order to fire was given, I was pretty sure that should it come to a command to board the schooner by force the men would decline. Sometimes Finn was forward, fluttering near Wilfrid, sometimes aft, restlessly inspecting the compass or going feverishly to the side and looking over, when again and again I would hear him say in a voice as harsh as the sound of a carpenter's plane: "Glory, glory! blow, my sweet breeze, blow! manifestly unconscious that he spoke aloud, but evidently obtaining some ease of mind from the ejaculation. The «un went floating down westwards, the breeze shifted a point or two towards him and then slackened, though it continued to blow a fine sailing wind with a regular sea that had long before lost the early snappish and worrying hurl put into it by the first tô the dark blast. Slowly we had been gaining upon the chase; minute after minuté I had been expecting to see her put her helm down, flatten her sheets, and go staggering away into the reddening waters weltering and washing to the sky under the descending sun, on what she might know to be some nest point of Bailing. She kept her squaresail spread and the Dutch flag hoisted, and swung stubbornly ahead of us, making nothing of our signals, which still continued to fly. Through Finn's glass I could distinguish the figures of a few seamen forward and a couple of men pacing the weather-side of the quarterdeck. Now and again a head would show at the rail as though watching us, but the suggestion I seemed to find in the general posture and air aboard the vessel was that of indifference, as though, in fact, we had long ago exhausted curiosity, and had been quitted as a spectacle for inboard jobs and the routine of Buch life as was lea there, -lisshe the Sharkî" I said to Finn. "If she isn't," said he, "my eyes ain't mates, sir. It is but a question of the colour of the quarter-boats." " "I see no name on the counter." "No, sir, the Shark has no name painted on her." "She's steered by a wheel," said L "So is the Shark, sir." "What do the men forward who know the Shark think now?" I asked. "Two of 'em say that it ain't her; the rest that itiB. But ne'er a roan aboard has that' knowledge of her that 'ud give him conscience enough to také an oath upon it.- Gloiy, gloiy, there she walks! By the piper that played afore Moses in the woods, your honour, 'twill be the fairest sunrise that ever I see that lights up the end of this dammed mess, begging your pardon, Mr. Monson, and yours, miss, I'm sure. Fact is, I feel all of & work inside me, like a brig's boom in a calm." "I am unable to hold the glass steady," said Miss Laura. "Mr. Monson, I see no signs of a lady on board. Do you, Captain Finn?" " Not so much as the twinkle of a hinch of petticoat, miss ; but if her ladyship's there, of course she'd keep below." " You know Captain Fidler," said L "Very well, sir." "There are two figures walking that quarter-deck. Is one of them he? '" " It's too fur oflj sir. I've been looking and looking, but it's too fur off; I say, sir. Mind ! " he suddenly roared, " they're a-going to fire," and he rolled hurriedly forwards. A moment or two after, crash ! went the gun. The blast broke in a dead shock upon the ear, and the smoke blew away over the lee-bow as red with the tincturing of the sun as a veil of vapour at the edge of the crimson moon. Miss Jennings shrieked. A long yearning gush of sea catching the Bride fair on thte quarter swung her for a breath or two so as to hide the schooner, then to her next yaw with Wilfrid still on the anchor bending forward in impetuous headlong pose and two or three sailors handling the gun and a crowd of men in the head staring their hardest, the chase swept into view afresh. " Ha!" I shouted, « she's hearing to." " Oh, Mr. MonBon ! " cried Miss Jennings, clasping her hands. Instantly Finn fell to thundering out orders. " In stun'sails'! -dew up the t'garnsail ! down squares'! ; down gaff tops'l ! " Twenty such directions volleyed from him ; in a trice the decks of the Bride were as busy as an anthill ; canvas rattled like musketry as it was hauled down; the strains of Cutbill's whistle shrilled high above the voices of the men, and a true ocean meaning came rolling into the commotion and clamour from the yeasty seething over the side, the singing of the wind past the ear, and the frisky motions of the yacht as she brought the sea on her bow heading, to Finn's yell to the man at the helm, to range to windward of the schooner that was now fast coming round with her squaresail descending, her main tack hoisting and her topsail withering with her head to the west. Distance is mightily deceptive at sea. How far off the schooner was when they let drive at her from our forecastle I could not say. She was probably out of range ; at all events, she showed no damage as she came rounding to, away down upon the throbbing blue which had softened much within the hour, with a bronze ,jgleam of sheathing, as die heeled over ere her canvas broke shivering in the eye of, the wind, that wonderfully heightened. the beauty of the long, low, black, most shapely hull, and the bland, and elegant fabric of bright spar and radiant cloths shining white yet through the faint claret tinge in the atmosphere. Wilfrid-came slowly aft, constantly looking at her as he walked. Under reduced cariVas we swept down leisurely, sliding lightly upon the run of the surge that was now on the beam. I examined her carefully through the glass whilst Miss Laura stood by my side asking questions. "Is she the Shark ¥ " " She may be. But such of her crew as I make out don't look to me to be English." " Can you distinguish any women on board?" " Nothing approaching a woman. They mean to board us. They have a fine boat of a whaling pattern hanging to leeward, and there are sailors preparing to lower her. They are not Englishmen, I swear. I see a large fat man delivering orders apparently with sluggish gesticulations, which strike me as distinctly Dutch. How about her figure-head I " l oontihued, and I brought. the glass to bear on the bows of the schooner. "Hal" I cried, and looked round. Wilfrid was watching the schooner right aft, where he had stood during the greater part of the chase, his arms folded as before, the same iron-hard expression on his countenance. I called to him. " What is the figure - head of the Shark?" He started, and answered, "I don't know. Ask Finn," and so saying walked towards us. The skipper was giving some instructions to Crimp on the other side of the " Captain Finn," I called, "Sir." " What's the Shark's figure-head? " "A gold ball in a cup shaped like a lily, your honour." "Then, Wilfrid," I cried, shoving the glass into his hands, "your pursuit must cany you further afield yet, for that craft's figure-head is a white effigy, apparently a woman's head." His manner to the sudden, desperate surging of the disappointment in him fell in a breath into the old form of thé craàness of his moods of excitement. (He looked through the glass, and thai -roared out-— "Finn." The skipper came bundling over to oa "That vessel is not the Shank." " I've been afeared not, sir, I've been afeared not," «ud Finn. " Like as two eggs end on ; but now. she's drawed out "tain'fconly the figure-head. She han't got the Shark's length of bowsprit." Wilfrid dashed the telescope down on to the deck. "A fool's chase ! " he exclaimed, ècaMtoljr intelligible for the way he qrake with His teeth set. "Heavenly God, what a disappointment! But it should have been Monday, it should have been Monday, " and his gaze went into a scowling, wandering way from us to the schooner. " 1 suppose you know," sud I to Finn, that they're standing by to lower a boat when we Shall have come to a stand ? " Ay, sir, I know it," exclaimed Finn, who had picked up his telescope and was feeling over it in a nervous, broken-dowA manner as though he feared it was injured, but durst not look to make sure while Wilfrid stood nigh. " I shall heave to to looard for their convenience," and with that he walked aft to the wheel. Wilfrid looked crushed with some! absolutely lifelesB in the dull leaden b] of his eyes. It was perhaps fortunate for us, if not for him, that this sudden prodigious blow of disappointment should have completed the sense of physical and mental exhaustion which inevitably attended the war of emotions that had been going on all day in his weak mind, otherwise heaven alone knows what miserable and painful display might have followed this failure of his expectations. I was much affected by his manner, and endeavoured to console him, but he motioned me to silence with a gesture of the hand, and seated himself on the skylight, where he remained with his arms folded and his eyes fixed on the deck, apparently heeding nothing that passed around bï™. "Hell rally after a little," said I to Miss Laura, who furtively watched him with eyes said with the shadow of tears. " It ought to have been the Shark, Mr. Monson," she exclaimed in a low voice. "My cowardly heart all day has been praying otherwise ; and now I would give ten years of my life that my sister were there—for his take, for mine, and for yourB too, that this wrctched voyage of expectation and mistakes and superstitions —oh, and I do not know what else," she added with a little toss of her arms like a wringing of her hands, "might come to an end. The sailors forward were eyeing the vessel steadily as we approached her. By this time all hands were aware of the blunder that had been made, and one seemed to see a kind of suspense in the posture of the fellows, with a half grin in it, too, as though 'twas an incident to be as much laughed at as wondered at. The breeze continued to slacken, the seas were momentarily losing weight as they rolled, the gushing of the western crimson floated in the air like a delicate red smoke, with a heap of flame-coloured clouds resting broodingly upon the southern confines and the new moon over the sun, a wonder for the bright sharpness of its curve in such a hectic as she stood in. We ran down, and hove to within easy hailing distante to leeward of the schooner, but it was plain that Mynheer had no notion of talking to us from over-Ms rail. His fine large boat hung manned at the davits as we rounded to, with a gang of fellows at either fall, and no sooner was our wjiy arrested than down slowly sank the sixoared fabric. The oars sparlàed in the red light, and sway she came for us. " Charles,' r called my cousin from the skylight. I went to him. "I'm too ill to be worried," said he ; " represent me, dear boy, will you? Get us out of this mess as best you can, and as He spoke faintly, and slightly si after be had risen. Miss JenningB, seeing this, took his arm, and together they went below. I stood at the gangway along with friend Finn. Twas a ludicrous position to be in, and what excuses to make I knew not, unless it was to come to my explaining the full motive and meaning of our expedition—a sort of candour I did not like the idea of. In the stern-sheets of the approaching boat was the large fat man 1 had previously taken notice of in the schooner s quarter-deck. His face was as round as tbe moon, with a smudge of bristly yellow moustache under a bottleshaped nose ; his person was the com-;' pletest pudding of a figure that can.'be imagined, as though, forsooth, a huge'suit of clothes had been filled out with 'suët. He wore a blue cap with a shovel-s! peak, and a piece of gold lace on it goii}gs from one trass button to ' the " other. " ' ' " That's not Fidler," said I to Finn. "Fidler ! " he ejaculated, staring with all his might at the boat, "there's twenty Fidlera m that man, your honour. . Why, Fidler's a mere rib, lean enough to shelter himself under the lee of a ropeyarn." Tho boat came fizzing alongside handsomely, and the fat man, watching his opportunity, planted himself upon the steps and rose like a whale to our deck, upon which he stepped. In a very phlegmatic, leburely way he stood staring around him for a little out of a pair of small, greenish, expressionless eyes, and with a countenance that discovered no signs of any sort .of emotion ; then in the deepest voice I ever heard in a man, a tone that literally vibrated upon the ear like the low note of*a church organ, he said in Dutch, "Who speaks my language ? " I knew a few sentences in German, enough to enable me to understand his question, but by no means enough to converse with, even if the man spoke that tongue, so I said bluntly in English, " No one, sir." He wheezed a bit, looking stolidly at me, and exclaimed, "Tou are Gaptaint " ' I motioned to Finn. " Vy you vire ot me ? " he demanded, turning his fat, emotionless face upon the skipper. Finn touched his cap. "Heartily sorry, sir : 'twas all a blunder happening through our mistaking you for another craft, ?m very willing to 'pologise and do whatever's right." The Dutchman listened apathetically, then slowly bringing his fist of the shape, if not the hue, of a leg of beef to his vast spread of breast, he exclaimed in a voice even deeper than his former utterance, " Vot I ask is, vy you vire ot me ? " Finn substantially repeated his former apology. The Dutchman gazed at him dully, with an expression of glassinesa coming into his eyes. "Votschipdis?" Finn answered with alacrity, "The schooner-yacht, Bride, sir." "Zhevihgtvorrherrnation?" sending a lethargic glance at out masthead as if in search of a pendant. _ ' No, sir," cried Finn, "we're a pleasure vessel." ' " Der is no var," exclaimed the Dutchman, pTi «IHng his head, " between mine coundty and yours." " Ho no, air," exclaimed Finn. " Den I ask," said the Dutchman in a voice like a trombone, " vy yon vire ot me?" This promised no end. I hastily whispered to Finn, " Leave him to me. Turn to quietly and trim sail and get way upon the vessel. Hell take no other hint, I fear." Finn sneaked off! " Pardon me, sir," said I, "you'll have heard from the captain that our firing at you was a blunder into which we were led by mistalrii^ our ship. We desire to tender yon our umble apology, which I trust you will see your way to accept without delay as ; we are very desirous of proceeding on our ' voyage." He looked at me with a motionless head «nd a face as vacant of human intelligence as a cloud, with its fat, its paleness, its Alp upon Alp of chin, then ponderously and slowly putting his hand into his breast hepulled out a great pocket-book and said, " Vot dis schip^s name ? " "The Bridesmaid," said I. He wrote down the word, wheezing laboriously. " -Tour captain name ? " " Fidler, I answered. This he entered. "Owner?" " Colonel Hope-Kennedy." " Ow you shpell ? " I dictated, and he put down the letters as I delivered them. " Vhere you vrom ? " " Limerick," I answered. " Ow you sphell ? " He got the word, andjjien said, " Vére you boun' ? " "To the Solomon Group," I answered. This I had to spell for him too. He wrote with such imperturbability, with such a ponderosity of phlegmatic manner in his posture, with such whale-like asthmatic wheezings broken only by the trembling notes of his deep, deep voice, that again and again I was nearly exploding with laughter, and indeed, had I caught anybody's eye but his I must certainly have whipped out with the merriment that was almost suffocating me. He slowly returned the note-book to his pocket and exclaimed "Goot. Tou hear more of dis," and with that walked to the gangway. " Pray forgive me," said I, following him and speaking very courteously, " will you kindly tell me the name of your ship?" He regarded me with a kind of scowl as he hung an instant in the gangway—the only expression approaching intelligence that entered his face, and said, "Malvina." "And pray where areyou bound to, sir? " "Curaçoa." " Are you the owner, sir ? " "Captain," he responded with an emphatic nod, and so saying he put his foot on the ladder and entered his boat. Five minutes later we were breaking the seas afresh, making a more southerly course than was needful by two points, that we might give as wide a berth as soon as possible to the Dutch schooner, that, at the time I went below to'the summons of the dinner-bell, was sliding away westsouth-west a league distant under every cloth that she had to hoist. CHAPTER XIX. A. MYSTERIOUS VOICE. THIS was an incident to give one a deal to think and tali» about. Certainly little imaginable cov-ô be stranger than that we, being in Ihase of a fore-and-aft schooner yacht, should fall in with a vessel so resembling the object of our pursuit as to deceive the sight of men who professed to know the Shark well. I should have been glad to ask the Dutch man about bis craft, yet it was a matter of no moment whatever. The thing had happened, it was passing strange, and there was an end. Likely enough she was an English vessel purchased for some opulent trader in the i? and of Ôuraçoa, and on her way to that possession in charge of the porpoise who had honoured us with a visit. The incident signified only as a disappointment. All dinner time I had been fretting over it, for since sunrise I had been thinking of the vessel ahead as the Shark ; counted, in a sort of unreasoning, mechanical, silent way, upon capturing Lady Monson out of her, which, of course, would mean a shift of helm for us and home again. Wilfrid bore the blow better than I had dared to expect. He made a.good dinner, for jriiich be had the excuse of having •fasted since breakfast, and broke into a noisy roar of. laughter out of the air of gloomy resentment with which he had amvjBd-frù^ his ^abin on my describing the Dutchman, and repeating his questions and my answers;:'.In short, his weak mind çaxne-"to his icesbue. With the schooner ^tèià'VânïâBed 1 that had served his intellect as an anchor to ride by. His imagination was now fluent again, loose, draining here and there like -water on the decks of a rolling ship ; and though he spoke with vehement bitterness of hiB disappointment, and with indignation and rage even.of linn's ignorance in pursuing a stranger throughout the day, he dwelt very briefly at a time on the subject.. Indeed, his talk was just an aimless stride from ono thing to anoi If he recurred to the" Dutch schooner, it was as if by mere ^chance ; and, though the subject would blacken his mood, in a very short while he had passed on to other matters with a cleared face. Miss Laura afterwards said to me that the strain of the day had been too great for him, and that when the tension was relaxed the strings of the instrument of his mind dropped into slack fibres, out of winch his reason could fiddle but very little music. Well, I could have wished it thus for everybody's sake. Better as it was than that he should have shrunk away scowling and hugging a daxk mantle of madness to him, and exaggerated the abominably uncomfortable behaviour I had witnessed in him all day. He arrived on deck after dinner to smoke a cigar, and whilst I sat with Miss Jennings—for it was a quiet night after the stormy blowing of the day, with a tropic tenderness of temperature in the sweet gushing of the southerly wind, the curl of moon gone, and the laige stars trembling through the film of their own radiance like dewdrops. in gossamer—I could hear my cousin chatting briskly near the wheel with Finn with intonations of voice that curiously proclaimëà the variableness of his moods to the ear, sometimes speaking with heat, sometimes in a note of sullen expostulation, sometimes surprising the attention with a loud ha, ha 1 that came floating back again to the deck in echoes out of the silent canvas, whilst Finn's deep sea-note rumbled a rMni^ing<v>mwm'ti"y" the baronet talked. "What do you think of this chase now ? " s&id; I to Miss Laura. " I wish it were over," die answered. "I want to see my sister.re»cued from the wretch die has run away with, Mr. Monson, but this sort of approaching her recovery is dreadfuL" "It is worse than dreadful," said I; "it is tedious with the threat of a neat little tragical complication by-and-bye—any day indeed—if Wilfrid doesn't stow that gun in Ids hold or heave it overboard. The 'Dutchmanmight very well have answered 'our shot had he mounted a piece or two or driven alongside and plied as, as they used to Bay, with small arms. Now one isn't here for thai sort of thing, Misa No. Is there no way of losing the eannon?" I laughed. "If Wilfrid willreserrelus fire until he is sure of the Shark instead of blaring away at the first craft that resembles her, the weapon might yet prove something to usefully serve his turn ; for I doubt if anything will hinder the Colonel from «r«rfm\g on when he catches sqrhtof us, short of iron messages from the forecastle there. But wè shall not meet with the Shatk this side the Cape, if there.'' "I fear it will prove a long voyage," said she, with the sparkle of the Starlight in her eyes. " Tou will be glad to return ? " "Not without my aster." " But shall you be willing, Miss Jennings, supposing us to arrive at Cape Town without falling in with the Shark, to persevere in this very singular and unpromising sea quest ? " " I will remain with Wilfrid certainly," she answered quietly. "My duty is to help him in ™î« search, and where he goes I shall go." " But he will be acting cruelly to carry you on from the Cape unless able to certainly tell where to find the fugitives, fixing the date too for that matter." "I see you will leave us at the Cape, Mr. Monson," she exclaimed with an accent that could only come from the movement of the lips ina smile. " Not unless I prevail upon you to accompany me home," said I. She shook her head lightly, but made no answer. Perhaps it was her silence that rendered me sensible of the unpremeditated significance of my speech. " Well," said I lighting a second cigar, "whilst you feel it your duty to stick to my cousin I shall feel it mine to stick to you. Not likely I should leave you alone with him. No." At that instant the harsh, surly voice of old Jacob Crimp hailed the skipper, who still stood aft talking with Wilfrid. All was in darkness forward ; it was hard upon two bells ; the canvas rose as elusive to the eye in its wanness as a dim light in windy gloom far out to sea, and the shadow of it plunged a dye as opaque as blindness into the obscurity from the mainmast to the forecastle rail, where the stars were sliding up and down like a dance of fire-flies to the quiet lift and fall of the dose-hauled yacht upon the invisible folds brimming to her port bow. " Capt'n," sung out Crimp's melodious voice—plaintive as the .notes of a knife upon a revolving grindstone—from the heart of the murkiness somewhere near the galley. " Hallo ! " answered Finn. " Can I speak a word with ye ? " "Who is it wants me ? " "The mate." " Tell him to come aft," Wilfrid bawled out. " H there's anything wrong I must know it. Step aft, Crimp, step aft, d'ye hear ? " he cried. Old Jacob's stunted figure came out of the darkness and walked along to where Finn stood. " What is the matter, I wonder ? " said Miss Laura. I cocked my ear, for there is something in a hail of this sort at sea ona dark night to put an alertness into one's instincts and nerves. Besides, there was no sounder snorer on board than old Jacob, and hiB merely coming up on deck during his watch below, though he should have stood mute as a ghost, was something to raise a little uneasy sense of expectation. His voice rumbled, but I could not hear what he said. Wilfrid shouted " What d'ye say ? " with an expression of astonishment and incredulity. Finn laughed in a sneering way, whilst old Jacob again rumbled out with some sentence. Then my cousin bawled out " Charles, Charles, come here will you?" " What the deuce is the matter now ? " said I, and Miaa Laura followed me as I went over to the group. " Here'sa nice pickle we're in, Charles," cried Wilfrid. " What think you I Crimp swears the yacht's haunted." " So she be," said Crimp. " Pity your mother didn't sell vinegar, Jacob, that you might have stayed at home to bottle it off," exclaimed Finn. " Haunted ! That may do for the marines, but you won't get the sailors to believe it." "That's juBt what they do then," remarked Crimp. " All the watch below have heard it and can't sleep in consequence." " Heard what ?" I asked. "The woice," answered Jacob, "the same as you and me heard 'tother night." "Have you heard a voice, Charles?" exclaimed Wilfrid, suddenly fetching a deep breath. " A mere fancy," said L " Te didn't like it anyhow," said Crimp gruffly as though speaking aside. "For God's sake tell me about this voice, Charles," cried Wilfrid, agitated all on a sudden and restless as a dog-vane, with thé twitching of his figure and the shifting of his weight from one leg to another. I related the incident, making light of it, and tried to persuade him that the mere circumstance of .my havings said nothing about it proved that I regarded it as a deceit of the hearing. "Did you know of this, Laura?" said Wilfrid. " As a joke only," she answered. "A joke," cried he, breathing deep again. ".The voice sounded off the sea, hey? 'and two of you heard it? What did it say.? " and I could see him by the star^ light looking towards the starboard J quarter in the direction whence the syllables had floated to us. "What did it say ?" he repeated. " Why, that this here yacht was cussed," rattled out Jacob defiantly, "anddumme if I don't she be now that the blooming corpse belonging to the wreck is a- jawing and a-threatening of all hands down in the forepeak. " " What is this man talking about ?" I exclaimed, belieying that he must either be drunk or cracked. " He's come aft to tell us, Mr. Monson, answered Finn, " that he and others of the watch below have been disturbed by a woice in the hold saying that there's a ghost aboard, and that the only way to get rid of him is to sail straight Away home and aid this woyage which, saving .the lady's presence, it calls blarsted nonsensé." I observed old Jacob's head vigorously nodding. " You've heard the voice too, Charles?" said Wilfrid, flitting in short, agitated strides to and fro beside us. " Mr, Monson heard it twice," growled Jacob, "off the wreck as well as off the quarter." "Speak when you're spoken to," cried Finn. " Why, spit me, Mr. Monson, if it ain't old J acob's grandmother as has signed on instead of Crimp himself; " "Look hoe," said Çrunp, "let them what disbelieves step forrards and listen themselves." " Chartes, inquire into this matter with Finn; win youf" exclMmed Wilfrid. "I—I—" he stopped and passed his hand through Mimi Jenninga' arm, immediately afterwuds saying with, a short, nervous laugh, "tbe Bound of a supmmteiral voice woulacost iw a jà^swit " "Come along, Finn,"said L "Come along, Crimp. If thew be a ghost, ««or " VY YOU TIRE or MS? friend here says, he must promptly be laid by the heels ami despatched to the Red Sea." "What did'ee want to go and tell Sir Wilfrid about that voice you and Mir. Monson heard 'tother night I " grumbled Finn, as we moved forwards into the darkness towards the forehatch. , " CJause its true," answered Crimp ilS? his eullenest manner. "'Sides it's time to end here galliwanting ramble, seems to ma, if wB'ze going to be talked to and cursed by sperrits." Eon made no answer. We arrived at the foreh&tch; and descended. ^Ehe Bride's forecastle was a large -one for a vessel of her size. On either band abaft was a «ma.11 cabin partially bulkheaded off from the sailors' deeping-Toom, * respectively occupied by Jacob Crimp and CutbilL Whether the mate ate with the captain, whose berth was just forward of the one that had been occupied by Muffin; with access by means of a sliding door to a small living room through which he could pass into the forecastle, I cannot say. It was a rough scene to light upon after the elegance, glitter, and rich dyes of the fittings of our quarters aft, but the more picturesouè for that futility as I found it now, at least on viewing the homely and coarse interior byihe light of a small oil tamp of the £hape of a block-tin coffee-pot with a greasy sort of flame coming out of the" spoht, and burning darkly Into a corkscrew of smoke that wound hot and illfiavoured to the upper deck. .There were bunks for 'the seamen and two or three hammocks slung right forward ; suits of oilskins hung by against the stannous, and swung to the motion of- the vessel like the bodies of suicides swayed by the wind. The deck was encumbered by sea-chests deated or otherwise secured. Here and there glimmering through the twilight in a bunk I took notice of a little framed picture, a pipe rack, with other odds and ends, trifling home memorials, and .the artless conveniences with which poor-Jack equips tiimseif. 'There wâè seamen lying in their beds, a vision oï leathery noses forking up out of a hedge o! whisker, with bright wide-awake eyes that made one think of glow-worms in a bird's nest ; ojther equally hairy-faced figures in drawers and with naked feet, huge bare arms dark with moss and prickings in ink, sat with their legs over the edge of their bunks. It was with difficulty that I controlled my gravity when on casting a hurried glance round the forecastle on entering it my gaze lighted on the visage of 'MYiffin ) -whose yellowness in the dull lamplight showed with the spectral hue of ashes. His bunk was well forward j his bare legs hung from the edge like a couple of broomsticks ; his hands were clasped ; his head slightly on one Bids'; his posture- one of .alarm, amid ' which, however, there stall lurked a satire quality of valet-like sleékness with a suggestion of a respectful apology for feeling nervous. Sweet as the Bride was, no doubt, as a pleasure vessel compared with other craft of those Hm^ the odour of this interior, improved as it was by the flaring snuff of the lamp, not to mention a decidedly warm night, was by no means of the most delicious. Added to this was the lift and fall of the yacht's bows which one felt here so strongly, that, coming fresh from the tender hearings of the afterdeck, you would have imagined a lively head sea had sprung up on a sudden. That Muffin should have stood it astonished me. Sleeping as he did, right in the "eyes," he got the very full of the motion. Besides, such an atmosphere as this must needs prove the severer as a hardship after the luminous and flower-sweetened air of the cabin. Finn took a leisurely survey of the occupants of the bunks. "Well, lads Î " said he, "what's the meaning of this here talk about a voice ? Mr. Crimp's just come aft to tell me there's somewhat a-speaking under foot here." ~ " That's right, sir," remarked Cutbill, who stood bolt upright like a sentry in the entrance to his little berth. " I beg your pardon, Mr. Monson, sir, but it's nigh hand the same sort o' speech -as hailed us from the wreck." 11 'Tis the same ! " said a deep voice from one of the bunks. " Bats ! " quoth Finn, contemptuously. " Never yet met with the rat as could damn a man's eyes in English," grunted Crimp. ''Nor in any otfoer lingo, Mr. Crimp, said a singular looking seaman,' whose face I had before taken notice of as resembling the skin of an over-ripe lemon. He lay on the small of his* back blinking at us, and his countenance in that light, that was rendered confusing by the sliding of shadows to the swing of the yacht, made one think of a melon half buried in a blanket. "Well, but see here, my lads," exclaimed Finn, in a voice of expostulation, " what did this here woice say ? Thai's what I want to know. What did it say, men î " " I told 'ee," growled Crimp. But old Jacob's interpretation did not tally with that of the others. The sailors were generally agreed that the voice had exclaimed in efiéct that the yacht was cursed, and that their business was to make haste and sail her home ; but some had apparently heard more than others, whilst a few again manifestly embellished, with a notion, perhaps, of -mairing the most of it ; but there couLd be no question whatever that human syllables, vezy plainly articulated, had sounded from out of the hold ; all hands were agreed as to that, and proof conclusive as to the sincerity of the men might have, been found in the looks of them, one and alL "Silence, now!" cried Finn, "let's listen." We all strained our ears. Nothing broke the silence but the sulky wash of the sea outside, seething dully, the halfstifled respirations of the; sailors, who found it difficult to control their hurricane longs, and the familiar creaking noises breaking out in various parts of the fabric to her swayings. Impressed as l was by the agreement ' amongst thé men—and I had come besides to this foreqastie with the memory very fresh in me of thg mysterious voi<fes- T had before heard—I could scarcely hold my face as Ï stood listening, with my eye glaneingfrom one hairy countenance to another. The variety of the Jades' postunes, the knowing cock of a head here and therp, the -unwinking stare, the strained bytomïng attitude, the illustration of superstitious emotions by expressions which w;ere rendered grotesque by the swing of ihe lamp, the half - suffocated looks of mm of the fellows who were trying- to dsaw their breaths softly, formed a picture to appeal irresistibly to one's sense of the ridiculous. Three minutes passed ; it might have been hours, so long the time seemed. " Seems it's done jawing, whatever it is," said Finn. We listened again; f#v "Tell 'ee it's rats, lads," said^iniu "As the -cubs was meant for'this 'en craft," exclaimed the deep TOH» tiat had : before spoken, " perhaps if hefcîowrfier was to come below, the sperrifc, if so be it's that, J ud tarn to and talk-out again." " Tell 'ee, its rats ! " crifed Finn^scomfuHy^ " Bats ! " exclaimed Cnmp, with great irritation, "if that's all, why don2> 6ir Wilfrid lay forrard and listed for hisself î " "Won't heeome?"said o&eHi;^men. "Come! no, rattledoutCrimp,"and why Î 'Cause he knows it's the truth." " Well," exclaimed Cutbill," speaking with all proper respect, seems to me that 'what's meat for the dawg ought to be meat for the man in the likes of such a humble-come- tumble out nf the maintop into the main-hold sort o' job as this." ' There was now some grumbling, .hadenabledthe men toguess that Wll -was afraid to enter the fotecasfle, and sundry sarcasms, witJj a inutuHHia touch in them, passed from bunk to bunk.

He had left Miss Jennings standing alone at the rail, and was walking swiftly here and there with an irritability of gesture that was a sure symptom in him of a troubled and active imagination. On catching sight of me as £ emerged out of the blind shadow on the forward part of the yacht, he cried out eagerly, "Well, what hare you heard? Is it a"vbice, Chartes ?" " There is nothing to hear," I answered. " Finn disrespectfully calls it rats. " V What else, your honour I " exclaimed Finn, the squeaking of rats ain't unlike a sort o' language. Put the noise they make ^alpng with the straining of bulkbeads "and the like of such sounds, and let the boiling be listened to by a parcel of ignorant Bailors, and I allow yell get what might be tanned à supernatural woice." Wilfrid burst into one of lus great laughs, but immediately after said in a grave and hollow tone, But you, Charles, have before heard something preternatural in - Ihe shape of a hail off yonder quarter, and from the dead man you found on the wreck." "Fancy,mere fancy,"Isaid. "Gracious mercy ! am I making this voyage to cany home with me a belief in ghosts ? But I wish you'd go into the forecastle with Finn, Wilfrid, and listen for yourself. Make your mind easy : there's nothing to be heard. . A visit from you will pacify the men. They hold that you admit the truth of what they allege by declining to satisfy yourself by. listening. Their temper is not of the sweetest. They should be soothed, I think, when it is to be so easily done." He hung in the wind and said in a hesitating way, "What do you think, Finn?" " Well, Sir Wilfrid, since, as Mr. Monson says, there's nothen to hear and nothen therefore to cause ye any agitation, I dorn'fc doubt that a wisit from you would please the sailors and calm down their minds. I'm bound to say they're oneasy,—yes, T'm bound to say that." " Come, then," cried my cousin, and he strided impetuously into the darkness, followed by the skipper. I gave Miss Laura my arm and we started on a little walk. The awning was furled and the dew everywhere sparkled Eke hoar frost. The quiet night wind sighed in the rigging, and the yacht, a point or two off her course, and every sheet Sat aft, softly broke through the black quiet waters with dull puffs of phosphor at times sneaking by like the eyes of secret shapes risen close to the surface to survey us. The sheen of the binnacle light touched a portion of the figure of the fellow at the wheel, and threw him and a segment of the circle whose spokes he held, out upon the clear, fine, spangled dusk in phantasmal yellow outlines, dim as the impression left on the retina by an object^ when the eyelid is closed upon it. My fair companion and I talked of the incidents of the day. One thing was folio (ring another rapidly, I said. Twas like a magic—lantern show ; scarcely had one picture faded oat when something fresh was brightening in its room. " What manner of sound could it be," she asked, "'that the sailors have interpreted into cursings and dreadful warnings ? " "It was no fancy on my part anyway," said I, " let me put what face I will on it to Wilfrid. If what the men profess to hear be half as distinct as what I heard, there must be some kind of sorcery at work, I'll swear." (To be continued.)
