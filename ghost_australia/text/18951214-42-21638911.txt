The Lily of the Valley. By Bruan O'Linn. "The Lead" was the name given to an outlying portion of a Queensland gold-<*> field which, since the happening of the events related below, has reached a high place among the gold-producing centres of the world. The gold was obtained at, for alluvial, a considerable depth, vary ing from 50ft. to 100 ft, and was dis tributed so unevenly over the bottom as to entitle The Lead to the term " patchy," qualified by adjectives of a more or less > forcible nature. It was, however, com paratively easy sinking, needing no shooting ; veritable poor man's ground, requiring not the formation of wealthy syndicates to develop its resources, nor the assistance of powerful and compli cated machinery to extract the precious metal. Offering little Inducement to the formation of limited liability companies to fatten a few at the expense of many ; The Lead being altogether Independent of the puffs of the "mining expert," free from the presence of the mining share broker, and abandoned as flat stale, and unprofitable by that now obsolete and -tflmost forgotten Individual' on the North-, •m fields—the " mining reporter." There iwas wanted only the J>rawny arms and oast-Iron constitution of the miner to ■ wield the pick and shovel tn the foul, 111-ventllated shafts and drives ; to dis solve the mullocky portion of the wash in the " long Tom," rook the cradle, and to skilfully manipulate the tin dish with that half-rotary, slightly forward motion, perfection In which can be gained only after long practice, and by which the lightest grains of gold are retained. There Tom Jones, the Cousin Jack, and Reggie Rivers, who one time held a commission In a crack cavalry regiment, .were dividing mates ; and in the shallow ground, gully-raking, In company with Mick Dooley, from Cork, was Robert Warner, who not so very long before had "Rev." prefixed to his. name, and who Is now enjoying the ease, comforts, ■and emoluments of one of the "fancy livings" In England. Jones and Dooley had drifted out to Queensland in the ordinary way of business. Rivers and the "Rev. Bob," as the diggers affec tionately called him. came because, pre sumably, circumstances over which they i had no control, or having it, had failed :to exercise it, became a little mixed, and caused a change of air and scene to ,be desirable. Now and again rich gold would be discovered In one or other of the claims on the lead, and numbers and blocks would be pegged off all around. Then matters would quieten down until the red flag was seen on some far off spur, and a rush to peg off In the vicinity of the newly-discovered " golden hole" set in. Here, on The Lead, the burning questions that occupied the tongues and pens and minds of the out side world found but a faint echo. The world was forgotten ; only the excite ment of the quest for gold was remem bered and continued. Robert Lawson had a claim on what was considered the outskirt of the lead. "Old Bob." as the diggers called him, was a typical miner of the old school ; a trifle eccentric, or "off his pannikin," It was suggested, but universally voted a " good old sort." He was not con 'sldered unsociable because he preferred to roam about the country In lonely pros pecting, aocbrapanled by his daughter Lily. Neither was he, on her account, expected to Join In the revels that 'characterised the goldfleld shanties. He was a rough- looking man of about 60, with.heavy tirttws and shaggy beard. His air was that of sober content and gravity, which at times of excitement on The Lead contrasted greatly with the surrounding commotion or hilarity. -Travelling about the country, prospect \- ing, or camped in an Inhabited locality, as be was on The Lead he was considered a strange being, utterly devoid of self assertion or assumption—equally so of guile. There was In his expression a ' look of puzzled thoughtfulness, as though life was to him a difficult pro blem—a something requiring deep, serious consideration, even in its simplest 'every-day aspect. There were moments when, though awake and apparently alive to all that was transpiring around ■him, he was in reality actually dead to the world, and when spoken to would look questionlngly at the speaker, and then resume his work without having heard, or hearing not having under stood. But Old Bob's eccentricities were thoroughly known and generously .permitted, perhaps on Lily's account > more graciously than they otherwise would bave been. He had, with Lily, •some in to The Ljead from a lengthypros- to Lackboroo who was standing by. " Very good that fellow aunt go away altogether," he said. '^She too much make Miss Doris cry. Me plenty hear Miss Doris Mr. Merton talk longa buck board other night. Suppose that boat no been smash up longa island, then Miss Doris too much cry altogether, me think." The mail steamer following that by which Miss Doris Oxenham the elder had left these unworthy shores bore away to England a younger and fairer Doris, and with her the " Ghost of Cruiser Island." (The End.) peotlng tour up the river, pitched his tent upon the slope of a little gully open- Ing; into the flat, upon which the lead of gold which gave the place its name was supposed to exist; he had taken up and commenced to work a claim in the gaily, and in honour of his daughter, upon whom the old fossicker doated, had christened his claim "The Lily of 'the Valley." And Lily. Lily Lawson had never known va mother's care ; but for all that the world has few like her in stock. She was 18, below the average height; fair, with a glorious burden of bright chestnut hair, which, despite her impatient efforts to brush It down in accordance with the prevailing style, would persist in break- Ing its bonds and running up agan In soft ripples. She had large, shy, blue eyes, with long lashes and arched brows. Her face well, it Is vain to describe a face/ Lily's was perfection; and having said so, every reader will picture a different countenance. It was a face that seemed to Invite protection, having that in It which man so appreciates In the woman he loves. Her figure was well rounded, though slight. There was a touch of native dignity In her walk ; and, although she possessed a fun* of natural gaiety, it was demurely restrained by her eighteen-year old appreciation of the enormous respon sibilities which she had to contend with as house no, tent keeper for her father. " Alnt she a daisy, BUI ?" said Jim Shannon to his mate, as he sat on the windlass handle on the brace of his shaft, his elbows on his knees and his face resting on his palms, while he gaaed with enthusiastic admiration after the trim little figure In sun hat and cool, tasteful print, buoyantly stepping along past their shaft on her way to the store. " She's Immense, don't you think, BUI ? " Scrumptious !" responded his mate. •• Got a grand eye." " Rlppln' hair." "An* teeth." " Tes ; by gum !" Then Jim got up, looked admiringly and mournfully after the girl, stretohed his ridiculously long legs, and slid below over the-iogging. Bill sighed wearily as he stationed himself at the windlass for an hour's hauling with an accom paniment of grave meditation. Lily had smiled up at Jim and BIU as she passed their shaft, and they felt, as every other single man on the Lead felt every time he caught a glance of Lily's natty figure, discontent at their loneliness, and a hope that when some fine day they struck It rich fate might send in their way such another trim little mate for life as LUy Lawson. Old Bob was a pronounced " hatter" of many years: standing. He was " agin company as a general thing," he said. It was slow work, to be sure, especially when the sinking was deep, as it was on The Lead. "I've got a notion, Lily," he said, " that this place will suit me. P'raps they chaps down the flat yonder haven't got the gutter at all. Howsumever, I'm agoln' to try." So the old man In his methodical man ner set to work, and sank a shaft at the mouth of the little guUy where his tent dkood, with its bough shed In front and bagged off compartment, whloh consti tuted Lily's bedroom and boudoir, within. "I'll bottom, for sartln, at 20ft. or thereabouts." said old Bob Wills daugh ter one day. "Jim Shannon got it at •Oft, and he's away out on the. fiat". But the old " hatter" did not bottom at 20ft.. 30ft, 40ft, or evenJttt He was amazed. For the last 20ft. he had passed through shlngly.^drlft which rie eejMrttated an amount of timbering and dead work for which he had not bar gained. Then it became weary work breaking up the bottom and hauling the mullock single-handed ; but the. old man was real grit, and refused to give In. " I'll stick to her. by gum," he would say when his daughter expostulated with him, and endeavoured to Induce him to take In a partner to help him sink the shaft. " I was never licked yet Lll, and I won't be now." " But, dad,'.' she would urge, " I'm sure there are plenty of men on The Lead who wculd Join you. I heard Jim Bhannon say the other day that he was sure you were bound to strike something good, and all the men agree that-it Is a good sign the ground being so deep." But the old man had that far-away look in his eyes which the girl so well understood, and she turned away with a sigh, while old Bob went out to resume his heart-breaking work. One day he entered the boughshed, as usual, for bin midday meal, and ate It/a* usual, in Bilence. At its conclusion Lily asked the question she had asked daily for months past : . " How's she looking, father ?" The old man looked at his daughter quietly for a minute or two. Then tak ing an old black pipe from his pouch, he walked to the fire, lighted it with a live coal, and returned to his seat. Slowly and deliberately he emitted exactly ten successive puffs of smoke from his lips, without removing his eyes from a mark on the ground directly opposite him. Im mediately after the tenth blast had been expended, he withdrew his pipe, poised it carefully ? between his forefinger and thumb, expectorated once, and "raising his eyes with the same calm deliberation turned them towards his daughter, and replied : " I hey struck it, Lil." " What ! Bottomed, father ?" " Ye-e-s." Lily's face fell. " A duffer, father ?" she queried. For answer the old man put his hand inside his flannel shirt, and, pulling out a mustard tin, laid it on the table. Lily lifted the lid, and gave a little scream of delight and astonishment. The tin was three parts full of gold in nuggets of various weights and shapes ; some as large as a pigeon's egg ; some as small as a pea, or even a pin's head —pure allu vial, waterworn gold. "Oh ! father," cried the girl, " we'll be rich now ; and you can leave this hard work. And oh ! won't we be so com fortable when we're settled in a little home of our own ! Won't we, dad ?" Another more lengthy pause than be fore ensued, and the solemn simplicity of the reply was characteristic of the man. This time he sat with his.eyes fixed ok the ground, and seemed to be communing with himself : m <• " It is now fifteen years, come Aprile," he said, " since I started this ere kinder life, an' atwixt good luck and bad luck I hevn't did so bad. You've bin a good gal, a kind darter. Lil, an' I allers looked forward to the time when I cud say to yees : ' Here, lass, is plenty of money for yer to enjoy yerself to yer 'cart's content.' There's no denyln' a man gits thlnkln' of this 'ere settlin' down ; aroamin' round lonesum out baok. I mek no denyin', Lil, I've had noshuns that way meny and meny a time ; but now, lass, my luck Is in, and I mean teV foiler it up." And the old man got up and went out to his work again. " I'll plant it with the other, Lil," he •aid, taking the «old from-the table. "I'll plant It down below. We'll keep this 'ere find quiet till I see how, she runs below." The discovery In the •' Lily of Ihe Valley" proved very rich. The gold was coarse and heavy. . For nearly ja fort night the new* of the find did not get Abroad. Then one day Rivers, the ex cavalryman, was passing Lawson's claim. Glancing at the mullock heap he saw traces of wash, and then his eye fell upon a half- ounce speck, which had been overlooked by the old man. He picked It up and put it in his pocket. " By Jove !" he said to himself, " the old fellow is on gold. Keeping it quiet, too, by George !" That evening he pegged off a claim ad joining Lawson's. Then the news spread, and claims were pegged out all round. "Ye-e-s," old Lawson would reply in his quiet, drawling style, when asked regarding his find; " I've struck the cutter right enough. That Is If It's not a pot-hole, and, by gum, if it Is It's a mighty deep one." Shaft* went down all round, and now Lily stood at times on the brace and pulled up half-filled buckets of wash and headings, broken down and filled by the old man below. Sometimes Jim Shan non would tome over and bashfully offer his services, and she would smilingly resign the windlass handle to him. Then Rivers bottomed tils shaft at Mft.—«, rank duffer. Another and another followed—duffers all, or at best. " stringers," the abomination of thje digger. Lawson's claim alone appeared to contain gold. It was one ot those un accountable geological freaks so appa rent both before and since on many Queensland fields. The old man's claim was a veritable pothole, while the claims all round were shallow and barren of the precious metal In payable quantities. About this time The Lead received an accession to Us population. The coach brought up a showily-dressed woman and her belongings. With a bold, de fiant, swaggering gait, she walked from the coach to the Miner's Rest, looking Tight and left at the groups of diggers, to whom the arrival of the coach twtce a week was an event of importance. Among them was Rivers. He glanced at the woman and started violently. "By Jove !" he exclaimed. " Diana for a thousand. The devil has found me again. I thought she was dead." That evening The Lead knew that Rlvers's wife had come In search of him. She sat on the veranda, of the Rest In the dusk, decked out Inner showy finery, while the diggers gazed at her under their brows, and wondered Who and what she was. She seemed so much out of place. She was a handsome woman of the bold, forward type. Lines of beauty were not wanting in her face, nor lost beneath her too gaudy raiment. But there was only a steely cold-heartedness visible In the expression of her clear-cut features, and a cruel hardness In her cold, restless eyes. ■ " I may as well get It over," muttered the ex-soldier as he sidled up to her. on the veranda ; " though I would rather see the devil himself." Next day it was known on The Lead that Rlvers's wife had purchased the goodwill and stock-in-trade of the hos telry known as the Miner's Rest. Rlvers's character for unscruplousness and trick ery of all kinds was well known to the diggers, and few of them associated with him. His last mate, Jones, openly ac cused him of having stolen the partner ship gold. His newly- arrived wife* bold and defiant, held the whole community on The Lead in contempt, and lost no , opportunity of displaying her scorn of " the dirty crowd."' The crowd retali ated, The tolerance of the diggers was rebuked, their influence defied, and theiff dignity hurt. With deep-muttered ob jurgations against the " stuck up doll/ as they called her, the men turned their backs upon the legitimate liquor shop, and transferred their custom and cash to the. " shanties," of which there were not a few ; and in the course of a very short time The Rest was practically deserted by its best customers. Meanwhile Lawson, assisted by his daughter, continued to work at his claim quietly and unostentatiously. Since the arrival of his wife Rivers had frequently visited Lawson's tent in the evenings, sometimes accompanied by his wife, who seemed to take a warm interest in Lily. They made many inquiries about the mine, and evinced their pleasure when the old man told about Its richness, and Lily spoke glowingly of their future pro spects. " I'm thinkin' of takin' that chap. Rivers, in as a mate, Lit," said old Bob to his daughter one day. " Oh, father !" she replied, earnestly, "don't do. that. He has a very bad name. They say he took the gold that belonged to Jones, who was mates with him. lam afraid of him and his wife. I don't know why ; but the woman's eyes seem to burn holes in me." " Well, lass," said Lawson, " I am get tin' purty weak an' old, and what with the drivin', an' bailin', an' truckin*. an' .haulm', I find'lt knocks me up. Rivers had a look below in the claim, and offers a good price for a third'share. " Don't have anything to do with him. dad," pleaded the girl, putting her arms around the old man's neck. " I'll work my Angers off to help you. You have a lot of gold now, and we'll soon be able to go away altogether, and then you won't have to work at all." "Weel, weel, lass, don't mind now.; we'll go on pullin' and haulm' for a while longer," said her father, soothingly A few days later Lawson received a letter, requesting his presence at the warden's office in the town, twenty miles away—on "very urgent business," the letter said. It was an % unusual thing, but the old prospector had a very hl~h opinion of mining law, md a deep reve.' ence for its official administrators ; so he went. He would be absent one night, re turning early the following morning. Jim Shannon was also going to town, * and together they rode away. Lily, left by herself, was lonely. She never remembered having felt so miser able and downhearted. Do what *he would, she could not shake off the fore boding of evil that hung around her. Bhe passed the day between the brae? of her father's shaft, where for hours she sat attempting in vain to concentrate her mind upon her sewing, and the tent, where she moped about in' uneasy WKetchednens. In the evening after, tea she was sitting listlessly in the tent; when she suddenly remembered that, she had left her tewing on the windlass handle. She got up to go for it. It was dark, and she gilded noiselessly through the lnrge lronbarks towards the shaft. When about half-way she was startled by hearing voices. She stepped behind a large ironbark tree. The speakers ad vanced towards her, and when opposite to the tree which concealed her, they stopped. They were Rivers and his wife. The next moment the girl nearly fainted on hearing the ttnor of their conversa tion. "I tell you, man," the woman was saying. " You have nothing to fear. You know that the gold is hidden somewhere below in the woi'klngs. I can lower you down and pull you up. I did It before, you know, In a deeper shaft than this. Why are you turned such a coward T You usen't to be. You remember when the stone fell down the shaft—acci dentally, of course—at Bandy Creek, and killed *our mate, Tom Dolan. You weren't a cotoard then. Reggie. Well, there's no killing here. Go down to-night and get the swag, and we'll clear out of this hole, and see a bit more life to gether." 41 Yes." he said bitterly, " and you'll collar the lot as you did Dolan's swag, and leave me as you did then to bear the brunt of the thing/ " No, Reggie." she said hurriedly ; " I swear to you we will share It evenly, and you can do as you like with your share. There's no danger. The old fellow Is out of the way. That letter from the warden was a happy thought, and that chit of a girl will be fast asleep. If we don't get the stuff down the shaft, we'll search the tent." "Very well." the man replied. "I'll trust you once more, Diana ; but, by heaven ! you have been my evil star. Everything we attempted has turned to ruin and disgrace and shame. I had to clear out of the army and England through you and n "Oh ! drop your cant," said the woman scornfully. " Here's a chance of making a big punch, and an easy get away. Come up with me at 12 o'clock to-night and bring a candle, and all you ha>e to do is to go down and annex the gold 1." Then the speakers moved on, leaving Lily Lawson transfixed with horror.; •stunned by the frightful revelations she had Hstened to. SJte-fcnew they re ferred to her fatbef; there could be no, doubt about mT They were about to steal hhj -gold and money ; his savings of sr-ttfetime; his ail, stored down in a hiding place In the bottom of his shaft. The eccentric old man believtf it safer there than In the Bank of England Itself. The loss of It now would kill him, and de stroy her hope of taking him away from gold-hunting to a quiet, comfortable life elsewhere. What would she do? What could she do ? It was after 10 o'clock, and they were to go down the shaft at midnight. There was no one in the whole world, walled the girl, to whom she could confide the dreadful secret. Bhe would have told Jim Bhannon, per haps ; but Jim was away with her father. She would go down and remove the gold from its hiding-place. Vain thought, discarded as soon as conceived. How did she know she could get down that deep, dark shaft, and. once down, she knew how utterly impossible it would b« for her to ascend again. It was prior to the time when legislators saw the neost* sity for an Act of parliament providing protection-, to miners wprkjng. under ground, and, among other things, mak-. ing it necessary that similar shafts to that of the Lily of the Valley should be provided with a ladder-way. Even her father, with all h^s; years of expe rience in climbing up a shaft, by means of the rope and toeholes, found it diffi cult to ascend from such a' depth. And she had no one whom she could trust to pull her up. She was a child, and in this supreme crisis in her life she thought and acted as one, although at the same lime proving herself a heroine. "I will go down and protect his gold," she said to herself, and ran at the tqp of bit speed to the shaft. Arriving there, sn? 'mounted the brace, and gave the rope a great pull, making the windlass revolve Rapidly. She paid out the rope with desperate" energy,' arid when that was, done seized it with t|*r -small hands, an* Started down into the depths below, as she had often Been her father do. Mechanically her feet slipped into the toe-holes on either Bide of the narrow •shaft, and no touch of fear, no thought /Of danger entered her soul. ■ There were rough sets of timber at various distances upon which she might have rested, but she did not pause for an instant. Down, down, down, she went, with a numbed body and mind so confused that she scarcely realised what flhe was doing. >At length her feet struck upon a slab that covered the we|l hole at the bottom ■of the shaft, and she stood -upright, lean ing against the -side of the shaft, tremb ling in every limb, large drops'of blood falling from her lacerated fingers into the water beneath her. Then feeling with her "hands she found the mputh of the drive, crouched Into It, and sat' down. .. She knew that the gold Was concealed In the drive, whereabouts in it she did not know. She had given no heed to the necessity for a light, and now she shud dered at the darkness which seemed palpable. The sides of the drive were slimy, and everything damp, foul, and evil smelling. ' But she would sit there find wait, and guard ncr father's gold. If anybody came to take it ah! what should she do ? She had never given a thought to that. The air was dose and oppressive, and gradually her head fell forward on her breast, and her eyes closed. She slept. Presently the girl was startled by sounds in the shaft; then came a creak dag, the windlass turning on its axle as somebody descended on the rope. She nerved herself to meet the Intruder, and It was not long before she was face to face with him. She heard him land on the slab over the well, and curse as his feet slipped. Then a glare of light blinded her for a moment. When she looked again she saw the man. Rivers standing before her, a lighted candle In his hand, and a look of Intense aston ishment and alarm on his face. '■'■'' ■'•' Great heaven !" he shouted rather than spoke-. You here !" •' So paralysed with fear was the girl -that she was unable to utter a word. . Tfeen she heard the muffled sound of a 'Voice calling down the shaft. '!. Hullo ! What's up ?" and Rivers ..answered— ... "You'd better haul me up, Diana; the girl's here.; we're sold." "Knock her on the Head, you fool!" came the answer In an unearthly tone to the girl's, ears. Then she found strength to speak. 44 What do you want here ?" she said. -i':Oo away. This Is my father's claim, and you have no right to come here." . "No, my pretty miss," said the man aloild ; then he muttered, "Yes, Diana Is right. We might as well hang for a 'sheep as a lamb. I've gone too far now •to draw back," and advancing to where the girl crouched, blinded by the glare, .no struck her a cruel blow on the temple, .and Bhe fell back on the floor of the drive unconscious. Rivers then commenced his search for the hidden' reasurc. It was a long time before he found it, and he was frequently Interrupted by the impatient voice of the woman culling on him to hurry. At length he loosened a stone in the side of the drive and came upon the cavity Which held the gold. A goodly pile It was, stored away in chamois leather • bags and tin canisters.. He crammed them all hastily Into the black bag and \- went back, to the shaft " Haftb, there !" he called out; " I've got it all right." 44 Good enough !" replied the woman. " Til send the bucket down. Put the .gold Into It, and I'll pull it up. Then I'll pull you up." Rivers ' laughed to himself. " She want* to trick me again, the devil," he muttered; "but I'll fix her this time." While the bucket was descending he quickly emptied the contents of the-4>ag lhto his pockets, inside his shirt, and In every available place on his person. One of the heaviest parcels, a small for tune In Itself, he held in his hand. He . then, filled the bag with heavy stones. 44 Look out, below !" sung out the \- woman, an the bucket descended. 44 All right!" shouted Rivers, after placing the bag 1n the greenhlde bucket. 41 Heave away, and "send the rope down quickly for me ; I'm nearly smothered here." -.^ ' The woman hauled up the bucket, and, landing the bag1, she placed It on "the ' brace, laughing. 44 Just as well to be on the safe side/ ■he mused, and then paid out the rope again to the bottom. 44 Look up, below !" she shouted down. " Heave up!" called Rivers, after placing his foot in the bucket, and grasping the rope. Slowly the rope tightened, and then he began to ascend. He was a heavy man, and the weight of the gold made 'It a dead lift for the woman, who was ■training at the windlass handle above. • " Hallo !" he cried out, " d- —n you ! Draw me up quicker." . Slower and yet slower he ascended, sometimes stopping altogether for a .moment. The woman wqs straining •very nerve. Now his head was within a couple of feet, of the top, when the man, with an oath, made a desperate grab at the logging on top in the vain ■ endeavour to catch; it and pull himself to the surface. That effort Bealed his .doom. He fell back on the rope with a jerk that caused the windlass handle to fly from the grasp of the exhausted woman. There was a wild whirring noise, a crash, and Reginald Rivera lay across the well hole at the bottom of the shaft, mangled and bleeding. The woman > gave one frightened look into the-black depths below, where now every thing was awfully still. Then she picked up the black bag, hid it under her cloak, and fled through the timber. When' consciousness returned to Lily she heard the sound of a smothered groan from, the shaft. She palled out feebly, but could get no reply. All through the weary hours until daylight shone down the shaft she sat or crouched in the drive, listening to the groans growing gradually weaker. Hers was a frightful expe rience, and it was little wonder that when her father and Jim Shannon, after looking in vain in every possible place about The Lead, for the missing girl, found her in the drive in company with the dying man, unconscious and delirious. For once in the. experience of those who knew him, the eccentric old man showed some .signs of emotion as he .brought his daughter to the surface, and carried her gently and reverently to her bed. Tears were seen to ;tri6kle from the old man's eyes as he drawled : 44 I'd a rather ha' lost the whole of that Iyer, gold than that a hair of my purty lass should be hurt." . Riven was brought to the surface, and lived several hours. He had received several; internal -tojuries, '-but recovered .consciousness before he died, and told the whole story of the robbery. The woman, he said, had been his bad angel from the time when, a young subaltern, he had been infatuated with her beauty, and had married her. He then found her to be a worthless adventuress ; was obliged, in consequence of her intrigues, to leave the army a disgraced man ; and from that day had gone from bad to worse. He lived for two hours after being brought to the surface, and died calling down curses on the head of the woman. • " • Diana Rivers was'looked for that day by the diggers on The Lead, and for many days and weeks afterwards by the police, but she had effectually disap peared, leaving no trace behind by which a clue could be gained as to her where abouts. Lily Lawfton Is now no longer tent keeper for her father. Nor is the "old man a fossicker. A good deal of stir was made at the time of the attempted robbery, and the attention of Investors was directed to the richness of Lawson's claim. The result was that he sold out at a handsome figure, and, with his daughter, prepared to leave for ever the scenes of his hard tolling In pursuit of the wealth, which came at last. It was only then that Jim Shannon, upon whom fortune had also showered her auriferous favours, mustered up suffi cient courage to ask Lily, in a very un orthodox manner, to be his wife. To his delight, and the disappointment of a score of other self-conscious "elgibles," she accepted Jim, and they were married <telay amld general rejoicings at The Lead. On the following day, with the cheers and good wishes of the entire popula tof J?f^ the place rlntfng In their ears, old Bob, with his daughter and her hus band, drove away from The Lead. Pass- Ing over the saddle of the range, which in a few minutes would hide the little camp from them for ever, father and daughter turned and gated with varying emotions at the spot where the shaft stood, wtth the little tent and Its bough shed In the distance. Lily shuddered as she remembered her terrible experiences on that awful night in the dark and noisome drive, and turned away with a sigh of relief as the coach crossed the saddle and shut out the view. The old digger, true to his creed to the last, thought only of the mine as a gold pro ducer. Between the pulls from his pipe he drawled in his deliberate style. ,''She war a stunner, she war; and I'd ha' liked to hey draw a bit Into the flat ter see how she ran that way. By Cum, I would." Then, with a deep regretful sigh, the old man turned away. Perhaps at that moment he would have risked the com forts of the home and the love of a fond daughter and happy, romping grandchildren that the future held in ■tore for him for a bit of driving into the flat In order to ascertain how the gold ran In the mine which he had just gazed upon for the last time—the " Lily of the Valley.'
