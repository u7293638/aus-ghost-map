"Fisher's Ghost" THE FOUNDATION OF THE LEG1ÃŽND. The following Trial is taken from an early number of the "Sydney Gazette." It con- tains the true facts on which the legend of the notorious "Fisher's Ghost" was founded. There are very few old colonists that have not heard, in one form or another, the story of "Fisher's ghost," and many are still living who knew the principals in the affair. This narrative was recently pub- lished by the "Shoalhaven Telegraph," and to it we are indebted for the copy. It is of interest as an old time story.
