I COMMON-SENSE AND COURAGE. Two young 'Americans, it is said, recently settled a quarrel in a fashion which would have made the hair of a Parisian fencing master bristle with horror, but which nevertheless had an inspiration of common-sense in it.

The question resolved itself into a simple issue—Which was the better shot:? And they determined to settle this ques tion by shooting, not at each other, but; at a tree. The tree was shot at; the inferior marksman perfdrce adroitted that he would have been annihilated by his rival and agreed to vanish, not by giving up the ghost, but by leaving the country.
