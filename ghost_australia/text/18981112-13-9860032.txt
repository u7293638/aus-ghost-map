"And that it may be better known, there is a porch at the door like a country church porch ' This advertised the i redoubtable Keith (at this time languishing in hell gate and represented by clarifies), the reverend divine who, by license, performed more clandestine marriages among the upper classes than my other clergyman had ever done in London Of course the "scum and offal of the clergy," as Keith had more than once termed his rival practitioners in the street, had, before the passing of the Marriage Act, united together hundreds more couples than he had ever done, but, as he said, "What would you have' They marr) drunken sailors to distress, shop boys to their masters' daughters who, as often as not, must secure a husband by hook or by crook, and that at once rich tradesmen's widows to dec i) ed gentlemen, at id genus omnes.
