THE HOSPITAL SOCIAL. \---+-- The hospital "social," which is an nounced to take place this evening in the shire hall, in aid of the funds of the Alexandra hospital, promises to be one of unusual brilliancy, in each and every detail. The "commissariat" department is reported to be in a very forward state, our "country cousins" having responded to the call from the committee in the moat lavish and ,ln,,ri.ant manor,I nhila, the local ladies are trying to out vie each other in the edibles they are preparing. It is gratifying to know that whatever opliosition the town evinces in politics against.the country, and vice versa, that in charitable matters we are one, and may it ever continue so. The two essentials, and which we consider of paramount importance to the success of any dance, are first-class music and a good floor. In these respects, we are without rivals in the country districts of Victoria, and when we mention that Herr Becker, with the able assistance of Miss Ellerker, whose services have been gratuitously given, is a sufficient guarantee that in the music depart ment nothing will be wanting. So far aq the floor of the hall is concerned, it needs no ghost from the grave to speak in praise of it for dancing purposes. The President of the institution (Mr. Hutchinson) will have charge of the whole arrangements, and will be assisted by the " social" committee. The dancing will commence at 8.30, and as there are 24 dances on the programme' (to say nothing of the extras) who dare say that the last" social" o!' the season will not be other than a pronounced success.
