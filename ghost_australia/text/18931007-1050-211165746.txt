BITUALI8TI0 TEACHING IN SUNDAY SCHOOL AND THE CHURCH EX TENSION ASSOCIATION OF THE KILBURN SISTERHOOD.— 5 & 6 PATERNOSTER ROW. Sir, — I do not think the parents of onr Sunday School children are awake to the necessity ot some inquiry as to what is taught in onr Snnday-schoois. In the parish where I am located, the clergymen turned out a text-book in use among the teachers, and thrust npcn them " Church Teaching for the Chnioh's Year," by the Rev. John Watson, Vicar of Sculooates, Hnil, and also the Kil- burn Sisterhood. Here are some specimens of the teaching " We must not interpret the Bible so as to contradict the creeds."— Page 5. We are born again (regenerate ) when we are baptised." — Page 126. " Born in sin. This stain to be removed- Holy Baptism God'e way of removing this stain — Adam's sin left behind in the waters of baptism." — Page 126. "Sacraments. They give life." — Page 72. " Made temples of the Holy Ghost wtien wo were baptised." — Page 39. " Not real Holy Communion if not real Minister."— Page 78. " Jesnspleading His own sacrifice in heaven, paade proviBion for ns to plead it too, on earth, in the Holy Commnnion."- Page 68. Aug. 14th, 1893. English Churchman. A Watchman.
