IV. IT seems that about three weeks after f Dr. Canitte's first visit to the cottage,-; Jennie 6tated that she believed that thK power that made the sounds and lit the; matches could hear and understand all that was said, and perhaps could see them. The moment she had finished the sentence three distinct reports were heard; and, on Daniel requesting Dr. Carritte to ask the power if it could heai, three reports were heard, which shook the entire house. Dr. Carritte remarked at the time that it was very singular. Daniel then^sked if the ,[>Qjre; coij]d tell how man v fcereonk rifere ia t£e i6ofei, and not rgcgjfifg a r|pa£te<jft|e question in this form, " How many persons are in room ? Give a knock on the floor for each one." Six distinct knocks were instantly made by the power on the floor; and there were just six peravn^intthe room at the time, they being' Dr.' 'Camtiej Datriel Teed,' his, .fATek: j 1 f |jepnL^, jartd' .William' Cox; John Teed left the room after popr Esther'haa biri&d; fafce'irt the pillow ^$.8h£j fay ift.befl, tremb|hig (with. frigjjt; llit family cpuld now converse with tf& powcir m 'thitf Wy.'1 ft Would knock tgyi.loF ;a negatjy^,#>$wei> and tnrep, times for an answer'in'the affirmative, giving only two knocks when in doubt about a reply.

And now to that kindled by this demon, with matches itolMfrbm^thbmatdirtoxm tbe'kitcheti, and *hicb,iCou!d upt j^idd(fl,fro|ji him in .any part of .the hpyse ; yrherp he CQuild not,Slid thtm.*" "'.

Estfiet .a^-the time was seated in the dinrng-reohi-and had been there 'for an ;hour-or. fnore,. previous to. j whigh she been intb'e k&.ctisn assist-, ting her sister to wash the breakfast dishes. They both told me, during my resi Adertce'in the h&uie;, that when they first' discovered the 'Smoke on this occasion djey were so terrified for the moment that neither of them could move. Mrs. Teed was the first to recover from the shock, and seizing a bucket of drink ing-water, always- kept standing on the kitchen table, she rushed down the cellar stairs, and in the far corner of the cellar saw a barret isiT shavings blazing up almost to the joists of the main floor of the house. -In the meantime, Esther had reached the cellar and stood as if petrified with astonishment. .Mrs .Teed poured what water the bucket contained - (for in the excitement she had spilled more than half on her way down) '4njo the burning-JBhavinps, and both she-and Esther, b^^^togtvjcb^cked witjj the' smoke, raa up the cellar j staffs gjaja out of the hoqse into Princes StreA'iqwing fireTfii^^lBmopTOmuM, ? ...Their cri« aK»sttl-#U ^^(fituft-aeigh bourhood. ?Several men rushed(iA, ;«nd stioie~' 'SarrfiSthcrea. the ''^urhmg barrel/ with rjigs./rom the toing^oom^ floor,'others ^ut'itoutentirely'witlvVfttcr they obtained - from a 'large butt into which the rain-water ran, aniTwas. sayed for washing purposes. . ; -The Amherest- Gauit/i published an account of the fire bindled-^yjhe^wfir | and as the article was; oF Vourkfc, fcttpieil' throughout Canada, as articles from that Admiral paper always arp, a ^tr^mepdous. sensation was created' arte} t genuine curiosity groused. ,j /. . Thousands of people who had set the whole affair down as a first-class fraud, began to think there migbtbftsc^aetbing in it after all; for certainly no young girl could set fire to a barrel of shavings ipjtlje cellar and be at-the same.tijne. jn one of the 'rooms above! under the' ?watchful eyeof an. elder sister, out of whose sight she never dared to go for feif 'thfe'ghbst Would ftiurder her. : ?. The!fact.that bnth the little boys wctoe; playing in the frojtt yard,at the time, the tire was started, 'and 'consfeqliently could pot have anything to do \ri(h stqrtjngj jf, was also calculated to thrown an air of still greater mystery around the whole' affair. The family and Dr. -Carritte- along knew that the fire had been started by Jhc-ghost. . The fire-stgrshals of-Atnhtrst were of opinion that,Yn someunexplained manner Esther had kindled the fire. The inhabitants had various theories. Dr. Nathan Tupper, who had never witnessed a single Manifestation, sug gested that if a sttong raw-bide whip were laid .across Esther's bare shoulders by a powerful arm, the tricks of the girt would cease at once. . During the following week the ghost gave as much evidence of power as ever; and. die excitement in the village became intense. If Daniel^ T:ed'$ cottage (aught fire while, the winfi was blowing from trie bay, wlien it would be most favourable' for such a terrible catastrophe, nothing could possibly save the village 'from being re duced to ashes.- , As if to pile , horror upon horror, one night while Esther and the entire family were sitting in the parlour the ghost became visible to her. When she saw him first she started to her fert ttnd .seemed jtyoutjo^fgll.-d^ad from fright- Itecovfetuig.bervtrength-and self-possession in a moment, however, she pointed to a distant confer oF:the room .with her trembling hand, andl exclaimed in, a hoarse and broken voice,' i ;; " look there 1 Look there I My Gp4 it is the ghostl Don't you all; spe him, too ?

After putting on his heavy coat, Daniel went out into the snow and intense cold to Mr. White's house, which fortunately was not 'ar. After knocking for some time, the door ?was opened by John White himself. Re ,looked at Daniel a moment in ama&iAent;, asked him in, and then issiHItst' ^What's the matter, Teed ?
