Dalley's Speeches and Writings. THE spseches and writings of the late Hon. W. B. HALLEY are to be collected and published in book form. Whether all of them will be republished is somewhat doubtful, but if such should be the case, one or two will cause a sensation. During the excitement re the Kiama ghost business Mr. DALLEY delivered a speech in which he attacked Sir HENEY PARKES in the most trenchant fashion. The speech was published at the time in a pamphlet, and very widely distributed. Of its kind it is almost* the best thing that the author delivered. But all his speeches are good, and when the book appears it should be procured and studied by every young man who desires to excel in the art of oratory. It will afford a remarkable contrast to the volume of speeches published by Mr. DAVID BUCHANAN, which consists of oratory decked out in load coloured print*, and ornamented with the cheapest spangles.
