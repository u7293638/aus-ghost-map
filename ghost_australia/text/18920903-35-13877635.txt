FUGITIVE NOTES. .- a Mr Justice Windeyer's very practical and sound remarks in a case in the Supreme Court this week under the Employers' Liability Act are worthy of special attention Plaintiff was suing her husband's employers for his death through alleged negligence on their part The case was one of those painful ones where a man loses his life in the discharge of his daily duties, leaving his family without their broads inner, and of course in all such cases, fortunately for humanity's credit, there is always sympathy for the bereaved ones But the difficulty is to distinguish between this sympathy and that just apportionment of responsibility in the matter without which the risks of some businesses would be so great as to keep capital out of them altogether. His Honor went very clearly and fully into this matter, and under all the circumstances the thanks of both employers and employed are due to him for stating the true facts on which such cases are to he decided That this was necessary in evident from the Judge's own explanation The Lm plovers' Liability Act has not been long in operation, but according to his Honor it has been the cause of more like river and more differences betwi on Judges and other persons than any other Act of ParhnnicutinforcoBo short-time The new Act linE a. humane provision strongly in favour of the AV workmen, which was absent from the common law hitherto formerly the employer was not liable for injuries to an employee caused by the neglect of a fellow workman, under the existing measure the employer is responsible if he employs incompetent persons or detects o apply races But as Mr Justice Windeyer pointed out, and as he made perfectly clear by the set of questions he put before the jury to guide them in arriving at a verdict, the measure was not intended to place skilled workmen in the position of children, relieving them from the care and responsibility, and holding the employer responsible for injuries incurred through the victim's own negligence The effect of his Honor's remarks is that before damages can be recovered it must be shown, not only that the victim did not contribute to his OAA n injury, but that the employer directly or indirectly did . . a "One who knows what is going on " writes to the iff) aid to make a double- barrelled complaint He says opium is smuggled into the colony in the guise of innocent-looking half-chests of tea, and that all the filth and rubbish in the shape of tea itself, which cannot pass into any other port in the world, can be dumped into New South Wales and retailed at all kinds of prices Prize conundrum for the next minstrel show Which is the more serious of these two complaints ? "One who knows " thinks it is that about the opium But when you come to think of it, not one in a thousandths, ten thousand-of those who drink tea smoke opium, and though this may be a reprehensible practice on the part of those addicted to it, it is for the bulk of the community, after all, is non-practical ft question as the supply of moral pocket-handkerchiefs for the infants of Boinoboola-Uha On the other hand, we all drink tea, or what we fondly accept as that article, and if people who profess to know all about it can come forward and confidently assure us that AV c are supplied with the sweepings and leavings of the rest of the world, the matter is becoming serious Some little while ago we heard BOmeUung about tea, condemned in Melbourne, being airily sent on to Sydney and accepted here with a light heart When the Treasurer took the duty off ten with such a flourish of trumpets he was probably unaware that he was taking it, not off tea, but effective, but that is what it amounts to if half AV o bear on the subject be true The pity of it is that the burden of this iniquity falls, as usual, on the point consumer, who pays more in proportion for his necessaries and gets them of worms quality than those in more comfortable circumstances It is the buyer of low-priced teas who gets all this rubbish, and he, of course, is least able to protect himself It the Treasurer must be bune volent over this commodity, would it not bow oil if he exercised his benevolence in supervising the quality of the supplies ? . . . - . It is not without interest that one reads a correspondence in the Melbourne, papers on the subject of the ovor-oiamming of school children by home lessons that we heard, so much of in this colony lately There is no mistake about the fact that on or study in this country, and especially during the summer months, is quite a different matter from the same thing in England or other colder climates It e whilst" the energies quicker, and although no direct evidence is yet available on the subject, there is a strong suspicion that it enfeeble the brain and wears out its tissue as well. The Melbourne complaints are almost bitter in the tone they adopt in regard to the subject One parent, who writes under the sententious pseudonym of " Less Cram," says his little girl of 11 has home lessons assigned to her which occupy, With help, as much us four bom. on some evenings, and usually not less than two He complains that children have maps to draw by way of home exercises which take up time that should be spent in bed A perfect chorus of complaint that school programmes are overloaded is ready to make itself heard on all sides as soon as this subject is mooted, and the Melbourne outcry is an evidence of it there is one side of this question to which another correspondent calls attention in a somewhat remarkable letter, which should not be lost sight of in connection with a popular system of education intended to meet the case of every child in the land This writer gives instances of little lads who rise at 6 o'clock in the morning to soil papers, by way of assisting their widowed mother to keep the home together In such cases, with parents too illiterate to render assistance, the work of preparing home lessons becomes more than irksome On all grounds, therefore, it seems At evil that the zeal of the touching authorities should be tempered by a reasonable discretion in this direction As has been pointed out, the evening is not the time, after the day's at work in school, to overtax the brains of young children. in the tragical fate of the sea that everyone has been reading with a thrill of sympathy during the week there are details dramatic and sensational details which are almost lost in the general impression of the catastrophe The melancholy failure of the attempts to cast a line over the distressed vessel need not be referred to, but as one roads the account of the apprentices M'Leod and Levitt, and of the fate of the first and second boats that left the ship, the unvarnished tale helps him to fill in the colour and detail of the awful drama that played itself out in the early morning of Monday last off the ironbound Victorian coast In the midst of the hurry and confusion we get glimpses of two or three well- defined incidents There was the one after the swamping of the first book in which the two lads were A huge white crested sea swept the ship, says one account, fell on the small boat, and capsized her and then, goes on the story, a light with all haste was flashed from the side of the Newfield, and its rays just fell on the faces of Case and vessel as they were hurried past in the race of the current " These two men were lost, but the two apprentices dropped one of them regaining the ship by a rope, while the other was lodged by a roller on a nail v ledge of rock a few inches wide, and " just long enough to hold his body " M'Leod clung to that ledge for four hours, watching the fate of the ship and of his companions, until some of the settlers who had come to the rescue espied him, and sent down a rope Then came the next sensational incident, when the young fellow, bruised and sore as he was, tied the rope round his body and had himself hauled perilously up the face of the cliff, a height of about 400ft There is enough melodrama in this one chapter of incidents for the ingenious Messrs Sims and Pettitt to construct a successful Adelphi piece out of, and these are only the experiences of one survivor Thounpt_u-sstory.is iinothorehaptorof accidents and it is pleasant to notice that here, as in other cases of the kind, there was a good-natured and hospitable settler whose door was open and whose roof was ready for the shelter of the surviving victims of this latest in our hot of mon- mine disasters . . . . . " His Honor said that if the cigars were made of thosucoulcntvogot_blo_nov_asoabbago, then they ought not to be sold as Hall and cigars "There is a beautiful appositeness about this, and an indisputable reasonableness which disarms criticism If you stop to think about it-a course not to be recommended about most things a man has no more right to call a rolled cabbage - loaf a Havana cigar than he has to call the mainspring of a watch the boiler of a locomotive Indeed, for the matter of that, he has no more right to call a rolled cabbage-loaf a cigar at all If Judge Owen, who made the remark above quoted, is anything of a connoisseur in this matter it is not unlikely that his bosom has been wrung before now by the turpitude of the personawho\end articles as cigars which arose i ha our loss, though perhaps not so innocent, as the succulent vegetable his Honor named There is a ela. a of person on this pi net whom a really good cigar would tempt to almost any extras general reference to Sir George la intended and when people of this class find themselves tucked and deluded by a kind article it increases their -souls to come across such an pression of opinion as that set on record by Judge Owen A good engine i mother of the most comforting kind-an anodyne for worry that leaves no seventh behind it-a none lester of of the most gentle and persuasive kind It is perhaps for these reasons that it is so exceedingly difficult to buy any of a really reliable quality without paying a prohibitive price for them But there is no justification for the men 1 obliquity which would venture on palming off cabbage leaves and something worse in real Htivmas Ofcouisowo know that real Havana as of anything like fine quality) me not to be procured in this part of the world and tliitanooddial otrubbishis sold openly indictable under the names of first-class blunder We cannot get out that, but at least we haioanghtto protest against being asked to smoke cabbngo-le.ios, and call them Havana cigars against our better judgment . * * - 2 The practical joke has long since been banished from the Society of sensible people, it it ever had the entry there, and the practical job or is now usually regarded with much the same affection as the par pocket Of the two, perhaps, the pick- pocket in procurable You know what to do with him when you meet him, but the essence of the diabolical quality of the practical joker is that you never know exactly what to do with him, unless you impulsively drop the gentlemen out of the window first, and consider the merits of the matter afterwards It is distressing to lead, after the number of swimmers they have had of late in the shape of collapsed booms, inflated protective tariffs, and the like, that the people of Melbourne have not only taken to practical jo. big as a counteracting of the pro ailing depression down there, but that their efforts at humour hav n taken the form of ghost r main j, East Now, it appears, is one of the counties with a ghost story, and the latest account runs to the effect that a young man resident there had expressed a contempt for ghosts in the hearing of his companions, whereupon they proposed to test his courage With the aid of stilts and a Into breeds one of them so worked on the feelings of this young man of East Kew, by tonfiontinghuu suddenly as he turned the corner of the cemetery reserve, that he sustained a (shock. which rendered him insensible In this condition, it was said, he remained for some days, so that his life was endangered Perhaps of all kinds of practic to joking this li. tho met senseless and objectionable, and it i come a rut) that the opportunity of the ghost in this matches cannot be tested in a conclusive and definite summer There are some enthusiastic humourists who have obtained picturesque effects at the expense of ot ex pitable w omen and children by the same means, and as it is the essence of a good joke that it should be something more than one sided, it might be well if the East Kew spectre were "laid" after such a fashion as would remind intending spectres of this in future.
