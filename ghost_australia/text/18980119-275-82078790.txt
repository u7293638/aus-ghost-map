ABOUT GHOST SHIPS. To the Dutchman we have to look for the original of phamtom ship tales, which form about the most familiar of sea legends. The famous phantom ship that remains off the Cape as the harbinger of wreck and woe is a Dutchman, .whose skipper dresses ' in yellow, wears a nightcap, smokes a short pipe, and is always kind enough to heave in sight when a vessel is going to founder or run. ashore. There is, however, . another spectre that haunts these waters. Years and years ago it ship was homeward b'ound from the Indies with a cargo of specie and spices; but in conse quence of fever breaking out, at no port of call was she allowed even to enter quarantine. So she cruised about until the crew all murdered each other, and now she is doomed to cruise about for ever, manned by the ghosts of the defunct mariners. Then there is the story of Baron Falkenberg. One day he was in vited to the wedding feast of a long lost brother, who returned home suddenly with a pocketful of coin in order to marry a gentle village mai den upon whom Falkenberg him 'self had h s eye. It was annoying, but still the baron thought it better to bo amiable to his brother, so he went to the feast, $en rowed off to the ship, from which he has not landed for six hundred years. On wild winter nights the phantom ship is constantly seen in the Ger man. Ocean, heading for the north, but without hehn or helmsman. She is pa- nted grey, has colored sails, and flies ? a yellow flag. Upon her deck the passing mariner can plain ly see the Baron sitting. alone, play ing dice for his soul, while about the masthead a blue flame can be seen flickering.
