THE NORTHERN GOLD FIELDS. THE ROCKY RIVER. [From our Special Correspondent ] UN Sunday last a Chinaman named All Sam, whilst walking on the road near the Chinese Camp, Mount Jones, was seen by some of his countrymen to fall , down, lfe got up, but hail not proceeded far before lie again sank down in a sitting posture, and shortly ^expired. Information was conveyed to the Camp, undjttw-body placed under the charge of a trooper until an enquiry could be held. As is usual with the Chinese, the utmost repugnance wasiJV iTlUlfl when culled upon to remove the body, and they ex pressed their terror at the idea of the Poctor having | to open the body, allirming that a ghost or evil spirit I which is in the bowels would thus he let luose and injure them. â–  However, there was no post mortem .exaijiifiation, but a magisterial enquiry was held on Tuesday by Mr. Commissioner Addison. l>oatli is supposed to have resulted from the breaking of a blood vessel, much blood having come from deceased at the time of death. In the coffin were placed .new-' boots, a book, rice, antMfffiSrtWags: ' Aff sanfTeaves la widow, a Malay woman, who bewails her bereave Iment very much. | A new rush was reported at Mount Beef a day or f two ago, the sinking being near the base of the hill on ithe side towards liral la, and depth about 17 feet. I Ttwewwylittle hope of any good resulting from it, but time will tell. Some ground near Cabbage-tree Cully, on the other side of the liiver, is attracting attention. A few par ties are getting gold, and the locality is a promising one. We have lately been favoured with light showers of rain, but not of any consequence for washing pur poses. One noticeable feature in the weather is that the wind, which for a long period had been from the Eastward, has now commenced from the opposite quarter. To-day it has been unusually cold.
