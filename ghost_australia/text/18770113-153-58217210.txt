THE NIGHT-WIND. At a lonely inn smo gth sincs I sit alone in the firelight's glow, . Losing myself in the oaoklog'a mines, And he ring the sight.wind come and go ! And now it threatens, and now it greaves, Fle?den at the liotl, or slams a blind; Now it prowls, sullen, about the eaves ; This pro ean, bitter autumn wind. Fiercely it sweeps on the doorside yew. As a vulture drops upon its prey ; And now in the throat of the soo y flue I hear it howl, like a beast at bay. Now it flies shrieking across the downs, And now, like a ghost, it whispers me Of people a starving to death in towns, And of wrecks a thousand league at sea !
