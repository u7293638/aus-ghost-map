THE ENGLISH POETS OF OUR OWN DAY. An eloquent and instructive lecture was delivered on W edneadny afternoon at Ormond College, under the"âuspices of the Literarj and Debating Society of that institution, by Mr A. S Wny, M A , the head master of Wesley College. About 2o0 ladies and gentlemen were present The chair was occupied by Mr J IL Macfarland, M A . head master of Ormond College, who, in introducing Mr Way, said that this was the first of a scne3oflec tures on literary subjects which were in tended to bo given in connexion with the society The following is the full text of Mr Way a lecture - About GO years ago, a young poet, just in the sweetest passtge of his sweetest poem, paused to lament that the sceptre and crown of poesj had passed away from men, and that the olden loveliness of song, and the grace of the fashion of it were lost for evermore, that " Tho oount Of mi gilt) poots is mado up, the scroll Is folded by the Muses, tho bright roll lain Apollo s hand our dozed c> es Uato seen a new tingo in tho western skies, And all the sun of uoo») is set But even while Keats lamented thus in soli tude amid fair springtide scenes in the Isle of Wight, far away to the north, on the breezy wolds of Lincolnshire, a bright ej ed, glad hearted boy, standing on the moorland, ' heard the copses ring,' nndsawthepratthng brook "come forth from haunts of coot and hern " and gazing seaward, " beneath the wide winged sunset of the mistv marsh," beheld the hollow ocean ridges roaring into cataracts, while nature whispered him things demo 1 to common ears, and touched the chilli lips of Alfred Tennyson with fire And close on the skirts of mighty London, a grav e faced, solemn eyed boy stood at a t;ar den gute, and saw the stream of life go by at. wards, and marvelled with child wonder what might be the thoughts and cores and hopes of those that hurried by with feverish feet to plunge into the roaring Babel yonder , and the dreamy questionings of the boy grew deeper and clearer with the years, informing the man who should one duy puiut heart workings and apeak as only Browning con, with the lips ot the living and the dead And jet again even in the heart of the great city, a lovely little girl with great flashing ejes and oft changing colour, Baw the toiling mj riads pass along, and saw where caro and grief and suffering patience looked Badly out ot human ejes, ana heard the sounds ot sur row, shame, and wrong that haunt the thronged streets, till her young heart burned within her and little Lizzie Barrett kindled with the first workings of that spirit which should ere long break out into passionate heart muBic. And here and there in cottage home und stately mansion, mothers fondling arma gathered around those whoso names Bhould one day be bright in fames port roll Even while the "Bwcet wailing singer pro phesied drought there was a sound of abun dance of rain Yet the period which followed the death of Keats and Byron und Shelley was, for nearly 20 years, without a celebrated poet It seemed as it the quiet peaceful times which followed the hurricane of the French Revolution, and the fierce storms which came in its train, were too dull and sleepy for any such outbursts of melody as had mingled with the wilder sounds of that tempestuous period That great uprising of a trampled nation, with gathering of armies and torrents of blood, the going forth of the watchword of "Liberty, equality, and fra ternity,' that tremendous awaking of peoples that had slept in chains for ages had stirred the hearts of poets strangely. They, and all lovers of freedom, justice, humanity, and beauty thought that at last the remedy was come for the world a wrongs, that there should thenceforth be no more oppression, that "tyrant' and "slave should be for- gotten words. No wonder that such hopes, such dreams, set their souls on fire, that their voices burst out in exulting prophecy of the good days coming, that their hearts beat time to the march of those grand events. But when those noble dreams found such a dreary waking— when on the short-lived feverish Republic followed the iron handed despotism of a soldier, and then succeeded the old masters, the tyrants, " who had learned nothing and forgotten nothing," and the people's rights were thrust aside—poets turned away with a sigh from the world's drama, and it was not for many, many years that the trumpet blast of freedom was answered by the harp note of song. Throughout all Tennyson's earlier works we shall scarcely find any re- ference to public events on the Continent. Browning, whose great power lies in his close observation of, and sympathy with, human nature, still has not gathered poetic inspira tion from the broad life of nations around. And as with the chiefs, so with the rest ; they have " looked far back into other years, " or inwards upon themselves, or scanned the thoughts of their neighbours, or pored upon the book of nature, but not often have they given token that their hearts went forth with the people. In another respect the poets of the present day differ from those that went before. During the first quarter of the present century the most popular of our poets sought many of their themes in distant countries and at remote periods ; and so we had the romantic poetry of Scott, Byron's thrilling tales of Greek adventure, and Moore's Eastern stories, like gems from the Arabian Nights reset. But the poetry which charmed then has lost some of its fascination, even for the young, and the fashion or taste of the present time seems rather to favour a more calm and subdued expression of the poetic fancy ; and a great of the poetry of our time is full of painting of home scenery, familiar emotions, domestic life, and such like quiet themes. And this, too, is some of the best poetry now written, for such subjects require a more delicate sense of art, more finished execution, and more careful treatment than those writings which appeal violently to the imagination or the passions. Even in such poems as Tennysons "Idylls of the King," the tale of the knightly deeds of Arthur and his warriors of the Round Table seems to be told less for the mere story's sake, and more perhaps for the deep heart lessons to be read there, the sympathies to be kindled, and the light to be thrown on man's nature For instance one. who takea up Tennyson's poem with his head full of the legends about Arthur's knights will be surprised to find how little fighting there is there, and how briefly it is disposed of, and with how few details Once more, there is a difference in the style of the poets of 50 years ago and those of our own time The poems, for instance of Byron and Scott are for the most part romances of such powerful interest as narratives that they charm thousands of readers who can only distinguish poetry from prose by the different arrangement of the lines, and people require no very high intel lectual or moral capacities to be carried away by exciting descriptions of bandits or pirates, or gay voluptuous strains in praise of " wine and women." But the highest class of poetry now written is not such as he who runs may read, and see all that is to be seen. There is as much finish of expression, betokening unsparing labour, as though days had been snent in perfecting a single hue, so much thought crowded into small space, that no words be misled , such condensing of expressions, every word having weight, such close, deep thinking, that it often happens that one does not at a first reading perceive all the beauties of a poem, possibly does not at first sight, clearly see the meaning of certain passages Hie language, too, is highly wrought, the language of cultured English- men, and the careless slipshod reader, the skimmer of novels for the story s sake, who has never perceived the real beauties of his own language, or the deeper meanings ot many words, to whom many most picturesque expressions are strange or unintelligible, will fmd a great deal of "hard reading m the finest poems Many passages are like grand, perfect pictures, to which one returns again and again, each time discerning some new beauties, some deeper meaning, and carrying away a sense of loveliness and perception of tile charms of nature or the workings of the heart which is a real gain to a mans mind, winch opens his e)es to discern things which he never perceived before lill a mans mind is improved by education, culturo, and re flection, there will remain much line poetry bLyond ins appreciation, and even above his comprehension Havina- thus touched on some of the prominent features ot the poetrj of our own da), I will now pas3 on to the poets themselvis 1 shall give a short notice of the character of their poetrj adding nfewextracts as specimensof thestjleofeach The poet who stands first in popularity mid nho also was the first who uppeared of all living poets is Alfred Tennyson, the Poet Laureate Perhnps no poet has during his lifetime obtained so extensive an audience Ihe poems of Byron and Scott were greedily bou"ht up as the) appeared, but the reading public m those da) s was not ne irly HO nume rous as how Scarcelv has any work of Ins issued from the press when it is found m half the draw uicroams in 1 ngland and tis fast as steam can carry it it is borne in thousands to every market where the English tom,ue is ?poken \\\e will note some of the causes of this popularity, to sec wherein lies lennjsons attractive power-the spell by which he makes men listen to him - 1 His love of nature nnd the charming crace with which he depicts her thousand aspects In ever) pa"e )ou may find lovelv pictures of sweet homely scenes and ot nature in its repose in its softness, in its luxuriance pictures always fresh and sweet always breathing of innocence nnd simplicity 1 he characters introduced are always associated in our munis with some delicious BCene which frnmes thun whether it be the (.irdenera luijitu stan ling hall lignt, half shade," with the shadow of the! rose» trembling on her waist, or Charles II hiding in the Royal Oak till all the paths were " Vi hilo far below the Roundhead rode, And hummed a «urly hymn ' or the miller's daughter, leaning from the easement over her "long green box ot mignonette," while the trout leap in the mill pool below, and the chestnut buds glisten in the breezy blue, or the silvery cloud that in the deep raidnoon bad lost it way among the pine) sides of the long prlen, where stootl the lovelorn Onone, with the fire blossoms of the crocus at her feet, or the dreamy land of streams where the wa!e worn mariners " Sat them dow n upon tho ) cllow sand.

Thus he describes the mighty frame of a warrior - " The knottod column of his throat, Tlie ma-ilvo squaro of his heruio breast, And arras on which tho standing muscio sloped, As slopes a w ild brook o cr a Uttlo Btono Running too voueuiently to break upon It" When a hero suddenly charges, scattering his foes, " The) vanished panic stricken, Uko a shoal Of darting fish that on a sumiller morn Adovvn the crystal dykes at Camelot Como slipping o cr their shadow« on tho sand. But If a man «ho stands upon the brink But lift a shining hand against the sun, There is not left tho tvvinl lo of n fin Betwixt tho cress) islets whito in floiror" Nightfall " Beneath a whispering rain ¿Night slid down-one long stream of sighing wind, And lu her bosom boto tho bab) Slcop Here is a little star picture - " Many a night I saw tho Pleiads, rising through tho mellow shado. Glitter Uko asiiarin of Aro flics tangled In a silver braid How man> of us, in gaping upon aome fnir scene, have wished that we could but evpreas m words the impression it creates' It boa seemed to us that could we but so enshrine it, we should make it more our own, should carry its loveliness away to refresh our souls withal for man) a year to come. It is just this service that Tenii)8on has ren- dered us m countless inBtances lhe magic of his art has given us word pictures, golden memories, ot nntute, which are the world a possession for ever In the dullest winter da), a vision of spring rises before us as we read the line, " All the wood stands In s mist of green Does not the glorious inspiration of the Bea stir within us nt such words as these "A wild wayo in tho wild North Sen Oreen glimmering towards tho summit, bearing all Its stonn) crests that smoko against the skias ' Or this " A full tide Rose with ground swell which, on the foremost rooks, Touching upjetted in spirts or w lid sea smoko And scaled in sheet« of wasteful foam, and fell In vast Boa cataracts-ever and anon Dead claps of thunder from wtthtu the cliffs. Heard through tho living roar Is there not some of the iascination of the breaking surf in " O did you nov er Ile upon tho shoro, And watcli tho curled white of tho coming wave, Glassed In the slipper) sand bofore it breaksÍ ' What a fairy dream of English woodland steals upon the exile in " Shcota of byaoiuth That soemed iho heavens upbreaking through the earth Again, Tennyson has the art of apeaking of things which m themselves are quite common- place, and which seem to have nothing to do with poetry, in a manner which atoncellinga over them a mantle of grace and beauty, BO that they need ne! er more appear vulgar oc prosaic. One would hardly expect poetry in a pigeon pie, but Tenison tells us of " A dusky loaf that smelt of homo. And, half cut-down a pasty costly made, Whero quail and plgcou, lark and leyorot lay, Like fossils of the rock, with golden >olka Imbedded and uijclUcd ' A lady's handwriting is "Such a hand OB when a field of oom Bows all Its ears boforo the roaring cast." In geology he Bhowg ua " Hugo Ammonites, and tho first bones ot time." Thus he describes a lady's dress : " A splondld silk of foreign loom, V! hero like a fihoallng BCa the lovely bluo Pla) ed into green aud thlokerdowu t-e front V! ith jon ols than tho sword with drops of dew, When all night long a crowd clings to tho bill And with tho dawn asoendhtg lots the day Strike whero it clung so thickly shono tho gem» " It is the proud distinction ot Tennyson that he is of that chosen few who have held the high honour of never uttering one Bingle line such as an English girl would wish unwritten or an English mother would wish unread, and in life's autumn days, when many memories begin to gather round hia heart, this may well bo the dearest of them all. 'tennyson has been called the poet of woman—not that his hold over women as his. readers is greater than his command or in- fluence over men, but that he has studied and painted woman in form, character, capa- bilities and office with rare devotion, power, and skill, and the poet who achieves tihs end also does most and best for man Much might be said concerning Tennyson's religion and philosophy, as displayed in his works, but we will just remark in passing that his aim has been to bring home to our hearts and feelings those great truths and external realities which, because we have known them as facts from our cradles, we are too apt to forget and neglect as common matter-of- course things, He has remembered what an old writer said -"Goodness doth not move by being, but by being apparent ' Ile touches sometimca on those dark doubts and strang, questionings of the soul which often perplex the minda of thoughtful men, but the doubt of other men he scorns to pity rather than to share, and testifies that enough of the beauti- ful and the good remains for lum-enough of the lasting and tho true His popu- larity is largely based upon his true sym- pathy with the noblest, gentlest, and most beautiful tendencies of modern life Some 50 years ago, at the age of 20, he published editions ot his first poems Among them were the well known, " May Queen, ' "The Miller's Daughter," " The Death ot the Old Year " 1 rom the last we will take a verse or two " Full kneo deep lies tho winter snow, And the winter winds aro wearily sighing , Toll ye the church bolls sad and Blow, And troad softly, and speak Ion, For the Old Year Iles a-dylng Old year, you must not die You caine to us so readily You lived with us so stcadil), Old Year, you shall not die " Ho Both still, ho doth not mov o ' Ho will not soo the daw n of da), , Ho hath no otbor life above lie gave mo n friend, and a truo truo love, And tho New Year will take 'em away Old Year, you must not go So long as y ou havobeon with us, buch Joy as y ou havo Boon w Ith us , Old Year, you shall not go " Ho frothed his bumpers to tho brim, A Jollier year wo shall not seo , J-r. though his eyes aro waxing dim And though his friands speak ill of him, Ho was a friend to me Old Year, y ou shall not dlo !! o did so laugh and cr) with y ou, 1 v u half a mimi to die with you Old Year, If y ou must die ' In this volume, too, is found that well known rebuke to the proud high bom beauty "Trust me Clara Vero do Vere, From yon bluo heavens above vis boat The grand old gardener and his wife Smile at the claims of fong descent Howo or it be it Booms to mo Tis only noblo to bo good Kind hearts are molo than coronets, And Bimple faith than Norman blood " * But when Tennyson published these first poems, the) were not very well received. 'I he English public was not ready for them The critics spoke ill of them Ile waa silent During 10 j eira no one saw Ina name in A review, or even in a catalogue But when he appeared ngam before the public. Ina books had made their way alone und underground, nnd at the first hound he stood the greatest poet of his countr) and his time In 1842 hí- tame was made b) "Poems by Alfred Tenny son ' '1 his !olume contained, among others, the well known "Gardeners Daughter, " Morte d Arthur," and " Locksley Hall " rrom the last come the famous lines pro phes)ing what men shall achieve in the years to come, when the problem of sailing in the air is mastered - " Mon, mi brothers, men tho workers, over reaping something non That w hloli thev Inv o done but earnest of the things that thev shall do For 1 dipt into the future far as human ey o could sec Saw tho vision of tho w orld, and all the wonder that would bo Saw tho Heavens filled with commerce, argosies of magic sails Pilots of the purple twilight dropping down with costly bales, Heard tho Heavens filled with shouting, and thero rained a ghastly dew From tho nations airy navies grappling In tho central blue, Far along tho world wide whisper of tho south wind rushing warm With the standards of tho peoples plunging through the thunder storm , Till the war drum throbbed no longer, and the battle flags were furled In the Parliament of Man tho Federation of the World." In 1847 appeored the " Princess," a medley poem, in which all that is picturesque and charming in the age of chivalry and m our own is mixed up together into one lovely whole. The plot is :-A beautiful Princess, betrothed in infancy to a handsome prince, is smitten, as she grows up, with the doctrine of woman's rights, and, forswearing all thoughts of marriage, she founds a univer- sity, " With prudes for proctors, dowagers for deans, And sweet girl graduates with their golden hair." No man is permitted to set foot in the college under pain of death. The prince sets out with two friends to try to bring her to reason Disguised as female students they gain ad- mission, and then follows a series of adven- tures , the opening lecture , the geological party, the stormy scene when the intruders betray themselves , the gathering of armies round the college , the tournament, the college, a hospital for the wounded, and, to crown all. the final relenting of the wilful beauty These pass before the reader like the shifting scenes of some stately pageant too fair to be ever forgotten Here they are on a geological excursion - " Many a little hand Glanced Uko a touch of ßunshino on the rocks, Many a light foot shano like a juvul net In tho dark cr ig , and then we turned, w c wound About the cliffs, tho copses, out and in, Hammering; ami clinking, chattering stony names Of shnlo and hornblende, rai and trap and tuff, Amvgdalold and tracli) to, till tho sun Gre» broader toward his death and fell, and all Uho rosy heights carno out above tho lawn« " Immediately on this follows that gem of melody, known as the " Bugle Song ". " Tho splendour falls on castlo w alls Ana snowy Buramits old in ttory ; Tho lona light shakes aoross tho lakes. And the w lid cataract leaps In glory. ' Blow, bugle, blow, eot the wild ocboes flying, Ilion, bu_lo , answer, echoes d)ln_;,_d)ingl dying "0 hark, O hoar I how thin and clear, And thinner, clearer, farther going t O sweet and lar from cliff and sear Tho horns of 1 Uland faintly blowing I Blow, let us hear the purple glens roplung : Blow, bugle ; answer, echoes, djing, djiug, d)lng. " 0 lo\o, they die In yon Hoh skj, They faint on hill, or field, or river, Our echoes roll from soul to soul. And grow for ever and for over. Blow, bugle, blow, set tho wild echoes flying. And answer, echoes, answer, dying, dying, dying " In 1850 appeared "In Memoriam " Seventeen years before, a very dear and highly gifted friend of the poet, Arthur Hallam, had died in Vienna. This memorial poem is composed of a. series of short odes, written under the influence, more or leas remote, of grief for the lost and finally laid-a wreath of violets, a chaplet of immortelles, on a long cold grave In the series of monodies, or medita- tions, which compose it, the poet never moves away from the grave of his friend, but, while circling round it, has always a new point of view. Strength of love, depth of grief, aching sense of loss have driven him forth, as it were, in quest of consolation, and he asks it of Nature, thought, re- ligion, in a hundred forms, all of them con- nected by one central point-the recollection of the departed. This work he prosecutes, not in a vain, effeminate complaint, but in manly recognition of the fruit and profit even of baffled love, in noble suggestions of the future, in heart soothing and chastening thoughts of what the dead was, and of what he is, of the mystery of life, and the everlast- ing destiny of man. Thus he finds an analogy between the resting place of the dead and the heart that enshrines his memory : "The Danube to tho Severn gave The darkened heart that beat no more , They laid him by tho pleasant shore, And in tho hearing of tho wave "There twice a day tho Severn fills ; The salt sea water passes by, And hushes half tho babbling Wye, And makes a silence in tho hills. " The \V)o Is hush'd nor mot ed along, And hush'd my decpost grlof of nil, VA lien tilled w ith tears that cannot fall, I brim with sorrow drowning song " Tho Udo flows down, the wavo again Is vocal In its wooded walls ; My doepcr anguish also falls. And 1 eau speak a little then n In the waldies of the night his thoughts take a direction which will not seem strange ¿o those of us who have loved and lost : " When on my bod tho moonlight falls I know that In thy placo of rest, By that broad water of the west. There comos a glory on tho walls " Thy marblo bright in dark appeals, As slowly steals a Bilver flamo Along- tho letters of thy name, And o'er tho number of thy years " Tho mj sue glory swims aw ay : l'roin off my bed tho moonlight dies ; And closing caves of wearied oyes, I sleep till dusk Is dipt In gray, " And thon I know tho mist is drawn A lucid v eil from coast to coast, And In the dark church like a ghost Thy tablot glimmers to tho dawn." In 1855 came "Maud," a Btrange, somewhat wild poem, the hero of which has a vein of insanity in his nature. When his passionate brooding spirit is half redeemed from itself by Maud's gentle iniluence, all their luture is wrecked by events which culminate in a duel with her brother, the exile and brain fever of her lover, who, on his recovery, joinB the Crimean army to die far away from that .England to which he can never return. About the love strain, which ia the sou) of this poem, the other passages group them- selves, like pitchy clouds about the moon, to the great motease of its loveliness, and their own sombre gloom. Here is a passage m which the wretched exile, lingering through a dreary convalescence m Pans, speaks of the haunting phantom of his dead love, with sweet memory pictures, but framed with despair, of the happy past, when tho birds Bang, and the rose Hung penunie round, and the tall dark cedars looked down on the "old old story " : 41A Bhadow flits bofore me 1 Not thou, but like to thee, Ah I Christ, that it woro possible For one short hour to seo The souls wo loved, that tiley might tell us What and where the> bo It leads mo forth at ovenlng, It lightly winds and steals In a cold whito robo botoro me, *-V hen all my spirit rcelB At the shouts, the lenguón of lights, And tho roaring of tho w noels. " Thro' tho hubbub of tho market I steal, a wasted framo, It crosses hore, it crosses there, Thro* all that crowd, confused and loud, Tho shadow still tho carno , And on my heavy evclids My anguish banes liko shame Alas, for hor that mot me, That heard mo softly call, Came glimmering through the laurels At tho quiot ovcnfall. In tho garden hy tho turrets Of tho old manorial ball ' ' In 1859 he published the "Id)Ila of the King," four poems, to which, in 1870 and 1872, six more have been added, making ten books of "The Epic of Arthur"-that hero Iiiug ot the Britons who kept the invading Saxons at bay all his life, 11 And In twelve great battles ovoroirao The heathon hordes, and made a realm and reigned " The poem sets before us the grand purpose of the King, to regenerate it land that had fallen into brutal barbarism, to trample down nil tyranny and wrong, and bring in the reign of peace and law. v\ e aee how thia purpose was thwarted, theso aims wrecked, by the pruilt of Queen Guinevere, which gradually ruined the purity and high honour of his court, and sapped the _lo) alty of his knights Jrom book to book 'we trace tho gradual progress of the mischief ; the firBt breath of suspicion in "Enid ," the common scandal in " Vivian," in " Elaine," the fearful fashion in which the hot iron of evil passions had branded the hearts of Lancelot and Guine- vere ; in the "Holy Grail," the loss of Arthur's goodliest knights m fruitless adven- ture ; in " Pclleaa and Etlaire," the horror of ti pure noble soul on finding that what it deemed well nigh divine is false and foul as nfiend ; in the "LastTournament," the de cencrocy to which tho cankering curse had brought the Knights of the Hound Table ; 5n " Guinevere," the thunder-clap of discovery tor tho Queen, nnd for Arthur tho shadow of despair : in the " Passing of Arthur," ruin and wreck, battle and murder, and the scene closes over the black barge bearing the dying King far nway over a mjBtenons seo. In 18G4 appeared " Enoch Arden," a tale ot bumble life a hundred ) ears ugo. The story of the Bailor, who, after ten »ears on a desert island, returns to find his wile married again, nnd liiB children lost to lum, is very pathetlcall) told, especial!) where he takes one dcapairing look at the sweet domestic happi xieas long lost, and now for others' sake sur- rendered. With the iaiger poems have nppeared from time to time many minor ones, as "The Brook," with tile w11 known murmuring song ot the stream running through it the "Northern larmer," mid man) others. Ills dramas--"Queen Mar)," "Hniold," "The Cup,' " Becket"-uhow more of the poet than the plii)nght lim lost volume but one, "lialluds and Other I'oems," contains n noble example of the Bort of poem which, m the words ot Sir Philip bidney, "stirs one's heart like a trumpet ' liobert Browning presents in many respects a remarkable contrnst to 'Jennyson Both thes-e poets have interested themselves dei ply in the delineation of human character und in the unknown mysteries ot the universe. But Jn the manner ot their dealing with them there is nn absolute contrast To put it roughl', 'lenn)son never writes about them n line that does not bsse itsclt upon some common thought,! "What ott waa thought, but ne'er so well expressed ," Browning never puts donn nn idea which could well have occurred to any innn but himself J ennyson is nlwaj a trying to adapt himself to others, nnd bring them near to lum , Drowning, to pever himself from others, hold them at arm's length, and to look at them from without ti lie whole effort ot lenn) Bon is to obtain a mastery over common things ; of Browning, to discover things that are not common ¡Moroover, browniiu'fl fault« lie on the sur face, lind, like ii 1 let-passcrs will be prose- cuted,' they often se ire leaders from ven turing further 'J i inn son a uro not so easily (letected, and consul ruthci in the absence of what might be desired than in the pre- sence ot blemishes. Browning is thorough diamond, 'lcnnyeon is cut and polished ; but some admirers of the former maintain that he would far outweigh the latter. This naturally suggests that as wo renewed first the beauties ot Tennyson, not only as being most obvious, but also as largely determining the estimation in which he ia held by the general public, ao now, for the same reason, we should note the fiults ot Browning _. And first and worst 13 his obscurity. And this often arises not from any depth of thought, nor even from terseness or any intricacy of poetic expression, but simply trora clumsiness of language-from careless neos, 111 met Vie find infinitives without their particles leoung out of definite and indefinite uriicles contusion and omission of pronouns, adjectives pining for their feub stantüeb, prepositions and other Bmull words docked of their last letters, sentences pre- maturely killed off by interjections, or cut bhort in their career by other sentences, parenthesis within parenthesis, all kinds of irregular forms of .peech for which gram- marians ever invented hard names, puzzling allusionstoobscurepersonsttiid facts as though they were perfectly familiar to the reader Again, his versification is often BO rugged thutyou are perplexed to find it divided into lines, without which you would not have dreamt of its being poetry ; and he has a weakness for absurd do^grel rhymes, w Inch, though they may help to make a comic passage more funny, yet introduced, OB they often are by him, into serious and even pathetic passages, quite spoils their eflect lhe writer who does not seem himself to bo m earnest can hardly win the reader's sym- pathy. Imagine Nelson as Browning describes him " Leaning with 0110 shoulder digging. Jigging, ns itvvoro, and zig na- nigging Up against the mi-ïn rigging * You can hardly believe that he is really ad- miring the grand old religious writer here "Tho sermon proves no reading Whero, bcc-llko, In tho flowers I may bury mo Llko Taylors, the immortal Jeremy." Most of Ins poems consist of monologue-a long Bpeech put into the mouth of some person, often nn historical chnractcr, ia which he gradually opens out his past inner history, the spunga of his action, the circum- stances that blue mude him the man he is Thus trom other writers and from paintings we moy leam concerning the monks and knights of the Middle Ages what they did and now they looked , but Browning aims at showing how they felt, so that we may un- derstand them and put ourselves in their place. We must go back to Shakspearo before we shall lind Browning's equal in character painting, so keen ia his intuition, BO vi! id his conception, so firm and sure his hand in execution, BO thoroughly living is the outcome of his art Both he and Tennyson ha! tí, in their several ways, given us splendid portraitures of .men and women, but in their methods there is the Bftine difference as between Rembrandt and Titian The latter entrances y ou by the per- fection of Ins finish, by the charm of his accessories, so that yon can scarcely dissoci- ate the human ligure from its exquisite sur- roundings ; but in the former you can see nothing but the face that rises out ot the canvas to meet you, that holds you spell- bound with its eyes, whose featurea thrill yon with strange revealinga of the paBt, till you murmur, 111 an awe- struck wlnaper - "'lhe man ia alive I" Perhaps the only Haw in his paintings of character ia that lie sometimes does not give us what in all probability his personages would have thought nnd .felt, but what lie (Browning himeelt) would have thought and felt in their place, BO that they appear far more keen ana clever and philosophical than it is likely they ever were Looking upon him as a whole, he must unquestionably be considered one of the most original, though alao one of the least popular, poets of the present day. He was born near Loudon in 1812\. Hia first poems-" Paracelsus," "Sor dcllo," "a-carne out in 183b Being uninte- resting m story, and "hard reading withal, they were not popular. In 18515 came Men and Ir'omeii, a work which dmplaya all Ina excellences and olten none of bia delects, containing poems which for depth and sub- tlety of conception, searching out of the human mind, and far-reaching, soaring thought, are unsurpassed in the english lan- guage. Besides the above, ho has written a vost number of poems, some long, aome short, some that a philosopher may long ponder over, some that a schoolboy can appreciate and enjoy. It is not easy to pick out passogea to show "beautieB" of Browning One might aa well show a pillar as a specimen ot a palace, or a tree aa a specimen of a landscape.

After her marriage with Bobert Browning, the poet, in 181G, her failing health compelled them to reside in Italy, and in the weltare of her adopted country Bhe woa keenly in- terested, net most touching and vigorous poetry relates to the sorrows and hopes of Italy, which she loved so well, and which has Biiown itself not ungrateful to her memory, b\ an inscription set over the door of the house in which she lived at Florence, sajing " She made of her verse a golden link between England and Italy" Her poem of "Casa Guuli \\\ indows ' appeared in 1851, when the Itulian revolutions of 1848 and 1849 kindled her indignation at foreign oppression, and her longings for Italian libcrt). It embodies u norrative of the events vv Inch passed under her windon s at riorence. Her greatest poem is " Aurora Leigh," the uutobiography of a poetess, corresponding in many points to her own hie.

She has been blamed for it, but it is the ruggedness of the God gifted motor, who, full of burning thoughts cares not to pick and choose the daintiest words to utter them, but pours his heart's torrent from bia lips, while the apell bound hearers cannot heed the mere words, because the thoughts leap as lightning into their souls How the poetess could sympa- thise with liuman suffering, could plead the cause of the vv eak, and champion the side of tho little friendless ones whom the iron heel of commerce ground down in factory and brickyard and gloomy minc, we may see in " The Cr) of the Children," and few can read unmoved the passionate appeal .

Let them weep 1 let them wocp 1 ' Within the last few years a class of poetry altogether novel boa sprung np, which takes the classic legends, the old fairy tales of Greece, or the Sagas of the Norsemen na its main theme Of this school William Morris IB the chief writer He takes those old world tales, tlint the Classical Dictionary tia spatches in a few lines, and weaves of them tascinating romances of gods and heroes, of dragons and charmed swords and magic music, even such stones as held the hearers apell bound 8,000 >eara ago These stones, thus told as we may lmugine they were tola nt first, have lost noneof theirdehghtfuluess If the ancients still move and charm us, it is because wo are in our hearts even such men na they, beholding the Burne Bun, feeling the same wants, and suffering the same changes, and the themes of those old ballads which rang through their halls, when the wine cup shone and tho banquet waa spread, ond ot those diumua which held breathless their assembled cities, are the same themes which stir our hearts y et, and so long as patriotism and courage, andselt forgetting devotion, and dauntless endurance have any hold upon our admiration and S) mpathy, so long shall those notes of .the lyres of long ago find an answering chord within our bosoms. The etyle of Morris ia a perfect contrast to that of Browning So clear, so easy flowing is it, that one need never pause to ponder on the meaning of tins or that expression, and one would scarcely notice the words of the story at all were it not that they make such soft sweet melody. It is as if each tale waa told to the muaical low-murmuring flow of some brook that is gliding under trees where doves coo and the breeze rustles softly. There ia a dreamy tone in these poems, and they carry with them the buiden of a strange weariness and sadness. They are tales which tell of high hopes and heroic deeds, they paint the joys o£ youth, and the mighty achievements ot dauntless men ; but haunt- ing all there is some touch of melancholy, Borne foreshadowing of sorrow, because death must one day come, and to those sunny natured Greeks of old lue waa very fair and bright, and death so dark and cold, because they could not look beyond, nor discern a better country. Morris's principal works on these subjects ate the "Life and Death ot Jason," telling how heroes went to win the Golden Fleece, and all the wild adven- tures that befel them, and the "Earthly Paradiae," conaisting ot four largo volumes full of old tales of Greece and Norway and Iceland. Besides these Morris has written a vast quantity of poetry, but all on very simi- lar themes " laies that tho soul of j outh ongage, Ero fnnoj has been quelled, Old legends of tho monkish pago. Traditions of tbo saint and sago, Talcs that haie the rhno otago, And chronicles of eld " I will give you tin extract from one of bis last poems, "The Story of Sigurd," a tale of the old Norse heroes In this, though we find the same undercurrent of sadness, the style is changed In place of the dreamy softness of the "Earth!) Paradise," we have a lier) energy and vigour that Beem born of the roaring winda and tempestuous seas with which our old forefathers were so familiar. "SIOUBDS IttTUlcN MIOSI WAR."

The fun- damental feature which gives tins class of writing its name consists in appealing, not to the intellect and the soul, not to the im- agination and the aflections, but to the senses and the npnmtes The sensational writer deals with b nilly mutend of mental pleasures and palin- senaationa as distin- guished from thoughts and emotions.
