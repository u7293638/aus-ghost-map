PFORTFOLIO. " Faith is the evidence of things not seen." Our S viour is now:more especially an ob. ject of faith; since He is removed far above outof our sight, living. and reigning with' the Father and the Holy Ghost for ever in heaven. It was counted praise tf St. Thomas, that he believed bemanse he had seen Christ-pointed blessing is to those who beliere, though they see not: " Blessed are thli'athey have not seeld, and yet have b14. lieied." And shall we in very deeddwell with:Goil Shall this mortal pot on im anortality-shall weakness become power and dishonor glory!' The hedrt of man cah conceive no such change. Yet, so changed we shall be; the word of truth hath spoken it Thlnbody- now suhject to 'a thousand ills, from accident and disease, and soon to be minglest with corruption-shall be, one day, like unto Christ's glorious body; shall know neither decay nor sickness, ihor pain, nor diminution of strengthb nor fading of beauty, but shall live tor ever, restored to its original excellence; acknowledged in its new teation-`" very good." .Ior is this all. A brighter glory yet-awaits us. The soul-no longerdebased; by its present in firmiities,,relea~ed from the entanglements of the world,and free tiet he exeirciseof it high powers, fearlessi of evil, becansayinc torious over sii -shall be united with that glorified body, and so become meet for the society of angels, and of juit men moade perfect ; meet to live even with Christ, who went before to prepare a place for us, and gave His Spirit to renew us in His image, that, united to Him here, we might here after dwell with Him, and thle Father, and tile Holy Ghost; might see God, as He is face to face, and live for ever in the light of His countenance. Who is the inexhians tible Fountain of tile light of joy, -and the Author and Giver of life everlasting.,-Re. Jokii Janicma, D.D.V
