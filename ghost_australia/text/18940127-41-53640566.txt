THE CYCLORAMA. Visitors' were at the Cyclorama last evening in large numbers. After inspection of the exquiaito picture - and tha giving of Mr. Lockley'a interesting lecture, tho ghost of Napoleon came out and the enchnnted fountain started its surprising gambols, to the delight of the spectators. One can quite imagine himself in fairyland when gazing on tho wonderful ooloura and changes that the fountain assumes.
