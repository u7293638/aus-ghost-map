Instead of a minute, 1 must have been sleeping for nearly two hours. "W as it likely vbat either of the other occupants of the house would be still up, and ever if they were, 1 what could tbey possibly want in that gallery at such an hour? I knew lhat.it led only to rooms disused apd shut up; and I began to think of the situation of those rooms, and to remember that they must of necessity look out into tbe coppice, wliere the ghost's •talk took its ris«. It was midnight, and I was alone; moreover, my life at Raven tree had been little calculated to strengthen me against euch thoughts as came upon me then, and the shadow that lurked underneath the fine reasonings with which I sought to satisfy myself, gave the lie to their efficacy. Unexplained stories came, before me at thia untoward season, and on the threshold of problems which have never yet been solved, and to the consideration of which both tbe daring and the timid bring a certain awe, I baited. I could not at that hour affirm distinctly my disbelief in ghostly visitants, though I might have done so in the morning light. If, indeed, I argued, no such appearances were possible, how was it that, from the remotest ages of uaan . . the very air around had been endued ; with a . subtle power to threaten the living with the dread presence of the dead ? ': •• The very fact of Gepffry Fernham's endden obange froos -prodigality to pennripuaness became invested wjth a certain tragic interest, as I thought of it then, in connection;with its mysterious canbe. There was, however, something about my stepfather himpelfwhich repelled interest. Absent from him, one might think of him with eprt-of sympathy : in his presence, the thought uppermost in my own mind was always ' Keep out of his wayand when morning came, and I saw bim silent and nngeni&l; sb usual, I forgot the dignity which last night had thiown about his atopy.;: y. 6 • To the fact thut I had counted the hours, as; they ^struck in,i tbe distant: town, with, sleepless weariness tillday-! light, might be attributed :the heaviness and oppression which hung over' the whole'day. I rose with a' load at my heart; I (went past thfc entrance to that gallery, with.ii shudder; 1 stood at the hull door, japd the euri was shining over tbe de'wy Jawns, but I looked from them to tbedatk coppice, with its rank vege-. tatipD; and its impenetrable depths of gloom'; and said to myself again and again, 'If I ,could but getaway from this horrid plqco!' In the evening I went to the red pool; I sat watching the silver willows dip their branches into,it, and thinking how dark and cold it looked, till at last a phantom figure seemed to glide from amongst the. acacias and beeches and come towards me. It was growing late and I went home. A glance at Martha's face, as I met her in the ball, told me that something unusual bad occurred, end, to my astonishmen t, she spoke. , 1 Mark Fernham is in there.' •Who is Mark Fernham ?! "Your friend the gardener might have told you, 1 said Murtha. ( But you are right to look surprised it is unusual for Raventr^e to be honored with a visitor. Mark Fernham is the next heir —come to see how long hia enemy can last.' 'Is he going to stay here ?' 'No visitor fleeps in this bouse.' 1' followed Martha to the kitchen. I did not care then about Mark Fernbam. I wanted to get out of my own thoughts and the ghoBt; I wanted to bold some kind of communion with a living woman like myself. But Martha sat down to her koitting without manifesting either surprise at my presence or inclination to attend to e. n'l am cold,' I said, leaning over a chair-back, and looking at her. 'I vender if you know, Martha, what a strange dismal life this is at Raven tree, or has long habit robbed it for you of its dreariness ?' For a moment the heavy lids were lifted, and tbe cold eyes fell upon me speculatively. ' Dismalrepeated Martha. ' Yes, dismal,' I said boldly ; ' I am used to merry companions; I don't like solitude; and besides, you know Raven tree is haunted.' The dull speculative look changed into one of sheer amazement as Ifinished mf speech, and the knitting rieedleB woiked away faster than ever: M - , ' Haunted !'.ejaculated:MarfJia at last, just in the same tone ajsjlier former exclamation. \ , ' Did you ever see the ghost ?' I asked. ' J have seen nothing worse than myself,' said Martha scornfully.- ' As lor your merry companions, hadn't you better go and talk to Mark Fernham there ? 'No, I would rather talk to you.' < But I have nothing to talk about,! responded Martha, looking down decidedly at her work; 'and I am not fond of being talked to either.' I turned awav, and went to my own room. Before I reached it th> re were voices in the hall, and I heard -my stepfather say rather gruffly, ' Yes, you can shoot as much as you like; I haven't tbe least objection to that.' And then the hall-door close'!, and atl was quiet. (To be Continued.)
