Cricket. UNIONS v. GAWLER SOUTH. 1 The-newly formed Gawler South Club played their first match on Saturday last, on the Recreation Ground, their opponents being the Unions. To the efforts of W. Churchman, an old highly esteemed Gawler crickhter, belongs the honor of organising the club, and although victory aid not crown their efforts on this occasion they are to be congratulated on their first performance. Going in first they pnt on no less than 111, of which Bright contributed 60, Churchman 14, and Hine 13, Bright was in good form, and played very fairly, but he gave a couple of very easy chances to Brophy and E. H. Coombe when he was about 15, which marred his otherwise firstclass performance. Churchman played carefully for his runs, but did not forget to bit on the leg side when opportunity offered. Although a little stiff it is evident it would not take him long to get into form. When Simpson and Holt, who were the first representatives for the Unions, took thfir places it was thought that 111 would not be reached, but events proved otherwise, for both men speedily settled down to work, and scored at a terribly rapid rate, all the bowlers being treated alike, and when 90 went np without a separation it was thought they would pull off the match themselves. However, when the score stood at 95 Holt skied one, and had to retire for a finely-made 45, without a ghost of a chance. Simpson continued to score until at 108 Tardif beat him. His score of 56 was a capital performance, his driving being very hard and clear. A. floss and Coombe were then together, and juet succeeded in making the winning hit off the last ball of the over in which six o'clock had previously gone. The bowling on both sides was very poor.
