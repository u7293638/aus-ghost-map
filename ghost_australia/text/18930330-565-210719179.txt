Then, dearest, to tl.e ancient vine, in sculptured beauty rare, Bovi-down ihy red, arched lip and quaff The wine that conquers care ; And breathe upon the glowing cup, Till thus ita perfumes be Sweet hs Lhe scent of the orauge groves Upon some tropic sea. The while the fingers i By stray In dalliance o'er the lyre, Sing to me love, some rare old song That gushed from heart of fire — Song such as Grecian phalanx hymned. When freedom's field was won, Aud Persia's glory, with the light, Faded at jlarethou. Sing till the 8bonts of armed men King bravely out once mora 1. Sing till again the ghost-white tents Shine ou the moonlit shore .' Bid from their melancholy grates The buried hopfcg to start, I knew ere many a storm had swept The dewdropa from ray heari. Sing the deep memories of the past ! My soul shall follow thee — Its boundless depths are echoing Thy glorious minstrelsy ; And as the sweets vibrations hang Enfettered on the air. I'll drink, thv white arms round me, love, The wiae that conquers care.
