'Midst enemies both bold and strong flat Charles the First at table, long With calm end nohle lace, On trial, and compelled to hear A Cromwell mock, a Btadsbaw jeer, And falsely tax His Grace.

When death rides the storm and the turbnlent ocean, With terror inspires the poor mariner's heart; How painful tbe trial, how great the commotion, How bitter tbe tears from bis eyeballs that start?
