WE, the undersigned, passengers by the above ship from Melbourne to Maryborough, feel it incumbent, prior to leaving the ship, to adopt some medium to indicate our gratitude for the kind and gentlemanly treatment that we have individually and collectively experienced at all time from Captain Logan. We must also pay tribute to Captain Logan's unceasing watchful- ness and vigilance to the navigation of his ship, and to his extreme thoughtfulness and attention to the comfort and well-being of his passengers during a passage in which we had some very rough weather. We also conceive it to be a duty to thank the Chief Officer, Mr. Clark, for his many kindnesses, and we have also great measure in bearing testimony to the able and energetic manner in which he has discharged the onerous duties he had to perform.—(Signed) Robt. Laurie, J. Blyth, H. Rich, Jas Hunter, F. Long, and 306 others. The S. M. Herald of June 25 says:—" The brig Governor, 147 tons, belonging to Messrs. R. Towns and Co., proceeds, in the course of a day or two, to Sweer's Island, Gulf of Carpentaria, under the command of Captain Robinson. She is to be placed there as a receiving ship for wool, &c.;, and has been specially fitted up by the firm for that purpose. A powerful hydraulic press has been placed on board, so that wool brought down from the several rivers by the steamer Pioneer, will be properly pressed ready for ship- ment to England. A regular housing, fore and aft, has been constructed, which will be perma- gently fitted on the vessel's arrival at the Gulf." She cleared out at the Sydney Customs, for Sweer's Island, via Brisbane, on June 26th, with a general cargo. We understand that she only calls at Brisbane for the purpose of receiving a number of police troopers as passengers to the Gulf.
