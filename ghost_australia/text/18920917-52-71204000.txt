How Snakes Shed their Skins. -'Everyone is aware that snakes shed their Bkins at certain periods ; but comparatively few know the-- precise manner in which the operation is effected. Most people seem to think that the snake crawls forth from his skin as from a tunnel. This is not so. The skin that is shed is only a thin epidermis covering the scales or true skin. When shedding time comes round this splits, usually at the back of the neck, and the snake wriggles out by degrees, turning the skin inside out in the process. The writer recently watched the operation per- formed by ene of two grass snakes in his posses- sion, and this is how it was done. Commencing from the nose, the skin of his head turned back so completely that the animal looked just as though he was swallowing himself backwards. About 3in had peeled off when I first observed him. I found it quite impossible to peel any more off without tearing the skin. In a few hours, however, he had peeled more than half his body. The process was effected by continually passing among the grass and stones, and so brushing the skin backwards. The other snake had shed about half his skin when a slight sore caused it to adhere to his body. The peeled portion at once began to swell, and increased to nearly twice its normal size before tho sufferer hid his head among the stones and gave up the ghost. _
