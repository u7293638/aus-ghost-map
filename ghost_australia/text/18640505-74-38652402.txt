Tun GnosT on DOARD TiEa GasAT Easoaen. -Tae Liverpool Albion states that, in the course of i paper tred by Captain Paton, relative to the repairs of the Grcit Eastern, he staled thai anl impression got aboard that sbip was Ihaunted, the alleged ' ghost Leiug that of an unfortunaote rivetter, who was Ieard plying his avocation In one of the wells or compartmentis. Capain Paten stated that before the vessel left tlhis country, lie believed that one of the men employed in lier construction was missing. The tan was a rivetter i he was missed from the ship, and never sine:for his wages, the supposition being that lie had been rivetted up in a part of lie vessel. Sc firtmlyimpresacditere omeic of thie men with thills tln, that they left the ship in consequence. They aflirmed that they had heanrd their departed friend busil√Ω engaged rivettiag in the mtiddlo of the night. The story was believed Iy many per sons in New York, and on one occasion while the ship was under repair a diver signalled to he drown up. lie nppeared pile with fright, and !cclared the ghost of the rivretter was busy en gaged in the bottom part of the ship; Iu fact, lhat ihe began rivettiog immediately over his head. Such was tihe consterlntion among theo divers, that they called in the aid of one of itho spirit mediums, who are somewhat numerous in the city of New York. The medium canne on board and after an examination declared that the mi.sing man was there both "tin body and spirit." Fortunately ho (Captain 'Paton) by pure accident was enabled to dispel tioe illusion. Being in a boat near Ilo bows of the s?ip, he discovered that a swivel connected with tile moorings worked to and fro, the movement causing a chink of vibro. tion which, at times, more especially at night, wais heard throughout tile vessel. It waoes this sound which had conjured, in connection with tire supposed fate of the tnfortunato rivetter, tile phantom nlhose mysterious doings spread such consternation Oni board the big ship.
