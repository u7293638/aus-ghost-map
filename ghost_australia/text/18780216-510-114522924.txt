Tho poor beast understood what was whispered by thn breeze. There wai no snow on his back— not yet— but the hone know what was meant by tho wind. The dittcr of tho pack was not loud— would not have been at another place— but the lost man started and looked quickly about him ; Lo feared that tho huge peaks standing around might be startled into lotting' fall the gmat rocks lying in thoir laps.
