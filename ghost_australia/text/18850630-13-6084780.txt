A decidedly more business like tone was in- fused into the betting than has hitherto been the case, several nominations having been supported, though not to any large amount at any one instance Mr. Bulley a name was the first booked, 500 to lb being taken, and the same price was accepted as to Mr Chirnside to a couple of hundreds, the taker wanting to go on at the figure Mr Cool son was backed to win £200 to 3 sovereigns and then 300 to 12 and 200 to 5 were respectively taken about Mr Cole On Mr W M'Culloch a name being called, 100 to b was offered, but although he was persistent at 20 to 1 he subsequently accepted 300 to IS Something similar happened with respect to the new nomination of Mr Colin M'Culloch the presumed Glenroy second string At brat 50 to 1 was called for, which, however, ended in £1,200 being taken at 100 to 3 the Sydney nomination of Mr A L Park was genuinely introduced, a commission being apparently in the market, to offers of "100 to 1, the commissioner wanted 1,000 to V>, but he subsequently relaxed, and appropriRed £700 at the former figure, than expressing a willingness to go on as long as 60 to 1 would be laid , but the business all at once collapsed, with nothing more liberal than 100 to J offered Mr Renwick s name was first of all written to £1,00 at 60 to 1, and then 200 to 5 was taken twice, which would indicate that the veteran courier is provided with a representative able to take his part on the day, whatever it may turn out to be. Mr Rounsevell was backed to win 1,000 at 100 to S and the only other transactions were 400 to 0 Mr Swan, and SOO to 24 Mr. W Whittingham The following prices were wanted about the succeeding. nominations Mr Lord, 100 to 1 10 to 1 oil ), Mr J M'Culloch 50 to 1, Mr. Neustetel, 50 tolls to 1 off ), Mr. Pearce, 20 to, Mr Stinker, 100 to, Mr Thomas, 100 to.
