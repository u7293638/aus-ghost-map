THE SIN OF OMISSION. It isn't ihe thing you do, dear. It's the thing that you leave undone, Which gives you a bit of a heartache At the setting of the sun. The tender word forgotten, Th« letter you did not write. The flower you might have sent, dear. Are y nr ha intiog ghosts to-night. The stone yon mieht have lifted f Out of a brother's way. The bit of heartsome counsel You were hurried too much to say. The loving touch o' the hand, dear, Th« g*ntle and winsome t< ne, That you had no time nor thought for, With troubles enough of your own. These little acts of kindness, So easily out of mind, The*e chances to be angels Which even mortals find— They come in night and silence, Kach chill, reproichful wraith, When hop*- is faint and flagging. And a blight has drooped on faith. For life is all too short, dear, And sorrow is all too great. To suffer our slow compassion That tarries until too late. And it's not the thing you do, dear, It's the thing yon leave undone, Which gives you the bitter heartache At the setting of the sun. MARGABET E. SANGSTES.
