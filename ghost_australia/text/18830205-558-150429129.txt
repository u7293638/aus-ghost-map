ADULTERATION. Some of the eccentricities of modern Adulteration are delicately disclosed to the commonwealth of consumers by a con temporary German satirist, in the follow ing neat little fable :—" There wore once four flies, and as it happened, they were hungry one morning. The first settled upon a sausage of singularly appetising appearance, and made a hearty meal. But he speedily died of intestinal inflam mation, for the sausage was adulterated with ailine. The second fly breakfasted upon flour and forthwith succumbed to contraction of the stomach, owing to the inordinate quantity' of alum with which the flour had been adulterated. The third fly was slaking his thirst with the contents of the milk jug, when violent cramps sud denly convulsed his frame, and ho soon gave up the ghost, a victim to chalk adul teration. Seeing this, the fourth fly, muttering to himself, ' the sooner it's over the sooner to sleep,' alighted upon a moistened sheet of paper exhibiting the counterfeit presentment of a death's head, and the inscription ' Fly Poison.' Apply ing the tip of his proboscis to this device, the fourth fly drank to his heart's content, growing more vigorous and cheerful at every mouthful, although expectant of his end. But he did not die. On the con trary, he throve and waxed fat. You see even the fly poison was adulterated — New York Jtfedical liccord.
