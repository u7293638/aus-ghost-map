KADINA AND ITS PUBLIC MAN. ANOTHER PACT. Sib.—I read in jour valuable paper, the Inspector for the town asked for inforraatibn in respect to the by-laws. At the Corpora tion meeting, Cr. Lang is reported to have said tbey should be carried out and a propo sition carried to that effect (ride Wallaroo Times, I?ov. 18.) Might I ask how the worthy Councillor can reconcile that resolu tion with the fact of his publicly advertising a violation of one of the by-laws on Saturday last. One of the said by-laws* is that no horse3 or cattle shall be sold -within the town of Kadina on a Saturday. Surely Sir, it is inconsistent in one who takes an active part in passing these laws, immediately to repudiate them, though I see he supports the Ius pec tor in carrying out some, such as hanging out a tinpot or a piece of cloth, neither of which of course affect hijii. There is one question I should like .to ask. Did the Inspector attend the sale and inform Mr Lang that he was violating a Kaiina by-law ? Echo answers, Ho! I have been much amused with the writings of the Walking Ghost,, and agree with you that such writings do good in a community when free from personalities; for no society or community i can advance without a healthy opposition, | and the sooner abuses are exposed in a rational way, the sooner they are amended. I think some of the by-laws are years before their time* bnt if they are to be operative, let there he no cliqueisni or favoritism. L«t Walking Ghost take heart, and inform one ho tried to ridicule hitn, that many are too fond of using XXX, who when looking in the ' g'.ass, saw there the reflex of an Ass.-— I am, ] A KESIDENT.
