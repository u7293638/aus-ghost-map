An enterprising publican of -Barcaldine im- ; ported a 3 cwfc. turtle to the city of sand by train (says the Champion). It was chained by ! its front leg to the cooking caboose, where its , owner contemplated it should remain a prisoner until the eve of Christmas Day, when all the town was to partake of real turtle soup. ! We regret very much to hear that the interest ing stranger* refused to fall in with the hospitable views of its proprietor, and when that gentleman interviewed bis property, he dis covered it had given up the ghost. Determined not to lose his prey so easily he seized a largo carving knife and cut the poor animal's throat, but it was too late. The vital spark had lied, j and the owner of the uncanny- looking carcase is in treaty with some Chinese residents for tho purchase of what he gravely informs them is 44 welly good chow chow ; alleesame as beechy demurr." But up to latest date the innocent Chinkcc has not taken delivery of the turtle.
