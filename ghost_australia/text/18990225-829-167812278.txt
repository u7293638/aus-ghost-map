Hugo d'A16si, (he' well-known'painter of poster The fine building for .the Marioramui, which has beenalready. begun/will be erected at the comer of the Quai.d'brsay and the Avenue deSuflren. The numerous specta tors who will doubtless throng'to this curious spectacle will he.able to' take- a veritable sea voyage without moving from their place. -1 ' i ! • " ; Hugo d'Alfiai has revived [thejait; of "the .ptmorpnia ctshehas done(fhat, of the which jp%t|tar .him^ j^H _ \--f .illjmgn .ftjcupKr;? the. masts, be ,thejmip]^g. funni^the Tew vrorkfngihe o the captain's ,ordens.l;._3he ,jdgnal b given for starting, the anchorsare uised, the siren whistles, the waves ipple along -tEe* ad«Tb£ lihe vessel. Hie windsails, turned towards the travellers. blow into' their faces the bracing sea-wind, impregnated with the smell of toe sea by its passage across a bed of sea-weed. At the same tone the living .panorama of Marseilles slides to the rear, and there begins to unroll on both sides of the ship—to port and to star board ■.— the canvas, about 16 yards in height, and a kilometre (over .1000 yards) in length, representing, with - the-perfection that may be expected from the pencil of Hugod'Aldsi, all the. places and all the scenery .of the voyage. The following phenomenon is fa-, miliar to everybody: The movement of an object which occupies the whole field of vision gives to the spectator at rest the illusion that it is himself that is moving. Thus in a train which is stationary, when another train moves past us, it seems to. us that it is our stationary traip that is moving forward. The Mariora/ma, ' depends' on'-il lusion of this kind, carried out With, extreme ingenuity, and rendered complete by the movements of the vessel, the lighting effects, the bracing sea-breeze, charged , with iodine and salt, which cuts the faces of the travellers. The vessel is fixed on a spherical pivot, and worked by four pistons, in front and behind, which give it the rolling and pitching motion. They can attain the intensity neces sary for assisting the illusion of a storm, and they will attain it, for the Mariorama offers its passengers a storm, which the timid fair ones can watch under cover of the deck from the portholes. This will no doubt be the most appreciated of .aff-.the episodes of the voyage, which in cludes many others, such as a night effect, a sunrise effect, the meeting with a squadron, local scenes, the embarkation of - a Turkish harem at Sfax, boatmen and boatwomen clam; bering up the sides of the-vessels and dancing the tarantella on board, the Naples fleet, etc., etc. . Let-us also mention a detail which, if it does not add to the illusion-of the voyage, will certainly add to. the pleasure of the travellers, namely, a great symphony, performed by , an invisible orchestra, varied and -as it were, tinged with the iooal colpnr.oE each dime, which wiU aocompany the travellers from beginning.to end of the voyage. . . ... Who will now venture to say that we are making no progress t The wonderful carpet of the Arabian Tales, which in the twinkling of an eye transported from one end of the world to another the Kalenders who . were befriended by. the genie, was but a sorry means of transport, which lost all the charm of the voyage and gave only its movement The real problem for the man of to-day, mentally adventurous but physically indolent and of sedentary habits, was to offer all the charms of travel without any exertion,. This combination, which seemed chimeri cal, has been brilliantly contrived by 1L Hugo d'Al&si;, and beyond all doubt bis McLrifordma will achieve an immense success. - , A,sovereign quite out of the -com mon is ejected to visit Paris shortly.

Will it be poetry oT-proee I' This question remains to besolvisd. 1 ■ 'There still remain1 to be published about fifteen volumes by the master. What a laborious and indefatigable braih it was ! Aithough these last fragments of his ineessant labour do not, it must be admitted, possess the worth of the chapters hitherto pub-, lished, we still find admirable things in.tbie accumulation of pages apd of thoughts. . The difficulty is to ar range and select, for ultimately some omissions must. be made. Of this delicate task Paul Meurice alone bears the responsibility since Vac querie has gone. In the. approaching publication, the poetry will, we think, prevail; these will be 300 pages of detached verses, forming a corresponding volumetothe '' Songs of .Twilight" andthe KAdfcumn Leaves."

A melancholy list of names i There are already many bf those who led the music for the • multitudinous dance, who now sleep six feet below the turf. The first was the elder Musord, the apostle of the cancan, to whom. his contemporaries paid a veritable. worship. The younger Musard suc ceeded his father; but what a falling off! Next came Arban.

At in tervals the poor man went to,sleep.: standing up, till his nose struck the; desk, when the shock would wake him, then he would look around bewildered, as if asking himself, where he was and what he was doing there.
