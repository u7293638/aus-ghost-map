GHOSTS IN THE TbJIPLE. j The London correspondent of the Manr\<stcr Courier writes:â€” Chrtatmas is undoubtedly the ' time for ghosts, and very appropriately a ' strange story reaches me from one or tbe Inns of Court. A set of chambers had been vacant tor some time: indeed, thev find mdv ten . tenanted for three weeks during the - lost six years. The rent was remarkably . moderate, and tbe rooms were comfortable. ! Accordingly a young barrister took them for a month or so. He never inquired why it was that they had been so long empty, nor had he ! any idea that they were supposed to bebaumed. j He had not, however, been in possession many J days before he announced his aetrrmination lo ( quit the rooms, though be had spent a good I ceal of money in doing (hem up and j famishing tbem. His friends naturally I aeked' for an explanation, and he con- j toesed that he had eeen a ghost, or I ! rather a collection of ghosts, tor every night, ' he said, the door opened of its own accord and ; in walked three men and a women, dressed in , 1 last century costumes. They sat down at the : table, and commenced to talk end to drink. ! Eventually (he talk got louder and a violent j quarrel broke out. in the course of which the I . woman was stabbed. After this catastrophe ' ghosts disappeared. Such is the most recent j . ghost story.
