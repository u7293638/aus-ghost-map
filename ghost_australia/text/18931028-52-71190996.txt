The Congregational Union. Tho first of the New South Wale3 Congrega tional Union meetings took place on Monday in tho Pitt-street Church, Sydney, when Divine service was hold, followed by a united com munion. The Rev. Warlow Davies, M.A., con ducted the former part of tho service, and preached from Acta iv. 31, " And when they had prayed the place was shaken where they were assembled together, and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and they spake the word of God with boldness." After some introductory remarks tho preacher a3ked, "What then was the import of this phenomenon to those who witnessed it, and what message does it bear to us to-night ?" In answer to the latter part, he enlarged upon three loading thoughts-1. It teachos the sacredness of the Christian Assembly ; 2. the possibilities of prayer; and 3. the nearness and sufficiency of God-they were filled with the Holy Ghost. There was not a large congregation, but it represented largely the ministry and diaconate of the churches. The service of praise was led by the Point Piper road choir. After the administration of the Communion the benediction was pro nounced. The first business session was held on Tuesday, when the new chairman (the Eev. Oeo. Eayner) was introduced.
