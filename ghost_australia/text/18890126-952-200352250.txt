Night. By E. W. Lummis, in Longman's Magazine. 'When the sweet breath that fills The heart of Sunset o'er the west is roll'd And dissipates tho imperishable hills To haziness of gold : When Titan Night anew Heaves o'er the globe her starry-linked chain From lonely Sirius in tho Southern blue Hound to the frozen Wain : Then. tho vivacious air Isfill'd with sprites ; beneath its dusky stole Far spiicos through the opening homi shcre Flush.crimson with a soul. ?Magnificently .rise Anthems of constellations; near and far Awako and sleep tho sweot antiphonies That call from star to star. QBie comet-hair of idreams Flows in their rushing-by with emerald light : Tho faint air following fans our head, ' .lind seems As kisses of tho night. And he whose spirit giv,es Cotnnsiunion with them, pulses through the ichole Of Huaven in vaguest passioning, and lives The homc-lifo of the soul. He lives in -all ho views : His ghost with rapturous wings ascends ? the dim; ?The infinite of beauty doth infuse : The infinite in him. Till from Night's dusky shores The waves break backward,, when tho morn is gray ; ? And a now crimson o'er tho plain restores Tho darkness of the day.
