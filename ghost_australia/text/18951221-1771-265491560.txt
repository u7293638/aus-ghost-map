THE OLD YE&fi; Â£OT THE NEW. No pause, no rest, no visual line Between the years that come and go! For some too fast, for some too slow: Tims never stope to sleep or dine, But on and on with steady flight fle keeps, ontired, by day,-by night, And boys and girls, ere yet aware, Find threads of silver in the hair. Their love of quiet growing stronger; And haply, by these tokens know What kind friends told them long ago, That they are boys and girls no longer. Still on, as silent as a ghost 4 Seems but a score of days all told, Or but a month or two at meet. Since our last New Year's song we trolled. Aod lo.' that New Fear now is Old, "Old year, good-bye I old year good-bye!' ; For what it brought, for what it takes. We love it, and for loved one's sakes; Prize we its hours of happineo, NOT for its saared sorrows leu. Accspt our thanks, Old Tesr! for these And for all precious memories Of love, of grief, of toll, of pain, Whose oisHtry wal sot is vain,
