TO CORRESPONDENTS. We are obliged to MATTHEW MEASURE, and, poetically speaking; to WHIMSA; and although he (or they) will not appear in any other shape than as a ghost, or by proxy, in the for- warding of his or their communications, we shall not, on that account, cast him, or them, aside. We have to apologise for neglecting to announce our intention, in our last, relative to the "Ghost's" appearance, in the usual way:—Matthew Measure must attribute the oversight to the prevailing distemper, which makes a person feel and exclaim, "I care for nobody and nobody cares for me." Whimsa, we think, had better see a proof before publi- cation; for, although we may be very correct in our punctuation, the sense of the author may be very materially marred, by the mis- placement of a solitary comma, particularly in poetic strains; Matthew Measure must not think of us as of old women—for we can keep a secret; but if he will not honor us, we shall press him no further to visit us in propria persona, but send to press as much of his writing as he can conveniently forward to us through his proxy. Will M. M. oblige us by writing only on one side of his paper? An EMIGRANT'S communication is already in type, and will appear in our next.
