Ballad! ol Christmas GS-osts, Between the/ moonlight and the fire, In winter|eveniog3 long ago, What ghostfc I raised at your desire To make fcour leaping blood run slow 1 How old, hthv7 grave, how wise we grow I What Chs-iatian ghost can make us ohill, Save these ihat troop ia mournful row, Th9 ghosts w8 all can raise at will? The beasts jLftI1 talk in barn and byre On Christmas eve, old iegend3 know, As one by dae the years retire, We men |fau silent then, I trow, Such sights ha3 memory to show, Such voices from the distant thrill, Ah. me ! t&ey; come with Christmas snow, The ghosts we aii Can raise at will. Oh 1 childien 0f the village choir ! Your carols on the midnight throw 1 Oh; bright! acr06a the mist and mire, Ye radd hearthB of Christmas glow 1 Beat back th9 shades, beat down th9 woe, Renew fy'he strength of moral will ; Be welcome all to come or go, The gh<jat3 we all can raise at will. Friend, avrsum corda, soon or slow We pj.rt like guests who've joyed their fill;.'
