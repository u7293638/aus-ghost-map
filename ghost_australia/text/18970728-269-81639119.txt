Topez Waz, *a Portuguese historian, Tanned the flame of, imaginative romance by to tally unfounded statements concern : ing rich silver fields. All thje world, England included, searched for the group., jftat the archipelago was lost. And as time went Iby, its mem ory grew dim, and it was relegated into Hie misty realm of fiction. For two ceoituries it was lost as utterly as. if it was a dot only in a vast ocean,. and not a: large contin gent of mounthinous ffar-visiible is lands .

On the South coast Cap- tain Switzer, of the Mackay labor schooner Roderick Dhu, is said to have found a large deposit of first class coal, and up one of the rivers transecting the plain, the Silagia, large mundic lode exists.
