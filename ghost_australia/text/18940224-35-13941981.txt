I THE INTERCOLONIAL EIGHT. TO THE EDITOR OF THE HERALD. I Firemen an important aquatic event like the Intercolonial Eight-oar Race is to be engaged in by the representatives from the various colonies it is certainly a matter of great importance to New South Wales that she send the best crew available. For v years past Victoria, our great rival in these contests, has come off more than conqueror, poor New South Wales sang with all her magnificent facilities for developing first-class oarsmen, hopelessly beaten But last year told a different tale Meeting her rivals on equal terms, with a crew selected by competent judges (who, by the way, are the selection committee for this year), New South Wales simply left her rivals as though they were moored to Ryde Bridge, the race being practically over before the mile point was reached, and tins in the face of the dismal predictions of the " croakers " that New South Wales had not the "ghost of a show " Seeing, then, that the result of last year's race was so satisfactory to New South Wales, is it wise, unless it can he shown that some of the crew have deteriorated, or that better men have sprung up in the interim, to alter very materially the composition of the crew, and place in it men who have not shown any special qualification, or who are green and untried in Important races ? Your correspondent " Ex-Amateur " seems very much surprised that Lambert is not given a chance in the forthcoming eight Well, I think the reason is that the committee wish New South Wales to win again this year Perhaps Lambert is not so anxious to row as your correspondent would have us believe, and I think those that know him best would vote him as being at least unsuitable. For a man to row an oar well he needs almost daily practice This Lambert has not had his rowing being confined almost exclusively to wither boats, which develops a totally different style and renders a man unsuitable for rowing and our well Your correspondent "Amateur" wishes to remind the selection committee that the M R C is still in existence, and wanders why Stayner and M'Donald are not included in the present selection. Well, I suppose it is because the "red and white" has acted as whipper-in on so many occasions lately The feeble show they made at the Riverview eight, at Balmain on the 9th November, and at fast Anniversary Regatta, cannot I think, recommend them very favourably to the notice of the selection committee and may account for the absence of the names of Stayner, M'Donald, and M'Gill, who filled important positions in the boat on these occasions, front the catalogue of names selected to practise as I am. for. all N.S.W.
