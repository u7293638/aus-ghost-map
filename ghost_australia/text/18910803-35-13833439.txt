AMUSEMENTS. THE PROFLIGATE. Mr. Chas Cartwright and Miss Olga Nethersole have given special importance to the season they opened so auspiciously on Saturday at the Garrick Theatre by the introduction to Sydney play goers of so good a piece 113 ' The Profligate " We must decline to call Mr A W Pinero s now drama " a noble play," since to deserve the epithet thus applied to it by a leading London journal 11 simpler and less stilled treatment would become necessary The dialogue is too generally suffused with sentiment, and the chief characters, who prose and ottituduuso at every turn, Too frequently miss the honest way of human nature to allow of the club sificition of ' The Profligate " as a great artistic work Had it been so, indeed, the cordiality of the reception accorded it by pit and gallery on a thursday night would have been a little loss demonstrative than it was The piece is, in fact, theatrically effective 0, and when this has been stated, it may be conceded that it is an exceedingly well-written and stimulating comedy-drama Urged on by the v vociferous applause and unstinted approval of the delighted audience which filled the Garrick Theatre on Saturday, the principals acted from the first at high pressure How far a little more restraint anÃ¡jiiics>r might have 0 gone in giving weight and balance to the costing Men of the joy and p those of human Ino rail car by the author, it would be difficult to say Mr Cartwright is so careful in the study and stage direction of the pieces placed in his hands, however that Saturday 's to wing may have been deliberately adopted by of 11 as Mr Pinero's characters rev cal chemist Ps 141 the light of this interpretation, one-half of them see life through a rainbow all rose colour, and the other half through a cloud that makes everything sombre and gray Thus one and all are continuously in extremes, and the atmosphere of the drama becomes afflicted Apart from the question of the truth of this view, however and the drama is so deeply interesting that it excites discussion and tempts analytical criticism "the Profligate" succeeds in enforcing a moral lesson quite foreign to the stage, 03 illustrated by its great dramatists of generations past On this ground it has special value and even originality The modern stage cannot fail to profit in contact with a great thinker, and without comparing their methods in any way, for they are wholly dissimilar, it is easy to trace the influence of Ibsen 111 Mr Pinero's new drama We refer not to such 11 detail as the heroine's allusion to the " miracle" (Nora's "miracle" of moral metamorphosis) which may reconcile her to her loving husband hut to the whole moral tendency of the play The North ogian poet was we echo of, the first dramatist who pointed the moral that the so-called " gay yellow," the approved Lovelace, of our own md bygone days, does 111 fact, poison the family life and work injury to the state of been enforces the lesson of Puritanical sternness in " Ghosts," and he takes again a high view of women's place in society is something more than a pretty babbling brook fur 111111 to pollute, 111 a " Doll's House." Without thee plays the moral teaching of "The Profligate" might have been less directly apparent Mr Pinero's drama may not 00 a strong work of art like " Ghosts " but neither is it so unpleasant In "the Prong to the author touches the same subject, not with grim and savage satire, but with infinite tact, with tender pathos, and with theatrical effective cross the outcome of such treatment is that 1 painful theme is set forth with a delicacy that never offends, and time " The Profligate," whilst still remaining a thoroughly good-day becomes 111 once a popular success Uns was what it proved 011 Satin day night. The actors were called and recalled again and again, and when, at tho close of the third act, where Miss Nethersole had played with great power, her mental exaltation rendered her too dazed to acknowledge the cheers of the house and the gifts of flowers that Mr Cartwright endeavoured to force into her hands when the audience at this point witnessed this play within a play, they were not satisfied until the popular actress, after a long delay, at last came forward to acknowledge the applause so liberally bestowed The whole tone of the reception was thus such as to point to 11 successful run for the new piece This is as it should be, tor 'The Profligate" is far above the ordinary class of drama, and moreover, incident ally fights in a good cause The scenery is the best Mr W J Wilson has given us in particuLar, both the painting and the stage- arrangement of the principal secure unusually effective Here the scene disclosed the doings or balconied terrace, of the Villa Cohabiano, near Florence of full 1 pleasant place for breakfast or afternoon tea, this open, sun-lit girl lery, with its garden now through lofty, graceful arches at the back, the spreading landscape is shown with its vineyards and viaducts, and the distant hills behind rise abruptly in the dazzling light It is in this scene that the action requires music Mr Percy Shannon, tho w well know n tenor, had been engaged, and unseen, was hear d 111 the charming and thoroughly It than music of a song which main must have 0 recognised as an "Av of Mine" by Luigi Goidigiam- the Italian Schubert," as he has been called Herein the composer has adapted a 1 escape melody 01 passionate sentiment incongruously allied in our Cathedral bel - vices to the English words, "O, come hither and he Liken, y o that fear God " Mr. Shannon sung the air very prettily in Italian, and gained a hearty recall at the close of the act The singer may notice that the music is plentifully besprinkled 111 the later editions of it with the significant mark "r ill " which, duly attended to, will serve to eliminate the too rollicking sentiment with which the tenor at present 111 vests the jo}Ousmolod} Mr Shannon, who, if we read them aright, possesses a tuneful shake might with ad vantage exercise hisfnciht} in that direction by thus adorning the penultimate note of the closing pin JO We cannot do better in narrating the story of the new play than by quo! in the lines which the author had placed upon the programmes distributed on the night of the first production at the new 1} opened Garrick Theatre, on April 21, IS'iJ The verse, which strikes the key note of the drama is as follow s - It is a good and toothache saw, Half roasted never will be raw No doubt is dried once in are to meal, two creek now slopes by the wIiloI , You can t turn comes to mill again, Norlsow by a mine back to Then , And having just ed stolen money You can t Imv mnocuicD for mercy Dunstan Bonshaw is the man who, enthralled for the first time by the love of a high-souled woman, would gladly cast away a fortune to purchase the 111 notice he has lost The curtain rises upon the study of Hugh Murray, a successful young lady or with a high ideal of what the code of honour amongst men should be I o%im enters the battered, elderly rake, Lord Dangers, a devotee, who needs legal advice, and gets, over and above that, a homily upon marriage, which the chivalrous young lawyer refuses to regard as " the tomb of the P. ist so far as the man is concerned " On the contrary, he thinks that I)} marriage a man of this character " wrongs the woman and fools himself " Such a one is Lord Dangers now seeking matrimony once more, and such a one also is Dunstan Renshaw, who is to be married that very morning The bride is Leslie Brudenell, a schoolgirl set in her teens, and the ward of Murray's hard headed old partner, Mr Cheal Murray has himself met Leslie, and has fallen deeply in love with her in the theatrical fashion V Inch is, in our opinion, an artistic blemish on the drama, Murray in a stage w Jasper describes to the utterly cynical and uninterested poor how he first met the sweet girl, and how she is one of those women, in her purity and grace, who resemble sacred pictures, so that men can only a paper before them Murray's bitter-sweet reflec- tions are broken abruptly by the noisy entrance of Dunstan, a fast, cheery, good-looking-man-about town 01 some seven or eight and thirty years of age He gives a lively account of the farewell to his bachelor life of the previous night, when his latchkey was solemnly destroyed, and schoolboy festivities were kept up with his companions until 7 a m of that very morning.

Ills assumed name was Lawrence Kemble the initials of his real name "D It She wishes Murray to find him, and thinks the task not too difficult "He is not a murderer, skulking along in the shadow of a wall," who erica, with great emotion, he is only a betrayer of women, and men don't hide for that" She sketches the face of her lover, and Murray, aghast, recognises the lineaments of Dunstan Renshaw Janet departs, Murray finds opportunity upon the return of the w wedding party to warn the pro- fligate that, though he thinks he has sown his wild oats, the small of the mildewed gram will yet prove rank 111 his nostrils and the curtain falls as he bids fare ell to Leslie with the touching words, ' God bless you, little school-girl, always '" The second act opens with some delightful comedy scones at the villa in " fair rivers," where Losho and her husband are spending their honeymoon It is apparent that Dunstan is passionately devoted to his sweet young wife of that he bitterly regrets the past, and dreads any revelation which might destroy Leslie's faith in his honour and integrity At the villa Losho receives her first visitors the vulgar, worldly natured Mrs Stoneham, and her daughter Irene Leslie evidently wears her heart upon her sleeve 0 for daw s to dock at " She describes her happiness to the doubtless much-loved Mis Stoneha}-and again the want of womanly reticence is untrue to human nature 'This" is a "poor weak word" to describe her love for her husband ; he on his part ' ' lowers his voice late one Speak ing into some rare shell that he fears to bro it with too much sound," to , Ac to quote from memory a passage marked by poetical fancy Leslie admits that she has frequently to seclude herself in order to shed tears of gratitude for such happiness, and conjectures that a woman's heart is more easily broken by I excess ofjuudaesa than by cruelty. When the tea At comes in, Losho, with a great air, flourishes a thimbleful in her knight's face, and calls it his " stirrup-cup " Miss Nethersole did tins with a charming gesture on Saturday, but it was impossible to avoid the reflection that such a wife playing off those girlish CQstacics in the presence of a miscellaneous company, would irritate to the verge of distraction a man of Diinstm's education and experience However, there was nothing impossible in all this, and the dialogue between Leslie and Irene, in lynch the former expresses her disgust at the approaching marriage of the latter with Lord Dangers, furnishes a strong scone Losho refuses to believe that the only difference between Dangers and other men is that his story is public property whilst they contrive to keep theirs to themselves and expresses her faith in bor Dunstan's unblemished purity Dio net closes with the arrival of Janet Preece Sent on by the cruelty of Mrs bronchial), whose companion she is, to tramp the mountain road in the burning sun, she is brought back to the villa in an exhausted condition, and is at once admitted by the good-hearted Leslie during her husband's absence in the neighbouring capital off urs thereafter necessarily reach a climax, and the third act is full of stirring situations Janet, nursed and tended for a week by Leslie and her brother Wilfred, has become beloved by the latter, whom she refuses owing to the story of her past life Losho tenderly invites a confidence, and in a strongly dramatic scene Janet kneels at her feet, " because it is her place for evermore" when good women are present, because she is, " no more than a clod of earth " to be trampled under foot, because "she has been tempted, and has not been strong " We may here pause to obser \ o that Janet was a woman if he had retrieved her on or, that she knew herself to be more sinned against than sinning and that it is difficult to believe that she would have given way to a self abasement mci abandon of speech which would only sound natural from the mouth of a Storey Merrick However, the scene has dramatic value, and Leslie's answer-" You have entered into my life, and your weakness and your loneliness make it my duty to protect youths noble Attlusensis sounds are heard in the garden below, Janet recognises the voice of the seducer (whose name she does not know), and when she points to the two men entering the house Leslie quite naturally concludes that she refers not to her own husband but to Lord Dangers There is a most stimulating somewhat Leslie, perhaps rather cruelly, points to poor Janet as an awful example of his depravity, and refuses to allow Lord Dangers to enter the house That elderly beau at once denies all know ledge of the girl and when every eye falls upon Dunstan his guilt is so apparent that polite society, as represented by Mrs Stoneham and her friends, indulges in a very unseemly) stumped lil anticipation of the stand in which must inevitably follow, There is a thrilling scene how can guilt; hush md and outraged v life, and as the latter bids him with indignant scorn, "Go"' and falls senseless to the ground the act terminates The fourth act shows the reconciliation between husband and wife, after Dunstan has rejected the relief by suicide by which he at first intended to end his suffering by a long soliloquy (finely spoken by Mr Cartwright), which is distinctly) melodramatic in its effect, Dunstan has declared that " night and day he sees nothing but her face before him night and day he hears nothing but her v once he cannot sleep at night " and finally, over-wrought by illness and on citement, he falls prostrate Then Leslie, who has been spending a week with her brother in Murray 's bachelor quarters, where this scene takes place, enters the room, and the curtain comes down as she clasps her repentant husband in her arms This happy end- ing was adopted by the author in preference to his original scheme, by) which Dunstan committed suicide, and is said to make the drama more popular with playgoers there can be little doubt that the first v version lies the greater dramatic claim upon the consideration of the thoughtful Mr Cartw light had organised a very efficient company for the representation of the drama, and the performance as a whole was excellent On Saturday the stars were a little over-excited by the warmth of their reception, and pardonably so, with the result that the rendering was a little too strong Doubtless it will be toned down considerably this evening in which case to a distinct popular triumph will be added the artistic success which was so marked in the case of " the letter " This remark applies especially, to Miss Nethersole, who, in the first two acts, gave way to the temptation incidental to a character which the author has made so exuberant!) and gushing youthful, by playing her Leslie Lrudcnell with too much obedience Even so, the impersonation was full of charm and girlish grace the youthful entire basin of the character itself makes the task of the critic doubt) delicate, and it is possible that few indeed of those present on Saturday last aught but the personal fascination of the actress Miss Nethersole s manner at the close of the second act where Le die addresses the moody ) young lawyer with the v words "Is it very unbusiness-like to give ) on a flower, too 9" was altogether winning and there w Ci e plan. similar touches for old playgoer l s to admire The scene with Irene (Miss Mary Kingsley), owing to the exuberance of the ensemble, could not hold proving a little too demonstrative but in the great situation with Dunst iii, Miss Nethersole acted as she has never done before, with constantly using power and an o pression of poignant anguish, so that finally the reiterated " Den) it " thrilled the house Mr Charles Cartwright, very well made-up ns Dunstan Renshaw, adopted just the graceful, effusive manner which was needed to justify Janet Preece's description of the character to Murray-" A man of ) our ago, but with a boy's voice when speak- ing to Women " The remorseful awakening of the conti dance was finch suggested, and the despairing cry,' Have more) upon me," and the power with which the list soliloquy was declaimed gave added value to an impressive impersonation. Mr. Laurence Cautley, though he caused one stage waif, was well up in his new part as Hugh Murray. His earnestness rendered the character possible, and thus avoided the air of priggishness which might have attached to it. The emotion of the last scene, in whi.ch Murray declares his love for Leslie, was touchingly shown by the actor. Mr. Frank Cates, well dressed and well made-up, played with devil-may-care urbanity as Lord Dangars, and Mr. Harold Russell gave value to a small part as Mr. Cheal. Mr J Cosgrove o is a young actor, who has made immense strides in his profession since he was last seen here with the Rignold Dramatic Company If he was inclined to everyday Inn part of Wilfrid Brudenell excuse must be pleaded that ov card-playing was all the fashion on Saturday and it is a good fault he spoke his lines in the love scenes with undeniable propriety and feeling Miss NoU o Lyons has not been seen here since she appeared in " ihoMiddlemin " Her Janet Preece was charac- tensed by a clinging softness and te irful sympathy well in keeping with the character Miss Jenny Watt- Tanner finds quite a hit by the stately aplomb and well-bred v elegantly sho displayed as that course natured aristocrat Airs Stonchny there was a largeness of manner in the "How dare) out with' which she turned upon Leslie Brudenell, where the latter had denounced Lard Dangers as an improper match for the angry worth's daughter, which was irresistibly) comic Miss Mary Kingsley, an elegant stage figure, licked sympathy as Irene, though her experience enabled her to make her reading acceptable with the audience Miss Constance Edwards, a young lady well known in social circles hero made her debut in Sydney as Priscilla This nice little part for a beginner enabled the actress to show Cherbourg and vivacity) in a soul otto rule, and when she picked up the bouquet thrown at her feet she received a very encouraging round of applause Mr A G Poulton's comic humour caused laughter in the part of the servant Weaver " The Profligate " will be repeated until further notice.
