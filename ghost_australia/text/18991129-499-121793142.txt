OUR AMERICAN LETTER (CONTINUED FROM PAGE 1.) ? 1 ever since I loft San Francisco, In tho early part of the month. I have witnessed some fnlrly interesting pugilistic contests since I havo been in New York. While en routo I received nows by wlro that George Lavlgne, the former light-weight cham pion of tho world, had been knocked out by Kid. M'Fadden, on October C. The evont took placo at tho Broadway Club, and lasted nineteen rounds. It was a fierce en counter, Lavigno being knocked down no less than six times in the concluding round. This means that J-avlgne has reached the and of his tether as a fichter. He was badly bruised nnd very much discouraged as tho result of his go with M'Fadden. He was in bed for several days at New Dorp. Tho defeat played havoc with all his good resolutions, evidently, for a few evenings ago I saw him sitting in a bibulous condi tion In an up-town cafe, with a freshly opened pint of wine, blowing off steam on a table at his elbow. ENGLISH BOXERS IN AMERICA. ' There has been qulto an influx of English fighters within tho past six months, and so far they havo experienced tho worst of luck. Coffeo Cooler Craig and Bobby Dobba, the colored pugilists, who Imbibed English notions during a short stay in the old country, and practically fought under tho British flag when they returned here, were both defeated. Then there was Jeff. Thorne, who went down before Kid M'Coy. Other British pugs who suffered reverses wore Pedlar Palmei- and Benny Jordan, the first-mentioned succumbing to all conquer ing Terry M'Govern, and the last-named being knocked out by Eddie Sontry. There are other English lads in train ing with Jeffries at Ailenhurst. One of theso is Will Curley, from Newcastle-on-Tyne. He Is to box George Dlxon on tho night preceding tho battle of the heavy-weights. Dave Wallace, of London, who is to go against Joo Bernstein. in the near future, is also there. There was anothor lad named Harry Ware, who was supposed to be mat ched with Young Hopkins, ot Chicago, but Ware became homesick' and skedaddled back to England a day or two ago. Ben Jordan lasted 1G rounds with Santry. They fought at the Lenox Athletic Club, on tho night of October 10. The result simply goes to show how hard it is to weigh the chances in fistic contests. Jordan, during his former visit, defeated Georgo Dixon. Dixon subsequently made a holy show of Santry, and now Sautry has settled Jor dan's hash. Jordan was a rod-hot favorite at 2 to 1 and 100 to 40 before the start. All the smart people in tho box seats had their money down on him. In the opening round it looked as If the right selection had been made, but in tho second round things be gan to go awry for the British boy. He was knocked down two or three times, and even money betting was inaugurated with a rush. Santry swung his right in a business-like way, and it was this particular hand that caused trouble for Jordan. Under advice from his corner, Jordan boxed cleverly for a while, relying on long range jabs with his left. As-long as ho maintained this systom of fighting ho had all tho best ot it; Ho left marks ot his prowess on the American lad's face, and tho Jordan backers took heart, and offered odds onco more. Jor dan became very tired as tho. fight pro gressed. He thought ho might bo ablo to bring matters to a head by letting, go his right. Ho made somo bungling attempts, and in tho 16th round, beforo he could re cover his balance,' after attempting a right cross, Santry rushed him and caught him fairly on. the chin with the right. It was a peculiar finish, Inasmuch as Jordan. went to sleep while resting. In his opponent's arms. This came about through a clinch resulting instantly tho knock-out punch was' dellvorcd; ' Just as soon 'as Santry re laxed his hold, Jordan slipped to the' floor as limp as a rag. CHOYNSKI AND JIM RYAN. There was an uneven contest at Broud way .on the night bf-October 20. ? The prin cipals wero Joo Choynski and ? Australian1 Jimmy Ryan. Ryan wns no match for his man' In : any ono singlb respect. Ho : was shorter of reach and stature, and he had ?that well- nourished appearance ..which be .tokened lack of training.' Tho thing looked like a flutter between a big rangy hawk, and a' littlo plump partridge. Choynski, as' usual, was in good fettle, standing over Ryan, as ho did, it was no trouble to him- to Impair Ryan's already Impaired vision .with ''left - down-chaps. Ryan didn't have a ghost of. a 'show; from tho outset, and ho becamo' an ;oasy mark for Choynskl's punishing right-handers in. tho seventh round. Sports around here are beginning to wonder when Chbynskl will pluck up couraEO enough to tako on a moderately good man. Night beforo last Gus. Ruhlln, the Ohio heavy-weight, went against Tom Jeffords, of California. Jeffords was the man who; according to Peter. Jackson, took advan tage ot the latter's helplessness while in toxicated,. and added a victory to a rather attenuated record. Jeffords, has been swel ling himself on -this dubious, performance, and also on an alleged decision gained over Champion Jeffrie!) in tho latter's prentice days. Jbffords camo East with qulto a blare of trumpets, but now. his namo is nevpr. men tioned. Ho lasted five, rounds with Ruhlin, and roceived a severe drubbing. Ruhlin made a remarkably wretched showing, and got very Iltlp credit for his victory. Most of tho spectators were of the opinion that Poler Manor could have finished Jeffords in ten seconds; A contest that had been looked forward to with considerable anticipation, has fal len through. Frank Erne; who was' regar- ded as Lavlgne's successor in the matter of the World's Light-weight Championship, was to havo mot Jack O'Brien, at the Coney Island Athletic Club; last night. Within a day or two of the fight, Erne was taken ill with bronchitis.. Ho cancelled the en gagement, aud , allowed O'Brien to tako down 250dol., posted as appearancq money. O'Brien. la regarded by all as tho coming champion of his class. Ho certainly looks the ideal fighter from top to, toe. Ho has fairly walked over everything they_ have sent him against, his most important.vic tory being that over Tim Kerna. ,-Tho', lat- ter, prior to meeting O'Brien, had seven teen straight decisions to his credit. O'BRIEN AS A FIGHTER. A. Bettinson, of tho National Club of London, saw O'Brien in action recently, while in this country with Palmer. Bot tlnson thinks O'Brien tho greatcstifishter of his inches that he has ever come across. Speaking of Palmer reminds mo that ho is confident that Teddy M'Govern is to face Georgo Dixon for the Feather-weight Championship of tho World In January. When that event takes placo the sport pat rons of this city will see 'a fiuht as is a fight.' Dixon is a wonderful piece of human architecture, ' and seeing him skipping around the gymnasium at New Dorpl'.wlth kids, on whoso faces there is still tho bloom of youth, it Is difficult to conceive that he is tho same dapper browu boy who whipped Cal. M'Carthy so handily ten years ago. And what a record ho has rolled up sinco then? Champions may come, and-, cham- pions may go, but If fistic history gives every man his due, Dixon will be remem bered as tho greatest fighter tho nineteenth century saw. . ? Peter Maher and Kid M'Coy havo ;beon matched to box on November 30, uoxL They will meet at the Coney Island Athletic Club, for a purso of 20,000dol. ?. M'Coy re-^ cently claimed the middle-weight cham pionship ot the world. In doing so, ho instanced how he had challenged Fltzslm mons to fight for tho title, and had placed a forfeit in responsible hands to .substan tiate his challenge. Fitzsimmons gave as his' reason for Ig noring M'Coy that ho had in prospect a match with tho winner of- tho Jeffries-' Sharkey fight. As already stated, Fitz slmmons' chances of having another try for the championship will bo fairly good' If Sharkey wins from Jeffries. If tho last named comes out on top. It Is dollars to doughnuts that the next big fight will be between Jeffries and Corbett. Meanwhile, Fitzsiramons Is keeping his hand In. He is to tgx Joff Thorno six' rounds In Chicago on Saturday night. Tho affair will take place while this letter Is In transit to San Francisco. Corbott Is also inclined to engage In a littlo preliminary sparring. Ho told mo at tho RuhllnJef fords fight tho other night that he expec ted to box Ruhlln six rounds shortly In Chicago. Assuredly, tbeao aio,,the boom days ol pugilism. NEW YORK, October 27, 180». It is just as well, perhaps, that the championship fight, is postponed — that is, looking at it from a gate receipts stand point. For a long time the .big pugilistic event was completely overshadowed by tho International Yacht Race for tho America Cup, ,.- . ? . ' The whole world, of course, knows now how, the yacht race dragged. Beginning, as tho series of events did, on October 3, with a scheme, for continuing on alternate days, tho question , of superiority between -the 'Columbia and ! Shamrock should have been decided by October 7; But old Jupi ter. Pluvius did. hot stand in. Thero was a dearth of :wihd day after day, and what should havo occupied five days required nearly threo weeks. V ' When I left San Francisco on October 2 it looked as if I might, by a stroke of good luck, reach New .York in. time :to witness tho concluding race of the series. , As ; it happened, I was on hand for tho whole business. I werit.out- day atterdayon the fast steam yacht Buccaneer with .the New York 'Journal's' staff of reporters and ar tists, and returned; time and again, dis appointed. '' '?';:??? ' ?'!' . ','? ' '? ' . . On somo days' there was such a lack of wind and such a wealth of haze that the racing machines did not stir from their moorings. On such occasions, with the balance of the excursion fleet, we steamed Inside Sandy ? Hook, circled around ' tho green yacht and the white yacht as they lay at anchor,- listened to tho seronadlng bands playing the ''Star Spangled Banner' and the '^Wearing of tho Green,' and heard tho sounds of' revelry by day that floated out from' the cabin of tho big yacht Erin, where Sir Thomas LIpton entertained hun dreds of guests and earned the reputation; ot a jolly good fellow. THE AMERICA CUP RACE. So far as a spectacle was concerned, tho: America Cup Race was considerable of a fizzle. ' On tho opening day- the Atlantic Ocean off Sandy Hook was alive with, craft of all descriptions. :.:. On the next racing' day, the. flotilla was smaller. ?? On the third day many of thoso who had chartered ex Qurslon steamers and fltlcd up floating bars and restaurants acknowledged that they ' had gono broke: It was very sad tho whole of it, and when the wliicl finally did como out of tho clouds nnd .givo tho yachts a chanco- to de cide which was which, tho surrounding ocean was bare of everything almost, ex cepting committee boats and newspaper tugs. As ' to -.tho race. 'When on October 3, tho Columbia led for many miles, but was overhauled by, the Shamrock.. Lho -wind be coming1 light and captious, tho YanKs be gan to fear for tho safety of tho Cup, Tho raco was called, off, as the; boats diJ not finish within tho lime limit. On the second trlalj'agaln'tho Shamrock crept Up, the : wind towards the; end being light and autty 'as oh the first' occasion. This al'O was no race, tho Shamrock, as before,' being atrlfie In the lead -r/hen the officials signal /'Time's up' was hoisted. Now tho American yachting experts were1 in! .despair. Beforo thero had boon any trial at ;all. they, seemed to have made up. their minds that the Shamroclt would only prove a dangerous- foe in' a. heavy breqzo.' Now it was nil the other way. They tliouEht her lonn suit would ' be weather-' of the zephyr variety. Tho Sham rock peoplo . evidently began to- think so too.. They 'discarded' ballast, as one writer soldi 'in order to make- her travel at a breath.'' But the scare was all for noth ing. Directly there was a brcezo strong enough and steady enough to allow ; the yachts to cover, the courso within the time limit, tho American boat was wafted homo over, ten minutes ahead, in. a course of fit tteen miles to windward and return. On the following day there was a littlo more' wind' still and sea enough to give 'a test of tho ^strength of construction of both' yachts.' This was tho 'kind- of tost for which'speclal '.'provision'' had been made at the request of tho challengers. They .wanted, 'as one of the conditions ot the race, an understanding' that In case either yacht was disabled the other should con tinue over the courso alone. It wns a! triangular course this time— tori miles to a lc-g. They went away together like one boat. It: was a pretty and in spirltlng sight for about throe miles. The Columbia had the windward position; but there seemed to bo littlo to choose be tween them. It began to look— and, indeed, It did look — as if the Columbia was1 creeping away, when suddenly down tumbled; the Sham rock's dub topsail; '? Tho:;; topmast '?'; bad snapped in twain. It was owing; to a; wire stay parting near the dock, arid the whole strain of tho extra big sail 'falling on the spar. - ? The Shamrock lurried on her heel and mado'for homo. The Columbia. went over tho course, finished within1 tho tlmo limit, and had a second raco placed to her credit. ' THE THIRD TEST. Then.icamO' tho third, tost.;, Thov Sham rock's champions went' back to first prin ciples. They said give us wind and plenty of it. i Tho discardedballast^was/nut'back into the yacht, and more; to: boot— 33001b more, they say. Tho: green .:. boat , was docked to have a new topmast put in, and her shrouds keyed; up and : strengthened; Then everyone interested in her prayed for a smashing . breeze. It came. It was' tho 'first' course over again this time — fifteen miles to windward and return, and the Columbia outfooted her at every stago of tho raco. The Yankee boat was only 17sec ahead at the stake, but sho Increased her lead wonderfully, on the return trip. She was a mile, to; tho good crossing', tho ? finish,' when tho' 'Shamrock 'cams 'tumbling in six minutes later. Sir Thomas Upton proved himself 'a dead game sport.' He immediately hoist ed tho Stars and Stripes above; the Union Jack. on tho steam yacht Erin, and ho led all the '. choerlus for tho Columbia. He said ho had no excuso to offer— that !the Yankee boat had proved .herself, the su perior of the Shamrock In all kinds of go ing. He visited Iselin, tho managing owner of the Columbia, aud It is said that they embraced. 'Certain of tho citizens of Now York will present the great 'Tea King' with' a 'loving cup (rather suggestive, by the' wny), aud Sir, Tommywill carry hack with, him to England -tho' good wishes of all ho camo in contact with on this side. A London paper, working In unison with ono published, in Now York, endeavored to arrange a second scries of laces.
