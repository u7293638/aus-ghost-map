SUNDAYS IN LONDON. ALLEN-The IRVINGITES. The singular body commonly called Irvington ob feet I am told, to this name. Indeed, I subjected myself to a grave rebuke from an elderly gentleman of whom is the porchway of the edifice in Gordon square' off the Euston road, I innocently inquired, is this the living to Church r" Ho cast mine in the silent reproof of a sorrowful face, as he replied. " Sir, this is the catholic and apostolic church " As a matter of fact it came to the same thing, and since you cannot very conveniently rofortotho worshippers at this place as the catholic and apostolic Churches," I will ask permission to continue the use of the term by which they have been always known. And the worthy Jivingites gave me a good deal of trouble My own ignorance Was the primary cause of, mci, in addition came the ignorance of many friends and acquaintances from whom I bought .¡nowW"0 to guide my footsteps in warning match is for this" particular Sunday in London. They had all heard somebody say that somebody) had told some body something about the Irvingites, but as to what they were and how to get at them they know nothing whatever. Hut the i burch looked like a public JM stitution, and to it I decided to go for the evening service. There were vessels of holy water at the entrance and the way led through a dark but beautifully arched and pillared cloister, the atmosphere of which was heavy with incense, which I afterwards found had been lingering about the building since the morning service The church was dimly lighted and the tall fluted columns and fine groined roof were doubly imposing darkened by the shadows. the chancel, evidently wide and (loop, was altogether in gloom There were perhaps 50 individuals scattered about the wilderness of solid oak beaches. It may readily be imagined that the deserted aspect of an edifice so architecturally rich struck one with that unpleasant sense of dull which so often resists all efforts to shake it 'off. The gas, London he, was execrable, and for some good reason, no doubt, several of the humors had not been lighted. Bj and- no two gentlemen in white surplices, with brohad crimson sashes across the shoulder, walked out of the shadows vestibule into the hav of One of them, a good looking young man, of placid men and military moustache, seconded the marble pulpit, and his companion filed off into an enclosure on the floor. 'The occupant of the pulpit began the service by reading one or two prayers, similar to those in the Church of England Common Prayer. He read an epistle and gospel, and a couple of hymns were sung the minister did his work without any pretence of intonation, and with a deliberate manner and speech not without effect In a little while I had arrived at the correct conclusion that the evening service was not hold in high esteem by the body, and that it was intended merely to afford an opportunity for a sermon In this respect I was undergoing an experience similar to that I described in my visit to Rituahbtio St. Alban's. During the following week I purchased "the Liturgy and other Divine offices of the Church," in the hope of learning somewhat of the prayers, he said liturgy is, however, one of the most involved treatises of the kind extant, and I can easily understand a statement I once read that the Ministers themselves are sometimes lost in its labyrinths. All I can say, therefore, of this evening service is that it was very correct and under trial, and that the prayers, he runs, and exhortations were such as might be used, without offence, in any Protestant denomination, The chief point of interest to me was the sermon. I had not forgotten that the Irvingites claim the gift of prophecy, and that their apostles, prophets, and angels were supposed to have received special gifts through the laying on of hands by which they are admitted to the holy priesthood. The lay it on of hands by an apostle who exercises high spiritual flowers is, according to the teaching of the church, an anointing with the Holy Ghost, and "dealings" in the spirit of the reference to the hundred and forty four thousand in the Revelation. Lagoilj I hoped that the good-looking young minister would enlighten us upon some of these mysterious articles of faith But no did not. He chose as his text averse referring to harvest, and proceeded to deliver a common- place disquisition upon the value of a good harvest, and the disastrous rams over which the English farmers were at that time distressing themselves, 'the oddest theory he propounded was that fowls are continually employed in the Scriptures as tA typical of evil spirits Why was he so hard upon the humble rooster ? 'This he did not make clear, and of the three examples he gave one was, if not a positive distortion of Holy Writ, certainly in opposite But the few In seemed to be a passing temptation not to be resisted, and not a bona-fide portion of the sermon The preacher hit out A very straight at the Church of Rome, and all other churches which by elaborate ceremonial put the " Lamb of God " into the background. It was in this way. borrowed no doubt from the Liturgy, that he always referred to the Saviour of men, and it must be understood that the Divinity of Jesus is one of the points upon which the Irv Kingites are strongly orthodox, 'the service did not last quite an hour, and it was throughout to me at any rate, very cold and formal. On leaving the church I read in announcement that the Holy Eucharist would he celebrated next morning at 11 o'clock. This service was held in on exquisite little chapel, and though, here again, I failed in attending a full ceremonial, there was more life and less- than on the previous evening, The conga gun on numbered 18, the celebrants two and thirty. By this time I had gathered a little information, and it saved mefiomlewildcrmenU Sitting each in a special niche and scour trod from their fellows by elegant little pillars of polished granite, were thirteen fine looking men wearing a black robe which touched the ground a half length white surplice richly fringed with honiton lace, and over all a small violettippit. Those men were " angels' representing the seven churches of London. The other celebrants wore white half length surplices without embroidery, and black tippets, and they were priests who officiat- ing minister, the angel of the Gordon square Church, was vested in gorgeous garments of satin and gold, and he knelt at the altar with his back to the congregation and a pull, intoned the service, which is a form offerings embodying I am told, features from the Romish Creek, and 1 English Churches 'solitary seemed to be copied from the Common- Prayer, but there was an added invocation for " apostles, prophet, evangelists pastors, and teachers " The wine and brohad were blessed by the priest and the angels, advancing, knelt in line to receive the snibioniB from the officiating priest and his totally, gorgeous assistant When the angels named, the black tipped guests took their place, and after them came the handful of women and men coin po ing the, congi eg iron 'they returned from com municating with arms folded and eyes downe ist It was in truth a solemn and coffee service, and the uttiKinco of the response by so many men speaking in with one sonorous voice was paid in effect On the following Sunday morning an opportunity cure of witnessing a final celebration The Imngites hold, amongst other Lo loss, that it is their duty to spend the first and last holes of the day in prayer, and they regulate the prices to fit in with it. The wind service began at 10 o'clock, and there was, between 14 and half past., 12 o'clock, a grand cele oration of the Holy Eucharist with the accompaniment of splendid Ringing, a profusion of incense altar lights, andacrowdofsurplicedangolB.pno ts, and deacons.
