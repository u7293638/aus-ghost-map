THE WHEAL TALLANGATTA MIN ING COMPANY. A meeting of investors in the Wheal Tallangatta Tin Sluicing and Mining Company, Upper Murray, was held last evening at Bart- letts Railway Hotel, 1 Elizabeth street Mr. J W Beilby, who had convened the meeting, was called to the chair. The Chairman stated that he had called the meeting in consequence of the dissatisfaction he felt, in common with others, at being persuaded to invest his money in the Wheal Tallangatta by a prospectus which informed investors that the claim yielded ore which contained 73 per cent of tin. The question was whether any steps should be taken to obtain restitution of the money they had put into the concern, and if that could not be done at any rate the swindle should be exposed I he stuff which had latterly come down yielded only from two to five per cent Mr Lind said that on the strength of the prospectus the thing was nothing else but a swindle It must have been misrepresented from the first. When he went to pay his calls at the office of the legal manager, he was told that this was being got in sufficient quantity to pay expenses It was further said that the calls were coming in well, when the fact was otherwise Within a week or two from that they found the manager advising the directors to leave off working the ground It seemed to him to have been a case of " salting ' Mr G B B Elliott, the legal manager for the company, and the promoter, acknowledged that it was natural shareholders should think there had been swindling some- where His idea was that Mr Rosales, whose report appeared in the prospectus, had been had The ground as far as he could see was "patchy to show his (Mr Elliotts) bona fides in the matter, he might mention that he and his family had held 11 616 shares The directors too, who had with him believed that they had got a good thing, held 8,000 shares Mr Luke said that but for representations made to him by Mr Norton, the late mining manager, he should have disposed of his shares The CHAim in Mr Norton holds yet that it is a good claim Mr Lind-'Well, he would have to persuade mc a long time to hold them, if I could only get rid of manslaughter ) Mr Nom w, who was called into the room, denied statements afloat that he had covered lodes up 'I he stuff sent down was the same as that which the previous lessees had got. It was good tin He sent it down uncleared at the request of the legal manager, who said the directors were going to get a machine for cleaning He could not explain how it was that there was such a difference as that exhibited between the ore which, according to Mr Newbery, produced 73 per cent, and that which had only 1 or 2 per cent. He had taken up extra ground, and when Mr Elliott came up he approved of it. There was good tin, and he recommended that before the claim was sold as advertised, some efficient man or men should be sent up to see the place Mr Li\d -You suggest, then, that the stuff must have been changed on the way down' (Laughter) Mr Norton The Bluff I sent down should yield 20 per cent I have my own opinion that it was changed I think it is a shame that operations at the two claims- this and the Tallangatta should be suspended Mr Luke -I paid my calls on the distinct understanding that the claim was to be carried on Mr Elliott -Before the call was made the directors had advanced a considerable sum of money themselves They could do no less than stop Mr D W iiiTi (one of the directors) failed to see what good a desultory conversation would do The most I ought to be torn from the faces of those who had been the swindlers Mr 1 Eliott had, unfortunately, got him into the affair and the moment he (Mr White) found that the mining manager was Mr Norton, he told the board that the thing would not be managed properly immediately on a new manager being sent up there came correct reports that the man would not pay for the getting It was between Mr. Norton on the one hand, and Mr Elliott on the other Mr Elliott was causing the property to be sold and the shareholders had not the ghost of a chance of getting a penny. The Chairman-Have we reason to believe that we are the victims of a conspiracy to defraud Mr White-Yee, but we cannot sheet it home We must grin and bear it We might try and frustrate the sale My opinion is, however, that it was called by some one in the first instance I am told that it is not a tin country Mr Norton - Adjoining companies are putting up machinery and getting the successfully Sinclair and his mate worked the claim successfully Mr Elliott of the meeting can see any good in the claim I will not prevent them having it At a creditor I felt I had got as good right to get my own out of it as any- body else The meeting shortly afterwards terminated without any resolution being taken into consideration
