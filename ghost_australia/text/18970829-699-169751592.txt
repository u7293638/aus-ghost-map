. ... A 'GRAVE' 8CANDAL. — Blooding ' the Faithful-' Sib,— Allow me a small space in your vain %b}e,^paper to point out the wrongs that are .Anr{ietrated by the despotic Bishop of the B.C. religion in this remote put of the eonqtty, in reference to the B.C. burial around. As I am given to understand tbat this piece of land was given to the people of this part by the Government of this colony, I am at a loss to see how those despotic Priests and Bishops hnve a right to charge the people of that denomination Such sums respectively, as £3, £2 and £1, besides sexton's fees, for reading prayers for the .dead. And for digging a grave, which the church charge* twelve shillings, the price paid here is only ten ahflUnge to the man that docs the hard graft; and his reverence pockets two shilling* and goes away smiling over the money be.has made out of the dead' when' he has failed to make it oat of the: living. How, ' Mr Editor, this is what 1 would like to know ; what right have priests to charge this exolbitant price for some un fortunate that hat the misfortune tudie in this plaice, to be buried in a piece of ground set apart for tbat purpose ? And mind yon If yon-have not the money yon have not the ghost of a show to get into the paddock: whUethomAlmlghty-^AUeiw^shlppenrun .the ijhow.- Hopwg.-Tjfe Editor, you .will .^so^on me fhc :ttopasti%:b&|obi. valuable Space, rsnd ^hoping it trlQ not be my lot to .-%ave to tzonble those craw- ttinnlpipg set and '.under their consecrated sod, -Jo, some time, or at leant until things are altered.— I am, eta, JOHN THOS.
