THE STORY-TELL.ER. TJHE WILLOW FARM: AN; ARTIST'S STORY.:; : That day passed uneyentfully. save in:one:respect, that on comting back by:river, to Ookhami towaids nine o'clotck at night, Michel: was seizid with a violent fit of coughin g, which obliged hinm to. abandohn his oar. I took his place, although -he protested against my doing so, after "having been ao ill so long;" '.but I itreiated to have my way, to'r I ha-idbeen struck by something:peculiar in. his cough;. and although!le" assuied us it was nbothing, ydtI felt without knowing why Y-vague sense of anxiety. ': t seemed to t- that 'when I had gained nmy point, and was insistirg upon wrapping up Michiel warmly, Rose May's eyes wyre fixed upon me in griatitude; and I am certain' that :when I took off my own scarf"to put round iny friend's lhrooat, I heard ai * voice- not. Michol's-- hi-Deri '' Thank you " . The next day we resumed our homely ife, Michel toiling 'hird and ceaselessly as before to publish thei book, Tfo which four hundred pbunds had been pritmised hiâ€¢ I woorking to drive thought away and zo kieep my spirit-in" subjectionf.. \Vork isaperhaps 'sorrow thappy ip tsoe' who can employ it. But whereas I had hoped thit e.achi ,day vwould help to alleviate my pain, wi was riot without a feaiful heai't-ac~ch that I began' to .see how each day, on tlie contrary, I needed more- woik to SKeep n?yself fiom wvyering.. "A lso, I noticed: that I was! daily 'losiin iti bodiy sJtrength that my frice' was be6 comning wan, my. eyes haggaid, and tiat ii'y features'instead of presavoring a calme collected look, w.re .fast as suiniug an appearance of se'ttled wretchedness. Michel attrituted :thi; to oveiori. and imiplored me to to take some rest. But lihe too, was strangely alt, ring,, and I, as anxious about him as l.lose was - coqplained that in thinkirig of otliea s he was neglecting himself.'. .Ever since the boat day that cihugh," which I had once o. tiwice noticed before, i.t never thought at all :serious, continiued to hold and tor=. nititt hii. r .E coughid a great: deal of "morniigs ;I I could isear him, thirough the flooi of my room, wlhihi was sitlhited just .above his.' but he piould laugh imy fears atwiy" when I spoke on thiin att'er, just as I. did too,. w-hen i.he told me that sometiing was up wvithi me? andithat I w.s:-only thd ghost of my former self.
