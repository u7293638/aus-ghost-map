SATURDAY, OCTOBER 19, 1378. .' . . - -£ zinnern tl,A,ltf *>ïi After sonie years o± i.-, ._~n, um many signs of a decided revival of nuning in tin's colony. There are also signs that our quartz lodes will continue to furnish employment for many years to come, and that á number of tliein which were abandoned will be before long profitably worked. The extra- ordinary revival of mining in the Dunolly district is a most cheering fact, and it may safely be said that the district will bo developed to an extent which few persons would have believed only a few months ago. Wc see that a local newspaper publishes a list of abandoned claims which only require properly working to be made to pay, and it is quite possible that the newspaper is right, though such predictions are gene- rally of a very hazardous character. But tho discoveries in the Queen's Birthday and other companies' grounds aro quite sufficient to engender more than ordi- nary confidence, and there is o very reason to suppose that a new era for mining has begun in that district. The Creswick district is another which is giving earnest of great things, which has, in fact, done great things already. For what distance the alluvial workings near Spring-hill will prove to be remu- nerative it is, of course, impossible to say, but there is no doxibt that a run of dee]) giound exists, which will be foi: to join with othei runs fiom the Ma boiough druitt lu fact, there in extensive basalt phtcau winch sunounded by goldfields, md t phtcau is, in truth, the origin ii di ¿lound thiough which the inuentciu ind men flowed, until they jon in one big she un, which fon its way to the sen 'Hie hv fioin the mimerons volcanoes"»! the ( ti ict has filled up the hollow, and n" the low giound the high, but bene, the hundieds of feet of stone Hie bl of the old sticams ia to be found, i most of them have been pioved to bighlv tuufcious Leids li ive b< tneed undei the basalt on evei) sti md it does not lequiio much acuiii to guess that when theio is so much the «ides theio is something in t middle This, in f ict, w is pointed c moie than twenl) j eil s ago, jet t distnct is now onl) being fanly open up, and the long concealed uches biouj to light Whit tlie ovtent oí tin nchcb nny be, no one cm (oil, but H not too much to say th it it is not t leasonuble to look foi sometiuly w< dei ful development, and the opening i gold field of vei) considonblc evtonl Anothei very -hceinig cnciimst mee the success which Ins íecently attond Hie long despised quail/ lodes in thci mediate vicinity of Ballant piop< Foi veij many yeais these lodes, thou, muneious expciimcnts woie tiled a: manj thousands of pounds lost, w ere i gaided as unpiofitible, andvisitois wc wont to dechio that the shafts had n been sunk deep enough to leach the in stone The force of these icnniks \v not vei) visible to those who coiiiidcn the matlei closely, because some of li quait/ had been xery nch neal the su face, °nd theie vas no appaient lea^i why it should diflei fiom the stoi found at Sandhill st oi clsewheie Hoi evei, it does diikr in many paiticuhi md has the advant ige of being muc moie easilj woiked than the Sam buist qu ut-7, while it possess the disadvantage of not contumn so good an avenge of gold Hoy evei, the mines of Ballaiat lm done a gi eat deal low aids solving ti. pioblem of woikmg this quaitr in piofitible mannet, and the solution ina be said to have como about by the foic of encumstances and tho stiong necess: ties of the times Ncaily all the lu companies failed, md the giound wi left to small pal ties, and the) luv I found out how to deal with it, and ni making veiy satisf ictory piograss ïh quaiteily letuins foi the conti ii divi sion, wheie these quail/ lodes ii i found, show tint the avenge 3 îeld fo the past quaitoi was Gdvvt 20 Ggi to the ton, which is 1 gi cat improve ment on thcviclds of man) picviou1 jen« Including tailings mci p)iito-f _J,177__ tons weie ciuslicd (lining tin quaitoi foi 1 yield of 8,228o?

eilects of a period of active denuda lion So fal, wo think, the proposed new sjstem of management highly judicious Our present stato forest aiea comprises about a million and a half au es, and the now bill gives the Go\crm_ont powei lo incieaso it by making now reseivations as ciicumstances may demand, so that tho two fiftlis of the present and futuie ícsenation which it ispioposed to keep open foi active operations may bo icasoiiably expected to prove amply suflicient for all the legitimate demands of the community Anothei important novelty contained m the bill is that undei it saw null owneis will not be let loose m tho foiests to work then wicked will uuon them, but will have to pioceed undei definite and strict ie¿uP>tion3 Each nullei will havo an aiea assigned to linn, foi his exclusive

to it he will be confined, so that he will bo undei uo temptation to i msack the foi est fu and near for paiticulaily eligible tices, and will bo piecluded fiom doing so Being sure of his temuc, he will bo able to w oik his ground systematically, «sing up all the tnnbei that is fit foi any useful puipose, and, managed m this way, each toi est aiea w ill pi obably supply tin co times as much

is only a fow ti ces that will split e^slly and advantageouslj, while almost anything will yield to tho aiguments of i ciiculai saw with a steam engine at its back And if no moie sphttcis aie licensed

state foiests Tho exact amount will be fixed by regulation, in \ low of the attendant ciicumstances m each case, but it may be understood generally that while the maximum loyalty will bo chaigcd upon exceptionally valuable timbei, like red gum, the impost will fall as tho value of the timbei declines, until it i caches a mini mum, oi nearly nominal late, m the case of dead timbei only lit to be used as fiiewood When tiees aie cut down then dimensions will be taken bj the forest officors, and the ti ees will be branded as soon theieaftei as may be found convenient, and the amount of the loyalty due upon them having been paul, they may be lenioved at the convenience of the íniUeis and splitters 'Hie bill takes powei to name acguhtions for othei pmposes besides those aheady íeferied to, including the _ Cácete., of the foiests against de struction by fiie, the pievention of mci obstiuction with dead timbei, the si7es at which tiees may be cut, the ínlhction ol penalties foi

woiking ?cattle, and when the foiest aieas aie atailable foi grazing purposes they will bo separately dealt with m that le spect We believe wo have touched upon all the principal provisions of this important piece of practical legislation, although, the bill not yet having been published, we have only general information as to Us contents. So far as we seo at pre- sent, the measure is one that may be reasonably expected to fulfil the inten tions of its authors, and save from wanton destruction what yet remains of the natural forest .¿treasures of the country. No doubt there will be an interested outcry against the . measure from certain quarters when its provisions becomo known. Some. wealthy and influential sawmill pio pnetors, who have horetofoie been in the enjoyment of a paitial monopoly of certain forests, through the efhcioncy of their machiuciy and the extent of then resources, will not íelish being confined withm bounds and limits, while the heretofore lawless sphttei will ob ject to being strictly bl ought within íegulations, and kept withm them by constant official inspection nnd supervision But we should think that all others will appiovo of the main features of the bill, as a moans of pi o tectnig the lemainmg foiests of the colony without increasing the puce of timbei to the consuinei, and as a means of improving the condition of the gi cat bulk of om timbei getters w îthout un fanly curtailing the profits of the few to whom the) aro at piesent a mine of wealth As the measuie has no political bealing, wo may hope to see it piomptly taken into consideration, and dealt with on its merits Wo needhaidly lomind ouiicadoisthat tho usual annual
