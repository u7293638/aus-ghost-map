? MELBOURNE. /fbom ovr OWX CORRESPONDENT.) Monday Erenin". Although the weather experienced to-day can scarcely bo described as favorable for out-of-door enjoyment, the temperature being unseasonably low, with occasional squalls and shower?; very faw of those per sons who had made up tiieir minds to cele brato New Year's Day—or rather its substi tute, the second of January, 18S2—by an ciuting appeared to have been deterred by the adverse aspect of the sky. The pleasure seekers had a great choice of pastimes and amusements, the principal attraction being the V.R.C. Champion meeting on the Flem ington course, while next camc the grand cricket match between the Eleven of All England and the combined team of Aus tralia. At each of the above points of ren dezvous there was a large crowd of specta-[ tors. Amongst other amusements on terra [ firma were tho monster Uerman pic-nic at Kewr the bicycle races and other sports in the Edinburgh. Gardens, and a ladies go-as you-please at tlie Pavilion, and minor attrac tipn^ of asiiiiilar kindj altogether too numer ous td ulciitio'n; Then frirtlie large class of holiday-seekers who delight for a trip down the Bay there were abundant means of grati fying their wish in that ..direction, the Golden Crown and Williams T making their usual trips to Queenscliff, Portsea, and Sor rento, while the Barrabool and Flinders were specially laid on for Portarlington, the Tamar for Schnapper Point, the Edina, the Alert, and the Albatross for Geelong, &c.; &c;> Although the doubtful state of the Weather in the morning 110 doubt prevented a good many perapiis from venturing on the " briny" wiio would havo done sd under more favorable circumstances; most of the steamers were fairly well filled, and those amongst the.;passejigcrs who, ,could Stand a , little tossing about without ill efl'dct' in the: shape of sea-sickness no doubt had a pleasant time of it. . ■ (from the evening mail.) An accident, resulting in the immediate death of a man named William Prior oc curred at the South Yarra station this morn ing From information to Hand it 'appears ihatthe unfortunate man was engaged in selling race-cards on the platform, when the 10.40 train from Windsor to Melbourne, arrived. After the train started lie stiil per-: sisted, though cautioned by the porteiy to walk by the side of the carriage with tlie ob ject of sailing racercards to the' passengers. One carriage having a projecting footboard,, caught the unfortunate man by the legs, and he «\as hurled on the rails, run over "by the train, and killed instantaneously. Dr. Wooldridge was quickly on the scene, but the iiian was beyond all earthly help. Con stable Flannery removed the body to the morgue, where it now lies awaiting an in quest. . A yQunor girl named Ellen Ashman, 15 years of.dgd, has, been reported to tlie police as.missiiig from ller home, Nicholson-street, Fitzroy. She has dark hair and complexion; Jewish bast of countenance, and was attired in a wiiicey dress; The police have reason to believe that the girl was decoyed from her libme for immoral purposes. At 11 o'clock this, morning the six dhys "Go-as-yoii-please" for £200 'a side between Miss Wallis, theSydney champion, and Miss Phillips, who recently did a great perfor mance at the Hippodrome, was commenced. ' There was a large attendance, and both women went off at a reit pace. Both com petitors nrHieavily backed. A- 31 o'c'ock this mbrning the lea'dinij' fy'embei's of tlie congregation of St. Patricia's Cathedral,, assembled in the Archbisho ps1 library, when the Vicar-General (Dr. Fitz patrick), on behalf of the clergy and laity •' - presented the Very Rev. Prior Butier; With a cheque for £150, voluntarily subscribed in recognition of his zealous missionary labors during the past fortnight. In roply the reverend gentleman referred to the genuine spirit of practical Catholicity that was dis played throughout the mission, and notlmv he said, gratified him more than tlie kr-/o , attendance of young people. This circ 'in s ance augured well for 'the future, of t P church id Victoria, and lie trusted the »ih <| work performed during Hthe last fortin^,,' would bo permanent in its effects; A ivf-r .ence to the possibility of the v -reread r^ntle- | man s permanently remaining in ■'Melbourne was received witli much applause. ■ ..
