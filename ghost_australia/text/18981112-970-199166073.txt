Saw was one of the crew of men sent out to " badd fire " (fight fire with fire), and be declares thiC their experience "was most thrilling. WhOflf setting fire to a thicket that crowned a rocky* ridge, he and his crew were startled to fiadf themselves suddenly in the midst of a lot oE rattlesnakes. The forest fire was advancing upi the side of the hill at a rapid rate. Its whistt-f ing, whirring sound as it devoured the hen tops was terrific, and the men were bent i building a line of fire to start toward it, ho|i that when the two lines met the fury of 1 flames would be subdued tor lack of material < which to feed. It was while thus employed 1 they encountered the snakes. The ground! seemed to be literally alive with rattlers, 1 reptiles crawling in the direction of a re bluff not more than one hundred yards disti The men were all equipped with high-top. leather boots and paid little heed to the snake*, steppiug on them as though they were but harmless old sticks. Campbell says that tin rattling made by the reptiles could be heui above the roar of the distant flames. Tb* " backfire " made by the men caught dozens uE crawlers and they were burned to death. Campbell said he watched several of the r&ttlezs; " give up the ghost." When the flames advanced so close that the snakes saw further aycape was impossible they would coil op inÂ» heap, darting their heads angrily at the toi -goes of flame, tben suddenly relapse, when the heatr overcame them, a momeut later to be devotuftdj
