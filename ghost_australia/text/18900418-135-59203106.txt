?T OOi tGABBI[E. (FRno oun owN CORRESPONDENT.) April 17. Now the Easter holidays are over. Toongabbie "hus once more settled down again. The sawmills are again busy at work, as well as those engaged in the timber trade and otherwise. DMr. T. Anderson has made a start at his don?Gact, which has given employ ment to a great many hands. I under= stand that them-Messrs. Murren Bros. are shortly to make a start also at their contract, which will make a stir in Toonigabbie for a while. * The weather for the past few days has. been of rather a wintry charagtei. Mr. Jamnes Stirling, the Governlpent Geological Surveyor, delivered a very interesting and instructive lecture `on coal, in. the Mechanics', oil the 11th inst., but owing to.theâ€¢ bad state of the weather the attendance was very. poor. Mr. Stirling is to be very highly complimented on his efforts, and a more beautiful display of lantern views could not possibly be found. The lecture was interspersed with songs and recitations by the following ladies and gentleman :-Misses Hum phrey and Wallace and Mr. Townsend. Mr. F. Klein, the president of the Literary and Debating Society, occu pied the chair. The evenings enter tainment was brought to a close by Mr. Goodwin proposing a hearty vote of thanks to the lecturer, and seconded by Mr. Bosustow, and carried by acclamation ; to which Mr. Stirling very ably responded. I am informed that the financial results of the very successful ball in connection with the Loyal Toongabbie Lodge have been very satisfactory, leavinig'a nice little surplus. I notice by posters that the members of the Quadrille Assembly are again making a move. A meeting was held on Wednesday evening and it was de cided to start immediately. The following is the syllabus formed for the remaining six weeks of the half year, in connection with the Literary and Debating Society :-1st. Debate: "Is it rational to believe in Ghosts." 2nd. Essays; open subjects. 3rd. Songs, readings, recitations.
