The Starving Professions. Year after year the universities of the ?colonies turn out lawyers and dootors by the score, with the result that those professions are so overorowded that half the members sorane alone? on earnings that in manv oases a small suburban shopkeeper would despise. Doctors nowadays are as plentiful as flowers in the spring, and morlical advice can be ob tained for a pint of beer in many oases, and for no more than a shilling in a greater num ber. Only the leading dootors do at all well ; the rank and file spend their lives in desperate struggles with tho wolf at the door. The law is in a similar bad way, Whether it be that the goone that gave the golden egg in years gone by has succumbed to repeated overdoses of long bills, or that the commercial morality of the people has vastly improved, the fact remains that busi ness at the courts is but the ghost of its former self. Barristers, whose annual in come at the bar a few years ago amounted to thousands, have now to be content with hundreds, and some of the smaller craft would probably go down if it were not for an occasional timely relief in the shape of a brief from the Crown Law Department. Barristers sit for w.eeks and weeks, months and months, years and years wait ing for briefs that never come, and solicitors prow old men waiting for their first client. During the hearing of a divorce suit in Mel bourne last week, Mr. Purves informed the Chief. Justice that ' but for one of these big cases now and then the profession would starve j' and it is not long since Mr. Jus tice Hood, in refusing a youth permission to touch the principal of a small estate coming to him in order to find money for completing his university career, advised him that he would do much better at a trade than in an overcrowded profession. The professions are played out in thiB oountry, and the advice of Mr. Justice Hood should be seriously considered by every parent. The tradesman has all the best\df it nowadays.
