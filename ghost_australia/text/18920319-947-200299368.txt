I ' found l-it already half .filled with' a brilliant ; assemblage 'of- guests. My host, arid a middle- aged lady whom he introduced to me as his widowed sister, Mrs Polybank,. shook hands with me cordially;' but :- MisB Naroissa West moreland, who ,wa8 standing beside her father, favoured; me only, with the iciest of bows. 'ABBiiredly;'lI: 'thought;' as I stepped aside to make room for freBh arrivals, the smile of recognition which 1 had once fancied she had bestowed upon me muBt have, .verily been an optioal delusion.' Despite her cold reception of me, I could not' refrain from regarding her with undisguised admiration. She wore a pale blue dress fleoked here and there with olusterB of white violets, and1 her ' sunny - hair was ' croWned with' the same flowers. In her fair loveliness she might, I ardently thought, have been mistaken for another Undin'o newly created from the azure summer seas. Just before dinner was announced, Mrs Polybank said -something in a low tone to her niece, and the latter, in reply) slightly, but decisively, shook her head. I could not, of course, verify my sub pioion, but I at once surmised that Miss Westmoreland had refused to let me have the' honour of taking her into dinner. A few minutes later, Mrs Polyblank intro duoed me to my dinner companion — a piquant, dark-haired girl, Miss Pauline Leslie by name. ' Why, Mr Tempest and I are old friends,' said Miss Leslie, with a Bmile which showed her white, even teetb -; 'we do not need any introduction,' ' Escape was impossible. Mrs Polyblank had already left us, and was busily engaged ia pairing her other guests.-. ' I could only, with a feeling of despair, await the' denoumtnt which, must, I thought, now surely come.
