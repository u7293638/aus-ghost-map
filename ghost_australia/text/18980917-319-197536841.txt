Where was heaven, nnd; what was .heaven? A frosli puzzle for the little hrniu. . And' how could nnyone he "every wlieres" rill at once. Impossible. Jaeky dismissed the Idea altogether; for if God -wns: everywhere— why He'd bo In that room, and the hare possibility of this alarm ed him, for some unaccountable reason. But he wondered about "heaven.-" '- The ; long hours passed Blowiy. Jacky still sat on the old hassock. He felt warmer covered up iu the rags; hut he began to get dreadfully, hungry. His father had com manded blm f.o stop there till he came back. Ho/longed for,, and yet dreaded the man's return. Would he bring home any food? Ho wondered If his -mother got hot soup In heaven/ Once lie lind hud n whole basin of hot soup. A lady had brought It for his mother. Sbe'couldn't drink It, nnd Jnckv had bad "the lot." 'He felt lonely without bis mother, but 'hot miserable. She hnd so often, benten him. Towards 4 o'clock twi light crept into the room, making It more .dismal .tlinu ever; and he grew, frightened. All sorts of horrible thoughts came Into his mlntl; dreadful fnnclcs, too dreadful for ex pression, even to. himself, crowded his brain. Once- be lind heard "ri neighbor, Mrs. Jones, tell bis mother a ghost story. He could not hive explained. what was mcunt by a ghost, but he knew It wns something connected with . death— something that could drive a person stark-staring mad If ouee seen. For lind not Mrs. Jones declared tlmt that had happened to her married daughter's sister- In-law, on tlie death of her husband? If n-. gliost should come Into the room.. -. . . "rind If lie should see It! Iforror of horrors! At last, unable to contain him self any longer, he sprang up, and rushed at the door. There was a moment of al most maddening terror before he could turn the broken handle, nnd then he darted out on lo the landing as If an army of ghosta were at Ills heels. Tlie landing wus .even darker than the -'attic, for It had no window. Still he felt safer there than In that dreadful room, crowded' with the 'unspeakable "phantoms -of tils excited imagination. He sat down on the top step, breathing heavily, his miserable, pinched little face ashy white, his eyes wild and staring. After . a hit he leaned his tired head against the grimy wall, and wns half falling asleep when he felt some thing soft against his bare foot. He stooped, and in the dim light saw a small white kitten. In another .minute he had it In his arms, a beautiful snowwhlte kitten. Somebody's lost pot. He held .bis prize close to bis breast, and examined her. Then holding the dainty little crea ture to him, he stumbled haea Into the room. He no longer felt the'.Meast .hit afraid; the - feel of the .little, cat " .In ,hls arms, something- alive arid, warm', dispelled those awful phantoms as If' by magic. He cuddled down 'among' the evil-smelling rags, arid .the kitten ' crept- ,'yct Closer; rind closer, ' till ., she ; nestled ,'a\purrlug 'ball '£of ,corit'entjagritns't.hls.tlirori(;,ii : Arid so wrirm'ria; ' soolli'ed and' crimforted,: thejr both fell asleep.'"- '-'lb "wis Towrirds.-tbe 'small /hours'/of early .morning .that' Jacky/ wiis ; awoke' by 'a': kick, 'from'; "a 'heavy, boot.';.'

The boy let the; cat '6llp from his anns arid stood staring' in horror. The mari's.face was a deep purple, and convulsed with pain. Ills hands were clenched; his eyes staring; his breathing came In heavy, labored gasps.' As Jacky watched — was It for hours or minutes?— his heart froze with fear. . Sud denly the choking, stertorous ' breathing ceased; the great, bloated body gave one more convulsive slilvei»-and lay quiet for ever. In the room which liad. been full , of those awful sounds a sudden stillness settled down — a stillness so profound that' fresh' terrors seized upon the boy. - "Father, Father"— the words stuck, in Jits dry throat as he tried to cry them out. The klttcu raised her dainty head, 'arid - ceased clawing, at a fish, to gaze at Jacky ;: and then around the room, with a frightened look. The child, trembling In every limb, sank down on the spot, where he was starid- nlg. What did It all mean? Thosc;fearful groans still rang in his ears, :arion the deathly stillness smote, them yet more cruelly— and then that great bloated body lying prone upon the floor. It had fallen sideways iri, tlie last struggle. Almost It seemed as if It still fought. ... , And yet was it, could It he that he— his father- was dead? How still be lay. Jacky arose, and on tlpioc crossed the room. And the littlc ent crept after him. The hoy stooped over tlie prostrate form. "Father," he murmured. "Daddy. . .The bleared, strained eyes stared back at him, No responsive gleam In thnt awful isthre. - The left hand clenched, lay on the "chest; the sturdy, -powerful- legs,- one half bent, the other thrown firmly ngnlnst tbo door, barring ail exit, were, nevertheless, suggestive of .ritter helplessness, , -Dead, Indeed! \ And the day wore on— the long, cold, mis erable day.

Once.In' his agony ho cried out/as lie'-had- so.oftenihcard the mon-und woriien.arouud .'him; .-"Goil 'elp urn." ; V; Somehow.- the words comforted him. He whispered them to himself over and over, again. Would God help him— n little, frlgh- tened 'child, starving to dorith In a garret. ; Had he been dozing? There was knocking and banging at the door, and loud voices were calling to htm to open. Suddenly the crazy puucls gave way, and stumbling lu over the dead body enrne two men. Tliey were the red-nosed undertaker and his lean assistant. "Holy Moses." cxclulmcd the former, turn ing from the child to the corpse, over which his companion was bending. "We come to sec If by chaiist I'd dropped my pocketbook here, and here we've pinniped smack on to another Job, ain't we- Joq?" "Dead as mutton," responded the .long man briefly. "And wbat's to become of blm?" asked the undertaker. Indicating Jacky. "He enn't stop here. Was that (pointing) yer father or yer uncle, sonny?" "It's dad," wept the boy. "There was only mother and dad and me. Don't leave rn'e 'ere. I'm that frightened, and so's ICltty. 'God 'elp me,' I says, and then'you come." The unconscious trust iu the words ap pealed lo the red-nosed man. He patted Jacky's head. "There, don't cry, I'll take you home to-night, and to-morrer 'ull be time enough to see about the Neglected Chil dren's or tlie Industrial." "Or the Befonnutory," Interposed tlie long man, gloomily. "Bosb!" cried the undertaker, . angrily, "D yer want ter frighten lilm, Joe? For what harm's lie done?" "That's got to he found out," replied Joe, who was evidently u pessimist, nnd distrus ted huniuit nature. "Young as he Is, remem ber what the Bible says — 1 was born In sin, and In sin .... "Oh, shut up," Interrnptcd the other, "It's past sermon time. We'd best go for tlie pcrllee first." That night, for the first time In Ills life, Jacky slept In n bed. Mrs. Tliuinus, the un dertaker's wife, eanio -down after ' tucking lilm up. wljilng lier eyes. Her husband was smoking over the cheery kitchen fire. Close- to tlie fender, the kltteu.lny contentedly purring. "He's asleep at last, bless lilm," said the good woman, addressing her hiisbaiid; "and fancy, lie says to me 'What's prayers." 'It's asking of God for what you want,' says I. 'All,' lig says, 'I listed Illin when I was so frightened. 'God 'elp me,' I says, aud then he come. - He meant you, dear," laying her hand on lier husband's sleeve. And. then he says, 'What's heaven?' 'A beautiful; bright, shlnlng.plnce,' 1 says. 'Ah, then,' he says, cuddling Ills head down on to tlie pillow, 'tills must bo It.' With that, he fell asleep, pretty Innocent." She paused. Mr. Thomas cleared Ills throat. "Jane," lie said, "unless I'm much mistook, thnt boy. In the undertaking line, might make a fortune. He's got a soft face, rind for measuring infants . . . Mrs. Thomas turned aside her liead. '.'But years might harden lilm." continued her husband, "there's no sa.viiig:-look at mo!" ."Yon," cried his wife, fondly kissing his scrubby cheek, "why you're the softest- hearted man as ever breathed. But oh," breaking irito tears, "I eou't bear to think of tlie 'Industrial' for him. He's such a little chap." ' "I measured him with my eye," said the undertaker, solemnly ;. "he'd have fitted easy Into a "Oil ; hush, hush," whispered Mrs. Thomas, i'if our little Willie had lived " " Mr. Thomas laid down Ills pipe, and put his arm around his. wife. ./ "Have It yer own way Jenny," lie said, and the kitten purred contentedly. .
