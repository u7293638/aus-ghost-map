(iPEN COLUMN (To tlhe Editor of the Worker.) A VOilCE FROM THE BUSH ''?*''' Di-.au Wobkrh, — It is with mixed feelings. of \- 'iV 'k^mic! m-}e that I read from time to time s',of ? ; ':--? awl Tetters in the Worker from' a class -' «(???? -tins ca! iing themselves Democrats, notably, '.. n^\^ llohn/an, iieeby and Hughes. I feel ?(??'«?: at tht; fact that these individuate' have '})??'; s -iScien/i; perception to enable them to see i ' \t\\- ey ave doing the work of the enemies of ?-, -'n''..-racy ; tals-o that they cannot get anyone to lft:-ii r,o tbWi-v; and -rage at their being out of tl'^'-TiV.'i of ^omo of ourbushmen's number 14's, 1 ??' ,' ?.???, motion of which to their latter euds \\\\- uJd !'-'.t.V« an effective influence on their actions. TV;.so peiiilerneh, with the blatant effrontery, of v^.udbatjs, wind out. their theories to their audi A-iof:, who (if they had the time to'think, as we , people have, also the experiences of bush feopio) would pelt them with something harder tfi-.-n rotten eggs. For this reason they have la'iely l-een engaged in throwing mud at a class o'1'' informers who in the past have proved them srivos true to Democracy, who have always been in r,h'e front of the figtiV against class privileges, ?\vli 'o have attacked the greatest monopoly, which is he monopoly on wljich all the smaller ones rets'.!' and the one which Socialists will have to ret ove ' ;: before their principles can have any ? {iei'ifH.'ial effect— the land monopoly. Now, the Simile Taxers have not spared that institution. Tht'iY agitation against private ownership has cUrv more for Democratic reform in a few years thu.' a!! the Socialistic writings and speeches hav- for half a century. The Single Tax prin cip'ij ii-3 within measurable distance of practical % po'liios. while State Socialism has not the ghost oft chi!.uce,. so why can't the Socialists referred to ibovo join in drawing the teeth of this «rw.i:.-st of all class privileges, and, as it will be th- toughest battle to win, it requires a unity ol i',lt true men. When that is effected, then Aye mn arford to discuss our differences, but not uiiv') then. Here is an instance of how land uuv.opoly works. Within four miles of this to'V;i is an estate that wa,s put together by clu.imying at a cost of £1 por acre. It has 450 niles frontage to the Tumut and M|i.rrum bw.'oe rivers, 400 acres of this land has been le'/it pi annual rental of 30s an acre. Taking tli.. rent as fixed at 10 per cent, on the capital vii.uo.il gives £15 per acre, or an increase on co;: of the land of £14 per acre. This land has xii-x been improved iry the owner, but has been us i hitherto as a sheep walk, with a ring fence ro-.'iid-it, The whole estate employs two men an.' four dogs throughout the year, except at sin .ring time. The owner wanted a man to do sor. o general knockabout work the other day. 'YYI-i/the job was applied for and*£laweek ask-. i? as wages, the owner refused to give it,/ stai'..g that he could get scores of men in Mey bov.; ne glad to work for 8s per week and ration/. Nov.. Messrs Hohnan and Co., just fix some yof Oec.-f.'e's superficialism on to this case; f/so mul./ply it by about half-a- million, and you i'ill : 'iind I he reason why there are so many unSm ploy' (1 men in New South Wales. You will also find r,liat if George's ' superficialisms ' were put in p; ;;ctice in regard to land, the owner in ques tion vould not be able to get able-bodied men ; for eight bob a week and draw the increase ;? vaJ u.'. of .614 per acre on land that he paid only ) £1 iV;, and on the proceeds live in style in Mel '??. bour.^, nine months out of twelve. __ .,?
