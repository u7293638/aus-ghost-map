DUBBO IS VISITED BY A GHOST WHICH FRIGHTENS A FAMILY NEARLY TO DEATH. J IT WANTS REST, SO THROWS THE FURNITURE ROUND, AND MEANDERS ABOUT AND WILL NOT BE COMFORTED. Dubbo, Tuesday. ? .between tne natural ana tne super natural the town is 'rather excited at present. The former is tho prospect of a lush at Belarbigal, and the latter is caused by the story of a wandering spirit which is invisible, but speaks and does other actions too numerous to mention, and all in broad daylight. The family who are the victims of tho un welcome-visits reside at Collbaggie Creek, on old Balladoran Run. Their name is oiein, ana sney consist or eleven persons, most of whom are adults. They all tell tho same thing, and which is briefly as follows : â€” About two years ago Peter Stein selec ted, on the Collbaggie, a large area. After he had become comfortably settled strange sounds were heard. To cut a long story short, the family assert, one and all, that something speaks to them in broad day light and, on being ques tioned as to its businoss, replies that it wants rest and gives tho name of its father, mother and sisters. lis father, it states, died in the Cootamundra hospi tal 18 years sinco. Naturally tho people are a bit anxious ns sometimes tho ghostly visitor throws the furniture about in all directions and plays tho mischief with the crockery belonging to the establishment. Tho family are always aware when tho spirit is about to. begin business from the excited manner of the dogs about the place, which are ovidently more frightened than tho humans. At the request of Mr. Stein, the Rev. Father Byrne visited tho place last Sunday week and returned tho next day, he having seen and heard nothing. He promised, should tho unwelcome visitor again mako himself felt, to go and stay thero a week to satisfy the anxious peoplo.
