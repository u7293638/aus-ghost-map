DRESS REFORM., The Prussian Government is serionsly con sidering the advisability of issuing a dooree forbidding women to wear trains on the publio promenades. It is claimed that those Btreet-sweeping apipondages stir tap the dust and scatter far and wide the germs of disease, with whioh it is alloged to be filled. The ponce ot Aieran, tno tuenionable watering place in the l)yrol, recoutly made such an order, with the result that the bacteria cranks and dress-reform faddistâˆˆ several localities are calling for its imitation. The Prussian House of Deputies enjoys the distinction of heing the only legislative body to drop minor subjeots, such as tho budget, agricultural depression, etc., and to tako up this momentous one of the wearing of trains by women. From beginning to end, the Teutonic states men treated the subjeot with great serious ness, and not so much as the ghost of a joko marred the debate. Soon wo expect to hear from some learned crank that bacteria lodge in the hair, and that both males and females should be oompelled by law to keep their heads shaved.
