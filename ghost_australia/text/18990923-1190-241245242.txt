A NEW CAPER. : have before me In writing the fact ccerded that at a ball which took place jot long ago "two couples danced In the jpenlng set" who were "not entitled or j.nds because of this, that their names i. "should not appear." I am afraid he Is J i young man without sufiieient apprecia tion of the— shall we s.iy?— -aplomb, of those "two couples." I think most de cidedly people who can walk into an open ing set unasked deserve very special men tion. They have given a novelty to that stereotyped thing, the opening seL They have made one feel that good fun may be misled by not arriving In time to hoc the opening set at very dance. They have Introduced pos- lihilltles which, if persisted in. might mean that others like them could "hould the Huro, ' and those who were requested :o dance the opening set would have to 40 down lower. Imagine the Governor ind party pushed to the lower end. whilst some 'couples" who have come In unask ed cavort at the lop of the room. The writer strikes me sis indlgnanL I can only laugh. I have not st ghost of an idea who ili.se "two couples" wore; can my Infor mant tell me, I thought that 1 knew :lto ways of Melbourne society, and ke loid here is a brand new trick. Quite a oral Idea, too— like so many others. Fu ture announcements of the opening set may be completed by some such remark as follows: "Mr H. and Miss C. were not requested to be there: they were there alt lh'» same. Mr D. and Mrs E. were not mtitled to be there: but a trifle like that did not prevent their walking In and iunclng." These "two couples" have not only qullc caught my fancy, but Inspired » wholly original. If somewhat brief, pome," called "The Reason," or "'Cos tVhy":— Where are you going, my pretty maid? Into the first set. sir, she sold. IVhy are you going, my pretty maid? Cos nobody asked me, sir. she said.
