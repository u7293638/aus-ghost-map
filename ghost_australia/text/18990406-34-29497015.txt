ENGLISH LITERARY (From our Special Correspondent.) London, February 17, 1899. All who enjoyed Miss Mary Kingsley's delightnilly-written record of her recent travels will avidly seize the 'milky volume of "West African studies," in which she return.-, to the subject. Truth to tell, bow ever. l"m iiiraid the general reader will complain iha^ there is t-.H? mudi study and too little rtory in this new book, it would certainly gaiu cuoniiuu?!" i>y tom iireasicn. I skipped rcinorsely, -iu<i hy so doing <vinie on lots of £>>i>d bus 1 .-nould never have reuciied h.id 1 conscientiously attempted 10 plod ihrough «3t? solid pages.

Ou o;:e of her iislung expeditions Miss Kings ley very nearly caiay to grief in isochinp a. catlisli —a iiorribe beast, whicu you must rtcn wiiii a club, and whose spiky lins yot: muM. knock oil with the same hei'oie yoa can venzure to haul him on board your cranky canoe.

All ihe reviewers cive large extracts from Miss Kingshn's valuable and informative ••onciusioiin antTT; witchcraft and fetishes. 1 'have not space for thai, buo may notice that one of tiie most, jnuttestuiF jnjiuu. in the -iiscusi-ion is the ahseorc oi ances.ro:' worshiji among vie ietishisttic races. Among tae>e the «ic.ul luaas docs not rise to the grade of a cod in me ■other world. All rhat happens in nVjiii is the release of rino of ihe cnniponcnb. of the living body. Of course the ghost's life after death is the same as lii.v before it- Hen^e :he dispatch to his gho.staiiip of __ wives, bjaves, iood, and so on. Miss Kingsley cun-ecrs the common idea that uk letiih is alAvavs enibotlied in .-omethni;:. i he fetish may or may not be embodied. Kvery object, roc]:, tree, stone, ic.. has? its life, spirit, ghost, or fetish. FciishiMii is a loiiu oi animissi. Mi*s Kingsley pic tures the mental state of a convert from fetishism, wiierein the cods are cruel, to the Christian religion. When, in f-orue day of trouble, the ex-fetishist faces the prob lem of an omnipotent Ciod and a suffer ing world, "and he turns and calls ujton the God he has been taughl will Wen, pity, and answer, his use of what the scoffers at the converted African call calch phrases is horribly heartrending to me, for 1 know how real", terribly real, the whole thing is to him, and 1 therefore see the temptation to return to those old gods—gods from whom lie never cxpe<*ed pity, presided over by a Rod that does not care. AU that he had to do with them, was not to irritate them, to propitiate them, to buy their services \i-Jien wauled, and. above all, to dodge and avoid them, piule he lougbt it out and managed devils' at large." I=e " Academy " has bt>en improved in many respects by (jie infusion of new blood, though 1 regret ro noiice. a tendency to lesurrccl some of ihe silly affeciouona of the "National Oi>server" iv jis heyday. Ail instance oi this in a recent issue was the absolutely uncalled for .-.nd irrelevant attack on ",!ohn Halifax, *ie?tlenian." To defend a novel which lias stood the supreme test of selling in thousands at six shillings lit is only quite recently cheap editions hare been obtainable) for half a century would be absurd. Kvery raittdle class young Englishman leads the book in his generation. It is as inevitable as "liobiuson Crusoe," and" quite as profit able. That the editor of the "'Academy," who considers the lucubrations of that dis- mal creature, Joseph Conrad, the finest book of 1898, and gushes illimitably over Mrs. Craigie, should despise Miss Mulock's masterpiece \is. perhaps natural. 1 will, however, wager him a fair sum that long after "Tales of l 7nrest ?I and "Some Emo tions of a 'Moral" are forgotten and un obtainable "Jo'kii Halifax ivjjl be selling trisUy. "Mr. Renry Murray (Da\\-id C"}irisiie"s younger brother! is uot a person for wiiose critical actiuieu aoybodv I've ever heard of holils a. specially his"n recard. JStill I con less I was rather pleased to read in the "Sunday Snn" over his signature a slash ing a'itack four columns ]oug on Mr. Waits- Dunton's "Aylwin." The manner in which this romance has been "log-rolled" into popularity amounts to something like a literary oiandal. The alory has cood poinus. as 1 indicated when it a|>pcared, tiui that it deserves ihe tons of laudatory butter recklessly slobbered over it 1 really cannot see. Qllr. Murray spoils his case by extravagant abuse —ihe oiler cxireme. I. am, however, £0 far with him that I doubt tjie ability of any of the exuberant. scribes who called "Ayiwin"' "a i<ocni in prose.'* "a pro.>e masifcr^ieiv,"* "a work of geuius,"' &.<?., to extract therefrom a. t>inglc pa^sase which risei above the veriest medi ocrity. 1 wrote you not long ago that Kipling's literary agents had their eyes open, and that "wholesale piracy of his copyright poems and articles was to be drastically slopi>cd. Operations have commenced with "The White Man's Hurden,' pub lished in America in "McClure's Maga zine" on the 291h ult., and in the London "'Times'' of the 4th. The poem created a (Treat stir in the States, and the "Daily Mail's" Xcw York coires|>ondeni prouiptly cabled ovci' the cream of it. Xatuially pro\\-incial papers by the dozen annexed the same. They arc now feelimr ack. The ""Times." which bad purcliased the right of publication in England for 100 guineas, refused \o complete jiayment, oa"ing to infringement of copyright, and ■MeClure's asems are now bomSharding the "Mail" and its nroijjer viraies vrith -writs. The Si^vcnson letters now runnius through "'Scribncr"' arc much more attrac tive in tone man his VaJima budget. ITiey were, many of them, written from Edin burgh a+ the bright time the poet- novelist was jotting dnwn "Virginibus I'uerisque," and bubble over with good «=pirits. One of tfl'- iiixjocnt portnm contains t>c?n-enson's lirst impressions of the friend, mentor, and ctfllobonucui. who was presently jo exer cise such a. powerful innnencc ovor his career.
