TO TIIE EDITOR OF THE LEADER. SIR,—In Air. Elliott's reply to Mr James, which appeared in your issue of the 3rd inst., he says "That this incident was a miracle is evident bec:iu.se the rain and thunder came in obedience to the WILL OF MAN." The writer of this claims to be in the Apostolic succession, if so, he ought to have Apostolic knowledge. Would he kindly enlighten my mind by showing ine how this hamonizes with the following passages of Scripture: —" All Scripture is given by inspiration of God."—II. Tim., IlL, 16, that, of course, must include Samuel's prayer ; also "That in old time holy men spake as thev were moved liv tlie Holy Ghost." —I. Peter 1., 20, 21. * The Apostle Paul, who said he received his knowledge by the revelation of Jesus Christ, shows us iu Rom. VIII., 2<i, 27—"That we know not how to pray as we ought, but that the Spirit makctli intercession for u AOEORIUXO TO THE WILL OF GOD." Would he also let me know if the Church of God is organic or Spiritual ? Of course I want scriptural answers, and not according to the traditions of the fathers, and he will oblige.—Yours, etc.. Nuinurkah, June 7th, 1807. JOHN REED.
