SitK ONTHE TERRACE. L% ' Acerbam egg in-Sydney is bearing evil Aptness to the customs _o£ Western AUB i'tealia. It -was once an innocent china egg £jis void'of reproach as any article of the kind.

The Insurance Company- sceptical as these bodies invariably are-declined to pay up, as the deceased's mode of exit from this vale of tears, had been, it con- tended, neither usual nor seemly. An action ensued and resulted in a verdict for the defendant 'company, followed by an appeal and a total reversal of the lower court's decision. So a new terror has been added to the days of the Lite Insurance manager whose liues run in districts heavily populated by the gay and festive 'skeeter.
