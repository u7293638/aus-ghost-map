ACCIDENT TO TIIE STEAMER IONIC. IlnnAKT, Thursday. — By tho arrival of the steamer Huahine, news w:is received of an accident to tho steamer Ionic on February 8 in lat. 23d eg. 26min. smalt, long. 8 deg. 16min. cast. Tho tail shaft parted in tho stern tube, and tho stern tube and gland were smashed, rendering the engines useless. Preparations were at, once ma le for any emergency, and the boats provisioned and lowered. The pro peller, after two attempts, was secured with two steel hawsers, and a chain was passed round it to prevent it from moving. Two drift buoys were then put off with information of the accident. Captain JCidnoy calculated that as the steamer was in the track of steamers between England and the Cape, a steamer leaving Table Bayou February 8 should pass early on tlie morning of the 11th. This was correct, as the Hawardim Castle's lights were sighted at 4 a.m. on that day. Arrangements were made, and she towed thorn into the Cupe at. the rate of 200 miles a day. The value of the ship and cargo is said to he £250,000. She had onboard 113 pas- stumors, 104 crew, mails, and 3000 tons of cargo. Captain Kidney received a testimonial from the passengers.

Full particulars were received in .Sydney yeitor- day cjf the stranding of the North Coast Steam Navigation Company's steamer Klectra at the Man ning River, 'lhc vessel arrived oli tlie bar from Sydney on Friday last, and the tug John Gollan put nil' with Pilot Murray, and reported 7ft. of water on tlie bar. Captain FunoU at once decided to enter tlie river, but in doing so the Plectra bumped and then stuck, when a sea caught, her bows and put, Iter on the north spit, where she remained lixcd, notwithstanding that the s.s. John Gollan followed her in, and endeavored to get her off' for some time, until the steel hawser, tested to bear u strain of 80 tons, snapped in two. The Eleetra was then at the mercy of the waves, and the seas drove her further on the spit us the day advanced. Had the flea which struck her caught her fairly on the stern, the vessel would no doubt iiave been carried into deep water, and nothing more would have been heard of the matter than that she " touched " coming in— a very familiar re mark in connection with vessels crossing shallow bar harbors. Tho landing of tlie passengers and mails was a somewhat hazardous undertaking, but was very carefully and skilfully performed about 4 o'clock, when tho tide had gone down a little, by Pilot Murray and his crew, in the pilot boat— a ropo having in the meantime been conveyed from tlie steamer to a tiee on shore, for the purpo:;eof steady ing tiio boat, which bobbed about like a cork on t he agitated and peething water. A passenger lias mado the following statement About lmlf-past 10 or a quarter to 11, 1 heard that tlie John Gollan was coining out, and alter a time someone said there was seven feet of water on the bar. Shoilly after wards I heard that the Eleetra was going to take the bar, and In a few minutes felt the steamer bump several Limes and then she appeared .sta tionary. I thought we had got into the liver, hut soon discovered that Ave were stuck on the bar. I im mediately jumped outof my berth, and told theotber passengers they bad better get up at once as 1 1 bought the steamer would smash up, at the same Lime hur riedly putting on a few clothes. One young lady, when she hoard what had happened, went into hys terics, and screamed terribly. The stewardess came in and informed us that there Avas no danger, but the sea wa beating against the steanu-r with much force, and it seemed as if each wave would .smash in her side, After dressing we went outnide, and could see the Avaiva breaking oAor a portion of tlie vessel. It was a verv misty morning, Avith light rain falling, audit looked as if wo were going to be wrecked. We heard tho sailors sounding and calling out tho depth of water, which viuied from 6ft. to 4ft. bin. Water was then found in the hold, and the pinups av ere set. going. After Availing from 11 o'clock, the time avc struck, until 4 in the afternoon, the pilot, boat, Avith a rope lixcd to a tree on the shore ami the steamer, came alongside, and we were told that any passengers wishing to go ashore would have to go then, as that would he the last chance that day. Tho boat was rocking about iu the surf, and seemed as if It would be capsized every minute, the men in charge having lifebelts round them. J decided to go in Lho boat, as 1 thought it better to risk being cap-dzcd in the .small boat than to stop on board all night, with (hu sea thumping against Lhc steamer and likely to break her up. We were nil landed safely, and then had to walk about a mile ami a half to the pilot station. On arrival there Mrs. Captain Mtiir invited ai! the passengers up to her place, Avliere she had u nice tea laid out., uud Aviiich Avas heartily appreciated by all, as there were not many who had felt inclined to eat on board tho steamer." Air. J. C. Woodlhorpo yesterday received the fol lowing telegram from Captain John Hall, of the .Sydney Underwriters' Association: — "Eleetra moved 20ft. this (Thursday) morning: weather line and calm. Tide bad. Prospects good Avith good tide." TELEGRAPHIC. IIOBAlVf.— Arrived, March 30: Oonz.h, etr., at 2 p.m., from Sydney.
