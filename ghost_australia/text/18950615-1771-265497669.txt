' - The police have received a communica- tion from .a Mr. James Lulied.Buffiiloj New. York, isekiiig information about his -lather, "William" Lutted, whp, : ' 'life states, ciaine to Melbourne 40 years -since ; was supposed to start a coach factory at Eaglehawk Gully, Maldon, and to have been murdered by oge of his ei»ploy& in the " fifties." The writer also states that "Lutted was supposed-to-have«hantied~: large quantity of " loose gold to th] police escort. Careful inquiries have re. suited in no information being ubtaine^ to throw any light on the matter, which is regarded as a hoax. Mr. Murray Smith on Wednesday took an important step, though without the sanction of the leader of the Opposition. The member for Hawthorn moved that the duties be reduced to a 25 percent, standatd, and in the course of a singularly able addtess dwelt upon the -urgent necessity for the reduction..'Sir James' E Patterson also spoke with marked sffe'et, and quoted statistics showing"that" the colony was being set back by the strario-' - ling rope of protection. The 'moticra'was taken as an adverse one by. the Premier who refused to allow members' a jfreJ r hand and thus . redeem their election' pledges. The position is altogifchlrSafi exttaordinary one ; the majority of hiciu" bersare 25 per centers, but dare not vote in accordance with their pledges. It would ppear that the conflicting elements and the attitude of the Premier will result'ln" n effort to reform.' thop<>h adjudged ecessary, proving futile. The debate was adjourned until Tuesday next. g s c The fourth subscription concert under the auspices of the Castlemaine Liedertafel is fixed for W'edujsday next.

The annual Dedication Festival of: the Trinity Chnrch was held, as aunounced, ou Sunday last, the preacher during the day being the Very Kevereud Dr. Vance, Dean of Melbourne. This being the new Dean's first visit to Maldon since bis appointment) considerable Interest was felt by the churchmen at his coming. The text chosen in the mornim; was II Chronicles, .xxxvi. 23, of which a masterly aud eloquent exposition was supplied upon the necessity of attention being given to the outward organisation of each congregation with a view to its thorough fficiency. The various good works in which the • members engaged were not ".indeed themselves a part of their spiritual life, yet stil}_ they were the ecaffjldiag. of the spiritual temple, without which it cbuld not fcejerected, and they were the human tools fth which they Wrked, but. while busily lgtged in thus building up the visible church, they must by no means .neglect the spiritual^temple of the Holy Ghost -with their hearts, whereby God dwelt in them, and- which,must, therefore, be preserved jure and holy. Iu the evening the tlxt was fiphesians Sii, 17 to 19, upon which the itev. entleman founded a touching and deeply piritual discourse, being 'listened to with lose ittentiouf Tie-large surpliced choir with the ladies rendered the musical portious vf-the-^ervice-wlth-^ood -eEfect under the able leadership of" Mr Robeits.
