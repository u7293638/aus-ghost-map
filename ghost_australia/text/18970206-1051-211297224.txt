A Noisy Ghost in Rutland. ! The little village of EdithweBton, in Rutlandshire, and, indeed, the whole district round, has been thrown into a state of unmistakable excite ment by a mysterious occurrence which seems to set investigation at deflanoe. At one of the houses ia the place, loud noises have been repeatedly heard, at all times of the day and night, the sounds resembling those which would result from knocking and banging doors ; and there is up to the present moment no apparent reason for the noises. Investigations have been carried out by dootors, clergymen, schoolmasters, police-offi- oers, and other men acouatomed to weigh evidence, but although, of course, the solution of the problem may eventually be found to be per fectly natural the affair iB yet a com plete mystery. It seems to be out of the question to believe that the noises are the result of praotioal joking, or the perpetrators must surely have been discovered before now. One of the doors of the house had been recently varnished ; and one day distinct knocks were heard, but the most, careful examination to find marks on the varnish proved futile. A reporter has visited a num ber of the inhabitants of the village and neighborhood, and his inquiries show that nearly every person in the village has heard the knocks, and that no one can give a reasonable explanation of them.
