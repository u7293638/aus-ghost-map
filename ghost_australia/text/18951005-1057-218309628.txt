GHOST-HUNTING AT HAOKNEY. EXTOAOBDINAnY SCENES. Seldom has suoh a scono occurrod in a London churchyard as was wit nessed during the early hours of tho morning of tho 21st August in tho churchyard of tho old parish church of St. John at Hackney, wlion fully a thousand men and womon turned out from thoir housosin tho neighbourhood to hunt the parish ghost. For somo time past pooplo passing through tho churchyard Into at night havo been startled by "a ghost in a shoot." Womon havo faintod with fright, and tho local newspapers havo publishod aooountsof thestrangoaffair. Wbothor this morning's scono was planned cannot be ascertained (says tho Wat- minieter Gazette of the 21st AuguBt), but between 10 and 11 o'olook last night a mixed orowd began to assemble at tho rear of the church whero the ghost was supposod to bo, and whoro in tho usual way scarcely anyone passos aftor 11 o'clock. A long wait until midnight, and then, as no ghost ap- poarod, the orowd went in search of it. Armod with lanterns and candles, and carrying stioks and stonos, the crowd climbod the railings from the path ways, and took possession of tho burial- ground. Graves and tombstones wore clambered over, and recontly-restorod mounds woro trampled down. A por tion of the crowd lookod upon tho wholo affair asajoke, and consequently every fow minutes tho cry was foolishly raisod of "There it goes!" and immediately tho whole orowd rushod in tho dirootion indicated, and, as no ghost could bo Hiion, it was argued by tho morosupor- stitious portion of tho crowd that tho ghost had disappeared into tho onrth. Othors in tho crowd amusod thomsolvos by making tho night hideous with imita tions of unearthly cries, and although thopolice were called to clear the placo, it was not until tho vergo of daylight thattb e last few dioappointod stragglers wont away.
