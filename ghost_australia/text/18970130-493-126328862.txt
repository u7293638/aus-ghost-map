THE CHRISTIAN. I The Christian, of all men, should be in earnest as to a properly enlightened conscience, He who accepts the revelation of God's will confesses that his conscience is no safe, guide until'it has been trained and instructed in that word, and that his'own will is a thing of uncertain and spasmodic energy, wilfulness rather than will, until it has been regenerated by the Holy Ghost. He cannot, if he be in earnest at all, be satisfied that he is doing God's will unless he has taken as much pains to know it, understand it, resolve it into rules of action, as he has the calling which he fol lows for his bodily support of social standing. In a word, he will not only be conscientious, but in a much stricter sense he will be con scientious about his conscience.
