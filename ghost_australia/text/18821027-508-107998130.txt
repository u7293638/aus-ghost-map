So sudden tras the action that Alick bad to speed away to prarent detection : and he burst into the kitchen with each a terrified air that all the negroes there started up and demanded with one accord what ailed Him and whether he had ' seen a ghost. He answered that he believed that he had Been 'dedebbilJ' Before they could aslc an explanation the parlour bell rang, and Alice, whose business it was to answer it when in the house, started im mediately to do so. 'He found his young mistress and her visitor standing before the parlour fire. * Alick, take a lamp and show this gentleman to his room — Major Hereward's room — and place yourself at his orders.* 'Yes, ma'am. Tour sarrink, sar !* respectfully answered the man, touching Mb forehead by way ol salutation, and then taking one of the lamps from the mantelpiece, and leading the way to the foot of the stairs, followed by the stranger. On showing the guest iofco that which was now the beat spare room, Allck became very com municative aud confidential, after the manner of his raoe j and he would also hare been very familiar and inquisitive had not the stranger checked him. He rolled a large easy-chair before the fire and then went to a wardrobe and took from it a wadded dressing gown of gray Japan silk, that had belonged to his late master, and hung it over the chair. Then he produced a pair of fur-lined slippers, whioh he placed on the rug below the chair, and, finally, he wared hia hand towards the seat and said, with polite solicitude - * Please now to make yourse'f conformable, ? ear, aaj* 'low me to help yer so to do 1 . Ef yer'll i 'low me to draw off yer ooat, sar, an' den sUp on dis gown atf set down in di» chair, I'll draw o2 yer boots an' put on de warm slippers.

All the negroes in the kitchen rushed out oi the door to see what was the matter. They found Aliok picking himself up and prayings ' Oh, Lor*, spare my libe dis time air* TO never do so no mo' I' * Wotfe de matterf Wotfe do matter r* cried a chorus of voices from the negro group.

After a little whispering consultation this plan was adopted, and the negroes crept up stairs and lay in waft In the hall near the door till all was still In the house* Meanwhile the intended victim of this con spiracy, all unooa«eious of his impending cap tivity, immediately on the ignominious flight of the negro, had thrown himself into his chair, fallen back and given vent ts an uproarious peal cf laughter, which was succeeded by another and another, as if he ooold not stop himseli, At length, however, he just happened to raise his eyes to the mantelpiece before him, and there, between the two lighted lamps, he caw a life-sized vignette of the young l&dy; of thahouse. The lovely face fascinated his attention. As he eased, the mood changed, tfc« mirth died out of tie countenance. Tears filled Ms eyes.
