Archbishop Redwood's Sermon. A passage in the written sermon of Dr. Red wood, Ton' the occasion of the opening- of St. Mary's Cathedral, on September 9, occasioned quite a local ecclesiastical storm in Sydney. The Evan- - gelical Council met on September 13, and pointed , * out that the words were ussd in the presence ot three of her Majesty's representatives; The pas- , ; sagë-was-as follows :-V-"The. leaders and'foundera v" of, Protestantism--Liuther,~ Calvin,-* and Zwingli, etc.-were notorious for their vices. , .Pro testantism covered Europe with blood and:ruins in the 16th century, and- has ever since been the helper and instrument .pf the worst foes of Chris- .;". 'tianity. It desecrated the home, it polluted the nuptial bed, it lowered the dignity of womanhood', - . it devastated the school, and stopped the progress of science. In fine, neither Protestants nor Greek schismatics have shown that the action, of the Holy Ghost is with them. Their ministère have no lawful mission, and they cannot say that they have been sent by Jesus Christ. ...» .4 Have they (the Protestant denominations) any of > . the marks of the true Church-unity, sanctity, catholicity, and apostolicity? Surely not." * On being interviewed,. Archbishop Redwood . , said:-"I have only to remark that the passages quoted were not spoken by me in the course of my sermon as delivered in the cathedral. They were entirely and purposely omitted in deference to. the presence of the Governors. I was anxious not to introduce any controversial matter on ac count of the mixed character of my audience. But they were included in-the discourse as I had originally written iti and as I would have de- - livered it to a purely Catholic audience in other, - circumstances. I did not think it necessary to take it out of the proof sheets which I handed to the prees. But, as I say, the words complained, of were not uttered hy me in the Cathedral." ... ?*
