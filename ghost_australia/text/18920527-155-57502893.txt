THE SLOWBOB FAMILY GHOST There was no end of excitement at Hollydale when it became known that a gentleman rejoicing in the name of Timothy Slowbob had purchased Cypress Grange. The old house had been empty for many a year. It was once the residence of a wicked old Squire, who mortgaged his estates to the tops of the trees in the carriage drive, drank port until he required an escort to bed, and was nicknamed Nimrod on account of his sporting proclivities. The building, with its many painted gables, moss-grown terraces, and surrounding grounds, and an evil name, and it was not the sort of place a timid person would care to pass on a wild, blustering night, with snow in the air, and the wind shrieking like a pack of banshees. The people of Hollydale all agreed that if Cypress Grange was not haunted, it ought to be, for it had huge panelled rooms, dim and mysterious corridors, galleries with here and there a piece of old armour still remaining upon the walls, and vast cellars, where perhaps in days long past conspirators had whispered plots, or men, women, and children had lain hidden, and trembled as they listened to the thunder of war between Cavalier and Roundhead. So it was just the very happy hunting ground for a good old fashioned ghost, grim, ghastly, and deliciously transparent in the moonlight. Mr. Timothy Slowbob was delighted with the place, and he bought it out of hand, no cxtra charge being made for cobwebs, spiders, rats, and mice. As for the ghost, it might walk if it liked, or keep away. He was perfectly inde. pendent of it, one way or the other, as he had a ghost of his own a real family ghost. He was blessed, among other enviable things. with a handsome wife, a sturdy son and heir, and extremely pretty daughter, and plenty of money. Some people said that he had founded his fortune on pickles others that he had, so to speak, tumbled head first into a mine of precious metal during the Australian gold fever; a few whispered that le had made thousands in a single day on the Stock Exchange; but all agreed that to was a jolly, open-handed, generous, plain-spoken, no- hum bug-about-him gentleman, and that his arrival at Hollydale had practically saved the place. The grocer, baker, and, in fact, all the trades men, except the undertaker (who, by the way, knew more comic songs than anybody in the village, and sung them well, too), received such astounding orders that they met in the village street und shook hands with each other. Speech failed them, and they could do nothing but gasp and grin in their delight It was rather late in December, 1880, when the small army of bricklayers, carpenters, furnishers, etc., turned their backs on Cypress Grange, and made room for the Slowbob family and the servants. The very first thing the new squire did was to frame a programme for the forthcoming holidays. The wants of the poor were to be attended to, the school children to feast their hungry little interiors on good things and their eyes on a Christmas tree, with branches laden with presents, and well, I am almost afraid to tell of the wonderful things put down upon the programme, lest I should not be believed. One bright frosty afternoon saw young Tim Slowbob driving his sister Dinorah to the rail. way station in a waggonette drawn by a pair of dark bays, which could not matched for 300 guineas. It was a smart turn out, and Tim handled the ribbons in it masterly style ; but smartest and prettiest of all was Dinorah, with her checks glowing with health, her dimpled chin making love to a sable boa lucky boa!-her blue eyes dancing, and her tiny feet peeping out-they insisted on peeping out, and would take no denial--from under a large bear-skin rug. " I wonder, Din," said Tim, as he made the whip crack like a pistol-shot, " if they will both come down by the same train ?" To this question Dinorah vouchsafed no reply. It made her thoughtful, and an expression half demure, half mischievous settled on her face. And not without reason, for Captain Herbert Rennon-who had smelt gunpowder with bullets and cannon-balls at the business end of it, and was a perfect fire-eater-had whispered certain tender words in her ear, and repeated them on superfine note-paper embla zoned with crest and monogram. But then Stanley Gilderson had done exactly the same thing, and heigho! it was a choice of two, and the rivals were coming to Hollydale to spend Christmas. There had already arrived one visitor at Cypress Grange-Jack Stanfleld, the son of i 3Ianchester morn, who had. wonrled llhis wvay Ul from orzand boy to millipnaire. Juck vwaes rather matter-of-fact young man about two and twenty years of. ago, and looked the very last one to fall in.love for some time to come. "L tave't time," Ire wollld any w\hen spoken to on the subject. "You cee, my guv'nor insists upon me attending to business, and I have to drive as hard at it as a junior clerk." Jack Stanfield and Mr. Slowbob went out for a rido onr horseback, while Tim nnd his sdetor drove to tho station; and they were back again just as the waggonetto with its distinguished company and heans of lujgage coam clattering through the drive, throwmng up the snow and shaking down the hoar frost liko showers of diamonds, " iHero they are !" cried Timothy Sloweloh, running down the terrace stops. ' Welcomo my noble captain !-welcome Gildereon ! God bless you and us all! Merry ChristmRs! Come in -come in ! What splendid weather for the holidays I Ia, ha, ha !" That laugh was loud and joyous enough to act the church belle ringing out of very sym pathy, and the style in which Timothy Slowr bob shook hands with the young men would have warmed a heart of stoneo. Captain Roenon was a tall, thin man on the wrong side of 30; Stanley Gildersou was his junior by some five years, about the emedium height, dark, and would have beenr good- look. Sig had his nose not boeen a trillo too long for his face. IIto andl the captain travelled down fromo London in separate carriages, and Lad said very little to each other during the exhilarating drive from the station. Neither seemed overpowere I with joy to oee Jaetck Stanfield, who was tall, broadlshouldered, and as ruddy as if he passed his lifo in the ope.. air; and to make matters rather muro comnpli cated, he deliberately lifted Dinoruh out of the waggonette, and ilatced her, with her foot twinkling in the air, on a step swept clean of the snow-whlich was a bold act, and a rather unreaaannble one in a young mail nwho had not the time to listen to Cupid's arguments . The old diningroom teemoni with light and warmth when the party assonl,aleed liter olr, and if there was any cause for complaint, it certainly might have come from the aunmptu. ously-laid table. " I have settled down at last to be a real ola country squire," said Timothy Slowbob, rub. Ling his hands, " and if lfo s grated me, I will play the part well. 1l3as Ine, I carn look back 10 yearo and see myself rcuttling along the foggy streets of Lorndon, witth rny breakfast in one pocteot and my dinner in the other. IIow little I thought then of beinlt master of Cylmres Grangeo or dreamed of anything bettr than a small house and a bit of garden. llet mind you," he added, " I sprang from a gooid tcck.

And that accounts for our fimily ghost." " HIIraw, haw !" laughed Caltain Itcnnon. " D)o you really beliove in ghests ?"' " I don't want to bolievo--I am co:lvinrced," Timerothy Slowbob rejolined.
