THEIR FAVORITE FOOD. There is a fable of German origin which describes the terrible adventures of our flies in search of a breakfast. The first fixed his affections on some tempting jam ; but the jam had been adulterated with copperas, so this fly died from inflammation. The second, thus warned against luxuries, resolved only to eat bread. - But the bread was adulterated with alum, so this fly died from internal cramp. The third, in the hope of drowning his grief for the loss of his companions, betook himself to the edge of the beer jug; but the beer was adulterated with Cocculus indicus , so this fly, too, gave up the ghost, a victim to poison. The fourth fly, seeing the fate of his comrades .decided that life was not worth living, and proceeded to commit suicide on a paper labelled • Fly Poison.’ But the more he ate the better he throve, for the fly poison like everything else, was extensively adultrated, and succeeding generations of flies have adopted it as their only safe food.
