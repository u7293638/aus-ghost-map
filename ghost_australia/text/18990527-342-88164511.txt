SUNDAY WORK AST_) PLAY.' TO THE EDITOR OF THE KALGOOKLIE MINER Sir, — As an . Australian borri and 50 years old, will you allow me to say a few words in your standard paper about the Sunday question, both with regard to working and playing. I have often noticed that this question never crops up on a field until a certain namby pamby class of people arrive who seem to make it their' business to c»rtail as much sporting pleasure on Sundays as possible. They do not those things, and, of course, no ,one else should. Now, where would a country be if it depended for development upon such a class of parsons ? Yet we are ousted out of our places if possible, called low fellows, dangerous men, etc., be cause we .don't happen to believe in miracles and ghost stories. Let it be understood here that there is no class of men more honorable and conscientious in their dealings than pioneer prospectors, and although I belong to this class of men myselt, I am not now boasting. Why then should we be bulldosed out of our Sunday pleasures by kinked visionary agency ? I maintain it is intolerance of the worst sort, and ought to be stamped out this wanting .people to do as I do on Sun days. In respect to working on Sun days, for no other reason than having a rest one day in a week, I would not work on Sunday. — I am, etc, J. SUMMERS. Boulder City, May 23, 1899.
