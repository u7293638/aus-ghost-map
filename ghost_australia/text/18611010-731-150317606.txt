f»OM TBE GHOST OF BAH BAN.l I do not detail to you the dismay . and agony which marked the countenances of tiie Happy Family Party men when they received the inti mation of Sir George Bowen having postponed his visit, any more than I pretend to justify his Excellency for favouring us with an early taste of his vacillating disposition. . - It must be very vexing to ordinary inoitals . who have worked themselves up to meet a stu pendous event, when they find they have done ' so tb Vain:' It must tie 'the essei)Ce^ £xc radia- tion to each men as ' Bertorii'' an4 Mackenzie's Pet to feel that tbeir m asterpieces -rf T»rnd itiori and attempts at something are not to 'burst upon the world at the moment they weralcreat'ed for. You can imagine, then, what are' the present sufferings of thoBe who have had a hand in the 1 composition of the accompanying' address— of j thosewhoexpect so much to arise oat of this vice- ; regal visit — and whose intense anxieties evi dently cannot be maintained very much longer. I should not^likehis Excellency to tikve heard all the opinions expressed about him fiy, those who have felt the disappointment most. 1 am sure their loyalty will revive again in time, and that they will not fail to make themselves most con spicuous. Your readers will at once see from the address who were its composers, :and acknow i..j ? :* . . i ? ? ....... Tl,. gentlemen who were to 'take care' -of it were the best that could be had, and the professional one who is to read it has worn a most extra ordinary complexion ever since he undertook the task. His Excellency will not fail to notice that the Police Magistrate has not honoured it with his signature : — ' '? ' From the Lotai juid Dutiful Imhabitasts, &c.;, &c.;, Ac., — 'We, her Majesty's most loyal subjects, inhabi tants of Gayndah aud the Burnett district, ap-' proach your Excellency in a spirit of reverence' and love, and welcome you to - this.

For the last fortnight few of us havieteen able to secure our wonted midnight rest,' so much have our bosoms responded and bur. systems: vibrated to those feelings which alpne can have prompted you to come hither. We fondly hopo that your Excellency is at this moiueht in good health, that you left your family iinjftying the same; and we pray that nothing ? inay -occur during this eventful visit to nubijate for one second the almost eternal snnshine of pur hap piness and climate.
