QUILPS AND QUERIES FROM AUBURN. By Pato Par. Will our local candidate take top place at the coming election? Reckon Auburn will be advertised if he does. Are the lately acquired working men's blocks to be cut up and allotted in time for the coming seaBon, or are they etill to be OBed as a common grazing ground for any one's cattle and horses ? Is the First Midland about to give up the ghost, or is the rumor true that it is likely to change into a mounted company ? The latter should be the rule if the old older of things is to be carried out. Two years* service pays for uniform. Time to change then; two years more to pay for new uniform, and so on adUb. One would think the army was ran by a company of tailors. What a pity a few of the other prominent buildings in the town do not at the present moment belong to the Government. They might stand a chance of being decently done op in con junction with the present Government building. How long will the Wednesday afternoon half-holiday last ? It all depends on the people trying to help the assistant by pur chasing necessaries for the day before 1 p.m. How many farmers will think it worth their while to form members of projected company to make a three-days' visit to the present garden of South Australia, thereby seeing for themselves what with their help Aubnrn may become? Are the Oddfellows and Foresters afraid to try a picnic at Easter this year ? It not, it would be advantageous to have the posters oat and subscription lists under weigh. Should they throw up the sponge there is hardly a doubt but that some one will take in hand the getting up of sports on that day.
