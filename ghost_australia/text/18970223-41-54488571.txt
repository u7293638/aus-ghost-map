SOUTH AUSTRALIAN CRICKET, TO TB3 EDITOR. Sir— Now is the time to take the bull by the horns. South Australia at the present time is in a very sick state as regards first-class cricket, and she urgently requires some medicine, so to spcaK, to endeavour co restore her to her usual cricketing status. Now, Sir, my prescription is this— As we are on the eve of meeting Victoria I beg of the chosen eleven to unanimously elect Mr. J. J. Lyons or Mr. J. Reedmsn as captain of the team, and then I think, with a little ordinary tact, we shall give- Victoria a . good thrashing.* : Indeed it would be. a pleasure to see South Australia win one match this season, but I am afraid that if Mr. Giffcn is olectod captain we shall not stand a ghost of a chance. And in conclusion considering that wo have shaped so badlv this season I think sixpence is quito sufficient charge for admission to theijroand. . lam, Sir. &c; MEDICINAL.
