Mediatorial Throne, which shall last 'until the day when the spirits of the just made perfect and the number of His elect shall be made complete, and when all who have loved the Lord out of a pure heart fervently, shall partake of the:: blessings of the beatific presence of the Ancient of Days.

True it. was ih&t; the beginning of. the work was but a Bmali;part«)fjbhat which they had under taken, and which, if God;permitted, they hoped to see fulfilled. Having waited 22 years to see that day — having received t»n trust gifts, dona Mpns, sad. subscriptions to a jlarge amount— rhe fejt that $he tioaehad come when ie should give an account of that stewardship, and show: to thepeoplepf this ?prpyince.in connection wi& their ancient and belovfed Church-tiiat he .ljaJcl. not unfaithfully stored the treasures of silver and ^oldwMch; were committed to his un-; worthy keeping. Besides this .there WBareasQn, he thoughtjAtthe presentuepoch_bf the world,: why they should give some manifestation, be it;' great or gnia^tth^,t they wpuld jserve the Lord. This was a time._wi.en they were called upon; as Joshua ^called upon .the Israelites of ?old'-1-''rChppse -ye . this day -whom.: (yakiHSn.':' served as 'for me ' and my . house, . jyeTjwilljserve the Lord.' : In these latter days .an. outburst, of , Eationalistic ^unbelief hail attsinpted' to throw discredit on the Sacred Wopi'bFihe Living God— on that Word which ;was the foundation of all their hopes, their onlyjgtude to. e'ternal.life— and there was great reason why. at this epoch those who -were Ion the /Lord's ; side should come forth and show -outwardly to the' 'heathen and ' unbelieving world that as for them they. would serve God the Father, ^God the Son, and God the Holy, Ghost, ever one: God -Who was before all time and. beyond . all , space. - ?- Therefore with this ^jew.jUiey.weEe there, determined by fheGrace of , Gfld tohandto their rchildren the blessed inheri tance pf & true -Scriptural faith- receivedfrbm Appstojic times by perpetual aucceBsion— and re- : covered by martyrs who by their blood vindicated the truth^of the living God.

England, jand Ihey de eirpd, with all friendly Ghrastian fellowship; as far as they could without sacrifice of principle' or improper compromise, to endeavor by a hply rdevodoDutp show that primitive order was. pot devoid -of life, and jthat they did not depend for ;th'egrace of God simply on this, but on the living faith pf the heart, which led. them up to the; Saviour, and from % the Saviour to the Throne of the' EternaL.-.;!* was. in -nP spirit' ''of:! nnfriendliness .'or tannoly rivalry' that; thev. nlaced that: atone. but- that lit' might, be the; means: of creating ta spirit j of nnity in the Cathedral Church ;of the Diocese,, goithat : the unity there might; be an eableni of the unity which theyJpngedto see among those who differed; only on non-essential points. j_If this«hould be the humble means ; of jpromotjin^ this: great end of unity— not only in the pale pf that Church, but within the pale .of . the- wnole Reformed -Church — then : he said they, would have fseason to Mass God that He had permitted them to -lay that:. stone ia peace, . and to hope that He: would bestow His favor on the under taking.

They all well remembered those hallowed edifices which .for so : many ages, had stood 'monuments of the p^ety of the lEngliflh' people, which, for «o many centuries, had been the Central place of i worship to «o many -miUions^-and which at ^feettresent &ay; were more than ever treasiired byftheeonswf -the Gaarch of England. H«!did adeeply-itegrSttha* thepart of ihecpuntry-with wiich hfei was- more particularly conbected-j-he meaart Bcotland-^-shouid, in these modern times, be so destitute of these institutions, which1 he thought «o valuable. ; But even there they had seen^oi late ho* the Cathedrals were valued, by *he; restorA*iori^ prf-Jthose- wHch^tthe piety of theirforefeShers iiadTeared.

The laying of this foundation-stone was indeed a significant act, and he did earnestly trust .that the building which would rise upon that stone would serve to increase and. .perpetuate religious' truth in the diocese. He hoped it would form the gathering-point for those who differed only on non-essential points. He congratulated His Lordship from his .heart— and he was sure all present joined in the congratulation — (hear, hear)— on having seen that day the commence ment of the realization of his most earnest hope — the first- fruits of so many prayers and exertions. That stone would remain long after His Lordship: .had passed away, - s a memorial of the first chief pastor of the Church in South Australia, and of one who would be .remembered .as long as South Australia lasted. (Cheers.) He would not by any words of his prolong a meeting which had been of the most solemn and interesting character, but let him; express, his /earnest wish that, the, success which hai attended .. that . first act. would ac company the edifice in all its stages of progress —that as -.wall, istately- tower,- and spire; arise they might point with brighter hope to the completion of His ;Lordship's own ^ood .work — that within that, sacred pile rich, and poor in future ages might; together worship before Him who is the maker of them aH and that men of allclasses and pajties, might within those walls .meetj.and find.a common union which should endure .beyond the grave. (Loud applause. J . . . A collection .was then made, after, which cheers were giyeiL for Sir.
