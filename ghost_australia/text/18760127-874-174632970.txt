HOW JIMMY FORBES LOST HIS PRESENTS. JIMMY FOKBEK went down to Belial, and while there His friends all resolved to treat liim kind and fair : So they gave him some presents, both little and big, And the biggest they gave was a beautiful pig. And the smallest lie got was an elegant goose, Of which he intended to make the right use. So Jimmy set sail with the presents he'd got. Jhit a woeful mischance overtook the whole lot — The pig grew seasick, and it grunted and snored, And after a struggle it jumped overboard ; And the goose it got frightened and spread it* wings wide And flew most vexatiously over the tide ; And Jimmy sat down, when he saw them both go. The very exponent of sorrow and woe— And says he. " It's enough to make anyone swear, To lose both the pig and the goose and their fare." And Jimmy declares that the ghost of the goose Flics round him some nights with its legs hanging loose. And he also maintains that he liears the grmit-wail Of his beautiful pig in each son-wester gale.
