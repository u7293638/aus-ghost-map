THE WEDDING NIGHT. WD^SKSOMETIMES-WOTIFERED-WHYMISSST. Sauve&r; had not man-fed. Men never did. Possibly they Wens feWare that she could have married whenever she chose. In this they were right. It Was Glaverhouse's opinion. He at lfcast did not imagine that the offer hit had Just madfe was at all a novel thing tofcfeh Not did she take it as though it were. She hadfctabit ef frowning & little at timer—frown feat brought her fine dark brow* tofettieJ'. She frowned in this -way now While fffitia looked at the young man contemplatively out of her yellow-lrown eyes. " I cannot picture to myself why a man like you diould wish to marry a woman, like me. I am not ductile, not malleable. I have hot the qualities that make a good Wife—tor suchHB you-" Claverhouse shrugged his shoulders. •*0h, ye?. The old story* Meanwhile you do not answer me." " Well, I answer you now. And in a way which, to it degree* surprises myself. Tou want m. tt» aAfty you? I ivili do as Jfou Wish." Kever, surely, was there a stranger courting;.

And for the rest, he loved her. This fact alone filled the horizon for hun, suffused it with a glamor in which all other issues showed shadowily through When news of Glaverhouse's anticipated marriage reached his friends it occasioned a wondering murmur. He had been deemed an eccentric where women were concerned: almost a misogynist. In. inahy other wayt he was unlike other men. AS a boy he had been a dreamer | a» a youth at college he hod been called "Miss Claverhouse" until he one day qtiiettjr knocked down a big fellow in whose mourn the appellation bad most frequently been.

He drew yet a step nearer to her, and she cowered a little. Indifferent, invulnerable, superb, she had found her master, as such women always do. She knew it and he knew it. "Simply this. We can be married now. Tou have come into money recently, too. That makes it easier. Before you had nothing and I had nothing. It would have been hunger espousing thirst, even had there been no other obstacle." She laughed cynically, that trembling through au her limbs increasing every " How magnificently, how nonchalantly you say that. Tou are the sort of man who aot E ? ind H^g on his wife.'

Thence they could go to England. .* * » * The moon had passed her zenith and was westering slowly when Miss St. Sauveur approached once more the long open windows of the house. A tall, slight figure encountered her. You!"she looked at Claverhouse. "I thought you were gone an hour or more ago." " I found that I had forgotten something and returned." k He stood twirling his hat carelessly in his 1 What was it ? I hope you found it." " I did not come back iu vnin—Up." Her bands and lips had grown cold. She leaned toward him tentatively. She had never been lavish with her caresses. Claverhouse's kiss grazed her cheek. The chill passed from her. "Absurd! How could he have seen or heard ? " she said to herself. " Absurd!" * * * * " Disher's de bride!" "No, I guess hit's one of them that waits on her." The dusky faces pressed close together on the outermost fringe of the laWn were accented by wide open eyes and gaping mouths. For miles up and down the river it had become known that a lSige wedding was to take place at Orange Grovs Springs that night. The chocolate- coto«ife4 circles of humanity waited patfebtiy, bfet tefea to its outer limit there p&se;&tly; <&m;&&fiicated; itself a consciottlta&s;, txah t)f fined suggestions in the _ " was amiss. The music pglfnlrtStorily, paused, and began anew. The wMte-robed bridesmaids flitted to and fro. WfeFe was a stir, a growing murmur, in the house— caught np by the house servants and finally percolating to that waiting crowd outeide. The bride was gone t The bride was gone and the groom bad not come. Miss St. Sauveur had cone to her room early in the evening wittt orders that she was not to be disturbed. And Josephine St. Sauveur was not a girl whom, even on such an occasion, people disobeyed. When the hour for the wedding arrived, however, and with it the few guests bidden, her door was knocked at and, no response forthcoming, finally broken open. The room was empty, and on the bed lay the white dress, the white veil. In the dismayed confusion that ensued no one at first observed that Claverhouse, too, should have come by this. But as the wild search for the bride continued without result it burst upon those assembled below that they were congregated together to witness an occurrence strange indeed—a marriage at which neither groom nor bride had appeared. Suddenly a quivering cry rang over the lawn. A small negro boy stood, with goggliiig eyes, the centre or a circle that pressed ever more tightly around him, and strange words were those hfe inJuffed but stainmeringly. One or two of the white people cried at .first that he had seen a ghost.
