Seedlings of Truth. BY PALMER LAW, Woollalira, Sydney, N.S.W. A sermon is but an empty cup, and unless God, tho Holy Ghost, shall fill it with the water of life, thirsty souls will put it to their lips in vain. The rotten tree must. fall. Be watchful over your thoughts, for an evil thought is the father of an evil desire, and an evil desire is the father of an evil deed, and an evil deed may blast your character and your happiness, for this life and the life bereafter. The love of money is one of the death-traps of Satan. Ho wlip lives to Christ, lives in the service of a good Master. [Editor's Note.—A printer's error occurred in Mr. Law's last contribution. The concluding paragraph should read :—If you would sit down to nn everlasting ^banquet, you must sit down to the banquet of Jesus,]
