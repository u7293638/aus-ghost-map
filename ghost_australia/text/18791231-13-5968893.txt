POLITICAL FEELING AT echuca. At the recent sports of the friendly societies at{Tchuca a luncheon was given when speeches of a political bearing were made We take the following report of them from the Echuca and Moama Advertiser - The Chairman (Mr Frederick Ford) remarked that during the last two years there had been many commercial and bank failures and the political state of affairs in Victoria had also helped to bring, them to the present depressed t ORation The berry Administration could be blamed to a great extent for their trouble as the Land Act regulations and red gum duty of 100 per cent a prohibitive duty had worked much injury to this district Before that time they were doing good business in the town but since that every thing had been on the decline and they were now almost on their backs What was the best way out of the difficulty, they were now on the eve of a general election and they wanted another Government in power which would represent all classes of the community He did not believe in a party Government Members of Parliament should represent all classes of the community, for they were all dependent upon each other for mutual supPort off and prosperity We had seen the rise and progress of Victoria and it was only in its infancy as regarded development Echuca was now almost in a state of insolvency and the settlers on the land in the district would have to leave it if they could not get irrigation for they could not cultivate the land without it It was highly necessary that the people in this constituency should see that their representatives were in favour of the great work of irrigation He hoped Messrs Gillies and Fraser would again be their representatives in the Legislative Assembly, and he thought that they should be returned with as little expense as possible. The working men had been great sufferers in consequence of the general depression He was in a position to be aware of that fact and knew that many of the working men con nected with the friendly societies had experienced great difficulty in paying their contributions to keep themselves good on the books Many of them had got so far into debt that they could not get out of it, and the tradesmen could no longer afford to trust them He hoped that in the new Parliament there would be no party legislation but that all classes would be fairly represented (Applause ) The Chairman then proposed the usual loyal toasts, which were drunk in a very hearty manner Mr James Mackintosh (Mayor of Echuca) said that after the exhaustive speech of the chairman there was very little left for him to say He had, however, a toast to propose, which he was sure would be well received, and it was the Sitting Members for Rodney, Messrs Gillies and Fraser (Applause) He endorsed all that had been said by the chairman, and he might say in support of those remarks that he himself two years ago had over 300 men in his employment, and now he had not more than 25 employed Things had gone on well previously, and they had never dreamt that they would have a Government which would not respect v eBted interests They had in their forests a natural valuable product, and a large amount of money had been expended in developing it, and placing it upon the market Now, however, he did not have more than 23 men at work, and this was caused by the rule of the Berry Ministry he knew for a fact that there had been great distress and suffering amongst the working men. Two or three years ago in Echuca they were in a thriving condition, and had bought land at Government land sales at the rule of Â£110 per acre, on which to erect houses for themselves and their families, as there was not a house to be obtained any- where about Echuca at that time Now, however, houses could not be let, and property could hardly be given away They had certainly had two or three dry seasons, but they had had bad seasons before, and they had waded through the worst They would have been able to do the same during the last two years had the Government done justice to all classes What did they find, so far as Rodney w b concerned ' Not only had they not a fair share of the public money expended here, but they had actually been punished because they had returned two Opposition members The time had arrived when Rodney should show itself determined, and help to bring about a change of Ministry. The toast was drunk very enthusiastically Mr S Fraser, M L A , rose to respond, and was greeted with loud applause He said he thanked them cordially for the manner in which they had drunk the toast He had felt so disgusted for a longtime past that he had nottheheartto speak Hehadfeltvery strongly the disgracefully unfair manner in which Rodney had been treated by the Ministry He could therefore sy sympathise with the statements made by the previous speakers A deal of malice had been shown towards Rodney, and it was a lasting disgrace to those in power that it was so, as almost wholesale ruin have been brought upon this district it was fortunate for them that there was a general election close at hand So far as he was personally concerned, it did not matter whether he was returned again or not. He had been on the unpopular side perhaps for some time, but he was certain that now he was on the popular side (Applause) He was certain that better times were in store for them, so far as politics were concerned The action of the Ministry over the redgum duty was monstrous He had entered into a contract for the supply of 100 OOO redgum sleepers for South Australia, and this was no sooner known in Melbourne than the order went forth for the imposition of the duty of 10s per 100 feet, which was more than the value of the timber, and this of course put an end to the contract It was said as an excuse that the forests would soon be exhausted, but they knew better than that The forests were almost inexhaustible, and the redgum timber grew very quickly There had been hard times all over the world lately, but he believed that Victoria had suffered worse than any other place Look at the newspapers, and they would find columns filled with wholesale failures, fl fa sales, and insolvencies without number These things should speak trumpet tongued, and cause the working classes to move from their lethargy. It was time that they did so All personal matters should be sacrificed, so that men might be returned to Parliament who would do them justice no trusted the working men would weigh these things closely, and not be led by the nose by demagogues who had not the interest of the colony at heart A great change was at bond Ten or 12 Ministerial supporters had not the ghost of a chance of being returned, while not a single Opposition beat was unsafe They should, therefore, keep up a good heart for the time was at hand when the Berry Ministry would rule no longer, and the whole colony would feel relieved, as if from some dreadful nightmare. The Hon Duncan Gillies, who was received with enthusiasm, also responded He said it was the duty of members of Parliament to represent not a portion but the whole of their constituents It was perfect farce that a member should represent the majority which returned him Representatives should do the best they could for all their constituents and the colony generally that idea had been ignored of late in Victoria Party Government, which had prevailed, was not government for the people as a whole, but only government for a party Because the representatives of Rodney had exercised their right of doing what they considered proper in Parliament, this appeared to justify the Ministry in inflicting a permanent injury upon the district Nothing could be done to lower a Government more in the eyes of the public generally than such a system as this For if it was the case with respect to Rodney, might it not also be done in any other district There was one point at this period of the history of the colony he wished particularly to refer to They had now a general election right before them, and they must either be prepared to support the Berry Ministry or turn them out of their place It was no use whittling the question down to almost nothing They must know their own minds decisively on this point, or they would helplessly drift from bad to worse If the opinions of their present representatives were not suitable, let them be discarded for better men It was hopeless to expect to do any good if there were men to be found, after what had taken place, who, to any extent, 1 _ r as if-" ","",""f or in he. believed in the present Government, or to be so weak as to divide the party which was now trying to put them out of office They must stand or fall together and present a united front before the enemy He was satisfied that the interests of Victoria were not safe in the keeping of the men now in power If returned he would do his best to turn them out as soon as possible (Applause ) They must have no half-hearted men on the platform to damn the Ministry with faint praise No personal or private feelings ought to prevent them returning men to Parliament who would do them honour and credit (Loud applause ) ___________ A Standard telegram from Constantinople says that the question of the admission of Christiana into the Turkish army has been discussed at a Council of Ministers, and that there was a majority in favour of adopt- ing this measure As a consequence of this decision the children of non Mussulmans will be admitted to the Military School, whence hitherto they have been exceeded,
