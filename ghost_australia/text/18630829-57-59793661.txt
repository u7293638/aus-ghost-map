THEATRICALS ibo. BOYAL VICTOBtA. '/ The performances during tho .early, part of tho week were varied and ol tractive, though not possessing much novelty ) the principal feature of intorost being the re- vival bf *'Medea," in which Mrs Poole played with tile same truth end earnestness which has always character- ised her porsonation of this great-'tragio part. Mr Warner throw Aro and energy into tho part of "Jason," Iiis appearance and sonorous voice being peculiarly adapted to the character. Burford, Walsh, and Mrs Charles Jones effectively contributed to the excellence of tho ensemble A novelty was however produoed on Wednesday consisting of a Uro act comedy entitled, "The Knights of tho Round Table," whioh though taken from tho i'rcncli, has boen so skilfnlly [handled by its adapter, Mr Planche, os to have all the efifeot of genuine British manufacture. The only fault of the piece is that it is too long in portions, and would bo advantageously com- pressed into three acts. The comedy has the advantage of admirable acting, and while we extend our commen- dations to all parties, we would.'particularly pick out Mr Warner, Mr Appleton, and Mr F. Young, wliilo Mrs C. Poole, and Miss F. Young, were equally excellent. In n highly characteristic episode, tho noting of Mr Sam How- ard was a happy specimen of imperturbable sang froid % the easy, gentlemanly stylo in which he chonta the land- lord baing one of the .most offeotivo points in. the piece. Tlie scene itself is capital, and done full justice to by tho actor. The new spectral illusion known as : " Pepper's Ghost," which made, and continues to make, a great sensation in London, and : has recently been brought out with great success at tho Haymarket Theatre, Melbourne, hos been exclusively secured from the patentees for thÂ¡B theatre by Mr Tolano, at a great expense, and will give a " spiritual manifestation" of its presence in a few days, in a drnma expressly adapted to give effect to its ghostly attributes.
