D?s twister's Patient. 7T\R. ERASMUS TWISTER wm K.UH in his consulting-room counting up his fees, when his inuch bc-buttoncd boy . brought him a card . " Ah I Dr. Briggs ie in the waf Mng-rcom ?" asked the greab Twister, after rcaUiog the name. " Yaisrir. "Good! When I sound the gong eliow him in." " Yussir." And the boy of many buttons retired. The well-to-do doctor looked at the card and ehuokled. Ho put away his fees, and I, looked at his watch. He had nothing to do, bnt it would be in very bad teste to let his young rival know that ; so ha kept him trailing in the adjoining room while he : trimmed hie nails, yawned, turned over the pages of an illustrated magazine, and yawned again. Once more he looked at his . watch, and as he had kept his visitor wait- and taking a sheet of paper began to wruea prescription. Battens introduced Dr. Briggs— a young . man ef thirty or thereabouts, tbtn, anxious, ' with carefully-brushed clothes of professional ' cub, a little worn and shiny here and there. /Good morning, Mr.— Ah— " "Brigga." Mr. . Brings, to bo sure. Kindly tako a coat— I shall be disengaged in one iniuute." " Don't hurry on my account, I beg." "Thank you. Hum— yes— ah— just so." And then the elder doctor put away his paper, and turning his chair round faced his visitor with the most flffabteeraile, and said, "And now, Mr. Briggs, how ore we this morning ? How are we getting on with our new practice, hey ? Lots of patients— lots of fees— rising man-.-brilliant prospects, bey !" "No, sir. Up to the present time I have not taken a single fee. Jones, who sold me the practice, cheated me, sir. I trusted his worn, and I have been shamefully deceived." "I'm very grieved to hear this. Tub tub! very distressing indeed. And you have a wife and u young family— two or .ibree children, Mr. Briggs ?" "Three, sir. My wife's money and my own are sunn jn cms practice, anu ine con- ' otant anxiety and disappointment are break ing our hearts, sir— slowly." "Dear, dear. Very shocking, to be sure. What, not one patient t" The doctor tried to -.look as if he' regretted his brother practl- ' . . (loner's 111 fortune. ; " One only, sir, and it is not certain that I . shall get anythlng out of that one, without your assistance." " Anything, in reason, that I can do you may be sure 1 sbattdo willingly. Anything— In reason." " 1 will explain it to you," said Dr. Briggs, and after a pause he proceeded with some embarrassment—" the case is a peculiar one. I am commissioned to find an authorised medical man to act with me in certifying the \- insanity, of a young woman, whose parents desire to place ber in a lunatio asylum." Mr. Briggs dropped his eyes to the floor; Dr. Twister regarded him with a glance of . suspicion. "Nothing can be more simple, my dear Mr. Briggs, aijd I shall Have great pleasure In acting with you il I find that the young woman you speak of w insane— and of course you would not make such a proposal to me unless you were porfectly convinced of the 1HVI> rUUIBOIl. "That ia the difficulty, sir," eaid Dr. Briggs. "The young woman Is perfectly . reasonable on every point save one ; and on that she is as-mnd ns can b' She insists that her fatherand mother are.conspiring to put her in an asylum in order that they may get the handling of n largo sum of money— ' some fifteen or twenty thousand pounds— which becomes here at the age ox twenty- . on®-" "Is It a fact that she is heiress to that fortune?" " Her father and mother strenuously deny . it. They declare she has no money and never will have." " Do you beliove the daughter is mad?" asked Dr. Twister, fixing his eyes on the unfortunate and needy young practitioner. Dr. Briggs shifted uneasily on his chair under this scrutiny, and replied evasively — " In the absence of proof to show that the father and mother are liurs I am bound to believe them ; and, believing them, I can only regard the glrl'e assertion as a proof of ' insanity." " Very true." Dr. Twister was far too prudent a doctor to let his tuepicions be seen.' "Unfortunately," said Dr. Briggs, "unfor tunately the appearance of tbo parents is gainst them." " How, my young friend ?" "In confidenco I must inform you, sir, \- that Mr. and Mrs. Barker— that is their name — are the- most villainous-looking couple' I have overseen. One would be inolined to believe the daughter rather than the parents— If one allowed oneself to bo prejudiced by appearances." " Of course, appearances in many cases \- are deceiving. Miss Barker Is net repul sive?" " Not at a!L She is plain, but her con dition 'excites compassion. She is young, -and she is emotional. I admit that nine out of ten doctors would sympathise with ber. . . and agree that ber parents were conspiriog infamouely to destroy her for their own base ends. I admit, sir, that I hesitated to accept the commission offered me, and that I should " fear resentment from any doctor but you, who know my position, and bow necessary a patient Is to my existence. I knew that at least I might depend upon yonr Impartial consideration af the case if I laid it before . jrou." . "Yon did quite right. I shall be at liberty to-morrow afternoon, and we will go \- - together and see Miss Barker. Depend upon I. |t, I will consider ber case with strict impar tiality." Sir. Twister sounded the gong and rose. Dr. Brigge expressed profuse thanks. , "Two o'clock — afternoon — to-morrow," aid Dr.' Twister, 'smiling blandly, as Dr. ySriggs, fumbling with his hat, bowed him- elfoui of the room. "Hm I" said Dr. Twister, when he was lone. - "This will about finish my pre- umptious young rival 1 If, as I expect, I find that he is trying to shut up a poor girl In an asylum, my lady patients shall know It, and tbere'U be an end of any eympatby with my young friend, Dr. Briggs." At two o'clock the following day the two doctors repaired in Dr. Twister's "pill- box " to the outskirts of the town where the XiarKcra uvea. 4-uey svapueu uciure mc. great iron gates of a ragged, uncultivated garden, which surrounded a dilapidated and long uninhabited house. A murder had ' been committed in the house, and the ghost ' : af the murdered individual waa eaid to baunt ; ' the place. For this reason, or because of its particularly gloomy and dismal appear ance, the house had been to let for five years. If Miss Barker was not actually mad, incarceration in snch a prison would be likely to make her so. This was thetbou£ht that passed through Dr. Twister's mind !" '» m helookod through the gates and across the weedy space at the weather-stained v'tV house with its curtainleos windows. A high .wall skirted the grounds; the gates were locked. Dr. Briggs pulled the piece of string that communicated with the- bell; tho bell v answered with a note Uke a funeral knell. A bent woman, with ragged gray hair, and a coloured handkerchief bound over one eye, came from the house. " Mrs. Barker," whispered Dr. Briggs. "Hm. Husband's been beating ber, I T'Tdon't know. Hm »y» »« all right Oh'i. you, is itt" .aid Mrs. Barker, itaine Dr. Bripgs, and then .lie slow v anlocked the gate, and took cam to relock ftflxa jii9 &g; jjjjttiri bad fMicdthtougb, c "la Mr, Borker at home?" »ekej Jh.f Bri«".. ' " Yes. TouTl find liitn m the fronfc i'OOlii. I'm a doing a bit o' washing." .Bhe -pointed! to a tow of ragged stockings and y»b»rie! dangling on a line atrotchejl bobwepp itwpl stunted trees. "Sol won't trouble indoors if you can find your way." | "lean find my way j>erfectly well,"nidl Dr. Briggs; ana lie lod JJr. Twister "pp;t|io stops, across the unswept ball, and. ipto-the' front room. Three chairs and a .dcaLtabl# constituted ths furniture. A pewtor,po> and a clay pipo lay upon the tapie.awUp one of the chairs sat a man jn jiis rflltri, eleevcs sleeping, with his chin en his ibreast- !

"I suppose you would .like toeee.Mariha;''' said he, whon these personal attentions?#, completed. "Of course; and the aooner the: bettor, if you plcoee," said Dr. twister, Huxjee-j tically. " I m 'blceged for to kcep;her locked .up, In case ehe ehould break out veilept, dloii-tl ye know," eaid Mr. Barker, taking itbe Jtpy off a nail in the waU. He led the way upstairs, unlocked a door, and, throwing .it open, .reveled -hie daughter. < She wae a pale, thin girl, ver/;fteatlynd simply dressed j ah# sat by fcheopon-windpiv,; which overlooked a brickfield, And iliod#! book in her hand. I Dr. Twister regarded her for twp;mim>te# in silence, and then turning tp .Mr, Dxk# and Dr. Briggs, he said, very cpldlv- "I wish to make my -examination .in private. Allow me to cloee tho door'IThi# he did, leaving Mr. Barker and Dr. B.riggs on tbe outer side. Dr. Twister was closeted with Rarttfir far a. Iont» time. i "I cannot form an opinion As-Jptbo atctej of Mise Barker's mind until l.liAve aoep-ber several times," said he to .Mr Barker, '"il1 shall call again About thie hour to-roorrpw I Ia the meantime, you .muet£ive:bei>£ much liberty ae ehe requires, that j.may-seeiif:t|iAt diminishes the hallucination— if jiAllpcina-i tiou it bo— under which eh at piownt, suffers.

Tho doctor made a sbort bpw, jtod .-retired with Dr. Briggs. "My young friend," said J)r. Twister, when they were seated in tho broughjil, " this ie one of the dearest attempt :dt fraud which ever came under .my.iiQtipp-Jl And were it not for considorationpf yPMr, Innocent wife and children, X aiippldi denounce you at-once as a par.ticlpo.tqrdp this most infamous conspiracy. - j "Ob, my dear air, X beg you JtO Bftve mercy on my poor wife, md tofhink /pf:myj desperate situation."

Dr. Twister made .half-a-dozen -.visits Xp Mies Barker. Then he jnadc a proposal &>. Mr. Barker. He undertook to take charge efMies Barker for twelve montiis free expense. But as Martha would be in six months, her father emphatically .refused i to accept tho offer. "She is my -daughter;"! said he, ." and ehe don't Jeve .me until enters a proper asylum. Not she " SCbjen Dr. Twister made a xtrpng.resolve. j I "Mr. Brigge," said he, after paying. 1 seventh visit to Miss Barker, "J am.resplved! to save that girl at any cost, and f .make rPP? hesitation of discloaing.xny plan toypu, >s jX\ can punish you at any moment by.roveallng your part 10 this nefarious scheme if -ypu attempt to thwart, orifyou.refnsp touiAk my project." j " I am in your hands, sir, and my conduct will prove my gratitude better .than ?ny' words." j "Good. Now, I have arranged ,witb:Miv Barker— whom I find to be a young .womap of decent education, of good .feeling, ppd.pp>' unnleasing appearance— to escape .from ibprj father's custody. Further, X havp obtained a license and shall make her .my wife. To-night, bv means of a Udder, J shall her off, ana to-morrow I shall havp aJegalj right to protect her, and eave her.fprtppp from falling into the hands of that scoundrel her father.

' rival with the expressions of his gratitude, and called Heaven to aid thp sucoessfjil carrying out of the great SXr. humane scheme. j Dr. Twister carried off .Martlta Barker and made hor his wife. He was. in -constant communication with Dr. Briggs and .bis, patients, and finding that everything was going on as well as could be -wished, .hp, extended tbe length of his honeymoon.; Ipdeed, with a wife wbo would soon be. in; legal possession of eighteen thousand pounds he could afford to neglect his practlpe.-aod take that holiday which he' had ,jp ilppg denied himself. He found his wife .a very, agreeable woman, and had no .reason -fpi repent his marriage until towards the ond -p f the month, when his wifoexhibitcd symptoms' of a most alarming kind. She said she :felt much better. The change had dope her. good; and she began to doubt the truth pf that statement she had .made ip .herillpesf. In fact, sire felt spre tliat her dear ".Kaa-y " need not trouble himself to send :fpr .lawyer to investigate her case and seok her missing aunt, for she was positively certain thatah bad no rich aunt, and that her supyositiop>s to tho inheritance was but n idle ;faney, which would not longer trouble .ber ppl v. that she was ecHUd aud b i >f tit. i>« ;!wrt d|I 1 llrtMl t\i.
