THE NUMBER SEVEN. Seven is composed of the two first per- fect numbers, equal and unequal—three and four ; for the number two consisting of repeated unity, which is no number, is not perfect ; it comprehends the primary nu- merical triangle, or trine, and is square or quartile ; conjunctions considered by the favourers of planetary influence as of the most benign aspect. In six days creation was perfected, the 7th was consecrated to rest. On the 7th of the 7th month a holy observance was or- dained to the Chaldees of Israel, who fast- ed 7 days and remained 7 days in tents— the 7th year was directed to be a sabbath of rest for all things ; and at the end of 7 times 7 years commenced the grand Jubi— lee—every 7th year the land lay fallow ; every 7th year there was a general release from all debts, and all bondsmen were set free. From this law may have originated the custom of our binding young men to 7 year's apprenticeship, and of punishing incorrigible offenders, by transportation for 7, twice 7, or three times 7 years—every 7th year the law was directed to be read to the people—Jacob served 7 years for the possession of Rachel, and also another 7 years—Noah had 7 days' warning of the flood, and was commanded to take the fowls of the air into the Ark by 7, and the clean beasts by seven. The Ark touched the ground on the 7th month ; and in 7 days a dove was sent ; and again in 7 after. The 7 years of plenty and the 7 years of famine were foretold in Pharaoh's dream, by the 7 fat and the 7 lean beasts ; and the 7 ears of full, and the 7 ears of blasted corn— Nebuchadnezzar was 7 years a beast, and the fiery furnace was heated 7 times hotter to receive Shadrach, Meschech, and Abed- nego. The young of animals were to re- main with the dam 7 days, and at the close of the 7th to be taken away. By the old law, a man was commanded to forgive his offending brother 7 times ; but the meek- ness of the last revealed religion extended his humility and forbearance to 70 times 7. " If Cain shall be revenged 7 fold, truly Lamech 70 times 7." In the destruction of Jericho 7 priests had 7 trumpets 7 days.
