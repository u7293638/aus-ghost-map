SCURIo US CALL: [A snm w:ell-furnished drawiig-room in Maffair. Katherine Rochester, cl ' devdn Wife of George Rochester, is S.seated aloane before the fire on a win ter's a ernoon.] . Katherine- . (musing): So it's just a year since. .I severed my matrimonial bonds, han got rid of my husband for ever! How time flies! It doesn't seem a year since I became a widow. Nay, I'm not that: what am I then? Surely neither fish, flesh, nor fowl; an ambig ious position indeed! Perhaps I was foolish to appeal to the law for my re lease, but' L did it in a fit of temper, and must abide by the decision. Oh, I had great- provocation! It wasn't so much his littlts peccadilioes-I could have con doned theim n- time.", perhaps; wise wi',s-somietimes must, and I was so much older tirtn he was. No. It was the abominable oay in which Ihe deserted me-ns' gQes': the phraise--that really broutght matters to a crisis./ Leaving me alone,we&kr; after week, month after month, tol-do What-I liked. spend what money I pleased-though, to be sure, it was all my own-without even writing a line to ask if I were dead or alive. Stay, I'm wrong; he did telegraph once from Norway to me: "Please send photo; almost, forgotten what you're like." Monstrous! and so ungrateful, too, when all the time I was making him such a liberal allowance. I ought to have stopped it, but I hoped my pal try generosity might bring hinm to his senses-soften him, perhaps-but it didn't; and I never saw him for two whole years until that morning in court -and then I wished I hadu't done it, lint it was too l:ite. Some of my- inr ried friends used to envy mne rather told me I was a lutcLk woman. and a fool to make a fu s. But I umarried for rompantonshlp. I wanted someone to talk at-I mean to talk to; sometone to luss when I didn't feel well. Nerves? Of course I've got nerves, and then he said I matle scenes. and drove him from his home. If I have a sensitive nature, he should have siothed. not irritated me; sat- with mny land in his, stroked my hair.'listened to all I had to say without answering;hunmiored me; coax ed tilme, Istead of rushlugn out of the house and slamming the hall door after him. That wasn't tile way to treat me! Yet not such a bad fellow, after all. G(;c-looking, young, cheery, easy going-=tha? was It-too easy, going everywhere without me. Bt . I've punished hilm-at least. I hope I have. His pocket must feel the difference, if his heart doesn't. I'wonder what has become of him? Alwaiys abroad. I sup pose. I'm not likely to hear much more about him. I never see any of his friends-they don't seem to call - no odly seems to call much-now. (Yawn ing.) It's dull work having only the servants to scold. (A servant appears earrying a small salver on which lies a Visiting card). Servant: A lady wishes to see yot, Ina'am. Katherine U. (brightening up): Tialtl, goodness for some one! (Sharuply.) Well, where is she? .'Whlit have you done with her?.: Servant: .. Here -is thli lady card, na'anm. She wouldn't tcome p until she knew if you-would see her. Katherine ItR.: Dear me. what a mystery! (Reads the' card.) "Mrs George Rochester." What's tils? A joke, or my ghost? (Suddenly illumi nated.) The wreteh has nmrried again -this is his new wife ! Servant (impassively): Shall I show the lady up. ma'am? Katherine R.: Certainly not - stay yes, I will see her. (St~ant disap peas.) I must see what she s like. How do I look? I'm sure my no 'e is red. (Takes up a hamlu-mirrolr.. eats a powder-puff from her po down the acerbitiesof "' But to come here - I dechini irdly decent: what can she want I only hope I shall be able to keep toy tongue under control. a (Servant reappears, and (alnounces "Mrs Rochester." The regnant Mrs Rochester- Mabel by name - advances shyly.) Mabel R. (timidly): Mrs Rochester, I believe? :Katherine R.: That is-that was (de liantly). Of course, that is my name. (To herself): Why, she's a mere girl, and how lovely! Mabel R. (nervously): You. know who I atm? (Katherine RIt. flicks the card affirmatively.)

Katherine IIR. (aggressively Why not say "our" husband at once? By the way,- how long have you been married' Mabel R.: Two months. We'havejust come back from (blushing again) our honeymloon. Katherine R. (ironically) : Together. Mabel R. (surprised)': Why, yes. We are always together. Katherine R. ; He never leaves you alone-for hours ? Mabel R. ; Oh, no. He wouldn't dream of such a thing. Katherine R. (between her' teeth) Walt ! (Aloud) But, really,-I fall.to see how these accounts of bridal bliss can possibly interest:ihe? . M1abel R.

B(grimly) You do, txi: deed ! - - -Mabel.. : That's just It, and so-- (hesitates). Katherine R.: And so you harq called upon me to ask for the character of George .Rochester (deprecating move ment of Mlabel). Oh, pray don't napolo gise!-it was very prudent of yon to do so. Forewarned is forearmed. Well. as he canvasses me as he would a servant, I will do the same by hiim. I believe himU to be perfectly honest, clea'?, and generally sober. These are the! ques tions I am bound to answer, are they not? Passe encore (rising as shiconti nues) : And now, supposinlg in aOdition I told you that your husband Irfers the society of othler women to tat of his own wife; thant he is indlitetlut to her welfare, careless of her happitess ; that whlen sihe is ill antid dlepressed he i inconsiderately cheerful ; when (he is nervous, he is noisy; when she lecures, he Inullghs: when she weeps, hie whistles -(warmlling to her topic)--that .when she wants one thing, hle nwants anther; t when she says "don't," he says "shk:ll;" t when she says 'won't," hie says "will" -that he cannot bear the slightest con- t tradletion-that he..bsolutely, insists upon.belng master in his own house, upon giving his orders, having,hils way, and if his wife attempts to argue ?-ith him--to thwart him-to assert her Inde pendency of thought and action, that lie goes off, and leaves her to herself ''or two whole years. What would you say if I told you that? (Pulls up breath less.) r Mabel It. (somewhat overwhelmed by this avalanche of verbiage) : Why really!I think-I should say it was the fault of his wife. Katherine R. (taken aback): What? (To herself): She means to insult ue ; but I will hear her out. (Aloud, resent. ing hersef)i Now, I ain ready tO listen to you. Mabel R.: I won't detain you very long. I have made a list of the ques tions I should'like to a-k~iou viill be quite candid with me? -on't you? (Pro duces a dainty littlecaa:net- froml her muff.)
