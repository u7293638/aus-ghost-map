MAJUBA AND'IMP ATI. When the wild Boar faced the Lion On red Impatl's height, He showed his task to terrorise The Lion In the fight. ' His tusks were long, his tusks were strong The Mauser tusks-and they were sent to him to read and limb The Lion in the fray. Right valiantly the wild Boar fought Behind his native wall The rooks and ranges of the land ; But when our bugle call Sent the Fusiliers and Leicestershire With teeth that never fall The bayonets keen-the Boar was soon To show not tusks, but tall. For when our soldiers stormed the ridge That marks Impnti's crown, The Boar in the traitor turned The fatal hillside down. But his horse had sped from the valley's bed, And he turned him once again ; in his headlong flight he turned to fight, Like a wild beast in his pain. Then echoed from the sounding hill The battle bugle's blast. i Charge I Cavalry of England, charge ! And furious and fast, Like a flash of flame to the valley cargo The British mounted men, And they painted red their swords, and fed Mnjuba's memory than. The Boar who'd used a bully's boast He'd make the Lion flee Like an eland frighted In his flight, And drive him to the sea Formed a rabble host, despite the boast Of the wish that turned the will He was driven then by the breed of men Trapped on Majuba Hill, The swords flashed in, and the swords flashed out, Nor guard nor parry rang ; it was cut-and-thrust till they bit the dust, While the hot blood soothed and sang. Our men were glad with a joy made mud By a long remembered vow ; They could see the bones whose grey tomb- stones Jui from Mnjuba's brow. The call of kindred filled their ears, And red ghosts lined the height, While fancy heard the dead men's cheers Nerving them on to fight. And no living men-so they tell our pen Could call up such dust to kill As Mnjuba's dead clad In bloodstained red On dread Impatl Hill. GEORGE MATSON. Port Adelaide, October 21.
