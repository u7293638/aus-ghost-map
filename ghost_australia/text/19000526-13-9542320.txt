CINDERELLA of By S. E. CROCKETT. ] CHAPTER I. HESTER STIRLING'S DEAR COUSINS. Hopefully dawned the morning of the 21st of August, 18-, in the little eager beating heart of Ureter Stirling Usually she slept on till from the grieve's house she heard the horn blow for breakfast Or she struggled into consciousness as the horses came clattering homeward from their morning spell of work and was only fully awake when Megsj TLiperhn herself entered With her said Good morning, Miss Hetta ' Then she watched Me By by a pile of neatly folded clothes on a chair, and go to the window to draw the heavy curtain But this morning Hester had seen the earliest rocks rise clamorous from beneath the black umbrellas of the tall trees beyond the shrubbery She had opened her window, and looked out, when the sky was only a bath of cool, grey mist, and no man was yet abroad For, long-expected, vehemently-desired her cousins were coming from the city, all four of them, Ethel and Vic, and Claudia girls older than herself, and with them (quantity dehcioUBly unknown!) a boy a real boy in trousers, Thomas Alistair Tor pinches, of whom ever since she could remember Hester had thought as the brow est, noblest, and altogether most exalted being in the world From the time when Megsy Tipperlm still carried her over the burns and up the steep DHCCS ' Tom had shone steady as a star in the tremulous imaginative, eager heart of the little girl And to-day at last she was to see them in the flesh "The child is not a pretty child She is brown st ironed like her father and has her mother a wide mouth" This was the dictum spoken authoritatively by Vesta s faint as, suddenly grown I shy and awkward that trembling mile stood clutching a corner of her skin pim fore with one hand, while the forefinger of the other went up rustically to the maligned mouth as if to accentuate its width I then as Hester stood a moment, her heart beating wildly within her, her eyes gypsy dark and gleaming, the tall ma septic lady took up the burden of her prophecy ' Mother, you spoil the girl indeed you do I said so to Sylvanus my husband, only this morning Where is Sylvanus' Oh, he has been detained by in important case He will follow trame dintel) !" Then, turning again to Hester Stirling she continued, "Girl, what is your name' What, no answer Do you not hear me speak? And why do you not come and kiss your cousins prettily have YOU never been taught so much as that' Ah, this comes of indulging a child for the sake of a good for nothing father In my opinion that parable of the Prodigal Son has done more harm than all the romances and improper literature, that are all too common even in homes which call themselves Christian was saying so to Sylvanus only his morning Oh, Your name is Hester, is it' Hester Sjbilh Stilling-well, let me see you how prettily and kiss your cousins" Hester did as she was bid, but with a Banking at her heart and a sense of being thrown emptied on her own resources She wanted her grandmother's rustling black silk gown to cling to or even the corner of Mcgsy Tipperhn's stuff apron would have been grateful though that always felt like dry sand between the finger and thumb But the cool parlour of Anohnd seemed so wide about her It made her little legs quite Lottery And her cousins were so tall, and stood up so stiffly, Rhe thought with hopeless nwe how good they must be and how well taught and obedient to their mother Nevertheless she went steadily over to five, the eldest, who in a careless and almost contemptuous manner held down her cheek to her cousin, with the contempt of city fifteen for rustic Even then she passed on to Vic, who tried to trap Ilfslei up by thrusting a foot out suddenly in front of her "I must have been mistaken." thought Hester, "she would never do that she is too well brought up" Nevertheless, she liked Vic better because she did not even pretend that she wanted to kiss her But Candia, the youngest of all behaved quite differently She took Hester about the neck and kissed her on the brow, keeping it the same time an eye upon her mother to see that she noticed She did notice "Ah, that is my own sw ec cot child, ' cried Mrs Sylvanus 'lorphican "Mother, did you see' that child is a wonder, little more than eleven years of age, and already a member of ten societies the Association for 1 ceding sparrows in third Winters HUB quite grateful to Claudia last year They gave her a model The dear lamb col looted subscriptions from all the farmers in the neighbourhood where we went in summer A few were rude, but eventually all contributed something Claudia simply would not go away without She is quite an example to all Die neighbourhood Is she not, Ethel dear'' Ethel appeared to be immersed in a brown study, and did not hear her mother Suddenly there came a sharp little cry of pain which rang through the p Flour of England, and was heard even of Megs) Tip perth on the stairs as she was coming up with a tray of cleaned silver "Oh, you hurt'" It was the voice of Hester Stirling Her cousin Vic, watching her opportunity, had given the wistfully hesitant little figure a great push against her brother Tom, who. on his part, instantly boxed her cart and then stood with arms innocently at his side ready for the turning round of his mother and grandmother He had been at school two years, and was quite clever at that sort of thing "What is the matter'" cried Heaters grandmother, who was busy with the tea cups ' I hope you did not hurt your selves " "Oh no, it was only that little Hester, who was stupid, grandma," explained Llhel Torpluchnn, she stumbled ovcrtheheaith rug, and then pretended Vie had pushed her down I never did, you know," said Vic stoutly "Of course not, my dears, of course not," Mrs Toinhichan chimed in from the other side of the room, 'well bred children are incapable of such conduct Are they not, Claudia' Does not Miles Martinet often say so'" Yes, minima," said Claudia, who in swered exactly like a clever mechanical doll whenever her mother put a question to her "You did not see anything of this, Claudia'" "No, mamma, no, indeed, mamma Vic toria never so much as touched the girl, little country HILL " The teirB IOHO to the eager gips) eyes, making the darkness in them glitter, and a great day said) lump rose and hurt in her throat Yet neither broke But oh, the aching disappointment, the sharp tooth of pim eating into that small heart which belt under the white pinafore No mere man can tell of these For none can remember all the surprised agony when a child's dream is torn into shreds, when a detached idol is thrown down from its pedestal, and lies shattered before his very eyes ' Now, children, ran and play," said Mrs Syhnnus lorphichin, lifting her finger impressively, and always remember Who sees you You know Who that is, don't you i'' Yes, mamma!" the three girls said in dccoroiiR chorus Vic nudged Tom with her elbow when her mother was not looking 'J oin giggled audibly 'Who laughed when I spoke just now" said the lady, turning rapidly about as if she worked on a pivot All four lorphiohnns were instantly united flicA Mid nothing indeed, but only gazed solemnly and reproachfully at Hester, who stood like a culprit, her knees trembling under her She longed to run to her grandmother, and say "Oh please send them away I went just you and Jlcgsv Tippcrlm"' But her grandmother was a little deaf, and also she was greatly fluttered and excited by the coming of her only daughter whose luiHb and had become so great an Abcrenirn physician-some said he would be a professor one day, but that was per linens, too much honour to he hoped for in this world Very sedately and with their set eyes on the carpet, their my hands clasped before them a little above the waist, and their thirty tons carefully carried out, the three RIIIH departed, while John milked in the oiling of a. tug to get a chance to pinch Vie as she passed Their mother gazed admiringly after them and pointed out to Mrs Stilling their manner of leaving a room That is solely due to my Instruction," she said, "and, perhaps, a little to being sent early to Miss Mnrtinett's school-m Rutland square, yon know, mother, white onl> children of the nobility and gentry are allowed The religious instruction is
