; ECHOES OF MELBOURNE (By The Ghost.) ; It is decidedly to the credit of the Aus tralian Natives' Association, throughout the rcolony' that, they have,' in' regard to..' the proposed cession of the ; New Hebrides ' to France, taken tho stand they have. They . have shown themselves worthy scions of thenpble stock whence theyhave sprung. At ' the numerous meetings held under their ' auspices, Young Australia spoke with no ' bated breath or whispering humbleness,' and the utterances . of the speakers had about1 thein the true ring of patriotism ? which gives assurance that the destinies of this, growing empire in the Southern Seas, are safe in the hands, of the present ' generation : of the .native born population. ' Just as' it is the last straw that breaks the ' earners; back, so ' perhaps will the latest ' protest sent to Lord Grahville from tho sons ' of Australia's soil penetrate the apparently .'. hbn-receptive brains of the Colonial and Foreign , . Secretaries, and induce those slowly. - comprehending . gentlemen to remember that '-'England' does not consist entirely of the ' small islands between the' four seas,; put that tnere is 'a ureater.

The demonstration of this fact in regard to ' Warrnambool, Portland, and Belfast was 'no, 'doubt ..undertakea'at |the;instig'ktibri of ,tHe.gallant naval pfiicer ; the head'pf the Australian squg,dr.ph. ' It ! is. no 'secret 'that the. late meeting of , Premiers,' convened in Sydney by' Admiral ?Tryon, was assembled for the purpose of jihducingtho colonies to share tho cost .of maintaining an Imperial fleet in these waters, . in the ovent of , the mother country becoming involved in a contest with any. of tho European powers. Looked at in thislight, the bombardment of our portB on tho ? south coast has. a certain amount of Value. If, however, .tho demon stration of our gunboats was not under taken with the view of inducing tho colony to fall in with the defohco; policy of the gallant admiral, it was most undoubtedly a mistake. Although our out ports are un defended, it is hardly requisite that we should publish tho fact to the ? world. There is little chivalry in modern warfare, and an enemy would most certainly select as most fit for attack the most vulnerable places, and tho knowledge that the damage inflicted upon them would be made good at the expense of;the /whole of the Austral asian colonies wouldj after all.be. a ;very, poor satisfaction' to the people of ourout lying seaport towns for having their homes knocked about - their ?? ears by » hostile onii?«ir.; '? ?
