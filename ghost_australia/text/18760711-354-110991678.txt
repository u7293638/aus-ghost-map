Air. i Raby was an inexhaustible repertory of ghost storirs and popular legends. But I seleotone that was told by Mr. Coventry, and told with a certain easy grace that gave it no little in terest.1 . ; - - ?? 'v , Mb. Coventry's Tale. ...'?? When I was quite a ohild^there was a very old woman living in oiu*' village, that used to frighten liio with her goggle eyes, and muttering. She passed for a witch I think ; and When' 'she died — I was eight years old then— old people put their heads together, ..and told atrango stories about her early life. Itseoms that this Molly Slater was away in service at Bollingtou, a village halfway be tween' our place and Hillsborough, and her fellnwrHervan'ts used to quiz her because she had no sweetheart. At last, she told them to wait till next Hillsboro' fair, and they should see. And, just before '? the fair, she. reminded them of- their sneers, and Raid she should not come home without a sweetheart, though she took the Evil One himself. For all thht she did leave the fair alone. ' But, as she trudged home- in the dark, a man overtook her and made acquaintance with her. '1;He was a pleasant fellow, and told her his name was William JBiston. Of course she could not nee his face very well, bub he had a wonderfully sweet voice. After that night he nsec to court her, and sing to her, but always lifter dark, He never would face a oundlu though be was challenged to more than once.: One night there was a ter rible noise hoard,1 — it 'is described as if a number of men were threshing out corn upon the roof— and Molly Sinter was found wedged in between the bod and the wall, in a place wnere there wasBcarcely room to put your hand.. Several strong men tried to extricate her by -force ; but both the bed and the wo. man resisted ao aUwngely that, at last, they thought it-best to send for the paraon. He was a great scholar, and himself under suspi cion of knowing more than it would be good for any p'ei'son'lesi pious ' to know. Well, the person came, and tonka candle that was burning and held il to the place where Molly was imprisoned, and moaning ; and they say he turned pale nnd Bhivered for all his learn ing. I forget what he said or did next ; bub by-and-by there was a colloquy between him and some person unseen ; and they say that this unseen whisper was very, sweet, and something like the chords of a harp, only low and very articulate. The parson whupciud ?God gives a sinner time'' The sweet voice answered, ' He can afford to ; he is the stron ger.. Then the parson adjured the unseen one to wait a year and a day. Bat he re fusod, still in the gentlest voice. Then the pareoa said these words : By all we love ' nnd Tear, by all you fear aad hate, I adjure you to loose her, or wait till next Curistmasovp.' . 'I suppose the Evil spirit saw some trap in that proposal, for he is said to havo laughed most musically, Hejauawered, 'By all I 'fear an-i .hate, I'll loose her never; but, I'll wait for her — till the candle's burnt out;' and he chuckled most musically again. 'Then wait to all eternity,' the parson roared ; and blew the candle out directly, and held it., with his bands crossed over it. . Grace Cardeii'8 oyea sparkled in the fire light. ' Go on,' she cried excitedly. ? ' The girl was loosed earily enough after that; but she was found to be in a swoon; and not the least bruised, though ten villa gers had been pulling at her one after ano ther.' ? \- ' And what became of her afterwards f ' : ' She lived to be aixty-niue, and died in my time. 1 think she had money left her. But she never married ; and, when she was old, she wandered about the lanes, muttering, and frightening little boys, myself among the num ber. But now my story follows another actor, of the tale,' . ^ * '' Oh, I'm so glad it is riot over.' ; 'No. ; The parson took the candle, away, nnd it was not seen again. But, somehow, it gut wind that he had built it into the ? walls of the church I perhaps he didn't say go, but was only understood to say, so. . However, ipeople used too look round the church, for the placfi. And now comes the most remarkable thing of all ; three years ago the present rector 'repaired the floor of the chancel, intending to put down encaustic tiles. Much to his sur piiaf, the* workmen found plenty of old en caustic tiles; they hud beeen interred as rubbish at Borne period, when, antiquity and beauty were less respected than they are now, I suppose.' ; . ? , : Mr. Riby broke in, ' The Puritans, Barba rians I beasts 1 It was just like them. Well, eir-^-?' .;. ;: ? '??'? ? '_?.;?. \- 'When the lector found that, he excavated more than was absolutely uecessriy for his1 purpose, and the deeper he went the more en caustio tiles. In one place they got down to the foundation,- and they found an oak chest fast in the rock— a sort of ^hannel had been out in the rook for this cheat, or rather box (fjr it was only about eighteen inches long), to lie in. The master mason was there luck ily, and would not move it till thn reotor had seen it. He was soot for, but half the paiish was there before him ; and he tells me there were three theoiies firmly established, and proved, before he could get to the' spot. The ory of ' Wilder tho village grocer : ^It is treasure hidden by them there aly monks.' Mr. Wilder is a misur, and is known to lay up money. He is I believe the only man left in the North country who can show you a hun dred spade guineas.' , . ,. Mr. Raby replied energetically, 'I respect him. Wilder for ever. What was the next theory?' ? : / 'The skeleton of a child. I forget- who. propounded this; but I believe it carded the majority. But the old sexton gave it a blow. ?' Nay, nsy,' said he ; ' them's the notions of strangers. I was born hero, and my father afore me. It will be Molly Slater's can lie, and nought else.' Then poor Molly's .whole story came up again over the suspected box. But lam very tedious.' ' . ? ' TediouB 1 You are delightful, and thrilling and pray go on. Tbe rector . had the box opened f . . -.'? ?On tbe spot.' ' ' ' ? Welir ; v 1 The box - went to pieces, in spite of all their care. ; But there was no, doubt as 'to its contents.'
