He remarked that of lato years tne power of government had been transferred from tho minority to the majority, and that tho possibility of wars had been almost absolutely precluded from taking place, because the people now had tne power to prevont them. Tho speaker contrasted the conduct of Sir Henry Parkes in connection with tho Kiama ghost affair with that of the lata Sir William Macleay, who, with other men of distinc tion, had sot them most, excollent examples in not allowing sectarianism to he mixed up in any way whatever, with politics. Referring to the present occupancy of seats in the country's Parliament hy labor men, Mr. Crick said he did not agree with thn30 who predicted that the labor party would go out at tho next, election, but bo could tell them that all those bogus representatives of labor would not bo returned again. What they would see would be these men replaced by more genuine sympathisers with tho aspirations of the working daises. Tho lecturer, at the oonclusion of his address, was accorded a hearty vote of thanks.
