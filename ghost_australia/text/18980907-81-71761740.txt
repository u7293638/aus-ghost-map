Sometimes it presents the uspect o£ a bull o£ fito dancing und rolling about over the marali in playful glee, i now and again, peilnips, when ,sti iking against ashVub or other obstruction, scattering a shower ,o£ balls, which in their turn would dance and playabout, not neceasauly, however, in the waka of the ptiront ball, whioh continues its wayward career, now shilling with a fieiy red i light, now,changing into a yellow or apaoer, thon fading into un undefined giqenibh tint, tolbm*8t out again into1 a ptuple bla¿e,f the erratic illumination nt longth"perhaps,'after gambolling about in quite frolicsome mood" ascending high up in the au' until.it is lost to view.
