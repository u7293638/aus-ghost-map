DEATHS FROM FRIGHT. " I liave interested myself lomewhat in looking up unusual causes of death," said a well -known physioian, "and have met several well-authenticated instances where fright was the cause. The English Surgeon* General Grande tells of a drummer in India ocroBB whose legs a harmless li*ard crawlcd when hu was half asleep. Hewns sure that a cobra had bitten him, and it was too much for his nerves, aud he died. u Frederick I. of Prussia, was killed by fear. His wife was insane, and one day she c&caped; from her keeper, and, dabbling her clothes in blood rushed upon her husband while lie was dosing in his chair. King Frederick imagined her to be the white lady whose ghost was believed to invariubly ap pear whenever the death of a member of the Royal Family was to occur* and lie was thrown into a fever, and died in eix weeks. '* But pcrhapB the most remarkable death from fear was that of tlio Dutch painter Pentman, who lived in the eeveuteeuth ccn* tury. One day he went into a room full of anatomical subjects to sketch 6ome deaths' heads and skeletons for & picture he intended to paint. The weather was very sultry, and while sketching lie fell asleep. He was aroused by bones dancing around him and the skeletons suspended from the ceiling clashing together. In a fit of terror he threw himself out of the window, and, though lie sustained no serious injury and was informed that a Blight earthquake had caused the commotion among his ghostly surroundings, he died in a few days in a nervous tremor. " I could cite many other cases where the shock to the nervous system which we know as fright has produced death."
