THE LADIES' COLUMN. THE UNBURIED PAST. What should we find if we might wander.bask A?e?ss the lcvel of these later years, And tread once more the sunny mounitin track Whote shining vista was not dimmed with tears? There would be ghosts, you think, to bar our way, The sad-e~el spectres of a vanished day. Nay, let us go: it may be we shall find Some flowers still sweet and frosh with memory's dew; It may be echoes linger on the wind, Heart- haunting songs, whose cvery note we knew How shall we face, you ask the dreams of old, The bright hopes dulled, the tender lovcs grown cold? Why need we fear them? They have kindly hands Outsti-tched to us across Time's dark abxr,. Though closed and barred to them our heart's door stands, And on our lips is set another's kiss--- - Als. poor ghosts, you say, to meet them so Were more than p inful-wo will not not go! -"Household Woreds.'
