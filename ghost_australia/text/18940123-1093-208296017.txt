AMUSEMENTS. The, romantic and sensational drama " Cinders", was repeated by Messrs. Norman • and' McLean's company, at the Theatre Royal, on Monday evening, in the presence of ' a large and appreciative audience. The various members of the company acquitted themselves well, and the many startling inci dents and striking situations contained in the ' drama met' •with ready recognition at the hands of the audience. The comedy element, • too, came in for a fair share of publio favor, and the play went smoothly from beginning : to end. Mr. Alfred Clint's scenery, especially the view of London-bridge; was the subject of much admiration, while the various other stage1 appointments were appropriate and pleasing. "Cinders" will be repeated this evening and throughout the week, when it . should continue to draw good houses. At the Bijou Theatre last night the first rehearsal of •" The Silence of Dean Maitland," , to be produced for Mr. Walter Bentley's • benefit on February 2, was held. Judging by the manner, in which the amateurs went ' through their parts the performance should be • well carried out. • The Cyelorama of the Battle of Waterloo still draws crowded houses daily, the extra attraction in the shape of Napoleon's ghost and • the enchanted fountain of laughing waters being the subject of universal admiration. The usual Wednesday night "Continental" this week has been postponed on account of Air. BaBsa's having arranged with the Cale donian Society to hold a national Scotch night . on Thursday next in commemoration of the 'i birth of Scotland's poet, Robert Burns. A : capital programme has been arranged for the occasion, particulars of which will be duly announced. ■ On Wednesday evening a rotunda concert will , take place at the Semaphore, when the Police Band will play. •
