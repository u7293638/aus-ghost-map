SPORTING INTELLIGENCE. VICTORIA AMATEUR TURF CLUB. 'The annual Spring Meeting of the Victoria Amateur Turf Club will be brought to a conclusion to-day The events to be run off possesangreaterintereatto racing men and the public of Australia than any races yet contested on the beautiful Caulfield course The late rains have freshened up the turf wonderfully, and the course now looks at its best The running track has been the object of Mr Bond's constant attention It has been frequently rolled with a. heavy roller, and yesterday it was in perfect order Should j no heavy downfall of rain occur the time made to day will be something exceptional for this course, which has always been a regarded as several seconds slower than the 3) Flemington course In order to accommodate the large attendance of visitors expected to day, Mr Bond has erected a temporary addition to the grand stand on the western side, while the small j stand near the weighing-room has been con- siderable enlarged In the stand itself, the I room which host hitherto been devoted to the | use of ladies and gentlemen for light refreshments has been considerably enlarged, and now forms a most agreeable lounge The Railway department has made special arrangements for the conveyance of passengers to and from Caulfield, no fewer than eight trains having been added to the number run each way on Saturday last. For the convenience of visitors to the races who may desire to avoid the crush at Flinders street station, three trams will be despatched earlier than usual, the first leaving Flinders street at 1113 am, the next at 11.30, followed by a third at 11.45 In addition to four other extra trains interspersed between those run last Saturday, a. later train will be run in time for the races, leaving 1 Flinders street at 1.42 p in The railway authorities have, in fact put on as many trams as it is possible to run to and from Caulfield, consistent with a due regard to public safety and the ordinary traffic of the Brighton and Hawthorn lines, all having to pass through the bottleneck at Richmond, to borrow the expressive phrase of the chairman of the Railway Commissioners The programme for to day's racing contains six events The first is the Selling Race, which will attract but little attention. The Hurdle Race, which follows has been reduced to a very few starters, but there is quality enough in the horses left in to furnish a most interesting race In the Nursery Handicap the youngsters of the season will again meet, and should the weather prove fine some idea may be got as to the qualifica- tions of the Maribyrnong Plate candidates the Caulfield Cup is the next race, and though one or two horses have been forced into undue prominence, the race is yet a very open one With such grand performers as Malua Martini Henry, Fryingpan, Sir Modred, Boolka Despot and Colstoun engaged, the race cannot fail to be an interesting one. Among the lighter weighted division are Claptrap Vergy Blink Bonny, Norfolk, Lord Wilton and Helene all good performers Bend Or has been very highly spoken of and his chance of bowling over the cracks is regarded by many as a very hopeful one. The field for the Steeplechase has been greatly reduced of late, and at present there are only nine competitors left in The meeting will conclude with the Windsor Handicap for which there will likely be a large field The first race will start at half-past 1 o'clock The following is the programme - SELLING RACE Of 100 Sovs The winner to be sold tor who Welejits-2 yrs 7st 4lb 3 yrs 6st lib , i yrs and up yards lost 7lb allowed for every £26 reduction in price I five furlongs st. lb Mr A O WobbsbgPoleStar 5yrs £60 7 11 Mr i Tozer sur ra Telltale aged £60 7 9 Mr V KorrsbmFlourctto aged £60 7 6 Mr J D Robertson s ch g Liddington, C yrs, £25 7.4 Hon W Pearson s b g Northern Light, 4 yrs 9 6 7 4 Mr D M Robertson s br h Hannibal, aged, nil 7 6 Mr A Saqui a b h Mistake 3 yrs all 7 0 Mr J O Reid's ch h Tumult aged nil 7 6 Mr J D Robertson s ch c, I Times, 6 yrs, nil 0 11 Mr H Usher Og Miles i yrs nil II 11 Mr S Miller's ch g Hopetoun 4 yrs nil Uli Mr W CalvertsOun lbs butter aged nil 0 11 Mr G S Harris's ch f March) 3 yrs £60 (1 10 Mr J R Cowell's bin Castaway 6) to nil 0 0 Mr J Whittingham s goAchmct 2 yrs £100 0 Mr S Miller s bro Jan 3 yrs nil (1 1 Mr C Ivory ns bro- Darrell 3 yrs nil 11 1 Mr A T Owen's b g Stone Broke, J yre, ml 6 12 SECOND HURDLE RACE.
