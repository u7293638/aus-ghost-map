NEW SOUTH WALES. (FROST OUR OWN CORRESPONDENT.) "ST SYDNEY, FEB. 6. Mr Suttor has been back to his constituency, and has been re-elected without opposition Mr Reid is still out in the cold, waiting the pleasure of Parliament The validating bill is not yet through for it has had to go through the parliamentary process a second time As I have already explained, the assembly altered its mind after sending the bill to the Upper House Mr Dalley though he stoutly defended the fourth clause liver and iintainiiiL, that it was fully justified by the precedent of the Marquis of Harting, ton in 1 adult 1 moved its withdrawal There is no object in discussing a question which has practically v inisliL 1 but the fourth clause did notes on all fours with the English precedent. In the colony the c it had been re- ferred to a sworn tribun il whose decision was to be final and that decision was that Messrs Reid and Suttor had never been elected to this Assembly have, been both ineligible at the date of the election Lord Hartington had been properly elected, but had subsequently forfeited his seat by accept- mt an officer and his case was only referred to an ordinary committee However there was no serious fight in the Council in the matter as the fourth clause was withdrawn but the third had to be altered to suit the changed circumstances When the bill came back to the Assembly the Speaker drew attention to this alteration and said that the House of Commons had always been very jealous of any alteration in a bill affecting, its own constitution Mr Stuart pointed out that the change was just what they wished to have and which they could not themselves male as the bill had passed out of their hands but out of deference to the point taken he moved that the bill be laid aside If the Council had not amends I the bill the Assembly would have been in a curious six We have many times had the Assembly complaining of alterations made against its will but never before of alterations to carry out its will but we wear the of clothes of the old country long after they have ceased to let us Lh House of Lords is a baronial House and representa- the landed aristocracy and the jealousy of the Commons is natural enough But in these colonies the second chamber is mainly a chamber of revision and to complain of a revising chamber doing" its revising, work and doing what all parties want to be done is looked at from the practical point of view as simply folly But such follies will be inevitable so long as we refuse to look at things as they are and insist on looking at them as they were hundreds of years ago The bill has not got through its stages in the Assembly altogether as a matter of form because some new points were raised one of them resulting in the bill berne, re committed before the third reading This was an amendment to forfeit the seat of members who had tendered for public works This was suggested by the recent case of Mr \uuL,han to which I have referred in a previous letter who had been a successful tenderer though he had declined afterwards to complete the contract and whom the House has refused to unseat although the Committee of J elections in 1 Qualifications had reported that he had rendered himself liable to have his seat vacated It was admitted in the House that member had opportunities for "getting secret infer mation that either people did not have had, therefore- IS is very undesirable that members should be allowed to tender on speculation keep the thing if it is good, and have political influence enough to get back their deposit if it does not look promising, Una feeling, was so strong, that an amendment was carried forfeiting" the seat of the tenderer An objection was taken that the amendment was outside the scope of the bill but the chairman over ruled it In the full House however on the motion for the third leading Mr Oanctt brought the matter before the Speaker and contended that as the hill was one for removing disabilities an amendment creating a new disability was not pertinent the Speak cr, while declining, to say that the amendment was fatal to the bill said that his opinion was against it. The bill was re committed therefore and the amendment removed the discussion on the taxation proposals has been by day all the week both maud out of the House and the Government has shown a disposition to give way in several points Mr Reid has to be re elected for 1 1st Sydney and it will not do to be too stiff, ' Mr Dibbs li is accordingly intimated that he will not necessarily stand out for the full penny that he never meant to tax furniture, and that he probably will not tat merchandise He has had several interviews with persons engaged in industries to whom the present tariff was in incidental protection and who complain that that protection is removed they will be ruined He tobacco people have inn be the best case and they have others I to sell out their books to him to show that with less than a shilling protection the cannot i Close by carry on the paper people have had a harder unfit with him because they have had to admit that without any protection they can manufacture white printing paper with a margin of profit and even sell it in the Melbourne mail ct in spite of the duty there But they declare that they cannot make brown paper at a profit and yet do not give a reason was In the course of the discussion Mr Dibbs brought out the fact that it requires five tons of coal to produce one ton of white paper that this coal is delivered at the Live cr pool works for 11s while it could not be de liveredü any Melbourne works under 21s so that for every ton of paper the Sydney manufacturers get an advantage over the Melbourne corni editor of 50s It is only £10 000 a year that Mr Dibbs proposes to surrender by abolishing the smaller duties There are six or seven small local industries that will be touched and they all declare that they will be ruined if the tin iii is simplified "Mr Dibbs declares that they will not and that at any rate they are bound to prove their case before he gives in to them. The probability seems to be that he will have to give in partially if not wholly As to the general question of the policy of the new taxes public opinion is still in a I very chaotic condition and we never had a clearer indication of the low standard of real political education among the people and of the extent to which all politics are judged by personal interests the citizens meeting was a partial failure The principal speaker was a newly arrived barrister from England, glad enough to class the front but who wearied his audience without getting, to the point The local speakers stuck to the matter in hand but were by no means uniform in their Sympathies the property classes have not as a rule come forward in any overt way to denounce direct taxation but everybody whether "genuinely or not seems suddenly interested in the welfare of the poor man and is declaiming about the way in which the taxes will affect him. It was said of old The poor ye have always with you Whether we ought to have them in a prosperous country like this is doubtful but it will be more easy to get rid of the poor men out of our social life than out of our political life Superstition is waning and ghost stories cease to frighten but the body of the poor man still causes the knees of the ordinary politicians to tremble Mr Dibbs has had the body put before him several times he protests that he is not frightened, but yet there is a slight quaver in his voice which provokes a little seer ticism As to the working classes they are very largely in favour of protection and yet they have always been clamouring. to have the burden of taxation shifted more on to the shoulders of the rich and their difficulty is how to realise both their aims Now that Mr Dibbs proposes to tax the rich it is seen clearly enough that the firm establishment of a property tax would for ever stand in the way of a protectionist polio So some of the protectionists propose a five per cent ad valorem duty all round as that will give revenue enough, and cost nothing to collect On this point Mr Dibbs has taken his stand firmly He told a protectionist deputation distinctly that if the Assembly preferred an ad valorem duty to a property tax it must get another Government to carry out the police Mr Copeland the former Minister for Works in the present Administration, has taken up a medium position He declares himself a freetrader, and says that while a resident in Victoria he could never see the good that protection did to it. But he wants to have an ad valorem duty on things that are either luxuries or things that are not produced in the colonies and that therefore will not act protective) or press upon the poor Mr Young another member of the House, has tar on a bolder course and lins tabled mineral resolution to the effect that the House does not approve of the fiscal proposals Some amusement has been caused by a question put to Mr Stuart as to what he meant to do in view of such an alarming notice of motion but he replied very properly that some discretion must be left to the Government as to the importance to be attached to such it notice He 1 it come from the recognised leader of the Opposition he should have adjourned the House, but were much adjournment necessary wherever such notices came from a in w and terrible engine for obstruction would be setup It how ever, the motion comes on for serious discussion, it will tend to clear the atmosphere and show the Government what its chances are _________________
