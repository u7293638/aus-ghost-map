IPSWICH RESERVE. [roOM A 00BBEBPONDENT.] So the " free and independent" of Bundenba are to have the hononur of making an M.L.A. oaf omeone. It is an old saying that if one dies or runs away there is generally someone ready to take bis place. It seems by rumour that there are already four anxious for the seat of our absent W. H.; but I make bold to inform all aspirants to the honour that none but an out-and-out Liberal need apply at present. We hare had too much of the hard and-fast driving of the pre sent Ministry for any would-be supporter to stand the ghost of a chance. What with the Divisional Boards Act of last session and the Maraupial Act of this, not to mention the steel rail business, the mail contract, end the railway dismissals and other high-handed dealings, the country has had more than enough of them. There has been some fine rain ihere during the last three weeksl-enough to make the grase spring ap. enable the farmers to get on with ploughint eahd planting; but only in some places has it ben su8-. cient to fill the waterholes. I notice that ideiral of' our farmers are'planting patches of cotton and sauger cane. I wish them sicreees: they certainly deserre it. It seems that our Divitional Board have, like manj othere, fallen foul of the sixtieth ssotion of the AIt. Why do not the Government (if they know what thbby intended this section to mean) step in and settle the point at oneeoo It is a shame to leave men in ua certainty.who are trying honestly to do the best thbey can to work this disagreeable measure. There has been some tall business done in the id?. pounding line lately. Last week a farmer lost a fe' head of cattle. Unfortunately they strayed into the' domain of a jackaroo equatter, and they weis driven over the boundary unto Mr. Impoundem, wrsiO' pounced on them like a hawk on a brood of ehicken), from whose grasp it took several pouidi to releaeie? them.
