JAPAN. (Ti in the Gazette, February 22 ) Jai ANEbL affairs are going on as quietly as possible There is nothing, as far as foreigners are aware, to disturb the current of Government affairs and the only rumours that reach us are not of a character to arouse apprehensions of trouble There is, however, a sad feeling of dissatisfaction at the course the Government is pursuing with regard to Native Christians It has surprised most foreigners to discover the very strong proof that Christianity had actually taken in the land and that whereas the year before last, victims of persecution for the sake of the Cross were numbered by hundreds, they are now being dealt with by thousands A school of navigation will shortly be opened at Skigi, whereat the professors will not be Europeans, but Japanese officers who served for or against Enomoto at Hakodate names are said to be making quite a rush for " presenta- tion,' in order that their children may have the young idea exercised in the law of projectiles, und familiarised with naval tactics marine survey part j is about being organised by the Japanese Government, to survey the coast and harbour under European instruction, The Tokio Maru, steamer, is likely to be devoted to this service, and Sab Lieutenant Maxwell, Navigating Lieutenant of the Sylvia, will probably be appointed to the command. A series of large godowns 110 about to be erected along the water frontage, from Bergen to the native western baths, for storage of goods belonging to Japanese mor chants the large space of ground that has recently been filled in at the base of Nongi Hill, over which the new railroad will pass, will be connected with the island on which Yokohama is situated, by the erections a new bridge, designs are now being prepared The telegraph between Yokohama and Yeddo has been thrown open to the public, at a charge of one tribe, about Is old for 150 characters or words. The Japan Mail justly remarks that nothing could show more clearly the contrast between Japan and China, than the readiness with which the Government has adopted this greatest in vention of modern science, and the ease with which the people have grasped the notions of its advantages Mr Lay has left for England, to engage engineers and purchase materials for the railway. The island of Yesio has been partitioned among the princes of the Empire, and the trade of Hakodadi is said to be increasing 6 The Japan Mail gives the following account of the funeral of Captain Williams, of the U.S. war steamer Oneida, who lost his life when that vessel sank after coming into collision with the Bombay -"At 3 o'clock on Tuesday afternoon the minute guns of the Uah announced that the remains of Captain Williams were on their way to the French Hatoba, from w hence the procession was to start, and where the Foreign Ministers, a large body of naval and military officers, the crews of the men-of-war in harbour, and the majority of the residents of Yokohama, were assembled The procession was solemn and imposing, and moved slowly forward to Christ Church, the hands of the Ocean and the 10th Regiment playing the Dead March in Saul ' As the body was carried into the church the Rev W. Smith, chaplain of H M S Ocean, read the appointed sentences which open the finest and most deeply moving of our Church Services, and in a few minutes every seat and all standing room in the building were occupied. The uniforms of the Navy of Great Britain and America were pro dominant, the scarlet of our line contrasted with the dark green of the Russian dress, nor were the naval and military dresses of the French wanting The British Admiral Sir Henry Ivellet, decorated with the Star and Riband of a Knight Commander of the Bath, and recognised by some who knew him in earlier days of an active Commander on the China station, was present, as were the English, French, and Prussian American Ministers The service was impres- sa ely read by the Rev. W. Smith, assisted by the Rev B Ball, and in due time and order the procession moved to the cemetery. There, amid many of the members of a profession in which he had served with distinction, and in the annals of which the loss of his ship will form one of the saddest pages, overlooking the Bay he recently left under circumstances so fair and promising, the last honours were paid to the remains of Captain Williams of the U.S. S Oneida " A cute observation is that of a writer in Fraser'!, who thinks that " there has been more improvement in ghosts than in any other thing during the past 500 years.
