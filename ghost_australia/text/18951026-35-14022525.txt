LIFE IN LONDON AND THEREABOUT, CmiOMCXED BY HENRY W. LUCY. A BlSTt/cJlCK MeTSEeTM.-A FnUOAT. PRESIDENT. CHARLES DICKENS. AND LITERARY ASPIRANTS, PÃ¼OrnlETABY CoATE.S. WESTMINSTER, Sept. 20. It is remarkable how completely Count Herbert Bismarck has shared in the obliteration (of his father from public life in Germany At one time he scorned in the way to make a position for himself second only to his father's Lord Rosebery, who knows him intimate ly, holds the highest opinion of him, a view shared by Sir Charles Dilke, who has also had opportunities of closely judging But when the father stepped off his high pedestal his son went with him. He has found opportunity in his leisure time to complete the organisation of a museum in the g gallery of the old family castle of Sohoenlnusen, containing the presents received by his father during his career When I NA as an Hamburg with Mr Gladstone a gentleman who came on board the Tantallon Castle gave us some interesting particulars of the collection There are, in all, half-a-dozen rooms, containing various classes of presents, the donors ranking from crowned heads to day labourers The first room is known as " the gallery of sovereigns " It contains oil paintings of nearly every reigning sovereign, including our Queen, and some that are dead. The Emperor of China's mother sent Bismarck a colossal elephant's tusk beautifully carved and pierced In another room, amOngst portraits of eminent statesmen, is the likeness of Lord Beaconsfield Of M Gladstone, Bismarck has no memento, not even a copy of one of his innumerable photographs Perhaps the most interesting piece of the collection is a seedy, battered chair which, when now probably cost four florins It is the chair on which Bismarck sat talking to Napoleon after Sedan, arranging the terms of the fallen Emperor's capitulation Another piece of furniture is the table on which the terms of peace, including the surrender of Paris, were signed at Versailles Quite a different man, who has, with equal sud | denness and completeness, vanished from the political stage, is M Wilson, son-in-law of M Grevy, sometime President of the French Republic Wilson was always involved in financial matters, and at length they dragged him to the ground. At one time he must have been enormously wealthy There is no doubt that he availed himself of knowledge gained in the inner circles of the Elysee to turn honest penny as Apart from his own earnings, his wife came into a large sum of money on the death of her father and mother Old Grey y grow more and more penurious as ago advanced In addition to his salary is President of the Re- public he had free quarter in Paris, and was provided with servants, fuel, light, furniture, and all household requisites by the State. He had, in addition to his salary, a considerable sum for travelling expenses The only travelling he ever did was to visit his estate in to him, and it was characteristic of the old gentleman that he managed to get a free pass out of the Paris and Lyons railway His position entailed on him the necessity of giving occasional dinners and balls, but Madame Grevy was a thrifty housekeeper, and these cost marvellously little fruit and vegetables came from the Versailles garden of France's ancient kings Ram- bouillet and Mary paid toll to the President's frugal table in the shape of game Mrs Crawford, the well-known Tans letter writer, whose information is extensive and peculiar, told me with respect to a particular dinner given by M Grevy, when at the height of his power, that it was, by exception, sent in from a restaurant, that it cost five francs a head, mind mg wine and that Madame Grevy had specially bargained that any dishes untouched should be taken back and allowed for When they were without company-and they did not receive much -the old couple toddled off to bed at 10 o'clock, first seeing that all the lights were out Not that this saved them anything, since, as I mentioned, the State provided lights But the instinct of thrift was so strong that they could not bear to have Rights unnecessarily burning, even at some- body else's expense I have lately seen a collection of autograph letters by Charles I) ckens which, as far as Ire member, have not been published They were certainty now to me, and bring into fresh light the kindliness of his character They are of different' dates, but chance to be nil addressed to various aspirants for literary) occupation One is dated as far back as IS 11 It gives precise instructions as to the course his correspondent evidently a stranger should take in forwarding his manuscript " A magazine sheet," he writes, " is sixteen pages The rate of remuneration to unknown writers is six or eight guineas a sheet usually Manx unknown writers write for nothing I wrote for the next thing to it myself when I was one-and-twenty " He was at this ditto 22, and had written "Pickwick," "Oliver Twist," " Nicholas Nickleby," and the immortal " Christmas Carols "His only additional piece of advice I can give you," he adds, 1 is to concentrate on this pursuit all the patience that would be required in all the other pursuits of this world put together, and to lay our account with having it tried " In another letter written to Mrs Gaskell in the familiar blue ink, bearing the date 21st February) , 1893, he returns some manuscript who submitted to him on behalf of a friend "The papers," he writes, possess no kind of characteristic to render them available Between ourselves, and not for information of the author, they are of that intensely dreary and commonplace description, to which not even the experience of this place (he writes from the office of All the Year lion id) s reconciles my wondering mend Everybody could write such things, I imagine But how am body can contentedly sit down to do it 13 inscrutable Don't you feel the same astonishment ' People don't plunge into churches and play the organs without knowing the notes or having the ghost of an car Yet 50 people a day will rush into manuscript who have no earthly qualification but the actual physical part of writing " in a long letter, written so recently as 1870, he addresses a verse maker who had been introduced to him by Lord Lytton " Your river tale," he writes, " is a weak repetition of the form of your printed story The German manner will not carry the feeble matter If you will consider the river ator) apart from that manner I think you will find it extremely common-place, with nothing in the way of character or incident to support it There is a vast deal too much proclamation of poetry without the appearance of the reality after the trumpets have been blown All the stock in-trade of the miserable little books of verses that constantly accumulate on my table reappears in no new form I call them miserable because they make me so in the evidences they present of a mistaken vocation and its attendant inevitable bitterness of disappointment The love romance of poetry of human life or external nature is not to be found so as to awaken a response in an) reasonable breast by crying Lo here ' Lo there ' See where it comes ' Look where it goes ' lines is it That is it. The other is it You will get no where by the road you are now pursuing You are in a worn out way that never was a very firm one, and has been trodden into a mere Slough of Despond " The practice of luring or renting a chapel and setting up some one to preach in it, familiar enough in Thackeray's time, is fast dying out in London, if indeed it is not dead. The proprietary chapels, built for the most part in the eighteenth century) in thoroughfares Bines largely developed, became too valuable for the purposes to which they were originally devoted Ono in Conduit-street, where I have often heard a famous preacher now dead, has been transformed into a tailor's shop One of the latest to go is the chapel in West-street, where Wesley long preached This chapel was built about the year Queen Anne came to the throne There is a record that it stood on the site of an earlier church dedicated to " the performance of divine worship in the Irish language " In Wesley's diary there are many parties touching his ministration in West street Chapel He preached his first sermon there on the 29th October, 1943, and his last in February, 1790 There is, or used to be, in the vestry of the old chapel a stumpy little pulpit which Wesley used to mount when he preached in the streets of London Other famous divines, echoes of whose voices linger round the walls of the old chapel, were Whitfield, Romance, and Fletcher, of Madeley West-street Chapel is now closed, and will soon be demolished A similar fate awaits the old chapel in Tottenham Court-road, where Whitfield long preached A hundred and thirty years it has stood there An effort was lately made by the congregation to raise funds to purchase the freehold of the ground I have not heard how far it succeeded But ground in Tottenham Court- road is worth to-day a sum vastly increased by comparison with the terms on which the site was originally obtained for the chapel in the city, where land is almost priceless, the churches mainly built by Wren after the great fire still stand, their right being I inalienable But they are built about in pitiless fashion, warehouses, shops, and offices shouldering them as ith ruthless energy They are still open on Sunday for divine service But few attend except the parson and clerk It would be a happy thing if they -were pulled down and the space grassed over, making bright breathing spots here and there in the crowded city
