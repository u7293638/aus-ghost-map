A Doctor'* Story. I {From the Speaker.) -JV NCfiin,the course of a medical career m \m \ of nearly fifty years I saved at patient's y£J life.

He looked at me with an anxious face «?

' Then my opinion is 1 this , 'I said slowly and distinctly, ' that if ? your wife dies —you'll be hanged for it.' He never moved a muscle on his face ; but [ his njolour -went witha rush — he was white as ' ' .-a ghost in a moment. He rose with an effort, 'Thisis a mauraxK plaimaterie,' he cried, '* at such- a time as^Ehis ! AmavrvziV plat* aulcrie '.' (He was more than'half French, and his native language came natural to him ,at these critical moments.) W ' No plaimntcric at aD,' I^inswered, very grim, ' but a simple statement; of my medical I opinion. Look here, If r. So-and-So, we are two ; vou are one. Now I give you fair warning. This lady upstairs is being slowly poisoned. Unless she recovers, we will hold you answerable. Tou wanted the best advice. Well, now you have got it. Don't suppose you can deceive me by using a little-known poison. I won't let you murder her. Tour wife must recover. I have my eye upon you. \- If anything' ever happens to her, now or here after, I shall take good care there is full in quiry ; and so will T)r. Harvey. I say no ? more than that. And I wish you a very good morning.* . To-morrow, when I come, I shall expect to see a marked improvement.' And to I did. She was decidedly bettor. In three weeks she was well. In a month she was at Harrow-gate. I never undeceived her. She loved the creature; and I allowed her to p- on loving him. But I confess^ iMras re : lieved wnen, four years later, he provifcntiaUj broke his wretched neck on the Stuflkhom. It unburdened my mind of the responsibility of watching him. In other cases I have my doubts. But in that one I am confident I really saved my patient's life ; and -I should think you agreff L with me.
