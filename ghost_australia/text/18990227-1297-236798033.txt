RUSIICUTTERS' BAY BOATS.— HANDICAP RACE. Under the auspices of the r.euly fonnc<l Sydney Sailing Club, a "hurry-scurry" race was oailcd on Saturday after noon, open to boats of every description hailing from Rushcutters Bay, for which cash trophies had been given by Mr. R. llordem and others. The course fixed was from Rushcmtcr.i Bay, round the wntson's Bay pile light, Shark Island, flaghont in KusheuU9rft Bay, back- round Shark Tsland, and finishing across the starting line, keeping Clark Island on the starboard band both going out and coming back into the bay. Unfortunately, how ever, except in the case of three boats — Ida May, Juno, and Sea Foam — this condition was not complied with, ami on the second work down to Shark Tsland the re mainder of the fleet passed between Clark Island and Darling Point instead of rounding the island as inteded. Nevertheless, it must be admitted that the course was not laid down with sufficient clearness on the pro gramme. There were in all IS entries, and of these onlv CVlisi and Dolphin failed to put in an npppearancc. The sails were limited to jib and mainsail, 'but the crews were unlimited. Result:— Helena, 20ft., It. Sharp, lOmin., £3 and trophy .. X Ida May, 21ft., O. M'Kay, lOmin., £2 A Juno, 16ft., 11. Toster, l'Jinin., £1 10s 3 Ena, lift., B. Llovd, lOmin., £1 4 Other starters: Plover, 22ft., scratch; Massilia, 24ft.v 2min.; Sea Foam 22ft., Ghost 24ft., 3min.; Splendora, 22ft., 5uiin.; Foston, 22ft., Smin.; Cynthia, 20ft., lOmin.; Lorna, 21ft., llmin.; Phyrne 20ft., Inez ISft., Wyuna, 18ft., llmin.; Muriel, 20ft., lOmin. Most. of the fleet got away well to time, but Sea Foam and Massilia crossed too soon, and were obliged to return. Ghost lost her bobstay soon after starting, and gave up. . On the work down the harbor Eim and Ida Slay sailed a close race, these two going to the front at Stool Point. The bnckmark boats bad no chance, several of them being unable to carry their largo sails. The 14-footcr Ena in creased her lead from several of them, and even tko 24-footer Plover gained only 4sce. on the little dingy. The times squaring away at the Pile Light were:— Ena, lb. 22iuin. Msec.; Ida May, 4b. 23min. fiitacc.; Juno, 4h. 25inin. Sscc.; Phvrne, -ill. 25min. 37sec.; Helena, 4b. 20min. 40sec.; Wyuna, 4b. 27min. 3 sec.; Foston, 41i. 20rnin. 7aeo.; Cynthia, 4b. 30min. 15sec. ; Lorna, -lh. flfliniti. Usee. ; Inez, 41i. 37min. 45scc. ; Son Foam, 41i. 83tr>in. 21sce.; Plover, ill. SSmin. 52soc. No alteration look place in the positions running up to the flagboat. where Ena was 4Usoc. ahead of Ida May, with Juno another minute astern; thou came Phyrne, Helena, and Wyuna. Working back to Shark Island, Helena went up into first position. The leaders' times squaring away were:— Helena, 6h. 23min. fiasco.; Ena, fill. 24mln. 45scc.; Ida May, Gh. 25min.; Juno, fill. 25min. 12sec. ; 1 Phyrne, fib. 2Gmin. lGsec. ; then came Wyuna, Foston, Cynthia, Lorna, Sea Foam, anil Plover. Running home, Helcne drew further ahead, but Ida May, Juno, and Ena made a great race of it for the other places. Finishing, the times taken were: — Uclenn, fib. 37mln. 65scc.; Ida May, fill. 39min. fiOsec.; Juno, fib. 40niin. 3sec.; Ena, fill. 40min. lOscc.; Phyrne, fill. -lOmin. Gfisec.; Wyuna, fill. 41min. GOsec.- Cvnlhia, fib. llmin. fiOsec.; Lorna, fih. 4Smin. 14sce. ; Sea Foam, fih. 4«mln. 25scc.; Plover, fill. 40nun. Saec. Thus, Helena had lmin, OOscc. to spare from Ida May, which had 13see. to the good from Juno. The latter heat Ena by 7sec. This result, however, may be altered, owing to the course not having been properly sailed by the first and fourth boats. The officials were Messrs. Hellin«'s and Thomas, anil Mr. Caldwell had charge of the steamer Lady Alary, which followed the race. 10FT. HANDICAP.— Course: From Goat Island, round Shark Island, and hack. Alpha, E. C.
