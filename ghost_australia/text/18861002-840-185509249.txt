Bubbles. Another man is now go?ng to try bis hand and mouth at blowing a centennial bubble The fact ia eveiybody wants the honour of blowing it. Even Kir H. Paries may yob tak-s a turn at the Eoap and pipo. He is an expert in tho bubble business, and the ghoul business too. It is come years since he raised the Kiama ghost, and to this day that reBtless ghost ha a never been laid. If Henry woro in power — he is not, may heaven forofend— it would bo tw° to one if he did not get H.R.H. to come to seo his crony Carrington. But Sir Patriok, great aa he is at Exhibitions, is going to wash his bands after blowing the bubble now burst. Maybe they nti i it. Well, Mr. Harold Stephen ii going to try. The Stephens can do many things. Was it not Harold's father who used to oure by miracle ? Any way they aro related, since there ?was only cno Stephen at the first. He strikes for an International Ext'bition. No doubt that would havo been a good thing if the Internets were not already over done. That great white elephant wr'ch half fplcd the inner domain, was tin exhibition pill which New South Wales will never forget. In ehort, it was a draught, and a block one too. But now, would it not bo a good thing to fetoh over Taylor Barnum to run it for them ? Baiaum is a host in himeolf, and hundreds of folk would pay nmply to eee him. Hekae, too, a good knowledge of the sort of thing to show. Ho would pnt up a complete series of colonists from tho oldest inhabitant to the youngest, capable of being put on view. Bainum would show not fat cattle, but fat squatters, and not fat cheap, but the monetary institutions which have flccocd them in those herd times. Yes, by all meunB havo a show ; nil one's neighbours cov'd join and let Barnum to run it at a percentage on the takings.
