On cmssiug Mount Pleasant, hi was riding leisurely ulong, tut night l.t-ing dark, but sufficiently light enough to enable him to discern objects, when, without any previous intimation, bis horse started el something. Simultaneously, a strange noise was iicaid. ami on looking down to the side of the road lie lie- | held the spectre. The head was only visible, aud be describes it as being larger in size tlia.ii j * cow's.

He immediately put spars to his horse, aud the ghost taking the hint quickened his pace. They raced for some Olebwee, when suddenly the spectre ' vanished Into thin air.'
