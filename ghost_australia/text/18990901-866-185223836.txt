ON DIT That Captain John Shimmins was born on the 17th April, 1815. That he was 84 years of age last April. That he first made his appearance in Tasmanian waters in the Seahorse in 1841. That he skippered the good old brig Jane, the Lady Emma, the Balmoral, and the Victoria for years. That not very long ago he took one of London traders round to Launceston. T ha t the old W aterm an* Arm s, in Liverpool street, ia polled down and a im.dscm e row o f ih o p i baa taken ita plaee.

T ha t M r H am ilton and D r Crowtber voted agauist the reduction on boots and shoes. T ha t M r Bradley made a mistake last evening and voted against the food o f the people. T h a t he admitted he had done so in error and apologised. T ha t the discussion on the remission of nies in tbe Aeaembly last evening was like the ghost o f to old debate. T ha t many yeara ago M r (now Sir) Rdward Rraddon founded a debate on moleakin tronsera historic.

T h a t if the second schedule happens to be reduced to one item —patent horse colla rs—the b ill w ill present a very comical appearance. T ha t none of Tasman ia's rx-G ovem o rt are alive.
