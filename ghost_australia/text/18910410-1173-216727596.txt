THE SPECTRE CAPTAIN. Queer Acts of a Ghost "Which Haunts . Steamer in Brooklyn Basin. "I'll never go out near the old Tiiber " again," said a well-known boatman of East % Oakland one Sunday as he looked towards the blaak hulk of the steamship William Taber, which lies near the Oakland estuary. " Why not 7" Why, because she is haunted. Lastnight I was out with a parly, and Iran my boat in under the stern of the old sbip. :. As we came around on the starboard side 0! • tbe vessel some one halloed, " Who comes there ? Back water quick or I will shoot." < I looked up, but saw no one. With me wen two ladies and gentlemen, guestb from Tubbs* Hotel. They heard tbe voice, but, like myeelf, were unable to see an; • one. "Theladies were badly frightened, and.; begged me to pall away. I was about to do <; eo, when the watchman on the ship looked A over the gangway and wanted to know what-?. wbb up. ' ' " * Is ii yoa people that ia making that noise down there?' qneried the old fellow, .: * If it is, yoa had better steer way, because ' I have beard noises enough on this ship to? • night withont yoa people coming along and; making any more.'" . . A WHITE- BOBED XIQUBE. Continuing his story, tbe beatman zaid : ^ " I pulled away lo the shore, and as we./ bleated tbe ship I saw a white robed figure :, on the bridge. It was that of an elderly man. He bad a flowing white beards and', was directing 'the helmsman by hand signals. ; I saw as plain as could be tbe spreetremotioning to starboard, port, steady, etc., and occasionally he would put down his hand-as if to noli tho slow down or back bell in the . engine' room. No bell responded, bui the | figure on the bridge went through all fee motions. Aft at the gangway stood the ^ j watchman, and in the Bheen of the moon* | light I saw the watchman of tbe steamer.: His face was blanohed and he called us back,''. The ladies in tbe boat were terror-stiioken| and insisted upon my xo wicg to the thore, " I had no alternative but to comply. Bythe ^ time I landed them the tide was flooding,: and, although I wanted to go out to the 1 vessel, I. concluded to wait until morning;: rather than row against the tide. " This in substanoe was tbe story' told by"! Old Bob, the well-known.boatman in the*; Brooklyn Basin. The man is noted forixia \ sobriety, and bis story io tbe tiTcct tbat j there is a spectre captain on the old Taber | is confirmed by a number of cihoeisie -wbo-S row on that: portion of . tbe bay known fcsi Brooklyn estuary.
