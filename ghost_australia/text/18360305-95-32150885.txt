C.ret-u fior .t libel pihbltled in hw thatpaper retiectinig tilnon the ch:e.ircer of the ( plhintit" ff. p Mr. Solicitor General opened the case ; he said !n that its laying i' before the Court, hite had little more to do, than to rIad the libels which appeared ti' upon the record. Although it might be supposed I. a case of this kind was one for a jury, he thought p neither party might regret the omission, when _, it was brought before a tribunal, composed of as n high minded men as could be found i*this or any is other community. In asking them for a verdict for the injury which such libels were calculated to le inflict upon his client, he would have to read themi " over again, and although tithe vulgarity of the com- t' position might excite a liiigh, yet still it would l shew the disgrace which must be brought upon the community through the degra-led btÂ·tte in which a a portion of the press was reduced to in this co. lony. A series of libels appeared in the Gasette c during tan investigation Illat took place at the Po lice Office spon the conduct of a person nIunied a Watt, who was now united to the defendant by the d closest and he It u-ted the happiest ties. But what a could be thought of the defendant when they saw n that she allowed the paper to be-prostituted to the C most base and d' r putable purposes; a paper t twhich ought to have been kept for the benefit of her children, but for the gratification of her own passions she permitted it to be mnade the vehicle of conveying to the world a series of scandhilois libels. The person W\att had held a ticket-of,-lcave for Sydney, but /i'hich for certain reasons was changed to Port Macquarie. Mr, WVindeyer, jun. here interrupted the learned s gentleman and apptaled to the Court, whether Mr. Sh licitor could go into matite which was not re. - gularly bef ire the Court. e 1ilr; Justice Burton said, that counsel in stating their case must use their own disc ec:ion. Mr. Solicitor continued, lie woutl take his own course, and notbe put out by any one. The pe. son named Watt was in the Gnacit Office ; true there was another person, a nominal Editor, bit it was well known that Watt was really the writer of the, articles complained of. Mrs.;,l-lowe had followied Watt to Port Miacquettrie, and had since I obtained a license to marry him. In the ordinary course if a wbman married, thei action would have had to be brought against the husband; but the a husband in this case beridgi c oarict;-they had-no other coursc. Iie could not expect that they s would give the same damages against Mrs. [lowse 1had she been simply the proprietor, but when they -sacw-that-shtlentiheliiG of her La ier to anothl-r for the worst of purposes, thie m -asue s o t l air LI timsiages would lie was sure be very dilfferent in deed, fromn whit they other wise would have been d it was imt posible that W\att could Ibe suelrared to remain bihind the curtain. He must drag forward that man, whom the defendantt had so indulged, } merely that shlu might gratify her own amours. a The libels it timay be sd by ::thlO opposite side were Smerely intended :.s iron,uy anti could do nli harm. But hlie w?utl;l read one f the libels, and then ask Swlhether aniytliig cmul I tendl more to bring into n disrspecct thelcharacter of rll. Mludie.

These le were two charges co:tained inl the libels. The first e thlit of Mr. Mhdie being gan itm toral ntan, living c with a feitale Irisioner of the Crown. and the in other that of perverting the power lie possessed as na maisrate ton a ver:tl purpose.. The libels were so gross and so pitill that lie doubted whether ever \- su.ch at case had before bectn blrought forward, auln us if they (the assessors) took tile samine view of it, ethey hadnoothier alternative than that of giving a verdict inl favour of his client, .luiliiii been charged with associating with a herd of con. re victs, lie was now about to go bhome to England, s, but with such a charge--hangieg over himt, lihe ,d could not travel even in it coach, swithoutbeing liable to insult.
