BALLARAT AND ITS BUNYIP. A correspondent sends tho following to tho Ballarat Star: — " I em delighted to infoim you that the bnnyip has been seen in Weniloureo. At Fry's mill a few evenings ago two respectable men eeoretcd themselves and were rewarded. The sound emitted closely resembles tho bleating of a large calf ; or, perhaps, to be exact, between that and tho sound of a large drum. Well, after waiting for two hours, sure enough ho made bis appearance and rolled along a distance of ten yards, sending the wator about in fine style; body like a large pig, face oi A calf, with long mane. He has been seen near Brown's, where his peculiar call can be heard any evening after sundown. As a pioneer I oannot tell yoc the pleasure this discovery hae given me. We have no rats, no ghosts, and the spirits arc a failure here ; but we have the bunyip ? For a week I havo known nothing but delights. I have seen tho bnnyip myself. I wish I had not. Personal acquaintance with him has proved him a delusion. Alas ! this has been uty fate so often. I heard tho dreadful sonnd as above — it oamo from a bittern — it has a peculiar bellowing cry, which has obtained for it tho name of Mire-dram, Bull of the Bog, and its name — Bitour, Botour, Botaurus — see the books. Now for the other phenomena. It is caused by the mcak-duok. The male bird is ae large as a common goose, with most peculiar wings, or rather paddles — see de scription genus biziura — with which he scuttles along, every now and agiau sending the water high up tp the air, certainly over 5ft, and making a great commotion. Go np to the swamp any moderately cloar nigbt ; you will oortainly hoar tho bunyip, and with a little patienoe and imagination you. will also seo him."
