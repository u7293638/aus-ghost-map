POOR HIGHLAND FLORA'S TALE. ! [By TH» IATE Du. NOUMAN M'LEOD.] . Ï: ' ; SHE sat tosido hor opon chest, That gii'l ao atom anil cold ; Though serving in a genial houso, Her heart would no'or unfold Td tho kindly tonos of sympathy, That feminine Freemasonry Whoso touch is f olt by rich and poor, And loved by young and old. Slowly sho dragged her daily round Of dtttica, never dona ; No thought luid sho for the master's meals ; No sniilo for tho children's fun ; No caro for earth ¡no hopo for hoavon ; No gratitude for faults forgiven E'er touched her heart, if nature had Provided her with ono. Tho young ones weariodfor "tho tomi," For nurse was heard to say, "You'll have no plcnauro in tho homo Till Flora goes away. I can't got on with hor at all, Her.vory blood sooma turned to gall; And if mamma koopa Flora on, Poor 'muna must lott vo at May." Yot thoro sho sat by hor opon chost, That girl BO atorn and cold, And fondly round hor fingers twined A curl of shining gold. . And gently in her Inp waa laid Simplo and plain, bat neatly inado^ An infant's tiny dross. And thus Her withering talo sho told: 1 ' Yea, ma'am, it ia a baby's frock It ia a baby's hair: Had you but soon tho bairn liirnael', Sao fat, an' oh, sao fair ! Yes ! whore's tho «so to toll a loo ? Ho was my nin, an' dear to uio Aa tho hoathor-boll lo tito honoy-beo, " Or tho braird to tho inoantnin-harc. Yo8, ma'am, ho's doid, my lnddio's dcid: Oh that ho'd no'or hoon born I Hy curBo bo on tho coward heart That wrought tlu's sliumo and scorn ! Black shamo nu' sorrow may ho aoo ; No, no, ma'am ! novor 'whist' atme! I'll curso him till tho day I doo ; I wish it was tho morn. It'a wrang ! hut, oh ! I dinna caro : Thoro'B whilos I wish tho Clydo Waa vowin' owcr tho yellow hair That nuco was a' my prido Tho yellow hair ho used to crown Wi' bunches o' tho red, rod row'n ; An''ayo ho said I waa tho bollo O' a' tho country-sido. I wns a young warm-hearted thing, Wi' nnno to counsol mo ; My mother doo'd o' cholora; My faithor drown'd at aea. Oh ! wool I mind my mother's word ; A sweetor voico I novor hoard ; An' a' ita swootnoss waa my ain, For sho had nano but ino. Oh, mother doar ! oh, mother dear ! Whono'or I mind o' you, Your faeo has on that uwfu' look, I think I seo't tho noo ; Ayo whoa aho turned that look on me I kont that aho waa gaun to doe, An' then I danced, and surcighod, an' cried, ' Oh ! tuk' woo Flora too !' I creopit up ahint her back, »An' tried if I could doo ; ( My heart was faint for wnnt o' mci it, An' sorrow sickon'd mo. Tho choking saba cam' lang an' dwp, I thought it (loath,-it was but sloop ; An' oh I tho sieht tho morning licht Showed to my wnukoning o'o J Wo lind nao grund Venetian blinds, Nno curtains thoro to closo; We gncd to bod when it waa dark, An' wi' tho licht wo roso. I halo tho morning sun to shine Into my bod ; it gara mo min' Tho day I lost tho only fríen' That o' ur I had to lose. That morning was baith warm an' bricht, Tho lark sang in tho akica, Tho big flers buzzed about tho bod, An' tho sad wailing cries O' tho woo lambs cam' doon tho hill; . Hut a' within tho houso was still, An' oh ! I missed tho kind, kind voice, That coaxed mo ayo lo riso. I liston'd lang wi' atcokit e'en, My head wns dazed an' quoor ; I kind o' folt thoy worcna liko Tho sounds I usod to hour. I missed tho Uro, that emek'd aaa crouso, I missed tho stop about tho houso, I felt sho waa boaido mo thoro, Hut oh I sho didna stcor. My heart gaod liko a tliroshing-mill, My bond bogan to spin, An' rona' «boot, au roon' aboot, I saw tho hail houso rin. Thara cam' a durk'nin' o' tho licht, A ilstliu' sound-a cry o' fricht ! ' God help tho bairn ! hor mother's doid ;' But nano would venturo in. I sprang rioht up, lind oot tho bcd; I waa baith young na' woo, lint mothers, ay, an' boarded mon, Turned white at sieht o' mc. I dualled tho window in thoir faco, I said thoy woro a1 cownrd race, That daunia lond a lum' to help, But loft hor thero to doo.' I told thom-but, och-honc-o-reo! I canna toll to you, A' that I said-I hadna thou Tho English I have noo. But, oh ! your English is so weak, It tnk's tho Gaelic tonguo to speak Tho bitter, burning word o' acorn That gars tho hnivu heart gruo. I diana Icon what hnppon'd noxt, I drapait liko a sUuio ; I think thoy laid mo in a barn, An' loft mo thora my lane, For fear I hud tho trouble too, X wish -1 wish ithad boon truo ! But, oh ! no, it waa only just A fever o' tho brain. An' thon I thocht that I was doid, An' by her sido I lay, An' roon' aboot' au' roon' aboot Tho houso gaod nicht an' day. Au' whoa my liowd aim' richi, I fand That I was in anither land Living wi' friou's L didna kon Fríen » ? did I dam' to say ! What frión'. V tho cnglo to tho lamb ! Such friou's woro thoy I trow; What frion' 'a tho groedy glowrin' glod To tho woo oroodliu' doo? What frion| 'a tho bunter lo tho hare? Its baby-erios no'or mndo Aim spare. Brnw coat« can covor cruol hearts My trina's woro gontry too. My lady aaid I hat hors waa but 1A vory distant tio To hor that's gone, Thny wore not like Atwool ! and so thocht I My mutilar 1 was notnoar so young ;' I struggled snir to baud my tongue, Bul in nblow my broulh I said, ' You lio I-you lio !-you lie !

Did I no kan how sho henel', By «orno grand frion' was ta'ea, Whilo her poor twinnio cried wi' grief At hoing loft hor Inno. Littlo sho thocht I kont it a', An' how my lady ran awa' ,Wi' tho young laird ;-I kent a deal Though Twas hut a wean. I kont my mother got a bribe, , O'aomo twa pounds or throo, . , After my faithor'siwliony sunk ...,-?<?..

Maybe they thocht I was so woo, . That I could neither hear nor seo ; I saw my auntie, nn' I hoard I waa to bo 7iOMiiai<l. Awool ! Awcol !-I bow'dmy nock To boar tho friendly yoko ; I learned to talk tho English too, As woll as ¡thor folk. An' soon I carno to liko il imo, . Young hearts aro lieht I-an* so was mino. Oh ! when I think what's coming noxt, I fool just liko to choto. But vot you've boon so kind-that I Would Uko to toll it too; . For oh, it's but a poor rotuwi That I havo mado to you ; I thinkmy heart's just liko a coal, That burned as lang as it could tholo ; Now it's, a cinder bhick and cauld, Oh ! dear-what will I do ! Oh ! no, ma'am, no, I daunia stop, Although it gives mo pain ; For, if I dinna toll't tho noo, ' I'll novor tcil't again. Maybe !-wha kens-aforo tho morn I'll bo as if I'd no'or boon born. I wondor will ho think ou mo, Whon I am deed an' ganoP I lived with her for five laug years, Or over he cam' hamo. An' if I wnsna happy then, I had mysol' to blamo. Sho likot ayo to seo mo drost, But though I lived amang tho rest, Sho hud a way that mado mo fool I wnsna just tho same. Sho said I was 'as tall and straight As a young poplar tree;' What gait her wondor that her son Should think tho same o' mo ? Sho's ta'eu tho licht frau my young lifo, I might lino boon his happy wifo ; I Jut for her pride-I bato hor noo, I'll bato her till I doo ! I did my best to please, and I No'or heard a word o' blamo ; Sho spoke ; for over spoke of kim, An* wished that ho was hamo. Slio said sho know I'd liko him woll ; Good right had shu to blamo hanoi' AVhon a' cam truo;-she fann'd tho fire, Then thocht to frcozo tho ilumo. I neodna tell you that ho cam', lier braw, bmw sodgcr son, But this I'll loll to clear myacP, I wnsna lichtly won ; Ho watched mo lalo, ho watched ino Billie, Ito followed mo bailh out mid in ; But I thocht on his mother's prido, An' a' tho risk I run., But, oh ! I lorcd him wi' a heart So puro nu' truo, so freo Fraothocht o' world's wealth; his love Wus dourer far to mo Than a' tho world hold bosido ; But still, I wouldnu bo his bride Without his mother's freo consent, And that could novor bo. And oh ! I loved tho rowan tree, An' the bonnie hnzol doll, An' tho daisy bunk whore ho sat wi' mo Bosido tho mossy well. Oh ! mony a time ho led mo Ihore, An' mony a limo ho deck'd my hair Butnyo 1 foar'd his mother's- pride, An' soon sho broke tho spell. My lady culled mu to hor room, Au' lectured mo so lino ! Sho thocht, sho did. that 1 overy bird Should marrow wi' ¡ts kin'. I kent wbnso blood wus in my veins, But, no ! I wadna tnk' tho pains To tell hor ; if hor heart was proud My word ! an' so was minu. I look't hor in Ibo faco un' saw Her colour obband How ; Hor heart was pleading on my sido, But prido-cauld prido said-A'o. Sho says to mo, wi' angry o'on, ' Wily do you uland thoro liko a qucon f ' Bocauso I fool liko ano,' said I ; And then I turn'd to go. Sho stopt atwoou mo and tho door, Au' pushed mo back again ; Wlia wad Imo thocht, to seo us thou, I was hor Bator's wean? I stood (boro, an' I boru it a' For sake o' her that was awa ; , Though thoy woro falso au' cruel words, .1 managed to rofrain. Then, turning round, I said ' firowcol,' But nao fnrowcol said «ho ; I rondo hor gowns, an' trimmed hor cups, Sho couldna part wi' ino ; Besides, bo soon would bo away :' Hut lung ufoio tho licht o' day, I slippit oot unseen by uno. Why did ho follow mo P Why did ho swear to find mo out, Whorovcr I could bido ? Why did ho say no earthly power Should r ib him of Iiis brido ! Why did ho vow hy hcuvon above, To shield mu with a husband's lovo? I thouin his «nuil didna live I aMho world walo. Hp trnck'd mo as Ibo floreo blood-hound Tracks down tho panting slave ; I had no mother's heart to waru, No brother's arm to aavo. Hu pressed mo to bocomo his brido ; Ling, lang I strove my lova tobillo, But oh ! 1 thocht him good un' kind, An' beautiful nn' bravo. Tho villain totd mo that ho bvoclit lia froo consent lo mo ; An' wo wnro married, ns I thocht, But, oh 1 'I was ii' a lea. f novar dreamt lo doot his word, AH soon would 1 misdnot tho Lord ; That mado tho heavens mid tha earth, Whon Ho Haid, 1 Lot thora bo.' Mistress, you soo tho woo bit frock, You soo tho Bunny hair, My marringa was a heartloss cheat, Oh ! what need I say muir P But yui, in justice lo myanl', I think it's only rieht to toll, As soon 'as I found I was betrayed, : I loft him thou au' thoro. Ho had ino in lu's powor, aa' thocht That I would yield to bo A' that ho wished ; ho Hlllo know Tho soul that was in mo. My only fault aforo tho Lord, Was trusting to his faithloss word ; I couldna liva a lifo o' shaina, No, I would sooner doo ! I left him, nn' for woury months 1 struggled on mysol', But what I suffered u' that limo, No tonguo on earth can tell; Au' when nt last my boy was born, I lind to bido tba b ttor scorn, An' crud, cutting words o' shanta, That gai t my proud heart Bwoll. At lust my siller a' was apont, My landlady was poor, Au' though I pleaded nair for time, Sho turned mo to tho door. I couldmt go to Book a placo, Starvation stared mo in tho faco ; I took my baby in my anns, And travollod owor tho moor. Oh ! thon I ruad tho'prido that Dang His monoy ut his foot ; No for mysol', although ita hard To want th« bite o' meat. But ob ! I rued it for my pot, That cried for what ho couldna got, I grieved to soo the weary foco, An' hear tho waefu' groot. I triod to curso him, but I felt ' Liko Balaam on tho hill;. It soom'd as if I lost tho power, . Although Iliad tho will. . Tho woo bit lamb I loved so woll, ; , . ? ..".;.,. )U Look't up at mo sojliko himsol',, '.. I coiddna spoaU tho bitter words, ';. For oh l l loved lum still. Yes ; . heartless coward though ho was, .. An* though I kont him wool, .; ... .. .I loved tho vory -daisy flow . Ho crushed beneath his hool. ; I loved him, but I scorned him too ;, God holp mo what was I to do ? I triod to-pray, but oh, my heart Folt hard and cauld as stool. And thon I thocht, como weal, como woo, ? I'll seo him anco again ; I wnntcd nnothing for mysol', But food to BUVO my woan. Wi'mo, I kont ho couldna live, For I had naothing noo to givo ; Hunger was tearing at my heart, An'burning in my bmin. At last, I reached tho Lochan-sido, And saw tho rowan-trco, And Hang mo on tho daisy bank,. . Whore ho ayo sat wi' mo. Wi' bitter tho'chts o' black despair, I twinod thu horries in my hair, ; An' said, when wo'rota'on out of tho Loch, Ho'll ken thnttlÙB is mo. An' thon I took my baby up, ' And kiss'd him o'or an o'er ; Bul somehow, whoii 1 triod to walk, I couldnu reach tho shore. My burning brain bogan to shoot, An' roon' aboot, an' roon' about, Wont loch, an'hill. ua'tower an'tree, An'thon I folt no moro. I wakon'd in my nin wio room, Wool did I mind it a' ; Tho very knots into tho door, Tho staiiiB upon tho wa'. My Lady thocht it was tho damp Woo Jenny kent it was tho lamp, I kont mysol', but didna tell, Sho lot tho cruizio fa'. Oh ! Jonny was the blitho weo lass, Wi' such a blinkin' o'o ; It's queer how a' her fun that nicht, Cam' floating back to mo. Sho giod us Archio's boulio walk An' Butler Geordie's English talk. Tho Minister himsol' wad lauoh, Hud ho boon thoro to seo. I saw upon tho window-solo, Lang plaits o' yollow lmir ; My bau' gaed slipping up to feel, An' oh, my heed was bare ! Thon a' cam' rushing through my brain, Tho rownn-lreo, tito loch, tho wean; I folt a' roon' about the bod, But no ; ho wasna thoro. An' whilo I triod to think, I hoard A hnnd upon tho door ; A wee reon' fnco look'd in on mo, But whiter than boforo. 'Oh, Jonny hiss, como in an' toll What's wrang wi' mo ! I'm no mysol'. An' then such questions at Ispcer'd, Till I could tulk no moro. Sho hush'd mo liko a wearied wean, An' told mo not to speak ; Ail' when I lookil up, I saw Tho big tears on her cheek. I kent it must bo something bad, That mado oven luuchiu' Jonny sad ; But sho said it was only grief, At seeing mo so weak. I couldna baud my tongue, I criod, ' Ob, Jenny ! whore's my wean ? Just toll mo whoro my baby is, An' I'll no Bpenk again.' Sho throw her arms about my neck, An' criod us if lier heart would breuk, Thon sabhit oot, ' Oh, Flora dear, Ho's by tho reach o' pain 1' I thocht I would bo awfu' wild, If ho was ta'cn awa'; But no ; I lay an' hoard, as if Ho wasna mino ava.' I had nao strength to storm an 'rave ; So when she saw mo bear't so bravo, In Bpito o' doctor or o' doti, Sho sat an' toll't mo a'. Sho said, he bad been lnng frau hame ; 'Twas just twa weeks or three Sinco ho cam' buck, an' then ho asked, If thoy had heard o' mo. But oh, my Lady raged like mad, An' ca'od mo everything that's bad ; An' mid that if ho sought mo oot, Her faco ho no'er would soo. Then overy day ho took his gun, An' wander'd roon' tho placo; An' aye ho tried to hoar o' me, But couldna lind a tinco ; Until ao gloaming, uftor tea, Ho sauntered to tho rowan-tree ; And thoro bo saw a sight, thatdrovo Tho colour frno Iiis fnco. AB ho was walking down, ho heard A wailing cry o' pain, An' at tho Lochnn-sido ho found A woman and a wean. It was tho woo bit luiirnio'B cry Ho heard as ho was passing by, An' baith woro lying stiff un' cauld, An drookit wi' tho iain. Ho little thocht that it was ina That lay aforo him thoro, Till, lifting up my heed, ho saw Tho row'ns umang my hair. Ho kout tho baby was his ain ; Ho kent that sorrow, shame, and pain, Had diiiinad Ibu rod blood frao by cheoks, Au' diovo mo to despair. flo took tho infant in bisarais; Whiloconscionco gall'd him sora ; Woo Jonny »aid 'ho look'd liko death Wien ho gaed in tho door.' Hu laid it on his mother's knee ; lindo them male' basto, an' como for mu, ' For I was lying liko a corp Bosido tho Lcjchau-shoro. But oh ! tho doctor couldna suva My wean-my bonnie wean ; Mistress, I novor saw his match I'll novor soo'tagain. Ho died without a mother's kiss, Wi' nanu to comfort, nano to bless ; Fur oh ¡ hor heart was cauld us icc, An' hud ns ony stauo. Wuul, Jenny's nows just mada me waar : Thoy thocht that I would deo ; An' thon my lady brought her son To tait' farowcol o' mo. Them stood tho servants frau tho ha,' Wi' him an' hor umang thom o', Whon up I stnrtod liko a ghost, An' spoke twu words or throe. An' th'un ho kissed ibo bonnie boy Upon his mother's knee, An' told hor timi if 1 was deed, 'Twas him that murder'd mo ; But oh ! if 1 was spared in life, I yot would bo his own truo wifo. My lady sat wi' while, whilo lips, Bul nol one word said she. Thoy laid mo i my nin woo bed ; Tho doctor cam' an' saw Thal thoro was lifo intill ma yot, Bu* said my chanco wassma'. An' thon thu fovcr look my brain, An' a' gaod roon', an' roon' again; An' ayo whon ano was nt my aide, I thocht that thoro waa twa! It wasna mucklo that t said, I hadna breath for more, But little ns il was, it sent My lady lo tho door. I told thom a' I had to toll ; 1 said, sho was my Auntie Boll My mothor's twin'-;'twas nows to thom Thoy never heard afore. Wool, uftor a', I didna doo; I think I'm liko acal, I'm hurd to kill, My lady wished That I had joinod ' my brat,' Sho couldna boar my vory namo ; Sho said I brought disgrucoan' shame On beran' hors; 'twas lies I told ; But fow would credit that. For at tho kirk folk stared at us ; An' mony a ano has said, I should bo sister to tho laird, An' no his mother's maid. Wo worn ns liko as twa could ho ; Tho same bright hair, tho samo bluo'o'o ; Oh I if his heart hud boon as like, '. His vows would a' boen paid. ' But, no ! ho daurna ; soon I heard..- ' That baith wore gann nwa' His very servants sneered at him : Whon ho gaed through tho ha'. Thoy said that ho should mak' a etan', i An' spoult his mind oot liko a man ; ' . His mind's a weathercock,, that tums '?! Wi' a' tho winds that Uaw. Awool! awool I-thoy gaed, abroad, -, j. Au' loft mo lying thoro ¡ An' what cam' owor mo after that, ? . My lady. didna caro. If sho wus kind to mo, sho knew 1 Thut folk would think it a' WUB truo ; An'that it was her Bistor'p wean Sho'd driven lo despair. ; As soon as I was flt to walk, ? I cam'an'socht a placo ¡ But ovorybody looks as if . They kent o'my disgmco. I canna work, l eanna think, . An'if I try to sloop a wink, , I soo my mother-an' that ¡mk. Is ayo upon her fuco. Oh ! mother darling, could you seo, Sweet mothor, did you knew, In that Inst hour of agony YouBjiontwi' inobolow, Tho shamo, tho sorrow,- an' tho pain That lay aforo your orphnn wean, ' ? : - Nao wondor that you turned on ino 'flint look of spoechlesB woo. Oh ! yes, ma'am, I wmdd liko to pray, But damna trust mvscl', Tiioro's bitter foolings in my heart, An' tbochtsTm fcarod to toll. But, oh ! my mother is in heaven Her sorrows past, her Bins forgiven ; I'm suro that sho will plead wi' Him, For her sho lovod so woll. I daunia broatho His holy namo, Ho says it in not moot That tho sumo fountain should bring forth Tho bitter mid the sweet. Oh, dear ! I wish I could forgivo, But to tho latost day I live, I'll say, ho is a heartless knave, A coward, und a cheat ! Thoy say ho's got an English wifo, An' thinks nuo mair o' mo ; But thoro's a cloud upon his lifo Ho daurna chooso but seo. Ay, when ho's sleeping wi' his brido, llo'll dream about tho Iiochim-sido ; An' seo tho sieht ho saw that nicht Besido tho rowan-troo. An' if ho ovor lives to fool Her infant's balmy breath, A voico will whispor to this heart, Tho voico of Him, who saith, ' Vengeance is mino ; I will repay :' His living child will molt away ; And in its'place, ho'll seo his faco His, that was starved to death. An' now, ma'am, you maim lot ino go, Lifo is no lang for mo ; Au' I must roach that Lochnn-shoro, An' seo tho rowan-tree ; An' fling mo on tho caul', caul', stano, That lies aboon my bonnie wean ; Oh, mnybo thou, and maybe thero, Tho Lord will lot mo deo ! But still sho sits by her open chest, No longer stein and cold, And sadly round hor fingers twines Her baby curl of gold. A hopolcss lunatic is sho, With clusters from (ho rowan-troo, Gleaning amid her sunny hair, Liko intuios sot in gold. And still " in justice to hcrscl'," Her withering title she trios to tell, In sad unmeaning words ¡-nias, Boor Flora's talo is told.
