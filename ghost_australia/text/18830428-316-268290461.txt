Tins was a dangerous and .awkward charge to entrust to me, and I wished m my heart that the delicate confidence • had been, placed in some -more disinterested hands, -for I found mv heart in a strange place of excitement after the late interview-with the ; beautiful Sydney girl. My great disappointment at Edith's inconsistency—the proof of -which I had that day read from her own letter to my sister—instigated the sudden revolution in my feelings towards Winnie Gnaem.. Here was a charming creature, .equally if not more beautiful and accomplished than the one who deserted me, and, as I .suspected, she loved me more passionately, and. devotedly •than: ever Edith had. But how, was I to act m the present juncture ? Would ! become ; a traitor to my friend Hamilton, who. had placed such unbounded confidence in my fidelity. It was a hard struggle^ and the temptation I feared was beyond ray power of -withstanding or resisting. But lest my friend should suspect anythmg, some unfortunate voice whispered that I should go often to visit .Miss Graem. ..-..,. ,.... "I thank you for the confidence you place in me, Hamilton," said I,; " but these love affairs are rather delicate fubjects to interfere with. However, I shall use my advocacy in your favour so far as is consistent "with my own conscience." " That is right, Bloomfield; I shall qxpect no more. And now befpre\we.part I trust you will visit my uncle Graem any leisure hour - you find, for I have . bo many engagements that you cannot expect me to accompany you always, especiaUy at . business hours." : ,- I took leave of my friend, and directed my steps toward my hotel, where an invitation to the Governor's ball awaited me- Ivisited Graem's frequently, lor I found myself irresistibly attracted to the enchanted bower, where I freely drank intoxicating draughts o£ love. I became a great favourite with the rest of the &raem; family, for Hamilton's sake, among wfiom were young beautiful flowers budding, but none promising such charms as the. eldest displayed., I lived in Elysium during the few days which preceded the Governor's ball, and Edith Mowbray was ; almost entirely banished from my memory ;: but once or twice when I thought of her a sudden pang shot through my heart, and ah involuntary sigh escaped me, plainly telling me that she still held a deep hold on my affections. I had not betrayed the trust placed in me by Hamilton by a word. I iaithfuUy advocated his cause, but without avail. Winnie, msteadof inclining towards him, daily widened the breach, , and at last actually forbade my introducing the subjectataU. Alas for human nature. This resolve on her part pleased lather than disappointed me, for I had now more proof of the reason by which she was actuated. I felt flattered and lost. '',".;; * v" '..'; ."r-.M-' CHAl'TEIl XXXII. THIS GOVEIiMOB's BALLllie much-talked-of ball at length arrived, at which Her Majesty's new representative in Victoria entertamed the.then elite of thecolonv Much speculation had been indulged in of late m Melbourne as to the impression which the newly-arnved Governor would make oh. the public. His popularity m the colony, it was known, would entirely depend on sagacity and good government, qualities whioli his predecessor had failed to manifest. Elaborate preparations were made in the shape of purchasing dresses, especially by the fairer portion of the community, for the grand occasion. I arrived moderately early at GovermentHouse, the ball-room was fitted out for the occasion in magnificent style, and all thearrangements were carried out with taste and completeness. Ihe ladies were, dressed nn a . gorgeous and expensive style; but I was not a little proud to observe that the lovely Miss Graem excelled them all in beauty and brilliancy. The notice she attracted before she had Jong arrived was manifested among the group of gentlemen around me. • '• .': •.. 'Who is she?" said one- "My eyes, what a .stunner!" , exclaimed another. ' What a glorious creature. Does any one know her name? .'* asked a third- " Ask Bloomfield there," remarked one of my acquaintances 4 and an eager r crowd at once gathered round me, pressing me for the mshed-forinformation. :I answered with assumed indifference— • V-;".-.' -, i®?'!™'.-:^ \- "nf 1 kuowabout the ladyiB that her name is Miss Graem; and that she isaSydnev native." •" ••.';.-'• ;„.•;, , "By jingo," said one, "Ioften<heardof the oeautiful Sydney nitivesi^ntnevePta'til this moment had such proof" " Bloomfield.jts.^Iuc^ 'ae- Wainted with such a rare beauty," whispered another.

The consciousness ®au was loved in ietroa by tKe ftoknowledgea belle of theball; whose dazzling- loveliness at tracted so much attention, was sufficient to break down the harrier of reserve which ! had constructed for the sake of my friend Hamilton. • I shall leave my case in the hands of a jury of bachelors, who may have found themselves whirling in ihe. dance under circumstances similar to my .own. - I could not help acknowledging my-love.. Several times the image of Edith Mowbray, appeared, to my mind's eye;. but remembering how cruelly -she had deserted me, pr!de .eaeh'ime came io : my relief.- " Ah ! " I thought, " would shfe were ahere now to see the <jharmmg creature that leans on my .arm, • .and return the ,alTec:- tion which she has spurned."" " Twice I imagined, while meditating thus, that! caught a glunpse of the deep-blue.eyes which: had lundled my boyish love, and the same graceful figure m the person of a lady who whirled with her partner near us:; hut *! was too full of my own thoughts' to take much notice of the ..resemblance. ......•"' ; '. My arm supporting her waist, and hor hand rested upon my shoulder, while the other , was detained by me. . Thus we stood back out o£ the course of the dancers. I bent my face close lo her ear, saying— " I shall be very proud, 1 Winnie, of engaging, the greatest^^ heauty ; hCTe4Ms-:«vening "if ;slie ; . will only say tlie little word that my heart is yearning to hear." • : : - . Slie blushed and bent downher eyes, as if shunning : the gaze of, some one behind, m which direction her eyeswere turned, without; replymg .to my question. / " Wliat do you say, lovely one? Am I then mistaken in your.afleetion'? For pity.'s sake, reheve mo out of my misery." . ; A gentle pressure of both her hands interrupted the protestation, .anil she whispered— ,• " The lady behind will overhear. She is casting suspicious looks towards you." •:. ; ' i n .order "to; face a lady and gentleman who I knew. were, .standmg hke ourselves out of the dance to rest, when .my eyes encountered the same orbs which had flashed upon me -several times m : the waltz. Was it dreaming - or was 'it- the; ghost of Edith Mowbray which stood before' me? I was transfixed—unable to move;or. articulate a word. A stifled scream proceeded - from the lady, who but for her. partner's assistance would have fallen. Her: cheeks became yery .pale and she appeared as if about to faint.. Her partner assisted her out of the saloon,while I stood where I had first- seen, her m a most perfect state of bewilderment. Winniegazed at me'jn utter^ astomshmeiiti'. and her words," " Come into the airbrought me to my senses. . - • • . . Wilhngly," I replied, conducting her mechanically through the throng of loungers. " D o you know who that lady is •?" she en-: quired eagerly. " I think I do; hut I am not certain," I rephed evasively. • v- , " I noticed her several times -watching as dunng the waltz, - But what a lovely woman she is, far handsomer than poor me, although you flatter me so,", said slie, slightly pouting. " She is not handsomer Winnie;, of that I am positive ; buthere eomos your cousm; and he will find out who she is." When-the question was put to Hamilton, he exclaimed— . - - Bless you, that was Miss Mowbray, a connection ot the Governor's hy marriage: i Why, everybody is . crazy about her beauty.; I heard a lot of ^fellows arguing whether : she : or a certam other lady I know is the hand- i somer, and opinion seemed to be divided. But I believe she is engaged to the Private ! Secretary, Mr. Stanley, who is a nephew of the Governor. Why, what is the matter with j you, Bloomfield? You look as if you had seen ; a ghost." ; After leaving Winnie with- her mother,; Hamilton and I stepped into the refreshment- j room; I now remembered, that although I j had told him of my diaappomted love and the: fickleness of my fair one. I had never mentioned her name. - .Now when he was apprised of the facts he manifested great surprise. That Miss - Mowbray was still single cbhfoun- ' ded us, nor could we account for the mystery.. " Why, she has repented, Bloomfield; you'll. find that out yet. The fellow appears to be quite spoony about iher, sticking to her like a leech since they entered-the: hall; hut she does not seem to care very much, for him." : What is he like, Hamilton ? I was - so confounded that I never noticed his looks.*? . Why, I must confess he is a 'handsome, fellow, but not so manly m appearance, to my fancy as you are." . Our conversation was interrupted by several?' friends entering the room, ..amongst whom was the Colonial Treasurer, whl camp nearme, saying witliA significant smile—. ;. :.--. " Hullo, Bloon?iield,- you must , he in high: favor here. The Governor's private secretary was inquiring whether a gentleman of your name was at the ball to-night, when I answered him intlae affirmative. He -was also enquiring about some other name which I forget; but on hearing who you were he was I expect to hear you being sent for one of these fine days." •:•<•-• • ' •-. ': :• •' I guessed the .reason ot the private secretary's enquiries about me,' although I did<not satisfy the Treasurer on the subject. The reaction which suddenly took place in my feelings on beholding Edith. Mowbray so unexpectedly was most extraordinary. Although I had wished]her present several times that evening to witness my conquest of the beautiful Miss Graem, and to -see with what indifference Itoeatedherinoon6tancy,-wiiensbe actually stood before me I felt likea crimmali what had _ . and myself. However, on reverting to her letter I considered myself quite justffiedSnmy-. conduct and peiieetly free, rl debated with my- m self on the subject while returning to the ballroom, where I .-beheld, the object -of my ^ thoughts. . Mr. Stanley was still in her company; or rather was her.partner m a dance. On the next dance being about lo begin the gentleman, aftel a whisper from MissMowbray, approached me, introducingiilmself, andadding: " I have the pleasure of informing you that I am commissioned by Miss Mowbray. to, present her compliments, and ask that you will , ^ favor her with your company, as she has some news for you fropi your friends athome " . I ohserveS that MissMowbray, had-left,the" hall when Stanley cameio. me with the message, and when I accepted . the invitation lie' conducted .me to a .small apartment or /private room. On.entermg he announced ruy.name,, formally introducing me to Miss Mowbray, and' then quitted us. Edith was standing ? in . the ..centre of ihe; floSr, and approached me with a Sad: kind of smile, saying— " I am bappy ±o see you, Mr. Bloomfield, aftersuchalongBeparation.Ihope > been well since last I heard of you." "Eerfectly well, Miss Mowbray; you are welcome to Australia " ". Thank you..

Nearly all my friends had either died or gone to America, and the few who remained would not /countenance such a notable character as I had become; so Tilly and I thought it best to "bout ship,' and take up our quarters m the most hospitable and luolaest place we ever lived in.

You have certainly changed a good deal in appearance, and accumulated a fair proportion of flesh. But how is Mrs. Brown?" . "Bless you, she is as well as possible, and nearly as stout as I am myself. At this stage Mrs. Brown entered with a young Brown m her arms, who crowed lustily when he sawns.: His mother certainly looked as if hotelkeepmg agreed with her. She was much stouter than when I last saw her, bat had lost none of her good looks. . "When we had left the hotel after a.lejjgthy stay Edith told me that Mrs. Brown had recognised her as the Edwin Maxivell of the diggings, but that she had promised to say nothing on the subject to her husband, who did not suspect anything strange. Arriving at the, station after a long bat pleasant journey we were welcomed to the new house; which I had only completed a short while jirevious. I introduced Edith to my cousin Baxter, and saw a smile play .across her features as she thought doubtless of the part which his name had played, in .our late history. • Dan and his wife were the next persons to greet us. • "Ob, Gcad, miUc failthc, lady; xnay the blessings of St. Patrick pour upon your beautiful head," he exclaimed, with true Hibernian zest, as he took off his hat in deference to Edith.
