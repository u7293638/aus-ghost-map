The Gem I t»ke to be one of the most leniently-treaterf horBeB in the race. As a two-rear old he »u nearly if not quite first cla98. At that aS he won many times, and few who saw th» A.J.C. Champagne Stakes will forget th« terrific race he ran with Spinniagdale, when he was beaten only by -a neck, and finished in front of Somereet, Wheatear, Royal Maid and others. In the apring of the past season he was not himself, but I fully expeot to bm him show something like his old form, inthn event of which he will be "a bad 'an to beat." Piracy, like other good young <m«T has been badly used by Mr. Barnard, for though she ran well at the Hawkeabury m>b form was not good enough to entitle her to give The Gem a year and 5lb. seroal kUo» ance. Paul, before winning the handicap for three year olds at Rand wick, won two or three country races. This is a colt irom whom I anticipate some improvement, and in bim Mr. De MeBtre has a very worthy re presentative, perhaps the best in the Iferrua string. He is by Maribymong from Lady the dam of Timothy, and is therefore nearly related to Calamia, who is by Maribyrnoto from Luna, half siBter to Lady. He is more like Timothy than Calamia in shape, and la as courageous as any horse I ever saw. I shall never forget the manner in which he struggled home in the two races that he ran on the last day of the A.J.C. autumn meeting, and if he should happen to be with the leaders at the distance he will take a deal of shaking off from the distance home, wards. 1 think Orosvenor is treated moat unjustly. He ran at the A.J.C. autumu meeting, and displayed but moderate form, and why he Bhould be placed above good runners like BasBanio, Guesswork, ana Al lander iB something I cannot understand. Koh-i-noor 1 take to be nicely in at 7st 41b. Last year about this time, when Nappec Tandy was in excellent form, he aud Koh-i noor met at a difference of 81b., and after a desperate race Napper won by half a head. That the winner was on his beat behaviour was proved an hour afterwards, when he came forth and gave The Ghost and Bruno nearly 2sc., and beat them easily over seven furlongs. From that time 1 have always entertained great respect for Koh-i-noor, though he has never since shone so bril. liantly. He ran a good race in the dead heat with Mata in Adelaide, and of the horses ranging from 7et. 71b. to 7at. 41b., I like nothing so well as Koh-i-noor, Sauta ClauB, Gudarz, The Gem, Paul, and Lohen grin, all of whom, 1 think, hold the heavily weighted three year olds quite safe.
