Again there f-was neither a hurdle race nor a cross country .©vent »u which tho amateur could show their .'prowess, and tho elimination of tho latter must ?t>elookcd 'upottas a great mistake. Buroly tho Jwnting mon of Victoria ' aro sufficiently nrfmoroua to onsaro a good entry for the Hunt r. OJeb'r Gup.- to- -bo ran for oror tbo big; " jumps, and it is not to 'be believed that ' the-' mm. whoso riding made the ra:e so popular in fohnor years have left nb successors. Saturday's prolamine was tho worst ever.raced -through at Klomingtcu, and though', thanks to gelling -races, tho result was eatisfactoiy from a pecuQury -eohso, it cannot bo regarded as such r2rom -a- racing point of view. Business com trftetd with a selling raco over five furlongs, which- -saw. three at the post, and- Liddington .wnhtcout with odds on him. The issue was Ho ver in doubt, as, though Saxon struggled homo Vary camoly, he never could extend tbo favorite, who won very easily, and wai afterwards sold to ftLn J. B. Gill for £45. The Corinthian Flat Ataceinducod four competitors, and when it was pften tliat Paiileroo bod the services of young Air. Cos, he was quickly brought to tho bead pi the -ciaotations. Again backerj bad tho best oi it, as vx&ijlerco; jumped away with tho lead, and nover beaded, -winning in a canter by to length. Tho Flyiog - Stakes -bad a held '©f eighteen, and several of those engaged were well backed. Cupola eventually left olT favorite, tmt Tbo Ghost and Pyretle were also in good de ImandiTho raco was confined to.theso three, and a fine tussle ended in Cupola's favor by about half a dohgth.-.ThcGboet, who was second, being -the fBaino diatanoo.in front of Pyrettc. .

Black Jaaket. who'waB second favorito,. stuck to Black thorn tor a couplo of mileB, when he fell, and .the -former then camo home an easy winner, though Chippenham, a hunter looking groy, in .jHqwlos atablo, ran exceedingly well, considering His backward condition. Tholiruni Selling Stake?, with the novel condition that whatever the winner fetched was all to go to the club, came Best, -and .Bgerton, in a field of eight, was thought to 'lie tho correct thing. He raced \- prominently to the distance, whero Impulse shot vpon the insido, and won eavily by two lengths/ Oa the winner being submitted to auction there jras -some. .spirited bidding, and evontually she fetlto Mr. Hurtle Fisher for 130 guineas. The .concluding itom'of the day's sport, the Queen's Birthday Stakes, bad a numerous entry, and ont to-number ihinoteen welgbed'ont.

Paillcroo just got , Item e first iu front of The Ghost, but in doing so 'he-had a tittlo luck, as The Ghost'asaddle shifted tralf way in tho Qtraight,and his rider was nearly off approaching the winning post. The arrange snenta of the mcetio?, under Mr. C. W. Shaw, jtbe hon. socrotary oi the Hunt Club, were ad- jmrablo, and tho now caterer, Mr. C. D.
