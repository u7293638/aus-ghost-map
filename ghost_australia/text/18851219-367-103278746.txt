But "Ol( John Skelton" was not esuperstitioos. io had come to his farm-house, no he was wont to do, for business, to oco an old lawyer dOOeep in his confidenco--a sharp, hungry-facedo practitioner, a man whoO ver chi won w to llIa('hprlcIh , Iand who madeo his charges as stiff as his aged joints could maklo them. Josiah Hlu'rrison was, as we said, deop in old Skolton's confidenco, and in all hlis ccrlets of tho pnat. 1Ho was a nshrowd man of ibusiness, not too ecrupulou whlere moneoroy w0as to 1e madc, nor in tlhe mannor of its madking. le hal d assistedo John Skolton in his deep-laid plans when, twventy years before, Skelton, then a bailiff upon liartrham'0 land, had, by skilful choeating and manipulation, h]opt down the pricoes of his master's crolps o1r sold flhem for his own, pocketing thloe gains till hoe was ablo to tumr thelo old marn round his finger. Theno he cajolod himn into letting l him the Moor Forno, which fo, by vtoady Work and cultivltion, at thle expconse of his employer's other acros hald so lprepared for his recept on. T'hie older Bartram acquiesced, and, fuoll of (riumlph, Skolton took possession. Thle owner was fiast. going to decay, and Slolton modo a hold stroko. IHe pro poseod to free tohe mnan he iad so systematically ruined, from his debts, if he would consent to his marriago withl Alice Bartroam, his only dlughtlolr. P'oor Bartram 1had no clhoice; arnd, notwithltanding thIe potelss of hisl daughter and his son's thrctH), the wily solrpent gainoed his ends. I[o mtrricdl Alico in 111 hero youthlful lohouty, and thoughlt he hod done well. So ho hd a fiendos mnighlt do. But Fl'oank lartrnam, ber brotlheor, had threatened him, and 'Frank wasm in tlhe way. Io would, owhcn hoe came of age, bo in possession of the Moor Farm, foo' the lease would thlon expire, onil the yobung man made no secret of hisl determoioiotion to turn out Skolton. But he little know with whom he hlad to deal, Unfortunmatoly Frank Bartram was fonder of amnoement than of formling, andl Skclton saw this. l'anklc was then quite a young man, rand when one day after he hald boon carofully pumpedby his anstuto brothor-in-ln, so man0 y yeaonrs his sonior, the lad confessed he was in debt, lod bogged for assistance. lo hald beon occretly mnorriod. This help Skolton ldecidedly refooOd, point blonk. ITo did it with a purpose. Iis lfiendish mnind had laid a train, and he lkncew inmpletuous Frank would soon apply the fsoo. The youtlh was no nmatlch for the grown-ulo scoundrolel whlo hadll robbed the father rind lhadl stolon thie daughter. Skelton placedl temp totion in the boy's way. I'rcossed l oroly, and in fear of discovcery, whlichl he hnlow would kill his fathor, l'rankl foll inlo thle not woven aroulnd his foot. Io cashed a heavcy chlcouo intrustedl to him by Mr. SkHelton, orntd led; one lbot iontervieow with his sister, who in 'vain piileded for mercy from her brutal husblnd. " No," soid Skelton; "he must poaytho penalty, or leave thle country." oFrank had no choico in thle motteor. Rinaed, dis groacod, heo tolol hio foather all, and fled. 'lThe shockl oond thle disgraco coon told upon tho doting fatler, who olied within tfl year broken-hoartled, laving the farm and all ho could to .his daughtero for her life, :nod tlohen to his only anl beloved sono Franolr, lshould over he rotuoo.

The blrother had mado no objection when John Skulton oll'ered to educatoe is daughter, and trituted to a mutual liking. Forco was to lbe a list resourore. On this mating of thli cousin l had the pltrcnts not their minds- anid seals. So all was apparently arranged. John Skolton bad mado his will, and put it up in his fire-proof box with all his secret hoards in his turret chambter--the lihainted room. Why, of all nights, on that night did the memory of his wifo nndl his conduct to her brother rieo pll within his mind to reproach him. As hoe sat gazing upon the embers of the fast dying fire, the storm increauing outside, lie fancied ho detected a stop upon the garden path. llo sat upi and list(nedl !
