BRMA VI, A' WA RD. "LooK eastward," cried the watchman, "My master's lances gleam, The glorious beams of dawning day Upon his falchions stream ; Bee, glittering in uncertain light, Full many a spear at rest, While bright tile star of glory shines Upon each gallant breast I" But sho said, "It is the clouds that wait, Expectant round the orient gate, Refulgent in the dawning; He cometh not from thence." "Look northward," cried the watchman, h:." Whero mlountains meet the sky, The snow-white banners of my lord Rise up all gloriously; Across the mountain's rugged path Caught by the wind they sway, And seem to mingle with the clouds As fold by fold gives way I" But shte said, "It is the snowdrifts white Which over crown the mountain height, And glitter in the seushlino; IHe cometh not from thence." "Look southward," cried the watchman, "For now from thence I hear The thund'ring of the martial drum, And trumpets shrill and clear, And warlike charger's trampling hoof Triumphant spurn the ground, And clarions ringing in the shy With vict'ry's joyful sound I" But sheo said, "It is the south wind free That wantons with a restless sea, The waves impatient chaling ; (. He cometh not from thence." ",Look westward," cried the watchman, " For he will come to-night, The-twilight grey is dimming fast The long dull line of light. Yes, oven now I see him stand SDeside yon ancient stone, His armour glitters in the dusk, He comes to thero alono I" But slhe said, "It is a hoar.frost troe That rises up mysteriously \- And glimmers in the oeveing; He cometh not front thence." But when o'er earth and ocean Did holy vesper burn, As by the window still she watched To seo her lord return, A priest into the chamber came And to her whispered low, "Look heavenward, in that far-off land Thy warlior waits thee now." Then like a ghost that walks in white, She stole into the dim lamp.light, And sllo said unto tlo watchman, " Look forth no more to-night." -London Society.
