POLITICAL SNAPDRAGON. Come, dip in our bowl, and you'll find Our game is the rosiest one — A game which suits ev'ry man's mind, Who likes to mix profit with fun. Let's fill up the bowl and begin ; Here none will your vagaries mark ; We're all friends — together shut in — And snapdragon's played in the dark. Hurrah, for our bowl ! Do not spill it : Its liquor's the Spirit of Fame; Each plum is an Honor or Billet ; So plunge your hands into the flame. James Martin sits down on one side, And dips his hand in to the bottom ; But Bobertson's chuckling with pride — James dipp'd for the plums — but Jack's got 'em. Poor Parkes looks doleful and grim, He seems half afraid of the roast ; The light is too ghastly for him, It puts him in mind of his Ghost. There's Forster — his phiz wears a smile — Of comfort he always has crumbs — He dips in his cunningest style, And pulls out a handful of plums. Jeff. Eagar, you see, stands alone — Although on the bowl his glance lingers — He's wringing his hands, with a moan, For the old fellow's burnt his poor fingers.
