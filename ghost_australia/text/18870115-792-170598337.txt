A CURIOUS CASE. A rather curious case will shortly be heard before the tribunal of a German town, the original cause of which is a rat. It seems that, soma time ego, the house of an inhabitant of the town was invaded by a number of rats, and to get rid of them the following stratagem was resorted to. Tbe inmate of the bouse caught one of the intruders, tied a string of little beils round its neck, and let it go. Ttie rat, on regaining its liberty, went to rejoia its fellows, but the latter, scared by the jingling of the bells, fled from the house and sought domicile elsewhere. As for the one with the bells attached, it chose a neighbouring house for its abode, and it was this which led to the present lawsuit. The inmate of the bouse was awoke one night by the mysterious jingling of a bail, and, unable to account for the aouDd, he spoke about the matter to his family and household. The worthy people were extremely superstitious, and when on several succeeding nights tbe tinkling of bells was heatd distinctly by everyooe, ibe only conclusion that could be renchad waa that the house was haunted. Under this Impression the servants quitted their places, their mistress fell ill; in fact, to the peace and tranquillity that had formerly reigned, succeeded terror and alarm. Ultimately it chanced that the " ghost" â€”that is to say, the rat, was caught, and upon the much tormented family learning who had belled the creature, it was decided to bring an action against him to obtain compensation for all the worry his stratagem had occasioned his superstitious neighbours.
