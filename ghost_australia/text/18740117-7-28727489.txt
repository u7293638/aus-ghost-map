For the present, however, aa than is no help for It, our wine gtveers must submit to the affront they put upon them. Bnt they will not ultimately be without theirrevenge. Any further or future aMempt at a depredation of their wines will be unceremoniously stigmatised v a spedes of " Thuddieumlsm." The Directors of the Victorian Woollen and Cloth Manufacturing Company (the first estab lished In Geelong) have published their dx -1 teenth half-yearly report, which shows a profit of £3,632, after making very full allowance for repairs, depredation, and wear and tear. They recommend a dividend for the half-year of 8 per cent, only, believing it win be to the interest of the ■hanhoUen to allow the greater portion of the profits to accumulate, and be added to the capital stock. This, it will be remembered, is one of those Com pan If which sprang into existence without any protective doxy on woollen cloths being imposed in its favor. It grew spontaneously, as all Industries should be allowed to do, out of the wants of the people, and It could do very well without protection, for the aotual profits an larger than the balance-sheet declares. The wanton destruction of our State forests is engaging the attention of the Commissioner of Crown Lands. The quantity of timber those " destroying ansjels," those " demons of destruc tion" (aa the papers have been calling them), the sawyers and sputters "waste" in getting at what they" want" n prodigious. Their licence have allowed them to roam over the forests without let or MH**—, end wherever they go they leave behind obstructions to th* pro gress of others, and do not fan tofureishfud for the first bush fire that may be kindled. Attempts have been made now and then at the formation of temporary reserves, within which no timber should be cut, but these have hitherto proved fruitless, and over must do under the present free licensing system. Yet, to substJto.es for it the licensing of limited areas to particular individuals, with conditions as to the preservation of portiaus of the timber, would not be without Its difficulties, as Mr. Casey's übmwwmu the adnuntatraUon of the IfMiinr system under the Land Act must have tancbtsklsj. H« has, howevsr, just beonooavUU tothe aeighboffaood of someof the State forests, with this object, among others, in view, accom panied t^ the Seoretary of Agriculture; and, the result it is hoped will be the issue of more satisfactory and effective regulations which shall not only put an end to preset waste, but ensure the repbnting of the deoAaed lands. TheSenomiit banxkmi to have the statis tics for this year taken as qafeUyaa possible, especially the agricultural portion of them, lest the farmers and milters should be misled in thdr calculations, as they were bet year. It is not likely, however, that we shell get them for two months at bast. "The harvest," cays that journal, speaking of last season, " was a good one-the avenge high for Victoria; and five oat of dx interested In the matter con cluded that the grain market would be over crowded all the season, and the comparatively high price, so quickly attar harvest, would be speedily reduced; bnt month after month passed away, and all sorts of excuses were nude why (ha wheats did not came forward. The fact wsa, they were not In the oeaacry. Dm amage per acre was good, bnt tin acreage ttadf was most sswmfsWttgly reduced; b some of the wheat-growmg db trieta the area wider that grain was only half, and In others two-thirds of the usual extent, and wo believe It will be the came this." Whether so or not It b difisult to say. bnt I tndine to believe that It will not, notwith ataaaiag the authority on which the above opinion or belief b hasarded. At the same time it must be admitted that agriculture b ndther making the progress It should make herds, nor that we should all like to see it making.' There have been very conflb?n stsluicents here as to the result of oertain trials of Mr. IjeoaTs man* prow, ilns |iiubws. Wo have heard, for instance, Out meat oarelby this piuuucs was cent to sTngfand sad pronounced then perfectly unsaleable sad worthless. Bnt tills cam be searoely true, as Mr. ETcgus, Mr. LseursafMt, stated at n meeting, held at Scott's Hotd, on Tuesday test, that no ac counts had been reodved from England as to the meat cent there. However that may be, til* trU of tha meat preserved by tUsprooesi at Seottfc Hotel, oa Tuesday Ust. cannot be ptoo^unsod a success, In whatever light we re imtd U. "Hdtfcor the substance nor the tax tan of It was such as to make It a substitute for fresh ssaat, if fresh meat wore to be bad casOy." That was the opinion of a not un friendly critic; and farther trials wOl have to beTattoo before Mr. Lwni's praeeM will mb. plant those already In existence. In matters of tbb kind the public are not usually too exacting, but when the object b to promote the formation of n large Oompsny, they cannot be toooantiens. nnelojitafrcV?ngbnd will pro. bably be waited far before any «*aat progress b made with the proposed Company.

Httherto oar people have always been ready to respond to appeals of this kind, put forward In tns sacred manner of bumaalty and charity, bat shb, tt b too mush to be feared, b nothing more than a "plaudble pretext" for enlarged "opportunities of experi mental practice," which would lead to the gravitation of all the loathsome chronic diseases of the colony, a good deal of It brought on by recklsm faaprovidasM and grass, cdf • indnlganoe. to its centre.
