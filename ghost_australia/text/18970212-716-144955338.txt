the DEAD LOVER. The streets of the little mining town, with their steep sidewalks of flights oF steps and in clined plains, were bright with lights and gay with people- There was to be an old folks con cert at the hall, and the young people who were to participate, in 1heir quaint costumes ot brocade and lace, had congregated, with much fun and laughter, in the parlour of the one hotel, awaiting the time when they were to i ? i.^- *h»,r entrance to the roncert-rcom, the tnoac iua. v ? ? ? -- ? men from one side - and tho women from the other, in the way of days gone by. The enter tainmept was to close with a dance, tbe old folks bring in costume. Tbe girl« were flitting about tbe room, now pausing before tbe mirror to touch a powdered lock or to glance at a velret train. The young men, locking at first rather self-eonscious in their unaccustomed clothes, the silk coa^, i ruffled shirts, and short breeches, joiued tha mutual admiration society, and all was lively with jokes and laughter aud small rehearsals. A pretty girl with- fiuffy yellow hair and a white dress brocaded with silver was fiittiog about among grctups. inquiring — ' Where's Tom ? Have you seen Tom ? I do want to try our duet.' ' Lost Tom, Miss Amy ? ' laughed Harry Hastings. ' I declare you should take' boiler care of, your property than that.' j- * ' How do you know be m my property ?' * ' Ob, a little bird told me. Now see here ; if you'll promise me tbe second 'waltz to-night I'll go and look up the old fellow fur you. Si c; him since he dressed ? He ought to have lived in George Washington's time, be looks so well in those clothes. Tbe girl blushed and promised, and §arry started cn his quest. There was some confu sion and quite a little crowd about a doot farther down the hall, and as Hastings paused, Tim McLaughlin came from the room beyond. He was a very handsome young ooan, though his face now looked white and sol«niu. ' -I say, old boy, what's the row ?' the other called. ' You're wanted by a certain lady. Why, you look as if you had teen a ghost.' ' I have seen a man die.' ' Patterson ?' ?' Yes.' ' Well, that's rough. Consumption, wasn't it ?' ' Yes,' said Tom, briefly. He made a motion to go in the opposite direc tion from the parlour. Hastings detained him. ' Amy wants you.' ?' Tell her I'll be there presently.' ' Well, don't be long ; we are going over to the hall rery soon.' ! Tom went up to his room. The scene be had | just parsed through had put him out of tune : ' with tbe gay doings about bim. He could stiil I see the aet eyes and quivering chin of the man who had ditd, and he, too, was young. , When be went down to the parlour Amy was there alone, and decidedly cross. | ? 'I think it's too provoking of you, Tom ! ' | she pouted, fluttering her silver and white , plumage. ' They're all gone over, and there isn't time to try our duet. Where have you | been ? *' j * ' With pour Patterson : he bas just died.' ' Oh, how dreadful ! Kut I dou't see what made you go a visiting sick folk on tbe night of j ? our concert,' she said p:'ttisb!y. j The young man looked at her in surprise. I » ' Don t be cr«ss, dear,' he said. ' This thing S .has about upset mfr.' He was fasteaing hei \ cloak, and she made An impatient movement. : ''.I used to drop in to see him every evening j The poor fellow was a stranger fcere. and lone- | some. He came for bis health.

Any girl would ! Why, it will be just supper time, and 1 don't want to.be left without a partner.' i ' I could get someone — ' ( 'I don't want anybody but you. I don't believe that girl is mncb, coming here alone tc see him.' . 1 i Would you not do it for me, A»y ?' ' Don't go asking horrid questions ! Mamma wouldn t think of letting me.' 11 This poor giri hasn't any relations. She works in an office, Patterson tofd me. He thought everything of her. I don't see how you can help being sorry for her M Oh. I am Now Tom. don't be dis 'agreeable !' pouting, ' Come, we must go !' S Tom sighed, and tbey went out into the j [ anowy street. He could npt feel in touch witfc ! the gaiety. He found himself continually j thinking of that young life just gone, of the j young girl iournevinc .on in hnnntn find Something crept into his tenor solo that ni?hi 'which made people say, ' I didn't know Tom McLaughlin could sing like that : it fairly made me'e-ry.' Amy bad recovered her good nature. She laughed and danced and fli'ted about like 9 fairy. Tom took her to sapper and roosed himself to join in the gay talk. She thought he had forgotten their little difference. In tbe dusky hall, as they went back, she looked up at hire with shining eyes. ' Tom.' she whispered, ' do you know you're splcndidly handeome to-night 'f Fot answer be took her in his arms anc kissed her. ' y°® bear,' she laughed. ' Yeu'*-? cruaneo my areas.
