The House at 6.10 p m. aSjouriKd till n«xt **J- The motion of Mr. Parsons -respecting the North-West Bend Railway tariff was aegatired without a d^mon oa Wed aesday afternoon in fie Assembly after an interesting and entertaining debate The motion, which bss encumbered the ■otice-pajter for •evecal weate, was most ef^^rely dealt with by the Gom ■ussianer of Public Works, who plea santly bantered ifce mom about the •UTision^f faia eubjec& into the following lead*:—-Firstly, that the feting wool latee arajufair to farmers; escondly, that they are oncost to the taxpayers; thirdly, that the Morgan Railway rates are unfair to South Australian wool^rowers; and lastly, t34t,thiy are o«le« e<a mM*iltp •ecoretbe Riverina trade. It is difficult to Aecade whether Mr, Parso?9 was most wrong In his fa^ts or fallacious in his •rgoments. The rates for wool carriage tanenlly on om Tail ways are not lower bat considerably higher than the charges on wheat. Farther, with regard to the unfairness of the wool rates to fhe farmera) how preposterous to argue as if the rates of carnage should be proportioned to the value of the goods. According to this principle washed wool, peing worth about ttn times as much as Hour, ahajidpay atiiwtaad of 2Jd. per ton per mile, rod the rate from the North- Weet Bend to Fort Adelaide should be £10. Mr. Pa*ax?i4pe<na somehow to haw muddled up in bV^tnitd the questions of Carriage and tiTUion, but there is really a great difference l3tsreen enfore9d cantd bation to the natiooul revenue to meet the general expenssa of the Suts aid a enarge for specific s3tnc?3 rendered. A. Jcitiieaf ought to l>a able to dUtioguiiAi between a tax collector and a carrier. The apecial rates on the Morjan line a<-« no in justice to the faraietj, saj mote tbin to any other section of the community. It i« thought desirable ti hire a lower t-jilff on thai railway ia order t > s.^uw the Birerioa trade: this objest is bdoz accomplished, and thtt Una aho«3 a fair profit. How could, it pofuh|y befteQt the farmers to raise the r&tojydrjve; the trifiic away, and make a loss on the I:ne? If the Gorernment are TnistaVati is the ground* spoa wbicb they base this policy, at any rate that is *n affair that conceu > the *iiony generally . and not any one & iss in pirlkal v.' : Then it has not by the Uoolwa asFttatMS in this matter and their PiriiamentoT/ re presentativea been shown how the reduc tion of the tariff on the Morgan l;ne is an injustice to the rasp-yen. If the woJ were carried at a toes to pkiso the c :uat ters of Queensland and New South Wjles such a complaint would hare a solid foundation, but it is carried at a profit, and a redaction of the rat?? wa« necessary in order to get the wool to carry. Toe Go vernment in this matter are acting just as would be done by a prudent individual or any private association managed on cane principles. If the railways of the colony were in the hands of a company the directors would use their utmost endeavors tn induce the Darling and Murrumbidsee settlers to send their produce by the Morgan line, and would not be so mad as to lose that trade rather than bring their carriage rates down a little below what they chrjged in other parts of the colony, or having taken that step, so foolish as to reduce the tariff on the other lines without any necessity. We are not asserting that the Government ought not to reduce the charges on the carrnge of wheat, but that is a question that should be considered altogether apart from the Morgan Railway wool rates. The two matters are entirely distinct, and should not be mixed up together. With regard to the statement that the charges for wool carriage bm unfair to the waol growen of this colony, it is sufficient to observe tbat it is m ft f«<* that special favor is shown to the producers of the other colonies as compared with those of South. Australia. On every line except that between Morgan and Port Adelaide "Hie rates are uniform from' whatever! quarter the bales come, and even on that railway all wool loaded at the Hurray terminus is charged alike. ' The assertion that the reduced tariff is j ueeless as a means to secure the Riverina trade is opposed to the experience of the railway department since the reduction was made, to probability, and to the opinions of persons -well qualified to jut^e in New South Wales and Victoiia. The special object of the North-West Bend Railway fihould not be lost sight of. It was in tended to enable South Australia to recover the trade lost through the action of 'the Upper House upwards of a dozen yean ago in throwing, out the Murray Bail way Bill. ' It was constructed to enable us to carry on & competition with Victoiia for the Biverina traffic. Shortly after our line was opened a movement for the reduction of tates was started, because it was by practical men felt to be absurd that we should change more for carrying wool a hundred miles from Morgan tt Port: Adelaide than the Victorians did for con veying it 160 miles from ijchuca to Mel bourne, and oar Government yielded upon the merits of the question being brought plainly under their notice. It is said that Victoria will not be beaten, but will Etill further lower her Echuca railway chaigefc Let her do so. We are in a better position to canyon such a warfare, for we have the stream in our favor instead of against us. From the Darling mouth to Morgan tiie distance is hundreds of miles less than t3 Echuca, and our landline is sixty miles shorter than the Fchuca Railway. We can afford to cariy the wool at iower rates than the present and still make a profit; but a fresh re duction on the Echuca line means an addi tion to the wrong side of the profit and lossaccount. The tender concern the men? bers for Encounter Bay and some of their ]Af?di'?g constituents manifest for the poor farmers snd taxpayers is vet/ touching t3 those who believe in it, if rbere are pexcaos of such verdant hmoceace, but to ordinary perceptions, sHghfly uharpened by know ledge and experience, it is lather too trans parent. The interests of Goolwa and Victor Harbor are really what are con sidered to be at etaka,' and the affect" ■- appeals to the Satmete '• to 'i tike ere of tfcemeelres must ly _fb\ tiie hv^ become the subjects of meiiiment even among the honest counU^>sen who were at first somewhat worked upon by these voices from the south. Wupstraw msy be a very fimplc-minded fellow, but there h a limit to bis simplicity, and he ess see through a bidder just as well fs can either Mr. Parsons or the Mayor of Goolwa. The Paiftamwnt has lavished money pretty freely oa that place md Victor Harlor, and in return for the costly public works carried oat in tbat jpart of the country hqajieitfcer profit nor gratitude'to show, -itatbtiees the capabilities of Hum shipping^mges are well worth developing; bat aftw^irfl the affaire of the province ehojld not hi made eotitely subservient to the interebts«of the Encounter Bay disUkt. •" The forty days' fast of Dr. Tanrsr has been broapnt to ? successful termination, «nd Ac details of its progress and conclu sion are sow to LaiH. To judge from the copious septate in.

In Eng land telegraphic kidletias ii the mowing and evening- prints announced the hourly condition of the interesting patient, and beaty bet? were bdoked as to die socccss or failure of h;s experiment. In America Dr. Tanner'e levee become quite the faehion; the room in which he reposed on . faia little cot was dailj crowded by " beau- ' tifuuy dressed ladies" as well as gentlemen '. who flocked "to see the m«n who was. starving himself to death at 25 cents a : peep," and the papers telt u« that the pro gress of the fast cawed asmuch interest in the land as a Presidential election.

I Dr. Tanner k evd f* bs a native of Tunhridge Wells in Eojland, about 49 I years of age, and in h;9 time ts have been a bit of a rolling-stone. ThoD^h he led the New York ladies who hroujht b;m flowers to believe that he was a single man^ the persistency of American intarvlewers and reporters has ferreted out the fa-it th it there is a Mas. Tanner in existence, who alleges that she has been compelled to separate from her husband because she wm unwilling to be made the subject of his starvation experiments. He does not seem to be a member of any regular school t of medicine, but belongs to the class whom, be denominates "Eclectic," but wircb. the profession calls "quacks," sod it was only after he had been • coachbuilder, a green grocer, and bad "run an elestro-therms! bath," that he emerged as & full-blown medico. He had, it appaai-s, been in private training for titU event, and under the supervision of two medical men bad previously thereto fasted, forty two days at a stretch. Having thus convinced himself of the truth of his notion tbat contrary to existing theories the body could be nourished on water and "air alone for Hit least lorty dtija, he offere^ to'lfc^Semnlond, wlu? waa^SmJgeonJQen?* ral of < Am?i£can j armies doling the cwl war, to make proof of Iris assertion. „ \\\ It is unfortunate that the resUictionY which Dr. Hanmond insisted on i-npoeiEg if he undertook the eupeuisicn wen .so* strict as to6urFeii7ince,&c;^thatJ>r.T«nner would not submit to them, for though the preponderance of evident clears to point to the honesty of the experimentalist mod the efliciercy of fcis waichere, dus^hei tation in the oufcst dcs? not* fanii, to influence in his favor that por tion of the public who Lave to often been hoaxed with fasting girls and the like. Ultimately he was watched hj "Ecletic" medical men of his own choosing; and to judge from, their copious me "of ttomometers/djnatnonieteis, andepbygmo-' graphic tracings, they have bsen fairly' anxious to see that the conditions-were really complied ■with. For the£c?tfoffi-teei| days it would appear t&st; Dr.Xatiier did not swallow even a cup of cold wafcte&vbut; contented himself with rinsJEg k&autath; with a email quantity, which t? ctcrefaUj' measured both before and. after he had used it. Afterwards lie began to take copious draughts of water, and in accordance with his theory that air and water - were Ike: test J'fc-sufcUSnMs^ he indulged freely in aerated dxiatorwikh his stomach sometimes Rejected and'eome times retained. Though'M§ temperature did not greatly vary daring the ordeal bis temper did, for he is described as being ?•<taciturn, .gloomy, dispirited, peevish, savage, disputatious by turns." He eeems to have slept or -dozed a good paitof 4ha time, often 16 to 18 honra out of the S4, and intfae«ndhe only lost 36 Its. in weight; and what is more remarkable lie emerges from the experiment a smaller if. not % sadder man, for he is £ aid to have lost two inches in height.

Great complaint is made by the Tatiara ' Mail with respect to the inconvenience to which the people of Border Town are subjected from the present inegakmty of tb« m User* vice. ■« It is," says that paper, "someti-nes two hoars behind contract time before the mails are allowed to start from tfarracoorte. aad they are, as a matter of course, proportionately late when they arrive here. This entails great hardship on business people, for they must either remain up at night to reply to their earrespandeace or delay, then-letter* foracraple of dan. It ia bad jtnough to lie without a daily m%il, bos th« present state of things is un beatable, and we feel we hava only to place the matter before Mr. Told to have the grievance remedied. We have heard two sug gestions wfcioh might V sad vantage maly adopted. One is that the Adelaide willslie Border Town might be made up in that city, thereby avoiding the delay whioh takes place in Narracowta, where the Btelbouma anA South-"«lsra mtS's only would then have to bo sirted. Tne other i raggestlon is that as the Apslay mail nai only a abort stage to go ot sft'vit' tsrenty-two miles over a Kooa road, the U ler Towa miH —whioh has toltarsl fifty mQes over one of the wout 'roadi in the'cilooy—might get its bijj trfota ! that to Apsley.
