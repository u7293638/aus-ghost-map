" r he Man With a Box. *TWho wbb the man with tbo box? For the tbouenndth time did Doctor Collamoro ntk biniiiclt this quciilcn : (or thu thouxandili time did he ponder over the Brim couuu drum, till it seemed like a spectre haunting bim continually. Sleeping or wakiin;. an apparilion was ever by hie side, demanding now mournfully, now sternly, " Who am I V And this apparition was lho man with tbo box. If tho man was a mastery, tho box was nono the less one. From long gazing at it, the dots'.or had come to it as a kind of hideous, all-known-, g demon, which —il'.ht. open its lips and tell all, but could not bo I run.loto. .'Hut this was only fancy, for tho box, SB 'it ntfotl on the doctor'.? t.ibJp, wua an ordin. ary little enpket of mhhog.iny, with some of an Ku-em origin, perhttps, in itu curious carving, but to a cuhuhl glance a mere commonplace wooden box with a lock ami key. Yet a glance at thiH box was enough to bring to Doctor Oollamcre's mind thoughts of all tbat wus'dnrk, mystcriouH and un canny. ' Thu doctor sits b.lore it now, gazing over [ it at lho lurid aunect gradually dying into uruy. llebolds tbe key of the casket in his fingers, ns bo has so many times before in the last five yenr?, but he docs not open tbe box; he nev— has opened it. lie ia listen ing to a young girl, who loons her pule, lovely face agni nut hi? shoulder aa ebo Bpeaks to hiln in a low voice. "It is a strange, dark box, Unolc Frederick standing there so grim aud black between us and the bright sky." Tho doctor start?. ' *' Aro you thinking of the box, Adriinno?" "1 think of it often. I remember the night, five years Bgo, when it enrne to the hrinto. I remember tbat when 1 saw it first, standing on your table, tny heart sank, I kuow oot why, with a presentiment of impending misfortune. Tbo next night," auit her voioo sank to a whisper, " I beard that Malcolm bad disappeared—that he bad been robbed—murdered." "Malcolm? Co you still think of him J," " Could I forget?" " But Arthur Weston ?" " Ab, Arthur Weston 1 My dear oncle— my dear guardian—l must tell you. Arthur Weston has asked me to beoome bis wile; To-night be is to havo my answer." "'. " " And it will be ?" "The box sajs no." ? ... ?~ ... " Must you obey tha box 1" ' " ' '"? * "It not only commands mo—it impels me.

Oh, uncle, this seems fanoiful to >ou, who know tho history of the box, but to me it is vory real." " Alas, I know no more of its history than you. To _e it speaks only of horror, violenoo and orime. lint tell me, does it ever nay anything else to yon ?" " Yes. At tiraeo when I havo pondered long over tbe past it seems to say to me: ' Hope, Adrienne, hope I In good time I will open my lips; the sorrowful shall be made happy—the dead come baek to lilo. Hope I'" The doctor drew herclo?or to him. ? must know wb?t I huve never told to aDyoce —the story ol how I came by lho box. To night I do what I never havo done—with this key I open the box.. I lock thero for a revelation of terror ond crime. If' It'have for you any mestago of. hope and love, Heaven grant that you r_y receive, it. Listen," he said : '?'??*' "five ycais ago I beard that my broth—, whom I had not seen lor somo years, bad died, leaving yon, his only daughter, on orphan, dependent upon my care. I arranged that you should matemy. houeoj our.homo, and ono evening—five years ogo to-night— .While I was away to fulfil a professional—], gagemcht, you arrived-' When I 'returned yon were here I learned, also during, my a__„ young Malcolm Douglas had called .'upon you with, hia' friend' Arthur W?Blon. Those two young men, you told mo, had rq turnod from India not long before, where they bad'made their firtones. I learnod also that Malcolm was an accepted lover. : "1 was once moro called out, aud it .was late at night when I started for homo attain on foot. Ab I plodded on, thinking of tbo changes which would oomo from your living - among us, and for tho happiness I hoped for you in the husband I had never seen, I was recalled to myself by noiaes, lights and shouting. Looking about mo, half dazed, I found myself in tbe middle of tbe street; a oub drawn by two horses was bearing down upon me rapidly, Tho driver, vainly trying to obcok the animals, was calling to me. I ; was bewildered, and stood still till the horses, were almc st upnn me; in an instant I should; have boen knocked down when I . was snatched to one side just as the wheels of the, cab grazed my clothing. "y '- i " I looked up at my reaouer. .'llia olothos were torn and muddy, and 1 distinctly; remembered afterwards that etain? of—;pf— something red—.era c_ his bands.',;-", t .. '? " ' My dear sir, how can. 1 thank yyou' enough for your courage?'l said., '"It was nothing — nothing at.all,' bo replied. "'' '' ' j " ' Uut you havo saved my life at the risk' of your own.

" He placed tbe box in my hands, saying; "'Swear to me tbat you will never let anyone elso got possession of it; that you will never reveal bow it came into your possession, and tbat yon will never open it. I may call upon yon anytime for it; ill have not done so byjlvo years from to-night I absolve yon from your oath; you may open tho box nnd tell the story of reoeiving it from me. Do you swear to do this?' "'I swear.' " ? Then here is tbe box and a key. You may see me again eoon, or you may never see mo., Farewell 1' . . "When I readied home and thought over this adventure calmly, it did not take long to conclude that there was more of the comio than the tragio about it. So I put tba box away, and soon all thought of it was driven from _y mind by tbe startling events which had happened at thia time. " Malcolm Duuglas had disappeared. He had drawn all his rrionoy, amounting to ten thousand pounds, from the bank, and if the sea bad swallowed him up he could not have disappeared more totally, bis money ?ith him. As time went on and nothing was heard of him, the police took up the matter. Murdor ond rolbrry wue their theory, and they mado a fow arrests. Nothing oamo of them, however, til) suspicion fell upon the Hindoo servant, Kara —in. A man had been found who bad seen Malcolm tbat night in n lonely part of the city near tbo wharves, the man also stated that Maloolm seemed to bo followed by a small dark man—giving a very good description of Kara Nin. . But Arthur Weston Btepped in and affirmed that Kara Kin had been with bim tbat night at tho time whon Malcolm bad been seen near thq wharvo?. Tbia alibi upset the oarc against tha servant, and gave up the eeareh in despair, and Kara - iu smm after disappeared. " Thus it seemed that the disappearance of Maloolm Douglas was to be an unsolved mystciv; but it was then that dork virions began to rise up before me, and tho almost forgotten box began to take on tho -_slcr look it has ovcrsinoo worn. The breathless hurry of the man with the box, his anxiety to lid himself ot tho incriminating burden ; the very words he used about it; ihcaolrran oaths ho mado mo take—nothing oould seem lees oomio or in?igcifieant than this, whin I oamo to think of it, in eonrootlon with tho disappearance of Maloolm Douglss._ 1 have often started np in the dead of night and come to the box with the key in my hand, determined to open it and see what it con tained ; but my arm has always been stayed not by my oath, bnt by my feeling tbat tha timo hod not yet oomo —that tbe secret ot the bci v.-aR nit ti to f.-irccd from it. Hut I 1 hr-vealivsys felr, m-verthihts. that not a K—u_in,r—r the. Holier, but tho box, did have locked within 'its breast, the i_t_ of the ui_i>;-.nii:ci, of .Malcolm Douglau. '"Anauuw tho time has come; tonight the live years aie passed; 1 am absolved from my oath. I have told you the story of the box, so far as I know it; now I open it, and if it liqb any sccreta it mutt give,them up." Tho red sunset had almost fadod now, and left the box standing out blackly against the dead grey nky. The girl raised her bend a..d gazed earnestly at the casket. Then sho aroKe. " 1 will le.-ivo you. Undo Frederick," she said, " to open the box. . I know now whut you m_ havo at;—red through all these years with this knowledge. 1, too, havo r.uffored ; but to tno tho box has epoken words of conifcrt and hope; and to-ni.;ht I f.n-1 that ita prophrsics ore eo..n lo h.-ful filled.

Tho doctor lighted a wax taper and' set it on tho talie next to tho box. Then he took the boy, whioh wob fastened to a small crimson ribbco. and put it in the keyhole. As ho did bo a Hood of memories rushed over him. A nhudder parsed through the: doc tor's frame ; be turned tho key and'slowly lifted tha lid. .Tho light was dim ; the doc tor rai._d his ryes, and looking at the .win dow ho saw a sight which at first turned bis bloodcold. - : .' f.

The unit :i=jubiiy spoken of at trie head of lho herd. Ho is its head in mora —ntes than oi.iv He-i- __lord of tho harem, tho mostcr.sa tba'pas—re; and ha is tbe foun- Uin Lead of lho blood ot the next gei.cration, _ie briedtr naturally climates t?.e bull as _o halt in all his calculations. Not only as Due-half, but be is tlwajs on the lookout lo lee whether' in suoh an estimate ho ia not neatly under estimating the Lull's truo iu lucnce. If the bull ia a vigorous fellow, of lusty strength of body and of blood, tho bued.r may find that hia actual value in tho equation which reptestnts tho character of h-gct is a much lirgcr fraction than one half,'which is naturally assumed as a trial vulue. On the other hand, it tho bull is a weak, puny otiimal, of feeble constitution, snii of no potency in his inherited trait*, tho rtt-uli 111aypt.no tbut his 'p't.ptr value is a much lets one than at Hist usiuincd. This j may go so far as in some cases, to seem as if tho bull really icprcscntcd nothing moro than tho priLcinlu of life, and in giving his I calves being he had exhausted his powers. The degree of ability n bull has to stamp his get with, his own image is tho true exponent — bis worth. A lino animal of great prepo tency .18 the mo—valuablo of poseCFfiiousa man con bave. But in somo decree a bull's . breeding may depend on how be ia treated. However great the powers that nature may bavo endowed any gneu animal with, unless . that power is couterved and fostered it will be proportionately roduced.'nnd may even be itrophied and loet, by neglect and abuse. Tho larbo bull in good condition, represents in i each case an entirely different value. When i weakened by under-feeding, when made ; -Og£ish by over-feeding, tbo natural powers 'Df pocrcation are equally enfeebled and tho lapacity of the animal in a normal state of beolth is greatly reduced. Consequently, no Itriattcr bow admirable a bull is.no matter bow good a breeder, much of his buocoss in his herd depends on tba kiud of oaro and li(cattneot| bcrecti—s. ?..?—— i Begin with him early, both to develop his i:spi—ities and to guard against the'growth 'bf bad qualities. From tho earliest calf hood '.ho bull ought to bo accustomed to constant tad uninlermitting handling. A calf oannot. ?bo broken to halter too early, and if not ; broken early and kept at all times familiar ! with man ho may grow up uuroly, and the Ivcry oforta used to break in a young bull may bo tho oauEe of viciousnosa which will make bim a dangerous thing to handle or to bavo on tho farm. I have never raised s. vleioU? bull, and I am convinced if began oU ;eorly enough and handled quietly, hut firmly, ; 'a bull will never beoomo dangerous. Tue great thing is to hold bulla under roatraint .by' a constant exercise of authority which is" always kindly, bo that thoy oro never' .arou-d and so never havo their tempers ;provoked. If there is any sure way to ruin a 'bull 1 fancy it is by kicking and beating him : wbenevcr hois approached until he is in a Mato of unvarying irritation in tho preaonceof men. When onco bo is alive to tbe power ot bis latent temper tbo matter of subjugation is a very diulcult one, and one in which the element of danger is generally (of moio con eequei—o than tho valuo of tho bull. I lor one, would not bavo a bad bu|l on iny place. My practice is to tako tho bull calves away from tbo other cottlo when they aro about two or three months old and put them in a ?lot by themeelves. Until Bix months old thoy aro suckled by their mothers twice a day, and ere put in the stable nnd t— twi? a Joy. In tho euinmer they are put up in tba morning and fed, and then aro fed and turned out lato in tho evening ; while in tho iwinter tho rovcreo courso ia followed, and theyiore put up in the afternoon and fed and then fed beforo they aro turned out. This system of feeding is kept up tight along as tbo calve? approach maturity. Young bulls need to bo kopt growing well. They arc very apt to got out of ehapo at from nine to twelve montha old, and ought to bo fed freely and well, and bo kopt in a quiet place from tbo cows and nailers; for it is easy to cause young bulls to worry them selves and work all their flssh oS, and the best cars in othsr thinss will not suilisc to keep them in good condition. It is ono of :my cardinal principles that young bulls to ii—l thoroughly well must be kept perfectly ' quiot and apart. ? ? .A.Goot. Die-d_ — "Aro;,!. u'. going, to Imarry that horrid old Smitb,.
