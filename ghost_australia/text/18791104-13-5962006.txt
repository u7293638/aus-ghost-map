BAPTIST ASSOCIATION OF VICTORIA. 'The nineteenth annual session of the Baptist Association of Victoria was held in the Collins street Baptist Church last night. The proceedings were opened with prayer, after which, the Rev AS M 'POOLE the retiring chairman of the association briefly introduced the Rev. S Chapman, the chairman for the year 187!) 80 In so doing, Mr Poole acknowledged the kindness, forbearance, and hearty cooperation of all with whom he had to work during the past year The Rev S Cn WOMAN then came forward, and delivered an earnest and eloquent address on the work accomplished by the association during the past year, and its future prospects At the outset he remarked that since the last annual gathering of the association one of the associated ministers had passed from their ranks It would be impossible not to recall the familiar face and figure of the venerable Joseph Foy, who for many years had taken an active part in the labours of the association, and who, after long service, had now entered into the higher faculties of his Master Sincere, humble die out, Steadfast, it might confidently be said that whatever the measure of the talent entrusted to him, when the Master called, he found that talent had been well employed In anticipating the present series of meetings, and in considering his address, one circumstance, the Rev. S Chapman went on to say, had impressed itself upon his mind namely, the remarkable absence of special demands upon their attention and deliberation There was at present, so far as he knew, a great and a very welcome lack of what were sometimes called burning questions " This lack was a great advantage so far as the work of the present session was concerned, but in relation to his address, it might result in a tendency to indulge in that which was ordinary and commonplace, as he felt that there was nothing to defend, nothing to challenge, and nothing to vindicate In other years there had been something of novelty in the attacks made upon the common faith , but although he could not assert that unbelief was now less frequent or less emphatic than in days gone by, he certainly thought that it was less original, and that in this way it was showing decided symptoms of decline He did not know of any past onslaught upon the faith which had not been sufficiently repelled, and they had no desire to fight old battles over again Neither was their any special demand upon their attention in matters pertaining to that borderland where the political and religious spheres touched upon each other If the present session of the association had taken place a few months ago it was likely that the topic of our national education would have demanded from the association some united deliverance He did not believe, however, that it was a burning question now The attempt had been made to cause it to become one, but notwithstanding the application of flowing eloquence and hers Zealand was manifest that the fuel was damp, and that the question would not " burn -at least, for some time to come When it did it would be time enough for them to try to foster or to extinguish the flame, according to the direction in which the passing wind might seem likely to carry it It seemed, then, that they were free from the necessities of controversy laid upon them 111 former years That freedom had been purchased partly by the efforts of their predecessors, and it was also partly the result of the onward march of events, either way, it was a welcome gift from the source of all good Like all other gifts, it was a trust which should be so employed that it might result in glory to the Giver and advantage to the churches It was therefore his earnest desire for the present series of meetings, that while the minutes of the association might have no great measure to record, no startling incidents to relate, their 19th annual gathering might be remembered as a season when they ministered to each other's spiritual welfare, and when now power was given for our Saviours work in the present age He then briefly spoke of the service which the present time demanded from the Church of Christ which although unchanging and unchangeable was in an 111 tenor and jet practically important sense, ever varying according to the progress of the world's history '1 the church at large was called to seek and obtain a larger endow men of power, for the power actually possessed and exercised by the church was inadequate for the performance of her work in the present time 'his conviction, how ever arose not from the idea that the times were specially adverse to the work of the church, but from an emphatic belief of a ] precisely contrary) character At no other time did the principles of Christian morality more profoundly affect the commerce the legislation and the social life of the nations of the world But the present age demanded a broader, more energetic and more effective work from the church than in any period of its past history, and the question was whether the living church was equal to the Innes Mr Chapman then eloquently referred to the manner in which the providence of God had of late years opened the doors of the nations for the church 3 entrance 'I lies had often heard of this fact, but it might still be questioned whether its magnitude was ever appreciated, and still more, whether its deep significance had ever been apprehended As to its magnitude, the area of the church's work had expanded during the last century more widely than for 10 preceding centuries, and within the last 10 years more than during the whole period since the Reformation Within his time a man would have been thought an impracticable steamer who had expected to see the gospel preached in Rome or Nai les The evangelists of the Baptist body had long, been labouring in both those cities and more than once they had known excur '-one of their co-religionists to witness the 01 ening of Baptist churches under the shadow of the Vatican It should be no satisfaction however that the power of the church was not dechiiniL, for it needed to be augmented and strengthened In conclusion Mr Chapman remarked that he was told by his brethren of wide observation and long experience that there had never been a great revival of religion in this country since the day when it was first colonised He sincerely believed that the future history of this country where we had found such happy homes and of which we were so justly 1 road and especially the future history of the Church of Christ in this country, largely depended on our having a great revival of religion, and 111 having sent revival soon It was wanted before the foundations of this new world were absolutely Bet, and before (brave new nationalities were rigidly fixed Such a revival was required for these cases democracies before they became completely built up It was was ted for the thought and feeling of this southern hemisphere while their individuality was set callow and for the churches in this the great day of their opportunity and the great day of their re Eponsibihts He had no controversy what ever with those who maintained that the life and power of the church in Victoria would bear comparison with what was found else where It might be so It was not the maintenance, but the increase of the church s power that was the great need of the world The power promised was exceeding abundant, the power possessed and exercised was as certainly defective The power that was needed by the church for the work of the present time was none other than that of Pentecost It came not by wisdom, or wealth, or genius It came direct from the hand of the ascended Saviour, and was the gift of the Holy Ghost Pentecost was the endowment of power and praise, and prayer direct, intelligent impor taste, and believing, was now, as ever, the certain forerunner of Pentecost He trusted that God would pour out upon His people the spirit of supplication, for at every turn of our experience, in the face of every aspect of our work, 111 contact with our present oppor- tunities, and in prospect of our future re BponsibihtieB, the old petition was brought back, SO simple but SO deep, SO brief but so comprehensive, so easily repeated but so full of ever unfolding meaning, Lord, teach us to pray." The proceedings closed, with the benedic- tion.
