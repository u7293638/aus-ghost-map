THE CARDINAL ON THE PROTESTANT MISSIONS. TO THE EDITOR OF THE HERALD. SIR-The meeting hold a the Town Hall on Tuesday evening recalls the old maxim, " When you have a bad case, make sure to abuse the plaintiff's attorney " As far as I could glean from the reports in the public press, plentiful abuse has been meted out to me by the various speakers, but no attempt whatever has been made to reply to my otnttinouts regarding the Protestant missions in the islands of the Pacific What the ridiculous results of the meeting may be, it is not for me to say But it appears that the meeting of the prophets of Baal in olden times was the very t) pa of Tuesday ev orungV meeting "Shout lauder " was the admonition of Thus to the false prophets He would probably give the same advice to the conductors of the latest Protestant united service in the Town Hall Any statements that I have made in regard to the missions in the Pacific, so far from being contrary to the principles of Christianity and public morals), have had for their sole purpose to set matters in their tree light Preachers who have made large fortunes in these islands and their descendants, and those also who are interested in missionary collections will very naturally feel hurt at the truth being told Whilst, however, I use no) efforts to un- mask the humbug and exaggerated statements of missionary ad venturers I consider that it is the thanks of my Australian fellow citizens that I mont and not then censure At times, however, words have been imputed to me which I did not use in my speech at Redfern as reported in some of the newspapers, a specific charge was made against the Samoan missionary s That charge is the work of the reporters, and not mine I was particularly) rare ful to avoid referring to the missionaries on that occasion I have always said that, otigigudon tins niiB ston Hold, smell of earnestness, honest purpose, and good faith di sent to the highest commendation The 1 issues of such men will, I trust, be fruitful, and their work will remain the heritage of true mission aries but, viewed as a whole those Protestant illu- sions am manifest]) the work of man, and not the work of God To justify any haul ever is that I may have used I will endeavour, as briefly? as the occasion will allow, to present a picture of a few of those 1910-11 missions I do not expect to convert the promoters of Tuesday's meeting to them my only words are the prophet's advice, to which I have referred But I am confident that our respectable Protestant fellow citizens instead of taking office will be grateful to me for the sketch which I care I will begin within not only because it n n British colony, more closely connected wituAuR trading interests than the other island groups of the Pacific, but also because it is a mission field where many of the Wesleyan preachers have made their fortunes, and in which our Protestant friends take sincere pride An Anglican clergyman in 18%, writing of the Indian mission in " Parts of the Pacific's declared it to be " the noblest work of the kind that Christendom had ever witnessed " The Rev Mr f ever, in his Primer of Modern Missions '* (I 011 dou, 1856), styles it " one of the most impressive triumphs over the evil heart of man to be found in all its long and marvellous annals" HOT Mr Dennis proves it as an example of what God's grace has accomplished among IIB " And at a missionary meeting hold here in Sydney only a few months ago (March 1899.), a Wesleyan clergyman gave those missions unstinted praise " The trip on mission's he said, " was one of the grandest of the Christian era Its triumphs were not purpssFod by any mission of the work 1, either in the present or past centuries" Surely), then, I am justified in taking the Fijian mission is a test case the history of the first Protestant attempts to evangelise the Fijians may be briefly told in the year 1797 the famous missionary ship Duff landed 11 English and Scottish missionaries on one of the islands scarcely had the ship taken its departure, when one of the party began to prevaricate, and very BOOK by his open immorality h" scandalised not only his whitE friends but even the natives them selves In a few weeks he was found murdered in the native hut which he had made his home Another of the party named Mason avowed himself as ii had el and identifies himself with the pagan in five? In the words of the Rev. D. Brown in ' History of the Protestant Missions he " mingled with the hoUheii, showing a strong disposition to learn i other ways, in which he at length made a woeful proficiency, and threw off the mask oil Chnatiuuitv completely '* (Vol 2, page 200 ) Three of the other missionaries were murdered in quarrels that area The survivors took refuge in New South Wales, devoting themselves to pastoral I pursuits The UCP Dr Lang completes their history * Missionaries, " horses, who had been sent forth with the party ors of the British public and the benediction of the London Missionary Society, to convert the heathen in the numerous isles of the Pacific, mine at length found, converted themselves into H Urns of the fourth or fifth magnitude, in the constellations Aries and Taurus , or, in other words, in the shep- and cattle market of New South Wales " The only memorial that those first mu evenness left after them in I it was a forge It was probably the emblem of the craft in which most of them were hotter skilled than in preaching the Gospel The first Woslovini missionaries landed in Fiji in 1822, but the mission does not appear to have formally commenced till 133rd It is their boast that, through their efforts, within 20 years the whole island was practically) Christian, cannibalism being abolished, and no fewer than 120,000 natives being reckoned among the Church attendants the name, however, Bore its agreeable facts which go far to prove that the Wesley) an hour adopted by the name CB was rather in veneer for paganism than a sincere conversion Ever since I ip became a British colony some of the tribes have indulged in cannibalism It is not so long ago that a tribe refused to pay the cotton flax, and goo I Wesleyans though they claimed to be the kille I and into the European c Electors who ventured amongst them Indian I horn is tills of the iloiliiiR.i of the high chut Mualu with Mho nature minister, a man of great fervour, who became convinced after much study of the Scriptures that he was a saint and that angelic pott "run more conferred upon him " A British Blue Book as late as 1888 gives an account of the fanatic Naiosavakadna, who sought, without renouncing Wesleyanism, to cover all the old or] les of paganism in the words of the Royal Commission, he compounded a new religion out of the old Fijian myths and biblical stories" 1 thousands gathered round him, and it was only when he and more than a hundred of his followers more shot down that the new loan collapsed One of the last acts of Sir John Thurston, as Governor, was to crush a somewhat similar attempt at the rental of cannibalism and paganism the gradual decay of the population under the regime of the WA estovan missionaries cannot be questioned One Islam! which became a mission stronghold held in former times 2000 natives , it has at present scarcely 200 The missionaries in 1846 reckoned the Fijian population at 200, 000 In 1870, in the official Wesleyan report, the number of natives was estimated at 1 TO 000 Later, at the Vesle) an Jubilee celebration in 1885, the population is given it 16,000 The Government census in 1 Sill reports the field until o population its 104 862 The Statesman's Year Book for 1899 gives the latest official estimate na 99,773 Thus in half a century the population has dwindled to one half AS regards the number of Wesleyan adherents, from their original estimate of 120, 000 they had been reduced in 1870 to 105,000 , In July, 189, the secretary of the Australasian Wesleyan Society reports their total number as 93,000, whilst he reckons the Catholics at only 2000 However, the Statesman's Year Book just referred to sufficiently refutes the latter part of this statement, for it gives the number of Catholics in 1897 (the latest available official re- turns) as 932 i The Rev Mr Langham, as reported in the Sydney press on April 15, 1898, made the public announce ment that "the education of the Fijians was entirely in the hands of the Wesleyan Mission " Here we have a definite statement, but it is one which can easily be shown to be quite inconsistent with the facts of the case. The Bishop of Tyi, flight Rev Dr Vidal, when passing through Sydney in 1896, gave to the press a report of the Catholic Mission, in which he says that the 29 resident missionaries, all members of the Society of Mary, are assisted by a huge number of catechists m touching reading and writing, twice, as well as religion There were then set on Marist Brothers engaged in teaching, besides 110 native teachers i Here were also the European sisters and 17 native nuns At each missionary's ition there was a school, and these schools were w nil attended for instance, there were at the Wainki schools 100 children, at believe 100, at Cowan 70, at Kiewa 100 At the close of the preceding scholastic year the Chief Justice, who presided at the distribution of prizes pronounced a singular eulogy of the Catholic schools, as reported in the 1 IJI " Times " Among other things, he HOPE I have been exceedingly impressed with the good work which is being done among us by the sisters and brothers I think it must be a subject of great comfort to the parents to have here settled among us the hides of the convent, who devote time, energy, learning and the most delicate attention to the education of their girls It is evident to me that the Catholic inhabitants are exceedingly fortunate in having such schools and teachers for their children I wish tlioaO schools all the success that is due to the care and attention that is abundantly bestowed upon them I will only add to complete this picture that the Mules man's Year Book for 1899 gives the following Fijian details " One hundred and thirty-six: schools are conducted by the Roman Catholic Mission, the number of day scholars being i7(rt in 1897 Tilt Roman Catholic mission also maintains three schools for Europeans, at which 18 children received instruction during 1907 Those mission schools receive no State aid" What then becomes of the statement that Fijian education was entirely in the hands of the Wesleyans ' As I am speaking of statistics, I may here refer to another statement of Mr Langham, in which he has repeatedly laid very special stress The European Wesleyan clergy, he says, were but a handful compared with the numerous band of Catholic missionaries, and yet they have obtained the grandest results Now it is quite true that the European Wesleyan preachers are few, but that is only part of the truth, for they employ a whole army of natives, several of whom rank as missionaries the Rev James Calvert, Wesleyan missionary in Fiji for many years, in a narrative of it was carried on in those islands published soon in r his demise in 1892, gives the number of Woalo V ni agents " With only nine white missionaries," he writes, " we have dOll native preachers Sixty wool these are fully ordained to the work of the ministry " He adds that besides these " there are 3200 devoted class-loaders, who instruct the case chamers, and 2010 school teachers " Assuredly such an army of agents, each one of whom has his respective pay, must be supposed toaccompush a great deal in staying the progress of the Catholic mission The " Statesman's Year Book " for 1899 gives the statistical returns at the present day " The Wesleyan Mission establishment ' it safe, " comprises li European uiu^iounrtes, 70 native ministers, Go into chuts, 1077 teachers, 20421 rest preachers, sud 4684 oltU9>Ieg.äfit3," In contrast to this house only the Catholic array of missionaries is but scanty indeed. The " Statesman's Year Book " just referred to gives the following tissues. " The Roman Catholic mission has 28 European ministers, 180 native teachers, and 24 European sisters " The Wesleyans also boast of the number of churches and other religious edifices which, they have erected throughout the Fijian Islands Rev Mr Calvert states that in that there were " 1122 chapels and other preaching places " The " Statesman's Year Book" for 1913 gives the number as "972 churches and 339 other preaching places," in all Uli It is to be remarked, however, that the quality of the edifice is not always such is a spirit of religion would suggest for the House of God A victor to the IHIHIIIIHIH 1897 reports that many of the Wesleyan churches are mere native huts, but SO wretchedly constructed that even the native! would not use them for dwellings The marketable value of these so-called churches would not be more than sixpence each The natives of late years have begun to complain that the large amount which they contribute for religion is all spent on the missionaries and their wives and children, and that much of it goes abroad the contributions of the Wesleyan natives alone to the mission fund in six years, end- ing in 1896, amounted to very near £2 i,000 they may well ask what has been done with all this money) The Catholic natives, on the other hand, are asked to contribute but little, and that little is all scout for the ornament of religion and the benefit of the people At an assembly of chiefs, held some time ago, this complaint was thus forcibly expressed -" How does it happen that we have such poor churches for our religion-we who gave so much to our ministers-whilotho Catholics, who give nothing to their priests, have magnificent churches with turrets and bells " On that occasion it Wesleyan Roko, or provincial governor, from the eastern islands of the Archipelago, took occasion to pronounce his verdict " Our religion is not the true one it is a religion of money the true religion is the religion of the Catholic missionaries " Much might be said in proof that nominal Christianity is the main result also far as religion is concerned, of the Wesleyan missionary told in Fiji I may cite however, only Protestant witnesses that thus there may be no suspicion of reheat us bias in the statement! that one made Mr Dutton, in his " Pip in 1870" (published in Melbourne), gives an interesting account of his visit to those islands The conversion of the natives to Christi city was, he states, " a purely political step " necessitated by their obedience! to That cabin home tribes which succeeded in freeing themselves from his authority to sumed their pagan practices Of the Wesleyan and Roman Catholic missions he remarks " the Fijians, in their own concise way, distinguish the In of Faiths by calling the Wesleyan ' no long waiting that 19, the only religion, and the Roman Catholic 110 late Pope that is the Pope's religion ' " The great bulk of the Wesleyan com erts, he states, are nothing more than nominal Christians and he adds " under the missionary teachings the Fijians have made very little progress socially and politically, excepting, of course, in the abandonment of the worst outward horrors of heathenism ns caumluhsm, to Their way of living in the vast majority of cases is as filthy as it was in the heathen tunes and it seamans if in these matters they are almost incapable of improvement (Nor can the missionaries look forward to the future with much hope They see the I ijians booming worse instead of better Dmnkonuess is fearfully on the increase, and though the foul diseases of Lot open vice and over-crowding have not yet appeared in Fiji yet the natives are rapidly desire rising of one of the native chiefs who was most active in collecting for the missionary fund, he tells us that in point of morality he was " a very he allen and he relates of the king Thakombau himself that long after he had become a fervour Vi oslo) as he suggestively reminded au importunate European creditor that the flesh of the white man was is sweet as the ripe banana Dr Berthold seaman, who was Commissioner to Fiji in 1880 in his " Account of 11 Government Mission to the Fijian Islands " states that the Wesley an Missionary Society denied a revenue of £1200 a run from the sale of cocoanut oil, and that Mr Burner, a Wesleyan training master, onus large tracts of land, and a great many small islands " Of the until 0 teachers hun- rites that their conduct has often been in direct contradiction to their profession of Christianity" the conversions to Wesleyan Christianity were merely nominal He instances the people of buyers, who " embraced Cumtutnit), but when at 11 subsequent date the town rebelled against Bar they became apostates , nor did the restoration of peace make them relinquish their pagan religion, and they had at the time of our visit one of the finest temples 111 the whole group" One of the great crimes assured him " there were very few Christians in the group, and he hated hypocrisy) " The motive of belief assigned by a leading chief, as recorded by Browne in his "History of the Missions," harmonises with the account The Wesleyan missionary asked the chief did he believe in the Christian truths He replied ' cruel every thing is true that comes from the 11 bite man's country muskets, and guns, and powder are true, and your religion must be true " " Ten Months in the Fiji Islands," by) Mrs Smythe the 11 life of another Royal Commissioner to Fiji, tells us (page 173) that the Wesleyan missionaries in Fiji confine their efforts almost entirely to imparting religious instruction, ma! tug little or no attempt to touch the arts of civilised life She aids ' It is natural, lvhciotuibscriheis to mission societies are expectant of highly coloured reports, and s clamorous for a) carl) lure of converts, that the resistance should author direct their efforts to collect recruits than to train soldiers It appears to us that these converts presume a good deal on their profession of Christianity. ' Silo gives an amusing example of the imperfect acquaintance- " of the native preachers with their new religion An American settler at Lakemba, an important missionary Station, had shot out carried off a pig belonging to a native The tribe being Wesleyan converts de- parted their preacher to remonstrate with him. He touched his best cinema dress, and proceeding to the American s house set forth in a long harangue the enormity of the crime The American listened with respectful attention, and thanked the Treasurer for the forcible exhortation "But," he added,' thoughts just now baked, so you will please sit down and in- voke a blessing on what God has sent " The preacher, swayed by the irresistible love of all IYpaiis for roast pork, bowed his head and recited a long grace, after a which the two entrants made a hearty meal on the stolen pig Miss Gordon Cumming relates her experience at a Wesleyan Eorv ice in Vanua Balevu ' Our tend more) to laugh was only 1 conquered by our disgust, on seeing a regular verger armed with 11 long stick, who periodically rose from his knees and walked about administering a resounding blow to any young woman who has not doubled up but what bodies to consider the orthodox angle of devotion , while right in front of the pulpit has placed a bench, on which sat a son of the principal men, all dressed in hideous black coats and trousers and who never pretended to 1 noel at all, but the verger took care not to Bin them, and continued his disciplinarian attentions to the women ' At another mission feast at Vanua Levu who witnessed the fervent piety of an ex-cannibal convert He " crops close to Mr Langham (the celebrant), and then, as if he could not refrain, be put out his hand and stroked him down the thigh, licking his lips, and exclaiming with delight ' Oh, but you are nice and fat " Mr Julian Thomas, in " Cannibals and Convicts " (London, 1888), explains how it is that so many of the Fijian natives desire to he employed in the Wesleyan ministry " the position of a native minister," he says, " is one to be covered by his fellows It gives in many things as much power as that possessed by the chiefs The native pastor is always well fed, and bus always the prettiestwnTo The softest mat, the fattest pork, the biggest jam was his and the youngest and prettiest females awaited on him to do him honour " He met one of those native pastors on the river Rewa, sailing in magnificent style in a double canoe, sleeping on a couch, with two native maidens fanning him no could not forbear " suiiM'kuig him on the back, with the advice given by a bullock-driver to a late Governor of Victoria, ' You've got a very good billet, old chap , you stick to it " He gives the following specimen of the sermon of a native Fijian teacher " See what Christianity has done for us , we have a big ship to come and visit us, and bring us cloth and beads Mr, Brown has a big house, and is a powerful chief All this has been given us, then how good a thing Christianity is " An Anglican clergyman, who did duty for a time in Fiji in his work " Parts of the Pacific" (London, 1890), already referred to, states that even the high elliots who were conv cried had very erroneous ideas of Christian practice or Christian truth Ono high chief he says explained his belief in the Trinity as follows ' He had learned to believe in one true God, who had two sons, by nameD the Holy Ghost and Christ " Another very religious chief was so advanced in civilisation that he resolved to have a set of artificial teeth He insisted, however, on having the old tooth buried with full religious ritual, including a long sermon" In accordance with Fijian usage at a chief's interment in lordly banquet followed " Pigs galore were devoured by the numberless si sympathising friends, who had come to pay the last tribute of affection and respect to the lamented tenth. But an unexpected feeling or disapprobation suddenly marred the peace and solemnity of the proceedings, when it came to be known that the partiallj- intorrod gentleman had not only killed all his own hogs to supply the liberal To 3rd, but had robbed his neighbours' piggeries, too, far and near " to 20s) The same writer adds that " woman is still the inferior name is in Fiji Natives have not been Chris- tianised long enough yet for the woman to have been raised to the honourable position allotted to them by Christianity " Of the native Wesleyans at Levuka bo pronounces the favourable judgment " I am persuaded that the most fastidious missionaries of any sect would consider their salvation secured for were they not all clad in European clothing of the latest out " I will only add that a commission of inquiry in its report last year assigned immorality as one of the main causes of the decrease of population in Fiji Even the native chiefs had at times i complained of this, and at one of their cakes, or assemblies, they raised their voices against it When I referred to this latter fact in the beginning of last year, letters in the public press accused me of ciiliitnmatiiit' the Wesleyan Mission, and yet I was merely asserting a fact vouched for by Rev Mr Laugh on himself the "Fiji Times" published Mr Iaru,hurn'i report on the Wesleyan services at Banni ISM in which he refers to " the expulsion of a large number of Church members for immorality, an evil which we deeply regret to say is becoming of more frequent occurrence and is exerting such a baneful influence upon the social and religious life of many ground, that it seems to us that we shall not have done our duty until public attention has been directed to this Closing evil, and public opinion has been evoked against it We are thankful that the miners themselves have spoken strongly in their recent annual council against the existence and spread of this disgraceful immorality, and that some of our respectable colonists are also expressing their dear probation (fits toit 11 Don " This extract will be found in the "Sydney Morning Herald " of November 15, 1884 I To reference only of the roUgtonsaüusesthat« prevail I do not know that anything can borrow painful than the accounts which we read of th.
