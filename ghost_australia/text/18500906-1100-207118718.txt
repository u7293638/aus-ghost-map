APPEARANCE OF AN APPARITION. Ithas long been rumoured that the good ship Gipsy Queen, was haunted by some restless spirits, but Â«s it bad not been seen or heard for some time, it was imagined to be laid ; however, on the night of the 18th inst., it again made its appearance. The lamps were burning dim about 10 o'clock, when the inhabitants of the west and of the 'tween decks were alarmed by a noise in what be termed the chimney. They knew thieves would not enter that way, as both hatchways were open, and all began to think within themselves what it could be, when out glided a ghost of portly dimensions. It stood for a moment, looked round, grinned, and, gliding away forward, disappeared at the door of the third mate's store. Those who were not fright ened out of their wits by the supernatural appear ance, declare it was not the loug Irish ghost which appeared before, and assert that they could not be mistaken, as it was of low stature, thickset, had a face fringed with hair, round as the full moon, and a bull neck. It certainly must have been a spirit of very depraved smell, or it never could have come through the stream of foul air which issues from the Etna-like orifice on the poop. A. B,
