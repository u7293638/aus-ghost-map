THE GHOST AGAIN. to tub editor of the herald. Sill, — Please allow mo a small spaas in your valuable paper to warn the unemployed, wbo might be entrnpped by Mr Patterson's adver tisement for 200 men to spawl stono at Lance- held road for 9d per oubio yard, the stone to be reduced to five-inch metal. In the first place tha Btone is piled up in a heap about the size of Scott's Hotel, and is of a kind known as the genuine honey comb, and is totally unfit for anything, As a proof of what I state I mav tell you that two men (mates) went up last Friday. They commenced to break on Saturday; and when I left on Monday l.nat, about half-past 10 a.m., they had not broken four yards between them,' and they said they only wished ta earn enough to return to town, and that mon could not enrn enough to pay for one menl a day at suoh work. Such is tha work, Sir, that tho peoplo in power nre offering to the unemployed. A ehost surely to frighten them away, and I suppose when tbo House meets next that thoso people will bo able to tell tho advocates of the unemployed tbnt tbey (tho unemployed) do not want work. Besides, all men aro not stonebreakers. Inevor broke n yard in my life ; but of fair railway work, if road, or oleanlngs, or indeed any other klod of fair manual labor is offered, I am sure it will bo quickly responded to, I don't suppose thero will bo many applicants for bis atone.bremking, an i thou he oan blow about the ghost again, In conclusion, if he will find tools for tbo wood cutting, ha will Boon get mon to go, Men thnt have been out of work for months oaunot afford to buy a crosscut Bnw and nxe, which nro required for a job like that, to say nothing about mall and wedges. Hoping tbnt the powers that be will findusBomething else than making wood nod water Joeys of us, nnd thanking you for your kindness. — I ani. eta.. ONE OF THE HOBGOBLINS. iwBj'CvEuDQri
