A Ghost Story of To-day, The Rev. Augustus Jessopp, D D says the Pall Mall CaMe), has published in the Athenaeum a remarkable account of an apparition of which he was the witness in Lord Orford s library at Mannington Hall, Norfolk, in October last After dinner, the party having broken up at halfpast 10, Dr Jessopp retired to the library to take note of some of the rare books which it contains What befel him there he thus narrates -" By 11 o'clock I was the only person downstairs, and I was very soon busily at work and absorbed in my occupation The room in which I was writing was a large one, with a huge fireplace and a grand old chimney and it is needless to say that it is furnished with every comfort and luxury The library opens into this room, and I had to pass out from where I was sitting into this library and get upon a chair to reach the volumes I wanted to examine There were six small volumes in all I took them down, and placed them at my right hand in a little pile, and set to work sometimes reading, sometimes writing As I finished with a book I placed it in front of me there were four silver candlesticks upon the table, the candles nil burning and, as I am a chilly person, I Bit myself it one corner of the table with the fire at my left and at intervals, as I had finished with a book, I rose, knocked the fire together, and stood up to warm my feet I continued in this way at my risk till nearly 1 o'clock I had got on better than I expected, and I had only one more book to occupy me I rose, wound up my watch, and opened a bottle of seltzer Water, and I remember thinking to myself that I should get to bed by 2 after all I set to work at the last little book I had been engaged upon it about half an hour, and was just beginning to think that my work was drawing to a close, when, as I was actually writing, I saw a large white hand within a foot of my elbow Turning my head, there sat a figure of a somewhat large man, with his back to the fire, bending slightly over the table, and apparently examining the pile of books that I had been at work upon The man's face was turned away from me but I saw his closely cut reddish brown hair, his ear and shaved cheek, the eyebrow, the corner of the right eye, the side of the of arche id, and the large high cheekbone He was dressed in what I can only describe as a kind of ecclesiastical habit of thick corded silk or some such material, close up to the throat, and a narrow rim or edging, of about an inch broad, of satin or velvet, serving as a stand up collar, and fitting closet) the chin The right hand, which had first attracted my attention, was 1 caping, with out any great pressure, the left hand, both hands were in perfect repose, and the large blue veins of the right hand were conspicuous I remember thinking that the hand was like the hand of Velasquez s magnificent 'Dead Knight in the National Gallery I looked at my visitor for some seconds, and was perfectly sure that he was not a reality A thousand thoughts came crowding upon me, but not the least feeling of alarm or even uneasiness , curiosity and a strong interest were uppermost For in instant I felt eager to make a sketch of my friend, and I looked at a tray on my right for a pencil , then I thought, ' Upstairs I have a sketch book Shall I fetch it There be not, and I was fascinated , afraid, not of his staying, but lest he should go Stopping in my writing, I lifted my left hand from the paper, stretched it out to the pile of books, and moved the top one I cannot explain why I did this-my arm passed in front of the figure, and it vanished I was simply His appointed, and nothing more I went on with my writing, as if nothing had happened perhaps for another five minutes, and I had actually got to the last few words of what I had determined to extract when the figure appeared again, exactly in the same place and attitude as before I saw the hands close to my own , I turned my head again, to examine him more closely, and I was framing a sentence to address to him, when I discovered that I did not dare to speak I was afraid of the sound of my own voice Then he sat, and there But I I turned my head again to my work, and finished writing the two or three words I still had to write The paper and my notes are at this moment before, and exhibit not the slightest tremor or nervousneSs I could point out the words I was writing when the phantom came and when he disappeared Having finished my task, I shut the book and threw it on the table , it made a slight noise as it fell the figure vanished Throwing myself back in my chair, I sit for some seconds looking at the fire with a curious mixture of feeling, and I remember wondering whether my friend would come again, and if he did whether he would hide the fire from me then first there stole upon me a dread and a suspicion that I was beginning to lose my nerve I remember yawning , then I rose, lit my bedroom candle, took my books into the inner library, mounted the chair as before, and replaced live of the volumes , the sixth I brought back and laid upon the table where I had been writing when the phantom did me the honor to appear to me By this time I had lost all sense of uneasiness I blew out the four candles and matched off to bed, where I slept the sleep of the just or the guilty-I know not which-but I slept very soundly This is a simple and unvarnished narrative of facts Explanation, theory, or inference I leave to others THE EXPLANATION Subsequently (on January 17) the Atheneum published the following " We have been overwhelmed with letters regarding Dr Jes copp b narrative Several correspondents are anxious to know whether the ghost But on a real chair, whether there is any tradition of a ghost at Mannington Hall, c We print the two letters which offer the most plausible explanation Dr Wilks F. R. S. , of Guy's Hospital, write? to us "Putting aside the supposi- tion of a trick, the story resolves itself into the question whether the appearance of the man beside him (Dr Jessopp) was objective or subjective Under ordinary circumstances when we see an object the latter is material, and forms an image on the retina , this is mentally known through a per ce) tive part of the brain , the mere retinal image in not enough to constitute vision, as pictures are constantly painted upon the retina which are never discerned Now it is possible for this perceptive part of the brain to be thrown into in active condition quite independent of the normal stimulus conducted to it from the retina, and under these circumstances the person as I arently sees an object which by the law of our nature, is projected by him a certain distance before the eye This is common enough in fevers and in delirium tremens, where patients see people and animals around them whose reality is such that the memory of these becomes a part of the experience of their future lives In mental de rangements these hallucinations are also common, and patients see objects and bear voices which have no external existence So it is in our dreams, from which we may be suddenly aroused by a great noise where all is still around, the auditory perceptive centre of the brain having been abner madly excited In normal conditions the sight of an object implies the painting of it on the retina, as the hearing a noise implies the vibration of the drum of the ear If sight and hearing occur without these normal excitants of the nerves, the brain must have been stimulated from within, and the impressions are abnormal and subjective At the present time we have no knowledge that anything in the likeness of a ghost or anything that has not a material basis can excite an image on the retina , whereas we do know that under abnormal conditions the brain may be stimulated so as to produce a vi ual impression independent of any such image on the retina the probabilities are then immensely in favor of the appearance which the doctor Baw being subjective rather than objective We have only to suppose that those very common abnormal con actions of brain which are observed in bad health may occur under exceptional circumstances in in otherwise healthy organ to account for the occasional appearance of ghosts The probabilities are also in favor of this view from other considerations First, there seems no reason why the spirits of mother world should prefer midnight for their visits, but the reasons are obvious why we should conjure them up at that time Then, again, the want of individuality shown by this particular ghost an ordinary mortal would find it very difficult to put himself in exactly the same place and attitude as before on his appearance a second time, as this apparition did and then be dependent was it upon the observer, that when the latter put his arm up it was gone and the same occurred on the second occasion on another movement How these movements of the doctor could have affected a real object does not seem clear, nor why it could not be gazed at from dif- brent points of view. It may be noticed, too, that its nearness corresponded with the focussing of the doctor's eyes to objects close around him" Mr A Wilson, FRSE, writes - "As the narrator leaves explanation to others, will you permit me to remark that his experiences very aptly illustrate to my mind a simple and readily explicable case of subjective sensation ' As such, Dr Jessopp s ghost is ex plicable satisfactorily to the physiological mind on the idea that an image has been retained, and formed in his Right centres, and has been under sciously projected forwards from the background of consciousness to assume to the subject of the illusion) the A enable appearance of a human figure or spectre The well known case of Nicolai, the Royal Academician and bookseller of Berlin, is the best known recorded instance of similar visits ous and Sir David Brewster, in his history of Not iron Magic, gives the case of a Mrs A. , who was a ghost seer of somewhat remarkable kind Cases such as those illustrated by Dr Jessop and I by no means unknown in medical practice, and are explicable on the theory of reversion of the ordinary phenomena and routine of sensation The only point concerning which lilly dubiety exists seems too exacting in of the specific images which appear as the result of subjective sensory near n My own idea is that almost invariably the projected image is that of a person we have seen in reid about It is not uecessary(thatwo should remember the incident to reproduce it thin, for unconscious memory h a notable fact of mental life is Dr Jessopp s case there is one fact that seems to weigh materially in favor of the idea that the spectre which appeared to him in Lord Orford s library was an unconscious reproduction of some mental image or figure about which the doctor may very likely have concerned himself in the way of antiquarian study He describes the figure as dressed in the costume of a past age Does not this fact alone testify to the appropriateness of an antiquary 8 ' illusion ' being drawn by memory and imagination from the days of old and from the forms of the past ? Mental physiology has not yet sufficiently progressed to enable him to satisfactorily and fully explain the rationale of the mental acts which evolve the spectral illusions , but I would fain add, in conclusion, that such facts of mind as are already within our ken place cases like that of Dr Jessopp within the pale of a rational explanation , whilst our best thanks are due to the narrator for his record as an aid to the diffusion of a pint nuclei standing of 'ghosts' on a scientific basis '
