Lord Lyons again addressed Mr levy on 3rd Jimmu j Referring to the intense feeling excited in the colonies, to which the British Government attach very serious importance, he earnestly recommended his representations to the friendly consideration of the French Government On 6th January Lord Lyons spoke seriously to M Ferry the subject of the Relapsed Cumulais Bill, mil embodied the results of the conversation in the following interesting dispatch to Hail Glanville - ' I (Lord Lyons) said it will surely be Kit necessary for me to dwell on the subject if you are aware of the intensity of feeling with regard to it which is pi evading in the Australian colonies 'M Fox by answered that he must asking whether the emotion which appear d on the surf ice was genuine and sincere Was it not rather caused by a quest for the innovation of territory on the mud of the colonists than by any is it that he felt by them as to the tense quences of the transportation of a certain number of French criminals to New Clio doing I insWcicl that M Pony seemed to be putting the effect for the cause It was certain that one of the principal incentives in Australia to the annexation of the neighbouring islands was the fear that those islands might be converted into penal settlements by foreign Powers, 01 become the resort of escaped criminals from such settlements He has in on the subject of the proposed transport section of a chinaman population to New G iledonni was I could assure M Perry, perfectly sincere, and was growing in extent and intensity ' M deny answered that he really could not under stand the apprehension of which the colonists made so much noise He relapsed criminals who would be sent to New Caledonia would not be positive convicts Joint would not be numerous, and would be prohibited from quitting the island "I said that if I understood the bill correctly the persons who would be an inspector under it would be still more objectionable than the positive ever met They would be criminals who had proved incorrigible, but w out I not be shut up in a convict estiiblishin«ivt 01 kept under strict control They would be at liberty, 01 nearly so, on the island, and have great facilities for escape In mother i expect too, they seemed to me to bear a position which made them peculiarly obnoxious to the neighbouring British colonies Their departure for New Caledonia would be an offence rendering them (it subjects for a demand for their extradition If so, would the 1 reach authorities be sure in all cases to apply for their extradition Would then extradition he granted by the colonial authorities under the creamy laws and treaties ' "M Pony said that he was not prepared with an opinion on the question respecting the extradition If, however, the persons to inspected would all have been sentenced for serious offences, they would carry the effect of their sentence with them "I observed that the bill did not seem to make this clear on the contrary it would seem from it that the objects to whom it would be applied would be criminals who had worked out their sentences in France, and could not be liable to any other restrictions thin that of remaining in the island to which they were sent "M Perry answered that of course they would i render themselves liable to penalties if they quitted the island, and went on to say that he did not think that, after a! very many would be sent to New Caledonia There was a French population there which must not be swamped He thought that by far the greater number would go to Cayenne, a place which did not save the evil reputation it had for unhealthiness " I expressed a hope that in answer to the request made in my note of the 3rd instant he would enable me to assure his Majesty's Government that no relapsed criminals at all would be sent to New Caledonia "M Perry replied that he would examine the matter with a sincere desire to show- every consideration for the wishes of her Majesty's Government and the, feelings of the British colonists, but that of course he could not admit that any foreign country had a right to prevent France from sending her convicts to her on n colonies " I said that I had not wished to put the matter on this kind of footing As a rule, every man had a right to do what he liked with his own house, but it was surely reasonable to friend who lived next door to him that he should not make his house a danger to his neighbours Mr Perry repeated that he was sincerely desirous to show all reasonable consideration for the feelings of the British colonies ' An amusing defeat of the American spiritual list, Mr Bastian, is announced from Vienna, where (says the Pall Mall Gazette) for some time the eminent medium has been the cause of much discussion among the higher and highest classes of society.
