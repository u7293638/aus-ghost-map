IN A GARDEN. Paul in the pallid moonlight, White as the rose on her breast, She stoodlin the fair rose garden With her shy young love confessed. The roses climbed to kiss her; The violets, purple and sweeot, Breathed their despalir in the fragrance That bathed her beautiful feet. She stood there, stately and slender, Gold hair on her shoulders shed, Clothed all in white, like the visions, When thu living behold the dead. There, with liher lover Ibeside hier With life and with love she thrilled What mattered the world'swide sorrow To lher with liher joy fullilled? Next year, in the fair rose garden 1le waited, alone and dumb, If perclhance, from the silent country, The soul of the dead would come; To comfort the living andl loving With the ghost ot a lost delight, And thrill into quivering welcome Thie desolate brooding night i Till softly a wind from the distance Ilegan to blow and bIlow; The moon bent nnearer and nearer, And solemn, an i sweet, and slow, C:upe oa wonderful rapture of nulslp That turned to her voico ut last; Then a cold soft touch oin his forehead, Like the breath of theiwind that passed. Like the breath of the wind she touched him, Thin was lher voico nd cold; And, something thataceimed like ashladow, Slipped through his feverish hold. Bunt the voice said,', I love you, With my first love and m1IN, last;" Thien again that wonderfel music, And lie knew that lher soul lhad passed. b7
