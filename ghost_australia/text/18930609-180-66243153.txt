CORNISH CHARACTER SKETCHES. Last evening the Kev. G. B. Rowe deliver ed a lecture bearing the above title in the Premantle Town Hall. Mr. W, S. Pearse, M.L.A., presided, and there were also pres ent on the platform, the Revs. S. Bryant and W. A. Potts and Mr. G. B. Humble. The hall was three-quarters full, and the audience included the leading townspeople of the port. The chairman having, in am appropriate speech, introduced the lecturer, Mr. Eowe was received with hearty applause. The lecture lasted for about an hour and a half. The magic lantern views of Cornish and other scenery which have contributed to make the lecture famous, were unfortun ately omitted, but the pubject matter of the lecture ranged faom broad humor to deep pathos, and was intensely interesting. Mr. J&ove;'s clever affectation of Cornish dialect bespoke careful study, and at times a burst of rugged eloquence woul 1 evoke spontan eous applause from the audience. When in the humorous vein Mr. Rowe kept his hear eas in a Bimmer of laughter. One of the most pathetic hits was the story of how Marsh Guy Pearse became a preacher. A capital ghost story wound up the lecture. The proceedings concluded with a vote of thanks to the lecturer and the chairman.
