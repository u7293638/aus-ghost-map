VICE-ADMIRALTY COURT. Before the Honorable Sir liciloriek Darlot,, Judge Commiss try 1 ADJOURNED MOTION TO CONSOLIDATE suits IN RE THE MIOWERA THE APPLICATION DISMISSED or James, instructed by Messrs Richardson and Thompson, appeared for J and A Brown, who had lodged a claim against the owners of the Miowera for Lounge, and moved for an order to consolidate the suits against the vessel, numbering 10 Mr. Ralston, instructed by Mr Baxter Bruce, appeared for the owners of the vessel, and for the official receiver of the company appointed in England to wind up the company to which the Miowera belonged, and instructed by Messrs Johnson. Minter, Simpson, and Co , he also appeared for the mort gages of the vessel He said that as far as the son solid turn was concerned he raised no objection, as it might save expense the th et Justice I have considered this matter carefully since the adjournment, and I have some difficulty in consolidating a number of different suits raising different questions I should be very glad to do it if I could, but at present I do not see how I can do it Mr Ralston said he merely stated that as far as the parties he appeared for were concerned he did not object to the c solidation but he wished it to be understood I . his appearance was without prejudice to the lights of the official recent ever the mortgagee There would be an application later on to take certain steps The ii Hiding up order had been made in England, and his cohorts did not wish to prejudice any application they might make by appearing here The Chief Justice This becomes now a very important matter, because the Court has now been informed by Mr. Ralston that an official receiver had been appointed in England, and he foreshadows that an application will be made perhaps in the nature of a stay of proceedings pending the winding up in England I would, therefore, have to consider a very important question is to a way of proceedings against a ship seized under an order of this Court, and whether the claimants are entitled to be paid as a ghost that ship Dr Sly, who, instructed by Messrs Sly and Russell), appeared for certain claimants, truth the present action is as taken before the other claimants had been consulted, and no appearance had been entered when the notice of motion was taken out So for as they knew there was no intention to de- fend tim actions Some might be defended and others allowed to go by default, but in any case the application was premature, and the claimants he represented could not consent to it. The Chief Justice Is it supposed that the ship if sold here would not pay the amount of these TO claims P Mr James I understand that the amount will not be sufficient, as the mortgages are too high The Chief Justice Some of these claims may come before those of the mortgagees Dr. Sly said he understood that it was more than ample in the claims did not conflict with the mortgage, but if the mortgage care of it would not be sufficient to pay all the claims later Be they were amply protected, but until they could see whether the defendants admitted those claims or not his Honor had no material to go upon There would be 10 different suits and 10 different witnesses, and if his Honor would look at the endorsement to suit 1M he would see that plaintiff claimed £263 19s 4d, and of that amount £11.1 16s Id was for necessaries supplied to the Miowera, the Aorangi, and another vessel in the same day a suit 146 the claim was for necessaries supplied to the Aorangi, belonging to the owners of the Miowera So that the interests of the plaintiff might be conflicting if the mortgagee came in Mr James said he submitted that even if that were so it would be settled in the same way as other claims by reference to the Itogiatnn He pressed rule 27 upon the Court, and contended it was quite clear that all these claims except one were for goods supplied to the ship They could, therefore, be combined in one action, and there would be the same proof in each case The Chief Justice But the fact that they are necessaries will not establish that Mr James It would be just the same as if they were included in one long bill The Chief Justice But A might supply rope, B coal, and C something else, And how could their claims be consolidated in one action ? Such a case would not come within rule 27 Mr James referred to Court to the decision in the cases of the Strath Garry and the Willie u Hutt. The Chief Justice Have you any authority to show that half a dozen or more different claims can be consolidated F Mr James No , I have no authority on that point Mr Bradley said he appeared in this matter for Messrs Learmouth, Dickenson, and Co ; and would like to point out that the application seemed to him to be premature, because they did not yet know what the issues were Olio plea might be a plea in bar, and another might be a plea in confession and avoidance They did not know what the i vines were, and therefore they could not say that the issues were substantially the same Dr Sly submitted that the actions sought to be consolidated must depend upon the Mima facts The application was absolutely concluded by authority, and it was obvious that the object of consoled idea was to see that one set of facts should not be heard in several suits The real objection to the whole thing was that it was at prem store, and Mr Tatucj had supplied no authority upon which the Court could say that the actions should be consoled acid In all applications to consolidate it was a matter between plaintiff and defendant but an application by a plaintiff against his co plaintiffs had november board or before His Honor said he should be very glad if he could see his way to consoli- late such of these cases as were really against the same ship and for the same matter but it appeared to him in the first place that the objection taken by Mr. Bradley and also by Dr Sil s as fatal to the application, and that the 27th rule did not apply at present The proceeding was premature, and, moreover, he was of opinion that it should not be made at any time Exoil supposing it could be made, it was premature inasmuch as the Court did not know what issue was to be true in any one of those cases All he knew was that writs had been issued in these 10 cases, and he was informed that a writ had been issued though not yet executed in another case, and he did not know that the issues would be the same therefore, on the press d clause, this application must fail) but if he were to stop there are parties might think that if issue was joined between the parties and the issues determined an application of this sort could be made. In his opinion it could not be made even then He thought it would be found that the matter would resolve itself into this that actions could be consolidated where they were brought against the same defendant for the same cause of action. The Court might also direct that cross actions should be tried as one action, and the consolidation of several actions of a similar nature brought against the same defendant, if they were not made joint actions by the parties themselves That was clear in the case of claims by a captain and seamen for wages all joined in one action to recover wages due by a ship So in the case of salvage services A number of persons who had rendered salvage services to a vessel might join if they thought fit, in a joint action and if they brought separate actions the Judge might determine, is a matter of convenience and in order to MIVO oPpose to the parties, that they should be consolidated Again, in the case of a collision all the different persons injured by the collision might join in one action they Right, how ever bring separate actions, and then again it became a question for the Judge whether the actions should not be consolidated That was the principle to be deduced from the case of the Strath Garry P, and D (lb9o), following the case of the lA William Hutt, It 1 B, page 4 IS The first was an action for salvage, and the second was for collision but he could find no authority for consolidating a number of acts which could not be brought to stay, as was admittedly the case here if the, must be separate actions, he was not aware of any case in which the Court is id taken upon itself to say that a number of the cutters who had undercut claims-it might be for necessaries s. applied to a ship must be joined together and brilla a joint action to enforce, their separate chums in Coote on Admiralty Trachea he referred to the three cases in which the principle to which he had referred arose At page 111 he said, " As the law of the Count en- courages joint actions, so will the Court at any time after the return of the warrant consolidate actions brought by different parties against the same as when the plaint or demand arises out of the same circumstances, as in the case of separate actions brought by the same crew for their wages by the owners of a ship and the owners of her cargo for their several damages and losses or by distinct sets of salvors who have rendered services to the same vessel at the same time " Mr. James had admitted that after giving every consideration to the cases on the subject he had failed to discover a case in which where claimants brought different claims against the owners of the same ship for necessaries the Court had ordered that they should be tried together It might be very convenient in some cases that it should be done, but he could see in other cases where it would increase the costs In these circumstances the application must fm], and the applicants must necessarily pay the costs BROWN AND ANOTHER v CANADIAN AUSTRALIAN ROYAL MAIL SIL 1MSHIP COMPANY, LIM!
