MUSICAL GHOST ILLUSION. Professor Boasmard, at Hindley-street, is daily attracting well-pleased attendances to his mystical ghost illusion. The music by the Professor, representing a storm at sea and also the chime of bells, are well executed, and give a realistic representation of the originals. Vocal music is also pleasingly rendered. The " ghost's" peculiar antics afford much amusement. Presents are distributed.
