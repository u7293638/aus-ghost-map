S g p tis t O nion. T h e annual session of the Baptist Union was continued iu the Tabernacle yesterday afternoon and evening. In the afternoon Faster YTalton read a paper on ” How to N ourish Loyalty to oar Denominational Principles.” In the course of his remarks the speaker compared a man without nrinciple to a rudderless, captaining ship, the sport of cross currents, the plaything of every breese.with no defined course, no governing laws *f conduct, and in constant dangers from storms, sands, rocks, and tides. A man of principle was God's nobleman, His best handwork, and they could safely trust him. They knew where to find him, and what to expect of him. How to fo&ter; and strengthen fidelity to ihobc truths which express the governing forces of iheir religions life w**a sabjact of first importance. They were checked at times by seeing those who seemed to he pillar* on removing to other districts join readily with those who wore wide apart as the poles from them in religions principles and practices, and they asked in astonishment how it was that thote who had professed to believed that Christ’s kingdom is iqimfujJ in its nature, and who have stood for tbe “ Cron n rights of the King,” could join with those whose denominational maxims were in diametrical opposition 10 the sol© headship of Christ ? How often did even those who nbode with Oiem by contribution end •coaftioual attendance help on those who from their point of view ware tli* enemies ei tlie Cross of Christ, whilst toeir own denomination languished far want of needtni support. They knew that to be blindly intolerant dwarf* snd disfigures the soul more thau tongue could ivll, t u i Tharasaic bigotry w cruel and unlovely, but hs was only a bigot who perrecuted another holding different opinions to his own, and he who was steadfast to bis principles and allowed te another toe liberty he claimed for himself could uot b* thus characterised. They did not want to make their members and adherents intokr∋, b at steadfast to principles which they brhcrcd 10 he Scriptural, snd oonsaqnetitly Goi-given. The speaker reviewed the principles upon vrbivh they vliould insibt. They should imbue toeir people with n profound reverence for the \Yord of GoJ, try to impress them with a deep respeet for human nature, the right to worship God according to tbe dictates of their conscmnres and as they betiered the Scripture directs, and to inculcate right views of tke church of Christ. His commission, ” Go ye, therefore, "aud teach all nations, baptising ihem in the naioc of the Father and of tbe £011 snd of the Holy GUosst, teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I bav* coznzuanded you,” was practically an epitome of their principles and thr warrant. for their proptg&liou.; H* would urge on them the duty of being loyal to ihezsseJrefi sa d of nourishing the jam* spirit iu those whom God had placed in th* circle of tscir OurieLtn influence, Dibcussion on the paper foll*wed, and it wag decided that it should he printed in the D ay Star. The session then adjourned till toe evening. In the evening Pastor Wood delivered his retiring address, lie referred to tb* clouds of depression, commercial and spiritual, now being experienced, and to the loss the Church had sustained in th* death 01 the J&te; Pastor Spurgeon, its greatest preacher. Coining nearer home, they hod sustained n severe loss iu the death of the late M rGibsuu, of Native Point (the greatest giver in tho colony), to whose memory he paid a graceful "tribute.
