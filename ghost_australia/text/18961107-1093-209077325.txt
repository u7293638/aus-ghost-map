WAS IT A GHOST? Mr. Thomas Luca3 Smith, of Mansion House Chambers, London, \vrite3 to the London Standard under date September 25 as follows: â€”On Thursday I was stopping at the house of a friend at Brighton, and having remained up reading for some time after the family had gone to bed, I at last, it being nearly 12, pre pared to retire to rest. In going upstairs I appeared to catch a glimpse of a patohpfrpoqn light on-a wall by the window 011 tlie secoikl landing; As I drew nearer, to niy uffe'r astonishment, this gradually took the shape of a woman. The ghostly nature of this form was apparent, for the wall was clearly visible through the figure. The shape was that of a woman of about 30, tall, well formed, and clothed in some plain garment, which might have been a shroud. She was gazing earnestly into the grounds through the window, with a very sad expression upon her face. Suddenly, she cave a deep sigh of such utter lament that it startled me mors than .even the first sight of the apparition. Then her form grow indis tinct and in a few seconds vanished. I ex amined the wall, bub found no trace of anything abnormal. In the morn ing I related the strange adventure to my host, who was remarkably upset at my narrative. At his 'request, I refrain from naming tho precise house, as the property is for sale and publicity might do it harm. Ho stated, there was a family secret he could not reveal, and contented himself by asking me to inspect a certain picture in his possession. I was astounded to find the ghost and this por trait to exactly tally. The latter must have been at least 70 years old. I wait an "expla nation" from those scientists and conjurors who laugh at spiritualism. I know that my experience is real
