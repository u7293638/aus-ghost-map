Ghosts and Spirits. Since it is not only possible that persons can return from another world, bpf-V that there are well-authenticated ac counts of persons who have done so, must we, then, believe all 'the current stories about spirits and ghosts? By no means, for there is not one of them out of a thousand worthy of the least cre dance, or could stand the test of exam ination. They all, in almost every case, can be explained in a natural way, even those of the reality of which there ap pears to be little doubt. Fear and an excited imagination will conjure up im aginary apparitions and spectres. So will a gloomy and melancholy tempera ment. When the Puritans, of whom a gloom and melancholy were the charac teristic qualities) became the dominant power in England in 1649, we read that there was a wide spread fear of ghosts never known before in the land. Re morse of conscience, for great and un natural crimes will, too, bring up un- . real spectres threatening punishment or vengeance. The real ghosts, then, in ?- the past, beyond what a deluded imag ination painted, have been few and far between, and they promise to be so in the future. Nor is it necessary that there should he many ghosts, since we have, ' Moses and the prophets ' to direct and warn us, and do not need the spirit of n Lazarus to come from the 1 bosom of Abraham ' to do so. If, however, a genuine ghost should appear to any of us, which, after all, is possible to ask, perhaps, the assistance of our prayers, or otherwise to warn us, we need not feel the least alarm, particularly so if our conscience be at peace with God, for no ghost, no spirit, no apparition, not even a fancy, can do us any harm or injury unless by God's permission. â€” Catholic Hevietv.
