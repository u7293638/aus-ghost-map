COMMERCIAL. Advertiser and Chronicle Offices. Thursday evening, July 5. MONEY MARKET. Business is much interrupted by the break in the cable, which was as unexpected as it is unfortunate. The ghost of a chance that the misfortune is not the act of God, but of the misfortune is not the act of God. but of the Queen's enemies, intensifies the anxiety that is felt in regard to it and lost gives everybody tbatexensefor not completing basinet, trant ?ebans which always brings about a doll market, whenever it is available. In the event of war money would at once be dearer, an! so ?roold most of our commodities of import, whilst oar staple exports would possibly be cnnaiderahly redoosd in value, higher freurhts arottld rule, insurances would be very much increased by "war risks," and any rise, in ?heat mj, at home would be disoranted by the cost of getting it there.
