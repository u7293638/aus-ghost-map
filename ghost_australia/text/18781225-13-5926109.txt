WEDSESDA Y, DECEMBER 25,1878. Once more we are called on to cele- brate the great festival of the Christian year-to forgot for a time the strifes and divisions which ordinarily mark the life of the community, and to remember only our common brotherhood. In the opinion of some, this notable anniversary is lo-ing its significance. The free thought and unavoidable scepticism which cha- racterise the age have disturbed that implicittrustandblindconficlence in every detail of the biblical record concerning the day which at one time surrounded it with so many interesting associations. But it appears to us that while wo have had our faith shaken in some of the accessories which are said to havo accompanied the birth of Him who is properly styled the Saviour of Mankind, there never was a time when the, event itself was considered of more import- ance. Opinions may differ widely with regard to tho character of Jesus of Nazareth and the work he came to perform, but everyone continues to recognise the grandeur of His nature and the wonderful influence his example and his precepts havo exer- cised over the destinies of our race. And that influence is certain to remain, no matter how criticism may shatter the beliefs of our earlier days. "Whatever is good in society, whatever is pure and manly and merciful, has its root in the teachings of Him whose birthday we now celebrate. His precepts are inter- woven with the moral consciousness of mankind, and in this way, if in no other, the religion Ho established is destined to be immortal. When we last had the pleasure of wishing o.ur readers the compliments of this festive season, wo were unfortunately compelled to dwell upon the gloomy prospects which beset us on every hand. The Empire was on the verge of war. Look which way we might, it seemed impossible that England could avoid a contest with honour, and without honour wo do not supposo that many of our countrjnien deairo reposo Howovor thanks to tho firmness of Loid Bl .cons 1'illd, to a judicious mixturo of darin«' and conciliation, thodangoi passed away and England not only secured tho par' ticulai objects which weic essential to the economical

In the morning Henderson accompanied by his private secretary presented himself at the oflices of the P. and O. Company to engage a passage by the Assam, and met with a refusal. Mr F R Kendall was interviewed subsequently, but he would not commit himself to any reply as to whether pressure had been brought to bear upon him by the Government to keep Henderson off the Assam Hie ire of Henderson knew no bounds and the private secretary received orders on the spot to arrange for an indignation meeting to be held on Friday evening, to protest against the alleged interference with the liberty of the subject. Henderson visited Government house in the morning but His Excellency was engaged, and requested tho delegate to communicate his business in writing Henderson's private secretary, is now occupied in drafting a protest which His Excellency is to be requested to forward to the Secre- tary of State, calling attention to the circum- stances under which Henderson is denied egress from the colony.
