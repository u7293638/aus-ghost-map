Mrs Hiiniet llreclti'i'-StoAve. -X \ A TRIBUTE BY OLIVER WENDELL £..) ' ; HOLMES. A cable message reo.auly recorded the death of -Mrs Harriet Leecher-Stowe, the world-famed .nHhuivss of "Uncle Tom's Cabin." One of the most grace- tut tributes ever pmii t0 the literary work of Mrs Stove y.ms eoma.ined in the following lines Oliver Wendell Holmes: — Her lever was the wain"! of art, ller fulcrum was the human heart, Whence all unfailing aid is! She moved the earth! its thunder pealed. Its mountains shook, its t-mpies reeled Tiie blood-red fountains were unsealed, And Moloch sunk to Hades. All through the conflffit ;;p end down Marched Uncle Tom and old John Blown. One ghost, on,- f, inn ideal; And which was fa Is,- and which was true, And which was mighti, „£ Uie two, I lie wisoi't sihvi never i'.nrw,- - For both alik? were real. Fister the holy maid does well, AY ho counts her heads in convent cell, Where pale devotion lingers; F>ut she who serves the sufferer's needs, Whose prayers are spelled in living deeds, May trust the Lord will count her beads As well as human lingers. When Truth herself was slavery's slave, Thy hand the prisoned suppliant gave The rainbow wings of fiction. And Truth who soared, descends to-day. Bearing an angel's wreath away. Its lilies at thy feet to lay, With Heaven's own benediction. [?]
