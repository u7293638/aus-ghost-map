San was one or the crew of men sent out to 44 back fire ' (fight firo with fire), and be declares th*t their experience was most thrilling. While setting fire to a thicket that crowned a rocky ridge, he and his crew were Ktartled to find themselves suddenly in tbe midst of a lot of rattlesnakes. Tbo fcretst fire was advancing op the side of tho bill at a rspid rate. Its whistl ing, whirring sound as it devoured the hemlock torn was terrific, and the men wero btnt ou building a line of fire to start toward it, hoping I that when the two3inea met the fury of tlie I flames would be subdued lor laok of m^tei ia| vi\ \ wh|eb tp feed. It wps while thus employed tnat they ep countered the anabes. The ^roqud seemed to be literally alive with rattler*, the reptiles crawling iu the direction of a rocky bluff not more than one hundred yards distant. The men were all equipped with high*topped leather boots snd psid little herd to the snÂ» kes, stepping on them as though they were but harmless old sticks, Camiibell says that tbe rattling made by the reptiles eanld be heard above the roar of tbe distant flames. The *' backfire ' made by the jueo'cangbt dosens of crawlers and they wore burnod to doath. Camp bell ssjd be watched several of -the rattlers 'give up tbe ghost.' When tbe flames ad vanced so clow that the snakes aaw further es cape was impossible Ihey would coil op in a heap, darting ttieir beads angrily at tbo tongues of flsmp, then suddenly relapse, when the heat overcame them, ft moment Isfcr tP be devoured.
