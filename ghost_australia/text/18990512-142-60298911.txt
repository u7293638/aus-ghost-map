WIAT IS LJCK? ? A Kalgoorlie correspondent to an Adelaide paper writes :-" Do you be lieve in luck ? There are many people in this country who do net. Yet, 122 applications were made for 12 timber .lots thrown: open for selection in the Bridgetown' district. Each of these lots contains seven` square miles of timber, which is rented at £20 per square mile per year, and the erection of o saw-mill ensures the renewrl of the lease till the forest is as bare as a bald man's head.. You will note there were 12 lots, and 122 applications. A ballot, was taken, and Mr. Doherty, M.P., of Connor and Doherty, who applied for 9 lots, drew nine winning numbers, which secured for him 40,320 acres, and with concessions granted him later, now occupies the position of leaseholder of one of the largest and most valuable timber timber areas in Australia. The odds were 10 to one against his getting one lot, and any- price to a passion fruit seed against his getting a treble. But he draws the lot, the whole nine, and he will die a millionaire, if he does not die before he makes his money, just as sure as 'Charles Cameron Kingston is more than 18 inches high, and over seventy years of age. Luck? 'Great COesar's ghost. I would sooner have his luck than a signed and sealed icense --`,' t-.i I wonder what Ilcense tor - v..--.:..w... he fancies for the two Cups "--' " Financial Adviser." r True friendship is said to be like I good health; the value is not known s tntil it is lost. 'No one wishes to loose either," though, to prove the i maxim. Bonaparte's house at Longwood, St. Helena, is now a barn; the room he died in is a stable; and where the Im perial body lay in state may be found a machine for grinding corn. To be classed as a millionaire in the United States a man must be worth at least 1,000,000 dol.; in England he must have five times as much, or £1,000,000 ; in: Germany, 1,000,000 marks, or' £50,000. Leisure is a very pleasant: garment, but it is a had one for constant wear.
