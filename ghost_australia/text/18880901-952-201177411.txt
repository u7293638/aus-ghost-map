Out rushed tho party from the church, nnd the woman wns soon convoyed in by strong and willing hands, and laid on cushions hastily 'thrown down by, the stove. Mrs Buclfly quickly divested her of her head gear,. and uttered an exclamation of horror, while Sir Krnt-3t threw himself down by the prostrate form. ' '?'My wife, my darling, oh, wake and speak' to me.! Oh, God, grant that sho is not dead! Brandy or wine! (Juick, for Heaven's sake!' ' Lady AVnlden , by all that is mysterious !

She has only fainted from cold and exposure,' answered the rector, and the' young man was off Iiku a shot. And the rector was right. By and by, before the doctor could arrive, Lady J ustina opened her.oyes. They met her husband's full of love and anguish. She heard his :whispered 'endearments, and then her' little 'child's voice, half sobbing — ' ' Jtamma, darling mamma, I'm so glad you've come back ! Wake up and talk!' She smiled faintly, and closed her eyes again. Consciousness had returned, butshe whs too wenk to spenk. Rdith, ever thoughtful, rushed off to tha rectory, closely attended by the young squire before mentioned, who wns t):e ?chosen admirer of the rector's prettiest; daughter, and despatched the servants, some back to the church with ' shawls and pillows, some to M'aldeit Towers to prepare the housekeeper for her lady's return. That night, in her own rooms, which her 'husband had always kept in readiness for her return, with her child sleeping peace fully in her little cot near, and her husband's hand claspod in hers, Lady Justina heard how mistaken had been her hasty flight, and how, though he had been guilty of a moment's folly, Sir Ernest's love had never . strayed from her one moment. And iii return she told him that all this' timo sho had been teaching music in London' under a false nanin ; and how every Christmas Eve she had come down' to AValdeh Towers to see her child, and seeing thnt she was happy and cared for, she let her stay. This night, hearing accidentally that the party were nt the church, she had gone there, and fallen from the tree, faint with cold, and hunger, and exposure. ' Once, my dear husband, I saw you— yon passed me close as I hid in tho shrubbery, and, oh, how I longed to be with you— to hear you speak— to touch 5'our hand again, but T thought, ' Ho does not love me, ho is grievina now that he cannot marry his 'old love. I'onr Jnstinn will go away, and not trouble him again.'' 'Oh, hush, my love, my darling! you break my heart,' cried Sir Ernest. '1 novor loved her, never cared for her, or thought of any one but you, my own dear loving little wife. Do believe mo, and for give me. I have suffered enough for that moment's madness.' ' It is over, we will bury it. Oh, how glad 1 am to know you love me; and to be at home again !' Sir Krnest bent and kissed her fervently, and the blessed peace ho had once, before felt that night enme down with outspread wings, and over-shadowed them both. A really happy and merry Christmas— aye.and '' many of 'em,' were spent by the lord and lady of Walden Towers, the little Justina, and their small circle of true friends. Jealousy and suspicion were banished henceforth, and peace and love were the only welcome guests in their home.
