TO CORRESPONDENTS. * Criticus is very unreasonable in expecting from MR LANG any correct statement, or even any correct quotation. The rubbish which he palms upon Dean Swift is a mere travesiie of the satirist: ' One who swi'Is and puffs like booby Bets worth, Of whom lialf-a-crown would pay the sweat's wc^Xh..' The words are— * See at the bar the boob^Belteswortli, Tho' .ha 1 f-a-cro wn o'er pays his sweat's worth, Who knows in law nor text nor margent, Calls Singleton his Brother Sergeant!' Mr Lang's quotation is almost worse than Mrs Bramble** appeal to Qutn about the Ghost of Gimlet. gouts gtugtralian (Bmttt. ADELAIDE: THCRSDAT, JULY 10TH, 185£. •
