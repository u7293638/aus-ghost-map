SPORTING INTELLIGENCE. THE WINTER STEEPLECHASE MEETING. Saturday was the great day of the year for jumping horses at Flemington, and evidently this meeting is every year becoming more firmly established in the favour of racegoers. Notwithstanding the rain of the previous night, and the still threatening appearance of the sky, there was a great crush at Spencer- street about noon, the large majority of those intent on racing preferring to go out by rail rather than by road. The attendance was large at all of the three points that mark so many grades amongst the racing public, but the grand stand enclosure was proportionately more liberally patronised than any other part of the course. His Lxcellency the Governor nnd pnrty wero out earl), their arrival being announced by tho strains of the National Anthem Borne time before the firstrace started The Australian Military Band, under the baton ot Signor Kelman, was stationed on the terrace overlooking the lawn, and a meei).selected musicul programme was set clown for the afternoon Although the stirring incidents of a steeplechase meeting render the side aids to enjo)iuent less essen- tial than xv hen the cuni is filled with the tamer contests on the Hat, the requirement of a good luncheon, was not wanting, and although the patronage given to the caterer, Mr. C D. Strul er, exceeded anticipa- tions, no one had cause to complain of either the Hitiiu or the attendance in the long luncheon room beneath the stand. As reguids the rucmg, the rain of the night before, falling upon turf then in beautiful order, bad softened it considerably, und put many of the moro heav ii) weighted horses out of court The fact that a held of 14 horses saddled lor the Maiden Hurdle Race showed thnt umongst owners the race was considered open. Amongst the 3Oat division Haven was most fancied, but Hippogriff, who had Corrigan in the Baddlc, and a consequent 31b. more weight than the 9st. allotted to him, was the best backed horae in the lot The race was an inteiesting one, with only a single misadven- ture, furnished b) Oculist, who, when running well, fell over a hurdle at the back of the course. 'I he followers of the Dowling 1 orest jumueis, who in lins case were legion, commenced well, for Corrigan brought Hippogriff home mi eus) winner from Sea llree/e and Duration, the other placed horses. That the unmet should huvc sutheient pace to win a maiden hurdle race is not surprising when it IB remembered that nt one time the horse wes coiisidernbl) talked about lor last jeur'a Derby. 'Hie margin between a Hut raer-except of the weedy description- and a successful hurdle race horse has now almost eutuel} disappeared For the Maiden Steeple chase seven horses caine out, and amongst the riders in silk were two amateurs Backers in this race would speak of nothing but Reticent, and the liorfae proved himself quite worthy of their patronage After cantering behind Lady Ashton, who led for a great portion ol the journey, RÃ©ticent caught the mare in a few strides when his rider wished it, and won with the greatest com- fort. The emphatic success of Corngan's first mount to some extent allayed any doubts held about his second It certainly savoured of rashness to back a recruit in the hurdle racing ao heavily, even though he lind proved his ability to gallop tor a long distance on the Hut But the green mid white is n popular costume, and the public had followed it m this case taithlull), for Sheet Anchor was named in a great majority of the doubles taken on the two Grand National events tis well as being bucked out. Five to four tigamst the horse was ver) short odds in a held of 10. In his opening gallop SneetAnchorwentmuch more quietly than the Dowling Forest horses usually do. The Agent, looking bright and 6tout, cantered along as quietly as usual, but the popular opinion about the horse wns that on such a dil) his weight should keep lum back with some of the horses near the bottom of the card. The brown cliPBnut Tattler looked as likely an outsider us any thing in tho race. Alter they had gone about half a mile, Beauchamp riding apparently to orders on Guardfish took his horse to the front, and made the race a fast one If he did nothing more by these tactics, he probabiy destro)ednny chance that the favourite may have had of winning the race. Accidents were early recorded, lor entering on the Btretch of straight tunning b) the river side Star and 'J'nntn!i7er full over the same hurdle, lind only ono jockey rose with the horses. Croker, who rode Tantah/er, had fallen upon his head, and sustained con cussion of the brain The next tall put Omad liaun out of the rncc, and hampered the favourite. The former brought Batt) down ns tho horses were nbout to enter the straight for the second time The rider knowing his peril jumped away nnubjy to one side out of the way of the horses fol- lowing bim, but ns Oinudhauu floundered about Ins bridle rein was wound about Sheet Anchor's fetlock, so that Corn gan and his horse nearly came down. Possibly this had something to do with his subsequent running, for the horse was ever afterwards last In the second rouftd, Guardfish was driven ulong just as rapidly as at first, und towards the finish surviv ed the efforts of both Cockboat nnd Tattler to draw up even with him The Agent, who was ridden with great judgment by Ferguson, made his rush us the horses turned for the final run to the post, and m a few seconds the Adelaide jumper had the others quite at his mercy. \\\ hen his rider desired it the horse passed Guardfish easily, and won the Grand National Hurdle Race in a canter. Though the ring got oil comparatively lightly through the collapse of Sheet Anchor, it is not to be supposed that BO good a horse as The Agent was allowed to start without being entered largely in the books of the betting men, some of the wagers made about him running into four ligures Fourteen horses remained m to contest the great jumping prize of the year, the Grand Nationnl Steeplechase, and for Buch on event nny number of horses over ado/en aro ahvu)8 considered a large field. It wus rather a Btrange circumstance to find two horses from the same stable the best favourites in the race If this proved anything it was that the public believed both horses to be going on their merits, and that the better of them would win. Tho stable, it seemed, hal confidence in both, but their faith was firmest m the case of Mon en "While m training the pair lind been tried on the Dowling Forest course, when "Wymlet run olf and brought down Morven As it waa feared that he might repeat the trick now they backed the horse who was certain to stand up-and didnt lu the opening stretches Wymlet showed the more hie of the two, and was evidently m line con- dition lor such u mee Denmark, with his commanding carriage ol head and neck, looked a model jumping horse, but with the weight even such a prodigy ns he could only attinct the admiration, not the supportof the public Little Sailor, with his smiling coat and his rider so becomingly costumed in hoops of yellow and violet, mude a handsome equine picture , while the yet smaller Minerva was conspicuous by her very diminutiv eness It seemed strange in the race to see the pony carrying her accomplished rider safely ovir Buch burners as the palinga, the stone wall, and the logs, while such giants by com S anson as Mernder, Moonlight, and lorven came crashing clown behind her. No wonder the crowd gave Minerva a cheer when she cantered home, even though badly beaten 'Hie race was lull of disaster, ns seven good jumping horses in Granville, Mernder, Morven, Moonlight, Leo, Native, and Pi ogress ul! tell at different points of the rice, and riderless horses were to be seen ever) where To the onlookers the unpleasant incident of the race was when the three M 'B \- Merimer, Morven, and Moonlight-tell almost in a body over the stone wall Mr Watson and Scobie were thrown clear of danger on either side, mid Hill, riding Moonlight, had also his piece of good luck. Mr M'Grades horse struck the wall heavily, mid, tuiniiig n somersault, Iel! heavily on his back, but Hill was not in the saddle. 'J lie heavy shock which proved his salvation eliot lum clear away irom the hoise Leo and Prugress lived until they had passed the abat- toirs for the second time. Malone was carried to the ambulance waggon, the sheen of Ins blue Billten jacket in iking his face look very livid indeed Native was especially unfortunate, for after surviving all the perils of the double circuit, he came down just when a lew seconds moto would have seen him in the straight with u good lead of everything in the run home. Alter all the trouble the race re- solved itself into a three furlong gallop be- tween three jaded boises, and Wymlet, hav- ing better stamina than the little Sailor, beat him home and placed another Grand Na r'onnl Steeplechaser to the credit of his -'able uni his plucky rider It was a great performance on the patt of Denmark to come home third under the circumstances, and KildulT's cardinal jacket lind scarcely a speck of mud upon it, showing that ho lind been m front all through, and that his horse lind made no mistakes To those amongst the onlookers who had not backed the horse, and hail, therefore, no interest in seeing him punished, it did seem that the spurs vveie used upon Sailor with altogether unnecessary violence when it waa evident that he had no chanco of reaching Wv inlet The two remaining events, the Selling Hurdle Race and Flat Huco, were invested vv iib onl) a limited interest For the first, 3 lumboruugh, a tall chesnut, with the Dowling 1< orest polish about lum, waa made favourite, and Btarted at odds of 6 to 4 againut lum, Corrigan could only get him second, however, aa thp rnco waa a Rood thniR for the grey Student, who had sufiered to no decree by h ia exercise m the Grand National li urdla Knee 1 or the Tlat Kace, lavour, with Crack nell in the saddle, had a Btrong support, but he waa never prominent 'J he finmh was a line struggle between Plausible und 'Hie Ghotjt, and the latter won hy three quartern of a head.

SOUTH MELBOURNE V. FITZROY. Tho match pla} ed on Saturday afternoon between tho South Melbourno nnd Fitzroy first twenties, on tho South Melbourno Cricket-ground, drow an at- tendance of about 0,000 porsons. Three of tho best men ol tlio local team, narnelj, Elms (tho captain), li annoy t>ee( and BuBhcl) wero absent, their places bemg filled by other mon. Harper, tho vico captain, took command for tho afternoon. M'Shano led tho Fitzroy mon, and Mr. H. Wilson waa the ocntral umpire There was scarcely any wind, and with tho exception oÃ­ tho dull light the wcavhor was very suitable for football. Tho ground also was in capital order, its good surface tonnatlou having thrown off all effects of tho rcocut rain. Fitzroy won the toss, and elected to kick to the southern or lake end of tlio ground. Beforo tho game had pro* cceded a coupla of minutes Minchin obtained a mark, and hau a fair chance of kicking a goal, but he did not kick well, and nothing resulted from his effort. Immediately afterwords, hoÂ» ever, tho South Melbourne got the ball close up to tho Bouthcrn end. and M'Kenzio Licked tho first goal. When tho ball was started off again it was soon roturned towards the Fitzroy gaol, and play was kept up near it for a time. Tho visitors then transferred operations to the other end of the cnolosure, but the bail was quickly returned, Hill doing somo capital work for the South. A behind waa Bcorcd by the local team, Young having forwarded the ball well across the ground, and Worral!, who was plajing splendidly, tuen got tho ball away with the help of somo other of tue Fitzroy placera to the northern goal. Cooper was there favoured by Carroll with a mark within kicking distance, but onl> a behind the first for Fitzroy-was mado. Tho local team took possession of thu ball immediately it was sent off again, and forced it up tho mtddlo of tho ground. When It was a little moro than half way across Burns kicked on to M'Shano, and then hasten- ing on towards goal was in time to catch it close in and kick it through without any difficulty, making second goal for South Melbourno M'Kenzio soon afterwards had along shot for goal, and 6cond the second behind for tho local men, but for tlio noxt quarter of on hour the visitors played well, and put their opponents closely on the defensiva Worral!, Coleman, O Leary, and Muir wero scry effective during tho time named, and it was only through tho activo defensivo taotics of Hill and others playing back for the South that the Fitzroy linn wero pro- moted from making goals. They had four shots for it, but ali from long distances, and only a behind was obtained in each of tho attempts. Tho South Mel- bourne at last changed the scene of tho contest, and getting tho ball to the other end quickly mado 3 behinds, Parry, ono of their men, then got a mark in front within tho easiest of distances, but Instead of waiting to kick steadily turned round and only managed a behind. WJioti the boll rang for tho Interval South Melbourne had made 2 goals and Ã behinds, and Fitz- roy 0 behinds. After tho rest tho local men kicked towards tho northern goal and the visitors to the southern, and boforo play had been proceeding moro than a minute the ball was near the last-named goal. Dooberty there gavo a mark to Minchin, who by a drep kick Bcored goal from a dis tan co of about 40 yards Tho rest of tho gamo waa a continuous tri- umphal career for the Â¡south Melbourne. Minchin soon hao another mark within plajablo distance, and again scored goal nicely. Parry then bad an easy chanco and missed badly. Fitzroy once managed lo work tho ball gradually up the eot>t sido to near their opponents' goal, but it was then returned with rapidity to tho northern end, and M'Kcnrle, stand- ing in a favourable position In iront, obtained a mark from Docherty and put the ball through When 10 behinds had been made by the local | men, Dickcson, by one of tho long kicks for which ha | is famous, landed tho ball on tho ground just In front of goal, and Burns picked it up and kicked it through rapidly beforo any of the other side who wero near tutu could reach him. South Melbourno next mado four moro behinds and Fitzroy one, and then, principal!} by tho smartness of Worral 1 and Carroll, Larcw had a nlco chance from tho front, but missed. Tlio samo plaj er had a still more easy oppor- tunity just afterwards, but again missed badly. Tho SON on tli goal for South Al el bourne was mado by grand play on tho part of Burns. Ho secured a mark by lumping high above tho others, and then, "although 50 jrrda off, sent tho ball botwooii tho posta. Harpor mado the eighth coal for the South, and Burns tho ninth, and tlio gamo then closed, the scores being South Melbourne li goals 14 behinds. Fitzroy no goals 8 behinds Iho South Melbourno team general li played well, Burns, Minchin, Docherty, \oung, and Dccis being specially prominent. Worral!, Coleman, Carroll, and Muir did the most effective work for fitzroy. Mi. II. Wllsou was a good central umpire, WILLIAMSTOWN V. BALLARAT. Those clubs, under their respectivo captains, Laming and Graham, met on tho Williamstown ground on Saturday, in tho prcsotioo of about 1,600 persons. The ground was in good order for plaj. Ballarat won tho toss, and kicked towards the pavilion. Tho W11 Hamstovvn team made a vigorous start, and withiu five minutes from the commencement had scored a behind and a goal, tho latter kicked by W, H Jones Ballarat railed, and placed a behind to their credit. Somo out-of-bounds play followed Ballarat carried the ball dobo up to their opponents' posts, and Coram kicked a goal. Tho Williamstown re- sponded by kicking three behinds In rapid succession. At tins Btago of thu gamo two of tho local players Laming and ltivett-each attempting a mark, col- lided. Rivett, who was stunned by the concussion, was carried off tho ground, and was unable to play during tho remainder of tho game. When half timo was called tlio scoro stood :-Williamstown, 2 goals 8 behinds; Ballarat, 1 goal 1 behind. Tho visitors showed somo good play during tho ii ret few minutes of tlie second half, and the Williamstown goal waa thrico placed in danger, tinaliy Coram had a shot, which .resulted in a goal for Ballarat, A eeconu attempt for goal added a behind to tho visitors' score. Williamstown then carried tho ball to the opposite end of tho ground, and placed two boÂ« hinds to their credit. Soon afterwards Laming re- ceived a mark from Kennedy, and kicked third gool for Williamstown, llicn Smith marked woll In front, and tho fourth goal for tho local men resulted. Bal- larat made a determined effort to chango Die fortune of tho game Bub soon Fitzpatrick sent tho ball bo tween tho posts, scoring fifth goal for Williamstown. Ballarat mudo a final effort, forced the play close to their opponents' posts, and tho ball was being placed for a try w hen the bell rang. The gamo resulted In a win for Williamstown by & goals and 14 behinds, to Ballarat's 2 goals and 3 behinds. For the local team Joites(two), Smith, Sinclair, James, Ta>lor, Clark, and Maercll, aud for the visitors Boddicombo (tw o), Bryant, Graham, Christie, Coram, and Coulty were most con- spicuous Mr. Rickards proved an efficient and im- partial central umpire The following football matches were also played on Saturday :âWaverley v. Oakleigh, resulting in a drawâOakleigh 1 goal and 8 behinds to Waverley 1 goal 7 behinds ; South St. Kilda (second twenty) v.

A match was played on Saturday afternoon at the Richmond Cricket ground, between the New South Wales eleven and the team selected from those Vic- torian and English players who follow the rules of the Anglo-Australian football Association. In consequence of the principles of the game not being well understood, and the counter attractions elsewhere, the attendance was very small-not moro than 200 or 300 persons being present. Tho sides were better matched than on Thursday, and a fairly even game waa pla)ed throughout, both sides showing great spirit and determination to uphold tho laurels of their respectivo colonies As soon as tho bal! was put In motion, the Victorians rushed It forward and suc- ceeded in forcing it behind tho line twice In rapid suc- cession. This rebuff had the effect of rousing tlio visitors to their work, and thoy carried tho ball into thoir opponents* territory, and placed it behind. Soon afterwards Griffiths mode a good attempt to score for Sydney, but his efforts wero frustrated by tho activity of Lydiard. The play continued to bo con- fined to Victorian territory, and at length an oppor* I tunity of scoring waa afforded to Prinsep*, who | availed himself of It by putting the ball between the posts with a well di ree ted kick. Some plav of uti even character ensued, but tho gamo was delayed I through tho ball frequent.) going out of bounds, tho ground being very wot and sllppory. At last, through the exertions of Amson and Wero, tho ball was taken to the S)dnoy end, where Lvdfard socured tho first goal for Victoria Tho ball being set rolling again, tho visitors forced it towards the other end, but In doing so sont it out of bounds thrco or four times Griffiths obtained possession of tho ball, and quickly secured the second goal for New South Wolca. Shortly after Victoria was again successful in return- ing the ball to their opponents' territory, and two corners wero secured, but Amson failed in a shot for goal. The Sjdncy men showed great smartness In putting tho ball with thoir heads. Up to half time tho play was decidedly in favour of Now South Wales. May was resumed after half timo at 20 minutes post four, and tho visitors had the best of It, and for somo minutes kept the ball well down lu tho Victorian end. Tho Victorians then ran it donn to tho New South Wales goal. Gregory, bj two very good kicks, sent tho ball again to tho Tis Â¡tors' stronghold. It was, hovvovor, quickly returned, and after somo play near tho Victorian goal, Millington fouled, and a freo kick was given to tho visitors. A scrimmage ensued in goal, but Lydiard, tho Victorian goal ktoper, kept hold of the ball, and the local team managed to get it away without further loss Tho New Southe ales men now pla>od finely, Greig and Coombes Beomlng Invincible Victoria rallied, and the ball was sent to the Now South Wales end. Some fino pla) ensued lu the visitors' loft wing, and Yletorla tried twlco for goal, but, by tho vÂ¡guaneo of M'Qucen, thoir efforts were unsuccessful After some further play tho ball was rushed up to the New South Wales, end, and a good goal for Victoria waa scoured by Almond Gregory immediately after had a shot for goal, but failed, and time waa then can ed. The play in the second half was moro even than In the first, and tho game ended in a draw, both sides having secured two goals For New South Wales, Prinsep*, Griffiths, Giclg, Coombes, and M'O.uecn, and for Victoria Amson, Gibbs, Almond, AVaro, and Lydiard distin- guished thomselvca. DINNER TO THE NEW SOUTH. WALES FOOT- BALL TEAM. A dinner waa given by the Anglo-Australian Foot- ball Association at Clarke's Exchange Hotel, William street, on Saturday evening, to the New South Wales team now on a visit to Melbourne for the purpose of playing three intercolonial matches.

Gibbs, captain of the Anglo-Australian team, and about 58 sat down, including the visitors. The usual loyal toasts having been submitted, Mr. H H Smith proposed that of " Parliament," which was responded to by Mr Gaunson. Mr A. A Gibbs pro- posed " The Health of the Visiting Team ". The Anglo Australian Association had, he said, worked hard to make their visit a financial success, and their short stay a pleasant one, and he hoped that they would take away with them pleasing recollections of their sojourn in Melbourne. Mr H A Prinsep, on behalf of the New South Wales team, said they had done a good deal of footballing, but had never met with better or more hospitable treatment than had been shown to them during their present visit. Mr P McKinlay, who proposed "The Presidents and Vice Presidents of the Anglo-Austra- lian Association," said that the game of football, as played by their club, was the legitimate game, and Mr I C Teare, one of the vice presidents, in return- ing thanks remarked that the association was in a most flourishing condition, whilst the members gene rally displayed great energy and enthusiasm. Mr J. Almond having given the "Umpire and Referees," on behalf of whom Mr G Bisecker replied, Mr W.Ware proposed " The Ladies " and the toasts of " The Press 'and "The Chairman"followed, bringing the proceedings to a termination.
