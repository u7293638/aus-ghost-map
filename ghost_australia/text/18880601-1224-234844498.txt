aiaNes' Column. Spoken iii Anger. 'Twos bat a littlo void in anger spoken. While proud oyes flashed through bitter, burning tears : Bat ob, I folt that fatal word had broken The cord of lovo that bound our hearts for years. Tby, tortured face, that long, wild look of sorrow, Like somo palo ghost, musthaiint mo wbilo Ilivoj And yet, how bright, how full of joy tbo mor row, nnd I bnt breathed ono simple word — " Forgivo I " X did not hear tha tender volco appcnling, Nor marked thy anguish when I cried, " De-part 1" Too blind to ece thy pitying glance, reveal ing - The generous promptings of thy nobloheaTt. How could I know that faithful heart was yearning, . ' Though crushed and wounded to its inmost core, To take me back, like a weary bird return ing In fear nnd trembling, when the storm >s o'er. " Bemcmbor, love, that it may be forever ; To see ray face no more by night or day. , Bo calm, rash heart, think- well boforc we sever, Becall the angry word and bid ma stay." Dead silence fell ; the song-birds hashed their singing. " Enough," f proudly cried ; " I choose my fnte." While even through my maddened brain kept ringing Tho (leaili-knoll of my love— too Into, too late 1 " Forgive, forgive I " I walled, tho wild tears streaming, As, 'mid tho moaning trees, I stood alone ; "Love, let tby kisses wnko mo from my dreaming." Thy pleading voice, thy tortured face, wus gone. That angry word, I may recall it never ; For o'er tby narrow grave rank weeds hnvo grown. " ltemembcr, love, that it may bo forever." Ah, words prophetic I love, had I but known 1 My locks arc gray, my eyes nro dim with weeping, Tho fncp onco loved by thee, no lunger fair 1 Beneath tho daisies thou art calmly sleep ing! Thcro a Iono woman often kneels in prayer. Ab, sweetheart mine, thon art so lowly lying, Thou canst not hear tho tearful voice above. That with the nigbt wind overmoro is sigh ing, " I spoke iu anger j oh, forgivo mo, love I " — 1'nnn'j tWrc.ter,
