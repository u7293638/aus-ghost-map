—• . Erin-go-Bragh! . Recent Ireland v. Scotland athletic meeting at Dublin was a big take-down for Sandy, who was beaten in -nine events out of eleven, including even the Caledonian specialities of hammer-throwing and weight-putting. , Write Ichabod! also Erin-go-Bragh, begerrah! Acushla machree! and other things of that sort, whatever they may mean, for Sandy is a decadent race— their glory has departed. Their backs are weak through picking up the " siller," ye ken. Their "airms"— that is how they spell it in Haggis Land—are atrophied through driving quills instead of ploughs; their legs, once bare to " a' the airts that blaw," are covered by unseemly breeks or .trews; and. their manIv strength all gone down before the Southron Celt. Ossian arise, and lament in long, loud poetic verse the fall of the glorious • men of old! Gather the ghosts of the clans in the glens, and send them , to chide the tardy spirits of the modern Scot! • Pass round the haggis and the bagpipe! and here's mine: . " Scots *wha hae wi' Wallace bled, Ye'll be your pint stoup, Eise pot your graves, your glory's fled, The shamrock blooms, the thistle's dead— Begorrah ! • " Ye banks and braes e' Bonnie Doon, Ye ilka birds, your sang is dune, The stane is put, the hammer throon— Be jabers ! " Ae fond kiss and then we sever; Pat's fut is on oor native heather. Farewell, our crike i6 dough for ever— , Acushla! "
