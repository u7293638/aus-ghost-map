LONDONWEEKBYWiEK. (By Emily. Soldane.} August 21, 1896. John Everett Millais, the painter— the painter at little children, the painter of lovely women, the painter '.of nature in iher most winning moods, the painter who dwelt in the heart of the nation — is dead, and, covered with honors and glories and the . tears of bis people, 'has been iaid to rest. * . . * * * The body lay in state at his house, Palace Gate, A great tribute «f flowers covered ^the coffin and the floor, round. * . ? . * - * ?' _ _^- The procession left at 10 a.-m. The coffin rested upon an open funeral car. It was covered with the pall of -embroidered crimson velvet that did duty at the death ot Lord Leighton. On the pall was placed, an extremely ibeautiful cross of white flowers, surmounted '. by the large oval-shaped ipalette of . the artist and a few brushes fastened together by a piece of broad black crape. This floral token, made to correspond with* the length ? and breadth of the coffin, -was ircm the children oi the . departed painter. Lady Millais. contri buted ai exquisitely beautiful wreath of lilies, staphanotis, and roses, accompanied by the fol lowing simple but pathetic inscription : To my beloved husband, from his afflicted and mourning: widow:. ' * Oh, for the touch of a vanished hand And the sound of a voice that is still! * * * * The pall-bearers were Sir George Reid, president of the Scottish Academy; the Marquis of Granny, the Earl of Carlisle, the Earl of Rosebery, Vis count Wolseley, Sir Henry Irving, Mr. P: H. Cal deron, and Mr. Hoknan Hunt. ?=?.??? * * * * The Archbishop of York, chaplain to the Acad emy, was uinable to be present, and the officiating clergy were Canon Newbolt, Canon Scott Holland, and the minor canons ? -t * * * * 'Wreaths and floral emblems were sent by the Queen, the Prince and Princess of Wales, Princess Tiraiise. Marchioness ? of Lome, the Duke and Duchess of York, Lord and Lady Salisbury, Lord Rosebery, Mr. and, Mrs. Gladstone, Lady. Millais, Sir William Harcourt, the executive members of ?the Royal Academy, various Continental arT. , schools, etc. ?- ? ; * . * * * Notable among these, after those of the widow and of her Majesty,. is the Royal Academy garland, held aloft over the coffin by a servant of the Academy. It may be remembered that Sir John Millais carried .the Academy wreath at the funeral of Lord Leighton and laid it (the last one) on his grave. It seems no one of positida cared to emulate the example of Sir John. * * * * On Wednesday afternoon I went to St. Paul's to (have a look at fhe preparations for the buriaJ. On nxy way frotn the west door, walking on the north side of the transept, I stopped for a mo jnent at the tomb or monument of Chinese Gor don. On it still lay the offering of the Chinese Viceroy — a magnificent wreath, made of violet oolored immortelles tied with a wide satin helio trope ribbon. It lay on the breast of the mur dered hero, and by its side was a large bunch of tall grass, brown and withered. i * ' *' * * i .3*0 walk around St. Paul's is a liberal educa- ; tion in the cult of honor, patriotism, and un- . selfishness. Looking upon these memorials seems i to fill the heart with an intense desire to do j great things and deeds, things and deeds that are j lofty in aim and glorious in execution, ana so win a place among these remembered ones. . * ? * * * Near General Gordon, in a recess, is the monu ment to Lord Melbourne, .two ebony doors opening from the centre. On tihem are inscriptions in gold, and over them is written (also in gold), 'Through the gaoe of death we pass vo a joyful resurrection.' Keeping guard (one on each side) are two tall vrirOA marble angels. On the wall of the recess, to the right of the angel on the left, is a brass tablet commemorating the found ering of H.M.S. Captain, with the names of those lost. Prom a lofty window on the south side, through the dim, grey, 'hazy atmosphere of the church, came a narrow ray of light, which, fall ing on the shining brass, was reflected on the i w!hite angel, bathing her in a yellow, vibrating j flame, animating and making tier alive. To me j she seamed to sfiora.-. The effect was wonderful. ! * * * * i Going down in the crypt I found myself j Behind the scenes at the. grave of a great man. _ ; XT-. 1._*. nn*i Trm n +Tl ftT»£k -?!l^T)/-a aT\I\ TV --2+ 1Y1 Till1?* ' wayside house of the mighty dead. Hammers driving nails, saws sawing wood, and loud, rough Voices broke the, quiet of the place; laughter and jest scared away 'the listening ghosts. 'Look a-: ?ere Bill; th' platforms 'as got ter be ten foot by three. Jest 'and hup them there planks. That's habout tfi* ticket. Now, then, look haliye.' 'Hall right, matey,' says Bill. 'Don't he hin a 'urry; th' gentleman as th' job's for can wait.' 'Dop-jt you be so funny. 'Ere's the guvnor acomin.' ' And three funereal persons, one wearing' a black Bilk skull cap, came along slowly, and creeping under the encircling ropes, peered down into the depths, while the workmen stood still and wiped their sweaty .ij?rows. Presently the 'guvnor' walked up and down, counting the paces. There was a whispered1- consultation, after which the three stole away,*with soft and furtive step. Then the men fell to again. The terrible hammering, and knocking, and pickaxing, and saiving got on my nerves. * * - * ' Sir John lies at the feet of Lord Leighton, and close to Dame Christopher Wren. On the Boehm memorial, Ibrass, let into the pavement, lay ? a bunch of ripe and yellow oats, and among tne immortelles on the grave of Canon Liddon was a nosegay of freshly-gathered forget-me-nots. * * * * The 'Daily Mail' has been interviewing the original of Millais's 'Cinderella.' She says: 'I was acting at St. James's Theatre with the Ken dais in a piece called 'G«o4 Fortune.' I had to play tine part of a little Welsh girl, and Sir John s daughter (I don't know wMch of them it was) came to the theatre and took a fancy to me. She rwent koine and told her father that he must go to -=ee the piece, for there was 'the sweetest little girl in it' Sir John came the next evening, and Hie made some inquiries about me, and then wrote to my mother to ask her to bring me to see ham. You know the way I am rather stooping on the stool to the picture? Well, I often sat that way to ease any fcaek, and ihe allowed me to do so, and 1uSt painted me in that attitude.' ? . * ? ? 'I remember that once at -lunch time we were in -the dining-room, and as there was a fire I went and Sat beside it, and put my tare feet in. the tender. A gentleman came into the room, and after talking for some minutes to Sir John, he. Came and patted me on the head, saying, 'So this is little Cinderella, but what have you done Witfc your pretty cap?' I bad left my red cap m the studio, 'so I looked up at him and told Mm so, thinking what an ugly man he was, and what dirty gloves he wore. When we went back to (work Sir John told me it was Lord Beaconsfieid. * *. * *- There is great excitement over the yacht acci dent and in spite of the verdict of 'accidental death and blame, did not attach to anyone,' many yachting people talk about 'recklessness' and its consequences. Baron Von Zedtwitz was a great and personal friend of the Emperor's, to waom he rendered himself a persona . grata by importing from New York the best: specimen of a, fleet racer, that could be produced. * * * * The Isolde was a 20-rater from the. famous Ame rican yard of Messrs. Herreshoff, and came as a revelation to German yachtsmen. Last year at Kiel I she carried off most of the prizes, and made an immense sensation. *??*?# * This is how it happened. The morning opened with rain and a breeze from the south-west, which became stronger as the day advanced. The first race was that for yachts exceeding 68ft linear rating. The four crack boats started for the rear- commodore's prize of £50, viz.: The German Emperor's Meteor, the Prince cf Wales's Britan nia, Mr.C- D- Hose's Satanita, and.Mr. A. B. Wal ker's AUsa. ???-.'. *- * * ? ? ? ? At - the completion o£ the first round, 45min after- the cracta i started,- a race for yachts of 52ft linear rating— popularly known as twenties— start- ea over a shorter course of 23 miles: The yachts crossing the line' l^ere: Mr. C.

Then came up a batch 'pit big cutters ana twen ties in such dose proximity .that /those on 'the com mittee boat- watched their movements with pain ful interest. The Britannia kept a slight lead, but the Meteor had. jcrep|t'sup to ; -within. Iier -own length of the Prince's boat, Isolde and The Saint being between. Baron Von Zedtwitz's. . boat was just a Jengthln advance. Breathless 'iwith anxiety, taosptn the committee boat watched the manoeuvres t»f the yachts. . -. -??.». - ??,*-. . * . ..._??. , . , ?; The Emperor's yacht was now well /-abreast ot the Britannia. '.- ^Botli were trimming i»U to alter tEe'ir course to ihe south-east for the second round. . The crews of the Isolde and The Saihf' were also engaged in the same operation.' The Isolde, which was being closely pressed .asters ..bye The Saint, seemed 'to swerve to ! wind ward', In the direction of' the Britannia, and then to tu-ri sharp round across the Meteor's course. , It- was1 subsequently stated that The Saint had caught, her backstay, forcing her round. ''All' that was known at the moment was that the Isolde's .splintered bowsprit Was seen flying up in' the air -and 'her fore canvas fluttering in the breeze. The next instant she was grinding broadside on against the Meteor's side. With a crash, over came her mainmast. As soon as the big yachts -had cleared and stood off a little the Isolde was seen to be a perfect wreck. her hull tossing up and down in the water with her mainsail floating by her side. The crew were ?visible only by their beads as they swam towards the floating wreckage. ... — ^ * ' * $ The Baron was crushed by the falling wreckage, and died on board the Bohemia II. before they'* could make Ryde. * * ,* . * The Baroness is staying at Ryde. Of course, everyone feels the greatest sympathy with aer in her berea'cement. * ?..*?-» The following telegram has been received at the Royal Albert Yacht Club: 'From the Equerryin Waiting, Osbdrne. — The Queen has heard with re gret t-i the sad accident to Baron vc-n Zedtwitz.' * * . * . * The secretary of tihe Jioyal Yacht Squadron, Cowes, also telegraphs, expressing the sympathy cf the members of the squadron. * * -? * * Baron Zedtwitz was for a number of .years in i-fle German diplomatic service, and held mors than one responsible appointment. He was suc cessively Secretary of Embassy at St. Peters burg, Stockholm, Tokio, and Washington, and eight years ago -was appointed Envoy Extraordi nary and Minister Plenipotentiary to Mexico. * * * * ? ; The Meteor yesterday received definite orders ibat the ;.racht is not to race again this season, but is to yay o£ immediately and proceed to lay up. * * * * The Prince of Wales has withdrawn the Britan nia for the remainder of the season. * * * # Prince Max of Saxony's arrival in London to take up work as a priest causes some little ex citement in Roman Catholic circles in the metro polis. It is not every day that the nephew of a reigning king becomes a priest, and still more seldom does he leave his own country to labor in a foreign land. * * * * Prince Max is the. third son of Duke George of Saxony, the only brother of King Albert He is quite a young ™;i, 26, and it was only the other day that he was with much ceremony formally admitted into the Roman Catholic priesthood. His father is the heir-apparent to the Saxon throne, the present King having no children. * * * * Prince Max is lovely to look upon, being tall, and fair, and straight, with beautiful blue eyes, and a profusion of flaxen hair — a typical and pic turesque Saxon. * * * * We are getting a good deal of Li — some people iiinii a good deal too much; tie wonderful way ' he asks questions of everybody about everything, I particularly people's ages, and more particularly i ladies' ages. He says in Ohiua it is a great corn- j I pliment to ask a lady her age; and she always I tells the truth. I Li has been interviewed by a lady. When she arrived at 14 Garlton House Terrace at 7.45 a.m. j tUe evmcea an intention oi inxei^'atswiiis u«u, uui she turned the tables -by asking— 'What he , thought of Englishwomen?' After two or three j aikws at his .pipe he replied, 'Englishwomen are very 'beautiful and most intellectual, but why do they have small waists?' * ? . * * * i In Scotland he is to be regaled with a band of bagpipes, it being considered the nearest avail able second to Chinese music. * * : * * He keeps the newspaper men v.'ell on the trot The other day he was banqueted at the great Telegraph Works, and 'The Daily Telegraph' man found bird nest scup 'exceedingly captivat ing.' 'The delicate flavor is exquisite, and com pares with nothing that exists in the French. and English culsine._' He had a stewed shark's fin. i But there was no mention of beche de mer. The piece de resistance at his cable feast was a roast sucking pig. * * * Li went to the Bank of England. He took a seat, and smoked, and between whiffs asked Mr. G. A. Sandeman, the Governor: 'How long have you been Governor?' 'Is this a Government bank?' . . 'Does the Government inspect the accounts? 'Does the Government audit the accounts?' 'How many shareholders in the bank?' 'What is the amount of the reserve fund?' 'What is the amount of the deposit?' 'What is the dividend paid?' 'Do the Rothschilds deposit here?' 'Where do you get -your gold bars from ?' 'Do you come to the bank every day?' 'How old are you?' 'How old is your wife?' * * * * He went to the Crystal Palace, and for the first time took off his hat in public; also his yellow jacket and peacock feather. He bad a knife and fork instead of his usual chop sticks, and drank \ a little champagne. He thought the fireworks 'fine'— better than Chinese. He asked Mr. 'How long have you been firework maker?' 'Will you come to China?' ^ v 'How much money do you make?' 'How old are you ?' 'Saw old is your wife?' * * * ? In the railway car at Chester, he asked the ticket collector: , - 'How much work do you do?' 'How much money do you get for^it?' 'Do you expect to get promoted?' 'When?' 'How old is Mr. Gladstone?? 'How long has be lived at Hawarden? 'How old are you?' 'How old is your wife?' * * * * He asked Mr. Gladstone: 'How long were you in the Cabinet? ' 'How long Prime Minister?' 'How do you like Lord Salisbury?' 'How old are you?' ? 'How old la your wife?' * * * ♦ He asked Lord Tweeddale: , 'How much stock do you hold in tne Nortn British Railway?' 'Do you want to sell?' 'Why don't you hold more?' 'How-old are you?' 'How old is your wife?' . 'How old are you?''fc.sked his Lordship. '76,' said the Viceroy. * * * * - Li is going to the 'Empire' to-night. ' 41 # * * Li's chief secretary makes all the 'reply' speeches— while Li sits and smokes. * * * * Well, Dr. Naneen is coming back, and although be does not bring the promised. chip from that old block— the North Pole— he has done wonderfu? things for the scientific world; and the way he was rescued when nobody was looking for him is de cidedly thrilling. Nansen was endeavoring to' march westward to Spitzbergen over the ice packs when be was mat quite accidentally by Mr. Jack son, of the Jackson-Harmcworth Expedition. 'On June 17,' writes Atr. Jackson, 'I met Dr. Nansen three miles* out on the floe to the south south-east of Cape Flora, under most extraordin ary circumstances. He had wintered in a rough but within a mile or two oi our nortnern iimii in 1895, and this spring we unknowingly came to within' a few miles of Ms winter quarters. He bad left the Train with one companion, and reach ed the latitude of S6deg 14min, travelling north east from the spot where he 'bad . ' left his ship {which was in 84deg nortb latitude, 102deg east longitude). His two watches bad stopped, and be was entirely' uncertain' of : bis whereabouts.

V * * * * ' Mr. Herbert Standing's season at the Criterion opened last night with the new drama, 'A H lind Marriage.' Fortunately the author discrjjetly withheld his name, or I -don't know what w. ould have been the consequences. The piece is a de lightful infringement of the familiar 'Fa mily Herald Supplement' bill of fare — life in thej Far: West, a British lord shot and blinded (accident ally) by the villain, a prairie blossom on a ranch, ^ic. * * * * I At Monte Carlo the blind lord meets and marries' a lovely ' 'Murican' heiress. Of course it if s the 'blossom.' The villain, for no earthly reason, says, said blossom once upon a time loved hin?., not wisely but too -well.' Of course it is a fabrica tion; and Mr. Herbert Standing, an amateui- ocu list, does the double act business, restore s the lord's sight and the lady's reputation. { != * * * - There was a .fashionable crowd present, and when we came out into the gay and giddy jrortex of up-to-date London that surges and ciro ulates round that quarter and makes bay while &-|V elec- ; trie light shines, we pulled ourselves togethej:, say ing 'Good gracious,' and feeling like the1 coster' gentleman who, coming in for untold wealth, was consequently uncertain of his location. 1 1 cer tainly seemed we ought to be emerging uiito the propriety of the Surrey side, instead of tbje glis tening, brilliant, and blatant impropriety of- Picca-' dilly Circus. ' ; . * * * * ! A curious divorce case which did not find its way into the papers, was that of 'Bancroft; other wise Grimston, v Bancroft,' heard by Sir }?rancis Jeune last Wednesday in camera. The case was finished; but the judgment was not divulgetl. The parties to the suit were not recognised, ^.nd the case remains somewhat of a Divorce Couirt mys tery. It did not appear in the official lish of de fended and undefended causes, and was na/: classi fied in the daily official cause-list posted outside the law courts. * . * * * ; Anyway, it is known the case was 'undefended.' It is absurd to think of keeping a secret which everybody is at present busily engaged in unravel ling. ; * * * ? *-' The Grand Opera Syndicate, Limited, '? was re gistered on July 25, with a capital of £15;i00, divi ded into 150 ordinary, shares of £100 eachj, and 100 deferred shares of £1 each.

The piece is already in re hearsal, and the theatre is being '('done up.' -Let us hope fthe new management won't foe. * * * «?' The teacher was making her scholars 'finish each .of her sentences to show that they lunderstoo.d. her. 'The idol had eyes,' she sai'd, 'but it couldn't ? 'j,'See,' cried the ehildrsn.
