s k i t t i- e 6. SKITTUrjlOSSIP. [?] : Every week brings rarwer mepDS « one of die bees things tbrt baa bapprtied to alrifctire for s bW time ia ths generosity of Mr 8\. WiUts, wbo for throe seasone now has ft nlnabk tronblse for competition UMrtrot ebft msrnbm rf 4ba Vjtrinas dub the winniito of wfaioh carries -dwmptoiisbip booora. ' It was a happy . lflen, snd u most be gratifying to faun to know that ibis season there is greater keen . xiess than ever noticeable amongst players, and that the result is a most difficult one to prophecy, so many good men and true are there in it. On tbe 22nd ultimo-, in the Windsor alley, however, riro nnmber waa farther reduced fay four. At 8 o'clock Q. Chapman and G. W. Stokra tackled each other, and after a thirty -eight frame game tbe former remained a comfortable winner by 16 chalks to 10\. The totals were— Chapman, 91; Stokes, 101. .G.Ditchburn has been showing each fine form nearly every time be has handled the cheese this eeason, that nobody imagined P. Goode, who had to meet him, wonld have a ghost of a show. Much to the surprise of those present, though, tbe East Melboornite not only held bis own with bis opponent, bnt as one time looked quite like a winner. But to wards tbe finish he fell off a little, giving Ditchburn a chance that he ned to tbe best advantage, aod thus won a good game by 15 cbtlka to 1L Tbe totali were for 33 framea. Ditchburn 79 Goode 66. I do not think I would be wrong if I alluded to G. Gaggin and E. J. Lewi as two veteran of the skittle world. At an? rates Iknow I will be right if J aav that they are both steady- going players who know tbe game tho roughly. My readers, therefore, will not be surprised to bear 'that tbeir meeting, which also took place on theabove- nsmeddste, was the most interesting. Both men played wonderfully well, Gaggin eap-cially so, and he was rewarded by gettingbomr first with a majurity of 6 chalk& Ha deserved the honor, but Lewis I must also compliment for the stubborn fight be made of it For the 38 frames, Gaggin' total, including Cnines -and 20 eights, was 84, and Lewis's, including 3 nine and 22 eights, was 90. C. Mainou bud. a walkover by Budd not putting in an appearance. H South Melbourne put in an appearance at die MdUwweee ll. y last ThurMaV , wet-k to play the return match against tbe Metropolitans, and managed tn make a draw ot it. WbiJe I am cure the viritors must be thoroughly satisfied with such i a performance, I hear there are to be heard something mote than mere muttering of dis content amongst the players and supporters of (be home team. No les than five members ol their regular team were conspicuous by their absence, vir., Messrs Beckwith, Ditchburn, H. S. M. Evans, Brown and Rout. The last-named bring in Tasmania, of course could not attend, but to /the others I can aay their apparent indifferences nearly lost them a match that there can be no question that they could have won had they played their full strength, though I note with pleasure tbe rapid strides the Southerners are making at the game. If members of team cannot play at certain times, the least that should be done is to notify the secretary of rheirclub, especially such a secretary as W. Ryall ho proved himself to be to tbe Mel bourne CIud. However, the result of the match will help the game , on at South Melbourne, and for that reason al»ne tbev are to be con gratulated on tbrir taucc-s. It was a 19-frsine game, and when 11 o'clock had arrived »-ach aide hud 8 chalk, the home ream getting one in the last round. Appended are the sores and sets Mribourue: Ryall 41, Dickon 47, R.

The fond hopes of the .Tohmoniers that the cnaaipionsni|> woaiu again 11111 season ue carrud off by one nf their number were entirely distielled on Tuesday evening,tbe 29th ultimo. There were three of tbem then hanoed the cheese, and the three were badly beaten, Melbourne, representatives being the victors. W. Gaggin, contrary to expectation, failed even to make a game of it with W. Ryall, the lant mentioned player winning by a mnjority of 9 chalks, the totals being for the 44 frames, Ryall 92, G&ggiu; 112\. The victor vsi in rerv fine form aod he hit 7 nin-8 and 27 eights. For the first 17 frames bis average wan 3 p lintB under two. Dickson beat Sims comfortably by 15 chalks to 10, the Windsor man by no -means doing himself justice. Nor did toe winner do any thing brilliant, though he made but few mis- «ak&. For the 39 frames tbe totals were— Dickson 97, Sims 100. Though Chapman, in his game with Ditch- burn, had at tun end of 13tb round six chalks to tbe two won by hi opponent trie Melbourne man got home by 15 chalks to 12 after a 46 frame go. Tbe totals were Ditchburn 113, Chapman 114. Then G. Gagein succumbed to CJo. Maloon, and the dieco-nfirure of tbe East Mel- boarnites wo thus completed. Mainon won by 1& chalk to 8, and 85 frames were got through. Tbs matches were played at .Toll men earned oS'tfe TGoninTofljeveniiig. The championship must therefore go to one of the Metropolitan.
