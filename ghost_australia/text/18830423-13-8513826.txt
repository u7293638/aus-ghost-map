SPORTING INTELLIGENCE. THE VATC. RACES. | The race meeting announced to be held on the Caulfield racecourse under the auspices of the V. A.T.C. on Saturday promised to be a very successful one, as the entries were good. The weather unfortunately militated against a large attendance, as from an early hour in the morning until about 11 o'clock the rain came dowiiBteadily. The number of visitors was consequently rather limited, but luckily the rain ceased, and held on until just as the last race was being started. For the Selling Race, with which business was commenced, five out of the nine on the card came to the post. Nymph being made the favourite. She ran fairly well, and managed to get third place, but was never very dangerous, the winner turning up in Anagram, with Kit Nubbles who finished well, second. Seven started for the Hurdle Race, for which Huzza and Black Prince were most fancied. Devilshoof made most of the running, Mr. India riding a waiting race, but when wanted Buzza came away, and won easily by nearly a couple of lengths from Dovilahonf, Pride being third. The Glen Huntly Handicap brought out a field of 14, Josephine having the call in the betting. She got away well in company with Wizard, and for the first 200 yards the pair led the Held. Her Majesty, who then took up the running, maintained the premier position past the sod wall and along the side to the home turn, The pace then began to tell, and Wizard rushing to the front, he soon had his opponents in trouble, and was landed an easy winner by three lengths from ContesBina, who made a great effort in the straight, but failed to get up. Kathleen Mavourneen will third. In turning into the straight, L'Africaine, who was coming at a great pace, Slipped, and it was thought that St Bacchus wan seriously injured if not killed, as he never moved. he recovered in a few minutes, and with assistance was able to walk in. The Steeplechase brought out a field of eight horses, and although Premier was backed for a fair amount, Vaulter who most fancied, and he left the paddock at the short price of 5 to !. Governor, who got away well, made most of the running to the fence on the hill, where Pride, Premier, and Starlight came down. Pride was quickly remounted, but Premier got away, and going on with the field led for some considerable distance. Hunt, the rider, was subsequently carried in on a shutter, when it was found that he had broken his leg. Governor continued in the van until after passing the sod wall, when Scobie commenced on Vaulter, and the son of the Ace answering gamely, he went to the front, and won easily by two lengths from Governor, who was nearly the same distance in front of Stnmpodo, who came with a wet sail up the straight. The largest field of the day, viz., Hi horses, faced the starter for the last race, the Armadale Handicap. The weather was thick, and it was with great difficulty that the horses could be distinguished, From the Fact of UndeR having the mount on Forlorn, who was made first favourite, and backed for a good amount. The certainties, however, don't always come off, and in this case the favourite failed even to get a place, Con teams, who led nearly the whole of the distance, winning very comfortably by two lengths, Chataway and Liddington, who filled the second and third positions respectively, coming with a great rush up the straight.
