Kate and the captain, is a niche of their own, at a safe whispering distance, were absorbed m coca other Esther had chmbod to the topmost ledge, and was sitting there alone. For the first time in six weary months, a sensation of pleasure bad come to her -. she ?was conscious of hut one longing—that they would aR go away and leave her to realise it. AVith some vague hope she got oat her colour-box and portfolio, and began' to sketch. Sketching, sbo had discovered, laid kept p-toplo off. and furnished aa excusp for silence.. And so an hour or so passed by. She heard, a:; in a dream, the chatter of the- ethers, their questions to the little guide, his abort, jerky replies. Tho. pools were all explored; theurchias and anemones' had been tickled with parasols, and made to shut and open and shut again ; tho young people began to sigh for future worlds to conquer, and Mrs. Gray to consider it very clamp. . " Little boy, isn't thoro something else near by which wo should like to see.?" " Guess so." ""Weu, where is it? To?u-vplease." " There's the ' Hoads,*:i guess.**. "Oh, how fax off is that? A mile, did you say? That's, not .far. Raps, the boy says there's a place called the 'Heads,' .only a, mile away, and we want to go and see it. Can't we go and see it?. You know the way; don't you, little boy?" ?*Ye-ah-", "I think this place is very damp," sighed Mrs. Gray. "I should he really glad to he somewhere and feel the sunshine again. X begin to have creeping chills. Suppose we let the- boy shew us to this other place, father." "Very well. Get -your things together, girls. Come, Bather, we're going." Esther roused herself as if from a dream. "Oh. Mr. Gray! ' Must I go? I'm lv the middle of a sketch, yon see. Couldn't you leave mc here quietly, and pick mo up as yon come back? I shoiild?ke it so much.*' " Well, Z don't know. The tide is going. out, the boy says; ? then* won't be any, trouble of that kind. Are you sure that you won't be chilled, or "lonely ?* " Oh I quite sure." " Promise mc, that if you are, you wiU go to tho Cottage at the bend and warm, yourself, or sit on the rocks in the sun. We'll look for you in some place or other. Good- bye, nvy-dear.**. " Good-bye, sir." "And, oh, Esther, you must have some lnnch. ATou'R be starred before we come' back," cried careful Helen. So she and Tom aud a basket made their way upward, aud a deposit of sandwiches aud port wine was left in a convenient crovico within reach. "Good-bye, dear. I hope the sketch wiR bo lovely." And they are gone—up the hiU-si-le—Mrs. Grsntlost, loaning upon her husband's arm. "Poor childl" she said, "it makes my heart ache to see her look "ao sad. ' Didn't you notice how she was longing to have n? go, and leave her alone?" "And the very worst thing for her. She needs ? rousing, and aU this morbid thinking does her harm." The voice died away. Esther caught the words' and she''smiled at them—4l bitter little smile. That is what all of them had said since her trouble*, began. Sho must be roused—^-amused—and they had crowded business and pleasures upon her until she sometimes felt she could bear it no longor.

The gentleman went for assistance, and brought two stout fishermen to the spot. Bnt what could anybody do ? . " If the young woman had sense enough: to climb up to the right-hand esomerand sit still, it won't hurt her none, perhaps," one of.them said. -"Not more than two tides a year gets up there."

A figure was coming rapidly up tho path —a young man. Nobody recognised him* till Dr. Gray started forward with tho foco of one who sees a ghost " Paul 1 Good God I It is impossible!"
