Seep Out of the Past. Keep oat of the past! for its highways Are damp with malarial gloom, Its gardens are sere, and its forests are drear, And everywhere moulders a tomb. Who seeks to regain its lost pleasures Finds only a rose turned to rust, And its storehouse of wonderful treasures Is covered and coated with dost. Keep oat of the past f it is haunted. He who in its avenue gropes Shall find there the ghost of a joy prized the most. And a skeleton throng of dead hopes. In place of its boauttful rivers Lie pools that are stagnant with slime, And those graves gleaming bright in the phosphonu light Cover dreams that were slain in their prime. Keep out of the past 1 it is lonely And barren and bleak to the view. Its fires have grown cold and its stories are old. Torn, tarn to the present, the sew! To-day leads yon up to the hill-tops That are kissed by the radiant suo ; To-day shows no tombâ€”all life's hope in bloom . And to-day holds a prize to be won.
