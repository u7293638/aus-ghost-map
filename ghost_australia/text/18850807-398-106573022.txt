SELECTED POETRY. ALONE WITH CONSCIENCE. I sat alone 'with my conscience In a place where time had ceased, And we talked of my former living In the land where the years increased; And I felt I should hare to answer The questions it put to me, And to face the answer and question Throughout an eternity. The ghosts of forgotton actions Came floating before my eight, And things that I thought were dead things Were alive with a terrible might; And the vision of all my past life Was an awful thing to face, Alone with my conscience sitting In that solemnly silent place. And I thought of a far-away warning, Of a sorrow that was to be mine; In a land that then was the future And now is the present time. And I thought of my former thinking, Of the judgment day to be ; But sitting alone with my conscience Seemed judgment euough for me. And I wondered if there was a future To the land beyond the grave, But no one gave me an answer And no one can come to save ; Then I felt that the future was present And the present would never go by, For it was but the thought of my past life Grown into eternity. Then I woke from my timely dreaming, And the vision passed away, And I knew that the far-away warning Was a warning of yesterday; And I pray that I may not forget it In this land before the grave, That I may not cry out in the future, And no one come to save. And so I have learnt a lesson Which I ought to have known before, And which, though I learnt it in dreaming, I hope to forget no more. So I sit alone with ray conscience, In the place where the years increase, And I try to think of the future, In the land where time will cease ; And I know of the future judgment, How dreadful so'er it be, That to eit alone with my conscience Will be judgment enough for me.
