j NAPOLEON III. ! 9TII JANUARY, 1873. His silent spirit from the place Slid forth unseen; amid the throng Of those whose love outlived disgrace, Wilone fealty to the last was strong, 'Midst homage 'neath Fate's adverse reign; Paid to the stars" ahorn of its rays, How passed the EXILE ?-Lingering fain, As never once in prouder days P The MOTHER and the CHILD were there, ! Discrowned and disinherited, . No hand henceforth to right the HEIR ; . Now griefs to bow the golden head. How passed NAPOLEON ?-prizing more Old fame in camp and council won, Or fearless ENGLAND'S ogis o'er The future of her ally's son P Gate of that world we know not yet I "What thou beheld'atwho may proclaim P "Were spirit-ranks, in order set, : Haunting thy portals, as he came, - " . "With voices nun-inuring " Our life- torch, Unspent, was quenched at his behest." Did by-gone princes fill the porch, BOURBON and VALOIS and the rest ?v * . How passed the SOLDIER P-cold and stem, 'Mid weaponless, reproachful ghosts, As when he led them forth to leam How fight the hardy German hosts ? How passed the EMPEROR where THEY gazed, Once wearers of the Ancient Crown P As ono who knew its lustre blazed The brighter- ere ho laid it down ! How passed he P-Brighter grows the dream! Through yon accusing spirit-band, Beyond the scornful Old Regime, Another group of watchers stand ! Those hands are stretched to greet him now, That once CHARLEMAGNE'S proud sceptre . won; While hastes HORTENSE, with beamingbrow, No loaner banished from her son ! W. N. B. Sydney, January 1873.
