SALE TURF CLUlB 1GES.'. The Winter Steeplechase Meeting of the Sale Turf Club was hold yesterday. The weather wea beautifully fine, 'but owing to the paucity qf entries for several of the events there was not a very large httondance. As usual there weto a great number of. the "thiroo-card" mon, etc.i but there were oinly a few mnemboiraoflthe ring, and those present grumbled a great deal at the extrai charge levied on them for plying their vocationr in the saddling paddock. Botting during the day. was almost solely confined to doubles and trebles, the Handicap and Steeplechase heing the only events to eltico, any straight out wagering. The hnooks opened with 5 to 1. the double, Huridlo and Stuuplechlnso 25 to 3 Hurdle and Handi. cup, and 50. to 5 Handicap and Steeple chase. Tle: favourite picksa were Miller ulnd The Ollost for thleHurdle a?dHalldi. cap, and Transferred and CoomUetC for H l,,uilicap and Steeplechase. ;The Hurdle race rcsqlted in n neasy win for Miller, Devilshoof,. who was, commuencing .to trouble hiin, 'weriving 'brt' untbring.the. str ilit. Thu Winter Iiradli?CP was won by Transfer;Ps,, but it coild"ht r.have been considrhd a griod thing fis'his owner onlly took'£50,to £10. Iron Hand, who was not very pink, carried ia deal of money, as also did ,AIluder, who ran a good horse. Thi Steeplechase proved o chapter of accidents, all the hlores but Cootuite coming to grief. IMoontight led the (ield away, making the pace very wars, 'and led to the last fence, whlle, being bustled it little too hastily at it, lie fell over,' and Cor,0oto 'who had put his fetlock ,0ot at the jump near the the entrance gate, safuly negtiated the lust fence,' and just nlllnaged to walk to the post with the, jockey en his back. Schbie,. who was riding Coumeto, states that at the seeondhlast feuce the horse overjumlped hiinsolf,. and then . put his fetlock out' The hlorso was then sri bad that hiis rider expoected him to fill every ininute, butseoeing that -.Moonlight. ini font of himn was in distress, and would probably notgot'over the last jump, lihe perseveroedl with hiiil. Ou jumpsiug the. last fence lie again eanme.ji tle .wounded, fetlock, but" just'- ianagid" to crawl in. The victory was" a inbsat populiar. one, and was received amidst great excitement with trentieldous cheers. On passing the post thile twards gave Kilby permission to dismount as thee horse' would have fallen. Had .Moonlight beins mounted quickly whel ht wl is cauglit he must have won, as a canter would have caughllt the winner. Attention 'wre called to the great distance betwooe the two last junmps in the Hurdle IRce. A. protest was entered against Miller for' the Hurdle Race but it was dismissed.

Round by the Maffra road Moonlight had a lead of about ten lengths, but Coomete appeared to be gaining; going over the jumps near the gate, Coomete appeared done, but struggled on. Moonlight increased his lead by a few lengths, but bungled at the last jump, and Coomete who was lame struggled gamely on, safely negotiated the last jump and just managed to carry his rider to the post, and win, one of the gamest struggles ever witnessed on a race. course.
