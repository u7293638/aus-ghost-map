. ARCHBISHOP VAUGHAN AT WEST BALMAIN. The ceremony of laying the foundation stone of m Weston street, West Balmain was performed yesterday afternoon by. his Grace Archbishop Vaughan, in the presence of over 1000 persons The new school is intended to supply an educational want long felt among the Catholic residents of the district. The building will measure 100 feet in length, and 26 feet in width and will be capable of accommodating 300 children The working men in that district have been long engaged in energetically assist- ing Father Dillon in providing school accommodation notoriety their contributions but also by their gratuitous labours in the mornings and ex prongs, before and after their usual working horns By the efforts of these parishioners twelve allotments (each measuring 100 feet by 30 feet) have been purchased, and the new school building will occupy a good position on these allotments Among the gentlemen present at yesterday s gathering wore the following - Revs F L Torreggiani, P Hoolihan, O S F , P J Mahony, Walsh, Dalton, S J G Dillon, Dean Dwyer, and Pure G travail, Messrs D O'Connor, M L A , W J Coonan, M L A , W H Archer (Knight of the Ecclesiastical Order of St Gregory), J T Donovan, J P., and a number of other well-known gentlemen Archbishop Vaughan, prior to laying the foundation stone, addressed the gathering as follows - Itwasonh the other day that I had the gratification oflayingthe foundation stone of a school at Forest Lodge where in a few minutes, six hundred pounds were subscribed before the end of this month I shall be doing the same for the great schools at Darlinghurst, and now I am here, in the midst of our Catholic working men, just about to perform the same ceremony for Father Dillon and I suppose, to see. some few words upon the all-absorbing topic of Catholic education And first of ah I must express to you ma unfeigned delight at being; in the midst of you this evening I look upon you the Catholic working-men of this district, with eyes and feelings of especial sympathy and admiration You know that if you were travelling in Yorkshire and you began to tolls Yorkshire man how much you admired Mr So and So that A orkshirmuau would at once turn upon v. ou sharp, and asked h it did he give soul Now, what is it that you have given to compel me to speak of you in the terms in which I have spoken? I will tell you you have godmother consciousness that the very poorest of our people possess that true Catholic spirit which shows itself in great and noble works You, in the Catholic people of Balmain, you are descended from a race which has over loved faith better than life, and which possesses an innate generosity which is, I I think I may say it special to the Irish character I Let me Toronto moment quote the words of a great Protes- | tant historian He says -"A standard of domestic virtue a delicacy of female honour was gradually formed amongst the Irish poor higher than in any other part of the empire, and unsurpassed if not unequalled in Europe The von extension of poverty and mendicancy had produced among them a rare and touching spirit of charity, a readiness to share with one another the last crust and the last potato Domestic affections were more than commonly warm the memorable fact that in the present century not less than twenty millions of pounds have been sent back in the space of twenty years by those who went for the most part as penniless emigrants to America, to their relatives in Ireland illustrates a side of the Irish character which was already noticed by many observers and in modern times concerning which alone we can speak with confidence, infanticide, desertion, wife murder, and other crimes indicating a low state of domestic morality have been much rarer among the Irish poor than among the corresponding classes in England ' I find these pregnant words of Mr Lecky, regarding the generosity of the Irish people borne out as to then nulli wherever I go throughout the colony Their land is set to even Good york and their charity is unbounded So far, in general But what have you the people of Balmain done, that you should be numbered amongst those who have proved themselves worthy of this praise ? Let me s u what you have done for the sake of those who may not know I will take the whole district, served by Father Dillon First take Balmain proper There you have a convent to begin with which in round sum beds, will have cost £0500 and I am told that improvements and internal fittings and arrangements have entailed in other £1000 On all this the debt has been reduced to ÜloOO Father Dillon puts down the schools connected with the Chin hat £1300 But my main point is this-for I want my audience to know what these people have done to make me praise them that the labouring men and the citizens and the ship carpenters have done what thousands did before them in the Ages of Faith -they ball given the work of their hands and the sweat of their brow to the service of the Church The church for one reason and another had fallen into great disrepair The schools had become too small YAHiat did these people do r for fifteen months they worked double tides that is after the toil and drudge of their daily work was over, instead of enjoying during the rest of the evening their well earned zero e they set to work again on the church and on the schools, as J began then labour of love In the summer time they left off labour at 4 p.m., and then set to working for the schools and the Church till close of night In winter they were not deterred, even by darkness forlntntold they laboured by lamplight at this great and glorious work for God I say those hands and arms will be blessed those wearied feet will " walk in ways of peace for our Lord must love such men as these who thus spend themselves in His senses Father Dillon tells me that he values the labours of these men at £100 What have these men given weep A glorious example of Christian workmen working after working- hours, and deep into the night for the Church of thegither Let us now come nearer home still Look at the ground beneath your feet look at this large property where men are assembled How came it into our possession 'I say give one it to the Catholic working men those gentlemen-and they are the true gentleman of the land in its highest sense these gentlemen formed a committee and bought the land and petitioned me to send the Sisters of the Good Samaritan to teach in the schools they had erected Two of these gentlemen held the land till the appointment of Father Dillon and then they made it over to the Church he school itself cost £700, and £300 have been spent in furniture and appliances The land is valued at £500 making a total of 1500, with a debt remaining of £160 In one word, taking the two centres of labour the Convent costing £700, the schools of St Augustine £1300 and those of St. Joseph £1800, we may say safely that over £10 000 have been spent in the advancement of morality and religion in the district And this money has, at least in part been collected I think I may six in great part, by the weekly subscriptions of the poorer classes who, together with their religion, have brought into the country that spond d generosity which is especial to the Irish people I think, ladies and gentlemen, that I had, a now satisfied nr j imaginary Yorkshire friend and I believe that can he would be constrained to admit that I have very good reason indeed, for praising the Catholic workmen of Balmain And now if they will let me I will tell a bit of my mind to all honest liberal-minded men with regard to those great events which are casting their dark and gloomy shadows before I had sat in the country that when a storm is coming of unusual violence the mum it's become unusually quiet in the fields, and there seems to be a hush in nature, till suddenly the cataracts of heaven open and the thunder bellows as the forked lightning flashes on every side and shivers and charm and turns into a black wreck the noblest tree of the forest Though things cannot well be as bad this I will not conceal from you or from an self that there are signs in the hens of that which of all things else in a free country is likely to produce such a storm as no bishop or priest would be able to avert I refer to the spirit of tyranny and persecution that seems as if it was about to be unchained Am I not an English- man standing here before the children of the Irish race ? Have- I not since the very first day I landed here now well nigh six years ago, held out the hand of brotherhood to all of you And did I not tell you that our sympathies were welded together by bonds of ancient suffering and that the thought of what your people went through on one side of the channel tomed to the thought of the persecutions suffered by mv own on the other-did I not say that this bound me to you with an unconquerable sympathy, strong as charity, which is more powerful than death ( And have I not, during these six years that I have been your spokesman and our friend, proved to you that those words were not vain words, but that they were the expression of a hidden energy that has spent itself and will spend itself to the end in your service ? And did we not congratulate one with another that we had found a home in a bright and sunny land where ' nor sorrow nor crying should be any more " and did we not think that though the past were painful, still we had put 16,000 miles of sea between ourselves and the scenes of ancient suffering and degradation i Yes, we did But alas, ha, o we not been too sanguine in our anticipations v What did we suffer as slaves and helots for at home? Because we preferred torture and death to acting against our conscience, and to be butchered and embowelled rather than allow those for whom we were sponsible to be tampered with in their faith We hoped that we had escaped from all forms of it many and person cution by coming so far away where we were told that all were equal, and all were free I hoped that by my kindness to you, and by standing up for you, and defending you, and showing sympathy and love to you, that I should in some way make up for all you had undergone at the hands of my own countrymen, and I did hope that they out here would only be too glad to join me and treat you with exceptional tenderness, especially with regard to your religion and your children, with the thought in their minds with the burning consciousness of all the cruel, monstrous wrongs that they had inflicted on you in the past But all this seems to be a vain life- stones dream from which we are to be aroused by | about the most ingeniously devised piece or scientific persecution that has been invented in modern times The end of the more brutal form of persecution, and of the more cultivated is one-it is to destroy our holy religion I believe the scientific method is more effective, and I believe more odious, than the more expeditious way, of tearing out the heart and bowels of a living. and grown man Here the plan is to strike at little child en-at the helpless little children of the Catholic poor Do you know that in the days of trial they had a special instrument for squeezing the life and blood out of those Catholics who declined to deny their God' It was a kind of press, with a screw at the top The Catholic man or woman was shoved into this press, just large enough to hold one, the top was forced down with the screw until it touched the head and back of the victim Then the real operation begun. By a slow, almost imperceptible, process, the top was continually pushed further and further down till the victim first lost breath, then the frame gradually gave way, and the whole body col 1^E_s^ii___j_iaM_ft4. _al_ete-c_-i&w--; 3>_--__j_ Tho Scavenger's Daughter 2 Now the modern Scavenger s Daughter is of a different construction The Archbishop and Bishops have told you that the secularist system and schools founded on that system so far as Catholics are concerned are " seed plots of future infidelity, immorality, and lawlessness, for they tend towards destroy- ing the fulness of your Catholic faith and grace of your Catholic morality and reverence, and I am glad to see that the newspapers have been fixing that condemnation indelibly on your minds by their continued and opportune quotation of the words of the Joint Pastoral S\ eil, using my private judgment in the Choice of an expression, I would all those tch loss 'b events' daughters," be ausB they are the most effective instruments invented by man for squeezing very gradually and almost imperceptibly the Catholic faith out of a Catholic people I have said this, before in other words, the Bishops have spoken with me the world knows what our the thing is it has been printed and reprinted in every newspaper in town and country It is a fact pubhJy established that Catholics cannot in conscience send their children to non catholic schools. It is, moreover, well known it has been in all the news papers, that we object to sending clergymen to the Public schools, whether with glass 000 is or without to join the jnr of tongues and the contradiction of creeds which is abhorrent from all tourist nets of reverence and religion I We have most carefully and think I may say boldly, spoken out as was our bounden duty, knowing as we did just a change was about to be made in the Education Act unfavourable to our views What has been the result? First of all a hurricane of abuse and endless insult cast upon what is dearer to us than life itself, on our holy religion As to those who have abused and insulted me personally, the worst wish I harbour in their regard is that they may have the grace to become Catholics before they die Well, during the downpour, I endeavoured calmly and clearly to state our case One thing-, I believe all will admit that one- case has been stated clear h an!ispprfectly intelligible Next, Parliament meets Iheoutlmesof theatre education scheme I are laid before the colony AS hat are its provisions? What is its drift ? There is no thing in its drift that I admire and that is that it evidently attempts to meet the requirements of some large sections of the community It not only implies a knowledge of their existence, but it also i aims at answering some of their wants The Church of England will have greater facilities for religious instruction, the Nonconformists will have it seems, all they want so far is they are concerned, the I League will have several concessions, partial com- I I pulsion, if not active and an approach to freedom from fees I admire any attempt at meeting the wishes of ' I large classes I am only too pit used when I see my fellow l p colonists rejoicing in a method of education which gives a ¡ them, as fat! his and mothers, peace and happiness when they think of their children I would be among the first to interfere the first to speak out were they tyrannised over, or were their conscientious convictions trampled under foot by a tyrannical majority So far the promise of the new bill solicits in respect But this very quality which I admire as bearing upon Protestants, heightens my sense of grief and indignation when I reflect that Catholics exclusively me in a studied move, apparently ignored, whilst in reality they are trampled on "SA workingmen of Balmain I am addressing myself to you You love your religion better than your life, if I may judge from the past You would rather die than jeopardise the future Catholic prospects of your children Your Church and your Bishops proclaim what your con- sciences and your instincts all you is the simple truth that you may not send your children to Public schools You are poor working, honest laboring men getting your 35s a week, trying to provide little homes for yourselves and to bring up your children as good and respectable as you are yourselves In you I am addressing all the labouring Catholics in the colony AA'e Catholics represent some one third some say more some less of the population This a new bill treats tenderly all the other sections How- does it treat your Canyon with the wildest stretch of imagina- | tion and Irishmen are not deficient in that can you in your wildest moments imagine a single point in that bill which shows that you have been thought of with kindness and sympathy? Have you not the painful I consciousness that so far as this new scheme is concerned I your case has been ignored, whilst all others have been thought of' Show me one single point where there is a sign, or shadow or ghost of a shadow of a sign that respect has been felt for the conscientious convictions of one third of the population, of the great Catholic interest in this colony I bought of you, you have been thought of you I have not been ignored It would seem to some that you have I been since singly before the eyes of those who framed this bill, that they might not, even by some inadvertent blunder throw you some miserable shred of justice And they haven't kept you in view in vain Whilst seemingly ignoring von, (hay have, knowingly or unknowingly, invented an instru- ment of scientific persecution exquisite in its perfection for carrying out its ends It combines insult with outrage, and whilst seeming to ignore your existence trampled your most I cherished aspirations under foot Working men of Balmain, let me explain myself you have to live on hard-earned ¡ wages and you know the worth of small sums of money and can only with thrift and care keep the wolf from the door What does the new bill do for you, for the thousands of the Catholic poor ? Does it so sympathise with your poverty, and encourage your sturdy faith, and soothe your hard life by giving your children a chance of being instructed in secular knowledge and being brought up thorough Catholics J I will tell you in a few words what it does for you If it could speak it would say though its framers may not mean it- it would say -' I am a modern monstrosity so contrived no to flatter all sections of the community except tie R im in Catholic those miserable creatures must be got rid of somehow, but first of all they must be kicked and insulted My predecessor, born in lbs, was a fair speci- men of persecution for that day but we are older now, and have advanced further into light That bill forced the thousands of the Catholic poor, and the rich too, to pay for the education of other people's children, in schools they could not use themselves But I am an improvement on that I am going to build great Grammar schools for boys and the Catholics shall pay equally with those who use them for those also Palaces for girls shall also be established where girls shall learn to be discontented possibly with their horns and with their lot Catholics, though they cannot use these, shall pay for them too, as if they did Then I mean, moreover, to multiply the schools they cannot use and reduce the fees, and Catholics shall bear their burden here as well to this I mean to add about the most exquisite insult possible that is to have each Public seen in having so many children, furnished with a class-room which Catholics cannot use In this class room all the various denominations whose very existence is a protest against the Catholic religion, shall teach their various creeds and as a necessary consequence condemn the tooth of Catholics, so that Catholics will be paying for the very buildings in which, day after day, and hour after hour, then religion is or may be denounced in terms well known to all To this insult, perfect in its kind I am going to add an injury equally perfect in its nature Having ignored every single just demand, having made the Catholics pay, as has been described, I then carry the war into the enemies ramp The) still have Denominational schools, they love them, they are proud of them, they f rected them at great oxppnsn-these I mean to knock on the head roi, since Catholics are the poorest section of the community, and since their small means are forced from them to my for the education of other people's children how will they be able soon as they are to pay as it were out of both pockets at once, to educate their own as well as those < t others r How can they keep pace with the reduction of toes ? They miss struggle for a time like fish in a net but we will take them out of their 1 bath of supernatural light,' and if they do not become n fr dels or ranters, they will become nondescripts - and anything even a blackfellow, is better than a Papist " Such is the language that the new bill so far as I know anything of it speaks to me I do not mean to insinuate that all this was intended, possibly, such a picture as I have pointed did not consciously enter the intentions of legs lation I am8inipl\ speaking of facts which are hard things That is the language of the bill, to any intelligent man who has ears to hear, and to every intelligent Catholic who his a soul, and a heart beating in his body It is a modem I monstrosity of cruelty and the ann j, so far as we are con- i cerned and I believe every fair-minded man in the community will sy sympathise with us, assist us to preserve Four freedom of conscience, and to obtain our just and self evident rights Why should we alone be ignored ? YY he should our cry not be heard ? YY by should Catholics and only Catholics, be trampled on and insulted in the way that I have described > We can not stand in the way of others we rejoice when they are happy , when they can feel that their children are doing well, it is a fine pleasure to us AYHiat pleasure or happiness is there in seeing us sad and broken, like slaves and serfs, who have no friends, and are as outcasts of the people > YYIiat pleasure in this nineteenth century, is there in producing so grave an irritation, so galling a wound, as will be produced if that bill becomes law I cannot believe it I will not believe that the majority, the sound portion of the community, will stand by silently and not support a us in our jLSt struggle for liberty and fair play You working men of Balmain, you Catholics of this colony to whom any voices mv words will reach, be true to yourselves in this great crisis four religion the one dearest thing in life, is at stake. If your children are not brought up in thorough Catholic schools they cannot become thorough Catholic men and a Catholic who is not a thorough in his faith is generally the father of a line of indifferentism and apostates. And you, my' own English countrymen, who love fair-play and a just measure, i why not join me in your own way in seeing justice done One of you has already sent his generous subscrip- tion of £5, and a most kind letter to Father Dillon. I seem to see many of you round me, if I mistake not. Let me enlist your sympathy in behalf of a righteous cause. Your hearts are true and stout, I know and you cannot stand by and not join the weaker side in supporting its just rights against what will be, as you know, a terrible tyranny and oppression. As for myself it is my voca- tion, and my most solemn duty to defend and preserve the faith of my people in me it would be no heroism to lay down my life in its defence, or to spill my blood out of love for my flock. That is my profession, as a soldier's is to go to war and to risk his life for his Queen and country. Let not the world think that the Catholic faith can be blotted out by any instrument however modern and subtle in its operation. It has lived 1800 fears and more, and it will abide to the very end. it is my part, during my short span, to protect it and I hope, by God's grace, to spend my life and strength and such little talent as 1 may possess in its defence. Remember, Union is strength, and Perseverance alone is crowned. Let us unite, let us persevere, and in the end we shall be placed on an equality with our fellow-colonists, and M~-_&& briW&J;^CatfecuiojMl-rfitt fierceness J___¡_k.[ without being deprived for doing so of our just helped secular instruction We are strong numbers bureau is a righteous one and 1st us use every legitimate need for bringing it to a victorious issue w* His Grace was frequently heartily cheered during the pour in of his address and when he concluded three nason cheers were given in his favour b 8 Mr OCoNNOit, MI A folk wea ona expressed the belief that there was a very dark time coming in the colony, in which there would be a great Mruegle not between Catholicism and Protest raisin but between Christianity and Infidelity YY uh regard to the educational measure referred to by Archbishop Vaughan it should be remembered that it had not yet passed the Lens lature, but had merely been conceived by one whose inT nurse was only equalled by his hatred of Catholicism There were, however, Protestants in these late Asaeoi bly who were a credit to humanity and he would not lend their sanction to this tyrannical measure and. he had no doubt that the Catholics would triumph in the end as they deserved to do (Cheers) ' Um Bishop of Armidale also delivered a short address in the course of which he characterised the few Edu national Bill as an unjust measure in its effect upon the Catholic portion of the community. and trusted that the Less stature would not see the justice of permitting the Catht lies to exercise their freedom to the full The ceremony of laying and blessing the foundation stone was then performed by the Archbishop Dunne the proceedings contributions were solicited aid of the building fund with such success that £406 7s 6d was obtained, principally in sums of £2 and under
