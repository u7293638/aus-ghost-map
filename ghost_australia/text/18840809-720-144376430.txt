The Desperado aud tbc Puritan. About the year 1651 the most influential man in San Antonia was an alleged desperado named Bob Augustine. Bob came to San Antonio with a fearful record. He enjoyed the reputation of having killed a dozen or so of men, and was respected accordingly. While he was in San Antonia he did not re auce me census au an, uuc inac was noc uis fault. lie had a seductive way of drawing his eightcen-iuch Arkansas toothpich and ex amining it critically with a sinister smile while humbly requesting the temporary loan of 55. Thus was it that Bob vent about acquiring wealth andrs^rm personal teic^^^^^M bat creating no funerals. Them, were n^^^^^H that Bob was playing blufl, but tbi^^^^^^H after ho had marched away. ' ^^^^^^^| It was during the reign oi Bob Augusn^^^^^^ ' the long-range roarer of Calnvcras Canyon|^^^^| as he familiarly called hitatdf , thal.a younj^^^H man from Boston, named John Winthroji, ^^^fl came to San Antonio, presumably in search ^H of jtealtb, as be brought very little with him. ~ Hewns far gc-ne in consumption, and nothing but tbe fact that he bad but a short time lo live, unless the climate of western Texas raved him, induced him to come to San Aotonio. As everybody carried a pistol, Winthrop did not care to insult public de cency by going unarmed. Besides, such a' course might as seriously interfere with his restoration to health au putting on a clean shirt. His Puritan training caused him to revolt at tlic idea of carrying firearms, so ho re sorted to artiGce. He wore a holster, but, instead of keeping a pistol in it, he had his cash funds stored away in it, and nsbody was the wiser for it. On the contrary, Win throp was looked up to by tbe best citizens just the same as if he was loaded down with deadly weapons. Of course, everybody tried to make tliÂ« stranger from Massachueotts feel iis comfortable as if he was at home ; so he was told all about Bob Augustine, the long ranged roarer, at least ten times a day, and he was advised not to be particular in asking security for the debt iu cage the roarer wanted to barrow a small loan, unless lin (YViothrop) did uot wish to reeain hia heiilth. Tlie loug-ranged roarer sauntered into Wintiirop's room at l!i(? hotel, h;it before tbe desperado could open his mouth or draw a weapon the umortunato Yankee threw back hie coat, and with trembling fingers tugged at hi* pistol bolster to get at his money to ap peaau the would-be asaaesin. On the other Iiaud, as --:oou as the roarer saw Winthrop tryiuz to get out his pistol he turned as pale as a ghost. Tho uileged desperado's knees knocked together, the cold sweat boiled out all over him, and he extended his hand and said tremblingly : 'Don't draw, good Mr. Yankee. I was only trying to fool you. My bold Arkaimas heart beats 'or you, my boy. I jest wanted to tench you a lesson. Xever let any durncd galoot get the drop on you. If anybody in sults you just tell them that Bob Augustine, tbe roarer, is ;;Our friend.' WinthrGp, vcho was more scared, if pos sible, than the roarer, replied : ' Oh, I'll give you what you want,' and kept on tugging at the holster, which came unbuckled. With a yell of dismay the desperado passed out through the window, carrying off the sash, and ran down Commodore street, the principal thoroughfare, with the sash on his neck, howling, ' Police I police 1 ' closely pursued by Wintbrop, wbo kept ou tugging at his bolster, trying to get out his money, ho believing that the desperado was running to his room to procure a shot-gun with nhich to commit murder. All that afternoon Win throp kept on hunting tbe roarer, to pur chase peace on any terms, and tbe roarer hid himself to avoid tbe pistol of tbe Boston man. Next morning the long-ranged roarer of tbe Caiaveras canyon was missing, and Wintbrop was the lion of the day for having run off the terror of the Alamo City.
