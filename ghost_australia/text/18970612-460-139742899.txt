"W.B." seems quite willing to believe that frogs so found may result from Hwiitaneous generation, in favour of which there js not the faintest shadow of evidence.

Wilson Dobbs writes: -".John Lang, barrister-at-law (a confrere of W. C. Went worth's nt Sydney College in 1842) wrote the aeeount of Fisher's Ghost that appeared in .Household Words,' March 5, 1853. This and other short sketcnes of young colonial days were collected and republished in book form under tluec different titles, thoutfi practically the Rune contents. In 'Australasian Bibliography,' Sydney, 1893, tliey run as follows:-'Botany Bay, _ . *n^.. _ n ^ V M A ..ni ? < # V 10 ".tl . Heco'lections of Botany Bay," London, n.d. (about ISStj). lu the beginning of 1SS0 Mr. E. \Y. Cole, Book Arrade, Nelbourne, brought out a ro.u ini r.f the 'Clever Criminals' edition, with the 'Hotany Bay' title page. A copy of that issu» lies lxfore m«, and I find that 'Fisher's Ghost' figures as the"first tale on the cover, but is called "The Ghost upon the Bail' in the body of book. The names of the principals and places (with the exception of Fisher, who is called John, not Frederick) are all altered l.einj: even different from those given in "House hold Words'-out of respect for relatives con cerned, as set forth in preface. The ghost story is considerably embellished, for it is over twelve months aiter Fisher's disappearance that 'an old man, one David Weir, eaw, seated on a rail, the well-known form of Mr. Fisher.' A week after tbis, when Weir is ip the company of (wo others, 'the apparition of Mr. Fisher, exactly ns lie was in the flesh, "was 4'palpable to the Ritfit" ni ail three uiea ' Then, to heig'ircn the interest further, no rain {s Mid Iwvc f.;ll«n for 15 months, so the . blacks are able to track the murderer's footprints, unobliterated for over a, veir.

I have also in my possession a booklet entitled 'Tenete Pernio,' published by <Vmx.i., ijing. and Oo" Melbourne (al»ut 3SS0), in which there is another variant of the chost story.

The only instance of ghosts coming to give evidence of murder were those of Banquo and Hamlet's father, and Shakespeare was not considered an authority to be relied ^upon in such a case as that of Fisher.'

"Veritas" (Mount Morgan).-It is only the expe- i rienced_ eye that can distinguish between amber and imitations of it. There is no ready test. "C.H.L," asks to _be_ referred to some definition i of thp word "Alienist," which occurs in one of Dr. Connn Doyle's stories. The context runs | thus:-"For a case of mental aberration they consulted the eminent alienist, Mr. Fraser j Brown." In Webster's Dictionary the term is rendered "one who treats diseases of the mind." The "Edinburgh Review" is given as the autho rity, and the French equivalent is alieniste. "A.E.W."-Next week. "Russian Jew."-"Rusca" will reduce corpulency.

S.A.) aiks for solutions of the following questions "1. A uonts to have £150 in the Savings Bank at the end of 9 years. Reckoning the interest at per cent, per annum, what amount must lie tave annually V Let the required amount be denoted by £x ; and , let I, a, b, e, d, e, f, g, h, be the successive terms of I a geometric series whose common ratio is 1*035. j Then the value of x will be found hy salving the "equation x 1+a+b+c+d+e+f+g+h Y = 150. This equation can be put in (be form : x (11)3.i) to the 9th power-1 J- = 6*25 With the help of a table of logarithms it is easy to find that (1-03-i) to the 9th power = 1 -362896. Hence x will l>e found by dividintr 6'25 by 0-302896. The result is 14-467 (very nearly), Alii £x = £14407 == £14 9j. 4d. (very nearly). " 2. U borrows from A £337 10s., to be repaid quarterly at the rate of lOs.per week at 4 per cent, per annum. Interest is to be paid quarterly, and , the part of the £0 10s. remaining over after the pay ment of interest at the end of each quarter is to lie deducted from the principal. In bow many years will the debt be extinguished T , Take 13 weeks as equivalent to a quarter of a year, and let tlie number of quarterly p-iynients required to exlinguith the debt be x. Then x may be found by a long series of simple calculations of the fol lowing type : £ Original debt 337-5 Quarter's interest 3 375 34U-&75 First repayment 6o Debt at end of one quarter SSI-375 Quarter's interest 3*34375 327-71875 Second repayment C*5 Debt at end ol two quarters 331*21675 And so on, the decimals being worked out correot to live places. But the required value of x mar be found much more ca ily by equaling the sum of the amounts at compound interest at 1 per cent per quarter of the successive payments of £6-5 to the amount for x quarters of £337'5 at 1 per cent per quarter compound interest The first of these expressions will be found bv multiplying <5-6 by ihe sum of x terms of a geometrical series, whoto first term is 1 and whose common ratio is 1*01; and the second of them will bs found by multiplying- 337*5 by [(1*01) to the power x]. The lesulting equation when re duced gives (1*01) to the power x = 2 OS. Then with the help of a table of logarithms It is easily found that x = 73-60.'. Hence it follows that the time required for the extinction of the debt is 18 years 6 months (very "early).
