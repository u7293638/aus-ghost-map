LITERARY COINCIDENCES. (From the Daily News.) While it is acknowledged that all jocular stones or chestnuts are as ancient as the everlasting hills the world is slow to acknowledge that other repetitions in literature may be chance coincidences Everyone knows that scientific discoveries are often made separately by different persons. The case of Mr. Wallace and Mr. Darwin is familiar, and, if scientific critics wore as foolish as many reviewers both gentlemen would have been accused of pilfering from Lucretius or Lamarck There are only so many possible combinations of ideas in the world, and different people must often hit on the same combination It is familiarly known to the Psychical Society that two persons may, at the same moment, dream the same dream Much more than my wits jump, when in search of a plot for a story But the basest sort of critic never can or never will believe this, and it would be hard to find a successful author who has not been branded as a plagiarist Ihn unsuccessful author escapes condemnation on this score Some years ago a young: author, whohadinado a great success with his first book, had all the do id cats and rotten eggs of cheap reviewers hurled at him because the plot of his second book resembled that of an older novel In his book, and in its predecessor, a man tried to make wealth and home by publishing the M3 of another as his own Now, the elder of the two romances, though not, perhaps, very widely known was a common object on the railway bookstalls Was it very likely that a young author, on the threshold of his career, would be such a fool as to steal, from a very accessible source, a novel about stealing a novel ? It was not in nature that any man, short of being a born idiot, should do such a thing The fundamental idea was one that might have occurred to any mind it had been used by a third person, Mr Grenville Murray, and was, indeed, so obvious that it may have been employed a dozen times Who first used the notion of the person lost at sea believed to be dead, and turning up again ? It is as old as the Odyssey It occurs in Chinese , yet it is always being discovered by novelists, as Mr. Gondish discovered the tale of Alfred and the burnt cakes Then there is the uncle who makes the very will that he should not have made, with the exact provisions which act as a dam on the stream of true love Mr Hardy employs tins elderly device in " Two on a Power," but only on imbecile would accuse him of having stolen it. The notion is conspicuously obvious Nobody who thinks it worth picking up can miss this glittering jewel of fancy Occasionally the coincidences are not coincidences at all two men go to Africa in search of a very old woman, and find her. This was declared to be pi igionsed from a novel of Moore's, in which an Athenian goes to Egypt in search of immortality and finds a young lady who converts him to the Christian dogma lue shadowy resemblance hero does not even amount to a casual coincidence Again, if two persons have to describe the same event, and describe it well, they must tell much the same story, must be in a solo " together Yet one of them will call heaven and earth to witness that he described a submarine earthquake in the Peckham Rye Gazette before the other described it in a novel, and that the new earthquake must be his old earthquake, stolen and mutilated The resources of spite, ignorance, and vanity are endless Very often, when a book or play succeeds, some foolish person declares that it is progresses from a play or story of his own, which not only did not succeed, but was never even acted or printed On the face of things it is hardly improbable that an inventive and popular author will go about stealing from the waste-paper basket of those who have been tried and found wanting It is easier by a great deal to invent than to suffer, though, in the nature of things the some notions may occur to him who fads as to him who succeeds The action is not all the bottle, not an eighth of the battle success comes from the treatment of the notion Mrs Burnett wrote a popular tale about a small boy in a velvet tunic, and somebody who had written a tale, not popular, about another child in a velvet tunic, went about claiming the tunic, and averring that the infant had been kidnapped Charity be beyond all things, spite believeth anything, and probably many very dull persons believe will this kind of nonsense, and some of the mud sticks In Byron's letters we see that he was always forseeing charges of plagiarism and making himself anxious about them Nobody who is fortunate enough to become known can ov and the rotten eggs of envy Edgar Poe, who should have known better, used to try to prove that Longfellow was a plagiarist Cietins may still be found who think that he "stole" "Hiawatha from the Finnish 'Kalowala " Poo himself was accused of "robbing" a book on conchology or botany, or some such subject for attacking Long- fellow, he deserved to be made uncomfortable There are coincidences that seem too close in detail to be accidental Thus an Insb Amoncou wrote a good tale of an invisible but palpable ghost So did M Guy de Maupassant So far all might be comes duties But when an English author in a story took a cost of the ghost of plaster of Paris, and when the American had done the same, the theory of chance coincidence had to be worked very hard And, indeed, there was no chance in the matter. The American who had won its way into legend and chance conversation, without name of author, or knowledge that it had ever been published Any water may blamelessly adopt, with certain limits tions, any " masterless " floating anecdote In the same way, an American and an English story about the marriage of a certain Sally have lately exercised the pursuer of plagiarism Apparently both tales were independently founded on the same facts, on the Home anecdote Where many authors are lying in wait for good and useful anecdotes, a land of coincidences must occur which look very like plagiarism But the real crime of plagiarism is as rare as charges of plagiarism are common Neither Milton, nor Moliere, nor Shakespeare, nor Bunyan has escaped the imbecile assaults of the impotent and incompetent. _
