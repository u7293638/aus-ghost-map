We are pleased to notice that the Hon! J.

Joseph Jones said h£ had to re port very satisfactorily indeed on the progress, made. There was a gradual increase in the sides, both at the cectral ? and at the branch, in fact, the increase, ' in the sales were most extraordinary, I being* 45 per cent, increase^ over the corresponding period of last year. This growth encouraged the committee to .; push on with, the opening of other branches. Premises had .been taken and-a;shop opened at; 378vBrunswickr ; street, .Piteroyi'and the business there wag very satisfactory. Contracts had been settled and bnildings were in cour£ 3 of erection' at Burwood-road, Hawthorn. Sites were being sought for at Brighton and Pootscray, and the committee expected,r before meeting the ; members a£auv either to have shops opened,'or buildings,in course of erection at those places. The meet ing closed with a vote of thanks to'the chairman ', ,The evidence given - at the inquest held this week on the body of a boy not, .five, years of'age ~ shows how careful parents ought to be in the matter of the use ef spirits.' ,' The mother of the deceasd child, who' re sides at Hotham, gave evidence to show that, she left a bottle containing a quarter of a "pint of brandy* on her bedroom table, when she got up. .The child being left to play about the room got hold of the bottle, and .'drank' > so much of the contents that it expired shortly afterwards. , ^ f - The" South Melbourne' branch of the Melbourne Savings' Bank has made< splendid-progress duringthe last quarter. .

This alteratiou'in the contract was made in consequence of the substitution o£ wrought for cast iron pipes to be used in-thenew:30-inch main to belaid from: Preston. ' 1 j ' The subject of supplying ammunition! to rifle clubs: at half-cost price was dis-: cussed at the Council of Defence on, Wednesday, in' consequence of,the, heavy; demands made upon the depart ment forKammunition. Rifle clubs have hiUierto been supplied with as much l ammunition as they applied for at 5s. . per hundred rounds. The price actually paid by the department for the ammu nition is'9s.per 100 rounds. It is now 'ascertained that freer use is made of the privilege of buying ammunition from the department at;half price than was contemplated. Four rifle clubs, composed of 137 men, have ? actually ob tained 84,000 rounds in seven months, and one ofthese clubs has been supplied at the rate of 1000 rounds per man. About £5000>annual}y.ris spent by; the; department in ammunition, including, a freedistributiontoeach.manof j 100 rounds. The' Council *of Defence de cided on Wednesday to limit ' the' sup ply at 'half price to 200 rounds per year, but members of the rifle clubs can obtain as many rounds as they please through the department atcostprice.
