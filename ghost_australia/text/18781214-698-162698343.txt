Original Poetry. Melancholy. What thick, impenetrable mist is this That shrouds my soul in dark and dismal folds; That robs me of the very sight of bliss, And in its noisome grip my senses holds? 'Tis thou, damn'd Melancholy—hateful foe— Whose Stygian gloom is o'er my spirit thrown; Who poisons every well of joy with woe, And turns my every song into a groan. But thou art not an uninvited guest, Whose presence has been forc'd my thoughts among; Thou'rt here at least by indirect request Of Folly and her wild attendant throng. All energy and thought thou dost benumb, With mad and ghost-like fancies cloud'st the brain; Mine eyes are sightless, and my tongue is dumb, Whilst reason scarce withstands the racking strain. Where shall I find the rest my soul so needs? How soothe the grief an angry conscience feels! Or how redeem a past of wild misdeeds Beneath whose stroke my fair-born future reels! The parched sand the cool green waters lave, And drown the heat that Iate did fev'rish burn; Shall I oblivion seek beneath the wave? Ah! no; such coward rest shall manhood spurn. A better day shall dawn, and brighter skies Be canopy to him whose courage true Shall help him o'er misfortune's ills to rise; Whilst virtue shall his faculties renew. Omnipotence in tender pity bends, To shield a soul from self-inflicted fears; A conq'ring strength to drooping weakness lends, And raiseth smiles on ground late sown with tears. JOHN PARKER. Sydney, December 8, 1878.
