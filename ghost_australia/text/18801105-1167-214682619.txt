TO CORRESPONDENTS.. ' C.S.â€”We cannot publish your letter, because we believe your view to be erroneous. The Chnstian Church is agreed that there are in the Unity of the Godhead three Persons of one substance, power, and eternity. That the' Father is not the Son, nor the Son the Father, nor the Holy Ghost the Father or the Son, nor vice versa; yet. that these three Persons form one undivided, incomprehensible God. This doctrine transcends human'understanding, but is clearly revealed in the Soriptures.
