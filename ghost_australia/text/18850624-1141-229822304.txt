THE V-A.T.C. BRACELET MEETXMG-. With capital entries, a programme framed specially to " fetch' the ladies, and the course in capital order, the Juoe Meeting of the Victoria Amateur Turf Club promises to turn but a big success, and although op to the present little or no betting on either of the events . has been transacted, " The Bracelet" is bound to be the medium of heavy wagering at the post. . .
