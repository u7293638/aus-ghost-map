SERIALS AND MAGAZINES FOR, NOVEMBER. TiNsLEi's is the first specimen for the forthcoming month which has at present reached us and as it has so come, so shall it also be Bei ved by our saying of it at once, as it merits, that it is an excellent speci- men, carefully prepared, and most satisfactorily arranged its readers, however, cannot but regret that the expected portion of " Austin Friars " will not be found in this number, especially as that omission, according to a notice upon the table of contents, is ' owing to the lamented indisposition of the authoress Upon the heels of Tinsley s Vaga me our old friend and favourite Blackwood treads so closely in point of time in reaching us, that we will not defer mention of its qualities for a single day, especially as it is to all intents and purposes one of the very best numbers which the present year his seen Although it is early to speak of the merits of the new story, ' Earl's Dene," with the first portion of which the November number of Maga opens, there is more than sufficient indication of protrude in it to assure the reader that it is the work of no ordinary of common place writer The second article is an elaborate and earnest review of an article which recently appeared in the Quarterly Magazine, and made so great a sensation at the time that it has not since died away the title of this article is "The Jewish Re- formation and the Talmud,' and stays on and states not in opposition to the views promulgated in the treatise to which it especially refers Cornelius O'Dowd their supplies us with two of his racy article on Dr Cumming and the Council, and "The Claims of the 1 crane," which will be admired for the humour with which they abound, it for no other reason. This is followed by a most elaborately written and carefully considered review of " The Land Question of Ireland," the point and force which may be ascertained by the following few words of its concluding sentence "All human regulations are apt to work out some wrong in their effects and no people have a truer and nobler intolerance of unfair ness, or a sincere desire to correct it, than the English, but the manifestations of public feeling on every side proclaim also that they are profoundly aware of the gulf which lies between reform and revolution, and that they will not allow either Irish Fenians or English Democrats to hurl the most fundamental principles of Eoeictj-property-over the precipice. ' Another new story, under the title of " John,' claims consideration, from the manner and method of its commencement The next article tells most charmingly of the habits, customs, and peculiarities of a modern French water- ing place, under the title of " Saint Lloy-sur les Dames ' Then the comparatively unknown subject of "The Taioese Saga," furnishes ample food for the delectation and information of those who are versed, or wished to become so, in Scandinavian lore and the number winds up with a brilliant and exhaustive paper upon " Scotland in Parliament" -the "Poor Law Inquiry," which proves that the agitation in the last session by the Scotch members, if continued, will, it it succeed," have no other result than to lower the reputation of that portion of the British dominions, diminish her legitimate influence in Parliament, and give the way to gross mismanagement ' the "Aero Monthly Magazine is also another of the earliest serial arrivals, and abounds with material of the most attractive character Amongst its most salient papers is one upon Lord Byron, by Cyrus Redding, which cannot fail to command attention, inasmuch as its indignation against Mrs Beecher Stone is of the most vehement character, accusing her indeed of conduct and falsehood to such an extent as to "treat" nothing else than an " the pillory " In other particulars, the Aem Monthly is, as indeed it always is, most interesting , but of all its features, the editor's Mr W Harrison Ainsworth-own story, ' Hilary St Ives," continues to carry away the palm , for, without any question, it is one of the very best specimens of that gentleman's talent he has ever given to the world, so far from there being any sign of weakness in any one of its characteristics it is full of the strongest evidence of increased vigour and enlarged inventive powers J ia.«'« Magazine opens with a most elaborate, and we must confess, to our abilities, far from clear essay on what the writer is pleased to call "The Present State of Religious Con- troversy " Mrs, Stowe's Byronic romance a condemned with vigour, in advance, as it appears, by the postscript to the article, of the exposure of its falsehood in Mr Murray B new serial, The Academy Except for the sake of the feelings of the height, and the reputation of the poet, it seems a great waste of critical power to discuss the mise rable fiction for which Mrs Stowe has received the more miserable wage ""Jabez Oliphant" rather drags in this section The account, however, of the baths of Santa Catarina in the Alps is agreeable reading, and the paper in which that staple article of romance, ghosts of the past, is contrasted with ghosts of the present, and the development theory of adaptation to modern habits illustrated, is well worth perusal Colburn's United Service Magazine has an article on the future of cavalry organisation in the face of the tremendous modern improvements in firearms, founded on Lieutenant Colonel Denison's pamphlet, and the experiences of the American generals in the late war " The Cruise with the Mediterranean fleet in 1868," "The Accounts of Sham fights at Home and Abroad," and the continua- tion of Mr. Eardley Wilmot's "Notes on Madagascar and its inhabitants," all of which are very interesting articles. Macmillan without a word, after another month's interval, in explanation of the universe facility, not to say anything more, afforded by its edges to the circulation of Mrs Stowe s By rome Romance, appears, determined to forget its errors, and to fall back on the contributions and contributors usually met with in its pages. In the opening paper of the present number, the Librarian at Lambeth commences an agreeable but somewhat light and sensational sketch of the leading incidents in the lives of the temporary residents in the Archiepiscopal residence Mrs. Craig continues her clever, but far from agreeable, tale of the "Brave Lady," one of the hardest of her impersona- tions A few brief remarks on the Messianic traces, in the Homeric Legends," as indicated by Mr. Gladstone in his Juventus Mundi, some further notes on the Athanasian Creed, a most interesting account of the "Maison Paternelle of Murray,' and a really clear account, with a map, of the Suez Canal, make up a more than average number of this popular serial The Dublin University against completes, of course, " the Wyvern MyStery," already published as a complete novel, and commences a new tale, apparently of a sensational type, entitled "Annie with the Madonna face " The opening paper on " Poland and Lithuania," conveys a great deal of curious information on a portion of Europe frequently talked about by, but in reality little known to, English politicians. " Trois Temps Charlie" is a clever little tale and "The Glimpses of Prehistoric Human very fairly summarises the Duke of Argyll s paper on Primeval Man Amongst the most acceptable and welcome of these more modern specimens of light literature, we must specially mention The Churchman's Shilling Magazine which if it were valuable from no other cause, would especially be so for having supplied from the so called Fathers-the earliest Church writers, after the Canon of the New Testament was closed-pasooges which entirely demolish the assertion of the present Pope's letter with reference to Dr Cumming, that" at cannot be denied or doubted that Jesus Christ Himself, in order that He might apply to all men the fruits of His redemption, built here on earth upon Peter His only Church, that is the one holy and Apostolic Church and gave to him all power that was necessary for preserving whole and inviolate the deposit of faith, and for delivering the same faith to all peoples, tribes, and nations," ka These references are furnished by Mr G Tragen, but, although they state nothing more than has been proved time out of mind, they are so sure reply put together that any one may be, read with an answer on the spur of the moment by means of retaining them in his, memory. In other respects this very ably conducted Magazine will be found as useful and interesting as it invariably has been from the time of its original publication to the present month V Paul's does not contninsomuch entertaining matter as we usually expect to find in it, the subjects not being so satisfactorily chosen as usual the Vat portions of the number are those which are entirely confined to fiction These are light and entertaining, but they scarcely compensate for the heaviness of the other portions RelgtMM is a very fair specimen of a very welcome friend, Its contents are such- ' clearly dWersifieälrr^TrTr.-r I 'glacier, and the West aT«,?»103^8 of every class of an exceedingly wen~T*p ""ith respect to quality by Mr. W*&?ÄSnfiS Wt 1916 continuations!
