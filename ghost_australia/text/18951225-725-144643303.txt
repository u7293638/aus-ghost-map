The mill-lade that I Jed to it was rotten, and the mill-pond that fed tiie stream wag drained and grew weeds &nd; flowers and rudiea -instead of providing water for the mill. Joan MacLeod stood at the little window of the mill kitchen on one of those evenings. A orescent moon was in tbe sky. It appeared to hang in the gray mist. She turned a penny in her pocket, as she looked mechani cally ont, and thought of a wish. 1 Dinna ye, lass/ said her mother sharply from tho fireside. * Things gang wrong o' thome^r* wi'oot fairly temp'm' Providence yon iryu * 1 Which wye?* said tho girl, still staring out of the window. 4 Yon's tbo now meen, and ye are looking at her thro* glass,' said the woman severely. 4 Ye winna get your wu&h;, and ill may happen o* it.'
