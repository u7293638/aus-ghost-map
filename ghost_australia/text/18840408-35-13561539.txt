Our guest needed no distinction in our hands He would lively quite intent to have passed away without any sign of public approval without any expression of public regret at his loving Ter this noiseless departure would hat a been 111 perfect his money with the unobtrufuvenei-s and calmness of his life (Hear, hear ; But when we reflect upon that life, or so much of it as has been passed under our very c\ as I think we have acted rashly in what we have done (Hear, hear ) If the value of public services is to be measured by the singular capacity of the servant, and the difficulties in the way of the performance of the service who can fairly estimate the value of his patriotic labours i Occupying the first place in his profession, overwhelmed with professional engagements, labouring hard as even the most brilliant men must do to overtake his engagements night after night he has been for many years with us in Parliament, advising on and patiently Novosti killed, all public business corro ting, amending, and aiding legislation (Cheers) So that if he has been elsewhere the brilliant, the laborious the successful advocate, he has been with us nothing less than the standing counsel of Parlament, retained and reworded 01 h by his own strong sense of duty and patriotism (Cheers,) of all men he has been as you know, the most punctual in his attendance, the most vigilantly his criticism (Hear, hear ). If he had posFCisod abundant leisure and had been stimulated by political ambition he could not have been more unwearying in his industry (Hear, hear) And you know that he his had no leisure, and that the country has nothing to off 1 to him but its gratitude (Hear, her While his unselfish service is one of the few pleating subjects of contemplation in 0111 politicals}»tom, it 10a constant and an eloquent reply itch to thOse men of fortune of leisure, and of culture (of whom we have so many who shun the smallest nominee for their country, and whose ignoble here niUbt run Glittering like a break in the op on sunshine or they are unblest (Hear hear ) Gentlemen, if is with a peculiar feeling of sadness that I say just now farewell to our friend You know from my position in the House how great are my personal obligations in Parliament to his sagacity, his generosity and his chivalrous courtesy (Hear, hear ). In these critical times we have need of these fine public abilities, and in losing him we shall lose. much of them Gentlemen, I give you his health, wishing him all happiness, and a speedy return to those who hold his character in such honour and have for himself so sincere an affection (Others ) Mr Darley who was received with cheers, said. Gentlemen, I need scarcely remind you how often you must all of you have admired and envied the powers of description which m hon friend possesses Cheers ) there is no subject, however uninteresting it may be, that he does not throw a glamour over. We all remember that Inscribed Stock Bill (Hear, hear ) Whether it be the Inscribed Stock Bill or the toast of " Our Guest," he is equally happy (Hear, hear ). If I possessed the powers of my friend this evening, in the presence of such an assembly, I could not convey to you my heartfelt thanks for the great and unde- served compliment you have paid to me (Hear, hear ). When I first received the invitation to this assemblage I thought, " How is it that you have come to receive such an honour as this, at the hands of the first assemblage in New South Wales ? What have you done" and I remembered something that I had heard before, of one of England's greatest soldiers Sir Henry Lawrence, on whose grave at Lucknow are these words-" Here lies Sir Henry Lawrence, who tried to do his duty " (Cheers ) I Sad to myself, comparing a very great thing with a very small one " It is possible that the Legislative Council of New South Wales are honouring von because they think you have tried to do your duty (Cheers.) I have been now nearly 10 years a member of the Legislative Council of New South Wales if I live to the 25th September next it will be exactly 16 years-and if I look back on my career I confess I sometimes feel how little I have done, and how much opportunity there was to do good But, oh an hon friend has reminded me, I belong to a profession which is a jealous one and you will agree with me that the man who looks after his wife and family is probably the best citizen yon can have (Cheers ) And I felt that my first duty was to them in my professional career and after that I have done my little best in the Legislature of the colony. (Cheers ) I was reminded to-day on looking back and thinking over matters that when I first joined the Legislative Council there were 23 members of whom 10 now survive One of those who have passed away was a man whose name will never be forgotten in New South Wales -Sir E Doas- Thomson-(cheors)-and another was John Hubert Plunkett (Cheers ) Sir E Deas, Thomson was a great statesman We talk of our free to do here from whence is it derived ? We all know what the Dorset houison tariff was, and to it we owe what free trade we possess When Mr John Hubert Plunkett was a high toned, courteous gentleman, and with such gentlemen to guide me when I entered the Legislature, I do not think I deserved much credit if in endeavouring to follow their stops I have done some little good for 15 years I have been a member and since that time many other members have come into the Legislative Council I see here the oldest friend I have in that Council-Sir Alfred Stephen (Cheers ) I was reminded this evening that before I had the honour of being in the colony I had the pleasure of meeting sir Alfred Stephen I was a junior member of the Munster Bar, and I had the honour of being introduced t ; him there two years of ter was dr I came to the colony, but I was wavering whether I should arrive here or not I was seeking for the best colony to stay in, and there were certain reasons which induced me to stop in Victoria, for my wife's family were connected with it Sir Alfred Sti puen recommended 1111 not neared me you strongly to remain in this colony and I took his 1 advice and as tod upon it and I have never regretted it (Cheers ) I ascribe a great deal of un Success in life to following the advice I received on shares is n I must say I do regret that in the interest of my family I should leave the colony just now at this particular season when I might aid the Government in the passing of the Land Bill which is now before the Legmktnrc (Cheers ). That b U, if it comes before the Legislative Council, should arouse all the un- sold _ services of that body. I thank you for the honour you have done me (Cheers The Chairman then said Gentlemen, when this gathering was resolved upon, it was unanimously agreed that it would be incomplete both as is regarded our [ nest and ourselves it we failed to avail ourselves of the honour of asking the attendance of our President (Hear, hear) If the branch of the Legislature to which we have the honour to belong stands, as it does, deep vedly high in the estima- tion of our fellow colonists it owes the distinction in no small degree to the character, the intellect, and the political history of its President (Ghi ere) He brought to the chair of the Council a career in the representative of branch of the Legislature without blemish, a learned acquaintance with Parliament try liv, a, natural dignity and a perfect pass nee (GhoBrs ) It is due to ourselves to say that we do not inordinately try this last precious quality (Laughter ) I am afraid the daring and tempestuous spirited public life would find our atmosphere one of intolerable calm, and would look upon us with a mingled feeling of pity and amusement (Laughter ) But though we have not the fierceness of the conflict I think in most cases we have not a little to do with the achievement of the victory (Hear, hear ) And to our President we are indebted for the maintenance of that tone in which the w 01 k of udehboritivo chamber can alone be satisfactorily conduct d (Cheers ) In honouring him we honour ourselves, and our instituting, and though on other grounds the title may be denied to us, in this we may rest assured that in honouring him we are thoroughly representative of the feeling of the country (Cheers ) I propose to you " The President " (Cheers ) Sir John E Hay, who was received with cheers, said Mr Chairman and Gentlemen, When I listened to your chairman to night proposing the health of the guest of the evening I could not help feeling that he seemed to feel him self in an unusual decree tied down to the actual facts of the cobb (hear, hear-and he did not in the slightest degree allow himself to go into the realms of imagination that he did not go over to the height that we ourselves would have wished to go in price of the gentleman whose departure we have met to celebrate But when he followed In proposing my own health I confess to you I felt considerable difficulty in rising to my own identity in the brilliant idea which he pro- ented to you (laughter) I can only say in response that I am obliged to him for the picture which he has drawn, and further, that all I can hear for myself on this or any other occasion is contained in the epitaph which our guest of this evening has quoted-that I have tried to do my duty (Cheers ) Gentlemen, it I am allowed to add anything to what my friend the chairman had stud with regard rd to the ghost of the evening, and to say it from my own standpoint, this is the standpoint of the President of the Legislative Council I would simply say that what I have cheered all along, since I first occupied the the position, in our friend Mr Darley, is the extreme usefulness of his, career in the Los lative Council (Cheers ) Sir, it seems to me the our friend on his. appointment to a seat in the Legislative Council accepted it as he would accept a brief from his country marked with no fear (Cheers) He felt when he a cepted that appointment that the duty was incumbent upon him, and he had performed that duty in the manner with which you are to come and (Hear, hear ) He is a man îmrSciscd in busm sa who, one would have thought, had not a moment to spare for too Logisl the Council who had every excuse perb idea, for a neglect of the duty which he had undertaken (Hear, hear ) Yet he has never ceased, whenever he has had the opportunity, to attend the meetings of that b do and he has never ceased to give his utmost attention to the business of the House (Hear, hear.) He has on all occasions paid the utmost attention to the minutest details of the business He has shown an example to all those who have accepted similar appointments and I hope, with our friend the chairman of to- night that all of us who are here present will follow his example according to our respective abilities in trying to do our duty to that to which we owe our duly (Hear, hear.) I have said that I think the principal, the grand at, characteristic of Mr Darley's career in the Legislative Council has been its extraordinary usefulness (Hear, hear.) He has shown that there was no other motive that could possibly actuate him, and in the performance of his duty he has not attempted to make any display (Hear hear) He has laboured constantly to help us in doing what was light (Hear, hear.) He has put himself on the loved of the me most amongst us (Hear hear ) He has never refused to accept a suggestion from another member of the Legislative Council, and he has always given it its due weight (Hear, hear ) He has never shown that he came there to aggrandise him self-help, hear), he has been satisfied with feeling that he has done his duty in the position in which he was placed (Hear hear) I agree with the is much that it will be much more pie is it for us to welcome our friend Mr. Dalley on his retarn-(cheeri) - because he has taught us to believe that we have a claim upon him, and we consider him one of ourselves (Hear, hear ) His face as I say, was in ill i d M nothing, but I am sure that he will accept it as being fully paid in the generous appreciation of the ant Dig at public of this colony, and in the roragmtnn of his services by his fellow members of the Legislative C íuti.il, is testified by us here to night (Hear, hear) I have obtained leave from our cb limit to pi pose before 1 hit down another toast It is the toast of another member of ur House who has left us and Stonham I am shown shall all be glad of an opportunity of testifying our respect and esteem lb j toast is the health of the hon. member Mr John B Watt (cheers) who in his own way his also shown that no is in a position to be of service to the country, and I am sum it would have been a pleasure to all of us to have had 'Vii Watt are to night (Hear, hear I am sure it will be acknowledged that he is in his own place a representative man He has been amongst us since he was a boy He has been engaged in all our affairs He has been a leader Of the great commercial interests of this colony, and he his shown, whenever his health of the multiplicity of his enaoLoments allowed him to be with us, num- tense interest in the welfare of the country, which is his adopted country (Hear, hear.) I hope we shall soon see him back again to take his price amongst us as he has done before (hear, hear) that we shall see him return with better health and with more leisure in order that he may be enabled to take that place in the councils of the country which, I am sure you will eli acknowledge be 13 we is fitted to occupy (H ni hear) Gentlemen I think that tli06etwo men- tb»guostof tbocvouing,Mr Darley and he who unfortunately cannot be amongst us to-night, Mr John Watt, are men of whom we In the Legislative Council may very well be proud thear, hear-and of whom the colony may be proud (Hear, hear) B of ore, however, proposing Mr Watt's health to you I will conclude with one infliction, and that 19 we should be careful that in political matters we do not dogmatise too much But I confess I have thought that it might not be alto gether inconsistent with the position of the Legislative Council that a seat in that body should have attached to it come conditions, and that one of those might be that 0 gentleman desiring to obtain a seat in that council, should previously have obtained a seat in the Legislative Assembly (Mr Piddington Hear, hear ) When, however I consider that the two men to whom I point are representatives of what the members of this country ought to be, and have never been in the Legislative Assembly, and that it might be inconsistent with their pursuits and avocation that they should seek for election in that Assembly, I confess with humility that I have been in error (Hear, hear ) I confess that it is better that the Government should be left to the full responsibility of making appointments to the Council, and should exercise their own judgment as to who are best fitted for that appointment to strengthen the councils of the country. (Hear, hear ) I beg to propose the health of our fellow member who his so lately left us, my old and valued friend Mr John B Watt (Cheers.) The toast was duly honoured Mr A CAitrnrLL proposed "The Press is so referred to the arduous labours of the gentlemen connected with the press, and especially those whose duty It was to report what was said in Parliament The toast was responded to Sir Alfred Stephen proposed " The health of the Chairman (Cheers ) Mr Dalley returned thanks, and the proceedings then terminated Apologies for non attendance were received, from the Hon T Cadell and J Smith, of Molong, and it was understood that many other members of the Council would have been present had they not unavoidably been prevented from attending
