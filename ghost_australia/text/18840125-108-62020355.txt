PORT!FOLIO. Her foundation is in the holy moun tains. The Lord loveth the gates of Zion. Wherefore hath the city twelve founda tions, and in them the names of the Apostles and Prophets of the Lamb ? Be cause their authority is the foundation whereon our weakness resteth. Where rore are they the gates ? Because through them we enter in into the kingdom of God; since they have preached the same unto us, and when we enter in through their preaching, we enter in by Jesus Christ, who is Himself the door. And whereas it is written that the city hath twelve gates, and again that Christ is the one door; Christ is all the twelve, for He \- is in all the twelve. There lieth a great mystery in the signification of this number twelve. "Ye shall sit," saith the Lord, " Upon twelve thrones judging the twelve tribes of IsraeL" Let us see what is the meaning of these twelve thrones. By them is signified in a mystery the whole world. There shall be twelve thrones, because from all quarters shall there come men to be judged ; even as it is said that the city hath trwAve gates, because that from all quarters shall the nations of them that are saved enter into it. Lo not the iwelve only and the Apostle Paul, but all, as many as shall judge, have part in these tivelve thrones, this signifying that they shall judge all men even as all that enter into the city have part in her twelve gates. From the four winds shall the elect be gathered together. And how are they called I Everywhere are they called in the Trinity; for they are called no otherwise than by baptising them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost. Now four being multiplied by three, is twelve.-St Augustine, Bishop of Hippo.
