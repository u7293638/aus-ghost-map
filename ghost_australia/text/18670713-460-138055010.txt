ECHOES, FROM ENGLAND. (jBOH OUB fiPOBXlSa OOBBESrONDBNX.) LONDON, May 28. A tometrjb&t; fitful spring has replaced the bitter winter. A fortnight or so ago we had a week of July weather j so oppressive and hot was it that summer clothing became aneceeaity, and white hats made their premature appear ance. After the vet we had had everything began to grow vigorously, and the crops looked very well and healthy ; but this did not last, for a cold north-easter set in, and great : coats and fires became desirable, and, on two ! nights we had. sharp frosts—and a sharp frost in the middle of May is not very common. •On the Derby day we had a eharp snowatorm; land for the loBt threenjghts the frost has been jeo severe, that through ,a, wide extent of the . |country the potatoes rindother tender vege tables, asbeane, &c.;, haye been out .down to j the ground. However^ through fair. weather | or foul, racing has progressed pretty .success fully, and race meetings have been well at i tended. . One. of tbeg^eat meetings to be jnoted since my last hes.been Chester ; this jhas come' and gone- ,Thb.gathering is chiefly : noticeable for the Chester' Cup, race, on which |a good deal of speculation is always rife., The !
