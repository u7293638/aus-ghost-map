Feats in Eating. ' Pancakes, .which aro called crepes in the polished language of Voltaire, are not usually as productive of mischief as they were lately at Belleville. . A Belgian living n that locality made a bet with some of his fellow countrymen that he would swallow as many dishes of pan cakes as they would care to pay for. The bet was accepted; and an adjournment to an estab lishment noted for the superior quality of its orepes took place. There the Belgian sat down, and swallowed pancakes until he choked riimself, and was carried out of the creppire a corpse. A Russian prince, who made a wager to eat a luncheon for five, was luckier than t <e Belgian. The " portions " served were not of the flimsy kind usually given in French restaurants, but con sisted of large contributions of turbot, venison, fowl, game, cheese, sweets, and fruit ; the whole being liberally baptised with punch and cham pagne. The Prince " tucked everything away with the appetite of three single gentlemen rolled into one; and, instead of lying down to give up the ghost, like the pancake swallower of Belleville, he got up from th* table as liv-ly as a lark, and had a good walk. There is a fat boy at Montmartre who is reputed to be one of the most vigorous fork handlers in Paris, But he would have to riso very early in order to cultivate an appetite equal to that of the Muscovite magnate, the frame of whose coup de fourchette is assidu ously heralded about the Paris boulevards.
