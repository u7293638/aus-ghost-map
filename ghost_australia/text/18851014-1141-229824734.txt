VICTORIA AMATEUR TURF CLUB RACES. FIRST (GUINEAS! DAT. Tint Spring Meeting of the Viotoria Amateur Turf Glut was commenced on Saturday, under unfavourable oiroumstancee. The weather, whiah during the early part of the week wis fine, ohanged on Saturday, and visitors hardly got oat to toe coarse before the rain poured down, and made things very uncomfortable. Notwithstand ing tbe threatening state of the weather in the forsnoon, a larger camber of persons than In past years visited the course, 3814 going out by raiL Prepara tions were made by the Railway depart ment for a much larger traffic, tbe nsnal time-table on the Hawthorn and Brighton lines having been suspended, and fewer traios ran than usual. Mr. T. Watson wielded the flag In the absence of bis father. The jockeys gave him some trouble, tbe re sult being that all of them io the Foal Stakes were fined, and one of them, Williamson, tbe rider of Edith, was suspended for tbe rest of the mooting. The local blaoksmiths settlod the question as to whether they had the right of free entrance to the course whilst on business by going on strike. The result was, that owners of horses were put to a good deal of inconvenience. The men, however, argue that thej have as much right to free passes as jookejs and others. Sport began with the Maiden Plate, for which tbe excel lent field of nineteen started. Jocular, who is in Read's stable, was made a hot favourite, his starting price being 6 to 4. Lucky Hit and Highland Chief were the most inquired for amongst the remainder, and the winner was only supported by a few of the Ballarat people. The farourite occupied a good : position to the turn, where Recall made his effort, and soon settling the favourite, won easily by four lengths. The Hurdle Race attracted a field of a dozen, Duration and ; Master Pinetop dividing the betting honours at 4 to 1 each. Mistake was supported at 5 fo I, and ths followers of Corrigsn put , a little on his mount at a point more, the same price being had about Gasalier. Vemet and Vanderbilt made the running until the home turn, where Mistake had the lead. He, however, came down at the last hurdle, and Duration had an easy win from Problem, who was second. Batty, who rode Mistake, fell lightly, and was not in jured. Tbe Great Foal Stakes followed, and attracted a field of fourteen high-class youngsters. Acme, who looked very well, was installed first favourite at 6 to 4. The Nun and Maddelina had a good many friends at 4 to 1. A long delay took place before a start was effected, as most of the jockeys were very eager to get away well. At last Mr. Watson got them away, and tbe first to show in front were Munwyrtina, Clelia, Lottie, and Aoita. Hales soon came through on Acme, and sbe was the first into the straight. She looked an easy winner, but The Nun and Munwyrtina came with such a rush that Hales had to shake her op near home, aud be won by a half a length. The Nun and Hunwyrtioa made a dead- heat of it, the Booth Australian filly, Maddelina, being fourth. Eight started for the Guineas. Monte Cbrie-to was made the favourite, at 5 to 2, but Bingmaster was so freely snpported at half a point more that he started as good a favourite as anything, sod Dunlop bad friends at 5 to 1. Tbey were got away quickly, Lady Claudia and Bingmaster having the best of tbe start. Robertson, however, soon took Dunlop to the front, and he and Juanna mode the running. At the home turn Bing master and Monte Christo went up to the leader, bnt Mr, "White's horse soon bad enough of it. Bingmaster, on the other hand, speedily disposed of Dunlop, aod won by two lengths and a half. Fourteen started for the Aus tralian Hunters' Cap, and the South Aus tralian representative, Narrnng, who had the valuable assistance of Mr. W. Glass- oock, was so constantly supported that he soon saw 5 to 2. Tanglefoot, ridden by Mr. J. O. Inglis, had admirers at 4 to 1. Old Abdallah was backed at 6 to , 1\. Gippslander quickly went to the front, and eeon had a long lead, but he tired towards the finish, and Narruog, coming through, won by half-a-dozen lengths. The last event of the day was the Toorak Handi cap, for which nineteen started. Sirocco, with Craeknell up, was tbe favourite at 5 to 2, and Too Too was next in demand, at 4 to 1 ; whilst 8 and 10 to 1 could be bad about the winner. Dirk Hatteraick. made the run> ning to the turn, where Too Too and Sirocco passed him. Mentmore aod Too Too led into tbe straight, and, after a good race home, Mr. Whittingham's horse won by a head. Hughes, who rode Too Too, entered a protest agaicut Mentmore for crossing, but it was dismissed.
