Mrs. Saville bore the journey well—indeed, ? otter than her companion, whoso pale cheeks and heavy eyes bespoke mental and physi cal exhaustion. Mrs. Saville’s usual medical attend ant, or rather the medical .attendant of the household, for the wiry woman scarcely knew what indisposition meant, awaited her arrival and no ticed Miss Desmond's looks. “If .1 might offer advice unasked, I would recommend a tonic and some days* complete repose to 'this young lady," said the polite practitioner. “It seems to me that her nervous system is somewhat overstrained.” “She shall do as you direct," return ed Mrs. Saville. with her usual decis ion. “I will look to her myself. She has braved horrible infection for me, and has had a large share in saving my life; therefore I value hers beyond everyone’s except of course my sons* Yes, you look frightfully ill, Hope. I cannot have this.” “Perhaps if 1 went to Miss Ttawson for a few days,*’ said Hope, with hesi tation, “1 might gather strength soon er. Here I shall always want to be up and about.” “You shall be nursed in no other house than this; so, doctor, send In your prescription soon. As for me, I want nothing but good food and oc cupation.” “You are indeed marvellously well and strong, considering what an ill ness you have gone through. We have now every reason to hope that you will be spared to your family and friends for many years.” “Much my family and friends care about that special mercy,” returned Mrs. Saville, with one of her ironical smiles. “Good morning, doctor.” And the doctor bowed himself out. “Thank God, he is gone; I am dying to read my letters,” cried Mrs. Saville. “Here is a thick one from Mr. Raw son.” She opened it, and then, grow ing rather white, exclaimed, “Why, it encloses one from Thin read eagerly, and then reperused It. “Ah, if I could believe he cares for me.” she said, at length, “The letter is like himself, tender yet obstinate. He will be there nearly as soon as this.” she went on, her small, thin fingers closing tightly on the paper. “He implores, me to let him see his mother’s face once more—the mother he has been so near losing. Rawnon has evidently told him of my illness. He confesses I had a right to be angry; but reiLerates his conviction that he has done well and wisely in securing Hi.* sweetest wife man could have.” “You will see him, dear Mrs Sa ville ?” cried Mope, with white, parch ed lips. “You were ro good ns to think I was of use to you: if you would amp ly repay mo. see your son—let him plead for his wife. They arc married, you cannot separate them, and if she is a true woman it will break her heart to know that she has parted mother and son. It is in our power to confer such happiness.” “I will receive my son. As to his wife, I cannot say what I shall do. I gave Rawson directions to have her watched: it was a shabby tiling to do, but I did it. He has had her closely shadowed, but she has been absolutely well conducted. Still, if It is in my power to conf-r much happi ness it was in hers to create much misery, and she did it ! Why, Hope, what is the matter ? Are you ill V* Hope fell back in her chair so deadly white and motionless, that Mrs. Saville was terror-struck. She rang violently, and rushing to the fainting girl, began to rub her cold hands. “Bring water, wine ! send' .T-essop ! call back the doctor !*' she cried, in great agitation, to the astonished but ler, who had never before seen his im perious mistress so moved. , “The doctor has just driven off, ’m; but I will send Jessop.’ Soon the lady’s-maid, the butler, and the housekeeper were trying to bring “call back the doctor!” Miss Desmond back to life. "When she dill open her eyes they sought Mrs. Seville's; she smiled and feeby put out her hand. • "Now. she must go to bed,” said Mrs. S:-ville, holding the offered hand In both of her own. "She had better be carried up-stairs.” "1 can walk quite well; at least In a few minutes,” she murmured Hope, ••jessop will help me.” Thus Hope was relegated to her own room, where Mrs. Saville insisted she must’ remain all the next day. Won derful to relate, that lady spent most of it at her bedside, reading or knit ting. Neither spoke much, yet they had acertain comfort In the companion ship.

It was then established that Miss I Desmond was not to appear till lunch eon time, Mrs. Saville being content to n ad the papers herself- The doc- > tor was not ciuito satisfied; his young patient did not recover strength or j tone; she was depressed and nervous, ; averse from food, sleepless.

Yes, she must get Hopt out of town. How desolate her life Hnuld be without that girl ! and she would need comfort nml support in coming years. Even if she brought heiself to accept Hugh’s wife, she would probably turn out a thorn in their side and keep her and her son Here the old butler, with a beaming face, announced, “Mr. Hugh, ma’am," and her son entered. How well, how distinguished, he looked ! his strong face deeply embrowned, his fine eyes looking eager yet soft. "Hugh !" cried Mrs,* Saville, rising, arid trembling from head to foot. "My dear mother I" lie returned, ten derly, with a slight hoarseness of warm emotion, and he clasped her in his arms, kissing her affectionately. "Are you indeed safe and well ?" "My son ! you have nearly broken my heart !" Her tones told him he was already half forgiven. “Rawson told me this morning, just now, that I might venture to call. \rou must forgive me. mother.

"J think they will melt when you see her. mother." “T doubt H," Mrs. Saville was begin ning. when the door opened, and Hope Desmond walked slowly into the room. She seemed vory pale and fragile In her simple black dress. No sooner had she caught sight of Hugh than her cheeks flushed, her great brown eyes lit up with a look half joy, half terror, and her lips parted with a slight cry. Hugh Saville sprang forward, ex claiming, “M-y own love ! my own dar ling wife!" and folded her in a raptur HER UPS PARTED WITH A SLIGHT CRY. oils embrace, kissing her hair, her eyes, her lips, forgetful of everything else. Mrs. Saville again rose from her chair, and stood petrilied. At last Hope disentangled herself from her husband's arms, and, crossing to where her mother-in-law stood, said, brokenly, “Can you forgive me for the deceit 1 have practiced ? Can you have patience to hear my explana tion ?” "I am bewildered,” cried Mrs. Saville, looking from one to another. “Is Hope Desmond your wife. Hugh ?” “She is 1 Can you not forgive me now ?” said Hugh advancing to sup port Hope’s trembling form by pass ing his arm around her. “It is incredible ! How did you come to impose upon me in this way ?" “I will tell you all," Hope began, when she was interrupted by a mess age which the butler brought from Mr. Rarvson requesting to be admitted. “Show him up; he is a party to the fraud,” said Mrs. Saville, sternly. Hugh drew his wife closer to him as Mr. Rawson entered' looking, radiant. .. ”1 trust you do not consider me an intruder,” he said. "You come just when you are want ed. I feel my brain turning,” returned Mrs. Saville. “If you will listen." urged Hope with clasped hands. "Yes, pray hear Mrs. Hugh Saville,” said Mr. Rawson. Mrs. Saville turned a startled look upon him, and Hope went on : “When I came to this good friend, who of fered me the shelter of Ills house so scor. as he found I was the niece of his old rector, I was in despair. I began to realize the mistake, the dis obedience, that Hugh had been guilty of. I had yielded too readily to the temptation of spending my life with him. I felt that I was the cause of his troubles, and I was overwhelmed. I wished that I could die; anything to be' no longer a burden and an ob stacle. Then I heard Mr. Rawson speak of finding a companion for Mrs. Srvllle, and the thought came to me of being that companion, and perhaps winning her affection for myself and restoration for Huba.'' A sudden sob Interrupted her; then, with an effort, she went on : "Mr. Rawson was start led at the idea, but his daughter at o; ce took it up, and, after some dis cussion, It was agreed that I should make the desperate attempt. I was therefore Introduced to you by two of my names—Hope Desmond; I was call ed Katherine Hope Desmond after my mother, who was Uncle Desmond’s only sister. How I had courage to brave such an experience I cannot now understand, for my heart,"—she press ed her hands against her bosom, and disengaging herself, made a step near er her mother-in-law—“seems to flut ter and fail me. But the desire to re trieve the wrong- I had wrought sus tained me. I did not tell Hugh what I had undertaken until I had been some weeks with you. He was much alarmed, and begged me not to risk too mueh—to leave as soon as I could if the strain was too great; but he did not forbid me to stay. So I staved. Hnw dreadful the beginning was 1 "Vet. though you were cold and stern. 1 could bear it. for you are too strong to be suspicious, or pettj, or narrow, and I dared not let myself fear you; and then—I grew to know you had a la-art. That is what makes this moment so terrible. I fear your dis approval more than your displeasure Now. can you. will you forgive me ?” Mrs. Saville was silent: her brows wore knit, her eyes downcast; yet • Mope-dared to take the small handwhlch j lay nil the arm of tii-a chair Mrs. Sa- ! vilie did not draw it away. The lot It ers held their breath. Then she drew Hope’s to her and gently stroked it, “I think.” she said, slowly." that you arc the only creature that ever under stood me. I forgive your husband, and accept you—not because .his dlsobodi .ei:co is pardonable, but because, when I came back from the jaws of death, the flrst sight that met my eyes were your tears of joy at my recovery. Vet. bad I died intestate, you and your hus band would have been far better off than you will be; and you knew it.* You are the first that has ever given mt what gold cannot buy.” “Mother,” cried Hugh Saville, in a tone of wounded feeling, “I always loved you as much ae you woiild let “Perhaps you did. I believe you did.” said his mother. Hope had sunk on her knees and kissed the hands which held hers, then her head fell forward, and Hugh sprang forward to lift her. "She is Quite ovoroden,” he exclaim ed, almost indignantly. "She is but a ghost of her former seif.” And he placed her in an easy chair, where she lay with closed eyes. “Happiness will be a rapid restora tive.” said Mrs. Saville kindly. “Now, what punnshinent is to be dealt out to yen, traitor that you are ?” She con tinued, turning to Mr. Rawson. I de grade you from the high office of my chief adviser ? I must hold a council, and tlie council-board shall be my d:nner-(able. Bring your daughter to dinner this evening, and we shall settle ninny matters ? And Hope, if you feel equal to tlie task, write to Richard, inviting him to dinner to meet his new sister-in-law.” “Very few fellows have so good a right to be proud of a wife, as I have,” i cried Hugh, exultingly. “Our old naval j sti,ries of desperate cutting-out exploits are poor compared to the enduring ! courage that upheld Kate, as I a!- j ways call her, though the long strain of her bold undertaking.” “.She has enlightened me. at all events,” said Mrs. Saville. “Now go away to the drawing-room and have your talk out. The doctor insists that a complete change is necessary for Hope's, recovery; so take your wife away to-morrow for your long-delay ed honey-moon. But. remember, when ever you arc pursung your profession on the high seas, I claim the companion “Dear Mrs. Saville, I will be your loving daughter so long as you care to have me near you,” cried Hope : and, no longer hesitating, she folded her formidable mother-in-law in her warm embrace.
