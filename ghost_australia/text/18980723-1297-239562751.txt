MORUYA. Mr. Millard's chances for Moruya aro of the rosiest. He stands in tho enviable position of having against him two candidates who aro fighting tooth and nail for tho same vote. To one who travelled through the electorate re cently. when tho Premier spoke at different centres on behalf of the Liberal freetrade candi date, it was pretty evident that it would take ' a strong man to wipe out Air. Millard. For- 1 tunalely for him this strong man has not put 1 in an appearance. The local protectionists rather resent the interference of Mr. Austin Chapman, who has gone very near to foisting his brother nn fiw confctltiiencv. and Ibev have nut un Air. J. T. Brogan against him. Neither Air. A. E. Chapman nor Air. Brogan would have a chance separately, and they have not the ghost of one as they stand. Air. MUlard should score a very large majority.
