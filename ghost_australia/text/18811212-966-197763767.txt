VICTOBIA-S QUARE. TO THB EDITOR. Sir—In the concluding paragraph of letter in Register December 10, "Mr. B. G. Thomas" says:—"As to the 'mysterious disappearance' of Colonel Light's plan of the city, there waa nothing mjeteriouB in it at all. The plan, along with other valuable documents, was burnt in tbe fire which destroyed Colonel Light's residence on the Park Lands, but it was in existence so late as 1839." In reply, I beg respectfully to refer to records in tne Register, as well as in tbe land Office, showing that Colonel Light's residence on the Park Lands was destroyed by fire in 1838, several months after he bad resigned. Therefore, according to Mr. Thcmas's evidence, as "the plan was in ex'stence so late as 1839," we may yet, metaphorically, if not altogether reasonably, indulge the hope this it (or tbe ghost of it) will make its reappearance, to the no small delight of all our worthy fellow-citizens. I am, Sir, &c.;, R. G. SYMOND3. - P.S.—The squares were planned and pegged out according to the instructions given to Colonel Light by the Soath Australian Commissioners in March, 1836.
