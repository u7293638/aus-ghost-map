;iO :.-..!:>:R0MAN-RELICS. -.A-.r.M The seventh article of the Creed of' the Pope P,ius..IV.,. states that -the . relics of, . saints are., to bp; held...in veneration and we .find ,in,. the Yaifsi'of'Nov. 15, 1884, theTlull of Leo'-XIli., confirming the. sentence .pronounced by the Oardinal. Archbishop of Compostella, relative tb'sthe identity of the body of the Apostle James the 'Groat and two of his disciples. A goodly revenue flows into the ootlers of Romish Priests through a shamelese tratlio in " dead men's bones," and so the Pope proceeds to aver that " the bodies of the saints are so many fountains in the Church, whence flow over Christendom, like streams of life, the heavenly gifts, the beneflts, and all the graces of which we most stand in needi"— a most horrid blasphemy, and a denial of tbe work of the Spirit, whioh alone produces life, and every heavenly grace. The Homilies of the Church of England state that— " The relics we must kiss and offer unto, especially on relio-Sunday. And while wo offer (that we should not be weary, or repent us of our cost), the music and uiiiistndsy goeth merrily all the offertory-tiine, with praising and calling upon those saints whose relics be then in presence. Yea, and the water also, wherein those relics have been dipped, must with great reverence be reserved, as very holy and effectual. Is this agreeable lo St. Ohrysos- torn, who writeth thus of relics? 'Do not regard the ashes of the saints' bodies, lor the relics Of their flesh and bonei<, consumed with tim'e ; : hilt open the eyes of thy faith, and behold thpm clothed with heavenly virtue and the grace of the Holy Ghost, and shining with the bright ness of the heavenly light.' (Uomilia de s'epteiu Maphabmis.) But our idolators found too much iiva'ntage! of rrlicp and relic- jwafpr 4,(? follow j' S.f. ' ! Chrysoatom's counsel. And- bepanse 'relics, were so gainful, few places there were but had relics provided for them." And for inore plenty of relics, some one eaint had many heads,; one in one place, and another in another place. Some bad sis arms and twenty-six fingers. And whore our Lord boro bis cross alono, if. all the pieces of the relics thereof were gathered together, the greatest ship in Engiand would scarcely bear them ; and jet the greatest part of it, they say, doth yet remain in the bonds of the Infidelsi for the which they pray on their beads bidding, that they may get it also in their hands for anch godly use and purpose. And not only the bones of saints, but everything ap pertaining to them was an holy relic. In some plaoes they offer a sword, in eomo the scabbard, in some a shoe, in some a saddle that bath been set upon some holy horse, in some tbe coals wherewith St. Laurence was roasted, in some places the tail of the ass which our Lord Jesus Christ sat on, to be kissed and offered unto for a relio. For rather than they would lack a relio, they would offer you a horsc-bono instead of a virgin's arm, or the tail of the ass to be kissed and offered unto for reiics. O wicked, impudent, ! most shameless men, tbe devisers of these things 1 0 silly, foolish and dastardly daws, and more beastly than tbe ass whose tail they kissed, that believe snob things." Dr. Andrew Willet says — " Most of their relics were forged and devised. Sti Peter's brain at Geneva was' found to be a pumice-stone; St. Anthony's arm was found to., be . . . at Tours of late the image of Venus'' in an agate was worshipped for an image of the Virgin Mary ; the blood of Hales in Engiand was described to be the blood of a drake ; ., the three: hosts of Calais were but three white counters , soldered into a marbled stone." . Bishop Burnet says — ,j , : , "Another way was thonght on, whioh, . indeed, proved more effectual, both for reoovoring.thp, ; people out of the superstiluous fondness .they ;haid for their images and relics, and for'.dis \- covering the secret impostures that had long been praotised in these houses. And this way : was to order the visitors to examiue well all the relics and feigned images to which pilgrimages were wont to be made. In this Dr..Lnndjon,.,did "great sbrvice.
