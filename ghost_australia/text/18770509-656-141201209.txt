ORIGINAL POETRY. DON'T GO IN. Inside, it's a house nicely furnished, Outside, too, it Iooks very well; Bright lights and fine silver well burnished, Are found at this tempting hotel. It retails, as its license empowers, Rum, brandy, wine, whisky, and gin; But when Fate grants a few leisure hours, My son—oh, my son—DON'T GO IN! Although the "correct thing" 'tis reckoned, To swallow a "nip" at odd times, One nobbler soon leads to a second, And culminates often in crimes. Men are led just like Iambs to the slaughter, And he's not worth the ghost of a pin Who can't live without brandy and water, My son—oh, my son—DON'T GO IN! To get on the spree—drink and revel, You'Il find is a non-paying game, Which will drive you headlong to the d---I, Dishonored, and covered with shame! As loafer or felon the ending Of most is, who practise this sin; Such facts are most truly heartrending— My son—oh, my son—DON'T GO IN! (Encore verse by the landlord.) Yes! of course if you don't wish to enter, Your presence I cannot compel; But without you I think I may ventur', To say I shall do very well. Others will, if you won't, my dear fellow! But mind, if you should venture in, Disposed to be hearty and mellow, My son—oh, my son—BRING THE TIN! J. P.
