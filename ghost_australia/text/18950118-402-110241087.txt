SUBMARINE GHOSTS. A diver who went down to work on the steamship Viscaya, which was in collision and sunk off Barnegat Light, had a grue- some experience. It was a difficult job, so two divers were sent down —one of them to remain on deck in sixty feet of water to act as second tender to the other diver who went below. The latter had been below but a few minutes when three jerks came over the life line. When he had been hauled up on to the deck he was so unnerved that he forgot he was still in sixty feet of water, and signaled to have his helmet removed. When both divers had been hauled to the surface, he said that while he was working through a gangway he had seen two huge objects coming towards him ; and nothing could dissuade him from the belief that he had seen two submarine ghosts—until the other diver went down and discovered that there was a mirror at the end of the gangway, and that the diver had seen the reflection of his own legs, vastly enlarged, coming toward him.
