THE BISHOP OF MELBOURNE ON ??HEAVEN. iNthocoúrso ot a sermon prcnohod on Sunday Inst by Dr Moorhouse, that distinguished prolnto is re-, ported by tho Ari/im to linvo suki: "Thoro veera' many really lenrncd mon in tho present liny who knew about tho Word ot God littlo inoro than 'super-! ' stitious old wives did ol' ínblos lind necotiuts willoh they lind heard in tho nursery, lío said this out ot' charity to thom, bcouuso if it wero not so it would bo totally impossible to cxnlnin tho rklionlons mis- takes into which thoy were ooiitlimnlly fulling. Tn ; tho ditys whon theso lenrnotl mon wore young: th j ordinary Christian would tell them i": t tôe O «¡pei carno to touch thom tho way to heaven, n,:d ii! qu.s tion'od further ho would probably suy that tho end of his labour, ami tho object of his hopes boyond this '?'. world, wns tho getting to 'heaven. No wonder that'" that was regarded as a menu und contemptible Chris- tianity-' mi other worldliness.' Thnt, howevor, wns not Now Testament teaching. Tho Kingdom of God was not meat and drink, but righteousness nnd pence and Joy in tho Holy Ghost. Tho Kingdom of God within a man consisted in tho regulntion of his fe .' inga, Impulses, thoughts, words, and deeds, so tim t his lifo was animated und inspired by love to Got! mid man. Heaven was not n placo morely ; it was thn state of tho soul towards God ; nnd if n mnn tried to (fain lt as a reward, nnd morely from.selfish motives, thnt net shut it out from him, for that belonged to tho opposite of tho Kingdom of God-not to henvon but to hell."
