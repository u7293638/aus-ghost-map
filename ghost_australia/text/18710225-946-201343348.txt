The eve of the wedding day, which , was to be the beginning of such a happy ; life, came round with flowers and sun- \ shine as though all the world rejoiced : with the young people in their blissful prospects. ? ... They were to be married in the little chapel where the'O'Grady's worshipped for many generations, 'and by a succes sor, of the worthy old priest; 'who had known Lord' Scatterbfahr.in his un ?gaiiily youth;' and the brothers in their ?neglected an'd' untrained' boyhood. ;: For.: miles around the peopled Tied with, each other in striving to do 'honor to the son of their old squire, arid his lovely bride. ??. -; , .

'all the.pbmp in .the ;world, and her bridesmaids should beherlfriends and none-iother. 'j ?So if there was 'riotit'obe'tuniformity' in the. bridal train, there would be hearty love at least, and the bride elect was content and happy. Horace felt as he sauntered home after a last visit to Honor, that no man could be more blessed than he ; every thing seemed to be working well with him now, and to promise brightly for the future. He could pass the heap of ruins that was once Mickey Keane's cottage now without regret, the poor old fellow was comfortably cared for; if his mind was blank he lacked no comfort that money could procure him. ?'''' He remembered nothing now, except his constantly reiterated assertion that Nora was alive, which of course was a delusion, poor fellow. Ratty thought of the past as he came to the spot where the cottage had stood, and congratulated himself on having found his father- in-law. ' Poor fellow,' he said to himself, 'it has' been an awful business, and somehow I don't think the end of it has come. Nora, my Nora, if you can see me now, you know I have not forgotten yon.' He started back with a slight cry, for as he uttered the words, a- woman rose silently from behind the walls and stood before him. Slight and graceful and with rippling black hair, though clad in tattered finery and brown with exposure and dirt ; the illusion was so great that his excited imagination made him believe he beheld the spirit of his dead wife. ' Nora,' he exclaimed, putting up his hands and retreating. ' No, sir, that's not my name,1' said the woman, looking at him with sur prise, ' I only thought — that is, - would you give a poor woman a trifle to help ner on her way, it's long since I tasted food.' There was something superior to an ordinary beggar about the woman, there was a grace in her manner, and a re finement in her tones which were cer tainly not born of beggary and starva tion. Her dress savored somewhat of the stage, bits of tinsel and finery mingled with the more ordinary costume of daily life ; it was worn and shabby to the last degree but caretully mended and clean. ^ - As Horace looked at her the illusion vanished ; about Nora's height she certainly was, and black hair, but there the resemblance ceased ; she had neither the voice nor the face of the ' sweet girl whose homejiad once, been the heap of ruins at their feet. ? . He put his hand into his pocket and drew out 'some money ? the woman did not seem like an' ordinary beggar and he hardly knew, how to relieve her. ' You are not Irish by your, tongue,' he said. ' , , ' ' ' No sir ; we. have come a long way, me and my boy, and we're' going farther yet.'I: never 'begged .before, ; but -1' ye Deen unfortunate on the road and my money's ,a]l gone, that's all sir.' . .There was truth in every accent and he, put the money into her hand bidding her .to go up to. the house and get a meal. ,' . ' He was turning away when a childish hand seized him by the coat, and a little lisping yoice accosted him as 'dada.' ', Ho had; not noticed the child which clung to the woman's skirts, shyly hiding its face, but now he looked down only to start back with a feeling akin to 'terror; for the little swarthy face which looked up io his seemed like a reflection of his own, and the eyes which scanned him so anxiously, were Nora's eyes. The voice, too, infantile though it was, sounded like Nora, and ho passed his hands orer his eyes in bewilderment. ' Am I mad or dreaming ?' he asked himself, ' that the spirits of the past seenito rise from :their graves and haunt ? me. ' -Is that your child woman ?' ??'?'''Yes, it is my child,' she- answered, ''and 'then as she looked up into his face ran idea 'seemed to strike her, she said ?passionately^ 'Heavens ! what is this ?' . The- likeness was indeed strange be ?tween the handsome swarthy man who ; stood 'beside her and the bright-faced little boy, who, frightened by her vehe ?'mence, began to whimper,' and her dark cheeks turned as pale as their bronze would let them, as she looked from one to the other. ' . ? '-Is'-he your child ?' Horace repeated sharply; ' Where did he come from ?' ' It is mine !' the woman repeated. :'Why do you ask? What is it to you '?' ' ' ,: . '?. ' ';Nothing, '?? nothing — forgive me; a strange likeness, that is all. , Tell.me where you came from, and who you are.' ' My name is Maurice,' the woman replied, 'Annette Maurice; my hus band is a strolling mountebank, though he wasn't always that. As to where I came from, I might say from all over the world and not be far wrong. Ame rica was the last place ; we sailed from New York six weeks since.' 'And the child with you ?' 'Surely, sir,' she answered in. sur-. prise. ' Where should he be but with his mother ?' ' ' And where are you going ?' ' To London, sir — my husband is there, making a poor living enough, but we can't bear to be parted.. If I could get to Dublin I've friends there that would help me a bit.' ' I will see you get there ; follow me up to the house yonder, you shall have rest and food, at least, and one of the servants shall see you into the train.' ' You are very good, sir j I thank you humbly.' She curtseyed low, and stood watch ing him till he was out of sight. Then she clutched the boy convulsively to her bosom and turned away. 'No, no,' she exclaimed, 'riot there; far, far away, my bonny boy. Out of sight and hearing. What is it ? Where does this fearful, likeness come from. My child ! Yes all mine ! Saved from death, and saved too by me — tak- ing the place of— ah, come, my boy, COme — he was good and kind, and the money he gave us will take us to Dub lin may be, but we must not go to his house, no, no.' Talking thus incoherently, she moved off in the direction of the station, with the boy weary and quiet now on her arm. She was seen by one of the servants from the Dingles, who happened to be passing, and who was able to report the fact when Horace O'Grady asked for the woman he had bidden to follow him. ' She was walking along the wood, and talking like a crazy woman,' the man declared, and no more was heard about her. ? The next morning, the day of days in pretty Honor's life, dawned bright and glowing over all the land, and all were early. astir. ? The little church was crowded to see the young people who had grown upon the land made one, in the sight of heaven, and many a heart flew back to the distant time gone by, when Squiro O'Grady was the dread of the country side, and the cheery, fatherly man, who stood there to give his child away, wi6h a blessing and a kiss, was his untutored servant lad. Many a 'God bless theni.' was spoken that day, for his lordship and Mr O'Connor, a gray-haired man,' now but the'mover of all 'the good works the country . had seen for years, who with his!handsoriie, matronly wife, who still bad Fanny Dawson's beaming face, stood there to grace the ceremony. And the day passed, and the break fast was over, and friends crowded round the bride and bridegroom, and took leave,, and the young people started on the great journey of life, alone, to gether. ; And while all this was going on at Lord Scatterbrain's house, Annette Maurice was sped away on her journey Eng landward. . ; She had told the truth about herself, she had friends in Dublin, who helped her with her passage and faro to Lon don ; and she was the wife of a strolling mountebank. That assertion was only true to ti cer tain extent ; James Maurice had only been a stroller, since evil fortune had landed him penniless in Ireland. He had lost clothes, properties, every thing lie possessed, by the foundering of a boat, which was bringing his goods ashore, and after a week or two's vaga bondizing had managed to get a situa tion in London. With only money enough to cross the water, he made his way to it, leaving his wife to follow ; she was no nervous, feeble woman, frightened at her own shadow, and she pushed boldly on till within a short distance of Dublin, her money being exhausted, she begged as we have seen of Horace O;Grady. Her friends in Dublin were old em ployers of her husband's to whom he had written in her behalf, and through them she got a free passage to Holyhead, and nearly enough money, to take her to London. ? How she managed her journey matters ?little to our story,' she did manage it, and four days after her interview with Horace O'Grady, she stood weary and worn, but happy and hopeful at the stage-door of one of the east-end theatres. ' Well !' interrogated a dirty book keeper, as she showed herself, ' what is it?' ' Mr Maurice's address, if you please.' ' Mr Maurice, who's he ?' ' The ballet director, the new gentle man.' ' Oh, him.' The tone was contemptuous in the extreme, as was the look that accom panied it. ' What's he to you ?' ' I am his wife, where does he live, that is supposing I can't see him ?' ' Oh, you can't see him now. Here, Williams, where does that new fellow live?' ' - ' Over at Mother Smith's, four-pair back, and be careful how you ring the bell, fear of taking off the polish of the handle,' retorted a dirty lad, who finished his speech with a whoop and went off to inform his fellow supers that ' Herr Maurice's wife was come and she looked like a bone dealer's rag doll just.' ? Meantime, Herr Maurice's wife had found out his poor lodging and esta blished herself therein. Very humble and mean they were but they were home; they were redolent of his presence, the only being on earth who loved or cared for her, and she wept for very joy that she had found a home at last. She un dressed the child and laid him on the humble bed, and then sat down to wait her husband's return. Despite his poverty-striken plight he was a very clever man this Herr Maurice, recently installed as ballet master in the Royal Octagon theatre, and once in London there was little fear of 'his getting on. His wife started up with a little scream of joyful surprise when she saw him come in ; he looked pale and careworn, but he was neatly attired in a whole suit of clothes. ' My darling ! my darling !' he ex claimed, catching her in his arms. ' What a joyful surprise ! I hardly looked for you for two days yet.' ' I got help beyond my expectations in Dublin,' she said, ' and somewhere else besides; I'll tell you all about it by-and-bye. How. smart you are, Jim.' ' Yes, dear, \ wasn't decent enough for the place till I got myself rigged out. We'll have these shaddy things off you to-morrow if I live.' ' Yes, the Herr's wife must not dis grace him,' she said with a sad smile. ' Yon don't say a word about the boy, dear.' ' Ah, the boy, how is he ! All right, I suppose ?','???.. ' How coldly you speak. All right ! Look at him, the darling. Isn't he lovely ?' ' ?? '...'?'. r'. '. 'Well, he is beautiful, and he'll be clever, too, which is more to the pur pose j I'm glad we've got him here safe.' 'I had a terrible fright in Ireland.' 'How?' ' Just before I got to Dublin I and my money were both exhausted and I begged — think of that, Jim, bogged from a gentleman I met in the road for help to get on.' ' My. poor child !' ' I looked in his face, dear, and I thought my heart would stop beating and I should die, for he was as like tho boy as one face can be like another, all but the eyes, they were hers, you know. He gave me money, and bid me go' to his house, but I didn't, I went on my way for fear.' ' What was his name ?' ' I heard it afterwards — Horace O'Grndy.' ' Heavens !' ' It was — was I not right to get away from that place ?' ' But there must have been a mistake, my darling, that man was drowned in the Erin.' ' No, dear, he is alive, and he was as much struck by the likeness as I was, and questioned me, asked me if the boy was mine ; only think, my own darling baby, but he learned nothing from me. Oh, Jim, I'm terribly afraid.' ' Afraid of what, dear ?' ' That our sin will find us out as the Bible says, that's all.' Chapter XI. GONE AGAIN. ' The best laid schemes of mice (iud mon Gnng oft aglee, :, ?.., And lenvp us nnught but grief and pain For promised joy.' — Bubnb. ' Ah, you think too much about it,' Maurice replied ; ' I don't think there was any sin in the matter ; he's a bonny boy, and he's better with us than in a New York workhouse, isn't he ?' ' I've fancied not a dozen times within the last few days,' she said, sadly. 'We're staivcd, Jim, the boy and I.' ' And it's made you weak and down hearted, my girl, you'll feel differently to-morrow, please Heaven, our hard life's over now.' ' I don't feel as if I could say please Heaven, to anything. I feel ? ' . ' Too tired for anything but supper and bed, I can see ; come along, darling, and try and eat, and I shall see a new* look on your pretty face before long.' He was right, rest and food were the main things she needed, and in halfan hour she was smiling and talking brightly of the future to her husband with the boy between them. Childlike, he had waked up to share the meal, a.nd was prattling Jalter nately to ' mamma' and ' dada,' and driving away the care, whatever it was, that was oppressing her, and forcing her to smile back at his baby fun. ? ' I'll make a star of him yet,'' said his father, pulling the sturdy little limbs now this way and now that, in a fashion to make a tender mother wince and shrink. - ' He has plenty of pluck, and he's strong and hearty too.1' ' I think he would make something better than a dancer or an acrobat, dear,' Annette said. 'Look at his intelligent face.'' ' He's none the worse for being handsome. Women like to look at a good-looking fellow in skin tights. I'll teach him my profession first, and let him learn what he likes after. I do believe you half despise me, Annette, because I can't patter like fine actors, but I'll tell you what it is, my girl, for one actor that gets a good living now a-days, there are a dozen gymnasts and acrobats who make fortunes. I'll stick to the tumbling, wife.'' For answer Annette put her arms round her husband's neck and gave him kiss after kiss, till the little one set up a jealous clamour of ' me, too, mamma,' and had to be caressed in his turn. ' Despise you, Jem!' she said, and her voice was full of wifely love and pride. ' Despise my own husband whose every core and thought is to make me happy ! Ah, don't talk like that, dear, you know it isn't true 3'' ' I know I'm only a rough chap, darling, only fit to tumble in public houses and pick up a living by the road side,.whilc you ? ' ' I'm only a poor showman's daughter, dear; that ever I had any education was chance work. I've never been better off or happier than since you made me your wife, and I never wish a better fate.' Perhaps in all London there was not a happier couple than Jem Maurice and his wife that night — happy in their altered fortunes and in their mutual love. No. matter that their home was humble and their supper frugal, they were to gether, with employment for the present, and youth, health, and hope for the future. The very next day the teaching of the little boy commenced, Le Petit Angelo his father dubbed him, and in a very few hours it was plain to be seen that, baby though he was, he had all the natural qualifications for the profession to which he was destined. He was strong, lithe, and fearless, and ere ninny days had passed, Jem would proudly boast that ' ho could do anything with that young 'un.' . And months passed on* and presently the tiny acrobat made a feature in the Christmas pantomime at the theatre, and crowds went nightly to see the fear less little fellow who, as a chubby .Cupid, came out of flowers and down moonbeams, and made havoc with the hearts of gauzey fairies. His earnings made no inconsiderable addition to the weekly income of the ballet master, who was rejoiced at the success of his teaching, and spared neither pains nor expense to keep the little one healthy and happy. Unlike most children who figure in theatrical spectacles, and become old and worn before their time with late hours and gaslight work, his hard life seemed to make no impression on him j he looked as hearty and as rosy as a country bred child. ??„'?: Offers for him began to pour in from provincial theatres, but James Maurice very wisely refused them all — ' Time enough yet,' he said, ' for all that ; Le Petit Angelo should make a London reputation before he went into tho coxmtry.' But alas for human speculation — the theatre shared the fate of many another during the winter season, and was burnt to the ground one night after tho per formance. The London theatres wore most of them closing at the time, and to take a country engagement was the only thing left to do. Mr and Mrs Maurice wore obliged to accept a very inferior one, but they were much better off than when they arrived in London and they did not grumble ; many of the company had no where to go and nothing to fall back upon, with the slack season before them. . The very night that the theatre was burnt, Lord Scatterbrain and Horace O'Grady safc in the boxes. Though an east end theatre the perfection with which the pantomime was produced attracted every one to see it, and the two had sauntered in to wile away an hour. 'When the pretty little child shot out from the middle of a large lily and stood poising his glided bow upon the brilliantly lighted stage, Lord Scatter brain started and exclaimed^ — ' Good heaven, Ratty, do you see that child ?' ' Yes,' Ratty replied, ' it's the child I saw the day before I was married, I am sure it is.'' ' Why he is your living image.' ' I know it, I see it, my lord, I must hear more about that boy. I am sure the story the woman told me is not true.' ' Why you don't imagine that ? ' ' I hardly know what I think, what I feel about it, but I must have that child's true history.' . ' I expect it is simple enough, my boy. Le petit what is it ? Oh, Angelo will turn out to be the son of the ex tremely common place looking gentle man who seems to be tho prime director of his actions. The likeness is extra ordinary, the brat has not only your face but your gestures, look there the very turn of your head all but the eyes.1' 'They are Nora's eyes,1' Horace murmured, but in too low a tone'1 to' ; reach his companion's ears, ' her loving ?wistful eyes ;' and a cold chill came over him as he thought what would ; be the consequence, if there had been any mistake in the terrible trngedy which; had so blighted his life. After the'per formance tho two gentlemen went round' to the stage door, only to. find thai ' Herr Maurice' and luff little lifoy ':! had! gone home. '?.'??;-.-; -'?..'?'.;.. ?
