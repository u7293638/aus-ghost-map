m ? pud?ter sT Return.', (Continued.) OIAI'TR it. Mr. Gibbon Maggleby had been married ratherflesthn two an-d'twcnbyhplon; when, at about nine o clock on the morning of March 23, 186S, he walked into the room in whichdhe hadlso'often breakfastedand dined with his late friend and partner, Solomon Pudater. Mr. Maggleby, who was preo eminently a man of business, bad not seen fit to go to the Isle of Wight or to aris to spend his honeymoon; and Mrs. Maggleby, who was nothing if not a woman of sound sense, had loyally accepted the decision of her third lord and master. They had agreed to stay in town, and not to allow their new happiness to interfere with their material in terests in Mincing Lane Mr. Maggleby had determined, however, to make a holiday of the day after his wedding; to stay at home in the morning, with his wife, -to escort her to Madame Tassand's in the afternoon, and to take her to the play in the evening. With this comfortable programme in his mind's eye, Mrr:Ma eby canime down to breakfast in his flowered dressing.gown. Mrs. laggleby, he knew," would not be many minutes behind him, and he therefore rang the bell for the coffee, and turned lazily towards the table, upon which lay two piles of letters. The smaller heap chiefly con sisted of missives addressed to Mrs. Pudster, for the marriage of the previous day had not as yet been noised abroad in the country, and Mrs. Maggleby had several female cor respondents who communicated with her much more often than she communicated with them. Thelarger bundle was made up of letters addressed either to Mr. Maggleby or to Messrs. Pndster and Maggleby, the letters to the firm having been already brought down from Mincing Lane by a con fidential clerk. It was a chilly morning; and Mr. Maggle by, with the letters in his hand, sank into an easy chair by the fireside, and then began to polish his spectacles. But ere he had time to complete that operation, one envelope attracted the attention of his not very dim. sighted eyes. It bore the post.mark ' Ply month,' and was addressed in a familiar hand-writing. Without waiting to put on his spectacles, Mr. Maggleby seized the en envelope and tore it open. For an instant he stared at the letter which it contained; then he turned white, and fell back with a groan. But Mr. Maggleby was a man of considerable self- command, and he soon partly recovered himself. "Maria must not see me in this agitated state," he murmured, as he rose. " I shall go back to my dressing- room, and decide upon some plan of action before I face her." And with unsteady steps, he quitted the room, taking with him the letter that was the cause of his emotion. Almost immediately afterwards, a servant entered with the coffee and some covered dishes, which she set upon the table; and no sooner had she withdrawn than Mrs. Maggleby appeared. Mrs. Maggleby looked blooming. and was evidently in capital spirits. She caught up her letters, sat down smiling in a very easy chair from which her husband had risen a few minutes, and began to read. The first letters to be opened were, of course, those which were addressed to her in her new name. They contained con gratulations upon her marriage. Then she attacked the envelopes that were addressed to Mrs. Pudster. One contained a bill; another contained a reqnest for Mrs. Pad. -,- a - eroC· .e - - n"ut-2-.? .." -.ith*-?-- yr '2I"i cayeTrai nity Pilots ; and a third brought a lithographed letter from the Marquis of Palmnyr, imploring the recipient to make some small subscription to the funds of the Association for the Encouragement of As paragus Culture in the Scilly Islands. There were also letters from Miss Martha Tigstake and Mrs. Benjamin Bowery. dealing with nothing in particular and everything in general; and finally there was a letter bear. ing the post mark "Plymouth." Mrs. Mag gleby opened it carelessly; but a single glance at its contents caused her to start up, grsap convulsively at the mantelpiece, utter an exclamation and tremble like a leaf. "Poor Gideon I" she said. '! What a fearful blow I He mnsn't see me in this agitated state. I shall go up-stairs again, and decide upon some plan of action before I'face him." And Mrs. Maggleby, letter in hand and pale as death, quitted the room, leaving the coffee and the eggs and bacon and the crumpeta to get cold. Three quarters of an hour later, Mr. Magglehy ventured down-stairs again. He was dressed as if to go to the City, and in his hand he held a letter which bore the simple address, "Maria." This letter he laid upon his wife's plate. It was worded as follows: . My dearest Life-I am suddenly and un expectedly summoned to Mincing Lane on business of the greatest importance. I do not know exactly when I shall return, but you most not be anxious.--Your devotedly, GIDEo\\. Mr. Maggleby hastily seized a tepid crumpet, and without the formality of seat ing himself at the table, devoured the clammy dainty. Then hearing his wife upon the stairs, he rushed like a madman from the room, and an instant afterwards left the house and quietly closed the front door behind him. Mrs. Maggleby, whose face bore traces of recent weeping, entered the 'dining-room as if she expected to find the place tenanted by a ghost. Discovering, however, that it was empty she resumed her seat by the fire, and, with an hysterical outburet, bried her head in her hands. "'Poor dear Gideon I" she sobbed.' "What will become of him and me? We shall be imprisoned for life; I know we shall. The house will have tobe shait np; the business will go to ruin; the servants will have to know all. Oh, it is too terriblel But I must compose myself. Gideon will be com ing down, and I must be prepared to break the news'to him;" and with gieat self-com mand, Mrs. Maggleby wiped her eyes and seated herself at the table. As she did so, she caught sight of her husband's note, which abshe eagerly opened. "He has gone I" she exclaimed despair. ingly, when she had read it. "I am left alone to bear the trial l--Ah, Gideon, yon little know how cruel you are. But I mnust follow yen. We moat concert measures at once. Once more she went up-stairs. .She put on her bonnet and cloak; abshe covred her flushed face with a thick veil; and without saying a word to any of her serv;ants, she left the house, and made the best of her way to the nearest cabstiand. Meantime, Mr. Maggleby had been driven to his place of business in Minciig Lane. He entered his office, and sat down as if dazed, in his private room. Hearing of his principal's unexpected arrival-thhe-head clerk.Mr.-Johu-Doddiard, almost imme. 'di-ily appeared. He too was scared and breathless. : "Read, sir, read !" he gasped as he thrust o n open letter Mr. Maggleby's hand. ""r. lMagglebymechancally took the letter, and read aloud as follows: On'Board S.S.

"I; knew it 1" ejcujated& Mr. isaggleby. 'I have just received the letter that he6 speaks of." "What does it all mean!" asked Mr. Doddard. " I seem to be dreaming, sir. We buried poor Mr. Pudster eight months ago, didn't we ?" "So I thought," murmured Mr.- Mag globy vaguely. "But this letter is certain ly in his handwriting. • And look at the postmark. There it is, as plain as pose sible: 'Plymouth, March 22, 186S.' That was yesterday ; and to-day is Wednesday, March 23rd.-Jast read my letter, Dod dard t" and he pulled from his pocket a missive, which he handed to his clerk. Mr. Doddard read as follows: " On board S.S. Camel, offPlymouth,Tues day. "?My dear Gideon,-Here l am almost at home again. Ifancy that you didn't expect to see me just at present; for I wasn't able to write to you before we left Demerara ; so, as we are now sending ashore here, I post you a few lines to prepare you, for the sur prise; It is, as you know, quite unusual for vessels of this line to call at Plymouth, and therefore I haven't time to send you a long letter; though, if we should call at South ampton, I will write again from there. I have told Doddard to send some one to meet me at Gravesend; let him take down any letters that you may want meto see at once. Yours affectionately, SoLoMoxN." " Vell, I never did I" cried Mr. Doddard. "Yet I could swear to Mr. Pudster's hand writing anywhere. It is a terrible thing for a man who ought to be lying quietly in his coffin to come back like this, and upset every one's calculations." " sou are certain about the handwriting ?" asked Mr. Maggleby anxiously. "Quite certain l" replied Mr. Doddard. "What a frightful thing for poor Mrs. Pud ster." " Mrs. Maggleby, you mean," said Mr. Maggleby. "Yes. I don't' know how to break it to her. It's a case of bigamy; isn't it?" "Let nus hope for the best, sir. Mr. Pudster won't prosecute, I fancy, consider ing the peculiar character of the circum stances. It's his fault. That's my opinion. I could swear, even now, that we buried him. He most have revived in his coffin, and been dug up again by the grave-diggers; and must then have gone over to Demerara, in order to avoid shocking his poor wife." "I wonder our Demerara agents didn't say something about it when they wrote by the last mail, 'said Mr. Maggleby, " Oh, of course he kept them quiet, sir. But it's a cruel case- that's all I have to say. And though I have known Mr. Pad ster these thirty years, and liked him too, I don't hesitate to say that he's not behaving straightforwardly in this piece of busi ness. "Hash I Wait until you know of his motives," said Mr. Maggleby. " lie can't excuse himself, sir, I tell you," rejoined Mr. Doddard warmly. " If he comes back, I go. So there I And I say it with all respect to you, sir. When a man's once dead, al's got no right to come back again. It ieu natural; and w? ' ý ' -' 'mn t0s elnection may be partly accounted for by consideration of the fact that Mr. Maggleby had a few days previously an nounced his intention of taking the head clerkinto partnership at an early date. lir. Padster's return would of course knock this project on the head. " Well, Doddard," said MIr. Magglehy, "we can't mend matters by talking. We can only wait; and, perhaps, when we see Mr. Pudster, we shall find that" But Mr. Maggleby's philosophical remarks were saddenly cut short by the unexpecteor arrival of Mrs. Maggleby upon the scene. Sherushed into the private room, stretched forth a letter, and fell sobbing'upon her husband's neck. Mr. Maggleby placed his wife in a chair, opened a cupboard, gave her a glass of wine, took the letter, and read it. Like the others. it was dated from on board the Camel, off Plymouth. " My own dearest Wife," it ran -"In a few hours from this I shall, I hope, be with you once more, never again to leave you. I ought to have already apprised you of the probable date of my return; but at the last moment before starting, I hadl no op. portunity of writing. How glad I shall be to see you I My long absence has been a great trial to me, and I feel sure that it has tried yon; but it is now alinost at an end. I will, if possible, write again from South ampton, and tell you exactly when to expect me. The sea in the Channel is so rough that at present it is difficult to say when we shall get into the river.-Your ever loving husband, So.oumOv." "It is most painful I" gasped Mrs. Mae gleby. " What can we do, Gideon ? You must manage to meet Solomon at Gravesend. Look in the newspaper, and see whether Camel has been signalled yet. He must hear first of!what has happened either fromi my lips or from yours; and I am really not well enough to go myself. I thought that he was lying cold in his coffin. Oh, that I should have committed bigamy I I ought to have remaingl faithful to his memory. This is my punishment. But he must-he shall forgive me.". Mr. Doddard had gone into the outer office, and had sent a clerk foracopy of the Ti'es. With this he now returned ; and the paper was opened on Mr. Maggleby's table, and eagerly scanned for news of the CameL " Here we have it I" said Mr. Doddard at last. "' Steamship Camel, from Demerara to London, with cargo and passengers, was signalled off Dover at one o'clock this morn. ing.'-Then Mr. Pudster will be at Graves in as hour or two, air." "Go, Gideon, go I" exclaimed Mrs. Mag. gleby. "Losee no time. Take a special train if necesan. Tell him all, and implore his forgiveness.' " Ye, I think I had better go, Maria," said Mr. Maggleby. "I will send a clerk home with you, and will telegraph to you as soon as I see your-your late husband. the meantime, try to be calm. Pl'ease them to call a cab, Doddard." Mr. Doddard Feturned to the enter office. and despatched a messenger for two cabs. Mr. Maggleby handed Mrs. Maggleby into one of them, an a clerk followed her. Then the unfortunate man went back for a moment to his private room to study Brad shaw on the best and speediest route from London to Gravsend. There was a train at aquarterpast eleen. Itwas then aquarter to eleven. "And when *ill he be at Gravesend " asked Mr. Magglphy. Mr. Doddard turned again to the Ti?ers. But instead of 't once lighting upon the shipping news hbi eye fell upon a paragraph that occupied a aot very consplicuous posi tion at the foot oef thile page. Suddenly lihe uttered a cry. ? " What'e the ,.ntter, Doddard '" de. manded Mr. Maggleby, who was rapidly growing iipatient Mr. Dddard rlied by bursting into a paroxysm of laugher. " By Jove !" he ex claimed, "this is to ridiculous! I never heard of such a tlhng in my lifo I It is like aplay I Ha, ha, ha" "Your merrimet is rather ill-timed," cried Mr, Maggle reproachlully. "Tell m-wll'!terdPadite~will arrive atraves end; and be quick, or I shall lose that train." "A pump, too I" continued the head clerk hilariously. !' You're mad, I think," said Mr. Maggleby. WVhat do you mean 7" "W ell- radm this, air," answered Mr. Doddard, and he handed the Times to his prineipaland pointed. to the paragraph. Mr Magglehy testily took the paper, ad justed his spectacles, and read: " Extraordinary Discoveryat Plymouth. The corporation of Plymouth recently deci ded. to remove an old, and disnased pump which for many years has stood handleless and dry on the lIoe. Yesterday morning, some Workmen proceeded to remove it, and in its interior they were astonished to dis cover, a number of letters, which had, it is supposed, been put into the hole into which the handle formerly fitted, under the delu. sion that the pump was a post office pillar lotter-box. The letters were at once taken to the Plymouth post-office, and were with out delay forwarded to their destinations." "Can itbe tree!" ejaculated Mr. Magglehy, with'a great sigh of relief. "Then the fact of the Camel having been signalled last night off Dover is merely a coincidence i" "Most certainly," said Mr. Doddard. " Thank Heaven 1" cried Mr. laggleby fervently. "Send the cab away, Doddard. But no I I'll go home again at once, and set my poor wife at ease. Ha, ha I do remem ber now, that when poor Mr. Pudeter came home from his last voyage, he discovered that some letters which he had posted at Plymouth had not been delivered. We didn't miss them, because, as you recollect, Doddard, he'wrote again from Southampton." '"Of course he did, sir," said Mr. Doddard. "Well let us congratulate ourselves. It would have been a fearful business for Mrs. Maggleby to have to go through." "And it would have been bad for you, Doddard, for it would have spoilt your chance of a partnership for some time to come. Now, I'm off." Mr. Maggleby put the Times in his pocket, and departed ; and when he reached his home and showed the paper to his wife, the couple sat together for at least half an hour. talk. nlag over the extraordinary nature of the ad venture. "' Well we shall be able to go to Madams Tnssaud's and the theatre after all, Maria," said Mr. Maggleby at luncheon. And go they did; and what is more, Mr. Doddard became a partner a fortnight later, the firm thenceforward being known as Maggleby and and Doddard.
