Yorkshire v. the Australians. THE Australians commenced the above match on Thursday, 29th ult., at Fartowu. An additional interest was attached to the match, as York- shire had just returned as conquerors from Derby. Fine weather pre- vailed, and this helped to bring a great company. At 12.30 Mr. Gregory won the toss for the Australians, but he sent the Yorkshire-men in. Mr. Lumb and TJlyett led off the batting ; Messrs. Allan and Boyle were put on to bowl. Each of the defenders made a single off Mr Allan, and a bad hit to cover-point saw TJlyett retire, and Lister, who followed, was run out the first ball he received. Two for 3. Lockwood received loud applause aB he walked to the wicket to face Mr. Lumb. The score was quickly raised to 17, when Mr. Spofforth took the ball from Mr. Allan. This change was an effective one, as Mr. Lumb lost his leg stump in Mr. Spofforth's sixth delivery. Three for 17. Greenwood followed, and the splendid fielding of tho Australians, which had so pleased the people at Lord's, met with great applause here. Greenwood was far from being in form, as he soon returned one to the bowler, and failed to score. Foui for 19. Mr. C. I. Armitage succeeded to the vacant spot, and was let off by the wicket-keeper twice He then drove Mr. Boyle for two in a straight direction. Lockwood made two hits to leg off Mr. Spofforth, and then a hard hit in the same direction was grandly fielded by Mr. Blackham, who had made his second appearance with the Australians. The following over saw Mr. Armitage clean bowled. Five for 25. Emmett, the new Yorkshire captain, was Lockwood's next companion. The latter then made the first three (a boundary hit to leg) in the match from Mr. Boyle, and after two singles, the same competent Yorkshire batsman added a drive for two. After receiving his share of six overs, Emmett broke his duck's egg with a single. A couple of maidens ensued, and then the luncheon bell rang. At this period the wicket had played very queerly, and a bad light had prevailed since 12.30. There was a great addition to the attendance during the interval. On resuming, Emmet returned the ball to Mr. Spofforth, which he failed to hold. This made very little difference, as in the next over the Yorkshire captain was taken at forward short-leg. Six for 36. .Armitage came in, made a two from the first ball received, and was afterwards caught at cover-point off Mr. Boyle. Seven for 39. Beaumont was next in order, and making -four, met with a fate similar to Armitage. Eight for 42. Hill occupied the vacant spot, and he hit Mr. Boyle to square leg for four, out of the boundary. This was his only hit of importance, and he succumbed to Mr. Spofforth. Nine for 46. Pinder brought up the rear, and materially helped Lockwood to advance the total to 72. The batting of the departed Yorkshireman was of a first-class character. Without the ghost of a chance, he totalled 33, and his principal hits were two threes and eight UR. J. M.

The first over of the Yorkshire captain produced three byes, and C. Bannerman made a splendid hit for four off Lockwood's last ball. Emmett's second over saw Midwinter capitally caught in the slips. One for 5. Mr. Horan became C. Ban- nerman's next companion, and he quickly snicked Emmett for three. Then C. Bannerman's turn came, and he succeeded in getting another three off Emmett, followed by a two and a four (a grand on-drive over the boundary). Armitage was called upon to relieve Lockwood at 27. In the former's sixth over C. Bannerman fell to a splendid ball. One for 33\. A. Bannerman now faced Mr. Horan, and both batsmen administered severe punishment to the slows of Armitage, and there were only a few singles made off Emmett. At 57 Emmett, whose 21 overs realised 17 runs, made way for Hill, and his first ball disposed of A. Bannerman. Two down. Garrett next joined Mr. Horan, and bj' some small hits the score arrived at 70, and Hill got a wicket by clean bowling Mr. Horan for a splendidly-played innings of 25. Mr. Allan went to the assistance of Mr. Garrett, and kept with him till the close of the day, when S7 runs were made. Friday proved a fine day, and the wickets had been made much better by a btiff easterly breeze during the morning. In the afternoon nearly 7Ã“00 persons were seen on the ground ; the stand for the fair sex was completely filled. Mr. Garrett and Mr. Allan, the not-outs of the previous night, with 19 and 5 respectively, resumed their batting at 12.30. Hill was put at the top end, and Ulyett at the lower. With the first ball of the former Mr. Allan's leg-stump fell, and five wickets were now down for S7. Some fast batting ensued by Messrs. Spofforth and Garrett, and wheu a mistake was made about a run Mr. Spofforth lost his wicket. Six for 105. The Australian captain followed, and Ulyett gave up the ball to Emmett, who changed ends with Hill. The third over of the new bowler saw the bails of Mr. Garrett removed, with the score not advanced. A splendid catch at short leg settled Mr. Gregory. Eight for 10S. When Mr. Boyle came there was a great improvement in the Yorkshire fielding on that of the preceding day. Mr. Blackham -\vas last, and at forty minutes to six the Australians were got rid of. Mr. Murdoch, the not out, played remarkably well for his nine, and the innings closed at 1.10 for HS.

Spofforth and Boyle. Ulyett opened his account by making a leg hit for two from Mr. Spofforth, Mr. Lumb added three singles, and then he fell to the bowler just named. One for 5. After Lockwood had made a single, an adjournment took place for luncheon ; when they got together again, Lockwood drove the ball to the eastern boundary, and twos and threes followed in rapid succession. At 24 Mr. Allan went on in place of Mr. Spofforth, but he failed to get a wicket in six overs. After a few overs from Mr. Boyle, Mr. Garrett superseded him with the ball, and the former came into the field, when he caught Ulyett at long-on. Two for 32. When 40 appeared on the telegraph, Mr. Spofforth resumed at his old end, Midwinter having previously relieved Mr. Allan, and Armitage returned the ball to Midwinter. Three for 46. Greenwood joined Lockwood, who, from the next ball, was wonderfully well caught at long-on from a grand hit. Mr. C. I. Armitage occupied Lockwood's vacated place, and a ball from Mr. Spofforth-not a fast one as usual-sliding from his bat, he was caught at point. Five for 49. The sixth wicket fell for 56, seventh for 57, eighth for 02, ninth for 72, and the tenth, at five o'clock, for 73, or one more than their first venture. Analysis : Bowler. Overs. Maidens. Buns.
