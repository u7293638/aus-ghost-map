The miser's Ghost. A certain clergymen, detained late one night, at a friend's house, accepted, un hesitatingly, the offer of sleeping accom modation in the only disengaged room — the haunted chamber. Now, as the reverend gentleman made it a practice never to travel ever so short a distance without some abstruse theological work in his pocket for perusal at odd moments, it is not surprising that on this occasion he Eat till after the witching hour ; indeed, it was nearly 1 o'clock a.m. when, in a complete but threadbare mediseval suit, tbe vapoury spirit of yet another miser — a skin- flint Ancestor of of the clergyman's host — appeared before him, whom the ready-witted parson at once interviewed somewhat as follows : ' Pardon me, sir, you are, doubtless, a resident in this neighbourhood V ' I am !' replied the somewhat flabby phan tom in sepulchral tones. 'Ah just so! You live, if I may be allowed the ex pression, in this bouse — have dono so, in fact, for some time past?' 'Throe hun dred years.' ' Dear me ! you don't say so 1' ' I do.' ' And have subscribed, naturally, to many local charities — eh 1' ' Devil a bit.' said the skinflint's ghost, clutching the bag of sovereigns he carried more closely to his bony sides ; ' devil a bit, sir.' 'Well then,' replied the cleric, 'you'll pardon my saying no, I know, but don't you think it's about time you did 1' And with this he polite ly presented a subscription list for the renovation of the pariah church. ' You will see,' he went on, ' I have here the names of some of the mostinfluential ? ' He could proceed no further. The smell of sulphur was simply unbearable, and the miser's ghost was laid for ever. The room has since been converted into a nursery. — Irving Montague.
