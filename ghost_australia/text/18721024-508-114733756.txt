A Ghost in a Ooal-Pit. The present tide of prosperity in the coal trade has been distnrbed at the Broughton Colliery, near Wrex ham, by the appearance of a ghost in the underground ?workings, which lias had the effect of frightening son-e of the colliers from the pit. None of the '-en profess to having a sight of the spirit, who appears to have taken up his abode in this ' vasty deep,' but they all confess to having heard at times the most unearthly sounds, and when they proceed to search for the cause the same noises are heard in quite an opposite quarter The fear that ha3 taken hold of the men is such as tc interfere considerably with the working of the colliery, and it shows that colliers, like sailors, are excessively superstitions on the ghost question.
