For the first time since the discussion began Mr. Flicker now spoke. * If I re member .rightly, my lord, the amount of income suggested by you. at our first meet ing was twelve hundred a year — just double the suni you are now in receipt of ? If the family, taking, into consideration all the circumstances of the case, could see their way to fall in with your first suggestion, is there not a possibility that these disquieting* rumors respecting a presumptive matri monial alliance might prove to be without the slightest foundation in fact ?'

Clement, of course, still believed that Cecilia was Mora and Mora Cecilia. .Miss Browne often implored her friend to -undeceive -Mxu£ildewr -bat Cecilia had gone too fir to retreat, '^vt.^ill the ?y ery d4y he jpoes toJDoctors' Commons will I tell him/Vjstfe said; *itis too sweet to me to feel that'-I ani-Ioved Jor myself aad not for my money to allow of my undeceiving him till the last moment.

The two' portraits were finished by this time, as ^ere'aiso the two Academy pic tur,es^r-jCjlem'$;iind., 'Tony Macer's-Trand the pair, of them eent in. Then ensued a period of suspense before it was known what their fate-vypnld^e.- ? ... V; , It was a;j-i)ut, this ^me that Lord Lough toji's first yisit^tp -iiis wife took place.* Clem f orboje to ^^^y^hing to hjs fatlier. about ;aiis ioy.es. a^airPi apd also-begged his mother to kee.p her own counsel in the matter. He did^not TKtnt to provoke any opposition from-liisisLther, which a knowledge of his engagement v 'probably would have done. ^iieiiceVwas o'est till the Tvedding should be ©lose *t hand. Meanwhile Cecilia took lea with Mrs. Fildew once a week. ' ' ... Clem knew nothing about the loilg talks and discussions- that took place in his absence, chiefly, concerning housewifery and the best mode of making a. small income go. as far as possible. He did not know, and he would have blushed if he had known, 'how often, he .himself formed the topic of con. versation on such occasions. To both these loving hearts, one young and one old, he was the dearest object on earth ; why, then, should they not, talk about him ? All Clem knew was that they seemed to agree to gether remarkably well. His mother some times told him jokingly that Cecilia was far too good for him, far beyond his deserts; and Cecilia often asseverated that she only tolerated him for the sake of darling Mrs Fildew. By-and-by came pleasant news. Both Mr. Macer's picture and Clem's were ac cepted at the Academy. Ab soon as Cecilia heard this she went to a dealer, with whom she had had someprevious transactions, and instructed him to go on the private- view day and buy the two pictures for her in his own name. Clem pressed her to go with him on the opening day, bnt knowing that her aunt wonld almost certainly be there, as well as a number of her acquaintances, she put her lover off till later in the week. Clem resolutely refused to go withont her. He heard that his picture was sold, for news of that kind soon finds its way to the studios, but, thinking to afford Cecilia a pleasant surprise, he said nothing to her about it. On ihe fourth day^ihey went together. Cecilia, feeling sure there would be several people there whom she kneWj was very plainly dressed, and wore a veil. She would fain have hurried off to the picture the moment she entered the building, bat Clem, catalogue in hand, persisted in going: to work in the orthodox way. When at length they did reach it, they found quite a little crowd of people in front of it. . Cecilia pressed her lover's arm. 'Whether the critics appreciate your pic ture or no, it is quite evident that the general public do/ she whispered. *It would be the general .public who would' appreciate me if I were to grin through a horse collar at a, fair,' whispered Clem in return. 'Is not that the truest test of apprecia tion?' asked Cecilia, pointing with bright ened eyes and glowing cheeks to the tiny ticket stuck in . the frame. For the first time since entering the building : she had now thrown back her veil. Clem thought he had never seen her look so lovely as at that moment. .. ?? 'You see, dear, there are still a few people in the world with more money than braihs/ he ^aid quietly.

' ' Very shocking, does it not, to 'us with' out petty conventional notions ? If the money were offered in the shape of a brace let, that would make all the difference. But here am I, poor girl, * about to be married, who cannot afford to buy her wedding gown. My. sweetheart offers me money to buy it with. .Am I to be so nonsensical, so stuffed up with silly pride, as to refuse his offer, and say, 'If you can't marry me in my old dress; you shan't marry'me at all ?' I think I have acted as a sensible girl -would act under/such circumstances: Anyhow, I mean to keep that note.' (TO BE' COKTrKDED.)
