*VAGUE PEOPLE. (Fvrom MeLtewdoy? R~eviw. The core of society is coinp nec enough, mnade up so :it is of thorns real doeem of the world's work who are clear so to what they want, and who poises a definite object with both moaning sod method. Dot outside thio solid nucleus lies a floating popolation of vogue. people ; ocbulous poople ; people withont meutat cohorence or the power of iotellectoalgrewth o people without purpose, without aim, who drift with any corrent anywhere, making no sttempi st conscious steering, sod having no port to which they desire to steer; peeple'who areemphaticallyloose in their men? tt lhinegee, and who cannot be trosted with any ofirce requiring distinct perception or erect eneeution ; people to whom enietence is something to be got throogh with as little trouble sod so much plessure as may be, but who have not the fainteotiden that life contains s principle which each man ought ts make clear to himself and work nout at any coet, and to whichbhe ought to sobordiuste and hoarmonice all his faculties and his efforts. These vague people of nebuloos minds compose the larger half of the world, anod count for joet no conch dead woighit, which im pedes or gives ito inert strength to the active agonte es it chancres to be bundled. They are sloe mejority which voeis in committees sand all assemblies so theyv are influenced by the one or two clear-minded leader~s who knnw what they are about, and who drive them like eheep by thn mere force of a definite idea and a resolute will. Yet if there is nothing on which vague people are clear, and if they arc not difficult to influence as the nmajority," there in much onuwhich they are positive us amatter .of private conclotion. In oppositison to the exhortation to be able to give a reason for the faith that is in no, they can give no reason "for any thing they believs, or fancy they believe. They a're sore of the result, hot the logical method by which that result has been reached is beyond their power to remember or understood. To argue with them is to s-pend labour and strength is vain, like trying to make ropes nut of sea sand. Beaten oif" at every point, they settle down again into the old vagne, nap oury credo, and it is like fighting with ghosts to attempt to con v ince thsem of a better way. fhry took at you h~elp lessly, assenst loosely to your prepooltions ; but when you coma to theneceoearyeiedaetion, they doable hack: to a vugne sdsertioa thot they do tot agree with yea, they eannot prove you wrong, bat thsey are sure that they are right ; end you knew then that the collapse is hopeless. If this merant tenacity, it would bee tsoar respertable, even though the convictieo were cerro neon, ; bat .it is the mere animprose;ible fluidity of vagoenees, thse impossibility of giving ehape and co herenco to a floating fog, or a formless hazer. Vague us to the hoots of their beliefs, they are vaguer still as to their facto. These in;decd are likena ladder of whirlh half the range are missing. Th~ey never remembera story, and ehey coanot describe what they have sect;. Of the first they are sure to iese the point and to en tangle the thread ; ef the loot they forget all the de tail, and confound both sequenre and position. As. to dates, they are as if lest iu a wood when you re-: quiro definite centuriess years, months; but they are great in the chronological generosity of "~about,' which is to them what the middle ages and classic times are to uncertain historians. It is as much as they can do to remember their own birthday ; hat' Ihey see never sure of their children's ; "acd generally mix up names and ages in a manner that exasperates? the young people like a personal insult. Wsth the best intentions in the world, they do lull nite mischief. They detail what they think they have heard of their neighbours' sayings and doings ; bet as they never detail anything exactly, or twice alike, by the time they hare told the story to half-a-doee frends they have given currency to half-a-docan dliffe rent chimeras which never existed veeo in their own w.oolly imaginations. No repute is safe with them, even though they may he personally good-natured and noxious not to do snyons harm ; but they sre* so, vague that they are always setting afloat exaggerations which are substantially falsuheods ; and if yes tell them the most innocent fact of anyone you would not injure for worlds--say your own daughter or year dearest friend--they are sore to repent it with addi tions and distortions, till they have muds it into a Frankenstein, which no one now can subdue. Beside t.his mental baziness, which neither sees nor shapes a fact correctly, vague people are loose and unstabte 'no t.heir habits. They know sothing of punutuolity st. hems or abroad, and you are never sure that you will: not stumble en thsem at .most times at what time soerer yen may call. Butworee than this, your own moot times," or any ether times, are rover safe ?from. then. They float into your house uncertainly, vag~uely, without purpose, 'with nothing to say ani spithing; to do, and for no reason thst yen can discever..4usd when they casio they stay ;'anud yenou nasntfor ,the' life of you find otst what tiny want, or why tbcyloaeve come at alL' Theoy invade yenast sli~thas, in your: busj hours, on your' esored days stand 4~t there inn dhautle.ktnd of silence, or wlit vage talk.that 4? toces.: yoor breinsato bring tea focis?; lsnt~they areteoofoggy to underetaud anythiag ls'e a delicate hint, and if you Want to get rid of 'them; yea must risk a quarreii and effeotively shoulder them eat.

A MODE]L Tsasxn'e.-Among the thousends ofoarticles included in the American tariff there are 191 items subject to duties ranging from lat lO 0per cent.., which yielded to thu Onstoms renenue in 1870 Â£48,008. The. cost of collecting them was estimated to ho Â£64,000. Another proof of the wisdom and adrantage of protec tion (remarhs the A?r.qo). Upon eight of these artieles the amount paid to the Treasory was Â£4018, while the amusnt paid hythe consumers tothe monopolisto in the shape of enhanced prices of the local commodities was Â£1,785,305. A?n old Scotols lady was told that her minister need notes. She disholiceed it. Said one, " Go into the gollery and see." She did so, and saw the written sermon. After the luchless preacher had coseinded hois reading on the lost page, he said,: " But I will nol enlarge." The old woman cried out from her lofty position : "Ye coons, ye casna, for your paper's give -out."
