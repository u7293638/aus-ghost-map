The course was Llie usual one, viz., from Spottiswood Point, opposite Stoney Creek, to the gasworks. Jtoth crews eau:o to the po?r in u'ood condition, and the closene&i; of the finish sho ved that thoy were more evenly matched than had boon supposed. The start did not ta-ce place until close npou five, :tiLl:oiyh Jour o'clock w;u» the advertised time, and the Victorian crow (stroked by Booth) immediately went to the i'ront, and depi'ived Sydney of the advan ce which they hud gained by beiugablc to select.the southern sido of tho stream. At (ho Sugur Works Victoria was abcut two leujrths to tho good, and thia advantage was maintained by our representatives for some two miles, despite the plucky efforts of Martiu (the Sjdnoy stroke), ably lacked up by his crow, to lessen the gap. Tho visitors stuc!: to it like "real -.-me •tins," and had the satisfaction of fimliug in tho last, mile that tlicy were gradually overhauling1 thoir opponents. As they drew nearer and nearer tho excitement became .qroat, but the Victorians proved etpi il to tho emergency, and landed their boat a winner by nearly a 'ocgtli. The time was 21 mins. 5 sees. The Victorian cox. handled his boat, well, but the boy in the, Sydney boat made two or throe mistakes. COURSING.
