REMINISCENCES. M. I. C. Dark grows the sky with lowering clouds, The swift-winged birds fly low; Gray waves like ghosts in clinging shrouds On towards the sand ridge flow: I stand wMere I stood, O long-lost friend, With tbee in the days long ago. It was sunshine then, and the sky was blue, The bright sea calm and clear, The sea-gulla over the white waves flew— Do you remember them, dear? I now, as of yore, tlioir white wings watch, Their piercingly shrill notes hear. But you are away In a foreign land, The long days seem like years; I stand here alone on the shell-strewn strand, And I Bee through a laißt of tears. What matters it whether yon storm draws nigh, Or whether the dark sky dears?
