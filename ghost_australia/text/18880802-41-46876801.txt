PARK LANDS. ?TO 5VHR ETDTTOH. Sirâ€” Many a time did my lateflamentec friend, David Gall, and I hold sweet counsel together about preserving the Park Lands sacred to the naa of the citizens of Adelaide, memory has to my loyalty in reference to them. And as to tbe shed put up on the Bide of the King William-road for the tramboys' use I am sure that David Gall would have supported my action in obtaining a few feet for sheltering them against sun, wind, and rain. It ia simply a seat for their use as citizens or the sons of citizens. It ia placed there during the pleasure of the Council, and can be removed upon the reasonable request of the citizens, or Bhould it become a nuisance. There are many seats provided on the Park Lands, notably in the Rotunda enclosure on the other Bide of the road. David Gall did not express himself in the colloquial atyls of his assumed ghost in the letter to which this is a reply, and I will venture to assert that he still rests unturned in his peaceful grave. r am,1 Sir, &c; SAMUEL T0MK1NS0N. :?
