ALL SODL'S EVE- DORA SIGERSON, IN The Bookman. All Soul's Cay is a day on which prayers are said for the soul's of the faithful dead. ' 1 cried all night to you, I called till day was here ; Perhaps you could not come, Or were too tired, dear. Your chair I set by mine, I made the dim hearth glow. 1 whispered, " When he comes I Bhall not let him go." I closed the shutters tight, 1 feared the dawn of day, I stopped the busy clock That timed your hours away. Loud howled my neigbor's dog, 0 glad was I to hear, The dead are going by, Now you will come my dear, To take the chair by mine— Until the cock would crow— O, if it be you came, And could not let me know. For once a shadow passed Behind mc in the room, I thought your loving eyes Would meet mine in the gloom. And once I thought I heard A footstep by my chair, I raise my eager hands, But no sweet ghost was there. We were too wide apart— You in your spirit land— I knew not when you came, 1 could not understand. Your eyes perhaps met mine, Reproached me through the gloom, Alas, for me alone The empty, empty room I The dead were passing home, The cock crew loud and clear, lluvoumeen, if you came, I knew not you were here.
