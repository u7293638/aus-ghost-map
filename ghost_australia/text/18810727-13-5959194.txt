COMMERCIAL INTELLIGENCE. The Argus Office, Tuesday Evening. In the import market business continues to show little improvement; buyers cannot be got to operate, and sales in consequence are of the most limited description. In the principal staples holders have evinced every disposition to meet purchasers, but without having the effect of leading to any transactions beyond supplying ordinary requirements, and even in that respect the dulness experienced givesriBe to numerous complaints Breads tuffs show a slight reduction on yesterday's decline, but it is fully anticipated, now that prices have reached a figure that must draw out buyers, a much larger business will be done. At auction in the forenoon about 2000 bags of prime wheat were disposed of at 5s ; and that is all that can be quoted now. Flour, in like manner, was quitted at 1915 , but though little has yet been done at the price, we expect an improved inquiry to spring up. For small lots we quote up to £11. In feeding grains no large trade has been done. We learn, however, of the quittance of a few hundred bags of oats at 3s. 4d. to 3s. Cid , according to sample Maize is moving off quietly at 3s. 9d and this figure was also obtained at auction Victorian malting barley is selling at 3s. 6d to 3s 6d. Sugars at the public Sale this morning did not go off freely. A few small lots were disposed of at £26 to £35 55 , but the bidding was heavy, probably owing to the sale of Mauritius coming off to morrow, when the entire cargo of the Irene will be sold under the hammer. Teas are moving off steadily. Business is reported at 11d. to 11d. Fine Ceylon and Japan teas will be offered to morrow forenoon In dried fruits a fair inquiry is springing up ; 100 barrels of currants have been quitted at 5d. for good and 5d. for a fair sample, Publicly, 150 barrels, sold all faults, were placed at 5d., and 3d. in bond was refused for cases. Eleme raisins are in request, and Bales, according to quality, are making at 8d. to 8d. A line of 400 boxes Valencias has also been taken at up to 8d. Woolpacks have moderate sale at 2s. 7d. to 2s 8d. Candles still meet with considerable favour, 1,250 boxes were cleared off publicly, chiefly Schiedam's and Gouda's, which realised 8d. A line of 1,000 boxes Jenar'a has changed hands, to arrive, on private terms A parcel of Saigon rice has been disposed of at £20 10s Further business has been reported in sardines, a parcel of 100 quarters having been sold at 4s 9d. Sales of Few's Surrey vinegar are making at very full rates Tandaticker matches, Vulcan brand, have been quitted at 2s 2d. At auction, to morrow, we observe that electro-plated goods of superior quality will be disposed of publicly. In liquids we hear of equal to 50 hhds. Grand Marque brandy having been taken up at a very full price. A parcel of P. Prumer's brandy. has also been got rid of privately. The shipment of frozen fish by the Orient steamer will be submitted to public competition to morrow forenoon Mr. Charles Brown reports having sold (in conjunction with Messrs.
