Anxious to earn undying fame, three of Coburg's young men, whose christian names are Arthur, Joseph, and James, went forth into the darkness and to- wards the dreariness of the locality of the Merri Creek Bridge, Bell-street, to capture the "Ghost." With fearful gar- rotting weapons in their hands and pockets full of "blue metal," they crept stealthily towards the bridge, with their hearts full of courage, and eyes ever on the watch. They soon found themselves in the enemy's country, and James, who was in the van, moistened his hands anId looked blood-thirsty. Arthur did likewise, but Joseph wished he was dreaming of ''Ghosts" instead of hunting them. Out of the darkness there came a blood-curdling form with a bovine caste of features, horrible staring eyes, and horned head, advancing towards them, on all fours. Silently it drew nearer and nearer, and our three "Ghost paraylisers " leant against each other for support, as they found that their knees began to rattle like a penny in a tin money box. With a roar it was on them, or would have been if they had been there, but they left rather hurriedly, not caring to wait for an introduction to the Ghost, in the shape of a big "'White Calf," looking for its long lost brothers. The calf was terribly disappointed at their treatment of him. "You have no sisters, Mr. Chilley, have you ?" "I never had until this summer," said Chilley, sadly. "I've got seven now." Judge : ''Well, officer, who is this prison- or ?" Officer O'Hooley : "Plaze, yer Honor, I captured the man, but his name escaped me."
