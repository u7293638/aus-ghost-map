NEW ZEALAND. NOTES ON PASSING EVENTS. jJltOM OUR OWN CORRESPONDENT.] Auckland, May 30. The topics causing most excitement here at present are the attempts of the Governor to remove the head-quarters of the troops to Wellington, and the arrangements of the Panama postal service. As may he supposed, the Governor's WÍ3I1 to remove the head-quar- ters to Wellington is anything but a popular one in Auckland; the more so that it was fully understood when the seat of Government was changed that this would not be meddled with. After all, however, there are no doubt a great many reasons why it would be convenient for Sir George to have the command of the forces always beside him. It is more than suspected that the Governor is much averse to letting the troops all leave the colony, which would materially change his position for the worse, and it is supposed that he thinks it more easy to delay an embarkation, if he had the General beside him, so that he could influence him personally, without committing all his views to writing. Be this as it may, there is no longer any doubt that Sir George Grey is very urgent about the matter, and chases greatly at the delay on the General's part, who refuses to do anything in the matter until the Home authorities give instructions. This is not surprising either, when it is considered that not less than £150,000 is the estimated cost of removal, and according to the present appearance of things here the expense would be thrown away, as the troops are likely to be all gone from New Zealand in eighteen months' time. A coldness is said to have sprung up already between the Governor and the General, because of the wise caution on the part of the latter, which prevents him from going heartily with the views of the former People in Auckland are, of course, indignant on the ground that, so long as the troops are here, they are far more likely to be required in Auckland than in Wellington, and, by a parity of reasoning, that the same applies to the staff and heads of departments. It is not any longer, however, possible to get up so strong a feeling as it used to be about these things, as the danger to this province is felt to be dwindling down to proportions such as the people themselves can easily cope with. The publication of the Panama Postal Service Tables has added to the dissatisfaction with which the whole arrangement is regarded in this part of New Zealand. It is rather galling to find that, by the arrangement as it stands, Auckland and Otago get a scarcely appreciable benefit from the new and very expensive arrangement, while they pay by far the greater part of its cost. Their natural annoyance at this is increased by the discovery that they might each have gained a great benefit, while Sydney would also have been placed in a better condition and the centre of New Zealand in one scarcely at all worse than now, by the simple expedient of making the passage from Panama, via Tahiti, to the northernmost ports of New Zealand, there dropping mails and transferring passengers, and going on to Sydney j at once; and on the homeward route going round the southern end of these islands, and so | taking advantage, of the westerly winds and currents, just as on the outward voyage, they had done of the easterly trades. However, people here comfort themselves with the conviction that the thing will not work well as at present arranged, and feel pretty confident that the efforts which they will still make will be backed up by experience, and may serve to overturn a plan based on a most narrow and local prejudice, rather than on wide- and enlightened views. Mr. Crosbie Ward, I see, is to have a free passage home in recognition of his services in this matter to the company. Perhaps he is wise to accept it at once, in case they should begin to find out that the very things he insisted upon were the ones most prejudicial to their chance of giving satisfaction to the colonies they propose to serve. The Assembly is to meet, I understand, before the end of next month. At Wellington, of course. It would be rash to say much about the position or the line likely to be adopted by the Stafford Government, but I think the session bids fair to be both important and stormy. The tone of Mr. Cardwell's late despatches is all of a sort to arouse bitter feelings here, I am sorry to say, and it is more than probable that the Parliament will use language which they would at no former period have thought of using. My own impression is that the general feeling will be in favour of meeting the Secretary of State's arbitrary way of writing by repudiating many of the obligations on which he builds so much, and inviting him to take every soldier away from the colony. Of course, the separation question must come on again, and the fate of the Stafford Ministry hangs, I believe, wholly on the attitude which it takes up in this matter. Some increase of taxation will also require to be-con sidered, and the proposal to impose an Income and Property tax has already alarmed greatly the wool princes of the South, who of course know that their large incomes are aimed at by The proposal. On the whole, the Session is likely to be an era in our Parliamentary history. In native matters there is little to report. There is no present danger of an outbreak in the Waikato, and so far as appears, there is little danger of much fighting, either at Taranaki and Wanganui, or on the East Coast. At present the Maories are tired of fighting, and somewhat in want of food; when food becomes plentiful again and they forget their defeats, a new period of danger may arrive. We supplement the letter of our correspondent with some items of Native Intelligence, which the Southern Cross remarks is all that is worth repeating for the month. That journal says : On the East Coast, the expeditionary force under Colonel Lyon, commanding an Upctiki, has returned with cut deeming the object of their search, Koroop, the notorious Hauhau lender, who revived the Muon custom of t-aniubiilbui there during the war. This man was the main cause of the Rev. C. S. Yolkncr's murder. The Vi used as, with whom he has been living of late, promised to deliver him to the commandant at Opotiki, and he believing in their promise, sent back the Arawa contingent, as he was advancing on the tJriivcras to attempt his capture. The Arawas have always been friendly to us, and it el aggrieved at Colonel Lyon's interference. Moreover, they state they were promised £3000 for his capture by the Government, Owing to the threat of scourging and degradation from his cbifltiiiufhip, which his Excellency the Governor made to To Awanui, chief of the Ngutirurc¡ of the Whakntohea tribe, unless he procured the heads of the five friendly natives (Ainvisf') eaten by the Uriwera Hauhaus during the war in the East" Coast, the heads have been given up, and were delivered to the Arawa tribe at Matata, on the 9th of May, by the native Tiwai, who assisted in the escape of the Rev. Mr. Grace, from Opotiki, when Mr. Volkner was murdered. The men, whose heads were preserved, fell fighting on our -side, under their chief Adam Clark, and their bodies were cooked and devoured by the fanatics, Rewi, Matu'aern, the Maori King, and other influential rebel chiefs, refused to see Sir George Grey when he visited Kawhia for that purpose. His Excellency then went on to Hamilton, a military settlement at Kitikiriroa, in Upper \- Vniknto, and tiller come delay had an interview with William C Kempson, which, on the whole, was satisfactory. The li Hewing is Therapson's own version of the interview: I "life filÇÇliSllt-y ; how old you, we- '.ooldc^Tb,oinr,eon, ' Ihouipeon AV evil, it is 13 ce consequence of the b tern 6 I feel in reference to the land is AV Waikato It is the coals cation in Waikato that has caused me trouble, and made me look aged " His Excellency Well, I will' try and got the land back for ten " ThcLij son I should not like to receive the land from your hands I consider it a ready my o-rn-mhentel furn try ancestors You cannot give what is not your own 1 His Excellency I have placed Maoris on their lands in the AV Waikato, and I should place you on years (The Governor then t rested Thompson to go to the Assembly ) " The my son You are the Governor of the country you hav e the r power in 3 our own hands You hay is only to say ' Yes ' and I shall have no and if I go to the Assembly, then they will tell me to go to you, or to the Queen, shall be handled about from one to the other It seems you can do nothing without the advice of your Assembly I myself will get the advice of my Maori assembly to know whether I she be at liberty to go to Wellington I will let you know by and by If you are in earnest about giving 113 back the AT minute, tell your Europeans not to improve their forms, for it will be labour lost glimpses has since written a letter to the Governor, «taling'thatlielias determined not to go to AV Wellington at present A great meeting has been held at Hangatiki, at which Bow 1, Matutaera, Tamara Ngapora, and all the principal men yet in arms were present.
