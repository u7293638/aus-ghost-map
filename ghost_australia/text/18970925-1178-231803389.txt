Strange Visitor. In Northern Skies. A curious aerial phenomenon of a cigar- shaped travelling luminous body at a low elevation in the sky was noted at many points on the mainland coast and Vancou ver Island, British Columbia, last month. At times a bright fight appears amidst the luminous figure. No one seems to be able to satisfactorily explain 'the phenomenon. Thousands have seen it, so it ,is no longer received as a ghost story, though the theory that it is an airship receives less support since the object appears to never descend to earth for supplies or otherwise, and it would be well nigh Impossible for a air navigator to fit lout and sail into space to stay for weeks. Some now think the object which has ap peared to travel hundreds of miles from north to south Is a reflection of a forest or other fire .with a luminous haze around it. Against this theory, however, stands the fact that the central light is far more clear ly defined than a fire would be, and looks like a red star of great brilliancy, surround ed by a cigar-shaped luminous body. This star at times drops streams of sparks. The centre, however, Is not that of a comet, and is much below the stars, and moves slowly onward In a line almost parallel with the sea, and at no great apparent distance above it. The strange visitor has been noticed in many different parts of the province, and also In some sections of Washington State. It Is almost an exact representation of fancy pictures of electrical airships in Ame rican magazines. On the steamer Rithet, en- route from Victoria to New Westminster, all the passengers on board, over 100 in num ber, witnessed the sight.
