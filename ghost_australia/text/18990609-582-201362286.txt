A GHOST SCARE AT BALLARAT. A ghost scare is again on in Ballarat, where a number of females have been frightened by the pranks of stupid jokers. At Brown Hill a man with a loaded fowling piece, while playing the part of a phantom, was seized by one of his neighbours, and during the struggle the gun went off, harmlessly. In Ballarat East several Europeans und Chinese met an unearthly figure in Humphrey-street, which gave forth phosphorescent light, causing the Chinese to collapse in terror. At Redan a local " push" is roaming after dark in white garments, to the great alarm of women and children.
