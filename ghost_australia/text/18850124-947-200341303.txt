THE rOBTAl.'1 1 Mabel Burniaton was .Lady Burniston's youngest .daughter— youngest and only unmarried daughtor ; all the others — and there had been four of them— were satis factorily settled. That Mabel 'was Lady, Burniston's daughter is said advisedly, for though of course bIio was Sir John Burniston's daughter too, no one ever, spoke of Sir John as having anything or being anything. He was one of the many nobodies of life. But his wife was far from being nobody. A woman who has brought up Gve daughters, and married four of them off as each reached the age of nineteen, certainly deserves to be con sidered;; somebody amongst English matrons; especially when it is born in mind that these four young ladies had not been remarkable for good looks, neither had they any fortunes — afcloast none worth speaking of; -Now it was Mabel's turn, ? and/ ' i^-tb(e .'ifirat' four, had, done kail, she .Was oxpectod ) By her mother to do still ^bbtte'/: fpry unlik,e her aiaters, Mab6l -Burnislpn' was'b exceedih'gly, -pretty; so ^prett$that, a!ready..she was. aoknowledge'd! as the beauty of the season. .'..-?'' She was rather Bmall and very fair ; but her figure 'was 'as -perfect in -shape ;; as her face in colour. Her . hair, was . of that bright golden' hue which is still so uncommon, .in,. Bpite!-..qf ,all .that.oan be .. done, ,by 'auriferous fluid' 'and ' other ? prepara tions. She wore ' this' golden hair in a thick .if ringe . on her white forehead^: doming ; down nearly to tho .delicately pencilled e) ebrows, beneath which shone out a pair of the moat lovely dazzling blue eyes that ever bewitched mortal man. Very young, very fond of pleasure, full of life and spirits, and an1 acknow ledged belle, it was no'wpnder, perhaps, that Mabel should be a'flirt'.1- [Still it was a'- pity,,,,, thought her mother, because jit might spoil her prospects.. It was a pity,, thcjught her, jCoasin.Douglaa M'Kenzie, because it might break his heart.
