CAPITAL PUNISHMENT. TO THE EDITOB. fir— A correspondent writes under the head ing of 'Is Capital Punishment Justifiable?' I quite agree with him, and say absolutely no. My reason for eo Baying is plain. Every man bears en bis forehead the marks of a dignity from wbese high entail he cannot be cut off, ano irem wooee eoiemn rtBponsiDiuues ne cannot be freed. Be his outward form the most perfect or tbe rco&t; degraded, there is in tbe ppirit within him an argument of potent energy why his rights should be recpected and his sorrows compassionated. Trample not on man, for the image of God ie there. The hnman body is called the temple of the Holy Ghost ; and if the temple of- God surely no inconsiderate trifle,. To these arguments others might be added to show tbat man is accounted by Deity worthy of great honor, and though frail and feeble iB nevertheless the mightiest work of God. The question may arise, what are we going to do with criminals ? The problem is simole— make them earn their living inside walls, then teach them and show them the wrong they did. — I am, &c.; ? P.
