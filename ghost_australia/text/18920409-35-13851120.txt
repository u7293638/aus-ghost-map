WESTMINSTER, MARCH 4. By an interest in the imminence of the dissolution has been obscured by the attraction of dis- closure made in connection. with the Ministerial crisis of 1936 At that time, as history, records and many people personally remember, there was the interval during which doubt existed as to who is to be the successor of Lord 1, consided The country had plainly change i entered its wish in the matter, having; declined in favour of Mr Gladstone by a majority at the poll exceeding in number that of "nell pla 7d Mr Dmr told in power In 1871, and kept him there through six memorable years It secured the most natural thing in the world's notable ponsciuoncc-that Mr Oin stone should for the ith be sent for by the Queen and entrusted with the scab, of office But the mandate from Windsor significantly carried The public learned with some amusement that Lord Hartington had been here for " His visit was repeated on the day after he first obeyed the command, and then it was made known that, late in the afternoon, Mr. Gladstone had been bidden to Windsor and kissed hands on his appointment as First Lord of the Treasury The public had at the time its own explanation of this curious instance It was said that Lord Hartington being titular Leader of the Liberal Part) (though for fully three years displaced by the torrential personality of Mr Gladstone, brought back to political life by the Bulgarian Ettrooitics), the Queen is til felt bound to invite him to form a Ministry in succession to Lord Beaconsfield, and that he, as had been oxpLotert declined the impossible task, and referred her Majesty to Mr Gladstone Whereupon the Queen, having done all that politeness and concert for the feelings of an estimable man demanded, had had resort to the natural successor of the fallen Minister After stooping for a dozen years in the pigeon-hole of history, this record is suddenly taken down, and has a new gloss put upon it Three weeks ago the Speaker came out with the announcement, definitely made with unmis.nJ.ablo air of authority, that so far from being a passive, oven is now willing party to the little farce which pointed him out as Premier to the exclusion of Mr Gladstone, Lord Hartington had seriously accepted the imitation, and had endeavoured to form an Administration, abandoning the attempt only when he found that our turn indispensable personages would not bind themselves to the undertaking The Sprain is a weekly journal of recent birth, but it has already obtained a high position as an exponent of Liberal pi inciples tinted in accordance with views taken below the gangway in the House of Commons Its elliot, Mr Wemyss Reid, is a man of high standing personally and professionally He will be known to you as author of the "Life of Forster," and more recently RB biographer of Monckton Milnes, first Lord Houghton He is on forms of close personal intimacy with all the Liberal chiefs, and is not a man likely to be misled on an important matter of foot The dis- closure was received with a storm of indignant denial on the part of the Dissentient Liberals, [ shocked to find their leader accused of what in politics would be regarded as worse than an act of personal disley city, indicating as it did that in this matter Lord Hal lington's ordinarily sound judgment had been obscured by personal ambition The James thundered and raged through SUCLOSSH O mornings It columns Were crowded with letters, printed in large type, denying the impeachment, and soundly abusing the editor of the Speaker The Duke of Devonshire himself entered the lists, authorising the publication of a statement purporting to contradict the Spencer's allegation This sound and fury, which for three weeks has shaken the political world, will, doubtless, seem to you, who have the advantage of viewing the scene in perspective, ridiculously exaggerated Supposing it is literally true, it is not a charge under which a politician might be constrained for over to hide his abashed head Up to the point at which interposes Lord Carrington's action on Monday morning, the 22nd April, when he went down to Windsor to see the Queen to Tuesday afternoon, when he called on Mr Gladstone with a message bidding him repair to AVmdbor, there is nothing new in the situation It is a matter of history that Lord Beaconsfield, exercising his constitutional privilege of recommending a successor when he handed in his resignation of the Premiership permitted himself indulgence in a little personal spite Mr Gladstone was plainly designated by the popular voice But it Lord Beaconsfield could control ev cuts the price should be withheld from his rival's grasp There is no doubt that Lord Beaconsfield found in the Queen a willing instrument for his purpose Her Majesty's detestation, in which the Prince Consort shared, of the Mr Disraeli forced into her counsels by the desperate necessities of Lord Derby in 1862, was a mild motion compared with her distaste for Mr Gladstone Years ago, long before the Speaker spoke, there was current among Lord Hartington's friends an exceedingly graphic phrase which had fallen from his lips, descriptive of the pressure put upon him when on that April Monday afternoon he went down to Windsor, and was implored to keep out Mr Gladstone" Lord Haw tuition's share in the plot, even if it was as each. one the speaker describes it, was, if an office at all, exceedingly v coal He had the Queen's commands to form a Ministry, and if, as there is no doubt he did, he went to Ijbrd Glanville and asked him if he would join him, he was only acting in accordance with the instincts of a dutiful subject Lord Granville, with a keener view of the actualities of the situation, promptly said "No" Lord Hartington, supported by this confirmation of his or signal objection, went back to Windsor, convinced the Queen that Lord Beaconsfield's plot was impracticable, and there the matter ended The interest aroused by this incident lies apart from the intrinsic importance of the action alleged against Lord Hartington Public curiosity is piqued as to the identity of the hand that has suddenly brought forth this ghost from the past, and made it walk the public stage In one of the articles which have appeared in the speaker it was said that only four persons had direct knowledge of the circum- stances Mr Gladstone, Lord Granville, Mr Bright, and Lord Hartington Of these two are dead, and as it is not likely the present Duke of Devonshire made the communication to the editor of the Speaker it follows by irresistible process of deduction that it is Mr Gladstone who is behind the screen It is this strong suspicion that li is nerved the arm of. the I men to strike at the speaker, and has envenomed the day that have been shot through its columns at the sturdy figure of Mr Wemyss Bid Mr Gladstone chanced to be away on the III were when the storm burst. He is home now, and it is daily expected that he will make some sign in response to the innuendoes and insinuations that darken the air Up to this time of writing, on the point of the departure of the mail, he has not spoken But it is more than probable that next week's mail will be freighted with minute particulars of the history of this remarkable episode in the meanwhile as full disclosure is only temporarily delayed, I shall be guilty of no breach of confidence in anticipating it Indeed, the vi hole documents connected with, the case were shown me with permission to make such use of them as I pleased The process of logical deduction, combined with the trained insight of political partisans into the iniquity of Mr Gladstone, have not gone astray It was he who communicated so the editor of the Speaker this hitherto unwritten chapter in the history of a Mimttcnal crisis With what object it was do so, or what useful purpose at the present time it is designed to serve it is not, I am happy to BJ, my business to suggest Mr Gladstone was doubtless wrought into a state of indignation by an article which appears in the Times a little more than three weeks ago, accusing him of ingratitude towards Lord Hartington, who, as the uttiiM put it, had in 1880 voluntarily stood, aside, ijiioriiiomg his own preferment in order to advance Mr Gladstone That is a statement so childish in its inaccuracy that it might well have been left to the trenchant exposure of fallacy and testified ignor sauce to which the Speaker subjected it On reading the article in the Speaker, Mr Gladstone wrote from St Raphael to Mr Wemyss Reid, expressing his approval, adding in further refutation of the Ames' biplcLaseump tion that, so far from having stood aside to let his old chief come in, Lord Hartington had an deavoured to form an Administration desisting only when it was found to be impracticable It trM on this owrtiunitw* "~ W ti» Sftakvr 1 fónna«d"its~nb\v famous article, drawing down the of storm which has since raged, incited to fury by the strong and, as you will see, the well-founded suspicion that Mr. Gladstone was at the bottom of it! all.
