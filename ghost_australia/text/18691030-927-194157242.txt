SERVANTS IN EXCEL8IS. [From the London Review.) Within the past few days we have been treated to several dramatic cTnihitions on the part of maids-of-all-work, waiters, butlers, and the like, which serve to show us, in striking colours, the joys and sorrows of a servanto* existence. Asia although these revelations come to us through the ugly medium of a wiTim-flnnrf t3i«v fcrA&t; mnm of invs than of sorrows. Looking at several of the hints thrown ont in the course of various trials, it becomes evident that the life of a servant is not without its compensations. Indeed, many a hard- work- ing man and woman, striving to keep a house over their head by independent exertion, may be disposed to regard tbe condition of a. servant, as described in these polioe reports, with envy a» well as with indignation. Creature-comforts, abound ; nor is the consolatory influence of tie tender emotions absent A landlord complains of a drunken and impertinent waiter that be ia neglecting his duty, and, in defianoe of orders, in the habit of entering the sleeping-chamber at the maid-servants. The waiter fights bis master, and gets pulled up for assault The maid-servants, who seem to have sunk all jealousy in their common admiration for this Captain Macheath, submit to the loss of their situation, and attend court in order to give what evidence they can to succour their brother in trouble. Not only that, but when he is fined they subscribe to help him to pay. Oould dis interested devotion go further ? With the best intentions, they maintain in court that the room which tbe prisoner was in the habit of entering was not their bedroom, although one of the guileless young creatures subsequently admitted that ' they put away the beds when he came in.' Thereafter, when this evidence has been found of no avail, and the object of their mutual regard is fined by a hard-hearted magistrate, Polly and Betsy join their small savings together, and set the hero bee. There have been leas romantic romances put upon the stage. A much more instructive story, though ex hibiting less of sentiment, is that of the in subordinate butler who, a few days ago, became the expositor of the dissatisfaction, which reigned in the kitchen of a colonel's household. The circumstances connected with the origin of the affair are mysterious ; for we are told that the butler and iis wife were drinking ale at eleven o'clock in the forenoon, before the alleged cause of offenoe had-occurred. The colonel's housemaid, in giving her evidence, remarked that the butler's wife, speaking of that important official, was graceless enough to say, 'The old beast has been at me again.' From this we gather that the butler had been caressing bis wife with a broomstick, or some such implement, and tbat the effects of the quarrel were still disturbing the pladdity of bis mind. At luncheon, the colonel observed that hiB butler was 'in a state of beer,' and was acting strangely. He objected to change tbe plates, or to allow knives for the cheese. It seems to us that tbe butler was acting rather illogically and unfairly in revenging himself for bis wife's delinquencies by compelling his master to eat cheese off a dirty plate, and in refusing to supply knives for that purpose. However, the matter passed off, and at two o'clock the ladies and gentlemen of ihe lower floor sat down to dinner. It was hashed mutton. Conceive tbe state of mind the butler must ha-vo found himself in on being expected to eat hashed mutton. Even the gentle housemaid turned with loathing fawn this commonplace and contemptible dish. She, according to her own statement, ' ate but little, as she felt an noyed because they had no roast beet and pud ding.' There were roarsol laughter in court when this remark was made ; but these proceeded from a coarse and vulgar audience, who could not understand tbe delicacy of appetite which a refined method of living induces. It is title that the colonel'* own children .ate bashed mutton on that day ; but children do not know their rights, and are easily imposed upon. The butler had a better notion of the sirustion when he pointed out that ther* was venison psty for the colonel, bat that tJis servant* bad none of ii- XVI. it, «i lrtn-4 lanaiVitr-ai*'* sansatn til msltVfcV Had the colonel properly Appreciated bis dnties as master, he would have dined off the hashed mutton, and left the venison pastry for his hard-workec1, industrious, modest dependents. On theoonbary, be not only monopoUssa the venison, but he neglected evsn to otderaanr loin in ti»m. The oousqucnon may bt *«w. *-«sr iai *Sfc. a*, it sews, '-*asi ; «^*gBEgy&4f iaeyoitoig.
