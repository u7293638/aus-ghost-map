A COLONIST AT ST. PAUL'S. A IÍRW SENSATION has boen discovered by n contributor to CAambcra' Journal-ot perhaps lt would bo better tossy that tho sonsatlon was forced upon him. Ho hnd novcr seen tho interior of St. Paul's Cathedral, and it being hi« last evening In London proviom to his ruturn to Australia, he provuilcd upon a Rrev-hcaded old man, so he says, to lot him into the building when tho shades of evening had gathered around it. Tho colonist, who was left in the building nlone, saw a fow feot from the lloor-not n ghost-but n rope dangling from tho vast height above, and having bion n famous gymnast in yenrs gonn by, ho caught hold of it, nnd found himself being drawn up of courso to his great horror. Soon he almost lost possession of his Bensen and ht« «trongth, expecting overy' moment to bo dashed to pleccB. Ultimately, he became quito unconscious, and when ho como to, ho found himself on tho floor, with his grey-headed friend bending over him. It appears that tho old man returned jiiBt in timo to BOO tho hero of ibis start- ling episode dangling in tho air, that ho whistled thrco times, just nt ho bad observed tho workmen did whon they wanted tho rope lowered, tho pulling up Btopped, and tho rope came down, tho colonist hold- ing tin till lt nenrly ronched tho floor ngnln. If tho story ls no: truo it might bo. Moral : When you go into St. Pnnl's and BCO a ropo swinging from tho roof, don't practice gymnastics upon it.
