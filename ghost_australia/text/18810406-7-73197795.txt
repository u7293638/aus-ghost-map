LAWYEKS' CHARGES. TOTHB BDITOB Sir-A refreehisg little BUI is now on the files of tbe British House of Commons. It l-(ginE — 'Whereas -the class of persons known as bhnfcters-at-law Mve for roanyyeats con tributed to tbe vast«cpsn«e«f litigatioo, and have oppressed ' tile suitor by demanding for their services fees which they oonsider fairly repretefitfrom flieirgtoiBt of view the value ef their «erviAes whieh ooone is eompelled to re tain, and which they cannot be compelled to give; and whereas solicitors voluntarily pay such fees, and also make ^gratuities to'batTtB- tera' clerks; and whereas it is desirable to protest the public against auch prac tisw and to enable them through their solicitors to rebus . the services of bar risters for a less fee than they will consent to take.' The Bill goes on to say that no Q.O. (-ha]l ask or take more than fifty guineas, and that no junior shall ask or take mow than twenty guineas as a brief fee without liability to be disbarred. Any barrister accepting a greater fee than that marked on brief in a case lasting less than three weeks, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor. The Bill is perhaps a little too drastio, but its terms are worth noting as evi dencing tbe feelings of the publio with regard to the extortionate charges to whioh they are subjected. A milder form of the BUI would be acceptable to many here, and I trust some can didate will promise some auch Sill, and keep his promise.— I am, be, HUME'S GHOST.
