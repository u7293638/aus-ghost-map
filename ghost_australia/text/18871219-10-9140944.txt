V.> VVHLLINGTONi > t .i ,i This match ,wo» cotUiuaed /ou Saturday, ?-und-for all lovers of crickot (alas, how the number, of luoh ,riow-a-du'ys seems to Locóme less and lesj) was a real treat. ThC! ground was in splendid order and certainly greitly in favour of the batsman. Tho cup is still rambling round awaiting sonic club to give it a happy resting place. It looked like anybody's game when play was called. Macleod and i, E. Piesse batting to tile bowling' If Ryan and Howe, the first three ¡ overa were militions. Macleod was thou liowleVl by a " yorkor " from Byan. 2-21-77. Tho Wellington captain took his place. E. Pit 880 was then caught by A. 'Swan for(a useful 20. J, G. Davies was the I next to meet his fate. 4-1-D7. Burn and Gatehouse now got together, and notwith- standing tho very really good Holding shown, capcolally that of Q. Vautin, J. Watt, and A. Swan, were not parted till 148 runs had been ndded to the soore-Gatehouse making 15 runs in one over alone, in- cluding threo fours, and was caught at the wickets for a grandly earned score of 76, Including 9 four's. Burns BUC cumbed to Byan with an equally good con- tribution of 00 (in this score 7 four's and a five). Tho last two wickets, Cundy and A. Piesse, proved very stubborn, and tho last named oarriod out his bat for an honest 41 (8 four's). 10-HI-314, or 225 runs to the good, Strange to say the Dei went innings also opened with threo ni lideu overs. J. Watt did not give any trouble, and was soon succeeded by li. Swan. Then tho "motion" commenced, a more perfect display of bat- ting than that of G. Vautin would . be almost impossible to witness. Kendall, Cundy, Macleod, and K. Burn did their very best, but even the cunningly concocted patent registered break-back globules of the first failed in their object. ' As for tho hitting, it WAS terrific, 14 fours and 3 fnes. Had a certain gonlal skippor (truo-bluo skipper, none of your lobster 1 skippers) been present, his enthusiastic exclamation of "Ghost of a marino, that is a smack," >vould havo often ro sounded through the still summer ' air. it was not till this batsman had mado OS that 1 he gavo a chanco at the wicket, which was uot accepted. Ho got 02 runs before ho mide a single, and to sum up, out of a total score of 134 ho made 08, anti thon carried his but. E. Swan played vory protty cricket for his 17\. The lidding was very excellent.' One chanco iu the long field «tas refused,' and It" might almost bo said that only two chances were given from first to lust during the innings.
