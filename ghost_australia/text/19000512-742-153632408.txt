CORRESPONDENCE. THE ANGLICAN CHUBOH. [TO THE EDITOB.l Bib,— Would his Lordship the Biship kindly favor us with the names of the gen tlemen in his following possessed of the 11 gift of the Holy Ghoet,' as published in late proceedings of the Synod, bo that we might occasionally donate a penny to the poor box, to provide brass candlesticks for the sanctuary during the process of auricular confession, and all the ceremonial attached to it? Tampering with the morbid mind Indicates a Bense of weakness ; its evolntidBF will not incre&BB; the dignity of tbe Church, and lhe clergyman who attempts to preach or practise such doctrine will find himself greatly minus his stipend. Churchmen ought to feel much obliged to Captain De Hoghton for having the courage to expose this innovation, which we in this colony will never tolerate. The affair in question does not add lustre to the Church militant, while it greatly exposes the mnndane quirks of those whose garb ought to hold some chiim at least to common respect above the ordinary man in the street. — Yoard, etc., Laymah.
