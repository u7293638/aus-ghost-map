HAWEEYE'S GHOST. Last year the large numbers of people who met in the different towns in Aus- tralia to celebrate the glorious Twelfth of July, caused the spite and concealed Romanism or a writer for the Echo to overflow into its columns over the name of Hawkeye. The bigoted and untrue alle- gations of this scribbler were dealt with at the time by the Protestant Standard, and when our usual advertisement of contents was sent to the Echo and Morn- ing Herald, these papers refused to print them, because among these contents was a notice of Hawkeye's invective. Since that characteristic instance of fair play, we have saved our shillings and done without any further advertisements in the Herald and its Echo. The lesson which we read them has had some effect. The name of Hawkeye is suppressed this year, and his diatribes somewhat shortened and toned down. The same hand and spirit betray themselves in every line. He cannot even vary the words. The cuckoo cry is the same. It is just what the papist always is constrained to say con- cerning the L.O.I., because it is the one consistent supporter of that liberty of thought and worship, and that supremacy of law and right, which popery hates, and that hatred of despotism, priestcraft and superstition which popery adores. That such men should inveigh against such an Institution is natural enough ; but that the Echo should lend its columns to anonymous sectarian slanders is deplor- able. The Hawkeye is evidently hooded, and the Echo is the hood. Is there not some proverb which speaks of two faces under a hood? The Echo has evidently two facesâ€” popish and protestant. But the popish face only is hooded, the pro- testant face is for the public.
