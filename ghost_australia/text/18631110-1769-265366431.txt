\- MINING CAOTAKTI^S: That there are accident to life; 'in the conduct of mining operations, which no hn,ma^ foresight could prevent, is ubdeiiiablp, bu| from statistics which have been gathered from time to time', it is evident that the majority J of sueh accidents are the result of careleinessr Tbe Royal Mining Commission, in dealing with tbe question of " prevention of mining accidents," «tates^ that thoee fatal-minings oidents which have resulted from ignorance, carelessness and mismanagement, in blasting, timbering, erecting and driving steam-engines and machinery, and in ^conducting mining works generally, have been so. numerous as profoundly to impress tbe mining jeommnnity with the absolute necessity for prompt and stringent legislation for the prevention, as far as possible, of similar accidents for the future, and for the punishment by fine and otherwise, of any person whose culpable vegli^enoe,- or mismanagement, bas caused death or any seriowjradily^iyn^or^amagejto^ajfellpj^cx | Mr. tore. But theCommissionere,in this respect, have only done a partial service to the community, inasmuch as they .omitted to take.' any evidence, which would ha7e enabled them to classify the accidents, and eo to show, in an unmistakeable manner, their nature and causes. On so important a subject as the saving of human life, full information should have been sought by -the pommissiotere, because there are many difficulties connected with it, and almost every miner has some different scheme of his own to propound. We conceive, however, that there is no more fallacious notion, than that tbe appointment of government- offlcere, orXjnspectors, would overcome the difficulty, indeed tbe Commissioners themselves partly recommend the appointmentof district mining inspectors, ''with a tfew to abate the frequency of mining accidents." The report is, however, dumb as to indications of the particnlar .way in which mining inspectors would be able to etop reckless working, or how tbe enforcement of those precautions, which are «o necessary, is to be carried out Everybody admits that punishment should he inflicted on .those who carelessly cause injuries .to others, but in tbe tnajority of esses,,the careless man is himself the sufferer from his own fault, Hind ho vigilance on the part of: raining inspectors would be sufficient to pj^vqpt |hese,(in mosA instances) nnanti<npated«vents.. - . . -.. .. i. T~r We'«uggest; in the meantime,--nktil furtlier light can be thrown on tbe matter^ that companies and - proprietors -of -mines &nd;<plahts, should draw np stringent , regulations, imposing heavy -fines - ion - those employes,* "who, through negligence, rnnihe slightest risk of injuring either themselves or others.' Anignorant meddler, ?igmng liimself,"Ob-, server," who evidently wishes to be mischievous, as he cannot be useful, addresses the folloiring to the Jlf „ A. 11 ail:—" Allow me to draw your attention to the extraordinary ' number of magistrates pow being made in the district of which AIr. „John Ramsay is the represetijalive.

I do-not intendquestioning the propiety of the appointments, but it certainly must either- be a most lawless district to require so many J.

The Secretary of the Maldon United Club has received a letter from Bendigo, agreeing to play a friendly home and home match with Maldon, the first to take place at Bendigo, on Wednesday, tye 18th : instant.
