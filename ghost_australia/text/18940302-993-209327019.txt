JL Curious Lawsuit. A gentleman living ia the Avenue de Neuilly, Paris was terribly annoyed with rats in his house. They were large, ravenous, numerous, and hard to catch. Finally he managed to trap one of tbe pests, and equipping him with a tiny bell, fastened to his neck with a bit of wire, set him agun at liberty. The rat, of course, ran to find his companions, and they all ran as eagerly to avoid him, and in a very little time there was not a rat left on the premises. Near by there lived a nervous gentleman, and one night he was awakened by a curious tinkling sound, which came on fitfully, and seemed to proceed from every crner of the room. He lit a candle, and timorously proceeded to search. There was nothing visible, and yet the mysterious sound was distinctly audible. He tried to think it waB imagination, but failing, decided it must be ghosts. It was clear his house was hauntedâ€”and haunted, too, by day as well as by night. For weeks he could sot sleep, and his anxiety told on his health. At last a gossiping servant learned the truth, and the victim, instead of laughing at his own credulity, has begun an action against the man who belled the rat.
