FISH AND THEIR FOOD: We are all familiar with the fact that the rat is shaken in the mouth of the dog before, the unfortunate animal gives up the ghost, but it is not generally known that those cold-blooded inhabitants of the water, fish, very commonly shake their live prey in much the same way. This is, perhaps, in order to kill it, but also it may possibly be to .tear it into pieces, previous to to eating. A dog can easily help himself by placing its fore paws npon the food and tear.it to pieces if the morsel is too large. A fish cannot exactly do this, and the only other way by which it can reduce the food to smaller portions, is by shaking it vigorously in its month.: It is interesting to watch the fishes in an aquarium; when the food is cut up, the fragments occasionally hang together and produce too large mouthfuls for the use of the fish at the moment. Then it is that one may see them fiercely shaking the food. Or a yonng ffsh may seize another piece, and the two. apparently fight over it until It comes into two. Many of the crustaceans, crabs and lobsters, &c.;, convey the food to their mouths by means of their claws in very much the same way as we human beings carry our food with our hands. It is, however, only to this family and those related to them that the helpful claw has been given, the other inhabitants of the deep must shake their heads ip a helpless if vivacious manner.
