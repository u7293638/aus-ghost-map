MARTIN CASH ; OR THE OUTLAW OF TABLEMOUNT. rCoPTEioar. i An Historical Narrative of the Early Days, from the Diary j of an Old, Colonist. j fIN SEVENTEEN PARTS.) j PART XVI. Taking about six pounds of gun powder, the leader advanced cautiously but quickly towards the circular build ing, which was not more than one hun dred yards distant, and soon reached it There was a small reczss close to the ground in the stonework evidently for drainage purposes, and into this Cash inserted the powder. A train was laic out for soma distance and the aperture of the recess partly closea by a log which lay close at hand. When all was ready the powder train was ignited, and, raising his right arm as a signal to his comrades, Cash drew a pistol and ran round the building. The huge dog in front at once espied him, but almost ere it couid bay the bushranger fired aud killed it. The distance between this round structure and the homestead proper, was not more than fifty yards, and it did not take many seconds for so fleet a runner as Cash ;o cover it. Short as was the time, however, the explosion occurred before the door was reached, and just as a man, bent almost double with age, came to it a terrible blast took place. The volume of smoke which shot up obscured the greater part of the struc ture for a time, but as it cleared away the full effects of the explosion were apparent. The loosely built stones were hurled and thrown about in all directions — in fact the place had col lapsed. The howls of the wounded and dying dogs were terrific, and the sight and the noise seemed to paralyze the old man who had come to an swer the door, and was no other than Apsley himself. 'Surrender or you are a dead man. I am Martin Cash, the bushranger. It any resistance is made I'll not scruple to take life, so be wise and yield with out trouble !' the leader cried as he confronted the aged owner of the farm house. By this time Cash was joined bf his two comrades, and though several men belonging to die farm made their ap pearance from different places, they were all unarmed and entirely at the mercy of the outlaws. To resist meant death. They had all heard of Martin Cash and his comrades and were not disposed to irritate them by useless re sistance. Moreover, tbe summary measures taken to destroy the dogs had a salutary effect on them from the bushrangers' point of view. Every one of the animals had been killed or seriously injured by the explosion and the falling stones, and the sight was a pitiable one as the wounded animals dragged them selves about howling with pain. ' Let me get pistols and put these poor creatures out of their agony, ' pleaded the old man as he watched his favorite dogs. ' IH save you the trouble. It's 'best to shoot them, no doubt Watch these people for a few minutes,4 the leader said to his fellow-outlaws as he strode towards the kennels.' There were — so far as he could see — six full grown dogs in die place and four puppies. Only three remained ? alive, and Cash soon put them out of pain by shooting them. This done, he turned towards the homestead and be gan the serious business of the day. 'Muster all your servants in the kitchen, and mind no one is left out,' he said to the old man, who Jones told him was Apsley. The latter did not make any demur to this order but at once obeyed it Indeed, the employees scarcely wanted telling, for they turned into a large wing on the south side of the home stead which was used as tbe kitchen and common dining-room. There were a dozen male-servants at the farm and three female-servants, but four of the former were in the outfields. They had heard the explosion and were now returning to the homestead in con siderable perturbation. Of course they had no idea of what had really hap pened, but naturally suspected that the powder which Apsley kept in the house bad exploded. Kavanagh, who remained outside, saw these workers coming across the paddocks, ar.d he went inside until they came close to the house. Then going out he covered them with his musket and quickly marched them in to their prisoner comrades. ' I don't see young Apsley amongst the crowd,' said Jones to his chie£ ' Where is your son ?' curtly asked Cash of the oid man. ' My son ?' repeated Apsley senior rather startled. 'My son? Oh yes. He is in Hobart Town. Went away a couple of days ago on business,' he ! concluded, in a rather jerky sort of j manner. j The answer seemed to satisfy the] bushrangers, who said nothing further j on the point but proceeded to make j * themselves as comfortable as possible j The larder of Apsley farm was well j stocked, and Cash ordered the best - food in the house to be prepared for all hands. He desired to ingratiate himself with the employees, as it was always wise to conciliate them. ' I intend to stop here a couple of days, Apsley,' he began, ' and in the meantime I'll take care of your fire arms. Let me have every weapon of the sort in tbe house, and I can pro mise you will not be molested. There must be no treachery. If there is, you know what will result.' v The farmer spoke to ope of the men, telling him to show the outlaw where the arms were kept, and in ten Mnibntes ; the chief had them all secured in a corner of tbe large room, These which 1 were loaded he drew the charges from, and that done, he proceeded to do full j justice to the excellent repast set before him. v | There was plenty of strong drink placed on the table, but the outlaws j were not foolish enough to indulge tod ? freely in it. In fact* sobriety was one : of the main factors attending the sue- j cess of Cash's gang. It was .now rapidly drawing on to* mmt* eveningt and tbe badmagersj COBStitt& as to the best netted ot get what rest was possible under the circumstances, and for that purpose Cash told the servaiits that they could retire torest at the usual time, but the men mustsleep in the kitchen and the women in their own quarters. By this arrangement two-jifi§e eppvjets would be able to sleep while tbe othpr one, mounted guard overthe unarmed eg}: ployees. . This suited the latter well enough, and, truth to say, when they found there was no danger of brutal treat ment from the outlaws they rather en joyed the diversion. It really meant relaxation to them at the expense of the master, for while the bushrangers remained no work would be done. In . addition they would eat and drink of. the best, and altogether their lot would be much better than under the ordinary ', routine of life. ' . The only person who looked par ticularly gloomy, and indeed vengeful, ?was old Apsley. For the first, time in thirty years the (arm had been success fully raided and his trusty dogs de stroyed without him having a chance, to fire a shot Still a look of hope sometimes flitted across his face as he sat moodily before the spacious fire place. Cash noticed his dejection, end said: — 'This is the first 'time I be lieve, Apsley, you have ever had to en tertain bushrangers. I must say you do it well, and we will always think gratefully of you.' The old man turned fiercely and ex claimed : — ' You may never get a chanfce to be grateful. You've come to Apsley Farm, but you haven't got away yet Don't make too sure of anything in this place 1' The outlaws only laughed at the old man's chagrin and ceased to torment him. Cash fras chivalrous enough to see his great age should at least pro tect him from insult A couple of hours later silence and sleep was or dered, and soon the inmates of Apsley Farm were either slumbering or trying to do so. Each outlaw took a turn on guard and the night passed without in cident. Cash was in no hurry to leave his comfortable quarters, and decided to remain anoither night on the farm, as he had stated. The convicts did not fear pursuit for several days longer, and their disposition was to tempt attack rather than run away from it Indeed, the three men intended to have a short life — for they looked upon that as in evitable — and to make it as merry as possible They did not care to live like wild beasts hnnted from one covert to another and suffering priva tions and dangers. During the day the outlaws held high rereL Those of the servants who could sing or dance were cempelled to do so, though the compulsion was not of a severe nature. Apsley, of course, was not asked to take part in this on ac count of his age, but a careful watch was kept on him. . The old man spent the time wander ing around, and- often going to the front door, he would gaze long and earnestly in the direction where Oat lands lays as if he hoped tor succor from that quarter. He had beard of the desperate character of Cash and his comrades, and knew they were quite ready to fight a company of soldiers, as they had done, and that fact occasioned Apsley not a little uneasiness. As evening drew on die . same pre parations as were made on the previous night were carried out During the day the outlaws had possessed them selves of all the money which was in place. This amounted to £64. They had also secured the most valuable of the firearms and additional ammuni tion. A bullet-mould was also taken, their own having been lost Cash decided to take the first watch himself, and this began shortly after nine o'clock— early to bed and early to rise being a maxim practised in Van Dieman's Land in those days bj the settlers. The large room where die employees were kept captive was, as already stated, a wipg of the home stead, and from its door a good view could be obtained around. Before ten o'clock the whole house hold was apparently asleep, and the guard passed most of his time walking to and fro just outside the room and in front of the house, taking an . occa sional look into the apartment to see that all was well. It was while thus engaged shortly after ten o'clock that the silence of the night, which was almost . oppressive, in 1 its intensity, was suddenly broken by : the deep baying of a dog close at band. The sound appeared to come from the vicinity of the demolished kennels, and the grim warning did not fall unheeded on the acute ears of Cash. Going into the room, he called up Jones. Kavanagh was already sitting up, the sound having awakened him, j and old Apsley was also very wide | awake and . pot able to copeeal-JigM agitation, t&oagh; & outlaws fH tojjt j notMxlr.bc&gtOtlpnnse; engtrai $ *' Tbtre b '^ottteming the matter, Jones. We could not have killed all the dogs. There is one outside now, unless' — and Cash laughed, queerly — ! ' it is a ghost of otoe of ihe brutes we j killed.' i 'Dogs!' repeated Jones, jumping up. ' Then there is someihing wrong,' — and he seized his weapons--' Young j Apsley must have returned, and we'll | have to be careful.' j The three tjien were now very wide awake and fully armed — indeed.almost overarm ed. Each ftad four pistols and J two muskets,- besides a sort of cutlass. Going to the door, they were speedily convinced there was something wrong as the commotion, at the late kennels was considerable. There mtist have' been several dogs, by the CQiae^ahd no ; doubt they had human comrades irith them. The night was very dark, and Cash expressed his intention of going to the west side of the house to try and really ascertain what was the matter. Jones advised him Dot tods so 00 account of the dogs, but the outlaw chief only laughed at his fears. Kavanagh remained at the outside door, while Jones 'kept ; guard' Over those inside and rather anxiously awaited the leadet& return.

Dropping the firearms, Cash drew the cutlass and began to slash the brute. . This was a wise act and pro bably saved his .life. Using all his immense strength, a few cuts of the weapon — one of which half severed its body — laid it dying on the ground, and not a moment too soon. He had scaitxly time to draw a pistol when an other hound was upon him, but this time his shot was lucky and laid it low. {lO. BE CONTINUED.)
