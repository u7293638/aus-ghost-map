THE DEATH OF KINGS RICHARD IL, in the play of that name, dis- heartened by his calamities, responds to ali the encouraging words of nis lords and fol- lowers with a bitter satire on the wretched- ness of royalty : For God's sake, let me sit upon the ground, And tell sad etorieß of the death of kings : How some hare been depos'd ; some Slain in wai' ; Some haunted by the ghosts they have depos'd ; Some rcoieon'd by their wives ; some sleeping kül'd; All murder'd ; for within the hollow crown That rounds the mortal temples of a king Keeps Death his court. The unhappy monarch was destined to furnish in his own tragic fate one more illus- tration of his homily. His words came vividly to his mind in reviewing the curious catalogue which a European statistician lately furnished of the number of sovereigns who have perished by violent deaths, or been dis- crowned by disaster. The list, which must perforce to incomplete, embraces 2,540 em- perors or kings, who have ruled over 64 natioys. Of these, 299 were dethroned, 151 were assassinated, 123 died in captivity, 108 were formally condemned and executed, 100 were killed in battle, 64 abdicated, 62 were poisoned, 25 died the death of martyrs, 20 committed suicide, and ll died insane. Even these lists do not probably include all the unnatural deaths and dethronements that have occurred among the 2,540 rulers thus tabu- lated, for it was often deemed politic to con- ceal the circumstances of a monarch's death, and history mentions many such instances in which the cause of death is doubtful ; 6o that, for example, the ll insane and the 20 suicides, and the 62 poisoned doubtless do not comprise the whole number of deaths which ought to be included under those descriptions. Nevertheless, taking these figures as they are, they furnish a striking comment on King Richard's melancholy words, which, by the way, Richard's own conquerer and successor almost paralleled in his lamentations over the anxieties and perils that encompass the kingly state. We may add that the death of Napoleon III. at Chiselhurst has now, by one more name, increased the number of sove- reigns dying in exile, while giving the whole subject a fresh interest.-Lippincott's Maga- zine.
