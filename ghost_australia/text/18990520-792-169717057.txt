DIOCESE OF SANDHURST. (From our own Correspondent.) The novena in honour of the Holy Ghost was continued during the week, when the exercises were devoutly attended by large numbers of the congregation. The 11 o'clock Mass on Sunday last was celebrated by the Rev. Fr. O'Carroll, and the sermon was preached by the coadjutor-Bishop, who delivered an able discourse on devotion to the Holy Ghost. The Rev. Fr. Moore officiated in the evening at Vespers, when there was a procession of the Children of Mary, a very large number of the members taking part under the direction of their spiritual director, Rev. Fr. Crane. TATVBA. It is announced in our advertising columns that the art-union in aid of the funds of the Tatura Church will be drawn in the Mechanics' Hall on Monday evening, 3rd July, at 9 p.m. The esteemed pastor (Rev. T. J. O'Connell) requests that friends who have disposed of tickets will kindly return blocks and remittances before the day appointed for the drawing.
