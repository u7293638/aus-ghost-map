AN IBATE FOET. Novor, since tho days of Pope and Donnia, has anytliing quite so savage appeared in literature as Mr. Robert Browning's httlo odo, "To Edward Fitzgondd," published m tho last Athcnmnn. Mr. Aldis Wright, m hifl "Life uud Letters" of tlio translator of Omar Khayyam, had most incautiously admitted a. hasty scntonco of tho genial " fritz," which ran: —"Mrs. Browning's death is rather a relief to mo, 1 must Bay: no more Aurora Leighfl, thank God! A woman oi real genius, I Jmow; hut whut is tlio umliot of it all! She and hor sex had better mind tlio kitchon and tho children; and perlidpfl tho poor. . Except in such things as little novels, they only dovoto themselves to what men do much better, leaving that which men do worso or not at all." Mr. Browniug, it seems, lighted on this unlucky passage—nover, of course, meant for tho public oyo—and blazed forth into the subjoined volcanic verses:— T<) EOWAUP FLT7.1TUAI.D- I chanced upou u new book ycsU-rOay; I opened it, und, \rhcro my Ungcr lay •l'ttixt poKe and uncut pagij, tlicse word-i I read—« Some nix or uo\\-en at most-and learned Uiercby That you, Fitztjenild, vrhom hy car and eye Bhe never know," thank God iny v?ifc ICieldng you s< lot of c While more appropriate lends yo Surely to unit there glorOlm your face— Spitting from lips once sauutilied by hers. July S, 1889. ROOKUT DNOWKINO- Tantanc animis ! Should a great poot thus, for a frotfnl phrase, avengo tho dead upon the dead, by telling him who was tlio "beBt friend " of Lord Tennyson, and author, in tho way of translation, of tho "one thing dono divinely well," that his ghost is not good enough tb spit at? Mr. Aldis Wright has certainly much to answer for.
