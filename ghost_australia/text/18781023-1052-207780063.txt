.u; MACBETH. Mr. Thomas Kenny, a clever, essay ist, and who has written most abiy on the subject of " Macbeth," character ises it as " a drama of gigantic crime and terror relieved by the most mag nificent imaginative expression," yet marked with great simplicity of general I design. The date of the production of the piece is set by Furnival at 1605-6, I and " we may trdce it for granted," says Kenny, "that it was written in the time of James the First, who I ascended the throne March, 1603, as it contains an evident allusion to that monarch in act iv. scene i, and also a I complimentary reference to him in an other part. The material for the play was found by Shakespeare in Holin- i shed's History of Scotland, where the story of Macbeth is told at page 168." ' The Macbeth and Duncan are repre- ) sented to have been cousins ; the first a valiant gentleman but of cruel dispo- ' sition, and the latter " so soft and ) gentle in his nature that the people wished the inclination and manners of ) the two to have been so tempered and ' \ interchangeably sliared' betwi.xt tkem that where the one had too much of ) clemency and tlie other of cruelty, tlie V main virtue belween these two extre mities might have reigned by indiffer- ) ent partition in them both. Tlie play V all along keeps close to the line of ' Holinshed, varying from it in scarcely ) any particular except in the non- . appearance in the banquet scene of the ' murdered Banquo's ghost." ) This tragedy lias been presented in . Melbourne we believe oftener than any ' other of Shakespeare's work's. ' The late G. V. Brooke, Charles Kean, k Charles Vincent, in their time essayed r the part, and we have had other repre- sentativcs, from the burly McKean . Buchanan and James Anderson to the ? little dapper J; B. Howe. But few \ artists have made their Melbourne dehut in the r6le of the Thane of CaW' ) dor. Of those who have, we now call \ to mind Mr. C. W.
