''ÍHE KBLIGI0Ü8 AWAKENING MOVE- MENT IN GREAT BRITAIN." The second meeting of the series of three, to re. ceive inform tttoa respecting this movement, wag held in the Presbyterian Church, Free Church stieet West Maitland, on Monday evemtg last There WP¿ a good attendance, comprised of adherents of vanous churches in the town. Tht proceedm ;s were begun by the singing of a hj mu, reading a portion of Scripture, and piay er The Rev. JAMES BENVTK (pastor of the church) desired to remind them m the fiist place of a certain doctrine. They should not forget that according to the word of God and the doctrine ot that word, God is a worker in His church. It was God who drew the sinner to Himself. In the second place he de aired to remind them that m such movements as are now going on in Scotland, that doctrine becomes a fact. It w as a great fact that God was a worker, build- ing up the church, and gathenng into that church those who were in their sin». That was actually the case in theconveruon of every sinner. If they found among themselves one who had been conveited to God, that conversion was dun to the power of God, and it was the same work and the same power and the same grace, and the same hand, that converts hundreds and thousands. Thirdly thej would find that when God is thus prominently showing Himself a great worker in his church, there was in it a call of Providence to all who hear of it, that thev may be stirred up to seek similar manifestations for themselves and others. And m the fourth place, bj such movements as that referred to, the world is taught this great lesson that Christianity does not depend upon the mere force of truth, or upon the power of reason, or the earnestness of persuasion, but upon the power of God. The last observation he had to make was that such movements teach men and churches the daring impietj, the gin, and the folly of claiming lor themselves and their ministrations the exclusive favor of God. For they saw that in those movements God made lise of those who did not arrogue to themselves the exclusive function of dispensing His grace. He would now draw their attention to the present work of God in Scotland, confining his attention to one part of Scotland, namelj Glasgow He would only say, in reference to what he h id »old them last Wed- nesday, that according to the latest intelligence the work of God in Edinburgh was as productive of the salvation of souls as at the beginning There w is not the Bame outward appear ince of the work. They had had the first nianing showers of divine grace, and now that grace, so to speak, w as scattered over all the churches ni Edinburgh. The work, in- stead of decreasing and weakening, was gaming in strength, although the work had been going on for five month» He would now refer to Glasgow. But for the sake of dee) ening the impression he desired to make upon their minds, and fur the sake also of bringing pro- minently forward what should never be forgotten that in connection with every great revival there was always a vast amount of prayer,-he would draw their attention to what had taken place in the neigh- bourhood of Glasgow in 1742 Theie was a small parish, distant about five miles from Glasgow, called Cambuslang. The minister of this parish was named Mcculloch. The people bad become dead in spiritual matters, and he encouraged them to unite themselves in ussociauous for prajer and for reading the word of God. Seven or eight associations were thus started, and they met weekly. Mr. Mcculloch encouraged them to pray for a revival of religion not only m Cambuslang, but everywhere. Things went on m this way for a year or two About that time (1741) Whitfield and Wesley made their appearance, and a great work of God was earned on under them. The minister of Cambuslang took great delight m telling his people every Sabbath evening what God was doing in other parts. He told them that God was reviving His work elsewhere. On a Monday evening in 1742, the several societies met together for one general prayermeeting They found, after continuing for some time in prayer, that they were full of the spirit of prayer, and they lesolved to meet on Tuesdiy ev ening T' ey did so in larger numbers, and were encouraged to meet again the third ev enmg, when still greater numbers assembled There was a larger measure of prayer and pe ice and holy joy. They remained in prayer for a large por- tion of the night, and on Thursday, when a usual service took place, fifty souls exhibited great distress of mind, and the minister had to stay up nearly the whole night conversing with these distressed 8 ul8 TI is was the beginning of a great revival, which spread over Scotland There were daily services m the church at Cambuslang a daily increase of anxious inquirers, and other ministers had to come to the help of Mr II tulloch The result of the movement at Cambuslang was that in five months, upon the most careful and honest computation, five hundred souls had been converted Mr M'Culloch, a conscientious man, bad st-uck off his list all who hld been converted merely by fear of hell, and included only those who had a certain hope His audience increised to ten or twelve thousand people h« preached to them on the hillside Sabbath after sabbath t«n thous ind people assembled to listen to the Word of life Then came communion, and Whitfield came \t the first com muston, three months after the beginning of the revi- val, on a Saturday, 20000 people listened to the preaching of the gospel Next day 30,000 people listened The numbers subsequently increased to 40,000, and thousands sat down to the table of the Lord. Thus began a work m the neighbourhood of Glasgow which spread through Scotland, and helped to keep alive the light of iruth in the midst of a dark and declining age And now, in the pre- sent day, the West of Scotland had been speci illy favoured of God That fact taught them that there were in that place many praying sjuls who had been born agam When they found religion declin- ing they prayed for its revivil He had the reports of nine days' proceedings there-reports extracted from the ordinary newspapers, and extending from the sixth of February to the fourth of \pril They were not selected as specially favourable but taken as the only information available They extended over nearly two months, and he had no doubt that, if they could get a daily repirt, instead ot a report of nine days ia the two months, it would be equally satisfactory [The speaker proceeded to read the extracts of which he had spoken They referred to the lar^e «ttendinces, the deep and solemn earnestness at, and the h ippy resulta follow- ing from, the mid-day prayer meetings, described the course of proceeding at the meetings, and sketched the reports made by speakers respecting the work in other parts of Scotland They spoke of boy s b iv mg been impressed, and of the widespread effect of the revival among young people generally It was specially mentioned th it there was no excitement in the meetings, and that all classes of persons joined ia them Reference was made to a requisition signed by two hundred ministers in Glasgow, requesting prayers all over Scotland for the young men of Glasgow j He went on The work was spreading everywhere in Scotland The results of the movement in Glasgow were visible even in the streets The streets were quieter, the people were evidently deeply impressed with the great concerns that belong to then- souls He thought he was safe in say ing that there were ten thousand praying people who met every day to send up a cloud of prayer asking the Lord to revive His Church, and a still greater number collected in the churches m the evenings, to listen with breathless Bnxiety to the pure and simple message of the word of God. He could give high autbonty for the genuineness of the work The highest men in Scot- land were not ashamed to confess Christ Landed proprietors, medical men, and barristers confessed Christ and preached His word The speaker concluded by quoting largely from a speech by Lord Ardmillan, one of the Scottish law lords, who spoke of the movement as a wonderful one, in which men ? hearts had been greatly stirred by the Lord Prayer was then offered, and a hymn sung The Rev G LANE thought the words ot Peter upon the Mount of Transfiguration might be well applied there ' It is good for us to be here " He was thinking during the latter part of Mr Benvie s address that if the desire of his heart could be ful- filled, instead of the time being taken up by his words, it would be much better occupied if they and he could join in a talk to that God WHO h id so gra ciously poured out His blessed Spirit upop the Churches of then- fatherland They had he ird of the work of G )d in Scotland It was one of the peculi- arities of the movement tint it had been most pow- erful and widely felt in Scotland At the same time in England God was re viv mg His work and pouring out His Spirit upon the Churches of various denominations It was worth observing that just at the same time the Church of Eng- land had organised a twelve daya mis«ion in London Some of the most earnest and eloquent and devoted ministers of the Church were sum- moned from their charges m the country to come to London, to assist those in London who felt a de 8ire for the good of the people and the glory of Goa. Although in that church there were some n tuahstic manifestations which were not «atisfactory, yet there bad also been e truest ami successful efiorio made to extend the cause of Christ In some of the churches, continuous services bad been held from eight o'clock in the morning till midnight Persons of the lowest class had been reiched in that wav who could have been reached in no other way They had been attracted by the fame of the preacher, or induced to comem bv the efforts of godly laymen and godly women who had undertaken the duty There were no statistics of conversion«, but they might justly conclude that many souls have been brought from the kingdom of Satan to the kingdom of Christ, and that God had honored His servants 1 ibours In re- ference to the Wesleyan Church, many circumstances in England had tended to show that God had owned the labours of His semnts too In Ludlow, for thirty years, there had been no revival, but at the time of this Scottish revival one hundred and fifty persons had found the Saviour \t Luton, m Corn- wall, in lorksbire, in Reading and m Sunderland similar manifestations of Gods grace were appa- rent. And it was remarkable that much of the work had resulted from the labours of de- voted laymen, who hid gone forth, denying themselves, and proclaiming the simple message of mercy In homely Saxon ou* anointed bv the power of the Holy Ghost, they proclaimed the Gospel of Christ, the love of God, and the salvation of souls. At Kingswood School, a school dev oted to the educa- tion of the sons of Wesley an mmisttrs, three bojs had found the Saviour, and wrote to saj what God had done for them. In Vtucrica such revival move- ments were expected, more than Englishmen ex- pected them. Men there believe that they can use scnptural means for the promotion of the work of God in accord ince with His wil1. Thus in America revival movements were frequent and mighty. The minister of a Church there who had written about tiieae revivals, told us that there is scarcely a city, a town, or a village in the whole of the Northern States, which bad not been at some penod of its history moved to its very centre by some glorious work of God. [ After quoting a brilliant apostrophe of Talmage, praying for a general revival over the whole land, the speaker proceeded. J Thej should pray for a revival now among people and among ministers Thej should stir each other to holj excitement, ze ii, and self demal. [The speaker read fro tn the CongregationaJut an account of the work of Messrs. Moodj and Sankey in Newcostle-on-Tjne, where three meetings in a day were held-prayer meetings, at which the requests of the people for the salvation of then friends and relatives were offered up-special meetings for worship, and other meetings, resulting in provoking anxious mquirj- from hundreds, and in adding souls to the Church. The extract also showed how the movement spread to the neigh- bouring Tillages, how special mechanics' meetings ' wtie held, how preaching took place duiuii, tie dinner hour at the faetones andhiw the ordinary scrv ices at the churches were supplemented gener illy bv new agencies tending much to render the mini tere work more easy ] Such inf inca ion was suth cient to stir then heirta with a strong desire tint God w uld íevive His church in the colonj and in Maitland There was hope that He would do so if tin priven of His people went up before llim in faith and not doubting He read an extract from a letter from the Rev Air M Rae a minister who hal once been stationed in the colonv and oskel what was to be the issue of the present meetings The ministers had been stirred up to hold them The people had been stirred up to attend them Should they in the colonj ask for a God sent rev iv il ° None could more dislike or shrink from a man nade revival than he did But the work in Scotland wns God s work God lives His Gospel is still alive an 1 had power in the church and m the world T! ey wanted that GoBpel to exert its power among them He prayed that God would bless that meeting A pray er was offered, and The Rev R T HILLS addressed the meeting He said that they should be satisfied that God was as really present acting upon mens souls as He was present in rcatenol nature He wanted them to realise that evening that God was the loving Sovereign oí the Universe ever acting according to law That there were laws in grace just as there were laws in nature an 1 th it they were as universal as certain and as unfailing asanj of the laws of nature Everyone thataskoth receiveth" was one of those laws of grace Thej had heard of God s action in Se tland and m England it was the result of the law he had mentioned There had been an asking on the part of God s people and an answer from God Now, that they might act in harmony with the law of grace a promise was given to them for their encouragement, and for their guidance It was contained in the 19th verse of the l8 h chapter of Matthew and related to the answer to be given bj God to nnj requ ct | respecting whi h anj two should n"ree Well were thej not agreed us to their need of an out pou mg of Gods Spirit upon themselves thtir funilie0 their churches the town anl'he colonj Mich as thej had never seen before 9 A\ ert ihej n t agreed that God could give that Spmt * AVere thej not agreed that it was His will to giv e it9 AA ero thej not agreed that He would give it if asktd for in accordance with His teachings ° And were thej n t agreed that th y would ask ' He di 1 not know that it was necessarj for them to be agreed on more than those five points They should then ask in faith, earncstlj in Christ s name, and submitting themselves to God Ho urged them to ask, in full expectation that God would grane what thej asked Thej should believe that as thej prayed their pray er was answered The speaker concluded with an earnest exbortution to the undecided to declare for Christ, and to supplicate His spirit for themselves V hymn was sung The Rev J G MACDOUGALL said he was sure they had all heard of the revival of God s work in Britain with feelings of profound thankfulness Such feelings were naturally awakened in the he irts of all who loved the Lord Jesus Christ and d sired to promote His glorj He felt thankful that God h d so manifestly made his power known and his inn bare in cirrjing on His work in Scotland and else where He was gratified to see that night so manj belonging to different denominations uniting heartily in he ring ot this work, and in endeavourin to promote it in their own midst It was verj gra tifjing to him to know that although holding different opinions, and belonging to different organizations, thej could heartily join in de- siring a pure and undehled revival of religion among them They were all clear that what God had done elsewhere he was willing to do for them. God was no respecter of persons Among all people those who fear and love Him shall be blessed of Him He had seen a letter that day dated from Hill End, and it glowed with revival zeal while it related the display of the power of God there All that God had done in Scotland Ue was willing to do in Maitland They should not come together only to hear about these things, but to have enkindled m their hearts a warm love to God and a fervent desire for the out pounng of His Spent, so that they might share in those good things themselves At Hill End thej had united meetings the Church of England the Presbyterian, and the Wesleyau ministers united and with their congregations were holding meetings every night The result was that God had poured out His Spirit, some had been conveitad, and God was still carry mg on the work The whole history of the Church had proved that God waa able to bring about the simultaneous conversion of many sinners and to greatly quicken the Church But a revival took place by the use of appointed means, and bv the {employment of such means the Church might expect to be revived The means were not extra ordinary or unusual, they were just the ordinary laws that regulated God's action-ordinary laws of cause and effect The cause for the revival being given, the effect was sure to follow Sio emotional transports were necessary- what was wanted was not to raise themselves to God, but to bring God down upon them And what were the means which they should use to secure a revival in Maitland5 They should regard it ag a personal question, and endeavour each and all to assist m the advance- ment of Christ's kingdom All great revivals had been started by a few earneat souls, from the Day of Pentecost downwards to the present time A faithful few had resolved to pleid with God, let them do that and they would bave a revival For they must, first of all, have a spirit of pray er-pray er general, far reaching, all embracing then there must be an earnest searching into God s Word to discover the promises that encourage and the examples that instruct, then a deep searching into their own hearts for any influences which might hinder the work-a searching with a desire to sanc- tify themselves, then they must attend the preich mg of the Word, and specially seek the outpouring ol the Holy Spirit m connection with the i ublication of the Gospel, they must speak to others, und lastly, they must hold meetings together wherever it couldconveniently be done-cottage pray er meetings -to supplicate God fora revival of His work He urged them, therefore, in consideration of the need for it, to ask by the means he had mdic ited for a revival m this town, and concluded by expressing an opinion that this is a glorious time for the whole Christian Church The proceedings closed with pray er and the bene- diction, pronounced by the Rev G LANI.
