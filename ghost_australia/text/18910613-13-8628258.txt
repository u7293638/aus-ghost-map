SATURDAY, JUNE 13, 1391. m Major-General Tulloch, promised paper on the defences of Australia will be read, whenever it appears, with a great deal of interest, inasmuch as the Victorian commandant has now made a survey of the scene, and a high opinion has been formed of his judgment. In the meantime, it may be noted that a, great deal has recently been said about one portion of Australian defences by Major G. L. Clarke, B.E., in his volume on "Fortifications," which is accepted by the profession as a standard work. One point only is dealt with by the writer, but it is one that closely concerns the colonies, inasmuch as it is the present relative positions of ships and coast batteries. And the remarks made are reasonable and suggestive Distant ports, such as those of Australia, can only be attacked,. Major CALLER says, by ocean-going cruisers. The great line-of-battle ships built by the naval powers are for Channel or for Mediterranean purposes, their consump- tion of coal alone prohibiting them from rushing about on voyages round the world. It is unnecessary, therefore, for us to consider how the great ironclads of the first class would fare in action with coast batteries. This is a problem to which attention may have to be given in Europe, where the coast can be patrolled and searched by these vessels, but across the ocean we have to reckon at the worst merely with the " protected cruisers," which have been built for service on the high seas. These are the highest type of vessels that can operate on the Australian coast, and Major Clarkvj inquires, with great detail, what their prospects are. Evolution, he says, has compelled the ship-builders to give more and more attention to protecting the so-called "vitals" of the vessel. Boilers, on gines, and steering gear are the parts looked after in the protected cruiser, because the ship must be kept under command for raining purposes, either to run or to avoid being rammed. The cruisers must necessarily be built to fight each other, and a splendid vessel has been produced for sea service, capable of long journeys at a high speed, and with great fighting power. In the best class of these ships the armoured belts and the 6-inch to 9-inch bulkheads may render it a difficult task for guns to sink them, but it is not necessary to accomplish this end. The weak point is that while the modern coast battery provides a nearly absolute protection for the defenders, the cruiser necessarily exposes the greater part of her men. The Nelson and the Northampton are taken as the finest examples of the cruiser in the British navy. Fighting end on, these vessels would each have two guns protected, thoughs 6-inch gun at 2,000 yards should make short work of their armour, but nine-tenths of their broadside is unprotected. The crews being fully exposed, the batteries would not concern themselves with the protected parts, but would employ common shell, which must speedily convert the ships into slaughter- houses. Except for a great and definite end it would be criminal, Major Clarke holds, the pit the Nelson, the Imperieuse, or the Warspite, or any of the British cruisers, against efficient coast defences. Their mission must be to keep the seas, and not to fight with defences ashore. The French vessels are held to be decidedly less fit for coast actions than our own. The latest and the best of the French cruisers is the Cecile, which relies on one armoured deck to protect her vitals, these being kept below the water-line as much as possible. Such a vessel has her own sphere as a raider, but we are told she could not engage properly handled coast defences without losing the greater part of her crew in the course of a few minutes. A crew, it must be remembered, cannot live under shell fire. Only nine pro- jectiles were received on board the Huascar in her action, but more than a third of the crew were killed and wounded and this must be the fate of all ships which can be hit and penetrated. The Russian cruisers are quickly disposed of by the writer. The only Russian vessel which has protection for her guns is the H'cúchimoff, now on the China station, and available, of course, for an Australian today. She is in many respects a splendid vessel, but she presents a large unarmoured side target, and she has no main deck bulkheads to prevent her being raked and even in a short action, with well mounted and well served guns on shore, she must suffer severely. -The fact that an alarm was created in Australia by the appearance in these waters of the armed merchant- men of the Russian volunteer fleet, which could have been sent to the bottom by our field artillery, greatly amuses Major Clarke, who more than once pokes fun at Australian sales. That any effort will be made to bom- bard large Australian cities Major Clarke holds to be most unlikely. The quantity of ammunition a vessel can carry is small, and it must be reserved for far more practical purposes. The position of a vessel or a squadron short of ammunition, with damaged hulls, and remote from any depot, is not one which any naval commander would care to occupy. Incidentally the writer points out that it is only now that the experts are beginning to apply the lesson to be derived from the Sebastopol experience. On the opening day of the bombard- ment the British and French fleets went into action, but the ships were so severely handled by two little batteries called the " Wasp " and " Telegraph " batteries, perched on heights which the ships' guns could not reach that the " experiment was not reported. When, as in this Sebastopol case, the battery can obtain a plunging fire the advantage is enormous. Given a height of 150 feet, says Major Clarke, and you can afford to mount the guns en barbette, for no ship will' ever hit them and this is a view which has been adopted by the commission appointed' to deal with the federal defences at Thursday Island and King George's Sound. If it had been, applied earlier here, the saving in connection with the great guns on the Nepean Point would have been very great, though of course not much harm is done by obtaining a better article than is actually needed. The error is on the right side. This dictum, it is to be noted, greatly strengthens the conten- tion that there should be a torpedo line between the Pope's Eye and the Nepean coast. Major Clarke would certainly cast his vote in favour of detaining the foe under the plunging fire from the Nepean works, 170 feet in height, rather than allow them to go on to the low- level fire of the Swan Island battery or the South Channel fort ; so that General Tulloch has here a powerful supporter for the view he holds on this subject. About, defences it may be said I, so many experts so many opinions. But there is considerable comfort in the proposi- tion which Major Clarice maintains that the war ship of the present day is necessarily built and armed to fight other ships at sea, and that in the development of ship-building and the progress of ship-power the ship grows steadily less fitted for engaging properly planned and properly manned defences ashore. The writer's theory, it may be mentioned, is strongly supported by the circumstance that the Chilian ironclad, the Blanco Encalada, and her consorts were driven out of action so soon as they tried conclusions with the batteries at Valparaiso. A plunging shot struck one of the vessels, ripping up her dock, disabling a gun, and destroying seventeen men, and after this warning the ship lost no time in getting out of range. Indeed, though Major Clarke seems to believe that ships could at one time fight batteries with success, it is to be noted that Collingwood, Nelson, and Napier preferred in turn to warily blockade the French and Russian works rather than attack them. Mr. Patterson evidently does not believe that comparisons are odious. He would probably be more inclined to adopt Mrs. Partington's view of them as " odorous," which, indeed, they not infrequently are, if you understand the Partingtonian term in its strictly figurative sense. Lord Palmerston, if we remember aright, declared that English statesmen live and work in glass houses, and it is consequently by no means surprising that a curious public stations its features with enthusiastic persistency against the panes thereof. The transparency is just sufficient to enable a good deal to be seen, and, after the fashion of the modern society journal, a vast amount more to be imagined. True, the inner workings of the political system at home are pretty completely in the shade, and one has to await such Siftings of the curtain its the issue, for instance, of the Malmesbury Memoirs before the Parliamentary holy of holies lies exposed to the vulgar gaze. Nevertheless the keen-sighted men of the day, Mr. Patterson included, can por coive enough to criticise by, and criticise and compare they must and will accordingly. If it be true that onlookers see most of the fray, a colonist's observations ought to go somewhat beneath the surface of prejudice and get near the bottom of the deep well of truth. Whether Mr. Patterson has succeeded in this respect or not, it is, at any rate, satisfactory to find not only that a Victorian legislator thought the personality of Imperial statesmen a topic of current interest, but that his constituents were of like opinion With the member for Castlemaine a idea of the Prime Minister nobody) could have the heart to quarrel If the Marquis i>> not the
