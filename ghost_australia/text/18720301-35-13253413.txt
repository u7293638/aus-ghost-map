"THE LIFE OF CHARLES DICKENS." is No biography has ever taken its readers so much, by surprise as Mr. Forster's life of Dickens. That early observation must have supplied Dickens with a great part of his wonderful knowledge of that struggling poverty which, SB Mr. Forster truly says, " is nowhere more vividly shown than in the commoner streets of the ordinary London suburb," was plain. That he had introduced more recollections of his own life into " David Copperfield" than into any other of his books was plain also. But the most careful and sympathising reader of this novel could not have guessed that the two most striking chapters in it were a mere extract from an unfinished autobiography written long before the fancy of " David Copperfield had even " begun to take shape in his mind," Considered in connection with the first and second chapters of Mr Forster's life, these two chapters stand alone in literature They are re- markable for the restrained passion which runs through them, for the wonderful keenness of insight which are really stored up the materials for the retentiveness which could recall every memorandum made on the mind of a murderer for the passionate self commiseration which underlies even the most hun mous passages They supply the foundation of parts of almost every book he has written Ibcyniioto excite the lumU by which his genius was marked off on alludes They show that Dickens was never at his best except when describing scenes and characters which he had seen in his earliest childhood, or on which his childish fancy had been exercised The same ixixriehoecoiild not have had the same results if it had come any earlier or later in his life if his father had been in the Marshalsea at the timo~6f"riis"8on'8 hirth Dickens would not have had the same BOIS of having fallen from something better and in losing this, he would have lost that insight into the poverty he describes, which while it requires absolute acquaintance with the thing die' cribed, requires also an external stand point from which to survey it to men born in rugs as to him burn in purple their surroundings come too naturally to make much in price ion on them. If his father had kept out of the Marshalsea two or three years longer, Dickens would never have had the same hopelessness of conviction that he was never to rise from the degradation be so loathed and resented, and so would have been less open to the impression it made upon him. The iron that st in aid his memory with every particular of the old house at Hungerford stairs was, and needed to be, on iron that had firm entered into his soul It is a noticeable feature in this fragment of autobiography that whatever it differs from the version of it published in " David Copp and, it differs from it by buying more wrought up Most men having thus to deal with a chapter from their own life would have found it necessary to dress it in more vivid colours, to make the feeling more intense, to strive to excite in the readers need a stronger sympathy for the hero of the novel than could be created by unvarnished facts Dickens felt no such need Wherever the autobiography and the novel part company it is by reason of omissions or softenings down in the novel It is worth while to compare a few passages This is David Copperfield speaking : "It is a matter of some surprise to me even now that I can have been so easily thrown away at such an a/to A child of excellent abilities, and with strong powers of observation, quick, eager, delicate, and soon hurt, bodily or mentally, it Euems wor derful to me that no one should have made any BIJOU on my behalf This is the autobiography - ' It is wonderful to me how I could have been so easily cast away at Buchan ago It is wonderful to me that even after my descent into the poor little drudge I had been since we came to London, no one had compassion enough on me-a child of singular abilities, quick, eager, delicate, and soon hurt, bodily or mentally to suggest that something might have been spared, as certainly it might have been, to place me at any common school . My father and mother wore quite satisfied They could hardly have been more so if I had been twenty years of age, distinguished at a grammar school, and going to Cambridge ' ' Or take the sentence in which David Copperfield do Benlee his loneliness ' From Monday morning to Saturday night I had no advice, no counsel, no encouragement no consolation, no assistance, no support of any kind from any one that I can call to mind, as I hope to go to heaven ' and compare with it the parallel sentences in the autobiography 'I suppose my bidding was paid for by my father I certainly did not pay it myself, and I oar to only had no other assistance whatever (the making of lay eli thes, I think, excepted), from Monday morning until Saturday night No name no counsel, no encouragement, no consolation, no support, from anyone that I can call to mind, so help me God Again, in David Copperfield, the chapters which deal with his life at Murdstone and Grimsby s are thus introduced -' 1 now approach to a period of my life which can never lose the remember race of while I remember anything and the recollection of which has often, without UIJ invocation, coma before like a ghost, and haunted happier times This retains the purport of the corresponding paragraph in the autobiography, but the details given in the litter convey a far stronger impression of the extremity of horror which the recollection always wakened in him - "Until old Hungerford Market was pulled down, until old Hungerford stairs were destroyed, and the very nature of the ground changed, I never had the courage to go back to the place where my servitude began Inovorsiwit I could not endure to go near it for many years when I came to Robert Warren s in the Strand [the civil blacking warehouse] 1 crossed over to the opposite side of the way to avoid a certain smell of the cement they put upon the Blinking corks, which reminded me of what I was once It was a very long time before I liked to go up Chandos Street My old way home by the Borough made me cry after my oldest child could speak There is something indicative about his compassion for his childish self, something of that overmastering sense of lDiustue which nine men feel when they see present wrong done to others and have no power to help them, but which few retain in regard to wrong done to themselves of which no trace has remained by them. One instance of this is his reference to his mother's wish that he should go back to the blacking warehouse after his father li id quarrelled with the proprietor "My mother set herself to accommodate the quarrel and did so the next day . , My father said I should go back no more, and should go to school I do not write resentfully or angrily, for I know how all these things have helped to make me what I am, but I never afterwards forgot, I never shall forget, I never can forget, that my mother was warm for my being sent back to those who look back at the part played by Mrs Dickens, it seems not ann natural that a woman across forced to difficulties of all kinds, having hut just soon her hutt) ltd set free from a debtor's prison, and probably thinking it quite on the cards that he might soon return thither, should think it unwise to take a boy of twelve from an em ploy ment where he was at East earning 7s a week No doubt if she had known the value of the child she was dealing with she would have judged differently, but r prophets of twelve are even less honoured in their father's house than propho s of riper growth, and some allowance might fairly have been made for her blindness Dickens, as we have seen can make none His relations to his father are another illustration of the same thing that the cider Dickens was, in any sense of the word, a good father no one will believe His son probably presented him in the best possible light when he said to Mr. Forster, " Everything that I can remember of his conduct to his wife, or children, or friends, in sickness or affliction, is bayonet all praise But the care which was present when the objects of it were sick or sorry was wanting when they were well His description of his son s education-" Why, indeed, sir, ha' ha-ha maybe said to have educated yourself was strictly true Still this is hardly enough to explain the use his son made of him in fiction Mr. Micawber is not an unamiable person, indeed the reader contracts by degrees a considerable affection for him of a certain kind But, according to prevalent ideas, his is scarcely the portrait a s n would like to hand down as a life study of a father Yet this is what Dickens has done. ' The interval between the sponging house and the priSon says Mr Forster, was passed by the sorrowful lad in running errands and carrying messages for the prisoner delivered with swollen eyes and through shining tears and the last words said to him by his father before he WAS finally learned to the Marshalsea were to the effect that the sun had set upon him for over ' I really believed at the time, said Dickens to me, that they had broken my heart ' He took afterwards ample revenge for this false alarm by making all the world laugh at them in " David Copper Field Certainly the revenge was ample, but the sorrowful lad ' delivering his messages " with sorrowful eyes and through shining tears,' IB a more engaging picture than the same lad sitting down in his famous and successful manhood to move thousands of expectant readers to laughter by the narrative of his father's weaknesses. Miiawbers reception of David on his first visit to the prison gives one a different impression when we read it in the autobiography thus -"My father was waiting for me in the lodge and he went up to his room for the top story but one) and cried very much And he told me, I remember, to take warning by the Marshalsea, and to observe that if a man had £20 a year, and spent £19 19s 6d , he would be happy, but that a shilling spent the other way would make him wretched " If his father had no hand in sending him to the blacking warehouse, it may be questioned whether Micawber would ever have been created, except in a few fragment try touches distributed over various characters It may seem ungrateful thus to look so admirable a gift horse in the mouth, but in estimating Dickens's character this side of it cannot be left out of sight in a much smaller way the reproduction of the Dora of his youth as the Flora of " Little Dorrit H another example of the same tendency sTill Mall Gazette HEUHEW NAMES -Biblical names, says the irish Messenger, are frequently " modernized " The custom, we fancy, arises generally from a feeling of false shame, which is certainly culpable, for names of themselves egress nothing, and it is altogether ridiculous to suppose that the change of one or more letters will whiten the moral character or raise one 8 reputation, save among a community of the silliest and most despicable Thus Abraham becomes Braham, Abrahamson, Bramson , Baruch, Barrow, David inst Davidson, Davis and Davison, Elias, Ellis Emanuel, Manuel, Jones, Jones Levi is made to undergo several transformations, appearing successively as Lewis, Levey, Levett, Lieber, Leun, TV hile Lu ison is transmuted into Levison, and Lev iberg uitolavcnberg, Moses is Americanised into Moss, Mosely and at times Morris, Solomon is transformed into Salamon, Salmon, and Sloman Zachanas is changed to incline , Jacob and Jacobson appear as Jacques and Jackson Scriptural names are frequently altered by the insertion or omission of one or more letters, the bearers thereof becoming correspondingly glorified This Aaron and Aaronson blandly beam, upon you as Aron and Aronson , Esther the star, loses all its siginheanco when turned into Estelle , Tve would not know herself as Eva, nor Joseph as Joseph Judah is shortened into Judd, and burst into Sara On the other hand, Bichel is lengthened into Enchnel, and Samson into Sampson
