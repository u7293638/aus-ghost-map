AUSTEALIA AND, THEE END OF ' . '?' THE 'WORLD. ? . ' ' j. -. : ,- ME JAMES . SMITH'S PKOPHECIES. ,. i Most of our readers will have heard of, Mr James Smith, at one. time connected with ! the ' Argus and Australasian, and recognised as one of tho most able literary ? men in Melbourne. Mr Smith has be come a religious enthusiast, and propounds strange doctrines which have occasioned 'considerable ridicule ill the sister colony. The. Melbourne correspondent of- .the South Australian Advertiser seems-to have .been rather- unkind to Mr Smith and his theories' in recent letters, and con sequently that gentleman writes in ex planation the following extraordinary, epistle to our Adelaide contemporary:— j -Sir— So many and much extraordinary misstatements occur in n recent letter from your Melbourne, correspondent that I must ask permission to ' correct them. I have passed through no ' phasG3 of unbelief ;' I am not a' Spiritualist i I belong to no . ;'\French magnetic school,' and have , never, heard of such a school. . I nave no;'dis-., ciples'? or ' followers.' I . propagate no ?'?new belief,' nor thepries,' nor doctrines, iatidiimke no ' Sunday raids,' whatever that' imaymean. So1 far from; Mr ; Farie Mac igeorge being, my',' chief apostle,' I should ihe glad to learn of him, were' it not that we ibotli know that all knowledge that is worth the ik'nowing must come from the Father; that j no man can teach another ; and thnt, in order to be what your correspondent calls' a profound i theologian,'. a person. . mast become a slave 'to the .systems,1 doctrines, creeds, philoso ;phies, or wild speculations; of men, ??- whose: iminas have been killed -byr.-: the letter of the ?Bible, and whose chief occupation appears. to , be that of weaving the. thickest and. darkest iof curtains wherewith'1 to.,:hicle- the r Creator' : froni: His creatures.

' Whatever 'is1' of the ! earth,' earthly, will perish' -with- the: pre jsent shell: of the 'globe.. - All- who. have ' liyed ' for the world, the flesh, ? and ? the ! devil, will be blotted out of existence. To the remnant- of the race— the children of obedience, 'to whom ? Christ communicated the- Holy Spirit when He.iwas on the earth, before — will ,be given . an immortal soul,, that is to say, a portion of the Divine na ture of the tatlier. But this is only, pbs sible,up6h'ohe; conditioninamely^the sur render of self — the animal or human nature —the | carnal . mind, which, is enmity..to Gcid, to be consumed by the sacrificial fire of the Holy Spirit, crucified within' us, just' 'as the h'unian body ; in which: Christ was: ih carnatedi was crucified on the ??cross.,.
