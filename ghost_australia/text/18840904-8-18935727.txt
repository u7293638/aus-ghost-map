MCSWEIX BROOK. Cautiow to Fowi, Bbeedees.-As several daring thefts have been recently perpetrated in our uBually quiet town, and as the thieves ' have hitherto escaped the notice of our vigi- lant Senior-sergeant, I deem it advisable to put your readers on their guard against some disreputable night-prowlers who have been making eevere raids on the poultry of several of our town breeders, On Wednesday night last Mr. Surveyor McDonald, of Brook-street, who is a successful and scientific poultry farmer, was the victim of some accomplished roost-disturbers, who paid a most unceremoni- ous visit to his poultry yard, and skilfully lifted, without the ghost of a cackle, no less than 15 of the moBt admired specimens of his choice collection. As Mr. McDonald is a highly esteemed and much respected resident much sympathy ia felt for him in his almost irreparable loss, and a universal hope is ex- pressed that condign punishment shall speedily overtake the despicable spoilers of a collec- tion which was a source of pride to the owner, and an ornament to this neighbourhood. Weatheb.-We have warm windy days and cool nights, and although the crops look very well at present, the ground is fast drying, and rain is required. September 1st, 1884.
