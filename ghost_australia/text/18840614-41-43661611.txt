WATTLE CULTIVATION. TO THE EDITOR. bur— scarcity of leisure has prevented an earlier reply to the letter on this subject by ' Wattle Blossom.' I may now, however, be permitted to point out that the figures quoted by this correspondent were antici pated, and criticised in my article of May 15. I do not for a moment deny that the profits anticipated by your correspondent might possibly— nay probably— be realized ; but I do assert emphatically tbat in order to realize them a different balance-sheet to thit of the Victorian Wattle Commission must be presented. In order to get the fall value for wattle-bark, this commodity must be sold in London, which involves the presence of more capital in the concern than if the produce be realized on locally. In my article I made one crave omission, viz., a reference to the in feriority of bark grown on limestone subsoil. This, however, would not handicap the in dustry to any great extent until tannic acid in place of the actual bark is recognised as the marketable commodity. I have to-day seen a letter from a wattie-stripp_er of My ponga, in which he affirms the practicability of stripping the trees at four years' growth with profit. This I do not deny, but I would point out tbat the district referred to is especially suitable for wattle cultivation, wnile my article was intended to deal with the matter from a general standpoint, viz., its adap tability to all the agricultural districts. It is unfair to compare wheat-growing with wattle cultivation, because the former has rot a ghost of a show, the latter being the most profitable industry which presents itself to the agriculturist of South Australia in the year 1884. I am, Sir, 4c., ACACIA. June 12, 1884,
