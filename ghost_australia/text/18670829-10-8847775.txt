CONGREGATIONAL UNION. The series of meetings in connexion with the annual sitting of the General Council of the Congregational body were brought to a close on Tuesday last by the ordination of Mr. Kennedy to the pastorate of the Congregational Church at Green Ponds. Mr. Kennedy succeeds the Rev. W. Water Hold, who was the beloved pastor of the church for a period of nearly twenty years, and resigned his charge on account of his infirmity, and to facilitate Mr. Kennedy's settlement at Green Ponds. The chapel was crowded, many being obliged to stand during the service, which was of a very interesting character. The Rev. J. Nisbet of New Town, road the scriptures and offered prayer ; the Rev. W. Law explained the principles of congrogationalism.tho supreme authority of Christ in his church, and the right of a very church to govern its own affairs, as guided by the word of Christ, the right of the church to choose its own ministers, the support of these ministers by the people choosing them without Booking aid from the State, and the union of the several independent churches by the bond of sympathy and love. The Rev. gentleman proposed the questions usual upon such occasions, which were answered by Mr. Kennedy in a very clear and satisfactory murmur. The order - nation prayer having been offered by the Rev. W. C. Robinson, the newly elected pastor and the people were addressed by the Rev. 0. Price from Acts vi., iv., " A man full of faith and of the Holy Ghost." The large schoolroom, which was laid out for ton was filled to overflowing soon after the service and the public meeting in the evening was one of very great interest. Addresses were delivered by the Revs. Nisbet, Robinson, Price, Law, Kennedy, and by Mr. Room of Launceston. From the spirit evinced at the meeting we believe that Mr. Kennedy commences his labors under auspicious circumstances, and with the prospect of great success.
